    A DOCTOR FOR?               

211
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,377
        I FIGURED I'D TELL      
        THE DOCTOR THAT.        
            IF I TELL YOU,      

212
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:19,113
                I'D GET TIRED   
            OF REPEATING IT.    

213
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,833
                NOW, THIS TOWN  
                GOT A DOCTOR?   

214
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,001
    I DON'T KNOW WHAT           
    I'LL TELL THE MAN           

215
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:26,637
    WHEN HE SEES                
    THIS SUITCASE.              

216
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:27,904
YOU'LL PUT                      
SOMETHING                       
TOGETHER.                       

217
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:29,607
            HE MIGHT HAVE       
        SECRET COMPARTMENTS.    

218
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:31,642
I'VE BEEN THROUGH               
IT 3 TIMES.                     

219
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,612
I TOLD YOU, HE GOT              
THE WRONG SUITCASE.             

220
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,585
    I'M TELLING YOU,            
    THE MAN GOT                 
    THE WRONG SUITCASE.         

221
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:49,860
            [Gunshots]          

222
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:52,396
        [Shouting]              

223
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,765
    [Patience] HEY! PA,         
    MAKE HIM LET GO!            

224
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:57,501
        I GOT HIM!              
        I GOT HIM, PA!          

225
00:13:57,568 --> 00:13:59,669
YOU PROMISE                     
TO MARRY THAT GIRL              

226
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:01,238
OR SOMETHING                    
OF THE SORT                     

227
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:02,806
        NOT EVEN SOMETHING      
            OF THE SORT.        

228
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,508
        I DON'T KNOW            
            THE LADY.           

229
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:06,710
            WE WAS STANDING     
            BY THE SALOON.      

230
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:08,779
            SHE COME WALKING BY.

231
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:10,647
    I SAID, "DOES YOUR MOTHER   
    KNOW YOU'RE OUT, CECILIA?"  

232
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:12,316
            KIND OF WITTY-LIKE? 

233
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,751
    THOUGHT SHE'D BLOW US       
            TO KINGDOM COME.    

234
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:17,721
        YOU NEVER SEEN SO MANY  
        FAST-LEAVING COWBOYS.   

235
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:20,090
        GUESS SHE JUST LIKES    
            TO SHOOT PEOPLE.    

236
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:23,527
WELL, SEEMS TO                  
BE ALL CLEAR.                   

237
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:26,563
WHERE'D YOU SAY                 
THAT DOCTOR WAS?                

238
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:29,566
    YOU KNOW, I STILL DON'T SEE 
    WHAT A BIG HEALTHY FELLA--  

239
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:31,501
    HE'S PROBABLY SHOOTING POOL 
    IN THE BACK OF THE SALOON.  

240
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,570
AT 1 A.M.?                      

241
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,306
                IT'S A REAL     
            UPSIDE-DOWN TOWN.   

242
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:36,907
                WITH 3 SHIFTS   
                OF MINERS       

243
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:39,043
            COMING ON AND OFF   
            WORK ALL DAY LONG.  

244
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,611
                HE ANSWERS TO   
                DOC SCHULTZ.    

245
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,948
        THANKS.                 

246
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:45,449
        YOU'RE SURE YOU DON'T   
        WANT TO BUY THE SPURS?  

247
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:48,285
        NO.                     

248
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:50,620
HEY, UH...                      

249
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:52,522
COWBOY'S GOT TO                 
BE PRETTY DOWN                  

250
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,326
TO BE WILLING TO SELL           
HIS HORSE IRONS.                

251
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:57,127
        MY HORSE WENT FIRST.    
            THEN MY SADDLE.     

252
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:58,895
            BUT I'M SOBER NOW,  

253
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,098
            AND WHAT I GOT LEFT 
            IS THESE HERE SPURS 

254

                    EMPTY BELLY.

255
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,036
OH, WELL. HERE.                 

256
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:08,973
HERE, YOU--                     
YOU EAT ON ME, HUH?             

257
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,241
                THANKS, FRIEND. 

258
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:14,511
            NAME'S JUG. JUG MAY.

259
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,247
UH, LATIGO SMITH.               
NOW, YOU ENJOY YOUR FOOD.       

260
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:19,083
        I CAN'T THANK YOU       
            ENOUGH.             

261
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:26,457
DON'T CRY. MONEY IS             
THE LEAST OF MY TROUBLES.       

262
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:29,059
            LET'S SEE...        

263
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:33,763
            $100! MISTER,       
            YOU GAVE--          

264
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,232
            I AIN'T EVER        
            EVEN SEEN ONE.      

265
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,936
            HA HA HA HA!        

266
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,240
        I AIN'T NEVER EVEN      
        SEEN A HUNDRED--        

267
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:45,309
    IF I HADN'T BEEN HURRIED,   

268
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,012
I COULD'VE GOTTEN HIM           
RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES!         

269
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,348
                YOU SURE DON'T  
                TAKE AFTER YOUR 
            POOR SAINTED MOTHER.

270
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,018
I HATE THIS TOWN                
AND IF I DON'T                  
GET BACK EAST                   

271
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:57,154
TO MISS HUNTER'S COLLEGE        
FOR YOUNG LADIES                
OF GOOD FAMILY                  

272
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,955
I'M GOING TO HATE IT            
A WHOLE LOT MORE...             

273
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,758
AND EVERYBODY IN IT!            

274
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:04,094
YOU AIN'T EXACTLY LOVED BY ONE  
    AND ALL AROUND HERE, EITHER!

275
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:05,562
THAT'S ENOUGH.                  

276
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,464
                CAN'T YOU DO    
            ANYTHING WITH HER?  

277
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:09,500
THIS IS                         
A FAMILY MATTER!                

278
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,435
I'LL THANK YOU                  
TO STAY OUT OF IT!              

279
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:12,302
COME ALONG,                     
ORIVILLE.                       

280
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:25,199
            18 BLACK AND EVEN.  
        EVERYBODY WINS AGAIN.   

281
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:28,568
                CARE TO PLACE   
            A LITTLE BET, SIR?  

282
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:29,904
YOU LOOKING                     
FOR TROUBLE,                    
MISTER?                         

283
00:16:29,971 --> 00:16:31,872
                        NO, SIR.

284
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,975
DO I LOOK                       
DIMWITTED ENOUGH                
TO PLAY THAT GAME?              

285
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:37,477
            AGAINST HOUSE RULES 
TO ANSWER THAT KIND OF QUESTION.

286
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:50,073
HOWDY. DO YOU PLAY              
POCKET BILLIARDS, SIR?          

287
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:51,742
                NOT NOW.        
            YOU DOC SCHULTZ?    

288
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,477
SAYS SO ON MY LICENSE.          

289
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,580
TOSS ME THAT PIECE              
OF CHALK? THANK YOU.            

290
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,081
                IF A MAN        
            TELLS HIS LAWYER    

291
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:00,150
                HE KILLED       
            A GENT OR 2,        

292
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:02,886
            THE LAWYER CAN'T    
        TELL ANYBODY, CAN HE?   

293
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:05,556
DON'T SEE THAT                  
CONCERNS ME ANY,                
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.               

294
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:07,925
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN            
COUNSEL AND CLIENT              
IS SACRED.                      

295
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:10,126
        SAME WITH A DOCTOR,     
            AIN'T IT?           

296
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:13,530
            A DOCTOR CAN'T TELL 
    ANYBODY WHAT ANYBODY'S GOT. 

297
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:16,333
YOU MUST HAVE A VERY            
INTERESTING DISEASE.            

298
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,169
                    IT'S WORTH  
                $500 TO YOU.    

299
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:21,738
GETTING MORE INTERESTING        
BY THE MINUTE.                  

300
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:25,442
        OF COURSE, I'LL HAVE TO 
BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF IF YOU TELL. 

301
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,444
I AIN'T NEVER SEEN              
A CASE OF LEPROSY.              

302
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:29,613
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT,         
I WOULDN'T KNOW.                

303
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,015
            IT AIN'T LEPROSY,   
    BUT CAN'T WE GO SOMEPLACE   

304
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,017
        WHERE WE COULD          
            BE ALONE?           

305
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:37,253
WELL, THAT SOUNDS               
LIKE A SOUND IDEA.              

306
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:45,996
MY OFFICE IS RIGHT              
UP THE STREET THERE.            

307
00:17:46,063 --> 00:17:47,931
            GOING TO CHANGE     
            YOUR MIND ABOUT     
                MAKING A BET?   

308

        THAT KIND OF MONEY.

        NOTHING I CAN DO        
            ABOUT IT.           

423
00:24:57,312 --> 00:25:02,882
                NUMBER 23 JUST  
                PULLS AT ME.    

424
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:05,652
            WELL...THEY SAY     
        MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING. 

425
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:07,487
IS IF A MAN'S HUNGRY.           

426
00:25:07,555 --> 00:25:10,723
                YEAH.           
    THAT REMINDS ME--           
            I'M HUNGRY.         

427
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:12,559
        HOW MUCH YOU GOT LEFT   
        OF THAT $100 I GAVE YOU?

428
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:14,794
    NONE.                       
                    NONE.       

429
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:16,997
WELL, I ATE UP                  
$20 OF IT.                      

430
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:19,333
BOUGHT A GAL SOME WINE.         
SHE HAD A SICK MOTHER IN--      

431
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,501
            GAVE HER THE MONEY? 

432
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:24,271
SEEMED LIKE THE                 
 THING TO DO.                   
    YOU IDIOT. DON'T YOU KNOW   

433
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:26,273
THAT'S THE SUREST WAY           
TO MAKE AN ENEMY                
        OF A WOMAN,             

434
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:28,375
            GIVING HER MONEY?   

435
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:32,245
            I LEARNED THAT      
                LONG AGO.       

436
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:35,181
                    WELL...     
            LET'S TAKE A WALK.

                NEED THE AIR    
            AND TIME TO THINK.  

438
00:25:43,023 --> 00:25:45,325
                ABOUT THAT JOB I
                WANT YOU TO DO--

439
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:48,962
I TOLD YOU                      
NOT TO BOTHER ME,               
    MISTER.                     

440
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:51,064
THE MAN SAID                    
SOMETHING                       
ABOUT A JOB.                    

441
00:25:51,131 --> 00:25:53,567
    I DON'T LIKE TO WORK.       
        TIRES ME OUT.           

442
00:25:53,634 --> 00:25:54,934

IF WE DON'T WORK?               

443
00:25:55,002 --> 00:25:57,771
                    WE?         

444
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,339

445
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:01,575
            RIDE? HORSES?       

446
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:02,909
    YEAH.                       
        I TOLD YOU I DON'T RIDE.

447
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:04,378
                I'M A TRAIN MAN.

448
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:06,279
            AT LEAST CARRIAGES. 

449
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:08,281
                MAN'S GOT TO BE 
            NUMB ON BOTH ENDS   

450
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:10,049
            TO EARN HIS LIVING  
            SITTING ON A HORSE. 

451
00:26:10,117 --> 00:26:11,951
                I JUST DON'T    
                LIKE HORSES.    

452
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:13,587
THAT'S CLOSE                    
TO TREASON                      
IN THESE PARTS.                 

453
00:26:13,654 --> 00:26:18,057
                    UH-HUH.     

454
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:22,529
                LIVELY PLACE.   

455
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:25,432
THIS IS A 2-SHAFT TOWN.         
ONLY ONE OF THEM WORKS          
FULL TIME.                      

456
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,834
HALF THE JACKASS MINERS         
IS DRINKING--

                THAT SALOON?    

458
00:26:29,404 --> 00:26:30,637
    HMM?                        

459
00:26:30,705 --> 00:26:33,106
                DOES A WOMAN    
                RUN THAT SALOON?

460
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:37,878
MISS JENNY.                     

461
00:26:37,945 --> 00:26:39,780
YOU STILL GOT THEM SPURS        
        YOU TRIED               
        TO SELL ME?             

462
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:48,755
            GIVE THEM TO ME.    

463
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:50,023
YOU THREW ONE AWAY.             

464
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,793
                DID JUST THAT.  

465
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,593
        [Dog barks]             

466
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:14,448
OPEN UP                         
ANOTHER TABLE.                  

467
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:15,482
                MISS JENNY?     

468
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:21,354
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

469
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:24,558
I BROUGHT YOU THIS...           

470
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:27,294
                    FROM SLIM.  

471
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:30,497
    WHAT IS THIS,               
        A JOKE?                 

472
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,865
MA'AM, I RODE                   
OVER 300 MILES                  
TO BRING YOU THAT SPUR.         

473
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:34,534
THIS IS HARDLY                  
A JOKING MATTER,                

474
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:38,371
POOR BOY DYING.                 

475
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:41,541
JUST ME AND HIM OUT THERE       
ON THE PRAIRIE ALL ALONE.       

476
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:44,111
WOLVES HOWLING                  
OFF IN THE DISTANCE.            

477
00:27:44,178 --> 00:27:47,013
"LAT," HE SAID TO ME,           

478
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:50,717
"THERE'S NOTHING                
I GOT LEFT EXCEPT               
THIS ONE SPUR.                  

479
00:27:50,784 --> 00:27:53,987
    "I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT      
    TO MY ONLY TRUE LOVE        
    MISS JENNY."                

480
00:27:54,054 --> 00:27:56,590
        I KNEW WHO              
    HE WAS TALKING              
ABOUT RIGHT OFF.                

481
00:27:56,657 --> 00:27:59,493
ALL THOSE LONELY                
NIGHTS ON THE TRAIL.            

482
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,529
HE HARDLY TALKED ABOUT          
ANYTHING BUT YOU.               

483
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,332
AND WHAT A HEART                
OF GOLD YOU HAD.                

484
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:07,534
    I KIND OF REMEMBER.         

485
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,403
THERE MUST'VE BEEN A SLIM.      

486
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:12,572
OH, BARTENDER,                  
GIVE THIS GENTLEMAN             
A DRINK.                        

487
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,507
                    [Bartender] 
                    YES, MA'AM. 

488
00:28:13,574 --> 00:28:15,408
    IS HE WITH YOU?             

489
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:18,578
            YES, MA'AM, I AM.   
            MY NAME IS JUG MAY. 

490
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:20,713
GIVE THEM BOTH A DRINK,         
AND I'LL HAVE ONE.              

491
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:24,651
NOW, ABOUT THIS SLIM...         

492
00:28:24,718 --> 00:28:26,753
HE WAS IN                       
LOVE WITH ME,                   
IS THAT IT?                     

493
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,923
MA'AM, THERE WAS NEVER          
A TRUER LOVE NOR NOBLER.        

494
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:32,859
THE MINUTE I LAID               
EYES ON YOU,                    

495
00:28:32,926 --> 00:28:35,262
I COULD UNDERSTAND WHY          
THE BOY FELT THAT WAY.          

496
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:36,630
YES, I CAN UNDERSTAND.          

497
00:28:36,697 --> 00:28:39,466
"MISS JENNY," HE SAID,          

498
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:41,268
"SHE'S NOT LIKE                 
OTHER WOMEN."                   

499
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:43,036
HE SAID THAT                    
REAL OFTEN.                     

500
00:28:43,103 --> 00:28:44,837
"NOW, MISS JENNY,               
SHE'S...

00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:48,141
    "SHE'S KIND                 
AND GENEROUS TO A FAULT

"AND WOULD GIVE A MAN           
HER LAST DIME."                 

503
00:28:52,846 --> 00:28:55,248
            YOU SURE            
    YOU'RE NOT LYING TO ME?     

504
00:28:55,316 --> 00:29:03,273
MAY I BE STRUCK DOWN            
IN MY TRACKS AND--              

505
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,108
                YOU ALL RIGHT?  

506
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,043
            IF THAT'S           
        THE 3RD SHIFT, I AM.    

507
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:10,079
SORRY. SOMETIMES                
IT COMES WITHOUT WARNING.       

508
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:12,849
NOW, GETTING BACK TO--          
TO SLIM.                        

509
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,750
HE REALLY SAID                  
THOSE NICE THINGS

00:37:09,376 --> 00:37:11,777
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE.            

656
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:14,714

00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:44,420
        TAYLOR'S GOT A FLAT.    

691
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,355

MORE THAN THAT.

711
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,456
MORNING.                        
                        MORNING.

712
00:39:54,524 --> 00:39:55,557
WHO ARE YOU?                    

713
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:56,825
            I'M THE NEW GIRL.   

714
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,996
YOU IS?                         

715
00:40:00,063 --> 00:40:01,931
                    I GOT IN    
                THIS MORNING    
                FROM FRISCO.

00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,900
            IN FACT,            
        THAT'S MY NAME,         
                FRISCO.         

717
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:05,968
WELL,                           
IT'S NICE WORK.                 

718
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,770
IT HAS ITS                      
UPS AND DOWNS,                  
BUT IT IS NICE WORK.            

719
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:31,610
BEAT IT.                        

720
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:33,178
                    PUT 'EM UP. 

721
00:40:33,246 --> 00:40:34,479
WHAT ARE YOU                    
GONNA DO                        
WITH THAT?                      

722
00:40:34,548 --> 00:40:35,514
                    KILL YOU.   

723
00:40:35,582 --> 00:40:37,550
WITH THAT?                      

724
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:40,385
I'M A ROTTEN SHOT               
AND GETTING AWFUL               
TIRED OF MISSING YOU            

725
00:40:40,453 --> 00:40:43,055
WHY ARE YOU SHOOTING AT ME      
IN THE FIRST PLACE?             

726
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:46,191
            SO I COULD GO TO    
        MISS HUNTER'S COLLEGE   

727
00:40:46,259 --> 00:40:48,360
    FOR YOUNG LADIES            
        OF GOOD FAMILY.         
        NOW PUT 'EM UP.         

728
00:40:48,428 --> 00:40:50,896
WHY PUT MY HANDS                
UP FOR THAT?                    

729
00:40:50,964 --> 00:40:53,498
        I DON'T FEEL RIGHT      
    ABOUT KILLING YOU IN BED.   

730
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:57,069
            COULD YOU TRY       
            AND GRAB ME?        

731
00:40:57,136 --> 00:40:59,672
            THEN I'D GET MAD    
            AND LIGHT THE FUSE. 

732
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:02,775
IT'S YOUR CHRISTIAN DUTY        
TO TELL ME WHY YOU'RE           
BLOWING ME UP.                  

733
00:41:02,842 --> 00:41:04,209
                    THE MINE.   

734
00:41:04,277 --> 00:41:06,579
THE MINE?                       

735
00:41:06,646 --> 00:41:09,514
        IF MY PA DON'T GET      
        TO THE MOTHER LODE      
        BEFORE COLONEL AMES,    

736
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:12,017
                THEN WE WON'T   
                HAVE ANY MONEY, 

737
00:41:12,085 --> 00:41:15,754
        AND I CAN'T GO TO MISS  
HUNTER'S COLLEGE. UNDERSTAND?   

738
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:19,091
NO, BUT WHAT'S                  
ALL THAT GOT                    
TO DO WITH ME?                  

739
00:41:19,158 --> 00:41:21,727
    DON'T PLAY THE INNOCENT,    
        MR. SWIFTY MORGAN.      

740
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:24,380
    YOU KNOW COLONEL AMES       
        SENT FOR YOU.           

741
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:27,550
    YOU THINK I'M               
THE FAMOUS SWIFTY MORGAN?       

742
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:29,452
    KEEP IT UP.                 
YOU'RE GETTING                  
        ME ANGRY.               

743
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:31,654
                IF I GET ANGRY, 
            I'LL LIGHT THIS--   

744
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:35,090
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT,        
BUT I'M NOT SWIFTY MORGAN.      

745
00:41:35,158 --> 00:41:40,095
        LIAR! MY PA IS SPARKING 
COLONEL AMES' OLD MAID SISTER.  

746
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:42,598
    SHE TOLD HIM COLONEL AMES   
        SENT FOR YOU, MORGAN.   

747
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,067
                WHAT'S THIS,    
                    A HOLDUP?   

748
00:41:45,134 --> 00:41:47,703
SHOW THE LADY                   
THE INSIDE OF ONE               
OF THOSE BOOTS.                 

749
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,605
THE INSIDE OF THE BOOTS.        

750
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,241
I HAD THOSE BOOTS MADE          
IN AMARILLO A YEAR AGO.         

751
00:41:52,308 --> 00:41:54,042
LOOK INSIDE.                    

752
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,847
    GO ON, LOOK.                

753

754
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:04,119
$60 BOOTS. A MAN                
CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE            
HIS RIGHT NAME IN THEM.         

755
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:08,357
YOU PROBABLY TOOK THEM OFF      
SOME POOR FELLA YOU SHOT.       

756
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,025
                    WHY, YOU'RE 
            THE BARTON GIRL.    

757
00:42:10,093 --> 00:42:12,027
        WHAT YOU DOING          
                IN HERE?        

758
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,629
            YOUR SAINTED MOTHER,
        ONE OF THE NICEST LADIES

759
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,931
        TO SEW FOR THE BAPTISTS.

760
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:19,702
        DOWN THE BACK STAIRS    
            WITH YOU. COME ON.  

761
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,970
YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE LAST      
OF ME YET, MR. SWIFTY MORGAN!   

762
00:42:37,237 --> 00:42:39,371
HELLO, LADIES' MAN.             
            HA HA HA!           

763
00:42:39,439 --> 00:42:41,173
                "I LOVE GOLDIE."

764
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:43,042
I WARNED YOU                    
ABOUT THAT.                     

765
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,678
            NOT TO MENTION IT   
            TO ANYBODY ELSE.    

766
00:42:45,746 --> 00:42:47,780
            I'VE STUDIED UP     
                ON TATTOOING.   

767
00:42:47,848 --> 00:42:50,783
    I CAN DO THE JOB FOR YOU,   
            BUT IN EASY STAGES. 

768
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:52,084
            TAKE A COUPLE WEEKS.

769
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,886
WHATEVER YOU SAY.               

770
00:42:53,954 --> 00:42:58,157
DOC, DOES THAT 500              
HAVE TO BE IN CASH?             

771
00:42:58,224 --> 00:43:00,693
            WELL, MISS JENNY'S  
            CERTAINLY GOT 500,  

772
00:43:00,761 --> 00:43:04,130
BUT THEN SHE'S HAD EXPERIENCE   
            WITH MEN LIKE YOU.  

773
00:43:04,197 --> 00:43:06,398
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,               
MEN LIKE ME?                    

774
00:43:06,466 --> 00:43:10,469
            GIVE YOU ANYTHING   
        EXCEPT CASH MONEY, HUH? 

775
00:43:10,537 --> 00:43:13,205
THERE'S ONE THING               
THAT DON'T CHANGE               
ABOUT WOMEN.                    

776
00:43:13,273 --> 00:43:16,208
THAT'S THE FACT                 
THAT THEY'RE                    
CHANGEABLE.                     

777
00:43:16,276 --> 00:43:18,360
            WHERE'D YOU LEARN   
            SO MUCH ABOUT WOMEN?

778
00:43:18,428 --> 00:43:23,732
I WORKED AT IT.                 

779
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,900
                HELLO, PATIENCE.

780
00:43:24,968 --> 00:43:26,902
WHAT'S WRONG                    
WITH HIM, DOC?                  

781
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:30,439
    YOU KNOW A DOC CAN'T TALK   
ABOUT HIS PATIENTS, PATIENCE.   

782
00:43:30,506 --> 00:43:34,310
DOC, WE'RE THE ONLY FRIENDS     
WE GOT IN THIS SCURVY TOWN.     

783
00:43:34,377 --> 00:43:36,912
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN               
IF WE GOT MAD                   
AT EACH OTHER?                  

784
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,548
            HE JUST GOT A LITTLE
        TROUBLE WITH THE CHEST. 

785
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:41,716
HIM?                            

786
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:44,153
HE LOOKS                        
STRONG AS A HORSE.              

787
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,521
                YOU'VE TAKEN    
            A DISLIKING TO HIM. 

788
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:48,623
I HATE                          
PROFESSIONAL                    
GUNSLINGERS.                    

789
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:50,459
            HIM, A GUNSLINGER?  

790
00:43:50,526 --> 00:43:53,362
THAT'S SWIFTY MORGAN.           

791
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,130
                I JUST STARTED  
        TAKING A LIKING TO HIM. 

792
00:43:55,198 --> 00:43:57,099
I'D HAD HIM SHOT BY NOW         

793
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,401
IF PA HADN'T TAKEN              
MY WINCHESTER                   
AWAY FROM ME.                   

794
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:01,971
                    PATIENCE,   
        STOP SHOOTING AT PEOPLE.

795
00:44:02,038 --> 00:44:04,039
                IF YOU WASN'T   
            SUCH A BAD SHOT,    

796
00:44:04,107 --> 00:44:06,408
    THERE WOULDN'T BE           
    A YOUNG MAN ALIVE           
        IN PURGATORY.           

797
00:44:06,476 --> 00:44:09,378
I HEARD YOU SHOT                
    AT ELMER PRICE              
        YESTERDAY.              

798
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,947
HE ASKED ME                     
TO MARRY HIM.                   

799
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:13,782
    THAT'S REASON ENOUGH        
            TO SHOOT HIM?       

800
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,284
DOC, YOU'VE SEEN ELMER?         

801
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:18,837
UGH!                            

802
00:44:18,905 --> 00:44:20,439
    MORNING, DOC.               

803
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:21,407
            UH, MORNING, ELMER. 

804
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:35,470
        MR. MORGAN.             

805
00:44:35,538 --> 00:44:36,972
            WHAT'D YOU CALL ME? 

806
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,874
WE KNOW                         
YOU'RE SWIFTY MORGAN.           

807
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,276
        WE HAVE                 
    A PROPOSITION               
        FOR YOU.                

808
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:43,411
WE WANT YOU                     
TO DOUBLE-CROSS                 
COLONEL AMES.                   

809
00:44:43,479 --> 00:44:44,880
    THERE'S $5,000 IN IT.       

810
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,049
                NOW, LOOK, I--  

811
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,284
                        $5,000? 

812
00:44:49,352 --> 00:44:50,385
                    CASH?       

813
00:44:50,453 --> 00:44:53,221
                    CASH.       

814
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:59,261
            SO YOU...YOU THINK  
            I'M SWIFTY MORGAN.  

815
00:44:59,328 --> 00:45:02,197
    I LOOK TO YOU LIKE THE BEST 
GUNMAN IN THE WHOLE SOUTHWEST.  

816
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:03,732
    KNEW RIGHT AWAY.            

817
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,200
    THAT SHARP,                 
    HAWK-LIKE GAZE,             

818
00:45:05,268 --> 00:45:08,170
    WAY YOU STAND.              

819
00:45:08,237 --> 00:45:11,140
                WELL, I HATE    
                TO SAY THIS,    

820
00:45:11,207 --> 00:45:17,146
            BUT THAT'S SWIFTY.  

821
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:19,014
                UH, SWIFTY...   

822
00:45:19,082 --> 00:45:22,785
                COME OVER HERE. 

823
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:27,189
                    COME ON.    
                COME OVER HERE. 

824
00:45:27,256 --> 00:45:28,724
                THESE GENTLEMEN 
            KNOW WHO YOU ARE.   

825
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,793
            THERE'S NO USE      
                DENYING IT.     

826
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,960
                HOWDY.          

827
00:45:32,028 --> 00:45:34,763
                    NOW THAT    
                THAT'S SETTLED, 

828
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:37,733
SWIFTY WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF   
YOU DIDN'T BANDY HIS NAME ABOUT.

829
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,534
                HE'S MODEST,    
                SWIFTY IS.      

830
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:41,837
                THESE GENTLEMEN 
            HAVE A PROPOSITION. 

831
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:46,441
    I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL RIGHT IF 
I HANDLE THE BUSINESS DETAILS.  

832
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:51,914
GO AHEAD AND FINISH YOUR GAME   
WHILE I TALK TO THESE GENTLEMEN.

833
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:53,182
        IT'S ALL RIGHT.         
                GO AHEAD.       

834
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,359
        KEEN EYE.               

835
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:06,294
            KILLED 5O,          
            THEY SAY.           

836
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:07,730
                EXAGGERATION.   

837
00:46:07,797 --> 00:46:10,766
                32 TO BE EXACT. 

838
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,501
        NOW, SUPPOSE YOU SPREAD 
        YOUR CARDS ON THE TABLE 

839
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:14,870
                AND THE CASH.   

840
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,707
    THE CASH IS                 
    IN MY SAFE.                 

841
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:21,576
AND IT'S BEST IF WE AREN'T      
SEEN TOGETHER TOO MUCH.         

842
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:23,812
        YOU SLIP OUT            
AND BRING THE MONEY             
            TO MY ROOM          

843
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,880
                IN 15 MINUTES.  

844
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:25,580
        RIGHT.                  

845
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:40,763
YOU CALLED ME SWIFTY.           

846
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,998
                THAT'S SHORT    
            FOR SWIFTY MORGAN.  

847
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,100
            THAT'S WHO THEY     
                THINK YOU ARE.  

848
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:49,304
    AND THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY  
TO BACK UP THAT MISTAKEN IDEA.  

849
00:46:49,372 --> 00:46:51,473
I'M SUPPOSED TO PRETEND         
I'M SWIFTY MORGAN?              

850
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,942
GOODBYE.                        

851
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:56,945
        THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY. 

852
00:46:57,013 --> 00:46:57,913
HOW MUCH?                       

853
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,848
                        $1,000. 

854
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:01,183
        WE'LL SPLIT IT          
                50/50.          

855
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:05,154
                    THAT MEANS  
                400 FOR YOU.    

856
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:07,422
SEEMS FAIR.                     

857
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,524
BUT I THINK THAT--              
            NO, NO, YOU DON'T.  

858
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:12,261
    THAT'S THE DEAL.            
            I THINK,            

859
00:47:12,328 --> 00:47:21,403
            YOU STAND AROUND    
            AND LOOK TOUGH.     

860
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,339
STOP THAT.                      

861
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:26,975
I TOLD YOU YOU'RE NOT           
TO REACH FOR THAT GUN           
NO MATTER WHAT.                 

862
00:47:27,043 --> 00:47:29,178
SOMEBODY                        
SPITS IN YOUR EYE,              

863
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:31,113
SOMEBODY CASTS DOUBTS           
ON YOUR MOTHER,                 

864
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,316
YOU REFER                       
THE MATTER TO ME.               

865
00:47:34,383 --> 00:47:36,118
IF I'M SUPPOSED                 
TO BE SWIFTY MORGAN,            

866
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,719
I'VE GOT MY REPUTATION          
TO CONSIDER.                    

867
00:47:37,787 --> 00:47:40,055
I'VE GOT ME TO CONSIDER.        

868
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:44,426
PRIDE.                          

869
00:47:44,493 --> 00:47:46,528
IF YOU START THINKING,          
THE DEAL'S OFF.                 

870
00:47:46,595 --> 00:47:51,499
NO $400.                        

871
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:52,835
            I'M GETTING BETTER. 

872
00:47:52,902 --> 00:47:59,507
                    YOU WATCH.  

873
00:47:59,575 --> 00:48:02,211
IF IT EVER COMES                
TO GUNFIGHTING,                 
YOU'LL NEVER LAST.              

874
00:48:02,278 --> 00:48:03,745
            SURE YOU AIN'T FAST?

875
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:05,580
NO. I'M SLOW.                   

876
00:48:05,648 --> 00:48:07,182
IT'S JUST...                    
YOU'RE EVEN SLOWER.             

877
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:14,056
    [Knocking on door]          

878
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:16,758
THEY COME SNEAKING IN,          
LOOKING AT THE REGISTER,        

879
00:48:16,826 --> 00:48:19,261
TRYING TO FIND                  
MR. SMITH.                      

880
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,563
I TRIED TO TELL THEM            
I GOT FOUR SMITHS.              

881
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,899
                    THANK YOU,  
                MRS. PERKINS.   

882
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,200
                    WE WOULDN'T 
            WANT TO KEEP YOU    
                FROM YOUR WORK. 

883
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:27,336
I SUPPOSE,                      
THE WAY THEY SNEAK IN,          

884
00:48:27,403 --> 00:48:30,339
THAT YOU'RE                     
ANOTHER GUNFIGHTER              

885
00:48:30,406 --> 00:48:33,475
THAT THESE STUPID MINERS        
KEEP HIRING AROUND HERE.        

886
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:35,477
I SUPPOSE                       
THEY'RE HIRING YOU              

887
00:48:35,544 --> 00:48:37,980
SO YOU CAN SHOOT                
SOME OTHER MOTHER'S SON,        

888
00:48:38,047 --> 00:48:40,448
THEN SOME OTHER                 
MOTHER'S SON                    
CAN SHOOT YOU.                  

889
00:48:40,516 --> 00:48:43,752
        MARTHA, UNHINGE         
    YOUR JAW AND DEPART.        

890
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:46,788
YOU SEE NOW                     
WHY I DEMAND MY RENT            

891
00:48:46,856 --> 00:48:49,758
IN ADVANCE EVERY DAY?           

892
00:48:49,825 --> 00:48:51,459
ANOTHER SMITH.                  

893
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:53,195
MORE OF THEM                    
COMING ALL THE TIME,            

894
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,563
GETTING THEMSELVES              
KILLED OFF.                     

895
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:56,899
                    THE MONEY?  

896
00:48:56,966 --> 00:48:58,100
SWIFTY IN THERE?                

897
00:48:58,167 --> 00:48:59,601
                YES. THE MONEY? 

898
00:48:59,668 --> 00:49:01,536
BEFORE WE TALK                  
TO MR. MORGAN,                  

899
00:49:01,604 --> 00:49:03,872
                    A LITTLE    
        SUPERSTITION OF HIS.    

900
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,641
                    HE LEAVES   
        MONEY MATTERS TO ME.    

901
00:49:06,709 --> 00:49:13,949
    I THANK YOU NOT TO MENTION  
ANYTHING ABOUT THE TRANSACTION. 

902
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:16,251
    UH, SORRY. DIDN'T MEAN      
    TO STARTLE YOU, SWIFTY.     

903
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,154
                THAT WAS CLOSE. 

904
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:20,688
        DON'T EVER COME UP      
        ON MY BLIND SIDE        
            LIKE THAT.          

905
00:49:20,756 --> 00:49:22,157
            [Crack]             

906
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:23,191
NO, SIR,                        
MR. MORGAN.                     

907
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:49,101
        [Gunfire]               

908
00:49:49,169 --> 00:49:51,670
        THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.    
            WHAT DO YOU WANT?   

909
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,438
I CAME TO SEE                   
THE KILLINGS.                   

910
00:49:53,506 --> 00:49:55,507
                WHAT KILLINGS?  

911
00:49:55,575 --> 00:50:00,112
YOU, FOR ONE,                   
AND THOSE OTHERS.               

912
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,748
IT SHOULD BE                    
QUITE A SHOW.                   

913
00:50:02,816 --> 00:50:05,217
THERE'S FOUR OF YOU             
AND ONE OF SWIFTY MORGAN.       

914
00:50:05,284 --> 00:50:07,886
I THOUGHT MORGAN                
WAS ON OUR SIDE.                

915
00:50:07,954 --> 00:50:10,488
THERE'S BEEN                    
SOME CHANGES MADE.              

916
00:50:10,556 --> 00:50:12,991
MORGAN, HE TOOK

917
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:16,328

MINE OWNERS.                    

918
00:50:16,395 --> 00:50:18,197

FAIR DEALINGS TO ME,

920
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,835
THAT HONESTY'S                  
THE BEST POLICY.                

921
00:50:22,902 --> 00:50:25,670
YOU ALL LOOK LIKE               
MIGHTY BRAVE MEN.               

922
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:28,240
            WHEN'S HE COMING,   
            THIS SWIFTY MORGAN? 

923
00:50:28,307 --> 00:50:32,144
WELL, HE SHOULD BE              
ALONG HERE ANY MINUTE.          

924
00:50:32,212 --> 00:50:33,011
HERE HE COMES.                  

925
00:50:44,557 --> 00:50:47,126
            YOU BOYS STAY HERE. 
        I'LL SLIP IN BEHIND HIM.

926
00:50:47,193 --> 00:50:48,994
I'LL GO WITH YOU.               

927
00:50:49,062 --> 00:50:49,995
        HEY, WAIT FOR US.       

928
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:06,845
THEY RAN AWAY,                  
MR. MORGAN.                     

929
00:51:06,913 --> 00:51:10,182
THEY RAN                        
WHEN THEY HEARD                 
YOU WERE COMING.                

930
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,350
ACT LIKE                        
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED.

00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:16,354
                WELL, I'M SURE  
                DISAPPOINTED.   

933
00:51:16,422 --> 00:51:18,323
    THEY WENT THATAWAY.         
    YOU CAN CATCH THEM.         

934
00:51:18,391 --> 00:51:19,958
                    I'LL JUST   
                LET THEM GO.    

935
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:21,426
                THEY LEARNED    
                THEIR LESSON.   

936
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:25,864
                I'M A PEACEABLE 
            FELLOW, REALLY...   

937
00:51:25,932 --> 00:51:27,432

THEY DON'T CARRY GUNS.          

1027
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:18,884
    THEY GOT A COP              
ON EVERY STREET CORNER          

1028
00:57:18,951 --> 00:57:20,619
TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM             
SHOOTING ONE ANOTHER.           

1029
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:22,787
    AND, UH...

00:57:22,855 --> 00:57:24,623
THEY DON'T RIDE HORSES.         

1031
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:29,127
NO, THEY GOT CARRIAGES

            HOMESICK FOR IT.    

1036
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:37,719

        HOW YOU COULD           
            LEAVE THERE

01:01:23,929 --> 01:01:25,596
                    STOP IT!    
            GET YOUR HANDS OFF! 

1125
01:01:25,664 --> 01:01:26,964
SHE KICKS                       
LIKE A MULE.                    

1126
01:01:27,032 --> 01:01:29,434
    TAYLOR! OH, MY DARLING,     

1127
01:01:29,501 --> 01:01:30,801
WHAT ARE THEY                   
DOING TO YOU?                   

1128
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:32,570
        NOTHING SO FAR.         

1129
01:01:32,637 --> 01:01:34,905
        WHAT WE DO              
        DEPENDS ON YOU.         

1130
01:01:34,973 --> 01:01:36,574
OOH,                            
I WISH I HADN'T                 

1131
01:01:36,641 --> 01:01:38,342
BOUGHT YOU                      
THAT BOOK                       
ON NAPOLEON!                    

1132
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:40,511
                COLONEL, THIS   
                IS RIDICULOUS!  

1133
01:01:40,579 --> 01:01:43,714
        INDEED IT IS...         

1134
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:46,050
        BUT NOT FOR LONG,       

1135
01:01:46,118 --> 01:01:48,686
BECAUSE ONE OF TWO THINGS       
    IS GOING TO HAPPEN.         

1136
01:01:48,753 --> 01:01:49,920
FIRST, YOU'RE GOING TO          
        GET YOUR WORKERS        

1137
01:01:49,988 --> 01:01:51,655
            OUT OF THE GROUND   

1138
01:01:51,723 --> 01:01:53,991
AND PROMISE NEVER TO SEE        
        MY SISTER AGAIN,        

1139
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:55,759
                    OR SECOND...

1140
01:01:55,827 --> 01:01:57,495
                THE OTHER THING 
            IS GOING TO HAPPEN. 

1141
01:01:57,563 --> 01:01:58,963
        WHAT OTHER THING?       

1142
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:01,065
            MY BOYS WILL        
            TAKE YOU OUT        

1143
01:02:01,133 --> 01:02:03,901
    IN A SWAMP                  
AND PUT A BULLET                
THROUGH YOUR HEAD.              

1144
01:02:03,969 --> 01:02:05,903
    THAT'S MURDER!              

1145
01:02:05,971 --> 01:02:10,775
                I STUDIED LAW.  
        OF COURSE IT'S MURDER.  

1146
01:02:10,843 --> 01:02:12,577
                    WHAT ARE YOU
                    GOING TO DO?

1147
01:02:12,644 --> 01:02:14,545
I'LL SAVE                       
YOUR FATHER'S LIFE              

1148
01:02:14,613 --> 01:02:17,181
AND MAKE                        
AN HONEST DOLLAR.               

1149
01:02:17,248 --> 01:02:22,169
        [Abigail]               
        HE WAS SUCH             
    A NICE MAN AND...           

1150
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,538
    I WISH I'D NEVER            
    GIVEN YOU THAT BOOK         

1151
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:29,510
    FIVE YEARS AGO CHRISTMAS!   

1152
01:02:29,578 --> 01:02:30,478
    WHERE DO YOU THINK          
    YOU'RE GOING?               

1153
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:31,879
IN THERE.                       

1154
01:02:31,947 --> 01:02:33,114
        WELL, YOU AIN'T.        

1155
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:34,815
            HOW WILL YOU        
            STOP ME?            

1156
01:02:34,883 --> 01:02:37,218
                    LIKE THIS.  

1157
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:38,586
    LET ME GIVE YOU             
    SOME ADVICE,                

1158

                MORGAN'S, PAL.

                SORRY,          
        I DIDN'T KNOW           
            WHO YOU WAS.        

1161
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:51,499
                    EXCUSE ME,  
            WILL YOU, MISTER?   

1162
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,600
                        LATIGO. 

1163
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:53,801

1164
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:55,370
        EVENING.                

1165
01:02:55,437 --> 01:02:57,171
        YOUR WINDOW             
    WAS OPEN OVER THERE.        

1166
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:59,507
I COULDN'T HELP                 
OVERHEARING                     
ALL THE JABBER

1171
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,617
    WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OVER    
            THIS LITTLE TROUBLE 

1172
01:03:09,684 --> 01:03:10,751
            THAT YOU MINERS     
                ARE HAVING.     

1173
01:03:10,819 --> 01:03:12,019
            THE WAY I SEE IT,   

1174
01:03:12,087 --> 01:03:13,721
                THE RACE        
            TO THE MOTHER LODE  

1175
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:16,491
            IS JUST THAT--      
                A RACE.         

1176
01:03:16,558 --> 01:03:19,294
            YEAH, ME AND SWIFTY,

1177

                TO BE AROUND    

1178
01:03:21,997 --> 01:03:22,963
                    JUST TO SEE 
                THAT EVERYTHING 

1179
01:03:23,031 --> 01:03:25,065
                IS RUN FAIR...  

1180
01:03:25,133 --> 01:03:26,467
                    AND SQUARE. 

1181
01:03:26,535 --> 01:03:28,135
NOW LET ME                      
GET THIS STRAIGHT.              

1182
01:03:28,203 --> 01:03:29,904
YOU AND THIS                    
SWIFTY MORGAN,                  

1183
01:03:29,971 --> 01:03:32,307
BY THE POWER                    
OF SWIFTY'S GUN,                

1184
01:03:32,374 --> 01:03:33,808

1185
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:36,544
        WHAT WE CAN             
        AND CANNOT DO.          

1186
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:37,779
            LONG-WINDED WAY     
                OF SAYING IT,   

1187
01:03:37,846 --> 01:03:42,784
            BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

1188
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:45,152
                YOU'RE LAUGHING.

1189
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,054
    I JUST THOUGHT              
OF SOMETHING VERY FUNNY.        

1190
01:03:47,122 --> 01:03:48,723
                YOU AGREEING    
                    OR WHAT?    

1191
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:50,257
I DON'T SEE                     
WHAT ELSE I CAN DO...           

1192
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,592
FOR THE MOMENT.                 

1193
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,861
                WHAT ABOUT      
            MISS ABIGAIL AND PA?

1194
01:03:53,929 --> 01:03:56,197
            YOU WON'T LET       
    THE COLONEL SEPARATE THEM?  

1195
01:03:56,264 --> 01:04:03,771
    ME AND SWIFTY STAND         
    IN FAVOR OF LOVE.           

1196
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,707
        YOU'RE LAUGHING AGAIN.  

1197
01:04:05,774 --> 01:04:06,874
            DON'T YOU THINK     
                YOU OUGHT TO    

1198
01:04:06,942 --> 01:04:08,609
    LET THE REST OF US          
            IN ON IT?

IN DUE TIME.                    

1201
01:04:19,104 --> 01:04:20,671
                GOOD MORNING.   
MORNING.                        

1202
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:22,673
                    I BEEN UP   
            ALL NIGHT WORRYING. 

1203
01:04:22,741 --> 01:04:24,808
WHAT ABOUT?                     
                SWIFTY MORGAN.  

1204
01:04:24,876 --> 01:04:26,244
            WHAT IF HE FINDS OUT

1205
01:04:26,311 --> 01:04:27,478
    I BEEN PRETENDING           
            TO BE HIM           

1206
01:04:27,546 --> 01:04:29,447
                    AND COMES   
                LOOKING FOR ME? 

1207
01:04:29,514 --> 01:04:30,548
THAT AIN'T                      
GOING TO HAPPEN.                

1208
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,015
                WHAT IF IT DOES?

1209
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:35,419
JUG, YOU LET ME WORRY           
ABOUT SWIFTY MORGAN.            

1210
01:04:44,763 --> 01:04:46,930
        BUTCHER.                
                    YES, SIR?   

1211
01:04:46,998 --> 01:04:48,399
        I WONDER                
    WHAT WOULD HAPPEN           

1212
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:49,900
    IF, DURING THAT             
        BIG WINGDING            

1213
01:04:49,968 --> 01:04:51,535

    AT THE MINE TONIGHT,        

1214
01:04:51,603 --> 01:04:53,571
        ONE OF THOSE            
    DYNAMITE JACKASSES          

1215
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:56,374

    IN AN ELEVATOR              

1216
01:04:56,441 --> 01:04:58,041

1217
01:04:58,109 --> 01:04:59,843
                    THE SHAFT   
                WOULD CAVE IN.  

1218
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:00,878
        IT WOULD TAKE           
        A LITTLE TIME           

1219
01:05:00,945 --> 01:05:02,780
    TO DIG IT OUT,              
        WOULDN'T IT?

1222
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,117
MAYBE MORE.                     

1223
01:05:07,185 --> 01:05:10,254
                    WHAT IF     
            SWIFTY MORGAN       
                CATCHES US?

        BUT WHEN PATIENCE       
            GOT INVOLVED--      

1324
01:10:26,904 --> 01:10:28,805
            INVOLVED?           

1325
01:10:28,873 --> 01:10:30,807
            I COULDN'T CHEAT    
                THE MAN SHE WAS 
                GOING TO MARRY. 

1326
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:31,808
                MARRY?          

1327
01:10:31,876 --> 01:10:33,477
THE SIDEWINDER?                 

1328
01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:34,745
                    THAT'S WHAT 
                    SHE TOLD ME.

1329
01:10:34,812 --> 01:10:36,447
    WELL, SHE TOLD YOU WRONG.   

1330
01:10:36,514 --> 01:10:41,118
                OW!             

1331
01:10:41,185 --> 01:10:44,588
                MARRY?          

1332
01:10:44,656 --> 01:10:50,160
THE SIDEWINDER?                 

1333
01:10:50,228 --> 01:10:53,130
LAT?                            

1334
01:10:53,197 --> 01:10:54,231
I THOUGHT                       
I OUGHT TO SEE YOU              

1335
01:10:54,299 --> 01:10:56,700
FACE TO FACE.                   

1336
01:10:56,768 --> 01:10:57,901
I HOPE IT DIDN'T                
HURT TOO MUCH                   

1337
01:10:57,969 --> 01:10:58,802
WHEN I HIT YOU                  
WITH THE CHAIR                  

1338
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:00,036
                I'M ALL RIGHT.  

1339
01:11:00,104 --> 01:11:01,772
            THE DOC JUST        
                SAID SO.        

1340
01:11:01,839 --> 01:11:04,074
I JUST COULDN'T                 
HELP FEELING                    
THE WAY I DID.                  

1341
01:11:04,142 --> 01:11:05,842
                I UNDERSTAND.   

1342
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:09,513
WHAT IF WE'D KEPT               
GOING TOGETHER,                 
GOT MARRIED,                    

1343
01:11:09,581 --> 01:11:10,814
YOU'D BEEN KILLED               
IN AN ACCIDENT,                 

1344
01:11:10,882 --> 01:11:12,716
AND I HAD TO                    
IDENTIFY YOU?                   

1345
01:11:12,784 --> 01:11:14,084
I'D LOOK THE FOOL.              

1346
01:11:14,152 --> 01:11:15,886
YOU'D BE LAID OUT               

1347
01:11:15,953 --> 01:11:17,220
WITH SOME                       
OTHER WOMAN'S

"I LOVE GOLDIE."                

1349
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:20,223
NOW, WOULDN'T

1350
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:22,192
    I SAID I UNDERSTOOD.        
            JUST LET IT GO.     

1351
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,594
WHAT IF WE WENT                 
TO A PICNIC,                    

1352
01:11:23,662 --> 01:11:24,895
YOU GOT ANTS                    
IN YOUR SHIRT,                  

1353
01:11:24,962 --> 01:11:26,997
HAD TO RIP IT OFF,              

1354
01:11:27,064 --> 01:11:33,537
AND EVERYBODY                   
WOULD SEE YOUR CHEST?           

1355
01:11:33,605 --> 01:11:36,072
I WISH YOU                      
DID HAVE T.B.                   

1356
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:46,750
INSTEAD OF                      
THAT DAMN                       
ROTTEN TATTOO.                  

1357
01:11:46,818 --> 01:11:48,251
I'LL BE DAMNED.                 

1358
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,586
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME           

1359
01:11:49,654 --> 01:11:52,122
I EVER SEEN                     
THE SIDEWINDER CRY.             

1360
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:54,358
                        WELL... 

1361
01:11:54,426 --> 01:11:55,292
                        SHE'S A 
                SENSITIVE GIRL. 

1362
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:09,005
EVERYTHING                      
UNDER CONTROL,                  
MR. MORGAN?                     

1363
01:12:09,073 --> 01:12:11,408
                    BETTER BE...

1364
01:12:11,476 --> 01:12:12,543
                OR I'LL KNOW    
                THE REASON WHY. 

1365
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:29,560
                OH, DARLING,    
            ISN'T IT WONDERFUL? 

1366
01:12:29,627 --> 01:12:31,795
            NO MORE TROUBLE     
                BETWEEN YOU     
            AND MY BROTHER.     

1367
01:12:31,863 --> 01:12:33,063
                        I WISH  
                YOU'D KNOWN HIM 

1368
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:34,531
                        BEFORE  
            HE STARTED READING  

1369
01:12:34,599 --> 01:12:36,900
                THAT BLASTED    
            BOOK ABOUT NAPOLEON 

1370
01:12:36,968 --> 01:12:38,902
            AND STICKING        
                HIS HAND        
            IN HIS COAT.        

1371
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:48,345
LET'S DANCE.                    

1372
01:12:48,413 --> 01:12:49,880
YOU SURE YOU KNOW               
ABOUT THIS BLASTING?            

1373
01:12:49,947 --> 01:12:51,214
                        I GOT   
                ALL MY FINGERS  

1374
01:12:51,282 --> 01:12:52,816
                AND DON'T TALK  
            IN A HIGH VOICE.    

1375
01:12:52,884 --> 01:12:54,585
                LET'S GET AT IT.
I DON'T LIKE THIS.              

1376
01:12:54,652 --> 01:12:55,652
WHAT HAPPENS                    
IF SWIFTY MORGAN                

1377
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,920
FINDS OUT                       
WHAT WE'VE DONE?                

1378
01:12:56,988 --> 01:12:58,422
                    LET ME WORRY
            ABOUT SWIFTY MORGAN.

1379
01:12:58,490 --> 01:12:59,122
                TAKE US DOWN.   

1380
01:14:11,028 --> 01:14:13,196
YOU'RE NOT DANCING,             
MR. SMITH.                      

1381
01:14:13,264 --> 01:14:14,064
                    THAT MAKES  
            TWO OF US, COLONEL. 

1382
01:14:14,131 --> 01:14:15,499
I SHOULD BE.                    

1383
01:14:15,567 --> 01:14:16,900
THIS IS A VERY                  
HAPPY OCCASION FOR ME.          

1384
01:14:16,968 --> 01:14:18,268
                        IT IS?  

1385
01:14:18,336 --> 01:14:20,170
WELL, IS ISN'T                  
EVERY DAY                       

1386
01:14:20,237 --> 01:14:22,372
YOU MEET                        
A FAMOUS GUNMAN                 
LIKE SWIFTY MORGAN.             

1387
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,542
COULD YOU                       
POINT HIM OUT TO ME?            

1388
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:26,777
                    THERE HE IS 
            RIGHT OVER THERE.   

1389
01:14:26,845 --> 01:14:32,082
                    THAT'S HIM. 

1390
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:34,485
        I'M SURPRISED           
        YOU DIDN'T              
        RECOGNIZE HIM           

1391
01:14:34,552 --> 01:14:39,823
            BY THE COLD,        
            DEADLY LOOK         
        IN HIS EYE AND...       

1392
01:14:39,891 --> 01:14:41,658
            YOU THOUGHT         
            OF SOMETHING        
        FUNNY AGAIN, HUH?       

1393
01:14:41,726 --> 01:14:44,194
MATTER OF FACT,                 
I DID.                          

1394
01:14:44,261 --> 01:14:46,997
            YOU THINK IT'S TIME 
            YOU LET ME IN ON IT?

1395
01:14:47,064 --> 01:14:49,600
IT IS                           
PRECISELY THE TIME.             

1396
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:51,101
SO THAT'S                       
SWIFTY MORGAN?                  

1397
01:14:51,168 --> 01:14:54,404
                IN THE FLESH.   

1398
01:14:54,472 --> 01:14:57,407
BUT THAT GENTLEMAN              
HAS A BEAUTIFUL                 
HEAD OF HAIR.                   

1399
01:14:57,475 --> 01:15:01,879
SWIFTY MORGAN                   
IS BALD AS AN EGG.              

1400
01:15:01,946 --> 01:15:03,380
                        AN EGG? 

1401
01:15:03,447 --> 01:15:06,583
AN EGG.                         

1402
01:15:06,651 --> 01:15:09,686

WHAT ACTION                     
DO YOU SUPPOSE                  
SWIFTY WOULD TAKE               

1404
01:15:11,322 --> 01:15:14,024
WHEN HE ENCOUNTERS              
THAT FRAUD,                     

1405
01:15:14,091 --> 01:15:18,061
THAT COW NURSE                  
WHO IS USING                    
HIS FAMOUS NAME?                

1406
01:15:18,129 --> 01:15:21,532
                WELL, I'LL HAVE 
            TO THINK IT OVER.   

1407
01:15:21,599 --> 01:15:24,200
YOU KNOW, I NEVER               
SENT FOR SWIFTY MORGAN.         

1408
01:15:24,268 --> 01:15:26,302

PRETENDING TO,                  

1409
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:29,439
BECAUSE I KNEW                  
MY FOOL SISTER                  

1410
01:15:29,507 --> 01:15:32,175

I'D RETAINED                    
THE FAMOUS GUNMAN.

BUT I SENT HIM                  
A TELEGRAM TODAY                

1412
01:15:34,913 --> 01:15:36,980
TELLING HIM                     
AN IMPOSTER WAS                 
REPRESENTING HIMSELF            

1413
01:15:37,048 --> 01:15:42,419
AS SWIFTY MORGAN.               

1414
01:15:42,486 --> 01:15:45,622
WHY AREN'T YOU                  
LAUGHING, YOUNG MAN?            

1415
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:50,861
                SOMEHOW I JUST  
        CAN'T SEEM TO MAKE IT.  

1416
01:15:50,929 --> 01:15:51,895
            MY SHAFT!           

1417
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,059

1419
01:16:06,027 --> 01:16:07,627
BY THAT TIME,

1434
01:16:41,562 --> 01:16:43,230

01:19:21,773 --> 01:19:25,008
    HE TOLD ON YOU.

YOU TOLD ME                     
IT WAS JUST 1,000.              

1470
01:19:31,616 --> 01:19:32,749
            YOU GOT A RIGHT

1471
01:19:32,817 --> 01:19:33,784

01:19:41,425 --> 01:19:45,295
                        2 BITS. 

1477
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:46,930

1490
01:20:16,494 --> 01:20:18,695

                I AIN'T GOING   
                TO BE HERE.     

1492
01:20:19,998 --> 01:20:21,464
I'LL BE HERE.                   

1493
01:20:21,533 --> 01:20:23,800

                YOU BE HERE?    

1494
01:20:23,868 --> 01:20:25,536
BECAUSE IF I RUN,               
PEOPLE WILL THINK               
I'M SCARED.                     

1495
01:20:25,603 --> 01:20:28,872
                I'M SCARED.     
                    AIN'T YOU?  

1496
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:31,441
WELL, YEAH,                     
BUT I AIN'T                     
GOING TO RUN.                   

1497
01:20:31,509 --> 01:20:32,976
            WHAT DO YOU CARE    
            WHAT PEOPLE THINK   

1498
01:20:33,044 --> 01:20:33,810
                IF YOU'RE NOT   
            GOING TO BE HERE?

        A .45 SLUG.             

1501
01:20:38,516 --> 01:20:40,584
            YOU KNOW SOMETHING? 

1502
01:20:40,652 --> 01:20:42,318
        YOU'RE THE SMARTEST     
            FELLER I EVER MET.  

1503
01:20:42,386 --> 01:20:43,520
YOU ARE A MINORITY.             

1504
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:45,422
                YOU AIM HIGH.   

1505
01:20:45,489 --> 01:20:47,290
        SADDLE-POUNDING JOBS,   
        ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. 

1506
01:20:47,358 --> 01:20:49,125
                    THEY NEVER  
        INTERESTED YOU NONE.    

1507
01:20:49,193 --> 01:20:52,629
    THAT'S WHAT                 
I'M GOING TO DO--               
        AIM HIGH.               

1508
01:20:52,697 --> 01:20:55,799
        I MAY NOT HAVE MUCH OF  
    A CHANCE WITH SWIFTY MORGAN,

1509
01:20:55,867 --> 01:20:58,035
                    BUT SUPPOSE 
                    I DOWN HIM. 

1510
01:20:58,102 --> 01:21:00,571
WELL,                           
SUPPOSING YOU DON'T,            

1511
01:21:00,638 --> 01:21:02,839
AND THE ODDS                    
ARE ABOUT 1,000                 
TO 1 THAT YOU WON'T.            

1512
01:21:02,907 --> 01:21:05,609
YOU'LL JUST END UP              
AN UNKNOWN CHARACTER            

1513
01:21:05,677 --> 01:21:07,811
UNDER A WOODEN                  
CROSS ON BOOT HILL.             

1514
01:21:07,879 --> 01:21:09,813
            EVERYBODY WINDS UP  
        DEAD SOONER OR LATER.   

1515
01:21:09,881 --> 01:21:12,382
US SMART ONES                   
TRY TO POSTPONE IT              
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.            

1516
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:15,418
            MY MIND'S MADE UP.  

1517
01:21:15,486 --> 01:21:17,287
JUG, I DON'T WANT               
TO BE RESPONSIBLE               

1518
01:21:17,354 --> 01:21:18,889
FOR GETTING YOU DEAD.           

1519
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:20,958
NOW, LET'S                      
BLOW THIS TOWN

A RIPE OLD AGE, HUH?            

1521
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,927
            MY MIND'S MADE UP.  

1522
01:21:23,995 --> 01:21:25,495
                IT'S MY CHANCE  
                TO BE SOMEBODY. 

1523
01:21:25,563 --> 01:21:27,598
NO CHANCE,                      
THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT.            

1524
01:21:27,665 --> 01:21:36,840
    SWIFTY MORGAN               
IS GREASED LIGHTNING            
        WITH A GUN.

I BEEN PRACTICING.              

1526
01:21:41,779 --> 01:21:43,179
NOW, YOU JUST                   
SNAP YOUR FINGERS               

1527
01:21:43,247 --> 01:21:44,815
WHEN YOU                        
WANT ME TO DRAW.                

1528
01:21:44,882 --> 01:21:46,617

1530
01:21:59,931 --> 01:22:02,966

                THE SLOWEST.

WELL, I MIGHT GET IN            
A LUCKY SHOT.                   

1532
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:08,238
        I GOT A FEELING         
            YOU'RE GOING        
        ON A LONG TRIP.         

1533
01:22:08,305 --> 01:22:10,040
                    NOW, WHY    
                NOT GO ALIVE?   

1534
01:22:10,108 --> 01:22:11,708
YOU DON'T HAVE                  
TO STAY. TAKE OFF.              

1535
01:22:11,776 --> 01:22:13,010
