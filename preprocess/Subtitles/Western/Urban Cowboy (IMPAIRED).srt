- OK.

- It's $2 for eight seconds.

It's what they train rodeo riders on.
It's a bucking machine.

- No, but I rode some rank horses.

- It's different. Right- or left-handed?
- Right.

You don't sign the release again.
Just another $2.

I was so proud of you, Bud.
You looked so great up on that bull.

You were the best one all night long.

00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,453
Hold on a second.

450
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:57,667
Sissy, take him home.

451
00:41:01,045 --> 00:41:03,089
<i>[Sissy] Bud?</i>

452
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,883
Bud, it's seven o'clock.

453
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:13,641
If you're not goin' in to work,
I'll call you in sick.

454
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:17,937
- Brought you some coffee.
- Get me a beer.

455
00:41:18,062 --> 00:41:21,482
- If they smell beer on your breath...
- Just get me a beer!

456
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,651
Yes, sir.

457
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:34,370
Sweetheart, are you sure
you're OK to go to work?

458
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:06,152
- Hi, Daddy.
- Morning, honey.

459
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:12,992
If it's OK, I wanna get off early today.

460
00:42:13,117 --> 00:42:16,746
That's all right with me,
if your mother don't mind.

461
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:22,793
- Ma, I wanna get off early today, OK?
- It's OK with me if it's OK with him.

462
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:24,211
Guess it's OK.

463
00:42:32,595 --> 00:42:36,682
- Better eat something. You'll get sick.
- No, I'll be all right.

464
00:42:51,822 --> 00:42:54,492
- Hi, Marshalene.
- Hi, Sissy.

465
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,707
Fine. You're ridin' fine.

466
00:43:05,336 --> 00:43:07,546
- Hi, y'all.
- Hi, Sissy.

467
00:43:07,672 --> 00:43:09,965
- Hi, Sissy.
- [Steve] Remember Wes?

468
00:43:11,217 --> 00:43:16,472
He's livin' out back. Workin' here.
Gonna help me run the bull.

469
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:19,892
Get on up and take a ride.

470
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:22,269
OK.

471
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:33,322
Push, lift. Push, lift.
All right. Turn

472
00:43:33,364 --> 00:43:36,200
loose with that hand.
Turn loose with it.

473
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:39,996
Turn loose with it. All right.
Now stick it up in the air.

474
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:44,458
- Up behind you. Turn your arm.
- [Jessie] Come on. Don't be scared.

475
00:43:53,968 --> 00:43:56,429
Hey, David.
Send me down some more mud.

476
00:43:57,304 --> 00:43:58,305
OK.

477
00:44:15,906 --> 00:44:17,950
Good God Almighty!

478
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:22,872
Bud!

479
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:34,050
Bud!

480
00:44:37,136 --> 00:44:41,015
- Ma'am, you are good!
- [Jessie] What are you grinnin' at?

481
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,602
Turn to the left. Hit it. In the well.

482
00:44:44,727 --> 00:44:48,856
Get that arm back. You look fine.
You're a bull rider, child!

483
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:58,866
Don't move, Bud! Don't move!

484
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:02,453
Arch your back, arch your back.

485
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:04,580
Hang on, Bud.

486
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:05,998
Hang on.

487
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:09,585
- I can't take it!
- Stop it!

488
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:25,059
Take it easy. You'll be all right.
We'll get you down.

489
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:27,770
You'll be all right.

490
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:32,483
I'm gonna go get the crane.

491
00:45:38,322 --> 00:45:41,659
- How long you been married?
- Not very long at all.

492
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:47,373
- How long?
- I don't know. About a week, I guess.

493
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:52,461
All right. Just pretend
like you're still on your honeymoon.

494
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:10,062
<i>[knocking]</i>

495
00:46:15,735 --> 00:46:19,947
- Hi. Bob told me what happened.
- Well, come on in.

496
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:22,700
- I came to check on you.
- Can I get you a drink?

497
00:46:22,825 --> 00:46:25,077
Shoot, no, darlin'.

498
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:29,540
- How are you?
- Fine. They've given me this codeine.

499
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:31,709
Yeah?

500
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:37,757
<i>- Where's Sissy? ls she at work?
- Oh, Sissy. I'd better call her.</i>

501
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:42,928
If she finds out from somebody else
but me, she'll probably get worried.

502
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:50,436
My God, Bud. Y'all live like pigs.

503
00:47:07,495 --> 00:47:09,538
What's the matter?

504
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:14,293
Nothin' much.
He just almost got himself killed.

505
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:16,253
- Killed?
- That's right.

506
00:47:16,379 --> 00:47:18,422
- Where is he?
- He's in the tub.

507
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:21,050
Bud?

508
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:25,721
- Bud, what happened?
- I fell off the scaffold.

509
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:28,391
- You're kiddin'.
- No. 200 feet in the air.

510
00:47:28,516 --> 00:47:30,851
Damn near broke my back.
Where you been?

511
00:47:30,976 --> 00:47:34,855
I was with Jessie.
I guess I forgot the time. You OK?

512
00:47:34,981 --> 00:47:40,778
Bud? Listen, darlin', I'm gonna
go home now that Sissy's here. OK?

513
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:43,698
I couldn't get to this bathroom.
Maybe Sissy can.

514
00:47:43,823 --> 00:47:45,574
Don't worry about that.

515
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,079
I put some tuna salads
in the icebox for y'all, OK?

516
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:55,126
If you need anything else, just call.
You know where we are.

517
00:47:55,251 --> 00:47:57,294
Bye-bye, Sissy.

518
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:03,592
Get me another beer.
I gotta soak longer.

519
00:48:03,718 --> 00:48:05,553
OK.

520
00:48:25,698 --> 00:48:29,160
What was you and Jessie up to?
I thought you didn't like her.

521
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:32,371
Jessie's all right. Just girl talk.

522
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,045
I like my tuna salad
when it has pecans and apple,

523
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:41,756
not so much of this onion.

524
00:48:41,881 --> 00:48:45,509
We don't have no pecans and apples
cos you ain't been shoppin'.

525
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:48,512
Corene asked me what I wanted.
I said corn bread.

526
00:48:48,637 --> 00:48:52,850
- She couldn't even find any instant.
- Don't complain against me, Bud.

527
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:55,853
There's certain things
a man wants from his wife.

528
00:48:55,978 --> 00:49:00,191
Like to be here when he gets home and
to cook once in a while and clean up.

529
00:49:00,316 --> 00:49:02,360
Make good love to him.

530
00:49:04,236 --> 00:49:07,531
Look, I know that's good, OK?
But that ain't enough.

531
00:49:11,202 --> 00:49:13,788
I just thought we'd go to McDonald's.

532
00:49:13,913 --> 00:49:16,499
- Goddammit! McDonald's again?!
- I work, too!

533
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:19,335
You're making out like
I have nothing to do all day!

534
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,839
That's what I told her! I said
you worked! She said we live like pigs!

535
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:29,220
She said that?

536
00:49:40,106 --> 00:49:42,900
Look, I don't wanna fight with you.

537
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,320
Well, I don't wanna fight either.

538
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:52,243
Wanna go to Gilley's tonight?

539
00:49:53,411 --> 00:49:55,454
No.

540
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:00,543
Come here. Come here.

541
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,841
<i>You mad at me? Hm?</i>

542
00:50:13,347 --> 00:50:16,976
Come on, let's go to Gilley's.
It'll make us feel better.

543
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:21,105
- OK.
- Go get dressed.

544
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:25,735
- Eat your tuna with the onions.
- Clean up, pig!

545
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:56,349
What the hell's he doin'
workin' the bull?

546
00:50:56,474 --> 00:51:00,311
- Steve gave him a job.
- How do you know that?

547
00:51:01,187 --> 00:51:04,315
- Jessie told me this afternoon.
- Sissy, come here!

548
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,484
See you.

549
00:51:08,027 --> 00:51:09,695
How are you doin'?

550
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,491
- I think you oughta ride.
- I can't. I got blisters on my ass.

551
00:51:13,616 --> 00:51:15,910
- Bud! How you feeling?
- All right.

552
00:51:16,035 --> 00:51:18,954
- How's that foot?
- It's my back that's killing me.

553
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:23,084
- You scared the dickens out of us, boy.
- I thought I was a goner.

554
00:51:23,209 --> 00:51:27,004
- I ain't no chickenshit.
- Well, get your ass up there.

555
00:51:27,922 --> 00:51:31,008
- Wes, what's it on?
- Eight. I'll turn it down.

556
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:33,177
OK. I'm gonna ride.

557
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:43,854
- Sure looks like he's feelin' good now.
- I'm on codeine. I don't feel a thing.

558
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,274
- Girl on the bull!
- At least she won't hurt her balls!

559
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,528
- There's gonna be a bull on a girl.
- Hear what they're sayin'?

560
00:51:50,653 --> 00:51:54,115
Look up there.
Bud, d'you recognise her?

561
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,200
Hey, Sissy! Get down from there!

562
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:58,661
- Bud, just watch, OK?
- [Bud] Right now!

563
00:51:58,786 --> 00:52:00,830
She knows what she's doin'.

564
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:08,629
Remember, keep your hand in the well.
Don't think about nothin' but the ride.

565
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:11,007
- [Jessie] Show 'em how to do it, girl.
- OK.

566
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:14,010
Turn that girl loose!

567
00:52:18,055 --> 00:52:20,725

We're down to the five finalists,
and let's get on with it.

1202
01:57:57,119 --> 01:58:00,623
Lloyd Smith, number 57.

1203
01:58:03,209 --> 01:58:06,754
Lloyd had a 75
on the first go-round, folks.

1204
01:58:06,879 --> 01:58:09,382
Let's move him out.
Are you ready, Lloyd?

1205
01:58:09,507 --> 01:58:11,550
Give him a ride, Sam.

1206
01:58:18,182 --> 01:58:20,226
Uh-oh!

1207
01:58:20,351 --> 01:58:22,395
All right.

1208
01:58:24,105 --> 01:58:28,609
Yeah. That's right. A lot of help
those fellows are.

1209
01:58:28,734 --> 01:58:31,278
Pam, would you put it on my butt?

1210
01:58:31,404 --> 01:58:35,950
Next contestant now is
number 114, Norman Tucker.

1211
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:42,206
All right, now, Norman had
a 75 on the first round.

1212
01:58:42,331 --> 01:58:45,668
Let's see what he can do
on this one. You ready, Norman?

1213
01:58:45,793 --> 01:58:47,837
Hit him, Sam!

1214
01:58:56,762 --> 01:58:58,681
<i>[horn]</i>

1215
01:58:58,806 --> 01:59:03,311
All right. Nice ride
by Norman Tucker there.

1216
01:59:03,436 --> 01:59:05,479
Well, let's get the score.

1217
01:59:07,898 --> 01:59:12,570
All right. Waitin' on the score. 77!

1218
01:59:12,695 --> 01:59:18,075
So we got a grand total there
of 152 for Norman Tucker.

1219
01:59:18,743 --> 01:59:24,540
All right, next rider up
is JR Fisk, number 144!

1220
01:59:36,761 --> 01:59:40,264
Nice try. Sorry,
but no cigar there, JR. All right!

1221
01:59:41,891 --> 01:59:45,102
All right, our next contestant:

1222

Wes Hightower, number 106.

1223
01:59:49,815 --> 01:59:51,651
<i>[booing]</i>

1224
01:59:55,529 --> 01:59:57,031
Can I use your pad?

1225
01:59:57,156 --> 02:00:02,620
Wes had a fine score of 81
on the first go-round.

1226
02:00:02,745 --> 02:00:04,789
All right.

1227
02:00:07,416 --> 02:00:09,627
Are you ready, Wes? Hit him, Sam.

1228

<i>[horn]</i>

1229
02:00:26,811 --> 02:00:28,854
A fine ride by Wes Hightower.

1230
02:00:32,191 --> 02:00:34,652
Let's take a look at Wes's score there.

1231
02:00:35,695 --> 02:00:37,697
An 80! All right! All right!

1232
02:00:37,822 --> 02:00:43,869
An 8O combined with an 81 gives
Wes Hightower a grand total of 161,

1233
02:00:43,995 --> 02:00:46,664
and that's the highest score
for this evening.

1234
02:00:46,789 --> 02:00:51,210
All right. We're down now
to our next and final contestant:

1235
02:00:51,335 --> 02:00:54,630
Bud Davis, number 87!

1236
02:01:02,805 --> 02:01:06,350
Bud had a 79 on his first go-round.
Are you ready, Bud?

1237
02:01:29,457 --> 02:01:31,417
- [horn]
- All right!

1238
02:01:31,542 --> 02:01:35,087
A super ride by Bud Davis, number 87.

1239
02:01:37,381 --> 02:01:39,550
Enjoy that, Bud?

1240
02:01:39,675 --> 02:01:42,845
All right. Now let's take a look
at that score there!

1241
02:01:42,970 --> 02:01:45,014
An 83!

1242
02:01:46,891 --> 02:01:50,144
An 83 combined with a 79

1243
02:01:50,269 --> 02:01:55,191
gives Bud Davis a grand total of 162!

1244
02:01:55,316 --> 02:01:59,278
And that makes Bud Davis
the winner of the $5,000!

1245
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:48,369
Pack your things.
We're leaving right now.

1246
02:02:48,494 --> 02:02:50,538
I ain't going to Mexico.

- Sissy, pack your things.
- I ain't going tonight, Wes.

- Pack it!
- No.

Leave the motor running.
I'll be right back.

1251
02:03:50,806 --> 02:03:53,976
Welcome! Good to have all you folks
at Gilley's annual rodeo.

1252
02:03:54,101 --> 02:03:58,731
At this time I would like to announce
the winners of all three big events.

1253
02:04:06,197 --> 02:04:10,701
First of all, I want to introduce
the judges of our dance contest.

1254
02:04:10,826 --> 02:04:12,870
Becky Tiller and the top DJ...

1255
02:04:12,995 --> 02:04:14,997
Do you think Sissy left?

1256
02:04:16,082 --> 02:04:19,335
I know she did.
She went out the side door.

1257
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:22,046
Shit! I wanted her to see this.

1258
02:04:22,171 --> 02:04:24,840
That would have been perfect. Perfect.

1259
02:04:29,971 --> 02:04:33,724
The punching-bag event,
the strong man of the bunch:

Aunt Corene alone too long.

to start this with me.

1278

Remember when you came back and
the trailer was clean, flowers around?

1279
02:05:48,549 --> 02:05:50,384
- Yep.
- I didn't do that.

1280
02:05:50,509 --> 02:05:52,803
Sissy did it. She was there.

1281
02:05:52,928 --> 02:05:55,222
She left you a note
asking you to phone her.

1282
02:05:55,348 --> 02:05:58,976
But I tore it up
cos I was sort of jealous.

1283
02:05:59,894 --> 02:06:02,396
I wanted to keep my cowboy.

1284

You don't love me, Bud.
And I don't really love you.

1285

Not like that.

1286
02:06:09,862 --> 02:06:12,114
So you shouldn't let her get away.

1287
02:06:15,368 --> 02:06:17,411
But I tell you what.

1288
