I'll get 'em
if you need 'em.

Not from anybody in this

You've got jurisdiction.

Nobody could.

On the way back, they hit
a town called bannock.

They drank their fill,
had their women,

on the table.

off the list.

Better come inside, Sam.

to the undertaker's

bounty hunter
or something?

101
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,534
He's dead.

102
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,100
How'd it happen?

103
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:14,634
Came up against
the wrong man.

104
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:16,367
I don't know
the details.

105
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:19,400
Marc was a good man
with a gun.

106
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:20,667
He was a big mouth

107
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:23,033
who thought he was
a good man with a gun.

108

There's a cold hole
in the ground
between the 2 of 'em.

110
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:30,667
I sent word.

111
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:34,767
I'll ride out there
in the morning.

112

How do you measure
this thing, cotton?

113

I think you got trouble,

Unless you say
he's all mistaken.

119

Tell Maddox I’m sorry,
really sorry,

120
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:59,334
and I’ll make it good.
I'll pay the damages.

121
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,734
I'll fix it up with
the old man's family.

Tell him I’ll make it
all right with him, too.

123

Better still, arrange
a meeting tomorrow.

124

I’ll... I’ll deal
straight with him.

125

If he doesn't
want to talk?

126
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:14,934
Why shouldn't he?

127
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,567
Some men just
go to a thing

128
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:18,400
in a straight line,
Mr. Bronson.

129
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:21,367
They don't bend,
and they don't trade.

130
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:23,901
You're telling me
Maddox is like that?

131
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:25,234
He's got the mark.

132
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,567
That's too bad.

133
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:31,634
Then he's going to buy
himself a lot of pain.

134
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:34,100
Try him, cotton.
Talk to him.

135
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:36,934
He got you spooked, Ryan?

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,501
No, Harv.
I'm not on his list.

That all, Mr. Bronson?

138
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,400
Yeah.

139
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:52,734
All right, Harv.
Chew it out.

140
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:56,534
I don't like
askin' favors.

141
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,100
No one's asking you

142
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:59,868
to bend your knee,
Harv.

143
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:01,701
Just to talk.

144
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,934
Some worn-out tin star

145
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,133
wouldn't rate
cuttin' your cigars.

146
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,901
Ryan doesn't
rate him that low.

147
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:10,033
Ryan's a kicked dog.

148
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,901
Well, maybe that's
what makes him

149
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:13,834
a better judge of men
like Maddox.

150
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,634
There was a time...

151
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,501
it's in the past,
Harv.

152
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,100
What do you want to do,

153
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,167
ride into Sabbath
and gun him down?

154
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,701
Those days have passed.

155
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:27,300
Times have changed.

156
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:30,167
There are other ways.
You buy him.

157
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:33,667
And if he doesn't sell,
you buy the man above him.

158
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:36,968
Those killing days
were for younger men.

159
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm on that list,
Vince.

160
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:42,467
I'm not ridin' his dust
back to bannock.

161
00:13:42,534 --> 00:13:45,367
Neither am I.

162
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:47,000
The others
will be here soon.

163
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:49,501
I'd send
Jason and Crowe.

164
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,634
We'll talk then.

165
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:54,868
We don't need
the others.

166
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,601

But you're like some
yellow, dumb ladino...

all longhorn
and no brains.

330

We've got 10,000 head
of good cows,

a valley of sweet grass,
and money in the bank.

332
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:02,033
That didn't come easy.

333
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,701
We both us put 30 years
of sweat into it.

334

I don't like to see you
backing off, Vince.

337
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:17,934
You're making a mistake.

338
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,701
I don't see it that way.

339
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:24,300
Ride into Sabbath
in the morning, see Ryan.

340

Hear how he made out.
I want to step around this.

341
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:32,567
If Maddox is open, tell Ryan
to set up a meeting.

342
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:34,434
Send Jason.

343
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:37,267
I'm asking you.

344
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:39,968
Keep clear of Maddox.

345
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:41,767
Take Crowe with you.

Talk?

He wants to trade.

360

He says he's sorry.

just an accident.

out here, Crowe?

the same age, aren't you?

No, sir. I figured
it was private.

On this high ground,

from the sierras
to white wolf pass.

Now, there was the old
Comanche camp. We...

I figured you'd be

484
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,501
Well, I’m afraid that I would
need written permission

485
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:46,834
before I could allow you
to examine such documents.

486

Sir! I shall call
the marshal.

You do that.

00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:07,334
Thank you, Mr. Dusaine.

489
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:42,067
[Harvey]
Don't try to
soften me up, cotton.

490
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,734
Doesn't your lawman
want to talk?

491
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:46,634
Take it easy, Harvey.

492
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:48,100
Yes or no?

493
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,167
Why do you want
to push things

494
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:50,601
until they break,
Stenbaugh?

495
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:51,868
Let Bronson handle it.

496
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:53,133
You gonna
mealy-mouth,

497
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,801
or are you
gonna tell me?

498
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:56,267
He won't trade.

499
00:31:56,334 --> 00:31:59,467
You can have your say
in bannock.

500
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:02,434
Did you crawl, Ryan?

501
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,601
I wasn't asked to.

502
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:08,033
I told Vince you weren't
the man to carry this.

503
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,567
Where is Maddox?

504
00:32:09,634 --> 00:32:11,033
Climb down, Harvey.

505
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,734
You can't ride this man.

506
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:14,901
Run to hell, why don't you?

507
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,767
Maddox?

508
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,501
I'm Harv Stenbaugh.

509
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:47,834
Well, lawman?

510
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:49,133
What's your name, son?

511
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,634
Crowe wheelwright.

512
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:52,701
I've no business with you.

513
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:55,434
You've got business with me.

514
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:57,100
Drop that
gun belt.

515
00:32:57,167 --> 00:33:00,434
I'm taking
you in.

516
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:02,234
No, you're not.

517
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,634
You got 2 ways
to move, lawman.

518
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:06,300
Run...

519
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:07,734
or take me.

520

[Gunshot]

521
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:26,033
[Horse neighs]

522
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,234
Don't make me kill you, son.

523
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,767
What are you gonna
do about this?

524
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:55,200
He's shooting 'em
down in the street.

525
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:26,467
[Harris]
You all know
why you're here.

526
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:29,868
What I want to know is
what are we gonna do?

527
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,133
He wants to know what
we're going to do.

528
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,567
Marc Corman
and Harvey Stenbaugh
were our friends.

529
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:38,167
Do we care about
our friends?

530
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:41,234
Corman's widow, my sister,
and the little ones,

531
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,167
do we care about them?

532
00:34:43,234 --> 00:34:46,267
Are we just gonna stand
around here and talk?

533
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:50,667
Talk never moved a thing
or pulled a stump.

534
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:52,334
Are we gonna stand
around and wait

535
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,567
while this killer
shoots down

536
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,234
whoever he wants
in our town?

537
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,901
He's a lawman.

538
00:34:57,968 --> 00:34:59,400
What? What?

539
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:01,000
How do we
know that?

540
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:03,400
Anyway, he ain't
the lawman here.

541
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,334
What happened
in bannock months ago

542
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,067
is of no concern
to us,

543
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:09,701
but we must respect
the law.

544
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:13,701
As your mayor, I say we
gotta protect our own.

545
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:16,234
This man has got
to be stopped.

546
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,634
What you got
in mind,
Harris?

547
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:21,167
We all go over to
the hotel, all of us,

548
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:22,868
and we go
meaning business,

549
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,234
and that means
going armed.

550
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,400
And we can tell Maddox
to get out of town.

551
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:30,667
Now, now,
wait a minute, Luther.

552
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:33,234
That sounds
like vigilante talk.

553
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,133
Shouldn't we stay
within the limits of...

554
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,033
Sam, Sam. It seems to me
that you, as mayor,

555
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,367
should be giving lead,
you know,

556
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:44,534
not trying to keep
your head on straight.

557
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:47,400
This town owes
Vince Bronson a lot.

558
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:49,801
Legally speaking,
there is a precedent

559
00:35:49,868 --> 00:35:52,100
for forming
a citizens committee.

560
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,167
Only if there's
been a breakdown

561
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:56,334
in the formal
law services.

562
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Well, Ryan is
broken down enough

563
00:35:58,467 --> 00:35:59,934
to satisfy
any precedent.

564
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,334
Moss is right,
you know.

565
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,968
We're all beholding
to Bronson,

566
00:36:04,033 --> 00:36:05,801
and a Bronson man
was murdered.

567
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:09,400
Now, we can talk till sundown
and accomplish nothing,

568
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,267
or we can act.

569
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:14,200
Now, I say that we
call off this meeting

570
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:16,267
and do what we know
is right.

571
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:18,000
Now, Luther,
let's...

572
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:20,667
anybody here who calls himself
a man who wants out

573
00:36:20,734 --> 00:36:26,868
better speak right now.

574
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,934
Anybody?

575
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,334
Well, then I think we got
our work cut out for us.

576
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,667
Oh, dear.

577
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:48,434
You know what that man
meant to me?

578
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:51,968
I held him
above all other men.

579
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:54,801
Closer even
than my brothers.

580
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:58,033
I want him, Ryan.

581
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,801
I want him broken.

582
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:03,767
I want his face
in the dirt.

583
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:05,667
And I’ll hang
what's left of him

584
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:07,434
hang him for
the murderer he is.

585
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,934
I don't care how.
I don't care who,

586
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,634
so long as I’m there
to see it.

587
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:15,901
It wasn't murder,
Mr. Bronson.

588
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:17,701
I call it murder.

589
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:18,801
I was on the prod...

590
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:22,000
I call it murder...

591
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:26,267
and I want something
done about it.

592
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:29,234
The great cotton Ryan,

593
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,000
you were good
with a gun once.

594
00:37:31,067 --> 00:37:34,067
Oh, you were beautiful.

595
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:36,267
But fort bliss
was a long time ago,

596
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:41,667
wasn't it, Ryan?

597
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:45,100
I don't like men
sweating fear in my house.

598
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:49,434
You pay me, Mr. Bronson,
and I eat your dirt.

599
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:53,033
But that don't make
what you say right.

600
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,000
Get out.

601
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:56,467
When I’m finished,
Mr. Bronson.

602
00:37:56,534 --> 00:38:01,567
Leave him.

603
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:04,934
Harvey was on the prod.
He went after Maddox.

604
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,934
He put the horn in him,

605
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,067
and then he made
his move first.

606
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:09,734
Don't make the same mistake,
Mr. Bronson.

607
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:12,567
Don't go to a man
like Maddox with a hammer.

608
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:14,434
You want him.
I understand that.

609
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,467
I figured that
was your play.

610
00:38:16,534 --> 00:38:19,601
But finish that thing
in bannock first.

611
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:22,534
Go back there.

612
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:25,734
You can buy
the whole town...

613
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:31,300
and the judge
that goes with it.

614
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:33,667
Ryan...

615
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:35,067
I’m sorry.

616
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:45,834
We'll get Maddox.

617
00:38:45,901 --> 00:38:48,868
Yes...

618
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:53,100
we'll get Maddox.

619
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,534
My heart isn't in it.

620
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:59,734
God's my witness, Jace,
I wanted no more killing.

621
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:01,534
I could've bought
that town with a whisper.

622
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:04,400
Ryan's right.

623
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,868
But not now.

624
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:09,734
Harvey's death
finished any chance

625
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:15,067
of doing it
without guns.

626
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:20,167
Damn you, Harvey.

627
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:21,567
He's in
the saloon.

628
00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:22,434
Who is?

629
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:23,467
Let's go.

630
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:54,968
Which one has the words?

631
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:56,567
You're the
storekeeper.

632
00:39:56,634 --> 00:39:59,467
Luther Harris,
ain't it?

633
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:02,434
Let me say
them for you.

634
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,467
You want me
out of your town.

635
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:05,701
What happened
some other time,

636
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:07,968
some other place
ain't your trouble.

637
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:10,901
I've seen men like you
in every town in the west.

638
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:12,801
You want the law, but you
want it to walk quiet.

639
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:17,067
You don't want it to put
a hole in your pocket.

640
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:19,334
You take courage from
each other, and you come armed.

641

# [piano discord]

642
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,234
Well, there
are enough
of you.

643
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:30,534
All you need is one man with
enough stomach to die first.

644
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:36,067
I'm not leaving until
what I came for is done.

645
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,734
So if you plan
to do anything about it,

646
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:38,801
do it now or go home.

647
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:08,167
How much?

648
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:09,133
For the meal.

2 bits.

650
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,033
Jesus, I thought
for sure they...

651
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:21,367
#  I’m thinking
of sweet lena fair # 

652
00:41:21,434 --> 00:41:23,667
#  with deep blue eyes
and corncob hair # 

653
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:24,934
#  her voice... # 

654
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,934
good evening,

655
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,400
Lucas.

656
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:34,367
Cards?

657
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:36,100
A dollar a point?

658
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:39,334
You know I can't run
that high, Lucas.

659
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,033
You got my note for more
than I can ever pay,

660
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,968
and still
you want to play.

661
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,167
I'm not calling in
your note.

662
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,067
I'm not a great believer
in the milk of human kindness.

663
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:57,701
You got a rope on the man
who owes you.

664
00:41:57,767 --> 00:41:58,968
Hit me.

665
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:10,300
Yours.

666
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,567
You got a weight
on your back, cotton.

667
00:42:12,634 --> 00:42:14,567
Is that the gossip?

668
00:42:14,634 --> 00:42:16,667
I've heard.

669
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:17,868
Besides,

670
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:20,334
you've been here
last night and tonight.

671
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,067
Now, you're not
an indulging man.

672
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:24,567
Call.

673
00:42:24,634 --> 00:42:26,868
A man's pleasure
talks a lot.

674
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:28,968
Now, ain't
that pretty?

675
00:42:29,033 --> 00:42:33,367
Hit me.

676
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:36,634
May I be of service,
cotton?

677
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:39,000
I got me a mess, Lucas.

678
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:42,767
And I haven't got enough
long boot to step out of it.

679
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:44,100
Let's play cards.

680
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:49,601
Well, cottontail Ryan.

681
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,801
Cottontail Ryan.

682
00:42:52,868 --> 00:42:54,467
You wanted something,
Dekker?

683
00:42:54,534 --> 00:42:55,934
Yeah,
I want something.

684
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,100
I want some more of
your cheap whiskey.

685
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:01,901
Service in your
place stinks.

686
00:43:01,968 --> 00:43:06,200
And you're a damn fool
to come here.

687
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:10,300
He smells of trouble.

688
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:11,868

I'm calling you out,

We've no quarrel, Crowe.

I'm gonna kill you,

fight you, boy.

I don't plan on
dying for no reason.

697
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,534

You cheap little gunslinger.

00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,400
You set me up.

00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:11,834
So help me god.

703
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:13,701
Go on for your gun.
You want a chance?

704
00:45:13,767 --> 00:45:14,801
Go ahead.

705
00:45:14,868 --> 00:45:15,734
I don't know nothing
about those shots.

706
00:45:15,801 --> 00:45:16,968
Go for your gun.

707
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:19,701
I wouldn't do something
like that. Believe me!

708
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:22,000
It came from
over there.

709
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:26,667

Next time I see you,
I’ll kill you.

725
00:47:30,534 --> 00:47:33,601
God knows I got reason enough
to want to see you dead,

726
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,767
but I hate back shooters.

727

If you've got nowhere
important to go,

728
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:43,534
I got a bottle
in that desk.

729
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:45,367
Dekker's on your list.

730
00:47:45,434 --> 00:47:46,534
He a Bronson hand?

731
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:50,200
Yeah. Stays close
to Choctaw Lee.

732
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,334
Choctaw's a gun hand,

733
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,234
fast and likes
his work.

734
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,367
Dekker's
a shadow walker.

735
00:47:54,434 --> 00:47:55,834
He walks big when
he's with Choctaw,

736
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:58,434
but a back shooter
inside.

737
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,167
I knew it'd be him.

738
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:01,634
I saw him in town
earlier.

739
00:48:01,701 --> 00:48:04,167
Thanks, Ryan.

I owe you
something, too.

Everybody remembers me
at fort bliss.

745

That's all I got,
Maddox,

746
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:23,834
a bunch of yesterdays.

747
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,701
It's a long ride down
from the high country

748
00:48:25,767 --> 00:48:28,634
with stops
all the way down.

749
00:48:28,701 --> 00:48:30,133
In Abilene, I ran.

750
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,901
In Acadia city,
I hid in a cellar.

751
00:48:32,968 --> 00:48:34,133
In Monmouth,

752
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,167
the Loring brothers
made me eat dirt.

753
00:48:37,234 --> 00:48:40,234
What keeps pushing you?

754
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,367
I've been a lawman
for 20 years.

755
00:48:42,434 --> 00:48:46,234
What stops you
running sand inside?

756
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,467
I guess the question
doesn't arise.

757
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:49,801
You know, after
killing Stenbaugh,

758
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:53,200
Bronson will come
for you.

759
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:56,267
It's always the same.

760
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:57,467
You post a man,

761
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,434
he has to come into town
to prove he's a man.

762
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:02,400
You kill a man, he's got
a friend or a kin,

763
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:04,834
just has to come
against you.

764
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,868
And for no reason...

765
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:08,567
no reason
that makes any sense.

766
00:49:08,634 --> 00:49:09,767
And it don't matter
a damn

767
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:12,767
to the man
already in the ground.

768
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:16,033
Nobody wins.

769
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,834
You can stop it.

770
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:19,968
Ride out tomorrow.

771
00:49:20,033 --> 00:49:22,100
It's not a private matter
with me, cotton.

772
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,100
The law.

773
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:27,200
The honest ones carry it hard
and clean all their lives.

774
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:30,100
Behind their backs,
the others buy it, sell it,

775
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:33,434
dirty it,
tie it into knots.

776
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:36,067
Who lives longer,
Maddox?

777
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:37,167
I was out
bringing in a killer

778
00:49:37,234 --> 00:49:39,000
when the shoot-up
happened.

779
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:40,100
I could have chased
a few tracks

780
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:42,167
and let the
matter drop.

781
00:49:42,234 --> 00:49:44,267
But I’m the law
in bannock.

782
00:49:44,334 --> 00:49:45,567
Anybody who goes
against the law

783
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:47,200
goes against me.

784
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:49,467
I don't know
any other way.

785
00:49:49,534 --> 00:49:52,000
How many more
for one old man?

786
00:49:52,067 --> 00:49:54,567
I don't call
the numbers.

787
00:49:54,634 --> 00:49:56,968
Ryan, I never drew first
on a man in my life.

788
00:49:57,033 --> 00:49:58,501
That's the only way
to stay clean.

789
00:49:58,567 --> 00:49:59,634
You play it
by the rules.

790
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:01,567
Without the rules,
you're nothing.

791
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:02,868
Bronson won't
come alone.

792
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:04,734
I didn't figure
he would.

793
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:06,701
You think he sent Dekker.
He didn't.

794
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:09,167
Well, I don't know
that. Do you?

795
00:50:09,234 --> 00:50:12,167
I know Bronson.

796
00:50:12,234 --> 00:50:14,334
Either way,
it don't matter.

797
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,767

798

[Dekker]
Let me go, cotton.

799
00:50:21,934 --> 00:50:23,767
Let me go.

800
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:25,868
What's the matter
with you, Ryan?

801
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:27,667
Let me out of here!

802
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:29,501
You're through, Ryan.

803
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:32,234
Bronson's gonna walk you
into the ground.

804
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:38,667
You're all through,
cottontail.

805
00:50:38,734 --> 00:50:41,200
Calculate you got about
10 minutes, back shooter.

806
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:42,968
It'll take me 5
to get to Maddox,

807
00:50:43,033 --> 00:50:45,133
and Maddox 5
to get saddled.

808
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,334
I think he'd appreciate
a little hunting.

809
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,467
Or I can gun you down
trying to escape...

810
00:50:50,534 --> 00:50:53,701
in the back.

811
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:54,901
You won't be so...

812
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:58,901
back shooter,
anytime you want out...

813
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:00,400
you just call.

814
00:51:14,534 --> 00:51:16,067
Hold on, Crowe.

815
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:17,334
You look like
you got your teeth

816
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,167
set on edge, boy.
Now move!

817
00:51:21,234 --> 00:51:23,033
I didn't know nothing
about Dekker.

818
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,634
You don't even
interest me, Crowe.

819
00:51:24,701 --> 00:51:25,534
Where's your horse?

820
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:26,534
Tied up behind
the stables.

821
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:28,067
All right.
Let's go.

822
00:51:28,133 --> 00:51:29,567
Listen to me, Ryan.

823
00:51:29,634 --> 00:51:31,934
I didn't know about Dekker.
You ask him.

824
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,501
Well, Maddox called my name
down in front of everybody.

825
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:35,634
I ain't afraid
of him, Ryan.

826
00:51:35,701 --> 00:51:36,801
You would be

827
00:51:36,868 --> 00:51:39,200
if you had brains
enough to spit.

828
00:51:39,267 --> 00:51:41,100
Well, I figure
I’m faster than him.

829
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:42,868
Keep walking.

830
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:44,234
In every town
Maddox has worked,

831
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,100
the ground is full
of men who were faster.

832
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:47,968
Yeah. Well, I really am.
I aim to prove it, too.

833
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:49,901
It makes
a great epitaph.

834
00:51:49,968 --> 00:51:51,067
You may be faster.

835
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:52,334
You may even be
better with a gun,

836
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,767
but Maddox
will kill you.

837
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:55,601
And that's a fact.

838
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:57,067
You'd be staring up
at nothing

839
00:51:57,133 --> 00:51:59,501
before your gun
even got clear.

840
00:51:59,567 --> 00:52:01,968
I know what I’m
talking about, Crowe.

841
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:03,334
You might not
rate me very high,

842
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,834
but I know men
like Maddox.

843
00:52:26,534 --> 00:52:29,267
You'd drive a man to hell,
wouldn't you, Jered?

844
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:31,400
Hello, Lucas.

845
00:52:31,467 --> 00:52:32,667
Whose day for
choosing is it,

846
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:34,501
Price or Adams?

847
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:36,234
You know this Adams?

848
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,534
I know him.

849
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:39,601
What kind is he?

850
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:41,234
I wouldn't know.

851
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,200
But I know what you're
doing is wrong, Maddox.

852
00:52:44,267 --> 00:52:46,434
You were wrong
in san Acoma,

853
00:52:46,501 --> 00:52:48,000
and you're
wrong here.

854
00:52:48,067 --> 00:52:50,367
Not from where
I stand.

855
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:52,734
You can't see
from where you stand.

856
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,767
I didn't want
to wake you.

857
00:53:09,834 --> 00:53:11,567
Where were you?

858
00:53:11,634 --> 00:53:13,601
Over at
Vern’s place.

859
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:15,300
Sorry.

860
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:17,267
Where are you going?

861
00:53:17,334 --> 00:53:18,868
Go back to bed, Laura.

862
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:21,801
Where are you going, Hurd?
I want to know.

863
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:24,400
Go back to bed,
will you, please?

864
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,334
You're running,
aren't you, Hurd?

865
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,133
Do you have to, Laura?

866
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,000
No, I don't have to.

867
00:53:31,067 --> 00:53:32,434
Damn you!

868
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,734
Always got to push
my face in it,
don't you?

869
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:36,801
You and this
god-cursed land.

870
00:53:36,868 --> 00:53:37,934
Yes, I’m running!

871
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,200
Does that make you
happier?

872
00:53:39,267 --> 00:53:44,667
You said you'd
give yourself up.

873
00:53:44,734 --> 00:53:46,801
Well, that was before
Harv was killed.

874
00:53:46,868 --> 00:53:48,968
I'm talking
about you, Hurd.

875
00:53:49,033 --> 00:53:50,901
I don't care about
Harvey Stenbaugh.

876
00:53:50,968 --> 00:53:53,067
He doesn't make
any difference.

877
00:53:53,133 --> 00:53:54,934
Harv Stenbaugh
was my friend.

878
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,467
You hated him.

879
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:57,767
You were
frightened of him,

880
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,300
and he never cared
about anything

881
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:04,667
unless it had the
Bronson name to it.

882
00:54:04,734 --> 00:54:08,767
You lying bitch!

883
00:54:08,834 --> 00:54:10,200
You are a nobody,

884
00:54:10,267 --> 00:54:12,601
just a little nobody
to them.

885
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:14,801
I owe Vince
everything I’ve got.

886
00:54:14,868 --> 00:54:16,501
You owe him what?

887
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:18,934
This piece of dirt
that wouldn't grow wheat.

888
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,467
And what do you
owe Harvey?

889
00:54:20,534 --> 00:54:22,434
He kept you on your knees
saying thank you.

890
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:25,267
Hurd, they just don't care.

891
00:54:25,334 --> 00:54:28,434
But you do.

892
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:30,167
Yes.

893
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:32,501
That's not what I see
every time I look at you.

894
00:54:32,567 --> 00:54:34,033
You know what I see?

895
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,267
I see, "you're not much,
Hurd Price."

896
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:39,434
No, not a man, like
all the men you've known.

897
00:54:46,434 --> 00:54:50,400
I didn't mean that.

898
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:54,467
Yes, you did.

899
00:54:54,534 --> 00:54:58,367
And maybe you're right.

900
00:54:58,434 --> 00:55:02,701
Maybe that is
what's in my face...

901
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,968
I don't think so.

902
00:55:05,033 --> 00:55:07,200
I've tried, Hurd.

903
00:55:07,267 --> 00:55:10,167
And I don't want
to see you dead.

904
00:55:10,234 --> 00:55:13,334
I can't go in alone,
Laura.

905
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,167
The others won't
go in now...

906
00:55:15,234 --> 00:55:17,868
not to surrender.

907
00:55:17,934 --> 00:55:20,534
Here's Vern.

908
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:25,167
But Maddox promised nothing
would happen to you.

909
00:55:25,234 --> 00:55:31,801
What did you
promise him?

910
00:55:31,868 --> 00:55:33,334
I'll be back.

911
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:42,100
[Cocks rifle]

912
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:43,334
[Maddox]
When you turn around,

913
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,934
keep your arms
straight out from the body.

914
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,434
I told you the next time
I saw you, I’d kill you.

915
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:53,400
I knew nothing
about Dekker.

916
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:54,601
So you said.

917
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:57,167
It's true.

918
00:56:57,234 --> 00:57:02,734
I just wanted you
to know.

919
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:04,334
You ride for Bronson?

920
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,234
Yeah,
I ride for him.

921
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,868
Does he send
you out to do
his killing?

922
00:57:08,934 --> 00:57:10,968
No. And he didn't
send me out here

923
00:57:11,033 --> 00:57:12,300
this morning,
neither.

924
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:14,133
You just took it
upon yourself.

925
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,067
What for,
a pat on the head?

926
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:17,801
You killed
Harvey Stenbaugh.

927
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:19,734
You got a bad memory, son.

928
00:57:19,801 --> 00:57:21,834
Stenbaugh had it
in mind to kill me.

929
00:57:21,901 --> 00:57:24,100
He didn't have a chance.

930
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:26,667
You don't even care,
do you, Maddox?

931
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:27,834
No.

932
00:57:27,901 --> 00:57:30,200
No, I don't care.

933
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:32,767
You say he didn't
have a chance.

934
00:57:32,834 --> 00:57:34,400
He went for
his gun first.

935
00:57:34,467 --> 00:57:35,434
When he does that,

936
00:57:35,501 --> 00:57:37,701
he uses up
all his chances.

937
00:57:37,767 --> 00:57:39,200
Do I have to keep
my arms up here...

938
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:42,701
till I say different.

939
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:44,801
You liked Stenbaugh?

940
00:57:44,868 --> 00:57:46,067
Well, then
I’m sorry, Crowe,

941
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:47,934
but he had
a lot of chances.

942
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,067
He didn't have to come
into town that morning.

943
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,434
He didn't have
to cross the street

944
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:52,801
and push it
to a shooting.

945
00:57:52,868 --> 00:57:54,334
He could've
given himself up.

946
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,868
You wouldn't have
done no different.

947
00:57:55,934 --> 00:57:57,167
You're wrong.

948
00:57:57,234 --> 00:58:00,868
I wouldn't put living
down on cheap pride.

949
00:58:00,934 --> 00:58:06,701
You can drop
your arms.

950
00:58:06,767 --> 00:58:09,534
Still planning on
trying to kill me?

951
00:58:09,601 --> 00:58:11,033
I don't know.

952
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,300
But I ain't
afraid of you.

953
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:15,501
I never said you were.

954
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:17,901
Any fish in that stream?

955
00:58:17,968 --> 00:58:20,734
Some natives
and some bullheads.

956
00:58:20,801 --> 00:58:21,868
Hungry?

957
00:58:21,934 --> 00:58:23,267
I didn't come out here...

958
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:27,334
having breakfast
ain't gonna make
us friends.

959
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,267
You got another line?

960
00:58:29,334 --> 00:58:30,968
In the saddlebag.

961
00:58:42,234 --> 00:58:44,234
Ryan thinks
you're pretty good.

962
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,400
Says you could've killed me
any time you wanted to.

963
00:58:47,467 --> 00:58:49,701
I say different.

964
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:52,400
I think I’m faster.

965
00:58:52,467 --> 00:58:53,801
You asking me
who's faster

966
00:58:53,868 --> 00:58:56,100
or whether I could
kill you if I chose to?

967
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,601
Because
if it's the second,

968
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,067
the answer is yes.

969
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:06,000
You're pretty damn sure.

970
00:59:06,067 --> 00:59:08,734
I'm pretty damn sure.

971
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:11,100
You think it's a game,
don't you?

972
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:17,033
A contest
between gentlemen.

973

01:13:10,834 --> 01:13:13,801
to be tested by life...

1134
01:13:13,868 --> 01:13:17,200
to be confused by passion...

1135
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:21,234
to be tempted
and brought down by evil...

1136
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,067
to seek for the light
that the soul knows

1137
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,234
and never turns away from,

1138
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,534
and then to return
from whence he came...

1139
01:13:28,601 --> 01:13:31,367
again, alone,

1140
01:13:31,434 --> 01:13:33,267
to stand in awed finality

1141
01:13:33,334 --> 01:13:34,801
before thy gaze

1142
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:36,868
and give account.

1143
01:13:36,934 --> 01:13:39,701
Such is man's destiny,

1144
01:13:39,767 --> 01:13:42,434
and from the hardness
comes forth a purity

1145
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,234
that soft men
can never find.

1146
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,868
Such a man was this,
our brother,

1147
01:13:48,934 --> 01:13:51,200
who now we bury here.

1148
01:13:51,267 --> 01:13:52,100
Amen.

1149
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:55,100
[All]
Amen.

1150
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:56,868
[Minister]
Now let us each man

1151
01:13:56,934 --> 01:14:02,934
unto his own god pray.

1152
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,934
And now let us sing
unto the lord.

1153
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,434
[All]
#  a mighty fortress

1154
01:14:09,501 --> 01:14:12,234
#  is our god

1155
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:17,067
#  a bulwark
never failing # 

1156
01:14:17,133 --> 01:14:18,801
we should've gone
together, Harv.

1157
01:14:18,868 --> 01:14:22,868
#  our helper,
he amid... # 

1158
01:14:34,234 --> 01:14:36,100
[dog barking]

1159
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:37,701
Hush!

1160
01:14:44,534 --> 01:14:47,200
He's not here.
I'm alone. He's run.

1161
01:14:47,267 --> 01:14:49,601
Got a prisoner here
needs a bit of care.

1162
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:51,334
Got a hole in him.

1163
01:14:57,501 --> 01:14:59,901
Vern, where's Hurd?

1164
01:14:59,968 --> 01:15:01,767
He's run free,
Laura.

1165
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:09,667
Can you get
the bullet out?

1166
01:15:09,734 --> 01:15:10,901
Not if I want
to kill him.

1167
01:15:10,968 --> 01:15:13,334
It'll have to be cut out
through the back.

1168
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:20,567
Oh, gosh!

1169
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:28,234
We can put him
in the bed.

1170
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,901
He goes outside.

1171
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,634
Get up.

1172
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:42,133
He's hurt bad.

1173
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,133
Someday I’ll get a second
chance at you, Maddox,

1174
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,400
and I won't miss.

1175
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:47,133
Don't push it, Adams.

1176
01:15:53,067 --> 01:15:59,434
I've got some food
warming.

1177
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:01,834
How do you like
the Price farm?

1178
01:16:01,901 --> 01:16:03,534
Over there
we grow corn...

1179
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:05,300
for the weevils,

1180
01:16:05,367 --> 01:16:06,701
and out in back,
the potatoes

1181
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:09,868
fried black in the ground
from the sun.

1182
01:16:09,934 --> 01:16:11,701
We do own
a few head of stock

1183
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:16,534
to keep the Borefly
happy and the crows.

1184
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:17,868
It's not much,
but I guess

1185
01:16:17,934 --> 01:16:21,033
it's more than
you got, Jered.

1186
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,400
You married
to this Price fella?

1187
01:16:23,467 --> 01:16:26,501
No preachers
and no flowers...

1188
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:30,801
but I’m his woman,
Jered.

1189
01:16:30,868 --> 01:16:33,000
That food
will be done now.

1190
01:16:41,334 --> 01:16:43,434
Does he have to stay
out there all night?

1191
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:45,934
He does.

1192
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,801
You haven't
changed much.

1193
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:52,234
Not much.

1194
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:55,000
I hear canyon city's
a ghost town.

1195
01:16:55,067 --> 01:16:58,667
Digging's dried up.

1196
01:16:58,734 --> 01:17:00,901
The "golden promise."

1197
01:17:00,968 --> 01:17:04,033
Well, it had a good run
for its money.

1198
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,200
Remember Bucky?

1199
01:17:06,267 --> 01:17:08,000
Where's Bucky now?

1200
01:17:08,067 --> 01:17:10,367
He's dead.
Charlottesville.

1201
01:17:10,434 --> 01:17:12,767
Somebody named
Yancey, I heard.

1202
01:17:12,834 --> 01:17:13,968
Buck tried to
take him in,

1203
01:17:14,033 --> 01:17:17,300
gave him too much
edge, I guess.

1204
01:17:17,367 --> 01:17:20,601
And Joe Wilmot?

1205
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:23,067
Him, too.
Shot in the back.

1206
01:17:23,133 --> 01:17:24,434
Ben Tilson...

1207
01:17:24,501 --> 01:17:25,701
Luther Thompson...

1208
01:17:25,767 --> 01:17:27,367
bill Chrysler...

1209
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,567
all gone.

1210
01:17:29,634 --> 01:17:31,734
Jack horn will
never walk again.

1211
01:17:31,801 --> 01:17:35,934
I'm sorry, Jered.

1212
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,133
A lot of candles
to light.

1213
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,200
Can I... take
something out to Vern?

1214
01:17:43,267 --> 01:17:44,167
Go ahead.

1215
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:54,767
Get me something to
cut loose from these irons

1216
01:17:54,834 --> 01:17:56,667
and a gun
if you've got one.

1217
01:17:56,734 --> 01:17:58,667
Please, Laura!

1218
01:17:58,734 --> 01:18:00,200
No, Vern,
he'll kill you.

1219
01:18:00,267 --> 01:18:01,667
No, he'll go
after Hurd next,

1220
01:18:01,734 --> 01:18:03,300
maybe kill him.

1221
01:18:03,367 --> 01:18:04,801
Now, with a gun and
him not expecting it,

1222
01:18:04,868 --> 01:18:07,234
I could stop him.

1223
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,934
Eat your food.

1224
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,133
I'll get you
another blanket.

1225
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,868
[Coyote howling]

1226
01:18:18,934 --> 01:18:20,334
Promise me
that you won't try

1227
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,868
to kill Maddox,

1228
01:18:21,934 --> 01:18:24,067
that you'll just go.

1229
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:25,434
He'd come after me.

1230
01:18:32,634 --> 01:18:35,801
It turned colder. Can I
take him another blanket?

1231
01:18:47,868 --> 01:18:51,167
Laura...

1232
01:18:51,234 --> 01:18:52,534
thanks for supper.

1233
01:19:05,067 --> 01:19:07,367
Promise me, Vern,
that you'll go.

1234
01:19:07,434 --> 01:19:08,968
Just go.

1235
01:19:09,033 --> 01:19:12,067
I got
no more run in me.

1236
01:19:12,133 --> 01:19:13,534
If you get me a gun,
I have more than

1237
01:19:13,601 --> 01:19:15,567
a better chance
to get him.

1238
01:19:15,634 --> 01:19:18,300
He'll check me again
before he beds down.

1239
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:22,367
He won't expect
nothing.

1240
01:19:22,434 --> 01:19:24,033
You've got to!

1241
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,200
I was gonna
give it to him.

1242
01:19:53,634 --> 01:19:54,634
Do you want to know why

1243
01:19:54,701 --> 01:19:56,367
I was gonna
give him the gun?

1244
01:19:56,434 --> 01:19:59,033
He's hurt,
he's a friend...

1245
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,834
there are a lot
of reasons.

1246
01:20:00,901 --> 01:20:03,434
I wanted to
because of you.

1247
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:05,601
Because there's nothing
soft in you, Jered,

1248
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:07,200
there's nothing forgiving.

1249
01:20:07,267 --> 01:20:09,000
Even this damn land
doesn't hold a man down

1250
01:20:09,067 --> 01:20:12,400
as hard as you do.

1251
01:20:12,467 --> 01:20:16,067
What made you
change your mind?

1252
01:20:16,133 --> 01:20:19,200
It wouldn't make
any difference.

1253
01:20:19,267 --> 01:20:20,667
You'd kill him
or go after him,

1254
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:23,567
or he'd kill you.

1255

[Horse neighs]

1256
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:28,100
I didn't want that.

The sword of Gideon.

1259
01:20:36,033 --> 01:20:39,300
How do you see yourself,
Jered?

1260
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:41,534
What are you
asking, girl?

1261
01:20:41,601 --> 01:20:42,868
For me to let
Adams go?

1262
01:20:42,934 --> 01:20:44,868
Forget about Price,
Bronson and the rest?

1263
01:20:44,934 --> 01:20:46,033
Would that be
so terrible?

1264
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,267
You know
I can't do that.

1265
01:20:47,334 --> 01:20:49,267
You hold
the law too high.

1266
01:20:49,334 --> 01:20:51,701
You always did.

1267
01:20:51,767 --> 01:20:53,167
Would it really
make any difference

1268
01:20:53,234 --> 01:20:54,367
if just once...

1269
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:56,100
you can't play with
it like that, Laura.

1270
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:58,567
There is no
"just once."

1271
01:20:58,634 --> 01:21:00,868
Next time
it might be a friend...

1272
01:21:00,934 --> 01:21:02,901
or money in your hand...

1273
01:21:02,968 --> 01:21:05,200
or maybe you get scared...

1274
01:21:05,267 --> 01:21:08,133
and then it becomes one more
"just once."

1275
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,434
Soon you don't know
who you are.

1276
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:12,734
You can't break
the rules, Laura.

1277
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,467
Oh...

1278
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:17,901
the rules...

1279
01:21:17,968 --> 01:21:21,667
I forgot
about the rules.

1280
01:21:21,734 --> 01:21:23,968
You think they
change the killing.

1281
01:21:24,033 --> 01:21:26,067
Because you never
draw on a man first,

1282
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:29,567
you think
that really matters?

1283
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:36,868
Do you know what
they call you, Jered?

1284
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,934
"The widow-maker."

I have a harsh tongue,
Jered Maddox,

and then I’m always
saying I’m sorry,

1287
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,267
and there's no use
your being out there...

1288
01:21:59,334 --> 01:22:01,767
wanting to be
in here and...

1289
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,234
me in here wishing
that you'd come to me.

You don't owe me, Lucas.

1456
01:31:54,567 --> 01:31:57,434
Well, let's say
I need the action.

1457
01:31:57,501 --> 01:32:01,033
You and I sit at the
same table, Jered.

1458
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:04,200
The virtuous
need us, but, hah!

1459
01:32:04,267 --> 01:32:07,067
They don't like
the smell.

1460
01:32:07,133 --> 01:32:08,968
[Bronson]
Maddox?

1461
01:32:09,033 --> 01:32:10,534
Damn fools!

1462
01:32:10,601 --> 01:32:12,501
I'll go out
and talk to them.

1463
01:32:12,567 --> 01:32:15,133
Leave it be.

1464
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,901
A man gets caught
in his own doing.

1465
01:32:17,968 --> 01:32:19,067
You can't change
what you are,

1466
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:20,067
and if you try,

1467
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:26,501
something always
calls you back.

1468
01:32:26,567 --> 01:32:28,834
Cotton?

1469
01:32:28,901 --> 01:32:31,434
I can't.

1470
01:32:31,501 --> 01:32:32,667
I got no stomach

1471
01:32:32,734 --> 01:32:37,567
for that kind
of shootin' anymore.

1472
01:32:37,634 --> 01:32:42,434
[Shuffling]

1473
01:32:42,501 --> 01:32:44,501
Which one is
Hurd Price?

1474
01:32:44,567 --> 01:32:46,601
The one on the end,
next to the old man.

1475
01:32:46,667 --> 01:32:48,734
Watch Lee,
on your right.

1476
01:32:48,801 --> 01:32:51,968
He's the gun hand.

1477
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:54,100
[Shuffling]

1478
01:32:59,934 --> 01:33:02,868
Crowe!

1479
01:33:02,934 --> 01:33:05,000
Please let me talk
to 'em, Maddox.

1480
01:33:05,067 --> 01:33:06,934
Jason and me were
never in bannock.

1481
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,567
We went to Abilene.

1482
01:33:11,634 --> 01:33:13,334
Hear me out.

1483
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,067
Jason and me
are friends.

1484
01:33:15,133 --> 01:33:18,467
I'll kill you if
I have to, Maddox!

1485
01:33:18,534 --> 01:33:20,133
No need to, son.

1486
01:34:01,467 --> 01:34:04,534
Whoa!

1487
01:34:04,601 --> 01:34:07,767
[Cocks gun]

1488
01:34:07,834 --> 01:34:11,400
[Gunshot]

1489
01:34:11,467 --> 01:34:13,601
[Gunshots]

1490
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:14,734
Aah!

1491
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:31,467
Oh! Ow...

1492
01:34:46,767 --> 01:34:48,534
there's been enough.

1493
01:34:59,133 --> 01:35:01,834
He's going.

1494
01:35:01,901 --> 01:35:02,701
He killed Harvey.

1495
01:35:02,767 --> 01:35:04,934
You can't let him go!

1496
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,467
Maddox!

1497
01:35:09,534 --> 01:35:10,567
It's over, Jason.

1498
01:35:10,634 --> 01:35:11,501
I don't crawl.

1499
01:35:11,567 --> 01:35:12,901
He'll kill you.

1500
01:35:12,968 --> 01:35:13,868
Get your hands
off of me!

1501
01:35:13,934 --> 01:35:15,267
I'm not afraid
of him!

1502
01:35:15,334 --> 01:35:17,567
Harvey would walk
fire for you.

1503
01:35:25,567 --> 01:35:29,434
He's my son, Maddox.

1504
01:35:29,501 --> 01:35:31,000
Don't beg him!

1505
01:35:48,167 --> 01:35:49,367
Oh!

1506
01:35:49,434 --> 01:35:51,133
Ohh... ohh...

1507
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,367
ohh...

1508
01:36:14,167 --> 01:36:15,133
ahh!

1509
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,467
Oh!

1510
01:36:17,534 --> 01:36:20,167
Oh!

1511
01:36:20,234 --> 01:36:23,300
Oh!

1512
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:24,868
Ahh...

1513
01:36:47,801 --> 01:36:49,167
