You do realize why you're in this car,
do you not?

2
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:43,715
You've been tasked by Mr. Durant
to build a bridge.

3
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,935
Any man can lay track.
Am I correct?

00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,258
Yes, ma'am.
Pretty near.

5
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,656
Then can you explain
why you've been spending

00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:53,608
all your energy at rail's end

7
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:55,055
instead of at the bridge site?

8
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,683
That will be remedied, ma'am.

9
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,372

You heard what the lady said.

12
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,445
This the part where I tell you the men
don't like taking orders from a woman.

13
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,293
They don't have to like it.

No, they don't.

15
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:16,080
But if you're looking to get back
in Mr. Durant's good graces,

16
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:19,205
then pissing off the man
might not be the best tact.

Doesn't matter,
as long as we get this rail road built.

There's too many!
They got the high ground.

If you keep them occupied,

we can loop back and try and outflank 'em.

They gave in?

503
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,850
If the freedmen agree
to go back out, no conditions,

504
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:27,036
when the men sober up,
we'll give the Negroes rifles

505
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,455
and send everybody back out to the cut.

506
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,689
But you said yourself

507
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,166
we can't capitulate to their demands.

508
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,002
Point is, we ain't.

509
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,712
I am not arming the freedmen.

510
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,921
You want this rail road built,
somebody's got to patrol that land.

511
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:40,342
Now, you gonna let me do this or not?

[Sighs]

513
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,871
Well, if they want to be Cannon fodder,

514
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,306
hmm, so be it.

515
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:49,726
But we have lost two days and 5 Miles.

516
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:53,212
Those men fought to
the death for their jobs.

517
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,315
We'll make up those 5 Miles in no times.

So that's it.
We move forward.

At what cost?

520
00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:02,405
You're the one said building this rail road

521
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,506
is the only thing that matters.

522
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,692
Being smart and rerouting

523
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:08,078
is not the same as being weak.

524
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,030
You and me's gonna have to
agree to disagree.

525
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:14,834
Yes. Because clearly it always
has to be on your terms,

doesn't it?

Well, I see you've
bent the men to your will.

536
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,227
I suppose I played a part in that.

00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:58,939
Yeah.

Yeah.

Is it true?

I mean, do you believe
you're at war with the Sioux?

Yes, sir, I do.

542
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,516
And now you have the men to do the job.
