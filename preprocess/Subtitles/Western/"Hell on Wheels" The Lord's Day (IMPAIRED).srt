I appreciate your spending
your Sunday fixing it.

00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:08,337
Better than another
Sunday in an empty house.

You know me circumstance.

00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:14,679
Ain't going to lie to you.

7
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:16,480
What would you do

8
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:17,981
if you were married to a woman

00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,284
whose heart was for another?

00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:25,390
It's a big world,

Ah, Eva's me wife.

Yeah.

His train is at council bluffs.

17
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:47,963
He could be here as soon as tonight.

18
00:01:51,137 --> 00:01:53,505
More reason to get this
machine fixed by tomorrow

19
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,074
so we can finish the bridge.

20

Show how valuable you
are to the railroad.

21
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,852
He's going to know you had a hand

walk you to the office.

00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:20,361
than somebody just like him?

169
00:12:22,563 --> 00:12:24,565
I ain't never thought
about it like that.

170
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:29,403
See, you'd be his father.

171
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,970
And I'd be his uncle Psalms.

172
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:32,604
[Laughs]

173
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:35,076
I'll teach him all the
things you ought not to.

174
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:37,514
Hey, there, rascal, you pull
that girl's skirt back down.

175
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:39,615
[Laughter]

176
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:41,684
In Chicago,

177
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:44,486
you ain't never seen nothing
like them buildings.

178
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:47,823
Some of them are,
like, 6 stories tall.

179
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:50,993
You should see the buildings
in New York--twice that.

180
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,833
Me brother lives in a
building 10 stories tall.

181
00:12:57,268 --> 00:12:59,202
Would you take me to New York?

182
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:01,036
Of course.

183
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:06,471
Well, depending on...
You know.

184
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:08,174
What?

185
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:10,478
The baby.

186
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:13,911
You mean, when the
baby's fit to travel?

187
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:21,051
Just say what you're thinking.

188
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:26,518
If the baby's born white, Eva,

189
00:13:26,585 --> 00:13:28,421
then we can meet me family.

190
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:30,956
Well, see, I thought...

191
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:33,422
You said that you'd put
that aside, Mr. Toole.

192
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,690
Me brother wouldn't.

193
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,625
In the saloon, the men are wagering

194
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,360
whether the baby will be
born white or...

195
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:46,266
Something else.

196
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:51,938
Shall we leave this place?

197
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:56,643
Maybe.

198
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,282
It's a big world, after all, isn't it?

199
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:07,786
[Indistinct talking]

200
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,492
All right.
You ready?

[Grunts]

202
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:21,104
Oh, it's going to be
a wonderful evening.

203
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:23,040
I'm sure you'll adore them.

204
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:26,676
As for your flaxen-haired
maiden of the west...

205
00:14:26,744 --> 00:14:28,311
Fair-haired
maiden of the west.

206
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:30,978
Just like most of your enthusiasms.

207
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:34,285
I understand. She's
attractive and capable.

208
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:37,423
And very smart.

209
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,226
And that makes her very dangerous.

210
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:42,927
Do you think she may have
deciphered our mileage from--

211
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:45,028
They--
here they are.

212
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:48,030
Here you are.
Come in. Come in.

213
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:52,198
Ahh. Mr. Bohannon. Pleased
to make your acquaintance.

214
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,465
Same here, ma'am.

215
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:55,602
Now, you'll come right over here

216
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,639
and sit on my right.

forgive me, I--

Mrs. Bell.

00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:02,976
Mrs. Bell,
please.

220
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:04,145
Andrew.
Yes?

221
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:05,846
Close those shades and shut the door

222
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:07,047
and see that we're not disturbed.

223
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,449
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:38,842
[Distant animal cries]

225
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:46,785
Thank you, Andrew.

226
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:48,488
Well, bon appetit.

227
00:15:48,555 --> 00:15:50,888
So...

228
00:15:50,956 --> 00:15:54,159
Tell me where you're
from, Mr. Bohannon.

229
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:55,594
Meridian, Mississippi.

230
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:58,132
Oh. Is yours
a cotton family?

231
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,036
Was.
Ain't nothing left.

232
00:16:01,104 --> 00:16:02,371
Of course.

233
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:04,707
Thomas, didn't we know someone

234
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:06,943
with the railroad in meridian?

235
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:09,745
Is there a railroad
there, Mr. Bohannon?

236
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:13,785
Yes, ma'am, mobile and Ohio had a
railhead there before it burned.

237
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:15,386
Leonidas Tate.

238
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,588
Yes, Leo Tate.

239
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:20,992
He had shares in credit
mobilier, didn't he?

240
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,729
We used to summer with
the Tates in New York,

241
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:25,530
on long island sound.

242
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:29,833
I doubt Mr. Bohannon
is interested in our, uh,

243
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,703
sailing stories with
the Tates. [Chuckles]

244
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:43,245
Matter of fact,

245
00:16:43,313 --> 00:16:46,046
I married Mr. Tate's
youngest daughter Mary.

246
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:50,751
It was there at Christ church.

247
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:53,252
Well, small world.

248
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,785
Well, tell us, how is she?

249
00:16:57,324 --> 00:16:59,457
She's dead.

250
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,500
The war took her.

251
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,067
Oh.

252
00:17:15,312 --> 00:17:21,450
Did your family know
Richard McLemore, then?

253
00:17:21,518 --> 00:17:23,455
He and my grandfather laid
the very first spur line

254
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:24,891
in Lauderdale county.

255
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,893
God, Bohannon,

256
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:29,763
I just might send you to
New York one of these days

257
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:32,466
to deal with the board
on my behalf. Ha!

258
00:17:32,534 --> 00:17:35,136
Unless memories of the
city would be too painful.

259
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:39,376
Well, my eyes are set west
to the future, Mr. Durant.

260
00:17:39,444 --> 00:17:40,578
I think you know that about me, too.

261
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:43,916
[Grunts]
Well said, Mr. Bohannon.

262
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:47,621
Well, this has been lovely,

263
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:49,757
but I must go.

264
00:17:49,824 --> 00:17:52,627
I'm so sorry.

265
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:55,664
All this talk of the railroad
must have been so boring for you.

266
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:59,203
Not at all. After all, my future
is bound to the railroad also.

267
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:03,042
Of course. It's very tragic,
what happened to your husband.

268
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:04,944
Well, it's just good
we could provide you

269
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:07,146
with some employment, in the meantime.

270
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:08,713
In the meantime.
Until you decide

271
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:10,848
where you're going to
reestablish yourself,

272
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,983
someplace more conducive.

273
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:17,352
Of course.
Thank you.

274
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,354
I'll walk you to your car.

275
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:23,188
There's no need,
really. Good night.

276
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:25,723
Good night.
Good night--Mrs. Bell.

277
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,191
I'll accept that offer,
Mr. Bohannon,

278
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:30,860
seeing as though my husband
is still enjoying his brandy,

279
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:32,528
aren't you, dear?

280
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:34,662
Yes, of course.
[Chuckles]

281
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,431
You should know that
Mrs. Bell has been

282
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:40,100
very important to the railroad.

283
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:42,171
She's done a lot to get us this far.

284
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:45,208
Does that include
sleeping with my husband?

285

You ain't.

288

Why do you hide your
breeding, Mr. Bohannon?

289
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:59,154
Oh, I guess I just got used to
traveling low to the ground.

my husband is making some changes.

293

Is Mr. Durant
firing her?

294
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:11,167
Be careful with whom
you align yourself.

295
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:15,371
My husband believes you have
a future on the railroad,

296
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,811
and I do, too.

297
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:19,879
Yeah?

Hmm.

Yes, but my instincts...

Are always right.

we need to discuss your
progress on my bridge.

Mrs. Bell has an estimate. I
think we should ask her opinion.

I'm asking yours.

and we work Sundays.

Not good enough.
One week.

It was on your advice

that we decided to bridge
the gorge at this point.

320

Yes, sir. And we made
good time, considering.

I'll, um...

I'll drive it across
the bridge myself.
