my conscience will not
allow me to be a party

to the hiring of a professional gunfighter.

out there and stand them off
yourself, Preacher.

Well, it's time we unsimplified you, Reverend.

154

Now, Borders,
Morris and Short were
professional gunfighters

drinking beer and looking
snotty for a full year.

And then one day before we actually needed the bastards,

160
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,777
they managed to get themselves killed.

161
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,029
So if you've got a suggestion,

162
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,488
we'd be delighted to hear it.

163
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:42,368
Otherwise, take your
conscience elsewhere while we
think about saving your ass.

164
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,164
Land's sakes.
Where's time gone to, huh?

165
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,959
Miss Peekins' eldest
is feeling poorly.
I promised I'd...

166
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,504
Will you gentlemen excuse me?

167
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:03,139
Well, we were talking about hiring a gunfighter.

168
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,099
Yeah, we don't know anything about that fellow there.

169
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,768
Well, we know he took the best we could find to hire,

170
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,311
like Grant took Vicksburg.

171
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,605
Yeah, with a hidden gun in his lap.

172
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,692
Three for three.
One right between the eyes.

173
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:17,278
Goddamndest shooting I ever even heard of.

174
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,697
I still say we're asking for trouble!

175
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,233
A fellow like that, what do we know about him?

176
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,418
Who is he?
Where does he come from?

177
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,495
Well, you've got our permission to go and ask him.

178
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,121
(LAUGHING)

179
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:31,459
Although, the last three
that tried that didn't
fare all that well.

180
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,169
CALLIE: Let me out!

181
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:37,507
Put me down, you bastard!
Let go of me, you fat lug!

182
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,343
Get the hell off me!
Let go of me!

183
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,636
You fat pig!

184
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,305
Hey, come here.
What is this?

185
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,392
I was just down there sounding out that stranger,

186
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,394
when she come in there blasting away like a Cheyenne!

187
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,020
All right, Sam.
All right.

188
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,564
You're planning
to let him get away
with this, aren't you?

189
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,608
Be a little patient,
will you?
Patient?

190
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,236
Callie, when you run
across a man who's used
to having his own way,

191
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,155
you let him have it until he goes too far.

192
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,617
Just what do you consider going too far?

193
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,413
I mean, isn't forcible rape
in broad daylight
a misdemeanor in this town?

194
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,165
There's too much at stake
to throw away
on hysterics now.

195
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,959
Hysterics?

196
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,964
Well, I can remember
some hysterics one night
not too long ago.

197
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,674
Callie, keep your mouth shut!

198
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,883
(SPITS)

199
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,386
Morgan, get her out of here.

200
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,847
I'll see you later.

201
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,598
Yeah.

202
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,560
Not while
that squinty-eyed
son of a bitch

203
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,812
is still breathing, you won't!

204
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,524
You wonder if there's a man left in this town!

205
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:41,320
I mean, one honest-to-God man
with a full set of balls!

206
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,199
(PANTING)

207
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,076
Well...

208
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,288
Why not?

209
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,625
'Cause I'm not a gunfighter.

210
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:59,255
Oh, now, don't get fact
mixed up with stupid. You...

211
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,176
Besides, I have nothing against these men.

212
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,511
Who did you say they are?

213
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,432
Well, Stacey Bridges and his cousins, the Carlin boys,

214
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,642
they worked
for the company. They...

215
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,437
You know, what you call troubleshooters.

216
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,524
You know, just like those three you done in yesterday,

217
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:21,319
except when
they was here before,
there was lots of trouble.

218
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:22,653
And they took care of it, too.

219
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:26,449
Except, well, they got too damn big for their britches.

220
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:30,912
Started pushing people around,
and taking over the town
and we had to...

221
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,622
Had to what?

222
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,793
Well, we had to take them into custody, that's what.

223
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,672
Yeah.
I clapped the old bracelets
on them myself.

224
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:57,271
Hey, you won't be wanting that slab of pie, will you?

225
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,404
You know what happened, friend,

226
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:09,200
is they stole a golden ingot
out of the mining office
down there,

227
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,369
and they hid it under the floorboard

228
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,538
of the shack that they lived in.

229
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,207
Kind of careless
of them, wasn't it?
Huh?

230
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,461
I mean, does a mining company
usually leave gold ingots
lying around like that?

231
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,713
Well, it does seem a bit peculiar, you know.

232
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,591
Matter of fact,
Stacey kept bringing that up
at the trial all the time,

233
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,469
saying that he was being railroaded with.

234
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,180
And do you know that's why they're mad at us?

235
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,141
No, I'll tell you
what you can do, Sheriff.
What?

236
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,727
When those boys come back to town,

237
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,230
you just clap the bracelets right on them.

238
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,065
Me?
Yeah.

239
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,109
Well, I might have forgot to mention

240
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,779
that they were
all three passed out
at the time, you know?

241
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,448
Look, I'm no lawman.

242
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,701
You know, they just hung this thing on me

243
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,203
when that young Marshal Duncan was killed.

244
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,747
You know,
he was whipped to death
right here in this street.

245
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,709
Bullwhipped.
Damndest thing I ever saw.

246
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,671
Now, why would anybody want to do a thing like that?

247
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,633
Well, I don't know.
It wasn't anybody
from this town, anyhow.

248
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:08,843
How do you know?

249
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,096
Well, this is a good town, and these are good people.

250
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,640
And look, friend, we sure would like it

251
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,684
if you'd help us with our problem.

252
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,689
Only problem
you've got, Sheriff,
is a short supply of guts.

253
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,108
You people don't need me.

254
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,235
Look.

255
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,404
Place a couple of good riflemen

256
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,531
on top of that building up there.

257
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,742
Maybe a couple more with shotguns

258
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,452
down behind grain bags over there.

259
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:37,622
A few more on this roof here.
Lookout up there
in the bell tower.

260
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,249
Maybe a rifleman.
That should just
about take care of it.

261
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,878
Well, what would it take to see that through, you know?

262
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,631
The ambush.
What would it cost us?

263
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,051
Sheriff, I don't know
if I really like
this town that much.

264
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,971
Well,
this is a God-fearing town.
These are God-fearing people.

265
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,058
You like them, you save them.

266
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:02,271
Look, what if we offered you anything you want?

267
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,862
Anything?

268
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,074
Unlimited credit.
That's what it means.

269
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,577
An open charge account with no reckoning.

270
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:19,747
What His Honor's trying to say is

271
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,250
you got yourself a free hand in this town, friend.

272
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,002
Any damn thing I want, huh?

273
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,629
Yeah. Go on.
Help yourself.

274
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,423
Help yourself!
Go ahead.
It's my pleasure.

275
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,592
Yes, sir.
Anything you want
that's here,

276
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,969
as best as we can get it for you, we will.

277
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:37,973
Even if it's some little squaw or a Mex

278
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,434
and keep your bed warm at night.

279
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,228
Hey, you!

280
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,855
Keep your sticky fingers
off them blankets
if you're not buying.

281
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,983
And keep them
kids under control.
Goddamn savages.

282
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:51,237
And besides, you know, about handling that ambush,

283
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:55,074
you know, everybody in town,
more or less,
is at your orders.

284
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,428
Here you go.

285
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,473
No, no. No.

286
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,309
Tell him it's all right.

287
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,687
It's all right.

288
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,354
Anything I want?

289
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,447
Now, how's that feel?

290
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,658
Not bad. I'll take them.

291
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,828
All right, that's three pairs
of hand-stitched boots

292
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,539
and a tooled belt with silver buckle.

293
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:29,126
Let's see, that'll be, five and two, carry the nine,

294
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,213
and that comes to exactly...

295
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,547
No charge.

296
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,397
Come on, now.

297
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,320
I'd like to get all these people a drink.

298
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:42,324
Yes, sir.
One round for the house.
There you are.

299
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,662
This gentleman here's buying a round for the house.

300
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,707
No fair. No fair.
I ordered one, too. Don't I
get a glass of beer?

301
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,835
You get a glass of beer,
right there.
Coming up.

302
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,174
There we are.

303
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:03,888
Now, that's one round
for the house, sir.
Anything else?

304
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,222
Get yourself something.

305
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:08,642
Oh, thank you
very kindly, sir.
I'll have a cigar.

306
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,563
And smoke it later.

307
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:18,694
Now, including the smoke,
that comes to about $8.50.

308
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,363
There's no charge, Lutie.
(CHUCKLES)

309
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:22,489
Huh?

310
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,660
You was at the meeting.
Anything he wants
in this town, he gets.

311
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,912
You voted on it.

312
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,289
I didn't know that meant free whiskey.

313
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:33,834
Well, everybody's
got to put something
in the kitty, right?

314
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,669
(ALL LAUGHING)

315
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:37,796
Right.

316
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,763
About time this town had a new sheriff.

317
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,936
I'm the sheriff?

Some kind of a picnic.

481

Right here in our own town.

in some Nogales whorehouse right now.

dead drunk in Nogales,
we'll know in 24 hours.

You're not getting your fair share of the profits?

It's not the profits.

508
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,230
It's just that this whole business has gone sour

was hiring that man Duncan
in the first place,

513
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,784
and you did that
all by yourself.

01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:44,171
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

636
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:46,257
Please! Look at us!

637
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,717
Sweet God, look what's happening to us.

638
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,719
That's right.
It's just like
the preacher says.

639
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,514
That stranger's got
everybody in this town
at each other's throats.

640
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,516
He's set himself up like a king!

641
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,228
He's got you all
snake fascinated,
every damn one of you!

642
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:03,399
This crazy picnic.
200 gallons
of blood-red paint.

643
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:06,777
It couldn't be worse
if the devil himself
had ridden right into Lago.

(FLOORBOARDS CREAKING)

645
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:23,372
Welcome to Lago, you son of a bitch.

646
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,925
Get out of here!

647
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:45,227
They're here, Father!

648
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:46,979
I'm sorry.

(SCREAMING)

650
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,213
Morg!

651
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:19,052
Where are you going?
Morg, Morg, take me with you!

652
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:23,015
Morg? Morg, you better
take me with you.

653
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:27,186
Morg, where are you going?
Morg! Morg!

654
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,104
Don't leave me here!
He'll kill me!

655
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,315
Get off my cuffs.
Let's go!

656
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:48,874
LEWIS: Oh, no.

657
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:08,435
Oh, my beautiful hotel.
They promised me
that they wouldn't...

658
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,167
Ruined.

659
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,003
A total loss.

660
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,172
Didn't even touch my store.

661
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:40,092
Look, I want you to watch that pilfering.

662
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,219
You know, I hold you responsible, Sheriff.

663
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,805
I'm not
your goddamn sheriff.
You!

664
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,725
Say, I'll need one, two...
Two up there.

665
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:50,811
I'll need four boxes from you,

666
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,689
and shovels from you, so these people can dig the holes.

667
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:57,150
Well, yes...
But I thought
perhaps we could...

668
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:59,111
Right now.

669
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,488
Yeah. All right, everyone.

670
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,701
Was you here?
I mean, did you see anything?

671
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:09,413
Somebody left the door open,
and the wrong dogs came home.

672
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:12,249
Yeah. Well...

673
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,586
Get the shovel, will you?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

674
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:24,720
I hope
you're not gonna blame us
for Morgan Allen's stupidity.

675
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:29,308
Because the rest of us here have an agreement with you.

676
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:32,728
Well, right now I don't feel too agreeable.

677
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:37,482
Well, maybe a little bonus
will make you
a little more appreciative.

678
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,485
How little?

679
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,862
500 a head.

680
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:46,074
500 an ear?

681
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,326
Done. Done.

(SHOVELING)

683
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,757
$3,000?

684
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,760
You promised that son of a bitch $3,000

685
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:06,386
after what he did to my hotel?

686
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:09,348
Promising's one thing.
Paying's another.

687
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,601
He may just catch a bullet.

688
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,566
Oh, you and Lewis can grab shovels, too.

689
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:25,197
I knew you were cruel,
but I didn't know
how far you could go.

690
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,158
Well, you still don't.

691
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:33,497
Well, it doesn't matter to you.

692
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:38,168
I don't know where
you're gonna sleep now.
Bodies everywhere.

693
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:41,213
All the rooms are ruined except for our room.

694
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,515
Oh...

695
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,851
Wait. Wait a minute.

696
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,896
Oh, no.

697
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,400
Oh, no. No.

698
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,903
No, let go, let go! Lewis!

699
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,155
Lewis, don't just stand there.

700
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,366
Let go of me!
Let go!

701
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,662
Stop!
Look, you don't need me.

702
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:15,998
Let go! Let go!

703
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,294
Let go of me!

704
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,844
What are you gonna do with those?

705
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,804
Defend myself.

706
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:32,389
Against what?

707
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:35,559
It's no secret what you did to Callie Travers.

708
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:36,852
Did?

709
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,145
The other day in the stable.

710
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:44,109
As I recall, she enjoyed that quite a bit.

711
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,695
I promise you, I won't.

712
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,365
Well, you flatter yourself, lady.

713
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,409
I flatter myself?

714
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:58,290
Yeah, I'd love to oblige you,
but a man's got to get
his rest sometime.

715
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,376
Oblige me?

716
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:05,505
But I'll tell you what.
If you come back
in about a half-hour,

717
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,215
I'll see what I can do, all right?

718
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:11,470
Why, you low-down,
stinking, son of a...

(GRUNTS)

720
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,878
Have you ever heard the name Jim Duncan?

721
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:49,049
I've heard
a lot of things. Why?

722
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,676
He was town marshal here.

723
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,097
He's lying out there in an unmarked grave.

724
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:59,518
They say the dead
don't rest without a marker
of some kind.

725
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,063
Do you believe that?

726
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,441
What makes you think I care?

727
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:07,651
I don't know.

728
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,863
He's the reason this town's afraid of strangers.

729
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:15,742
I was going
to warn you about that.
Pretty funny.

730
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,413
What's funny?

731
01:14:21,249 --> 01:14:23,542
You ask me that
in a blown-up hotel

732
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:26,169
with seven dead men to your credit already?

733
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,632
I was just stopping by for a bottle of whiskey

734
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,385
and a nice hot bath.

735
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:36,888
All right.
If you say so.

736
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:40,100
You don't believe me?

737
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:47,149
Mister, whatever you say is fine with me.

738
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:56,324
Be careful.

739
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:02,914
You're a man
who makes people afraid,
and that's dangerous.

740
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,668
Well, it's what people know about themselves inside

741
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,670
that makes them afraid.

742
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,978
I don't know if we shouldn't mark the grave somehow.

743
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,229
Sam?

744
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,024
I don't see any need.

745
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:32,319
Ain't likely that anybody's gonna cry over them anyhow.

746
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,378
You know what to do.

747
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:51,671
Yes, sir, Captain.

748
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,759
All right!

749
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,679
Everybody grab a brush and start in.

750
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,643
You mean, you want the whole place painted?

751
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,144
Everything.

752
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:08,980
You can't possibly mean the church, too.

753
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,857
I mean especially the church.

754
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:16,029
All right, I'll paint if you say we've got to,

755
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:19,658
but when we get done,
this place is
gonna look like hell.

756
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,354
Hello, Lewis.

757
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:07,747
I want you to go to that
meeting with me, Sarah.
It's very important.

758
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:08,873
No.

759
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,085
Not now, not ever.

760
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:15,255
They are still your neighbors!

761
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:18,550
Yes, they're my neighbors, and they make me sick.

762
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:22,387
Hiding behind words
like "faith," "peace,"
and "trust."

763
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,514
Good words.
Damn good words.

764
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,850
But we hid a murder behind them.

765
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,977
Won't you never understand, woman?

766
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,021
It wasn't anything we wanted to do.

767
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,815
When Duncan
found out the mine was
on government property,

768
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:35,859
it was just a technicality, really,

769
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:37,819
but he was determined to turn us in.

770
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,946
Wouldn't listen to reason.

771
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:44,075
Is that why?
Is that really
why it happened?

772
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:48,413
Don't you see, Sarah?
They would have
closed down the mine!

773
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,457
Do you know what would've happened to this town then?

774
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:53,084
It would've been the end
of everything
that we've worked on.

775
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:56,212
All of it, all of us!
And you, too, wife.

776
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:04,179
Now, sometimes we have to do what's necessary to do,

777
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:06,181
for the good of everybody.

778
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:07,849
That's the price of progress.

779
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:10,894
And what's the price of a human life, Lewis?

780
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:14,022
Ask your good friends if they know that.

781
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,190
Uh-huh.

782
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:18,109
Your damn conscience.

783
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:22,739
I'll say,
it's sure taken a hell
of a while to bother you.

784
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:27,952
I'm packing to leave, Lewis.
I won't be coming back.

785
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,053
COLE: That's Morg Allen,
or what's left of him.

786
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:30,723
Well, now, what's he doing, riding around here like that?

787
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:34,727
He's come back to pay us
back for some jail time
that was rightfully his.

788
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,729
Only he don't know it yet.

789
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:57,542
Stacey, help me.

790
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,628
My arm. Help me.

791
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:07,510
Help me, Stacey.

792
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,307
I'm curious, Morg.

793
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,643
You helped them railroad us,

794
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:19,147
and you've got
the balls to come down here
and ask us for a favor?

You need me.

801
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:45,965
I gotta tell you about it.

802
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:49,010
Yeah. From the looks
of your arm, Morg,

803
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:52,430
it looks like
you've run your welcome
out in Lago, and ours, too.

804
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:54,849
What me and the boys want to know

805
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,352
is how we're gonna pick up 12 months' back pay

No, no. For our sake.

809

Now you can help us, all right,

810
