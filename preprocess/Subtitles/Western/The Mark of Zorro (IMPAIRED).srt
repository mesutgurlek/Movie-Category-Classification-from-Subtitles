1
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:46,679
Fair seat, bad hands,
mount not sufficiently schooled.

2
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,183
Disqualified.

3
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,478
Here's the California cockerel.
Ten pesos he clears 'em all.

4
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,452
Cleanly? Taken.

5
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,951
Grow wings, my friend.

6
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,747
Ten pesos, if you please.

7
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:22,390
Maybe you've forgotten that in
California they use horses for cradles.

8
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,673
- Well done, señor.
- And all I did was sit on his back.

9
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,976
Oh, three carrots after
his oats tonight, Manuel.

10
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,147
- You go to an affair of the court, señor?
- No, of the heart.

11
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,191
- Something is wrong.
- The face, man. The face.

12
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,776
Why the fine feathers?

13
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:50,196
A señorita who'd put St Anthony
on the griddle. We're to meet...

14
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:55,243
Have you forgotten that you cross swords
with Lieutenant Cortez at three o'clock?

15
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,798
Santa María! It slipped my mind.

16
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,875
Why do I have to meet every
swordsman in Madrid?

17
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:07,588
Everyone enjoys a certain amount of fighting,
but why does everyone pick on me?

18
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,758
It's become a distinction to
assail a California cockerel.

19
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:16,556
You pink them slightly in the arm and
shoulder and they boast of having met you.

20
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:21,644
Cadet Vega, the commandant wishes
to see you in his office at once.

21
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:26,440
Good. You see, I can't possibly fight the
fellow now. Explain that to him, will you?

22
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,866
But tell him I'll meet him tomorrow.

23
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,104
Señores, your attention, please.

24
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,009
- I'm buying wine for all.
- (MURMURS OF APPROVAL)

25
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:56,394
Come on, come on. It's your
last chance to fill up on me.

26
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:59,181
Last chance? What do you mean?

27
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,560
My father has ordered me home.
The commandant just told me.

28
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,980
- I sail on the first ship from Lisbon.
- To California?

29
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,318
- But what about your commission here?
- I'll have to give that up.

30
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:13,237
What's California like?
Are the Indians troublesome?

31
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,990
- No.
- Then who is there to fight?

32
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,949
No one.

33
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,798
Then what will you do with this
spur of yours, my cockerel?

34
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,757
This.

35
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,727
Leave it there.

36
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,134
And when you see it, think of me,

37
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:39,847
in a land of gentle missions,
happy peons, sleepy caballeros,

38
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,849
and everlasting boredom.

39
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,408
Wine!

40
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,651
A toast, señores. To California,

41
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:56,578
where a man can only marry, raise fat
children, and watch his vineyards grow.

42
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:23,599
- How are the vineyards? Bearing well?
- By some miracle the grapes remain sweet.

43
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,476
Why so gloomy?

44
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:28,813
People cannot sing with
hatred in their hearts, señor.

45
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:34,151
- Hatred for whom?
- The alcalde, may his soul burn in hell.

46
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,336
The alcalde? A kinder,
better man never lived.

47
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,157
You don't know him, señor.

48
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,831
I should know him. He's my father.

49
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:48,416
Well... I said it,
and I won't deny it.

50
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:52,181
I've taken 20 lashes before
for a slip of the tongue.

51
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,887
Row, row. Get me to shore.

52

(GUITAR MUSIC AND SINGING)

53
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,019
- Buenos días, señor.
- Buenos días.

54
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:11,819
- I'm honoured. How can I serve you?
- A glass of your best wine.

55
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:37,882
- You are a stranger in these parts, señor?
- No, not exactly.

56
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,593
I was born and raised
not far from here.

57
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:42,553
I am the son of the alcalde.

(SINGING STOPS)

59
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,698
Where can I get a carriage
to drive me to Los Angeles?

60
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,409
- Wake up! Didn't you hear me?
- Sí, señor.

61
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,383
This way, señor.

62
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:14,252
Pedro! Pedro, here is a caballero
who would employ you.

63
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,534
He is the son of His
Excellency, the alcalde.

64
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,422
I want to be driven to Los Angeles.

65
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,342
I have some boxes and a
portmanteau on the wharf.

66
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,648
I'll pay you well.

67
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,260
Well, stop staring at me.
Will you drive me or not?

68
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,685
What's come over this country?
Have you all gone mad?

69
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:33,980
Listen, you. Find speech,
or I'll cut out your tongue.

70
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,193
Oh, please. You are too late, señor. Your
good father has already attended to that.

71
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,823
- My father? What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry. But at a meeting of the peons,

72
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:46,284
this man spoke against
the heavy taxes.

73
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:51,888
The next day, the soldiers of His Excellency
cut out his tongue. I swear it is true.

74
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:55,869
Therefore, until we receive the
reinforcements promised us...

75
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,253
Huh?

76
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:12,286
So people can still laugh in California.
I'd begun to think they'd lost the habit.

77
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,997
- Your name?
- He claims to be the son of the alcalde.

78
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:19,752
I claim nothing. I am Diego Vega,
son of His Excellency, Don Alejandro.

79
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:23,172
And this, although I find it
greatly changed, is my home.

80
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:26,968
Your pardon, I'd not heard of
your returning. Welcome to California.

81
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:30,388
I'm Capitán Esteban Pasquale,
military aid to the alcalde.

82
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:33,140
I'm honoured, Capitán,
but bewildered.

83
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,936
Tell me, why has my father
turned his home into a barracks?

84
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:42,066
Conditions have changed since you left,
Don Diego. Your father... resigned.

85
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:46,946
Age, you know. Since then, the peons
have become more, uh... more industrious.

86
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:51,534
As to the caballeros, they're encouraged
to think of their own affairs.

87
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:54,125
We take care of the government.

88
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,832
I see.

89
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:01,377
I see. Tell me,
who holds the office now?

90
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:06,882
- Don Luis Quintero. I'll take you to him.
- I'd like to see my family. Where are they?

91
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,301
At your old hacienda.

92
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:11,762
But Don Luis won't allow me to let
you go without a welcome from him.

93
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:15,433
I'm quite sure that you...
you'll save me a reprimand.

94
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,519
How could I refuse a man with
a naked sword in his hand?

95
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:22,523
So a wit has come to Los Angeles.
Carry out your orders, Sergeant.

96
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,984
Sí, mi capitán.

97
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,361
Foolish habit of mine.

98
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:31,324
Some men play with a glove,
or a monocle, or a snuffbox.

99
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:35,536
Churchmen finger their beads.
I toy with a sword.

100
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,205
Do you fancy the weapon?

101
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,750
I know very little about it,
my dear capitán.

102
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,767
Swordplay is such a violent business.

103
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,430
(CHUCKLING)

104
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,099
So, this bird killed the
black-breasted red?

105
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:01,187
- Yes, Your Excellency.
- Was it a bloody battle?

106
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:05,775
At the side of the pit, all the
people were covered with blood.

107
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,737
Pity I missed it.
What are you asking for him?

108
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,615
Oh, this is a noble bird.
Well tested.

109
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:16,118
I'm asking 40 pesos
for him, Excellency.

110
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:20,164
40 pesos? Esteban! This cheating
dog should have his taxes raised.

111
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:23,668
Oh, no, Your Excellency.
The bird is yours, as a gift.

112
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,170
Not one centimo will he cost you.

113
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:30,849
That's a better attitude. Much better.
Turn him over to my handlers.

114
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,019
Señor.

115
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:42,103
And what caballero is this?
Or is he some young lord from Spain?

116
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,730
A good guess, Excellency.
He's just from Spain.

117
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,109
This is Don Diego Vega,
son of your respected predecessor.

118
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:52,989
Ah. I thought such fabric came from Madrid.
Must have cost you plenty, eh?

119
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:57,368
The caballero is here for words of welcome,
not to discuss the price of his clothes.

120
00:11:57,468 --> 00:11:59,829
Of course, to be sure.

121
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:03,833
Welcome back, young sir.
Regard this house as still your home.

122
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,836
- I thank Your Excellency.
- Luis! Luis!

123
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:10,631
A ship is in from Spain. The shops
will have something worth looking at.

124
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,801
- I need...
- Money, money, money. It's always money.

125
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,178
Luis, I don't know this caballero.

126
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,307
- He's off your precious ship from Spain.
- How delightful.

127
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:22,393
Will one of you ill-mannered
boors present him?

128
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,979
Don Diego Vega.
Señora Inez de Quintero.

129
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,857
- My wife, señor.
- Señora.

130
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:30,067
Your Excellency is a
very fortunate man.

131
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,779
I'm not so sure. She thinks
pesos grow on mulberry trees.

132
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,408
Your husband was also fascinated
by the caballero's... clothes.

133
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:40,202
We're overwhelmed by
the latest fashions.

134
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,718
And no wonder. What is there
here to interest a woman?

135
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:50,004
I long for the life you've been leading. The
gaiety and splendour of Madrid and the court.

136
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,543
Patience, my love.
You'll see it all someday.

137
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:55,343
Doubtless, when I'm an old hag.

138
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:58,721
That catastrophe could never
overtake you, señora.

139
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:02,688
Did you hear? How easily
he makes pretty speeches.

140
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,277
I regret, señora, that...

141
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,698
You were saying, Don Diego?

142
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,409
Oh, yes. I was saying that
I must tear myself away

143
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:23,079
and make some speeches
to my father and mother.

144
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:26,040
Don't leave me to these barbarians.

145
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,669
Come to the shops with me and
help me make my selections.

146
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:32,853
Oh, you... you tempt me, señora.

147
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:37,146
I love the shimmer of satin and silk,

148
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,930
the matching of one delicate
shade against the other.

149
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,183
Then there's the choosing
of scents and lotions -

150
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:49,622
attar of rose, carnation,
crushed lily... and musk.

151
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:57,113
- As for ornaments and jewels...
- But Don Diego must see his parents.

152
00:13:57,213 --> 00:14:00,379
Too true. Duty rather than pleasure.

153
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:03,001
Excellency. Capitán.

154
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:07,054
- Señora.
- I'll see you to the door.

155
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:21,304
That's one little peacock that
won't give us any trouble.

156
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:23,480
You think not?

157
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:30,694
The capitán is jealous. The fop has
pricked the fencing master. Touché.

158
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:33,739
(STAMMERS)

159
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:39,447
I don't like such jests.
Your eye might fail you.

160
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,835
It's possible.

161
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:59,008
- Who was that?
- Oh, no one you know.

162
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:01,552
Someone new. Very charming.

163
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:04,597
He must be, from the
colour in your cheeks.

164
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:08,267
At last, after all these
months in this dreary place,

165
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:12,980
someone who knows the newest fashions,
the latest dances, how to flatter a woman.

166
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,702
- When can I meet him?
- Listen to the child.

167
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,738
You're much too young to cope with his sort.
Why do you allow her to wear that mantilla?

168
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,241
It makes her look like a woman grown.

169
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:26,661
I am a woman grown.
I'll be 18 my next birthday.

170
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,288
Carmen Castellano is
younger and already wed.

171
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,583
Carmen Castellano.
Her grandmother was a peon.

172
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,919
Such riffraff wed when they like.

173
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,714
You have the blood of the
hidalgos in your veins.

174
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:42,729
Keep it cool, my girl, or I'll
whisk you into a convent.

175
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,355
I pity your poor mount, Sergeant.
Such a heavy whip.

176
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:56,888
Do you think I'd strike
a good mare with this?

177
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,776
It would ruin her, break her spirit.

178
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,532
See? She didn't flick an ear.

179
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:08,961
She knows. We are collecting
taxes from the peons today.

180
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:14,041
And you use that little...
switch on the taxpayers?

181
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:16,467
Only when they are stubborn.

182
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:22,717
When you come to collect my taxes,
Sergeant, I won't be stubborn, I promise you.

183
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:25,136
- Turn right in here, driver.
- Adiós, señor.

184
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:27,312
Adiós.

185
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:37,790
- Oh, Mother.
- Diego!

186
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,985
My son. My baby.

187
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:42,737
Mother.

188
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:46,073
- Hello, María.
- (IN SPANISH) I'm so happy to see you.

189
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,368
Good old Juan, fat as ever.

190
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,954
Hello, Manuel. And José.
Where's Father?

191
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:55,922
In the study with Fray Felipe.
Come, he's longing to see you.

192
00:16:56,308 --> 00:17:00,009
- Take Don Diego's things to his room.
- Sí, señora.

193
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:03,716
I tell you, these conditions
are beyond bearing.

194
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:07,887
This whole district, from the hills
of Verdugo to the shores of Del Rey,

195
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:10,097
is a stench in the
nostrils of heaven.

196
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:14,268
- I know, I know.
- You know, yes, but what do you do about it?

197
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:17,453
- Nothing.
- What can...? Diego!

198
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:20,280
- Ah, Father.
- Diego.

199
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:23,236
My boy.

200
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:25,529
Padre.

201
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,032
Welcome back to your home
and my heart, Diego.

202
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:32,370
- Oh, Padre, I've missed your wise counsel.
- Not too greatly, I suspect.

203
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,664
You remember Don Miguel and Don José?

204
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:39,001
- Señores.
- Have you returned to steal more melons?

205
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,211
Melons?

206
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:43,047
This scamp and my scapegrace
son crept into my garden

207
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:46,342
and gorged themselves on
my seed melons one year.

208
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,192
Oh, but God punished us, Don Miguel.

209
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:51,456
We were visited by the
father of all bellyaches.

210
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:55,643
But he's ripe for more than
boyish pranks now, Alejandro.

211
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:59,063
- I feel good muscle here.
- Arms, muscle. You men!

212
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,357
Madre de Dios, is he without a face?

213
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:04,527
Can't you see he's even
better-looking than when he left?

214
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:07,780
You should've seen me when I
approached the Spanish throne.

215
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,283
I looked like a frightened gopher.

216
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:12,451
More like a young angel, I'm sure.

217
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:15,955
An angel, that's what we
need in California now.

218
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:19,166
- An angel with a flaming sword.
- Please don't start that.

219
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:23,296
- He didn't come home to get himself killed.
- Hold your tongue. Go to your women.

220
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:26,432
Leave my son to me. Sit down, Diego.

221
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:31,672
What is all this, Father?

222
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:35,081
Well, I am no longer alcalde.
In my place is a man...

223
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:39,687
In his place sits a viper
so foul and black...

224
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:43,566
Ah, to be alone with him for
five minutes, five little minutes!

225
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,986
Long enough to tear his
windpipe out of his throat.

226
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:49,697
God forgive me.

227
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:53,367
- Why did you resign in the first place?
- I was forced out of office.

228
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,912
They threatened to burn
the homes of the peons.

229
00:18:56,012 --> 00:19:00,341
- And now he sits here doing nothing, when...
- Enough, Felipe. Enough.

230
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,962
The friar urges me to lead the caballeros
in a revolt which would surely fail

231
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:07,214
against a garrison
of trained soldiers.

232
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:10,301
Even if I thought it would
succeed, I'd refuse.

233
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:14,180
- But why, Father?
- Because the law is the law, my son.

234
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,058
I won't rebel against a government
I served for 30 years.

235
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:19,477
But that government is
now vile and corrupt.

236
00:19:19,577 --> 00:19:23,814
I know, but two wrongs don't
make a right, and never will.

237
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:28,611
- That is my feeling also.
- Sometimes, one must fight fire with fire.

238
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:33,866
I am a Vega. I will not follow the
lawless footsteps of Luis Quintero.

239
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:38,537
- Nor will my son.
- No. No, no, of course not, Father.

240
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:42,333
Oh, by the way, I went directly
from the ship to our old home.

241
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:47,380
I met Señor Quintero and his charming wife.
I found them very pleasant and agreeable.

242
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,384
Pleasant scorpions.
Agreeable rattlesnakes.

243
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:55,351
Oh, Padre. The alcalde spoke with
great respect of you, Father.

244
00:19:56,822 --> 00:20:00,571
I must admit he hasn't troubled
me or my flocks so far.

245
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:07,066
Well, that being the case,
why get overly excited in this heat?

246
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,403
Oh, I know I'm going to miss
the scented breezes of Spain.

247
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:15,825
Then you believe we should not be moved
by injustice and cruelty until it touches us?

248
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:20,136
But, my dear Padre, such things
exist in the world and always will.

249
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,917
By the way, I took up sleight
of hand while I was in Madrid.

250
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:28,054
It's all the rage just now.
Watch closely.

251
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:43,477
To think that the boy
that I helped to raise,

252
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:49,692
the boy that I taught to hold a firm wrist
behind a true point, has turned into a puppy!

253
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,037
Bah!

254
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:55,072
(TUTS)

255
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:58,743
How vexatious. Well, I must go
and remove the dust of travel.

256
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:01,713
Adiós, señores.
I'll see you later, Father.

257
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:52,011
(DRUM ROLL)

258
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:11,800
Stay where you are.

259
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:18,883
Put this up.

260
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:20,940
Put it up! Be quick about it.

261
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,157
Back to the barracks!

262
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:45,667
Cuidado, muchachos!

263
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:10,156
(MURMURING)

264
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:15,620
- Zorro.
- Zorro.

265
00:24:29,095 --> 00:24:32,123
I don't understand why you
insist on this stupid drive.

266
00:24:32,223 --> 00:24:34,292
And without an escort.

267
00:24:34,392 --> 00:24:36,460
I have my reasons.

268
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,636
Suppose you share them with me.

269
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:43,467
Look. Gold.

270
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:46,470
An agent of the Bank of Madrid
is meeting us in a quiet inn.

271
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,307
This goes to Spain.
For us, my love, for us.

272
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:53,102
I see. How stupid of me.
A military guard would...

273
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:55,897
Let our friend Esteban know
about this transaction.

274
00:24:55,997 --> 00:24:59,864
- Of course, he would have claimed his share.
- I'm afraid so.

275
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:05,580
Don't move if you want to live.

276
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,521
A bandit.

277
00:25:15,622 --> 00:25:17,543
I have distressing news
for Your Excellency.

278
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,504
I had a drinking bout with the
agent of the Bank of Madrid.

279
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:25,134
While in his cups, the fellow was somewhat
indiscreet. A drunken man is untrustworthy.

280
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:28,105
I will act for him. Hand it over.

281
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,937
- And now, that little trinket.
- You would rob a woman?

282
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:38,564
- I can't afford gallantries.
- I refuse.

283
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:42,413
Quickly, señora. I should hate
to mark such a lovely cheek.

284
00:25:44,462 --> 00:25:48,366
This time, Excellency,
I take only your money. Next time...

285
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:50,542
(CHUCKLES)

286
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:54,636
Adiós.

(HORSE GALLOPING)

288
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:33,179
- Zorro.
- What a nice, quiet study, Your Excellency.

289
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,734
I like a quiet room. Very quiet.

290
00:27:37,867 --> 00:27:40,192
What do you want?

291
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:47,151
A little talk with you, that's all -
if we come to an understanding.

292
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:50,988
Do you think the climate in
Spain will agree with you?

293
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:53,460
Why... why do you ask?

294
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:58,537
Because you're either going there or
to a place you might not like so well.

295
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:00,926
Which will it be?

296
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:05,344
- Spain.
- It's a very wise choice.

297
00:28:06,145 --> 00:28:09,757
Now to the matter of your successor.
What do you think of Don Alejandro?

298
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:12,176
He's had experience.

299
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:14,345
What does it matter to me?

300
00:28:14,445 --> 00:28:17,890
Nothing. But to the people
of this district, a great deal.

301
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,825
When you resign,
you'll appoint him as your successor.

302
00:28:21,202 --> 00:28:23,278
As you wish.

303
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:34,505
This will remind you that I have
been here once, and can return.

304
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:37,961
- Close your eyes.
- What are you going to do?

305
00:28:53,484 --> 00:28:55,386
What... what's that?

306
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:58,431
That's the point of my
sword against your throat.

307
00:28:58,531 --> 00:29:00,725
Don't move until I take it away.

308
00:29:00,825 --> 00:29:03,019
What if I faint?

309
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,407
You won't.

310
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:20,244
What's this? Are you
trying to commit suicide?

311
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:24,009
- Speak up. What's the matter?
- Esteban, Esteban.

312
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:32,298
Esteban, he was here.

313
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:34,687
- Who was here?
- Zo...

314
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,936
- Zorro.
- Ridiculous.

315
00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:45,030
- Your fears have addled your brain.
- I tell you, he was here, in this very room.

316
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,904
Hey! Anybody pass by this way?

317
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:57,293
No one, mi capitán.

318
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:03,246
- Has anyone entered this room?
- His Excellency and yourself.

319
00:30:03,346 --> 00:30:05,338
- Anyone else?
- No, mi capitán.

320
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:12,805
Do you need any more proof?
You must have fallen asleep and dreamed it.

321
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,853
Did I dream that?

322
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:23,307
- Sergeant!
- Capitán.

323
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:26,811
Turn out the guard. Zorro is
somewhere on the grounds. Find him!

324
00:30:26,911 --> 00:30:28,453
Sí, mi capitán.

325
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:31,941
I still can't believe
the fellow was here.

326
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:35,194
If you'd had a sword at your throat,
perhaps you'd believe it.

327
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,488
- How did he get in?
- I'd like to know that.

328
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:41,284
- It's your business to find out.
- What did he say?

329
00:30:41,384 --> 00:30:44,338
He wants me in Spain
and Vega in my place.

330
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,673
Vega?

331
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:53,337
Now we have something.
This Zorro is a caballero.

332
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:56,048
A brigand wouldn't
concern himself with Vega.

333
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:58,551
It would serve you right
if I did go to Spain.

334
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:00,845
And give up 50,000 pesos a year?

335
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:04,432
I can't collect it if I'm dead.
And you get a third for protecting me.

336
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:07,852
But what protection! You can't keep
even one mad dog off my neck.

337
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:10,187
Can't I? I'll find him,
I promise you.

338
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:13,733
In the meantime, I'll put a solid
wall of men around this house.

339
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:17,695
- I can't afford to lose you, my dear Luis.
- No, you can't. Your pickings end

340
00:31:17,795 --> 00:31:22,256
- if anything happens to me.
- That's exactly what I meant... Excellency.

341
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,741
Blessed Mother, send someone
to take me from this dreary place.

342
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:51,944
Someone I can love and respect.

343
00:31:53,331 --> 00:31:56,567
Let him be kind and brave.

344
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:00,712
And... handsome, please, dear Mother.

345
00:32:22,443 --> 00:32:25,646
Fray Ramón, I...
I didn't see you when I came in.

346
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:30,893
I'm not Fray Ramón.
I'm Fray Pablo, from the mission.

347
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,729
I've just been spending the
evening with Fray Ramón.

348
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:40,033
Father, I was asking the Holy Mother
to save me from a convent.

349
00:32:41,212 --> 00:32:44,628
- Is that a sin?
- The sin would be in sending you to one.

350
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:51,163
- I don't understand.
- Well, a young girl with your, uh...

351
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:53,332
Uh, I...

352
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:58,296
just think that you would probably be
more useful outside a convent than in.

353
00:32:58,396 --> 00:33:03,426
- You mean in serving God?
- Yes, yes, of course. In a... way.

354
00:33:03,526 --> 00:33:05,565
In what way?

355
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:12,863
Well, the Church must have sons and
daughters, you know, if she is to flourish.

356
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:17,481
- Do you follow me?
- Well, I... I think so.

357
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:21,193
- You mean that I might marry and...
- Yes, yes, exactly.

358
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:24,793
Strong sons and fine daughters
to the glory of God.

359
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,461
I was praying just now for a husband.

360
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,049
You were? Fine.

361
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,459
I mean, it's quite natural
at your age, my child.

362
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,897
Yes, but it's not natural for a girl of my
age to long for a husband to rescue her.

363
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:45,979
- From what?
- Father,

364
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:50,306
will you sit here and talk
to me for a little while?

365
00:33:50,406 --> 00:33:53,027
I'm troubled, deeply.

366
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:04,028
I want to leave this lonely place.
I want to meet young people.

367
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:07,949
Girls of my own age.
No one ever comes here.

368
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:10,993
The caballeros avoid this
place like the pest house.

369
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:14,877
- Why?
- They... they hate my Uncle Luis.

370
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:19,502
You know, I... I feel that there's
something wrong about him.

371
00:34:19,602 --> 00:34:22,546
Decidedly wrong. What do you think?

372
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:26,478
Well, if people hate him as you say,
you have your answer there.

373
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:32,598
Then I was right. Perhaps I should be glad
my Aunt Inez is sending me to a convent.

374
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:35,101
No, no, don't be glad about that.

375
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:40,356
I mean, probably your aunt feels that that
atmosphere is better for a young girl,

376
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:43,234
- but I'm convinced...
- Oh, Inez? Oh, no.

377
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:46,404
- No, that's not why she's sending me.
- No?

378
00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:50,003
No. María says she's jealous.

379
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:54,662
She says it's because I'm...
well, good-looking.

380
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:56,838
María has excellent eyesight.

381
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:01,168
Thank you, Father, but...
are you sure?

382
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:04,056
No one except María
ever says I'm pretty.

383
00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:11,226
Pretty? Why, you are more radiant,
more lovely than a morning in June.

384
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:14,557
You... you really think that?

385
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:19,645
- With all my heart.
- Oh, I've never heard such words before.

386
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:22,415
They make me almost lose my breath.

387
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:26,827
You should hear such words
every hour of the day.

388
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,208
You're not in the least
like Fray Ramón.

389
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:34,250
You talk so strangely.

390
00:35:57,241 --> 00:36:01,437
You're not a padre. You're an impostor.
You're wearing a sword.

391
00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:06,614
Lolita! Lolita! Lolita, we've been
looking everywhere for you.

392
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:11,614
Zorro broke into the house and threatened
your uncle. They think he's hiding close by.

393
00:36:11,714 --> 00:36:15,249
Come along. Oh, lock the doors
after we leave, Fray Ramón.

394
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:17,751
The beast may try to rob the altar.

395
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:21,673
Good night... Padre.

396
00:36:58,636 --> 00:37:00,878
Oh, Padre, you dropped something.

397
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:14,023
There he is!

398
00:37:42,388 --> 00:37:44,464
There! There!

399
00:39:39,964 --> 00:39:42,040
- Ernesto Romero.
- Sí, señor.

400
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:46,287
- Three pesos.
- Tres pesos.

401
00:39:46,387 --> 00:39:48,426
Joaquín Valdez.

402
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:51,549
Three pesos.

403
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:58,102
- Manuel Villa.
- Sí, señor.

404
00:39:58,691 --> 00:40:01,858
- Four pesos.
- Four pesos?

405
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:04,770
- Sí, señor.
- Sebastián Moreno.

406
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:14,899
- Nine pesos.
- Señor, I cannot pay so much.

407
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:17,288
I swear, it will leave
me without a centavo.

408
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:22,907
- Nine pesos.
- But, señor, we will starve.

409
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:26,911
- How can I feed my family?
- Nine pesos.

410
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:30,998
Señor, please, I beg
of you. My little girl...

411
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:33,174
No, no, no, no, no.

412
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:40,515
That's all.

413
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:47,020
I'll relieve you of that, Sergeant.

414
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:59,450
I'll take that.

415
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:04,254
Get back.

416
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,506
After him!

417
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:48,315
- PRIEST: Hear our prayer.
- CONGREGATION: Lord, hear our prayer.

418
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,972
PRIEST: And drive far away from it...

419
00:42:51,072 --> 00:42:53,349
CONGREGATION:
And drive far away from it...

420
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:57,687
- all the snares of the enemy.
- all the snares of the enemy.

421
00:42:57,787 --> 00:43:00,456
And let thy holy angels dwell therein

422
00:43:00,623 --> 00:43:03,568
And let thy holy angels dwell therein

423
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:06,737
- to keep us at peace.
- to keep us at peace.

424
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:10,157
- And may thy blessings
- And may thy blessings

425
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:13,995
- be upon us always.
- be upon us always.

426
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:16,336
- Amen.
- Amen.

427
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:19,923
Benedictio Dei omnipotentis,

428
00:43:20,518 --> 00:43:23,337
Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti,

429
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:26,716
descendat super vos et maneat semper.

430
00:43:26,816 --> 00:43:28,892
CONGREGATION: Amen.

431
00:43:30,403 --> 00:43:32,691
( ORGAN)

432
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:38,817
<i>Viva María</i>

433
00:43:38,995 --> 00:43:43,232
<i>Muera el pecado</i>

434
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:54,035
<i>Y Jesús sea siempre glorificado</i>

435
00:43:54,135 --> 00:44:05,046
<i>Y Jesús sea siempre glorificado</i>

436
00:44:05,146 --> 00:44:07,506
Good evening, Padre.

437
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:11,594
It was so dull at home, and I remembered
that you played a fair game of chess.

438
00:44:11,694 --> 00:44:15,139
So I took the liberty of riding
over and setting up the men.

439
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:17,315
Diego...

440
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:21,062
What's the meaning of this?
How dare you!

441
00:44:21,162 --> 00:44:23,689
We are after Zorro.
He rode towards the mission.

442
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:26,743
- Good evening, Sergeant.
- Good evening, señor.

443
00:44:27,126 --> 00:44:31,906
- Zorro, you say? What's he done now?
- Enough to get himself hanged.

444
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:35,375
- Have you seen him?
- I have only this moment left the chapel.

445
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:40,957
- How long have you been here, señor?
- Some little time. It seems like hours.

446
00:44:41,057 --> 00:44:44,502
I've been waiting to play
chess with the good padre.

447
00:44:44,602 --> 00:44:48,881
- It's a dull game, but what can one do?
- You have seen or heard nothing?

448
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:52,927
Of Zorro? Oh, heaven spare me.
My blood chills at the thought.

449
00:44:53,027 --> 00:44:55,482
Out of here! Search the grounds.

450
00:44:58,783 --> 00:45:02,687
What's disturbing you, Padre?
Thoughts of that bandit?

451
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:06,156
- Puppy!
- Oh, my dear Padre, really.

452
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:11,654
When I think of what one man, single-handed,
has accomplished against these devils,

453
00:45:11,754 --> 00:45:16,742
and see you, the last of the Vegas,
trembling at the very mention of his name,

454
00:45:16,842 --> 00:45:20,538
why, I could... Can't you even
listen to what I'm saying?

455
00:45:20,638 --> 00:45:24,682
Ordinarily, I'd drink in every word
you say, Padre, but just now...

456
00:45:27,478 --> 00:45:29,547
Thank you, Mother.

457
00:45:29,647 --> 00:45:32,508
- Quick, hide this plunder.
- Plunder?

458
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:36,902
Well, don't stand there gaping
at me like a fish. Put it away.

459
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:48,074
- What is this?
- It's some of the alcalde's gold.

460
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:54,037
Oh, and this I took from his charming wife.
It's pretty, don't you think?

461
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:57,247
You took it?

462
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,088
Have you seen this one, Padre?

463
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:05,505
Zorro.

464
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:10,391
So my old mentor has no more
wit than the rest of them, eh?

465
00:46:11,439 --> 00:46:14,634
Are you trying to make me
the receiver of stolen goods?

466
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:17,720
No, Padre, the dispenser.

467
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:22,696
This gold was wrung from the peons.
It's up to us to restore it to them.

468
00:46:26,996 --> 00:46:29,403
My boy.

469
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:31,491
My boy!

470
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:34,168
My Diego!

471
00:46:35,296 --> 00:46:37,615
Padre.

472
00:46:37,715 --> 00:46:40,743
Then you will lead your people
against these scorpions?

473
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:44,312
No. No, we'd be no match for
a garrison of trained troops.

474
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:46,040
My father was right about that.

475
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:50,294
But you must have had the alcalde at your
mercy when you took the gold from him.

476
00:46:50,394 --> 00:46:54,090
I would have snuffed him out
like a candle. God forgive me.

477
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,969
It would accomplish nothing.
Another just like him would take his place.

478
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:00,304
I see.

479
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:02,598
I see everything.

480
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:06,894
Diego, don't deceive
your father any longer.

481
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:10,944
- It's not fair to him.
- I don't like doing it, Padre, believe me.

482
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,943
But I must.

483
00:47:14,043 --> 00:47:18,114
My father is such a stickler for law
and order, he might spoil all the fun.

484
00:47:18,214 --> 00:47:21,576
But what do you hope to achieve
all alone, taking his money?

485
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:28,639
Oh, no. But I may be able to persuade him
to resign and name my father in his place.

486
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:33,100
- Amusing, don't you think?
- If you live.

487
00:47:59,581 --> 00:48:03,235
Doña Inez begs you to make yourself
comfortable. She'll be down shortly.

488
00:48:03,335 --> 00:48:07,614
- Thank you.
- Oh, what's this? What's this?

489
00:48:07,714 --> 00:48:10,826
- Don Diego Vega.
- Oh, yes, Don Diego.

490
00:48:10,926 --> 00:48:13,996
Well, uh... uh,
what can I do for you?

491
00:48:14,096 --> 00:48:18,125
Have you forgotten that you urged me
to regard this house as still my home?

492
00:48:18,225 --> 00:48:19,960
Oh, did I?

493
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:24,047
It's good of you to remember the offer,
but didn't you have trouble getting in?

494
00:48:24,147 --> 00:48:28,385
Oh, no. No, I had a note from Doña Inez
asking me to ride with her this morning,

495
00:48:28,485 --> 00:48:30,810
and I just showed it to the sentries.

496
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:36,768
Excellent, excellent.

497
00:48:36,868 --> 00:48:39,897
Come into my study
till my wife appears.

498
00:48:39,997 --> 00:48:43,946
It's been Esteban's privilege
to ride with her each morning.

499
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:52,409
Tell me, why is this house
so closely guarded?

500
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:54,953
I swear I saw a full
company around it.

501
00:48:55,053 --> 00:48:59,166
- I wish there were twice as many.
- Their clatter would drive me to distraction.

502
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:01,877
I find it reassuring.

503
00:49:01,977 --> 00:49:04,598
Let me show you something, young man.

504
00:49:07,316 --> 00:49:08,884
Look.

505
00:49:08,984 --> 00:49:11,386
Madre de Dios. The mark of Zorro.

506
00:49:11,486 --> 00:49:13,931
Mm-hm. He came here one night.

507
00:49:14,031 --> 00:49:16,569
He threatened my life and left that.

508
00:49:19,202 --> 00:49:21,278
I... I should be petrified.

509
00:49:22,831 --> 00:49:25,275
He's mad, of course. Quite mad.

510
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:27,831
- You think so?
- Of course.

511
00:49:28,879 --> 00:49:31,749
There was a case in Madrid,
almost identical.

512
00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:36,662
This fellow's mark was a cross.
He was a madman.

513
00:49:36,762 --> 00:49:39,581
Cunning beyond belief.
They always are.

514
00:49:39,681 --> 00:49:41,875
He killed 40 people.

515
00:49:41,975 --> 00:49:44,628
Slit their throats from ear to ear.

516
00:49:44,728 --> 00:49:47,172
Warned them first,
you know, and then...

517
00:49:47,272 --> 00:49:49,064
Santa María.

518
00:49:50,108 --> 00:49:53,679
It's a pity your sense of duty
keeps you here, Excellency.

519
00:49:53,779 --> 00:49:56,352
- Frightful risk.
- Sense of duty?

520
00:49:57,407 --> 00:49:59,768
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

521
00:49:59,868 --> 00:50:04,356
I'm so sorry to have kept you, Don Diego.
Esteban was surly about our little ride.

522
00:50:04,456 --> 00:50:06,692
I'd promised the morning
to him, it seems.

523
00:50:06,792 --> 00:50:09,611
Señora, your invitation was
like a smile from heaven.

524
00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:14,575
- I was positively suffocating with boredom.
- Then let's fly. I'm dying for a canter.

525
00:50:14,675 --> 00:50:17,327
Oh, goodbye, Luis.
Don't work too hard.

526
00:50:17,427 --> 00:50:20,298
- Goodbye, Excellency.
- Goodbye, goodbye.

527
00:50:30,315 --> 00:50:33,802
Esteban, that young Vega
just told me a horrible tale

528
00:50:33,902 --> 00:50:37,139
about a madman in Madrid,
like this Zorro.

529
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:41,351
- He thinks I run a great risk by staying here.
- Forget your fears. I have a plan.

530
00:50:41,451 --> 00:50:43,896
Yes? What is it?

531
00:50:43,996 --> 00:50:46,732
Don Alejandro is the
leader of the caballeros.

532
00:50:46,832 --> 00:50:51,820
This Zorro wants you to appoint him in
your place. What do you gather from that?

533
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,947
Well, go on.

534
00:50:54,047 --> 00:50:57,659
Doesn't it suggest to you that Zorro
is the tool of Don Alejandro?

535
00:50:57,759 --> 00:51:00,120
Perhaps, but how can we prove it?

536
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,831
We can at least help the situation.

537
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:06,001
- How?
- Form an alliance with Don Alejandro.

538
00:51:06,101 --> 00:51:09,546
That's impossible.
You know Vega's attitude.

539
00:51:09,646 --> 00:51:12,731
Perfectly, but Lolita
should have a husband.

540
00:51:13,775 --> 00:51:17,137
What could be stronger
than a matrimonial alliance?

541
00:51:17,237 --> 00:51:20,557
Royal families keep the peace
of Europe in bridal beds.

542
00:51:20,657 --> 00:51:22,899
Diego and Lolita.

543
00:51:23,952 --> 00:51:26,241
Not bad.

544
00:51:27,581 --> 00:51:29,657
Not bad at all.

545
00:51:34,463 --> 00:51:40,548
Oh, Diego, talking with you is like
a drink of cool water in the desert.

546
00:51:42,262 --> 00:51:44,800
- Oh, it's a pity.
- What, Diego?

547
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:51,421
- No, no. I mustn't make you discontented.
- Oh, please. Of what were you thinking?

548
00:51:51,521 --> 00:51:54,091
I was just thinking how
you're being wasted here.

549
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:57,970
Your beauty, your gift for words,
your perfect poise.

550
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:03,058
You were born for something higher,
more civilised than this provincial life.

551
00:52:03,158 --> 00:52:05,310
I know.

552
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:08,021
- May I tell you something, Diego?
- Anything.

553
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:12,451
Yes, of course I may. I felt from
the moment we met that we...

554
00:52:16,338 --> 00:52:21,214
Diego, Esteban is urging me to leave
my husband and go to Spain with him.

555
00:52:21,718 --> 00:52:24,496
- Oh, but my dear, no.
- But I'm dying here.

556
00:52:24,596 --> 00:52:27,218
Go to Spain, but not with Esteban.

557
00:52:28,558 --> 00:52:31,132
With whom, then, Diego?

558
00:52:32,187 --> 00:52:35,799
- With your husband.
- My husband?

559
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:40,012
- Go to romantic, beautiful Spain with Luis?
- Well, let me explain.

560
00:52:40,112 --> 00:52:45,100
As the wife of the one-time alcalde of
Los Angeles, you'd be received at court.

561
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,478
But as the companion of a
second-rate soldier of fortune,

562
00:52:48,578 --> 00:52:51,607
- you'd be completely ostracised.
- Oh, I see.

563
00:52:51,707 --> 00:52:53,901
But Luis at court, imagine.

564
00:52:54,001 --> 00:52:57,863
But, in Spain, the husbands of
adorable ladies are merely background.

565
00:52:57,963 --> 00:53:01,283
- But I'd be lost among so many.
- Not you.

566
00:53:01,383 --> 00:53:05,120
You'd need only one "friend"
to introduce you into the proper circles.

567
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,972
But I have no such friend in Madrid.

568
00:53:08,515 --> 00:53:12,180
Who knows? I don't intend to
remain in California for ever.

569
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,346
Oh, Diego.

570
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:27,267
- What you suggest is utterly impossible.
- I'll give the girl a dowry of 20,000 pesos.

571
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:29,353
- No.
- 25,000.

572
00:53:29,453 --> 00:53:32,648
Are you buying my son,
Señor Quintero?

573
00:53:32,748 --> 00:53:36,485
- There's the practical side to consider.
- It doesn't enter into this.

574
00:53:36,585 --> 00:53:40,489
You come here on a friendly mission
with half a company of troops. Why?

575
00:53:40,589 --> 00:53:44,034
Not to threaten you, Don Alejandro.
It's because of this Zorro.

576
00:53:44,134 --> 00:53:49,039
Zorro is only a symptom. This whole district
is bleeding under your vile administration.

577
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:51,750
I won't condone it by marriage
between our families.

578
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:54,707
In that case, my friendly
attitude will cease.

579
00:53:54,808 --> 00:53:59,925
Buenas tardes, Excellency.
What is all this fatiguing turmoil about?

580
00:54:00,025 --> 00:54:04,513
His Excellency has offered a marriage
between his niece Lolita and you, Diego.

581
00:54:04,613 --> 00:54:07,057
His niece? How flattering.

582
00:54:07,157 --> 00:54:11,436
But why should that cause an
argument on a hot day like this?

583
00:54:11,536 --> 00:54:15,023
Your father resents my efforts to
make the people here more, uh...

584
00:54:15,123 --> 00:54:18,735
- industrious than under his regime.
- Grinding them into poverty

585
00:54:18,835 --> 00:54:22,364
- to line your own pockets is hardly...
- Oh, politics, politics.

586
00:54:22,464 --> 00:54:26,076
- What have they to do with my marriage?
- You'd marry into the family...

587
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:30,414
Well, how can I tell until I've seen her?
She may look like her uncle.

588
00:54:30,514 --> 00:54:32,666
Quite right. I...

589
00:54:32,766 --> 00:54:35,961
Oh, no, Diego.
She's a sweet little dove.

590
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:38,463
It would desolate us to
have her leave the nest.

591
00:54:38,563 --> 00:54:40,797
If she were Venus,
she'd still be his niece.

592
00:54:40,898 --> 00:54:43,888
Yes, but I'm not
marrying His Excellency.

593
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:48,432
- Oh.
- Diego,

594
00:54:48,532 --> 00:54:53,228
don't you think the wishes of your father,
in this sort of matter, should be considered?

595
00:54:53,328 --> 00:54:58,734
But I had no say in my father's marriage.
Why should he try to instruct me in mine?

596
00:54:58,834 --> 00:55:02,321
Exactly. Will you dine
with us tonight, Diego?

597
00:55:02,421 --> 00:55:05,457
- Charmed.
- We'll expect you at eight o'clock.

598
00:55:06,717 --> 00:55:08,793
Adiós, señora.

599
00:55:10,387 --> 00:55:13,540
Diego, Diego, what have you done?

600
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:19,725
Oh, it will be all right, Mother. No matter
what you think now, please don't worry.

601
00:55:34,536 --> 00:55:38,941
This was your doing, you sly beast.
You gave Luis the idea of this match.

602
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:41,401
An alliance for the good
of the state, my dear.

603
00:55:41,501 --> 00:55:43,992
It's been fashionable since
the dawn of history.

604
00:55:45,088 --> 00:55:47,366
Oh, María, my knees are shaking.

605
00:55:47,466 --> 00:55:50,369
Yes, yes, that is natural.

606
00:55:50,469 --> 00:55:57,052
- Shall I bow, or give him my hand to kiss?
- Both. First the hand, then the bow.

607
00:55:57,976 --> 00:56:01,891
It's 20 minutes past the hour.
What can be keeping him?

608
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:05,384
Don Diego Vega.

609
00:56:05,484 --> 00:56:09,304
- Well, well, well, here you are at last.
- Excellency.

610
00:56:09,404 --> 00:56:12,808
I was afraid that you might have
been waylaid by that Zorro fellow.

611
00:56:12,908 --> 00:56:15,909
Oh, heaven spare me. Señora.

612
00:56:16,954 --> 00:56:20,785
- I am dazzled.
- And here is our little dove.

613
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:22,865
Lolita.

614
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,616
- I am honoured, señor.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

615
00:56:29,716 --> 00:56:32,786
May I present Señora María de López?

616
00:56:32,886 --> 00:56:34,962
- Señora.
- Señor.

617
00:56:36,932 --> 00:56:41,420
You'll forgive me for being late, señora.
They heated the water for my bath too early.

618
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:48,177
It was positively tepid. By the time
more was carried and properly scented...

619
00:56:48,277 --> 00:56:52,222
- Life can be trying, don't you think?
- QUINTERO: Yes. (LAUGHS)

620
00:56:52,322 --> 00:56:54,641
- Oh, please.
- Courage, courage.

621
00:56:54,741 --> 00:56:57,895
Well, shall we dine?

622
00:56:57,995 --> 00:57:00,071
Come, Diego.

623
00:57:01,415 --> 00:57:04,026
His bath was tepid!

624
00:57:04,126 --> 00:57:07,791
Poor Lolita. I'm afraid her
wedded life will be the same.

625
00:57:16,847 --> 00:57:18,916
INEZ: Please do that again.

626
00:57:19,016 --> 00:57:21,507
DIEGO: As you wish. Observe closely.

627
00:57:27,816 --> 00:57:30,105
- Amazing.
- Quite simple.

628
00:57:30,902 --> 00:57:33,109
- Have you seen this one?
- No.

629
00:57:56,428 --> 00:57:58,956
Now, observe very closely.

630
00:57:59,056 --> 00:58:01,132
(INEZ LAUGHS)

631
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:05,796
- Frightfully amusing.
- Yes, I did this one for His Majesty.

632
00:58:05,896 --> 00:58:08,131
It must be heavenly at court.

633
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:11,301
It's the one bearable
spot on earth, my dear.

634
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:15,681
Oh, speaking of that Zorro,
could you provide me with an escort home?

635
00:58:15,781 --> 00:58:19,101
On the way here, I fancied that
cutthroat lurking in every shadow.

636
00:58:19,201 --> 00:58:22,486
- I was positively unnerved.
- How distressing!

637
00:58:24,498 --> 00:58:26,942
Apparently you don't
approve of my request.

638
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:29,414
But you called her hero a cutthroat.

639
00:58:30,629 --> 00:58:33,574
Santa María! Have you met the fellow?

640
00:58:33,674 --> 00:58:36,034
I've never so much as seen his face.

641
00:58:36,134 --> 00:58:38,829
I happen to admire courage.

642
00:58:38,929 --> 00:58:41,373
Dashing about with a
cutlass is out of fashion.

643
00:58:41,473 --> 00:58:45,335
- Hasn't been done since the Middle Ages.
- It seems to be quite effective.

644
00:58:45,435 --> 00:58:48,389
He is like a lion among a
lot of frightened sheep.

645
00:58:49,439 --> 00:58:52,259
A madman, that's what he is.
A madman.

646
00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:55,276
Undoubtedly.

647
00:58:57,698 --> 00:59:02,158
Capitán, you seem to regard
that poor fruit as an enemy.

648
00:59:03,704 --> 00:59:05,780
A rival.

649
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:11,111
My dear Esteban is for ever
thrusting at this and that.

650
00:59:11,211 --> 00:59:14,448
He used to be a fencing
instructor in Barcelona.

651
00:59:14,548 --> 00:59:16,992
How exhausting.

652
00:59:17,092 --> 00:59:20,009
- I didn't find it so.
- Then why did you give it up?

653
00:59:20,637 --> 00:59:23,207
I had the misfortune to
kill a man of influence.

654
00:59:23,307 --> 00:59:26,210
A lady was involved, I believe.

655
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:29,755
The gentleman's wife, no doubt?

656
00:59:29,855 --> 00:59:32,310
Just how did you mean that, señor?

657
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:36,443
I'd hoped to be amusing.
Have I failed?

658
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,311
Somewhat. With me.

659
00:59:41,575 --> 00:59:46,647
Oh, what are the new dance steps?
You know them all, I suppose.

660
00:59:46,747 --> 00:59:49,816
- I'm afraid so.
- I would so love to have you show me.

661
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:51,993
Gladly.

662
00:59:55,422 --> 01:00:00,380
- Inez would enjoy it more, señor.
- Nonsense, my child. Dance with him.

663
01:00:06,475 --> 01:00:09,144
Play "El Sombrero Blanco".

664
01:00:12,522 --> 01:00:15,801
<i>Es posible padre mio</i>

665
01:00:15,901 --> 01:00:19,471
<i>Que yo venga a padecer</i>

666
01:00:19,571 --> 01:00:22,975
<i>Y que venga a pasar trabajos</i>

667
01:00:23,075 --> 01:00:26,645
<i>Por causa de una mujer</i>

668
01:00:26,745 --> 01:00:30,148
<i>Deja que te ponga mi sombrero blanco</i>

669
01:00:30,248 --> 01:00:33,610
<i>Deja que te ponga mi sombrero azul</i>

670
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:36,989
<i>Deja como un niño
dormirte en mis brazos</i>

671
01:00:37,089 --> 01:00:44,716
<i>Deja que te cante arrú arrú arrú arrú</i>

672
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:18,071
<i>Deja que te ponga mi sombrero blanco</i>

673
01:01:18,171 --> 01:01:21,700
<i>Deja que te ponga mi sombrero azul</i>

674
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,245
<i>Deja como un niño
dormirte en mis brazos</i>

675
01:01:25,345 --> 01:01:29,213
<i>Deja que te cante arrú arrú arrú</i>

676
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,806
I never dreamed dancing
could be so wonderful.

677
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:40,975
I found it rather fatiguing.

678
01:01:42,237 --> 01:01:44,702
If you'll excuse me,
señor, I wish to retire.

679
01:01:44,803 --> 01:01:46,705
So sorry.

680
01:01:53,332 --> 01:01:56,249
- What's got into the girl?
- Who knows?

681
01:01:59,504 --> 01:02:02,375
- Our little dove has flown.
- I don't like it.

682
01:02:06,303 --> 01:02:09,289
You're not serious about
this marriage. You can't be.

683
01:02:09,389 --> 01:02:13,168
But it's perfect. You and I could
be seen together anywhere in Madrid

684
01:02:13,268 --> 01:02:15,842
without the slightest
danger of gossip.

685
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:22,553
- Excellency, your niece is charming.
- A sweet child.

686
01:02:22,653 --> 01:02:26,473
May I plead with you for
her hand in marriage?

687
01:02:26,573 --> 01:02:28,981
A refusal would crush me.

688
01:02:29,409 --> 01:02:33,905
She's yours, my dear Diego,
with all my blessings.

689
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,121
Who's there?

690
01:03:30,095 --> 01:03:32,414
- Zorro!
- I have a confession to make.

691
01:03:32,514 --> 01:03:34,917
- Go. You'll be caught.
- I must talk to you.

692
01:03:35,017 --> 01:03:38,017
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Madre de Dios.

693
01:03:39,438 --> 01:03:44,301
What do you mean by running away from the
man to whom I've promised you in marriage?

694
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:49,515
- You... you've done that without asking me?
- What do you know about such things?

695
01:03:49,615 --> 01:03:52,768
And it's time that you
understood that...

696
01:03:52,868 --> 01:03:54,907
- Who's that?
- No one.

697
01:03:56,955 --> 01:04:00,823
Forgive me, my dear.
I've been an old fool.

698
01:04:04,171 --> 01:04:09,046
You seem to know how to handle these
matters much better than your Uncle Luis.

699
01:04:12,095 --> 01:04:15,180
You?! Don't come in here.

700
01:04:18,602 --> 01:04:21,175
I have something
important to say to you.

701
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:25,842
You, pretending to be Zorro. I don't
care to hear anything you have to say.

702
01:04:25,942 --> 01:04:28,434
So unlock that door and go.

703
01:04:37,788 --> 01:04:41,650
I'm glad to see you took the
advice I gave you in the chapel.

704
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:45,700
- Chapel?
- About not hiding such beauty in a convent.

705
01:04:47,172 --> 01:04:49,461
What did you say?

706
01:04:51,009 --> 01:04:55,038
You're more lovely,
more radiant than a morning in June.

707
01:04:55,138 --> 01:04:57,511
Oh, no, surely I must be dreaming.

708
01:04:59,434 --> 01:05:03,005
- You are Zorro.
- Yes, Lolita.

709
01:05:03,105 --> 01:05:08,385
In order to accomplish what I set out to do,
I've had to deceive people, including you.

710
01:05:08,485 --> 01:05:10,774
Oh, yes, I... I see.

711
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:15,684
I understand.
You don't have to explain.

712
01:05:15,784 --> 01:05:18,812
You came to say that asking to
marry me was part of the game.

713
01:05:18,912 --> 01:05:24,401
Oh, no, chiquita, no. That's the one
real thing about this whole masquerade.

714
01:05:24,501 --> 01:05:26,195
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

715
01:05:26,295 --> 01:05:29,156
- Oh, go quickly.
- Ride with me tomorrow.

716
01:05:29,256 --> 01:05:31,877
Oh, yes, yes, but go.

717
01:05:35,637 --> 01:05:37,926
Diego, be careful.

718
01:05:40,267 --> 01:05:42,544
INEZ: Lolita! Open the door!

719
01:05:42,644 --> 01:05:44,933
Yes, I'm coming.

720
01:05:50,277 --> 01:05:52,513
You seem upset, my dear.

721
01:05:52,613 --> 01:05:54,806
Have you been crying?

722
01:05:54,906 --> 01:05:58,690
- Yes, I have.
- I understand.

723
01:06:00,495 --> 01:06:03,815
This marriage was your uncle's idea.
The man's not your type.

724
01:06:03,915 --> 01:06:06,193
He's far too sophisticated.

725
01:06:06,293 --> 01:06:09,413
- You really think so, Inez?
- Beyond a question.

726
01:06:10,547 --> 01:06:14,910
I saw how he affected you tonight.
My heart bled for you, my dear.

727
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:19,289
When you tell Luis you'll have none of this
marriage, you can count on my full support.

728
01:06:19,389 --> 01:06:22,417
Well, I... I hardly know what to say.

729
01:06:22,517 --> 01:06:25,546
Uncle Luis has done so much for me.

730
01:06:25,646 --> 01:06:29,643
Nonsense. He has no right to
expect you to spoil your life.

731
01:06:30,692 --> 01:06:34,555
Oh, well. Any marriage is
better than none, I suppose.

732
01:06:34,655 --> 01:06:37,525
Perhaps I could learn
to tolerate Diego.

733
01:06:38,575 --> 01:06:41,529
Oh, I... I do so want
to please Uncle Luis.

734
01:06:42,704 --> 01:06:45,566
There's such a thing as
carrying gratitude too far.

735
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:50,541
We can't ask you to spend your life
with a man you think repulsive.

736
01:06:51,213 --> 01:06:53,834
We'll talk of this
again in the morning.

737
01:06:54,883 --> 01:06:57,255
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.

738
01:07:16,655 --> 01:07:19,739
Past midnight. He's not home yet.

739
01:07:21,285 --> 01:07:25,147
- How can you read?
- It's the latest European styles.

740
01:07:25,247 --> 01:07:29,568
- Bustles are coming in, it seems.
- Bustles! What is a bustle?

741
01:07:29,668 --> 01:07:32,946
Oh, it's something to...
to build you up, here.

742
01:07:33,046 --> 01:07:36,992
Santa María! Our only son in
the clutches of those polecats,

743
01:07:37,092 --> 01:07:41,496
and you sit there,
planning to decorate your...

744
01:07:41,596 --> 01:07:44,082
- Alejandro!
- Well...

745
01:07:44,182 --> 01:07:49,546
There you are. Why didn't you spend the
entire night with your delightful friends?

746
01:07:49,646 --> 01:07:51,965
What have you done about that girl?

747
01:07:52,065 --> 01:07:55,427
- Well? How did you get out of it?
- She's perfectly charming.

748
01:07:55,527 --> 01:07:59,056
A lovely, unspoiled child.
You'll be delighted with her, Father.

749
01:07:59,156 --> 01:08:02,026
I'll be delighted with her?
What have you done?

750
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:07,564
Well, I've just taken the first steps
towards making you a grandfather.

751
01:08:07,664 --> 01:08:10,025
What?

752
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:12,698
What a son you bore me.

753
01:08:17,633 --> 01:08:21,954
An alliance with those terrible people.
Son, why did you do it?

754
01:08:22,054 --> 01:08:25,249
- For the best reason in the world, Mother.
- What is that?

755
01:08:25,349 --> 01:08:28,043
- Lolita Quintero.
- She attracts you?

756
01:08:28,143 --> 01:08:30,463
It's more than that.
From the day I first saw...

757
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:33,324
I thought you hadn't
met her until tonight.

758
01:08:34,024 --> 01:08:38,220
Well, I did catch a glimpse
of her some time ago. And...

759
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:42,808
You're concealing something
from us, son. I'm sure of it.

760
01:08:42,908 --> 01:08:46,019
- It's time you went to bed.
- Very well.

761
01:08:46,119 --> 01:08:49,439
But, Diego, tell me
as soon as you can.

762
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:51,828
I will, Mother.

763
01:09:01,927 --> 01:09:05,914
- What's the meaning of that?
- Gonzales was collecting taxes.

764
01:09:06,014 --> 01:09:08,834
A priest resisted.
The fool gave him ten lashes.

765
01:09:08,934 --> 01:09:11,712
- Send Gonzales to me.
- I wish I could.

766
01:09:11,812 --> 01:09:15,591
- What's to prevent it?
- The disappearance of Sergeant Gonzales.

767
01:09:15,691 --> 01:09:18,760
- He's gone? Where?
- To Hades, I hope.

768
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:22,111
I'll collect the mission
taxes myself from now on.

769
01:09:30,414 --> 01:09:32,905
That should teach them.

770
01:09:39,464 --> 01:09:41,540
What's that?

771
01:09:42,634 --> 01:09:44,710
You!

772
01:09:45,387 --> 01:09:48,123
- What's that?
- Sergeant Gonzales, Excellency.

773
01:09:48,223 --> 01:09:50,876
- I think he's dead.
- Dead? Dead, you say?

774
01:09:50,976 --> 01:09:52,885
- (GROANS)
- He's alive.

775
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,229
He's got a Z on his chest.

776
01:09:57,482 --> 01:09:58,941
Zorro.

777
01:10:08,076 --> 01:10:11,161
- Padre.
- Ah, José.

778
01:10:12,205 --> 01:10:14,900
- How is the little one?
- She is well again.

779
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,612
I brought this to give
thanks to the church.

780
01:10:18,712 --> 01:10:20,906
Give thanks in your heart.

781
01:10:21,006 --> 01:10:23,075
Buy milk for the child with this.

782
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:26,537
No, Padrecito.
This is for the church.

783
01:10:26,637 --> 01:10:29,289
Gracias. Gracias.

784
01:10:29,389 --> 01:10:31,465
Gracias.

785
01:10:59,878 --> 01:11:03,496
I come at precisely the
right moment, it seems.

786
01:11:05,842 --> 01:11:08,829
- I'll take that.
- These are the funds of the mission.

787
01:11:08,929 --> 01:11:12,082
- The property of the Church.
- Not any longer.

788
01:11:12,182 --> 01:11:14,305
Hand them over.

789
01:11:15,352 --> 01:11:18,139
- I refuse.
- In that case, I shall take them.

790
01:11:31,618 --> 01:11:35,201
You should have been a soldier
rather than a churchman.

791
01:11:41,128 --> 01:11:42,538
Santa María!

792
01:11:48,885 --> 01:11:51,423
No wonder you chose the Church.

793
01:11:58,186 --> 01:12:00,631
- Where did you get this?
- I'll tell you nothing.

794
01:12:00,731 --> 01:12:03,435
Run me through and have done with it.

795
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:11,816
No, my dear Padre. We shall
presently hang you. Come on.

796
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:23,195
If you marry that girl,
you leave this house for ever.

797
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:26,323
It might be rather amusing
to live with the Quinteros.

798
01:12:26,423 --> 01:12:29,201
Oh, if I'd only left him in Spain.

799
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:32,621
Wait till you see her, Father.
She's just like this blossom.

800
01:12:32,721 --> 01:12:35,749
I'll never see her.
I promise you that.

801
01:12:35,849 --> 01:12:38,422
SERVANT: La Señorita Quintero.

802
01:12:39,936 --> 01:12:43,549
- We are not at home.
- I'm at home to the señorita. Show her in.

803
01:12:43,649 --> 01:12:48,145
- So you defy me, too?
- You're not being sensible, Alejandro.

804
01:12:49,029 --> 01:12:52,558
- Father, this is Lolita.
- I am honoured, señor.

805
01:12:52,658 --> 01:12:55,030
- And my mother, chiquita.
- Señora.

806
01:12:56,495 --> 01:13:01,316
Please forgive me, but could I...? Would it
be possible to see you alone for a moment?

807
01:13:01,416 --> 01:13:04,862
Señorita, will you
answer me one question?

808
01:13:04,962 --> 01:13:08,532
- Certainly, señor.
- Do you want to marry my son?

809
01:13:08,632 --> 01:13:10,742
Why, yes.

810
01:13:10,842 --> 01:13:16,548
- Why?
- Well, I... I love him, señor.

811
01:13:21,436 --> 01:13:25,304
You are right, my son.
She is like the flower.

812
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,520
Diego...

813
01:13:31,571 --> 01:13:35,267
Something terrible has happened.
They've arrested Fray Felipe.

814
01:13:35,367 --> 01:13:38,487
They say he is Zorro and
they are going to hang him.

815
01:13:39,538 --> 01:13:42,316
- Where is he now?
- In the guardhouse at the barracks.

816
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:44,574
Oh, Diego, what can you do?

817
01:13:45,627 --> 01:13:47,952
I don't know yet.

818
01:13:50,048 --> 01:13:53,548
Look, so far I've only
frightened your uncle.

819
01:13:54,594 --> 01:13:59,256
This may mean that I'll have to do
more than that. Do you understand?

820
01:14:00,183 --> 01:14:04,513
But if that becomes necessary,
will it make any difference between us?

821
01:14:23,457 --> 01:14:27,585
Sentries! Sentries!
There's someone in that chair. Seize him!

822
01:14:30,797 --> 01:14:33,242
Diego! What are you doing here?

823
01:14:33,342 --> 01:14:36,662
- You frightened me half out of my wits.
- Oh, this is too much.

824
01:14:36,762 --> 01:14:40,415
It's distressing enough to call on my
betrothed and not find her at home.

825
01:14:40,515 --> 01:14:45,012
- Now to be manhandled by these ruffians.
- Leave us. Leave us.

826
01:14:49,066 --> 01:14:51,343
Where is Lolita?
No one seems to know.

827
01:14:51,443 --> 01:14:55,681
Oh, riding, driving, walking.
What does a young girl do?

828
01:14:55,781 --> 01:14:59,935
Am I to understand that my betrothed is
allowed to wander about the countryside

829
01:15:00,035 --> 01:15:01,812
without a duenna?

830
01:15:01,912 --> 01:15:05,232
I protest, Your Excellency.
I protest strongly.

831
01:15:05,332 --> 01:15:07,490
I can't discuss that now.

832
01:15:08,543 --> 01:15:11,613
Do you know this Zorro had
an accomplice? A priest.

833
01:15:11,713 --> 01:15:16,034
We arrested him today. And another
horrible thing happened to me this morning.

834
01:15:16,134 --> 01:15:18,954
Gonzales was beaten half
to death by this Zorro.

835
01:15:19,054 --> 01:15:21,874
He shoved him over the
wall right before my eyes.

836
01:15:21,974 --> 01:15:24,511
How frightful. (TUTS)

837
01:15:27,062 --> 01:15:29,965
But after all, it was
harder on Gonzales.

838
01:15:30,065 --> 01:15:32,217
Please, this is no time for jesting.

839
01:15:32,317 --> 01:15:35,982
Perhaps that madman is lurking
on the grounds right now.

840
01:15:43,453 --> 01:15:45,731
What shall I do? What shall I do?

841
01:15:45,831 --> 01:15:48,275
I offer rewards and nothing happens.

842
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:51,028
Well, he may change
his mind about you.

843
01:15:51,128 --> 01:15:53,780
Those creatures
usually do, I believe.

844
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,491
He may decide to cut the
throat of someone else.

845
01:15:56,591 --> 01:16:01,830
- Must you always talk of throat-cutting?
- Oh, how thoughtless of me.

846
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:06,793
- What you need is a drop of brandy.
- Brandy. Yes, yes, brandy.

847
01:16:06,893 --> 01:16:09,922
It's gone. I'm surrounded by idiots.

848
01:16:10,022 --> 01:16:13,936
Stupid servants, stupid soldiers.

849
01:16:15,152 --> 01:16:19,765
You know, I admire you tremendously.
Your courage, your fortitude.

850
01:16:19,865 --> 01:16:24,978
Why, a weaker man would forget his
civic duty and get away from all this.

851
01:16:25,078 --> 01:16:27,564
- You rang, Your Excellency?
- Yes, brandy.

852
01:16:27,664 --> 01:16:31,876
- On the desk, Your Excellency.
- It's not on the desk. Bring some!

853
01:16:34,129 --> 01:16:38,033
A situation of this sort would
wreck my constitution in a week.

854
01:16:38,133 --> 01:16:41,217
But then I haven't the iron
nerve of Your Excellency.

855
01:16:41,887 --> 01:16:46,513
Your Excellency, come! Come quickly!
Something has happened in the cellar.

856
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:51,515
Guards! You, follow me!

857
01:16:58,236 --> 01:17:00,556
Look!

858
01:17:00,656 --> 01:17:03,277
Look, Your Excellency.

859
01:17:09,957 --> 01:17:11,581
Zorro.

860
01:17:12,626 --> 01:17:15,737
Here in the cellar,
right below my study.

861
01:17:15,837 --> 01:17:18,411
Look, here's his trail.

862
01:17:23,428 --> 01:17:25,800
It goes this way.

863
01:17:29,977 --> 01:17:32,265
It ends here.

864
01:17:36,441 --> 01:17:39,261
He couldn't have gone
through the wall.

865
01:17:39,361 --> 01:17:44,070
He's not human. He's...
Light my way out of here. Quick!

866
01:17:54,842 --> 01:17:58,538
Diego. Diego, Diego.

867
01:17:58,638 --> 01:18:03,835
You were right. You were right. I'll leave
this cursed place. I'll do as he asks.

868
01:18:03,935 --> 01:18:06,508
- Pen, paper.
- Here, Excellency.

869
01:18:12,193 --> 01:18:14,518
A man should consider his wife.

870
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:21,144
Inez has... Inez has gone crazy
over the idea of Madrid.

871
01:18:21,244 --> 01:18:24,613
She's been at me night and
day to take her there.

872
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:29,944
This should do it.

873
01:18:30,044 --> 01:18:33,045
This should suit that maniac.

874
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:37,045
There, look it over.

875
01:18:40,888 --> 01:18:45,209
That's very direct.
But you forgot to sign.

876
01:18:45,309 --> 01:18:47,920
- Sign what?
- My resignation, Esteban.

877
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,309
This Zorro will kill me if I stay.

878
01:18:51,816 --> 01:18:56,012
You may escape him, but I will surely
kill you if you write any more of these.

879
01:18:56,112 --> 01:19:00,391
But, Esteban, I'm in danger.
Grave danger. Diego here will bear me out.

880
01:19:00,491 --> 01:19:05,271
You're in even greater danger than he thinks.
So you tried to get gold out of the country?

881
01:19:05,371 --> 01:19:11,027
If you ever again take one peso of mine,
I'll cut your throat from ear to ear.

882
01:19:11,127 --> 01:19:15,239
I must ask you to change the subject.
He objects to talk of throat-cutting.

883
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:19,202
Quiet, you popinjay. I've no
reason for letting you live either.

884
01:19:19,302 --> 01:19:21,412
What a pleasant coincidence.

885
01:19:21,512 --> 01:19:24,264
I feel exactly the same way
about you, Capitán.

886
01:19:24,891 --> 01:19:28,795
You wouldn't care to translate that
feeling into action, would you?

887
01:19:28,895 --> 01:19:32,098
I might be tempted,
if I had a weapon.

888
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,134
Would you?

889
01:19:35,234 --> 01:19:38,221
Now, please, gentlemen.

890
01:19:38,321 --> 01:19:40,598
This is going much too far.

891
01:19:40,698 --> 01:19:44,519
- It's only to serve you, Excellency.
- Ha! You have a champion, Luis.

892
01:19:44,619 --> 01:19:46,729
And what a champion.

893
01:19:46,829 --> 01:19:49,747
Now, gentlemen. Diego...

894
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,538
Esteban, why...?

895
01:19:56,255 --> 01:19:58,331
Esteban, Est...

896
01:20:03,387 --> 01:20:06,175
I'll make it short,
and save you fatigue.

897
01:20:19,946 --> 01:20:22,223
Esteban... Sentries! Sentries!

898
01:20:22,323 --> 01:20:27,483
- DIEGO: No interference, Excellency, please.
- We have a hero with us.

899
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:45,963
- Are you all right, Diego?
- Ask the capitán.

900
01:20:47,473 --> 01:20:49,715
Get out. Get out.

901
01:21:18,345 --> 01:21:20,883
The fencing master has met his equal.

902
01:21:22,633 --> 01:21:24,293
Careful!

903
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,930
- Are you tiring, Diego?
- No, Excellency, I'll take you on in a moment.

904
01:21:39,108 --> 01:21:43,770
- It's a good effort, Capitán.
- My next will be better, my fancy clown.

905
01:22:09,388 --> 01:22:14,097
- The capitán's blade is not so firm.
- Still firm enough to run you through.

906
01:22:25,696 --> 01:22:28,270
I needed that scratch to awaken me.

907
01:22:49,512 --> 01:22:53,426
He's dead. Well,
he's been troublesome lately.

908
01:22:55,351 --> 01:22:58,171
And you killed him, Diego.

909
01:22:58,271 --> 01:23:02,342
Your Excellency, a secret stairway
from the cellar. We just discovered it.

910
01:23:02,442 --> 01:23:04,594
A secret stairway? Leading here?

911
01:23:04,694 --> 01:23:06,852
Yes, Your Excellency.

912
01:23:10,575 --> 01:23:13,895
Good. Very good.

913
01:23:13,995 --> 01:23:17,190
Excellent. You shall be rewarded.

914
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:19,366
Sentries. Sentries!

915
01:23:22,086 --> 01:23:24,375
Keep that man covered.

916
01:23:25,631 --> 01:23:28,336
Take him to the guardhouse
and lock him in a cell.

917
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,454
The strongest cell you have.

918
01:23:31,554 --> 01:23:33,630
Why arrest me, Excellency?

919
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:39,629
For three reasons. First, you have
mud from the cellar on your boots.

920
01:23:39,729 --> 01:23:43,383
Second, that secret stairway
happens to be in your old home.

921
01:23:43,483 --> 01:23:47,679
And third, you handle a
sword like a devil from hell.

922
01:23:47,779 --> 01:23:51,693
And that's exactly where
you're going, Señor Zorro.

923
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:59,320
That's a pretty way to treat
your future nephew, Uncle Luis.

924
01:23:59,791 --> 01:24:01,914
No more of your wit. Take him away.

925
01:24:07,048 --> 01:24:08,756
You, Morales!

926
01:24:09,801 --> 01:24:15,665
Send the officer of the day to me. I want all
caballeros and all peons summoned at once.

927
01:24:15,765 --> 01:24:17,841
Yes, Your Excellency.

928
01:24:20,436 --> 01:24:24,966
All caballeros are requested to report
at the alcalde's residence immediately.

929
01:24:25,066 --> 01:24:28,850
- At this hour? Ridiculous!
- The alcalde's orders, señor.

930
01:24:29,737 --> 01:24:33,071
Sergeant, assemble your
men for firing-squad duty.

931
01:24:34,909 --> 01:24:37,979
- But why did they arrest Diego?
- I don't know.

932
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:41,190
Luis won't tell me.
He must have lost his mind.

933
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:43,330
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Come in.

934
01:24:46,254 --> 01:24:50,038
His Excellency requests you ladies
to stay in your rooms tonight.

935
01:24:50,174 --> 01:24:53,543
- Why?
- I cannot say. I was ordered to tell you.

936
01:24:56,514 --> 01:24:57,999
Oh, Inez.

937
01:24:58,099 --> 01:25:00,886
Firing squad, forward!

938
01:25:10,111 --> 01:25:12,688
- Good evening.
- Why are we meeting here?

939
01:25:12,788 --> 01:25:17,268
- What do you know about this, Alejandro?
- Nothing. I was forced to come here.

940
01:25:17,368 --> 01:25:19,906
They must be up to something.

941
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:27,654
Good evening, señores.
It's a pleasure to see you here.

942
01:25:27,754 --> 01:25:31,157
Get to the point. Why drag us
out of our homes at this hour?

943
01:25:31,257 --> 01:25:34,114
To witness a delightful spectacle,
my good Vega.

944
01:25:34,215 --> 01:25:36,621
You will find it
particularly interesting.

945
01:25:36,721 --> 01:25:39,046
I'm executing a
caballero at midnight.

946
01:25:39,849 --> 01:25:41,876
- What caballero?
- Who is it?

947
01:25:41,976 --> 01:25:44,857
He's the man you selected
from among you to defy me,

948
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:46,923
to prey upon me, to threaten my life.

949
01:25:47,023 --> 01:25:51,483
I brought you here to see him die
as a lesson to the lot of you.

950
01:25:52,904 --> 01:25:55,940
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Nor I.

951
01:25:58,284 --> 01:26:00,478
You almost convince me.

952
01:26:00,578 --> 01:26:03,439
Too bad you're about to lose
the best actor among you.

953
01:26:03,539 --> 01:26:06,955
But in a few moments,
you'll see your precious Zorro shot.

954
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:12,281
There. Oh, Padre.

955
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:15,750
Now, observe very closely.
Watch the candle.

956
01:26:18,387 --> 01:26:20,047
Blow.

957
01:26:23,643 --> 01:26:28,798
You should really see something worthwhile,
like changing a copper coin into solid gold.

958
01:26:28,898 --> 01:26:31,759
- Can you do that?
- The good padre here has seen me do it.

959
01:26:31,859 --> 01:26:35,013
- Many times.
- It was a secret discovered by Merlin,

960
01:26:35,113 --> 01:26:39,225
in the 11th century. It's been handed
down through a long line of sorcerers

961
01:26:39,325 --> 01:26:41,483
to some of us living today.

962
01:26:42,745 --> 01:26:45,940
You can change a centavo into gold?

963
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,456
- Easily.
- Please, señor, do that for me, eh?

964
01:26:50,086 --> 01:26:52,905
Oh, I am very weary.
I must seek repose.

965
01:26:53,005 --> 01:26:56,784
Oh, señor, señor, I have a
wife and seven children,

966
01:26:56,884 --> 01:26:59,120
and the little I earn
isn't enough for them.

967
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:02,506
Please, make gold for them
and I'll pray for you. Please.

968
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,222
Well, if I must, I must.

969
01:27:07,979 --> 01:27:12,592
- Now, hold the centavo in your closed fist.
- Sí, señor. Gracias.

970
01:27:12,692 --> 01:27:15,428
Tightly now. Now, put your
fist well through the bars.

971
01:27:15,528 --> 01:27:17,972
- Sí.
- Cold iron will spoil everything.

972
01:27:18,072 --> 01:27:20,641
Now, I take your
fist gently. Like this.

973
01:27:20,741 --> 01:27:24,691
- Oh, señor.
- Now, open the door. Be quick about it.

974
01:27:25,705 --> 01:27:28,030
- Come along now.
- Sí, señor.

975
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:35,073
Now, get in. Get down under there, close to
the wall. And not a sound, remember.

976
01:27:35,173 --> 01:27:37,046
(DRUM ROLL)

977
01:27:42,388 --> 01:27:44,677
Close the door, Padre.

978
01:27:45,725 --> 01:27:48,211
Hide this in your robe.

979
01:27:48,311 --> 01:27:50,636
Sit down.

980
01:27:52,231 --> 01:27:56,719
And now, señores, you will behold
the result of your rebellious plans.

981
01:27:56,819 --> 01:27:58,895
Come in!

982
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:10,316
Here is Zorro the fox,
safely trapped.

983
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:12,539
Diego? What is this?

984
01:28:13,044 --> 01:28:16,656
- Hola, señores.
- What idiotic joke is this?

985
01:28:16,756 --> 01:28:20,159
- As if you didn't know.
- Luis Quintero, you are a fool.

986
01:28:20,259 --> 01:28:23,960
Zorro is a man. This is my worthless,
trick-playing offspring.

987
01:28:25,431 --> 01:28:28,266
Have you seen this one, Father?

988
01:28:32,897 --> 01:28:35,800
Help! Help! Zorro is loose!
Zorro is loose!

989
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:37,608
Síganme!

990
01:28:47,453 --> 01:28:50,573
- Señores, are you with me?
- I am with you, Diego!

991
01:30:04,572 --> 01:30:06,861
God forgive me.

992
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,282
God forgive me.

993
01:30:28,012 --> 01:30:29,471
God forgive me.

994
01:31:04,924 --> 01:31:09,871
Well, what a splendid audience you have.
Peons, caballeros, everyone.

995
01:31:09,971 --> 01:31:13,124
- It was thoughtful of you to have them here.
- What's happened?

996
01:31:13,224 --> 01:31:16,669
Good evening, ladies. His Excellency
is about to make an address.

997
01:31:16,769 --> 01:31:19,714
Address? Well...
well, what shall I say?

998
01:31:19,814 --> 01:31:23,676
You know. The little matter
of your resignation.

999
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:27,940
Quiet! Quiet for His Excellency.

1000
01:31:30,116 --> 01:31:32,737
We're waiting, Excellency. Go on.

1001
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:36,743
Uh... uh...

1002
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:39,984
Good people of Los Angeles,

1003
01:31:40,084 --> 01:31:45,740
owing to my ceaseless efforts to...
to improve conditions in the district...

1004
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,992
(ANGRY MURMURS)

1005
01:31:48,092 --> 01:31:50,453
..my health is endangered.

1006
01:31:50,553 --> 01:31:52,580
(MOCKING LAUGHTER)

1007
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:58,086
I have therefore decided to give
up my office and go to Spain.

1008
01:31:58,186 --> 01:32:00,004
(LAUGHTER)

1009
01:32:00,104 --> 01:32:07,053
To succeed me as alcalde of this district,
I am naming my illustrious predecessor,

1010
01:32:07,153 --> 01:32:09,430
Don Alejandro Vega.

1011
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:11,190
(CHEERING)

1012
01:32:19,499 --> 01:32:25,697
And now, Your Excellency, I personally will
accompany you to the wharf at San Pedro.

1013
01:32:25,797 --> 01:32:32,250
I wish to bless your voyage, and ask God
to reward you according to your merits.

1014
01:32:34,555 --> 01:32:36,833
Spain. Spain!

1015
01:32:36,933 --> 01:32:41,587
Oh, Diego, when may we expect you
and our dear little Lolita in Madrid?

1016
01:32:41,687 --> 01:32:45,466
Not for some time, I'm afraid.
We'll follow the customs of California.

1017
01:32:45,566 --> 01:32:47,635
- What do you mean?
- We are going to marry

1018
01:32:47,735 --> 01:32:50,522
and raise fat children and
watch our vineyards grow.
