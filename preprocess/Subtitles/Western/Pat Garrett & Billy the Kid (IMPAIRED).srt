Now, you listen. Listen to me good.

and still smart enough...

the ranchers, I expect better than that.

been advised to recognize their position.

And in this particular game,
there are only a few plays left.

boots one night they was both in town.

397
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,880
Old U.S., he'd been out hunting buffalo
for six months.

398
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:27,246
Now, he was mean and testy
and damn near blind drunk.

399
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:32,767
He had on a pair of these flat-heeled,
about half-length Wellington boots.

400
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,478
Them boots was the only thing he owned
he put any store in.

401
00:43:39,207 --> 00:43:41,596
And John stepped on one of them.

402
00:43:44,807 --> 00:43:47,799
That old man just stepped back and said:

403
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:50,037
"Let's get to it."

404
00:43:55,447 --> 00:43:58,644
So John said to U. S:

405
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:01,275
"If you're gonna get that riled...

406

...over a pair of foreign,
lady-Iooking boots...

...we just might as well
get the ball rolling."

408
00:44:10,207 --> 00:44:13,005
So they went in the middle
of the street.

00:44:13,247 --> 00:44:15,556
And they took the 10 steps.

I was just in town being sociable.

618
01:09:45,007 --> 01:09:48,443
Rode in from Seven Rivers
to watch you hang.

619
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:54,557
- Garrett swore me in when you lit out.
- Won't be having no ill talk at my table.

620
01:09:54,807 --> 01:09:56,286
Fill yourself, Billy.

621

ALAMOSA BILL:
Don't mind if I do.

623
01:10:07,807 --> 01:10:10,241
Never tasted anything so good.

624

Thank you, ma'am.

MRS. HORRELL:
Billy?

626
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:21,525
Tomato.

627
01:10:26,087 --> 01:10:29,636
I don't suppose you ran into
old Pat, did you, Billy?

628
01:10:31,047 --> 01:10:32,366
Can't say I did.

629
01:10:33,527 --> 01:10:36,439
He'll track you down, Billy, and get you.

630
01:10:37,127 --> 01:10:40,244
Pat Garrett's got more sand than most.

631
01:10:40,447 --> 01:10:43,120
Yeah, I'm outlawed, for sure.

632
01:10:43,287 --> 01:10:45,323
Old Alamosa here will see to that.

633
01:10:48,247 --> 01:10:52,445
It wasn't long ago, I was the law,
riding for Chisum.

634
01:10:52,807 --> 01:10:55,162
And old Pat was an outlaw.

635
01:10:58,847 --> 01:11:01,486
The law is a funny thing, ain't it?

636
01:11:10,247 --> 01:11:12,044
Well, we best get to it.

637

HORRELL: Just got through putting up
that new cottonwood door.

638
01:11:19,487 --> 01:11:21,717
Used the old one for my son, John.

639
01:11:22,607 --> 01:11:25,201
He got into a shooting with Olin Carroll.

640
01:11:25,367 --> 01:11:27,278
He's buried out yonder there.

641
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:32,681
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Horrell.

642
01:11:33,687 --> 01:11:35,006
John was a good hand.

643
01:11:36,607 --> 01:11:38,325
Couldn't shoot, though.

644

Well, let's get to it.

You boys shuck them gun belts.
Let them lay where they fall.

- You boys carrying wages?
- What kind of wages do you mean?

672
01:15:41,967 --> 01:15:45,243
Well, any kind of wages.
Thought maybe we'd just have a few...

673
01:15:45,727 --> 01:15:47,763
...sociable hands.

674

Ain't no harm in being sociable.

677
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:13,006
...go over there to Lemuel
and get that shotgun...

678
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:16,842
...he's got his fingers wrapped around
and bring it to me, stock first.

679

Do it!

680
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:26,364
It ain't no use, you getting mad.
I wasn't set on using that.

681
01:16:26,527 --> 01:16:29,087
But those boys have been
patronizing me real well.

682

No use getting him mad, old Pat.
We been patronizing him real well.

smartly on the back of the head.

that's going through his chest...

over his eyes, gentle-like.
