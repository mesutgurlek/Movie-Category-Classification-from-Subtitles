Excuse me,

164
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,352
I seem to have caught you
in the middle of somethin'.

165
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,797
We just havin' a little fun.

166
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,078
I mean, up to now,
it's just been
swattin' mosquitoes.

167
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,272
Now we gonna hang us a Reb.

168
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,354
Get him down.

169
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,635
What for?

170
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,194
You a Yankee, ain't you?

171
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,396
That's right.

172
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,915
Well, this man's a Reb.
A damned Reb.

173
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,153
Why you botherin'?

174
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,436
Usually wouldn't,
except this one
happens to be my brother.

175
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,160
Get him down.

176
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,880
[woman screams]

177
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,516
Put your guns down
by that tree.

178
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,676
Now!

179
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,594
[all muttering]

180
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,516
Now, get him down
and cut him loose.

181
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,475
Come on, fellas, it's hot.

182
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,916
Just how many holes
you want to dig?

183
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,319
Down on your bellies.

184
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,995
[laughing]

185
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,957
Seems to remind you
of somethin', don't it?

186
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,236
Yeah, only it was
the other way around.

187
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,515
Old Man Childer's barn?

188
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Yeah.

189
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,711
I recall
his daughter was there, too.

190
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,393
And her brothers
comin' after you.

191
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,473
Yeah. I had a hell of a time
pullin' my boots on.

192
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,874
It wasn't just your boots,
little brother.

193
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,639
What're you doin' here?

194
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,234
Just passin' through.

195
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,356
You?

196
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,312
Doesn't matter anymore.

197
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,594
It's good to see you, Dal.
Especially alive.

198
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,837
Good to see you, too, Mac.

199
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,875
Let's go home.

200
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,915
[neighing]

201
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,674
You know, Mac,

202
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,711
half a day's ride,
we'll be home.

203
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,277
Does Kate know
you're comin'?

204
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,192
Nobody knows I'm comin'.

205
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,953
Sure did miss her.

206
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,355
I got a feelin'
it was more than home cookin'.

207
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,119
[horses neighing]

208
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,116
(Dal)
Where is everybody?

209
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,350
(Mac)
Pa?

210
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,750
Mama?

211
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,234
[birds chirping]

212
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,154
[gun clicking]

213
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,156
(man)
Don't neither
one of you move.

214
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
Pa?

215
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,359
Mac, is that you?

216
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,318
Well, of course it's me.

217
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,314
[door creaking]

218
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,437
Well, it's a good thing
you yelled out, boy.

219
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,318
I was all set to shoot.

220
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,552
Who's that with you, boy?

221
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,036
It's me, Pa. Dal.

222
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,879
By God, it is.

223
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,716
(Pa)
Ma, you better come out here.

224
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,674
Take a good look, Mother.

225
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,114
They got it wrong.

226
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,793
Damn, I knew they did.

227
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,553
Quit your swearin', Luke.

228
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,155
Dal, is it you?

229
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,033
How you doin', Mama?

230
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,472
There's only one man
in the world with that voice.

231
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,475
Underneath that grizzle,
it's his face.

232
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,077
The army told us
you were dead.

233
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,030
Oh, son.

234
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,393
Mac, give me a hug.

235
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,516
[spits]

236
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,800
[chuckling]

237
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,591
Hey, where are the girls?

238
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,473
What happened, Ma?

239
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,996
Let me get a jug,
and I'll tell you.

240
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,355
Hold this.

241
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,676
They were in this place
before anybody knew it.
Tore it apart.

242
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,519
When they pulled out,

243
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,595
they took Sissy
and Heather with them.

244
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,318
Jesse tried fightin' 'em off,
but they just hit too fast.

245
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,232
You mean Jesse was here?

246
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Two months ago.

247
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,190
He got wounded
somewhere in Tennessee,
and they sent him home.

248
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,677
Looks like
you put up a fight.

249
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,111
Oh, I managed
to get off
a couple of shots,

250
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,600
but there was just
too many of 'em.

251
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,637
Comanches have
got nothin' on them.

252
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,949
They took all the livestock

253
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,680
and just about
every speck of food
we had in the place.

254
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,434
You keep sayin' "they," Pa.
Who're you talkin' about?

255
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,957
Soldiers. Like him. Rebs.

256
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,796
You got any idea
where they went?

257
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,270
South is all
anybody seems to know.

258
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,275
Mama? You all right?

259
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,358
She ain't slept
since it happened.

260
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,194
How can I sleep
when they stole my children?

261
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,351
What about the Connery place?

262
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,954
Kate all right?

263
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,519
(Pa)
Kate was here.
Came for supper.

264
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,512
You mean she's with them?

265
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,149
You know Kate,
she'd give 'em a fight.

266
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,115
What about the law?
What've they been doin'?

267
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,352
Not much they could do
without gettin' folks killed.

268
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,152
And if it's Gillette
you're talkin' about,
he wasn't even around.

269
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,277
Where the hell's he been
the last few days?

270
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,080
I figure
I'll go into town
and ask him that.

271
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,516
Go get my children
and you bring 'em back.

272
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,910
Don't worry, Mama,
we'll find them.

273
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,313
Mac, I don't want
you havin' a run-in
with Miles Gillette.

274
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,519
You might kill him.

275
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,796
[snickers]

276
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,792
Why don't you stay here
with the folks?

277
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,351
I'm gonna ride over
to the Sparks' place
and talk to Shorty.

278
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,832
Yeah, I guess you're right.

279
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,517
Somebody ought to stay
with Ma and Pa.

280
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,910
You just find out
who did it, Dal.

281
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,833
Be ready to ride.

282
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,559
[horses neighing]

Dal? I'll be doggone.

286
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,917
Everybody had you
dead and buried
for dang near a year.

287
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,511
Good to see
you're still kickin'.

288
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,913
How are you, Miles?

289
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,070
You got any idea
who hit our folks' place?

290
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,072
And all we know
is a band of renegades

291
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,674
swept through
about a week ago.

292
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,592
Hit about
a half a dozen places
in the county,

293
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,239
then just disappeared.

294
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,674
Eh, how many of 'em?

295
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,638
Oh, about a dozen of 'em,
from what I heard.

296
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,189
Armed to the teeth.
Had some wagons with 'em.

297
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,671
Some of 'em full of grain,
others were carryin'
prisoners.

298
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,436
Where were you
when all of this was goin' on?

299
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,752
I was down in Converse,
runnin' down a prisoner
of my own.

300
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,275
That's, kind of,
out of your territory,
isn't it?

301
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,680
Yep, a ways.

302
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,116
But I wanted
to see this man locked up.

303
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,113
Happens he was a kin
of yours, your Uncle Jack.

304
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,681
Dal, even if I'd been here
when the renegades
come through,

305
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,439
there's nothin'
I could have done about it.

306
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,954
You could've gone after 'em.

307
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,633
They didn't leave much choice.

308
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,519
Said anyone tried followin',
they'd find nothin'
but bodies.

309
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Dal?

310
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,040
Hello, Frank.

311
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,639
Sorry you had to come back
to somethin' like this.

312
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,916
Appears
they hit your place, too.

313
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,999
Happens I was out
at your folks', with Kate.

314
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,199
We were engaged, Dal.
Gonna get married.

315
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,517
We all thought you were dead.

316
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,197
Pa said
they were headed south.

317
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,556
Yeah, pulled out
about four days ago.

318
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,275
I got a feelin'
you're goin' after 'em.

319
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,473
Mac's out at the place now.
He'll ride with me.

320
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,157
Sharp's. Take 'em.

321
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,274
Knock the stripes off a skunk

I know, Heather. We all do.

333
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,040
Why hasn't someone
come to help us, Kate?

334
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,793
Someone has to come.

335
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,360
We can't count on that.

We've got to do it ourselves.

How?

338
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,878
I'm gonna talk to Jesse.

339
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,119
Do you think they'll let you?

340
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,078
Only one way to find out.

341
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,959
Watch yourself, Kate.

How're the girls holdin' up?

They want to go home.

346
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,030
Kate, if they take
us all to Mexico,
we don't have a chance.

00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,679
Maybe this'll help.

348
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,319
Where'd you get that?

349
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,797
From Dal, when we were kids.

350
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,276
I keep thinkin'
I'm gonna look up someday,

351
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,400
and there he is.

352
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,960
He's dead, Jesse.

353
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,713
I don't believe that.

354

They're headin'
for the coast.

367
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,114
Figured they'd head
straight for Mexico.
I don't get it.

368
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,759
Maybe they're goin'
for a swim.

369
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,309
Well, they can swim
in the Rio Grande.

[cattle mooing]

What are you up to?

373

Just do as I say.

374
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,280
Ms. Connery.

375
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,999
Please, sit down.

376
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,271

when we'd have
a little time to visit.

(Kate)
Why are you doing this?

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,073
I have my reasons.

379
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,120
No reason could be worth
what you're doing.

380
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,715
I'm talkin' about the South,
Ms. Connery,

381
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,395
and a way of life
that was taken from us.

382
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,160
What makes you think
you can get it back?

383
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,874
Ms. Connery,

384
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,680
the rebel yell
was first heard at Manassas,

385
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,430
and at 100 battles since then,
from Richmond to Gettysburg.

386
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,716
The rebel yell
is hard to describe.

387
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,316
It's a mixture of fear
and anger and exaltation

388
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,679
but it inspires men,
even from defeat.

389
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,156
These damn Yankees think
they've heard the last of it,

390
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,754
but they haven't,

391
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,435
and I'm gonna get it back
any way I can.

392
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,513
These people
have nothing to do
with any of that.

393
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,954
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

I know to the coast.

Well, Dal,
she thought you were dead.

to find out.

You don't have to end up

I would like to

Nothing about you
interests me, Major.

we're aware
that the war is over.

It's not for me,
or for my men.

That's why I contacted you.

We're in the market
for arms and ammunition.

to see that you don't

00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,630
Surely.

483
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,790
Rifle.

484
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,552
Lieutenant.
(Lt. Butler)
Sir?

485
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,196
I'll need 200 more,
and ammunition.

486
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,437
That is not a problem, Major.

487
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,591
I'd like to see
the rest of the guns now.

488
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,717
You can't. They're not here.

489
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,479
Then where are they?

490
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,438
Two days sailing from here.

491
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,196
I've run guns
for too long, Major.

492
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,910
I make it a practise
to see the other man's
merchandise first.

493
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,999
Then take a look.

494
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,317
I guarantee these women
will bring a good price.

495
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,837
The men I took are strong,
they're ideal for workin'
in the silver mines.

496
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,912
Plus a herd of cattle
and horses.

497
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,229
That's the grain?

498
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,040
Most of it.
We have close to a ton.

499
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,034
I understand
Maximilian needs it
to feed his troops,

500
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,157
and you do business
with Maximilian.

501
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,709
I do business
with the highest bidder.

502
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,200
She won't do.

503
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,278
She's strong.
She's a hard worker.

504
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,149
So is a mule, but it's not
what they're interested in
down there.

505
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,039
You see, this is what
they're interested in.

506
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,392
Young and fresh.

507
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,920
And spirited.

508
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,670
What's your price?

509
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,479
They're not for sale.

510
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,512
She speak for you, Major?

511
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,759
They are special.

512
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,434
Well, I agree.

513
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,991
Blonde hair is rare
south of the border,
brings a good price.

514
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,197
And red hair's
even more rare.

515
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,751
I'll give you $1,000 for her.

516
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,431
Well, what'll it be,
Ms. Connery?

517
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,991
I meant
what I said last night.

518
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,789
Throw in a dozen rifles,
and she's yours.

519
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
Done.

520
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,070
Too bad.

521
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,033
[insects chirping]

522
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,556
Get his boots.

523
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,676
Yeah.

524
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,149
[gunshot]

525
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,396
Dal.

526
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,920
Mac?

527
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,912
At least he remembers us.

528
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,794
Dal, it is you.

529
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,916
[panting]

530
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,673
They said you were--
I know,

531
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,070
I'm gettin' tired
of hearin' that.

532
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,960
(Jesse)
Yeah, they were Rebs,
all right.

533
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,474
Still fightin' the war.

534
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,029
Man leadin' 'em
calls himself Ashbury.

535
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,430
Cooper Ashbury? A Major?

536
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,035
That's him.

537
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,876
The men he's ridin' with

538
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,031
would follow him
straight into hell
if he called it.

539
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,713
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

540
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,634
You're right about
them followin' him
into hell, they would.

541
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,552
I rode with him once myself.

542
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,632
Why did they take
so many hostages?

543
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,713
Figured we'd be worth
somethin' to slave traders.

544
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,640
Comancheros.

545
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,958
Sell the men for slave labour
in the silver mines,

546
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,831
take the women
down to Chihuahua
and sell them for--

547
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,798
Yeah, we get the picture.

548
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,591
The folks,
how they doin' anyway?

549
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
[sighs]

550
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,037
Sittin' home alone, waitin'.

551
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,798
Well, at least
they're together.

552
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,880
Yup.

553
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,670
They always done
just fine together.

554
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,919
[waves crashing]

555
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,597
How're the girls doin'?
They all right?

556
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,399
Uh, Heather's scared.

557
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,114
Sissy's lookin' out for her,
and Kate's lookin' out
for both of them.

558
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,512
Hear you got yourself wounded
somewhere in Tennessee.

559
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,115
Shoulder.

560
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,152
But it's all right now.

561
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,274
Did, uh, Ma tell you
what colour I was wearin'?

562
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,477
Blue, grey, it doesn't matter.

563
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,078
A man fights
for what he believes in.
Just be glad it's over.

564
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,514
Amen to that.

565

[seagulls cawing]

00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,200

[grunts]

568
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,159
Yeah, I can ride.

569
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,833
Goin' in the mornin'.

570

[seagulls cawing]

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,672
When do we go for the guns?

573
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,280
The first tide.

574
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,319
But there'll only be yourself
and two men allowed along.

575
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,800
There's the grain
and the prisoners.

576
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,599
No room for everyone.

577
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,718
What about the horses
and the cattle?

578
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,033
My men will drive 'em down
when we come back,
in four or five days.

579
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,518
You have a deal, Major.

580
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,753
You can trust me.

581
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,034
I was wondering
if you would care to join me.

582
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,474
The pheasant
in this part of the country
is extraordinary.

583
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,517
Cooked with wine and sage.

584
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,473
You must be starved.

585
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,476
Well?

586
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,397
If you're thinking
of using that knife
on me, don't.

587
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,150
And if I did?

588
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,550
That man out there
would shoot you.

589
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,109
Thereby making you
a somewhat less attractive
dinner partner.

590
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,675
Allow me.

591
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,753
What happens to us now?

592
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,115
Chihuahua?

593
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,200
No.

594
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,750
Not you.

595
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,277
You're much too good
for that.

596
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,634
Why not Mexico City,
St. Louis, New Orleans?

597
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,354
I'm really tempted
to take you along with me,

598
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,714
but I'm just afraid
that I'd awaken some morning

599
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,554
and find
you'd made a necklace
with my teeth.

600
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,392
No, you'll stay here for now.

601
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,994
What about the girls?

602
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,878
They're coming with me.

603
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,633
I'd rather go with them.

604
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,870
I'm sorry.

605
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,360
I'll be back in a while,

606
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,114
and then we'll decide
what to do with you.

you'd come.

Thank you, Kate.

Hello, Mac.

Hello, Kate.

637
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,952
Hey, how do you like
what I picked up
on the trail?

638
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,632
What about Heather and Sissy?

639
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,757
They sailed this morning
for Mexico.

640
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,320
Why didn't
they take you along?

641
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,437

I can appreciate that.

00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,633
He sailed with them.

645
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,031
It's a hard ride
between here and Chihuahua.

646
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,112
And them travellin' by ship.

647
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,432
I don't know nothin'
about Mexico.

648
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,520
Dal?

649
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,995
Not much.

650
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,916
Jesse?

651
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,958
I know someone who does.

652
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,714
Jack Traven.

653
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,591
You are talkin' about
Uncle "Black Jack" Traven?

654
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,875
Yes, sir.

655
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,400
Well, big brother,

656
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,871
you know there are some people
who call him "scoundrel."

657
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,636
Some might even call him
"outlaw."

658
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,474
And we all know he's a rogue.

659
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,155
Besides, we don't know
where to find him.

660
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,959
Converse County Jail.

661
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,712
What are we waitin' for?

662
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,190
[sawing]

663
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,759
Never seen old Uncle Jack
raise a sweat before.

664
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,114
[birds chirping]

665
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,719
[chuckling]
Well,

666
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,551
good to see you boys
made it through the war
all right.

667
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,554
Well, quit gawkin'.
It's humiliatin' enough
without you laughin' on it.

668
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,793
Aw, come on, Uncle Jack,
you've been in jail before.

669
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,439
Well, I don't care about that.

670
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,637
It's the workin'
I'm talkin' about.

671
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,111
A lot of men have seen me
raise a lot of hell
in my time,

672
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,637
but not one man alive
has ever seen me
raise a blister.

673
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,997
Well, don't fret
about it, Jack.

674
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,878
We're not gonna tell nobody.

675
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,917
What did they
lock you up for?

676
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,391
Oh, they're just tryin'
to make somethin'
out of nothin'.

677
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,632
I met this gal
over in Big Springs,

678
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,030
and it turned out
she was married.

679
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,477
You're in here
'cause of that?

680
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,836
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that, but...

681
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,556
How'd you boys know
where to find me?

682
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,074
Miles Gillette.

683
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,279
Miles Gillette, huh?

684
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,755
Oh, Mac, I sure hope
you're still figurin'
on runnin' against him.

685
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,556
I'll swear that man's
been after my hide

686
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,916
for 30 years,
and he won't let up.

687
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,117
What did you ever do to him?

688
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,994
Nothin' serious.

689
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,478
I mean,
a man can't even bend the law
a little bit anymore.

690
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,951
Now, last time
you were in jail,
it was over a woman, too.

691
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,958
Judge's wife, I recall.

692
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,432
And there was shootin'.

693
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,234
Self defence.

694
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,275
Ain't you gettin'
a little old for that?

695
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,114
Uh, you mean gunplay?

696
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,634
No, I mean the other.

697
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,077
When I get too old for that,
they'll be shovellin' dirt
in my face.

698
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,720
How about this last woman?
Any shootin'?

699
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,038
No serious shootin'.

700
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,396
We just dropped by
to say hello.

701
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,869
Well, thanks.

702
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,156
Mac, we need him.

703
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,594
You heard what he said.

704
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,353
Yep, except we need him.

705
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,999
Well, that's fine.

706
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,312
Except,
how we gonna get him out?
I mean, it's a jail.

707
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,834
Got any ideas?

708
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,750
Yeah.

709

we gotta get out of here.

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,359
Come on, Uncle Jack.

713
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,553
Well, did you have to use
two sticks of dynamite?

[horse neighing]

00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,909
Hello, Kate.

Hello, Jack.

717
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,310
Brought your horse.

718
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,550
Oh, thank you.

719
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,915
Glad to see
you're still alive.

720
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,195
Well, thank you.

721
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,034

and these here grey hairs.

Well, I sure do appreciate
you boys bustin' me out.

I hope nobody back there
got a good look.

(Jack)
By the way, where we bound?

729
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,910
Mexico.

730
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,114
You do know
the country down there,
don't you?

731
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,475
I know more
about that country

732
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,438
than a jackrabbit
knows about runnin'.

goin' down there

that's gotta be a posse.

they're in a hurry.

have you been
tellin' us everything?

I mean,
by the way they're ridin',
you left out somethin'.

Yeah, it might be that fella
I shot over in Waco.

No, it's worse.

I don't want to hear anymore.

my chances of
runnin' for office are dead.

leadin' 'em.

What's he doin' along?

756
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,512
Maybe he heard you're fixin'
to run for sheriff.

757
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,354
Why is the Sheriff
of Big Springs
chasin' after you

758
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,079
for somethin'
you did in Waco?

759
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,152
Well, Mac, you know
how that old turkey's

760
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,152
had it in for me
all these years.

761
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,914
If you keep jawin',
they're gonna catch up to us.

762
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,879
No, because in a few hours
we'll be at the Rio Grande.

763
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,395
When we cross that,
we'll be in Mexico.

They're to transport
the grain and the prisoners
to the train.

are on that train.

Hey, Kate.

826
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,274
How did you manage
to get so friendly
with Frank King?

01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,760
What do you mean?

828

The two of you're engaged.

829
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,919
I'd say that's gettin'
pretty friendly.

I heard you were killed.

You always said
you'd wait for me.

Wait?

834
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,436
I waited for you
most of my life.

835
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,000
Like I said,
I heard you were dead.

836
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,673
Well, I ain't dead.

837
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,752
I never got word otherwise.

838
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,351

You know,
sometimes a man's gotta do--

01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,511
What he has to do.
Well, sometimes
a woman does, too

Dal Traven, not a martyr.

you always knew
I'd be comin' back.

How was I supposed to know?

I thought that's the way
it was meant to be.

01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,434
You thought?

847
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,352
Why didn't you ever ask me?

848
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,834
Ask you? Ask you what?

849

don't it?

Since I've been home,

861
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,075
I spend my time with the folks
helpin' with the ranch.

862
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,072
What about your schoolin'?

863
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,758
I figured
I'd pick that up again
when we get back.

864
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,912
Well, that's good to hear.

865
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,632
We Travens
got a lot of faults,

866
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,155
but bein' ignorant
ain't one of them.

867

Especially
havin' a big brother aimin'
to run for governor.

No. That just sounds good

So far, I'd say
you're doin' just fine.

I know those boys up there,
and I can ride in.

877

But they'll
probably shoot you.

878

they'd let pass through there

how you're gonna get
the rest of us in there

without us endin' up
in a funeral procession?

over here a little ways.

884

and say a prayer for you boys.

take up prayin'.

that ornery streak from Pa.

01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,835
Don't worry, Mac.

962
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,038
Even if they find me out,
they probably won't hurt me.

963
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,794
You didn't
answer my question.
What about you?

964
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,554
Goin' in there alone,
I mean, that's risky.

965
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,000
You always do that.

966
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,080
What?

967
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,589
Change the subject
when things get too close.

968
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,680
Oh.

969
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,720
[snickers]

970
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,520
You think
you got me figured out,
don't you?

971
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,000
Well, that's not
gonna work, see,

972
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,391
because
I'm not talkin' about me,
I'm talkin' about Dal.

973
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,400
Now, I think he's actin'
the way he is--

974
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,676
What is it
with you Traven boys?

975
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,120
Oh.

976
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,513
I got the feelin'
you're fixin'
to make a point.

977
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,994
Dal can't say how he feels
about a woman,
and you run from it.

978
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,594
I'm not runnin'.

979
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,832
I mean, Kate,
you know how it is.
You know...

980
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,638
Well, I am runnin',
I'm--I'm runnin' for sheriff.

981
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,278
There is no room
in my life right now
for a woman.

982
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,952
The trouble with you,
Mac Traven,
is you're gun-shy.

983
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,675
Well, let me put it this way.

984
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,071
Somebody like you comes along,

985
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,913
I might consider it.

986
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,874
Now cool down.

987
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,955

[birds chirping]

989
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,835
It's like
a damn hornet's nest
down there.

990
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,951
If you got a plan, Jack,
you better be
lettin' me in on it.

991
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,831
You know,
you never asked me
how I got this tequila.

992
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,356
How?

993
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,389
Stole it.

994
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,919
Just like I did this.

995
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,720
I got a plan.

996
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,840
Quit worryin' about
that woman, will you?

997
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,640
She's a tough one, and smart.
You know that.

998
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,518
And when the shootin' starts,

999
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,195
she'll be there
to look after the girls.

1000
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,519
We'll take care of her, Dal.
That's a promise.

1001
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,872
I'm gonna hold you to it.

1002
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,880
[hens clucking]

1003
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,674
You looking for someone?

1004
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,070
I heard at the mission
some women were brought in.

1005
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,753
I'd like to see them.

1006
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,071
This is not
a good place for you.

1007
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,992
Take me to them, please.

1008
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:19,955
Then come.

1009
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,720
How you boys doin'?

1010
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,393
Haven't seen you
for a while.

1011
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,279
Figured either
a lawman or a husband
finally got you.

1012
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,716
There's a few of them
chasin' me, I guess.

1013
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,916
Who's he?

1014
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,593
This is my nephew.

1015
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,953
(man)
Go on through.

1016
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,439
That wasn't too hard.

1017
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,355
Sister, will you pray for me?

1018
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,679
Of course, my child.

1019

I'm Sister Katherine.

1021
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,595
Uncle Jack,

1022
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:04,754
now I know you got a plan,
but don't you think
you ought to fill me in?

1023
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,957
Here, you might need this.

1024
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,640
Kate!

1025

Mac is here.
So's Jesse and Dal.

1027
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,595
You mean they're alive?

1028
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,273
They're goin' to get you
out of here.

[chain rattling]

1030
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,039
You're intruding, sir.

1031
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,634
I'm sorry, Sister.

1032
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:58,953
But I couldn't help noticing,
despite the habit,
that you're quite young.

1033
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,919
And now
I can't help wondering

1034
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,957
what you'd look like
without that outfit.

1035
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,839
I am a nun.
Have you no conscience?

1036
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,756
Not when
there's a profit in it.

No.

1042
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,312
You tell 'em, Uncle Jack.

What're they waitin' on?

1049
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,518
Jack said to wait
for his signal.

1050
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,920
What signal?

1051
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,912

I reckon
that's Uncle Jack's signal.

1057
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,433
I'll take
the one on the left.

Sorry, Sheriff,
can't do that.
We want Jack.

Now, I know why
you boys come down here.

Holiday Hammond
