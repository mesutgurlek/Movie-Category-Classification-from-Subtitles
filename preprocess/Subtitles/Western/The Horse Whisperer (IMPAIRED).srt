01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:51,942
When I work with a horse,
I like to know its history.

965
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:55,449
Most of the times a horse, in its
own way, can tell you the whole story,

966
01:30:55,517 --> 01:30:59,510
but sometimes they get so messed up in
their head that you need more to go on.

Now I don't know how you feel
about talkin' about it,

01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:05,619
and if you don't feel like it,
I understand,

969

what's goin' on in his head,

exactly what happened that day.

You know, not today.
Whenever you feel like it.

that was it.

right through me.

wife, but I wanted to give it a try.

1052

I thought she could give music lessons
to the kids in town-- the school--

and that our kids would grow up with

1217
01:54:02,197 --> 01:54:04,791
I've been waiting
for you to come back.

1218
01:54:06,868 --> 01:54:09,393
You hungry ?

1219
01:54:17,045 --> 01:54:22,073
Judith was, um,
telling me about this boy.

1220
01:54:22,150 --> 01:54:24,710
I never even got his name.

1221
01:54:27,689 --> 01:54:30,089
We were gonna go around
the railroad bridge.

1222
01:54:32,494 --> 01:54:37,625
We were laughing about something.
I don't know what.

1223
01:54:37,699 --> 01:54:40,793
And, um, her horse fell,

1224
01:54:40,869 --> 01:54:43,895
and Judith's foot
was caught in the stirrup.

1225
01:54:47,342 --> 01:54:51,642
And she was so scared.

1226
01:54:56,551 --> 01:55:01,511
And next I saw this truck
coming around the turn.

1227
01:55:06,695 --> 01:55:11,325
And it was honking,
trying to get us to move.

1228
01:55:11,399 --> 01:55:16,564
And l-- I tried
to grab her reins and...

1229
01:55:16,638 --> 01:55:21,234
to get her horse
to move out of the way.

1230
01:55:21,309 --> 01:55:24,767
And the truck
started to skid.

1231
01:55:28,249 --> 01:55:32,310
And there was no time
to do anything and--

1232
01:55:32,387 --> 01:55:34,878
It ran right into Judith.

1233
01:55:36,658 --> 01:55:40,856
And she just disappeared.

1234
01:55:47,202 --> 01:55:50,933
And then it came
at Pilgrim and me.

1235
01:55:51,006 --> 01:55:54,965
And Pilgrim reared up
at the truck.

1236
01:55:56,378 --> 01:55:59,074
And I fell off.

1237
01:56:03,418 --> 01:56:06,876
But Judith--
Oh, God, Judith.

But I will tell you
you didn't do anything wrong.

1242
01:56:36,636 --> 01:56:42,040
Same thing could have happened
to me or to Frank or to Joey.

1243
01:56:42,108 --> 01:56:47,136
And it doesn't make any sense to try
to figure out why these things happen.

1244
01:56:48,381 --> 01:56:52,818
There was a boy from
the Blackfeet reservation.

1245
01:56:52,885 --> 01:56:57,481
He used to do some work around here for
a while. Sixteen, strong kid, good kid.

1246
01:56:57,557 --> 01:56:59,548
He and I were
really, really good friends.

1247
01:56:59,625 --> 01:57:04,255
One day he went swimmin'
and dove headfirst into the lake.

1248
01:57:04,330 --> 01:57:10,098
Hit right into a rock
and snapped his neck.

1249
01:57:10,169 --> 01:57:12,262
Paralyzed him.

1250
01:57:12,338 --> 01:57:15,364
And after the accident,

1251
01:57:15,441 --> 01:57:20,003
I'd look in on him
from time to time.

1252
01:57:20,079 --> 01:57:22,104
But he wasn't there.

1253
01:57:22,181 --> 01:57:26,379
Like his mind, his spirit, whatever
you want to call it, just disappeared.

1254
01:57:29,055 --> 01:57:32,855
The only thing left
was just anger.

1255
01:57:32,925 --> 01:57:38,557
Sort of if the boy I once knew
just went somewhere else.

- Cambridge Monthly.

And I have two choices.

1520
02:33:55,209 --> 02:33:59,873
I can either fight
the way things are...

1521
02:33:59,947 --> 02:34:02,711
or accept them.

1522
02:34:03,784 --> 02:34:07,117
See, um,

1523
02:34:07,188 --> 02:34:10,919
I always knew
I loved you more.

1524
02:34:10,991 --> 02:34:13,585
Didn't bother me.

1525
02:34:13,661 --> 02:34:19,099
I guess I felt kind of lucky,
a little amazed that...

1526
02:34:19,166 --> 02:34:24,695
a woman like you would want
to be with a man like me.

1527
02:34:24,772 --> 02:34:27,832
And I guess I thought
if I could do everything right--

1528
02:34:27,908 --> 02:34:31,344
If I could-- If I was the best husband
I could be, the best father,

1529
02:34:31,412 --> 02:34:35,212
even being a good lawyer only mattered
because of what it meant for us.

1530
02:34:35,282 --> 02:34:39,616
If I could do all that,
it wouldn't make any difference...

1531
02:34:39,687 --> 02:34:43,851
if we loved each other
the same or not.

1532
02:34:43,924 --> 02:34:46,916
I didn't ask for more.

1533
02:34:46,994 --> 02:34:51,090
I told myself
I didn't need any more.

1534
02:34:51,165 --> 02:34:54,657
But...

1535
02:34:54,735 --> 02:35:00,401
the truth is, you don't
know how you feel about me.

1536
02:35:02,176 --> 02:35:06,442
You don't know if you want
a life with me anymore.

1537
02:35:08,949 --> 02:35:13,283
And the truth is...

1538
02:35:13,354 --> 02:35:16,380
I don't want you to come
home until you do know...

1539
02:35:18,792 --> 02:35:20,783
one way or the other.

1540
02:35:21,862 --> 02:35:23,796
Okay ?

1541
02:36:05,639 --> 02:36:08,506
- Thanks, Joe.
- Yep.

1542
02:36:15,950 --> 02:36:19,511
Bye, Annie.
Good luck to ya.

1543
02:36:19,586 --> 02:36:23,989
Thank you.
And you too.

1544
02:36:26,093 --> 02:36:28,391
All right, everybody in.
Frank, we all set ?

1545
02:36:28,462 --> 02:36:30,396
I believe so.

1546
02:36:30,464 --> 02:36:32,432
I can't believe he's
not here to say good-bye.

1547
02:36:32,499 --> 02:36:34,763
[ Frank ] Oh, he probably
got held up is all.

1548
02:36:34,835 --> 02:36:39,636
[ Diane ] No, sweetie, the truth is,
he's not real good at good-byes.

1549
02:36:39,707 --> 02:36:43,643
You know, come to think of it,
not too good at hellos either.

1550
02:36:43,711 --> 02:36:45,838
- You ready ?
- Just a second.

1551
02:36:49,483 --> 02:36:51,883
- Mmm !
- When will you be home ?

1552
02:36:51,952 --> 02:36:55,581
- Oh, in a few days.
- I'll miss you.

1553
02:36:55,656 --> 02:36:58,750
Well, if I get lost, you know
where to send the search party.

1554
02:36:58,826 --> 02:37:02,523
- Could be just about anywhere.
- [ Chuckles ]

1555
02:37:02,596 --> 02:37:04,689
I'll call you, okay ?

[ Gate Creaks, Closes ]

1559
02:39:43,423 --> 02:39:47,519
He goin' back inside the trailer
or runnin' alongside it ?

1560
02:39:57,771 --> 02:40:00,103
I just wanted to be here
when you left.

1561
02:40:03,076 --> 02:40:05,567
I don't want to leave you.

1562
02:40:05,646 --> 02:40:08,638
I don't want you to.

1563
02:40:08,715 --> 02:40:13,379
[ Crying ]
Just a few more days.

1564
02:40:15,355 --> 02:40:19,758
- And then ?
- Oh.

1565
02:40:27,801 --> 02:40:29,735
Why did this happen ?

1566
02:40:32,005 --> 02:40:34,599
I don't ask
those questions, Annie.

1567
02:40:34,675 --> 02:40:36,609
And I didn't ask
to love you, but I do.

1568
02:40:36,677 --> 02:40:41,171
- Oh !
- I'll always have that with me.

1569

Tom.

1570
02:40:58,165 --> 02:41:02,465
Can we go for
one last ride, hmm ?

1571
02:41:05,272 --> 02:41:10,195
Yeah. I'll saddle 'em up.
