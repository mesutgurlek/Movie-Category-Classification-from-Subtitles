1
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:35,641
[Cowhand Shouting] Yah! Giddap!
[Cow Mooing]

2
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:41,314
Yah! Yah!

3
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:43,716
Glyn, have a biscuit.

4
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:50,354
Giddap there!

5
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:53,623
Hah! Giddap! Yah!

6
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,128
Whoa! Whoa!

7
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:03,569
Whoa! Whoa!

8
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:08,205
This is good.
Bring 'em up for a nightcap.

9
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:10,508
Hello, funny face. Hey.

10
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,378
Eat a good biscuit.
Mrs. Prentiss made it.

11
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:15,713
I make better.
[Chuckling]

12
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:19,346
I don't know how much better,
but I will say they're harder.

13
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:22,880
We got three hours left in
the day. Why don't we keep on?

14
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,894
We got water here.
May pay out by night.

15
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:29,557
Marjie promised to scrub out
a shirt for me. I did not!

16
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:32,726
I didn't promise.
I said maybe.

17
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:36,294
Bring it to the wagon. I'll
scrub it out, but I won't like it.

18
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:38,465
All right.
Why not?

19
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:42,477
Your mother used to scrub ten
shirts. Twenty! And pants too.

20
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:44,775
He hasn't got ten.
Have you?

21
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:48,045
No. One on, one off,
one in the wash.

22
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:51,211
Make your circle right near
to the stream there.

23
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:54,222
Think I'll ride out
for a couple of hours.

24
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,056
Might be an easy trail
past the hills.

25
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:02,360
Yah! Hah!

26
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,917
Yah! Hah! Hah!
[Cows Mooing]

27
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:45,799
You stole a horse. Anything
to say? Cut him loose!

28
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:49,704
Drop your guns.

29
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:52,577
All right, untie him.

30
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,054
Come on over there!
Move!

31
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:19,266
[Neighing]

32
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:50,538
[Sighing]
Ah!

33
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:55,043
About this horse, I really didn't
steal him, if that makes any difference.

34
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:57,011
It doesn't.

35
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,312
That's what I thought.
Why did you step in?

36
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,046
Well, I just
don't like hangin's.

37
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,884
That's a funny thing. I
don't either. [Chuckling]

38
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:09,823
You ridin' south?
No, I'm goin' north.

39
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,884
Takin' some folks up in
the Columbia River country.

40
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,726
Farmers. Real nice folks.
Yeah, settlers, huh?

41
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:18,858
Is that your trade,
a guide?

42
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:21,165
No, not exactly.

43
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,001
I've been doin'
a lot of things.

44
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:28,442
I ran into these folks in Missouri. Thought
I might try my hand at farmin' or ranchin'...

45
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:31,674
if I can find me
some cattle.

46
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,979
They make good biscuits, these
folks. You're gonna like 'em.

47
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:38,646
I didn't catch your name,
or did you say it?

48
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:41,781
McLyntock.
Glyn McLyntock.

49
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:44,258
Glyn McLyntock?

50
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:46,557
From the Missouri country?

51
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:49,291
That's right.
You're gonna go farmin'?

52
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:52,801
Or ranchin', if I can
get me some cattle.

53
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,871
Come on, let's get
those biscuits.

54
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,028
I thought we're out of Cheyenne
country. What do ya make of that?

55
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:24,328
Shoshone. Real mean
when they wanna be.

56
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,836
Lately, they wanna be. They cut up some
trappers last week for their rifles.

57
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:30,338
Your people got any rifles? Mm-hmm.

58
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:32,840
They know how to use 'em? No.

59
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:36,345
How'd you get out of the Black Hills
country and the Big Horn? Lucky.

60
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:38,846
Glyn, you're late!

61
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:43,011
You better get some supper before
Marjie eats it all. [Chuckling]

62
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:47,579
Got beans, tea
and biscuits.

63
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,354
Soft ones this time. Those
biscuits I was telling you about.

64
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:54,362
I see you found
yourself a friend.

65
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,456
I found him hangin'
around. [Chuckling] Yeah.

66
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:00,559
I guess I missed your name,
or did you say it?

67
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:02,627
Cole.
Emerson Cole.

68
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:07,699
You'reJeremy Baile.
Glyn told me about you.

69
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:12,146
Are you, eh... you
Emerson Cole of Kansas way?

70
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:17,814
Yeah.

71
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:21,482
Yeah, you're gonna
like these biscuits.

72
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:24,924
Oh, Laura? Laura,
this is Emerson Cole here.

73
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:28,430
He's hungry. Give him
something to eat, will ya?

74
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,002
Say, I was thinking
about tomorrow.

75
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,336
We can save a lot of miles
if we go straight north.

76
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:42,844
Now, this place we're headed
for, 150 miles east from Portland.

77
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:45,847
That's right. That's just over
that tall mountain, isn't it?

78
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:51,012
That's right, just over. Well,
you say we should go here.

79
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:54,022
Uh-huh. I think we should go so.

80
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,025
You could go so,
but that mountain there...

81
00:07:57,093 --> 00:08:00,028
that tall fella with
the white hair, he...

82
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,530
he's about
two miles high.

83
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,734
Got a lot of hills around him
one mile high...

84
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:10,238
so you climb and climb...
Just one mile? Is that too bad?

85
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:13,241
It isn't very good
when it's straight up.

86
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:16,073
You got the food
to think about.

87
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:19,842
By the time you get your grounds
cleared and houses built, it'd be winter.

88
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,875
If you haven't arranged to have the supplies
sent from Portland, what are you gonna eat?

89
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:27,548
It was just an idea. A lot
of people had the same idea.

90
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:31,559
Most of them are still up there
under the snow. [Bird Singing]

91
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:42,670
Glyn, where you been? Up in the hills.

92
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:45,172
There you are.

93
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:54,011
You've been eating this food all
the way from Missouri? Mm-hmm.

94
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:58,179
Wearin' the same shirt too. I said I'd
scrub it, but I can't with you in it.

95
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:02,020
Well, I'm not in this
one. [Bird Singing]

96
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:05,857
Night birds. I haven't
heard them before.

97
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:10,228
They're sort of a special kind.
They live up in the hills.

98
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,700
Redwing orioles. Yeah,
redwing orioles from Canada.

99
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:16,602
Yeah, from Canada.
From, uh... [Bird Cawing]

100
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:20,804
[Bird Singing]
They're sort of plaintive.

101
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:24,312
I hope they nest
near our farm.

102
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,575
Don't you like them?

103
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,944
No, no,
not for neighbors.

104
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:35,455
Laura, Mrs. Prentiss got a lot of
boiling water. What about the shirt?

105
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:39,119
You're a nuisance. And I'm sorry for
your wife, whoever she's going to be.

106
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:42,096
What, because
I like a clean shirt?

107
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,099
Get up from there.
I wanna do my chores.

108
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,601
Always point this
toward the North Star.

109
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,764
Where is it?
There we are.

110
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,775
Then come morning,
we know where we're going.

111
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,141
Is that the way you travel? Always.

112
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:59,010
But I never pick
the same star.

113
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:02,414
Tomorrow, it might be
that big fat one there.

114
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:05,750
The next day, I might take a
fancy to that skinny one there.

115
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:07,721
[Laura Chuckling]

116
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,224
I'll tell her.
She's my sister.

117
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:15,529
Nice girl, that.
Yeah, real nice.

118
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:18,192
Your girl?

119
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:20,531
No.
[Bird Singing]

120

[Chirping]

121

[Cawing]

122
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,973
Yeah, redwing
orioles.

123
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,778
Mm-hmm, from Canada, huh? [Cawing]

124
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,342
How many do you figure?
Oh, about six or ten.

125
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:41,913
If they were a big war party,
they'd have come barging in before this.

126
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,926
You ever tangle with
any? Yeah, a time or two.

127
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:47,189
That was with Martinson
up on the Snake.

128
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:49,595
[Screaming]

[Gunshots] [Man] Take cover!

134
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:09,808
All right, Glyn,
I'll take care of her.

135
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:12,319
[Gunshots]

136
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:18,016
Come on, get under the
wagons! Get under the wagons!

137
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,029
Stop shootin' at
moonbeams! Hold your fire!

138
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:25,659
Hold your fire 'til you can see what you're
shootin' at. [Chuckling] Which they won't.

139
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:32,530
They're using that for cover,
beyond the stream. It seems like it.

140
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,544
Keep an eye on 'em, will ya?
Don't let 'em waste any more lead.

141
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,046
Are you gonna
go after 'em?

142
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,551
That's better than them
coming in after us.

143
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,515
[Groans] No need for
you to go out there.

144
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,923
I know it.

145

[/ndian Cawing]

146
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:24,392
I'll move in. You
try and call one up.

[Whispering] Five of'em. Less one.

[Horse Neighing]

[Cawing] Stay here.

And two hours rest
at noon.

What about the Shoshones?
They might come back.

164

I doubt it. Indians or
not, I want a smooth road.

Good morning.

Say, about that shirt,
I'm sorry.

170
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:24,859
Why? It needed scrubbing.
Did you find it? Mm-hmm.

Well, thanks!
That's real nice of you.

What with the excitement
and everything, I thought it...

173
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:33,364
Uh-oh. Oop! It was in the bucket
I used to put out the fire.

174
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:36,199
I'm afraid it's
a little scorched.

175
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:41,072
Yes, slightly. You can put out
fires with sand too, you know.

176
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,805
Well, Laura, five, six days,
we'll be in Portland.

177
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:46,905
We'll take a nice, easy trail and
go slow. Think you can take it?

178
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,746
I'll take it.

No, I picked out
another star last night.

hanging over California.

for you, funny face.

along. I'm not much at farmin'.

Uh-huh.

Well, I'll be seein' ya.

Yah! Yah!

198
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,961
Course, you could swing west along the
Columbia River, head down the coast.

199
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,336
That's what I figured.

200
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,899
About this business of ranchin', are
you sure you're gonna go through with it?

Very sure.

I don't get it. Who're
you running away from?

the name of Glyn McLyntock.

Well, what happens when
he catches up with you?

206
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:42,861
I don't think he's going to catch up
with me. He died on the Missouri border.

207
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:47,800
You're wrong. He'll catch up with
ya one of these days. [Laughing]

Does the old gentleman
know about you? Nope.

00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,374
Want me to tell you what'll
happen when he finds out?

210

find out for myself. [Laughing]

see you. Where do you hail from?

Missouri. Hear you have some
good farmin' country upriver.

226
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:18,154
Greatest country in the world. It's
wide open and yours for the taking.

How much of a drive? Two, three weeks,
but I can cut that in half for you.

228
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:26,390
I can take you upriver as far as the
rapids in my steamer. Think you can make it?

can try. I'm Tom Hendricks.

We ran into
some Shoshones.

Jeremy's daughter caught an arrow.
It's up high, but it's pretty painful.

in no time at all.

Part of the head's still in it.

If you can point to it,
it ain't serious.

250
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:46,914

fall out by itself in due time.

Never should've left
the Mississippi.

About that arrow,
just leave it alone!

It's not me, it's a lady,
over there in the first wagon.

to the Hendricks place.

Yes? Fetch me a clean set of cuffs.

You can trust him.
He's all right.

themselves comfortable.

And our supplies?
I have them listed here.

Flour, sugar, salt. Enough to
carry you through the winter.

276
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,256
You'll send them to us in the
fall? The first week of September.

277
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:08,353
By that time, you'll have your
ground cleared and houses built.

And you can scare up some
cattle for us? I'm sure I can.

00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:27,100
Aunt Tildy'll take care of her as
though she were her own daughter.

303
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:30,303
Go about your business. What you know
about taking care of little girls?

304
00:25:30,378 --> 00:25:33,905
I been taking care of Captain
Mello for 40 years or more.

305
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:35,916
Go on!
Go on.

306
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:38,919
She'll be all right.
I'll take her upriver...

307
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:42,218
when I bring your supplies
next September.

308
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,860
Hurts, doesn't it?
Yes.

309
00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:59,104
You know, sometimes
it's good to cry a little.

to dance a little too.

/t's funny how a man's face
will stick in your mind.

315
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:21,227
I could swear
we've met before.

316
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:24,231
If we did, I'm sure
it was a friendly meeting.

317
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:27,632
Did you say you were from
Kansas? I didn't say...

318
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:31,160
but I am. Let's have a little
punch before it's all gone.

319
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:33,901
Marjie, would you care
for some? I'd love some.

320
00:26:33,975 --> 00:26:36,068
Thank you. Glyn. Thank you.

321
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:38,977
May / buy you gentlemen
a drink?

322
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:44,246
Well, that's right
friendly of you, stranger.

323
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:47,311
Are you a gambling man? I am.

324
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:50,153
You figure to stay in Portland? I do.

325
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:54,491
Sorry to disappoint you, but Don
handles all the gambling in town.

326
00:26:54,562 --> 00:26:59,022
Then perhaps you can accommodate me.
I have time for a few hands of poker.

327
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,036
Oh, Glyn, I think this is
our dance. Oh, oh, excuse me.

328
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:06,767
But if you're too busy
to dance with me now...

329
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:09,708
I'd be happy to wait
until you're free.

330
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:12,872
Uh, well, perhaps our friend
would like to have my dance.

331
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:14,938
Marjie, may I
present Mr...

Shall we dance?

00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:26,784
Uh, later,
if you please.

336
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:31,298
I have some business with these
gentlemen. Well, I hope you lose!

337
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:36,565
Now, about those few hands
of poker. If you wish.

338
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:44,378
Marjie, I didn't mean
to be rude over there.

This is my dance
though, you know.

Yes, it is.

Well, come on,
let's, let's, let's go then.

00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:05,296
Right handsome fella
there, isn't he?

Like me, for instance.

Oh, you're very handsome,
in an elderly sort of way.

In an elderly...
Yeah.

please? How's that? Oh!

[Snaps Finger]
Now I remember.

353
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:44,470
There was a killin' in Kansas
at the Trail's End Saloon.

354
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:49,533
You were one of
the Missouri border raiders.

355
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:51,943
I'll take mine
from the top.

356
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:54,573
You got it
from the top.

357
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:59,086
That last one came from the
bottom. It's the deuce of spades.

358
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:03,319
You're a liar!

359
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:14,001
You're real fast with that
gun, kid, but you're soft.

00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:16,161
Someday it'll kill ya.

361
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:19,832
You sure the kid was right about
that card? Yeah. I knew Grundy.

362
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:22,342
Is that why
you killed him?

363
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,504
Or was it because
he knew you?

Is them apple trees?
Yes!

367
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:55,674
These are plums.
These are pears. All different.

We'll have the finest fruit
in all the world upriver.

369
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:02,706
Them ain't apple trees. I seen
an apple tree when I was a kid.

370
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:05,548
It was as big as a house.

Good-bye. Decided to
stay in Portland, huh?

375
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:19,294
For a while. Then I thought
I'd drift on down to California.

Still followin' that star?

377

Sometimes it's better than having
a man with a star following you.

I'll see ya.

Don't forget, you're coming
up to see me. If I have time.

Well, it looks like we might
have a romance in the making.

I don't like that man Cole. Why not?

384
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:48,762
I heard Grundy say he was a
raider on the Missouri border.

385
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,823
Lots of people used to raid.
Some of them decided to change.

That kind can't change.

or it'll spoil the whole

Beautiful, aren't they?

405
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:47,740
Those are the ones you wanted to drive
over in the wagon. We'd have made it.

406
00:32:47,815 --> 00:32:50,909
Oh, sure. Of course, this way is easier.

407
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:54,580
How far upriver can we
go? Another 40, 50 miles.

408
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:57,090
Then we come
to the rapids?

409
00:32:57,158 --> 00:33:01,322
No way of getting the boat past,
unless you take it apart and carry it.

- You sure you don't want me to do that too?
- Never you mind!

411

Someday we'll have a portage past the
rapids, and boats on the upper river.

412

Keep her in closer to the bank! Why?

413
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:17,969
It's better goin'. I came this way in a
canoe, and we stayed close to the bank.

414

This ain't no canoe!

This is as far as you can go.

[Jeremy Chuckling]
Yeah, / see what you mean.

418
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,115
But the wagons will take us
around the rapids.

419
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,916
In a day or two, you'll see
some of the finest country...

00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:07,859
God ever put on
the face of this planet.

421
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:13,465
It's what I've always
dreamed about, Glyn...

422
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:16,970
a new country where
we can make things grow.

423
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:20,530
[Jeremy] We'll find a valley
where the earth is rich...

424
00:34:20,608 --> 00:34:23,873
where the mountains shelter us
from the north winds.

425
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:27,210
We'll use the trees
that nature has given us...

426
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:29,875
cut a clearing
in the wilderness.

427
00:34:29,951 --> 00:34:32,044
We'll put in roads...

428
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,556
and use the timber to bridge
the streams where we have to.

429
00:34:35,623 --> 00:34:38,387
Hah! Then we'll build our homes, Glyn,;

430
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:42,225
build them strong to stand
against the winter snows.

431
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:44,730
There'll be
a meeting house...

432
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:47,063
a church.

433
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:49,569
We'll have a school.

434
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:52,128
Then we'll put down seedlings.

435
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:54,902
There'll be apples, pears.

436
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:57,911
/n a few years, we'll bring
fruit to the world...

437
00:34:57,979 --> 00:35:01,415
such as the eyes of man
has never seen.

438
00:35:06,154 --> 00:35:08,179
All of this is good...

439
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:12,852
but it'll all be for nothing unless we get
enough food to carry us through the winter.

440
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:16,363
I've been watching the snow clouds
forming over those mountains.

441
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,263
In a few weeks,
we'll be iced in.

442
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:22,166
It's bad, Glyn, bad.

443
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,999
I'm worried. Any word from Portland?

444
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:30,100
None at all. Those supplies were
supposed to be here in September.

445
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:33,477
And here it is,
the middle of October.

446
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,951
Come to the end of the flour.
Another week, no more bacon and beans.

447
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:40,453
No more nothin'
in two weeks.

448
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:43,490
I hadn't realized it was that
bad. No use worryin' you men.

449
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:47,858
You have your work to do. Captain Mello
may be havin' trouble with that steamboat.

450
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:50,022
Hendricks should've
let us know.

451

Afraid not. There's a settlement
around river. We're headed that way.

What happened to our food? Yeah, Hendricks
promised to have it at the camp this week.

We paid him ten times what it
was worth. Hendricks is dead.

enough to carry us 'til spring. What'll we do?

Winter in Portland? Do you
know what that means in money?

doesn't trust Cole.

819
01:04:57,043 --> 01:05:02,242

once a man has gone wrong, that's the end.

worried about?

should say, he knows who you were.

Does he know who you were? No.

What happens
when he finds out?

01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:30,191
Maybe by that time he'll find
out I'm right. You're not right!

840
01:06:30,269 --> 01:06:34,899

a fool to lug all this food to the settlement.

After you get it there, what happens?
They pay you off with a big "thank you."

842

Later they find out that you're the McLyntock
that used to raid along the Missouri border...

843
01:06:43,315 --> 01:06:45,283
and then they kick you out. Maybe.

or a "thank you" somebody'll take back.

846
01:06:57,396 --> 01:07:00,627
Could be they won't
take it back.

847
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:04,329
If they don't, I figure that's
worth more than $100,000.

Get out of there!

1045
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,006
[Screams]

1046
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:28,087
Let's get out of here!

1047
01:28:57,815 --> 01:29:00,875
I'm sorry, Glyn.
Did the rope burn your neck?

1048
01:29:04,655 --> 01:29:08,648
[Chuckles]
No, you didn't do that, Trey.

1049
01:29:08,726 --> 01:29:12,218
That's been there
for quite a while.

1050
01:29:12,296 --> 01:29:15,925
Since you were a raider
on the Missouri-Kansas border?

1051
01:29:20,038 --> 01:29:23,201
And some vigilantes
tried to hang a gunman.

1052
01:29:25,343 --> 01:29:28,073
Just one of those
rotten apples?

1053
01:29:29,847 --> 01:29:32,281
I was wrong.

1054
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:35,911
There is a difference
between apples and men.

1055
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:39,320
Really, there is.

1056
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:41,585
[Chuckles]

1057
01:29:51,102 --> 01:29:53,832
[People Shouting]

1058
01:30:00,011 --> 01:30:02,002
Jeremy!

1059
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,947
Good man, Jeremy!
I knew you'd do it!

1060
01:30:05,016 --> 01:30:08,543
You're talkin' to the wrong man.
See the fellow in the third wagon.

1061
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,558
Whoa! Then you did come up to see me.

1062
01:30:18,629 --> 01:30:21,427
[Chuckles] Just for a visit.
I had nothing else to do.

1063
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:24,127
Oh.

1064
01:30:24,202 --> 01:30:28,332
Hey, wait a minute!
Marjie! Marjie, my darling.

1065
01:30:28,406 --> 01:30:32,866
Good boy, Trey.
Get out of here, you two. Go on.

1066
01:30:34,445 --> 01:30:37,539
Whoa. Whoa!
Glyn.

1067
01:30:37,615 --> 01:30:40,015
Thank you.

1068
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:54,760
Hah! Come on!
