338
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,520
Sure, he struck it.

339
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,520
A lot of good it'll do him...

340
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,520
sittin' on a pile of gold...

341
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,880
moanin' for his two-timin' fiancée.

342
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,040
$1 million?

343
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,160
Yes.

344
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,520
Ah.

345
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,040
I never met a woman yet...

346
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,040
that was half
as reliable as a horse.

347
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,040
Please, sir, this way out.

348
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,560
The back door.

349
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,360
I never use it.

350
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,360
Another thing about Alaska...

351
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,000
The polar bear.

352
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,520
He can go six months
without any attentions.

353
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,680
No.

354
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,520
After six months...

355
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,520
a polar bear gets
a little nervous...

356
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,040
and starts clawin'
his fellow animals to death.

357
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,560
It's the same way
with gold miners.

358
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,040
Oh, yeah!

359
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,200
Reinforcements,
that's what we like!

360
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,240
Plenty of reinforcements.

361
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,040
Keep 'em comin'!

362
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,720
Sit down, missy.

363
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,600
I still have one unoccupied knee.

364
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,120
You have a snooty look, missy.

365
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,120
I don't like dames
with snooty looks.

366
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,280
One female today
broke my partner's heart.

367
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,800
You're not helping me
forget it.

368
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,320
I'm sorry your heart is broken.

369
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,200
We're good doctors,
aren't we, girls?

370
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Not my heart, George Pratt's.

371
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,320
Broken right down the middle
by a fickle dame.

372
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,320
Let me be your doctor.

373
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,000
I should have seen...

374
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,320
you're not the kind of man...

375
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,160
that'd let a woman
break his heart.

376
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,000
You're too tall and too strong.

377
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,480
That accent.
Where did you get it?

378
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,840
Sorry you don't like my speech.

379
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,840
I didn't say that.

380
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,440
Is it put-on or natural?

381
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
But it's natural.
I'm French.

382
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,320
Yes, she is French.

383
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,840
Pipe down.
I'm tryin' to think.

384
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,320
Real French, eh?

385
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,360
Not like phonies we get in Nome?

386
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,840
I'll give you $50
for a straight answer.

387
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,840
Girls, he's all yours.

388
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,840
Good night, monsieur.

389
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,840
Mess-soor! That does it!

390
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,360
Bye-bye.

391
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,280
Hey, hold on.
Where are you going?

392
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,800
Let go.

393
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,280
Snooty, too.

394
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,280
George will like that.

395
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,840
Let me go.
You're hurting me.

396
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,800
I want to talk business.

397
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,320
Good night, ladies.

398
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,320
Here you are
for being nice girls...

399
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,320
and showing your legs.

400
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,200
March 'em out, Irving.

401
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,800
Thank you.

402
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,800
And, Irving,
tell the management...

403
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,320
I'm through shopping
for the night.

404
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,800
You've got a lot
of drinking to catch up on.

405
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,840
French... the real thing,
just like you.

406
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,320
I'm savin' a life,
that's all I know.

407
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,320
Maybe, but you don't
make any sense...

408
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,840
which is all right...

409
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,840
because if you're
too drunk to talk...

410
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,840
we'll do something else.

411
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,160
Perfect.
You sound like a wife.

412
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,840
I don't consider that
a compliment.

413
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,840
I'm on your side, lady.

414
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,280
That's my only politics...
anti-wife.

415
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,280
Any woman who makes
one man miserable...

416
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,280
instead of a lot of men happy...

417
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,280
don't get my vote.

418
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,280
Sit down.

419
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,280
Thank you.

420
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,640
What's your name?

421
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,800
I'm called Angel.

422
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,680
Sounds dangerous.
What else?

423
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,640
Michelle.
Michelle Bonnet.

424
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,880
And you?

425
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,680
Sam McCord.

426
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,480
Sam McCord,
I drink to you...

427
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,320
because I can always
tell when I like a man.

428
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,320
First by my fingers.

429
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,440
They get warm.

430
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,320
Feel.

431
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,880
Second...

432
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,920
When he's willing to act
like a gentleman...

433
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,920
for a few minutes.

434
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,320
Do you know,
when I was leaving before...

435
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,320
I was only pretending.

436
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,320
I was going to
come back and try again.

437
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Look, I've got
a proposition to make.

438
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,000
Naturally.

439
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,440
Have you ever been to Alaska?

440
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,600
Oh, no, too cold for my type.

441
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,160
I'm from New Orleans,
where it's always warm.

442
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,280
You're about the right size.

443
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,800
You have second sight, I see.

444
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,800
Try this on.

445
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,640
Here?

446
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,280
Don't you think...

447
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,640
there is too many distractions?

448
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,640
But if you wish.

449
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,760
I meant just try it for size.

450
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,800
Mr. McCord,
you're wasting your time.

451
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,600
I'm selling, not buying.

452
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,600
How would you
like this stuff free...

453
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,600
and half a gold mine
to go with it?

454
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,440
Just say the word.

455
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,960
What word?

456
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,440
Just a little old yes,
and it's yours.

457
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,240
You're fooling me.

458
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,960
I was never more serious
in my life.

459
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,960
I'm savin' a human being...

460
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,480
best pal a fellow ever had.

461
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,400
Nobody's ever given me...

462
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,920
anything as nice as this before.

463
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,080
A Frenchy broke George's heart...

464
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,200
a Frenchy can fix it.

465
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,240
I'll tell you a secret.

466
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,560
I'm shaking from head to foot...

467
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,400
because it finally happened.

468
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,400
Instead of jumping
into the bay...

469
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,560
I'm jumping into a gold mine...

470
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,360
and, mister, am I going to jump!

471
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,920
I mean, you really
want me to go...

472
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,920
to Alaska with you?

473
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,920
Just say the word.

474
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,440
Yes!

475
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,080
Yes, yes, yes!

476
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,440
Come right this way,
Mr. Nordquist.

477
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,440
He's right in here.

478
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,960
Sam, come up for air!

479
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,440
Lars Nordquist, you old coot!

480
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,440
How are you?

481
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,640
I'm fine.
How are you?

482
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,440
Shame on you...

483
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,960
hangin' around a place like this.

484
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,440
Where else will I hang around...

485
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,960
when I'm looking for Sam McCord?

486
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,960
I heard you hit gold in Alaska.

487
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,400
Big.

488
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,400
I'm so happy for you!

489
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,880
You hit pretty good here, too.

490
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,560
This is...
What's that last name?

491
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,400
Michelle Bonnet.

492
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,400
Angel's easier.

493
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,400
This is Lars,
my old loggin' boss.

494
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,920
Hello, Mr. Lars.

495
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,400
Shake hands.
Your wife ain't lookin'.

496
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,920
How is Lena?

497
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,240
Still hittin' you
with rollin' pins?

498
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,080
She's slowing down.

499
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,920
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

500
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,920
She's crazy to
see you again.

501
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,560
What are you doin' in Seattle?

502
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,600
The whole gang is here...

503
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,440
for the loggers' picnic.

504
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,760
We heard you were in town.

505
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,600
Everybody starts hollering...

506
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,600
You can't have a picnic
without Sam.

507
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,920
Come on!

508
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,440
Well, uh...

509
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,920
Go on, Mr. McCord.

510
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,960
I'll give you my address...

511
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,440
in case you want
to see me again.

512
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,440
The name is Sam,
and we're goin' to Alaska.

513
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,440
Pick up your trousseau,
and let's go.

514
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,720
I don't know where to begin.

515
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,240
Let's start here.

516
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,920
Oh, it's such
a lovely suit, Sam...

517
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,920
and it fits so perfectly.

518
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,920
Everything...
the shoes, the hat.

519
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,400
I hope I look all right.

520
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,400
You look great, eh, Lars?

521
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,920
Sure, sure.

522
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,920
What's the matter?
You lost your laugh.

523
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,440
No. Ha ha ha!

524
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,600
Lena!

525
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,440
Oh!

526
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,920
Hey!

527
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,440
Sam McCord!

528
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,920
Lena!

529
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,440
Ha ha ha!

530
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,280
You crazy Sam!
Ha ha ha!

531
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
That's my wife.

532
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,280
I bet you I know
where Lars find you.

533
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,720
Some crazy, no-good place.

534
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,720
I told Lars,
You go find Sam...

535
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,720
but you don't fool around...

536
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,400
with any of
those fancy girls.

537
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,400
I split your head open...

538
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,240
Who is that woman?

539
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,480
Lars, I told...

540
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,400
Wait, Lena.
That's my friend.

541
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,200
I brought her along.

542
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,880
She's no friend.
I know!

543
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,400
Stop that howl.
Show some manners.

544
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,320
I want you
to meet my friend Angel.

545
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,520
Come on, she won't bite.

546
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,920
Go on.

547
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,000
My old friend Lena Nordquist.

548
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,560
How do you do, Mrs. Nordquist?

549
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,400
There's nothing to fear.

550
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,240
She's half-human.

551
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,480
Ha ha ha!

552
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,440
It looks like
a very nice picnic.

553
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,440
I'll just sit down
on the grass.

554
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,600
You ain't sittin'
on any grass here.

555
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,920
You don't have
to say any more.

556
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,760
No, you don't have to.

557
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,480
Where are you going?

558
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,440
Where I belong.

559
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,440
You belong with me.

560
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,880
I thought we were invited
to a picnic...

561
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,080
not an uprising...

562
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,360
of nutty wives
with war paint...

563
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,800
which I'm not interested
in attending.

564
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
We bid you good-bye...

565
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,880
and are sorry
you find us unfit...

566
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,800
to sit on your lousy grass.

567
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,880
Lena!
He's leaving!

568
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,240
Sam!

569
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,400
What?

570
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,400
Sam, wait a minute.

571
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,880
You're pigheaded,
no good...

572
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,040
but you can't help it...

573
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,880
just because no decent women...

574
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,080
Iook at you for two seconds.

575
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,720
If you care to stay,
it's all right.

576
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,800
Her, too.

577
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,960
Well, that invitation's
kind of uncordial.

578
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
I got a bad temper.

579
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,920
Well, so have I.

580
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,920
How about you, Angel?

581
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,440
Well, uh...

582
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,920
I...

583
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,840
I'm kind of hungry, Sam.

584
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,920
We got lots to eat.

585
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,440
Barbecued pork, if you like it.

586
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,040
I love it.

587
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,680
Thank you.

588
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,200
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. Nordquist?

589
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,360
What'll you have,
a wing or a leg?

590
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,400
The apple.

591
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,880
{y:i}Attention!

592
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,400
{y:i}All the men
{y:i}in the log-rolling contest...

593
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,880
{y:i}please report to the committee now!

594
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,120
Are you taking part
in any games?

595
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,720
If there's
a wife-strangling contest...

596
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,480
I might join that.

597
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,920
Ha ha ha!

598
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,920
All wives are the same.

599
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,920
Someone comes near
their husband...

600
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,080
and off they go
like burglar alarms.

601
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,080
Well, what I can't stand...

602
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,080
is when people
look down on others...

603
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,400
who aren't doin' 'em any harm.

604
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,920
Sam, you cannot change the world...

605
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,920
and it's so nice here...

606
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,680
and that's enough.

607
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,240
You're good medicine.

608
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,440
Thank you.

609
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,560
Refill?

610
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,200
Yes...

611
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,240
but not too much, eh?

612
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,840
Be right back.

613
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,440
Ang!

614
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,280
Don't you remember me?

615
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,960
I'm Ollie the logger.

616
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,440
Please go away.

617
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,440
I was going to come
see you tonight.

618
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,960
No. I said please go away.

619
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,480
Nobody's looking.

620
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,960
I said go away!

621
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,840
No!

622
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,440
Go away!

623
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,960
Help!

624
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,600
Ha ha ha!

625
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,880
Oh!

626
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,920
Let me go!

627
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,080
Brought you some coffee, too.

628
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,920
Thank you.

629
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,440
Sit down?

630
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,440
Yes.

631
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,960
Wasn't that man
a friend of yours?

632
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,440
Sure. Still is...

633
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,440
or will be
when he sobers up.

634
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,280
Why did you do it, then?

635
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,800
Habit, I guess.

636
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,800
A fella gets sore and...

637
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,800
Haven't you had a fella
fight over you before?

638
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,440
Over me, yes...

639
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,560
but never for me.

640
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,800
Well, I guess I got sore,
that's all.

641
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,760
Why did you get sore?

642
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,320
How do I know?

643
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,960
A fella gets sore,
that's all.

644
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,960
Works it off, that's all.

645
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,800
Hey, Sam!

646
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,800
Sam, Jensen is so drunk...

647
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,760
he can't enter
the pole-climbing contest.

648
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,760
You got to help me.

649
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,760
Yeah!

650
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,240
I got a bet with Oscar!

651
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,760
Me, too!

652
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,760
Climb a pole,
or I lose my shirt!

653
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,440
I haven't had spurs on
for who knows how long!

654
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,080
It'll be like yesterday!

655
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,760
Or early this morning!

656
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,280
You might still
lose your shirt.

657
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,760
I'll take a chance on you.

658
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,760
You ever seen a man
climb a pole?

659
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,920
No.

660
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,040
Looks like I'm hooked.

661
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,960
Sam, come on!

662
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,280
Oh!

663
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,920
[Band Plays Camptown Races]

664
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,280
Whee!

665
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,800
Yeah.

666
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,960
You're not going up there!

667
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,680
How do you think
I used to make a living?

668
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,880
Ollie!

669
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,400
Look out for my boy Sam!

670
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,040
It's a fine thing you done

00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,840
Is he older than you?

841
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,680
No. He's younger...

842
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,160
he claims.

843
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,520
Is he big and strong?

844
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,040
Well...

845
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,680
Fat or short?

846
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,280
No, but, uh...

847
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,840
And he is rich?

848
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,600
Yes, he is rich!

849
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,520
That's funny,
my turning down such a man.

850
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,680
Huh?

851
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,120
Please forget
whatever I said before.

852
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,080
I'll be very glad
to make George happy.

853
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,200
No!

854
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,720
It's no good.

855
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,320
Let me try for a week.

856
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,720
No dice.

857
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,360
It's what you wanted.

858
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,200
I changed my mind,
the same as you.

859
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,720
Why, Sam?

860
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,920
I don't want you to get hurt,
and... I like you.

861
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,640
Is that a reason
to get rid of a girl?

862
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,680
It's one of the best.

863
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,680
You're a nice kid. I don't want
to put you on the spot.

864
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,680
What kind of a spot?

865
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,000
Two men and one girl
on top of a mountain...

866
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,480
is trouble.

867
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,000
It's not smart to import it.

868
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,520
Let's call it a boat ride.

869
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,520
I'll see you don't lose anything
for having taken it.

870
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,040
You're right, Sam.

871
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,200
George would be unhappy
if I fell in love with you.

872
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,680
Who knows?
Maybe you'd feel unhappy...

873
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,360
if I fell in love with George.

874
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,600
So the best thing is...

875
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,840
I disappear from Alaska.

876
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,720
I'm glad you agree with me.

877
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,720
How can I help agreeing...

878
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,360
with a man who is
so kind and honorable...

879
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,880
and so wise?

880
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,880
Good night, Sam.

881
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,720
Good night.

882
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,480
One at a time.

883
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,000
Captain.

884
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,680
Good morning, Mr. McCord.

885
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,160
Have a nice trip?

886
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,680
No complaints.

887
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,160
It will take time...

888
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,680
to get your heavy
equipment ashore.

889
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,200
I know.
There's a personal matter.

890
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,680
Miss Bonnet.

891
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,480
Sorry to lose her.

892
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,480
You ain't losin' her.

893
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,440
She's goin' back
to Seattle with you.

894
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,520
We're going to Kotzebue
before returning to Seattle.

895
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,200
That's all right.

896
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,200
300 be enough
for a return passage?

897
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,440
Plenty.

898
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,200
There's 500.
2 extra to keep an eye on her.

899
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,720
I'll watch her like a father.

900
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,200
Here's another 500.

901
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,720
Give that to her
when she gets off at Seattle.

902
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,720
Sort of a refund
from the company.

903
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,720
I got you, Mr. McCord.

904
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,200
They don't usually
come that ladylike.

905
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,560
Hold it!
There's one more!

906
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,560
[Wolf Whistles]

907
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,200
Thank you.

908
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,000
Thank you.

909
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,200
Good morning.

910
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,520
I thought you were staying!

911
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,040
I thought so, too.

912
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,560
Then something said,
Go ashore, Michelle...

913
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,960
and your fortune will be made.

914
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,960
Did that something tell you...

915
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,640
Nome is no place
for a girl like you?

916
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,400
What is my kind of place?

917
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,320
I guess I been takin' care
of you for so long...

918
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,840
that I forgot
you can take care of yourself.

919
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,480
It was fun being looked after...

920
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,720
even for a little while.

921
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,160
I thank you.

922
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,680
You're welcome.

923
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,680
I guess I can see about
a hotel room for you...

924
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,400
for a parting gift.

925
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,520
Won't you be coming into town
from your mine?

926
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,000
Oh, sure.
Once every six months.

927
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,680
Oh, I see.

928
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,200
I don't see George anywhere.

929
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,720
Ooh! When he hears
aboutJenny...

930
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,120
he'll get hysterical
and bust me in the nose...

931
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,160
or try to drown himself.

932
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,160
He's a nice guy.
But aboutJenny, he ain't normal.

933
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,160
That's the trouble
with being in love.

934
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,160
Even drowning is a relief.

935
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,640
Very funny.
Stay out of this.

936
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,160
Of course.

937
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,400
Hey, Sam!

938
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,360
Sam!

939
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,480
Breezy!

940
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,160
You stay right here.

941
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,160
Breezy!
Where's George?

942
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,840
Up at the mine.

943
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,480
He wants you to bring Jenny,
as fast as you can.

944
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,520
There's been claim jumping
and cross-filing!

945
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,680
Him and Billy are sittin'
on that claim with loaded guns.

946
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,200
That bad?

947
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,680
Been killings, too.

948
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,680
I was cross-filed last week.

949
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,680
George give me a job...

950
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,680
to help you haul that stuff
off to the mine.

951
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,200
Here are the invoices.

952
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,680
Wait till they beach
the equipment.

953
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,280
I got to go to the hotel
for a minute.

954
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,640
Bag's just inside
the door, lady.

955
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,160
Thank you.

956
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,640
You got $4.00 change.

957
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,160
Forget it.

958
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,640
We're all filled up.
Beat it.

959
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,160
Hi, Mr. McCord.

960
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,160
A room and a bath for the lady.

961
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,680
Everything's gone.

962
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,840
Everything?

963
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,840
Where else could I get her a room?

964
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,680
Try Phil's livery stable.

965
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,160
They turned it into a hotel.

966
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,520
I'll talk to Bish.
He's the owner.

967
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,120
Bish!

968
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,680
Everett Bishop!

969
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,160
Over here, Sam.

970
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,680
Bish, I want...

971
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:55,200
What kind of an outfit
is this for a proprietor?

972
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,360
I'm not the proprietor anymore.

973
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,480
One queen did it.

974
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,480
One lousy queen.

975
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,200
You lost the hotel?

976
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,200
I had two aces back to back.

977
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,680
This guy had one queen showing.

978
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,680
It was the last draw.

979
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,720
Would you bet a hotel or not?

980
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,200
One queen.

981
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,200
Who pulled that third queen?

982
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,760
One lousy queen.

983
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,200
I'll paint you a skinny one.

984
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,040
Just don't paint her rear end
like a bass drum.

985
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,720
I'll paint a pancake.

986
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,040
Sam, welcome
to the Royal Palace Hotel!

987
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,720
I'm rejuvenating the place.

988
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,360
I'm introducing art to Alaska.

989
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,720
Along with dealing off the bottom?

990
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,240
We're both rich.
Why do we have to quarrel?

991
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,480
If you both would like a room...

992
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,560
I'm out. The room and bath
is for Miss Bonnet alone.

993
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,200
I'm sure I have
just what you wish.

994
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,240
I'd like to wipe out
our past disappointments.

995
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,200
As your friend, Miss Bonnet
is a guest of the house.

996
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,680
I'll take care
of your luggage.

997
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,680
Boggs!

998
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,680
Boggs!

999
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,200
That guy annoys me.

1000
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,360
You ever seen him before?

1001
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,000
Why?

1002
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,920
You don't know him?

1003
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,440
No.

1004
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,680
Watch out.

1005
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,720
Don't let him try
to sell you anything.

1006
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,720
I'll keep my money in my shoe.

1007
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,720
It's for your own good.

1008
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,520
A crook is bad news for everybody.

1009
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,880
Thank you.

1010
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,200
I appreciate your concern.

1011
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,760
Well, I got to
get out to the mine.

1012
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,720
You will say good-bye
before you leave?

1013
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,240
I'll try.

1014
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,880
No hard feelings?

1015
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,240
No. Just something
that didn't work out.

1016
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,440
Too loony, as you say.

1017
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,080
Well...

1018
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,240
good-bye.

1019
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,600
Good-bye.

1020
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,040
# Gold is where you'll find it #

1021
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,160
# In the creeks or rivers #

1022
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,000
# Let's all get behind it #

1023
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,160
#And ossify our livers ##

1024
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,400
Next time you mooch drinks,
you're fired.

1025
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,400
Take the lady's bags
up to my suite.

1026
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,880
Miss Bonnet.

1027
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,560
Can I open the window
for you, ma'am?

1028
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,840
Mr. Boggs.

1029
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,680
Shoo!

1030
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,680
Miss Bonnet.
Oh, that's wonderful.

1031
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,200
Angel, it's been a long time.

1032
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,840
Ooh, you're on to something big.

1033
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,560
Come on.
Tell Frankie all about it.

1034
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,680
If you kept a diary...

1035
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,200
Which, I'm sure,
you wouldn't dare...

1036
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,200
You'd read where it says...

1037
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,560
you have no right
to ask me anything.

1038
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,680
Oh, now...

1039
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,720
Angel, we've both
got a lot to overlook.

1040
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,720
You walked out on me.

1041
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,200
I didn't walk.

1042
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,720
I ran.

1043
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,360
But no explanation...

1044
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,400
Not even a wedding ring.

1045
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,160
I got fed up...

1046
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,200
fed up with being used.

1047
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,720
Did you have to get rough?

1048
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,720
You helped me to learn how.
Remember?

1049
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,720
Why the bellyachin'?
It didn't hurt you any.

1050
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,320
You're twice as beautiful
as you were in New Orleans.

1051
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,200
You've turned out to be
a real Venus.

1052
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,680
Don't I deserve
a little credit?

1053
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,680
Honey, it hit me big
when I saw you. Right here.

1054
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,680
It brought back everything...

1055
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,680
those happy days... nights.

1056
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,960
We're gonna start
all over again...

1057
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,680
on a grand scale.

1058
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,520
So you're all hooked up
with Sam McCord?

1059
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,520
Keep out of it, Frankie.

1060
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,200
I'm on your side.

1061
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,200
It's hunky-dory with me
if he gets his gold mine.

1062
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,200
I have my own interests.

1063
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,720
Sam is yours.
The rest of the world is mine.

1064
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,200
Fair split?

1065
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,480
I'm just asking for
old-fashioned friendliness.

1066
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,720
It's all gone, Frankie...

1067
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,880
dead...

1068
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,520
like if it was never born.

1069
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,960
You're straight.

1070
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,480
I've told you.

1071
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,880
I never would have imagined it.

1072
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,160
You're in love
with this big bum McCord.

1073
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,160
Let me give you
a little friendly advice.

1074
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,160
It's no good.
Don't change.

1075
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,160
You know what
love does to a dame?

1076
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,160
It takes all the zing out of her.

1077
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,160
That's respectability.
That's the end.

1078
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,680
I'm asking you sincerely,
be yourself.

1079
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,160
Don't wind up with kids
hollering in your ear.

1080
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,840
It's respectability.

1081
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,960
It's no good for you.

1082
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,400
Get out of my way.

1083
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,840
No need to leave.
I'm going.

1084
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,360
Keep the room.

1085
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,840
I'm a patient man.

1086
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,360
What's more,
I have faith in you.

1087
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,880
Think it over.

1088
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,880
If you ever need friendliness...

1089
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,360
call for Frankie.

1090
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,120
What's still out there?

1091
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,120
Some pumps and the pipe.

1092
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,960
Me and the big wagon
won't follow you out for another day.

1093
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,800
Just get it there.

1094
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,800
Don't hang around town
and get drunk.

1095
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,320
I never drink on the job!

1096
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,000
You can always start.

1097
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,000
What's got into you
since we landed?

1098
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:17,000
You're as ornery as a bear
with a skinned behind.

1099
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,880
I'm sorry, Breezy.

1100
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,160
Yaaah!

1101
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,680
Yaaah! Yaaah!

1102
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,040
Whoa!

1103
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,960
Get away from me, Tony,
or I'll scream!

1104
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,960
Aaah!

1105
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,480
Aaah!

1106
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,240
I want to get out!

1107
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,840
And don't you
lay a hand on me!

1108
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,440
What do I owe?

1109
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,920
What seems to be...

1110
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,440
For that private suite?

1111
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,440
Everybody knocks on my door!

1112
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,720
I'm not part of
the hotel service!

1113
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,240
Here!

1114
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,240
Don't stop me.
I'm getting out of here.

1115
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,960
That tinhorned Frankie?

1116
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,440
The hotel is full of Frankies.

1117
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,960
Well, I read her wrong.

1118
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,960
A gold mine.

1119
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,280
Where's that livery stable?

1120
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,800
Are you crazy?

1121
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,640
You can't sleep with horses.

1122
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,160
Don't be insulting.

1123
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,160
I'm sorry.
I'm so upset.

1124
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,320
I'll sleep on the beach.
I'll sleep anywhere.

1125
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,600
You'll catch cold on the beach.

1126
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,800
I should have listened to you
in the first place...

1127
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,880
and stayed on the boat.

1128
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,160
I was a fool, I guess.

1129
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,800
Fine time to admit it...

1130
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,720
after the boat has sailed.

1131
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,720
I don't know
what's the matter with me.

1132
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,720
I'll tell you
what's the matter with you.

1133
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,080
You're a...

1134
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,040
a hoodoo!

1135
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,680
That's what you are.
A hoodoo!

1136
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,440
Get in the wagon.

1137
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,960
Move over and quit bawlin'!

1138
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,960
Where are you taking me?

1139
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,440
To the mine!

1140
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,960
What about the boat?

1141
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,400
I'll get you back in time.

1142
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,560
Yaaah!

1143
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,960
Yaaah!

1144
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,640
I could have been
in his pants today...

1145
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,640
if I only had
a brain in my head.

1146
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,120
I built that shack...

1147
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,480
up where him and George Pratt's
gold mine is.

1148
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,960
If I had drank less whiskey...

1149
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,480
and more water
from that stream...

1150
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,920
I'd probably have
all that gold.

1151
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,920
You lived in that cabin?

1152
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,080
Yeah.

1153
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,080
Did you stake a claim?

1154
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,920
Nah. I just ran a trap line.

1155
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,920
Then I pulled out
because I almost starved.

1156
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,920
Do me a favor.
Kick me real hard.

1157
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,440
You must have staked a claim.

1158
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,440
Did you drive a stake
into the ground?

1159
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,920
Put together a pile of stones?

1160
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,960
I wasn't interested in stones.

1161
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,440
Maybe a couple of little stones?

1162
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,960
No.

1163
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,960
You miserable drunk.

1164
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,960
Except when I was cookin'...

1165
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,960
I put a couple
of rocks together.

1166
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,800
