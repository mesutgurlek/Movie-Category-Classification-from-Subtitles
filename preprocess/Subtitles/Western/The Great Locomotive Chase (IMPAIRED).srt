1
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,629
<i>My name is William Pittenger.</i>

2
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:42,828
<i>I never intended to write this book,</i>
<i>but after our raid into Georgia was over,</i>

3
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,564
<i>something happened</i>
<i>to make me change my mind.</i>

4
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,233
<i>Along with a group of men</i>
<i>who had shared so much with me,</i>

5
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,971
<i>I was summoned to</i>
<i>the War Department in Washington.</i>

6
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,442
<i>We expected nothing more</i>
<i>than routine questioning,</i>

7
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:59,076
<i>but were surprised to be invited</i>
<i>into Secretary Stanton"s office,</i>

8
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,280
<i>and dumbfounded as we took in</i>
<i>the meaning of his words.</i>

9
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:06,223
It is a tribute to your vaIor
that the boIdest expIoit of this war

10
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:11,195
bringing consternation upon the
Confederacy and gIory to our Union arms,

11
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:15,132
was Ied by a civiIian, and carried out
by private soIdiers.

12
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:18,034
VoIunteers, to a man.

13
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:23,765
You"ve won for us a new respect,
and we are gratefuI.

14
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,107
Congress has, by recent Iaw,

15
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,376
prepared a medaI to be awarded
for conspicuous bravery:

16
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,508
""The CongressionaI MedaI of Honor.""

17
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,576
You gentIemen are to have
the first ever given.

18
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,521
CorporaI WiIIiam Pittenger.

19
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,972
CongratuIations, Mr. Pittenger.

20
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,304
<i>[</i> Pittenger<i>] I tried to thank him</i>
<i>but I felt too unworthy,</i>

21
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,644
<i>remembering our missing comrades</i>
<i>and our brave leader Andrews</i>

22
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,706
<i>who had gained us this honor.</i>

23
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:14,259
<i>[</i>Pittenger<i>] James J. Andrews was a man</i>
<i>of mystery, as befitted his vocation.</i>

24
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,296
<i>Though in reality a Union spy,</i>

25
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,196
<i>he was trusted throughout the South</i>
<i>as a blockade runner.</i>

26
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,530
<i>It was typical that even now</i>
<i>as he neared our lines,</i>

27
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,765
<i>he was riding a horse he had borrowed</i>
<i>from the Confederates.</i>

28
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:32,472
On <i>that eventful day in 1862,</i>
<i>I was in charge of a picket detail,</i>

29
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,981
<i>guarding the approach to our</i>
<i>headquarters camp, south of Nashville.</i>

30
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,944
Pittenger, why don"t you hire a substitute,

31
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,216
so the war won"t interfere
with your reading?

32
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,224
This concerns the war.

33
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,887
Bringing out a new medaI.
""The CongressionaI MedaI of Honor.""

34
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,697
This ain"t for you and me.
That"s for generaIs.

35
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,361
Not our generaIs.
They won"t even Iet us fight.

36
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,701
MitcheII wouId,
if they"d give him a chance.

37
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,330
Maybe.

38
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,433
AII I know is I joined this army
to kiII Johnny Rebs,

39
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,910
and so far, I ain"t even seen one.

40
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,039
You"ve been Iucky.

41
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,983
It"s aII right, BiII.
I know him.

42
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,980
GIad to see you, Mr. Andrews.

43
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,651
What"s your regiment doing
this far south of NashviIIe?

44
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,992
GeneraI BueII moved out with most of
the army to reinforce Grant.

45
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,395
There"s a big fight shaping up
around Corinth.

46
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,525
I probabIy don"t have to teII you.

47
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,037
I didn"t know BueII was gone.
Who"s in command here now?

48
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,939
GeneraI MitcheII. He"s madder than
a wet hen to be Ieft behind.

49
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,534
So were we.

50
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:45,016
- Why are you Ieft behind?
- To guard NashviIIe.

51
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,552
It"s nice to taIk with you again, CorporaI.

52
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,145
Mr. Andrews...

53
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,556
if you ever want heIp
on a Secret Service mission,

54
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,585
don"t forget the name Pittenger.
WiIIiam Pittenger.

55
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,137
In aII of East Tennessee,
there"s no concentration

56
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,839
of Confederate forces worth the mention.

57
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,940
The Southern army at KnoxviIIe
is bareIy abIe to defend the city

58
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,713
- from Union GeneraI Morgan.
- What about Chattanooga?

59
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,517
BueII was certain a great army
was gathering there.

60
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,252
GeneraI MitcheII, there are onIy
2,000 raw recruits in Chattanooga,

61
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,795
and another 2,000 that aren"t even armed!

62
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:35,198
Here we wait with 1 0,000 choice troops
under strict orders to guard NashviIIe.

63
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:40,305
If onIy I"d been given some Iatitude,
I"d march right into Chattanooga.

64
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,501
- WouIdn"t that be defending NashviIIe?
- Yes, by George!

65
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:49,071
As Iong as I keep the enemy in front
of me, NashviIIe wiII be fuIIy protected.

66
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,708
But I don"t want Chattanooga
unIess I can hoId it.

67
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,776
It might be two weeks
before BueII couId reinforce me.

68
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,446
Have you any idea how many men

69
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,184
the Confederates couId bring
out of AtIanta against me?

70
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,089
1 5,000 at Ieast.

71
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,155
That many?

72
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:08,628
Suppose we have a Iook, Andrews,
and see how matters stand.

73
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,159
Here"s Lee, who has his hands fuII
in Virginia.

74
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:17,972
And here"s Beauregard, who"s bringing up
everything he"s got to fight Grant at ShiIoh.

75
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,444
And here"s their east-west raiIroad,

76
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,314
aII the way from AIexandria to Memphis,

77
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,717
with Chattanooga right
in the strategic center.

78
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:32,053
Here we are. So, if I moved
down here to HuntsviIIe,

79
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,925
captured the Iocomotives and fIat cars,
and rode into Chattanooga,

80
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:39,658
aII I"d have to fear wouId be
these forces out of AtIanta.

81
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:44,362
That"s true, sir, but we"re right back
where we started from.

82
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,201
They can move their soIdiers
up the raiIroad from AtIanta

83
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,208
and drive you out of Chattanooga
in two days.

84
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,609
There are 1 1 raiIroad bridges
over the Chicamagua.

85
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:59,677
A man Iike you couId Iead a raiding party
and burn those bridges for me.

86
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,488
Why not?

87
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:07,287
I had a deaI with GeneraI BueII
that when I brought this information,

88
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,521
I wouIdn"t go South anymore.

89
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:13,224
Soon as I compIete this report,
I aim to enIist in the 21 st Ohio.

90
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,961
You"d Ieave the Secret Service
to become a foot soIdier?

91
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,835
Yes, sir. Maybe I won"t be
any great shakes in the infantry,

92
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:23,342
but at Ieast it wouIdn"t be
hiding under a cIoak.

93
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,401
After just so Iong,
a man has to come out in the open.

94
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,540
Mr. Andrews, I wouIdn"t detaiI any man
on a duty of this kind against his wiII.

95
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,483
But consider what it might mean
to the Union.

96
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,054
Cut the Confederacy in two.

97
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,650
We couId shorten the war by haIf,
maybe end it.

98
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:45,765
<i>[</i>Pittenger<i>] I"d heard from Mr. Andrews</i>
<i>sooner than I expected.</i>

99
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,598
<i>[</i>Pittenger<i>] I"d heard from Mr. Andrews</i>
<i>sooner than I expected.</i>

100
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:54,071
<i>That night a score of adventurous men,</i>
<i>most from the 2 1st and 33rd Ohio Infantry,</i>

101
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,041
<i>followed me to a meeting place</i>
<i>on a hillside.</i>

102
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,100
<i>[</i>coyote howIs<i>]</i>

103
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,953
- Good evening, gentIemen.
- <i>[</i>aII<i>]</i> Good evening.

104
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,255
AII here, Mr. Andrews.

105
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:21,961
Which are Brown and Knight?

106
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,366
Private WiIson Brown, Company F.

107
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:26,427
Private WiIIiam Knight, Company E.

108
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:30,441
Not any Ionger, gentIemen.
Forget that you"ve ever been soIdiers.

109
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,044
Mr. Brown and Mr. Knight
have been informed

110
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,547
by their company commanders
about our venture.

111
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:40,608
They know what they have to do.
We can"t get aIong without them.

112
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:45,589
AII I can teII the rest of you is that whiIe
MitcheII moves toward Chattanooga,

113
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:49,924
we must penetrate more than 1 00 miIes
behind the Confederate Iines in Georgia

114
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:52,793
to destroy the raiIroad.

115
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,824
If we faiI, every one of us may be hanged
or torn in pieces by an angry mob.

116
00:08:56,902 --> 00:09:00,531
You have no experience
pIaying the part of spies.

117
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,369
Some of you are pretty young.

118
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:07,003
Since we"re asking you to voIunteer bIindIy,
it won"t be dishonorabIe to back out now.

119
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:11,676
If you had any sense, you"d return to camp
and get into uniform again.

120
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,481
<i>[</i>coyote howIs<i>]</i>

121
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,384
Good. You"re the men for me.

122
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,988
Now then, you"re to traveI southeast
through the CumberIand Mountains,

123
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,965
cross the Tennessee River,

124
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:33,027
and be ready to catch the 5:00 train south
out of Chattanooga Thursday afternoon.

125
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,700
Your destination is the RaiIroad HoteI
at Marietta, Georgia.

126
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,972
If anyone faiIs to meet me there
before sun up Friday morning,

127
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:43,503
the attempt wiII be made without him.
Any questions?

128
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:46,107
I"m BiII CampbeII.
What"II we teII the Johnny Rebs

129
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,016
about who we are
and where we"re from?

130
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:52,251
TeII them you"re Kentuckians, escaping
Yankee ruIe to join a Southern regiment.

131
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:55,953
If they press you, teII them you haiI
from FIeming County, Kentucky.

132
00:09:56,028 --> 00:10:00,692
I"m from FIemingsburg, and no man from
that county ever joined the Southern army.

133
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,862
- What if they have us cornered?
- Don"t hesitate to join their army.

134
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,997
You can escape back to your own Iines
some dark night on picket duty.

135
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:13,136
I"m Bob Buffum. WouId you care to teII us
how you intend to reach Marietta?

136
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:17,012
I"II traveI on the same road,
sometimes before you, sometimes behind.

137
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:21,485
- We aIIowed to taIk to you?
- Treat me as you wouId a stranger.

138
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:24,716
As for you, Mr. Buffum, it might be wiser
if you didn"t speak at aII.

139
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,385
I never met a Kentuckian
so pIainIy from Massachusetts.

140
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,820
<i>[</i>thunder<i>]</i>

141
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,229
Do you have your pistoIs?

142
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,427
Keep them hidden.

143
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:41,371
In this business, you never fight
unIess you"ve faiIed, and we won"t faiI.

144
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,567
Nothing can stop us.

145
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,633
<i>[</i>thunder<i>]</i>

146
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,372
Nothing.

147
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,643
<i>[</i>Pittenger<i>] Andrews gave us 3 days for</i>
<i>ourjourney through the Cumberlands.</i>

148
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,986
<i>Traveling by twos and threes,</i>
<i>we were strung out miles apart</i>

149
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,322
<i>in a desolate country.</i>

150
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:05,329
<i>We"d been supplied with Confederate</i>
<i>money, but food and lodging were scarce,</i>

151
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:08,230
<i>and transportation out of the question.</i>

152
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,825
<i>My companion was the Giant,</i>
<i>Bill Campbell.</i>

153
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:16,500
<i>As I came to know him, I felt a growing</i>
<i>concern over his quick, violent temper.</i>

154
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,375
<i>One such powder keg could blow</i>
<i>our whole expedition sky-high.</i>

155
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,346
<i>We reached the Tennessee River on time,</i>

156
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,287
<i>only to find it impassable.</i>

157
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:56,039
Pardon me, ma"am. Do you know
the whereabouts of the ferryman?

158
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,573
Home, Iike enough. But he won"t
chance it across before morning.

159
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,448
River"s swoIe up mighty angry.

160
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,353
- CouId you put us up for the night?
- Where you from?

161
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,084
<i>[</i>Pittenger<i>]</i> FIemingsburg, Kentucky.

162
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,058
Inn"s pretty fuII.

163
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,322
We can pay doubIe.

164
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,456
<i>[</i>thunder<i>]</i>

165
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,865
They"re from FIemingsburg, too.
There"s a score of us in aII.

166
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:20,803
We couIdn"t abide the Yankees anymore
so we puIIed up stakes.

167
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,001
Gonna throw in our Iot
with the Southern army.

168
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:28,012
Come in, aII of ya.
It won"t cost you a cent.

169
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:39,415
FIemingsburg? I can"t rightIy say
I"ve ever been to FIemingsburg.

170
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:43,393
UnIess you wanna be under the thumb
of the aboIitionists, you better not go now.

171
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:47,193
I never thought Kentucky wouId be run
by cIay-eaters and poor white trash!

172
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,860
There"s some mighty fine foIks
in Kentucky.

173
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,563
Yes, and more of them
are coming south every day.

174
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,300
Isn"t that just giving up
your state to the Yankees?

175
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,966
They"ve got it aIready.

176
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,237
They"re so strong in the IegisIature,
they passed a Iaw

177
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,246
that any man fighting for the South
forfeits his state"s rights

178
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,806
- to citizenship, Iand and hoIdings.
- Has it come to that?

179
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:08,045
Yes, sir. I know that to be true.

180
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,213
The governor of Kentucky has four sons.

181
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,349
Two are fighting for the Yankees,
and two are in my regiment.

182
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:17,088
They toId me that unIess we won,
they couId never go home again.

183
00:13:17,896 --> 00:13:19,295
Damn Yankees!

184
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,030
Jess, you"re at tabIe.
Quit your swearing.

185
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,629
""Damn Yankee"" ain"t swearing, Mother,
and you know it.

186
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,876
Jem, maybe the brave Kentuckians
wouId Iike to join your regiment.

187
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:35,641
I"d be mighty proud to have them,
if you can wait tiII this comes off.

188
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:39,548
I"d take you to Chattanooga with me,
introduce you to GeneraI Ledbetter.

189
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:44,851
We"re honored, but we had our hearts set
on enIisting in the 1 st Georgia regiment.

190
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:48,359
Some of our friends have aIready joined it,
and we"re anxious to push on.

191
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,453
1 st Georgia!
Did you hear that, Mother?

192
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,261
No river"s gonna hoId you back.
That ferryman doesn"t Iike fIood water,

193
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:59,964
but he"II take you over first thing
in the morning or find himseIf out of a job.

194
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:03,439
<i>[</i>Innkeeper<i>]</i> I knew it. I knew Jess McIntyre
wouId heIp you.

195
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,704
- They"re heIping us, ain"t they?
- Yes, sir!

196
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:08,905
- Retha, give them boys more chicken.
- Yes, ma"am.

197
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,779
You"re aII very kind,
kinder than we deserve.

198
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,112
That"s right.

199
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:20,386
<i>[</i>Innkeeper<i>]</i> You won"t have no troubIe at
aII. Once foIks find out what you"re up to,

200
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,859
they"II put the big pot in the IittIe one.

201

<i>[</i>Innkeeper<i>]</i> WeII, Iook who"s here!

202
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,464
<i>[</i>Retha<i>]</i> Land sakes, but you"re wet!

203
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,266
You need some of Retha"s cooking,
Mr. Andrews.

204
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:35,806
Sounds mighty good.
SmeIIs even better.

205
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:38,206
I think I"II get warm first.

206
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:40,333
Evening.

207
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,404
<i>[</i>Innkeeper<i>]</i> Retha, fetch Mr. Andrews
that peach brandy, you hear?

00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,006
Yes, ma"am.

209
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,949
Ladies and gentIemen, I have great news.

210
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,685
On the strength of it, I"d ask you aII
to have a gIass with me...

211
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,359
if I knew the coIor of your poIitics.

212
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,624
You needn"t worry about these boys.

213
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,156
They"ve been Iiving amongst Yankees,
but they"re coming out on the right side.

214
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,497
Good.

215
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,562
We won a great victory at ShiIoh.

216
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,735
- Did Beauregard Iick that buzzard Grant?
- <i>[</i>Andrews<i>]</i> Cut him to ribbons.

217
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,301
What about the Yankee gunboats
at Pittsburgh Landing?

218
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:17,177
1 00 of them sunk,
and thousands of prisoners taken.

219
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,683
The whoIe Yankee force,
gone up the spout.

I give you a toast.

224

The Confederacy.

225
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,170
You don"t seem very happy
over our victory, Mr. CampbeII.

226
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,508
He"s not. He wants to kiII
aII the Yankees himseIf.

227

<i>[</i>Iaughter<i>]</i>

You"II find pIenty of action Iater on, sir.

230
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,881
But before you go any further South,
there"s one thing we must teach you.

231
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,355
What"s that?

232
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:00,914
<i>Dixie.</i>

00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,290

<i>[</i>Innkeeper<i>]</i> Go right ahead.
Come on, boys, gather "round.

Mr. CampbeII, do you have
something on your mind?

246
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:15,489
I wanna know just one thing.

247
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:20,437
Do we have to be better Southerners
than the Johnny Rebs themseIves?

248
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:24,901
I went pretty far tonight.
But Iet me teII you this:

249
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:28,639
If you can"t drink their toasts
and sing their songs,

250
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:33,117
Iove Jeff Davis and hate Abe LincoIn
untiI next Friday,

251
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,119
you"II never reach Marietta.

252
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,982
I"m sorry.

253
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:40,718
Then you were exaggerating about ShiIoh?

254
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,384
Yes.

255
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,893
When I bring them good news, I"m doubIy
weIcome. The truth is bad enough.

256
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,059
Bad enough to stop
GeneraI MitcheII"s advance?

257
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,866
No. ShiIoh can"t stop him,
but the deviIish rains may.

258
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:57,170
The troubIe is, our movements and his
have to dovetaiI.

259
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,540
<i>[</i>Andrews<i>]</i> He has an army
and cannon to move.

260
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:07,341
It"s taking a chance, but we"II have
to postpone our pIans for one day.

261
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,316
I"II wait here for the rest of the men.
You go into Chattanooga,

262
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,760
and if you see any of the boys who didn"t
come this way, pass the word aIong.

263
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:29,363
<i>[</i>snoring<i>]</i>

264
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,788
What"d you do before the war?

265
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,122
Taught schooI a whiIe.

266
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,660
How do you Iike this business?

267
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,795
There"s one side of it I can"t get used to.

268
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,395
Mr. McIntyre...

269
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,806
and the widow woman
who fed us and gave us her bed...

270
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:10,678
When I deceive "em, I feeI Iike
the Iowest snake that crawIs.

I know.

272
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:18,522
That soIdier,
he"s supposed to be my enemy.

273
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,792
I"m supposed to hate him
the way CampbeII does.

274
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,194
But I don"t think I can.

275
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,362
It"s worse when a Southerner"s
your best friend.

276
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:36,499
Like oId Jim Lindsay.

277
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:42,811
Even picked out the girI I"m going to marry,
"cause she"s Yankee-minded Iike me.

278
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,644
Now that I"ve turned spy
and have to fooI him,

279
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,052
I can hardIy Iook him in the eye anymore.

280
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:53,249
How do you stand it?

281
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,121
I beIieve in a federaI union.

282
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:01,256
So do I.

283
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:07,000
I hope we can preserve it
without any more ShiIohs.

284
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,505
They say the sIaughter was so fierce
on both sides,

285
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:16,343
you couId waIk across the fieId
on dead bodies Iike stepping stones.

286
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,948
How wouId you Iike to put a stop
to that, Pittenger?

287
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,489
CouId we, with what we"re doing?

288
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,487

Good. That way it won"t appear

BiII CampbeII and I got to taIking it over.

348
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:43,946
Tearing up the track behind us

00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,245
but why steaI the train at Big Shanty?

350
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,515
It"s a breakfast stop for the crew
as weII as the passengers.

351
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:51,646
There"s no teIegraph there, either.

352

There"s a Confederate camp
with 4,000 men.

00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,132
Yes. Any deserted part of the track
north of this town.

356
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,295

If you don"t, I ain"t going.

362
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:25,720
Mr. CampbeII, your company commander
said you"d be worth ten in a fight.

363

That"s why I brought you aIong,
just in case.

364

But we didn"t come to fight.

00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,747
Think we"re being foIIowed?

434
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,346
Can"t be. There"s no train
south of us short of AtIanta,

435
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,291
and they"II have to go to Marietta
before they can send out a teIegram.

436
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,955
The onIy train we"ve got to worry about is
that freight we"re due to pass at Kingston.

437
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,522
That torn track"II bIock everything beIow us,
and once we get that wire cut,

438
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,830
they can"t send warning to those above.

439
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:11,036
Tighter yet.
A IittIe more. There.

440
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:19,851
Now cut it at the next poIe and take a
Iength with us. Nobody"II catch us then.

441
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:36,267
Did you get a Iook at "em?
The men who stoIe my train?

442
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,171
- StoIe, is it?
- Yeah. Did they stop?

443
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,937
- They did.
- What for?

444
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,478
The officiaI stepped down
and borrowed some tooIs.

445
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:45,606
- A Mr. Andrews?
- I didn"t ask. He came from Beauregard.

446
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,947
That"s the one.

447
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,481
- Who were they? Conscripts?
- No, a Mr. Andrews.

448
00:34:53,557 --> 00:34:56,287
He got on at Marietta
with some Secret Service men.

449
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,193
- He showed me a Ietter from Beauregard.
- An authorization?

450
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,596
No. It was right much an order
to heIp out any way we couId.

451
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:05,863
I"II heIp him when I get
to that teIegraph in AIIatoona.

452
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:09,030
Maybe next time you"II stop and ask
if he is an army man.

453
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:10,835
We"II need that push car.

454
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:14,002
Take it and weIcome, Mr. Murphy.
Hoist it up, boys.

455
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,634
<i>? Blow the whistle, clear the track</i>
<i>When I"m gone I won"t be back ?</i>

<i>? Well, I stole a locomotive</i>
<i>Just to take a ride ?</i>

458
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:51,074
Be quiet!
We"re coming to a station.

459
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:55,346
What station?

460
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,751
- AIIatoona.
- Just a crossroads.

461

<i>? I stole a locomotive</i>
<i>Just to take a ride ?</i>

463
00:36:07,264 --> 00:36:09,425
Brown, you wanna take her?

464
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,299
Keep her down.
We gotta run on scheduIe.

465
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:29,883
Jump!

466
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,321
You aII right?

467
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:47,194
Those scoundreIs are spies,
but not for Beauregard.

468
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,535
OnIy damn Yankees wouId do
a trick Iike that.

469
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,098
Whatever they"re up to,
they mean business.

470
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,685
Sit on the front facing forward, Jeff.

471
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,354
You"re an oId hand at watching the tracks.

472
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,439
Mr. Andrews!

473
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:41,417
There"s an iron works four miIes east.
That must be her yard engine.

474
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,153
Hadn"t we better destroy her?

475
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,458
Not worth the risk.
We"re too cIose to Kingston.

476
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,328
Ease on through the station, but don"t stop.

477
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,992
Let "em hear the beII.

478

<i>[</i>beII rings<i>]</i>

480
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,108
There"s a Iocomotive back there
and he ran right on by it.

481
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:11,553
- I thought we were wrecking this raiIroad.
- Give him a chance, wiII ya?

482
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:30,800
- Can you get a message to Kingston?
- No, the Iine"s gone dead.

483
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:33,468
- They"re cutting the wire between stations.
- Who is?

484
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,513
The Yankees that stoIe my train!

485
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,310
Hey, Reid! They"ve taken up a raiI
two miIes south.

486
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:42,614
Get a fIagman down there to stop
any train from AtIanta.

487

<i>[</i>train beII<i>]</i>

488
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:56,855
AII right, boys. I"m gonna wait here
for the southbound train.

489
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,799
There"s a train on the sidetrack.

490
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:02,600
Goes between here and Rome.
Waiting for AtIanta passengers.

491

PuII past the switch,
then back in ahead of her.

492
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,301
CouIdn"t we make it into AdairsviIIe?

493
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:10,870
No, we might run head-on
into that southbound freight.

494
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,438
We"ve gotta wait.

495
00:39:33,837 --> 00:39:37,568
You boys oiI up the engine.
You"re too busy to bother with anybody.

496
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,199
Understand?

497
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,737
I"II do the taIking.

498
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,511
Looks Iike I"II have to do pIenty.

499

Hand me that wrench.

500
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:02,588
I reckon I don"t know you.

501
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,725
It"s their engine, aII right.

502
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,066
But there ain"t none of their men aboard.

503
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:09,469
GentIemen, I"ve taken this train
by government authority

504
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,940
and I"m running it through to Beauregard.

505
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,479
Where"s Jeff Cain and FuIIer?

506
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:19,209
They were fitting out another train
when we Ieft AtIanta.

507
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:22,810
I got a dispatch for FuIIer to wait here untiI
the southbound freight passes.

508
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:26,686
He"II be aIong. The southbound freight
may have to wait for him.

509
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:32,418
What you got in them boxcars?

510
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:35,829
Enough ammunition to bIow this depot
to kingdom come.

511
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:42,536
One of them was pointing toward us.

512
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,575
They aII Iook mighty suspicious.

513
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,189
From the north.

514
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:17,133
AII right, boys. Here we go.

515
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,817
<i>[</i>Andrews<i>]</i> Engineer!

516

- You can"t take no train north. Not yet.

518
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,323
- <i>[</i>engineer<i>]</i> There"s another behind me.
- Pete Bracken"s express freight?

519
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,456
<i>[</i>engineer<i>]</i> No, one that ain"t scheduIed.

520
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,434
- Can"t be.
- Maybe there can"t be but there is.

521
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:46,867
Ain"t you heard the news?

522
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:50,896
A Yankee generaI named MitcheII marched
down and captured HuntsviIIe yesterday.

523
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:52,236
<i>[</i>train yard worker<i>]</i> I"II be darned!

We"re hauIing bacon out of Chattanooga
before the Yankees get there.

526
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:02,819
If you tried to get through to Beauregard
now, you"d run right smack into oId Mitch.

527
00:42:02,886 --> 00:42:06,049
Didn"t Ledbetter go
to defend Chattanooga?

528
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,385
He"II try.

529
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,188
Then he"II need ammunition
even more than Beauregard.

530

MitcheII got through yesterday.
Captured HuntsviIIe.

535

The enemy is running extra freight trains
and cIogging up the road.

He got through. We"re too Iate!
I"m getting out of here!

Shut up and Iisten.

538

If the station master tries to send a

- No, we ain"t.

557
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,514
We"re Yankee contraband
smuggIed into a boxcar

558
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,387
by a sIick-taIking bIockade runner.

560
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:06,158
AII right.
I"II give him five more minutes.

561
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:18,911
I teII you, I know BiII FuIIer.
Ain"t a better man on the state road.

562
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,780
He wouIdn"t be this Iate
without Ietting us know.

563
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,377
Why don"t you teIegraph AtIanta
and find out?

564
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:26,786
The Iine to the south"s gone dead!

565
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:29,587
Maybe our friend here can teII us why.

566
00:45:31,461 --> 00:45:33,326
I don"t know why.

567
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:37,356
There are many things about how this road
is run I wouIdn"t attempt to expIain.

568
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:42,497
But I can teII you this: If Beauregard couId
get his orders fiIIed by reguIar channeIs

569
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,441
without these ruinous deIays, he wouIdn"t
have sent me to bring his powder through.

570
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,104
It"s a shame you foIks
have to wait for the train.

571
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,841
But it"s more of a shame to bIock
the road with ordinary traveI

572
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,748
when the fate of brave soIdiers
hangs in the baIance.

573
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:57,286
Mr. Andrews? I"II get you through.

574
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,016
I"II get an authorization
to cIear that track for you

575
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:05,255
- if I have to go aII the way to Richmond.
- No! You needn"t do that.

576
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,762

Through the top of the hiII.

727
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:16,423
Mr. Andrews, we want to stop
and have it out with them.

728
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:18,084
That"s right.

729
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:20,721
- We can ambush them inside that tunneI.
- How?

730
01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:25,392
- Send this boxcar back to smash into "em.
- They might just push it out again.

731
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,904
Then reverse our engine
and send it back, too. How about it?

732

WeII, how about it?

733
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:39,713
- What are we sIowing for?
- I ordered them to stop.

734
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:42,047
We don"t want to go in there bIind.

735
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:43,916
And give the Yankees time
to burn a bridge?

736
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:46,251
They"re not burning any bridge,
they"re tearing up track.

737
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:50,953
- They won"t have time if we crowd "em.
- Throwing our Iives away won"t heIp.

738
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:54,088
You boys jump off.
Get down, Pete, I"II take her.

we may as weII go a"kiting.

741
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:36,798
It"s time the army showed
the Secret Service how to fight.

742

the first Chicamagua bridge.

745

I know it"s hard on you men.
I"ve been tempted to stop, too.

746
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:57,458
But we can"t risk any encounter
that might Iose us our engine.

747
01:04:57,527 --> 01:05:02,260
Even after we burn the bridges, we"ve got
to get through to MitcheII and Iet him know.

748

If we don"t wood up soon,
we won"t go much farther.

751

I thought she was chasing us again!

771

That"s just the smoke from the bridge.

Jump down and get a barricade

I"II tie him up and gag him,

873
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,423
steaI his ceII keys and unIock the doors.

874
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:20,518
Then we creep past the guards,
cIimb the waII and run for the woods.

875
01:18:20,596 --> 01:18:22,223
<i>[</i>Pittenger<i>]</i> No.

876
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:24,356
We won"t do it that way.

877
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:31,270
Mr. Andrews,
you keep forgetting we"re soIdiers.

878
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:34,605
We trained together, and we know
how to fight together.

879
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:37,005
We"d rather fight than scheme.

880
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:39,206
Now you"re taIking Iike a man.

881
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:42,273
If we try to sneak out one by one,
onIy the first wiII get away.

882
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:44,615
- The rest"II be cornered.
- That"s right.

883
01:18:44,686 --> 01:18:45,948
How wouId you go at it?

884
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:50,219
I"d wait untiI around suppertime, when
it"s Iight enough to see what we"re doing.

885
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:53,955
I"d grab Mr. Turner, take his keys,
and rush the guards outside in a body.

886
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:57,260
It"II be sudden. Bare hands against
muskets, they won"t expect.

887
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:59,527
- Good!
- It"s aII right!

888
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:02,935
What do you think, Mr. Andrews?

889
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:07,974
Yes, it"s a good pIan.

890
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:10,705
Go ahead, Pittenger.
Assign us our positions.

891
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:15,113
I think Buffum and I Iook the Ieast
dangerous, so we"II take care of Mr. Turner.

892
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:17,583
We"II want the biggest men
to rush the guards.

893
01:19:20,789 --> 01:19:22,780
CampbeII, you"re the first.

894
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:29,320
Then Ross, I guess.

895
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:02,493
Through with them bread tins, boys?

896
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:07,959
Boys, I"m sorry about the hangin".

897
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:11,494
That"s aII right, Mr. Turner.
We"ve aII got to go sometime.

898
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:16,636
WouId you be good enough to ask the
captain of the guard to fix my chain?

899
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:17,838
Why...!

900
01:20:40,736 --> 01:20:45,673
- CorporaI, post your guard.
- MacDonaId and Irvine, south post.

901
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:56,006
Get back!

902
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:59,109
Guards!

903
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:36,089
<i>[</i>gunshot<i>]</i>

904
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:37,591
Get back in!

905
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,150
Try the waII!

906
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:45,525
Guards!

907
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:48,626
TaII ones heIp the others over the waII.

908
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:58,945
Outside! They"re cIimbing the waIIs!
Head "em off outside!

909
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:04,917
Around back!

910
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:19,133
Come on! Get over!

911
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:32,671
Go on! Go!

912
01:23:08,517 --> 01:23:11,179
<i>[</i>gunshots<i>]</i>

913
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,904
- Is that aII you caught?
- So far.

914
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:35,233
I got the two big ones upstairs.

915
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:42,511
You needn"t have come back to heIp me.

916
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:44,575
I didn"t.

917
01:23:45,987 --> 01:23:48,922
I had to see how many of "em
it"d take to Iay me out.

918
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:53,385
You mean, you"d hang for that?

919
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:57,554
Yeah. Any day in the week.

920
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:02,401
You shouIdn"t hate them that much.

921
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:06,339
I don"t. Not anymore.

922
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:10,606
I thought they was a bag of wind,
but they ain"t.

923
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:14,013
They done aII right.

924
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:17,345
You done aII right, too.

925
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:19,353
You reaIIy showed "em.

926
01:24:20,956 --> 01:24:24,153
There"s one more thing
we"re gonna have to show "em.

927
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:26,217
What"s that?

928
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:29,955
That we know how to die.

929
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,401
Mr. FuIIer?

930
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:42,465
WeII, Reverend Scott!

931
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:44,910
"Morning, sir.
You riding with us today?

932
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:48,437
No, I"ve been to the jaiI,
praying with the condemned prisoners.

933
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:52,008
One of them, a Mr. Andrews,
asked to see you.

934
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:55,916
I gave him my promise you"d come.

935
01:24:55,990 --> 01:25:00,359
He had a fair triaI, and I gave
aII my testimony to the court.

936
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:04,865
Anything further I might have to say to him
wouId be of smaII comfort to him now.

937
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:09,559
Mr. Andrews?

938
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:27,147
Thank you for coming.

939
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:33,627
Mr. FuIIer, I wanted you to know
I"m sorry I had to deceive you.

940
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,954
I guess you"II be paying for it.

941
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:40,023
Yes. I"m gonna hang.

942
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:42,899
I wasn"t taIking about that.

943
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:46,429
You whipped me fair and square,

944
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:51,673
but now that it"s aII over,
I hoped you wouIdn"t hoId a grudge.

945
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:56,683
I haven"t much use for a man who poses
as a IoyaI Southerner, and isn"t.

946
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:59,584
I was fighting for my convictions.

947
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:02,350
My onIy weapons were the Iies
a spy must teII.

948
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,952
You fought in your way;
I fought in mine.

949
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:13,994
Some day the fighting wiII be over,
and both sides wiII have to shake hands.

950
01:26:14,068 --> 01:26:17,003
I won"t be aIive to see that day.

951
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,600
CouIdn"t we do it now?

952
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:30,314
I"d be gIad if you wouId, sir.

953
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:46,092
Your Ieader was a most unusuaI man;

954
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:48,499
resourcefuI, brave and true.

955
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:51,403
So were your comrades
who perished with him.

956
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:54,236
As soIdiers, they wiII receive,
posthumousIy,

957
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:56,539
the same award you are wearing now.

958
01:26:56,611 --> 01:27:00,206
Though the CongressionaI order
must excIude Mr. Andrews himseIf,

959
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:04,115
as a civiIian, he wiII receive
an even higher decoration;

960
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:06,915
the commendation of history.

961
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:09,320
Because you dared and suffered with him,

962
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:12,791
I know he wouId be as proud
to have his men receive this honor

963
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:15,988
as we are to bestow it.

964
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,191
That means a great deaI to us, sir.

965
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:20,257
Thank you.
