00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,472
ANNOUNCER:
<i>The following program</i>

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:09,042
<i>is brought to you</i>
<i>in living color on NBC.</i>

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,773
(fanfare plays)

4
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,532
- Thank you, Mrs. Brown.
- Howdy, Bert.

5
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,867
- Ben.
- Another hot day?

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,358
It sure is.

7
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,765
(sighs):
Eh.

8
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,307
Hello, Hoss.

9
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,309
(mouth full):
Hi, Bert. Good crackers.

10
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,478
They sure are.
I'll put 'em on your bill.

11
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,414
Bert, you put 'em
on Hoss's personal bill.

12
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:50,116
Say, I got a long list
of supplies here I'd like you

13
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,285
- to put together for us.
- MAN: Leave me alone!

14
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,618
I said leave me alone.

15
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,262
Some of that sweet wine, Bert.

16
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,597
Doctor said take a little
with my meals.

17
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,433
I'm out of the brand
you like, Luke.

18
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,435
Maybe later today
we'll have some in.

19
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,769
WOMAN:
Luke?

20
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,671
Honey, you heard what he said.

21
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,339
Look, you can come back later.

22
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,309
I don't want no woman
telling me what to do!

23
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,444
(panting)

24
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,412
Who do you think you're fooling?

25
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,614
You think I haven't
got any eyes?

26
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:22,949
I'll get it myself.

27
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,485
Oh, wait a minute, Luke,
you stay out of there.

28
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,786
BEN:
Luke.

29
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,456
Hoss and I are just going out
to have some breakfast.

30
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,157
Why don't you
come along with us?

31
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,493
Now, you Cartwrights
stay out of this.

32
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,195
I don't like you!

33
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,198
I never did!

34
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,300
I ain't gonna put up
with this, Luke!

35
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,768
You get out of here
and stay out of here!

36
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,802
Luke, honey, please stop.

37
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,397
I don't want you to get hurt!

38
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:52,178
No stinkin' storekeeper's
gonna tell me what to do.

39
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,281
You high and mighty Cartwrights!

40
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,450
You don't mean nothin' to me!

41
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,816
Luke, honey, please stop!

42
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,390
I've always wanted
to kill me a Cartwright.

43
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,992
(gunshots)

44
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,483
(grunts)

45
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,027
(drops gun)

46
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,531
(quietly):
Luke...

47
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,971
Luke?

48
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,039
Luke, honey?

49
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,701
(voice breaking):
Please, Luke...

50
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,437
Now, how'd this happen?

51
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,382
I'm afraid it's
too late for a doctor.

52
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,284
Luke's been drinking
for a week straight, Sheriff.

53
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,952
He plumb went out of his head.

54
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,989
There wasn't nothin'
Ben could do.

55
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,093
Luke Grayson's been heading
for this for a long time.

56
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,729
Yeah, maybe so.

57
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,666
Miserable end for a man
like Luke Grayson once was.

58
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,435
You had to do this,
didn't you, Ben Cartwright?

59
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:52,098
You had to kill him.

60
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,710
(theme song playing)

61
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,189
DRIVER:
Hyah!

62
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,991
Hyah...!

63
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,357
Hyah, hyah!

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,470
Hyah! Hyah!

65
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,063
Giddyap!

66
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,850
Well, Todd, this is the end
of our long journey.

67
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,919
Virginia City.

68
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,687
(scoffs)
Doesn't look like either of us

69
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,489
are gonna get much of a welcome.

70
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,858
But Pa must've got my letter.

71
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,128
I wrote him right after he sent
me the money for the fair.

72
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,463
Well, time's pretty valuable

73
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,833
to a man as rich and important
as you say your pa is.

74
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,501
He probably left word for you.

75
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,036
Let's ask around.

76
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,405
Well, if that's the thing to do,
I-I want to thank you anyway,

77
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,207
for looking out for me
the way you have.

78
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,076
Aw. Agent?

79
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,511
Yes, sir?

80
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,180
You know a man
called Luke Grayson?

81
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,682
Sure. Who don't?

82
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,151
Well, he was supposed
to meet this stage.

83
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:48,221
Well, now, he ain't gonna meet
this stage or any other.

84
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,656
You'll find him over yonder.

85
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,527
MAN:
You don't mean he's dead?

86
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,728
AGENT:
Well, now, Ab Jenkins

87
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,630
ain't buried
a live one recently.

88
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,632
However, I think the townspeople
would've been willing

89
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,501
to make an exception
in this case.

90
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,437
No...

91
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,706
No, he can't be dead.

92
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,198
He... can't be dead!

93
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,549
Ain't that terrible?

94
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,385
That boy came all the way
from Boston to see his father.

95
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,553
Father?!

96
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,216
Is that Luke's kid?

97
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,195
Are you sure there's nothing
more Hoss and I can do?

98
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,564
Appears to me you done
too much already.

99
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:35,468
I don't like the way
you said that, Mr. Jenkins.

100
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,204
Everybody knows
it was either Pa or Luke.

101
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,506
You know that
ain't what I mean, Hoss.

102
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,809
I was referring
to all the expense--

103
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,644
paying for the best funeral.

104
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,880
The sheriff has a special fund
to foot that kind of bill.

105
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,950
Yeah. The sheriff
didn't gun Luke down, I did.

106
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,985
We'll see you at the services.

107
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,647
Thank you.

108
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,061
Get out of my way.
Let me to him!

109
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,880
Is that Luke Grayson?

110
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,349
I'm afraid so.

111
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,452
Not the way I remember him.

112
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,183
That's not the way at all.

113
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,994
How did he die?

114
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,463
I'm afraid this ain't
the time or the place to...

115
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,465
Look mister,
I got a right to know.

116
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,500
He was my father.

117
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,594
Todd.

118
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,905
Todd Grayson.

119
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,745
I'd have known you anywhere.

120
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,815
It's all Luke talked about
the last few days.

121
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,217
If there's ever
anything I can do...

122
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,086
What do you know about him?

123
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,455
I'm Dianne Jordan.

124
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,524
Luke and I were...

125
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,159
your father and I...

126
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,461
Well, he must have
written you about me.

127
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,463
How did he die?

128
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,131
Now look, son, this is no time

129
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,766
to be talking
about things like this.

130
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,501
Isn't it?
Why isn't it?

131
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:18,137
He'll have to know the truth
sooner or later.

132
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,939
Your father was murdered.

133
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,010
Shot down in cold blood
by a man named Ben Cartwright.

134
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,638
Now, you know better
than that, Dianne.

135
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,115
Son...

136
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,484
this ain't the same
as back east.

137
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,719
When a man draws a gun
on another man...

138
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,354
Ben Cartwright.

139
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,157
Why did he want
to kill my father?

140
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,392
If you're Ben Cartwright,

141
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,861
you don't have to have
an excuse to kill a man.

142
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,697
Dianne, I won't have this talk.

143
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,029
Now, look...

144
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,927
Boy, you come with me a minute.

145
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,278
It's your father's gun.

146
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,847
Take a good look.

147
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,582
It'll show he fired twice.

148
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,885
There was no way back
after that.

149
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,582
He fired even before
Ben Cartwright drew.

150
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,658
My father's gun...

151
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,395
He wore it proudly.

152
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,660
It was a famous gun once.

153
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,468
Uh, son, the gun,
I think I ought

154
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,470
to turn that over
to the sheriff.

155
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,272
Why? It was Luke's gun,
wasn't it?

156
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,607
Well, yeah, sure, but...

157
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,709
Then it should go to the boy.

158
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,338
Everything Luke left
should go to the boy.

159
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,848
Your father left
some other things

160
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,584
over at my place, with me.

161
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,951
I know he'd want
you to have them.

162
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,426
...nor is it for us
to condemn the victor

163
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,630
even while we mourn the fallen.

164
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,034
We can only hope that the soul
of Luke Grayson shall achieve,

165
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,103
in the everlasting life beyond,

166
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,305
the forgiveness...

167
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,605
and peace
denied him on this earth.

168
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,204
Let us pray.

169
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,282
(cocks gun)

170
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,118
You better say one
for yourself, Mr. Cartwright,

171
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,588
'cause it's...
it's gonna be your last.

172
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,822
You murdered my father,

173
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,791
and now they're gonna
bury you along with him.

174
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,226
Don't be a fool, boy.

175
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,961
Put up your gun.

176
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,263
TODD:
When I'm finished with it!

177
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,731
Son, this is your last warning.

178
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,333
You might get off
the first shot,

179
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,236
- but I'll get off the second.
- Hold it, Sheriff.

180
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,605
He's just a scared kid now.

181
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,675
Sure, I'm scared,
but that's not gonna stop me.

182
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,210
Todd... for your own sake,
listen to me.

183
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,712
It was no murder.

184
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,014
Ben Cartwright did everything
he could to avoid bloodshed.

185
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,250
You keep out of this!
It isn't your fight!

186
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,986
It doesn't have to be
anybody's fight, son.

187
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,988
If I'd done what you think,

188
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,557
do you believe
I'd be a free man today?

189
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,527
Oh, I've heard
all about you Cartwrights.

190
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:58,589
You can even buy your way out
of murder, but not this time.

191
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:00,900
Let me... let me go!

192
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,002
(sobbing): I'll kill him!
I'll kill him!

193
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,061
I'll kill him...

194
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,141
Todd, it's all right.

195
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,743
It's all gonna be all right,

196
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,111
just the way
I promised your father.

197
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,603
I don't want
any favors from anyone.

198
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,253
That's all right, Todd.

199
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,090
Your father was that way, too.

200
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,891
He wasn't the sort of man to ask
anyone for a favor, either.

201
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,632
You put him there,
Ben Cartwright.

202
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,000
Think of that when
you try to sleep tonight.

203
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,676
Now, I've addressed
the complaint

204
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,077
to Judge Parker in Eureka.

205
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,546
He should be there
by the first of the month,

206
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,749
- and he can head straight back.
- Well, that's fine.

207
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,484
That should only take
about three weeks.

208
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,452
Now, what happens
to the boy till then?

209
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,720
Well, I reckon the taxpayers

210
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,222
can stand expense
of another boarder.

211
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,991
Hang it all, Roy, you can't
keep that boy behind bars!

212
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,259
He's not a criminal!

213
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,795
He's a 16-year-old kid!

214
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,864
With a 16-year-old gun.

215
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,533
Ben, do you realize
that if that kid

216
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,269
was just a split second sooner,
you wouldn't be around

217
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,761
to watch either one of them
grow any older?

218
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,307
That's right, Pa.

219
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,710
A sidewinder is just as
poisonous the day he's hatched

220
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,745
as he is when he's full grow'd.

221
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,714
Yeah, well, we're not
talking about sidewinders,

222
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,083
we're talking about a boy.

223
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,386
Besides, the fangs of this one
have already been pulled.

224
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,922
And I aim to see
that he don't get a chance

225
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,090
to grow another set.

226
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,625
Leastways,
until the circuit judge

227
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,527
decides what
happens to him next.

228
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,530
Well... a lot of things
can happen till then.

229
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,331
But not with the boy in here,

230
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,133
eating himself up
with grief and all.

231
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,368
It's just no good, Roy!

232
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,104
What do you want me to do,
take him by the hand

233
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,573
and tell him that nice
little boys just don't go out

234
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,475
a-murderin' their elders
and turn him loose?

235
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,000
(door opens)

236
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,184
I've come for the boy.

237
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,385
The boy?!

238
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,786
Hold on, Dianne.

239
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,189
He's my responsibility,
isn't he?

240
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,558
Who else is gonna
look after him?

241
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,359
He was Luke Grayson's son.

242
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,861
And I'm the only one around here

243
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,296
that cared anything
about Luke Grayson,

244
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,931
so that gives me
a right to the boy.

245
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,835
Dianne, it's not a matter
of who the boy's father is.

246
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,471
It's just that,
well, he's upset,

247
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,373
and he's kind of dangerous
when he feels this way.

248
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,776
Well, I could take care
of him, Sheriff.

249
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,611
I could give him a home.

250
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:26,679
Where?

251
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,780
In the saloon?

252
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,483
Roy, please.

253
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,552
You stay out of this,
Cartwright.

254
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,554
I don't care what you all
think about me,

255
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,723
but the boy has to have someone.

256
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,291
Don't you understand that?

257
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,893
He needs someone.

258
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,295
I'm sorry, Dianne, but I just
can't turn him over to you.

259
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,167
Well, could I see him?

260
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,168
Why, of course.

261
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,202
That's perfectly all right.

262
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,262
Right over here.

263
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:03,883
Todd?

264
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,485
What do you want?

265
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,477
Well, I-I brought you
these things.

266
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,927
They were your father's.

267
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,629
Gold watch and chain.

268
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,619
Remember this?

269
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,793
Three silver dollars.

270
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,307
That's all he had.

271
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,409
But there must have been more.

272
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,911
He wrote me.

273
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,513
Oh?

274
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,649
What exactly
did he tell you, Todd?

275
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,920
That when I got here,
he'd buy a horse for me, and...

276
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,521
and I'd help him build a house,

277
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:46,625
and-and together we'd...
we'd start a ranch.

278
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,727
Yes, I know.

279
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,162
How would you know?

280
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,264
He never would have showed you
any letters he wrote to me.

281
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,800
No, that's right, he wouldn't.

282
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,003
Besides...

283
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,140
he never would have sent for me
on a three-dollar promise.

284
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,836
He wasn't that kind of a man.

285
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,746
Well, he's gone now,
and, and it doesn't matter.

286
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,549
Well, it does to me!

287
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,884
And it would to you, too,

288
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,487
if you ever meant
anything at all to him.

289
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,979
Well, I don't know
what I meant to him...

290
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,820
...but I certainly know
what he meant to me.

291
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,273
Dianne...

292
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:38,611
is there something I could do
to help with the boy?

293
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,546
What's the matter, Cartwright?

294
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,581
Looking for something
to ease your conscience?

295
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,383
Aw, Dianne, you know
better than that.

296
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,517
Pa's just trying to...

297
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,087
I don't care
what he's trying to do.

298
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,589
How can he know
what I must feel?

299
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,425
How can any of you Cartwrights
know anything about feelings?

300
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,027
You've got everything you want.

301
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:58,020
Isn't any room in your life
for anything like feelings!

302
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,503
(door closes)

303
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,373
Sheriff, I'm not gonna leave
that boy in that jail cell.

304
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,642
Ben, now, I know what you're
thinking, but you're wrong.

305
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,510
You don't owe that kid
any favors.

306
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,979
What makes you so sure
the favor would be for him?

307
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,215
Roy, both of us, we've been
around a pretty long time,

308
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,385
but not so long that we can take
a man's life and just forget it,

309
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,819
whether the man
needed killing or not.

310
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:21,987
I know, Ben.

311
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,489
Now, I don't like
keeping that kid in jail

312
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,991
any more than you do, but what
do you expect me to do with him,

313
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:26,992
turn him over to Dianne?

314
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,428
No, no, turn him over to me.

315
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,629
To you?

316
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,897
Pa, you forgetting what that boy

317
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,832
tried to do to you
out at the cemetery?

318
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,268
Hoss, he's a scared little boy

319
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,337
who traveled 3,000 miles
for what?

320
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,972
For a funeral!

321
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,474
He's hurt, he's confused,
he's-he's alone.

322
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,343
If somebody doesn't
straighten him out now,

323
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,145
he'll wind up
like his father or worse.

324
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,314
Then somebody else
will have blood on his hands.

325
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:52,284
Pa, if-if we do take him,
what are we gonna do with him?

326
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,720
Take him out to the Ponderosa.

327
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,455
Show him what fresh air
feels like.

328
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,657
Give him a horse,
teach him how to ride.

329
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,926
Don't you think I know
what to do with boys?

330
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:05,197
Ah, sure you do, Pa, but...
but this boy wants to kill you.

331
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,766
He thinks he wants to kill me.

332
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,336
But if he stays locked up like
a criminal, he'll be sure of it.

333
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,403
Now, Roy, please believe me.

334
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,938
I know what's best.

335
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,341
Ben, I have all the respect
in the world for your judgment.

336
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,375
I think you're wrong.

337
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,344
But if I do turn him
over to you,

338
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,713
you're gonna have to be
responsible for him all the way.

339
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,214
I'm perfectly willing
to accept that.

340
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:25,017
Boy, he's gonna be
a mighty big handful.

341
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,553
Adam and Little Joe
both going out on a roundup.

342
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,221
Well, we'll be able
to manage him.

343
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,956
But it's only a parole,
nothing more.

344
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,158
And if he steps out of line
just one time,

345
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,827
you're duty-bound
to turn him back to me.

346
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,828
Now, you understand that?

347
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,829
I understand perfectly.

348
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,030
There'll be no trouble.

349
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,199
Pa, I sure hope you know
what you're doing.

350
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,191
So do I.

351
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,861
Mind if I join you?

352
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,529
Don't you believe in knocking?

353
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,364
Oh, that depends.

354
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,533
Your kind never does.

355
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,168
Now, just what is my kind?

356
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,838
I've seen you
in every mining camp

357
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,308
and every tank town honky-tonk
between here and Mexico.

358
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,746
Maybe not the same face
or the same fancy duds, but...

359
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:32,551
the same cold eyes,
same way of walking

360
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,421
and the same stink
of killing on you.

361
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,957
Well, now that
we understand each other,

362
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,949
I'll have that drink.

363
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,765
Nice place you've got here.

364
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,825
Fine taste in furniture.

365
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,372
Now, um, you didn't come here

366
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,808
just to talk about
my taste in furniture.

367
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,043
Now, don't be too sure
about that.

368
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,146
Let's just call this
a sort of, um, social visit.

369
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,281
(chuckles)

370
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,816
People like you and me--

371
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,818
we never get
enough chance to talk.

372
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,353
Nobody much cares
what we think or how we feel.

373
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,289
Feelings?

374
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,623
Can't afford 'em.

375
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,125
Not anymore.

376
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,726
No?

377
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,429
Then what's this
still around for?

378
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,532
Give it to me.

379
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,534
It's all I have left of him.

380
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,670
That and the boy.

381
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,340
He's on your mind
whether you like it or not.

382
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,176
He's nothing to me anymore.

383
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,312
Now that I know
he's in good hands.

384
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,645
The hands
that killed his father.

385
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,651
That kid's got spunk.

386
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,521
How long do you think he'll take
what Ben Cartwright dishes out?

387
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,989
Come on, admit it.

388
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,891
Sooner or later,
he'll make his play.

389
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:49,328
Then he'll get himself
killed then or hanged later.

390
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,130
What can I do about it?

391
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,698
He won't talk to me.

392
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,832
Maybe he doesn't have to.

393
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,201
Maybe he already has.

394
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,402
What do you mean by that?

395
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,871
I was at the funeral.

396
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,568
He tried to kill Ben Cartwright,
and you didn't try to stop him.

397
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,846
I'm not responsible
for what he tried to do.

398
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,448
Maybe not.

399
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,940
But you were hoping the boy
would pull the trigger.

400
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,387
Or weren't you?

401
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,390
Well, how do you
expect me to feel?

402
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,858
After all,
his father and I were--

403
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,260
Were in love?

404
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,962
That's very touching,
but a little out of my line.

405
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,363
I'm talking about
killing Ben Cartwright.

406
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,068
You'd kill Ben Cartwright?

407
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,970
For a price.

408
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,235
For a price,
I could kill most anybody.

409
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,312
What makes you think
I've got the money?

410
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,413
Well, not you, maybe.

411
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,115
I was thinking of the kid.

412
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,484
On the way out here,
he told me about his father.

413
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,587
That boy's gonna fall into
quite an inheritance.

414
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,579
I haven't sunk that low.

415
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,327
Anyway, even if I wanted
Ben Cartwright dead,

416
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,497
I'd never hire
a two-bit gun like you.

417
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,731
No, I guess you wouldn't.

418
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,223
You can let the boy
do it for you.

419
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,070
Wear something pretty when you
go out to prison to see him.

420
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,344
Think it over.

421
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,336
I'll be around if you need me.

422
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,666
Ain't that the prettiest bunch
of trees you ever seen, Todd?

423
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,911
You ever been to Boston?

424
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,913
No, can't say as I have.

425
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,717
How do you know they don't have
prettier trees there?

426
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,986
Well... you got something there.

427
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,487
Never thought of it, I reckon.

428
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:59,151
Guess there are lots of things
you never thought of.

429
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,995
Yeah.

430
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,999
Yep, I reckon
you're right at that, too.

431
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,000
What about that horse?

432
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,334
You think you can ride him?

433
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,633
What's so hard
about riding a horse?

434
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,663
Come on.

435
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,177
Yes, sir, there's a whole lot
more to being a cowboy

436
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,847
than just smelling like one
or wearing boots.

437
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,348
For instance, you always get up

438
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,850
on the left-hand side
of a horse.

439
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,351
And you walk up to him
real easy-like,

440
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,820
so's you don't spook him.

441
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,355
Go on, try it.

442
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,654
Go on.

443
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,695
- (neighing)
- Todd!

444
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,864
The left side.

445
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,065
Doggone it, boy.

446
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,700
When are you gonna
get it through

447
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,735
that ornery head of yours,
we're trying to help you?

448
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,737
Help me?
You-You think I want to ride

449
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,439
that sweaty old bag of bones?!

450
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,608
I don't give a hoot
whether you want to or not.

451
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:50,609
You're going to.

452
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,777
You think you can make me?!

453
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,812
You dad-gum tommy-tootin' I can.

454
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,447
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

455
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,982
Pa, I don't know.

456
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,884
I've tried my best
with this boy.

457
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,752
I can't seem to do
nothin' to please him.

458
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,488
Oh? What seems to be
the trouble, son?

459
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,857
Look, I came out here
because the sheriff made me.

460
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,392
That doesn't mean
I have to like it!

461
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:11,263
Now, look, Todd, when you're
here on the Ponderosa,

462
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,432
you're here as a guest,
not as a prisoner.

463
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,301
Will you try to remember that?

464
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,471
Howdy, Ben, Hoss.

465
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,473
Roy, it's good to see you.

466
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:22,908
How are things in town, Sheriff?

467
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,109
Fair to middling.

468
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,610
How you getting along
with young Todd here?

469
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,812
Oh, just fine, Roy, just fine.

470
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,180
Everything's going fine.

471
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,649
Gonna make a rancher
out of him yet, aren't we, Todd?

472
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,219
Ben, uh, I've been thinking.

473
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,456
Maybe I overstepped my bounds
in letting you take that boy.

474
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:40,225
Well, I-I said I'd assume
full responsibility.

475
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,893
Yeah, but just the same,

476
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,929
technically,
he's still in my custody.

477
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:47,265
Where are you figuring on
sleeping him?

478
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,468
Well, most of the hands are out

479
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,036
with Adam and Little Joe
on roundup.

480
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,904
I figured I'd give him
the foreman's room there,

481
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,773
so he could have
a place of his own.

482
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,765
Mm-hmm.

483
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,557
Seems solid enough, exceptin'
for that window in the back.

484
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,993
You can see that from
your room though, can't you?

485
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,695
Now, wait a minute, Roy.

486
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,231
This here's a boy's room,
it's not a jail cell.

487
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,800
Not as far as I'm concerned.

488
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,703
And, Ben...
put a lock on that door

489
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,671
after the kid goes to bed
tonight, you hear?

490
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,540
Well, I'll be heading
back to town.

491
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,876
Roy, we got supper
on the table in there.

492
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,210
Why don't you stay
and eat with us?

493
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,702
I wish I could, Hoss,
but I gotta get back.

494
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,732
I'm sorry we're late, Pa,
but Todd here couldn't quite

495
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,234
make up his mind whether
he wanted to eat or not.

496
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:59,671
Well, believe me, Todd, I never
had any trouble like that

497
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,440
with Hoss when he was your age.

498
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,931
Not since, either.

499
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,054
Mmm! You know something, Hoss?

500
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,590
This beef is about
the tastiest we've ever had.

501
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,116
Mmm! That gravy looks good, too.

502
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,165
Now, there's
no sense in this, boy.

503
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:30,202
I know you're hungry--
why don't you sit down and eat?

504
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,370
Do you think I'd eat
at the same table

505
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,039
with the man
that killed my father?

506
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,507
HOSS:
Todd, we're just trying

507
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,943
to help you--
can't you understand that, boy?

508
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,311
Don't do me any favors!

509
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,646
Now, look, I'm not afraid of you
or any other Cartwright.

510
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,582
And I'm not gonna take orders
from you, either.

511
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,381
Now I said I wasn't gonna eat
at this table, and I won't!

512
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,022
(door opens)

513
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,157
(door closes)

514
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,992
Don't let him
spoil your supper, Pa.

515
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,221
You done all you could.

516
00:24:56,561 --> 00:25:00,966
That boy's been through
a pretty rough day, Hoss.

517
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,402
Probably hasn't eaten since
breakfast, maybe even longer.

518
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:07,873
Made up his mind to hate
everything about this place...

519
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,541
starting with us.

520
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,942
Well...

521
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:14,613
he didn't exactly
choose to come here.

522
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,781
Look at it another way.

523
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:19,885
Now, suppose I'd been the one
who'd been gunned down.

524
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,887
How would you feel
about breaking bread

525
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,014
with Luke Grayson?

526
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,025
Yeah.

527
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,393
I reckon I never looked
at it like that, Pa.

528
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,799
Hoss...

529
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,402
take the supper
out to the bunkhouse.

530
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,271
The boy's got to eat.

531
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,972
Yes, sir.

532
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:44,704
Don't be surprised if I
come back with a finger bit off.

533
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,126
Pa thought you might
change your mind about supper.

534
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,627
I brung you something to eat.

535
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,863
Well, you can take it
right back to him.

536
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,265
I said I don't want anything
from you Cartwrights.

537
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,934
Look, Todd...

538
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,703
I don't care how mad
a man gets about something,

539
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,272
his stomach goes right on
needing something to eat.

540
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,207
You think you
can make me eat that?

541
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,043
No. No, I can't.

542
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,278
And I wouldn't want
to make you eat it.

543
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,547
But if Pa thought
you was down here hungry

544
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,549
and there wasn't
no food here for you,

545
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,051
he'd feel real bad about it.

546
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:29,387
Your father doesn't care
anything about me.

547
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,690
Todd, what makes you say that?

548
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,958
What makes me say it?

549
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,492
Because it's the truth,
that's why!

550
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:35,894
Ben Cartwright's a liar!

551
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:38,229
- Now, you listen here, boy...
- No, you listen.

552
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,365
You must think I'm
two years old or something,

553
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,734
you and all your talk about,
'bout teaching me to ride.

554
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,402
Well, I don't want to ride, see?

555
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,804
And I've had just about enough

556
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,173
of your father's talk
about me being a guest here.

557
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,841
Todd, he meant that.

558
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,811
You are a guest here,
as far as we're concerned.

559
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,145
Oh, am I?

560
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:57,749
I suppose you put locks
on the doors of all your guests?

561
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,351
There's your supper!

562
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,286
You can take that back to him

563
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,017
and tell him I'm sick
of his kind of favors.

(gasping)
It's Todd.

587
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,387
He stole an empty... empty gun
out of the desk drawer.

588
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,389
Tried to kill me.

589
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,191
Tried to kill you?!

00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,893
Well, the little varmint.

00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,629
- Where is he?
- Outside somewhere.

592
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,731
Probably hiding
like a scared animal,

593
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,567
waiting for you and me
and a dozen other grown men

594
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,269
to come chasing after him.

595
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,537
Well, Pa, you ain't gonna
just let him go, are you?

596
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,039
No, I'm not gonna let him go.

597
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,741
I'm not gonna go
running after him, either.

598
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,076
- But, Pa, he tried to kill you.
- With an empty gun.

599
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,978
Yeah, but, Pa,
he didn't know it was empty.

600
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,314
Dad-burn it, how far does your
obligation go with this boy?

601
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,715
- Hoss, please!
- Please, nothing, Pa!

602
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,351
After all you done for that boy.
You gave him a home, you--

603
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,654
Least I could do
after what I did to him!

604
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,590
Sheriff Roy Coffey--

605
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,726
I have to think of his position.

606
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,762
Regardless of what I think,

607
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,898
I... I'm gonna have
to tell Roy what happened.

608
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,401
He probably stole
one of our horses and...

609
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,670
halfway to San Francisco by now.

610
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,338
How far do you think
he could get?

611
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,006
You saw the way he rode,
didn't you?

612
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,441
Yeah, but I got a sneaking hunch

613
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,443
he wasn't doing
his best, neither.

614
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,612
Well, he'll probably...

615
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,048
try to find his way
back to Virginia City.

616
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,650
If he did, we'll...
we'll find him there.

617
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:37,088
I'm not gonna run after him;
not tonight anyhow, I...

618
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,923
(Ben gasping)

619
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,492
Let's try to get some rest.

620
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:45,224
We'll go see the sheriff
first thing in the morning.

621
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,019
It's getting late, honey.

622
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,621
Why don't you go to bed?

623
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:11,990
Go to bed?

624
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,992
I haven't slept since he died.

625
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,327
You gotta go on living, kid.

626
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,296
Yeah.

627
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,298
That's just the trouble.

628
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,133
Living and...

629
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,125
thinking.

630
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,239
Looking at nothing but <i>this</i>
day and night.

631
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,936
You really loved him,
didn't you?

632
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,612
Sure.

633
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,848
Funny, isn't it, Charlie?

634
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:41,286
Me falling in love
with a guy like Luke Grayson.

635
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,633
He really wasn't much, huh?

636
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,002
Couldn't keep a job.

637
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,104
Always getting in fights.

638
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,106
Always getting drunk.

639
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:05,338
Half the time he didn't
even know I was alive.

640
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,614
Funny, isn't it, Charlie?

641
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,682
You're not laughing.

642
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:14,015
Nope. I ain't laughing.

643
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,523
You remember how he was?

644
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:22,126
When he'd walk down the street,
all the women'd get mad

645
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,562
that they'd met
their own husbands.

646
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,098
I was just like 'em.

647
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,333
My eyes would follow him
wherever he went.

648
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,170
He was so...
so tall and straight

649
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,372
and...

650
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,705
and that smile that...

651
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:44,043
He was like that to me
until the day he died.

652
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,844
You want another drink, kid?

653
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,523
Yeah, I guess so.

654
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:55,186
Better than trying
to get to sleep.

655
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,358
Thanks.

656
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,141
Are you open for business?

657
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,110
Sure, I'm open for business.
What can I do for you?

658
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,745
I want to buy a gun.

659
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:48,946
Guns cost money, boy.

660
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,181
I-I've got money.

661
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,482
It's not much,
it's three dollars,

662
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,651
but that ought to buy
a gun of some kind.

663
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,254
I don't have a gun
I can let go for three dollars.

664
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,356
Look, mister,
any gun, an old one.

665
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,624
M-Maybe you've got
something here

666
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,293
that somebody left on a bill
or something like that.

667
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,729
Son, you might as well know,

668
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,498
I wouldn't sell a gun
to Luke Grayson's boy

669
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,300
for $3.00 or $3,000.

670
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,835
And nobody else
in town would, either.

671
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,360
Now just run along
and forget it.

672
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,547
(grunts)

673
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:54,271
(hoofbeats clopping past)

674
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,001
♪♪

675
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,439
DIANNE: Well, good
night, Charlie.

676
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,392
Todd, what are you doing here?

677
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,660
Mind your own business.

678
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,061
Leave me alone.

679
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,329
Todd, you're in trouble.

680
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,698
What's happened?

681
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,034
I-I tried
to kill Ben Cartwright.

682
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,969
Well, Todd, they'll catch you.

683
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,404
They'll put you in jail.

684
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:29,206
I don't care what they do to me.

685
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,275
Well, we can't stand here
talking like this.

686
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,576
Someone will see us.

687
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:33,908
Here, come with me.

688
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,289
Ben, it's just bad seed.

689
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,158
I knew Luke Grayson
when he amounted to something,

690
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,026
but he still had
that bad streak in him.

691
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,729
The boy's got it now,
just as same as the old man had.

692
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,364
You got any idea
which way he headed?

693
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,633
Well, he came this way,
as close as we can figure.

694
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,234
Well, I'll get a couple
of deputies.

695
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,537
I'd like
to have you come along, Hoss.

696
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,138
Ben?

697
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,640
Yeah, might as well get started.

698
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,632
Good.

699
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,051
Bert...

700
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,386
what happened to you?

701
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,121
Uh, Luke Grayson's kid came in
the store

702
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,456
and wanted to buy a gun.

703
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,491
I refused to sell it to him.

704
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,827
When I turned around, he hit me
on the head with an ax handle.

705
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,596
Don't you think you better have
a doctor take a look at you?

706
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,665
Well, I don't know.
Kind of stunned me for a minute.

707
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,333
I kept seeing the kid
taking the gun,

708
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,802
and I couldn't make my legs work
quick enough to stop him.

709
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,170
He took a gun?

710
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,472
That's right.

711
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,540
Six-shooter and some shells.

712
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,142
He knew what he was doing.

713
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,044
Ben, you better
take him up to the doctor.

714
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,479
Hoss will go along with me.

715
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,913
BEN:
All right.

716
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,082
And Ben, it's not just
a 16-year-old boy

717
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,584
we're dealing with.

718
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,019
It's Luke Grayson's kid,
and he's got a loaded gun.

719
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,221
All right, Roy.

720
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,956
All right.

721
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:55,659
I asked you,
where did you get that gun?

722
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,958
I told you--
I just got it, that's all.

723
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,431
Now that you've got it,

724
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,699
what are you going
to do with it?

725
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,033
I'm going
to kill Ben Cartwright.

726
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,769
What do you think
I'm going to do with it?

727
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:05,936
Now listen to me--

728
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:08,272
I want him dead
just as much as you do,

729
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,608
but what chance do you think
a kid like you will have

730
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:11,776
against all those grown men?

731
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,044
All I need is just
one clear shot.

732
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,180
Don't you realize
that they'll cut you to ribbons

733
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,808
the minute
you walk outside this room?

734
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,218
Todd, what are you going to do?

735
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,520
I'm getting out of here.

736
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,754
No, Todd. Wait.

737
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,523
There's another way.

738
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,515
Wh-What are you talking about?

739
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:32,329
If I help you,
will you promise me

740
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,199
that you'll leave Virginia City
and never come back here again?

741
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,191
How can you help me?

742
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,647
This is a draft

743
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:52,983
on the First City Bank
of San Francisco-- $500.

744
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,052
If I sign it,
it'll be payable to bearer.

745
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:57,822
Five hundred dollars.

746
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,557
Then I was right.

747
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,025
Right about what?

748
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,293
This is my father's money.

749
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,761
You were holding out on me.

750
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:04,929
Holding out on you?

751
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,664
Todd, I'm just trying
to help you.

752
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:09,133
Look, if my father
gave you this, you keep it.

753
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,035
I don't even want
to hear about it.

754
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,436
(door opens)

755
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:16,173
Maybe you don't need it, kid...

756
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,309
but I do.

757
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,077
You won't need that gun.

758
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,479
I'm on your side.

759
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,680
Right, Dianne?

760
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,215
What are you doing here?

761
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,884
I told you
I'd be here when you needed me.

762
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,118
I think you do now.

763
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,854
And I know you stole that gun.

764
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:32,356
So does the sheriff,
and he's coming to get you.

765
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:35,826
I've got to get him out of here,
get him to San Francisco.

766
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,928
Do you think
you could you do it?

767
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,097
I can do it for $500.

768
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,433
You see, I was listening
outside your door.

769
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,235
Now that's not
socially correct maybe,

770
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,203
but it's a way
to find things out.

771
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:49,367
Now you just sign it, and
I'll get the kid out of town.

772
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,945
There's only one thing.

773
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,815
You mustn't cash it
until you get to San Francisco.

774
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,183
Sure. I'm in no hurry.

775
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,852
What are you doing?
I don't want anything from you!

776
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,054
Look, my father wouldn't have
anything to do

777
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,046
with a woman like you.

778
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,059
Now, look, boy,

779
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,728
you do as you're told,

780
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,788
or I'll let
the sheriff have you.

781
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,081
Cash that for me.

782
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,750
Five hundred dollars?!

783
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,451
That's a lot of money.

784
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,020
You've got that much
in the till.

785
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,721
Just go ahead and cash it.

786
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,691
I... I've never seen anything
quite like this before.

787
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:41,959
Mr. Cartwright?

788
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,193
Yes, Charlie?

789
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,229
Would you take a look
at this for me?

790
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,597
Yes. What is it?

791
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,332
It's a bank draft.
You know about these things.

792
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:49,900
- I wish you'd look it over.
- Fine.

793
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,936
He doesn't have to look it over.
It's good.

794
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,905
It's got Dianne Jordan's
signature on it.

795
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,677
Why did she give you this?

796
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,879
I don't think that's any
of your business, Cartwright.

797
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,814
This has something to do
with Todd, doesn't it?

798
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:04,982
What's the matter, Cartwright?

799
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,150
Can't you hear good?

800
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,685
Where's the boy?

801
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,186
You've got my money.

802
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,382
I said, where's the boy?

803
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,059
I don't like people touching me,

804
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,494
and I don't like 'em
grabbing my money.

805
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:21,365
If this is yours legitimately,
you'll get it back,

806
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,634
but not until I've talked
to Dianne about this.

807
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,967
Ben!

808
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,911
Here...

809
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,038
Go on, that way.

810
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,619
(knocking on door)

811
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,320
BEN:
Dianne?

812
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,189
Are you in there, Dianne?

813
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,024
It's Ben Cartwright.

814
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,822
The door's open.

815
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,028
I think this belongs to you.

816
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,906
Where did you get that?

817
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:06,010
From that two-bit gunman
who's been hanging around town.

818
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,878
He tried to cash it downstairs.

819
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,245
DIANNE:
He tried to cash it?

820
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,208
Well, what business
is it of yours?

821
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,422
Maybe I owed it to him.

822
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,491
Maybe he did me a favor once.

823
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,192
Well, did he?

824
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,561
Or was he about
to do you a favor...

825
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,530
like killing me.

826
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,831
It was Luke's money.

827
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,299
Luke owed it to Appling, and--

828
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,935
Dianne, Luke never had $50
as long as I knew him,

829
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,103
much less $500.

830
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,271
Get out of here.

831
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,140
I don't have to sit here
and listen

832
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,775
to you saying these things
about Luke.

833
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,143
You killed him.
Isn't that enough?

834
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,778
Don't you think
the whole town knows

835
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,146
it was you who supported Luke?

836
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,415
Don't you think they know
it was you who fed him,

837
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,483
who clothed him, who even
gave him his drinking money?

838
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:49,820
And all the time, he didn't
even know you were alive.

839
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,522
That's not true.

840
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,923
Luke was good to me.

841
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,458
He loved me.

842
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,226
Did he?

843
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,562
Do you think Luke was capable
of loving anyone,

844
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,764
or even of thinking of anyone
other than himself?

845
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,667
Stop that! I won't listen
to you saying such things.

846
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,903
I won't listen, do you hear?
I won't listen!

847
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,271
Dianne...

848
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:11,075
you know that
what I'm saying is the truth.

849
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:14,344
And one day you're gonna have
to face that truth.

850
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:17,915
Where's the boy?

851
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,516
(gun clicks)

852
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,151
- (Dianne gasps)
- Right here, Cartwright.

853
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,754
It's easy to lie about a man
when he's dead

854
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,322
and can't talk back, isn't it?

855
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:26,824
Todd, put away that gun.

856
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,959
I'll put it away
after I kill you.

857
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,361
And this time,
I'm not going to miss.

858
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,131
This time,
I got bullets in the gun.

859
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,929
Todd, don't. Wait!

860
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:38,635
Todd, stop!

861
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,571
He killed my father.
Are you forgetting that?

862
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,872
No, I'm not forgetting,

863
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,041
but everything he said
about your father was true.

864
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,476
No, it's a pack of lies.

865
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:47,144
No, it wasn't a pack of lies.

866
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,781
Look, I knew your father better
than anyone in the whole world.

867
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:53,016
He wasn't any good,

868
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:56,220
just like Ben Cartwright said.

869
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,888
He was no good.

870
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,189
No. You're lying.

871
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:00,657
He... He sent me money.

872
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,527
He wanted me to come out here
and live with him.

873
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,796
DIANNE:
He never sent you a dime.

874
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:08,432
Every honest dollar
that Luke got, he drank faster

875
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,567
than he could walk
to the post office.

876
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,904
That $500 that I gave
to Appling was mine.

877
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,873
The money--

878
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,741
the check that you got
every month

879
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:20,577
to keep you in school--
that was mine.

880
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,646
Even the money
that you were sent

881
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:25,249
to bring you back here
to Virginia City was mine.

882
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,351
See, I thought if he...

883
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:31,054
if he saw his own son, that that
would help him straighten out.

884
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,390
It couldn't be.

885
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,459
If he was so bad,
why would you...?

886
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,161
DIANNE:
Why did I stick to him?

887
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,696
Because I loved him.

888
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:42,299
(crying)

889
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,902
I loved him
from the first moment I saw him.

890
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,894
(sobbing)

891
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,238
(uncocks gun)

892
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,751
Give me the gun, boy.

893
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:22,406
I keep trying to remember him
the way I wanted him to be.

894
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,672
He was such a wonderful man.

895
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:31,481
Such a rotten, lousy,
stinkin'...

896
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,041
wonderful man.

897
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,786
Pa, you all right?

898
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:11,989
Charlie just told us
what happened.

899
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:13,724
Yeah, I'm all right, Hoss.

900
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,460
That boy-- he's going
to be all right now, too.

901
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,829
I'm still gonna have
to take him in, Ben.

902
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:20,030
He stole a gun.

903
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,767
Did he, Roy?

904
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,836
An empty gun.

905
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:28,305
Now, what do you think
that would be worth?

906
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,297
The lives of two people?

907
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,902
I guess
it ain't worth a thing, Ben.

908
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:40,017
Oh, Roy, uh, in case
you happen to think about it,

909
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:42,152
that, uh, horse of ours--

910
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,587
the boy didn't steal it.

911
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,656
I just gave it to him.

912
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,190
That right, Hoss?

913
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,759
Yes, sir, that-that's right.

914
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,827
Roy, you-you tell him
to ride him out

915
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:51,995
and pay us a visit.

916
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:53,964
BEN: And tell him
to bring his new ma.

917
