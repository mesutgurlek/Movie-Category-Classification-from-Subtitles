00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,569
Now, if the young lady
will open her eyes

4
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,170
and examine
the spots on the card.

5
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,205
They're gone!

6
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,806
But not your fingers,
I hope.

7
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:48,740
No...

8
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:49,975
Ladies and
gentlemen,

9
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,411
any of you can
shoot the spots
from playing cards,

10
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:56,048
given a steady hand,
keen eyes, iron nerves...

11
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,549
and 12 years
of practice.

12
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,792
My gratitude
for your assistance.

13
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,160
And to show
my appreciation,

14
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:09,361
I'd like to present you

15
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,996
with these
beautiful earrings.

16
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,397
I was told that
they once belonged

17
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,500
to the grand padishah
of Hindustan.

(<i> audience laughs</i> )

19
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:16,802
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Carter.

20
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:17,903
Thank you.

21
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:18,837
You're very welcome;
thank you.

(<i> applause</i> )

23
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,907
Now, would another intrepid soul
step forward

24
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,442
to assist in a demonstration

25
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:26,078
which has astounded the crowned
heads of 11 countries?

26

(<i> audience murmuring</i> )

27
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,514
Anyone will do.

28
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,216
No harm can possibly
come to you.

29
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,519
Aha, I see I have a candidate.

30
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,454
That's the spirit, young fellow.

31
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:37,256
Up the steps
right onto the stage.

32
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,390
Bring your feet with you.

33
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,758
(<i> audience chuckles</i> )

34
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,360
Stand there.

35
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,328
Take this deck of cards.

36
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,364
While my back is turned,
choose one--

37
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:46,365
any card will do.

38
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,366
CARTER:
Do you have it?

39
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:48,500
YOUNG MAN:
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,902
CARTER:
Show it to
the audience.

41
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,103
What do you
think?

42
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:52,571
Sure enough
resembles him.

43
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,439
Exceptin' the time I seen him,
he had whiskers.

44
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,741
(<i> someone shushes men</i> )

45
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:58,410
Well, the best thing is
to catch him outside.

46
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,145
CARTER:
Now put it back
in the deck.

47
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,814
Now watch closely.

48
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,883
In my left hand
I have the deck of cards,

49
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,252
in my right, the personal
throwing weapon

50
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,021
of the late
Colonel James Bowie.

51
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,056
With its help,
I shall endeavor

52
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,458
to discover the card
in question.

Well, I'll be!

55
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,734

Colonel
Desmond?

61
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,622
Colonel
Desmond?

62
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,090
You gentlemen
speaking to me?

63
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,191
We were.

64
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,559
Afraid there must be
some mistake.

65
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,827
The name is
Johnny Carter.

66
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,761
Ah, no it
ain't.

67
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,163
I couldn't forget you,
Colonel.

68
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,931
Our outfit fought
right alongside of you

69
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:53,932
at Forest Ridge.

70
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,033
Just a minute,
Scamper.

71
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,102
Maybe introductions
are in order,

72
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,203
Mr., uh, Carter.

73
00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:59,938
This is Mr. Newton,
Sergeant Joad,

74
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,406
and I'm Jeb Bassett.

75
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,176
All formerly of
the Ninth Virginia.

76
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,577
How do you do?

77
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,816
You were in the Confederate
Army, Mister... Carter?

78
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:11,883
Why, yes.

79
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,719
Yes, I was.

80
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:14,620
Good.

81
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,021
We want to make you
a proposition.

82
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:19,091
We need a man like you
where we live-- Coppertown--

83
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,093
to keep us from losing
our claims.

84
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,861
I know nothing
about mining.

85
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,296
The mines are all right.

86
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,831
There's something else.

87
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,834
We're being frozen out
because we're Southerners.

88
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,535
Coppertown's smelter
won't buy our ore.

89
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,237
We've had accidents
in the mine.

90
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,672
Three men killed already.

91
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,907
When one of us tries
to take ore to Mesa City,

92
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,310
something always happens
to him or his wagon.

93
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:39,311
What about
the law?

94
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:40,312
Get away
from me,

95
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,913
you overgrown
jackrabbit.

96
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:45,050
The law's against us, too,
won't raise a finger to help.

97
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:48,754
That's why we need a man like
you, Colonel-- er, Mr. Carter--

98
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:49,988
as a leader and...

99
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,356
Law breaker?

100
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,425
Let's say someone
who can face up to the law

101
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,693
if it isn't doing right.

102
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,429
What in tarnation do you want?

103
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,598
Chewing tobacco,
Sergeant.

104
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,899
SCAMPER:
Chewing tobacco?

105
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,735
Why-why, I never heard
of anything like...

106
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:04,836
What brand?

107
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:05,837
Here you are.

108
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,705
Well, gentlemen,

109
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,173
it's true I was
in the war,

110
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,241
but as a corporal.

111
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,642
But now I'm
a peaceful man,

112
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,544
following
a peaceful occupation.

113
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,180
I'm sorry, but I must refuse
your invitation.

114
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,616
Good night.

115
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,017
Colonel?

116
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,986
We were told to give you
a special message

117
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,088
from the man who brought us
out here--

118
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,589
Mr. Theodosius Roberts,

119
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,559
formerly of
Beardsville, Virginia.

120
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,760
Name's unfamiliar.

121
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,596
We got the wrong man,
Jeb.

122
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:32,831
I guess
you're right.

123
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,700
Nothing on earth could
keep Colonel Desmond

124
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,001
out of the fracas
we got.

125
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,369
Let's mosey.

126
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,441
Keep away from me,
will ya?

00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,151
Three.

168
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,853
Fine way to treat me.

169
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,521
Next time
ask permission.

170
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:10,522
I will.

171
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,523
Next time.

172
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,458
How many?

173
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,960
Two to the dealer.

174
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,631
Check.

175
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,333
Have a nice ride?

176
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,636
Three went and
three came back.

177
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:25,804
MAN:
Oh, Sheriff?

178
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:28,640
SHERIFF:
Well, hello,
Mr. Balfour.

179
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,108
I hope I'm not
interrupting.

180
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,142
Not at all.

181
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,477
What can I
do for you?

182
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,678
Today is payday
at the smelter

183
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,013
and I'd like
your protection.

184
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:35,947
Now, Mr. Balfour,

185
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,849
there ain't gonna be
any trouble.

186
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,051
The Southerners have been
acting strange

187
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,052
the last few days.

188
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,287
Secretive and arrogant.

189
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,424
They're planning something,
maybe robbery.

190
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,559
Robbery?

191
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,127
You better go hold
his hand, Sheriff.

192
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,595
Who, me?

193
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,797
I'm no man for robberies,
I don't even carry a gun--

194
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,165
can't stand the noise!

195
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,067
You go, Travis, and take
Bat here with you.

196
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,435
You're my deputies,
ain't you?

197
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,570
All right.

198
00:08:58,572 --> 00:08:59,771
But I'll tell
you this, Balfour,

199
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,106
the Rebs is
done for.

200
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,641
I disagree.

201
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,777
They're like wolves--
vicious, desperate.

202
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,179
They're just
a defeated people,
Mr. Balfour.

203
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,848
And rightfully so!

204
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:15,053
Slavers, secessionists,
lawbreakers and murderers!

205
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,323
They're like anyone else--
human beings.

206
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,859
I never could understand
why you won't deal with them.

207
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:24,129
Perhaps you would, ma'am,
if you lost a son at Gettysburg!

208
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,165
NEWTON:
Seems we had
the wrong man,

209
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,099
Mr. Roberts.

210
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,368
Some fly-by-night
vaudeville actor.

211
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,469
Name of
Johnny Carter.

212
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,737
That's strange...

213
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,973
He must look
mighty like
Colonel Desmond

214
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,942
because Scamper
was fooled.

215
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,810
Still am, 'ceptin'
it couldn't be,

216
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,412
not after the way
he acted.

217
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,513
We put it
straight to him;

218
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,148
mentioned your name,
like you said,

219
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,949
and told him
that....

220
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,083
(<i> knocking at door</i> )

221
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,484
Who could that be,
Caroline?

222
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,886
I'll go see,
Gramp.

223
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,491
Oh, it's you.

224
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,759
I'm afraid so, ma'am.

225
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,428
You see, I've got
orders to find out...

226
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,562
Same old orders,
Lieutenant,

227
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,930
or some nice,
fresh, new ones?

228
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,732
Well, it's just that
I have to make inquiries

229
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,534
as to whether you've
had any news of...

230
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,336
Oh, no, not again?

231
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:05,337
Sorry, ma'am.

232
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,771
My dear Lieutenant,

233
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,807
I may not look it,
but I'm quite grown up.

234
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,308
I can count up to ten

235
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,644
and I can even remember
as far back as a week ago.

236
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,446
I feel awful about this,
ma'am, but...

237
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,780
Oddly enough,
I can even remember

238
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,349
the questions
you asked me.

239
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:20,185
Now, since you've obviously
forgotten my answers,

240
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,288
I'm going to repeat them
to you again very slowly

241
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,224
and maybe it will save you
another visit.

242
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,861
Now, about my
brother-in-law,
Colonel Desmond.

243
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:30,695
One.

244
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:31,896
I haven't
heard from him.

245
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,398
In fact, I've never
heard from him.

246
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,599
Two.

247
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,034
I've never seen him
in my whole life

248
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,902
and I wouldn't know him
if I did see him,

249
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,671
because he was in
one of your prisons

250
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:40,905
when Tom and I
were married,

251
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:44,242
and he was still there
when Tom was killed.

252
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,243
Three.

253
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,078
And if I had him
right here in my pocket,

254
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,448
I certainly wouldn't
tell you!

255
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,616
Now...

256
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,219
do you think you can
remember all that?

257
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,353
Uh, yes, Mrs. Desmond.

258
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,788
Wonderful.

259
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,856
And isn't it enough

260
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:58,957
that he's
a defeated soldier

261
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,558
without your
persecuting him?

262
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,627
Oh, in this case, ma'am,
it isn't exactly persecution.

263
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,129
Well, what is it?

264
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,564
Well, you see, when Colonel
Desmond was a prisoner of war,

265
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,300
he escaped with the contents
of the Commandant's safe--

266
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,702
$20,000.

267
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,203
Good for him.

268
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,239
Well, now, why didn't you
tell me that before?

269
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,573
That's wonderful!

270
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,143
I'm afraid the United States
government feels different.

271
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,845
It'd like both him and
the money locked up again.

272
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,949
Oh...

273
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,685
Well, how long a term
would he receive?

274
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:30,188
They're saying ten years.

275
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,923
I know how you feel,
ma'am.

276
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,826
If you happen not to be
telling all you know,

277
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,327
I... wouldn't
blame you.

278
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,462
I think you better go.

279
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,730
What I'm trying
to say

280
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,065
is I'd much rather
be chasing Indians,

281
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,599
but since I have orders,
it's not...

282
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,934
ROBERTS:
Did you hear

283
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,536
what my granddaughter said,
Lieutenant?

284
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,437
Yes, sir.

285
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,671
And in the future,

286
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,207
please remember you
are not welcome here.

287
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,649
Is that the young fellow
who was here before?

288
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,017
Yes.

289
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,785
But I don't think
he'll come back again.

290
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:01,853
Couldn't be
he's the reason

291
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,154
Colonel Desmond
wouldn't come,

292
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,522
wouldn't admit
who he was?

293
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:05,557
SCAMPER:
Might be.

294
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,492
No, Gramp,
it couldn't be.

295
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:08,560
If he were
Tom's brother,

296
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,694
he'd have come
regardless.

297
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,262
I reckon
you're right.

298
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,265
I reckon I don't have to say
that I'm disappointed.

299
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,335
Seems every hope we've
cherished for a year

300
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,536
has been a mirage.

301
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:19,938
Fool's gold.

302
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:27,846
BALFOUR:
Joseph Senn.

303
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,914
Yes, sir, Joseph Senn!

304
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,717
Ah, mister,
I do like payday.

305
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,252
I guess
that's right.

306
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,053
Yes, sir,
just is.

307
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,554
Rainbow Saloon,
here I come!

308
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,589
(<i> all laugh</i> )

309
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,723
Save me a drink,
Joe!

310
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:39,991
William Barton.

311
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,460
That's me, and is this
a happy moment.

312
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,828
William Barton.

313
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,063
Nothing wrong
with that.

314
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,298
BASSETT:
Let me through here!

315
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,602
What do you want?

316
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,603
I want a word
with you.

317
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,737
I'm busy!

318
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,005
You weren't too busy
this morning

319
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,573
while you were smelting
my copper.

320
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,775
What do you mean?

321
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,176
Just what I'm saying.

322
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,245
While my boys was off hunting
and I was away,

323
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,480
some thieving scoundrel
carried my ore up here

324
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,548
and you smelted it
for him.

325
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,749
I want to know who.

326
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,417
I don't know anything
about your ore

327
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,418
or any other
Rebel's!

328
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,486
You're lying!

329
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,488
Either tell me who stole it
or pay for it--

330
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,489
I don't much care which.

331
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,490
Take it easy,
Bassett.

332
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,892
You keep out of this.

333
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,960
For once we're going to get
a square deal here!

334
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,464
Outside.

335
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,503
Get back,
all of you.

336
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,077
Keep moving!

337
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,513
I'm going, but
I ain't finished.

338
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,348
Watch that
door.

339
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,919
So you're telling me
to keep out of this,

340
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:41,920
huh, Bassett?

341
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,021
I certainly am.

342
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,122
Supposing
I don't?

343
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,657
We'll get someone
around here

344
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,458
who'll see
there's right.

345
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,694
Go ahead,
Ethan.

346
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:50,829
(<i> blows thudding</i> )

BAT:
Don't mark up
his face.

348
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,400
We want him pretty
for his folks.

349
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,874
Get him up and
out of there.

350
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,443
BALFOUR:
Travis!

351
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,881
You needn't have been
so brutal.

352
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,416
Why, Mr. Balfour,
you told me yourself

353
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,184
they're as dangerous
as wolves.

(<i> men cheering, firing guns</i> )

Whoopee!
Girls!

356
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,170
What is it?

00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,938

Ah, no, you don't!

00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,881
Hooray!

(<i> gunfire, cheering continue</i> )

361
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:56,961
Mr. Bixby.

362
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:57,962
That's me.

363
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:58,997
Ma Tarbet's
my name.

364
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,098
Welcome to
Coppertown.

365
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,165
I own this place.

366
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,567
Get your troupe in

367
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,569
and I'll show them where
they're going to roost.

368
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,571
Get back, boys,
get back.

369
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,573
The show goes on
tonight.

370
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,574
Hello.

371
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:11,676
Hello.

372
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:12,677
Hello.

373
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,678
I'm the professor.

374
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,913
I play the piano.

375
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,381
I'm going to play
for you tonight.

376

377

(<i> crowd laughs</i> )

378
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,753
I'll help him, sonny.

379
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,288
Watch it,
Professor.

380
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,258
Whoopee! I'm going to put
my brand on this one!

381
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,861
Whoa! No,
put me down!

That a boy, Lew!

385
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,434
Hold it, boys,
hold it!

386
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,435
Hold it!

387
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:41,005
Lew Partridge,
put that girl
down.

388
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,041
I said put that girl down.

389
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:45,076
PARTRIDGE:
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Lisa.

390
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,478
I... I never meant no harm.

391
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,313
That's better.

392
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,781
MAN:
Good for you, Lisa.

393
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:54,052
(<i> crowd merrily conversing</i> )

394
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,226
By golly,
he did come.

395
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,128
Who'd you say came?

396
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,897
Oh, nobody.

397
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,332
Nobody at all.

398
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,500
I... I was just talking
to myself, that's all.

399
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,505
He must've come here
to help us.

400
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,343
Oh, thunderation,
it's you again.

401
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,944
Or maybe it's
your cousin.

402
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,179
Oh, well,
here, here.

403
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,182
(<i> donkey neighing</i> )

404
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,516
I thought we had troubles before

405
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,051
but it's nothing
to what's coming.

406
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,753
The boys
will probably be riding horses

407
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,054
up and down the halls all night.

408
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,789
Why don't you put
two in a room?

409
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,124
Two in a room?

410
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,492
I'm putting five
in a room.

411
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,694
Come on, gals,
I'll show you the way.

412
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,829
That leaves us two men.

413
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,364
Yes, you and
Signor Martelli.

414
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,565
Johnny Carter,
ma'am.

415
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,034
I thought you had
an Italian tenor.

416
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,669
Well, unfortunately,
he disappeared.

417
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,371
It's the strangest thing
I ever saw.

418
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,139
With us one minute
and gone the next.

419
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,507
Yes, luckily for you,

420
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,876
I had a few free days
between engagements.

421
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,644
You do sing Italian,
of course.

422
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,880
Only in the bath, ma'am.

423
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:56,981
What is this?

424
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:59,217
Mr. Carter
is a trick-shot artist.

425
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,318
Trick-shot
artist?!

426
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,153
Why, the town
is full of them.

427
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,287
TRAVIS:
Yes, it is.

428
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,657
And so is
the cemetery.

429
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,527
I hear you've got quite
an extensive one in Coppertown.

430
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,229
Well, I guess he'll
have to do.

431
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:12,663
You'll share
the same room.

432
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:13,998
Thank you,
Miss Roselle.

433
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,634
You know, ma'am, I never thought
the day would come

434
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,070
when I'd regret not being
an Italian tenor.

435
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,916
Well, I'm saying
we should pull up stakes.

436
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,518
And I'm saying
you're a quitter.

437
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,653
Ain't we got the
right on our side?

438
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,155
That we have.

439
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,724
Yes, and Moss Balfour
has got the might.

440
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,725
If we stick
together

441
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,093
like we done
through the war,

442
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,728
ain't nobody
gonna whip us.

443
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,029
As soon as my boys
get back,

444
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,165
I'm aiming to square
accounts with Travis

445
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,166
and that other
deputy.

446
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,267
WOMAN:
Jeb Bassett,

447
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,102
you lay back like
the doctor said.

448
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,370
MAN:
Sorry,
Mrs. Bassett.

449
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:53,538
We'll move along,
Jeb,

450
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,306
and let you get
a little rest.

451
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,208
Now, Martha, I'm fine.

452
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,743
We just heard
about it, Dad.

453
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,211
You hurt bad?

454
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,447
I'll be up and around
in a couple of hours.

455
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:05,216
Then we can decide what to do.

456
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,785
Jeb, you ain't gonna
pull them into this.

457
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,621
What's a man have sons
for if not to help him?

458
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,489
He's right, Ma.

459
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,191
I suffered enough
from the war,

460
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,325
losing Carey
and Tom,

461
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,960
worrying and praying
for you

462
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,061
and the other boys.

463
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,763
I'm wore out
with suffering.

464
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,902
Why can't we leave
like the others,

465
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,571
go someplace where it's safe?

466
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:30,675
A man's got to do
what he thinks best, Mother.

467
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:40,651

Come in.

471
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,195
Mr. Roberts.

472
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,064
Yes, come in.

473
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,699
Come right in, please.

474
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,835
I was told you wanted
to see me.

475
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:58,903
My name is...

476
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,037
Why, of course.

477
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,539
I know who you are.

478
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,908
Can't escape a reputation
like yours, you know.

479
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,909
Well, thank you,
sir.

480
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:06,110
It is kind of
a showy act,

481
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,345
but people seem
to like it.

482
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,080
Well, sit down,
Colonel, sit down.

483
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:10,114
No colonel.

484
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,016
Just plain
Johnny Carter.

485
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,918
Oh, well,
sit down anyway.

486
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,419
Thank you.

487
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,256
And, uh, Mr. Carter,
with a reward out

488
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,291
for Colonel Desmond's arrest

489
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:24,362
and every Yankee soldier
in the country out to collect,

490
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,898
I can readily understand
the colonel's reluctance

491
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,232
to admit
to his identity.

492
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,067
Haven't seen one of these
for years.

493
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,702
A useful gun in its day,

494
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:35,473
but like its owner,
no longer much good in a fight.

495
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:38,643
Tell me about Lisa Roselle.

496
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,747
Oh, you know it's very odd

497
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,516
that you should be so curious
about Lisa Roselle.

498
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,118
She's a beautiful woman.

499
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,686
Oh, come, come, sir.

500
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,721
I'll wager at my age
you'd be equally curious.

501
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:54,058
I say it's odd
because this Lisa Roselle

502
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,293
is within
the framework

503
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,528
of all the wickedness
that threatens us.

504
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,564
There's a scoundrel
named Henderson

505
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:02,066
who proposes to run us
out of the country

506
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,501
and take over
our mines.

507
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:07,004
Operating for him here
is this Lisa Roselle

508
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,073
and her crew
of bullyboys--

509
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,542
Deputy Sheriff Travis
and his men.

510
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,778
What do you know
about her?

511
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,012
Very little,

512
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:18,449
except that she's
a New Orleans
adventuress,

513
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,284
clever
and unscrupulous.

514
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:21,319
Quite a woman.

515
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,486
And quite an idea.

516
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,790
Yeah, that's part
of our trouble.

517
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,359
Travis and the others
we can handle, maybe,

518
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:32,496
but how does one
fight a woman?

519
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,232
Women are difficult,
sir,

520
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,833
but not invulnerable.

521
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,034
Somewhere along
the line

522
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,269
there's always
a weak spot

523
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,470
in their
fortifications

524
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,706
and to find it requires
vast experience.

525
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,640
But having found it,

526
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,375
they'll fold up
like army tents.

527
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,777
You certainly seem
to know your business.

528
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,614
And I might add that
their final capitulation

529
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:53,117
is always fraught
with the most charming
possibilities.

530
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,419
But one question,
sir.

531
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,787
Why am I being haunted

532
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,024
by the ghost of this...
this Colonel Desmond?

533
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,559
It's the simple arithmetic

534
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,794
of violence and oppression,
Mr. Carter.

535
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,564
My men are being killed
in the mines,

536
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,899
shot to death taking ore
to Mesa City--

537
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,302
the only smelter
that'll handle it.

538
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:14,105
They're panicked,
ready to quit.

539
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,773
They need a man who'll put heart

540
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:16,974
and guts into them,

541
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:20,244
a man strong enough
to blast Travis
and his men.

542
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,046
They need a leader.

543
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,616
Mr. Carter, won't you help us?

544
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,817
<i>Me?</i>

545
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:30,087
A vaudeville performer,
a trick-shot artist?

546
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,522
What chance
would I have

547
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,224
with a box
of toy pistols

548
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:34,892
against Travis
and his guns?

549
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:37,194
Besides, I'm
a man of peace.

550
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,963
I abominate
violence.

551
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,098
I'm sorry, sir.

552
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,434
I wish I could have helped you.

553
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,802
Good night.

554
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,745
I thought I heard voices.

555
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,213
You did.

556
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,648
(<i> Carter whistling outside</i> )

557
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,420
(<i> horse and carriage</i>
<i>thumps away</i> )

558
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,622
Tom used to sing that.

559
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:07,658
He was singing it
the last time he rode away.

560
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,826
Was that Tom's brother?

561
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,761
Was it Colonel Desmond,
Grandpa?

562
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:11,796
Was it?

563
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:12,830
I don't know.

564
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,998
I don't know.

565
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,834
Well, did you warn him
about the Yankee lieutenant?

566
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,770
Why, no, I didn't.

567
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,623
Anything I can do,
ma'am?

568
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,526
Oh, I... I was looking
for Mr. Bixby.

569
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,730
Well, you'd hardly expect
to find him in there.

570
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,431
That, I suppose, is
meant to be amusing.

571
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,866
Oh, I'm a very
amusing fellow.

572
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,700
Oh.

573
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,068
Here,
let me show you.

574
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,270
Here you are.

575
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,473
Are you interested
in pistols?

576
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,474
Not in the least.

577
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,675
Well,
that's too bad.

578
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:00,111
We might've had
something in common.

579
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:01,545
You know,
personally, I think

580
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,748
there are
only three things
worth living for--

581
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,350
fine guns, good horses
and beautiful women.

582
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,285
At least that's one item
we have in common.

583
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,320
Would you be
kind enough

584
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:10,621
to let me
get out of here?

585
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,156
Well, the obvious
answer to that, ma'am,

586
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:13,290
is why did you come in?

587
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,292
I told you I came
to see Mr. Bixby.

588
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,360
Oh, yes, Mr. Bixby.

589
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:17,428
That's right.

590
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,829
Well, as an excuse,
ma'am,

591
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,998
that has a faint odorant
of fish.

592
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,266
You're impossible.

593
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:25,069
At least it entitles me
to a question.

594
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,971
Is this your
establishment?

595
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,208
Why do you ask?

596
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,044
Well, if it isn't, it's an awful
waste of something or other

597
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,013
for such an attractive woman
to be here.

598
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:39,917
Oh, well,
it is not my establishment.

599
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,986
Oh.

600
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,354
What are you doing here?

601
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:45,790
That is none of your business.

602
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,892
TRAVIS:
Well, now, maybe
it is, Lisa.

603
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,995
Maybe he's the fellow
we've been hearing about--

604
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,329
the Reb colonel.

605
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:53,731
I wouldn't try
any monkeyshines

606
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,399
with those cap pistols
of yours.

607
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,268
Wouldn't think
of it.

608
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,436
Besides,
I should tell you

609
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,737
that you've
been misinformed

610
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:00,838
about my military rank.

611
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,239
It's Corporal
Johnny Carter.

612
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,775
Corporal or colonel,
I got a piece of advice.

613
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,745
I wouldn't mix in things
that don't concern you.

614
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:08,612
Why not?

615
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,147
We don't like
troublemakers.

616
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,516
We got a nice
little community here,

617
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,285
chock-full of law and order,

618
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,320
and we aim
to keep it that way.

619
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,721
We?

620
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:19,857
Mr. Travis
is from the sheriff's office.

621
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,560
Oh, well, now, I'm all in favor
of law and order.

622
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:23,861
TRAVIS:
I'm glad to hear that,

623
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,162
because if you wasn't,

624
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,097
I might start remembering
I never did like

625
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,132
Rebs anyhow.

626
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,166
(<i> gun fires</i> )

627
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:31,969
Now we can talk
more sociable.

628
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,004
That was quite a shot,
Mr. Carter.

629
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,339
Yes, it was...

630
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:36,607
quite a shot.

631
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,008
It's my business--

632
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,646
eyes closed, mirrors,
upside down.

633
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,515
You take one
of these things,

634
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:47,251
liable to kill people--
that's no good.

635
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:48,385
Here, take it.

636
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:49,787
I never liked them

637
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:50,988
because when you
kill a man,

638
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,723
he dies just as bad
or just as stupid

639
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,525
as the moment you put
the bullet in him.

640
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:55,793
But if you let
him live,

641
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:57,528
he's still got a chance
to learn things.

642
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,863
Well, that's smart,

643
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:01,932
provided he learns
the right things.

644
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:05,469
Take what I just learned.

645
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,972
You're as full of tricks
as a tame crow,

646
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:09,907
but tricks don't mean much
in a showdown.

647
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,977
Face to face,
it's speed--

648
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:16,547
how quick you can throw out
pieces of lead like this.

649
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,015
Yeah,
that's a point.

650
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,450
Ma'am.

651
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:20,751
Yes.

652
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,553
I hope you'll honor
my performance

653
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:24,588
with your presence this evening.

654
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:29,793
I think I will.

655
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,030
How about you?

656
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,698
I'll be there.

657
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,871
MAN:
You reminded me
of the old lady.

658
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,507
All right,
all right.

659
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:46,610
Well, Mrs. Desmond, are
you here for the show?

660
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:47,778
No, I'm not.

661
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,046
If it's a church
benefit,

662
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,181
I've got tickets coming
out of my ears.

663
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:52,149
Oh, no, it isn't.

664
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,984
I came to see one
of the entertainers.

665
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,553
By the name of Carter,
I'll bet.

666
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,054
Why,
how did you know?

667
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,523
Oh, I had a husband once
looked something like him.

668
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,659
Drawed gals the way
molasses does flies.

669
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:02,860
He's in there
by the stage

670
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,328
getting ready
for his act.

671
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,396
Could I speak
to him?

672
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,463
Sure,
go right ahead.

673
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:07,565
Thank you.

676
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:16,941
Yes, ma'am.

677
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,542
Could I speak to you
for a moment?

678
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,344
Why, certainly.

679
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:21,545
I'm Mrs. Desmond...

680
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,014
Mrs. Thomas Desmond.

681
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,316
How do you do?

682
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:28,085
Well, perhaps the name
doesn't mean anything to you,

683
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,454
but if it does,
I... I just want to warn you.

684
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:31,722
There's trouble here--

a Union officer
looking for Colonel Desmond.

686
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,427
A Union officer?

687
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,695
Yes, sir.

688
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:39,496
Could that be the one
standing there?

689
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,498
Your bet.

690
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,800
Oh, dear,
I'd better go.

691
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:44,568
Oh, not on my account,
please.

692
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,337
No, really,
I'd better leave.

693
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,476

694

I'm going out.

A couple of

705
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,868
I'd count it a privilege,
Mrs. Desmond,

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,603
if you'd let me
escort you home.

707

Why, I appreciate
your kindness, Lieutenant...

to be seen with me,

would object to that.

Do you like my dress?

I don't know.

736

Why?

737
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:36,173
Kind of like
to find out

738
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,708
if he's up
to anything or not.

Why not wait

Well, I'll tell you,
not waiting

741

is the main reason
I'm around today.

Found out a lot
of things.

Take what the fellow said
about not killing people

746
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:50,954
so they can learn.

Is he?

The important thing
is to stay alive
so you can learn.

815
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,734
Suppose one of
those toy guns of yours

816
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,002
could sting
a man a little.

817
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,704
Oh, kill him
in the right place.

818
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:21,738
Think so?

819
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,073
I do.

820
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:24,908
Ma'am, you look as if
you'd just stepped

821
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,243
from a Mardi Gras
cotillion.

822
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,378
You've been
in New Orleans?

823
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,579
My favorite city.

824
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:30,580
I was there once.

825
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:31,682
Never liked it myself.

826
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,050
Well, perhaps
you didn't go

827
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,651
to the right places.

828
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:37,154
Do you remember those
wonderful restaurants,

829
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:38,922
charming people,
the Comus Ball?

830
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,791
How does a
vaudeville performer

831
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,392
happen to attend
a Comus Ball?

832
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,395
Oh, vaudeville
performers enjoy
such things, ma'am.

833
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,297
They enjoy good food,
pleasant surroundings,

834
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,333
dancing and...
beautiful ladies.

835
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,134
If that's
the case,

836
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,136
what are you
doing here?

837
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,838
Talking to
a beautiful lady.

838
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,239
Well, that I grant.

839
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,408
But if you can perform
in such fancy places,

840
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,576
why Coppertown?

841
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:00,844
As I told Miss Roselle,

842
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,446
I was persuaded to come.

843
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,114
A while ago,
I was talking to Bixby.

844
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:06,216
He was wondering how you
happened to be so handy

845
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,851
when his Italian singer
walked out.

846
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,687
Says it wasn't five minutes
later that you showed up.

847
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:11,922
BAT:
Travis?

848
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:13,490
Yeah?

849
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,361
They're comin',
just down the street.

850
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,597
Maybe we can talk
some more later.

851
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:25,569
Your friend
doesn't seem to like me.

852
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:26,903
No, he doesn't.

853
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,305
That's odd.

854
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:29,806
But then,
you're odd, too.

855
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:32,843
You wondered how I
happened to attend
a Comus Ball.

856
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,644
I might ask you
the same thing.

857
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,049
I never have.

858
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:47,324
(<i> piano playing as men talk</i> )

859
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,201
(<i> inaudible</i> )

860
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:01,872
Travis...

861
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,540
Keep away from me.

862
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,509
Is there going to be
any trouble?

863
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:08,078
You heard what I said--
keep away from me.

864
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:18,055
We'd better
stay out of this.

865
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:20,123
Come on.

866
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,293
Now's the time to make
your play, Colonel,

867
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,062
with that fancy
shootin' of yours...

868
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:26,430
while they
ain't expectin' it.

869
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,731
My gun's
right by your hand.

870
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,000
No, I don't hold
with violence, Sergeant.

871
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:32,769
I reckon I got
the wrong man.

872
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:42,212
Where's Travis?

873
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:46,283
(<i> piano music fades and stops</i> )

874
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:48,185
Right over here, Bassett.

875
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:59,262
I come
to give you warnin', Travis.

876
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,298
Do you hear me?

877
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,999
I've come to give you warnin'.

878
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,468
Go ahead.

879
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,303
If you ain't
out of town by sunup,

880
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,839
I aim to hunt you down
and shoot you with this...

881
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:11,441
(<i> shots ring out</i>
<i>as women scream</i> )

882
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,892
Professor, play some music,
and play it loud and fast.

883
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:29,826
Calm down.

884
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,902
(<i> playing fast melody</i> )

885
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:39,903
Lisa.

886
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,306
You saw what happened--
strictly self-defense.

887
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:46,710
I saw three men
shot in the back.

888
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,546
She's right.

889
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:50,580
Like as not

890
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,315
the governor'll
send someone down here

891
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,517
to investigate.

892
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,685
Then where'll
you and Lisa be

893
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,420
with your copper mines?

894
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,594
ROBERTS:
I wish I could
change your mind.

895
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,463
But what have I
to stay for now?

896
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:08,298
They're all gone,

897
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,400
all of them except
the youngest here.

898
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,935
I'm takin' him
back home,

899
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:13,270
where he'll
have a chance

900
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,372
to learn how people
can live together

901
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:17,007
without killin'
each other.

902
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,475
But Mrs. Bassett,
I've got a plan

903
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:20,443
for getting the ore
through to Mesa City.

904
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,913
Now, if you and the others
will only wait a few days.

905
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:26,249
We've waited too long
already, Mr. Roberts.

906
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:27,484
Good-bye.

907
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,885
Good-bye,
Mrs. Bassett.

908
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,086
Good-bye, Rufe.

909
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:31,188
Good-bye.

910
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,290
LIEUTENANT:
Sergeant, take charge.

911
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,658
All right, son.

912
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:38,728
I'm, uh...
I'm deeply obliged

913
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,897
to you, Lieutenant,
for giving them escort.

914
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,333
Well, I'm glad to be
of some assistance, sir.

915
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:44,334
Good day, ma'am.

916
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:45,735
Good day,
Lieutenant,

917
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:46,736
and thank you.

918
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:48,171
Unless my plan works,

919
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:51,141
the others are going
to be leaving, too.

920
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:53,610
Scamper, I want you
to get to town.

921
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,812
Take a message to Mr. Carter.

922
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:56,613
I'll get it there

923
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:58,248
just as fast
as I can, sir.

924
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,918
ROBERTS:
You see, it's less than 30 miles
to Mesa City.

925
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,956
Not much of a haul, provided
nobody tries to stop the ore.

926
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,625
I was going to have the men
start at daybreak.

927
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,360
By nightfall they'd be there.

928
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:13,363
Then as soon as it was dark,
they were to double back

929
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,632
and cut off
onto the Old Red Creek Trail.

930
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:18,001
Yes, but look, Red Creek Trail
runs mostly in a canyon.

931
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,736
There's a dozen places
for an ambush.

932
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,205
A scout could bring the men
over from the main road

933
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,974
in plenty of time
to catch the wagons.

934
00:37:23,976 --> 00:37:24,975
What would you do?

935
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:25,976
I'd go the regular way.

936
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:27,510
Look at the terrain--

937
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,980
there's only one place
for an attack, right here.

938
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:31,281
ROBERTS:
But an attack is what

939
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,649
we're trying to avoid.

940
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,351
Sure, but if one comes,
you'll be fighting it

941
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:35,619
on ground of your
own choosing.

942
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:36,686
Still,
leaving at daybreak

943
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:37,887
would get them there
after dark

944
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,689
and that's no time
to be ambushed.

945
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,124
Well, let everyone think
you're leaving at daybreak,

946
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:42,292
then leave at midnight.

947
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:44,327
Might even get through
without a fight.

948
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,496
If we follow your plan,
Mr. Carter,

949
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,498
will you consent
to come along?

950
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,434
Well, I... I'll
be wishing you success.

951
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,669
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

952
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:54,738
I've got to get
back to the Rainbow.

953
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,240
You're leaving us now?

954
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,309
Yes, I have
some work to do.

955
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,945
He's got some work to do.

956
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,179
Good-bye
and good luck.

957
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,848
It was a mistake
asking him here.

958
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,951
NEWTON:
His plan doesn't sound so bad,
but after all...

959
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:08,952
By golly,
I got it.

960
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,253
What?

961
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:11,488
Know how
Colonel Desmond won

962
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,789
the Battle
of Maple Ridge?
No.

963
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,658
Let it be known
he'd attack at daybreak

964
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,159
and then hit 'em
at midnight.

965
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:17,861
The same thing.

966
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,729
Just about time.

967
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:29,072
Well, hello, Travis.

968
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,774
Hello.

969
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:33,910
It couldn't be the 31st
of February, could it?

970
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:37,314
Do you think
it ever will be?

971
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,381
What do you think?

972
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:40,050
I'll tell
you what I think:

973
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:41,318
She's no good for you.

974
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,286
You two don't
belong together.

975
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:45,155
You're different...

976
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,956
like whiskey
and champagne.

977
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,391
I'll be seeing you.

978
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,961
Cora... any day
of the month

979
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,596
is all right
with me.

980
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:10,714
Still set
for midnight?

981
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,115
Yeah.

982
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:14,617
They're still figurin'
on him goin' along.

983
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,052
All right, get going.

984
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:21,925
Do you want your dress
now, Miss Lisa?

985
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,927
Yes, please.

986
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,029
TRAVIS:
Lisa?

987
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,631
I thought I told you
not to come up here.

988
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,401
Just wanted to talk to you
about your elegant friend.

989
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:33,169
Seems he's got
the Rebs convinced

990
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,637
he's Colonel Desmond.

991
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,477
What do you mean?

992
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,178
He's taking charge
of their ore train.

993
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,279
Changed their plans

994
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:44,614
so they're leaving
at midnight,

995
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,249
and told them
he'd ride with them.

996
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,384
Where'd you find
that out?

997
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,451
Oh, I got
friends around.

998
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:49,652
Thought
you'd be interested

999
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,287
in how he pulled
the wool over your eyes.

1000
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,789
But don't worry...

1001
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:54,824
I'm meeting them
with a dozen men
instead of three.

1002
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,427
This is supposed to be
a business, not a war.

1003
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:00,497
Mr. Henderson's orders were
only to watch and to report.

1004
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,932
And make sure the Rebs
don't get prosperous.

1005
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,033
Yes, but in a legal way.

1006
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,403
Nothing was said
about using violence.

1007
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:07,937
Now, Lisa...

1008
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:10,407
All we're going to do
is scare 'em a little...

1009
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,508
them and your friend.

1010
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,609
What about him?

1011
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:14,077
The Rebs might make
a fight of it

1012
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,078
if he's along.

1013
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,279
Wouldn't do...

1014
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:17,547
not when they're
on their last legs.

1015
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,682
Best thing
is to convince
him not to go.

1016
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,317
It's going
to be interesting

1017
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:23,653
to see how he acts
when the chips are down.

1018
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,789
Heard tell he was
a regular fire-eater.

1019
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,290
What are you
going to do?

1020
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:28,892
Depends on
what he does.

1021
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:30,860
How come
you're so worried?

1022
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:34,063
Couldn't be you're
soft on him,
could it?

1023
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,932
No, I'm not soft on him.

1024
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,202
Well, that's good, because
I wouldn't like to think

1025
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:42,572
of your grieving over him...
case he gets hurt.

1026
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:47,110
(<i> fast music playing</i> )

(<i> cheering</i> )

1032
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,546
Evening, Sheriff.

1033
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:24,647
Seems like you
enjoyed the show.

1034
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,849
Oh, that I did.

1035
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:27,450
And I enjoyed your
act, too, Mr. Carter.

1036
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:28,685
You know everybody's
talking about

1037
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:29,686
how wonderful you are.

1038
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:30,687
Thank you, Sheriff.

1039
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:31,688
You know,
I heard something

1040
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,922
about you today, too,

1041
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,290
but, of course,
I didn't believe it.

1042
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,291
Huh?

1043
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,559
What did you hear?

1044
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,061
Well, I heard that you had
absolutely no say

1045
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:39,829
in appointing
those deputies of yours,

1046
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,398
that Travis and the others
just walked into your office

1047
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,867
and pinned the stars
on themselves.

1048
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,034
Wasn't
that way at all.

1049
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:47,070
I got well paid
for takin' em on.

1050
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:51,808
Well, I guess
certain people

1051
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,109
got a lot
of money to spend.

1052
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,410
Yes, they have.

1053
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:57,947
Guess they got a right
to spend it any way they...

1054
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,316
Say... why are you
so interested?

1055
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,851
Oh, just
idle conversation.

1056
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:02,852
Yeah?

1057
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:03,653
Hello, Lisa.

1058
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:04,854
Want to play?

1059
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:05,655
No cheating?

1060
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07,123
All right.

1061
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,429
Ma'am, you're as lustrous
as Cinderella tonight,

1062
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:16,032
but unlike her, you<i> appear</i>
at the stroke of 12:00.

1063
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,667
I hope I don't
disappoint you.

1064
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:19,202
On the contrary.

1065
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,538
You're mighty glib with those
pretty speeches of yours.

1066
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,472
Where'd you get 'em?

1067
00:42:22,474 --> 00:42:23,339
Oh, make 'em up.

1068
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:24,707
That's interesting,

1069
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,442
because I've kinda taken
a dislike to 'em.

1070
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:27,644
Many people have.

1071
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:28,778
And to you, too.

1072
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,013
That's not impossible.

1073
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,315
Don't provoke easy, do you?

1074
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:34,217
No.

1075
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,085
Maybe this'll do it.

1076
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,660
Can I borrow your
handkerchief, Sheriff?

1077
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,366
Thank you.

1078
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:51,935
Now, if you people
will excuse me,

1079
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:54,103
I have several things
to take care of.

1080
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:55,772
Good night.

1081
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:00,843
I gave him his chance.

1082
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:02,512
What are you
going to do

1083
00:43:02,514 --> 00:43:04,147
with somebody
like that?

1084
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:05,815
I think I know.

1085
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,954
You think
this'll hold him?

1086
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:14,557
Yes... with a little help
from me.

1087
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,359
I don't like
this idea of yours,

1088
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:17,927
but I guess it'll do.

1089
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,796
The ore train
starts at midnight.

1090
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:22,065
We'll have to leave
by 3:00 at the latest

1091
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:23,700
if we're gonna
head 'em off.

1092
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:25,401
How'll I know
if he's here?

1093
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:27,170
I'll signal
from the window.

1094
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:28,204
At 3:00.

1095
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:29,439
At 3:00.

1096
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:32,809
Don't forget--
this is business,
not pleasure.

1097
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:35,144
I won't forget.

1098
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,382
Ten past 12:00.

1099
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:40,483
We'd better be startin'.

1100
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,051
But Carter
ain't here yet.

1101
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,454
Likely he's plannin'
to join us along the way.

1102
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:46,322
Give 'em the word, Zack.

1103
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:49,092
Let's get in the wagons.

1104
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:53,162
Hey, Bill, do me
a favor, will you?

1105
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,530
What is it?

1106
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:55,965
Take this critter
to Mesa City

1107
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,467
and find somebody
to have him

1108
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,668
for five dollars.

1109
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,236
Who'll pay five dollars
for that?

1110
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:01,170
Who said "pay"?

1111
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:02,505
The five's
for takin' him!

1112
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:03,873
That's a lot of money.

1113
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,608
Not alongside of
the baccy I'd save!

1114
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,143
All right,
I'll take him.

1115
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,345
MAN:
Head on!

1116
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:12,982
(<i> donkey braying</i> )

1117
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:18,354
More of that
champagne stuff.

1118
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:19,789
They must be washing in it!

1119
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,257
Nothing wrong
with that.

1120
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:28,097
(<i> knock at door</i> )

1121
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:28,998
Come in.

1122
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,500
Well,
look who's back,

1123
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,335
my friend,
the champagne man!

1124
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:33,703
Put it right down here.

1125
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:36,105
And accept this
with my compliments.

1126
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:36,906
Thank you.

1127
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:37,974
You want
any more, Lisa?

1128
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:39,509
This will be enough,
thank you.

1129
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,110
There is never enough!

1130
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,513
As the poet Horace said,
"From Sabine jars

1131
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:45,048
bring forth
the sparkling wine."

1132
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,616
But we have
no Sabine jars.

1133
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:48,584
No matter,
no matter at all.

1134
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,653
Ma'am,
it's very interesting,

1135
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:53,589
the things you told me
about New Orleans.

1136
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:54,824
I guess
it must have been

1137
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:56,492
pretty bad there
after the war.

1138
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:57,860
It was.

1139
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,830
I bet you could've married
a rich carpetbagger.

1140
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:04,400
Maybe, or maybe
I could have become
a seamstress.

1141
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:06,202
But I preferred
coming west.

1142
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,738
I really wanted to go
to San Francisco.

1143
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,440
Oh, why?

1144
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:12,341
I was told about
a building there

1145
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:16,546
that could have been
made into a theater
for plays, or even opera,

1146
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:19,082
but that required $20,000.

1147
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:22,385
Well, I'd hardly
think Coppertown
would be the place

1148
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,020
to get that
kind of money.

1149
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:28,224
You know, I've been telling
you my life history,

1150
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,226
and you haven't said
a thing about yourself.

1151
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,528
Oh, it's a very
dull subject, ma'am.

1152
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,697
The history of
a trick-shot artist?

1153
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,365
It's filled
with such things

1154
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:39,402
as gunpowder, bullets,
trajectory, recoil.

1155
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:48,444
I'm sure we can think
of something livelier.

1156
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:53,850
For instance?

1157
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:56,519
Well, I could tell you,
and in great sincerity,

1158
00:45:56,521 --> 00:46:00,423
that you're one of
the two most beautiful
women I've ever met.

1159
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:01,657
Who is the other?

1160
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:04,560
Ah-ah, that's not
a sporting question.

1161
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:05,928
Why not?

1162
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,230
Well, one of these times

1163
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:09,499
I'm going to meet
another beautiful woman

1164
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,134
and I'm going
to say to her,

1165
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:14,637
"I think that you're one
of the three most
beautiful women

1166
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:16,038
I've ever met."

1167
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,875
And she'll say to me,
"Who were the other two?"

1168
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:20,810
And how would you like it
if I said,

1169
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,311
"Oh, Miss What's-Her-Name

1170
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:25,381
and an angel out of heaven
named Lisa Roselle."

1171

(<i> chuckles</i> )

1172
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,151
There's nothing wrong
in saying that.

1173
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:30,453
Ah, well, it isn't
what I say,

1174
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,155
it's the way I say it.

1175
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:36,859
Am I still being dull?

1176
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:39,462
Mmm... amateurish,
I'd say.

1177
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:40,797
Mmm.

1178
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:46,402
Still amateurish?

1179
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,371
Well...

My... my maid is

Well, send her away.

1186
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:13,262
Yes.

1187
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:16,866
I'll have another
little pick-me-up.

1188
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,917
I think it would be nice...

No, I want them
further along.

Cuttin' them in half
is the only way
we can beat them.

(<i> horse whinnies</i> )

Wonder what happened.

1204
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:37,066
Somebody got behind them

1205

His horse is tiring.

We'll follow him
down the canyon.

1212
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:07,016
So he was smart enough
to stake out another horse.

1213
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,817
But I got a good idea who he is.

Let's get back to town.

Mrs. Desmond,
Lieutenant Ord.

Good morning.

Good morning.

00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,325
Nice day for shopping,
isn't it?

1219

Yes, isn't it?

Why, he didn't go.

That's very strange.

1222
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:55,998
I heard the rumors, too.

1223
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,701
Heard he was leading
the ore train as
Colonel Desmond.

1224
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:01,403
Well, he doesn't act
like Colonel Desmond.

1225
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:15,484
Hello.

1226
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:17,353
This is an unexpected
pleasure, ma'am.

1227
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:20,055
Hardly expected you
to be up before noon.

1228
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:21,290
Where have you been?

1229
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,458
Oh, out strolling.

1230
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,626
It's nice out.

1231
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:25,961
I mean last night,
after you left me.

1232
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:26,895
Why, in bed, ma'am.

00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:27,830
Where else?

1234
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:30,199
I told you champagne

1235
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:31,200
You're lying.

1236
00:54:31,202 --> 00:54:32,301
I was in here.

1237
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:34,503
I was in here
a dozen times!

1238

Oh.

1239
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:37,439
Too bad I missed you.

1240
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:39,908
Should have told you,
though--

You met up with that

Didn't you?

Ah-ah, temper, temper.

1245

to get lines under

Johnny, it's no good
for you here,

00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:07,069
no good at all.

1251

The hours I've been waiting,
knowing where you've gone!

1252
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,641
They're too much
for you, too many.

1253
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,877
You saw what
they did to Bassett--

1254
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:16,145
shot him in the back.

1255
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:18,013
And they'll do
the same to you.

If it isn't Travis,
it'll be some Yankee soldier.

for a thousand-dollar reward.

See, Johnny,
I know who you are.

00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:33,295
I must go.

1262
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:34,563
So that's it?

1263
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:38,567
It took you long enough
to make the point,

1264
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:40,736
but you finally got there.

1265
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:42,671
And believe me, it was
quite an oration.

1266
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:45,407
For a while there,
you had me on your side.

1267
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:50,012
Johnny, it isn't what
you're thinking at all.

1268
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,513
It's just that I...

1269
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:54,917
You don't trust me!

1270
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:58,153
You think it's
a trick to get you
away, don't you?

1271
00:55:58,155 --> 00:55:59,888
Johnny, you've
got to leave!

1272
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:00,923
Or otherwise?

1273
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:05,160
Guess we finally
caught up, Carter.

1274
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:06,695
Stand away
from him, Lisa.

1275
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:17,005
What'd you do
with your rifle?

1276
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:17,806
Rifle?

1277
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:19,341
Don't happen
to have one.

1278
00:56:19,343 --> 00:56:20,576
You did
this morning.

1279
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:22,344
You'd better break
down and admit it.

1280
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:24,346
I'd be glad to, if I had
anything to admit.

1281
00:56:24,348 --> 00:56:25,347
How about it, Lisa?

1282
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:27,249
When did
he come in?

1283
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:28,584
When did
he come in?!

1284
00:56:28,586 --> 00:56:30,986
He hasn't left
the hotel all night.

Yes, he just
got here

1290
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:45,401
and he'll be wanting
to talk to you, too.

1291
00:56:47,705 --> 00:56:49,571
Don't you worry,
Mr. Carter...

1292
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,907
I'm going to get
around to you yet.

1293
00:56:57,782 --> 00:57:00,382
Thanks for what
you did for me.

1294
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:02,618
But it doesn't
make sense...

1295
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,153
any sense at all.

1296
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,327
We leased this hotel and saloon,
put you in charge,

1297
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:15,130
and engaged Mr. Travis
and his men to assist you,

1298
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,765
all at considerable
expense.

1299
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,001
We did this
to secure the mines.

1300
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:20,769
I know, Mr. Henderson.

1301
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,337
Now we learn
a consignment of ore

1302
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:23,705
has slipped through
to Mesa City,

1303
00:57:23,707 --> 00:57:24,773
and that there's dissension

1304
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,375
between you
and Mr. Travis.

1305
00:57:26,377 --> 00:57:30,179
There is dissension, because
I object to the use of violence!

1306
00:57:30,181 --> 00:57:32,848
Well, one could hardly refer
to the actions

1307
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,451
of the constituted authorities
as violence.

1308
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:37,119
I can and I do,

1309
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:40,622
and so will the governor if
I'm forced to appeal to him.

1310
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:43,358
Appeal to the governor!

1311
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,726
Come, come, Miss Roselle,

1312
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:46,428
isn't that rather
a dangerous thing to do?

1313
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,096
Surely you must realize

1314
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:51,834
that for whatever has happened
here-- for whatever violence--

1315
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:54,002
you are equally responsible
with us.

1316
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:55,270
And another thing--

1317
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:58,273
by the terms
of our agreement,
it was specifically...

1318
00:57:58,275 --> 00:57:59,942
I remember perfectly.

1319
00:57:59,944 --> 00:58:03,645
It was specifically agreed
that whatever was to be done

1320
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,582
was to be done peacefully,
without violence...

1321
00:58:06,584 --> 00:58:08,083
without bloodshed!

1322
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:10,886
You haven't kept your promise,
Mr. Henderson.

1323
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:13,555
Wait a moment.

1324
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:16,692
Doesn't it seem
a pity, with your job
so nearly finished,

1325
00:58:16,694 --> 00:58:19,294
that you should
sacrifice the money
we guaranteed you?

1326
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:22,531
After all, you know,
you still have
your obligations.

1327
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:24,600
It seems I haven't
made myself clear.

1328
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:25,868
I'll put it this way.

1329
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,403
You have failed to live up
to your promises.

1330
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:30,539
From now on, I feel
perfectly justified

1331
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:32,207
if I fail to live up
to mine.

1332
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:36,612
Don't give her a thought.

1333
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:38,013
You know how women are.

1334
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,948
There isn't much more
Lisa could do anyways.

1335
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,617
Time has come for me
to take over.

1336
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:42,951
Leave it to me
and by tomorrow,

1337
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:45,020
we'll have these Rebs
on the run.

1338
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,022
Look, here's how
it's going to be--

1339
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,690
tonight's big doin's--
a dance.

00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,058
The whole town
will be there.

1341
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,027
Well, it's going
to be this easy.

01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:03,945
Oh, that's why Miss Roselle
couldn't find you.

1446
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,480
She's been up here
several times.

1447
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:07,048
She has?

1448
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,450
Oh!

1449
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,852
Now, there's a gal that's
as smooth as a wet eel,

1450
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:12,320
but a lot easier to look at.

1451
01:03:13,757 --> 01:03:16,057
Looks like we got
here just in time.

1452
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:17,826
Didn't think
we'd move so
quick, did you?

1453
01:03:17,828 --> 01:03:18,960
What are you
talkin' about?

1454
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,395
See if you
can find
the money.

1455
01:03:20,397 --> 01:03:21,396
Just a second!

1456
01:03:21,398 --> 01:03:22,397
Take it easy,
Carter.

1457
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:23,899
Guess I'll
have to.

1458
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:25,767
Hello, Lisa.

1459
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:27,302
What's going on?

1460
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,137
Suppose you tell me!

1461
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:31,206
Johnny Carter's
in real trouble.

1462
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:34,176
He took money from
the Southerners-- $1,600.

1463
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:35,710
I don't believe it!

1464
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:36,778
SHERIFF:
It's true.

1465
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,013
We got a witness!

1466
01:03:38,015 --> 01:03:39,247
I got a good look
at him

1467
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:41,016
just before
he knocked me out.

1468
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:43,518
Here's the money, Travis.

1469
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,187
Found it in his gun case.

1470
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:47,856
Well, that kind of
clinches it, Lisa.

1471
01:03:47,858 --> 01:03:50,258
Looks like Miss Roselle's
at a loss for words,

1472
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,060
although up to now,
I must admit

1473
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:54,229
she's given
a wonderful performance.

1474
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:59,367
Well, Johnny, I guess you
better pack your things

1475
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:00,435
and come off to jail.

1476
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:02,170
You'll like it,
it's real peaceful.

1477
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:06,942
It's easy enough.

1478
01:04:06,944 --> 01:04:08,710
I can ride to the fort,
secure a federal warrant

1479
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:10,145
and have you out of here
before dark,

1480
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:11,713
if you'll just admit
you're Colonel Desmond.

1481
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:13,615
I don't see
the percentage in
that, Lieutenant.

1482
01:04:13,617 --> 01:04:15,116
Well, it's better
than being killed.

1483
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:16,084
In here?

1484
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:17,285
You wouldn't be
the first prisoner

1485
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:18,920
that's been shot
trying to escape.

1486
01:04:18,922 --> 01:04:20,822
CAROLINE:
Can't you just say
you're Tom's brother,

1487
01:04:20,824 --> 01:04:21,823
even if you're not?

1488
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:23,291
No, afraid I can't.

1489
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:24,993
Besides, I'd kind of like
to see that $1,600

1490
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:26,328
get back to its original owners.

1491
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:28,263
It's odd a man
would worry about that

1492
01:04:28,265 --> 01:04:29,965
and not worry
about the $20,000

1493
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:31,633
that was taken
from a federal safe.

1494
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:34,102
Well, it might be that
the man who took the 20,000

1495
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:36,171
was just getting back
what was taken from him

1496
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:37,372
when he was captured.

1497
01:04:38,675 --> 01:04:40,308
That could be.

1498
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:43,144
As far as our money
goes, Mr. Carter,
you can't touch it.

1499
01:04:43,146 --> 01:04:44,512
Travis has
impounded it--

1500
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:47,315
says it might be a year
before it's released,

1501
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:49,150
and even tomorrow
would be too late.

1502
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:51,019
Everybody's packing,
getting ready

1503
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:53,388
to leave this afternoon,
even Grandfather.

1504
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,991
Does Balfour know
you're leaving?

1505
01:04:55,993 --> 01:04:57,759
CAROLINE:
I don't know.

1506
01:04:57,761 --> 01:04:59,027
Will you do something for me?

1507
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:00,595
Have him come down here
and see me.

1508
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:01,830
I can try.

1509
01:05:01,832 --> 01:05:03,598
I believe I can
persuade him, Mr. Carter.

1510
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,699
Will you do it
right away?

1511
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:05,901
Yes, sir.

1512
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:11,139
I'd like to escort
you home, ma'am,

1513
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:12,274
but you understand,

1514
01:05:12,276 --> 01:05:13,708
I'd best ride up
to the smelter.

1515
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,176
If you could help
in any way,

1516
01:05:15,178 --> 01:05:16,678
I... I'd be
eternally grateful.

1517
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,014
That's what
I'm counting on, ma'am.

1518
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:26,621
(<i> hoofbeats receding</i> )

1519
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:33,295
I'm not quitting,
now or later.

1520
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:35,597
The stake's too big
and I'm in too deep.

1521
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,865
And so are you, Lisa.

1522
01:05:36,867 --> 01:05:38,433
Whether you like it
or not,

1523
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,502
we're in this
thing together.

1524
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,840
And I've got an idea
you're going to like it,

1525
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:47,108
once Carter's
taken care of.

1526
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,377
You're not doing
anything more to him.

1527
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:50,412
No?

1528
01:05:50,414 --> 01:05:52,047
Remember what
I told you once

1529
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:54,849
about never having
to dodge bullets
from a dead man?

1530
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:56,918
Well, that still goes.

1531
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,787
We'll see.

1532
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:00,155
It's no use
going to Henderson.

1533
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:01,957
As of last night,
I'm in charge here,

1534
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:03,658
and if I have to prove it,
I will.

1535
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,794
(<i> knock on door</i> )

1536
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:07,462
Who's that?

1537
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,463
It's me.

1538
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:09,497
What do you want?

1539
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:11,132
The Desmond girl
and her lieutenant's

1540
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:12,567
been talkin' to Carter.

1541
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:14,569
Yeah?

1542
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:17,405
Now the lieutenant's
on the way to Balfour.

1543
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:18,873
Have Bart round up the boys,

1544
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:21,543
then you and I'll ride up
to the smelter...

1545
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:23,278
just in case.

1546
01:06:25,415 --> 01:06:28,283
Don't get in my way,
Lisa.

1547
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:32,787
It says it plain
in the Book, Mr. Carter.

1548
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:35,457
It says, "I will take
all the families
of the North

1549
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:37,125
"and bring them
against this land

1550
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:38,560
and the inhabitants
thereof."

1551
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:40,895
It said that about two<i> nations,</i>
<i>Mr. Balfour.</i>

1552
01:06:40,897 --> 01:06:42,831
Now, these people
are no different

1553
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:44,265
than the people of the North.

1554
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:46,201
They worship
the same God,
read the same Bible.

1555
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:47,635
They killed my son.

1556
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:50,638
But they lost sons, too,
and husbands and brothers.

1557
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,075
Oh, I know you feel unhappy
about the Bassetts being killed,

1558
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:57,445
but I'm sure that in some way
you must feel responsible.

1559
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,881
How could not buying their ore
make me responsible?

1560
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:02,083
But if you'd buy,
there'd be no more trouble.

1561
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:05,387
I swore I'd never
deal with them.

1562
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:08,023
Suppose I quote
a little, too...

1563
01:07:08,025 --> 01:07:11,793
from a man on your side--
Mr. Lincoln:

1564
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:15,330
"Let us strive to bind up
the nation's wounds,

1565
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:17,365
"to do all
which may achieve

1566
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:20,402
"a just and lasting peace
among ourselves,

1567
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:24,239
with malice towards none,
with charity for all."

1568
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,556
What are you doing here?

1569
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:42,757
Visiting.

1570
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:44,592
Get out...

1571
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:45,960
both of you!

1572
01:07:45,962 --> 01:07:48,329
Who's going to protect
you from the Rebs
if we get out?

1573
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:49,597
I won't need
any protection.

1574
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:52,033
From now on, I'm going
to buy from them

1575
01:07:52,035 --> 01:07:53,835
just the same
as anybody else!

1576
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:55,170
Don't think so, Balfour,

1577
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:57,505
on account we've
closed the smelter.

1578
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:58,773
On what grounds?

1579
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:00,341
We'll think of some.

1580
01:08:00,343 --> 01:08:03,578
I'm beginning to see
how blind I've been.

1581
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,647
I'll appeal to
the governor, Mr. Travis,

1582
01:08:05,649 --> 01:08:09,150
and in the meantime,
I'll offer the Southerners
financial aid!

1583
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:16,091
(<i> gunshot</i> )

1584
01:08:39,049 --> 01:08:40,081
Johnny.

1585
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,316
Johnny!

1586
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,086
What are you doing here?

1587
01:08:45,088 --> 01:08:46,454
Open the door.

1588
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:53,361
You've got to leave.

1589
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:54,796
But I hadn't thought
of leaving.

1590
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:55,897
You've got to!

1591
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:57,031
You've got to get
out of town!

1592
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:58,099
Get out of town?

1593
01:08:58,101 --> 01:08:59,300
Let's not go
into that again.

1594
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:00,568
It's gettin' monotonous.

1595
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:01,369
Listen to me.

1596
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:03,638
This is your last chance!

1597
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,108
Your interest in me,
ma'am, is positively
touching.

1598
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,643
How stubborn can you be?

1599
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,678
Tonight they are planning

I'll stay here.

1602

01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,226
Trouble!

1606
01:09:25,228 --> 01:09:26,861
Balfour's dead--
shot in the back
by Travis.

1607
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:29,330
And now they're
buying up our claims
at ten dollars apiece.

1608
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:30,798
Where are they doin' that?

1609
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,934
At the Rainbow--
Travis and some
fellow from Denver.

1610
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:34,002
Meet me around in front.

1611
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:35,203
Yes, sir.

1612
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:39,574
I guess I'll have
to reconsider that
escape, ma'am.

in the saddle bag.

1616

Head for California.

1617

Yes, sir.

1621
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:57,158
The night the Bassetts
were killed,

1622
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,159
you offered me your gun.

1623
01:09:58,161 --> 01:09:59,594
I'll take it now.

1624

That's what I've been
waitin' to hear!

1625

Oh, no, Johnny,

1626

What can I say?

1627
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:07,735
What can I do to make
you believe me?

1628

Look at me!

1629

Can't you trust me?

1630
01:10:10,974 --> 01:10:12,373
Frankly, no.

1633

Sorry to spoil your fun,

1637
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:47,041
What do you mean?

1638
01:10:47,043 --> 01:10:48,576
Stay where you are,
Sheriff.

1639
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:50,278
I mean the sale
has been called off.

1640
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,779
Well, you're
a little late, Carter.

1641
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:54,282
Yes, I already have more
than two-thirds of the claims.

1642
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:55,316
Not anymore!

1643

I don't know who you are,

1644
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:58,886
but I'm quite sure you'll regret
this... this illegality!

1645
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:00,955
There's nothing
illegal about
changing your mind.

1646
01:11:00,957 --> 01:11:02,490
Well, that's debatable,
and I doubt

1647
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:04,025
if these people
have changed their minds.

1648
01:11:04,027 --> 01:11:06,060
They know it will be months,
perhaps years,

1649
01:11:06,062 --> 01:11:07,262
before they can sell their ore.

1650
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:08,296
Oh, why?

1651
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:09,731
The smelter's been closed,

1652
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:11,766
pending investigation
of Mr. Balfour's death.

1653
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,502
TRAVIS:
Well, look who broke out
of the jailhouse.

1654
01:11:14,504 --> 01:11:16,804
Carryin' a gun, too.

1655
01:11:21,845 --> 01:11:24,579
Hear you've been using
yours today, Travis.

1656
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,117
Must be a specialty
of yours...

in the back.

1658
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:34,856
So I'm going to give you
a chance at mine.

1659
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:37,725
Joe, give me a beer.

1660
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,793
JOE:
Coming up.

1661
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:55,109
What are you going to do now,
Carter?

1662
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:56,744
No more tricks, huh?

1663
01:11:56,746 --> 01:12:00,248
That's good, because I'm going
to call your play.

Come on,

Now get against the wall.

1669
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:08,850
You see Travis?

1670
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:10,418
He just passed me
at a gallop.

1671
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,552
He's probably
gone to the smelter.

1672

Yeah, that's where
his gang is.

1673
01:13:13,022 --> 01:13:14,756
Well, looks like a job
for Roberts' Raiders.

1674
01:13:14,758 --> 01:13:16,090
There's a
pack of men
out there.

Mr. Carter?

If my men go,
will you take command?

1678
01:13:24,134 --> 01:13:25,199
Gladly, sir.

1679
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:26,234
How many men will ride?

1680
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:27,769
Somewhere around 40, I think.

1681
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:28,970
That's enough
for two troops.

Newton!
Yes, sir.

1683

You take command of
the first troop, and...

1684
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,674
Sir, I request permission
to lead the second.

In that uniform,
Lieutenant?

1686

24 hours' leave, sir.

01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:42,817

at Mr. Roberts' house.

to apologize?

1693

Of course, Johnny.

1694

I'd like to express
my gratitude.

01:21:30,653 --> 01:21:32,353
Tell Mr. Carter
I'd like a word with him.

1760
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:34,922
Mr. Carter just
rode away, sir.

1761
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:39,660
Giddy up!

1762
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:41,395
Hup! Hup!

1763
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,064
Whoa! Hold it!

1764
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:48,002
Where do you think
you're going?

1765
01:21:48,004 --> 01:21:49,603
Sacramento.
Los Angeles.

1766
01:21:49,605 --> 01:21:50,838
Well, make up
your minds.

1767
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,239
Well, uh, it really was
San Francisco.

1768
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:54,909
Look, here's $200.

1769
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:56,043
Get me an engagement ring--

1770
01:21:56,045 --> 01:21:58,913
the best
it'll buy.

1771
01:21:58,915 --> 01:22:00,514
It'll be a pleasure,
Lieutenant.

1772
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:01,815
Why, congratulations.

1773
01:22:01,817 --> 01:22:03,150
Thank you,
Miss Lisa.

1774
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:06,553
And here's a nail I bent
to the exact size.

1775
01:22:06,555 --> 01:22:08,355
And now, Mr. Carter,
it'll ease my conscience

1776
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:09,690
if you'll get the blazes
out of here.

1777
01:22:09,692 --> 01:22:10,691
(<i> laughs</i> )

1778
01:22:14,363 --> 01:22:16,230
My congratulations, too,
Lieutenant.

1779
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:18,365
It's "Captain,"
now, Scamper.

1780
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:19,366
Just got the news.

1781
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:20,401
Well!

1782
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:22,002
Here we go.

1783
01:22:22,004 --> 01:22:23,470
Any special plans?

1784
01:22:23,472 --> 01:22:26,340
Well, I'd still like
to open that theater

1785
01:22:26,342 --> 01:22:27,541
if I could raise
the money.

1786
01:22:27,543 --> 01:22:29,510
$20,000, wasn't it?

1787
01:22:29,512 --> 01:22:30,411
Mm-hmm.

1788
01:22:30,413 --> 01:22:32,079
You know, by a strange
coincidence,

1789
01:22:32,081 --> 01:22:34,181
I happen to have
just that amount

1790
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:36,183
in the lining
of my gun case.

1791
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:38,285
A gift from an uncle
in the North.

1792
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:39,787
Well...

1793
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:41,989
maybe I should marry
the uncle.

1794
01:22:41,991 --> 01:22:43,924
Oh, no.

1795
01:22:43,926 --> 01:22:46,293
Oh, no!

1796
01:22:56,238 --> 01:22:59,039
