I mean, for butting in.

4
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,968
I didn't believe it down at the general store
when they said:

5

"The preacher's up and left us."

6
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:53,474

All that sinning, lusting and killing.

Ask him.

Go ahead and ask him.

943
01:30:08,835 --> 01:30:11,633
Where the hell is that dagger
the man was killed with?

944
01:30:11,805 --> 01:30:15,206
That fancy one
with all them jewels in the handle.

Hm? The sheriff
and nobody else could find it.

What happened? The squirrels get it?

947
01:30:20,747 --> 01:30:22,214
- Did it walk away?
- I don't know.

You don't know? Just look at that face.
The old Injun said it, remember?

949
01:30:26,686 --> 01:30:30,213
Somebody snuck up afterwards and
yanked the dagger out of the man's chest...

950
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:31,652
...even before he was dead.

952
01:30:34,027 --> 01:30:35,995
Plenty, I bet.

953

And you call me a coyote.

954
01:30:39,633 --> 01:30:42,158
You dumb ox, you.

Oh, I figured I was helping you cover up.

Oh, boy, this is one time
I ain't gonna ride the rods.

962
01:31:13,933 --> 01:31:17,300
Gotta get the damn thing to stop here.

And I don't blame you none.

But what can I say?

Maybe, if you don't mind, preacher...

Maybe I can take it home with me.
