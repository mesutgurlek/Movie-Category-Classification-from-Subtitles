1
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,200
Give me that horse.

2
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,800
He couldn’t go on
nor could you.

3
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,700
You’re injured man.
Let us take you into the house.

4
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,400
I gotta go on. Gotta get to
the Telegraph station.

5
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,200
We'll take you.
Penelope!

6
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,900
Sorry, closed down for the night.

7
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,500
I know, but this is urgent...

8
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,900
No. Come out of there, you!

9
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,900
Can’t go against the schedule.
Closed down.

10
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,900
Can’t you make this one exception?
- No.

11
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,300
Get in here.
- What?

12
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,500
Bring a light with you.

13
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,500
You can’t do this to me.
I won’t stand for it!

14
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,700
The Union Pacific
won’t stand for it.

15
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,700
Night prowling round here,
like this.

16
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,500
You've got your gall busting
into my office.

17
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,100
Who do you think you're anyway?
My keys closed down for tonight.

18
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,500
You can write it,
but I won’t send it anyway.

19
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,900
Here let me!

20
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,800
<i>Territorial Recorders office,
Fort Lacey.</i>

21
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,450
<i>have filed corner stakes...</i>

22
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,800
<i>...on plots 234... 235.</i>

23
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,700
<i>Chart 1089,
record in my name...</i>

24
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,700
...that’s all.
- How shall I sign it?

25
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,400
<i>Quirt Evans.</i>

26
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,300
All sent, Mr. Evans.

27
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,300
Why! He ain’t dead, is he?

28
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,400
No just knocked out!

29
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,100
That’s Quirt Evans...

30
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,100
Look at his gun, see how many
notches he has got in his gun?

31
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,400
Not any that I can see.
Sure ain’t going to touch it to find out

32
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,300
might wake up and
take it the wrong way.

33
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,600
he was deputy of Wyatt Earp
in Tombstone.

34
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,600
...the two of them shot it out
with the whole Clanton bunch.

35
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,300
So, that’s Quirt Evans...

36
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,500
...he's quite a man
with the gals...

37
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,700
.it says he closed the eyes
of many a man

38
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,800
...opened the eyes
of many a women.

39
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,900
Would you call
my father please?

40
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,400
Yes! ma’am...

41
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,700
Where are you taking him?
- To the wagon, to take him home.

42
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,300
Quirt Evans?
Crazy!

43
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I’d just a soon have a black powder
bomb in my house.

44
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,800
Heavy, ain’t he?

45
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,500
I know of a dozen men
who’d ride night and day

46
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,500
...to catch Quirt Evans
helpless like this.

47
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,400
I’m worried about you people...

48
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,700
...I know you don’t believe in guns or
anything like that, only doing good.

49
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,300
Take my advice...

50
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,100
I’d stay plenty far away
from Mr. Quirt Evans.

51
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Thank you very much for your advice.
Goodnight.

52
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,500
Good night.

53
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,900
So long, Quirt.

54
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,800
That Quirt Evans
is surely something.

55
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,700
Quirt Evans?
You know him?

56
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,700
Do I know Quirt Evans?
Do I know Quirt Evans!

57
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,100
What a question!

58
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,200
Quirt: No... No...

59
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,000
If that doesn’t quiet him...
I don’t know what will?

60
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,100
...never get that bullet out of him
kicking around like that.

61
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,400
I’m afraid to give him any more sedative,
he has already had enough.

62
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,000
Please be quiet...
the doctor...

63
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,500
He can’t hear you.

64
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,800
What do you suppose that
delirious mind is searching for?

65
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,700
He must be in great pain
- Not with that much laudanum in him.

66
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,300
As if he was reaching for something.
Something specific.

67
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,800
I don’t understand. By now he
should be completely inert.

68
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Quirt: No.

69
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,500
Thomas, how is the young man?
- Delirious.

70
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,400
A gun in this house, Thomas?

71
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,000
Please put these back in the gun belt...

72
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,300
Maybe we'll have to get something
to tie him down.

73
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,400
Are you crazy?
- It’s empty.

74
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,800
That was it. A Gun.
- It’s a pity.

75
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,000
It’s stupid! These wild ones
I keep picking bullets out of them,

76
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,500
...and setting their bones, why?

77
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,300
It’s their destiny to wind up on boot hill.

78
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,500
No!

79
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,100
I forgot! Never speak evil, Eh!

80
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,700
Well, get me some more hot water
young lady.

81
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,400
Start patching him up for
whatever is in store for him.

82
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,200
Come on, help me with his boots.

83
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,000
Mother...
- Yes?

84
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,000
Tell me again.

85
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,000
What Dear?
- Oh, about meeting father?

86
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,300
Thee have heard that
a thousand times.

87
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,400
He was working on the roof of
the new meeting house.

88
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,400
...he fell off, and I picked him up
out of the dust and held him in my arms.

89
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,800
He always said that I hugged him
before I even knew his name.

90
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,000
And you both knew right away?
- Of course.

91
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,900
Of course I knew he
was a peaceful man....

92
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,400
...a member of the society.

93
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,100
An evil man will seek a more profitable
way of life

94
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,600
...than being a member
of the <i>"Friends"</i>.

95
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Father, had a beard then, didn’t he?
- Yes.

96
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,000
I should think that
would scratch...

97
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,200
I prefer a man clean shaved.

98
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,900
He’s got the constitution of a
mountain lion. He'll pull through.

99
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,100
Barring blood poisoning.

100
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,200
These wild ones never seem
to get blood poisoning...

101
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,600
...though it’s common enough
among the Godly.

102
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,000
You so called Atheists. You always feel
so compelled to stretch your Godlessness.

103
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,200
Wash him.
The bullet’s out.

104
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,600
He's in no danger.

105
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,300
I bet he killed a lot of people.
- No, he didn’t.

106
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,300
How do thee know?
- That’s enough, John...

107
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,700
...a <i>"friend"</i> doesn’t speak
of such things.

108
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,600
Mrs. Worth, get that
man out of here.

109
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,400
But he's badly injured,
doctor.

110
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,200
This isn’t civilized Pennsylvania...

111
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,700
...this is the raw frontier.
You must take a realistic attitude.

112
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,900
This is the place where mayhem, theft
and murder are the common place...

113
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,300
...instead of the unusual.

114
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,700
Would that justify leaving
a wounded man to die?

115
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,500
Build you house by the side of the road
and be a friend to man.

116
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,100
Ye who believe.

117
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,700
I don’t mind your mocking us,
you've been a good friend to us.

118
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,500
I’m glad I have
a logical mind.

119
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,200
And a good heart.
Goodnight, doctor.

120
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,500
Goodnight.

121
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,500
Still having delirious spells.
Keeps mumbling about his past.

122
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,600
...I’m afraid he's had
a very violent life.

123
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
[Quirt mumbling]:
Cards...

124
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
...cover my bet on the black ace...

125
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
...you're a shapely hussy...

126
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
...you get real conformation, Margaret...

127
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,100
...you fill out that dress just right...

128
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
...red's your color...

129
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,100
...alright Margaret...

130
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,500
...chart 1089...

131
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,500
...1089...

132
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,600
...Margaret you're a nuisance!
Let’s call it off, Margaret...

133
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,600
...I've got places to go and
country to put behind...

134
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,800
...sure, sure, alright...

135
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,020
...Lila... Lila...

136
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
...Lila..

137
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:16,300
...if I owned a mint...
put your head on every coin...

138
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,300
...I use to smoke corn silk
when I was a kid...

139
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,300
...your hair is just like that, Lila...

140
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:32,300
...lite brown, yellow all mixed up...
just like corn silk, Lila...

141
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,300
...all gold...
taunt...

142
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,000
Will you bring some
hot coffee, Penny?

143
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,800
Here the doctor says that he's
completely out of danger.

144
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,200
Just sleeping
You know Doctor...

145
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,300
...Penny considers him her
own personal patient.

146
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,300
Sit down.

147
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,800
Will you bring some milk dear?

148
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,600
And when you finish you can
go up and watch him...

149
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,100
while you card your
wool on the loon.

150
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,000
He doesn’t need watching. He has no
temperature in the past few days.

151
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,400
...just a superlatively healthy animal.

152
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,270
...restoring his depleted strength with
sleep. He's no longer delirious.

153
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,130
But of course, if you're determined
to watch over him, Penny...

154
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,400
...perhaps you better take a
pencil and paper with you.

155
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,630
...his first conscious words
should be recorded.

156
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,330
It may be of great interest
to history.

157
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,590
And more possibly to
the United States Marshal.

158
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,690
Who knows what violence is involved
with his battered frame and bullet holes.

159
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,570
Would you care for a donut, doctor?

160
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,850
They're not as light as it should be.
- Listen Mrs. Worth...

161
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,930
...you can carry this
head in sand attitude

162
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,930
just so far in the
world of reality.

163
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,400
...let me get this man
out of your house.

164
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,680
I can dump him in an establishment
that passes for a hotel.

165
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,120
...in this off times dubious
community of ours.

166
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,100
In Madame Sanitary hobble?
- Then he will be off your hands.

167
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,000
But he's much better off here
- Of course he's.

168
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,200
Who cares what happens to him?
- We do

169
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,500
I don’t know what to say?

170
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,400
Once when I was studying
medicine in Europe...

171
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,200
...I had a friend,
an artist.

172
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,300
He drew portrait’s of people
and made them...

173
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,300
resemble the animals
they reminded him of.

174
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,000
He would have drawn this man
as a coiled cobra.

175
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,200
Doctor, your analogies terribly imperfect
and your naturalism faulted.

176
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,800
Cobras don’t coil

177
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,600
Doctor, we are so fond of thee
and we respect you so greatly.

178
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,000
We assured that you
will finally realize...

179
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,600
...that realism untempered by
sentiments of humanity

180
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,100
...is really just a mean hard cold
outlook on life.

181
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,800
A frightened outlook.

182
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,100
I stand defeated.

183
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,900
And furthermore there are
times in this house...

184
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,900
...that I feel as if I’m living in
a never never land.

185
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,100
But don’t hesitate to call on me
anytime you need help.

186
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,200
Hello.

187
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,400
You're awake?
- Sure, I’m awake.

188
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,000
What is all this?
- What?

189
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,900
Where am I?

190
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,400
Don’t you remember? Father and I
drove you into town.

191
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,000
Is anything wrong?
- No.

192
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,100
The doctor says you will be alright
in a week or two.

193
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,500
You were delirious you know?
Two days and two nights.

194
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,200
Oh maybe that’s why
I’m so hungry.

195
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
I could eat a yearling steer...

196
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,900
...if I can catch one

197
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,100
We will get you something.

198
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,500
Mother!
You talked a lot in your deliria.

199
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,500
Mother, he's awake.
- How is he?

200
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,200
Hungry!

201
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,700
If he's hungry,
he’s going to be alright.

202
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,100
Thanks a lot for housing.
- You’re welcome.

203
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,300
Smoked sausages and eggs?

204
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,500
Sounds great.
- 2 eggs or would you like 3?

205
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,700
I would like 6.
- Ye shall have them.

206
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,700
Penny, get one of your father’s
shirts here, and a razor.

207
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,000
I’ll go get him some food...

208
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,300
So I talked a lot.
- Yes.

209
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,300
I listened only because
I thought that you might

210
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,300
say something that would
aide us in helping you.

211
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,700
...notifying your wife
for instance.

212
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,800
What did I say?
- If you had a wife.

213
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,800
What did I talk about?

214
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,500
You talked of Margaret,
she...

215
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,200
...fell out of a red dress...

216
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,200
What else?

217
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,400
Oh, you mentioned someone
named <i>"Lila".</i>

218
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,900
Is that all?

219
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,400
If you have a wife,
we could notify her.

220
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,100
No wife.

221
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,480
That’s 12.

222
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,740
I haven’t been so flattered
since my donuts...

223
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
won first prize at the fair
back in Pennsylvania.

224
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,590
They must be smart
in Pennsylvania.

225
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,330
Some of the members thought it’s an
exhibition of pride to enter my donut.

226
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,820
But what harm can there be
in a little donut...

227
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,120
...unless, one eats so many
of them, they explode,

228
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,920
which is likely to happen
to you, young man.

229
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,450
...well there's worst ways
of checking out.

230
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,500
I’ll help you with the dishes.
- No, you stay and watch Quirt Evans.

231
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,790
I’m curious to know
the effect of 6 eggs

232
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,790
a pound of sausage
and 12 donuts.

233
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,210
I’ll call thee in
time for the milking.

234
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,320
Do all you people from Pennsylvania
talk like that?

235
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,870
Like what?

236
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,100
<i>"Thee."</i>

237
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,640
We’re <i>"Friends".</i>

238
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,190
<i>"Friends"</i> of who?
- Of all.

239
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,900
The society of <i>"Friends".</i>
Many people call us <i>"Quakers".</i>

240
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,380
Oh! It’s a religion.
- It’s a belief.

241
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,000
That on the wall...

242
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,100
<i> "Each human being has an
integrity that can be hurt only...</i>

243
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,400
<i>..."by the act of that
same human being.</i>

244
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,800
<i>"...And not by the act of
another human being."</i>

245
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,700
Is that Quaker stuff?

246
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,900
You mean nobody can
hurt you but yourself?

247
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,900
That’s what the <i>"Friends"</i> believe.

248
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,200
Well suppose somebody whacks you
over the head with a branding iron...

249
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,100
...won’t that hurt?
- Physically, of course.

250
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,600
But in reality, it would injure only the
person doing the act of violence.

251
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,600
Only the doer can be hurt by
an evil or mean act.

252
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,700
Are there many of you Quakers?
- Very few.

253
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,100
Sort of figured that.

254
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
Good morning gentlemen.
- Good morning.

255
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,700
Carrot from our garden.

256
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
I found these out
at the road.

257
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,000
It belongs to a fella
named <i>"Quirt Evans".</i>

258
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,200
I understand you're
a friend of his,

259
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,700
maybe you can see to it
he gets them back...

260
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,500
Leave it here. I’ll make sure
that he gets them.

261
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,300
That Quirt, he’d loose his shirt
if it wasn't buttoned on.

262
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,500
...careless about everything.

263
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,900
I keep telling him,
sooner or later.....

264
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,230
On second thoughts you can just
tell me where he's, and..

265
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,420
I can take it on back to him, myself.
Where is Quirt Evans?

266
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,350
You mean where is he?

267
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,970
Ever notice how fella keep
repeating the question,

268
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,770
when he's stalling
about answering.

269
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,460
Yeah! Maybe if I bend this gun over
his head, he’ll quit stalling.

270
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,010
But gentlemen,
I hardly know Quirt Evans.

271
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,960
He lies too.

272
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,120
You’ve been bragging all over town
of what good friends you two are.

273
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,000
You know, this fella ain’t got
many good qualities, has he?

274
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,570
Sit down, friend.

275
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,600
Maybe that will help your memory
I’m asking about Quirt Evans.

276
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,260
Well all I know is...

277
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,840
Thanks for sewing the shirt...

278
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,910
...but I can’t find my pants.

279
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,100
Get back in bed.

280
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,780
Laziness is the only thing
that’s kept me there this long.

281
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,020
The doctor said that you’re to stay
in bed 4 more days.

282
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,910
Oye, you're up.

283
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,760
That’s no way to speak
to an older person, John.

284
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,900
We’re pals...

285
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,780
...you wouldn’t expect a pal
to call me <i>"Mister",</i> would you?

286
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,890
See, doctor said to tell you that some
men in town are looking for you.

287
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,530
..Said one of them is
a Mister Laredo Stevens.

288
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,340
Get my pants.
- But you’re leg.

289
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,140
Johnny, get me my pants.
- No, John.

290
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,610
Will thee get my pants?

291
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,230
Get the pants,
John.

292
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,970
But you said,

293
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,290
What are you looking at?
- Thee.

294
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,030
Oh boy, it’s a good thing
I’m not a tattletale.

295
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,000
What set him off?

296
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,250
"Thee" is a familiar term.
- The what?

297
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,350
The familiar, the plain language.
<i>"Get thee my pants,"</i> ye said.

298
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,410
What about it?

299
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,200
Oh, among us, <i>"thee"</i> and <i>"thou"</i> are used
only among the loved ones.

300
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,070
...to all others, we use
<i>"You, he, and they"</i>

301
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,050
...mother to children, husband to wife
and children to...

302
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,090
Between lovers of course.

303
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,620
I’m sorry.
- I’m not.

304
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,860
What?

305
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,360
I’m not! I wished thee would
speak that way to me.

306
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,830
Well.

307
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,770
I knew right away.
That night.

308
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,950
It’s supposed to be
a dull kind of life.

309
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,380
I could take you
a lot of places...

310
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,140
I’d go.
- What?

311
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,050
I would rather stay
here with thee

312
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,440
but if thee rather go someplace else,
then I would go someplace else.

313
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,760
I sound very bold?

314
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,640
Well, it’s just that...

315
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,370
...I didn’t think religious people
were quite so, sudden and direct...

316
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,900
Well that’s the way I feel and it would
be dishonest to say anything else.

317
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,410
Yeah!

318
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,890
I used to wonder about it,
I suppose every girl does.

319
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,820
About what?

320
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,750
About love......

321
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,840
About whether or not you got to know
someone whom you know a little by little

322
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,650
...or it happened at once...

323
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,070
Thee are shocked....

324
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,490
Well, I wouldn’t say shocked exactly....

325
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:06,110
...you sure get to the point.
- Should I be different?

326
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,220
No, Penny, I like you
just the way you are.

327
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,930
Who emptied this gun?
- Father

328
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:19,960
Quirt, a gun is a symbol of force, evil.
We never have one in our home.

329
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,020
It’s a concession that father
allowed even an empty one.

330
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,340
It’s only because you couldn’t rest without...
- Where are the cartridges?

331
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,340
Outside.

332
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,090
Hey! Why don’t we
just bust in?

333
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,050
Because busting through doors with
Quirt Evans on the other side,

334
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,560
...ain’t my idea
of a healthy past time.

335
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,990
Tell them to <i>"come in".</i>

336
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,650
<i>"Come in."</i>

337
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,990
You can stand right there.

338
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,910
...against the light.

339
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,790
Howdy, Quirt.

340
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,560
You sure ran a ring
around me alright.

341
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,250
I don’t think it was right
friendly of you to beat me

342
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,580
..to locating that tract
after my boys found it.

343
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,610
I’m willing to listen
to your side of it,

344
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,860
I’m a reasonable man.

345
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,940
Sure, Laredo is always reasonable

346
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,950
That’s why he's the biggest man
in the territory.

347
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,870
You’re the biggest man
in the territory, Laredo?

348
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,920
So a lot of people say.
- I hadn’t heard.

349
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,720
You nervous?
- No, Evans.

350
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,480
I can’t figure out, why you keep
stepping on my toes all the time...

351
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,440
But, that’s your business.

352
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,540
I’m a good loser.

353
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,780
...I like a good loser.

354
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,790
Course I like any kind of loser
better than a winner.

355
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,300
...yeah!

356
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,590
You know I had a chance to
do a heap of thinking

357
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,590
while I was following your
trail across the territory.

358
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,180
I followed it by the string of
ran out horses you left behind....

359
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,480
Well, I figured it out this way.

360
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,840
Quirt, don’t really
want that land.

361
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,180
Because working isn’t
exactly in his line.

362
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,990
[Quirt]:
Is it in your line?

363
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,990
No, of course not. I was getting
it for another fella.

364
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,950
And well, I figured maybe you'll sell.

365
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,630
I don’t hear anything jingle.

366
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,090
Is it alright to put my hand
inside my shirt?

367
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,360
Why not?

368
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,960
$5,000 in gold there.

369
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,200
I want 20.

370
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,430
Well okay, but I have to owe you 15,
that’s all I got on me.

371
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,240
I have the deed in my pocket, here
- Get it out.

372
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,170
Now, if the young lady could find us
something to sign this with.

373
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,000
Still Laredo’s hired boy,
eh, Hondo?

374
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,780
Picking up after him,
carrying matches for his cigars.

375
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,470
You mind yourself.
- He'll mind himself...

376
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,930
... Won’t you Hondo?
- Miss...

377
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,960
..Would you mind taking this over
to Mister Evans please?

378
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,960
Thank you.

379
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,430
You know, I’m sure glad to see
you up and around, Quirt...

380
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,190
...we heard you were
flat on your back.

381
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,170
Sorry to disappoint you.

382
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,530
You come on over and get the
rest of that money anytime.

383
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,500
Anytime, that you feel
you're able.

384
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,310
I’ll see you one
of these days.

385
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,140
Well... ah,
so long, Quirt.

386
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,320
Saddle up my horse, will you kid?
Throw on my war bags.

387
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,660
What would have happened if they
knew the gun was empty?

388
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,210
It would have been: <i>"Saturday
night in Sioux City."</i>

Tie on my slicker too.

390
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,670
Sorry.
- Oh, no, Quirt, no.

391
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,100
What kind of a boarder
do you think I’m?

392
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,240
You can’t do that. We'd have tended
any wounded human, and not for pay.

393
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,150
You don’t believe in force, so you
can't force me to take it back.

394
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,540
I’m afraid you're outwitted,
Thomas.

395
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,650
How long I have been here?
- Almost 3 weeks.

396
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,930
Kinda hate to get going.

397
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,470
But you can’t. Your leg!
You are in no condition to travel.

398
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:06,900
Don’t worry, your cooking has me
grained up and ready for market.

399
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,550
Adios, amigos.

400

Quirt.

401
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,240
Shall I pack my things?

402
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,780
Why?
- Thee leave without me?

403
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,410
I got places to go...

404
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,790
Quirt, I didn’t care, it doesn’t make
any difference to me how far...

405
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,670
I know so little...
I.....

406
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,710
...I didn’t know that it could happen
to one and not the other.

407

..I thought it always
happen to both.

That isn’t it.

Well...

Look, Penny...

412
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,730
...I’m not that kind of guy
that does things suddenly.

413
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,280
I gotta look before I leap.

414
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,710
You can ask anybody,
they'll tell you...

415
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,140
...Quirt Evans is a
mighty cautious citizen.

416

Oh then, it’s just that thee
are not sure yet?

417
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,550
Yeah!
Sorry.

418
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,480
Please stay.

419
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,570
It’s all saddled, Quirt.

420
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:41,780
Unsaddle it.

421
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,310
You gonna stay?

422

A double eagle!

423
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,790
Well there is something that I
rather have than this.

424
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,770
A favor. A big favor.
- Well, you got them both. What is it?

425
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,960
Will you ride past my
schoolhouse with me?

426
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,490
Because a lot of boys who don’t
believe that I know Quirt Evans.

Sure.

443
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,630
Surely you could walk to
the barn without that.

00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,350
What?
- The gun.

445
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,610
It balances me, one leg is longer
than the other.

Say, wasn’t this place irrigated?

465
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,850
I see all these flumes
and ditches.

466
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,170
Frederick Carson
turned the water off.

467
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,340
Frederick Carson?

468
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,550
He's the man who bought
the ranch from friends

469
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,150
who couldn’t make a go of it.

470
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:15,080
We had built a community dam,
but... It was on his property.

471
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,110
Whatcha you do about it?
Don’t tell me. You prayed.

472
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,550
Of course.
- Getcha any water?

473
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,910
We didn’t pray for water.
We prayed for Frederick Carson.

474
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,740
Carson turned off the water
and you prayed for him?

475
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,250
Of course.

476
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,280
Can’t you see? By committing an evil act
the poor man injured his soul?

477
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,870
I’m glad there’s a well.

478
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,300
Cause it sure gets thirsty
around here

479
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,800
...if we had to wait for Carson.
Gotta walk this pony.

480
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,590
Penny.

481
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,780
Nothing.

482
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,670
Be sure you don’t leave any
slack on that cinch.

483
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,340
Boss will sure howl...

484
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,830
This ain’t the first pony
I ever saddled.

485
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,130
...he'd squawk no matter
how I done it.

486
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,040
He's sure getting mean these days,
ain’t he?

487
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,870
You can take it as his natural born.

488
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,070
That boil on his neck don’t
help him none either.

489
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,280
Get out of my way.

490
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,030
You belong behind a plough.

491
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,410
Who's Carson?

492
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:10,160
Don’t get down. We ain’t taking
on no saddle tramps here.

493
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,560
Are you deaf?
I said get moving, tramp.

494
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,420
Nice dam.
- Yeah, what’s that to you?

495
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,460
Take out the top two planks.

496
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,120
What did you say?

497
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,900
The top two. There are 16 inches
of water over there.

498
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,210
Who says so?
- I do.

499
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,650
And who might you be when
you're at home?

500
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,540
Quirt Evans.

501
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,790
Well anybody might ride up here
and say they’re Quirt Evans.

502
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,320
He ain't known round
here by sight.

503
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,310
Anybody can say
they’re him.

504
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,440
Sure could.

505
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,680
There's a <i>"Q. E."</i>
stamped on his saddle.

506
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,550
Well, take the top planks out of
the head gate you stupid idiot.

507
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,410
I don’t need all that extra water.

508
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,990
Step up on that pony.

509
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,370
Now, look here Mr. Evans, I’ve done
what you’ve told me too.

510
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:19,000
You sure did.
Step up on that pony.

511
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,170
Well, I’m the kind of fella who tries to
get along with everybody.

512
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,000
Side me.
- Wait a minute.

513
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,620
Maybe we better take off a
couple more of them planks...

514
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,020
cause I have 10 times
the water I need.

515
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,230
That will do for now.

516
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,700
Well, if you ever need more, Mr. Evans,
all you got to do is say so...

517
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,150
I figured that...

518
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,350
Hey, Mom! Water!

519
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,480
Water, water!

520
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:05,260
Mother, look at the flow.
Mother all the ditches are full of water.

521
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,910
Water! Water!
- Wonderful!

522
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,110
Thomas!

523
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,410
Let’s start off from the scratch...

524
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,520
...you got more water than you need.

525
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,840
Absolutely right, Quirt,
I mean Mr. Evans.

526
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,830
Do you mind if I call you <i>"Quirt"?</i>

527
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,340
Not a bit...

528
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,550
So it’s no skin off your moccasins if
you let a little water over that ditch.

529
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,540
Absolutely no Mr. Evans...
I mean, <i>"Quirt".</i>

530
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,070
You're going to be neighborly or not?
- Well, I sure am, Quirt.

531
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,090
That’s the way to talk.

532
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,280
Thomas!

533
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,340
Frederick Carson.
- Howdy, Mrs. Worth.

534
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,710
We always knew you would
change your mind.

535
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,030
Yes ma’am,
I did.

536
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,530
Thank you Frederick, all of us here
in the valley are grateful to you.

537
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,070
Well, it’s like what
I was saying,

538
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,070
I ain’t got any use
for all that extra water...

539
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,210
Why shouldn’t let my
neighbors use it?

540
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,850
I believe that neighbors
should be friendly.

541
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,490
What have you got there on your neck?
A boil?

542
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,760
Mrs. Worth, I have wrestle with
that dang burnt boil...

543
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,860
Have you tried putting soap into it?

544
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,550
No, ma’am. I ain’t.

545
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,520
You get down for a minute and into
the house and I’ll fix it for you.

546
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,860
You are going to hurt me?
- No...That’s a shame... it looks awful.

547
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:09,000
Well, looks like your prayers
straightened everything out.

548
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,580
So you think your gun changed
Frederick Carson?

549
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,560
Who says I pointed a gun?

550
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,490
I do.
- Well, I didn’t.

551
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,880
He gave in more easily
than I expected.

552
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,800
Thee remember this Quirt:

553
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,500
<i>"The lord moves in
mysterious manner...</i>

554
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,710
<i>...at times using strange methods
and odd instruments."</i>

555
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:28,340
Me?
It would be odd.

556
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,400
I just get a gnawin’ hankerin’ after
good pies and truck like that...

557
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,130
Frederick Carson!
- Yes ma’am?

558
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,450
I want you to have these,

559
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,250
they’re awfully good with
coffee in the morning.

560
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,080
Makes me to go home
and shoot my Chinese cook.

561
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,240
You just come back for more anytime
you like, there are always plenty.

562
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,920
Thanks.
- Goodbye.

563
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,470
Goodbye, Frederick.
- Goodbye.

564
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,930
A man outta see more
of his neighbors.

565
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,680
Wonderful woman that Mrs. Worth...
She fixed my boil.

566
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,060
[Mother]:
Penny!

567
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,400
Excuse me. But I think father
wants to give thanks...

568
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,130
You know, he already
thanked me.

569
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,860
I know, but now I think, he wants to
thank someone else.

570
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,820
Hold my pondering when I get aboard.
Will you?

571
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,040
Mrs. Worth is going to keep me
supplied with pies

572
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,410
... I ought to bring her a quarter of beef
now and then.

573
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,680
Finally, come to an understanding
with my neighbors.

574
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,260
You sure did.

575
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,910
Oh! You knew I was scare to death,
when I made that speech to them people.

576
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,230
...I’m glad you made me do it.
Makes me feel good.

577
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,940
Adios, amigo.

578
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,700
Dinner.

579
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,900
What’s the dinner
going to be?

580
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,100
Roast venison, vegetables, and
of course a skimpy chicken.

581
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,300
With the pie and cake
I’ll try to make out.

582
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,100
Chicken or venison?.
- Both. I feel real good.

583
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,800
Oh, thee do?

584
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,630
New dress.

585
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,640
Oh! It’s first day.
You call it <i>"Sunday".</i>

586
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,000
Quirt, do me a favor,
hitch up the ponies for father.

587
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,450
Sure.

588
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:54,910
And will you do me
another favor?

589
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,160
Go for a ride with us.
- Where?

590
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,310
You’re not to ask,
it’s a surprise, a pleasant one.

591
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,680
Hey Quirt!
We gotta surprise for you.

592
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,140
He knows,
I told him.

593
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,420
Thought you weren’t allowed
to work on Sundays.

594
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,560
Quirt, there is nothing we’re
not allowed to do...

595
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,370
...it’s just we don’t believe
in doing what we know is wrong.

596
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,110
That makes it pretty much
<i>"Each fellas own guess".</i>

597
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,160
Each fell knows, inside.

598
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:30,330
There’s a lot of gents I wouldn’t
wanna give that much leeway too.

599
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,210
I didn’t mean to
frighten you, miss.

600
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,560
Is a fella named Quirt Evans
around here?

601
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,360
Yes, I’ll get him.

602
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,110
Never mind.
I can do my talking to you.

603
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:11,170
Has he been here long?

604
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,400
About 3 weeks I guess.

605
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:20,350
He didn’t disappear for say
2 days, during that time, did he?

606
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:24,780
No.
- Hello, you weather beaten hang man...

607
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:27,760
Penny, this is Wistful McLintock...
the martial of the territory.

608
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,110
Hiya Miss!

609
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,910
Don’t let that grey hair fool you.
He's a curly wolf.

610
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,890
Hello, Quirt. I thought I had
you about half hung.

611
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:40,170
Tall fella. Fast with a gun held up
the Bakers stage. Killed a couple.

612
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,500
Well, you're tall and some say
you're a fast man.

613
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,130
..but I guess, I’ll have to take
the little lady’s word for it.

614
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,010
When you and Laredo Stevens going to
get around to killing one another?

615
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,680
Laredo?

616
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,150
We water our horses out of the
same trough...

617
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,410
Well, I’m sure looking forward
to hanging the survivor.

618
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,490
You know, I’m a figuring man...

619
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,890
...sometimes I don’t know
all the answers....

620
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,590
...like that fella
<i>"Quirt Evans"</i>

621
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,000
Handy man with a colt...

622
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:19,560
...while he was acting as Wyatt Earp’s
deputy over in Tombstone

623
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,960
...one day turns in his badge,

624
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,760
and starts to build himself
a nice cattle spread.

625
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,310
Suddenly he sells out
and he goes on a pry.

626
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:38,380
Why? That’s what I
ain’t figured yet.

627
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,050
Sometimes things connect.

628
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,850
About that time a fella,
called <i>"Walt Emerson".</i>..

629
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,460
...went down in front of
Laredo Stevens...

630
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,270
...Walt was reaching for his gun,

631
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:53,770
some say a gambler standing there
grabbed his hand....

632
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:56,040
...maybe that’s connected...

633
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,980
How did you stand
with Walt Emerson?

634
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,050
I knew him.

635
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:04,870
Two things connected?

636
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,370
I know a lot of people.

637
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,450
Well, I’ll figure it out...

638
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,240
...I usually do.
I’m patient.

639
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,000
Little lady, don’t be looking at him...

640
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:21,650
with your eyes all bugged out l
ike a cow would a bull.

641
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:26,140
...there ain’t no future in it.
So long folks.

642
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,900
Quirt, please stay away
from Laredo Stevens.

643
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:35,500
He owes me money. And don’t worry
I might come out on top.

644
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,540
That would be even worse.

645
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,030
Worse! Would it be worse if he
goes down than I go down?

646
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,660
Of course not,
don’t you see?

647
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,800
Oh, I’ll be a guy
with a marked soul.

648
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,240
Don’t make it sound so crude, Quirt,
you see why- I couldn’t love you.

649
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,930
Alright I won’t
lookup Laredo.

650
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,150
It’s better this way

651
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,570
...every time he opens his door,

652
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:01,870
every time he hears footsteps
coming round the corner...

653
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,770
...Laredo starts sweating,
thinking it’s me.

654
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:07,150
...his food won’t set well
for the rest of his life.

655
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,670
Well alright, if I’m going to be holy
I gotta get some fun out of it.

656
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,850
You know I feel like such a gadabout.

657
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,450
It seems hardly a whole week
since last First day.

658
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,410
Hey Quirt!

659
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,510
I thought it was you.

660
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,230
Well, well, well
- Hello.

661
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,990
Mister and Mrs. Worth,
Randy McCall.

662
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:14,520
How do you do
- How do you do?

663
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:16,080
Just fine, thank you.

664
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,020
Well, well, well...
- You said that before.

665
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,070
We don’t want to keep you
if you're in a hurry.

666
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:23,550
I’m not in no hurry. I’ve got no place to go.
- Well, we have.

667
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,240
Would ye care to come along with us?
- Sure, where?

668
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,030
To a meeting.
Both men: To a meeting?

669
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,550
Yes, to meeting.
You don’t wanna go do you?

670
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:37,130
It would be nice if he could.
- We'd be happy to have any friend of Quirt’s.

671
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,620
You would?
Well that’s fine.

672
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,240
You know ma’am...
I sure am an old friend of Quirt’s.

673
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,150
I remember one time we were chasing
cattle down the Lawanda river...

674
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,090
...herd stampeded, Quirt pulled me out
from underneath it.

675
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,470
And there was another time remember?
In Opus Palace, down at San Antonio.

676
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,300
We're late.
- I know, but...

677
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,300
Good bye.

678
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,240
If you can join us it is in the grove,
just on the other side of the town.

679
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,870
Thank you ma’am.
- Good day.

680
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,750
Get along.
- Good day.

681
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:15,250

What comes out of this thing
that makes it worth all this work?

691
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,350
Frozen pudding.

692
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,980
Hello, Nelson.
- Hello, Penny.

693
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:57,060
Nelson, meet Quirt Evans.

694
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,280
- How do you do?
- Howdy.

695
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:04,090
Nelson’s our horse shoer.

696
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:11,770
By the way I brought that
maple sugar you like so much.

697
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:14,940
Oh, excuse me, I’ll put it here.
- Thank you.

698
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:19,480
Isn’t this the Morgan baby?
- Yes, I’m minding her.

699
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,180
He sure is a cute little fella.

700
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,840
Looks just like his father.

701
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:31,040
I’m coming up next week
to shoe the horses.

702
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,190
Oh, Fine.

703
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:39,060
I’ll get some water.
- Here, let me help you.

704
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,140
Here, twirl this thing.

705
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,750
Frozen pudding.

706
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,150
Hold him a minute, Quirt,
I want some of those flowers.

707
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:09,310
Sick or something?

708
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,920
I don’t believe it.

709
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,750
It’s a baby.
- Yeah, I know.

710
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:24,090
Is it old enough to talk?
- Of course not.

711
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:26,570
If it can’t talk,
it can’t snitch.

712
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,490
I’ve got something I think
you would like to hear.

713
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,220
Laredo Stevens
is making a big play.

714
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,150
...he's going to jump
up some guys

715
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,850
that are moving a trail herd
down from the north.

716
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,770
I figured, it maybe you, me and
couple of friends can play copycat.

717
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,050
You heard me,
didn’t you?

718
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:45,350
You can have
my part of it.

719
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:47,150
What am I listening to?

720
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,050
You passing up a chance
to blister Laredo?

721
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:50,950
That’s right.

722
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,650
What’s the matter with you Quirt?
Is farm life...

723
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,150
Oh, the Jane....

724
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,630
Sticking in your head into this bucket
will shut you up.

725
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,110
You are awful touchy lately... you never
used to mind what I said.

726
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,200
Hello.
- Hi.

727
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,760
Come along with the water, Quirt.

728
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,260
Shut up.

729
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:30,110
Quirt, would you
come over here?

730
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,890
Sit down.

731
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,900
May I have your attention?

732
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:52,740
Friends, we all know the purpose
of this meeting is three fold.

733
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,490
As always to give thanks to the
goodness bestowed upon us.

734
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,980
...but also to give thanks for particular
that the fields are getting water.

735
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,450
... and the crops and
the livestock’s thrive.

736
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:07,430
There are two marsh’s
right at the top of the valley.

737
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,520
...if you take a look from out there, you
can see a herd coming from 10 miles.

738
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,810
[Mr. Worth]:
...Quirt Evans.

739
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,640
Friends...

740
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:32,040
We are happy to present you with this
token of our friendship for you.

741
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,990
This is <i>"Quirt Evans".</i>

742
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:44,260
We are happy to have him here with us,
because he provided another incident

743
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,380
...which reaffirms our belief...

744
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,150
...that all men are good
if they're shown the light.

745
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,320
He persuaded <i>"Frederick Carson"</i>
to let down the water...

746
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:56,590
...by showing him, that a man who
is a friend to other men...

747
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,210
is a happy man himself.

748
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,640
May I shake your hand,
Quirt Evans?

749
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:28,050
I want to talk to you.

750
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:38,150
This will sound like I’m butting
into your business and I’m.

751
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:41,050
And you outta give me a watch
with a gold case for doing it.

752
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:43,650
You dim witted nail bender!
Marry that girl.

753
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:46,650
Marry her? Why sure, you know...,
she knows how I feel.

754
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,350
How would she know?

755
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,750
Stop yamering about shoeing horses
that’s no way to talk to a girl.

756
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:56,150
Talk to her about her.
And marry her. And do it quick.

757
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:59,650
Hey!
- Come on!

758
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,850
Listen to this.....

759
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:13,850
<i>"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,</i>

760

<i>"the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel,</i>

761
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:17,850
<i>"who had done many acts of valor,</i>

762
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,000

midst of a pit in time of snow"</i>

764
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,150
Whoo! Three lions!

765
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:28,150
<i>"And Benaiah slew an Egyptian
who had a sword.</i>

slew him with a staff."</i>

767
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,850
I guess that must mean
a club

768
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:36,250
Oh, brother this is good writing.
- Let's go.

769
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,150
What about the Bible?

770
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,250
You can’t throw it away,
That would be bad luck.

771
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,450
Then keep it.

772
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:45,550
Alright. This is one book,
I’m sure going to read.

773
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,750
I would better take you back
to the Morgan’s.

774
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,450
Why did Quirt leave 
so abruptly?

775
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:10,850
I don’t know...

776
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,450
Hey Bob!
- Yeah?

777
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,550
Right on time.
Look behind you.

778
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,750
Let’s saddle up men.

779
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,950
Let’s get out of here.

780
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,850
Look! Coming down
off the hill!

781
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,350
Come on...

782
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:12,950
Hey Quirt,
what does <i>"beget"</i> mean?

783
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,650
I think I hear them.

784
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:22,850
Yeah!
- Let’s get hitched up.

785
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,250
I don’t know how I
missed this book.

786
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,500
You know you’re very strange.
But I like you just the same.

787
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,450
On account your head works.

788
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:37,950
Much nicer this way....

789
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,450
You know anybody can
just shoot these guys.

790
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:42,850
...you think of an interesting
way of doing it.

791
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:46,250
...and you know Quirt!
I hate to shoot people.

792
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,350
Remember I shot a waddie
once in Montana?

793
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:51,850
I dreamed about it,
all the next night.

794
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:54,900
Then of course, there’s always witnesses,
than you gotta shoot the witnesses.

795
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,550
Stop jabbering and let’s go.
- Okay, take it easy pal.

796
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,550
Settle down,
don’t wanna lose my war bags.

797
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:03,850
Then again, I figured you may
have changed your mind

798
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:06,350
about shooting it out with Laredo
along with these guys.

799
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:09,550
Step up on that horse.
- Okay, you got it.

800
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:14,150
Maybe you're just crowding Laredo
into drawing in front of a lot of people.

801
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,750
Gonna saving him for the big night
In town, eh!

802
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,050
Hey... look!

803
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:28,050
Let’s go.

804
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,750
Take the outsider, Dennis.

805
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:55,050
Start turning them, Hondo.

806
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,750
I ain't, Hondo.

807
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,250
That’s a horse like Quirt has...

808
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,250
Yeah! That’s just who it is.

809
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:41,350
Next time we face...
- Yeah! I know...

810
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:45,350
Wipe those new boots off
and see if you can run him down.

811
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,350
You know that champagne maybe 
a lot fancier than whiskey.

812
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:15,750
..But sure it don’t give 
you quick action.

813
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:19,050
To tell you the truth. I don’t really like it. 
- It’s very fashionable.

814
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:20,550
How do you like it?

815
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:24,150
Tickles going down and it’s expensive.
So I like it.

816
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,950
You sleepy Tommy?
- Nope.

817
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:29,750
Tired?
- No.

818
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:33,050
Worried or maybe
just plain bored?

819
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:36,150
Not a chance baby.
You never bored me.

820
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,150
I wish I had that in writing.

821
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,850
You know it’s a long time
since you told me that...

822
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:43,250
...my hair reminded you of corn silk.

823
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:48,650
Alright! Your hair reminds
me of corn silk.

824
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:53,050
All golden, darling?
- That’s right...

825
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:55,430
All golden.

826
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:03,350
You have changed...
You’re less romantic.

827
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,850
...a lot more absentminded.

828
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:12,050
Take a turn at the wheel.
Win yourself a farm in Kansas.

829
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,650
I don’t want a farm in Kansas.

830
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,050
Well alright! I’ll win you
a trip around the world.

831
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:25,050
Miss Lila, the customers are waiting,
and that’s no way to treat customers.

832
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:02,050
25 hot one on the red.

833
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:05,250
Give me a stack of blues.

834
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:17,750
<i>"There’s something in your eyes...</i>

835
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:20,550
<i>"...a little bit different.</i>

836
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:25,050
<i>"Something that appeals to me.</i>

837
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:31,350
<i>"I love the way they change
from angels to devils...</i>

838
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:35,650
<i>"always full of mystery.</i>

839
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:42,150
<i>"There is something in your smile
a little bit different...</i>

840
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:46,050
<i>"Something I’ve been looking for.</i>

841
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:52,450
<i>"If I can just be sure

842
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:56,550
<i>"...I would never ask for more.</i>

843
01:05:57,150 --> 01:06:01,850
<i>"I’ve had a funny little feeling...</i>

844
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:06,550
<i>"...the first time we met.."</i>

845
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:08,150
17 odd on black.

846
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:11,350
17, there goes the last button
on my shirt.

847
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:17,050
Alright buddy, you gonna let it ride?
Going to ride on 17?

848
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,450
Cash me in.

849
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:23,450
Place your bets.

850
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:29,050
<i>“Something that I never knew...”</i>

851
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:31,750

852
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:36,250

853
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:44,450
<i>"That’s why I - love - youuuu!!!"</i>

854
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,450
Thanks for the money, daddy.

855
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:50,150
I hope you didn’t think
I was hinting.

856
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,550
Bourbon,
large glass.

857
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:57,050
There’s plenty of rooms on either side,

858
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:59,550
you have to come bullying
in between us?

859
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:00,850
I didn’t see you...

860
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:03,000
You interrupted a very
important discussion

861
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:05,240
on serious matters
regarding big things.

862
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,100
Me and my brothers, 
don’t like it.

863
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:09,210
Gentlemen, gentlemen...
no trouble please.

864
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:12,570
We just put the place back together
after the last difference of opinion..

865
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:15,760
...gentlemen, more over the breakage
and the overhead. Mainly the breakage.

866
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:18,210
I had a dreadful time
keeping body and soul together

867
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:22,310
What I think is going to happen,
happens...

868
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,310
...it will round off a full day.

869
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,480
There’s your trip.

870
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,830
What’s eating you Tall man?

871
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,160
You had words with 
those Baker brothers?

872
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,430
Who?
- Those 4 rhinos.

873
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,190
No.

874
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:42,270
Told around they're some
quarrelsome citizens.

875
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:47,240
Gentlemen, lets consider the incident
closed. Watch our tempers.

876
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:50,870
Maybe I would go 
and apologize.

877
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:04,300
More whiskey.
-That did it!

878
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,670
I’ll be right back.
I hope.

879
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:22,790
Where have you been?
- Oh, Randy always on tap.

880
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,880
You don’t know what you
are doing to me...

881
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:28,720
Please...
I’ve got a large family.

882
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,250
Hey, wait a minute,
it’s me.

883
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:51,050
Billy, get him.

884
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:52,850
That’s my old friend, Billy.

885
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:02,050
Come on get him... come on
get hold of him.

886
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:08,850
Go on, you got him.
You've got him!

887
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:12,650
Thanks.

888
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:17,350
I must have hit the wrong man.
- I’ll say you did, you...

889
01:09:26,650 --> 01:09:29,750
Hey, for...!
- Sorry, Quirt. How you doing?

890
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:44,150
Don’t worry about me.
Come on.

891
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:47,750
You wait outside. Check them
and count them as we throw them out.

892
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:55,750
One!
- Don't count!

893
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:09,350
It’s gettin’ late.

894
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:15,150
Oh honey, I was so afraid
you'd get hurt.

895
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:24,150
All singing:<i>"And I’ll never see my
darling any more </i>

896
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:30,150
<i>"I’m sitting by the river
and I’m weeping all the day!!! </i>

897
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:34,150
<i>"For you’ve gone from the
old Kentucky shore!!!"</i>

898
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:38,450
It’s wonderful. We have money,
whiskey and lovely ladies.

899
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:39,850
and just had a beautiful fight.

900
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:42,150
...I tell you, we would really ought a
be thankful for our blessings.

901
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:44,750
Ah, you have been reading
that bible again.

902
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,550
That’s something I never
thought I would see.

903
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:47,650
What?

904
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,350
A Bible with your name on it.

905
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:52,550
Now where would you
get a Bible?

906
01:10:58,450 --> 01:10:59,950
Quirt!

907
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:06,650
Oh Randy,
stop him.

908
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:08,250
With what?

909
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:10,850
Where is he going?
Has he forgotten something?

910
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,650
No.

911
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:24,650
Penny, what is wrong with thee?

912
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:27,250
Table cloths don’t belong in there.

913
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,050
Oh, I’m sorry.

914
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:10,450
Quirt!

915
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:12,950
Unsaddle my horse,
will you kid ?

916
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:14,350
Sure!

917
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:16,450
Wanna a boarder for a while?

918
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:19,250
Of course. You're always welcome
- Quirt!

919
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:20,750
Hello!

920
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:24,050
I haven’t had a decent meal
since I left here. Chocolate?

921
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:26,850
Not very good, the flour you know.

922
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:29,150
I’ll just stick around
till you get one right.

923
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:32,050
I’ll feed the chickens.
- So early, Penny?

924
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:34,550
Yes. Can you help me Quirt?

925
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:44,650
Does it take two to feed
a few chickens, mother?

926
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:49,350
At times, Thomas, at times.
Remember?

927
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:59,450
You came back?

928
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:01,650
Yes.

929
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:05,150
Why?

930
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:08,450
I don’t know exactly.

931
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,850
Why did you go away
without saying anything?

932
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:12,950
I don’t know that exactly, either.

933
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:15,750
I think it’s because
I frightened you.

934
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:18,950
I know that sounds strange
that I should frighten you, but .....

935
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:20,450
...but I mean it

936
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:23,750
You were frightened
because I was stupid.

937
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:25,850
You thought that living with me
will be tiresome ...

938
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:28,350
..and dull after a while.

939
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:30,550
Tiresome and dull because....

940
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:34,750
...all I knew, raised since a baby,
here among the farmers was our belief...

941
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:39,750
...that people love, marry, and
stay together forever after that.

942
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:44,450
I’m not such a fool not to know that
outside worldly places that people love...

943
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:48,850
...it doesn’t have to follow that they
marry and stay together forever.

944
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:50,950
I know that sometimes
they separate.

945
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:52,750
Are you ever going to run down
and let me talk ?

946
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:56,150
No, Quirt, that’s what you were afraid of,
that I tie myself around your neck ..

947
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:59,150
...and when you get tired you
couldn’t be rid of me...

948
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:02,650
and I made up my mind that if you
come back I’d tell you this.

949
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:05,150
...but whatever you want,
Quirt, you can leave...

950
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:07,550
If I go away
ye go with me.

951
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,510
If I go away,
thee go away.

952
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:26,750
I used to be an Injun fighter.

953
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:31,350
Just can't help walking up
soft on people..

954
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:34,050
Morning missy...

955
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:37,750
This young man here been doing
any traveling since I was here last?

956
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:41,550
A fellow over Castle Verde Way lost 
a big herd a few days ago.

957
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:45,750
Well, missy...
Cat got your tongue?

958
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:48,450
Why ask her?
You know I have been traveling.

959
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,850
You look at my coral
to see how my horse shaped up ..

960
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:54,350
I did just that...
You sure covered a lot of country.

961
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:57,250
It’s a right weary animal..

962
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:01,450
I just want to see if the young lady
would lie for you.

963
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:07,550
I was going to...

964
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:09,250
You have been over to Castle Verde Way?

965
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:12,550
I've been to Rimrock
and I got witnesses to prove it.

966
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:15,450
Witnesses!
For instance?

967
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:19,150
Randy McCall, Christine Taylor.

968
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:23,950
That’s what I call witnesses.
Who else?

969
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:26,750
Lila Neal, I suppose.

970
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:29,550
She’d make a good
alibi witness for you.

971
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:33,150
Randy, Christine and Lila...

972
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:35,650
...there’s three to draw to.

973
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:39,250
So Lila saw you there too, huh?

974
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:41,050
Yes.

975
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:50,850
Come here, jug head...
You dollar and a half bush jumper...

976
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,500
Well, guess I missed you again, Quirt.

977
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:02,850
...but I’m patient..

978
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:06,050
...that’s what hangs all you fellows
in the end.

979
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:08,350
...I’m patient.

980
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:19,050
Lila?

981
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:24,050
You talked about her
when you were delirious.

982
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,660
Quirt, I...

983
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:04,160
...I wish my hair was...

984
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:08,160
...golden like corn silk, like you said.

985
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:35,660
There is a sight
I never thought I’d see.

986
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,110
Quirt Evans behind a plough.

987
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:41,540
The pony walks as soft as you do.

988
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:45,890
I taught him
Oh, I figured you’d have heard him.

989
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,810
...except you were thinking too hard.

990
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:54,450
Haven’t you got some real important
business to attend to?

991
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:56,950
Some place else.
- Sure.

992
01:18:57,050 --> 01:19:00,150
But I always liked to keep track
of your whereabouts.

993
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:10,550
You know, Quirt...

994
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:14,650
...I always figured on using a
new rope in hanging you...

995
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:18,550
Kind of respected you.

996
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:21,350
You never took the best of things....

997
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:24,350
...and all your men went down
looking at you.

998
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:26,950
Go and mind your own business.

999
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:28,750
I usually do.

1000
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:34,050
It’s a shame things don’t always
turn out the way they should.

1001
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:39,950
Now that little gal... she might marry
some young fella ..

1002
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:43,250
...who would know what to
do with that plough...

1003
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:46,950
Why don’t you kick up that horse
and move on?

1004
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:50,050
Some young fella that would
raise up a lot of grain.

1005
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:55,350
...cows, sheep, kids..

1006
01:19:56,550 --> 01:20:01,450
..kind of a fella that she’d
always know where he was..

1007
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:04,050
Do I have to run you off?

1008
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:09,150
Well now I tell you. I never have
been run off no place yet.

1009
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:11,550
...where I aim to stay.

1010
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:14,850
But it just so happens
that I gotta be gone.

1011
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:22,350
No, Quirt...

1012
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:25,550
...you don’t rate a
new rope with me.

1013
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,650
Look, ah...

1014
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:54,950
...does a lot of potpourri and
non sense have to go with it?

1015
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:56,550
..I’m not going to stand
for a lot of...

1016
01:20:56,650 --> 01:20:58,650
dressing up and a batch
of jabbering people...

1017
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:01,050
...looking at me,
just because I’m getting married.

1018
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:06,350
Oh Quirt, 
come along with me.

1019
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:10,050
Well, yes or no?
- Come on.

1020
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:14,050
Picking black berries?

1021
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:17,150
Alright

1022
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:23,350
Alright.

1023
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:46,950
I think we have enough, Quirt.

1024
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:55,150
Never did like black berries...
Now I know I was right.

1025
01:21:56,050 --> 01:22:00,150
It’s too much work connected with it.
- I’ll get some more ferns.

1026
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:23,210
Look out there’s a wasp on the petunia!
- Don’t kill it.

1027
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:27,230
Well it’s alright to for you to trust
wasps and people but...

1028
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:30,750
...he might have known that I don’t trust
him and decide to take first bite.

1029
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:34,440
And incidentally that’s not petunia,
that’s a daisy.

1030
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:36,060
That’s a petunia.

1031
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:38,670
Petunias, daisies,
daisies, petunias.

1032
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:41,550
Quirt Evans.

1033
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:45,550
Oh nothing.
I just like the sound of it.

1034
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:49,050
Quirt. Where did thee ever get
such an odd name?

1035
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:52,350
Fellow who half raised me,
gave it to me.

1036
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:55,850
He found me somewhere along
a big cattle trail.

1037
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:59,650
Folks had been bushwhacked
by the Indians, I guess..

1038
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:02,950
He was a big fella.
Cattleman.

1039
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:05,650
Swung a wide loop in his younger days,
I think.

1040
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:07,150
Wide loop?

1041
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:10,450
He wasn’t too careful
whose calf he threw his rope at..

1042
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:14,450
Most of the old cattlemen
were like that.

1043
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:19,750
He raised me. Quite a guy.
His name was Walt Emerson.

1044
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:24,550
He was down in a gambling place...

1045
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:29,730
...a fellow grabbed his gun-arm just
as he drew. He was murdered.

1046
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:32,810
Stop it.

1047
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:35,380
Then what?

1048
01:23:35,730 --> 01:23:38,450
Well I just bounced around
from place to place.

1049
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:40,780
Quirt Evans.

1050
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:14,680
I don’t see any gun.
- I know him, he's got a gun alright..

1051
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:16,580
...I know him.

1052
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:21,580
Hyah!

1053
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:05,580
Hyah! Hyah!

1054
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:26,000
Hyah!

1055
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Hyah! Hyah!

1056
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,000
Hyah!

1057
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,500
[Oh shit!]

1058
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:12,900
Well, what are we waiting for?

1059
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:17,190
Nothing I guess.
Let’s find a saloon.

1060
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:25,360
You don’t have to be worry
about Penny, mother.

1061
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:28,750
Oh, I cant help worrying about it,
Johnny.

1062
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:32,920
Get that doctor,
Burn up the roads both ways.

1063
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:21,840
A drink?

1064
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:26,250
It’s amazing...

1065
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:30,080
...the various uses to which
men put alcohol.

1066
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:32,970
To each different individual

1067
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:36,730
It’s either a stimulant, depressant
or anodyne

1068
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:39,580
Just now I’m using it
as an anodyne.

1069
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:42,420
Get to the point.

1070
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:45,980
Practice of medicine...

1071
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:49,510
...is one of the most infuriating
professions known to man.

1072
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,220
It takes 30 years of experience
to teach you...

1073
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:58,730
...that in the final analysis there’s
nothing to do but stand and watch.

1074
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:06,320
If she has an elusive moment...

1075
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:09,150
...you better speak to her

1076
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,610
...I’m not trying to argue you out
of anything.

1077
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:27,220
Maybe you ought to
stop and think.

1078
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:33,910
She wouldn’t like this,
Quirt!

1079
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:38,310
...I’m not arguing for or against
her point of view.

1080
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:41,420
...I know to her, the worlds worst
tragedy would be

1081
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,440
if you should kill a man.

1082
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:46,180
Of course you could
argue logically...

1083
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:48,330
that she wouldn’t know whether
you killed him or not.

1084
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,960
I think she'd know.

1085
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:54,550
Any discussion has to have
at least two participants.

1086
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:56,800
Of course if you refuse
to answer me.

1087
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,300
Quirt!

1088
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,750
If I felt cynical....

1089
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:10,250
...this would be a good opportunity to
observe what we are about to see,

1090
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:14,150
...a perfect example of
<i>"An eye for an eye"</i> etc.

1091
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:18,350
Unfortunately I can’t quote
chapter and verse.

1092
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:21,750
...I’m too tired
to be cynical.

1093
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:32,650
Father, father,
come upstairs!

1094
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:37,150
But thee are very ill,
thee must not be moving about.

1095
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:38,750
Mother, I've got to go ...

1096
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:41,250
Thee must get back into bed.
- But he needs me.

1097
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:43,850
This is insanity. I told you
to keep her in bed

1098
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:45,650
Do you want to commit suicide?

1099
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:47,650
If you don’t stay under
those covers young lady...

1100
01:30:52,450 --> 01:30:54,150
There’s no fever.

1101
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:57,050
Thee must do what the doctor says.
- Mother, please.

1102
01:30:57,550 --> 01:30:59,450
I can’t understand it.

1103
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:02,650
I can’t understand it at all.

1104
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:05,650
There must be some logical
scientific explanation.

1105
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:08,450
I’m too old to start
believing in miracles.

1106
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:10,950
Wrap her in blankets.

1107
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:35,150
You know if the two hadn’t
had me covered...

1108
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:39,550
I would never let that Hondo Jeffries
pistol whip me...

1109
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:42,550
Wait till Quirt Evans hear about this...

1110
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:46,550
Quirt will take the starch out of
the whole caboodle of them.

1111
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,550
Why, Quirt and me once...

1112
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:52,050
...well, it was Dodge City
several years back.

1113
01:31:52,050 --> 01:31:56,150
...when the Earps and Clantons were gunning.
Well me and Quirt...

1114
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:03,750
Come here.
- Yes, Mr. Evans.

1115
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:15,950
Know Laredo Stevens?

1116
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:17,550
He’s in the Eagle,

1117
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:20,050
and that pistol whipping Hondo
is with him.

1118
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:25,050
Take him a message.

1119
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:33,550
Hey, buy the boys a drink.
- Celebrating?

1120
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:36,350
Sure,
why not?

1121
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:38,850
Don’t you get excited when you
make a big win like this?

1122
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:42,650
Why get excited... sometimes you win
and sometimes you loose.

1123
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:46,050
Don’t get excited,
gentlemen.

1124
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:57,850
I ain’t looking for trouble...

1125
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:02,050
I’m just a carrier of a message.
- Yeah? What is it?

1126
01:33:02,150 --> 01:33:04,150
He said to <i>"Come out in the street...</i>

1127
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:07,450
<i>...he's waiting for you."</i>
- Who says?

1128
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,050
Quirt Evans.

1129
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:13,050
[Hits sour note on piano]

1130
01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:19,450
What is this, a joke?
Quirt Evans is...

1131
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:22,550
Take a look out at the streets.
See, if it really is.

1132
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:29,250
Jack, take a look at the street.

1133
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:48,550
There’s a tall hombre in 
a black hat standing...

1134
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:51,050
...at the blacksmith’s shop

1135
01:33:56,150 --> 01:33:59,450
Mind if I use the back door, Pete?
- So long, Pete.

1136
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:20,550
Well, they say <i>"a cat got nine lives."</i>

1137
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:24,550
Maybe ole Quirt’s part cat.

1138
01:34:24,850 --> 01:34:27,950
He also said <i>"He was curious to know
how much whiskey it would take...</i>

1139
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:31,150
<i>"...to build up your nerve 
to come out."</i>

1140
01:34:31,350 --> 01:34:32,550
You’re fixing to get 
your ears pin back?

1141
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:34,150
There’s a better pair of ears
out in the street...

1142
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:36,250
if you wanna pin
somebody’s ears back.

1143
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:38,450
Hey, you drink this.

1144
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:42,950
Sure, if I don’t have to
stand near you.

1145
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:44,450
Come on.

1146
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:46,950
I wonder whether if that sharp
shooting Marshal is around town?

1147
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:49,450
Oh, I saw him ride out of town
an hour ago.

1148
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:54,850
That’s good, we don’t want him
around here to spoil our play.

1149
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:58,350
Yeah, I bet that’s just exactly
how you meant it.

1150
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:34,950
Look out, there’s going
to be a shooting!

1151
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:38,950
Hyah, hyah!

1152
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:30,750
Quirt!

1153
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:27,450
Quirt...

1154
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:30,450
...step away from those women.

1155
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:39,050
Why don’t you
turn around, Quirt?

1156
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:44,050
[Gun shots ring out!]

1157
01:38:04,850 --> 01:38:07,050
Nothing ever works out right.

1158
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:18,750
Had them dead to rights.
They got the Baker stage

1159
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:22,050
...so I figured out what’s the rukkas.

1160
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:25,750
You down them
and I'd hang you....

1161
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:27,650
...sort of...

1162
01:38:28,050 --> 01:38:30,950
..Sort of killing three hawks
with one stone.

1163
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:32,650
...so to speak.

1164
01:38:34,150 --> 01:38:37,450
Nothing, nothing ever works out right.

1165
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:43,250
I may have missed you again, Quirt,
but I’m patient.

1166
01:38:44,050 --> 01:38:46,550
It’s only a matter of time,
and I hang you.

1167
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:49,450
Not me,
mister.

1168
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:52,350
From now on
I’m a farmer.

1169
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:09,350
That Quirt!

1170
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:16,650
Hey Quirt might need that.

1171
01:39:17,150 --> 01:39:21,150
No, only a man that carries a gun
ever needs one.

1172
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:23,650
What are you going
to do with it?

1173
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:27,850
Hang it on the wall in my office,
with a new rope!
