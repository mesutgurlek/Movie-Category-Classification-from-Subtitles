        YEAH, I, UH, I DID.     

489
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,075
                I, UH--         

490
00:46:37,143 --> 00:46:40,746
            WELL, DAVY,         
            I JUST AIN'T GOT,   

491
00:46:40,813 --> 00:46:44,349
    YOU KNOW, YOUR WAY OF       
    PUTTING THINGS INTO WORDS,  

492
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:48,620
        BUT I GOT A FINE FAMILY.

493
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:54,810
                <i> WONDERFUL WIFE,</i>
                <i> TWO FINE BOYS.</i> 

494
00:46:56,763 --> 00:46:59,097
    I GUESS I'M WHAT YOU'D CALL 
    A LUCKY MAN.                

495
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,285
NOW THAT AIN'T A BAD STAB       
AT PUTTING IT INTO WORDS.       

496
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:08,324
    I SENT THEM UP TO COHUILA   
    WITH ALL THE TROUBLE        
    AROUND HERE.                

497
00:47:08,391 --> 00:47:10,459
        YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T WANT 
        TO GET THEM MIXED UP--  

498
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:16,131
    MAY I SPEAK PRIVATELY       
    WITH YOU, SIR ?             
WELL, SURE, BUT--               

499
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:18,133
    YOU'RE THE SENORA DE LOPEZ, 
    AREN'T YOU ?                

500
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:21,069
    SENOR BOWIE.                
    I'M SORRY, I DID NOT        
    RECOGNIZE YOU AT FIRST.     

501
00:47:21,137 --> 00:47:24,973
        THIS PLACE AIN'T FIT--  
    I KNOW, BUT THE MATTER      
    IS URGENT.                  

502
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:27,876
        COULD I HAVE            
        A FEW PRIVATE WORDS     
        WITH THIS GENTLEMAN ?   

503
00:47:27,944 --> 00:47:32,514
            SURE.  EXCUSE ME.   
            I'LL BE INSIDE,     
            CROCKETT.           

504
00:47:32,582 --> 00:47:34,916
                CROCKETT ?      

505
00:47:34,984 --> 00:47:37,386
            YOU ARE THE FAMOUS  
            DAVY CROCKETT ?     

506
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,388
WELL, I'M CROCKETT,             

507
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:44,426
AND THEY NAMED ME DAVY          
AFTER AN UNCLE THAT DIDN'T      
LEAVE PA THE FARM AFTER ALL.    

508
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,929
            WELL, MR. CROCKETT, 
            SHORTLY AFTER YOU   
            LEFT MY ROOM,       

509
00:47:47,997 --> 00:47:50,232
            I HEARD THE NOISE   
            OF AN ALTERCATION   
            IN THE STREET.      

510
00:47:50,299 --> 00:47:53,335
        I COULD HEAR THE SOUND, 
        THOUGH I COULD NOT SEE  
        FROM MY WINDOW.         

511
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:56,137
        IT SOUNDED LIKE--       
        LIKE A DRUNKEN BRAWL.   

512
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:58,841
I WAS SITTING RIGHT HERE.       
 I DIDN'T HEAR A THING.         

513
00:47:58,908 --> 00:48:04,262
    ANYWAY, I SAW LIGHTS        
    IN THE OLD CHURCH           
    AND PEOPLE MOVING ABOUT...  

514
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:07,966
    AND ONE OF THEM WAS EMIL,   
     AND A THOUGHT CAME TO ME.  

515
00:48:08,134 --> 00:48:10,619
                AS YOU MAY KNOW,
                COLONEL TRAVIS  
                HAS ORDERED...  

516
00:48:10,686 --> 00:48:14,156
            ALL POWDER AND BALL 
            FROM THE MERCHANTS  
            OF BEXAR.           

517
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:18,560
        AND HE DIDN'T FIND ANY  
        AT EMIL'S WAREHOUSE.    

518
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:24,149
        IT'S MY OPINION IT'S ALL
        HIDDEN IN THE BASEMENT  
        OF THAT CHURCH.         

519
00:48:24,216 --> 00:48:28,320
    AND, MR. CROCKETT,          
    THE DEFENDERS OF TEXAS...   

520
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:31,323
            ARE GOING TO NEED   
            THAT POWDER AGAINST 
            SANTA ANNA.         

521
00:48:31,391 --> 00:48:35,126
AND YOU'RE AGAINST              
SANTA ANNA ?                    
            BITTERLY, OF COURSE.

522
00:48:35,194 --> 00:48:39,398
AND THIS EMIL,                  
HE'S FOR HIM ?                  
                YES, HE IS.     

523
00:48:39,832 --> 00:48:42,684
THEN HOW DID HE FIGURE          
YOU'D MARRY HIM ?               

524
00:48:42,752 --> 00:48:45,086
POLITICAL ARGUMENTS             
DON'T FLAVOR FOLKS' SUPPER.     

525
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:49,908
    NEVERTHELESS, I AM GOING    
    TO MARRY HIM.  LET'S NOT    
    DISCUSS IT, MR. CROCKETT.   

526
00:48:49,976 --> 00:48:53,511
THE NAME IS DAVY,

THINKING OF YOU--               

527
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:56,447
        WILL YOU SAY GOOD-BYE   
        FOR ME TO MR. BOWIE ?   
WELL, I--                       

528
00:48:56,515 --> 00:49:00,518
    I CAN MAKE MY OWN WAY,      
    AND I HOPE THE INFORMATION  
    IS HELPFUL.                 

529
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:22,741
    SOMETHING INTERESTING, JIM.

        IN THE STREET.

    WHERE ARE WE GOING ?        
TO CHURCH.                      

532

HALT !                          
WHO GOES THERE ?                

581
00:55:25,004 --> 00:55:28,573
- [ Bowie ]                     
  IS THAT YOU, BOB ?            
- WHY, SURE.  CAN'T YOU SEE ?   

582
00:55:28,641 --> 00:55:33,178
        THEN WHAT KIND OF       
        IDIOT NONSENSE IS THIS  
        "WHO GOES THERE" ?      

583
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:37,115
WELL, TRAVIS--                  
COLONEL TRAVIS, THAT IS--       
HE SAYS THAT I SHOULD--         

584
00:55:37,183 --> 00:55:44,906
<i>I DON'T CARE WHAT TRAVIS SAID.</i>  
<i>OPEN THE GATE 'FORE I SHOOT YOU</i> 
<i>OFF THAT WALL.</i>                  

585
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:49,710
        SENTRY, OPEN THE GATE   
        FOR COLONEL BOWIE.      

586
00:56:02,174 --> 00:56:05,076
[ Bowie ]                       
NEAR A TON OF GUNPOWDER HERE,   
MEN.  GET IT UNLOADED.          

587
00:56:05,143 --> 00:56:09,747
    THAT LONG ONE THERE,        
    HE'S DAVY CROCKETT,         
    AND THREE OF HIS GOOD MEN.  

588
00:56:09,815 --> 00:56:12,983
    - COLONEL CROCKETT.         
    - HELLO, TRAVIS.            

589
00:56:14,453 --> 00:56:17,154
LOOKS LIKE THE ANSWER           
TO A PRAYER.                    

590
00:56:17,221 --> 00:56:20,858
COLONEL, I'D BE PLEASED         
IF YOU'D JOIN ME IN MY QUARTERS 
FOR SOME REFRESHMENT.           

591
00:56:20,926 --> 00:56:23,828
                    PROUD TO.   

592
00:56:23,895 --> 00:56:26,430
OH, AND YOU TOO,                
COLONEL BOWIE, IF YOU WILL.     

593
00:56:38,426 --> 00:56:41,195
        I'M A STRANGER          
        AROUND THESE HERE PARTS.

594
00:56:41,262 --> 00:56:44,664
        WHAT DO YOU TEXICANS USE
        FOR DRINKING WHISKEY ?  

595
00:56:44,733 --> 00:56:48,068
DRINKING WHISKEY ?              
                YOU GOT MANNERS,
                OR AIN'T YA ?   

596
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:53,874
CAPTAIN DICKINSON,              
THIS IS COLONEL DAVY CROCKETT.  

597
00:56:53,942 --> 00:56:56,243
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.            
                HOW DO YOU DO ? 
                GOOD MORNING.   

598
00:56:56,310 --> 00:57:00,498
OH, AND THIS IS MY COUSIN,      
MRS. DICKINSON.                 
COLONEL CROCKETT.               

599
00:57:00,565 --> 00:57:02,700
COLONEL BOWIE.                  
                    HELLO, SUE. 

600
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:07,204
IT'S NICE MEETING YOU,          
DAVY CROCKETT.                  
I FEEL AS IF I KNOW YOU ALREADY.

601
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:10,440
YOU SEE, PART OF MY FAMILY      
COME FROM TENNESSEE,            

602
00:57:10,509 --> 00:57:14,044
AND YOUR NAME IS                
A HOUSEHOLD WORD THERE,         
AT LEAST IN OUR HOUSE IT WAS.   

603
00:57:14,112 --> 00:57:18,148
THANK YOU, MA'AM.               
IT'S NICE TO BE WELL THOUGHT OF.

604
00:57:18,216 --> 00:57:21,351
            MOMMY.              
OH, YES, DARLING.               

605
00:57:21,419 --> 00:57:25,222
OH, I'VE ASKED YOU NOT          
TO CLIMB THOSE STAIRS ALONE.    

606
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:28,325
                    WHO'S THIS ?
CAN YOU SAY HELLO               
TO COLONEL CROCKETT ?           

607
00:57:28,393 --> 00:57:30,761
        HELLO.                  
                [ Chuckles ]    

608
00:57:30,829 --> 00:57:33,764
EVERY SIZE THEY GET TO          
SEEMS TO BE THE MOST LOVEABLE.  

609
00:57:33,832 --> 00:57:36,567
WILL YOU GENTLEMEN EXCUSE ME ?  

610
00:57:37,736 --> 00:57:42,006
    GOOD-BYE, COLONEL.          
                GOOD-BYE.       

611
00:57:42,073 --> 00:57:45,976
KIND OF A SHAME KIDS            
HAVE TO GROW UP INTO PEOPLE.    

612
00:57:46,044 --> 00:57:49,179
    IT'S GOOD WE'RE ALL HERE,   
    GENTLEMEN.  CIGAR ?         

613
00:57:51,816 --> 00:57:56,620
    PLEASE,                     
    MAKE YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE.
    I HAVE SOME NEWS.           

614
00:57:56,688 --> 00:57:59,156
            FANNIN IS DOING WELL
            AT GOLIAD.          

615
00:57:59,223 --> 00:58:01,491
        HE HAS MUSTERED         
        ALMOST A THOUSAND MEN...

616
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,261
        AND SHOULD BE READY     
        TO MOVE SOUTH BY        
        THE FIRST OF THE WEEK.  

617
00:58:04,328 --> 00:58:07,831
        A THOUSAND ?            
        IT DON'T SEEM POSSIBLE. 

618
00:58:07,899 --> 00:58:10,701
    IT DOES SOUND TOO GOOD      
    TO BE TRUE, I MUST CONFESS. 

619
00:58:10,769 --> 00:58:13,236
    BUT WE CAN ONLY ADMIT       
    OUR DOUBTS TO EACH OTHER... 

620
00:58:13,304 --> 00:58:15,706
    IN THE PRIVACY OF A ROOM,   
    AND NOT IN FRONT OF THE MEN.

621
00:58:15,774 --> 00:58:17,808
    AS FAR AS THE VOLUNTEERS    
    ARE CONCERNED,              

622
00:58:17,876 --> 00:58:19,977
    WE'LL BE SURE THAT FANNIN   
    HAS A THOUSAND MEN OR MORE. 

623
00:58:20,045 --> 00:58:23,614
            I GOT A REPUTATION  
            FOR TRUTH, TRAVIS.  
    I AIN'T.                    

624
00:58:23,682 --> 00:58:27,284
EVERYBODY SAYS I'M A BORN LIAR. 

625
00:58:27,351 --> 00:58:31,956
BUT WHETHER WE TALK OUT LOUD    
OR QUIET DON'T SEEM TO ME       
THE POINT RIGHT NOW.            

626
00:58:32,023 --> 00:58:36,259
THE POINT IS,                   
HOW MANY MEN HAS FANNIN         
AND WILL HE GET HERE IN TIME ?  

627
00:58:36,327 --> 00:58:41,065
    WHETHER HE DOES OR DOESN'T  
    WE'LL BE TRAPPED HERE,      
    AND FOR NO REASON.          

628
00:58:41,132 --> 00:58:43,634
    WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS        
    BURN ALL OF BEXAR, INCLUDING
    THIS MISSION, AND FIGHT--   

629
00:58:43,702 --> 00:58:45,569
AND FIGHT                       
A HARASSING ACTION ?            

630
00:58:45,637 --> 00:58:48,338
ANNOY SANTA ANNA                
WHILE HE SWEEPS NORTH           
ACROSS THE WHOLE OF TEXAS ?     

631
00:58:48,406 --> 00:58:52,242
THAT'S COLONEL BOWIE'S THEORY.  
I CANNOT ENTERTAIN THE IDEA.    
        WE COULD HIT AND RUN--  

632
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:54,244
YOU SEEM TO FORGET              
ONE THING, COLONEL BOWIE.       
                        WHAT ?  

633
00:58:54,312 --> 00:58:58,215
THAT I COMMAND,                 
AND I HAVE ALREADY DECIDED      
AGAINST YOUR PLAN.              

634
00:59:02,087 --> 00:59:06,991
NOW, LET US ATTACK              
A MORE IMPORTANT PROBLEM.       

635
00:59:07,058 --> 00:59:10,995
COLONEL CROCKETT'S TENNESSEANS--
WILL THEY FIGHT, COLONEL ?      

636
00:59:11,062 --> 00:59:12,997
UP TO THE LAST TIME I SAW THEM, 

637
00:59:13,064 --> 00:59:15,532
THEY HADN'T SHOWN ANY STRONG    
FEELINGS AGAINST FIGHTING.      

638
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,835
BUT CAN YOU PERSUADE YOUR MEN   
TO COME INTO THIS MISSION ?     

639
00:59:17,902 --> 00:59:19,803
I CAN ASK THEM.                 

640
00:59:19,871 --> 00:59:24,508
AND YOU'RE                      
A VERY PERSUASIVE MAN,          
ACCORDING TO YOUR REPUTATION.   

641
00:59:24,575 --> 00:59:28,646
BUILD UP THE STORY THAT         
FANNIN HAS 1,000--              
NO, 2,000 MEN.                  

642
00:59:28,713 --> 00:59:31,015
PLAY DOWN THE SIZE              
OF SANTA ANNA'S ARMY AND--      
                HOLD IT, TRAVIS.

643
00:59:31,082 --> 00:59:34,652
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.        
HE WANTS ME TO LIE TO MY MEN,   
KEEP 'EM HERE WITH LIES.        

644
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:37,220
LET THE TRUTH OF                
SANTA ANNA'S STRENGTH BE KNOWN  
DOWN THERE IN THE YARDS,        

645
00:59:37,288 --> 00:59:39,389
AND BY DAYBREAK THERE WON'T BE  
A BAKER'S DOZEN LEFT.           

646
00:59:39,457 --> 00:59:43,027
YOU CALLING MY BOYS COWARDS ?   
LET US DISPENSE WITH            
FIRE-EATERS' PYROTECHNICS !     

647
00:59:43,094 --> 00:59:45,663
    JUST REMEMBER THIS, TRAVIS. 
    MY MEN ARE ALL VOLUNTEERS.  

648
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:47,665
            THEY'RE HERE BECAUSE
            THEY WANT TO BE.    

649
00:59:47,732 --> 00:59:50,467
    BUT THERE'S NOTHING         
    TO KEEP 'EM FROM PACKING UP 
    AND GETTING OUTTA HERE.     

650
00:59:53,705 --> 00:59:56,406
<i>[ Travis ]</i>                      
<i>I'M AWARE THAT</i>                  
<i>YOUR MEN ARE MILITIA,</i>           

651
00:59:56,474 --> 00:59:59,342
        AND LIKE ALL VOLUNTEERS 
        UNDISCIPLINED.          

652
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:01,411
        GOOD DAY, COLONEL BOWIE.

653
01:00:09,688 --> 01:00:14,357
    LAST NIGHT GAVE YOU         
    A PRETTY GOOD IDEA          
    OF THE DISCIPLINE OF MY MEN.

654
01:00:16,194 --> 01:00:18,696
        OUR POSITION HERE       
        IS DESPERATE.           

655
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:25,169
    AND I FEEL SURE THAT        
    WHERE CROCKETT LEADS,       
    HIS MEN WILL FOLLOW.        

656
01:00:26,171 --> 01:00:28,205
                        YEAH.   

657
01:00:28,272 --> 01:00:33,276
THAT'S A RESPONSIBILITY         
 THAT'S BEEN KINDA WORRYING ME. 

658
01:00:37,782 --> 01:00:40,551
        THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.   
        I'M GONNA PASS          
        THE WORD AROUND...      

659
01:00:40,618 --> 01:00:44,938
    WHAT YOU TEXANS USE         
    FOR DRINKING WHISKEY        
    IS DRINKING WHISKEY.        

660
01:00:45,006 --> 01:00:49,410
AND WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT,      
YOU GOT REAL GOOD MANNERS,      

661
01:00:49,477 --> 01:00:53,447
SEEING HOW YOU SUFFER           
THE HANDICAP OF HAVING          
NEVER BEEN IN TENNESSEE.

    YOU FOUGHT A FOUR-DAY FIGHT 
    WITH MIKE FINK ?            

664
01:00:59,103 --> 01:01:02,238
    WHY, THAT'S A BLASTED LIE,

        ONE OF THEM STORIES

    WE'RE GONNA STAY, AIN'T WE ?

733
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:33,343
WELL, I'M THINKING IT OVER.

        TO THINK ABOUT ?

AND I'LL MEET UP WITH YOU LATER.

743
01:06:01,973 --> 01:06:04,674

745
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,081
    IT KINDA CHEERS ME TO SEE   
    THE COLONEL WITH THAT LADY. 

746
01:06:12,149 --> 01:06:15,385
    THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS    
    HE HAD ME WORRIED.          

747
01:06:15,452 --> 01:06:19,188
LATELY, HE AIN'T BEEN LOOKING AT
THE GIRLS LIKE HE WAS STARVED.  

748
01:06:19,256 --> 01:06:22,258
BEING IN CONGRESS               
HAS RUINED MANY A GOOD MAN.     

749
01:06:31,618 --> 01:06:34,554

751
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:38,891
        CROCKETT, THE BRAWLER.  

752
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,494
            CROCKETT HAS BRAINS.

753
01:06:41,562 --> 01:06:44,164
KEPT IT HIDDEN                  
A NUMBER OF YEARS.              

754
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:47,400
YOU LIKE MY TENNESSEANS,        
FLACA ?                         
                    OH, YES.    

755
01:06:47,468 --> 01:06:51,471
COULD STRAIN 10,000 AND NEVER   
COME UP WITH 23 BETTER.         

756
01:06:51,538 --> 01:06:53,940
EVERY ONE OF THOSE MEN          
HAS BEEN AT MY ELBOW,           

757
01:06:54,008 --> 01:06:58,878
SAVE THE BOY SMITTY,            
WHEN SOME DIFFICULTY AROSE.     

758
01:06:58,946 --> 01:07:04,184
SOME OF THEM DON'T BATHE        
AS OFTEN AS POLITE FOLKS        
WOULD THINK NECESSARY,          

759
01:07:04,251 --> 01:07:06,752
BUT EVERY ONE OF THEM           
SMELLS SWEET TO ME.             

760
01:07:08,655 --> 01:07:13,393
AND I WAS THE ONE               
THAT SAID THIS COUNTRY          
WAS BURNT-OVER SAND.            

761
01:07:13,461 --> 01:07:16,729
IT'S GREEN AND GROWING,         

762
01:07:16,797 --> 01:07:19,799
LIKE THOSE GREEN PASTURES       
THEY TALK ABOUT.                

763
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:26,606
LORD ABOVE,                     
THAT'S ONE BEAUTIFUL TREE.      

764
01:07:49,913 --> 01:07:53,450
        THIS TREE MUST'VE       
        BEEN GROWED BEFORE...   

765
01:07:53,518 --> 01:07:57,687
    MAN PUT HIS FIRST DIRTY     
    FOOTPRINTS ON THIS PRAIRIE. 

766
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,876
KIND OF A TREE ADAM AND EVE     
MUST'VE MET UNDER.              

767
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:15,054
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, FLACA ?     

768
01:08:15,122 --> 01:08:17,356
I GUESS I SAW                   
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY TREES...     

769
01:08:17,425 --> 01:08:20,927
BEFORE I EVER TOOK              
A LONG THOUGHTFUL LOOK AT ONE.  

770
01:08:20,994 --> 01:08:25,532
MOSTLY I LOOKED AT A TREE       
TO SEE WAS THERE A BEAR IN IT   
OR AN INDIAN BEHIND IT.         

771
01:08:28,001 --> 01:08:31,704
        DAVY, WHAT'S GOING      
        TO HAPPEN TO US ?       

772
01:08:31,772 --> 01:08:34,407
        I MEAN, TO YOU AND ME ? 

773
01:08:34,475 --> 01:08:38,545
I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING,   
FLACA, AND I WANT YOU           
TO LISTEN TIGHT.                

774
01:08:38,612 --> 01:08:42,114
IT MAY SOUND LIKE I'M TALKING   
ABOUT ME, BUT I'M NOT.          
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU.          

775
01:08:42,182 --> 01:08:45,251
AS A MATTER OF FACT,            
I'M TALKING ABOUT               
ALL PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.          

776
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:49,355
<i>WHEN I COME DOWN HERE TO TEXAS,</i> 
<i>I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.</i>    

777
01:08:49,423 --> 01:08:51,357
<i>I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT.</i>             

778
01:08:51,425 --> 01:08:55,194
IT SEEMS LIKE                   
YOU ADDED UP MY LIFE,           
AND I'D SPENT IT ALL...         

779
01:08:55,262 --> 01:09:00,467
EITHER STOMPING OTHER MEN OR,   
IN SOME CASES, GETTIN' STOMPED. 

780
01:09:00,534 --> 01:09:04,203
HAD ME SOME MONEY               
AND HAD ME SOME MEDALS,         

781
01:09:04,271 --> 01:09:08,307
BUT NONE OF IT SEEMED           
A LIFETIME WORTH THE PAIN       
OF THE MOTHER THAT BORE ME.     

782
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:12,244
IT WAS LIKE I WAS EMPTY.        
WELL, I'M NOT EMPTY ANYMORE.    

783
01:09:12,312 --> 01:09:14,881
<i>THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT--</i>       

784
01:09:14,949 --> 01:09:17,249
<i>TO FEEL USEFUL</i>                  
<i>IN THIS OLD WORLD;</i>              

785
01:09:17,317 --> 01:09:21,588
TO HIT A LICK AGAINST           
WHAT'S WRONG OR TO SAY          
A WORD FOR WHAT'S RIGHT,        

786
01:09:21,655 --> 01:09:25,458
EVEN THOUGH YOU GET WALLOPED    
FOR SAYING THAT WORD.           

787
01:09:25,526 --> 01:09:27,494
NOW, I MAY SOUND                
LIKE A BIBLE BEATER...          

788
01:09:27,561 --> 01:09:30,597
YELLING UP A REVIVAL AT         
A RIVER-CROSSING CAMP MEETING,  

789
01:09:30,664 --> 01:09:32,832
BUT THAT DON'T CHANGE           
THE TRUTH NONE.                 

790
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:36,469
THERE'S RIGHT AND THERE'S WRONG.
YOU GOT TO DO ONE OR THE OTHER. 

791
01:09:36,537 --> 01:09:38,771
YOU DO THE ONE                  
AND YOU'RE LIVING.              

792
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:40,807
YOU DO THE OTHER                
AND YOU MAY BE WALKING AROUND,  

793
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:43,175
BUT YOU'RE DEAD                 
AS A BEAVER HAT.                

794
01:09:47,481 --> 01:09:49,616
<i>I'D HOPED FOR A HORSE,</i>          

795
01:09:49,683 --> 01:09:52,218
<i>BUT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG</i>       
<i>WITH A GOOD STRONG MULE.</i>        

796
01:09:53,387 --> 01:09:55,622
                    MY THINGS.  

797
01:09:55,689 --> 01:09:58,057
                ALL MY LUGGAGE  
                IS IN THE BUGGY.

798
01:09:58,125 --> 01:10:00,493
HAD MY MEN TAKE CARE OF IT.     

799
01:10:00,561 --> 01:10:04,898
YOUR GEWGAWS                    
MAY BE ROUGH-PACKED,            
BUT THEY'RE ALL THERE.          

800
01:10:09,803 --> 01:10:11,804
        YOU ARE SENDING ME AWAY.
         YOU--                  

801
01:10:13,741 --> 01:10:17,544
    YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FIGHT  
    AGAINST EVIL, BUT YOU--     

802
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:20,931
            YOU ARE SENDING ME  
            TO SAFETY.          

803
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:24,901
FLACA, YOU HAVE                 
AN IMPORTANT NAME.              

804
01:10:24,969 --> 01:10:28,538
YOU KNOW A MILLION WORDS        
AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE USED.    

805
01:10:28,605 --> 01:10:32,943
I'M SENDING YOU                 
TO FIGHT YOUR WAR,              
TO TALK UP A HOWLING MOB.       

806
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:35,511
I'LL STAY HERE                  
AND HIT A LICK.                 

807
01:10:37,315 --> 01:10:39,882
I HOPE YOU CAN DRIVE A MULE.    

808
01:10:39,951 --> 01:10:42,152
    HIS NAME'S JESUS,           
    THEY TOLD ME.               

809
01:10:42,219 --> 01:10:45,221
HE SEEMS A GOOD, HONEST MULE.   

810
01:10:52,045 --> 01:10:55,047
                MAYBE I'LL NEVER
                SEE YOU AGAIN.  

811
01:10:55,115 --> 01:10:57,883
IF THAT'S WHAT'S WRITTEN,       
THAT'S WHAT'S WRITTEN.          

812
01:10:57,951 --> 01:11:00,320
WHEN IT'S TIME, IT'S TIME.      

813
01:11:00,387 --> 01:11:03,089
TALKING ONLY MAKES IT           
THE HARDER, FLACA,              

814
01:11:03,156 --> 01:11:05,491
SO STIR UP THAT MULE.           

815
01:11:05,559 --> 01:11:07,560
                    DAVY, I--   

816
01:11:21,258 --> 01:11:23,760
YOU NEVER PRAY,                 
DO YOU, DAVY ?                  

817
01:11:27,732 --> 01:11:29,899
        I NEVER FOUND THE TIME. 

818
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,595
SIR, TENNESSEANS.               

819
01:12:04,418 --> 01:12:08,688
COLONEL TRAVIS.                 
CROCKETT AND HIS MEN.           

820
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:16,395
GO DOWN AND OPEN THE GATE.      
        I'LL JUST HOLLER DOWN.  

821
01:12:16,463 --> 01:12:19,933
YOUR ORDERS WERE TO GO DOWN,    
NOT HOLLER DOWN, MR. DENNISON.  

822
01:12:20,001 --> 01:12:22,002
YES, SIR.                       

823
01:12:37,551 --> 01:12:40,419
    CRACK SHOTS,                
    THOSE TENNESSEANS.          

824
01:12:40,487 --> 01:12:43,657
    TWENTY TIMES THEIR NUMBER   
    IS WHAT WE NEED, AND MORE.  

825
01:12:43,724 --> 01:12:48,662
        OH, I'M SORRY, WILL.    
        SUCH GLOOMY REMARKS     
        ARE FOR YOUR EARS ALONE.

826
01:12:48,729 --> 01:12:50,964
ISN'T THAT BOWIE GALLOPING      
UP THERE TO CATCH THEM ?        

827
01:12:56,003 --> 01:12:59,722
I CAN JUST HEAR HIM             
PLEADING HIS CAUSE.             

828
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:02,225
        CROCKETT SEEMS TO ME    
        THE TYPE OF MAN         
        THAT WOULD CHOOSE BOWIE.

829
01:13:02,292 --> 01:13:05,294
WHAT YOU MEAN IS CROCKETT ISN'T 
THE TYPE OF MAN TO CHOOSE ME.   

830
01:13:05,362 --> 01:13:08,464
        OH, WILL,               
        DEPEND ON YOU TO SAY IT 
        THE MOST BRUTAL WAY.    

831
01:13:08,532 --> 01:13:11,033
MOST FACTS ARE BRUTAL.          

832
01:13:15,705 --> 01:13:18,941
JUST LOOK AT                    
THAT GREAT KNIFE-FIGHTER        
YAPPING AT CROCKETT.            

833

    BETWEEN HERE AND THE NORTH. 

838
01:13:32,573 --> 01:13:34,674
SOUNDS REASONABLE               
THE WAY YOU PUT IT, JIM,        

839
01:13:34,742 --> 01:13:37,510

HE'S GOT A POINT TOO.
