1424
01:21:58,985 --> 01:22:01,020
Well, I figure
if Stanton stables

1425
01:22:01,021 --> 01:22:02,021
don't complain,

1426
01:22:02,022 --> 01:22:03,122
no one else will.

1427
01:22:03,123 --> 01:22:05,724
Sonny might
if he figures it out.

1428
01:22:05,725 --> 01:22:06,792
I have it
on good authority

1429
01:22:06,793 --> 01:22:08,193
that Sonny won
a large chunk of cash

1430
01:22:08,194 --> 01:22:09,361
on yesterday's race.

1431
01:22:09,362 --> 01:22:11,730
I'm pretty sure
he won't want his bookie

1432
01:22:11,731 --> 01:22:13,832
to find out
it was a fix.

Earl just got out
of the coma.

1437
01:22:22,509 --> 01:22:24,476
He's not gonna like
what he's coming home to.

1438
01:22:24,477 --> 01:22:27,346
Isn't Earl used to Sonny
fucking up by now?

You're the winner.

No need to second-guess yourself
on that.

1444
01:23:18,198 --> 01:23:24,436
I'll give you 50 grand
for that tractor.

1445
01:23:24,437 --> 01:23:26,672
You think too much.

Take the "for sale" sign
down.

1447
01:23:28,808 --> 01:23:34,179
Sonny hasn't got enough money
to build a mini putt.

1448
01:23:37,717 --> 01:23:42,187
You and Mr. Culpepper
are going to Texas?

1449
01:23:44,491 --> 01:23:47,960
Yeah, probably a good idea
for us to clear out.

1450
01:23:47,961 --> 01:23:49,695
It wasn't exactly
the perfect crime we pulled.

Funny thing,

1453
01:23:58,104 --> 01:23:59,772
Pete's old gelding
won the Stanton Stakes

1454
01:23:59,773 --> 01:24:01,106
at Fort Erie the other day.

1455
01:24:01,107 --> 01:24:02,274
You don't say.

1456
01:24:02,275 --> 01:24:05,844
Yeah, made enough money
to pay off his taxes

1457
01:24:05,845 --> 01:24:09,081
and a few other bills.

1458
01:24:09,082 --> 01:24:10,616

after the place

1459
01:24:10,617 --> 01:24:12,751
for the time being.

1460

Paulie's gonna help out.

1461
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:19,758
And what about
your tractor?

1462
01:24:19,759 --> 01:24:22,227
I was thinking
you'd hold on to it for me.

1463
01:24:26,066 --> 01:24:27,266
That mean
you're coming back?

1464
01:24:27,267 --> 01:24:29,501
I was thinking I might

1465
01:24:29,502 --> 01:24:32,938
when things cool off.

1466
01:24:32,939 --> 01:24:34,740
What makes you think
things are gonna cool off?

1467
01:25:04,871 --> 01:25:07,272
Do what you have to do.

1468
01:25:07,273 --> 01:25:08,273
Just don't take too long
doing it.

hey, Billy.

1471
01:26:02,429 --> 01:26:05,097
I woke up this morning
and remembered,

1472
01:26:05,098 --> 01:26:07,733
"damn, I owe you 100 grand."

1473
01:26:07,734 --> 01:26:12,638
But I got this ticket here
that says you owe me 100 grand.

1474
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:16,642
So I guess
that makes us even, Billy.

1475
01:26:16,643 --> 01:26:18,544
I heard a rumor
you got the Flash back.

01:26:18,545 --> 01:26:20,646
Oh, he's back.

1477
01:26:20,647 --> 01:26:22,548
None the worse for wear,
according to Jackson.

1478
01:26:26,686 --> 01:26:28,554
That's what I was curious about,
Sonny...

1479
01:26:31,257 --> 01:26:33,792
when you got him back.

1480
01:26:33,793 --> 01:26:36,562
