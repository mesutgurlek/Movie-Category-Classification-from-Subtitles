So Mister President, should we advise

990
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:14,212
the Texans to relieve
General Houston of Command?

991
01:02:14,744 --> 01:02:16,310
As long as I've lived,

992
01:02:16,413 --> 01:02:18,646
I've been a keen judge of horse flesh.

993
01:02:18,748 --> 01:02:21,533
What clenches it for me is
just staring in the horse's eyes

994
01:02:21,618 --> 01:02:24,586
and letting him tell me who he is.

995
01:02:24,671 --> 01:02:26,821
I first looked into Sam Houston's eyes

996
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:29,424
at the Battle of Horseshoe.

997
01:02:29,509 --> 01:02:31,676
He was 19 years old...

998

first on the line, first on the assault,

999
01:02:35,499 --> 01:02:38,233
first to be marked for death.

1000
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,835
I did not propose to understand him,

1001
01:02:40,937 --> 01:02:44,239
but if there's a way to defeat Santa Anna,

1002
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:47,942
the only man capable of
doing so is Sam Houston,

1003
01:02:48,144 --> 01:02:50,645
except for me, of course.

1004

1013
01:03:25,398 --> 01:03:28,349
he's let every Texian know
that to surrender means death.

1014
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:33,821
Don't run from him no more.

he can feel your breath.
