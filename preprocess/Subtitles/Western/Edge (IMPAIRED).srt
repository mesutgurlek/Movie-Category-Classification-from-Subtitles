00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:43,236

any out-of-towners.

337

Things get ugly.

[whispers]: That's where we step in.

339
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:52,095
You should go handle that.

340
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:55,870
- It don't look ugly to me.
- Not yet.

[lively chatter and laughter]

342
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:08,855
The lady is spoken for.

343
00:19:10,553 --> 00:19:12,539
Okay, then.

344
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:19,055
[indistinct chatter]

345
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:20,924
You sure you weren't a little hard on 'em?

346
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,491
They'll get over it.

347
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:24,286
No touch.

348
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:26,695
You're the prettiest thing I've ever seen.

Excuse me.

353
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:46,049
Maybe I wasn't clear.

354
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:48,151
I said the woman ain't interested.

355
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:51,587
MAN [laughing]: That so? Let's ask her.

356
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:53,819
What do you say, Mex?

357
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:57,260
Let's take this outside.

358
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:59,056
- Let's take it here!

Just to let you fellas know.

There's certain nomenclature
that I take umbrage at

00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:19,729
on account of my pa being Mexican.

Hey. Oh, hey, hey, take it easy.

- [whimpering]
- Take it easy.

Oh, no. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

384
00:21:39,362 --> 00:21:42,346
- Mr. Edge?
- Now listen, Benny.

385
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:43,928
I figured

386
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:46,565
that it's time that we have
us a little chat about...

387
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:47,865
about Little Bill.

388
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:51,217
I... I done... I done
fixed up your horses, uh...

389
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:54,149
You know the picture
that you made the lady?

390
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,482
Now, you did a swell job with the scar,

391
00:21:56,512 --> 00:21:58,801
ran east-west across
Little Bill's chin, right?

392
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:01,004
Now, see, the only problem is,

393
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:04,211
is that I was there when he got that scar.

394

Battle of Manassas.

395

And I don't recall seeing you there.

- [whimpering]
- Now, Benny,

397
00:22:11,294 --> 00:22:14,143
that sketch is two days old.

398
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,353
I'm gonna ask you again.

399
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:18,289
Where is he?

00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:21,237
[whimpering]

401
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:24,024

Oh, Lordy.

405
00:23:10,774 --> 00:23:12,284
You know, uh,

406
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,542
I've seen flimsier locks at Camp Sumter.

BIG BILL: Evening, Sergeant Hedges.

409
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:22,465
Now, I'd set that thing
on the ground right now.

410
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,105
Go on.

411
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:28,811
There you go.

412
00:23:29,013 --> 00:23:31,474
Now, you and I both know why you're here.

413
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:35,611
My son sent me a wire, said
you might come looking for him.

414
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:38,080
Well, unfortunately, he ain't here.

415
00:23:38,657 --> 00:23:40,456
But...

416
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:42,406
as you can see,

417
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,621
his pretty little wife is.

418
00:23:46,021 --> 00:23:47,362
Now,

419
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:51,833
I tell you what, it'd
be well worth your while.

420
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:53,964
What do you say?

421
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,611
I'll just sit over there and watch,

422
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:57,648
if it's all the same to you.

423
00:23:57,656 --> 00:23:59,335
[laughs]

424
00:23:59,402 --> 00:24:01,370
You do this for all your deputies?

425
00:24:01,437 --> 00:24:03,687
No. Just the ones I like.

426
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:06,772
No, it's a peace offering.

427
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,065
Not my style.

428
00:24:11,314 --> 00:24:13,034
Now, you see,

429
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:15,548
there's gratitude for you.

430
00:24:16,017 --> 00:24:18,567
I gave you a damn job today.

431
00:24:18,603 --> 00:24:20,723
I could've put three rounds in your heart.

432
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,460
Well, your generosity
knows no rounds, I get it.

Pilar. [blows]

434
00:24:27,286 --> 00:24:28,464
Go on.

435
00:24:30,312 --> 00:24:31,467
Come on.

436
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:42,578
See that?

437
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:45,864
Bootlips done that, Negroes.

438
00:24:46,688 --> 00:24:48,306
When they weren't hiding in the cellar,

439
00:24:48,313 --> 00:24:49,967
they was up here painting.

440
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:52,719
Painting and painting.

441
00:24:54,056 --> 00:24:55,753
Pilar...

442
00:24:56,612 --> 00:24:59,495
every day she lights a candle for 'em.

443
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:02,883
And every night I snuff it out.

444
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:06,509
Her way of being rebellious, I suppose.

445
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:09,759
Something special about you, son.

446
00:25:11,474 --> 00:25:13,342
Most folks are evil.

447
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:15,077
You're evil,

448
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:17,145
but you got principles. I like that.

449
00:25:17,157 --> 00:25:20,711
When that yap of yours is in
danger of making a point, wake me.

450
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:26,968
I'm coming up on something, Hedges.

451
00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:29,892
I'll be moving some precious cargo.

452
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:33,674
- You want a hired gun?
- A bodyguard, more like it.

453
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:36,031
And what I'm saying...

454
00:25:36,428 --> 00:25:39,515
If you can find it in your
heart to forgive my son

455
00:25:39,543 --> 00:25:41,828
for whatever the hell he done to you,

456
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:44,085
I could use a man like you.

Who the hell fired those shots?!

460
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:57,085
WOMAN: They came from back
at the livery, Sheriff!

461
00:25:57,152 --> 00:25:59,355
Son of a bitch.

462
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:04,527
[quietly]: Shh. It was
Benny who fired the shots.

463
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,288
I asked him to, so we can talk

464
00:26:06,408 --> 00:26:08,256
without Bill knowing.

465
00:26:10,613 --> 00:26:12,234
You...

466
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:13,969
you have to help me.

467
00:26:14,036 --> 00:26:16,337
- Help you what?
- Get away from here.

468
00:26:16,457 --> 00:26:18,112
- Away from him.
- Lady, look,

469
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,043
no offense, but I came
here to kill your husband.

470
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,191
So whatever you got going
on between you and Papa Bill,

471
00:26:24,212 --> 00:26:25,780
- whatever it is,
- Please, señor...

472
00:26:25,843 --> 00:26:26,930
forget it.

473
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,131
Even if it's about gold, tarado?

474
00:26:32,252 --> 00:26:34,423
You know about the Underground Railroad.

475
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:37,893
There's talk that the gold never left,

476
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,429
that it's hidden somewhere near the church.

477
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:43,899
Big Bill's been looking for years now.

478
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:48,306
I think Benny knows where it is.

479
00:26:48,543 --> 00:26:50,473
I asked him to make keys for me.

480
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:52,652
He gave me this.

481
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:55,077
I'll be damned.

482
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:58,385
So that's why Big Bill
hangs people for spitting.

483
00:26:58,447 --> 00:27:01,384
He needs bodies to bury
so he can dig for gold.

484
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,447
Without anyone knowing, yes.

485
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:05,721
We find it, we leave.

486
00:27:05,788 --> 00:27:07,272
Simple.

487
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:09,758
Hey. Yesterday,

488
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,060
the deputy you killed,

489
00:27:12,237 --> 00:27:13,996
I know what you did.

490
00:27:14,062 --> 00:27:15,416
You put him against the sky

491
00:27:15,464 --> 00:27:17,543
so no one in the crowd would get hit.

492
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:20,168
You changed your aim.

493
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:22,505
That's just how it turned out.

494
00:27:22,571 --> 00:27:24,349
I do not believe that.

495
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:27,239
I think there is good in you.

496
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:30,036
And I can see it.

497
00:27:30,156 --> 00:27:32,232
Get some glasses, sister.

00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:55,956
[excited chatter continues]

1009
00:59:56,022 --> 00:59:57,515
Long ago.

1010
00:59:57,724 --> 01:00:00,661
[people screaming, shouting]

1011
01:00:02,295 --> 01:00:04,431
And I assure you...

1012
01:00:04,498 --> 01:00:07,167
it was a better place then.
