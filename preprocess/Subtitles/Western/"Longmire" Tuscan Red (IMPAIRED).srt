is better coming from family.

159
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:39,626
Her name is Lauryn.
She works at the casino, too,

160
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,544
and I'd prefer it if you informed her.

161
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:45,611
So, if you two don't mind,
I've got to get back to my people.

162
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:48,885
I'll see myself out.

Ruby: Doctor Bloomfield called.
He wants you to come over right away,

164
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:57,977
said he needed to talk to you in person.

165
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:06,352
Damn it, I really wanted to meet him.

166
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:08,788
So what is Doc Bloomfield like, anyway?

167
00:09:08,873 --> 00:09:12,792
Ruggedly handsome with a somewhat
irresistible air of mystery.

168
00:09:12,877 --> 00:09:15,712
Hey, Doc. This is Deputy Moretti.

169
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,030
My mother's Japanese,
father's Scots-jewish.

170

Thought I'd be Korean, right?
[ chuckles ]

We didn't come here
for your genealogy, Doc.

172
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:25,839
You said you needed to talk in person.

173
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:30,009
The, uh, Mayor asked me to
personally oversee the autopsy

174
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:31,478
and inform you of any results.

175
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:36,349
- Why?
- Well, apparently, Newett Energy's C.E.O.

176
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:38,351
called the Mayor's office this morning,

177
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:41,020
<i>wanted to make sure no
details were overlooked.</i>

178
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:44,357
Also wanted to make sure
no law-enforcement officials

179
00:09:44,441 --> 00:09:47,026
jump to any costly
conclusions about liability.

180
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:49,562
I assume that means me.

181
00:09:49,663 --> 00:09:52,615
Well, you do got a reputation
of being a Cheyenne advocate,

182
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:53,917
and you never really learned

183
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:56,282
how to properly oil
the haunches of power.

184
00:09:56,317 --> 00:09:59,839
- What did you find?
- So far, nothing but trouble. [ spits ]

185
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:04,076
First of all, Ethan Lone Elk had
been painted red from head to toe.

186
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:07,463
Now, the paint fueled the fire
on his front, as you can see,

187
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:10,133
but his back was preserved,
most likely 'cause

188
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:12,685
he was lying down when
the blast occurred.

189
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,438
I took a sample of the
paint ... red, oil-based.

190
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:17,690
Here. 
I cut a swatch from his shirt.

191
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:23,446
And I hate racial stereotypes
as much as the next guy,

192
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:25,448
but it looks like he
was one drunk indian.

193
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:28,201
I swabbed inside his cheek.

194
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:32,956
Hardly seems official.

195
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:36,125
You can't actually get a tox
screen back in 24 hours, can you?

196
00:10:36,243 --> 00:10:39,777
We don't have the luxury of time,
given all the givens, darling.

197
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:42,799
So, Deputy Moretti,
please do me a favor.

198
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:49,121
I want you to hold this mouthpiece
over Ethan's mouth just like so.

199
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:51,123
<i>Ah. Grazie.</i>

Walt, I want you to stand there.

201
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,093
Now, on the count of three,

202
00:10:54,178 --> 00:10:56,896
I want you to press down on
the victim's chest. Ready?

203
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:58,598
One, two, three.

That's a hell of a
lot of beer, eh, Walt?

208
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:10,660
We didn't find any empty
beer bottles or cans,

209
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:14,497
- anything at his house.
- So, Ethan was drinking.

210
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:17,149
This doesn't explain
why he was painted red

211
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:19,986
before a house went up in flames.

Nope. Walt wants us to go out.

I just don't get people sometimes.

221
00:11:45,857 --> 00:11:48,475
They painted his entire body red.

there was an explosion

Did Ethan always go to Dolan's house,

00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:48,512
or did they ever go anywhere for a beer?

256

00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:56,083
Idle no more is a peaceful group.

313
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:58,702
this looks like something
completely different.

314

I don't think some of these
people are even in the group.

Maybe Henry will be able to
talk some sense into them.

- By who?

You're under arrest for inciting a riot.

Is this your idea of justice, Sheriff?

339
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,730
Newett Energy poisons our water

340

and murders my brother,
and you put us behind bars,

while he sits there
like an honored guest?

342
00:18:46,285 --> 00:18:48,753
He's simply filling out
a formal damage report ...

343
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:51,572
thanks to you.
He'll be gone when he's finished.

344
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:53,792
His arrest was fake. 
Ours was real.

towards your re-election

349
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:04,803
- Not a cent.
- Prove it.

350
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,588
- Ask my campaign manager.
- It is true. They are not donors.

351
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:14,778
Walt, we need to talk... 
you and me in private.

352
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:20,068
I just received the official
tox-screen report on Ethan Lone Elk.

353
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:23,488
It appears the explosion
didn't kill him.

354
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:25,106
He was already dead.

355
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,042
- How did he die?
- Acute alcohol poisoning.

356
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,713
- At 0.34?
- That came from his lungs.

357
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:36,360
but his blood test came back at 0.92 ...
more than 10 times the legal limit.

358
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:40,121
<i>I actually called to chew out the lab.
I thought the number was a typo.</i>

359

No one can drink that
much without passing out.

360
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:44,676
Someone was force-feeding
him the alcohol.

361
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:47,762
Any signs of bruising from
a fight, being tied up?

362
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:49,230
The burning and bubbling of the skin

363
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:50,732
would have covered all that up.

364
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,567
This man was painted red

365
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,937
and forced to ingest alcohol
until his body shut down.

366
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:58,022
Pretty brutal death.

367
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,743
We might be looking at a hate
crime ... emphasis on hate.

368

You gonna tell the Mayor?

Not until I get all the facts.

370

solutions, not problems.

Newett Energy has been
targeting me for months.

389

Ethan died in a methane explosion

in my house because
they thought he was me.

Ethan was the target, not you.

392

How do you know that?

393
00:21:46,982 --> 00:21:51,903

poisoning, and Ethan didn't drink.

You said Ethan didn't drink.
His blood-alcohol level was 0.92.

That's enough to kill him.

He was painted red.
Someone targeted him.

432
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:16,030
They painted him red
because he wasn't red enough,

433
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:20,885
because he wasn't Indian enough,
because he chose a black woman.

Was anyone particularly
angry about that?

<i>that the tribe did not
recognize me as Ethan's wife</i>

 to Ethan's body.

turned that anger on Ethan?

Do you really think his family
could have done this because of me?

There's also a possibility
that someone may have been

468
00:26:37,939 --> 00:26:40,891
people your brother
drug-tested and disqualified.

469
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:43,010
My brother was just doing his job.

470
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:44,511
I imagine there's some hard feelings

471
00:26:44,613 --> 00:26:47,948
if people blamed Ethan
for taking jobs away, so...

472
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:53,904
One name on that list stands
out ... Mancell Lone Elk.

473
00:26:54,022 --> 00:26:56,023
He a relation of yours?

474
00:26:56,124 --> 00:26:58,325
You said these are the people
that failed the drug test?

475
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,212
- You know this man?
- He's my father,

476
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:03,881
but he's been clean
and sober for 11 years.

477
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,033
Not according to your brother.

478
00:27:06,134 --> 00:27:10,370
I'm here to take a Dolan
Lone Elk into federal custody.

479
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:13,974
Oh, sorry ... my manners.
I am Lawrence Ward,

480
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:16,010
Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Casper office.

481
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,394
Sheriff, I'd like to thank you

482
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:19,930
- for your cooperation in this.
- What cooperation?

483
00:27:20,048 --> 00:27:21,932
Well, for arresting Mr. Lone Elk here.

484
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,901
- I'm releasing him.
- I'll take him.

485
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:27,354
Disruption of international business,
destruction of private property ...

486
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,224
oh, and a politically motivated murder.

487
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:32,326
You think I killed my brother?

488
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,495
Oh, Dolan, now, I imagine
you probably thought

489
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:36,113
blowing up your own house

490
00:27:36,231 --> 00:27:39,867
would result in some publicity
for your cause. It has.

491
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:42,203
- What are you implying?
- What I'm saying is,

492
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:45,072
is that Mr. Lone Elk
here has hit the big-time.

493
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:47,174
He's now a domestic terrorist.

494
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:56,928
[ sizzling ] 

495
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,734
[ chuckles ]

496
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:08,289
Well, in the realm of drunken
mistakes, that was not so bad.

497
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:11,993
Maybe that should be my
new campaign slogan ...

498
00:28:12,077 --> 00:28:15,163
"Branch Connally, not so bad."

499
00:28:15,247 --> 00:28:19,217
- Good. Hair of the dog?
- Duty calls. Got to work.

500
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:21,941
Oh. Oh.

501
00:28:22,204 --> 00:28:24,422
[ tab pops ]

502
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,591
Ahh. [ clears throat ]

503
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:30,178
Cady, it's 6:30 in the morning.
I made coffee.

504
00:28:32,648 --> 00:28:34,515
What's going on?

505
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:41,105
I'm a single, highly educated woman
in the middle of Wyoming

506
00:28:41,223 --> 00:28:43,441
with absolutely no career to speak of.

507
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:44,775
And my dad and my ex-boyfriend

508
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:47,328
are in the middle of
a nasty campaign fight.

509
00:28:47,412 --> 00:28:50,331
And recently, I just found
out that my mother ...

510
00:28:50,415 --> 00:28:52,333
Your mother what?

511
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,299
<i>- Is this about Denver?
- No.</i>

512
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:12,353
- You should go.
- I should be right here.

513
00:29:12,437 --> 00:29:15,690
This is where I should be.

514
00:29:18,726 --> 00:29:21,595
My mom didn't die of cancer.

515
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,792
[ dogs barking ]

516
00:29:36,495 --> 00:29:38,579
<i>Thanks for meeting me, Mathias.</i>

517
00:29:38,664 --> 00:29:41,448
What do you want with 
Mancell Lone Elk?

518
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:45,253
Same as you. Answers.

519
00:29:45,337 --> 00:29:48,139
<i>Ethan's dead.</i>

520
00:29:48,257 --> 00:29:52,310
His brother's been labeled a terrorist.
Now you want to harass his father?

521
00:29:52,427 --> 00:29:54,512
Hasn't the family suffered enough, Walt?

522
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:57,682
<i>I appreciate your concern, Mathias,</i>

523
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:02,770
- but the Sheriff's just doing his job.
- Probably not for long.

524
00:30:05,473 --> 00:30:07,358
<i>Mr. Lone Elk,</i>

525
00:30:07,475 --> 00:30:10,961
<i>it must have been a difficult job
for your son Ethan to tell people he'd</i>

526
00:30:10,962 --> 00:30:14,448
<i>known his entire life they're not
getting these high-paying casino jobs.</i>

527
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:17,451
It was not easy on him,

528
00:30:17,536 --> 00:30:21,789
but I taught my sons never
to choose the easy path.

529
00:30:21,873 --> 00:30:23,657
And you did a fine job with them.

530
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,044
It must have been 
even harder on Ethan

531
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:30,298
when he disqualified you
for failing the drug test.

532
00:30:30,382 --> 00:30:32,767
This is a tribal elder
you're speaking to, Walt.

533
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:34,852
How hard was that on you, Mancell?

534
00:30:36,555 --> 00:30:40,474
Rejection...

535
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,843
stirs hard feelings in the soul.

536
00:30:42,945 --> 00:30:48,733
<i>When I failed that test,
I was angry and I was ashamed.</i>

537
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,452
What I should have been was proud.

538
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:55,156
I'd raised my two sons to follow truth

539
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,191
so they could not be corrupted.

540
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:59,710
Where were you two nights
ago when your son was killed?

541
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:03,497
He was leading an N.A.
meeting at the res center ...

542
00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:06,300
<i>the one my sister attends.</i>

543
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:14,208
I was clean since
Ethan gave me that test.

544
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:20,097
I wanted to show him that I was worthy
of calling myself his father again.

545
00:31:20,215 --> 00:31:22,383
You have no issue with
your son failing you?

546
00:31:22,484 --> 00:31:24,735
Ethan didn't fail me. I failed him.

547
00:31:24,853 --> 00:31:27,154
But you do have some
issues with his wife.

548
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:33,494
I choose not to recognize
that woman as Ethan's spouse!

549
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:36,230
- Because she's black.
- Because she's not Cheyenne.

550
00:31:36,331 --> 00:31:41,502
When a child chooses to be with
someone you don't approve of,

551
00:31:41,586 --> 00:31:45,373
it feels like rejection,
makes you angry,

552
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:48,509
<i>and anger leads to bad decisions.</i>

553
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:51,846
How could I do that to
my own son ... my own son?

554
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,215
Who knows what you would
do if you were high on this.

555
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:57,351
- Is this meth?
- That's not mine.

556
00:31:57,436 --> 00:31:58,636
I took it off one of our
members at the N.A. meeting.

557
00:31:58,753 --> 00:32:02,390
You are an elder.
You said you were clean.

558
00:32:02,474 --> 00:32:05,592
Lying is the easy path.

559
00:32:07,696 --> 00:32:12,766
When I heard about Ethan,
I bought a 1/4 ounce.

560
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:16,470
Without his expectations to live up to,

561
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:19,323
you tell me ... why
the hell bother, huh?

562
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:21,775
[ voice breaking ] 
Why the hell bother?

563
00:32:24,463 --> 00:32:30,051
So, who's gonna cuff him,
Sheriff? You or me?

564

[ indistinct shouting ]

565

<i>Sean: You really think
you should go in today?</i>

00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:38,392
<i>- Vic: I have to go in.
- Well, I'm walking you to the door.</i>

567
00:32:38,477 --> 00:32:41,729
No. No. That would
just make things worse.

568
00:32:41,813 --> 00:32:43,264
They know we're married.

569
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:45,466
"Newett Energy and
the Sheriff'department

570

are in bed together."

571
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:50,321
Wait. 
Who said that? Walt?

572
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:54,658
No. Dolan Lone Elk, right
before the FBI grabbed him.

573
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:58,112
So now you're letting yourself
be influenced by a terrorist?

574
00:32:58,196 --> 00:33:00,364
Why would you just 
call him a terrorist?

575
00:33:00,482 --> 00:33:02,700
Because that's basically what he is.

576
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:05,586
Babe, look what he's done to durant.

577
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,123
Look what he did at our
headquarters the other day.

578
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:11,325
Sean, please tell me you
didn't call the FBI on him.

579
00:33:11,426 --> 00:33:14,712
Because right now the
heat is off your company.

580
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:16,597
The whistle-blower
is in federal custody,

581
00:33:16,681 --> 00:33:19,767
and you're using the
same language as the FBI.

582
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:24,772
Victoria, the FBI debriefed
my boss on the situation.

583
00:33:24,856 --> 00:33:26,474
I was forwarded a memo.

584
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:30,177
They referred to him as a terrorist.
That's it.

585
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:36,650
- I'd like to see that memo.
- Just what kind of man do you think I am?

586
00:33:36,735 --> 00:33:40,404
[ indistinct shouting ]

587
00:33:47,362 --> 00:33:52,366
- Where's Mancell Lone Elk?
- Thought he'd be safer with Mathias.

588

<i>[ shouting continues ]

<i>Ruby! Stay back!</i>

Is she all right?

594
00:34:19,227 --> 00:34:22,496
She got a bit roughed up. 
She's fine.

595
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:25,082
They seem pretty upset.

596
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,734
Why don't you go down
there and ask them to leave?

597
00:34:27,836 --> 00:34:30,754
You might have to introduce yourself.
You haven't been around much.

598
00:34:30,872 --> 00:34:33,507
Don't you want to know about the paint?

599
00:34:33,592 --> 00:34:38,412
<i>I found the shade of red
painted on Ethan Lone Elk.</i>

600
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:40,581
Tuscan red.

601
00:34:40,682 --> 00:34:42,683
None of the chain stores
could recall any buyers,

602
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:44,418
<i>but I did get about 20 names</i>

603
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:46,420
by hitting all the mom-and-pop
stores in the county.

604
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:48,355
Mancell's name on that list?

605
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:55,145
Why don't you read it and find out.

606
00:35:00,368 --> 00:35:04,121
Branch got a match on the
paint and a list of buyers.

607
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,606
Mancell's not on that list,

608
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:08,292
but that doesn't mean he
didn't already have the paint.

609
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,627
We need to cross-check
the buyers' names

610
00:35:09,744 --> 00:35:12,379
with the list of everyone else
that failed Ethan's drug tests.

611
00:35:12,464 --> 00:35:14,248
We should probably cross-check

612
00:35:14,332 --> 00:35:16,283
with the employees of
Newett Energy, as well.

613
00:35:16,384 --> 00:35:17,635
<i>Walt: You do that.</i>

614
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:22,640
Meantime, I need to
talk to Dolan Lone Elk.

615
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:24,508
He may be a little more forthcoming

616
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:26,727
now he's the FBI's number-one suspect.

617
00:35:26,811 --> 00:35:30,764
Dolan's in FBI custody.
How are you gonna talk to him?

618
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:34,518
Ask nicely.

619
00:35:36,488 --> 00:35:40,190
- Where did everybody go?
- Everybody went home.

620
00:35:40,308 --> 00:35:41,808
Nobody left to supervise their training.

621
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,663
After Walt questioned her,
Lauryn Lone Elk quit.

622
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,364
On the bright side,

623
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:50,451
the man is suffering the worst
political week of his term.

624
00:35:50,535 --> 00:35:53,420
The two biggest job creators
in the area are reeling,

625
00:35:53,505 --> 00:35:56,290
half the county thinks
walt's coddling the natives,

626
00:35:56,374 --> 00:35:59,343
other half thinks he's
in Newett Energy's pocket.

627
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:01,712
With all due respect to Ethan Lone Elk,

628
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:04,598
he couldn't have picked
a better time to die.

629
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:07,167
Yeah, well, I still have a job to do.

630
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:11,021
- I can't keep my hands clean forever.
- No, you certainly can't,

631
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:13,774
especially if you actually
want to win this thing.

632
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:17,061
Even with all of Walt's
sudden political radioactivity,

633
00:36:17,178 --> 00:36:19,012
the election's gonna be close.

634
00:36:19,114 --> 00:36:22,066
There's got to be a better way
to tip this thing in my favor.

635
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:28,405
You know what would help?
Dirt on Walt or his family.

636
00:36:28,523 --> 00:36:31,492
If you've got any
juicy Longmire secrets,

637
00:36:31,576 --> 00:36:33,744
now would the time to spill them.

638
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:48,464
This is a closed crime scene, Sheriff. 

639
00:36:48,548 --> 00:36:51,717
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- Dolan's still in your custody?

640
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,670
Mr. Lone Elk is
answering some questions.

641
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,539
- I have a few of my own I'd
like to ask him.  - Such as?

642
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,508
I'd like to ask him about
some folks on this list ...

643
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,511
people his brother
denied casino jobs to.

644
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,264
See if he knows of anyone
making threats against Ethan.

645
00:37:05,381 --> 00:37:07,232
So, you want to ask the murder suspect

646
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,568
if he thinks you should
pin this on someone else?

647
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,721
<i>I'll tell you what. Why don't
you just let me have that list.</i>

648
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:14,690
<i>I'd be happy to ask Dolan myself.</i>

649
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,993
No, I'll hold onto this.
If I can't talk to Dolan,

650
00:37:18,078 --> 00:37:20,829
I'll just run these names
by some of the neighbors.

651
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:30,589
- Did you get kicked out?
- Yeah. What are you doing here?

652
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,125
Following up on Mancell Lone Elk.

653
00:37:33,242 --> 00:37:35,461
I searched his house ... no red paint.

654
00:37:35,578 --> 00:37:38,747
So, now I'm hoping to talk
to Dolan about his father.

655
00:37:38,848 --> 00:37:41,100
Hope you have more luck than I did.

656
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,302
Who lives over there?

657
00:37:43,419 --> 00:37:46,138
That's Grady Littlefoot
and his brothers.

658
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,733
Here we go.
You here to punish us

659
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,435
for exercising our right to free speech?

660
00:38:00,537 --> 00:38:02,704
It's a free country.

661
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:07,659
I hear there's another
protest at a fracking rig

662
00:38:07,777 --> 00:38:09,611
going on right now.
Why aren't you there?

663
00:38:09,712 --> 00:38:12,047
You have a change of heart?

664
00:38:12,132 --> 00:38:14,383
Can't protest every dumb
thing the white man does.

665
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:17,118
We wouldn't have time for
our better home and gardening.

666
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,454
[ chuckles ]
You looking to sell?

667
00:38:19,556 --> 00:38:24,092
We were. Then the gas started
leaking out of the faucets.

668
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,127
Then the neighbor's house blows up.

669
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:28,147
Right now, we could turn this place

670
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,016
into the Taj Mahal and
nobody would buy it.

671
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:32,568
That's a tough break,

672
00:38:32,652 --> 00:38:35,737
especially since you all just
got turned down for a job.

673
00:38:35,822 --> 00:38:38,490
Names are right here
on this list of folks

674
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,026
that didn't pass the casino drug test.

675
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:43,195
Must have gotten under your skin.

676
00:38:43,312 --> 00:38:46,081
Yeah, we don't snort coke 
or do meth.

677
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:49,418
- But you did fail the drug test.
- Yeah, for peyote ... that's no drug.

678
00:38:49,502 --> 00:38:53,981
- That's our heritage.
- So, Ethan Lone Elk

679
00:38:53,982 --> 00:38:58,210
wouldn't cut you any slack for
observing sacred religious rituals?

680
00:38:58,327 --> 00:39:03,298
Ethan was a self-righteous prick.
He came back here after 20 years,

681
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:08,169
started driving his whitman's car,
waving his white man's diploma,

682
00:39:08,271 --> 00:39:10,505
showing off his black man's wife.

683
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:13,358
It was like suddenly, he
thought he was someone.

684
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,478
<i>He'd pull up over to Dolan's place,</i>

685
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:19,481
and we'd call him over,
invite him to a drink,

686
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,067
and he would just stand
there like he was afraid.

687
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:25,320
So you weren't too heartbroken
about what happened to Ethan.

688
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,489
Eh, he deserved what happened.

689
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:31,460
White man's company blows up
the whitest indian I ever seen.

690
00:39:31,544 --> 00:39:34,195
What do you call that?
Poetic justice.

691
00:39:34,297 --> 00:39:36,381
I'd call that something else.

692
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,585
See, Ethan was dead
before that house ignited,

693
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:42,337
and his body was covered in paint.

694
00:39:45,725 --> 00:39:49,177
Tuscan red ... it matches
the stripes on your car.

695
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:51,480
What, are you trying to
accuse us of something?

696
00:39:51,564 --> 00:39:56,351
I'm still working on it.
[ grunts ]

697
00:39:56,436 --> 00:40:00,055
Here's what I got so far.

698
00:40:00,156 --> 00:40:02,057
I think you asked
Ethan over for a drink.

699
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:05,060
But this time, you didn't
take "no" for an answer.

700
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:08,080
I think you grabbed Ethan
and dragged him over here,

701
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:11,232
held him down, and forced
booze down his throat

702
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:15,587
and painted him Tuscan
red just so he'd remember

703
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,040
no matter how many diplomas he had,

704
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:22,127
Ethan would always be
a red-skinned drunk.

705
00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:25,213
<i>After you forced him to
drink himself to death,</i>

706
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,582
<i>you took him to his brother's house.</i>

707
00:40:27,684 --> 00:40:30,636
You opened the taps, 
closed the doors,

708
00:40:30,753 --> 00:40:35,090
and blew the place to bits
to cover up what you'd done ...

709
00:40:35,191 --> 00:40:40,095
all because Ethan had
made himself into somebody.

710
00:40:40,196 --> 00:40:42,364
And you...

711
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,318
...were still just you.

712
00:40:48,938 --> 00:40:50,455
[ gun cocks ]

713

Unless you want to see if
your blood is Tuscan red,

714
00:40:52,441 --> 00:40:55,294
I'd think twice about that.

715
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,831
[ dog barking in distance ]

716
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,123
You know, I heard that
information I gave you

717
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:10,475
about the shade of house
paint actually came in handy.

718
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,178
Sorry, I forgot to
bring you your trophy.

719
00:41:13,295 --> 00:41:16,398
Should I step out so you
can measure the blinds?

720
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,073
- So, Walt, how's Cady?
- Cady's fine.

721
00:41:25,158 --> 00:41:28,810
That's funny, 'cause...
I don't think she is.

722
00:41:28,911 --> 00:41:33,532
I think she's feeling lost and alone.

723
00:41:33,649 --> 00:41:37,152
And I think deep down, she's angry

724
00:41:37,253 --> 00:41:41,123
<i>because she put her entire life on
hold for you when you needed her.</i>

725
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,793
And now that the tables have
turned and she needs you,

726
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:48,329
you're too busy being
Sheriff to even notice.

727
00:41:48,431 --> 00:41:53,135
Not only do you think you'd
be a better Sheriff than me,

728
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:58,173
you think you can walk in here
and tell me how to be a father?

729
00:41:58,274 --> 00:42:03,445
Walt, I know what happened in Denver.

730
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:08,567
No, you don't.

731
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:13,071
If this was just about you and me, you'd

00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,458
be reading it in the
paper tomorrow morning.

733

But this isn't just about you and me.

<i>So, word of your wife's murder

<i>I can promise you that.</i>

00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:31,833
But I think you should
consider the idea that right now...

00:42:33,274 --> 00:42:37,212
your daughter might need you
more than the county does.
