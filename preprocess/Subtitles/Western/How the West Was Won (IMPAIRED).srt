NARRATOR: This land has a name today
and is marked on maps.

2
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:10,823
But the names and the marks and the land
all had to be won.

3
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,451
Won from nature and from primitive man.

4
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:20,749
Five generations ago,
a mere 1 25 years back...

5
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,961
...this land was known
only as the West.

6
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,506
Known only to a handful of white men...

7
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:32,428
...lonely trappers wandering its vastness
in search of beaver.

8
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,681
They were known as mountain men,
a new breed.

9
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,769
Men like Jim Bridger,
Franchère and Sublette, Linus Rawlings.

10
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,356
More lndian than the Indians
in all but blood.

11
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,484
They held to no law but their own...

12
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:53,240
...drifted free as the clouds,
settled nowhere, kept forever on the move.

13
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:59,246
Their mocassined feet and unshod horses
leaving no trace on the land.

14
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,459
Like the Indians,
with whom they were at peace...

15
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:08,130
...they wanted nothing beyond
what they found, and little of that.

16
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,801
The mountains, the forests,
the harsh country...

17
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,472
...were as unchanging to them
as the stars...

18
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,350
...and just as unyielding.

19
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:25,064
Far behind the mountains,
beyond the rolling plains...

20
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:30,945
...they had left the people of the East,
people who were restless in another way.

21
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,990
The kind who'd look at a mountain
and see a watershed...

22
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,451
...look at a forest
and see lumber for houses...

23
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,329
...look at a stony field and see a farm.

24
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,583
Their faces and their instincts
had been turned to the West...

25
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,836
...ever since Plymouth Rock
and Jamestown.

26
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:52,091
The trapper's road was the trail
of a wolf or the bend of a canyon.

27
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,761
But for whole families
chaffing to follow the sun...

28
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,472
...there had to be broader ways.

29
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,185
There were no roads into the wilderness,
only rivers.

30
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,397
And they flowed in the wrong direction:
north or south.

31
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,692
Or else they stopped at the Alleghenies.

32
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:16,615
Until one day, a new river took source
in the mind of a man named DeWitt Clinton.

33
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,202
He conceived of a river
that would go west.

34
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,708
And in the way Americans have
of acting out their dreams, it came to be.

35
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,544
The Erie Canal left the Hudson
above Albany...

36
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:32,172
...and carried clear across
to the Great Lakes.

37
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,718
People who yearned for virgin land
and a new life...

38
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,220
...now had a highway to take them.

39
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,972
And they moved along.

40
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,725

I'd raise 1 00 bushels of rocks to the acre.

I hauled the bucket up out of the well...

I'll lay you a hundred it's no less than six.

459
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,785
-How will you prove it?
-Go backstage and find out.

460
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:42,414
-lf I go back and check with you.
-Fair enough.

461
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,631
Second girl.

462
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,011
-Miss Prescott? Miss Prescott?
-Later.

463
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,514
It's rather important.

464
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,266
It's always inportant.

465
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:04,018
The older they are.
the more important it gets.

466
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,771
Miss Prescott, please.
I an Hylan Seabury...

467
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:10,024
...attorney in the matter
of Jonathan Brooks.

468
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,193
He means nothing to you?

469
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:13,653
That old goat?

470
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,448
Well, you nust've neant
sonething to him, Miss Prescott.

471
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,366
-Why?
-You're included in his will.

472
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:22,287
Of course, you have to nake the trip
to California to claim the bequest.

473
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:24,831
Well, now. l wouldn't go to California...

474
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:27,917
...if John Jacob Astor left ne
San Francisco.

475
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,670
I don't think Mr. Astor
had holdings there, no.

476
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:34,007
However, the yield from
Mr. Brooks' property is not to be scorned.

477
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:38,470
-Yield of what?
-Gold, Miss Prescott. Gold.

478
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,555
-Gold?
-Precisely.

479
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:46,394
You own a gold nine, Miss Prescott.
It yielded $3500 the very first week.

480
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,688
LlLITH:
Gold nine?

481
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:53,610
Well. Well, l....

482
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:56,529
That sweet old goat.

483
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,826
For heavens....

484
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,048
Well.

485
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:16,883
This is an unexpected pleasure.

486
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,302
-Where's the noney?
-Money?

487
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:20,553
Money?

488
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:24,641
Oh, yes. You're referring, of course.
to our little agreement.

489
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,644
One hundred to start you off...

490
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,604
...and ny share of the winnings.

491
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:35,693
Well, l'n sonewhat enbarrassed to report
that the hundred no longer exists.

492
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,614
That $1 00, I assure you...

493
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:44,369
...will turn out to be the best investnent
you have ever nade.

494
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:46,454
I have plans, gentlenen...

495
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:49,415
...beyond your wildest dreams.

496
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:53,419
I'n gonna earn you
a piece of a gold mine.

497
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,880
Gold nine.

498
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:58,091
You ain't gonna earn nothing.

499
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:01,052
You ain't gonna be nothing.
you ain't gonna do nothing...

500
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,471
...unless we get that 1 00 back
by the norning.

501
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,932
Grines, you don't mean that.

502
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,936
-You're gonna kill off the golden goose.
-Call it what you want. nister.

503
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,021
We'll be waiting.

504
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:39,716
Independence, Missouri, was the jump-off
point for emigrants from everywhere.

505
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:44,304
Solid, God-fearing families
bound for the farmlands of Oregon...

506
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:49,642
...and get-rich-quick adventurers
racing for the gold of California.

507
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,980
Try it.

508
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,988
-You got a wagon. l suppose?
-l can get one.

509
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,406
And a team to pull it?

510
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:04,949
I can get everything I need.

511
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:09,162
-You got a husband?
-l'n single. Mr. Morgan.

512
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:11,623
No traveling conpanion?

513
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,959
-No, I'n traveling alone.
-Not on my wagon train.

514
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,630
Alone and single brings out
the deviltry in a man.

515
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:22,133
Gets then all worked up
and they're wild enough already.

516
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:24,677
I intend to keep to myself, Mr. Morgan.

517
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:28,097
Oh, wonan of your sort?

518
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:33,061
One day you'd find yourself in trouble, and
there'd be hell to pay just figuring out who.

519
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,648
What did you say, Mr. Morgan?

520
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:41,694
Well, now. ain't you the feisty one.
I like spirit in a woman.

521
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:46,157
Hey, you got a pretty face
under that powder too.

522
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:50,119
And a fine, sturdy body
under then clothes, I wager.

523
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:55,208
There's a woman naned Clegg.
Aggie Clegg.

524
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:57,418
Why don't you go see her?

525
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:07,136
Thanks.

526
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:18,189
I told you, no.

527
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:21,234
I was hoping to nake this trip
with a husband.

528
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:22,819
Nearly got one last week.

529
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:26,990
Look. l hear there's 40 men
to every woman in California.

530
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,743
-Miss Clegg. l'd be willing to pay you.
-l don't need noney.

531
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:33,246
I need a nan.

532
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,374
Any man.

533
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,174
Morning, ladies.

534
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,844
Beautiful morning.

535
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:52,306
Would you, by any chance.
happen to be Miss Lily Prescott?

536
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:55,059
Not unless you got a big inagination.

537
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,770
Then you must be the lady in question.

538
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,356
Cleve Van Valen, Miss Prescott,
at your service.

539

At your every command
fron here to California.

00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:04,652
Well, thank you.

541
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,030
But whatever you're offering,
I don't need.

542
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,197
[CHUCKLES]

543
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,615
Perhaps you don't understand.

544
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:10,783
[LAUGHS]

545
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:14,037
Yes. l do.

546
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,621

Well, it's been a pleasure to neet you.
Miss Clegg.

550
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:32,013
May I say l have never seen a woman
with nore beautiful hair.

551
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:34,307
What a prize catch it'll nake...

552
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:37,268
...hanging fron the waist of an lndian.

553
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:42,315
Beauty alone in the wilderness,
and who's to protect you?

554
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:43,566
No one.

555
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:48,863
Not one person
won't be looking after himself.

556
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,241
Well....

557
00:56:54,203 --> 00:56:57,914
Good day. ladies. Good day.

558
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:05,004
Nobody ever said that to ne before.

559
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,964
What?

560
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:11,177
That I had such.... Such beautiful hair.

561
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:16,182
You know something?

562
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:20,853
I got a hunch you're gonna draw men
like fish to the bait.

563
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:24,941
Maybe I can catch one of then
while they swim by.

564
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,152
You got yourself a partner.

565
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,737
Thank you.

566
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,282
MAN 1 :

567
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:37,537
MAN 2: lt's all clear through here. Look for
a little mudhole up through the next pocket.

568
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,705
MAN 1 : How far?
MAN 2: Oh, naybe half a quarter.

569
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,875
MAN 1 : Well, thanks.
MAN 2: Looks a little higher up on that ridge.

570
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:46,921
MAN 1 : There's a water hole up there
about half a mile. Let's head for it.

571
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,973
MAN 3:
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

572
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,396
Hey, you're driving.

573
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:06,649
I was raised on a farm.

574
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:11,529
MAN 3:
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

575

LlLITH:
I thought we'd gotten rid of you.

581
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:28,898
Well, l just couldn't bear to think of
you two making this trip without ny help.

582
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,944
If l was to hear later on that sonething
happened to you, l'd never forgive myself.

583
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,570
You came 1 00 niles alone?

584
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:39,242
Well, l had no way of counting the miles.
Mr. Morgan. but l'll take your word for it.

585
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,661
Well, you've got another 1 00, nister.
Going back.

586
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,997
I told you, when a wagon breaks down,
I want men who can fix it...

587
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,916
...not bet how long it'll take.

588
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:48,751
You don't nean you'll turn ne out?

589
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,504
Pass me adrift at the nercy
of savage Indians?

590
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:53,839
If you don't get moving.
I'll cast you adrift--

591
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,801
Uh-uh-uh.
I appeal to your sporting instinct, sir.

592
00:59:56,969 --> 01:00:00,263
I'n prepared to wager you
that I stay with this train.

593
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,349
-Well, you got a wager.
-Wait a ninute, wait a ninute.

594
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:05,351
The fact is, I hired this man.

595
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:07,979
We'll put up his stake.

596
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,024
Is that right, Miss Prescott?

597
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:14,735
If Miss Clegg says so.

598
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:27,123
Ma'am...

599
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,375

Agatha, have you gone crazy?

602
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:45,224
He says he's a nan
wanting to do an honest day's work.

603
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,562
And he'll do it. l can promise you that.

604
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:53,524
Hey, you nen on that last wagon,
