where you were reassigned
to General Stuart's cavalry...

151
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,016
until you surrendered
in Tennessee.

152

Sadie was not a man.

<i>The "Younger-James Gang"is confusing.</i>

736
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,597
- How's that, Bob?
<i>- Well.</i>

737
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:56,270
Say we burst into a bank, and we yell,
"We're the Younger-James Gang!"

738
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:59,371
People are gonna be thinkin',
"The youngerJames gang?

739
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,849
<i>- "Is there an olderJames gang?</i>
<i>- [Cole] Hey!</i>

740
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,887
<i>How come we never heard</i>
<i>of the olderJames gang?"</i>

741
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,650
So people tryin' to figure that out
instead of raisin' their arms.

742
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,659
- Can't argue with that, Cole.
- Do we even have the same mama? Huh?

743
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:16,528
<i>Do we? Is anybody hearin'me? Huh?</i>
<i>See, I got a little idea.</i>

744
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:20,364
If I kill you, then I killJim,
I'm gonna have no arguments.

745
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:23,672
Pinkerton?
It's been eight months.

746
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:26,537
<i>I see holdups</i>
<i>and I see robberies.</i>

747
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,203
I don't see men
on the end of nooses.

748
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,941
Most of theseJames Gang's encounters
have been with local law enforcement.

749
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:35,814
Quite frankly are no match
for this gang's cunning.

750
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,853
- What about your detectives?
- Listen, you!

751
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,649
Shut up.

752
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:44,457
<i>Now...</i>

753
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,688
I have to hunt this man.

754
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:51,165
I have to get inside
this man's mind.

755
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,668
I have to anticipate him.

756
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:58,268
- And that takes time.
- Time, time, time.

757
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,275
I can't believe this.

758
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:03,073
Would you believe there are
certain towns in Missouri...

759
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,944
where theJames Gang
walks openly in the street...

760
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,314
<i>- as heroes?</i>
<i>- [Parker]</i>
<i>Now, how can that be?</i>

761
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:11,251
<i>[Pinkerton]</i>
<i>Because they are charitable.</i>

762
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:15,324

- #Was blind #

763
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,926
<i>- #But now I see ##</i>
<i>- They gave the sharecroppers</i>
<i>of Maddox so much money,</i>

764
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:19,961
<i>they even built a school.</i>

765
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,931
- That's my money.
- Well, sir, we should burn
that school to the ground.

766
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,936
That's the way to win' em
back to our side.

767
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:32,532
<i>Pinkerton, hundreds of men have</i>

768

769

<i>Now, this...</i>

without interference.

773

- What can you tell me?
- It's going to be a long spring.

774
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,327
If people would just hand over
their money and not shoot at us,

775
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,332
there'd be a lot less killing.

776
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,904
- What's that?
- It's my lucky rabbit's foot.

777
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,739
Took it off
that dead fellow over there.

778

- I don't think
that one's working, Loni.

Lane, Grogan, you take this.
You take these towns.

Here, write this.
I'm not writing this.

785

[Clears Throat]
Your blue-green eyes remind me of...

786

- Remind me of that land in the sky.
- The land in the sky.

787

That "even here."
You might want to change that
to, uh, "I thought of you."

Ah, look, just write
the whole thing yourself. L...

Okay, sir, I think we know
how this is gonna go.

- This is about
the wanted posters, isn't it?
- Yeah.

797
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:52,914
Obviously someone's not standin' out
in people's minds at the robberies.

798
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:56,577
Gents, we're in the middle

799
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,745
- Yeah, Bob's upset.
- The posters?

800
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:02,790
- Yeah.
- Don't say "yeah"
in that tone of voice!

801
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:05,394

You're too young
to be drinkin' whiskey.

818

Not too young to shoot a man,
not too young to drink whiskey.

Ahh!

Why, I was just gettin' ready
to go turn on that Younger charm.

Hell, yeah,
I've been with a girl!

825

So there's only four banks within
that travel radius they've not robbed.

I don't have to.

01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:50,353
<i>- Well, Bob, I think my wife and</i>
<i>I are gonna go and buy a farm.</i>
- A farm?

1180
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:54,360
- Down in Tennessee.
- Hmm. All right.

1181
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:59,764
You, uh... You wanna maybe ride
with the Younger Gang for
a while before you do that?

1182
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:02,165
<i>- [Pats Back]</i>
- Bye, boys.

1183
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:04,170
Tom.

<i>Tennessee, huh?</i>
- Yeah, I think so.

1185
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:11,773
- I'll meet you there in a couple weeks.
<i>- I'll see you soon.</i>

1186
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:16,783
And, uh... thanks for that
distraction back there.

1187
01:29:16,884 --> 01:29:19,910
Hell, they hardly
even noticed us.

1188
01:29:20,054 --> 01:29:22,750
- Mrs. James?
- Shall we?

1189
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:25,916
Shall we, indeed. Frank.
Rangers.

1190
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,119
- Tennessee?
- I'll explain on the way.

1191
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:30,129
All right, boys.

1192
01:29:32,233 --> 01:29:34,963
Let's ride! Hah!

1193
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:37,970
- When were you plannin' on tellin' me?
- I just did.

1194
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:40,836
- Only because I asked?
- Damn! Am I ever gonna win with you?

1195
01:29:40,942 --> 01:29:42,933
- Don't change the subject.
