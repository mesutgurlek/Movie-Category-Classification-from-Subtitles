Well, what'd you find out?

165
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:36,014
I followed their trail
from Clanton country to the river!

There's coffee on the stove and some beans!

Say, maybe I'd better ask around
the banks while I'm down there, huh?

I hear Doc's coming back tonight!

where he's been?

if I was in your boots, Mr Gambler?

You drew three cards
and I stood pat, and yet you raised me.

Now the question is:
What should I do?

Yeah, mighty
interesting game... poker!

Listen, miss, I admire poker,
but you're increasing the odds!

194

I catch you doing that again, I'll run you
back to the Apache reservation!

Oh, Mr Marshal,
you don't think that I...

No, no!

And your reason
for being here, but...

222
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:24,392
Heard a lot about you too, Doc!

223
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:29,371
You left your mark around
in Deadwood, Denver and places!

224

In fact, a man could

to deliver us from all evil!

Wait a minute!
What are you acting so mad about?

322
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,890
Why, this is the fourth time
this year this has happened, Marshal!

- Gentlemen, I can explain!
- What are you fixin' to do about it?

325
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:37,127
Marshal, be reasonable! All we want
to do is to ride him around town!

326
00:30:37,204 --> 00:30:40,002
- A couple of times on the rail!
- [Crowd Agreeing]

Well, that sounds
reasonable enough to me!

Oh, no, not that!
Oh, no!

Wait a minute, boys!
Wait a minute!

I got a better idea!
Just give me 15 minutes!

Thank you!

00:31:43,643 --> 00:31:46,840
To be, or not to be:

344
00:31:46,913 --> 00:31:48,847
That is the question!

345
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:50,850
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind!

346
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:54,877
To suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune!

347

Or to take arms
against a sea of troubles!

And by opposing end them?

349
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:07,258
To die, to sleep, no more.

350
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,562
And by a sleep,
to say we end the heartaches...

351
00:32:11,635 --> 00:32:15,469
and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to!

To die, to sleep!

354
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:27,917
To sleep, perchance to dream.

355
00:32:27,986 --> 00:32:30,853
Ay, there's the rub!

356
00:32:30,922 --> 00:32:34,619
For in that sleep of death,
what dreams may come!

357
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:37,424
When we have shuffled off
this mortal coil...

For who would bear
the whips and scorns of time!

369
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:15,035
The law's delay,
the insolence of office!

370
00:33:15,104 --> 00:33:19,632
And the spurns that patient
merit of the unworthy take!

From whose bourn
no traveler returns!

Puzzles the will and makes us
rather bear those ills we have...

than fly to others
that we know not of!

From cow camp to cow camp,
from one mining town to another!

[Sighs] Well, I should think
that if nothing more!

476
00:43:28,836 --> 00:43:31,168
You'd be at least flattered
to have a girl chase you!

477
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:33,833
Look, Clem!
You've got to get out of here!

478
00:43:33,908 --> 00:43:37,867
- But I'm not!
- This is no place for your kind of person!

479
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:40,346
What kind of a person am I, John?

480
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:43,408
Please, go back home, Clem!

481

Back where you belong!
Forget the... [Coughs]

Does this happen
to John frequently?

00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,138
Oui, mademoiselle.
Each time it's worse!

484

You're ill, John!

485
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:22,760
So that's the reason you left!

486
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:24,763
That has nothing to do with it!

487
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:28,232
Foolish, foolish John,
as if that would have mattered!

488
00:44:28,301 --> 00:44:31,793
I tell you, Clem, the condition
of my health has nothing to do with it!

489
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:35,238
I don't believe you, John!

490
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:37,937
Then I'll give you the truth!

491
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:40,878
The man you once knew
is no more!

492
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:43,576
There's not a vestige
of him left! Nothing!

Come! I'll take you
back to the hotel!

494
00:44:45,652 --> 00:44:49,452
Please, John, you can't
send me away like this!

495
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:53,324
You can't run away from me any more
than you can run away from yourself!

496
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:57,964
Now I know why you don't care
whether you live or die!

497
00:44:58,033 --> 00:45:00,934
Why you tried
to get yourself killed!

I've heard all about you,
John, and you're wrong!

499
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:05,871
So wrong!

500
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:08,842
You have no right
to destroy yourself!

501
00:45:08,911 --> 00:45:11,641
You have a world of friends
back home who love you, John!

And I love you!

From where I'm standing, Earp,
that tin badge you're wearing!

511
00:46:43,014 --> 00:46:46,814
Doesn't give you the right
to stick your nose in my personal affairs!

- Why didn't you tell me Miss Carter's here?

A man would have to go a long ways
before he finds a finer girl than Miss Carter!

That's a sucker game, Doc!

you didn't leave, I would!

Throw your gun down
and come on out, old man!

947
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:06,780
My boys! Ike! Sam!

01:33:06,856 --> 01:33:08,790
Phin! Billy!

949
01:33:08,858 --> 01:33:10,849
They're dead!

950
01:33:10,928 --> 01:33:13,260
I ain't gonna kill you!

951
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:16,197
I hope you live
a hundred years!

952
01:33:16,266 --> 01:33:19,895
Feel just a little
what my pa's gonna feel!

953
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:23,462
Now get out of town!
Start wanderin'!

954
01:33:57,178 --> 01:33:59,112
Wyatt!

955
01:34:00,915 --> 01:34:04,316

Good-bye, ma'am!

[Coach Departing]

960
01:35:08,221 --> 01:35:11,315
There are so many things
I wanted to say!

961
01:35:12,626 --> 01:35:15,823
Now nothing seems appropriate!

962

Yeah, I know!

The mayor says you might be
stayin' here a while!

965
01:35:24,138 --> 01:35:26,231
Maybe help him
get a school started!

966
01:35:26,307 --> 01:35:28,798
Yes! I'm the new schoolmarm!

967
01:35:28,876 --> 01:35:31,071
That's mighty nice, ma'am!

968
01:35:32,147 --> 01:35:34,581
Me and Morg are goin'
out to see Pa!

969
01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:37,483
Tell him what happened!

970
01:35:37,553 --> 01:35:41,080
I might come east again,
get some cattle!

971
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:44,217
Maybe stop by here again!

972
01:35:44,294 --> 01:35:49,163
