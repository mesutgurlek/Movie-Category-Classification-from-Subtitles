Lieutenant Michael O'Rourke, sir.

Have I the lieutenant's permission
to leave, sir?

00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:17,345
Sergeant Major O'Rourke has permission.

Thank you, sir.

Michael, darling, if it ain't,

- Relax, Mickey.

195
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:22,639

You've been assigned to my troop.

He can keep his old cards.

199
00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:33,710
Oh, he can't do that. Protocol requires it.

200
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,657
An officer, upon reporting
to a new post...

201
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,074
...must wait upon his commanding officer
at the first possible moment.

202
00:18:39,105 --> 00:18:40,261
He will leave his card.

203
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,802
He will leave an additional card for each
lady in the commanding officer's family.

204
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:45,609
All other officers on the post...

205
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:48,750
...will leave their cards at the quarters
of the incoming officer, right?

206
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:51,413
Right. Now do you understand?

207
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:55,321
- It was just a duty call?
- That's it. Just a duty call.

208
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:58,726
But there's nothing in the regulations
that says an officer's daughter...

209
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:03,992
...should receive such cards
on her back porch in her nightie.

210
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:07,454
Pish-tush. This is not a nightie.
It's a dressing gown, isn't it?

211
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:10,236
- I wouldn't know.
- And I haven't received any cards, anyway.

212
00:19:10,422 --> 00:19:12,775
Well, hand them over to her, Mickey.

213
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:14,878
Oh, I get it, Miss Thursday.

214
00:19:14,908 --> 00:19:18,219
The lieutenant expected someone to meet
him at the door with a silver salver.

215
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:20,016
- A what?
- A silver salver.

216
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:21,922
He'd drop the cards in that
and hurry away.

217
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,325
You don't happen to have
a silver salver, do you?

218
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:27,540
A silver salver?
Our things haven't even arrived.

Yes, sir.

- Now?

No, next Christmas, you loony.

call Apaches "Digger lndians," sir.

274

You'd scarcely compare them

No, I don't.

The Sioux once raided
into Apache territory.

Old-timers told me you could follow
their line of retreat...

...by the bones of their dead.

279
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:38,873
I suggest the Apache

I've seen on my way out here.

281
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:44,308
Well, if you saw them, sir,
they weren't Apaches.

We'll discuss the Apache
some other time, captain.

If there are none, I intend

Nothing personal in this, Sam.

295
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:34,288
No explanations, Owen.
We've never had them before.

296
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:37,001
- Although, once, I tried.
- There was nothing to explain.

297
00:23:37,162 --> 00:23:39,315
No, nothing.

298
00:23:39,555 --> 00:23:42,547
You did what you did.
Rode to glory.

299
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:46,218
I did what I did.
Wound up at Fort Apache.

300
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,661
- Well, you've wound up here too.
- Oh, by thunder.

301
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:51,404
I've not wound up. Not by a jugful.

302
00:23:51,923 --> 00:23:54,396
They've pushed me aside,
sent me up to this tenpenny post.

303
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:56,749
But they'll not keep me buried.
I'll find something.

304
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,704
This isn't a country for glory,
Owen.

305
00:23:58,865 --> 00:24:01,178
I'll take my risks. I always have.

306
00:24:01,577 --> 00:24:05,327
Well, then all I can do is
wish you good luck.

307
00:24:05,488 --> 00:24:07,163
And I wish you that sincerely.

308
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:09,716
Thank you, Sam.

309
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,027
Will you have a drink?

Even for me.

312
00:24:31,835 --> 00:24:33,550
Anything new about my transfer?

313
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:36,492
- Sorry, sir, nothing yet.
- Thank you.

314
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:40,717
- O'Rourke.
O'ROURKE: Yes, sir?

315
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:43,620
I require a mount. Have two or three
brought over for my selection.

316
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:46,608
- Yes, sir.
THURSDAY: O'Rourke.

317
00:24:51,727 --> 00:24:52,724
Sir?

318
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:57,561
This Lieutenant O'Rourke,
are you, by chance, related?

319
00:24:57,592 --> 00:25:01,182
Not by chance, sir. By blood.
He's my son.

320
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:03,974
I see.

321
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,044
How did he happen
to get into West Point?

322
00:25:08,204 --> 00:25:11,116
It happened by presidential
appointment, sir.

323
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:13,559
Are you a former officer, O'Rourke?

324
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:16,690
During the war, I was a major
in the 69th New York Regiment.

325
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:18,435
The Irish Brigade, sir.

326
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:21,634
Still, it's been my impression that
presidential appointments...

327
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:24,258
...were restricted to sons
of holders of the Medal of Honor.

328
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:28,796
That is my impression too, sir.
Will that be all, sir?

329
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:32,061
Yes, sergeant. It will.

330
00:26:51,974 --> 00:26:53,449
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

331
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,307
- Good morning.
- Good morning, ma'am.

332
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:04,460
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

333
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:07,859
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where Mrs. Collingwood lives?

334
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,681
- Oh, right in there, dear.
- Thank you.

335
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:16,559
- Good morning.
- Philadelphia. Philly.

336
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,022
I was just...
I know it's terribly early to call, but...

337
00:27:19,313 --> 00:27:22,304
Nonsense. Come in, dear.
I'm so glad to see you.

338
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:24,568
I was just passing and...

339
00:27:24,858 --> 00:27:27,650
My, what a beautiful sideboard.

340
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:29,484
And those candlesticks.

341
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:31,081
They were my Aunt Martha's.

342
00:27:31,241 --> 00:27:33,155
I was her favorite niece,
so when she died...

343
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:35,549
...she left her fortune
to a home for stray cats...

344
00:27:35,595 --> 00:27:37,030
...and the candlesticks to me.

345
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:38,929
They're lovely.

346
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,772
Everything is.

347
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:46,201
But our place, it's so bare and so dirty.

348
00:27:46,362 --> 00:27:49,193
- Oh, you poor child.
- And there's no water.

349
00:27:49,483 --> 00:27:51,317
- Mrs. Collingwood...
- "Aunt Emily."

350
00:27:51,348 --> 00:27:54,220
Aunt Emily, what does a woman
do in the Army?

351
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:57,123
Our things haven't...
We haven't even got a coffeepot.

352
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:02,010
- Do I get someone to help me or...?
- Owen. Owen Thursday. That man.

353
00:28:02,943 --> 00:28:04,219
Now, don't you fret, dear.

354
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,642
In times of trouble,
we call on Mrs. O'Rourke.

355
00:28:06,673 --> 00:28:09,580
- Mrs. O'Rourke?
- Mrs. O'Rourke.

356
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:11,166
Martha, where's Mrs. O'Rourke?

357
00:28:11,327 --> 00:28:13,560
- Mrs. O'Rourke.
- Mrs. O'Rourke.

358
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,353
SOLDIERS: Mrs. O'Rourke!
MRS. O'ROURKE: Oh, yes, what is it?

359
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:19,424
- Mrs. O'Rourke.
- Oh, yes, Mrs. Collingwood?

360
00:28:19,585 --> 00:28:22,457
Yes, Mrs. Collingwood? Yes?

361
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:24,811
Mary, this is Colonel Thursday's
daughter...

362
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:27,643
...and this is Mrs. O'Rourke,
the wife of our sergeant major...

363
00:28:27,804 --> 00:28:29,798
...and the mother
of a very fine young officer.

364
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,553
How do you do, Mrs. O'Rourke?

365
00:28:31,714 --> 00:28:34,705
Sam told me about Michael's arrival.
How happy you must be.

366
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:35,902
Oh, I am.

367
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:39,412
- How does he look?
- Oh, he looks wonderful.

368
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:42,564
I mean, he makes a very fine officer.

369
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:45,397
Mary, this poor child has to set up house
in that bare barn.

370
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,349
Don't you worry,
I'll tend to everything.

371
00:28:51,223 --> 00:28:53,376
Well, he is nice.

372
00:28:57,047 --> 00:29:01,914
MICKEY:
Order. And one, two, three.

373
00:29:02,194 --> 00:29:04,307
All right, now let's try it together.

374
00:29:04,468 --> 00:29:08,617
Carry arm. One, two, three.

375
00:29:08,777 --> 00:29:10,691
Put that piece on the ground.

376
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:12,606
Pick it up!

377
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:16,436
Put that piece down, soldier.

378
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:19,708
Captain, when you say "carry arm,"
you mean to carry this little gun?

379
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:22,819
MICKEY: Get back in line!
- Yes, sir. I was only asking.

380
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,692
MICKEY: Shut up and put your hat on!
- Yes, sir.

381
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:30,878
I'm sorry, soldier.
I was only trying to tell you.

382
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,631
(SIGHS)

383
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:39,417
- How's the boy doing, Festus?
- Oh, he's doing fine, Michael.

384
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:41,690
But nevertheless,
he's an officer and a gentleman.

385
00:29:41,851 --> 00:29:44,802
And that's no job for a gentleman.

386
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:48,751
Well, then...

387
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:51,225
Come on.

388
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:56,810
Would Lieutenant O'Rourke
please step over to the stable, sir?

389
00:29:56,971 --> 00:29:58,526
But these men, they're pretty rough.

390
00:29:58,687 --> 00:30:01,478
Ah, but the sergeants... The sergeants
can take over the drill, sir.

391
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:02,715
Very well.

392
00:30:02,876 --> 00:30:06,385
- Sergeants, continue with the drill.
MULCAHY: Yes, sir.

393
00:30:06,546 --> 00:30:11,014
Now, the first thing to do after becoming
a soldier is to look like a soldier.

394
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:13,567
To look like a soldier,
you got to stand like a soldier.

395
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:16,480
Suck in that belly.
Get that hand out of your pocket.

396
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,472
Straighten up those legs.
Pull those feet out. Get that chin up.

397
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:22,743
Wait a minute, Daniel, darling.
Just one moment.

398
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:32,956
I'm gonna make this squad the finest party
of men in the American Army.

399
00:30:41,336 --> 00:30:43,090
Get back in line there.

400
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:46,760
Hold your head up.
Head and eyes straight to the front.

401
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:49,636
Heels together and your toes apart.

402
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:52,831
At the approximate angle of 45 degrees.

403
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:56,745
I've never seen such a ragged line.
Just come out and look at yourselves.

404
00:30:56,906 --> 00:30:59,701
- Get back there.
- Get back there.

405
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:11,923
Now, is there any man here
from Tipperary?

406
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,636
Is there any man here from Cork?

407
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,266
Is there any man here
from County Sligo?

408
00:31:23,427 --> 00:31:24,943
Yes, sir.

409
00:31:26,702 --> 00:31:29,097
Now, we don't wanna show
any favoritism about this...

410
00:31:29,258 --> 00:31:31,454
...but you're now an acting corporal.

411
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:36,725
Now, ahem, Sergeant Shattuck will take you
in the manual of arms.

412
00:31:36,886 --> 00:31:40,320
That is, by numbers.
Meaning one, two...

413
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,994
Come on, get back in line there.

414
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:48,349
Get on your feet. Get in here.

415
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:53,142
Hello, son.

416
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:55,138
It's from your mother and myself.

417
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:57,056
Oh, gee, Dad, he's a beauty.

418
00:31:57,216 --> 00:32:00,610
He's thoroughbred and Morgan.
Get on him, ride him.

419
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,517
MICKEY:
Come on.

420
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:24,455
Hey, Dad, he's a beauty.

421
00:32:24,616 --> 00:32:28,009
He's a leaper, that one.
Go on, take him.

422
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:31,524
SHATTUCK:
...four. One, two, three, four.

423
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:35,159
One, two, three, four.

424
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,517
One, two.

And Corporal Donahue

They make us march up to the crack
In gallant Company Q

428

The drums they roll, upon my soul
For that's the way we go

00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:51,534
Forty miles a day on beans and hay
In the Regular Army, oh

There's Sergeant John McAfferty
And Corporal Donahue

They make us march up to the crack

00:33:05,634 --> 00:33:09,388
- Those recruits, captain?
- Yes, sir. First day's drill.

435
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:11,025
They show promise.

436

(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)

00:33:20,651 --> 00:33:22,448
Surprise.

440
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:25,564
Well, what do you think
of your new quarters?

441
00:33:25,724 --> 00:33:28,160
Well, did you do all this yourself?

442
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,716
Naturally. Even moved the piano.

443
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:34,271
No. Mrs. Collingwood
and Mrs. O'Rourke helped me.

444
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:35,469
They were wonderful.

445
00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:37,985
Mrs. Collingwood gave me
these things and the drapes...

446
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:41,540
...and Mrs. Grayson gave us
Great-Uncle Abraham.

447
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:43,617
He was a very famous man.

448
00:33:43,778 --> 00:33:47,930
And Mrs. Tompkins gave us that chair,
and little Mrs. Bates gave us the stool.

449
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:51,006
Only it doesn't quite match the room.

450
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:54,640
And Francisco gave us Guadalupe.

451
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:56,238
How do you do?

452
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:58,395
She's our cook.

00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:35,770
I'm sorry to interrupt, but Fort Grant
is flashing a general alarm, sir.

466
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:38,728
Have any of our patrols reported,
Mr. Gates?

467
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:40,276
No, sir.

468
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,262
Keep the wire open to Fort Grant.

469
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:44,202
I'll return to the
headquarters immediately.

470
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:45,557
Yes, sir.

471
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,426
My cap and gloves.
What's your name?

472
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:52,253
Guadalupe.

473
00:36:01,268 --> 00:36:03,983
But, Dad, dinner.

474
00:36:04,014 --> 00:36:06,449
Don't wait for me. I may be hours.

475
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:13,714
There'll be other dinners, Phil.

476
00:36:14,145 --> 00:36:16,101
Yes, Dad.

477
00:36:23,452 --> 00:36:25,687
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)

478
00:36:26,095 --> 00:36:28,491
It's all right, Guadalupe.

479
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:31,767
We'll cook other dinners together.

480
00:36:40,086 --> 00:36:41,643
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

481
00:36:46,652 --> 00:36:50,086
- Phil.
ALL: Good evening, Miss Thursday.

482
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:53,973
- Having a party. I'm terribly sorr...
- No, you come right in, dear.

483
00:36:54,134 --> 00:36:57,208
It's just a little welcome
for Lieutenant O'Rourke.

484
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,005
MICKEY:
Your servant, ma'am.

485
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,242
Couldn't have come at a better time,
could she?

486
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:03,239
- No one more welcome.
MICKEY: No, indeed.

487
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,555
Now, then, who shall get this prize?

488
00:37:05,716 --> 00:37:06,913
Our host, of course.

489
00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:09,230
I don't trust you, Sam Collingwood.

490
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:12,904
No, you shall sit here on my right,
next to Captain York.

491
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:14,183
Thank you.

492
00:37:14,343 --> 00:37:16,260
So Lieutenant O'Rourke
can have a look at you.

493
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,497
- Well, I don't know whether that's fair.
- Why not?

494
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:21,332
- Because you'll have to look at him.
- Well, I hope she does.

495
00:37:21,493 --> 00:37:23,448
- You don't drink wine, do you?
- No, thank you.

496
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,286
- Good girl, Philadelphia.
- Coffee, dear.

497
00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:26,764
Were you born in Philadelphia?

498
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:29,280
No, Pomfret, Connecticut.
I was named after my mother.

499
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:30,837
Oh, she was born in Philadelphia?

500
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,873
No, Pawtucket, Rhode Island.
She was named after Grandmother.

501
00:37:34,034 --> 00:37:36,310
Grandmother was the first
Philadelphia in our family.

502
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,747
Oh, then she was...?

503
00:37:37,908 --> 00:37:39,744
PHILADELPHIA:
No, Provincetown, Massachusetts.

504
00:37:39,905 --> 00:37:42,062
Ahem. Let's ta... Let's talk about horses.

505
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:44,857
Do you ride, Pawtu...? Po...? Phil?

506
00:37:45,018 --> 00:37:47,453
- Yes, I do.
- Well, good.

507
00:37:47,614 --> 00:37:50,608
We'll have to order some nice
young officer to take you riding.

508
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,606
Ahem. Emily.

509
00:37:52,766 --> 00:37:55,241
- Shall we leave the men to their cigars?
- All right.

510
00:37:55,402 --> 00:37:58,357
- Have a cigar, Kirby, and I'll join you.
- Sit down, dear.

511
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,346
I can't tell you how
wonderful it is to have

512
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:02,962
you here at the post, Mrs.
Collingwood.

513
00:38:02,993 --> 00:38:06,654
Oh. Oh, I think you'll get along
even without me.

514
00:38:06,948 --> 00:38:09,671
- Without?
- We're just marking time, you know.

515
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:12,677
Sam has applied for transfer
to West Point as instructor.

516
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,025
Oh, I didn't know.

517
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,642
When are you leaving, captain?

518
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:18,965
Leaving? Leaving for where?
I'm not going anywhere.

519
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,486
Leave my own party?

520
00:38:20,517 --> 00:38:21,551
(LAUGHS)

521
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:24,297
Phil meant for the academy, Sam.

522
00:38:24,328 --> 00:38:26,325
COLLINGWOOD:
Oh, that.

523
00:38:27,442 --> 00:38:29,238
Soon, I hope.

524
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,137
Or they may reject me.

525
00:38:31,588 --> 00:38:34,943
Oh, Sam. Sam, they couldn't.

526
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:38,205
They've had my application
a long time, dear.

527
00:38:38,394 --> 00:38:40,870
You know how the Army is, Sam.

528
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,356
Yes, and I know its opinion of me.

529
00:38:43,752 --> 00:38:47,106
And you know our opinion of you too.
Isn't that enough?

530
00:38:47,137 --> 00:38:50,012
And you know what the men
think of you, sir.

531
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,944
Captain, lieutenant, my compliments.

Thank you, Quincannon. Thank you.

550
00:41:02,882 --> 00:41:04,158
One before each meal.

551
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:07,064
Sergeant, take him
back to the guardhouse.

552
00:41:07,094 --> 00:41:10,448
(SINGING)
There was sergeant John McAfferty

553
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:12,383
And Corporal Donahue

554
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:14,465
DOCTOR:
This is against all tradition.

555
00:41:14,577 --> 00:41:17,093
A man comes to serenade a lady,
and what does he find?

556
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:19,306
Her husband and half the regiment
on the balcony.

557
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:22,149
- I am crushed.
- You're a faintheart, doctor.

558
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,093
You only serenade
when husbands are around.

559
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:25,621
And for good reason, ma'am.

560
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:28,246
Seeing what a sorry
romantic figure I cut...

561
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,144
...the husband takes pity on me
and brings out his best port.

562
00:41:31,482 --> 00:41:33,319
Oh, good evening, Captain Collingwood.

563
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,160
This is blackmail, but
you'll find the 18...

564
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:36,593
I know where it is.

565
00:41:37,232 --> 00:41:40,064
Last time I looked,
there were four bottles of '46.

566
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:42,785
I expect to find my property intact.

567
00:41:42,816 --> 00:41:45,762
COLLINGWOOD: The insolence of the man.
- One, two, three... It's all here.

568
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,620
You are an honorable man.

569
00:41:47,651 --> 00:41:50,727
And since this is an occasion,
your glasses.

570
00:41:51,154 --> 00:41:52,188
Come.

571
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:55,213
Let's drink a toast
to the young people.

572
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:58,262
Miss Thursday.

573
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,446
Mickey.

574
00:42:02,664 --> 00:42:05,658
Then you will go riding
with me tomorrow?

575
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,805
Of course.

576
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:10,527
If you really want me to.

577
00:42:17,277 --> 00:42:20,152
To the colonel's lady
and Mickey O'Rourke.

578
00:42:20,183 --> 00:42:24,296
- Here's luck, huh?
- They'll need it, poor darlings.

579
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:46,767
Attention!

580
00:42:48,925 --> 00:42:50,601
Men...

581
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:53,037
...today we gonna put you on the horses.

582
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:55,114
No more walking.

583
00:42:55,275 --> 00:42:57,591
And by the time we get
through with youse...

584
00:42:57,751 --> 00:43:00,745
...you'll be riding like senators,
the all of youse.

585
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:05,978
And your rough-riding sergeant
will be Sergeant Beaufort.

586
00:43:08,376 --> 00:43:10,212
Relax!

587
00:43:16,683 --> 00:43:18,599
Attention.

588
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,594
Gentlemen, this is a horse.

589
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:24,989
You will observe it has no saddle.

590
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,547
The reason it has no saddle...

591
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,942
...is because it will be easier for you
to stay on without the saddle.

592
00:43:30,103 --> 00:43:32,059
Now, before we progress...

593
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:34,775
...did any of you gentlemen serve
with the Southern Arms...

594
00:43:35,066 --> 00:43:36,742
...during the War Between the States?

595
00:43:36,773 --> 00:43:41,285
Yes, sir. I had the pride, sir,
of serving with Bedford Forrest.

596
00:43:41,729 --> 00:43:43,965
- I am proud to shake your hand.
- Thank you, sir.

597
00:43:44,092 --> 00:43:46,647
I hope you have the pleasure
of buying me a drink on payday.

598
00:43:46,678 --> 00:43:47,710
An honor, sir.

599
00:43:47,807 --> 00:43:49,284
You are now an acting corporal.

600
00:43:49,315 --> 00:43:52,010
- Sergeant...
- Please. Please, Sergeant Mulcahy.

601
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:53,437
MULCAHY:
Oh, let them have one.

602
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,243
And now, gentlemen,
this gallant soldier...

603
00:43:56,273 --> 00:43:59,308
...this member of the greatest
cavalry force that ever lived...

604
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:01,975
...will show you Yankees how to ride.

605
00:44:07,959 --> 00:44:10,555
(YELLING)

606
00:44:12,053 --> 00:44:14,249
SERGEANTS:
Attention!

607
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,726
Now you see how easy it is, gentlemen.

608
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:18,714
Gentlemen, to your horses.

609
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:22,069
- Who will be the first volunteer?
- I am.

610
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,419
MULCAHY: Ah, come on. Get up here.
- Get him up here.

611
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:33,535
- A gentleman always remounts. Get up.
- That's it.

612
00:44:33,696 --> 00:44:34,934
Come on, then!

613
00:44:35,094 --> 00:44:36,332
(ALL CLAMORING)

614
00:44:36,492 --> 00:44:37,492
That's it.

615
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:39,509
Stay on your horses, men.

616
00:44:39,654 --> 00:44:42,090
And if you fall off, get on again.

617
00:44:42,135 --> 00:44:44,052
It's an order in the Army,
and a custom...

618
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:47,277
...that when you fall off your horses,
you mount again like a gentleman.

619
00:44:47,438 --> 00:44:49,075
SERGEANT 1:
Stay on that horse.

620
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:51,473
SERGEANT 2:
Get back on your horse.

621
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:54,308
Get back on that horse right now.
Get back on that horse.

622
00:44:54,469 --> 00:44:56,865
SOLDIER: Hey, let go. Hey, get off of him.
Get him off.

623
00:44:57,025 --> 00:44:58,433
SERGEANT 2:
Get back on that horse.

624
00:44:58,464 --> 00:45:02,018
- Now, come on, get on that horse again.
SERGEANT 2: Get up there on that horse.

625
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,537
MULCAHY:
Hey, come back here!

626
00:45:03,698 --> 00:45:06,493
Where do you think you're going?
Come back here with that horse.

627
00:45:06,654 --> 00:45:09,649
- What's the matter with you?
SERGEANT 2: Get up there.

628
00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:13,005
- Come on. Get off the horse.
- Stay on him there.

629
00:45:13,884 --> 00:45:15,241
Watch it down there, boys.

630
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:18,072
Here! Here! Come back here!

631
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:20,285
- Come on. Get into it.
- There's a boy.

632
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,676
Hey.

633
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:22,952
(HORSE NEIGHING)

634
00:45:23,113 --> 00:45:25,099
Hey, get back up on that horse.
What's the matter?

635
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:27,825
Knees close together.
Everybody just get right where they...

636
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:31,381
- Hey, what are you doing?
SERGEANT 2: Get him up there. Come on.

637
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:34,218
Stay on that horse, will you?

638
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:38,412
Take the reins in both hands.
Press in tight with your knees.

639
00:45:38,573 --> 00:45:40,530
Look at the legs on that one.

640
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:43,127
- One at a time on that horse.
- Hold him.

641
00:45:44,885 --> 00:45:47,201
SERGEANT 1:
Watch out, everybody. Now listen to me.

642
00:45:47,362 --> 00:45:49,358
SERGEANT 2:
Get that horse.

643
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:52,874
Sir, I beg to report I lost my Yankee cap.

644
00:45:53,034 --> 00:45:56,389
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

645
00:45:56,439 --> 00:45:58,348
SERGEANT 2:
Hey, you, up there straight. Get up.

646
00:45:58,507 --> 00:45:59,745
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

647
00:46:13,933 --> 00:46:16,010
Isn't this wonderful?

648
00:46:16,295 --> 00:46:18,292
What's that over there?

649
00:46:18,453 --> 00:46:19,770
Blue Mesa.

650
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,338
Can't we go there?

651
00:46:21,497 --> 00:46:24,693
Well, it's not as close as it appears,
Miss Thursday.

652
00:46:24,724 --> 00:46:26,961
Are you anxious to return to the fort,
lieutenant?

653
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:29,358
Oh, no, Miss Thursday.

654
00:46:29,518 --> 00:46:32,713
Don't you like the name of Phil, Michael?

655
00:46:32,744 --> 00:46:34,940
Of course I do, Phil.

656
00:46:58,964 --> 00:47:01,520
And right over there,
that's where the telegraph line is.

657
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,307
That's our main headache around here.

658
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:06,884
- Runs from here to Fort Grant.
- You mean, where the smoke is?

659
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:08,887
Smoke?

660
00:47:09,177 --> 00:47:11,813
Is it an Indian signal?

661
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:16,424
No, it's not an Indian signal.

662
00:47:18,486 --> 00:47:21,881
The line went dead, sir.
Right in the middle of the last word.

663
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:25,368
"Meacham reports Diablo's band
decamped from reservation.

664
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,771
Last seen headed S-O-U-T..."

665
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:31,198
South, obviously.
Or southeast or southwest.

666
00:47:31,229 --> 00:47:34,275
Which means they may have crossed
10 miles from here or 200.

667
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:37,790
- We can't patrol all of it.
- I'm fully aware of that, captain.

668
00:47:38,241 --> 00:47:40,437
Think they're headed for the border
to join Cochise?

669
00:47:40,468 --> 00:47:42,545
That's my opinion, sir.

670
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,146
And these are the three
main passes to Mexico?

671
00:47:45,177 --> 00:47:48,851
Well, there are others, but those
are the ones the Apache use most.

672
00:47:49,377 --> 00:47:52,133
Two of them in our patrol area.

673
00:47:52,552 --> 00:47:55,427
Captain York, you and Mr. O'Rourke
take a troop and patrol the area.

674
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:58,493
- Mr. O'Rourke is not on the post, sir.
- Why not?

675
00:47:58,655 --> 00:48:01,690
- He's out riding, sir, with your daughter.
- He what?

676
00:48:01,722 --> 00:48:04,597
- How long ago? When did they go out?
- Almost three hours past, sir.

677
00:48:04,628 --> 00:48:06,533
- Three?
- Are you sure it's that long?

678
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:08,561
- Positive, sir.
- Blasted young fool.

679
00:48:08,592 --> 00:48:11,987
O'Rourke, hasn't that idiot son of yours
sense to know this country's not safe?

680
00:48:12,148 --> 00:48:13,557
Taking my daughter riding.

681
00:48:13,588 --> 00:48:16,776
Your daughter is as safe with my son
as she would be with any man.

682
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:19,682
How safe is that
with the Apaches on the warpath?

683
00:48:21,925 --> 00:48:24,082
MICKEY:
Phil, get back!

684
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:25,686
Collingwood, take out a patrol at once.

685
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,236
York, pass the word to A and B.

686
00:49:28,267 --> 00:49:30,224
Tell them to turn to,
full field equipment.

687
00:49:30,577 --> 00:49:31,815
Rations for a week.

688
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:43,481
MICKEY:
Wagon's burned. Two men dead.

689
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:45,421
Lieutenant Thursday.

690
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:59,523
Repair wagon, sir, burned.
Two troopers, Barry and Williams, dead.

691
00:49:59,644 --> 00:50:02,639
Spread-eagle on the wheels, roasted.

692
00:50:04,736 --> 00:50:08,490
- And my daughter saw all that?
- Yes, sir.

693
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,234
- I'll take your report inside, mister.
- Yes, sir.

694
00:50:13,086 --> 00:50:15,203
Are you all right, Phil?

695
00:50:16,415 --> 00:50:18,531
Yes, Dad. I'm all right.

696
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,267
Take her inside, will you?

697
00:50:39,874 --> 00:50:41,671
Must have jumped them at sundown.

698
00:50:41,926 --> 00:50:45,321
It was a pretty big party.
Twenty-five or thirty, anyway.

699
00:50:45,352 --> 00:50:47,148
Mescalero Apaches.

700
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:49,261
I found this.

701
00:50:53,496 --> 00:50:56,051
- Blood.
- Apaches carry off their dead.

702
00:50:56,379 --> 00:50:59,734
It's Mescaleros, all right. Diablo's band.

703
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:01,898
You say their trail led off to the south?

704
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:03,846
It headed that way, sir, but...

705
00:51:03,937 --> 00:51:06,093
You didn't follow it
long enough to find out?

706
00:51:06,124 --> 00:51:10,198
No, sir. I couldn't take that risk
with Miss Thursday, sir.

707
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:14,085
Your caution, Mr. O'Rourke,
is commendable...

708
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:16,552
...but somewhat belated.

709
00:51:17,777 --> 00:51:20,173
My compliments
on the completeness of this report.

710
00:51:20,572 --> 00:51:22,489
It speaks a knowledge
of the savage Indian...

711
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,555
...which I am sure you did not
acquire at the military academy.

712
00:51:28,037 --> 00:51:30,512
I call it to your attention...

713
00:51:31,582 --> 00:51:35,736
...that in taking my daughter riding
without bespeaking my permission...

714
00:51:36,168 --> 00:51:37,766
...you have been guilty of behavior...

715
00:51:37,797 --> 00:51:40,672
...more consistent with that
of an uncivilized Indian...

716
00:51:41,066 --> 00:51:42,783
...than an officer and a gentleman.

717
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:47,289
If I have not made myself
sufficiently clear, mister...

718
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:49,528
...I will add this:

719
00:51:49,742 --> 00:51:52,577
You will not again ride with my daughter.

720
00:51:53,258 --> 00:51:57,213
And, for reasons which I feel it
unnecessary to go into...

721
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,866
...you will avoid her company
in the future.

722
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:01,549
But, colonel...

723
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,255
I speak to you not only
as your commanding officer...

724
00:52:04,286 --> 00:52:06,682
...but as Philadelphia's father.

725
00:52:06,935 --> 00:52:09,571
I think I am within a father's rights,
Captain York.

726
00:52:09,965 --> 00:52:12,601
My daughter's life and safety
are precious to me.

727
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:14,670
And to me, sir, I assure you.

728
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:17,865
Then you will all the more readily
bow to my wishes.

729
00:52:18,393 --> 00:52:19,831
Yes, sir.

730
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,166
Now, mister...

731
00:52:25,721 --> 00:52:27,877
...you say the break was here?

732
00:52:29,093 --> 00:52:32,328
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm. Excellent.

733
00:52:33,127 --> 00:52:36,484
Send a wagon and a detail to repair
the wires and bring back the bodies.

734
00:52:36,515 --> 00:52:39,216
Yes, sir. Sergeant major,
assemble a platoon from A Troop.

735
00:52:39,247 --> 00:52:42,828
A platoon? I said a detail, captain.
An officer and four men.

736
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,376
But the Apaches may still be around.

737
00:52:44,407 --> 00:52:46,723
I'm running a command,
not a debating society, York.

738
00:52:46,754 --> 00:52:49,510
- Four men. I'll be in command...
- Mr. O'Rourke will be in command.

739
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:53,634
Mr. O'Rourke in command. Have them take
60 rounds of carbine ammunition per man.

740
00:52:53,665 --> 00:52:56,678
That's a lot for men who've been
trained to shoot. Thirty will be ample.

741
00:52:56,709 --> 00:52:57,947
Thirty will be ample.

742
00:52:58,311 --> 00:53:00,228
And 18 per revolving pistol.

743
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:02,857
You'll call for volunteers.

744
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,634
With the colonel's
permission, I volunteer.

745
00:53:04,665 --> 00:53:05,931
Permission refused.

746
00:53:05,962 --> 00:53:08,318
Carry out your orders, sergeant major.

747
00:53:08,412 --> 00:53:12,086
You'll leave within the quarter-hour,
Mr. O'Rourke. Questions?

748
00:53:16,538 --> 00:53:18,494
Michael.

749
00:53:18,525 --> 00:53:20,242
You know what's
expected of you now?

750
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:22,785
Sure, Dad, I know.

751
00:53:22,922 --> 00:53:26,037
Derice, go get Quincannon
out of the guardhouse. Wait.

752
00:53:26,315 --> 00:53:29,271
O'Feeney, go to the stables and find
Mulcahy, Shattuck and Johnny Reb.

753
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,756
Tell them they're volunteering
for a hazardous mission.

754
00:53:31,787 --> 00:53:33,150
Beyond the call of duty.

755
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:35,896
Tell them their regiment is proud of them.
Now get going.

756
00:53:35,927 --> 00:53:37,684
Come on, come on.

757
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:44,035
You spoke before of a platoon
from A Troop, Captain York.

758
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:47,066
I suggest you assemble it.

759
00:53:47,344 --> 00:53:49,770
Light marching equipment,
but full bandoleers.

760
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:52,237
We'll leave in 30 minutes.
I'll command, you'll accompany.

761
00:53:52,268 --> 00:53:55,423
- You mean we're gonna trail the wagon?
- At a striking distance.

762
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,837
Collingwood.

763
00:53:59,016 --> 00:54:01,931
You remember the paper
that Captain Robert E. Lee wrote...

764
00:54:01,962 --> 00:54:03,998
...when he was at the Point?

765
00:54:04,212 --> 00:54:07,406
The one on the trap
as a military weapon?

766
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:13,622
I do not share the popular view
of Captain Lee's ability as tactician...

767
00:54:13,938 --> 00:54:16,574
...but that paper impressed me.

768
00:54:17,218 --> 00:54:19,854
Particularly the maneuver
that Genghis Khan employed...

769
00:54:19,884 --> 00:54:22,080
...in the battle of Kinsha in 1221.

770
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:24,147
You recall...?

771
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:26,814
- Hadn't you better be moving, captain?
- Yes, sir.

772
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:29,084
What, no debate this time, captain?

773
00:54:29,539 --> 00:54:32,015
No debate, sir. No questions.

774

Their hats should be creased

There's no reason, to your knowledge...

836
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:41,064
...why a band of Apache should
go on the warpath?

837
01:02:41,245 --> 01:02:44,636
Not the warpath.
Misguided maybe, like wayward children.

838
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:47,437
Mister, two of my troopers are dead.
Tortured to death.

839
01:02:47,468 --> 01:02:50,500
Not by my Apaches.
Some other raiding party, perhaps.

840
01:02:50,643 --> 01:02:51,799
How can you be sure?

841
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:54,064
We've taken Diablo and his band,
what's left of them.

842
01:02:54,095 --> 01:02:56,049
- They'll be here soon.
- You'll keep them here.

843
01:02:56,209 --> 01:02:58,044
You'll assign a troop
to keep them here.

844
01:02:58,335 --> 01:03:00,768
That's what I've been telling Mr. York.
I leave it to you.

845
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:04,300
How can I, one lone man,

Now you see what's happened.

847
01:03:05,797 --> 01:03:08,230
Two of your men have been killed.

848
01:03:08,521 --> 01:03:10,915
Brave men serving their country, as I am.

849
01:03:10,946 --> 01:03:13,379
This wouldn't have happened
if the highhanded Mr. York...

850
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:15,883
- Oh, you mealy-mouthed...
- Captain York.

851
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,507
Mr. Meacham is a representative
of the United States government.

852
01:03:19,538 --> 01:03:21,413
He will be treated with due respect.

853
01:03:21,485 --> 01:03:24,199
- May I say something, sir?
- What is it?

854
01:03:24,584 --> 01:03:28,095
No troop or squadron or regiment's gonna
keep the Apaches on this reservation...

855
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,850
...unless they wanna stay here.

856
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,914
Five years ago,
we made a treaty with Cochise.

857
01:03:32,945 --> 01:03:35,498
He and his Chiricahuas
and some of the other Apache bands...

858
01:03:35,529 --> 01:03:36,885
...came on the reservation.

859
01:03:36,915 --> 01:03:40,306
They wanted to live here in peace,
and did for two years.

860
01:03:40,467 --> 01:03:42,621
And then Meacham here was sent
by the Indian ring.

861
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:43,981
That's a lie. I'd been...

862
01:03:44,019 --> 01:03:46,572
The dirtiest, most corrupt political group
in our history.

863
01:03:46,732 --> 01:03:50,602
Then it began. Whiskey, but no beef.
Trinkets instead of blankets.

864
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:55,731
The women degraded, the children sickly,
and the men turning into drunken animals.

865
01:03:55,762 --> 01:03:58,235
So Cochise did the only thing
a decent man could do.

866
01:03:58,266 --> 01:04:01,337
He left. Took most of his people
and crossed the Rio Bravo into Mexico.

867
01:04:01,368 --> 01:04:02,694
- He broke his treaty.
- Yes.

868
01:04:02,855 --> 01:04:04,571
Rather than see his nation wiped out.

869
01:04:04,731 --> 01:04:08,002
The law's the law, and I demand
that you soldier boys enforce it.

870
01:04:08,422 --> 01:04:10,138
Any demands you wish to make...

871
01:04:10,168 --> 01:04:13,239
...you will make through
official channels, Mr. Meacham.

872
01:04:13,401 --> 01:04:15,754
Do not again employ that word
in my presence.

873
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:18,538
- No offense, sir. No offense.
SOLDIER: Ready, sir.

874
01:04:18,698 --> 01:04:20,294
- Lead the way. Come along, sir.
- Where?

875
01:04:20,455 --> 01:04:23,127
- To your storehouse.
- There's nothing in there.

876
01:04:24,586 --> 01:04:25,861
Here, sir.

877
01:04:27,538 --> 01:04:30,451
- Mister... Colonel Thursday, I protest.
YORK: Put it in writing.

878
01:04:31,372 --> 01:04:33,606
- What's in these boxes?
- It's marked "Bibles," sir.

879
01:04:33,637 --> 01:04:35,592
- That's all it is...
- Open them up.

880
01:04:47,282 --> 01:04:48,797
What's this scale used for?

881
01:04:48,978 --> 01:04:50,534
Weigh government beef rations.

882
01:04:50,605 --> 01:04:55,073
Hmm. I seem to have gained 75 pounds
since I came to Arizona.

883
01:05:04,353 --> 01:05:06,268

884
01:05:07,146 --> 01:05:09,660

885
01:05:19,241 --> 01:05:21,115
What's in this, brimstone and sulfur?

886
01:05:21,146 --> 01:05:22,914
You know what it is.
I'm entitled to keep it.

887
01:05:22,945 --> 01:05:25,458
Your license may permit you
to keep medicinal whiskey...

888
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:26,642
...but this is no whiskey.

889
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:28,344
You're not used to
frontier whiskey.

890
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:30,467
I don't know. I've
tasted most everything.

891
01:05:30,498 --> 01:05:32,852
Sergeant, you a judge of whiskey?

892
01:05:33,724 --> 01:05:36,437
Well, sir, some people say I am,
and some say I'm not, sir.

893
01:05:36,468 --> 01:05:38,463
Tell me what you make of this.

894
01:05:53,557 --> 01:05:55,113
Well...

895
01:05:56,378 --> 01:05:58,452
...it's better than no whiskey at all, sir.

896

- Strike a match.
BEAUFORT: Yes, sir.

897
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:12,430
Since it doesn't appear to be whiskey...

898
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:16,215
...and since it seems to be of highly
inflammable and dangerous liquid...

899
01:06:16,246 --> 01:06:19,957

a liar, a hypocrite...

902
01:06:26,748 --> 01:06:29,197
...and a stench in the nostrils
of honest men. If it were in my power...

903
01:06:29,395 --> 01:06:32,547
...I'd hang you from the nearest tree,
leave your carcass for the buzzards.

904
01:06:33,096 --> 01:06:35,849
But as you are a representative
of the United States government...

905
01:06:36,267 --> 01:06:38,996
...I pledge you the protection
and cooperation of my command.

906
01:06:39,027 --> 01:06:40,662

I'm ashamed of you, the whole of youse.

922
01:08:20,717 --> 01:08:22,751
You're a disgrace to your regiment.

923
01:08:22,783 --> 01:08:27,132
If there was a regulation for it,
I'd make you take the tippler's oath.

924
01:08:27,832 --> 01:08:29,149
Michael.

925
01:08:31,811 --> 01:08:33,606
Volunteers for the manure pile.

Assuming you found Cochise...

935
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,681
...would he listen to you,
would he believe you?

936
01:09:13,712 --> 01:09:16,984
Cochise knows me, sir.
I've never lied to him.

937
01:09:17,201 --> 01:09:20,353
And if you can assure him
decent treatment for his people...

938
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:23,472
I'll confess he interests me.

939
01:09:24,024 --> 01:09:25,899
And these Eastern newspapers...

940
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:29,002
I hadn't realized Cochise
was so well-known.

941
01:09:29,516 --> 01:09:31,232
Oh, he's known.

942
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,550
He's had the laugh on every troop
in the Southwest these three years.

943
01:09:37,226 --> 01:09:43,091
Six campaigns, he's outgeneraled us,
outfought us, and outrun us.

944
01:09:43,301 --> 01:09:45,017
That's just the point, sir.

945
01:09:45,113 --> 01:09:48,505
There aren't enough troops in the whole
territory to make Cochise come back.

946
01:09:49,006 --> 01:09:52,238
But one man, a man he trusts,
might persuade him.

947
01:09:52,597 --> 01:09:55,310
A carbine against his spine
might be more persuasive.

948
01:09:55,341 --> 01:09:57,734
Well, I'll go in unarmed, sir.

949
01:09:58,463 --> 01:10:02,493
Can't fight my way in.
Either walk in or...

950
01:10:04,217 --> 01:10:07,010
A man who brought Cochise back...

951
01:10:07,819 --> 01:10:09,893
I'm for it, captain.
How many men will you need?

952
01:10:10,197 --> 01:10:11,952
One, sir. Sergeant Beaufort.

953
01:10:12,088 --> 01:10:14,003
- "Private Beaufort," sir.
THURSDAY: Why him?

954
01:10:14,124 --> 01:10:16,118
He speaks Spanish, so does Cochise.

955
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:17,914
My Apache has its limits.

956
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:20,277
Shouldn't you take another officer
instead?

957
01:10:20,525 --> 01:10:22,798
- Sergeant Beaufort was a...
- "Private Beaufort," sir.

958
01:10:22,829 --> 01:10:26,020
Private Beaufort was a major
in the Confederate Army.

959
01:10:26,216 --> 01:10:27,732

THURSDAY:
Hmm.

961
01:10:30,876 --> 01:10:33,070
I remember Cadet Stuart.

962
01:10:33,599 --> 01:10:35,554
- Quite.
- He was...

963
01:10:36,215 --> 01:10:38,330
Were you saying something, captain?

964
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:39,924
I said, "Quite," sir.

965
01:10:40,022 --> 01:10:42,495
I'd like to leave at once,
if the colonel has no questions.

966
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:44,884
- Hmm? What?
- Questions, sir?

967
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:47,389
No, no questions.
Proceed, captain. Take your ex-rebel.

968
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,294
- Thank you.
- That is all.

- Yes, sir.

Good evening, lieutenant.
I haven't been seeing much of you lately.

Please don't stand.

- Phil... Miss Thursday, I...
- I had hoped you might call.

990
01:13:40,915 --> 01:13:43,149
You did leave your card, didn't you?

991
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,935
This is your card, isn't it?

992
01:13:45,355 --> 01:13:47,110
Isn't it proper,
Sergeant Major O'Rourke...

993
01:13:47,141 --> 01:13:49,255
...for an officer to call
after he's left his card?

994
01:13:49,545 --> 01:13:50,621
It would be, except that...

995
01:13:50,652 --> 01:13:53,125
The colonel has forbidden me
to address you, Miss Thursday.

996
01:13:53,286 --> 01:13:55,480
But you are addressing me,
aren't you, lieutenant?

997
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:58,194
And if a young man
hasn't enough gumption...

998
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:02,175
...to address a young woman who,
even if her father is a colonel, well...

999

as I think he is.

- Do you, Mrs. O'Rourke?
- No, I don't.

Ma'am, your father is
Michael's commanding officer.

1002
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:11,963
His orders will be obeyed.

Miss Thursday,
I'm afraid you'd best leave us.

Michael O'Rourke.

1005

Sit down, dear.

1006
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:18,905
And you sit down yourself.

1007
01:14:19,066 --> 01:14:21,099
And you, have you nothing to say?

1008
01:14:21,259 --> 01:14:23,850
Or have you learned your manners
from this big bull of a man?

1009

There's much I'd say,

Miss Thursday...

...if I had any thought
that it really mattered

to you or not...

the same way about me.

And what way was that, lieutenant?

Well, I...

Come, Philadelphia.
I'm here to bring you home.

1023
01:15:15,981 --> 01:15:18,533
I'm not ready to leave, Father.
I've been invited to dinner.

1024
01:15:18,564 --> 01:15:20,278
Won't you stay, colonel?

1025
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:23,229
Thank you, Mrs. O'Rourke.
Another time, perhaps.

1026
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:27,177
Well, at least allow me
to take your hat?

1027
01:15:27,338 --> 01:15:29,929
I beg your pardon. Come, Phil.

1028
01:15:30,219 --> 01:15:31,614
Colonel Thursday, sir, I would...

1029
01:15:31,645 --> 01:15:33,877
Mr. O'Rourke, I want no words
with you at this time.

1030
01:15:33,908 --> 01:15:35,782
- But, colonel, sir...
- You heard me, sir.

1031
01:15:36,071 --> 01:15:38,981
Now get out of here
before I say something I may regret.

1032
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:41,474
This is my home, Colonel Owen Thursday.

1033
01:15:41,635 --> 01:15:44,346
And in my home I will say
who is to get out and who is to stay.

1034
01:15:44,377 --> 01:15:47,207
And I will remind the colonel
that his presence here, uninvited...

1035
01:15:47,606 --> 01:15:49,400
...is contrary to Army regulations...

1036
01:15:49,431 --> 01:15:51,664
...not to mention the code
of a well-mannered man.

Dad, please.

1038
01:15:53,019 --> 01:15:55,850
Colonel Thursday, sir,
what I've been trying to tell you, sir...

1039
01:15:55,881 --> 01:15:57,236
...is that I love your daughter.

1040
01:15:57,267 --> 01:16:00,265
And I ask her now,
in your presence, to be my wife.

1041
01:16:00,296 --> 01:16:02,289
Yes, Michael.

1042
01:16:04,585 --> 01:16:06,259
I see.

1043
01:16:07,644 --> 01:16:10,755
- Philadelphia, I ask you to reconsider.
- No, Father.

1044
01:16:10,786 --> 01:16:14,055
I tell you, this is not
a proper or suitable marriage for you.

1045
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:15,809
I can't believe that.

1046
01:16:15,887 --> 01:16:19,597
Sergeant Major O'Rourke,
you will pardon me for speaking bluntly.

1047
01:16:20,003 --> 01:16:22,754
But as a noncommissioned officer,
you are aware of the barrier...

1048
01:16:22,785 --> 01:16:24,977
...between your class and mine.
O'ROURKE: I am, sir.

1049
01:16:25,182 --> 01:16:28,052
But Michael's an officer.
Not that it makes any difference.

1050
01:16:28,343 --> 01:16:30,774
It makes a difference in the Army, Phil.

1051
01:16:31,034 --> 01:16:33,705
The sergeant major knows that,
and his son should know it.

1052
01:16:33,765 --> 01:16:36,396
The Army, sir, is not the whole world.

1053
01:16:36,537 --> 01:16:39,727
No, but it's your world,
and your mother's world and my world.

With the colonel's permission...

1055
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,466

- That won't be necessary, sergeant major.

entering your quarters without invitation.

Mr. O'Rourke, your pardon for my words.
Come, Phil.

I'm not a child, and I love Michael.

- Yes, sir.

I've been looking forward to tonight.

1093
01:21:51,967 --> 01:21:53,401
I'm forever telling the captain...

1094
01:21:53,433 --> 01:21:56,902
...that it's the noncommissioned officers'
dance that is the nicest dance.

Don't you think so, Mrs. O'Rourke?

1096

- Well, of course I do.
- And, sergeant major...

1097
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:05,200
- ...will you please claim me for a dance?
- With the greatest of pleasure, ma'am.

Again, on behalf of the officers
of Fort Apache...

1101

Exactly. We have tricked him.

1141

Tricked him into returning to American

I'm merely stating.

The Apache, sir,

01:38:57,778 --> 01:39:01,290
...named Jerome in our language,
but in Spanish, Geronimo.

1234
01:39:01,615 --> 01:39:03,530
Well, time to get on with it, Beaufort.

1235
01:39:03,561 --> 01:39:11,386
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

1236
01:39:21,479 --> 01:39:24,034
THURSDAY: What's he saying?
- That the Apaches are a great race, sir.

1237
01:39:24,065 --> 01:39:26,020
They've never been conquered.

1238
01:39:29,279 --> 01:39:32,072
But it is not well for a nation
to be always at war.

1239
01:39:33,407 --> 01:39:34,922
The young men die.

1240
01:39:36,778 --> 01:39:38,614
The women sing sad songs.

1241
01:39:41,010 --> 01:39:43,685
And the old ones are hungry
in the winter.

1242
01:39:46,999 --> 01:39:49,394
And so I led my people from the hills.

1243
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:52,897
And then came this man.

1244
01:40:01,965 --> 01:40:04,274
THURSDAY: What did he say?
- Well, sir...

1245
01:40:04,435 --> 01:40:07,349
...a free translation would be that
Meacham's a yellow-bellied polecat...

1246
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:09,705
...of dubious antecedents
and conjectural progeny.

1247
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:12,005
Cochise's words,
of course, sir, not mine.

1248
01:40:13,670 --> 01:40:15,625
That's a matter of opinion.

1249
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,356
He is worse than war.

1250
01:40:22,523 --> 01:40:23,800
He not only killed the men...

1251
01:40:24,808 --> 01:40:26,125
...but the women...

1252
01:40:26,285 --> 01:40:27,801
...and the children...

1253
01:40:27,962 --> 01:40:29,918
...and the old ones.

1254
01:40:33,258 --> 01:40:36,211
We looked to the great white father
for protection.

1255
01:40:37,584 --> 01:40:39,739
He gave us slow death.

1256
01:40:45,807 --> 01:40:48,041
We will not return
to your reservation...

1257
01:40:50,112 --> 01:40:51,349
...while that man is there...

1258
01:40:52,282 --> 01:40:53,638
...or anyone like him.

1259
01:40:56,469 --> 01:40:58,584
Send him away
and we will speak of peace.

1260
01:40:59,623 --> 01:41:01,338
If you do not send him away...

1261
01:41:02,178 --> 01:41:04,134
...there will be war.

1262
01:41:08,646 --> 01:41:10,322
And for each one of us
that you kill...

1263
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,913
- ...10 white men will die.
- Are you threatening us?

1264
01:41:15,074 --> 01:41:18,347
- Don't interrupt. It's an insult.
- I'll not be threatened. Beaufort.

1265
01:41:18,508 --> 01:41:21,941
No preliminary nonsense with him,
no ceremonial phrasing.

1266
01:41:22,101 --> 01:41:24,176
Straight from the shoulders.
Do you hear me?

1267

They're recalcitrant swine.
They must feel it.

1268
01:41:27,231 --> 01:41:28,707
He's only speaking the truth, sir.

1269

Is there anyone in this regiment
that understands an order?

1270
01:41:31,927 --> 01:41:34,942
- What does the colonel wish me to say?
- Tell him I find him without honor.

1271
01:41:35,693 --> 01:41:39,206
Tell him they're not talking to me
but to the United States government.

1272
01:41:39,237 --> 01:41:42,630
Tell him that government orders them
to return to their reservation.

1273

01:59:07,939 --> 01:59:09,295
That was a magnificent work.

1389
01:59:09,457 --> 01:59:13,090
There were massed columns of Apaches
in their war paint and feather bonnets...

1390
01:59:13,250 --> 01:59:16,124
...and here was Thursday,
leading his men in that heroic charge.

1391
01:59:16,284 --> 01:59:18,160
Correct in every detail.

1392
01:59:18,321 --> 01:59:19,996
He's become almost a legend already.

1393
01:59:20,157 --> 01:59:21,993
He's the hero
of every schoolboy in America.

1394
01:59:22,153 --> 01:59:23,549
But what of the men
who died with him?

1395
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:26,464
- Uh, what of Collingworth and...?
- Collingwood.

1396
01:59:26,495 --> 01:59:28,330
Oh, of course, Collingwood.

1397
01:59:28,621 --> 01:59:29,898
That's the ironic part of it.

1398
01:59:30,058 --> 01:59:33,250
We always remember the Thursdays,
but the others are forgotten.

1399
01:59:33,412 --> 01:59:34,928
You're wrong there.

1400
01:59:35,089 --> 01:59:37,683
They aren't forgotten
because they haven't died.

1401
01:59:38,203 --> 01:59:41,157
They're living. Right out there.

1402
01:59:41,317 --> 01:59:42,793
Collingwood and the rest.

1403
01:59:42,954 --> 01:59:46,027
And they'll keep on living
as long as the regiment lives.

1404
01:59:46,667 --> 01:59:51,218
Pay is $13 a month.
Their diet, beans and hay.

1405
01:59:51,378 --> 01:59:54,770
Maybe horsemeat
before this campaign is over.

1406
01:59:55,171 --> 02:00:00,161
Fight over cards or rotgut whiskey,
but share the last drop in their canteens.

1407
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:02,596
Faces may change...

1408
02:00:02,757 --> 02:00:04,353
...and names...

1409
02:00:04,513 --> 02:00:06,069
...but they're there.

1410
02:00:06,231 --> 02:00:07,667
They're the regiment.

1411
02:00:08,227 --> 02:00:09,983
The regular Army.

1412
02:00:10,143 --> 02:00:12,537
Now and 50 years from now.

1413
02:00:14,095 --> 02:00:15,771
They're better men
than they used to be.

1414
02:00:15,932 --> 02:00:17,887
Thursday did that.

1415
02:00:18,048 --> 02:00:20,682
He made it a command
to be proud of.

1416
02:00:21,402 --> 02:00:24,035
- The command is formed, sir.
- Thank you, sergeant major.

1417
02:00:24,196 --> 02:00:25,633
And now it's time to move.

1418
02:00:25,794 --> 02:00:27,709
- Questions, gentlemen?
REPORTER 2: No.

1419
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:29,386
REPORTER 3:
Thank you very much, colonel.

1420
02:00:30,744 --> 02:00:33,897
Gentlemen, this is my adjutant,
Lieutenant O'Rourke...

1421
02:00:34,058 --> 02:00:36,133
- ...who will take care of you.
- Gentlemen.

1422
02:00:36,294 --> 02:00:39,127
Mrs. Michael O'Rourke,
General Thursday's daughter.

1423
02:00:39,288 --> 02:00:41,922
- How do you do?
- And the Mrs. O'Rourke.

1424
02:00:42,083 --> 02:00:43,359
It's a pleasure, ma'am.

1425
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,474
And this is
Michael Thursday York O'Rourke...

1426
02:00:46,634 --> 02:00:49,947
...the best man in the regiment.
Aren't you, you scut?

1427
02:01:16,538 --> 02:01:18,613
YORK:
Forward face.

1428
02:01:23,924 --> 02:01:25,520
