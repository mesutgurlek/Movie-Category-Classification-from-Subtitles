Whatever the reason was, she hated me.

and I stumbled on the deck
of our barge into the water...

and I hollered for help up at Ma there.

and sees what's goin' on.

and comes swimmin' out to me.

And then, out of the dark,
around the bend...

comes bearing down on us.

starts cuttin' into him.

Pa holds me safe away from the blades.

what she says, looking right at me?

01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:48,470
Not for killing Shep they wasn't.

1087
01:20:48,553 --> 01:20:50,472
How do you know?
Now how do you know?

1088
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:54,100
Didn't they link up the very first stinkin' day
that they went with the rawhiders?

1089
01:20:54,184 --> 01:20:56,436
And who got Shep to hire Reb?

1090
01:20:58,438 --> 01:21:02,275
I'm saying that this wasn't
a simple case of self-defense.

1091
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:07,405
I'm saying that this was a case
of planned murder.

1092
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:14,329
Now we all know that Shep Horgan
was the best-loved man in the valley.

1093
01:21:15,622 --> 01:21:20,460
And we know that he gave
that sheepherding killer Jubal Troop a job.

1094
01:21:20,544 --> 01:21:23,129
A job. He made him a foreman.

1095
01:21:23,755 --> 01:21:26,091
Now what thanks does Shep get?

1096
01:21:27,259 --> 01:21:29,427
Troop went after his wife.

1097
01:21:30,428 --> 01:21:32,430
Do you remember -

1098
01:21:32,514 --> 01:21:36,726
Do you remember the first time that Shep
ever brought Mae down into the valley?

1099
01:21:37,269 --> 01:21:39,354
How proud he was, huh?

1100
01:21:40,647 --> 01:21:42,983
Well, he ain't proud no more.

1101
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:45,235
'Cause he's dead.

1102
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:48,613
Why?

1103
01:21:50,156 --> 01:21:53,994
Why? Because he set out
to defend his wife's honor...

1104
01:21:54,077 --> 01:21:57,414
like any decent, red-blooded man would.

1105
01:21:57,497 --> 01:21:59,249
Hey.

1106
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:01,042
Where's this Jube Troop now?

1107
01:22:01,126 --> 01:22:03,753
That's a very good question, Matt.

1108
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:07,173
That's a good question.

1109
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:11,720
Where is Jubal Troop now?

1110
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:14,347
I say he's hiding someplace.

1111
01:22:14,431 --> 01:22:16,725
Now, if he's hiding someplace...

1112
01:22:16,808 --> 01:22:19,352
then this can't be a simple case
of self-defense.

1113
01:22:19,436 --> 01:22:21,813
Otherwise, he wouldn't be hiding.

1114
01:22:23,607 --> 01:22:26,067
Does anyone know where he is?

1115
01:22:28,653 --> 01:22:29,946
Doc?

1116
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:33,199
Dr. Grant, you here?

1117
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,285
I'm right here.

1118
01:22:37,162 --> 01:22:39,873
Doc, did he come to you last night
and you sew him up?

1119
01:22:39,956 --> 01:22:42,125
No, but then, he'd know
I was a friend of Shep's.

1120
01:22:45,128 --> 01:22:46,129
Sam.

1121
01:22:46,963 --> 01:22:50,300
Sam, you're a friend of Jubal Troop, ain't ya?

1122
01:22:51,468 --> 01:22:53,553
Do you know where he is?

1123
01:22:53,637 --> 01:22:55,221
No, I don't.

1124
01:22:55,305 --> 01:22:58,350
I do know you got no right to go around
accusing a man of murder...

1125
01:22:58,433 --> 01:23:00,226
without he's here
to talk for hisself.

1126
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:04,731
That's all I'm asking, Sam. All I'm saying
is we should go out and get Jube. That's all.

1127
01:23:04,814 --> 01:23:08,735
Well, sure. Go get him.
String him up. No trial, no nothin'.

1128
01:23:08,818 --> 01:23:10,737
No, I ain't saying we should string him up.

1129
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:14,991
I ain't even saying we should pump him
full of lead from Shep's own gun.

1130
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:21,206
But I am saying that we ought to get him
before he lays his hands on somebody else's wife.

1131
01:23:22,165 --> 01:23:24,459
'Cause I don't think
he should get off scat-free...

1132
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:27,671
after killing the best-loved man
in this territory!

1133
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:32,467
Is anybody here who wasn't
a friend of Shep Horgan?

1134
01:23:36,012 --> 01:23:37,847
All right.

1135
01:23:39,349 --> 01:23:41,267
Now let's go find him.

1136
01:24:02,872 --> 01:24:07,001
You know, sometimes I think it's giving
the good Lord the worst of it...

1137
01:24:07,085 --> 01:24:09,546
to say he invented people.

1138
01:24:19,597 --> 01:24:22,559
Looks like a good hiding place.
Over there.

1139
01:25:58,029 --> 01:26:01,449
- Stop grieving so deep, Jube dear.
- [ Murmurs ]

1140
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:04,160
It wasn't as if you had
killing in your heart at all.

1141
01:26:05,328 --> 01:26:08,414
All you wanted to do
was stop him from killing.

1142
01:26:08,498 --> 01:26:10,458
Anybody would do that.

1143
01:26:11,459 --> 01:26:14,420
Oh, Jube dear, try to forget.

1144
01:26:15,255 --> 01:26:17,257
Just remember the good things.

1145
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:20,802
He knows you were grateful to him
for everything.

1146
01:26:21,803 --> 01:26:23,763
He knows you loved him.

1147
01:26:23,847 --> 01:26:26,766
- [ Murmurs ]
- Even now he knows that.

1148
01:26:29,769 --> 01:26:32,272
Say a prayer, Jube.

1149
01:26:32,355 --> 01:26:34,357
Let God help.

1150
01:26:36,192 --> 01:26:38,987
That's not gonna help.

1151
01:26:39,988 --> 01:26:42,198
Don't you understand? He's dead.

1152
01:26:44,617 --> 01:26:47,537
<i>I -</i>  I killed my best friend.

1153
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:18,526
I think maybe we got something.

1154
01:27:39,255 --> 01:27:41,132
He ain't in there.

1155
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:45,094
- You know where Jubal Troop is?
- Why, no, we don't.

1156
01:27:45,178 --> 01:27:48,556
- Well, where's the rest of them?
- I don't know.

1157
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,392
- Well, why'd you split up?
- Why shouldn't we?

1158
01:27:51,476 --> 01:27:54,145
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah.

1159
01:27:54,228 --> 01:27:57,523
Well, I guess you told me
what we wanted to know.

1160
01:27:57,607 --> 01:28:02,278
He's in one of them, all right. Now, we find
the right one, and we find Jubal Troop.

1161
01:28:02,362 --> 01:28:04,781
Come on, boy.
[ Clicks Tongue ] Go, boy.

1162
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:10,954
Shem oughta be warned.
If we knew where they'd be.

1163
01:28:11,037 --> 01:28:14,165
They'll be east -
the track we come by.

1164
01:28:14,248 --> 01:28:16,250
[ Clicks Tongue ]
I'll catch up with ya.

1165
01:28:52,578 --> 01:28:54,580
[ Blustering ]

1166
01:29:11,431 --> 01:29:13,933
Pinky: All right now,
did anybody find the right wagon?

1167
01:29:14,017 --> 01:29:15,351
Others:
No.

1168
01:29:15,435 --> 01:29:17,353
All right. The answer's simple, gents.

1169
01:29:18,396 --> 01:29:21,941
We stopped every rawhide wagon
except the right one.

1170
01:29:22,025 --> 01:29:24,610
Means the one we want is hid someplace.

1171
01:29:24,694 --> 01:29:26,696
Jake:
You men looking for Jube Troop?

1172
01:29:39,959 --> 01:29:41,711
You all right?

1173
01:29:43,046 --> 01:29:44,797
Where are the other wagons?

1174
01:29:44,881 --> 01:29:47,341
They've gone, but don't worry,
Reb and the folks are watching.

1175
01:29:47,425 --> 01:29:49,052
Watching what?

1176
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:52,388
Because of me? You expecting trouble?

1177
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:56,309
What are you plannin'?

1178
01:29:57,727 --> 01:30:00,438
I'm planning not to have
any of my trouble rub off on you.

1179
01:30:00,521 --> 01:30:03,357
Oh, Jube, you go running off because -

1180
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:06,903
because you think you're not wanted
or something terrible like that.

1181
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:11,491
You mustn't be ashamed needing somebody.
Everybody does.

1182
01:30:12,325 --> 01:30:14,368
You don't want to be alone again.

1183
01:30:15,453 --> 01:30:17,163
That's for sure.

1184
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:18,998
Another thing's for sure.

1185
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:22,668
With all my heart, it's sure I love you.

1186
01:30:24,212 --> 01:30:26,255
Please don't go.

1187
01:30:27,757 --> 01:30:30,551
You can't stick around
and watch somebody you love hurt.

1188
01:30:31,511 --> 01:30:33,513
That's why I'm going.

1189
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:52,281
- Jube, can you ride?
- Yes.

1190
01:30:52,365 --> 01:30:54,450
Saddle up his horse
as quick as you can.

1191
01:30:54,534 --> 01:30:56,661
Jube, they're coming up
over that hill after you.

1192
01:30:56,744 --> 01:30:59,622
Pinky and the Bar-Eight bunch -
40 or 50 men.

1193
01:30:59,705 --> 01:31:01,958
And that Judas Jake,
he's leading them right here to ya.

1194
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:04,544
- How much head start do I have?
- About four or five minutes. That's all.

1195
01:31:04,627 --> 01:31:07,130
You start running, Jube,
but where you gonna stop?

1196
01:31:07,213 --> 01:31:09,090
Stay with us.
We won't let 'em take ya.

1197
01:31:09,173 --> 01:31:11,843
Shem, you're the only friends I have.
I want to keep you healthy.

1198
01:31:11,926 --> 01:31:14,470
Now give me a few minutes head start,
and then lead them to me.

1199
01:31:14,554 --> 01:31:17,181
Lead 'em to ya? Your head broke?
Where you goin'?

1200
01:31:17,265 --> 01:31:19,559
- The ranch.
- Shep's ranch?

1201
01:31:19,642 --> 01:31:21,602
Man, they'll hang you from that corral gate.

1202
01:31:21,686 --> 01:31:24,105
The answer to why Shep Horgan
wanted to kill me is at the ranch.

1203
01:31:24,188 --> 01:31:25,731
If they take you, you can't help yourself.

1204
01:31:25,815 --> 01:31:27,733
You're not healed yet,
and your wound would break open.

1205
01:31:27,817 --> 01:31:30,236
- Not if I get the answer first.
- Can I talk to him private?

1206
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:31,320
Yeah.

1207
01:31:34,157 --> 01:31:36,117
Suppose she won't tell the truth.

1208
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,994
I couldn't help hearing
while you was fevered.

1209
01:31:38,077 --> 01:31:40,872
- She's gotta let them know.
- They don't care about her. it's you they hate.

1210
01:31:40,955 --> 01:31:43,040
- No.
- Oh, don't go.

1211
01:31:43,124 --> 01:31:46,419
If you do, I won't see you anymore - ever.
I know it.

1212
01:31:46,502 --> 01:31:50,006
- Oh, Jube dear, what could you prove?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1213
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:52,758
Just the truth. That's all.

1214
01:31:59,974 --> 01:32:02,935
- Take care of these folks, Reb.
- Reb: Guaranteed. Git!

1215
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:25,374
Line up like Jube's inside.
Maybe we can hold them off a while.

1216
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:27,877
They're almost here.

1217
01:32:28,711 --> 01:32:31,964
- Better crawl in that there wagon, Naomi.
- Mother: Daughter, this is men's work.

1218
01:32:32,048 --> 01:32:34,508
Naomi:
I got to see that Judas face of Jake.

1219
01:33:11,504 --> 01:33:14,090
- Hand him over.
- Who?

1220
01:33:14,173 --> 01:33:18,094
Who we come for.
This ain't no square dance, mister. Jubal Troop.

1221
01:33:18,177 --> 01:33:21,931
- What if we hand him over?
- You hand him over, then you don't get shot up.

1222
01:33:22,014 --> 01:33:24,100
I see you brought Judas with ya.

1223
01:33:25,434 --> 01:33:28,688
You've done what you set out to do.
Now get along.

1224
01:33:28,771 --> 01:33:31,565
And don't head for Pocatello.
We don't want you neither.

1225
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:39,448
Get.

1226
01:33:44,787 --> 01:33:48,874
Now let's get this straight. You say these folks hand
Jube Troop over to you, you won't beat 'em up.

1227
01:33:48,958 --> 01:33:51,127
- That's right.
- And if they don't, you will.

1228
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:52,211
Or worse.

1229
01:33:52,295 --> 01:33:55,298
What'll you do to Jube Troop
if they turn him over to ya? Beat him up?

1230
01:33:55,381 --> 01:33:58,384
Or worse? All 40 of ya?

1231
01:33:58,467 --> 01:34:01,637
You stopped being funny
exactly one minute ago.

1232
01:34:01,721 --> 01:34:03,848
It was you that threw the gun
that killed Shep.

1233
01:34:03,931 --> 01:34:05,683
Jube wasn't armed.

1234
01:34:05,766 --> 01:34:08,060
Since when can't a man defend his own life?

1235
01:34:08,144 --> 01:34:11,897
One of our people's been killed,
and his wife's been violated.

1236
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:14,150
- She tell you that?
- No, she didn't. Pinky said.

1237
01:34:14,233 --> 01:34:16,527
- Why don't you ask her that, cowboy?
- Ain't no need to ask her nothing!

1238
01:34:16,652 --> 01:34:20,698
We'll get what we want out of Troop!
<i>We'll</i>  beat it out of him! Now you get him out here!

1239
01:34:21,615 --> 01:34:23,326
He ain't in there.

1240
01:34:23,409 --> 01:34:25,619
Go ahead. Look, if you got a mind to.

1241
01:34:28,039 --> 01:34:30,166
Why the stall? Where you got him hid?

1242
01:34:31,167 --> 01:34:32,668
No place.

1243
01:34:33,753 --> 01:34:35,921
Jube's waiting for you, Pinky.

1244
01:34:36,005 --> 01:34:38,716
He's waiting for me.
Where is he waiting for me?

1245
01:34:38,799 --> 01:34:40,343
Shep's ranch.

1246
01:34:48,476 --> 01:34:49,769
You lyin'?

1247
01:34:50,644 --> 01:34:52,605
I don't lie, Pinky.

1248
01:34:52,688 --> 01:34:55,900
And to prove to you I'm not,
I'm gonna ride along right with you.

1249
01:34:55,983 --> 01:34:59,111
And if he ain't there,
you can hang me.

1250
01:35:05,993 --> 01:35:08,162
- Well?
- He ain't in there.

1251
01:35:08,245 --> 01:35:13,959
Pinky, Jube says he wants all these gents
to know the real answer to Shep's death.

1252
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:16,587
The real answer.

1253
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:18,964
The real answer, huh?

1254
01:35:19,048 --> 01:35:21,425
You know what that means?

1255
01:35:21,509 --> 01:35:25,721
It means he went back to Shep's ranch
to beat some lies out of Shep's widow.

1256
01:35:25,805 --> 01:35:28,391
And I say we should shoot him on sight.

1257
01:35:40,986 --> 01:35:43,072
All right. Let's go.

1258
01:37:01,609 --> 01:37:02,985
Mae?

1259
01:37:08,407 --> 01:37:09,575
Mae?

1260
01:37:26,342 --> 01:37:28,177
Mae?

1261
01:37:38,562 --> 01:37:39,813
Mae.

1262
01:37:44,693 --> 01:37:46,529
[ Mae Groans ]

1263
01:37:52,868 --> 01:37:55,704
It was Pinky.
He beat me.

1264
01:38:05,214 --> 01:38:07,800
I killed Shep...

1265
01:38:07,883 --> 01:38:10,302
just as much as if I'd shot him myself.

1266
01:38:12,513 --> 01:38:14,890
He believed the lie I told him about you.

1267

[ Hoof beats Approaching ]

1268
01:38:39,832 --> 01:38:41,542
Pinky:
Troop!

1269
01:38:43,752 --> 01:38:46,589
Oh, don't move me, Jube.
I'm awful bad hurt.

1270
01:38:47,965 --> 01:38:49,466
Pinky:
Troop!

1271
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:55,848
He's not gonna hurt you anymore, Mae.

1272
01:39:03,856 --> 01:39:05,566
Doc, Mrs. Horgan needs you.

1273
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:10,112
Sam, Carson, you want to help him?

1274
01:39:25,127 --> 01:39:27,921
What's the matter, Pinky?
Did you think she was dead?

1275
01:39:29,673 --> 01:39:33,052
Is that why you come back?
So you could say I did it?

1276
01:39:33,135 --> 01:39:34,637
Well, shoot me first.

1277

[ Horses Whinny ]

1278
01:39:49,318 --> 01:39:51,111
Mae Horgan's dead.

1279
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,995
It was Pinky, not Jube.

1280
01:40:00,537 --> 01:40:02,873
It was Pinky who wanted Shep's wife.

1281
01:40:02,956 --> 01:40:05,709
She wouldn't have him,
so he beat her.

1282
01:40:05,793 --> 01:40:07,378
She's dead.
