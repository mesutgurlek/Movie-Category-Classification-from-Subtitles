    Oh.  Mr. Searcy,            
    did you see me and old Sam  
    when we took on that injun ?

967
01:38:05,594 --> 01:38:08,996
No, I didn't.                   
But I don't reckon you was      
watchin' when I made that shot ?

968
01:38:09,064 --> 01:38:11,866
            Well, no, I wasn't. 
            But let me tell you.

969
01:38:11,934 --> 01:38:15,870
    I busted him with           
    some rocks, and then Sam,   
    he nailed him good.

        I'll bet he wishes      
        he never even thought   
        of runnin' off with me. 

972
01:38:22,127 --> 01:38:26,530
Now look, Arliss.               
It don't seem proper for a boy  
to brag on hisself.             

973
01:38:26,598 --> 01:38:28,766
        Why, this ain't no brag,
        Mr. Searcy.             

974
01:38:28,834 --> 01:38:32,070
        Every word              
        I'm about to tell you   
        is the gospel truth.    

975
01:38:32,137 --> 01:38:36,107
You see, the day we was caught, 
Travis and Lisbeth was scared,  

976
01:38:36,175 --> 01:38:38,092
        And Sam, he was hurt.   

977
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:41,662
        So I had to start out   
        fightin' them Injuns    
        all by myself.          

978
01:38:41,730 --> 01:38:46,350
    There was one injun took    
    a particular dislikin' to me
    right from the start,       

979
01:38:46,418 --> 01:38:49,253
            So I knew I had to  
            fix him proper.     

980
01:38:49,321 --> 01:38:52,824
    See, I had this little plan 
    right up here in my head,   

981
01:38:52,891 --> 01:38:55,126
        And one day             
        when he wasn't lookin', 

982
01:38:55,194 --> 01:38:58,729
        Why, I got me a club    
        and I busted it right   
        over his head.          

983
01:38:58,797 --> 01:39:03,534
Then dang them, they threw me   
right in a pond, but I fought   
'em off just the same.          

984
01:39:03,602 --> 01:39:06,871
You know, I never will forget   
the day they killed             
and ate Old Jumper.             

985
01:39:06,939 --> 01:39:11,209
I picked me up a tree branch    
and clubbed the injun right     
over the head and laid him low. 

986
01:39:11,277 --> 01:39:14,379
Then danged if I didn't         
have to fight off               
half a dozen of 'em.            

987
01:39:14,446 --> 01:39:17,047
        I'd have licked 'em too 
        if one of them hadn't--

to the ranch and get some grub ?

01:39:55,621 --> 01:40:00,491

    decided to make an injun out
    of me, 'cause of my bravery.
