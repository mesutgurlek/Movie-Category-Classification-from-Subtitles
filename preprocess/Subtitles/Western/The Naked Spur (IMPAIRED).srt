You want
something from me, mister?

This here's

You fixing to
meet somebody?

12
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:22,484
Meet somebody?
Who?

13
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:25,388
Wouldn't mind
if i did.

14
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:27,423
Wouldn't care
who he was

15
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:29,493
or where
he comes from or what he does.

16
00:02:29,494 --> 00:02:32,495
A man ought to always
mind his own business, i say.

17
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:38,034
Looks like
you're the one expecting company.

18
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:40,371
How long
you been here?

19
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:42,273
Been poking around
these hills

20
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:43,842
three or four
weeks now.

21
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:45,577
Got no calendar
to know exact.

22
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:48,312
Got nothing
to show for it either.

23
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:50,750
If you're ready
to talk some,

24
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:52,852
i'd appreciate
your putting that gun down.

25
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:54,953
You might
get bee stung or something,

26
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:57,489
but i'd be
just as dead.

27
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:04,597
Got some breakfast
coffee boiling.

28
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:06,767
You want some?

29
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:06,934
No.

asking after,

33

36

It ain't every

38
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:38,366
I ain't seen kansas
since before the war,

39
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:41,369
so i wouldn't know
you to look at.

You figure he's
back in these hills, mr. Kemp?

44
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:53,449
I lost his trail
this side of the river.

45
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:55,652
Did you see
any sign?

46
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:58,520
Hmm. Ran across
a dead fire the other day.

47
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:00,992
Where?

48
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:02,860
Back in there.

tell you sure.

You can tell me
better than that.

Maybe, if we
was going the same way,

but we ain't.

$20 here.

we find him.

Start out by showing
me that dead fire.

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,128
Does this fella know
you're after him?

63
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:36,663
He knows.

64
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:38,999
Then he might be
waiting behind some rock,

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,934
waiting for us
to ride up in front of his gun.

66
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,804
Uh-huh.
He might.

warm yesterday.

for sure.

got company?

71

an extra horse.

00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:15,271
But there might be
two of them waiting for us, huh?

you held a gun on me.

he sneaks down
some night and gets us.

in kansas for that cheek.

324
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,457
Aw, you're not gonna
be mad at me all the way, are you?

325
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,693
Come on, i'll
make it up to you.

326
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,363
What are you
doing tonight?

327
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:18,370
You're having quite
a time, aren't you?

328
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,639
Aw, come on,
loosen up. Spring is here.

329
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,608
It's going to be
a long, lonely ride to abilene,

330
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:25,911
and being as
jesse's too old,

331
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,346
i'll toss you
for her.

332
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,214
Right now she's
probably telling ben

333
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:31,451
how to cut
your throat.

334
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:34,453
You don't think
that pretty little thing would...

335
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,722
hey, you two!
Break it up there!

336
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:55,944
Arrgh.

337
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:16,465
Here, try it
with this.

338
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,467
Come on,
don't be stubborn.

339
00:23:18,468 --> 00:23:20,203
Press it against
your face.

340
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:21,337
Get away
from me!

341
00:23:21,338 --> 00:23:22,573
Like it better
this way?

342
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:25,107
Let me go!
Let me alone!

343
00:23:27,111 --> 00:23:29,279
If she bothers you
so much,

344
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,948
why don't you
tie her up

345
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:31,883
and be done
with it?

346
00:23:31,884 --> 00:23:34,151
No bother.
I like to wrestle with her.

347
00:23:34,152 --> 00:23:37,120
You're a big man
for beating up women, ain't you?

348
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:39,591
And you're
no better.

349
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:39,791
Lina.

350
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:52,336
That jackass started
a misery in my back.

351
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:55,273
Can you do me?

352
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:00,679
Don't get them fired up
all the time.

353
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,514
Best thing on our side
is your pretty face.

354
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:06,985
They're men, honey,
and you ain't. Remember that.

355
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:07,820
I'm not going to...

356
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,589
i ain't asking you
to marry them.

357
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,924
The more they look
at you,

358
00:24:10,925 --> 00:24:13,592
the less they'll
be seeing of me.

359
00:24:15,396 --> 00:24:15,563
Ahh!

360
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,798
You sure got her
trained, ben.

361
00:24:19,468 --> 00:24:20,668
I'll tell you,

362
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,336
if i was to have
a daughter,

363
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,305
i wouldn't want
her no different than lina here.

364
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:27,809
Except she shouldn't
have such sharp nails.

365
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,078
Maybe not so
much temper.

366
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,279
Hold still!

367
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,514
Honey,
you remember

368
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,182
those cigars
i got put away?

369
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:36,085
I could do
with one now.

370
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:36,319
Get two.

371
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:39,887
I don't smoke.

372
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:43,925
Any more at home
like her?

373
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:47,295
She got no home,
that's the trouble.

374
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:49,766
Ma died in 'paso
couple months ago.

375
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,935
And she come
up north hunting her pa.

376
00:24:51,936 --> 00:24:53,736
He was dead
and planted

377
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:54,370
when she
got here.

378
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:57,339
So of course
you felt obliged to look out for her.

379
00:24:57,542 --> 00:25:00,209
Son, her pa was
my best friend.

380
00:25:09,554 --> 00:25:10,054
Hey, jesse!

381
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:12,889
Why don't you
get a pan and do it right?

382
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:15,360
What do you
know about gold?

383
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:16,528
Just what
i heard.

384
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:17,362
Come on,
let's get riding.

385
00:25:17,363 --> 00:25:19,932
What's
the crazy hurry? We can camp here.

386
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:20,933
That's right,
howie.

387
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:23,135
A day more or less
won't change the price on me.

388
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:26,170
'Course, it might give
one of you boys time to think.

389
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:28,874
Plain arithmetic.

390
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,776
Money splits better two ways
instead of three.

391
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,425
Come on!

392
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:05,346
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!

393
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:39,584
How can you breathe
that stinking rope?

394
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:42,352
Kills the taste of
your cooking, jesse.

395
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:45,322
Nothing like
a good woman to stir a pot.

396
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:48,327
Nothing like
a good woman.

397
00:26:48,328 --> 00:26:50,629
I guess you got
the years

398
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,331
to know better than
any of us, jesse.

399
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:54,333
Did you ever marry
one of them?

400
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:57,001
Never had to
with my good looks.

401
00:26:58,438 --> 00:27:00,907
No sense in asking roy
here about women.

402
00:27:00,908 --> 00:27:02,942
He'd keep us
up all night.

403
00:27:02,943 --> 00:27:05,710
Well, right now i'm sort
of in-between.

404
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:10,515
Well, looks like we're
a herd of bachelors,

405
00:27:11,018 --> 00:27:11,285
even kemp.

406
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:14,488
Never should have
marched off to war, howie.

407
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:17,390
Should have stayed home
and married the girl.

408
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:19,160
'Course, none of
my business.

409
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:21,728
That's right.
It's none of your business.

410
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:23,497
Come on, let's
get this stuff cleaned up.

411
00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:26,199
All right, girlie.
Grab a handful.

412
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:28,169
I'll do mine
and ben's.

413
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,304
You'll do what
i tell you,

414
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:31,606
that's what
you'll do.

415
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:31,807
Women!

416
00:27:35,544 --> 00:27:38,345
I think
i'll go along to protect her.

417
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:45,788
Sure works
on me,

418
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,390
the way his eyes
hang on her.

419
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:51,426
Fancy-talking
eastern boy.

420
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:53,362
Trouble is, talk's
just the beginning

421
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:55,031
with wild kids
like that... you watch.

422
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:57,834
When he's ready,
he'll reach out and take,

423
00:27:57,835 --> 00:28:00,336
and who's
to stop him?

424
00:28:02,373 --> 00:28:02,540
Ahh.

425
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:09,012
Did you think
i was going to jump you?

426
00:28:09,281 --> 00:28:10,715
That's right.

427
00:28:10,716 --> 00:28:13,350
No, no. I was
just uncramping.

428
00:28:16,155 --> 00:28:18,657
You look almost sorry
i didn't.

429
00:28:18,658 --> 00:28:20,993
Yeah, killing me
in self-defense

430
00:28:20,994 --> 00:28:23,828
is a lot better than
killing me for money.

431
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:26,632
Well,
it's your choice, ben.

432
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:29,300
A bullet right here
on the trail

433
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,938
or a rope in abilene.

434
00:28:31,939 --> 00:28:34,840
Choosing a way to die...
what's the difference?

435
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:37,910
Choosing a way to live,

436
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:39,546
that's the hard part.

437
00:28:39,547 --> 00:28:42,381
That's what's eating you,
ain't it, howie?

438
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,051
There's nothing
eating me.

439
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:46,786
Somebody was bound
to collect on you.

440
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:47,856
Maybe.

441
00:28:48,623 --> 00:28:51,158
I calculated some
horse-thieving scum

442
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:53,826
would want
the price on my hide,

443
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:55,930
but not you, howie.

444
00:28:55,931 --> 00:28:57,598
Oh, why don't you
shut up?

445
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,534
Not a man of your leanings,
not a ranching man.

446
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:02,671
I don't deny
you got a dirty deal,

447
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:05,506
but... ah... the things a gal
can do to a man.

448
00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:11,746
Aw, shut up!

449
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,938
Hold it up here!

450
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,342
Might save a day
if we went over instead of around.

451
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,378
A day might make
the difference.

452
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,316
Better take
a look first to find some kind of trail.

453
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:46,883
Wait, i got
some glasses.

454
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:55,794
I knew you had your nuggets
hid somewhere under me.

455
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:58,030
I wouldn't be
putting up with you

456
00:29:58,031 --> 00:29:59,765
if i had nuggets
to take back.

457
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:01,234
Let me get in there.

458
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:04,103
Funny you ain't had
no luck in this country.

459
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:08,206
Fella i know struck gold
just north of here,

460
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:10,877
half a mountain of it
almost.

461
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:12,879
What fella was that?

462
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,614
Fella i know.

463
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:16,317
Only thing,
he had more trouble getting it out of the ground

464
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:19,185
than he had finding it,
that's what i hear.

465
00:30:19,888 --> 00:30:21,489
He don't know much.

466
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,090
Got them from
an officer fella.

467
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:25,860
Swapped them even
for a fayute tomahawk.

468
00:30:25,861 --> 00:30:28,662
Weren't really fayute,
i made it myself.

469
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:28,930
Ha ha ha!

470
00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:32,666
I had you figured
for a horse trader.

471
00:30:33,302 --> 00:30:35,803
[Hoofbeats approaching]

472
00:30:37,674 --> 00:30:37,874
Jesse!

473
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:41,376
Keep your eye
on him, roy!

474
00:30:47,117 --> 00:30:49,852
Mind if i get off
and stand a while?

475
00:30:51,088 --> 00:30:51,356
Go ahead.

476
00:30:54,758 --> 00:30:57,093
You can, too.

477
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:04,433
They gone up higher
to look ahead?

478
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:07,804
Oh, that man could do that
with his own life.

479
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:11,241
Maybe if i'd seen
what was ahead when i was younger,

480

00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,641
Given my choice,
i'll take hand-panning

644
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:10,377
and running water
naturally,

645
00:45:10,378 --> 00:45:13,312
especially when
you're working alone like i do.

646
00:45:13,748 --> 00:45:14,915
Of course, when you
get a strike

647
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:17,684
in high country...
like here, for instance...

648
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:20,121
your big problem
is getting the water

649
00:45:20,122 --> 00:45:21,622
to where
you're digging.

650
00:45:21,623 --> 00:45:24,391
Yeah. That's the trouble
my friend had.

651
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:27,595
Ground full of gold
and no water to work it...

652
00:45:28,063 --> 00:45:28,230
hey.

653
00:45:28,697 --> 00:45:30,131
Now maybe
you'll shut up!

654
00:45:30,132 --> 00:45:32,200
I've been meaning
to ask...

655
00:45:32,201 --> 00:45:34,403
you talk
like you seen

656
00:45:34,404 --> 00:45:37,106
this fella's mine
with your own eyes.

657
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:39,407
Just heard.

658
00:45:39,442 --> 00:45:41,176
Never hit it,
huh, jesse?

659
00:45:41,177 --> 00:45:43,112
Nothing worth
the mention.

660
00:45:43,113 --> 00:45:45,780
Seems i been looking
all my life.

661
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,918
All my life.

662
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:49,318
That's a long time

663
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:50,453
to look
for something.

664
00:45:50,454 --> 00:45:53,288
Maybe you been looking
in the wrong places.

665
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:56,126
Fella says there's
gold in the valley,

666
00:45:56,127 --> 00:45:57,594
i go to
the valley.

667
00:45:57,595 --> 00:45:59,930
Fella says dig here,
i dig.

668
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:02,666
Fella says
there's a rush on to the north,

669
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:03,935
i go north.

670
00:46:03,936 --> 00:46:06,502
In '49,
run to california.

671
00:46:06,605 --> 00:46:09,473
Still remember...
spent good money for maps.

672
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:11,443
Even made
my own maps.

673
00:46:11,444 --> 00:46:14,046
I've seen fellas
too drunk to walk

674
00:46:14,047 --> 00:46:16,448
fall on their face
and find gold,

675
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:18,783
but never me.

676
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:22,020
Hey, jesse!

677
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:24,321
Where's roy?

678
00:46:25,024 --> 00:46:27,193
He rode off
before dawn.

679
00:46:27,194 --> 00:46:28,561
Didn't say where.

680
00:46:28,562 --> 00:46:30,229
That's enough
shaving.

681
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:32,465
Give me that.

682
00:46:32,466 --> 00:46:34,800
Drop it there.

683
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:42,808
Well, you slept
yourself out.

684
00:46:43,511 --> 00:46:46,179
Must be halfway
to noon almost.

685
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,915
Why didn't
somebody wake me?

686
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:49,684
What's everybody
lying around for?

687
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:49,851
Oh!

688
00:46:50,652 --> 00:46:53,320
That tells you
better than me.

689
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:58,026
You get him
some breakfast.

690
00:46:58,027 --> 00:47:00,761
You can change the wrapping,
girlie.

691
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:01,864
Why me?

692
00:47:02,499 --> 00:47:03,765
Because i say so!

693
00:47:03,766 --> 00:47:04,966
Don't fuss
all the time!

694
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:06,001
Hold on, jesse.

695
00:47:06,002 --> 00:47:08,004
This girl's been up
half the night

696
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:09,071
taking care of him.

697
00:47:09,072 --> 00:47:11,439
She's wore out.

698
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:14,175
Never mind, ben.

699
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:16,646
Here, i'll do it.

700
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:16,947
Lay still!

701
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:18,981
You don't have to.

702
00:47:18,982 --> 00:47:21,283
I'll do it!

703
00:47:23,855 --> 00:47:25,856
You sat up with me?

704
00:47:25,857 --> 00:47:26,057
Yeah.

705
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:27,058
Why?

706
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:28,225
Somebody had to.

707
00:47:28,226 --> 00:47:30,628
You was raving so,
no one could sleep.

708
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:31,228
Why should you care?

709
00:47:31,229 --> 00:47:34,330
I don't. I'd have
done it for a dog, if he was suffering.

710
00:47:34,466 --> 00:47:34,733
Thank you.

711
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,767
You're welcome.

712
00:47:38,103 --> 00:47:40,804
You said i was raving.
What about?

713
00:47:41,807 --> 00:47:44,175
Nothing
that made sense.

714
00:47:44,176 --> 00:47:45,843
You thought
i was your girl.

715
00:47:45,844 --> 00:47:47,646
You kept calling me mary.

716
00:47:47,647 --> 00:47:49,347
You were really
out of your head.

717
00:47:49,348 --> 00:47:51,784
We ain't nothing alike,
mary and me.

718
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,418
At least that's what
ben says.

719
00:47:53,419 --> 00:47:55,353
Ben's just like all
the rest of them.

720
00:47:55,354 --> 00:47:56,255
He never even
met her.

721
00:47:56,256 --> 00:47:57,390
Well, he knows
what she did!

722
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:58,357
What she did's
her business.

723
00:47:58,358 --> 00:48:00,260
She had no business
selling your ranch!

724
00:48:00,261 --> 00:48:01,161
All right,
you're different.

725
00:48:01,162 --> 00:48:02,728
You would have
done it different.

726
00:48:02,729 --> 00:48:04,430
Let's let it go.

727
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:07,066
How do you mean,
i'm different?

728
00:48:08,335 --> 00:48:10,803
I mean
you got a man.

729
00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:13,507
At least
you stick to him.

730
00:48:13,508 --> 00:48:14,741
He's not my man!

731
00:48:14,742 --> 00:48:16,143
Well, you're
with him, ain't you?

732
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:17,144
Not like you mean!

733
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:19,612
All right.
Forget it.

734
00:48:23,586 --> 00:48:26,320
What are you doing
with ben, anyway?

735
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:29,323
You expect to run
and hide forever?

736
00:48:30,259 --> 00:48:31,960
Ben was taking me
to california.

737
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:33,662
He was going to
start new.

738
00:48:33,663 --> 00:48:35,396
Start new at what?

739
00:48:35,397 --> 00:48:38,299
Ranching, maybe.
He knows a lot about cattle.

740
00:48:39,168 --> 00:48:40,669
Yeah.
Other people's cattle.

741
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,305
Did you ever think
for a minute

742
00:48:44,274 --> 00:48:47,175
that ben had the temper
to settle on the land,

743
00:48:47,745 --> 00:48:50,345
to clear it,
to build on it,

744
00:48:50,914 --> 00:48:52,616
to bring in the cattle

745
00:48:52,617 --> 00:48:55,284
and nurse them through
the winter

746
00:48:55,353 --> 00:48:57,786
and round up strays,

747
00:48:59,423 --> 00:49:01,158
brand calves?

748
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:02,793
Starting new?

749
00:49:02,794 --> 00:49:05,463
The only thing
ben will start is trouble.

750
00:49:05,464 --> 00:49:07,732
He's wild, sure,

751
00:49:07,733 --> 00:49:09,968
like my father
used to be.

752
00:49:09,969 --> 00:49:13,170
But they didn't do
1 of the 10 things people blamed them for!

753
00:49:13,205 --> 00:49:15,173
He's mean,
he was born mean,

754
00:49:15,174 --> 00:49:17,208
and you know he
was born mean.

755
00:49:17,209 --> 00:49:18,209
He's treated me
decent!

756
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,511
Well, that's more
than he's done for most people.

757
00:49:19,512 --> 00:49:22,181
I've never seen him
hurt no one except in a fair fight.

758
00:49:22,182 --> 00:49:23,215
Sure, i know, sure.

759
00:49:23,216 --> 00:49:23,949
And who are you
to talk?

760
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:26,051
You didn't track him
all this way just because he's mean!

761
00:49:26,052 --> 00:49:26,719
Never said i did.

762
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,789
There's a lot
of outlaws riding free, with no one after them.

763
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:30,823
Ben could have killed
a dozen men,

764
00:49:30,824 --> 00:49:32,692
and you wouldn't have
looked twice...

765
00:49:32,693 --> 00:49:35,294
if it wasn't for
the reward!

766
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:49,475
Where have you been?

767
00:49:50,012 --> 00:49:51,145
How's the leg?

768
00:49:51,146 --> 00:49:53,813
Here you are.
Breakfast in bed.

769
00:49:56,552 --> 00:49:57,585
What's this?

770
00:49:57,586 --> 00:50:00,289
You better eat it
before we tell you.

771
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,291
I made a map
of the trail ahead. Here, take a look.

772
00:50:03,993 --> 00:50:06,094
I know the way.

773
00:50:06,095 --> 00:50:06,396
Hey, look.

774
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:09,665
Here's this
pony back ridge

775
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:11,734
marked along
this stretch of trees.

776
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:14,803
You follow these
mountains right down to the big river,

777
00:50:15,206 --> 00:50:17,872
and we'll meet
on the other side.

778
00:50:18,575 --> 00:50:18,843
Meet who?

779
00:50:19,009 --> 00:50:21,177
What he means,
all of you go on ahead,

780
00:50:21,178 --> 00:50:24,079
and i use this map
to catch up with you later.

781
00:50:25,717 --> 00:50:26,450
That's right,
isn't it?

782
00:50:26,451 --> 00:50:29,552
It's the only smart way.
Riding alone, he can make up time

783
00:50:29,921 --> 00:50:31,722
it would take us
days to cover,

784
00:50:31,723 --> 00:50:34,190
and the rain's coming.

785
00:50:34,693 --> 00:50:35,927
Well, jesse,
what do you think?

786
00:50:35,928 --> 00:50:38,229
I'm thinking if
something goes wrong

787
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,597
and you don't
meet up with us,

788
00:50:39,598 --> 00:50:42,466
i stand to gain from it
as much as roy here.

789
00:50:42,935 --> 00:50:44,769
That's
a dirty idea!

790
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:47,671
I ain't much proud of it,
but it's the truth.

791
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:50,909
Won't be that way with me
is all i can promise.

792
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,845
As soon as we
get across,

793
00:50:52,846 --> 00:50:55,414
we wait for you
on the other side.

794
00:50:55,415 --> 00:50:58,149
You got jesse's word
on it, and mine.

795
00:51:11,165 --> 00:51:13,233
Here. This is yours.

796
00:51:13,234 --> 00:51:15,602
Come on, let's get
the horses ready.

797
00:51:15,603 --> 00:51:16,436
I'm riding with you.

798
00:51:16,437 --> 00:51:18,071
What are you you
trying to do,

799
00:51:18,072 --> 00:51:18,873
kill yourself?

800
00:51:18,874 --> 00:51:20,408
I ain't gonna
cheat you.

801
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:21,542
You know,
your trouble is

802
00:51:21,543 --> 00:51:23,778
you just think of
one thing at a time.

803
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:25,513

01:07:38,259 --> 01:07:38,625
All right.

968
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:40,661
Ohh!

969
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:43,329
Leave it be!
It's getting so

970
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:46,331
i don't know which way
to point this no more.

971
01:07:46,701 --> 01:07:48,536
How many chances
does he get?

972
01:07:48,537 --> 01:07:51,404
Is this part of
your deal with her?

973
01:07:52,174 --> 01:07:52,541
I didn't...

974
01:07:52,841 --> 01:07:56,009
you didn't keep me busy
while he was making his break?

975
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:00,315
Nah, it just
happened that way.

976
01:08:00,316 --> 01:08:03,016
It just happened
that way.

977
01:08:53,873 --> 01:08:56,275
This is no good.
Any more shortcuts?

978
01:08:56,276 --> 01:08:58,912
[Jesse]
There's no sense stewin' about it.

979
01:08:58,913 --> 01:09:01,513
We got here late,
and that's it.

980
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:03,883
That's the time you cost us!
If you'd listened to me...

981
01:09:03,884 --> 01:09:06,185
i'll listen to
you now if you got any ideas

982
01:09:06,186 --> 01:09:07,820
about how to
get across here.

983
01:09:07,821 --> 01:09:09,223
You can't
get across that.

984
01:09:09,224 --> 01:09:11,558
You got to go
downstream a ways.

985
01:09:11,559 --> 01:09:11,892
How far?

986
01:09:12,526 --> 01:09:14,895
Oh, four or five days,
if we make time.

987
01:09:14,896 --> 01:09:17,097
We can swim this,
so let's start now!

988
01:09:17,098 --> 01:09:19,266
I'll take the point
if you're afraid.

989
01:09:19,267 --> 01:09:21,335
Least i got the sense
to be afraid.

990
01:09:21,336 --> 01:09:22,237
Besides,
what about her?

991
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,439
She wouldn't
last two minutes in that current.

992
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,142
You want to go downstream?
Take her with you.

993
01:09:27,143 --> 01:09:29,811
What if ben gets
washed away?

994
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:31,279
Then we got nothing.

995
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,781
I bow to your
superior wisdom.

996
01:09:32,782 --> 01:09:35,217
I promise you, jesse,
he'll get across.

997
01:09:35,218 --> 01:09:36,551
One way
or the other.

998
01:09:36,552 --> 01:09:37,386
Hey! Wait a minute!

999
01:09:37,387 --> 01:09:39,388
I'll try the river,
but not like this.

1000
01:09:39,389 --> 01:09:40,722
Yes, like this!
Why not?

1001
01:09:40,723 --> 01:09:43,591
We'll go downstream
before we cross.

1002
01:09:46,129 --> 01:09:48,331
What are you
worried about? Your girl?

1003
01:09:48,332 --> 01:09:51,233
Don't tell me you're
worried about him!

1004
01:09:53,804 --> 01:09:55,839
Why? It's
no different from the rope in abilene.

1005
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,308
You knew you were
gonna bring him back to die

1006
01:09:58,309 --> 01:10:00,478
when you started
after him. You know that now.

1007
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:03,214
That hasn't changed.
He's not a man.

1008
01:10:03,215 --> 01:10:04,548
He's a sack
of money.

1009
01:10:04,549 --> 01:10:07,185
That's why
we're all here... especially you!

1010
01:10:07,186 --> 01:10:09,953
Why don't you
face up to it!

1011
01:12:05,146 --> 01:12:08,012
I don't suppose either of you object

1012
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:11,016
to stopping the night here.

1013
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:14,486
Yeah, i didn't think so.

1014
01:12:18,092 --> 01:12:18,393
L-i...

1015
01:12:23,432 --> 01:12:25,767
hey, lina, honey.

1016
01:12:25,768 --> 01:12:28,301
It's my back again.

1017
01:12:28,571 --> 01:12:30,272
Can you do me?

1018
01:12:30,273 --> 01:12:32,574
Let me do you this time.

1019
01:12:32,575 --> 01:12:35,376
Start fixing for a fire, girlie.

1020
01:12:37,747 --> 01:12:39,682
How do you
like your rubbin'?

1021
01:12:39,683 --> 01:12:42,184
Up and down
or side to side?

1022
01:12:42,185 --> 01:12:44,553
Hey! You don't
have to do that.

1023
01:12:44,554 --> 01:12:46,856
Better look
after your partners.

1024
01:12:46,857 --> 01:12:47,991
Partners, uhh.

1025
01:12:47,992 --> 01:12:50,126
If i didn't need
a grubstake,

1026
01:12:50,127 --> 01:12:53,162
i'd have walked out
on this deal long ago.

1027
01:12:53,631 --> 01:12:54,698
It's too bad.

1028
01:12:54,699 --> 01:12:56,667
If you'd been lucky
like my friend...

1029
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:58,635
and i've had about
enough of that, too.

1030
01:12:58,636 --> 01:13:00,804
You got no friend
found gold around here.

1031
01:13:00,805 --> 01:13:01,738
You're talking
about yourself!

1032
01:13:01,739 --> 01:13:05,041
I knowed i shouldn't
have shot off my mouth in front of you.

1033
01:13:06,244 --> 01:13:06,911
Quit playacting.

1034
01:13:06,912 --> 01:13:09,746
You wanted me to
know it all along,

1035
01:13:10,215 --> 01:13:12,749
so let's get at it.

1036
01:13:13,819 --> 01:13:15,487
You tell me
where to dig,

1037
01:13:15,488 --> 01:13:18,522
and i'll see
that your gal is provided for.

1038
01:13:18,692 --> 01:13:20,258
Don't try to
horse-trade me, jesse.

1039
01:13:20,259 --> 01:13:23,495
I ain't gonna tell
where my gold is, but i'll show you.

1040
01:13:24,964 --> 01:13:28,200
I knew that's what
you've been scratchin' for all along.

1041
01:13:28,635 --> 01:13:30,837
Trouble is,
i don't trust you

1042
01:13:30,838 --> 01:13:32,839
no more
than i trust them.

1043
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,173
You don't
have to trust nobody.

1044
01:13:34,174 --> 01:13:36,843
Even if you don't
fancy my gold mine,

1045
01:13:36,844 --> 01:13:39,413
you still got me
all to yourself.

1046
01:13:39,414 --> 01:13:41,048
That's sayin'
i trust you.

1047
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:43,717
Say i tell you
where my gold is,

1048
01:13:43,718 --> 01:13:45,618
you might still
turn me in.

1049
01:13:45,619 --> 01:13:48,421
If i make a deal,
i stick by it.

1050
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:53,060
Least i wouldn't
have any partners

1051
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:54,695
to worry about.

1052
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:55,064
'Cept me.

1053
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,232
What do you mean, you?

1054
01:13:57,233 --> 01:13:59,234
If i did it...
now, just if...

1055
01:13:59,235 --> 01:14:00,602
it would be
an even swap.

1056
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,804
You'd go loose,
i'd get the gold mine.

1057
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,005
That ain't fair,
jesse.

1058
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:06,840
I got a right to
some of that gold.

1059
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:09,910
Fair or no,
it's the only deal i'd make...

1060
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,914
and it's a poor deal,
no matter.

1061
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:09,676
Same deal.
I'll trade you even up.

1062
01:15:09,677 --> 01:15:11,678
Your neck
for that gold.

1063
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:12,046
Yes or no?

1064
01:15:12,547 --> 01:15:15,149
I ain't fixed for
bargaining, jesse.

1065
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:17,583
You know that.

1066
01:15:19,087 --> 01:15:21,988
Come on, then.
I got two horses ready.

1067
01:15:23,091 --> 01:15:24,759
I'll get lina.

1068
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,528
No. She ain't part
of the deal.

1069
01:15:27,996 --> 01:15:30,497
She goes with me.

1070
01:15:31,367 --> 01:15:33,836
If i'm gonna be
broke,

1071
01:15:33,837 --> 01:15:36,537
i ain't gonna be
lonesome.

1072
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:39,808
Get her up, then.

1073
01:15:39,809 --> 01:15:42,544
Remember,
i'm watching you.

1074
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:52,657
Shh.

1075
01:15:53,391 --> 01:15:53,658
Shh.

1076
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:56,226
I'll tell you later.

1077
01:15:56,227 --> 01:15:56,561
Come on.

1078
01:16:24,892 --> 01:16:25,225
Snake!

1079
01:16:26,526 --> 01:16:26,827
Snake!

1080
01:16:27,427 --> 01:16:29,895
Where? Where?

1081
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:33,433
Whoa! Ben, hey!

1082
01:16:33,434 --> 01:16:35,901
[Horse whinnies]

1083
01:16:37,038 --> 01:16:39,906
Fun's over.
Get down off that horse.

1084
01:16:40,007 --> 01:16:42,508
I said off!
Come on! Move!

1085
01:16:42,509 --> 01:16:43,810
You all right,
honey?

1086
01:16:43,811 --> 01:16:46,646
You got the gun.
What do you care?

1087
01:16:47,482 --> 01:16:49,483
You're all right.

1088
01:16:49,484 --> 01:16:51,652
Get movin'.

1089
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:53,187
I got it comin'.

1090
01:16:53,188 --> 01:16:55,156
Do business
with the devil,

1091
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:57,559
and you'll get it
every time.

1092
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,428
Ain't it the truth?

1093
01:16:59,429 --> 01:16:59,795
Get goin'!

1094
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:03,530
Lina, honey,
you take the horse.

1095
01:17:09,305 --> 01:17:11,773
Hold it, jesse.

1096
01:17:14,578 --> 01:17:15,911
You better
get goin', ben.

1097
01:17:15,912 --> 01:17:17,813
The other two
will be along any minute.

1098
01:17:17,814 --> 01:17:20,483
You mean!! We
better get goin', don't you, honey?

1099
01:17:20,484 --> 01:17:22,852
If it suits you,
i'll settle for goin'.

1100
01:17:22,853 --> 01:17:25,955
I don't fancy
a friend with a gun in his hand.

1101
01:17:27,091 --> 01:17:28,392
Course,
i don't suppose

1102
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:31,327
ben would be
fool enough to shoot it.

1103
01:17:31,329 --> 01:17:33,497
Be heard
20 mile or more.

1104
01:17:33,498 --> 01:17:35,199
Who's talking
about shooting?

1105
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,702
Leave him with
the burro, ben.

1106
01:17:37,703 --> 01:17:40,137
You don't need him.
Please!

1107
01:17:40,138 --> 01:17:42,006
I'm just thinking
that...

1108
01:17:42,007 --> 01:17:44,841
from up there,
a man could pick off

1109
01:17:44,944 --> 01:17:47,844
anything that moved
in this clearing.

1110
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,414
The only trouble is,

1111
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:51,883
there's nothing to
stop a man,

1112
01:17:51,884 --> 01:17:54,386
make him hold up
for a while.

1113
01:17:54,387 --> 01:17:57,555
Ben, i got to talk
a different way now, i know that,

1114
01:17:58,825 --> 01:18:02,060
but that gold mine
still ain't gonna do you much good.

1115
01:18:03,664 --> 01:18:04,764
I'm thinkin'...

1116
01:18:04,765 --> 01:18:07,566
thinkin's your
weak spot, jesse.

1117
01:18:09,537 --> 01:18:11,805
Here, lina.
Hold the horses.

1118
01:18:11,806 --> 01:18:14,273
Leave the burro.

1119
01:18:20,949 --> 01:18:21,216
Ben!

1120
01:18:21,883 --> 01:18:22,218
Ben! No!

1121
01:18:25,487 --> 01:18:28,288
You had no reason
to kill him.

1122
01:18:28,557 --> 01:18:30,659
He couldn't

You killed that man in
abilene, like kemp said!

something awful.
