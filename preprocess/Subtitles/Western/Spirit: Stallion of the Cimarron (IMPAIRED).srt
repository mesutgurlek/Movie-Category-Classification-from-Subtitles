Not as tall as the Cheyenne;

# I had a dream #

1363
01:20:57,933 --> 01:21:01,266
# Of the wide-open prairie #

1364
01:21:05,774 --> 01:21:09,540
# I had a dream #

1365
01:21:09,611 --> 01:21:12,603
# Of the pale morning sky #

1366
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:21,055
# I had a dream #

1367
01:21:21,123 --> 01:21:27,062
#That we flew on golden wings #

1368
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:30,394
#And we were the same #

1369
01:21:30,465 --> 01:21:33,400
#Just the same #

1370
01:21:33,468 --> 01:21:35,800
#You and I #

1371
01:21:39,975 --> 01:21:43,741
# Follow your heart #

1372
01:21:43,812 --> 01:21:47,304
# Little child of the west wind #

1373
01:21:51,486 --> 01:21:55,422
# Follow the voice #

1374
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:58,482
#That's calling you home #

1375
01:22:02,831 --> 01:22:06,858
# Follow your dreams #

1376
01:22:06,935 --> 01:22:12,874
# But always remember me #

1377
01:22:12,941 --> 01:22:15,432
# I am your brother #

1378
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:21,613
#Yeah, under the sun #

1379
01:22:25,787 --> 01:22:28,051
#We are #

1380
01:22:28,123 --> 01:22:31,388
# Like birds of a feather #

1381
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:33,724
#We are #

1382
01:22:33,795 --> 01:22:37,060
#Two hearts joined together #

1383
01:22:37,132 --> 01:22:41,228
#We will be #

1384
01:22:41,303 --> 01:22:45,239
# Forever as one #

1385
01:22:45,307 --> 01:22:50,142
# My brother, under the sun #

1386
01:22:52,981 --> 01:22:55,472
# Under the sun #

1387
01:22:58,487 --> 01:23:00,819
# Under the sun #
