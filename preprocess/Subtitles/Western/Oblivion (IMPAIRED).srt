480
00:45:28,508 --> 00:45:30,976
<i>NOW, PICK UP THE KEYS AND LET ME OUT.</i>

481
00:45:37,183 --> 00:45:38,984
SO...

00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:40,986
YOU'RE ZACK.

483
00:45:41,053 --> 00:45:43,155
MARSHALL MENTIONED YOU.

484
00:45:43,223 --> 00:45:45,373
YEAH? WHEN?

485
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,292
EVERY NOW AND THEN,

486
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,594
WHENEVER HE WAS DRUNK AND PISSED.

487
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,596
HE SAID YOU WERE A COWARD.

488
00:45:53,399 --> 00:45:57,335
ZACK IS NO COWARD. I OWE HIM MY LIFE.

489
00:45:57,403 --> 00:46:01,290
- ZACK HERE RESCUED YOU?
- THAT IS CORRECT.

490
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,292
HMM.

491
00:46:05,528 --> 00:46:08,330
HOW NICE OF YOU TO THINK ABOUT
SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOURSELF.

492
00:46:09,899 --> 00:46:12,334
WHY AM I LETTING YOU OUT OF HERE?

493
00:46:22,512 --> 00:46:25,981
ZACK STONE THINKS ABOUT
EVERYONE EXCEPT HIMSELF,

494
00:46:26,048 --> 00:46:30,185
AND THAT IS HIS WEAKNESS,
AND IT'S ALSO HIS STRENGTH.

495
00:46:31,787 --> 00:46:36,908
- IS THAT SO?
- I KNOW HIM BETTER THAN ANY LIVING BEING.

496
00:46:36,976 --> 00:46:40,245
I HAVE READ HIS HEART AND HIS SOUL.

497
00:46:40,313 --> 00:46:43,098
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN HIM?

498
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,969
TWO DAYS.

499
00:46:49,272 --> 00:46:51,924
SOUNDS LIKE A QUICK READ.

500
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:54,593
SO YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
OVER BEING MARSHALL NOW?

501
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:57,745
LOOK, KIDDO.

502
00:46:57,813 --> 00:46:59,848

00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,925
ASIDE FROM THE FACT
THAT I HAVE NO DESIRE...

506
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,378
TO BE THE NUMBER-ONE
TARGET ON THE PLANET,

507
00:47:12,445 --> 00:47:15,096

THAT STUFF WITH NO PROBLEM.

510
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:27,009
- I'M NOT MESSING WITH THOSE ODDS.
- SO YOU'RE A QUITTER.

511
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,711
LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

512
00:47:29,778 --> 00:47:32,982
LOOK. I WASN'T HIRED TO DO A JOB.

513
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:34,983
NO.

514
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:37,953
YOU JUST WALKED OUT ON YOUR FATHER.

DIED AS HE LIVED--

533
00:48:55,431 --> 00:48:58,666
FIGHTING FOR WHAT HE BELIEVED IN.

534
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:02,471
RATHER THAN CHATTER ON MYSELF,

535
00:49:02,538 --> 00:49:06,108
I'D LIKE THE MARSHALL'S
SON TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

PROBABLY WISH YOU DIDN'T.

542
00:49:43,229 --> 00:49:47,232

543
00:49:47,299 --> 00:49:50,002

OH.

547
00:49:59,362 --> 00:50:04,333
WELL, WE DIDN'T SEE
EYE-TO-EYE ON A LOT OF THINGS.

548
00:50:06,553 --> 00:50:09,020
HE FELT TOO DIFFERENT.

549
00:50:09,122 --> 00:50:12,708
BUT THE FACT IS, WE WERE
ACTUALLY MORE ALIKE...

550
00:50:12,775 --> 00:50:15,243
THAN EITHER OF US WAS WILLING TO LET ON.

551
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:19,013

OH, CHRIST.

00:50:26,522 --> 00:50:28,790
POINT IS,

555
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:31,460
MY FATHER TAUGHT ME THE
MOST IMPORTANT LESSON...

556
00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:34,029
A MAN CAN
TEACH HIS SON--

557
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:36,865
THAT YOU'VE GOT TO STICK
TO WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN,

558

NO MATTER WHAT.

559
00:50:39,768 --> 00:50:43,738
SOMETIMES THAT EVEN
MEANS NOT BEING A HERO,

560
00:50:43,806 --> 00:50:45,740
EVEN IF SOMEBODY
WANTS YOU TO--

561

<i>[ Man ] B-1. BE ONE.</i>

<i>[ Man ] AMEN TO THAT.</i>

563
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:55,350
AND THE POINT IS...

00:50:55,384 --> 00:51:00,405
THAT IT WAS THIS VERY
LESSON THAT TORE US APART,

565

OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE THE ONE
WITHOUT ANY HOPE HERE.

MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO CLIMB IN THAT GRAVE

I DO NOT HURT WOMEN.

953
01:27:45,123 --> 01:27:47,750
A MAN WITH INTEGRITY.

954
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:50,003
I COULD GO FOR YOU.

955
01:27:50,192 --> 01:27:51,835
GERONIMO!

956
01:27:56,296 --> 01:27:58,983
EVEN YOU HURT ME!
EVEN YOU!

957
01:27:58,984 --> 01:27:59,984
NO. NO. OH, SHIT.

958
01:28:08,292 --> 01:28:10,712
I AM IN YOUR DEBT STILL.

959
01:28:10,747 --> 01:28:13,096
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO...

960
01:28:14,423 --> 01:28:16,810
COULD YOU LEND ME
A HAND?

961
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:56,379
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE ONLY INTO...

962
01:28:56,738 --> 01:28:59,345
FUNERALS AND BODIES.

963
01:28:59,346 --> 01:29:01,454
THERE'S ALWAYS
BINGO.

964
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,223
FEELS LIKE IT'S GOT THE WEIGHT
OF THE WORLD HANGING ON IT.

965
01:29:29,676 --> 01:29:31,749
YOU WEAR IT WELL.

966
01:29:41,505 --> 01:29:43,554
SURE THE SCORPS
ATE ALL OF HIM?

967
01:29:43,555 --> 01:29:46,605
WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
NO PIECES LEFT TO REGENERATE?

968
01:29:46,606 --> 01:29:48,550
DEAD SURE.

969
01:29:49,273 --> 01:29:51,257
YOU AREN'T SORRY, ARE YOU?

970
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:53,244
WELL A PIECE OF ME
DIED WITH HIM,

971
01:29:53,245 --> 01:29:55,911
BUT BETTER HIM AND ME
THAN INNOCENT PEOPLE.

972
01:29:57,302 --> 01:29:58,880
LET'S GET ON OUT OF HERE.

973
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:06,016
HEYA.
