00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,632
Well, you tell him
that the coach from Contention was held up.

161
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,425
We passed it on the way in.

162
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,176
They don't have any horses.

163
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,436
- Now, did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, I heard.

164
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,107
Well, why don't you go tell him?

165
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,442
The marshal takes his nap
between 1:00 and 2:00.

166
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,694
Oh, he does? Well, that's nice.
That way, he don't get tired.

167
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,033
You fellas come from the north?

168
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,162
Down here, everybody naps
between 1:00 and 2:00.

169
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,499
[Wade]
Everybody except you.

170
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,088
The boss is nappin' now.

171
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,297
I take my nap between 2:00 and 3:00.

172
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,676
I guess we've come too early.

173
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,976
This place, does it keep your boss busy?

174
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,395
No. He does other things too.

175
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,063
Like what other things?

176
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,400
He has like a little bank,
and he loans money to ranchers.

177
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,736
What does he do?
Does he keep the money here?

178
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,488
[Sighs]
See, he doesn't have any money anymore.

179
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,907
What with the drought, nobody pays back.

180
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,076
That's too bad.
[Chuckles]

181
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,705
Miss, if my outfit's
asking you too many questions...

182
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,874
well, you just say so, huh?

183
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,251
See, we've been on a cattle drive
for about three months...

184
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,087
and when you walk into
a place like this and...

185
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,005
see a nice girl like you -

186
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,425
Well, it's nice.

187
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,762
How far away is the Mexican border?

188
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,726
Nobody knows exactly.
It's never been decided.

189
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,144
I think we can find it all right.

190
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,983
When the marshal wakes up, you tell him
that the coach from Contention was robbed.

191
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,234
And you tell him the driver was killed, huh?

192
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,405
- Killed?
- Killed.

193
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,952
Oh. Oh, if there's a killin',
I'm supposed to wake him.

194
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,078
It's only robbery
he don't wanna be waked for.

195
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,539
- Marshal!
- [Knocking]

196
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,836
Wake up. The coach has been robbed
and Bill Moons was killed.

197
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,048
Marshal, Bill Moons was killed.
These fellas outside seen it.

198
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,840
How far back was it?

199
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,636
- It was about 10 miles.
- They took the horses too.

200
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,516
Did you hear that, Marshal?

201
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,601
Why didn't you fellas try and help?

202
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,228
We were all strung out.

203
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,313
We didn't see it till we looked
back up here at the pass.

204
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,981
That's right.

205
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,857
Go get everybody.

206
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,336
Where you fellas from?

207
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,047
- Prairie Cattle Company.
- I didn't know they got this far.

208
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,883
Well, you see, they just bought
60,000 head down in Mexico...

209
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,969
and they sent us down there
to drive 'em in.

210
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,762
Then you won't be staying in town long?

211
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,805
No, just long enough to have a drink.

212
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,319
Alex Potter!

213
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,909
I told you he had rheumatism!

214
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,745
Anyway, he sold his horse.
Now, you know that.

215
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,540
[Bartender]
He can use one of my horses.

216
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,832
[Exhales]

217
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,674
Suspicious old goat.

218
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,472
- Where's Alex Potter?
- Sleeping it off, I guess.

219
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,266
I don't think he wants to leave town
with us here.

220
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,855
Scatter and cross the border.
We'll meet in Nogales tonight.

221
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,794
What's holding up the boss?

222
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,588
Don't worry about him.
He'll be along.

223
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,049
He can handle that hick posse single-handed.

224
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,843
Hyah! Hyah!

225
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,224
[Marshal]
Come on.

226
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,073
Haven't I seen you someplace?

227
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,868
Did you?

228
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,744
Yeah, did you ever, uh -

229
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,247
Did you ever work in Cheyenne?

230
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,001
- El Paso?
- No.

231
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,961
Did you ever work in the Blind Irishman
in Dodge City?

232
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,509
Yeah, I sang there.

233
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,344
Best time I ever had in my life.

234
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,220
Well, what made you quit?

235
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,849
Well, I - I got to coughing too much.

236
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,059
Doctor said I should breathe dry air.

237
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,606
Yeah, well, you sure come
to the right place here.

238
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,529
You know, I spent more money
in that place, I tell ya.

239
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:37,116
Did you ever - Do you remember a girl,
I think her name was, uh -

240
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,995
- Oh. Pauline.
- A heavyset girl.

241
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,038
- Yeah. And Velvet, do you remember her?
- Mm-hmm.

242
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,623
Shoot. I spent 300 in one night on Velvet.

243
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,836
Hey, I remember
they had real Paris dresses there...

244
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,795
real Paris perfume.

245
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,551
I mean, what's a woman for
if you don't treat her right?

246
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:59,345
I'd have spent every cent I had on her,
except she married the governor of the state.

247
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,814
Is there many young fellas
around this place?

248
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,027
No, they're - They're all older.

249
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,902
You must get Ionely.

250
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,847
Hey! Where are they, huh?

251
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,641
- Where'd they go? [Sniffles]
- Alex!

252
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,851
- That way.
- Uh-huh?

253
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,690
Ain't you gonna help catch 'em?

254
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,317
No, I wish I could.

255
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,861
- What'd they look like?
- Oh, they'll be easy to catch.

256
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,070
Uh, three big men
on three white horses.

257
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,372
[Sighs, Mutters]

258
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,543
Three white fellas
on three big horses, huh?

259
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,411
- Do you ever sing anymore?
- Who's there to sing for in Bisbee?

260
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,258
Hey, you know you look kind of skinny?

261
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,263
I feel skinny.

262
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,392
That's all right.
I don't mind a skinny girl...

263
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,894
just so she has blue eyes
to make up for it.

264
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,190
You got blue eyes?

265
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,067
Brown.

266
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,865
That's all right.
They don't have to be blue.

267
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,634
Must be they buried their man here.

268
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,761
If I had my way, there'd be
more than one of 'em buried.

269
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,600
[Butterfield]
Hello there! Are you the marshal?

270
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,021
Did you see the Butterfield coach
down there?

271
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,731
This is Mr. Butterfield.

272
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,483
My driver was killed.
They got a gold shipment.

273
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,485
- [Marshal] See where they went?
- They went into Bisbee.

274
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,613
- Bisbee?
- We just come from Bisbee.

275
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,406
Didn't you see an outfit ride through?

276
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,616
There must have been a dozen of 'em.
They was all on dark horses.

277
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,787
[Butterfield]
You didn't see them?

278
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,207
Yeah, we seen 'em.

279
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,000
And then they left.

280
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,044
Cy, you'd better go along,
hitch up the coach down there.

281
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,927
- We think it was Ben Wade.
- Well, what do you know!

282
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,137
There I was face-to-face with Ben Wade.

283
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,181
[Alex]
Hey! Hello, Marshal.

284
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,143
- Catch 'em yet?
- Catch 'em?

285
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,937
Them were the fellas back in Bisbee.

286
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,688
Yeah?

287
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,649
Well, one of them's still there.

288
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,817
I just seen him go back into the saloon.

289
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,319
Alex, you been drinkin' this mornin' or not?

290
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,615
Marshal, you know I never touch a drop
until the stroke of noon.

291
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,117
[Butterfield] If there's a man there,
why don't we catch him?

292
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,496
Hey. What if it's Ben Wade?

293
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,873
So we catch him.
What good will that do?

294
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,251
- We'll arrest him.
- For how long?

295
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,212
Till his outfit comes back
and shoots up the town?

296
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,630
No one's ever held him yet.

297
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,674
We could grab him,
get him out of town quick.

298
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,218
Well, we're not gonna catch him
standing around here talking about it.

299
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,136
- Let's go.
- You coming, Dan?

300
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,846
Yeah, I'm coming.

301
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,640
[Man]
Come on. Nothin' will happen.

302
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,016
The only thing that'll happen
is somebody will get hurt bad.

303
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,715
Think you'll ever get back to Bisbee?

304
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,301
No, it don't look like it.

305
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,094
That's what I figured.

306
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,887
Well, I never stay long anyplace.

307
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,979
Oh, you care? Hmm?

308
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,732
Sure I care.
[Exhales]

309
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,733
What can I do?
You're on the go, and I'm stuck.

310
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,988
I ain't complaining.

311
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,114
I got something to remember.

312
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,617
Me too.

313
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,747

01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,671
Ben, are you all right?

940
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:48,257
What'll I tell 'em?

941
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,259
What do you mean?

942
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:53,052
When shall I tell 'em
you're gonna let me go?

943
01:13:54,054 --> 01:13:57,224
Tell 'em you'll write 'em a letter
every day from Yuma.

944
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:58,850
Yeah?

945
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:03,230
Hey, Charlie? Charlie, go buy the boys a drink.
We'll be down soon.

946
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:04,940
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

947
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:08,652
What if you don't come down? He could
shoot you and say you tried to make a break.

948
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,946
Kill him? They'll kill us all first.

949
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,573
Ben, you let him know what'll happen
if we hear a gun go off.

950
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:23,332
He knows.

951
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:27,795
Your turn, general.

952
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,257
What do you expect me to say?

953
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:33,135
I expect you to say something
that makes sense.

954
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:37,639
Not only sense for yourself, something that
makes sense for your wife and your children.

955
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:40,600
You've got a real twisted mind,
haven't you?

956
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,691
Take a look, Dan.

957
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,693
Huh?

958
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:51,695
What's the matter?
Don't you want to see them?

959
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,321
I'll see 'em soon enough.

960
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:57,992
All right. Break it up.

961
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:17,429
Hey, Dan.

962
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:20,265
Dan, don't make it hard on yourself.

963
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:24,060
All you gotta do is drop that gun on the bed
and let me walk out this door.

964
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:27,231
- Huh?
- Wade, listen.

965
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,066
What are you squeezing the watch for?

966
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,151
Are you sure that no one would ever know?

967
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:34,028
Squeezing that watch
ain't gonna stop time.

968
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:40,661
Oh, now.

969
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,414
You shouldn't get so scared, Dan.

970
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,165
You might make a bad move.

971
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:48,836
He said there were only a few.
I counted seven.

972
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,921
I didn't figure on a big shoot-out.

973
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,838
Come on, Bill.

974
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,726
Just a minute, fellas.

975
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:13,902
Please don't go.
Can't you see we need you?

976
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:16,028
There's one of your outfit, Dan.

977
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:21,785
Hey, what time is it now?

978
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,912
What time do you figure it is, Dan?
About 2:40?

979
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,377
That's one of your outfit
walkin' out on you, Dan.

980
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:34,673
They'll all walk out on you.

981
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:36,258
Why shouldn't they?

982
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,594
I'll pay you each $50.

983
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,387
Don't you think you have a duty?
Do you want to see us shot down?

984
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,806
Please.

985
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:47,186
I'm asking you.

986
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,146
Please, I'm begging you.

987
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,690
Look, nobody wants to walk out on ya.

988
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:53,609
This whole thing happened in Bisbee.

989
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,403
Why should you bring your troubles
to Contention?

990
01:16:56,528 --> 01:16:58,489
I mean, we've got families.

991
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,616
Every man here is a family man.

992
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:04,828
Dan's a family man too.
I'm a family man, in a way.

993
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:06,912
Let's get out of here.

994
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,047
You see, Dan, everybody wants to live.

995
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:17,799
And that means Butterfield too.
He'll walk out on you, Dan.

996
01:17:17,924 --> 01:17:19,885
No, he won't. He'll stick. I can tell.

997
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,595
He's human.

998
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,806
At five minutes to 3:00,
Butterfield is gonna walk out on you, Dan...

999
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:27,601
and he's gonna leave you all alone.

1000
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:31,480
Now, what do you figure
you're gonna die for, huh?

1001
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:34,482
Because Butterfield
lost his gold shipment? Hmm?

1002
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,819
Or because some fool driver
got what he deserved?

1003
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,366
I'm going up to talk to Dan.

1004
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,450
You watch out from here.

1005
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:01,133
Drop the gun.

1006
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,054
Dan, the roof!

1007
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:25,700
Nancy! Nancy!

1008
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,123
Take good care of him.

1009
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:36,877
Dan, open up.

1010
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,550
- What happened to Alex?
- I don't know. I heard shots.

1011
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:45,429
I ran back to the stairs. Then they
were dragging him towards the hotel.

1012
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:48,347
[Alex]
Dan! Dan!

1013
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:52,352
Well, I guess that leaves just the two of you.

1014
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:55,439
If there's one more shot, I shoot you.

1015
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,064
Tell 'em.

1016
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:03,780
Hey, Charlie?

1017
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,657
You've got one more shot.

1018
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:07,242
Make it good.

1019
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:10,161
Tell 'em we'll use it
on the way to the station.

1020
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,293
Go see what they did to Alex.

1021
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:32,767
Listen to me, Dan.

1022
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,355
I'm not going through with it.
It's crazy.

1023
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,565
- And if I'm not, then you aren't either.
- What happened to Alex?

1024
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,275
- Dan, listen to me.
- What happened?

1025
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,528
Dan, if you think you have
any obligation, you don't.

1026
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:45,697
I'm releasing you.

1027
01:19:45,822 --> 01:19:47,323
Alex is dead.

1028
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:51,036
Dan, the odds are changing now,
aren't they?

1029
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:53,038
Now it's one against seven.

1030
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:55,666
Do you hear me?
You have no obligation.

1031
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,542
You better listen to what he said.

1032
01:19:57,667 --> 01:19:59,336
- What?
- You better -

Yeah, you're real lucky, Dan.

01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:25,194

to come home to every night.

1037
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:33,744

1039

1041
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:50,177
Dan, where are you?

01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,306
Here.

1043
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:56,267
If he moves an inch,
give him both barrels.

1044
01:20:59,145 --> 01:21:01,730
- Dan, where are you?
- Alice?

1045
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:17,246
Dan. Dan.

1046
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,793
- Dan.
- Hey, did you hear that thunder?

1047
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:24,421
- l-I think maybe it's going to rain.
- Dan, if you're doing this for me -

1048
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,590
You know, if it rains,
that-that'll change everything.

1049
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,592
If it's something I said yesterday,
please forgive me.

1050
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,927
Wouldn't it be a wonder?
Everything green again.

1051
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:33,387
- Dan, please don't be stubborn.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1052
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:37,391
- I did hear thunder.
- Dan, there's no thunder.

1053
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:41,104
There won't be rain either.

1054
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:44,191
If I ever said anything
that made you think I was complaining...

1055
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,735
or - or how hard things were...

1056
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,612
but it just isn't true.

1057
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:52,449
Because I love everything, every minute.

1058
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:55,368
All the worry, all the work...

1059
01:21:55,493 --> 01:21:56,953
all the hurts of life.

1060
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:59,956
If it's the $200 you need,
I'll pay you anyway.

1061
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,209
Don't go through with it, dear.

1062
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:03,960
No, I've got to.

1063
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:05,962
- For the money?
- No.

1064
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:08,548
- For me?
- No, no, no.

1065
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:11,009
- Then why?
- I've got to. That's all.

1066
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:13,678
Oh, Dan, I don't want a hero.
I want you.

1067
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:16,932
Honest to God,
if I didn't have to do it, I wouldn't.

1068
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,891
But I heard Alex scream.

1069
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:22,187
The town drunk gave his life
because he believed...

1070
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:26,149
that people should be able to live
in decency and peace together.

1071
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:27,942
You think I can do less?

1072
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:31,530
Don't.

1073
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:33,532
No, please, don't go through with it.

1074
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:36,368
You know, I never have been able
to give you very much -

1075
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:40,413
no... pearls, nothing.

1076
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:43,708
Sometimes not even enough food
for you and the boys.

1077
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:46,001
Well, maybe this'll be something
worth remembering.

1078
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,423
What are you saying?

1079
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:55,679
Oh - Don't you think you can make it?

1080
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,681
Oh, yes, of course.

1081
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:01,100
When it gets to be 3:00,
I'll just walk to the station. That's all.

1082
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,811
Then why are you talking about a memory?

1083
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:05,856
Well, I mean, for the boys.

1084
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:09,860
The boys'll always remember how their old man
walked Ben Wade to the station.

and drive her out of town as fast as you can.
