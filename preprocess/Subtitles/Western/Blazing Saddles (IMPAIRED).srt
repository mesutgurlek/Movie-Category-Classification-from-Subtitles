1
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,291
Come on, boys!

2
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,712
The way you're lollygagging around here
with them picks and them shovels. . .

3
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,841
. . .you'd think it was 120 degrees.

4
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,095
It can't be more than 114.

5
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,101
Dock that Chink a day's pay
for napping on the job.

6
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,769
Yes, sir.

7
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,648
Now, come on, boys,
where's your spirit?

8
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,692
I don't hear no singing.

9
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,779
When you were slaves,
you sang like birds.

10
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,782
Go on. How about a good
old nigger work song?

11
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,617
Nigger work song?

12
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,870
Hold it. What the hell is that shit?

13
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,956
I meant a song.

14
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,208
A real song.

15
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,877
Something like:

16
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,012
-"Swing low"?
-"Chariot"?

17
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,972
Don't know that one, huh?

18
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:29,185
Well, how about "De Camptown Ladies"?

19
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,521
"De Camptown Ladies"?

20
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,733
"De Camptown Ladies."

21
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,860
Oh, you know.

22
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:09,016
What in the wide, Wide World of Sports
is going on here?

23
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:12,061
I hired you people to try to get
a little track laid. . .

24
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,731
. . . not to jump around like a bunch
of Kansas City faggots!

25
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,818
Sorry, Mr. Taggart.
I guess we kind of got caught up.

26
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,738
Dummy, the surveyors say they may
have run into some quicksand up ahead.

27
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,073
Better check it out.

28
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,243
Okay, I'll send a team of horses
to check out the ground.

29
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,911
Horses?!

30
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,415
Why, we can't afford to lose
no horses, you dummy!

31
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:36,669
-Send over a couple of niggers.
-Okay, Mr. Taggart.

32
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,423
You and you.

33
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,841
Sir?

34
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:46,262
Sir, he specifically requested
two niggers.

35
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:51,100
But to tell a family secret,
my grandmother was Dutch.

36
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,437
Get on that handcar and take
it down to the end of that line!

37
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,523
-Just trying to help you out.
-Get!

38
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,402
I didn't know your grandma was Dutch!

39
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,095
-Bart?
-What?

40
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,222
Am I wrong. . .

41
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,893
. . .or is the world rising?

42
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:38,064
I don't know,
but whatever it is, I hate it.

43
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,818
Hey, Charlie. Let me ask you something.

44
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,280
What is it that's not exactly water. . .

45
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,491
. . .and it ain't exactly earth?

46
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,494
Quicksand!

47
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:59,168
Oh, shit! Quicksand!

48
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,295
Hot dang, now we are in trouble!

49
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,298
They in trouble.

50
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,343
Lyle, get your rope there.
Get over there quick.

51
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,553
Right, Mr. Taggart.

52
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,022
That's it. It's coming.

53
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,109
Dang, that was lucky.

54
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,987
Doggone near lost
a $400 handcar.

55
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,579
Yeah, we can take it right off to the--

56
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,541
Just a little to the left
of that hill over yonder.

57
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,378
But we're gonna die, Bart.
They're gonna leave us here to die.

58
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,547
Take it easy, Charlie.

59
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,675
My foot's on the rail.

60
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,391
Then maybe down that canyon,
I think it's pretty level there.

61
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,686
We can't swing back to the right
because of that hill there.

62
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,897
That looks like the way
we'll have to go from here.

63
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:06,152
Yeah, we'll put her right down
through over that ridge.

64
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,404
Come on!

65
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,575
Well, boys, the break's over.

66
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,411
Don't just lay there getting a suntan.

67
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,414
Ain't gonna do you
no good nohow!

68
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:22,084
Here. Take that shovel
and put her to some good use.

69
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,920
Come on, now.

70
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,929
-What?
-Don't do that, now.

71
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,223
-Uh-uh, baby.
-Come on, don't do that.

72
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,600
I have to.

73
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,935
Send a wire to the main office. . .

74
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,605
. . .and tell them I said--

75
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,773
Send wire, main office. . .

76
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,611
. . .tell them I said, "Ow." Got you.

77
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,620
And right here, Mr. Lamarr,
is where we run into quicksand.

78
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,165
Quicksand. Quicksand.
Splendid.

79
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,627
And so the railroad has gotta go
through Rock Ridge.

80
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,379
Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge.
Splendid.

81
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,131
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

82
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,467
Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge.

83
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,053
-Be still, Taggart. Be still.
-Yes, sir.

84
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:18,766
My mind is aglow with whirling,
transient nodes of thought. . .

85
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,186
. . .careening through
a cosmic vapor of invention.

86
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,812
Ditto!

87
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,233
"Ditto"?

88
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,319
"Ditto," you provincial putz!

89
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:35,115
-I'm sorry, sir.
-A plan. A plan. We need a plan.

90
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,785
What in the hell was that?

91
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,250
Next!

92
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,461
Boris, we can't hear ourselves think!

93
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:55,511
Oh, sorry, Your Worship, but I've got
two men at home, sick with the flu. . .

94
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,180
. . .and it's utter chaos down here.

95
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,100
I'll try to keep it as quiet
as possible.

96
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,269
But as you can see. . .

97
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,357
. . .this one is a doozy.

98
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:13,529
Yes, the Dr. Gillespie killings.
Well, do your best.

99
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,120
-Now, let's see. Where were we?
-Rock Ridge.

100
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,997
Rock Ridge.

101
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,542
Yes, when that railroad
goes through Rock Ridge. . .

102
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,546
. . .that land will be worth millions,
and I want it.

103
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,549
I want that land so badly. . .

104
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,884
. . . I can taste it.

105
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,389
There must be a way.

106
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,851
-Clumsy fool.
-I'm sorry.

107
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,311
Wait a minute.

108
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,354
There might be a legal precedent.

109
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,774
Of course! Land snatching.

110
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,736
Let's see. "Land:

111
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,072
See snatch. "Snatch.

112
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:02,328
"HaIey v. united States.
Haley, 7. United States, nothing."

113
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,581
You see, it can be done.
It can be done.

114
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:10,169
Unfortunately, there is one thing that
stands between me and that property.

115
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,920
The rightful owners.

116
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,591
There must be some way
of scaring them off, driving them out.

117
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,844
Getting rid of every human being
alive in that--

118
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,139
-Oh, it's down the hall and to the left.
-No, sir. Sir?

119
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,307
-What?
-I've got it.

120
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,808
You do? What? What? What?

121
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,603
I know how we can run
everybody out of Rock Ridge.

122
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,356
-How?
-We'll kill the first-born male child. . .

123
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,191
. . . in every household.

124
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,527
Too Jewish.

125
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,072
Let's see.

126
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,865
-I got it! I got it!
-You do?

127
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,284
-What?
-We'll work up a number six on them!

128
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,663
-I'm not familiar with that one.
-That's where we go riding into town. . .

129
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,583
. . .a'whopping and a'whumping
every living thing. . .

130
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:53,796
. . .that moves within an inch of its life!
Except the womenfolks, of course.

131
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,172
You spare the women?

132
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,635
No, we rape the shit out of them
at the number-six dance later on!

133
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,304
That's marvelous.
That's so creative, Taggart--

134
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,932
Why, Taggart, you've been hurt.

135
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,103
That uppity nigger went and hit me
on the head with a shovel.

136
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,273
I'd sure appreciate it, sir,
if you could find it in your heart. . .

137
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,527
. . .to hang him up by his neck
until he was dead.

138
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:21,532
-Got him locked up downstairs.
-Consider it done, stout fellow.

139
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,786
Boris.

140
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,625
I've got a special.
Can you work him in?

141
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:36,338
I couldn't possibly sneak him
in until Monday, sir. I'm booked solid.

142
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,215
Monday. Splendid.

143
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,974
Oh, thank you, sir.
And don't you worry.

144
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:50,477
Why, we'll make Rock Ridge
think it's a chicken. . .

145
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,814
. . .that got caught
in a tractor's nuts.

146
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,524
Splendid.

147
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,361
That's all right.
It's all right, Taggart.

148
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,865
Just a man and a horse
being hung out there.

149
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:13,000
There was a peacefuI town
Called Rock Ridge

150
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:17,171
Where peopIe lived in harmony

151
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:22,843
They never had no kind of troubIe

152
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,805
There was no hint of misery

153
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,898
The town saloon was aIways lively

154
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:40,152
But never nasty or obscene

155
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,739
Behind the bar stood anal Johnson

156
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,534
He aIways kept things nice and clean

157
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,580
And all at once the trouble started

158
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,375
A pack of murderers and thieves

159
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,170
Like swarms of locusts
They descended

160
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,298
Their aim
To make the townsfolk flee

161
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,013
Oh, shit.

162
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,411
Well, that's the end of this suit.

163
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,798
Have you ever seen such cruelty?

164
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:52,307
Now is a time of great decision

165
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:58,063
Are we to stay or up and quit?

166
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:04,945
There's no avoiding this concIusion

167
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:12,911
Our town is turning into shit

168
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,164
Be seated.

169
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,462
Now, I don't have to tell you
good folks. . .

170
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,675
. . .what has been happening
here in our beloved little town.

171
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,094
Sheriff murdered. . .

172
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,096
. . .crops burned. . .

173
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,056
. . .stores looted. . .

174
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,891
. . . people stampeded. . .

175
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,185
. . .and cattle raped.

176
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,773
Now, the time has come to act.

177
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,027
And act fast!

178
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,572
I'm leaving.

179
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:54,077
You get back here, you
pious, candy-ass sidewinder!

180
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:59,583
There ain't no way that nobody
is gonna leave this town!

181
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:03,545
Hell, I was born here
and I was raised here. . .

182
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,089
. . .and dadgum it,
I'm gonna die here!

183
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:10,135
And no sidewinding,
bushwhacking, hornswoggling. . .

184
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:15,223
. . .cracker croaker is gonna
ruin my biscuit cutter!

185
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,732
Now, who can argue with that?

186
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,571
I think we're all indebted
to Gabby Johnson. . .

187
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,949
. . .for clearly stating
what needed to be said.

188
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:37,621
I'm particularly glad these lovely children
were here today to hear that speech.

189
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:41,625
Not only was it
authentic frontier gibberish. . .

190
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:45,420
. . . it expressed a courage
little seen in this day and age.

191
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,341
What are we made of?

192
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,469
Our fathers came across the prairie. . .

193
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:56,264
. . .fought Indians, fought drought,
fought locusts, fought Dix!

194
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,769
Remember when Richard Dix came in here
and tried to take over this town?

195
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,063
We didn't give up then. . .

196
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:08,276
. . .and by gum,
we're not gonna give up now!

197
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,574
Olson Johnson is right!

198
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:20,247
What kind of people are we anyhow?
I say we stay and fight it out.

199
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,669
Dr. Samuel Johnson's right
about Olson Johnson's being right.

200
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,130
And I'm not giving up
my ice-cream parlor. . .

201
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:32,134
. . .that I built with these two hands
for nothing or nobody!

202
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,636
Howard Johnson is right!

203
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,346
Thank you, Van.

204
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,226
Well, if we're gonna stay. . .

205
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,729
. . . I think it's a big mistake.

206
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,481
We're gonna need us a new sheriff.

207
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,150
Now, who's it gonna be?

208
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,154
Why don't we wire the governor
to send us a sheriff.

209
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,865
Why should we get
our own men killed?

210
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:59,035
Howard Johnson is right.
We'll wire the governor.

211
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:04,833
Then let us pray for the deliverance
of our new sheriff.

212
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,211
Will the congregation please rise?

213
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,339
I shall now read from the books. . .

214
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,093
. . .of Matthew, Mark, Luke. . .

215
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,679
. . .and duck.

216
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,066
We've got to do something.

217
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,194
Governor, governor.

218
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,405
-May I disturb you for a moment, sir?
-Yes, what is it?

219
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:39,159
If you will just sign this, governor.
Right here.

220
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,913
-Yes, yes. What the hell is it?
-Under the provisions of this bill. . .

221
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,957
. . .we would snatch
200,000 acres of Indian territory. . .

222
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,169
. . .which we have deemed unsafe
for their use at this time.

223
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,963
-They're such children.
-Two hundred thousand acres?

224
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,882
Two hundred thousand acres?

225
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,510
What will it cost, man?
What will it cost?

226
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,054
A box of these.

227
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:02,474
You crazy? They'll never go
for it. Then again, they might.

228
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,060
Little red devils love toys.
May I try one?

229
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,687
-Please do, sir.
-Thank you. Thank you.

230
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,607
These things are defective.

231
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,571
-Right as usual, sir.
-Showoff!

232
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:20,534
-Sir, just sign this, sir. Right here.
-Okay, give us a hand here.

233
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,993
All right, sir.

234
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,746
Work, work, work.
Work, work, work, work, work.

235
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,582
Hello, boys, had a good night's rest?
I missed you.

236
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,336
-Just one more bill for you to sign, sir.
-What the hell is this?

237
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,381
This bill converts
the state hospital for the insane. . .

238
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:38,301
. . . into the William Le Petomane
Memorial Gambling Casino for the Insane.

239
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,763
Gentlemen, this bill
will be a giant step forward. . .

240
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:46,393
-. . . in the treatment of the insane gambler.
-Yes, bravo. Beautiful.

241
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,897
Thank you. Thank you, Hedy.
Thank you.

242
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:55,777
-It's not Hedy. It's Hedley. Hedley Lamarr.
-What the hell are you worried about?

243
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,573
This is 1874.
You'll be able to sue her.

244
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,540
-Just sign here, sir.
-Thank you.

245
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,542
Thank you. Thank you very much.

246
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,128
-That's it.
-All right, help me in with this.

247
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,005
Just think of your secretary.

248
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,257
That was a very good suggestion.

249
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,633
-All right.
-Thank you.

250
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,428
Okay, is that it? Anything else?

251
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:25,307
Just this urgent telegram
from Rock Ridge that arrived last Friday.

252
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,060
Last Friday. Read it!
Read it, you wild bitch.

253
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,315
"Sheriff murdered. Church meeting
bombed. Reign of terror must cease.

254
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:37,569
-Send new sheriff immediately."
-Holy underwear!

255
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:41,281
Sheriff murdered? Innocent women
and children blown to bits?!

256
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,783
We've got to protect
our phony-baloney jobs.

257
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,370
We must do something
about this immediately! Immediately!

258
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,831
Harrumph, harrumph, harrumph.

259
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:53,501
-I didn't get a harrumph out of him.
-Give the governor a harrumph.

260
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,754
-Harrumph.
-You watch your ass.

261
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,256
Gentlemen, please rest your sphincters.

262
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,342
-Well put.
-Thank you very much, sir.

263
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,677
As attorney general, I can assure you. . .

264
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,598
. . .a suitable sheriff will be found
to restore the peace in Rock Ridge.

265
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,266
Meeting is adjourned.

266
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:12,187
I am sorry, sir. I didn't mean
to overstep my bounds. You say that.

267
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,813
-What?
-Meeting is adjourned.

268
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,024
-It is?
-No. You say that, governor.

269
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,692
-What?
-Meeting is adjourned.

270
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,111
-It is?
-Play around with this for a while.

271
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,363
Thank you, Hedy.

272
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,114
-No, it's Hedley!
-It is?

273
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,867
Give these out to some
of the boys in lieu of pay.

274
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,204
Here you go. Frankie,
Johnny, Patsy, Kelly.

275
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,082
And one for Miss Stein,
my beloved secretary.

276
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,710
Play with these, boys,
in lieu of the other things.

277
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,381
This frigging thing is warped.

278
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,468
Why do I always get a warped one?

279
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,180
A sheriff!

280
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:50,892
But law and order
is the last thing I want.

281
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,603
Wait a minute.

282
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,065
Maybe I can turn this thing
into my advantage.

283
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,442
If I could find a sheriff. . .

284
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,237
. . .who so offends
the citizens of Rock Ridge. . .

285
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:06,491
. . .that his very appearance
would drive them out of town.

286
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,996
But where would I find such a man?

287
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,415
Why am I asking you?

288
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:25,010
Oh, welcome to Hanging House.

289
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,511
Not to worry.

290
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,472
Everyone is equal in my eye.

291
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,533
Not my ear. Not in my ear.

292
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,495
-Not in the ear. Not in the ear.
-Sir?

293
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,456
Governor?

294
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,459
-Yes?
-Official business, sir.

295
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,754
-Is it important?
-It's very crucial.

296
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,882
Be with you in a minute.

297
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,426
Throw something on
and stay in that position.

298
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,303
Oh, sorry, gentlemen.

299
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:12,182
Forgive me, I was just walking
the parapet, taking a look around.

300
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,602
-What can I do for you?
-Governor, as per your instructions. . .

301
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,563
. . . I'd like you to meet
the new sheriff of Rock Ridge.

302
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,815
I'd be delight-- Wow!

303
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,318
I've got to talk to you.
Come here.

304
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:27,822
Have you gone berserk?
Can't you see that that man is a ni--?

305
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,329
Wrong person. Forgive me.
No offense intended.

306
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:38,208
Have you gone berserk?
Can't you see that man is a ni--?

307
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,336
-Don't worry, sir.
-I've always trusted your judgment. . .

308
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,631
. . . but haven't you taken a giant leap
from your good senses?

309
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,217
Please don't fly off the handle, sir.

310
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,386
I am about to make you
an historic figure.

311
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:54,474
-Maybe even get you a cabinet post.
-A cabinet post!

312
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:55,850
-Yes.
-Did you say that?

313
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,560
-I said that.
-Wonderful.

314
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:00,855
Yes, the first man ever to appoint
a black sheriff.

315
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:05,026
-Just think, sir. Washington, Jefferson--
-Lincoln.

316
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,153
Le Petomane!

317
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,656
Sir, you have the seeds
of greatness in you.

318
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:13,284
Nurse them, caress them,
pour water on them.

319
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,329
Don't shortchange yourself, sir.

320
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:19,791
It'll never work.
They'll kill him dead in one day.

321
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:24,295
One day is all we'll need to secure your
name in the annals of Western history.

322
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,298
And to get, for you, a nomination for--
Dare I say?

323
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,509
-Dare. Dare.
-The presidency!

324
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,886
-Wow!
-Hail to the chief!

325
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,347
Hail to the chief!

326
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,274
Fourscore and seven years ago. . .

327
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,819
. . .our forefathers
brought forth on this--

328
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,363
-Are you coming back?
-In a moment, dear.

329
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,575
Gentlemen, affairs of state
must take precedent. . .

330
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:58,288
-. . .over the affairs of state.
-Yes, of course, sir. We understand.

331
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,791
-Will you make the arrangements?
-I'll make the arrangements.

332
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,918
Especially the funeral.

333
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,047
Good luck, boys.
Wonderful working with you.

334
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,757
Good luck!

335
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,825
Hurry up, get those flags up.
He'll be here soon.

336
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,120
Hey! I just got a telegram
from the governor's office.

337
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,831
The sheriff will be here at noon!

338
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,961
Noon? I'd better rehearse my speech.

339
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,840
"As honorary chairman
of the welcoming committee. . .

340
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,843
. . . it is my privilege to extend to you. . .

341
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,013
. . .a Laurel and Hardy handshake."

342
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:40,890
-Wonderful !
-Lovely.

343
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,602
-Excellent.
-Gabby, can you see him yet?

344
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,359
The sheriff's coming.

345
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:55,863
-Ring out the church bells.
-Strike up the band.

346
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,089
Hey! The sheriff is a ni--

347
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,135
-What did he say?
-The sheriff is near.

348
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,845
No!

349
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,265
The sheriff is a ni--

350
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,981
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

351
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,372
"As chairman
of the welcoming committee. . .

352
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,709
. . . it is my privilege to extend a Laurel. . .

353
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:53,087
. . .and Hardy handshake to our new--"

354
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,758
Nigger.

355
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:29,082
Excuse me while I whip this out.

356
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,798
"By the power vested in me. . .

357
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,885
. . . by the Honorable
William J. Le Petomane. . .

358
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,143
. . . I hereby assume the duties
of the office of sheriff. . .

359
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,562
. . . in and for the township
of Rock Ridge."

360
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,732
Gentlemen, let us not allow anger
to rule the day.

361
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,652
As your spiritual leader, I implore you. . .

362
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,322
. . .to pay heed to this good book
and what it has to say.

363
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,951
Son. . .

364
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,786
. . .you're on your own.

365
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,291
Hold it!

366
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,045
The next man makes a move,
the nigger gets it.

367
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,177
Hold it, men. He's not bluffing.

368
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:26,180
Listen to him, men.
He's just crazy enough to do it.

369
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:31,227
Drop it, or I swear I'll blow
this nigger's head all over this town!

370
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:34,856
Lordy, Lord, he's desperate.
Do what he say.

371
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,316
Do what he say!

372
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,544
Isn't anybody gonna help
that poor man?

373
00:29:56,712 --> 00:30:00,548
Hush, Harriett.
That's a sure way to get him killed.

374
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,884
Help me! Help me! Help me!

375
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,887
Somebody help me!
Help me! Help me!

376
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,307
Help me! Shut up!

377
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:17,148
Baby, you are so talented.

378
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,901
And they are so dumb.

379
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:27,033
Order.

380
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:31,537
Goddamn it! I said, order!

381
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,165
You know, Nietzsche says:

382
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,084
"Out of chaos comes order."

383
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,086
Blow it out your ass, Howard.

384
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,425
Now, everyone be quiet. . .

385
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:48,304
. . .whilst we listen
to Harriett Van Johnson. . .

386
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:52,850
. . .our esteemed school marm,
as she reads a telegram. . .

387
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:57,146
. . .that she herself has composed
to the governor. . .

388
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:00,107
. . .expressing our feelings. . .

389
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:04,153
. . .about the new sheriff.

390
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,954
"To the Honorable
William J. Le Petomane, governor."

391
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,790
-We can't hear you !
-Forgive me.

392
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:19,710
I'm not used to public speaking.

393
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:25,883
"We, the white, God-fearing citizens
of Rock Ridge. . .

394
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:30,179
. . .wish to express
our extreme displeasure. . .

395
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,890
. . .with your choice of sheriff.

396
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,978
Please remove him immediately.

397
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:42,233
The fact that you have sent him here. . .

398
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,569
. . .just goes to prove. . .

399
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:49,991
. . .that you are the leading asshole
in the state."

400
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,181
The drunk in number two must be awake.

401
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,439
Are we awake?

402
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,862
We're not sure.

403
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,240
Are we black?

404
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,783
Yes, we are.

405
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,579
Then we're awake. . .

406
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,540
. . . but we're very puzzled.

407
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:44,086
I think I'd better straighten myself out.

408
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,674
Need any help?

409
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,262
All I can get.

410
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,565
Thanks.

411
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,777
That's okay. Sit down over here.

412
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,414
Hey, maybe you should
eat something first.

413
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:24,418
No, thanks. Food makes me sick.

414
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:38,349
A man drink like that and he don't eat,
he is going to die.

415
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,727
When?

416
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:47,441
-What's your name?
-Well, my name is Jim.

417
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,277
But most people call me. . .

418
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,031
. . .Jim.

419
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:59,870
Okay, Jim, since you are my guest
and I am your host. . .

420
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,124
. . .what are your pleasures?
What do you like to do?

421
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,251
Oh, I don't know.

422
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,336
Play chess.

423
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,339
Screw.

424
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,050
Well, let's play chess.

425
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,888
Checkmate.

426
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,225
-What?
-Checkmate.

427
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,145
Why, you devious son of a bitch.

428
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,148
Happy days.

429
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,742
Man, why you do that to yourself?

430
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,328
You don't really wanna know that.

431
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,749
-I do, I do.
-Well, if you must pry. . . .

432
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,001
I must, I must.

433
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,838
I don't know if you ever
heard of me before. . .

434
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,674
. . . but I used to be called. . .

435
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,761
. . .the Waco Kid.

436
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:01,140
The Waco Kid.
He had the fastest hands in the West.

437
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,101
In the world.

438
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,313
Well, if you're the Kid,
then show me something.

439
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:12,359
Maybe a couple of years ago
I could have shown you something. . .

440
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,361
. . . but today. . . .

441
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,241
-Look at that.
-Steady as a rock.

442
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,328
Yeah, but I shoot with this hand.

443
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,872
See, I knew you wasn't no Waco Kid.

444
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,957
You was just pulling my lariat.

445
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,836
Oh, dearie, dear.

446
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,715
Well. . . .

447
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,384
Okay.

448
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,642
See that king?

449
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:48,521
-Yeah.
-Put your hands on both sides of it.

450
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,234
Now, when I say "go". . .

451
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,236
. . .you try to grab it first.

452
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:59,073
Man, that's no contest.
You a mile away.

453
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,868
Yeah.

454
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:06,163
Anyway, when you hear the word "go". . .

455
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,873
. . .you just try to grab it.

456
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,167
Ready?

457
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,836
Ready.

458
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,094
Go!

459
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,520
Hey.

460
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,773
You looking for this?

461
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,572
Well, raise my rent.

462
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,283
-You are the Kid.
-Was.

463
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,119
Yeah, I was the Kid.

464
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,415
Well, what happened?

465
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:54,295
It got so that every prairie punk
who thought he could shoot a gun. . .

466
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:58,465
. . .would ride into town
to try out the Waco Kid.

467
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:04,638
I must have killed more men
than Cecil B. De Mille.

468
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,807
It got pretty gritty.

469
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:11,061
I started to hear the word "draw"
in my sleep.

470
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,815
Then one day. . .

471
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:18,402
. . . I was just
walking down the street. . .

472
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,488
. . .and I heard a voice behind me say:

473
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,158
"Reach for it, mister."

474
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,535
I spun around.

475
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:31,040
And there I was face to face. . .

476
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:36,295
. . .with a 6-year-old kid.

477
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:44,011
Well, I just threw my guns down
and walked away.

478
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:50,184
The little bastard shot me in the ass.

479
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:55,022
So I limped to the nearest saloon. . .

480
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,900
. . .crawled inside a whiskey bottle. . .

481
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:02,029
. . .and I've been there ever since.

482
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,117
Have a drink.

483
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,036
Thanks.

484
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,210
Anyway, that's all ancient history.

485
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:20,422
Now, you tell me your story.
What's a dazzling urbanite like you. . .

486
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,883
. . .doing in a rustic setting like this?

487
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,469
If you really must pry. . . .

488
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,222
Oh, I must, I must.

489
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,521
Well, back in '56. . .

490
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:39,733
. . . my folks and I were part of
this long wagon train. . .

491
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,069
. . . moving West.

492
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:57,543
Well, not exactly part of it.

493
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:00,587
You might say
we was bringing up the rear. . .

494
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,549
...when suddenly,
from out of the west. . .

495
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:06,385
...came the entire Sioux nation.

496
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:11,390
And let me tell you, baby,
they was open for business.

497
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:18,272
Naturally, the white folks
didn't let us travel in their circle. . .

498
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,983
. . .so we made our own.

499
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:16,580
-Cop a walk. It's all right.
-Thank you.

500
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,332
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

501
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,960
Take off.

502
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,637
They darker than us!

503
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,851
And the rest is history.

504
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,854
Impressed?

505
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:49,530
Always like to keep
my audience riveted.

506
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,457
Goddamn!

507
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:47,212
-How about more beans, Mr. Taggart?
-I'd say you've had enough.

508
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,343
I understand there's a new sheriff
in town.

509
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,222
-Who wants to kill him?
-I do! I do! Me! Me!

510
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:01,268
-Me! Me! Me!
-Mr. Taggart? Mr. Taggart, sir?

511
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:05,272
Why don't we give him to Mongo.

512
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,028
Mongo?! Holy shit, that's too cruel.

513
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:15,240
I'll be danged. That is a unique idea.

514
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,207
Down, boy. Down.

515
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,751
Down, Mongo. Down, boy.

516
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:29,463
Here, it's me, Taggart, your old boss.
Here, smell. Smell.

517
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:33,091
Smell, boy. Yeah.
Yeah, that's a good Mongo.

518
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:36,220
That's a good Mongo. Yeah.

519
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:40,891
Hey, how about it? How would you
like to mutilate that new sheriff?

520
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,606
All right! Here, have a cigar.

521
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,607
Oh, by the way,
I got a note this morning.

522
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,527
-From who?
-Well, I'm not sure.

523
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:36,321
It was addressed to the "deputy spade."

524
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:43,328
Well, once I establish myself
in this here town. . .

525
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,873
. . .deputy spade might turn out
to be a groovy position.

526
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,667
Here.

527
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,343
Listen, Bart. . .

528
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:03,390
. . . I want you to do me a favor. I don't
want you going out there this morning.

529
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,059
You can't win these people over,
no matter what.

530
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,562
They're just not gonna accept you.

531
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,992
I'm glad those fingers ain't loaded.

532
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,706
Just like old times.

533
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,338
Like I told you,
once you establish yourself. . .

534
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,965
. . .they've got to accept you.

535
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,301
Catch you later.

536
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,931
Good luck.

537
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,108
Well, good morning, ma'am.

538
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:58,111
And isn't it a lovely morning?

539
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,072
Up yours, nigger!

540
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:08,497
What did you expect?
"Welcome, sonny. . .

541
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:11,458
. . . make yourself at home"?

542
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,210
"Marry my daughter"?

543
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:17,297
You've got to remember
that these are just simple farmers.

544
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,717
These are people of the land.

545
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:24,805
The common clay of the new West.

546
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,474
You know. . .

547
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,936
. . . morons.

548
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:36,858
What the hell is that?

549
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,749
Mongo!

550
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,252
Santa Maria!

551
00:45:56,504 --> 00:46:00,507
I believe in it. Any one of you
friends and neighbors gather around--

552
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,969
Holy shit!

553
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:11,518
And they say that now,
in Paris, France. . .

554
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,812
. . .even as we speak. . .

555
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,399
. . . Louis Pasteur has devised
a new vaccine. . .

556
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:20,694
. . .that will obliterate anthrax
once and for all.

557
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:28,535
Hey, you can't
park that animal over there.

558
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,745
It's illegal.

559
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,755
Think of it, gentlemen,
hoof-and-mouth disease. . .

560
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,676
-. . .a thing of the past.
-Never mind that shit.

561
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,511
Here comes Mongo!

562
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:55,020
I don't know what it is.

563
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,399
Sheriff, Mongo's back! He's--

564
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:04,779
Mongo's breaking up the whole town.
You've got to help us, please!

565
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,407
Did you hear that?
Now, it's "please."

566
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:10,577
This morning, I couldn't get
the time of day.

567
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,120
Who is this Mongo anyway?

568
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:15,749
Well, Mongo ain't exactly a who,
he's more of a what.

569
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,918
-What he said.
-Now, I don't know--

570
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,421
Oh, thank you, sheriff.
Oh, thank you very much.

571
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:23,131
Thank you.

572
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,342
The fool's going to--

573
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,303
I mean, the sheriff's going to do it.

574
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,477
No, no, don't do that. Don't do that.

575
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:38,730
If you shoot him,
you'll just make him mad.

576
00:47:49,200 --> 00:48:02,254
Candy-gram for Mongo.

577
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,756
-Candy-gram for Mongo.
-Me Mongo.

578
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,383
Sign, please.

579
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,098
Thank you.

580
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,646
Mongo like candy.

581
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,697
-A little further down, to the right.
-You know. . .

582
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,825
. . . I thought sure that Mongo
would just mash him up. . .

583
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:35,453
. . . into little sheriff meatballs.
I just don't understand it.

584
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,831
-Be still, Taggart.
-Yes, sir.

585
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:42,836
My mind is a raging torrent,
flooded with rivulets of thought. . .

586
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:47,382
. . .cascading into a waterfall
of creative alternatives.

587
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,884
Goldarn it, Mr. Lamarr. . .

588
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:53,847
. . .you use your tongue prettier
than a $20 whore.

589
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,685
Shitkicker.

590
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,938
Wait a minute. That's it!

591
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:05,275
Of course. And it will work!

592
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:08,028
You bet it will. What will work?

593
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,114
Elementary, cactus-head.
The beast has failed.

594
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:16,494
And when the beast fails,
it's time to call in beauty.

595
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,623
-Beauty?
-Yes, of course.

596
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,084
She's never failed me before.
She'll turn him into jelly.

597
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:26,421
She'll bring him to his knees.

598
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,884
Where's my froggy? Where's my froggy?!

599
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:36,556
-I didn't see it when I come in.
-Look, damn your eyes, look for it!

600
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:40,143
-Taggart.
-Sorry, sir.

601
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,229
Hurry, get it. Will you look around?

602
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,440
-There it is.
-Give it to me. Hurry!

603
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,567
Quick, Taggart! Quick!

604
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,197
That was a close one.

605
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:55,992
Daddy loves froggy.
Froggy love Daddy?

606
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:08,296
-I don't know how you did it.
-He was nothing.

607
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:11,466
The bitch was inventing the candy-gram.

608
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:14,552
And they probably
won't give me credit for it.

609
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:27,273
Good evening, sheriff.
Sorry about the "up yours, nigger."

610
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,777
I hope this apple pie
will, in some small way, say thank you. . .

611
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:35,448
. . .for your ingenuity and courage
in defeating that horrible Mongo.

612
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:39,119
Well, thank you. Much obliged.
Good night.

613
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:52,424
Of course, you'll have the good taste
not to mention that I spoke to you.

614
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,467
-Of course.
-Thank you.

615
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:56,636
Good night.

616
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:02,600
I'm rapidly becoming
a big underground success in this town.

617
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:06,896
See, in another 25 years you'll be able
to shake their hands in broad daylight.

618
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,566
Well, I ain't gonna
hold my breath for it.

619
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,526
Come on, I don't wanna be late.

620
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:14,779
That Lili Von Shtupp
is opening tonight.

621
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:18,283
-Lili Von who?
-Shtupp.

622
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:36,259
Welcome. Come on in.

623
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,096
-Lili.
-Hedy.

624
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:44,184
It's Hedley. For you, my dear.

625
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,104
How ordinary.

626
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:53,026
Oh, Lili. Lili, Lili, Lili, legs.

627
00:51:53,194 --> 00:51:55,195
Lili, Lili.

628
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,698
I cannot find the words
to truly express my joy. . .

629
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:01,367
. . .at the rekindling
of our association.

630
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:05,330
Bullshit. What's the job?

631
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,000
I love it when you talk dirty.

632
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:23,640
Come on, Lamarr, let's get down
to brass tacks.

633
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:26,142
What do you want me to do?

634
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:31,773
I want you to seduce and abandon
the sheriff of Rock Ridge.

635
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:34,067
You think you can do it?

636
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:37,695
Is Bismarck a herring?

637
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,073
Oh, Lili, you're magnificent.

638
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:42,242
Kiss me.

639
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:55,004
And now, folks. . .

640
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,924
. . .that gal y'all have been
waiting for. . .

641
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,510
. . .the Bavarian bombshell herself.

642
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:03,763
Let's hear it for Lili Von Shtupp!

643
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:19,696
Here I stand, the goddess of desire

644
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,115
Set men on fire

645
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:24,784
I have this power

646
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,497
Morning, noon and night
It's drink and dancing

647
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:32,208
Some quick romancing

648
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:35,128
And then a shower

649
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:39,132
Stagedoor Johnnies
ConstantIy surround me

650
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:44,637
They aIways hound me
With one request

651
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:48,600
Who can satisfy their Iustful habit?

652
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,185
I'm not a rabbit

653
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:57,650
I need some rest

654
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:04,407
I'm tired

655
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:08,661
Sick and tired of love

656
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:12,999
I've had my fill of Iove

657
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:18,504
From below and above

658
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,300
Tired

659
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:26,721
Tired of being admired

660
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:31,392
Tired of love uninspired

661
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:34,687
Let's face it
I'm tired

662
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:40,068
I've been with thousands of men

663
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,362
Again and again

664
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,323
They promise the moon

665
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:49,035
They're always coming and going

666
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,121
And going and coming

667
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,124
And always too soon

668
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,668
Right, girls?

669
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,379
I'm tired

670
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:03,758
Tired of playing the game

671
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:08,054
Ain't it a crying shame?

672
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:11,891
I'm so tired

673
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:15,228
Goddamn it, I'm exhausted.

674
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:19,899
-Hello, cowboy. What's your name?
-Tex, ma'am.

675
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:23,528
Tex Ma'am? Tell me, Tex Ma'am. . .

676
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:25,863
-. . .are you in show business?
-Nope.

677
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:30,159
Well, then why don't you get
your frigging feet off the stage!

678
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:46,009
Hello, handsome.
Is that a 10-gallon hat. . .

679
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,178
. . .or are you just enjoying the show?

680
00:55:55,978 --> 00:56:00,231
Oh, Miss Lili. Oh, my lovely baby.

681
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:02,859
Oh, my pussycat.

682
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:07,780
Wanna dance, baby?

683
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,117
Tired

684
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:15,538
Tired of playing the game

685
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:19,876
Ain't it a crying shame?

686
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:24,797
I'm so tired

687
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:32,513
-She's tired
-She's tired

688
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,308
-Sick and tired of love
-Give her a break

689
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:38,144
-She's had her fill of love
-She's not a snake

690
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:42,231
-From below and above
-Can't you see she's sick?

691
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,733
-Tired
-She's bushed

692
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:46,486
-Tired of being admired
-Let her alone

693
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,488
Tired of love uninspired

694
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,990
-Don't you know?
-She's tired

695
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:52,825
Don't you know she's pooped?

696
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:56,621
I've been with thousands of men

697
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,831
Again and again

698
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,834
They sing the same tune

699
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:05,505
They start with Byron and Shelley

700
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:10,218
Then jump on your belly
And bust your balloon

701
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:16,516
Tired

702
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:20,895
Tired of playing the game

703
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:25,316
Ain't it a frigging shame?

704
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:27,985
I'm so--

705
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,695
Let's face it. . .

706
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:33,783
. . .everything below the waist
is kaput!

707
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:37,578
Tired

708
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:09,735
What's it say?

709
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,572
"I must see you alone
in my dressing room. . .

710
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,241
. . . right after the show."

711
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,168
Welcome. Come on in.

712
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,927
Far out.

713
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,138
For you.

714
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,100
A red rose.

715
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,644
How romantic.

716
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:45,897
Have a seat, sheriff.

717
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,613
Won't you excuse me
for a moment. . .

718
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:57,617
. . .while I slip into something
a little bit more comfortable?

719
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:01,621
Bitte, baby.

720
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,129
Why don't you. . .

721
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,465
. . . loosen your bullets.

722
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:21,057
I feel refreshed.

723
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:24,018
Isn't it bright in here?

724
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:33,402
There. Isn't that better?

725
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:37,323
Pardon me, I'll be back in a moment.

726
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,825
Goddamn it.

727
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:44,830
-How's it going?
-He's like wet sauerkraut in my hands.

728
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:48,334
-By morning, he will be my slave.
-Splendid.

729
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:51,212
-Just let me have a little feel.
-Out of here!

730
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,090
Where were we? Where are you?

731
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:59,011
Oh, yes. Let me sit down next to you.

732
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:02,515
Tell me, schwarzie...

733
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:08,187
. . . is it true what they say
about the way you people are gifted?

734
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,899
Oh, it's true.

735
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:13,567
It's true.

736
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:17,071
It's true, it's true.

737
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:21,325
Would you care for
another schnitzengruben?

738
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:26,205
No, thank you.
Fifteen is my limit on schnitzengruben.

739
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:29,959
Well, then, how about a little. . .?

740
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:36,549
Baby, please, I am not from Havana.

741
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:38,384
Excuse me, honey.

742
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:42,722
Besides, I'm late for work.
I got some heavy chores to do.

743
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,309
Will I. . .? Will I see you later?

744
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:51,647
That all depends on how much
vitamin E I can get my hands on.

745
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:57,403
No, no, you mustn't go. I need you.
I never met nobody like you.

746
01:00:57,571 --> 01:01:00,197
I can't live without you.

747
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:07,079
Please, you're making
a German spectacle of yourself.

748
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,500
Auf Wiedersehen, baby.

749
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:20,885
Oh, what a nice guy.

750
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:32,271
Oh, dearie dear.
Look what the cat dragged in.

751
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:48,412
-What's happening in the clean world?
-Bad news.

752
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:53,459
I got a writ here for Mongo's release
signed by Hedley Lamarr himself.

753
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,463
Hedley Lamarr?

754
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,841
Why would a dude like Hedley Lamarr
care about Mongo?

755
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:03,260
You got me.

756
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,305
It's legal.

757
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:12,269
Them schnitzengrubens can wipe you out.

758
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,529
Wake-up time!

759
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:30,413
Okay, Mongo, you're free to go.

760
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:33,082
Mongo no go.

761
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:39,547
Oh, come on, Mongo.
You a free man.

762
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,842
Mongo stay with Sheriff Bart.

763
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:46,345
Sheriff first man ever whip Mongo.

764
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:52,101
Mongo impressed.
Have deep feelings for Sheriff Bart.

765
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:55,062
Oh, you better watch out, big fella.

766
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:58,315
I think Mongo's taken
a little fancy to you.

767
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:05,239
Mongo straight.

768
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:09,869
Listen, Mongo. Maybe you know.

769
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:14,123
Why is a high roller like Hedley Lamarr
interested in Rock Ridge?

770
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,167
Don't know.

771
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,461
Got to do with where choo-choo go.

772
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:26,051
Mongo, why would Hedley Lamarr care
about where the choo-choo go?

773
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:29,013
Don't know.

774
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:35,227
Mongo only pawn in game of life.

775
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,732
Choo-choo. I think this might be
a good time to mosey out. . .

776
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,820
. . .where they're building on the railroad
and maybe do a little snooping.

777
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,527
Damn. Damn.

778
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,028
Damn!

779
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:28,906
How you doing?
Hey, how you doing, Bart?

780
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:31,659
Hey, Bart! Hey!

781
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:35,538
Hey, how you doing, Bart?
Get down off that horse.

782
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,958
-What's happening?
-Yeah, man.

783
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:42,962
-Yeah! What's going on, big dude?
-You shifty nigga!

784
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,631
-They said you was hung!
-And they was right.

785
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:49,134
Look at that star.
Civil Service.

786
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:52,638
-Give me some more of that.
-All right, yeah.

787
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,807
Wait, wait. Back off, scamp.

788
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:58,102
You are addressing
the duly-appointed sheriff of Rock Ridge.

789
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:01,897
Rock Ridge? Hey, the railroad's
going through there.

790
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:20,624
Back up off him, brother!
Don't you rush him, brother. . .

791
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:22,960
. . .and mess up the brother's fines.

792
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:40,853
Well, holy mother of pearl.

793
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:44,607
It's that nigger that went and hit me
on the head with a shovel.

794
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:48,360
Now, what the hell do you think
you're doing with that tin star, boy?

795
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:53,699
Watch that "boy" shit, redneck.
You talking to the sheriff of Rock Ridge.

796
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:57,953
Well, now, if that don't beat all.

797
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,289
Here we take the good time and trouble. . .

798
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:04,543
. . .to slaughter every last Indian in the West,
and for what?

799
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:09,757
So they can appoint a sheriff
that's blacker than any Indian.

800
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,550
I am depressed.

801
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:15,387
Excuse me, Mr. Taggart, sir,
but I sure do hate to see you like this.

802
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:18,390
What if me and the boys
was to shoot that nigger dead?

803
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:21,727
-Would that pep you up some?
-That might help.

804
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:27,858
-All right, boys. On the count of three.
-I wouldn't do that if I were you.

805
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:32,905
Don't pay no attention to that alky.
He can't hold a gun, much less shoot it.

806
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,494
Like I said, on the count of three.

807
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,330
One.

808
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,416
Two.

809
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,085
Three.

810
01:06:56,930 --> 01:07:02,476
Well, don't just sit there looking stupid,
grasping your hands in pain.

811
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:06,271
How about a little applause
for the Waco Kid?

812
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:20,369
All right, I'm through being Mr. Goodbar.

813
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:24,498
The time has come to act, and act quickly.
All of my plans have backfired.

814
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,167
Instead of leaving,
folks are staying in droves.

815
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:31,380
Why don't you admit it.
He's too much of a man for you. I know.

816
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:36,719
You gonna need an army to beat him.
You're finished.

817
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:50,899
Shut up! You Teutonic twat.

818
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:54,153
I must think.

819
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:04,079
Wait a minute. She said "army."

820
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,998
Of course.

821
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:11,336
An army of the worst dregs
ever to soil the face of the West.

822
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:14,214
-Taggart!
-Yes, sir?

823
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:19,303
I've decided to launch an attack
that will reduce Rock Ridge to ashes.

824
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:22,055
-What do you want me to do?
-Round up. . .

825
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:26,685
. . .every vicious criminal and gunslinger
in the West. Take this down.

826
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:31,356
I want rustlers, cutthroats,
murderers, bounty hunters. . .

827
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:36,069
. . .desperadoes, mugs, pugs, thugs,
nitwits, half-wits, dimwits. . .

828
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:41,033

. . .vipers, snipers, con men,
Indian agents, Mexican bandits. . .

829
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:44,578
. . . muggers, buggerers,
bushwhackers, hornswogglers. . .

830
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:48,373
. . . horse thieves, bull dykes, train robbers,
bank robbers, asskickers. . .

831
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:52,085
. . .shitkickers and Methodists!

832
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:56,215
Could you repeat that, sir?

833
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,892
Where's everybody going?

834
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:09,978
Read this.

835
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,409
Well, can't you see that's the last act
of a desperate man?

836
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:29,498
We don't care if it's the first act
of Henry V. We're leaving.

837
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:34,545
Now, wait a minute.
Wait just one doggone minute here.

838
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:40,092
Just give me 24 hours to come up
with a brilliant idea to save our town.

839
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:45,013
-Just 24 hours, that's all I ask.
-No!

840
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:51,186
-You'd do it for Randolph Scott.
-Randolph Scott.

841
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:57,526
All right, sheriff, 24 hours.

842
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,121
Black son of a bitch ! I ought to--

843
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,754
Next!

844
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:03,300
-Qualifications?
-Rape, murder, arson and rape.

845
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:08,013
-You said "rape" twice.
-I like rape.

846
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:13,060
-He'll do.
-Charming. Sign right here.

847
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,979
Take that badge.

848
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,023
Next!

849
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,192
Qualifications?

850
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:23,946
Arson, armed robbery, mayhem--

851
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:27,824
Wait a moment.
What have you got in your mouth?

852
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:34,247
-Nothing.
-Nothing, eh? Lyle.

853
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:40,253
-Gum.
-Chewing gum on line, eh?

854
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:43,882
I hope you brought enough
for everybody.

855
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:48,136
I didn't know there was gonna be
so many.

856
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,977
Boy, is he strict.

857
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:59,064
We gotta get in there close
and find out what's happening.

858
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,483
There's our ticket.

859
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,574
Hey, boys!

860
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:13,745
Look what I got here.

861
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,665
Hey, where the white women at?

862
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,931
Man, that was pretty. I liked that.

863
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:38,770
Be ready to attack Rock Ridge
at noon tomorrow. Here's your badge.

864
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,356
Badges?

865
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:45,277
We don't need no stinking badges!

866
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,612
Next!

867
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:51,074
-Qualifications?
-Stampeding cattle.

868
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:54,619
-That's not much of a crime.
-Through the Vatican?

869
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:58,707
Kinky. Sign here.

870
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:04,463
Why, Rhett, how many times have I told
you to wash up after weekly cross-burning?

871
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,840
See? It's coming off.

872
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:12,054
And now, for my next impression,
Jesse Owens.

873
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:15,557
Seize them! Catch them! Get them!

874
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:21,313
Mount up, men!
We'll head them off at the pass!

875
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:26,485
"Head them off at the pass"?
I hate that cliché.

876
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:47,672
-Say hello.
-Hello.

877
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,175
Listen to me, and listen to me good.

878
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,260
Get all the brothers together.

879
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:56,848
Round up all the lumber, canvas, paint
and nails you can lay your hands on. . .

880
01:13:57,016 --> 01:14:02,145
. . .and meet me tonight, three miles
due east of Rock Ridge at midnight.

881
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:06,316
-You understand? Say goodbye.
-Goodbye.

882
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,693
Thanks a lot, brother.

883
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:13,573
-Get up.
-What's happening?

884
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:17,369
Get up, man. Listen, we gotta get
some nails, canvas and a wagon.

885
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:39,724
Folks, I know you're confused,
wondering what you're doing. . .

886
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:44,479
-. . . in the prairie in the middle of the night.
-You bet your ass!

887
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,064
I'm hip.

888
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:49,943
Now, before the sun comes up,
we're gonna build on this site. . .

889
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:54,072
. . .an exact replica of the town
of Rock Ridge.

890
01:14:56,993 --> 01:15:00,495
Every building, every storefront,
every rock and every tree. . .

891
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:04,374
. . . right down to the orange roof
on Howard Johnson's outhouse.

892
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:09,504
I get it! Tomorrow, when Hedley Lamarr
and his men come riding in. . .

893
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:13,508
. . .to destroy the real Rock Ridge,
they'll destroy the fake Rock Ridge.

894
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:17,929
They'll think it's the real Rock Ridge,
but we'll know it's the fake Rock Ridge.

895
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:21,683
How are we gonna do it?
We ain't got the time or the people.

896
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,269
Wrong! There's why.

897
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:29,399
Who the hell are they?

898
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,529
Railroad workers.

899
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:37,908
They've agreed to help us
make our dream come true.

900
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:42,787
All they ask in return is a little plot of land
they can call their own to homestead.

901
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,915
Now, what do you say?

902
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:55,467
All right. We'll give some land
to the niggers and the Chinks. . .

903
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:58,929
. . . but we don't want the Irish.

904
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:04,601
-Everybody. Come on.
-No deal.

905
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:07,896
Prairie shit.

906
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,314
Everybody.

907
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,654
Oh, Lord!

908
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,989
Do we have the strength. . .

909
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:23,078
. . .to carry on this mighty task
in one night?

910
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:29,000
-Or are we just jerking off?
-Amen.

911
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:39,344
Okay, okay. We have done it.

912
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,596
Now let's see what we have done.

913
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:26,391
Men, you are about to embark
on a great crusade. . .

914
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,894
. . .to stamp out runaway decency
in the West.

915
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:32,856
Now, you will only be risking your lives. . .

916
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:38,570
. . .whilst I will be risking an almost certain
Academy Award nomination. . .

917
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:40,905
. . .for Best Supporting Actor.

918
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,241
Now raise your right hand
for the pledge.

919
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,454
Right!

920
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:52,417
-Now repeat after me. I. . .
-I. . .

921
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,253
-. . .your name. . . .
-. . .your name. . . .

922
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,380
Schmucks.

923
01:17:57,548 --> 01:18:00,550
-Pledge allegiance. . .
-Pledge allegiance. . .

924
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:04,095
-. . .to Hedley Lamarr. . . .
-. . .to Hedy Lamarr. . . .

925
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:07,599
-That's "Hedley"!
-That's Hedley!

926
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:11,269
-And to the evil. . .
-And to the evil. . .

927
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:14,773
-. . .for which he stands.
-. . .for which he stands.

928
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:18,568
Now go do that voodoo. . .

929
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:23,531
. . .that you do so well!

930
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:32,457
Hold it! Hold it!

931
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:36,753
Hold the happiness. We are in trouble.

932
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:39,631
Yep, we forgot one little detail.

933
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:43,593
Nothing's missing. Everything's here,
down to the last hitching post.

934
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:49,557
-People. There's no people.
-Hey, now, don't panic. Don't panic.

935
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,644
We just made a perfect copy
of Rock Ridge.

936
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:56,731
Now all we've got to do
is make perfect copies of ourselves.

937
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:59,984
But they'll be here in half an hour.

938
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,404
Right, so we've got to start working fast.

939
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:06,825
You men start working on the dummies.
Jim and Mongo, come with me.

940
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:10,537
I got an idea that'll slow them down
to a crawl.

941
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:14,833
-All right, let's go.
-Come on, you guys go over there.

942
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:22,424
Yeah, that's nice. That's nice.

943
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,698
Le Petomane Thruway?!

944
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:49,659
Now, what will that asshole think of next?

945
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:55,081
-Has anybody got a dime?
-I don't have any change.

946
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:59,502
Somebody's gotta go back
and get a shitload of dimes.

947
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:11,723
Hurry up. Speed it up.
Hell, we ain't ever gonna get to Rock Ridge.

948
01:20:11,891 --> 01:20:15,226
Come on, move them through.
Move them through.

949
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:24,152
Well, they're through the tollbooth.

950
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,323
Look at this, they're buying it.

951
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:42,086
All right, here we go.
Hold your ears, folks.

952
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,923
It's showtime.

953
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,429
-Nothing.
-What are we gonna do?

954
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:55,892
Any minute now they're gonna discover
that the town is fake and pull out.

955
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,729
Jim, baby. You think you could squeeze off
a little shot from here. . .

956
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:02,941
. . .and set off the dynamite down there?

957
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:05,652
I'll give it a try.

958
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:18,540
Oh, Lord! Keep this man's eye keen.

959
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:21,459
And may God grant--

960
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:34,305
It's a fake!

961
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,140
We've been suckered in!

962
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:57,078
Okay, folks, let's wipe them out!

963
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,854
Forgive me, Lord!

964
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:36,826
You son of a bitch!

965
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:47,629
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

966
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:38,638
All right, cut!

967
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:45,061
Wrong!

968
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:50,441
Okay. Just watch me. It's so simple.

969
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:52,443
You sissy Marys.

970
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:58,282
Give me the playback!
And watch me, faggots.

971
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:10,378
Shit.

972
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,589
-Have you got it?
-Yes.

973
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:16,050
Sounds like steam escaping.

974
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:20,346
Action! Okay, wait till I get out.
Wait till I get out.

975
01:24:20,514 --> 01:24:24,600
Okay. Playback!

976
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,544
Cut!

977
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:57,091
What in the hell do you think
you're doing here? This is a closed set!

978
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:02,597
-Piss on you. I'm working for Mel Brooks.
-Not in the face!

979
01:25:04,183 --> 01:25:05,516
Thank you.

980
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:09,520
They've hit Buddy! Come on, girls!

981
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:23,701
-You vulgar shit!
-Why, you miserable pansy.

982
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:29,624
I'm parked over by the commissary.

983
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:38,549
You brute, you brute, you brute.
You vicious brute!

984
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,803
All right. All right.

985
01:25:55,901 --> 01:26:01,572
-How many days do you have left, Joey?
-They lose me right after the bunker scene.

986
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:04,408
What the hell is that?

987
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:13,876
Get your pies for the great pie fight!

988
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:21,050
This is our studio commissary,
where some Hollywood stars eat.

989
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:22,260
Keep in line.

990
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:32,103
And now we'll go to
the special-effects department.

991
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:40,278
Yankee bean soup, coleslaw
and tuna surprise.

992
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,242
What the fuck's all--?

993
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:22,820
Taxi !

994
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:29,660
Drive me off this picture.

995
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:01,525
You dropped your beads.
One, please.

996
01:28:03,236 --> 01:28:06,238
-Student?
-Are you kidding?

997
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:09,033
Pain in the ass.

998
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:14,080
-Look, Herman, I'm in Hedy Lamarr's shoes!
-Hedley.

999
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,251
Raisinets.

1000
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:31,639
-Hey, watch out. Hey, you.
-Sorry.

1001
01:28:38,897 --> 01:28:40,690
Shit.

1002
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,901
Freeze it.

1003
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:48,239
-Okay, Lamarr, go for your gun.
-Wait, wait, wait.

1004
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:54,120
-I'm unarmed.
-All right, we'll settle it like men.

1005
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:56,622
With our fists.

1006
01:28:56,790 --> 01:29:01,002
Sorry, I just remembered.
I am armed.

1007
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:13,264
How did he do such fantastic stunts
with such little feet?

1008
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:21,897
Wow. You shot the bad guy.

1009
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:28,029
-What do you wanna do now?
-Let's check out the end of the flick.

1010
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:31,449
I sure hope there's a happy ending.
I love a happy ending.

1011
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:40,124
Sheriff, you can't go now. We need you.

1012
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:44,962
My work here is done.
I'm needed elsewhere now.

1013
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:48,090
I'm needed wherever outlaws
rule the West.

1014
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:52,636
Wherever innocent women and children
are afraid to walk the streets.

1015
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:55,806
Wherever a man cannot live
in simple dignity.

1016
01:29:55,974 --> 01:30:00,227
And wherever a people
cry out for justice.

1017
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,855
Bullshit.

1018
01:30:04,775 --> 01:30:06,400
All right, you caught me.

1019
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:09,987
Speak the plain truth,
it's getting pretty damn dull around here.

1020
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:13,699
Good luck, Bart. And God bless you.

1021
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:18,162
Oh, Bart!

1022
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:21,165
Bye, baby bro.

1023
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:26,295
-Keep the faith, brothers!
-Bye!

1024
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:41,936
Where you headed, cowboy?

1025
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:50,277
Nowhere special.

1026
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,530
I always wanted to go there.

1027
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:55,783
Come on.
