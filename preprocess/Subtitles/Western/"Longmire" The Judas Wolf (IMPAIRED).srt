00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:14,775
- [technician] No allergies?
- [Walt] Nope.

2
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:20,219
[technician] No diabetes or
kidney or heart conditions?

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,161
Nope.

4
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,392
No chance you're pregnant?

5
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:24,644
Let's hope not.

6
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:26,997
Okay. All right, climb aboard.

7
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:31,541
[motor whirring]

00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:48,918

[dog barks]

11
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,035
Thor!

12
00:01:07,187 --> 00:01:09,209
[Omar] Enjoy your shoot, Mr. Keslow?

13
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,002
Well, I don't usually bother with birds.

14
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:14,334
Good boy, Thor.

15
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:16,046
But a free trip's a free trip.

16
00:01:16,116 --> 00:01:17,838
[Sawyer] Just think, Dan.

17
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:20,119
You move Keslow Pharmaceuticals
to Absaroka,

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,741
you could be here for elk season.

19
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:25,095
Mm, this fall, I'll be in Zimbabwe.
Come on, Thor!

20
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:27,347
[Omar sighs]

21
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:29,498
Why'd you bring that pompous ass?

22
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:32,272
Hundreds of new jobs in a shit economy,
Omar.

23
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,735
As mayor, I got a lot weighing on me.

24
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,575
[Pinkie] <i>God, I'm dying here.</i>

25
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:43,533
The guy at the store swore
that these boots would be the best.

26
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,996
They totally gave me blisters.

27
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:47,857
How about those birds, Jenk?

28
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,960
You don't have turkeys
like that in Omaha.

29
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,003
I prefer my Wild Turkey in liquid form.

30
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:56,365
Listen, game's not the only thing
that makes Absaroka great.

31
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,339
We got a new casino
that's catnip for tourists.

32
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,160
And with Keslow as a corporate anchor,

33
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:03,884
we're guaranteed the green light
on Sandy's airport.

34
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:05,915
Always the politician.

35
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,638
Look, Sawyer, you know I love Absaroka.

36
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:11,101
Shit, I got a weekend place
not ten miles from here.

37
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:14,354
My problem's not with your county.
It's with your sheriff.

38
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,571
Last man who tried to develop here,
he shot in cold blood.

39
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,867
[Sawyer]
<i>Walt Longmire is not anti-development.</i>

40
00:02:21,972 --> 00:02:24,324
He's just anti-Barlow.

41
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:28,789
I knew Barlow Connally.
Your sheriff sounds like my kind of guy.

42
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,791
Don't worry. Walt's on his way out.

43
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,419
[Dan] <i>What do you mean "out"?</i>

44
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:36,586
Our sheriff's dealing with
a minor legal issue.

45
00:02:37,197 --> 00:02:38,799
Wrongful death.

46
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,171
I play golf with the lawyer
of the Connally estate.

47
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,593
- He's gonna eat Walt for lunch.
- Walt's a good man.

48
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,556
He's a little set in his ways,
but he works hard.

49
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:48,207
[breathing heavily]

50
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,890
Well, he's still an obstacle.

51
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,521
I'll tell you what.

52
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:55,185
I'll consider moving my company here
if you get rid of Longmire.

53
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:57,216
Well, that's easier said than done, Dan.

54
00:02:57,217 --> 00:03:00,480
Of course it is. But real men
don't take no for an answer.

55
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,960
Were all those tests necessary
to check a minor gunshot wound?

56
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,076
Well, and concussion. No.

57
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:26,122
But given how hard it is to get you in
here, I figured I'd do them while I could.

58
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,059
Frankly, I was shocked that you even
kept your follow-up appointment.

59
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,311
Well, I'm trying to be more responsible,
Doc.

60
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:33,854
Whoever she is, thank her for me.

61
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,795
Um, good news.

62
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:38,384
Scan shows a complete resolution
of your TBI.

63
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,946
How's the memory?

64
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,907
Better. I still can't
remember the attack, though.

65
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:47,027
How many head injuries would you say
you've had over the years?

66
00:03:47,097 --> 00:03:49,348
Four or five.

67
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:50,770
That I remember.

68
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:53,352
And you played football...
high school, college.

69
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:54,664
Do you ever get any headaches?

70
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,996
I'm getting one now.

71
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:00,465
We know a lot more about the long-term
effects of concussions than we used to.

72
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,430
- But without sampling your brain tissue...
- I'm still using that, Doc.

73
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,714
Are you?

74
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:08,969
I-I just think a smarter man
probably would've retired by now.

75
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,019
How much longer do you plan
on doing this, Walt?

76
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:14,434
- Is there anything else?
- Uh, your cholesterol's a little high.

77
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,307
- Here's a statin.
- I'll eat more oatmeal.

78
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:18,979
Of course you will.

79
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,377
[police radio chatter]

80
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:44,403
You said you wanted to be more involved?

81
00:04:44,404 --> 00:04:46,035
Well, here you go.

82
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,616
What happened?

83
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:49,469
Jim Pine O.D.'d.

84
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,309
[sighs]

85
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:55,685
Does Mingan know?

86
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:59,099
His son? Yeah. Mingan found him.

87
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:03,462
Jim Pine's the fifth O.D.
since the casino checks went out.

88
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:07,777
Suddenly people have money,
they're, uh, celebrating.

89
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:09,990
Courtesy of this guy.

90
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,352
His name's Joey Takoda.

91
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:15,956
I want Hector to go after him.

92
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:23,293
I am sorry. I cannot do that.

93
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:28,008
Joey Takoda is selling
heroin on the Res.

94
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,931
He's left Mingan Pine
a 14-year-old orphan.

95
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:34,333
Hector is not some Reservation Batman
righting all of society's wrongs.

96
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,114
You know who the dealer is.
Go arrest him.

97
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,347
I have.

98
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,229
Three times.

99
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,102
But I can only hold someone
on a misdemeanor.

100
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:44,003
Dealing's a federal crime.

101
00:05:44,004 --> 00:05:45,965
Now that white people
are dying from heroin,

102
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:48,318
the feds have even less time for us.

103
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:54,603
The Hector we knew never played God.

104
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,407
He stepped in only as a last resort.

105
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,809
Besides, where is Jim Pine's
responsibility in all of this?

106
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,253
You and I both know
that Jim was a junkie.

107
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:05,415
- So he deserved it?
- No.

108
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:08,737
But if we blame Jim's death on this
dealer, why not blame his last one?

109
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:11,160
Or the guy who fired him from
Burger King when he was 22?

110
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:13,473
Why not go after Nighthorse
who sent the checks?

111
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:18,787
So your idea is to do nothing
and let our entire tribe fall apart?

112
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:20,520
Hmm?

113
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,982
Right now, my first priority is Mingan.

114
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:38,998

Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me.

Dad? [breathes heavily]

123
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,124
You scared me. [chuckles]

124
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,477
What are you doing here?

125
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,224
Office warming.

126
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:49,859
Thank you.

127
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,906
So, uh...

128
00:07:53,843 --> 00:07:55,325
You do all this on your own?

129
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:56,576
Yep.

130
00:07:57,557 --> 00:08:00,120
Now that you're here,
you might as well make yourself useful.

131
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,661
Yes, ma'am.

132
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:05,535
- This one?
- Yep.

133
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,882
- Okay.
- Thanks.

[nailgun firing]

135
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:22,552
So, you'll be happy to know I, uh...
I went to see Doc Weston for a physical.

136
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:24,169
What'd he say?

137
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,296
Well, uh...

138
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,232
[nailgun fires]

139
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,983
Well, I got to eat more oatmeal.

[chuckles]

141
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:32,631
- [Walt chuckles]
- So there's nothing to worry about?

142
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:37,026
No, no. Uh... it's that thing.

143
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:39,257
- [Cady] What thing?
- [nailgun fires]

144
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,640
Well, my civil suit. Um...

145
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:43,913
They need a response by Friday.

146
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,295
Dad, you should have answered
that complaint weeks ago.

147
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,671
It's okay. I know you've been busy.

148
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,753
I don't blame you.

149
00:08:54,364 --> 00:08:57,986
Blame me? I'm not your lawyer.

150
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,969
I assumed you would've found someone.

151
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,973
Well, people don't know I'm being sued.
I'd like to keep it that way.

152
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,497
Dad, I-I-I can't represent you.

153
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:10,230
I'm your daughter.

154
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,562
You represented Henry.

155
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:16,595
Yeah, Henry's not a relative,
and he didn't have any options.

156
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:17,857
You do.

157
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:20,700
Options that don't reinforce your guilt.

158
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,412
I'm not guilty.

159
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:31,045
Dad, me representing you confirms
everything they're accusing you of.

160
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:36,296
Cronyism, corruption,
ignoring the rules.

161
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:40,049
And you may not have noticed, but...

162
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:43,303
I have a job.

163
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:44,953
[nailgun fires]

164
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:47,887
- So you're choosing Nighthorse over me.
- [nailgun fires]

165
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,286
Here. Uh, David Milgrom.

166
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:05,974
He's a great civil attorney.

167
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:07,287
Call him.

168
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,223
Thanks for the plant.

169
00:10:25,455 --> 00:10:26,976
[nailgun fires]

170
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:38,387
[Sawyer] I didn't fly Dan all the way
down here to have him go off without me.

171
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,339
You sure he didn't say
where he was going?

172
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,245
Well, I told you,
he and Pinkie left 'fore I got up.

173
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:48,767
You're gonna thank me for these airports
when your hunting trips are sold out.

174
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:52,731
I won't have anything to hunt
when your airport scares off the game.

175
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:56,125
You better hope Walt doesn't catch wind
that you're selling him out.

176
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,657
[Sawyer] Hey.

177
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,260
Isn't that Dan's dog?

178
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,660
[dog whimpering]

179
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,673
[Omar] These dogs don't wander off.

180
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:06,386
Hey, boy. Hey, boy.

181
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,116
Hey, hey.

182
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:10,749
Hey, hey.
Why are you out here all by yours...

183
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,353
[dog whimpers, barks]

184
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,860
What the hell?

185
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,284
If Omar says anything about my divorce,
I'm gonna sock him.

186
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:27,657
Hey, Omar.

187
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,230
Hey, Walt.

188
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,167
Look, I didn't want to call you,
but, uh...

189
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,835
two VIP guests of the mayor are missing.

190
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,457
Who we looking for?

191
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:41,921
CEO of an Omaha pharmaceutical company,
Dan Keslow.

192
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,680
Mayor's been kissing his ass trying to
get him to move his plant to Absaroka.

193
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:47,967
I thought you said there were two VIPs?

194
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:51,811
Yeah. The other one's a wimpy yes-man
they call Pinkie.

195
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:55,003
Anyway, Dan's dogs came back,
but there's no sign of the guys,

196
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:59,819
and the dog... had this in his butt.

197
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:04,073
You, uh...

198
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:06,275
You'll keep this quiet, right?

199
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:08,778
That you lost two VIPs?

200
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,102
I've sank every nickel I own
into this operation, Walt.

201
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:15,665
It ain't fair.

202
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,918
Lifetime of doing good work,
you make one mistake...

203
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:21,541
But then I guess I don't
have to tell you.

204
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:24,504
What do you mean?

205
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:28,798
Well, you know, y... y-your civil suit.

206
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:33,292
Omar, take Vic, start searching.

207
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:37,266
I'll head to camp, get Dan's dog.
Maybe we can catch a scent.

208
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,008
- I'm real good with dogs.
- So am I.

209
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,360
You go with Omar.

210
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,775
Looks like it's just you and me.

211
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:49,619
Keep it in your pants, Vicky.
I'm not in the mood.

212
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,871
[sighs]

213
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:55,724
[vehicle approaches]

214
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:56,916
[vehicle door closes]

215
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:01,170
[hammering]

216
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,971
What do you think?

217
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,019
It's almost an office.

218
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:17,937
Land line. How old school.

219
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,150
Yeah, well,
the cell service sucks out here.

220
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,596
So are you set up enough
to start offering legal advice?

221
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:29,779
[hammering]

222
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,574
Oh. Yes. Of course.

223
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,975
Um...

224
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:39,368
Have a seat. [chuckles]

225
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:42,502
And please don't tell me
that you killed someone.

226
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:47,717
How do I go about becoming a foster
parent for a Cheyenne child?

227
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:50,680
Well, I'd start by not
living over a bar.

228
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:54,594
You're serious?

229
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:56,726
I am.

230
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:58,787
Okay.

231
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:00,309
Um...

232
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,422
The Indian Child Welfare Act
made it a big priority

233
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:05,384
to keep Native kids
with Native families.

234
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:08,608
So that'll work in your favor.

235
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:12,451
You know, once I get my computers up, uh,
I will start the application process.

236
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:15,454
We need to move quickly.
I have a particular boy in mind.

237
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:18,356
Well, I have Internet at home.
I can print out the materials tonight.

238
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,499
And we can start tomorrow.

239
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:28,377
Thank you.

240
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:29,839
You're welcome.

241
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:39,668
[zipper opens]

242
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:42,541
Did either man carry tranquilizer darts?

243
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:44,172
[Jenk] Not Dan.

244
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:46,065
- [urinating]
- He shoots to kill.

245
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:49,177
And the other guy?

246
00:14:49,178 --> 00:14:50,650
[Jenk] Oh.

247
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,073
- I doubt Pinkie's held a gun in his life.
- [zipper closes]

248
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:02,771
Maybe it's another Dick Cheney situation
where one of them shot the other.

249
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:06,005
If Pinkie's so inexperienced,
why did Dan invite him along?

250
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:07,797
Dan needs an audience.

251
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:12,110
You know like they say, if a bear shits
in the woods and nobody saw you shoot it,

252
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,912
did it really die?

253
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,637
Hey, we're wasting time.
We should be out there looking.

254
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:20,059
Wait here, Sandy.
Radio if they come back.

255
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,222
- Let's go, Thor.
- [dog barks]

256
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:27,106
[Sandy] I hope you find him, Longmire.

257
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,779
Hate to find another developer dead
on your watch.

258
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:41,410
This thing is tiny
compared to the bear dart that got me.

259
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,562
Who hunts with these things?

260
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:45,444
Nobody hunts with those.

261
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:49,531
Conservationists use them
to catch and collar medium-size game.

262
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,802
Big cats, wolves, pronghorn.

263
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:55,824
So what's your take on
these missing guys?

264
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:56,995
[chuckles]

265
00:15:56,996 --> 00:16:00,248
Just another entitled asshole
and his lackey.

266
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:03,262
If my career weren't on the line,
I'd let them stay lost.

267
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:07,516
[Sawyer] Too much ground to cover.
We need to get a helicopter.

268
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:11,379
I told Omar I'd keep things quiet.
They've only been gone a few hours.

269
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,552
Sure hope you're not gonna
let your personal feelings

270
00:16:13,553 --> 00:16:15,724
interfere with your duties here, Walt.

271
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,827
I don't have feelings.

272
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:21,621
Everybody knows you're anti-development,
but Absaroka needs jobs,

273
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,732
and this pharmaceutical company
can provide those.

274
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,745
[dog barking]

275
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:37,136
What kind of hunter
leaves his game behind?

276
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:40,179
Same kind that leaves his gun behind.

277
00:16:52,421 --> 00:16:53,362
Pinkie!

278
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,817
What's that around his neck?

279
00:16:57,887 --> 00:16:58,988
Tracking collar.

280
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:00,910
- He still alive?
- Yep.

281
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,823
This thing's got to be choking him.
Won't come off.

282
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:06,605
Where the hell is Dan?

283
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,037
No idea.

284
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,001
What's that?

285
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:15,363
[Sawyer] It's a news clipping.

286
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:16,585
What's it say?

287
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:20,049
[Sawyer] "Serial Killer CEO:
Dan Keslow Must Die."

288
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:24,623
Let's get him out of here. Come on.

289
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:26,055
[grunts]

290
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:35,945
- [breathing heavily]
- Come on. Come on.

291
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:38,818
Come on.

292
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,760
[grunts] Get it off.

293
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,471
I can't... [coughing]

294
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:45,473
Okay. All right.
We're gonna get it off.

295
00:17:45,474 --> 00:17:47,116
We're gonna get it off. Hold still.

296
00:17:49,438 --> 00:17:51,730
Okay. Move your head out of the way.

297
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:53,963
- Hold him still.
- [gags]

298
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:56,796
All right.

299
00:17:57,526 --> 00:17:58,798
- Okay?
- [coughs]

300
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,160
Okay.

301
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:04,162
[gasps]

302
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:07,056
Thank God. [breathing heavily]

303
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:14,894
[Walt] Do you know who did this to you?

304
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:17,697
No.

305
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:20,298
Dan's dog went after something
in the forest.

306
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,610
Dan followed him.

307
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:23,953
I heard a shot.

308
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:27,246
A minute later,
I felt something sharp in my shoulder.

309
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,909
You didn't see who taped
you to that tree?

310
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:34,463
I was taped to a tree?

311
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:35,875
Jesus.

312
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:37,757
Did Dan see anybody?

313
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,378
Wait.

314
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:41,220
Where is Dan?

315
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,781
Dan's missing.

316
00:18:42,782 --> 00:18:44,804
We found this nailed to the tree
above you.

317
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:48,375
Why did I let him bully me
into this trip? I hate guns!

318
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,389
I'm in marketing, for Christ's sake.

319
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:55,463
- Did you know about this?
- The mass execution of endangered wolves?

320
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:56,645
How could I not?

321
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:59,358
We had protestors out in front
of the office for months.

322
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:09,328
Hey, got here as fast as I could.

323
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,649
That's perfect timing.

324
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,042
I need you to take this gentleman
to the hospital,

325
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:16,756
then drive by the weekend house
of his boss, Dan Keslow, who's missing.

326
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:18,356
Vic will give you the address.

327
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,448
Okay. Anything else?

328
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:23,031
Contact Dan's wife,
see if she's heard from him.

329
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:26,675
And, uh, see if she's gotten a call
with a ransom demand.

330
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:29,388
Dan may have been kidnapped
by anti-hunting activists.

331
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,169
Wow.

332
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,063
All right, got it. I think.

333
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:36,755
Come on. Let's get you to the hospital.

334
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:39,478
You might have to fill in some
gaps for me while I drive.

335
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,132
Let's call Game and Fish.

336
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:46,535
Maybe they can help
us track this collar.

337
00:20:05,244 --> 00:20:07,466
- Mingan?
- [knock on door]

338
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,763
[sighs]

339
00:20:44,073 --> 00:20:46,045
[sighs]

340
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:53,392
Mingan, I hope you do not mind
that I let myself in.

341
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,266
What for?

342
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:01,230
I wanted to check on you.

343
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:04,403
And I brought you a gift.

344
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,448
It is a medicine bag.

345
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:15,284
It gave me strength when I needed it
most, and now I want you to have it.

346
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:18,827
You can just leave it on my desk.

347
00:21:18,898 --> 00:21:21,961
No, I cannot.

348
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:25,073
I need you to get out
of the bed, Mingan,

349
00:21:25,074 --> 00:21:29,889
and come here to me
and take it for yourself.

350
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:36,475
The medicine will give you strength,
but you also need to find your own.

351
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,284
[sighs]

352
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:19,229
I want you to know that as bad as things
seem right now, you are going to be okay.

353
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,773
I think I may have found a way
to make sure of that.

354
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:30,949
But first, you need to get dressed
and eat something.

355
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,823
And then I will take you to school.

356
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:52,453
Any word on Keslow, Ruby?

357
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,873
[Ruby] <i>Omar's still out looking.</i>
<i>And the mayor called.</i>

358
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,768
<i>He's trying to get a helicopter up
to help with the search.</i>

359
00:22:57,786 --> 00:23:00,179
Okay, let us know if he finds anything.

360
00:23:07,506 --> 00:23:09,278
[engine shuts off]

361
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,002
[Walt] Pyper Callans?

362
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,915
We understand you're the
expert on wolves in Wyoming.

363
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:28,547
I'm flattered.

364
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,959
What's with the flags?

365
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,031
[Pyper] Oh, they're called fladry.

366
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:35,863
Contrary to popular belief,
wolves are naturally shy.

367
00:23:35,864 --> 00:23:37,956
Anything new scares them.

368
00:23:37,957 --> 00:23:40,868
I'm trying to educate the ranchers
into putting these flags up

369
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,210
and their guns away.

370
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:46,334
Well, Pyper, we're hoping you...
you may be able to help us find a man

371
00:23:46,335 --> 00:23:48,506
who might have been kidnapped
this morning.

372
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:49,858
Dan Keslow.

373
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,261
Dan Keslow was kidnapped?

374
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:55,444
Well, that's a nice piece of news.

375
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:58,886
- You know Dan?
- [Pyper] All conservationists know him.

376
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:02,741
He's the asshole who used a Judas wolf
to destroy the Lone Tree pack.

377
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:04,163
A Judas wolf?

378
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:08,377
A hunter puts a tracking collar
on a wolf and turns him loose.

379
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:13,001
When the wolf returns to his pack,
the hunter follows in a helicopter.

380
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:18,156
Picks off the whole pack from the air,
sparing only the Judas wolf.

381
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:22,931
So now, all alone and inadvertently
having destroyed his whole family,

382
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:26,254
the Judas seeks another pack
to take him in.

383
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:29,398
And the whole thing
starts all over again.

384
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,519
Jesus.

385
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:36,615
Is this the kind of collar
that Dan Keslow would've used?

386
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:37,986
Where'd you get that?

387
00:24:38,057 --> 00:24:41,349
Found around the neck of another hunter.
Dan's colleague.

388
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,284
We found him tranquilized, collared,
and duct-taped to a tree.

389
00:24:45,354 --> 00:24:47,485
[laughs]

390
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,208
How poetic.

391
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,008
Is this the kind of collar that <i>you</i> use?

392
00:24:53,782 --> 00:24:58,387
Conservationists in the field
mostly use the VHF pulse tracker.

393
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:01,220
It lets us track in real time.

394
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,450
That is a GPS.

395
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:06,054
Has a chip in it so it allows you
to download the data remotely.

396
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,256
Thanks for your help.

397
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:12,151
You think of anyone may have used
this collar, let us know.

398
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,613
More likely I'll send them a present.

399
00:25:15,804 --> 00:25:17,406
[chuckles]

400
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:24,602
[Vic] You saw them, right?

401
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:27,876
[Walt] Every conservationist in Wyoming
uses those darts.

402
00:25:27,936 --> 00:25:29,328
It's not enough to bring her in.

403
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:33,462
But it may be worth tracking our wolf
lady's whereabouts these past few days.

404
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,583
Right.

405
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:52,481
What did you find at Dan Keslow's?

406
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,944
[Ferg] Place was dark and locked.
Nothing was disturbed.

407
00:25:56,004 --> 00:25:58,506
There was a FedEx package
on the front porch.

408
00:25:58,507 --> 00:25:59,717
Arrived yesterday.

409
00:25:59,718 --> 00:26:00,909
Who's it from?

410
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:04,823
Someone named Cara Fillmore.
Sent from Omaha.

411
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:08,516
You reach Dan's wife?

412
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:10,249
Valerie. Yeah.

413
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,020
She hasn't heard from him since he left,
but that's normal.

414
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:15,544
She said he rarely calls home
when he's hunting.

415
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:19,237
- Hey, Ruby.
- [Ruby] Hey.

416
00:26:19,238 --> 00:26:20,828
Any ransom demands?

417
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,930
No.

418
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,331
What's all this?

419
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,123
[Ruby] Omar broke down the camp.

420
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:29,228
Jenk's in your office
waiting for his son to pick him up.

421
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:31,890
I hope you don't mind,
but I found something.

422
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:37,446
After Dan shot those wolves,
somebody set up this web page.

423
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:41,069
Looks like a shaming site.
Who set it up?

424
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,012
[Ruby] I don't know, but the comments...
ugh... they're all pretty nasty.

425
00:26:45,013 --> 00:26:47,035
Can you print the names
of the commenters, Ruby?

426
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,557
Already have. Three copies.

427
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:50,869
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

428
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,713
Hey, uh, what do you want me to do
with this?

429
00:26:55,734 --> 00:26:57,376
Open it.

430
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,696
[Walt] Jenk.

431
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:00,469
How's Pinkie doing?

432
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:02,200
Oh, he's at the hospital.

433
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:05,384
They're keeping him overnight
for observation, so...

434
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:07,225
Any word on Dan?

435
00:27:07,286 --> 00:27:09,377
Well...

436
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:14,462
Dan recently drew a lot of heat for, uh,
hunting a pack of endangered wolves.

437
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:17,105
Do you recognize any of the names
on that list?

438
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:21,360
Somebody who may have gone beyond
idle threats?

439
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,262
You know,
I told him not to go posting that photo,

440
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:26,074
but he was so proud of the kill.

441
00:27:27,015 --> 00:27:31,290
Wolves were de-listed for two years.
It was legal at that time.

442
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,481
- Yep.
- [Vic] Holy shit!

443
00:27:33,482 --> 00:27:36,044
Walt, you need to see this.

444
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:38,356
What the hell is that?

445
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,629
That's a guinea pig.

446
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,801
Does that mean something to you?

447
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,662
Maybe.

448
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,966
Did, uh... Cara Fillmore send it?

449
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:50,077
She did.

450
00:27:50,078 --> 00:27:52,601
Well, then, yeah,
it means something to me.

451
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,121
We're a drug company.

452
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:58,256
We, uh, conduct clinical tests
on the drugs before they go to market.

453
00:27:58,257 --> 00:28:02,030
And drug-testing volunteers
call themselves guinea pigs.

454
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:05,614
And Cara Fillmore did clinical trials
for Keslow Pharmaceuticals?

455
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,387
Yeah. She claimed she had side effects.

456
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,949
Ten years later.

457
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,602
Eh, when things go wrong
in people's lives,

458
00:28:14,603 --> 00:28:17,085
they need someone to blame,
so she sued us.

459
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:18,877
Was the company at fault?

460
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,449
Well, she signed a waiver.
She knew what she was doing.

461
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,172
The judge threw her case out.

462
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:27,926
Since then, she just keeps hounding Dan.

463
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:29,217
- [door opens]
- Hello?

464
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:32,790
Hi. I'm just here picking up my dad.

465
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,832
Oh, Sheriff Longmire,
this is my son, Jerrod.

466
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:37,356
- Jerrod, Sheriff Longmire.
- How are you?

467
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,417
Dad, we better get going.
It's a long ride back.

468
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:43,010
Oh. Uh, listen, could I borrow
your little boys' room?

469
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:44,262
Right this way.

470
00:28:44,263 --> 00:28:46,474
Yeah, right here.

471
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,826
Just on the left.

472
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:49,868
Uh, you know...

473
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:56,164
Dan can rub people the wrong way,
but he's not a heartless monster.

474
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,837
His father was my best friend.

475
00:28:58,897 --> 00:29:00,248
Dan's like a son.

476
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:03,752
So anything you need, Sheriff,
we'll get it for you.

477
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:06,214
I know Dan would do the same for me.

478
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:38,526
No.

479
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,979
No! No! No! No!

480
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,822
Mathias! Mathias, help me!

481
00:29:44,823 --> 00:29:46,174
Help me!

482
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:48,967
[crying] No!

483
00:29:56,164 --> 00:29:59,598
The children look at their lives
and see no future.

484
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:01,900
No one stepping up.

485
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:04,443
Nothing ever changing!

486
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:10,137
How am I supposed to protect them?!

[Ferg] Wow.

493
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:30,388
150 posts congratulating
Dan Keslow's kidnappers

494
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,781
and 39 who wish they'd done it.

495
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:35,443
How'd they even know he was kidnapped?

496
00:31:36,224 --> 00:31:37,746
I don't know.

497
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,752
So, what are you working on?

498
00:31:43,812 --> 00:31:46,454
[Vic] I'm running the GPS
data from the collar.

499
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:50,919
Maybe it'll help us narrow down the list
of suspects by giving us a location.

500
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,092
Are you wearing cologne?

501
00:31:54,823 --> 00:31:55,804
What?

502
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,165
Hey, Ruby.

503
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,427
[Ruby] Good morning.

504
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:01,999
Has the mayor called?

505
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,472
No. But your lawyer's here.

506
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:09,688
I didn't call a lawyer.

507

My girlfriend fly-fishes.

508
00:32:13,722 --> 00:32:17,445
I moved all the way from Brooklyn
to stand in ice water up to my hips.

509
00:32:17,516 --> 00:32:20,368
She's great,
but she's gonna give me pneumonia.

510

Dave Milgrom.

511
00:32:27,896 --> 00:32:30,608
Mr. Milgrom, there must be some mistake.

512
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:31,880
I didn't call you.

513
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,861
Your daughter asked me to come.

514
00:32:33,862 --> 00:32:38,056
If the mountain won't go to Muhammad,
Muhammad must go to the mountain.

515
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:43,602
So, Mountain,
tell me about this civil suit.

516
00:32:45,373 --> 00:32:47,686
Well, there's not much to tell.

I'm innocent.

519
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:57,659
Barlow was a big <i>macher,</i>
as we say in New York.

520
00:32:57,766 --> 00:32:59,778
Killing him might not
have been so smart.

521
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:02,240
I would have preferred not to.

522
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:05,283
[Dave] I see here he was stabbed?

523
00:33:05,353 --> 00:33:06,745
I thought he was shot.

524
00:33:06,815 --> 00:33:08,036
He was.

525
00:33:09,147 --> 00:33:10,738
I shot him.

526
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,500
He stabbed himself.

527
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:14,502
But your fingerprints are on the knife.

528
00:33:15,113 --> 00:33:16,254
Yep.

529
00:33:16,324 --> 00:33:18,346
- Okay.
- [knock on door]

530
00:33:19,287 --> 00:33:22,430
Hey. I'm sorry to interrupt.

531
00:33:23,662 --> 00:33:26,054
So I've been running the GPS data
on that wolf collar.

532
00:33:26,124 --> 00:33:30,809
In the last 48 hours,
our wolf has covered 700 miles.

533
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:36,905
He took the I-90 here from Omaha,
the home of Keslow Pharmaceuticals.

534
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:38,907
And Cara Fillmore, our guinea pig.

535
00:33:39,598 --> 00:33:40,528
Yeah.

536
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,120
Right.

537
00:33:43,852 --> 00:33:47,274
- So I-I guess we're done?
- Right now, I got to go to Omaha.

538
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,776
That's ten hours away.

539
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,998
By car.

540
00:33:57,866 --> 00:33:59,928
Thanks for doing this, Omar.

541
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:03,160
Well, if we don't find Dan, I'm ruined.

542
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:05,894
I'm only one bad trip away
from losing everything.

543
00:34:05,954 --> 00:34:09,557
Well, if it helps,
I've got the name of a good lawyer.

Yes?

It's me. I got those
foster applications that you wanted,

549
00:34:34,983 --> 00:34:37,643
so if you want to stop by,
I could walk you through the process.

550
00:34:38,947 --> 00:34:41,970
That is no longer necessary.
Sorry I bothered you.

551
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,431
What happened?

552
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,936
Mingan, uh...

00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:55,443

[clears throat]

578
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:32,991
I understand you were part of a clinical
drug trial for Keslow Pharmaceuticals.

579
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:35,773
I was working my way through college,

580
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:40,588
and Keslow was paying $500
to test a new drug.

581
00:36:40,648 --> 00:36:44,401
I thought it was safe.
It was just a statin for cholesterol.

582
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,594
You know, an old-people drug.

583
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,596
But you had side effects?

584
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:51,248
[Cara] I didn't know anything was wrong
until two years ago

585
00:36:51,249 --> 00:36:53,290
when I was about 20 weeks pregnant.

586
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:55,873
My O.B. found too much protein
in my urine

587
00:36:55,874 --> 00:36:58,436
and she told me I had kidney disease.

588
00:36:58,506 --> 00:37:00,547
My doctor put me on bed rest,

589
00:37:00,548 --> 00:37:04,882
but I developed preeclampsia
and went into labor at 21 weeks.

590
00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:11,079
And... Max was born a micro premie
with severe cerebral palsy.

591
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:16,894
He'll never talk or walk, and...

592
00:37:16,895 --> 00:37:19,377
I feed him through a
hole in his stomach.

593
00:37:20,068 --> 00:37:22,540
And you blame the drug
they tested on you?

594
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:24,963
You're damn right I do.

595
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:31,869
But Keslow, he claimed the pre-eclampsia
caused the kidney damage,

596
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,120
not the other way around.

597
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:37,605
And the judge ended up
throwing the whole case out.

598
00:37:38,546 --> 00:37:41,019
That's when you started threatening Dan.

599
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:45,483
Yeah, that coward
needs to take responsibility.

600
00:37:45,553 --> 00:37:49,277
I don't care about myself, but my son...

601
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,320
[sighs]

602
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:59,417
My son is paying for what he
and his company did to me.

603
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,212
I'm sorry. Uh...

604
00:38:05,323 --> 00:38:08,386
This must be so hard for you
and your husband.

605
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,799
Is he around? May I speak with him?

606
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,842
Jonathan's on vacation.

607
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,095
Without you?

608
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:21,099
[Cara] Max needs full-time care.
One of us has to always be home.

609
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,852
So we vacation in shifts. [chuckles]

610
00:38:24,923 --> 00:38:26,444
Can you tell me where he went?

611
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:32,200
Uh, hunting with some friends, I think,
up north.

612
00:38:32,931 --> 00:38:34,782
Your husband's a hunter?

613
00:38:35,643 --> 00:38:37,205
Isn't everybody?

614
00:38:37,265 --> 00:38:38,746
[Walt] Um...

615
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:47,255
If your, um, husband checks in,
could you have him call me?

616
00:38:50,158 --> 00:38:54,512
Jonathan would never risk jail
doing something stupid.

617
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,834
He loves me.

618
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,887
He'd never leave me alone with this.

619
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,233
I don't care what she says.

620
00:39:09,297 --> 00:39:11,990
Jonathan Fillmore is your guy.

621
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,493
[Walt] I know this case
is important to you, Omar,

622
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,076
but that doesn't give you permission
to steal.

623
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,189
He's a hunter. And I know hunters.

624
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:26,374
And I'd shoot that CEO asshole, too,
if he'd done that to my kid.

625
00:39:28,486 --> 00:39:30,128
Come on, man, let's go.

626
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,633
Walt wants me to talk to Pinkie again.

627
00:39:36,494 --> 00:39:40,728
Maybe he'll recognize this, uh,
Jonathan Fillmore.

628
00:39:40,788 --> 00:39:43,481
I don't know. We'll see.

629
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,649
<i>Where are you?</i>

630
00:39:45,793 --> 00:39:49,817
I found someone on the Dan Must Die
website worth talking to.

631
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,406
I'll catch up with you later.

632
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:59,146
Pyper, you got a minute?

633

You have come
at a supremely suspenseful moment.

Come here.

636
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:15,862
This is a female wolf I'm tracking.

00:40:15,863 --> 00:40:18,556
She's a special favorite of mine.

638
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,849
She challenged the alpha female
in her pack and lost.

639
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,352
She's been on her own for about a year,

640
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:29,607
but today, she's approached another
pack, hoping they'll take her in.

641
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,149
[clears throat]

642
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:32,860
So, uh...

643
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:39,287
I was wondering how all the trolls
on the Dan Must Die website...

644
00:40:40,728 --> 00:40:42,290
knew that he'd been kidnapped.

645
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:44,492
Good news travels.

646
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:45,663
Mm.

647
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,796
We didn't release that information.

648
00:40:49,607 --> 00:40:51,709
I might have said something.

649
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:55,673
Said something or... posted something?

650
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:58,905
'Cause I just found out
that you set up that whole website

651
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:00,907
right after the slaughter
of the Lone Tree pack,

652
00:41:00,908 --> 00:41:02,768
and you've been whipping up hate
ever since.

653
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:05,712
Those sites are just words.

654
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,664
People talk tough when it's anonymous,

655
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:11,418
but on their own, in reality,
they're just cowards.

656
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:13,303
They don't follow through
on those threats.

657
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,614
[Vic] <i>They</i> don't.

658
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,195
But you do.

659
00:41:17,805 --> 00:41:19,987
I checked.

660
00:41:20,058 --> 00:41:23,020
You were removed as the head
of the Utah conservancy chapter

661
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:25,032
for violent and criminal behavior.

662
00:41:25,103 --> 00:41:26,374
That was politics.

663
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:28,815
I read the complaint.

664
00:41:28,816 --> 00:41:30,378
It said assault.

665
00:41:30,438 --> 00:41:33,900
The state legislature took the gray wolf
off the endangered list

666
00:41:33,901 --> 00:41:35,793
as part of a backroom deal.

667
00:41:35,863 --> 00:41:39,946
Their decision was not based on science
or the wolves' best interest,

668
00:41:39,947 --> 00:41:42,039
but purely on money.

669
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,100
And that gives you the right to break
a chair over the congressman's head?

670
00:41:45,123 --> 00:41:47,054
I don't regret what I did.

671
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:51,958
I took a plea.
I came back to the field.

672
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:53,981
It's probably all for the best.

673
00:41:56,924 --> 00:41:59,447
Since you're all alone
out here in the field now,

674
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,469
I suppose that means no one can verify
that you were here

675
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,782
the morning that Dan
Keslow was kidnapped.

676
00:42:04,852 --> 00:42:07,665
And no one can verify I wasn't.

677
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:13,461
If you had any evidence on me,
I would be under arrest.

678
00:42:18,696 --> 00:42:21,139
My girl's been run off again.

679
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:27,935
The world is cruel to females
on their own, no matter the species.

680
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,523
- Hey, hey.
- Officer.

681
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,489
How you feeling, Pinkie?

682
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,810
My name is Ted.

683
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,573
I hate that stupid nickname.

684
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:47,615
I'm sorry. Ted.

685
00:42:47,685 --> 00:42:49,076
Have you found Dan?

686
00:42:49,147 --> 00:42:51,768
No. But we got a few leads.

687
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:55,503
Angry animal activists,
disgruntled drug-test guinea pigs.

688
00:42:58,906 --> 00:43:02,300
Hey, you got... any theories?

689
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,762
Dan kidnapped himself.

690
00:43:06,744 --> 00:43:08,335
I don't follow.

691
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:11,349
Dan set me up. Think about it.

692
00:43:11,419 --> 00:43:15,882
He invited me, someone who's never
hunted, along on this trip,

693
00:43:15,883 --> 00:43:18,526
then takes me out
before everybody else is up

694
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:24,511
so he can shoot me with a tranquilizer gun
and choke me with one of his wolf collars,

695
00:43:24,512 --> 00:43:28,645
then duct-tape me to a tree,
just to humiliate me?

696
00:43:28,646 --> 00:43:31,869
He's probably at his house right now
just laughing his ass off.

697
00:43:31,939 --> 00:43:34,372
Why would Dan want to humiliate you?

698
00:43:34,442 --> 00:43:37,755
To get back at me for humiliating him.

699
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,635
[Ferg] <i>We have a new suspect.</i>

700
00:43:40,738 --> 00:43:42,840
- Who?
- Dan himself.

701
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:47,174
Seems his wife, Valerie Keslow, and Pinkie
have been having an affair for a year.

702
00:43:47,245 --> 00:43:49,427
- Dan found out?
- Pinkie thinks so.

703
00:43:49,497 --> 00:43:51,918
He thinks Dan staged the whole thing
to embarrass him

704
00:43:51,919 --> 00:43:54,019
and is sitting home right now
having a good laugh.

705
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,184
- Omar!
- Yeah.

706
00:43:57,255 --> 00:43:59,567
Are the keys to Dan's house
still in his luggage?

707
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,797
Yeah.

708
00:44:00,798 --> 00:44:01,899
Thanks.

709
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,970
Okay, Ferg.

710
00:44:03,971 --> 00:44:07,074
Let's go pay another visit
to Dan Keslow's house.

711
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:20,838
[vehicle approaching]

712
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,174
Uh-huh.

713
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,646
Yeah, I can get that.

714
00:44:39,507 --> 00:44:40,858
But it'll cost extra.

715
00:44:55,603 --> 00:44:57,204
YOLO, asshole.

716
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,980
[Walt] Dan?

717
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,583
Are you in here?

718
00:46:05,803 --> 00:46:07,764
Dan?

719
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,027
Wake up, Dan. Come on.

720
00:46:11,889 --> 00:46:14,742
- Wake up, Dan. Wake up.
- Wake up.

721
00:46:15,643 --> 00:46:16,954
[groans]

722
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,605
- Wake up, Dan.
- Oh!

723
00:46:18,606 --> 00:46:20,287
- Dan.
- [groaning]

724
00:46:20,898 --> 00:46:24,211
- Come on, come on. Come on.
- Aah!

725
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,714
What is this?!

726
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,785
What is this?! Get this off of me!

727
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:29,927
Calm down, Mr. Keslow.

728
00:46:31,238 --> 00:46:33,511
Aah! I've been stabbed!

729
00:46:33,581 --> 00:46:35,412
Holy shit, I've been stabbed!
[screaming]

730
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:37,304
- Calm down, Mr. Keslow!
- I've been stabbed.

731
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,504
[distorted] Ferg, call an ambulance.

732
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:50,988
Hell, now that you saved Keslow's life,
maybe he won't hate you so much.

733
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,990
Might even consider
moving his company here.

734
00:46:54,762 --> 00:46:57,414
Why would he hate me?
He doesn't even know me.

735
00:46:58,686 --> 00:46:59,747
[Weston] Sheriff?

736
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,826
What's with the audience?
Are you trying to get me fired?

737
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,720
I'm not supposed to be running
expensive MRIs without approval.

738
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,662
Was I right?
Those weren't stab wounds, were they?

739
00:47:15,663 --> 00:47:17,083
No. No, they weren't.

740
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,353
But I didn't find a feather inside him
this time.

741
00:47:19,457 --> 00:47:22,389
Unfortunately,
I didn't find a kidney, either.

742
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,170
Dan's missing a kidney?

743
00:47:24,171 --> 00:47:26,292
The wounds are incisions
from a laparoscopic surgery

744
00:47:26,293 --> 00:47:27,354
done by a professional.

745
00:47:27,425 --> 00:47:30,467
You're telling that me Dan Keslow's
kidney was surgically removed?

746
00:47:30,468 --> 00:47:31,968
Yeah, and believe it or not,

747
00:47:31,969 --> 00:47:34,300
an organ's harvested somewhere
in the world every minute.

748
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:36,393
But it's usually the poor
giving away their organs.

749
00:47:36,394 --> 00:47:38,576
Guys like Dan
are usually on the receiving end.

750
00:47:38,646 --> 00:47:40,618
- Can I see him?
- No, he's sedated.

751
00:47:40,688 --> 00:47:42,228
Just come back in the morning, okay?

752
00:47:42,229 --> 00:47:45,652
And try not to broadcast that
I'm doing these secret favors for you.

753
00:47:45,653 --> 00:47:48,586
The last thing I need
is to get mixed up in your civil suit.

754
00:48:10,838 --> 00:48:13,320
Hurting Joey Takoda is useless.

755
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,193
How can you say that
after what happened to Mingan?

756
00:48:16,263 --> 00:48:18,656
I mean, it is not enough.

757
00:48:20,478 --> 00:48:23,250
We need to think bigger.
I have an idea, but I need your help.

758
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:26,523
The whole reason I need Hector
is because I can't help.

759
00:48:26,524 --> 00:48:28,626
I uphold the law. I can't break it.

760
00:48:28,696 --> 00:48:30,236
Oh.

761
00:48:30,237 --> 00:48:32,299
But you can send me into danger
with no backup?

762
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:36,242
You signed up for this, Henry, with the
first letter you took from that wall.

763
00:48:36,243 --> 00:48:40,206
I can feed you information,
but that's all I can do.

764
00:48:40,207 --> 00:48:42,019
Hector's on his own.

765
00:48:45,543 --> 00:48:49,186
Out of curiosity, what
was it you needed?

766
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:52,399
If there is nothing you can do,
the less you know, the better.

767
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,704
<i>It's wabbit season.</i>

768
00:49:00,728 --> 00:49:02,308
[laughs]

769
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,941
- [knock on door]
<i>- Oh, boy, wabbit tracks!</i>

770
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,293
Thought you'd like a visitor.

771
00:49:06,353 --> 00:49:09,065
Hey! Oh, good boy!

772
00:49:09,066 --> 00:49:12,209
Good boy, yeah. Come on.

773
00:49:12,279 --> 00:49:14,632
Don't usually allow animals here, but...

774
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,703
Well, the nurses seem to like me, so...

775
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:17,805
[Dan chuckling] Hey.

776
00:49:17,825 --> 00:49:19,176
How you feeling this morning?

777
00:49:19,246 --> 00:49:23,180
Like I want to get back to work.
But the doctor won't let me go.

778
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:26,013
Mr. Keslow,
they just took your kidney out of you.

779
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,441
<i>- Okay, wabbit...</i>
- [turns off TV]

780
00:49:30,047 --> 00:49:33,440
Doc Weston said you have no recollection
of the operation.

781
00:49:35,012 --> 00:49:36,553
I remember shooting a turkey.

782
00:49:36,554 --> 00:49:38,424
Then something hit me
in the back of the leg.

783
00:49:38,425 --> 00:49:41,118
Next thing I know,
I'm waking up in my own bed.

784
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:45,202
You received some death threats from
activists because of your wolf hunting.

785
00:49:45,272 --> 00:49:47,393
Those people are babies.

786
00:49:47,394 --> 00:49:50,087
They shout
because they're too scared to shoot.

787
00:49:50,147 --> 00:49:52,630
Anyway, they should be grateful.

788
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:57,504
After I took out that pack, Wyoming put
gray wolves back on the endangered list.

789
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,007
Does this man seem familiar?

790
00:50:00,908 --> 00:50:02,038
Should he?

791
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:05,763
That's Jonathan Fillmore,
the husband of Cara Fillmore.

792
00:50:06,453 --> 00:50:07,834
Oh, the whiner.

793
00:50:07,835 --> 00:50:11,047
Listen, she was an adult
when she signed up for that drug trial.

794
00:50:11,048 --> 00:50:12,879
No one held a gun to her head.

795
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,402
She's just one more person
looking for a check.

796
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:20,698
You don't seem too concerned
about finding out who stole your kidney.

797
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,701
It's done.
It's not like I'm gonna get it back.

798
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,703
At least I've got Thor.

799
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:29,036
Right?
You'd never betray me, would you, buddy?

800
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:31,749
Is your wife getting here soon?

801
00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:33,881
I told her not to bother.

802
00:50:33,941 --> 00:50:36,532
Oh, good boy.

803
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,795
Sit.

804
00:50:37,865 --> 00:50:39,827
That's a good boy.

805
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,056
[Walt] <i>The wolf collar was a ruse.</i>

806
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:48,395
The kidnapper just used the GPS collar and
the newspaper clipping to throw us off,

807
00:50:48,455 --> 00:50:50,347
buying time for the surgery.

808
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:55,381
Cara Fillmore suffered permanent
kidney damage from the drug she tested.

809
00:50:55,382 --> 00:50:59,316
Maybe her husband kidnapped Dan
to get a replacement for her.

810
00:50:59,386 --> 00:51:00,858
What's Dan think?

811
00:51:00,928 --> 00:51:03,389
Well, he seems
surprisingly uninterested.

812
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,011
- [knock on door]
- Yep.

813
00:51:05,012 --> 00:51:08,035
Walter, Ted Sarton's here.

814
00:51:09,516 --> 00:51:11,288
Pinkie.

815
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:13,420
Right. Show him in.

816
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,462
Right this way, sir.

817
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:24,200
You wanted to see me, Sheriff?

818
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:26,093
Yeah, take a seat.

819
00:51:29,206 --> 00:51:31,878
I wanted to thank you
for sending us to Dan's house.

820
00:51:31,879 --> 00:51:34,772
He was there,
just where you guessed he'd be.

821
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,234
He was? How was he?

822
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:39,446
How do you think he was?

823
00:51:40,217 --> 00:51:41,779
Angry?

824
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,241
Well, surprisingly not.

825
00:51:44,932 --> 00:51:46,243
Um...

826
00:51:47,394 --> 00:51:49,907
- Do you mind if I make a phone call?
- To Dan's wife?

827
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,290
I told them about the affair.

828
00:51:58,696 --> 00:51:59,837
Yes.

829
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,318
I'm gonna call his wife.

830
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:06,303
After what he did to me,
I have to warn Valerie.

831
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,124
Well, I got to say,

832
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:12,179
he didn't seem very interested in her,
either, when I brought her up.

833
00:52:12,249 --> 00:52:14,641
That's because he's faking it.

834
00:52:15,462 --> 00:52:17,463
He came after me.

835
00:52:17,464 --> 00:52:19,436
He's gonna go after her.

836
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:22,069
Take a seat.

837
00:52:26,093 --> 00:52:28,245
I don't think he did this.

838
00:52:28,305 --> 00:52:30,497
Why not?

839
00:52:30,557 --> 00:52:32,558
Thor.

840
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,311
I think Dan would shoot you.

841
00:52:35,312 --> 00:52:37,664
I'm not sure he'd shoot his dog.

842
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:43,510
I think it more likely that, uh,
you and Valerie staged the whole thing.

843
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:47,965
That collar around your neck, that was
traced to Omaha, where you both live.

844
00:52:48,035 --> 00:52:52,429
And you and Valerie certainly knew
about the hunting controversy.

845
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,893
One thing I don't get.

846
00:52:56,794 --> 00:52:59,295
Why not kill Dan?

847
00:52:59,296 --> 00:53:01,068
Why just take his kidney?

848
00:53:01,128 --> 00:53:02,969
What?

849
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:05,511
Someone took Dan's kidney?

850
00:53:05,512 --> 00:53:06,613
That's crazy.

851
00:53:07,975 --> 00:53:09,326
And ironic.

852
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,288
What's ironic about it?

853
00:53:11,348 --> 00:53:17,233
A year ago, Dan sent a company-wide e-mail
asking everybody to get a blood test.

854
00:53:17,234 --> 00:53:20,878
He was looking for a match for someone
who needed a kidney transplant.

855
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:24,091
Do you know who the blood drive was for?

856
00:53:24,151 --> 00:53:26,492
The e-mail said someone
in the Keslow family.

857
00:53:26,493 --> 00:53:27,845
That's what he called us.

858
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:32,469
Knowing Dan, I figured it was for him.

859
00:53:32,539 --> 00:53:35,893
Well, Dan's kidney is
gone, not replaced.

860
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,414
Valerie and I didn't do this.

861
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,317
We're totally healthy.

862
00:53:41,048 --> 00:53:46,443
And if it wasn't Dan, then who the
hell duct-taped me to a tree?

863
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:55,242
[Walt] Uh...

864
00:53:55,853 --> 00:54:00,417
Get the names and contact information
of all of Dan's employees in Omaha.

865
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:04,041
And his close relatives.
Maybe "family" really meant family.

866
00:54:04,111 --> 00:54:05,422
Okay.

867
00:54:09,076 --> 00:54:10,797
[sighs]

868
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,644
[urinating]

869
00:54:24,051 --> 00:54:26,132
Ruby!

870
00:54:26,133 --> 00:54:27,774
Call Omar!

871
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:46,003
[knock on door]

872
00:54:47,324 --> 00:54:48,945
Jerrod, is your father in?

873
00:54:48,946 --> 00:54:51,969
Uh, he's upstairs resting right now.
Can you come back later?

874
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,180
Nope.

875
00:54:56,834 --> 00:54:59,056
[Jenk breathing heavily]

876
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,409
Sheriff.

877
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:15,202
What brings you to Omaha?

878
00:55:15,262 --> 00:55:17,433
Dan Keslow's kidney.

879
00:55:17,434 --> 00:55:19,616
That's what you have inside your body,
right?

880
00:55:21,148 --> 00:55:24,041
What, you want to cut it out and check?

881
00:55:24,111 --> 00:55:25,872
Well, I'm hoping it
doesn't come to that.

882
00:55:25,903 --> 00:55:28,123
Sheriff, I think you should go.
My dad needs to rest.

883
00:55:28,155 --> 00:55:30,696
You were in quite a hurry
to get your father home.

884
00:55:30,697 --> 00:55:34,221
Was that because you had a surgeon
and an unwilling kidney donor waiting?

885
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,162
There's no way for you to prove that...

886
00:55:36,163 --> 00:55:38,055
Enough, enough, Jerrod. Enough.

887
00:55:39,786 --> 00:55:42,099
I'd give you the kidney back if I could.

888
00:55:42,169 --> 00:55:43,640
Scout's honor.

889
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:48,735
I honestly didn't know where it
came from until about an hour ago.

890
00:55:48,795 --> 00:55:53,280
Jenk, a guy with your money and your
means, there are legal ways to do this.

891
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:58,474
Yeah, well, I was rejected
by all the transplant registries.

892
00:55:58,475 --> 00:56:03,000
Who wants to waste a prime organ
on an old booze-hound like me?

893
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,293
And I'd accepted it.

894
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,545
I guess my son hadn't.

895
00:56:09,907 --> 00:56:13,260
I lost my mother when I was young.
I wasn't about to lose my dad, too.

896
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:20,177
You know, Jerrod says that
Pinkie and Dan never saw him.

897
00:56:20,247 --> 00:56:22,389
Nobody but Dan even knew Dad was sick.

898
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:24,141
How'd you figure that out?

899
00:56:24,211 --> 00:56:29,045
I noticed your dad had to, uh...
take care of business pretty often.

900
00:56:29,046 --> 00:56:31,528
That's a classic sign of kidney disease.

901
00:56:32,259 --> 00:56:35,322
So you're the Keslow family member
that needed a kidney.

902
00:56:36,053 --> 00:56:37,893
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

903
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:43,660
But after the blood drive,
Dan told me that there were no matches.

904
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:45,332
[Jerrod] But there was one.

905
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,234
I found out that Dan Keslow was a match,
that lying coward.

906
00:56:48,235 --> 00:56:49,655
He...

907
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,919
He had a chance to save my Dad's life,
and he refused.

908
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:56,713
So you convinced him with
a tranquilizer gun and illegal surgery?

909
00:56:56,783 --> 00:56:59,455
We were just playing by Dan's rules.

910
00:56:59,456 --> 00:57:02,889
He always says,
"Real men don't take no for an answer."

911
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:06,933
All right, so what... so what now?
You gonna take me to jail?

912
00:57:07,004 --> 00:57:09,776
- No.
- I'm afraid that's not up to you.

913
00:57:09,836 --> 00:57:12,439
But it is up to Dan Keslow.

914
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:17,114
He says we're good.

915
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,244
This is a release form.

916
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,315
When did Dan send that?

917
00:57:29,316 --> 00:57:32,028
Faxed it over about an hour ago.

918
00:57:32,029 --> 00:57:36,633
Donating his kidney after the fact
and indemnifying Jerrod and me.

919
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:42,008
You know, men will go to great lengths
to prove that they're not cowards.

920
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,762
Especially if they really are.

921
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:02,028
This is quite a spread.

922
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:04,161
Yep.

923
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:06,743
Is this where he, uh...

924
00:58:07,604 --> 00:58:08,535
Yep.

925
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:14,000
So what brings you out here, Mr.
Milgrom?

926
00:58:15,362 --> 00:58:16,963
I brought you your file...

927
00:58:17,784 --> 00:58:20,847
and my, uh, legal opinion.

928
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:23,510
You should settle this case.

929
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,143
Settle? Why?

930
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:29,516
Mm, $1,500, for a start.

931
00:58:31,548 --> 00:58:33,589
That's all I'd owe Barlow?

932
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,631
No, that's what you'd owe me
and my billable hours

933
00:58:35,632 --> 00:58:37,063
if I was on the clock today.

934
00:58:37,134 --> 00:58:41,017
Lawsuits are expensive,
and Barlow's estate has deep pockets.

935
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:46,163
Even if you win, it's gonna cost you,
so I say settle.

936
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:48,915
Get back to enjoying this view.

937
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,360
How about this?

938
00:58:54,361 --> 00:58:58,114
I hire you, I don't settle.

939
00:58:58,115 --> 00:59:01,508
It's time Barlow took no for an answer.

940
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:03,989
Okay, then.

941
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,762
More money for me.

942
00:59:11,128 --> 00:59:12,309
[car alarm chirps]

943
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:22,159
Yo, tell Ozzie 15 minutes.
I'm on my way.

944
00:59:34,861 --> 00:59:37,083
[fire crackling]

945
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,757
[gun clicks]

946
01:00:00,547 --> 01:00:02,848
[Henry] Looking for this?

947
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,362
Please don't, man!
That's my whole stash!

948
01:00:05,432 --> 01:00:07,103
[Henry]
You're a traitor to your people!

949
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:10,617
You don't just push heroin.
You push death and despair.

950
01:00:11,268 --> 01:00:12,579
Aah!

951
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,961
