You comin'?

172
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:46,907
I make it a habit
not to get involved
in government affairs.

173
00:19:22,176 --> 00:19:23,727
What is it?

174
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:33,687
CURLY: Railway workers' pay
is comin' up this month.

175
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,238
It'll mean
some good money.

176
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,307
We don't rob
the Express.

177
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,142
We might make
an exception.

178
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,151
All right, I'll be
with you in a minute.

179
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,588
Unless you got
a problem with that?

180
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,269
I'm hoping you gentlemen
might put down those weapons

181

You don't mind
if we take a look?

184
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:14,444
There's nothing
valuable here.

185
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:17,931
Well, you'll forgive me
if I don't take your
word for it, won't you?

gonna do with him?

it'll be necessary.

they don't tell us when
it's comin' in exactly

because, you know,
that's for our own protection

311
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,678
they say because, you know,
road agents and bandits

312
00:30:31,745 --> 00:30:34,947
they'd do just about
anything to get their
hands on that kinda money.

I like to think that
you are my friend,

335
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:55,779
we're just, uh, different
kind of friends, so.

(GUN FIRES)

337
00:32:02,636 --> 00:32:03,986
Oh, shit.

338
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:09,709
It helps me sleep.

339
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,630
Yup.

342
00:32:25,692 --> 00:32:27,993
Alice told me
I'd find you here.

343
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:39,989
Well, that's not bad
for shootin' leaves.

344
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:41,808
Let's see how you do
with a moving target.

(GUN FIRES)

346
00:32:45,662 --> 00:32:47,847
Well, a little slower
than I remember,

347
00:32:47,915 --> 00:32:50,900
but that's probably on
account of the whiskey.

(SCOFFS)

350
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:17,877
Dad was tryin'
to tell me somethin'
as he was dying.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

I know you're losing

00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,114
I overheard you and Alice.

354
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,378

(SIGHS)

356
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,649
I think that's what Dad
was trying to tell me.

357
00:33:58,068 --> 00:33:59,469
Oh?

358
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,306
I wanna help.

359
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:08,645
Well, John, unless you got
$5,000 squirreled away,

360
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:10,613
I'm afraid we're movin'.

361
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:14,183
That's a lot of money, Rudd.

362
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:16,769
Ain't no way to come by
it honestly, I'm afraid.

363
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:21,991
I don't do that anymore.

364
00:34:25,012 --> 00:34:26,478
Yeah, I know.

365
00:34:31,118 --> 00:34:35,020
I am due a few hundred on
account of Dad's passing.

366
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:37,056
You are more than
welcome to that.

367
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:40,126
I appreciate that.

(LAUGHS)
That was all me.

Well, obviously
you're still drunk
because that was me.

You are still
so full of shit.

Be careful.

00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,538
There are explosives
back there.

I'll be comin' for that.

(GROANS)

385
00:37:19,152 --> 00:37:20,319
This could get real messy.

00:37:21,488 --> 00:37:22,721
Move along now.

387
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,847
I said, move along!

388
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:32,181
Move out!

389
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:02,645
You okay?

390
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,883
Yeah.

391
00:38:11,471 --> 00:38:13,656
I should start chargin'
for medical attention.

392
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,074
I'd pay for it.

394
00:38:22,482 --> 00:38:24,583

I gotta tie up.

Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

around these parts?

Born not five minutes
from here.

398
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:57,600
I can't stand this
god-forsaken place.

399
00:39:00,169 --> 00:39:03,021
I can't wait
till I get back east.

It's civilized back there.

a man can get a decent
bottle of Scotch.

I'm lookin' for someone.

403
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:17,820
Anyone in particular?

404
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:21,073
Of course,
someone in particular.

405
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,409
A fellow named
John Mason.

406
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:27,163
I got three dead in Missouri
on account of him.

407
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,132
A man's gotta answer
for his crimes.

408
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,569
I mean, even if the victims
were devoid of any semblance

409
00:39:34,637 --> 00:39:39,141
of moral rectitude,
the law is the law.

410
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:45,615
Well, spoken like
a real concerned citizen.

411
00:39:45,682 --> 00:39:49,352
I imagine
that kind of concern
comes with a nice reward.

412
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:55,240
Yeah, I know John Mason.

413
00:39:55,308 --> 00:39:57,759
He came through Promise
not two days back

414
00:39:57,827 --> 00:40:00,629
lookin' for supplies
for a long trip.

415
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:03,031
Any idea which way
he was headed?

416
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,887
Sure could
use myself a drink.

417
00:40:13,826 --> 00:40:16,395
He mentioned Nevada.

418
00:40:16,462 --> 00:40:18,630
He said he had business
in Carson City.

419

Nevada.

420

Well, that there
ain't Scotch.

421
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:29,791
It's Bourbon.

422

From Kentucky!

423
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,681
Well, that's where Bourbon
comes from, doesn't it?

424
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:39,001
Well, you'd be surprised on
what passes for Bourbon
around these parts.

425
00:40:44,658 --> 00:40:46,342
Mind if I be
keepin' that?

426
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,711
Not at all.

427
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,113

Yeah, easy, boss.

00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,875
I'm gonna
take my share.

435
00:41:55,912 --> 00:41:57,847
Good afternoon, Sheriff!

436
00:41:57,914 --> 00:41:59,799
You're Dad Mason's son.

437
00:41:59,866 --> 00:42:01,050
John.

438
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:04,220
The name is Hayden.

439
00:42:04,287 --> 00:42:06,655
I ought to arrest you
where you stand.

440
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:12,077
You and Alice Gordon
used to steal
my daddy's crab apples.

441
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:14,180
I'll give you this,
you were fast as hell.

442
00:42:14,247 --> 00:42:16,482
You still run like that?
Only when I have to.

443
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:19,468
Well, your father
was a good man.

444
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,787
Thank you, Sheriff.

445
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,372
Still lookin' to get
the men that did him.

446
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,776
The masked road agents
started up last year,

447
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:29,011
small time robbin'.

448
00:42:29,078 --> 00:42:31,980
They usually work over
the border in Montana.

449
00:42:32,048 --> 00:42:34,350
Never killed no one
before Dad.

450
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:37,836
Well, I'd appreciate
you keepin' me informed.

451
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:40,690
Thanks again.

453
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:53,602
Take it off.

Please.

455
00:42:58,007 --> 00:43:00,509
I was thinkin'
I'd meet McClure
at the station.

456
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:02,177
Oh, that's your trouble.

457
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:04,846
Too much thinkin'.

458
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,540
No, no,
he's all right, boys.

459
00:43:14,607 --> 00:43:16,391
He's a friend.
Come on in.

460
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,895
Hey, what kept you?

461
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:21,480
Oh...

462
00:43:21,547 --> 00:43:22,848
Yeah, never mind.

463
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:24,766
Look at this.
We got the money.

464
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,602
Who else knows
about this?

465
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,870
Nobody.

466
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:31,840
What about
those two gorillas?

467
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:33,993
Oh, yeah, I trust them
like I trust you, John,

468
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:35,310
with my life.

469
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:36,979
That's the rail workers'
pay, huh?

470
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,214
Yeah.

471
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:45,020
It's a lot of money.

472
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:46,421
Yep.

473
00:43:49,643 --> 00:43:51,694
So, you comin'
to the Double Cross
for supper tonight?

474
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:53,528
I'll be there.
Atta boy.

475
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:57,399
So, what do you
think of Alice?

476
00:43:57,466 --> 00:43:58,667
She's pretty swell, huh?

477
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:02,354
Oh, yeah, no, she's...
She's real swell.

478
00:44:02,421 --> 00:44:04,056
Yeah.
Yeah.

479
00:44:18,855 --> 00:44:20,139
Alice Gordon?

480
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,757
(COCKING)

481
00:44:23,944 --> 00:44:25,811
And from
the sound of that,

482
00:44:25,878 --> 00:44:29,181
I would say that
that is a peacemaker.

483
00:44:29,248 --> 00:44:31,366
Well, if you know
this weapon then, uh,

484
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:33,752
I'm guessing you have
some understanding
of the mischief

485
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,722
it could cause
with a man's features.

486
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:44,730
May I come in?

487
00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:52,872
He's supposed to have
killed a fellow in Tulsa
over a box of cigars.

488
00:44:53,506 --> 00:44:55,107
(CHUCKLES)

489
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:57,176
A box of cigars.

490
00:44:57,244 --> 00:44:59,144
Can you believe that?

491
00:44:59,146 --> 00:45:00,579
No, John ain't like that.

492
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:05,150
Look, Miss Gordon,
you have no idea what
Dodge City can do to a man.

493
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:08,370
John Mason was sheriff there
for a while,

494
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:09,805
a good one.

495
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,408
Until things went bad.

496
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:16,145
And then really bad

497
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,881
as things sometimes do
in Dodge City.

498
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:22,267
May I offer you a drink?

499
00:45:22,335 --> 00:45:24,052
What do you want with John?

500
00:45:25,538 --> 00:45:27,539
What do I want with John?

501
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:34,529
Did you ever hear
the story about him
winning his freedom

502
00:45:34,597 --> 00:45:38,200
from this hellhole
of a prison in Mexico?

503
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,418
About cutting cards
with this rich kid?

504
00:45:40,486 --> 00:45:46,591
This kid who was a piece
of uneducated, loathsome...

505
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:52,014
I can't use the word in
the presence of a lady.

506
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:55,667
I love being in the presence
of a smart, beautiful woman.

507
00:45:55,735 --> 00:45:57,068
What genius!

508
00:45:57,136 --> 00:46:01,640
What a wonder that God
would take Adam's rib
and create Eve.

509
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:03,392
Brilliant.

510
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:06,027
Just brilliant.

511
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:07,896
(CHUCKLES)

512
00:46:07,963 --> 00:46:11,466
Anyway, apparently
the prison was overcrowded

513
00:46:11,534 --> 00:46:13,202
and they had just
brought in the Gaston Gang

514
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:15,204
and they needed room
to lock them up.

515
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:17,372
Have you not heard
of the Gaston Gang?

516
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,807
No, I have not.

517
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:22,678
Ah, nasty, very nasty.

518
00:46:22,745 --> 00:46:25,063
Anyway, to make
a long story short,

519
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:29,418
the rich kid and John
were forced to cut cards

520
00:46:29,485 --> 00:46:32,387
to see
who would be set free

521
00:46:32,455 --> 00:46:35,290
and who would rot in hell.

522
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:37,459
Then John pulled
the big spade.

523
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:39,494
(CHUCKLES)

524
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:42,864
Lucky, huh?

525
00:46:42,932 --> 00:46:45,534
What are the odds
of him doing that?

526
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:47,769
One in fifty-two.

527
00:46:49,138 --> 00:46:50,439
Yes.

528
00:46:50,506 --> 00:46:52,608
Yes, one in fifty-two.

529
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:57,078
I had the opportunity
to speak to two
of the Gaston Gang

530
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:58,697
who had been there

531
00:46:58,764 --> 00:47:02,317
and they said that John
didn't touch the cards,

532
00:47:02,368 --> 00:47:06,187
that the guards cut
the deck for them.

533
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,857
But the kid's family back
east doesn't believe that.

534
00:47:08,924 --> 00:47:12,461
They think John cheated
and because the kid
died in prison,

535
00:47:12,528 --> 00:47:14,612
they want their
pound of flesh

536
00:47:14,764 --> 00:47:17,582
and that's why
they hired me,
to go find him.

537
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,436
And that's why
I want John Mason.

538
00:47:20,503 --> 00:47:22,888
Because when
I bring him in,

539
00:47:22,956 --> 00:47:24,957
or bring in
what's left of him,

540
00:47:26,025 --> 00:47:29,194
that'll settle
all my debts,

541
00:47:29,262 --> 00:47:30,595
give me
a little money to...

542
00:47:30,663 --> 00:47:31,997
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

543
00:47:32,065 --> 00:47:34,283
The aroma of you
is exquisite.

544
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:36,101
You are
a magnificent woman.

545
00:47:36,169 --> 00:47:38,770
You know, I think you
should get the fuck
out of my house.

(GUN COCKING)

547
00:47:41,975 --> 00:47:44,376
You're not only
magnificent,

548
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:47,279
you are very,
very persuasive.

549
00:47:52,201 --> 00:47:53,952
COCHRANE: Hello, John.

550
00:47:58,191 --> 00:48:00,625
I missed ya
at the ranch.

551
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:02,544
It's a little nicer
than your other place,

552
00:48:02,612 --> 00:48:05,547
but that shack
had its charms.

553
00:48:05,648 --> 00:48:07,132
To be honest with ya,
I miss it.

554
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,101
I'm sure you do.

555
00:48:10,636 --> 00:48:13,371
You know, I had a nice,
little garden there.

556
00:48:13,439 --> 00:48:14,923
That was a garden?

557
00:48:14,991 --> 00:48:16,207
(COCHRANE LAUGHS)

558
00:48:23,582 --> 00:48:26,518
You have to be
gentle with a garden.

559
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:31,022
Did I tell you
I nearly got hold of you up

560
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,492
in Medicine Hat
a year ago?

561
00:48:33,593 --> 00:48:36,645
That would have been
real nice to catch up.

562
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:40,416
Alice is a very
impressive woman.

563
00:48:40,483 --> 00:48:41,633
Very.

564
00:48:44,537 --> 00:48:45,954
John.

565
00:48:50,426 --> 00:48:52,444
They made me a marshal.

566
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,231
How's it feel?

567
00:48:58,484 --> 00:49:00,752
It's interesting.

568
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,987
The reward
is dead or alive,

569
00:49:03,055 --> 00:49:07,876
but I get a $500 bonus
if I bring you in alive.

570
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:10,912
You give me your word
that you won't run,

571
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,731
I'll give you
a little time.

572
00:49:16,636 --> 00:49:18,803
I appreciate it.

573
00:49:18,871 --> 00:49:20,505
I hear tell there's
an establishment

574
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:22,540
up at Great Falls.

575

Madam Kara's?

576
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:26,461
Madam Kara's.

577
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:28,964
Now would that still be
open for business?

578
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:31,149
Excellent.

579
00:49:31,884 --> 00:49:33,117
Excellent.

You come alone.

00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:50,452
I know I don't need
to mention this,

but if you did decide
not to appear,

585
00:49:56,242 --> 00:49:58,143
I would kill everyone.

586
00:50:00,045 --> 00:50:03,365
Absolutely everyone.

587
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,248
Trouble?

Just a man lookin' for
a quiet place to retire.

589

He could do a fuck
of a lot better than
Promise, Wyoming.

Eh, I dunno.

591
00:50:30,926 --> 00:50:33,128

some word on one of

ALICE:
What's that, Rudd?

597
00:52:41,073 --> 00:52:44,226
Me and the Dixie Boys
were on our way to
pick up them new hogs.

598
00:52:44,293 --> 00:52:45,694
Then we came upon them.

599
00:52:52,184 --> 00:52:53,568
They're all dead.

600
00:52:56,322 --> 00:52:57,705
You sure?

601
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:01,026
Undertaker has them
at the church.

602
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,298
Let's go take a look.

603
00:53:06,365 --> 00:53:08,717
It doesn't make
a whole lot of sense.

604
00:53:08,784 --> 00:53:10,585
They all had
masks on 'em.

605
00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:12,621
And two of 'em swore
up and down they were
the ones who done it.

606
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:14,022
These are Cochrane's boys.

607

What are they doing
robbin' the Express?

608
00:53:15,925 --> 00:53:17,191
The money?

609
00:53:17,259 --> 00:53:18,727
I don't see Cochrane.

610
00:53:19,495 --> 00:53:21,062
No?
No.

611
00:53:22,698 --> 00:53:24,833
I killed 'em all
pretty near.

612
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,501
Pretty near
might not do it.

Good job!

Did Mason tell you about
the plan that he had
to catch the outlaws?

617

Before you killed them,
I mean.

618
00:53:47,189 --> 00:53:50,826
Mason wanted to use
the rail workers' money
as a lure,

619
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:52,327
flush 'em out.

Well, John and I
do know a little bit
about outlawin'.

some outlawin'?

Oh, we did some.

624
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,342
And then
we did some more.

625
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:10,712
Yeah, I think maybe
you should slow down.

626

I think I would like
to hear about this.

that was a long time ago.

You killed my father.
Who was in on it, huh?

658
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:15,604
It wasn't personal.
Who?

659
00:56:15,671 --> 00:56:17,389
Who was in on it?
It was...

00:56:24,713 --> 00:56:26,330
He was going for
your other gun, John.

Rudd!

664
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:29,100
I swear, Sheriff.

665
00:56:29,168 --> 00:56:31,452
He was going for
Mason's other gun.

666

667

He's got
the double X brand.

668

This man look
familiar to you?

00:56:43,849 --> 00:56:45,450
Huh?

670
00:56:45,517 --> 00:56:47,985
He looks like a cowhand
that maybe we had
a couple months back,

671
00:56:48,254 --> 00:56:50,271
but, I mean, John,
they come and go!

683
00:58:12,788 --> 00:58:14,689
Shouldn't we get
permission first?

684
00:58:15,991 --> 00:58:17,759
Or some assistance?

(GRUNTS) That's one.

You know, Dad talked
a lot about you.

Did he?

691
00:58:52,527 --> 00:58:55,196
Yeah.

692
00:58:55,263 --> 00:58:58,633

in Texas as a marshal?

Nothing.

Well, Dad says...

697
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,844
Well, he said that
you could shoot
the button off

at 100 yards.

I just hit one of 'em.

how are we gonna get

about that?

give her away.

I know
you took it, John.

821
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,011
Yeah, I took the money.

822
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:09,780
I also know
you killed my father.

823
01:11:13,501 --> 01:11:17,387
Deputy, take Mr. Mason
into custody.

824
01:11:17,389 --> 01:11:20,457
Sheriff's department
just got a little smaller.

825
01:11:20,525 --> 01:11:22,293
We had to let
a few of 'em go.

826
01:11:26,497 --> 01:11:27,881
(LAUGHS)

827
01:11:27,949 --> 01:11:29,449
Don't do it, John.

828
01:11:29,517 --> 01:11:30,917
Shut the fuck up,
Greyson.

829
01:11:33,305 --> 01:11:35,656
Are you gonna put
the money back?

830
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:38,308
It doesn't seem to be
the safest place for it.

831
01:11:39,844 --> 01:11:42,229
CURLY: John Mason,

832
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:44,832
you're under arrest for
stealing federal money

833
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,784
and assaulting
a peace officer.

834
01:11:47,035 --> 01:11:48,819
You weren't a peace officer
when I assaulted you,

835
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:50,587
you sure as shit ain't
a peace officer now.

836
01:11:50,655 --> 01:11:51,572
No!

837
01:11:51,639 --> 01:11:53,407
Don't!

838
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:55,475
You get your hands
off him!

839
01:11:58,413 --> 01:11:59,930
You son of a bitch!

840
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,636
ALICE: Let me go!

841
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:27,434
(GROANING)

842
01:13:31,072 --> 01:13:33,207
RUDD: It was an accident.
Sure.

843
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:38,779
The marshal's comin' up
day after tomorrow.

844
01:13:38,846 --> 01:13:40,814
Gonna be askin'
a whole lot
of questions.

845
01:13:40,882 --> 01:13:42,599
Yeah, well, if two
of those questions are,

846
01:13:42,666 --> 01:13:44,868
"Where's the money?"
And "Who killed Dad Mason?"

847
01:13:44,936 --> 01:13:47,054
I might be able
to help him out.

848
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:49,439
You're gonna wanna
get me that money.

849
01:13:53,111 --> 01:13:54,678
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

850
01:13:54,746 --> 01:13:56,546
Dad saw your brand.

851
01:13:59,451 --> 01:14:01,385
I ain't losin' the
Double Cross, John.

852
01:14:01,453 --> 01:14:03,954
I never really cared
for that name.

853
01:14:04,021 --> 01:14:06,156
I can see how
it's fitting though.

854
01:14:10,495 --> 01:14:12,079
I love my sister, Mason.

855
01:14:13,565 --> 01:14:14,714
But look into my eyes

856
01:14:14,782 --> 01:14:18,135
so you know that
I'm telling you the truth.

857
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:21,071
I will sacrifice her
to save the ranch

858
01:14:21,139 --> 01:14:23,740
that my daddy worked
so hard to build.

859
01:14:25,276 --> 01:14:27,043
Now get me my money.

860
01:14:31,065 --> 01:14:33,734
I'm gonna give you an hour
to get out of town.

861
01:14:38,289 --> 01:14:41,558
How is it that you're
the one threatening me,

862
01:14:41,626 --> 01:14:43,627
yet you're the one
behind bars?

863
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:45,612
Maybe you didn't
hear me.

864
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,447
Alice's life
is in your hands.

865
01:14:53,638 --> 01:14:55,489
JOHN: Fifty-nine minutes.

866
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,684
Jesus Christ, Rudd!

867
01:15:06,751 --> 01:15:08,368
What the hell
are you doin'?

868
01:15:10,654 --> 01:15:12,522
Now's not a good time, Ben.

869
01:15:17,194 --> 01:15:18,294
Okay.

870
01:15:20,598 --> 01:15:23,400
Is there somethin'
going on between
John Mason and Alice?

871
01:15:27,688 --> 01:15:30,357
I don't know if it's
anything serious,
but, um,

872
01:15:31,826 --> 01:15:33,127
it's goin' on.

873
01:15:39,233 --> 01:15:40,334
Okay.

874
01:15:54,131 --> 01:15:55,666
Those bullets meant
for John?

875
01:15:57,718 --> 01:15:59,686
They're in case
we need to talk.

876
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:03,257
Talk.

877
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:07,727
I want you to stay here.

878
01:16:07,795 --> 01:16:09,863
Curly will keep
an eye on you.

879
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:22,475
JOHN: They're gonna
hang you, you know.
Shut up.

880
01:16:22,543 --> 01:16:24,144
Hey, it's true.

881
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:26,146
You know, they say
a hanging man

882
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:28,448
shits himself
100 % of the time.

883
01:16:30,418 --> 01:16:32,519
Shut the fuck up!

884
01:16:32,586 --> 01:16:35,004
You're the one going
to hang for killing
them Pinkertons.

885
01:16:35,072 --> 01:16:36,256
What?

886
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:39,459
I said Pinkertons.

887
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:41,461
What?

888
01:16:43,764 --> 01:16:45,933
Pinkertons.

889
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,968
I'm sorry, I can't
understand a word
you are saying.

890
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:50,070
You mumble,
you know that?

891
01:16:51,156 --> 01:16:53,757
Open your ears,
Cincinnati John Mason.

892
01:16:54,542 --> 01:16:58,378
I said Pinkertons.

893
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:00,864
Oh.
Yeah.

894
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:03,016
JOHN: I told you!

895
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,085

I ain't never been
to Cincinnati.

899
01:17:28,042 --> 01:17:31,762
You're not gonna give me
any trouble, are you?

900
01:17:31,829 --> 01:17:33,029
Your brother did
what he had to.

901
01:17:33,097 --> 01:17:34,414
For you.

902
01:17:37,234 --> 01:17:39,002
I could do something
for you.

903
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,338
Okay.

904
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,058
What?

905
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:45,408
You hard of hearin'?

906
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:49,279
Well, what exactly
you sayin'?

907
01:17:49,347 --> 01:17:50,864
Do I gotta spell it out
for you?

908
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:51,998
(CHUCKLES)

909
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:55,235
No, ma'am.

910
01:17:59,757 --> 01:18:01,442
Nice and slow.

911
01:18:05,446 --> 01:18:07,614
Uh-uh.

912
01:18:07,682 --> 01:18:10,617
Everyone knows you
keep a Derringer under
your pillow, darlin'.

913
01:18:18,809 --> 01:18:20,127
(GUN FIRES)

914
01:18:22,213 --> 01:18:23,947
I had to switch
hidin' places.

915
01:18:24,015 --> 01:18:25,966
And it ain't no
fuckin' Derringer.

916
01:18:26,033 --> 01:18:27,617
Now how's about
you keep that little
hand cannon of yours

917
01:18:27,685 --> 01:18:29,069
inside its holster

918
01:18:29,136 --> 01:18:30,370
so that I don't have
to shoot you again

919
01:18:30,438 --> 01:18:32,205
and get your blood
dirtying up my pretty dress.

920
01:18:37,195 --> 01:18:40,964
You boys got your
stories straight for
when the marshal comes?

921
01:18:41,032 --> 01:18:42,999
We get Mason to get
the money for us,

922
01:18:43,067 --> 01:18:46,469
then his word
against ours,
Mason gets arrested.

923
01:18:46,537 --> 01:18:47,938
You got it?

924
01:18:49,006 --> 01:18:50,540
And no killin'.

Would you mind
giving me a hand?

01:19:31,549 --> 01:19:33,583
Oh, looks like
you almost got it.

929
01:19:35,152 --> 01:19:36,836
We're gonna need McClure.

Great.

So do I.

942
01:22:01,999 --> 01:22:04,918
I need you to do
somethin' for me.

Get her out of town,
wait it out.

I'll come for you
when it's over.

You know, I really wish
you didn't make me do this.

if you don't let me go,

I swear to God
I'll kill you myself!

get set down right here.

Ben McClure,
did you do somethin'?

958
01:23:03,911 --> 01:23:05,579
Greyson and Curly
are dead.

Mason and Alice
are gone.

960
01:23:08,482 --> 01:23:10,083

the tin?

It can't hurt.

himself all drunk
and jealous

out of your guns.

gonna do you much good
without bullets.

983
01:26:18,906 --> 01:26:20,123
You know,
it's a funny thing
when you take

984
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:21,858
the bullets out
of a man's gun.

985
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,694
It changes the weight.

986
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:28,881

(GROANING)

990
01:27:18,148 --> 01:27:19,648
That's enough.

991
01:27:21,017 --> 01:27:22,985
Put 'em down, Mason.

992
01:27:39,236 --> 01:27:40,502
It's over, Rudd.

993
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:44,307
Come on.

994
01:27:44,375 --> 01:27:46,008
Put down the gun.

995
01:27:48,729 --> 01:27:50,629
There's no more
money left.

996
01:28:03,426 --> 01:28:04,927
You son of a bitch!

997
01:28:06,696 --> 01:28:07,914
BEN: Hey, John?

998
01:28:10,283 --> 01:28:11,134
Hey.

999
01:28:12,702 --> 01:28:14,054
Oh, shit.
Yep.

1000
01:28:14,971 --> 01:28:16,872
It's all good.

1001
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:18,741
I'm okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1002
01:28:18,808 --> 01:28:20,042
Rudd's boys
took the ring.

1003
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:21,644
We'll talk
about it later.

1004
01:28:21,712 --> 01:28:22,845
Is he okay?

1005
01:28:22,913 --> 01:28:24,814
Yeah, he's gonna live.
Come on.

1006
01:28:24,882 --> 01:28:26,515
Okay, I got you.
I got you.

1007
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,441
Dad wasn't supposed
to be at the Express.

1008
01:28:36,944 --> 01:28:39,045
We all got some place
we gotta be.

1009
01:28:39,113 --> 01:28:40,663
Eloquently put.

1010

(COCHRANE LAUGHING)

1011
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:47,987
You die first.

1012
01:28:48,055 --> 01:28:49,172
No, Alice...

1013
01:28:49,239 --> 01:28:52,024
Hey, put down your gun.

1014
01:28:52,092 --> 01:28:54,994
Now, looks like
your luck's finally
run out, John Mason.

1015
01:28:56,797 --> 01:28:58,147
You got a badge.

1016
01:28:59,816 --> 01:29:03,552
Your gardening
got boring for you,
did it?

1017
01:29:05,855 --> 01:29:07,190
Gentlemen?

1018
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:15,180
You're here for Mason.

1019
01:29:15,248 --> 01:29:18,017
No, I'm not here for Mason.

1020
01:29:18,084 --> 01:29:20,853
It was Mason that
found me bleedin'
like a stuck pig

1021
01:29:20,921 --> 01:29:24,390
in the bushes near where
you left me for dead,
you son of a bitch!

1022
01:29:25,325 --> 01:29:27,092
You killed four good men.

1023
01:29:28,278 --> 01:29:29,996
Take him away.

1024
01:29:34,735 --> 01:29:39,255
Now, don't lose these.

1025
01:29:39,322 --> 01:29:41,357
Make sure he doesn't
lose these.

1026
01:29:42,659 --> 01:29:45,962
This paper sets you
free and clear

1027
01:29:46,029 --> 01:29:48,430
as far as Missouri
is concerned

1028
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:51,800
and this is a telegram

1029
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:57,757
from the people back east
saying that they accept
my conclusion

1030
01:29:57,824 --> 01:30:00,976
that you are not
responsible for what
transpired in Mexico.

1031
01:30:05,916 --> 01:30:08,150
Sorry I couldn't do
anything about Ohio.

1032
01:30:08,218 --> 01:30:10,636
Hey...
I know.

1033
01:30:10,704 --> 01:30:12,889
You've never been
in Cincinnati.

1034
01:30:12,956 --> 01:30:14,290
(LAUGHS)

1035
01:30:14,357 --> 01:30:15,925
John.

1036
01:30:15,992 --> 01:30:18,144
I got a train
takin' me east.

1037
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:19,979
I'm never comin'
back here.

1038
01:30:21,932 --> 01:30:25,651
I always thought
I was gonna bid farewell
to you and you'd be dead.

1039
01:30:25,719 --> 01:30:27,253
But you're not.

1040
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:29,588
Congratulations.

1041
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:31,573
Goodbye, John.

1042
01:30:36,346 --> 01:30:37,880
Goodbye, Miss Gordon.

COCHRANE:
I hate the west!

1044
01:30:48,792 --> 01:30:52,044
I don't suppose you'll
help me explain to
the railway company

1045
01:30:52,112 --> 01:30:54,146
what happened to that
extra money, huh?

1046
01:30:54,214 --> 01:30:56,516
What extra money?

1047
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:59,418
Let's just say
I left a little out
of those bags

1048
01:30:59,486 --> 01:31:00,853
that just exploded.

1049
01:31:00,921 --> 01:31:02,855
How much is a little?

1050
01:31:02,923 --> 01:31:04,924
Eh, I dunno.
Roughly.

1051
01:31:06,326 --> 01:31:08,460
Somewhere in
the neighborhood

1052
01:31:08,529 --> 01:31:09,996
of $5,000.

1053
01:31:16,553 --> 01:31:19,322
JOHN: You ever been
to Cincinnati?
ALICE: (LAUGHING) No.
