321
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:25,727
...and two whores for every politician.

322
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:26,979
[Men chuckle]

323
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:30,440
If there was gold in the delta,
I'd go there. How's business?

324
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:34,987
We're pulling low-grade ore out
of number five, but it's about played out.

325
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,658
We went down 20 feet more in 12 shaft,
got only manganite, and shut it down.

326
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:43,328
And that vein in Cobalt Canyon
is wearing thin, too.

327
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,497
What about Carbon?

328
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:50,335
We ran another raid through there
a few days back and scared them good.

329
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,590
We damn near run them out,
lock, stock, and barrel.

330
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,303
COY: So?

331
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:04,183
Seems a stranger came through
and pulled them together.

332
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:05,934
Ain't that right?

333
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:08,687
Yeah, he pulled them together.

334
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:11,190
This one stranger did that?

335
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,110
I expect you boys didn't explain to him
just who we are.

336
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:20,157
I expect that once you explain things
to him, he'll decide to move on!

337
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:23,160
There ain't much for a preacher
to do here, right?

338
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:24,286
A preacher?

339
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:26,747
You let a preacher into Carbon Canyon?

340
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:30,834
We didn't invite him! He took up with Hull.

341
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:33,837
What's wrong with a preacher?

342
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,008
When I left, those tin pans
had all but given up.

343
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:40,469
COY: Their spirit was nearly broken.

344
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:42,846
And a man without spirit is whipped.

345
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:45,849
But a preacher, he could give them faith.

346
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,813
Shit! One ounce of faith, they'll be dug
in deeper than ticks on a hound.

347
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:56,693
You boys throw a rope around that man.
You bring him to me!

348
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:00,405
COY: No, don't.

349
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:05,577
If we get too rough, we'll make a martyr
out of him. Don't want that.

350
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:09,456
- That's true.
- You didn't get no help from Sacramento?

351
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:12,084
COY: Sacramento ain't worth moose piss!

352
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:15,796
JOSH: They didn't sign the writ?

353
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,464
COY: Not only that...

354
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:23,762
...some of them bastard politicians
want to do away with hydraulic mining.

355
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:27,099
COY: "Raping the land," they call it.

356
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,103
We got to move on Carbon,
and move fast and dig deep.

357
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:36,775
Because the way the wind's blowing,
we may be out of business soon.

358
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,778
COY: And those tin pans have got to go!

359
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:42,156
And that preacher!

360
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,074
We'll have to find a way to deal with him.

361
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:45,534
We'll have to find a way to deal with him.

362

MEGAN: Were Grandma and Grandpa
happy when you got married?

363
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:55,836
SARAH: They didn't have a thimbleful
of choice in the matter.

364
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,297
MEGAN: Were they surprised?

365
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,800
SARAH: Grandpa took the measles,
and Grandma got drunk.

366
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,720
I suppose you could say
it surprised them some.

367
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:07,389
MEGAN: Because they thought
you weren't old enough?

368
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:10,267
Your grandma was 15
when she got married.

369
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:13,937
No, I think what riled them
was who I married.

370
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,650
Will you be happy married to Hull?

371
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,487
Who says I'm marrying Hull?

372
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,697
He's nice enough, isn't he?

373
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:26,825
Yes.

374
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:28,702
He's nice.

375
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:34,124
Do preachers get married?

376
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,505
I don't see why not.

377
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:44,176
How do I look?

378
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:48,514
You look lovely.

It's a nugget! The biggest damn nugget
I've ever seen.

Look here. Look at that!

Almost as beautiful as Sarah.

Yeah, it figures.

388

It came from underneath that boulder.

Can we go into town?

I don't think that's a very good idea.

That would clear your credit, wouldn't it?

Why not? We've got as much right in town
as the next person.

COY: When I heard
a parson had come to town...

430
00:43:57,763 --> 00:44:01,934
...I had an image of a pale, scrawny,
Bible-thumping Easterner...

...with a linen handkerchief and bad lungs.

COY: It occurred to me it must
be difficult for a man of faith...

...to carry the message
on an empty stomach, so to speak.

437
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:23,372
I thought...

438
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:27,543
...why not invite this devout
and humble man to preach in town?

439
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:31,922
COY: Why not let the town be his parish?
In fact...

440
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:35,300
...why not build him a brand-new church?

441
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:41,890
I can see where a preacher'd be
mighty tempted by an offer like that.

Oh, indeed.

443
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:49,356
Then he'd be thinking about getting himself
a batch of new clothes.

We'd have them tailor-made.

Then he'd start thinking
about those Sunday collections.

those rights, you'd have exercised them.

COY: There is a man, a marshal.

477
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:32,019
He keeps the peace, if you take
my meaning. His name is Stockburn.

478
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:35,063
And he won't be as patient as me.

479
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:42,446
These people in Carbon Canyon,
would you pay cash for their claims?

480
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:45,574
Buy them out?

481
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:50,746
I'd do anything to prevent bloodshed.
How about $100 a head?

482
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,207
How about $1,000?

483

[Coy laughs, others join in]

484

I'll tell you what: I'll go up to $125.

485
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:09,848
Stockburn and his deputies
will cost you a lot more than that.

486
00:48:12,768 --> 00:48:14,269
How would you know?

487
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:17,564
How much is it worth
to have a clear conscience?

488

[Coy sighs]

489
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:24,780
$1,000 per claim then.

But I want them out of here in 24 hours!

to pay off Sparters.

Well, do something, Hull!

What were you doing in there?

497
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:17,332
LaHood was buying me a drink.

498

LaHood was buying me a drink.

All those in favor?

502
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:29,344
MINER LEADER: Are any opposed?
MINERS: Nay.

503
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:36,768
SPIDER: Me and LaHood's seen a lot
of ground together, starting back in '55.

504
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:39,605
He may be greedy, but he ain't no fool.

505
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:44,568
If he offers $1,000 a claim,
it's because it's worth five times that.

506
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:47,988
GRIZZLED MINER: The way LaHood works,
maybe. The way we work...

507
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:50,491
... we're lucky to see $1,000 a year.

508

I say we take his offer.

509
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:59,500
Suppose you struck a thousand bucks
in nuggets.

510

Would you quit and blow town?
Or keep digging?

SPIDER: What do you say, Preacher?

512
00:50:13,263 --> 00:50:16,934
PREACHER: What I say doesn't matter.
It's your sweat he's buying.

513

Why don't you sleep on it,
make the decision in the morning?

514
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:26,026
What if we don't decide in the morning?
What happens if we can't decide?

515
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:29,363
Then I suppose LaHood'll take that as no.

516
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:31,406
EV: Then what?

517
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:34,159
He said he'd call in a marshal.

518
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,912
HULL: What kind of a threat is that?

519
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:39,665
We have nothing to fear from the law.

520
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:43,001
This is no ordinary kind of marshal.

521
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:46,922
His name is Stockburn.
He travels with six deputies.

522
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:50,467
And they uphold whatever law
pays them the most.

523
00:50:50,551 --> 00:50:53,971
Killing is a way of life with them.
I'm telling you this...

524
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:57,891
...because if you decide against
LaHood's offer, you'll meet him.

525
00:50:58,684 --> 00:51:00,727
You know this Stockburn?

526
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:04,898
I've heard of him.

527
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:11,029
We all know what we're up against.

528
00:51:12,156 --> 00:51:16,493
He ain't just saying, "Take my offer. "
He's saying, "Take it or else. "

529
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:19,663
We're family men.
We're no match for seven guns.

530
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:23,125
HULL: Yeah, but how many of us are there?
Twenty?

531
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:28,130
I heard the preacher.
I know these men are professionals.

532
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:31,049
But it's still twenty against seven, ain't it?

533
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:35,679
HULL: And we know how to pull
a damn trigger, don't we?

534
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:37,264
MINERS: Yeah.

535
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:41,768
If it comes down to it,
I'll fight before I'll quit my claim...

536
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:45,355
...but, damn it, LaHood's offer's fair.

537
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:49,610
EV: I still vote we take his money
and we start afresh elsewhere.

538
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:53,322
Starting fresh sounds good
when you're in trouble...

539
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:56,950
...but before we vote to pack up
and leave...

540
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,870
...I think we should ask why we're here.

541
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:04,458
If it's no more than money,
then we're no better than LaHood himself.

542
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,128
Spider here asked a question.

543
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:12,633
If any of us turned up $1,000 worth
of nuggets, would he quit? Hell, no!

544
00:52:12,966 --> 00:52:15,636
He'd build his family a better house...

545
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:18,430
...and buy his kids better clothes...

546
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,850
... maybe build a school...

547
00:52:22,643 --> 00:52:23,977
...or a church.

548
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:27,397
If we were farmers, we'd be planting crops.

549
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:30,776
If we raised cattle, we'd tend them.
But we're miners...

550
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:32,861
... so we dig and pan...

551
00:52:33,862 --> 00:52:35,614
... and break our backs for gold.

552
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:39,451
But gold ain't what we're about.
It ain't what I'm about.

553
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:44,414
I came out here to raise a family.
This is my home.

554
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:48,126
This is my dream. I've sunk roots here.

555
00:52:49,795 --> 00:52:53,799
And we all have buried members
of our families in this ground.

556
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:58,554
And this is their dream, too,
and they died for it.

557

Now we're going to take $1,000
and leave their graves untended?

We owe them more than that.

559
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:09,648
We owe ourselves more.

on our dignity next time?
