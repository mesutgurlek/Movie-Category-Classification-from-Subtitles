00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,361
(SINGING) Get
comfortable now, people,

3
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:32,700
and a story I will tell
about a group of women

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,569
who were rowdier than hell.

5
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:41,509
Out there in the rugged west
where men are dumb as dirt,

6
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:46,214
trying just to stay alive
and keep from getting hurt.

7
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:49,049
Rowdy girls.

8
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:54,122
Sit tight and watch the
story of the rowdy girls.

9
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:01,262
While preparations were
making for his departure,

10
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:04,498
the Roman ladies take a step,
which was a perfect novelty

11
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,600
in the Republic.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,338
About 20 years before when
Hannibal was ravaging Italy

13
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:13,641
and when the treasury was
very low, a tribune of people

14
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:17,978
named Opius had got a law
passed that no woman should

15
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,514
wear above half an ounce
of gold in ornaments,

16
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:24,952
or wear purple, or
ride in a chariot,

17
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,488
either at Rome or
within a mile of it,

18
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:32,360
unless she went to assist
at public sacrifice.

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,961
The ladies had
conformed themselves

20
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,497
to this law in a time
of general distress,

21
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,065
but they thought it
intolerable to the

22
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,801
under the restraint of
it now when the Republic

23
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,670
abounded with riches.

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,239
And they made a great
stir to get it repealed.

25
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,441
The consulship of
the austere Cato

26
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,110
seemed a very improper time
for moving this affair,

27
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,882
but their passion for
finery would brook no delay.

28
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:59,720
They prevailed with Valerius and
Fendanias, two of the tribunes,

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,623
to present their request
to the comeechia.

30
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,893
And contrary to custom,
ran thither themselves.

31
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,162
Neither the orders
of their husbands,

32
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:11,732
nor the rules of decency,
nor public authority

33
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,767
could keep them at home.

34
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:17,638
But there is no mischief of
which that sex is not capable

35
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:21,442
if you allow them to hold
amongst themselves assemblies,

36
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,845
private parties, and gossipings.

38
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,022
(SINGING) This yarn
spins back to 1886,

39
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:40,928
where we meet a desperate
woman tired of turning tricks.

40
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:46,434
She'd do most anything to make
a break from that bordello

41
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:51,171
and head out west to find
herself a decent fellow.

42
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:57,578
Velvet was raised
inside a house where

43
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,480
the beds creaked till dawn.

44
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,483
But her mama gave
her hope and pride

45
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,385
that kept her spirit strong.

46
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,791
Rowdy girls.

47
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:15,663
The rough and tumble
story of the rowdy girls.

[knock on door]

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,261
VELVET: Go away.

50
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,529
I'm sending another one up.

VELVET: No, you're not.

52
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:51,699
Velvet.

53
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,103
Now you know you
can't keep doing this.

54
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,343
You know you're Monsieur
Walkins' favorite.

55
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:05,045
Well, tell Mr. Walkins
that I'm under the curse.

56
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,680
Now move on.

57
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,248
I can't just go
down there and--

58
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,317
I said move on!

or woman who provokes her will.

When Billy Poke led the gang,
they all were doomed to hang.

But Mick was meaner still,
and she always shot to kill.

what that does to me.

(SINGING) Sarah was arranged
to wed a Texan Calahan.

00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:13,954
But her heart was crying out
for the San Francisco Bay.

98
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:20,027
So she begged her beau, Rory,
to take her there by hand

99
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:24,632
and left a tear-stained
note for dear old dad.

SARAH (VOICEOVER): Dear
Father, I am sorry to leave

without saying goodbye.

I cannot marry Mr. Calahan
as you have arranged.

My intention is to
go to San Francisco.

I know you don't approve of
Rory, but he is a good man.

No, I can't.

go with you anyway.

It was so easy.

bank robbing gets me.

you something new.

Keep talking, honey.

155
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,799
I crawled on my
belly to the back.

156
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,836
I put the two keys in the safe.

157
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:49,702
That's a little tight.

There was the money,
just sitting there,

161
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,417
waiting for me to take it.

162
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:09,589
Are you sure you
closed the safe?

163
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,757
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:11,758
I locked it.

165
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:14,027
And nobody saw
you on the street?

00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:14,962
No.

167
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,496
Are you sure?

168
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,797
Yeah.

169
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,999
I done told you.

170
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,103
Tell me you're my girl.

171
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:32,779
Tell me.

172
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,318
I ain't your girl, Cole.

173
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,752
I ain't nobody's girl.

174
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,854
I told you that.

175
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,556
[muffled shouting]

176
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,259
You know why I ain't
your girl, Cole?

177
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,230
'Cause you're stupid.

178
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,635
Maybe someday, I'll
be somebody's girl.

179
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,237
I don't know who.

180
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,772
Sure ain't gonna be you.

181
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,375
Had so many men, I
can't remember them all.

182
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:07,147
But I gotta tell you,
out of all of them,

183
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,616
damn, you're the worst.

184
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:10,984
[muffled shouting]

185
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:14,121
Now settle down, Cole.

186
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,589
I'm taking all my
money, do you hear me?

187
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:09,509
I love you, Velvet.

188
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,248
Damn, Cole.

189
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,184
Now see, this is what
I'm talking about.

190
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:19,486
That's so stupid.

191
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,922
How many times do I have
to tell you to think ahead?

192
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,724
But I love you, Velvet.

193
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:29,129
And you hurt me real bad.

194
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,097
No.

195
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,564
I don't have time for this.

196
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:43,543
Now Sweetwater is a friendly
and fairly quiet old town.

197
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,212
Though some of the
husbands around here

198
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:48,481
wish that Joe Pepper would
tame that friendliness down.

199
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,717
The Pepper Brothers,
Joe and Sam,

200
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,752
well, they're Sweetwater law.

201
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,855
But Sam's doing all the
work while Joe fools around

202
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,824
back there behind the stalls.

203
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,759
That's just boredom
talking though.

204
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,262
Someday, he'll learn
to fight against hate.

205
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,564
Hopefully, for Sam's sake,
it doesn't happen too late.

206
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,114
MRS. WHEELER: Oh yeah.

207
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,882
Mrs. Wheeler.

208
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:23,882
Joe.

209
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,053
Sam.

210
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,220
No, no, no.

211
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,655
No, Sam, this isn't
what it looks like.

212
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,889
Uh-uh.

213
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,858
Look, I-- I was just helping
Mrs. Wheeler find her--

214
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,294
SAM: Don't explain to
me, little brother.

215
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,596
Tell Mr. Wheeler when he gets
here in about five minutes.

216
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,597
Five minutes?

217
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,099
Oh my god.

218
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,537
Joe.

219
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,008
Sam.

220
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,014
I swear, Joe, you're
gonna get one of us

221
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,016
killed if you don't learn
how to keep them britches up.

222
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,260
You've seen enough.

223
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,061
Damn it, Billy.

224
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,929
You almost poked my eye out.

225
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:10,797
Mick, am I right?

226
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:13,032
It's the perfect
spot to take it.

227
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,702
Mick, we're wasting our time
with this Sweetwater stage.

228
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,837
It's too far out for payroll.

229
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,339
Exactly.

230
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,973
You know they're
switching stages.

231
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,343
Yeah, but not this one.

232
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:26,813
We do what I say.

233
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:27,813
Huh?

234
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,817
(SARCASTICALLY) Good plan.

235
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,485
You poking fun at me?

236
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,487
I wouldn't do that.

237
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,322
You're Billy Poke.

238
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,028
The boys will be
here in the morning.

239
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:45,365
Maybe I should do some
scouting or fix that wheel.

240
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,343
Never be another
woman like you.

241
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,277
I know.

242
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,328
Ugh, I'm bored.

243
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,864
Well, Romeo, in
my opinion, that's

244
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,432
a good thing for you to be.

245
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,269
You got no call to
to start in on me.

246
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,604
You see that it stays that way.

247
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,340
See, I ain't covering
for you no more.

248
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,242
Next time for you,
it's wedding bells.

249
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:38,084
Rangers haven't
caught Billy Poke yet?

250
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,486
Nope.

251
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:44,123
Reward's gone up to
$1,000, dead or alive.

252
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,593
Damn, what did he do this time?

253
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,095
He robbed a stage in Abilene.

254
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:54,100
Killed everyone, even the women.

255
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,503
Abilene.

256
00:18:56,503 --> 00:19:00,072
We aren't too far from Abilene.

257
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,074
Hey, isn't Jack
Calahan's new bride

258
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,711
coming in on the next stage?

259
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,579
You reckon I ride out
there in the morning

260
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,614
and give them an escort?

261
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,787
Sweetwater stage has no
payroll, and I don't want you

262
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,022
anywhere near Jake's new bride.

263
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,594
I hear she's a real
lady this time.

264
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,246
The Sweetwater stage is
right over there, Sister.

265
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,870
Where are you headed?

266
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,671
San Francisco.

267
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,072
Sarah.

268
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:09,075
Don't lie to the good sister.

269
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,778
Amanda, I suggest
you mind your place.

270
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:25,925
CHESTER: Ho!

271
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,967
The team needs a rest.

272
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,069
I'll step on down, help you out.

273
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,487
All right, step on down.

274
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,890
We'll be spending
the night here.

275
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,559
Don't wander off too far.

276
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,094
Watch out for rattles.

277
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,764
There's more than one
kind of snake around here.

278
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,701
I got it.

279
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,038
Right this way, Sister.

280
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:46,373
I feel like I know you
already, Mr. Beaudine.

281
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:47,173
Henry.

282
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:50,142
Call me Henry.

283
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,844
Henry.

284
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:56,783
You see, what I really want
is to go to San Francisco.

285
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:19,872
Well now, Henry seems to
be a decent enough feller,

286
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,708
trying to make a break.

287
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,910
But there's something hidden
behind those pinstripes,

288
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,245
and that's a greedy old snake.

289
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:29,916
Velvet, she's got a lot to lose
with her money bag in sight.

290
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:33,620
And Henry tells Sarah, snatch
that bag this very night.

291
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:18,517
Henry.

292
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,701
Henry.

293
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,635
Where are you?

294
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,303
I've got the bag.

295
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:25,772
Henry?

296
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:26,573
Oh.

297
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:18,024
I knew that whore was
hiding something, huh?

298
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,425
She's a nun.

299
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:22,829
Oh yeah, that's like saying I'm
really gonna take you with me.

300
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:23,763
Where's the horse?

301
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:24,897
You said--

302
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:25,698
Oh.

303
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:26,966
You are not going.

304
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:32,104
Neither are you, cowboy.

305
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:33,940
Let her go.

306
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,908
Get off her.

307
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,443
Now turn around.

308
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:38,210
Back up.

309
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,683
That's my money.

310
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:46,986
Give it here.

311
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:47,946
Come on.

312
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,558
It's my money.

313
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,060
Oh, whoa, hey.

314
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,262
Oh, I can't believe
you're so stupid.

315
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:57,063
Stupid.

316
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:08,608
He's dead.

317
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,408
Oh my god.

318
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:10,877
I-- I killed him.

319
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:18,685
Are you just gonna stand
there or are you gonna help me?

320
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,287
Sister, I can't.

321
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:22,221
Fine.

322
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,455
Then you'll go to
jail for trying

323
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,858
to steal the church's money.

324
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:26,659
Get over here.

325
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:36,936
Come on, push.

326
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:39,005
SARAH: I am pushing.

327
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:39,806
Push harder.

328
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:44,877
Come on, missy.

329
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:48,180
Get your hands dirty.

330
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,049
Why'd you take my money?

331
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,385
Well, I needed it to
go to San Francisco.

332
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,554
What'd you need him for?

333
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,691
I couldn't go alone.

334
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,661
You didn't get very far
with the bag, did you?

335
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:02,862
Couldn't go without it.

336
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:05,598
And besides, I thought it
was the church's money.

337
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:06,565
I am the church.

338
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,839
Where's my mama's watch?

339
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,640
I don't know.

340
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,258
Ow!

341
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,713
Did you let him take my watch?

342
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:21,981
No.

343
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:24,817
Nuns aren't supposed
to hit people.

344
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:25,752
This one does.

345
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:53,779
Joe.

346
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:55,982
Joe.

347
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:56,732
Hm?

348
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,151
Changed my mind.

349
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:02,554
You're riding out with me this
afternoon to meet the stage.

350
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:03,754
All right.

351
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:07,626
I'll be back in about an hour.

352
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,196
Get up and get something to eat.

353
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,197
JOE: Yeah, yeah.

354
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,406
Did you hear what happened?

355
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:23,375
Did you know the Lord
doesn't appreciate those

356
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,377
who partake in idle gossip?

357
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:29,816
This is hardly
idle gossip, Sister.

358
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:33,619
Mr. Beaudine ran off last night
and took one of our horses

359
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,688
with him.

360
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:38,257
I knew that man had no
character from the moment

361
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,192
I laid eyes on him.

362
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:42,962
You should pay more attention
to my guidance, Sarah.

363
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:58,644
Damn.

364
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,787
Mrs. Wheeler.

365
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:11,390
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

366
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,325
Nuh-uh-uh.

367
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:16,495
Mr. Wheeler will
be here any minute.

368
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,031
I am Mr. Wheeler.

369
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,267
Come on, little Susie.

370
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,568
Daddy wants some sugar.

371
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:28,808
Well, my, Mr. Wheeler, you
sure do look young today.

372
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:29,608
Woo!

373
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,053
You are so strong.

374
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:41,921
So sweet.

375
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,028
I don't believe you're
Mr. Wheeler at all.

376
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:49,829
You don't?

377
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:50,997
No.

378
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:53,699
You are an imposter, and
I'm gonna punish you.

379
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,301
Oh, I'm a bad boy.

380
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:58,304
Yeah, you're a bad boy.

381
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:01,673
I just love our
afternoons together.

382
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,442
[bell]

383
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:04,777
Oh my god.

384
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:05,912
Oh my god.
I gotta go.

385
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:06,478
What?
What?

386
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,279
Mrs. Wheeler.

387
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,080
Oh my god.

388
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,215
Sam's gonna kill me.

389
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:13,452
Damn his brother.

390
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:05,304
Sam, sorry I'm-- Sam?

391
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,105
Damn.

392
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:17,850
Hey, Chester.

393
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:21,420
Sam.

394
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:30,930
Morning, Chester.

395
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,265
Morning, Sheriff.

396
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:34,166
That's a nice looking egg.

397
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:34,967
Yep.

398
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,811
Morning, ladies.

399
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:49,315
Which one of you
is Sarah Foster?

400
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:50,565
I am.

401
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,419
Nice to meet you, miss.

402
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:57,924
I'm here to escort you to town.

403
00:30:57,924 --> 00:31:00,426
Did Mr. Calahan send you?

404
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:01,227
Yes, ma'am.

405
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:06,032
Here we go.

406
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:14,006
Easy picking, guys.

407
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:16,175
Just a bunch of women.

408
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:17,376
Hey.

409
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,177
Give me that.

410
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,526
It's our lucky day.

411
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:37,396
Let's go get them.

412
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,665
We ain't taking no women.

413
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:40,745
JD, Liam.

414
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,503
I think we need some new whores.

415
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:48,674
Hey, Billy.

416
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:50,676
Don't let this carrona
kill everybody this time.

417
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,191
There's a rider up ahead.

418
00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:05,992
Ho!

419
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:11,897
OK, OK, OK.

420
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:17,703
Help me.

421
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:18,504
She's been hurt.

422
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:36,655
Stay where you are, and I
promise you won't get hurt.

423
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,625
[gunshots]

424
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,261
Oh my god, they
shot the driver.

425
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:43,062
Oh my god.

426
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:43,862
Be quiet.

427
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:44,696
Damn it, Mick.

428
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,966
I told you not to do that again.

429
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,801
I promised him.

430
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,137
You promised him?

431
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,475
Somebody's gotta have
some balls around here.

432
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,616
Just do whatever they sayand keep your mouth shut.

433
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,785
I told you this route
wouldn't pay off.

434
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,420
It's not even a stage.

435
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,555
It's a damn wagon.

436
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,027
You need me to do
what you can't.

437
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:22,768
Come on out of there.

438
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:25,337
Put your hands where
I can see them.

439
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:28,874
JD, get out there and check and
see if there's a strong box.

440
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,476
Come on.

441
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:31,677
Come on.

442
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:32,478
Liam.

443
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:56,935
Yeah, beau.

444
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,137
Looks like we got
a little something

445
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,005
extra for our trouble.

446
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:02,374
You keep your hands off
her, you filthy beast.

447
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,009
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

448
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:06,011
Behave yourself, you
won't get hurt, all right?

449
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:13,485
[gunshot]

450
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,988
[screaming]

451
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,106
Liam.

452
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:42,314
Damn.

453
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:45,784
There must be $20,000 in here.

454
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,186
Hello, Sister.

455
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:47,986
What'd you do?

456
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:48,787
Rob a bank?

457
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:52,958
Shut up.

458
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,397
I wasn't gonna kill her, Billy.

459
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:00,732
We were just fooling around.

460
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:04,170
You know how much
you mean to me.

461
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:04,970
I told you.

462
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,976
Never be another woman like you.

463
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,777
I know.

464
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:21,353
MINSTREL (SINGING):
Mick is getting more

465
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,923
than she ever bargained for.

466
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:30,229
Billy Poke has his eye
on sweet and sassy Sarah.

467
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:35,767
All the rowdy girls-- one, two,
three-- now they're together.

468
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:40,639
Sarah rides a horse
up front, but the nun

469
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,976
is being dragged on a tether.

470
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,754
Make them stop.

471
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,389
Whoa.

472
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:58,190
Don't worry.

473
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,326
They ain't gonna hurt her.

474
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:03,262
Virgin like her is worth
too much, even if she

475
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:05,464
is a little long in the tooth.

476
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:08,534
She ain't gonna be worth
much if they keep doing that.

477
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:09,568
Please, let her ride.

478
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,241
Liam.

479
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:16,608
Cut that out and put
her up on a horse.

480
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,917
Where are we headed to?

481
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:26,718
You like tequila?

482
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:02,588
Sam.

483
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:40,426
Put this on, you little tramp.

484
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,160
Tell me you want only me.

485
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:22,634
Tell me.

486
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,435
You want only me.

487
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:26,705
Smart ass.

488
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:31,209
Should've killed him.

489
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:44,082
He says he's gonna
keep me for himself.

490
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:44,832
Ha.

491
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:49,755
What is your rich rancher
gonna say about that?

492
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:52,858
He also says a virgin like
you is worth a lot of money

493
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:54,826
in the whorehouses
down here, even

494
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,462
if you are long in the tooth.

495
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:01,567
Oh, he did, did he?

496
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,669
Did he say what happens to
smart ass virgins like you

497
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:06,705
when he's finished with them?

498
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:09,608
I know why you became a nun.

499
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:12,010
I could tell him.

500
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,645
Well, go ahead then.

501
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,547
Tell him what you
think you know.

502
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:20,418
Look.

503
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,252
I need your help.

504
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:24,790
Sorry.

505
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,192
Can't do it.

506
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:29,928
I helped you.

507
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,998
Well, the Lord helps those
who help themselves, darling.

508
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:38,737
I don't care if
you help me or not.

509
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:40,305
I'm going to get
to San Francisco.

510
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:48,580
[whistle]

511
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:50,248
Mount up.

512
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,220
Wanna make camp before tonight.

513
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:20,178
Almost home, Mick.

514
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:22,180
Give me that
beautiful moon, Billy.

515
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:14,633
You better quit staring at him.

516
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:15,567
I hate him.

517
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:22,107
Look, it doesn't
have to be him.

518
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:24,075
You better choose.

519
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:27,679
Or he's gonna choose you.

520
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,048
How can you say that?

521
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,684
What do you think they're gonna
do after they finish drinking?

522
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:33,484
Go to sleep?

523
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,295
What about you?

524
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,665
You don't know
anything about men.

525
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:35,380
No!

526
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,682
Let me go.

527
00:43:36,682 --> 00:43:38,149
Let me go.

528
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:39,284
Help me.

529
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,085
No.

530
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:41,086
No!

531
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,520
Leave me alone!

532
00:43:49,895 --> 00:43:50,862
Take that, stupid whore.

533
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,775
He's not man enough for me.

534
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:08,213
None of you are.

535
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:13,719
Hold her on the ground.

536
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:21,827
SARAH: Get your hands off of me.

537
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:24,763
Leave me alone.

538
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:25,843
Get away.

539
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:28,516
No!

540
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:30,468
No!

541
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:31,302
No!

542
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,739
Why does she have to be a nun?

543
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:35,941
SARAH: No!

544
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:36,742
No!

545
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:40,712
Hold her legs.

546
00:44:40,712 --> 00:44:41,713
Look at me.

547
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,552
I can handle you.

548
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:48,353
Do it, Billy.

549
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,221
Don't listen to her.

550
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:53,658
I can see you.

551
00:44:53,658 --> 00:44:55,026
Do it, Billy.

552
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,995
You're not like her.

553
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:08,306
I'll deal with her, man.

554
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,817
You can have her.

555
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:19,885
No!

556
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:21,352
You're not like them.

557
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:22,353
Get her, JD.

558
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,689
You're not like them.

559
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:25,439
No!

560
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:28,159
You're not like them.

561
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,828
You're not like them!

562
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:39,670
Damn.

563
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:47,645
Well, help me up.

564
00:45:47,645 --> 00:45:48,479
Come on, let's go.

565
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:49,280
Wait.

566
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,115
Wait.

567
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:51,316
We can't just leave her there.

568
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:53,184
Look, I'll come back for here.

569
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:54,519
You know what, young man?

570
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:56,021
I'm sure someday, you're gonna
make a very good sheriff,

571
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:59,357
but today, I'm not leaving
here without my-- my sister.

572
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:01,326
Look, we can talk about
my youth and vitality

573
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:02,427
at a later date.

574
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:06,731
But right now-- I don't
have time for this.

575
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:13,571
You're so pretty.

576
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:20,011
You won't let them
touch me again?

577
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:20,812
No.

578
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:32,824
I like you, Billy.

579
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:36,661
I like you too.

580
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,768
I wanna go to San Francisco.

581
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,299
[moaning]

582
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:06,744
[giggling]

583
00:49:08,846 --> 00:49:10,248
SARAH: That was nice.

584
00:49:16,321 --> 00:49:17,722
Get back here.

585
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:23,228
It isn't always
like this, is it?

586
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,705
Billy, you're so strong.

587
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:54,159
What's that?

588
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:55,660
Billy, what's--
what's happening?

589
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:21,486
You know what?

590
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:25,556
That was a dirty
trick you pulled.

591
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:28,526
You sure are
different for a nun.

592
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,395
I mean, not that I've had
any dealings with a sister

593
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:33,098
of the cloth, mind you.

594
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:34,865
Well, I haven't had any
dealings with a sheriff

595
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,601
who doesn't shave yet.

596
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:39,770
Hey, smooth as a baby's bottom.

597
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,340
Oh, and might I add that it's
this fresh young face right

598
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,876
here that saved a woman
of your advanced years

599
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,813
last night, Sister?

600
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:52,250
What are you doing
out here alone anyway?

601
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:57,088
'Cause the sheriff that
was killed was my brother.

602
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:01,025
Oh.

603
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:09,066
Well, what if Billy
and his men follow us?

604
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,235
It's just you and me, Sister.

605
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:16,641
I guess it could be worse.

606
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:17,842
So where's the nearest town?

607
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:21,146
I need to get some fresh
clothes and a fresh horse.

608
00:51:21,146 --> 00:51:24,915
Then I'm gonna get
my-- my sister,

609
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,684
and get out of this
god forsaken land.

610
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:30,555
Which one of them
killed my brother?

611
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:37,228
The one with the keys.

612
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,795
Well?

613
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:13,464
You gonna leave or what?

614
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,033
No, ma'am.

615
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:19,837
Sister or not, you're
one fine looking woman.

616
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:21,539
You wouldn't be
safe in here alone.

617
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:32,016
Don't worry, Sister.

618
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:33,884
I'm a gentleman
through and through.

619
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:34,985
You could rest
your mind at ease.

620
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:35,786
I won't look.

621
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:15,460
This is the only inhabited town
between here and Sweetwater.

622
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:21,866
We sit tight, Billy's bound
to show up with your sister.

623
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:24,369
VELVET: Yeah, then what?

624
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:25,436
I come up with a plan.

625
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:53,331
I can see you, Mr. Pepper.

626

[speaking spanish]

627
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:28,399
She's all yours.

628
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:39,043
Sister, wake up.

629
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:39,883
Sister.

630
00:54:41,746 --> 00:54:42,747
We didn't have to wait too long.

631
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,485
Billy and his men just rode in.

632
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,219
Get that funny little
man from the bath

635
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:54,892
My lady here wants a bath.

636
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:57,595
Anything she wants,
I aim to give.

637
00:55:01,566 --> 00:55:04,602
Your sister's with him.

638
00:55:04,602 --> 00:55:07,505
It's kind of strange though.

639
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:09,440
She was riding
right next to Billy,

640
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,011
and Billy's woman was
riding behind him, tied up.

641
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:15,380
I'll be damned.

642
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:21,386
I want some whiskey.

643
00:55:21,386 --> 00:55:24,822
It's too quiet in here.

644
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:25,623
You.

645
00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:29,827
Que pasa?

I love this place.

I'm gonna go check it out.

You stay here.

How did you get here?

01:18:38,614 --> 01:18:40,216
You're not so
tough now, are you?

834
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,922
You're just a kid.

835
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:47,423
That's right.

836
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:50,626
The kid that knocked
you on your ass.

837
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:53,562
I don't have any
liquor in me now.

838
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:54,764
Let's see how tough
you really are.

839
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:02,205
Where's the money?

840
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:03,239
I'll tell you what, tough guy.

841
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:07,176
If you're a faster
draw than me, then I'll

842
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:11,247
tell you where the money is.

843
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:12,916
Do you want to play
with the kid or what?

844
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:19,622
Don't think I'm
stupid, 'cause I'm not.

845
01:19:19,622 --> 01:19:21,858
Now you tell me
where the money is.

846
01:19:21,858 --> 01:19:22,658
Now.

847
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:29,899
It's right behind you.

848
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:31,367
Trying to trick me.

849
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,472
You know, I think I'll
just shoot you now.

Hold it right there.

01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:56,659
Hello, Sister.

856
01:19:56,659 --> 01:19:58,995
Where's my money?

857
01:19:58,995 --> 01:20:00,596
Come on, Sarah.

858
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:02,431
You don't want to do this.

859
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:05,334
You know I do.

860
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:07,470
You're gonna get hurt then.

861
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:10,439
I'm going to win.

862
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:12,008
You can't.

863
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:13,376
Why?

864
01:20:13,376 --> 01:20:15,979
Because you always do?

865
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:17,346
Well, not this time.

866
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:22,986
Put your gun down, ma'am.

You ain't winning
today, Sister.

868
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:31,194
Hand over the money.

Now how about that money?

Who is he?

I know you.

876
01:21:01,157 --> 01:21:03,092
You're that deputy
from Sweetwater.

877
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:05,962
The one everybody talks about.

878
01:21:05,962 --> 01:21:07,997
I remember that story.

879
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:09,232
You almost got
your brother killed

880
01:21:09,232 --> 01:21:11,634
'cause your pants were down.

881
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:13,369
Hell, you ain't
nothing but a boy.

01:21:18,274 --> 01:21:21,210
Your brother was beautiful
when I killed him.

You can't do it.

That's why you needed me, Billy.

Well, Sarah.

890
01:22:30,846 --> 01:22:33,016
Looks like it's time for you
to start fending for yourself.

891
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,088
You got a choice to make.

(SINGING) And now the sun
is setting on the story

895
01:23:00,509 --> 01:23:04,913
of the rowdy girls, with
lives as tough or tougher

896
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:08,184
than in the man's world.

897
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:13,789
And in this land of freedom,
still great dangers lurk.

898
01:23:13,789 --> 01:23:16,625
But if you stand tall and
you're quick on the draw,

899
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,761
a woman can still make it work.

900
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:24,500
And you'll ride out west for
freedom like the rowdy girls.

01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,702
Well, Viola, where to now?

902
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:28,804
Would you quit calling me that?

903
01:23:28,804 --> 01:23:31,540
San Francisco it is.

904
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:34,443
And who says you're going?

905
01:23:34,443 --> 01:23:36,912
I heard San Francisco
is so full of sinners

906
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:41,250
that a man of my extreme
youthful exuberance

907
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:45,154
and a woman of your
advanced age and expertise

908
01:23:45,154 --> 01:23:46,689
can live together in sin.

909
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:53,028
And it will be viewed as
a wholesome occurrence.

910
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:53,829
Hey, Sister.

911
