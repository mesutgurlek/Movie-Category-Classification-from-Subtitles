Of course, I knew you were here.
Certain people in Virginia City told me that.

00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,330
That's simple enough. Here, sit down.

Vance,
the war's going badly for us, isn't it?

102
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:40,383
Very badly, Julia.

103
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,423
The South hasn't anything left
to fight with except the will.

104
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:45,685
Wars are won with gold nowadays,
not with men.

105
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:47,260
And the North has the gold.

106
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:49,724
That's why Sherman's in Atlanta.

107
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,766
But if the South had the gold
to buy supplies, arms, powder...

108
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:55,199
Who's going to stake us?
Jeff Davis is bankrupt.

109
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:57,635
There's hardly a dime
in the Confederate treasury.

110
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:01,937
Even England has stopped her credits.
We're lucky if we last another six months.

111
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,908
I'm not thinking about credits, Vance.

112
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,777
I'm thinking about a gift to the South
of $5 million in gold bullion.

113
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,680
- Julia, you're crazy. Where in the world...?
- Virginia City.

114
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:12,753
Impossible.
That's a Yank stronghold and...

115
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,447
You're familiar with Virginia City.
Have you forgotten?

116
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:19,685
It's one of the richest mining centers in the
world. And the biggest mine owners there...

117
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:21,124
Of course.

118
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:24,528
Dr. Cameron, Armistead, Marshall,
all Southerners.

119
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,103
Whose loyalty adds up to the $5 million
which they're giving to the Confederacy.

120
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,172
But they can't move it out
for fear of stirring up a suspicion.

121
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,605
They need a leader,
someone strong, resourceful...

122
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,711
...who knows all the country between.

123
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,347
- That's why I've come straight to you.
- To me?

124
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:42,780
Yes, you're the only one who could do it.

125
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:45,786
Is that the only reason
you came straight to me?

126

128
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,227
I still don't know.

129
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:55,990
But you're my oldest
and my dearest friend.

130
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:57,325
I knew I could trust you.

131
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:01,092
Tell me, why did you leave
your home here and go north?

132
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,794
Was it because of me?

133
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,668
Well, partly that then,
because I wasn't sure.

134
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:07,369
I wanted to sing.

135
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:09,672
Father was so furious.

136
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:11,642
A Hayne on the public stage.

137
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,146
You gave a recital in Boston, I heard.

138
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,216
Only one.

139
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:17,677
Then the war.

140
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:21,584
Oh, it was a long jump, Vance,
from Boston to Virginia City...

141
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:24,487
...singing in the Sazerac Saloon.

142
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,525
But why?

143
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:29,129
Virginia City is a loyal Yankee nest.

144
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:32,529
Drunken Union soldiers talk and I listen.

145
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:34,862
I'm a very good listener, Vance.

146
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:38,296
And what I hear, I pass on.

147
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:40,666
And that's why you were chosen
to come here.

148
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,037
Yes. To get your help.

149
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:45,305
Oh, so much depends in you, Vance.

150
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:47,608
You must go and see the president.

151
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:02,796
MAN:
Mr. President, we must face the facts.

152
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:06,628
The Army's half starved,
therefore is only at half its strength.

153
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,861
Each week,
thousands of our boys are dying...

154
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,735
...for lack of proper equipment
and medical supplies.

155
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:16,207
What the captain suggests
is dangerous and difficult...

156
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:20,838
...but the $5 million these people
are willing to sacrifice may save the South.

157
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:23,917
How do you propose to bring the gold
to Richmond, Captain Irby?

158
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:26,987
Between Nevada and the Mississippi
there are 17 Union forts...

159
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:29,420
...guarding the roads
and every inch of the river.

160
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:32,857
Quite true, but I have planned
a route by which I hope to dodge them...

161
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:36,361
...but it's a great deal harder
and longer than the old immigrant trail.

162
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:38,659
If you'll permit me
to demonstrate on your map.

163
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,426
Go right ahead, sir.

164
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:47,074
I'd head due south through lower Nevada
and the territory of New Mexico to Texas.

165
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,507
A convoy could meet us
at our Amarillo outpost...

166
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:52,374
...rush the gold to Galveston,
then by a blockade runner...

167
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:54,675
...all the way around to Wilmington,
then here.

168
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,819
- How long would it take to reach Amarillo?
- About four weeks.

169
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:59,648
It makes sense to me, Mr. President.

170
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:02,188
How well do you know
that southwest country, captain?

171
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:05,020
I've hunted, scouted
and driven cattle through most of it.

172
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:07,992
I know every water hole and arroyo,
almost every cactus bush.

173
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:11,155
It's pretty dry and barren,
but I'm sure I can make it.

174
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,426
Well, General Page.

175
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,127
If Captain Irby says he can, he will, sir.

176
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:19,399
Jeb Stuart told me
he was the smartest scout he ever had.

177
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:23,909
And he added that Irby could lead
a cavalry raid to Hades and back.

178
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,879
From what I hear, that's a pretty accurate
description of Virginia City, general.

179
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:31,982
By the way, Irby, where is the messenger
who brought us the good news?

180
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:33,883
One moment, sir.

181
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:42,125
Julia,
the president would like to see you.

182
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:52,701
Mr. President,
may I present Miss Julia Hayne...

183
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,900
...the daughter of Colonel Hayne.

184
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,045
Mr. President.

185
00:14:57,212 --> 00:14:59,112
I knew your father, Miss Hayne.

186
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:00,942
He was a gallant soldier...

187
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:04,483
...which explains the courage you found
for such a dangerous mission.

188
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,915
Thank you, Mr. President.

189
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:09,455
We're proud of you and deeply grateful.

190
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,857
Good luck to you, captain.

191
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:14,222
The hopes of 10 million
will be riding with you.

192
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,229
Doggone that confounded...

193
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:28,899
...dadgummed, slab-sided, dad-burned,
tarnation, doggone...

194
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:30,102
MOOSE:
Quiet.

195
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,746
MARBLEHEAD:
...buffalo.

196
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:35,141
Right. The lamp.

197
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:40,514
Irby left the joker in the pack
when he didn't shut off this tunnel.

198
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,157
Sure enough left the road open
to the powder magazine.

199
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:45,088
- There it is.
- Yeah. Here.

200
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,454
Hey, not yet.

201
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:48,654
Wait until the sentry changes at 10:00.

202
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:50,298
MARBLEHEAD:
Doggone that confounded...

203
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:51,865
- Shut up.
...dadgummed...

204
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:08,978
- What are they digging?
- Earthworks, the last line of defense.

205
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:11,984
Is it as bad as that? Are they so close?

206
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:15,419
Seventy miles,
at Spotsylvania Court House.

207
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:19,220
But they'll never take Richmond now, Julia.
You've brought us new hope.

208
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:20,792
Who's billeted here?

209
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:23,488
The 17th Cavalry.

210
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,032
They're using it as headquarters.

211
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:29,170
They'll probably move on any day now.

212
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:32,304
Looks strange, doesn't it?

213
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:36,339
Oh, Vance,
do you remember the old days here?

214
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:39,242
The parties father used to have
in this house?

215
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,315
It was fun growing up together,
wasn't it?

216
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:44,111
IRBY: I wish it could have lasted forever.
We were close then.

217
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:47,949
Do you remember the last Christmas
I spent here before the war?

218
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,691
Frost was glistening in all the fields...

219
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:55,728
...holly wreaths were in all those windows,
mistletoe in the hall.

220
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:59,356
And Father standing in the doorway
with the light behind him...

221
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:05,398
...so straight and proud and handsome.

222
00:17:06,742 --> 00:17:08,403
And now...

223
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:12,245
...wet leaves cover the ground at Shiloh,
don't they, Vance?

224
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:15,144
Julia, why do you torture yourself
with memories?

225
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:16,545
What have I got left?

226
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,914
The war's taken everything.

227
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:21,352
Not me, Julie.

228
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,720
Perhaps someday we...

229
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:31,388
But now, I just feel dead inside
and I will be till the war is over.

230
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:39,006
When do you start west?

231
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:42,166
Tomorrow, by troop train to the border,
then by stage.

232
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:44,608
We'll see each other later then
at Virginia City.

233
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,908
Yes. But remember, when we meet,
we've never seen each other before.

234
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,246
- Then the Federals can't suspect.
- Oh, I'm an expert at that now.

235
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,878
Treating friends like strangers
and enemies like friends.

236
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:56,922
I won't forget.

237
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,221
What time is it?

238
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:01,021
Around 10:00.

239
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,391
Let's go back to Richmond.

240
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:08,065
[EXPLOSION]

241
00:18:10,472 --> 00:18:11,905
IRBY:
The prison.

242
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:17,277
Back to town
as quick as you can make it.

243
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,083
Dog-darn this dad-blame swamp.

244
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:30,089
Marble, I never thought
you'd turn out to be a water buffalo.

245
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:33,695
If I don't get out of this water,
it's gonna take the curl out of my hair.

246
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,127
If you don't shut up, you're gonna have
a bullet parting your hair.

247
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:44,233
MAN:
Here are some tracks, men.

248
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:48,103
They're running every which way,
but they're probably headed upstream.

249
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:49,744
Come on.

250
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,816
All fish head upstream, my friend,
that's how they get caught.

251
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:04,515
Come on.

252
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:16,700
Gentlemen, this is Captain Bradford...

253
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:19,534
...one of our most reliable sources
of enemy intelligence.

254
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,039
I question that, sir.

255
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,941
A man of any intelligence would hardly
spend a vacation in Libby Prison.

256
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:27,172
I understand, at the time of your capture...

257
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:30,079
...you were tracing the report
of gold shipments to Richmond.

258
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,117
That's correct. The shipments were made.

259
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:36,223
Ridiculous. How could the silver and gold
that might dribble through to the rebels...

260
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:39,121
...affect the outcome of this war
one way or another?

261
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:41,956
They couldn't, sir,
so long as those shipments were small.

262
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,566
I have reason to believe the rebels'
next shipments will involve millions.

263
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:49,261
- That could prolong this conflict for years.
- Where could they get millions?

264
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,738
Only one place, sir. Virginia City in Nevada.
Three of the richest mines in America...

265
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:58,073
...belong to Southern sympathizers there.
- Virginia City. That's a rebel hotbed.

266
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:00,647
- You'll have to watch yourself.
- Thank you. We will.

267
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:03,080
By the way,
I'm taking these men with me, sir.

268
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:04,719
We always work together.

269
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:07,117
Well, what are their qualifications?

270
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,620
Well, sir, Marblehead there...

271
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,950
Yes, sir.

272
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,151
...he's probably one of the finest
horse-thieves east of Chicago.

273
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,455
- You mean Kansas City, sir.
- Oh, Kansas City.

274
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,156
- And Moose.
- Yes, sir.

275
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:22,167
Well, he's had four wives, so he's had
to learn how to keep undercover.

276
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:23,929
Shucks.

277
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:27,068
Well, that settles it.

278
00:20:27,242 --> 00:20:29,233
Draw what money you need
from the paymaster.

279
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:32,778
And before you leave, look over
the Washington reports on Virginia City.

280
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:34,347
BRADFORD: Thank you.
- Good luck to you.

281
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:35,608
Thank you, sir.

282
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,547
- Sir.
- Sir.

283
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:39,921
Hey, why did you say
I only had four wives?

284
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:41,555
- Well, what was it, five?
MOOSE: Sure.

285
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:43,918
BRADFORD:
Oh, I keep losing count.

286
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:17,286
This is most uncomfortable.
I've never had such a rough ride.

287
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:20,622
My congressman
will certainly hear about this road.

288
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:23,060
In fact,
I think I'll write to President Lincoln.

289
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:24,926
He's kind of busy right now.

290
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,536
- There's a war on, you know.
- Oh, the war, the war.

291
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,765
When I think of all those brave boys
on the battlefield, so many of them.

292
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:35,933
- It's bad for business, you know.
- What is your business, mister?

293
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:37,203
Life insurance.

294
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,904
- Perhaps I could interest you in a policy.
- No, thanks.

295
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:43,142
Great American Insurance Company,
Cleveland, Ohio. Fine protection.

296
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:46,776
- I would not be a good risk.
- Nonsense, you look as fit as a fiddle.

297
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:49,515
I suppose you avoid
all unnecessary forms of excitement?

298
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:52,216
Oh, sure, sure.
I just sit home, reading books.

299
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,157
Oh, you Westerners are lucky.

300
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:57,662
No taxes to speak of,
nothing to worry about.

301
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,929
Of course, you are deprived of the glorious
opportunity to defend your country.

302
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:03,435
You are lucky to be out here.

303
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:06,233
They tell me they are
drafting men your age in the North.

304
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,205
Yes. Yes, they are.

305
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:11,107
That's the part of the war
I don't approve of.

306
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,648
What business
are you three gentlemen in?

307
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:16,280
- Well...
- We're in the mining business.

308
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:20,820
Gold mining. We thought we'd mosey
around Virginia City for a spell.

309
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:24,618
Doesn't your friend know there's more
silver than gold in Virginia City?

310
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:26,283
- Yes, but...
- We're in both.

311
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:27,758
That's it.

312
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,057
So you're from Virginia City,
are you, Miss Hayne? You haven't said.

313
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,598
Haven't I?

314
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:38,599
Now that we've all mentioned
our business, how about you?

315
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,710
Since you joined us a few miles back, I
suppose you live in this part of the country.

316
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:44,709
- Cattle business?
- No, no.

317
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,144
Maybe you could say I handle hardware.

318
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:49,442
- Full line?
- Oh, full enough.

319
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:53,054
- Hardware.
- Here is one of my samples.

320
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:57,156
You take this, Mr. Marblehead.

321
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,623
I'm a trifle gun shy.

322
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,795
Any of you gentlemen
happen to be carrying a gun?

323
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,297
No, no, no, not me. I never touch them.

324
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,129
All I want's a pocket full of rocks.

325
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,430
Guns are for warlike people.
What made you ask?

326
00:23:10,605 --> 00:23:13,665
MAN: This country isn't as soft
around here as this gentleman thinks.

327
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:16,743
- Did you ever hear of John Murrell?
- No. Who is he?

328
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:19,642
You mean, Murrell's guerrillas?
Sure we've heard of them.

329
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,942
They're a pack of murderous skunks.

330
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:23,414
MAN:
Hey, you are right.

331
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:25,883
- Beautiful work, don't you think?
- Yes.

332
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:28,147
These things make me nervous.

333
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:29,981
Thank you.

334
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,785
This is his stamping ground.

335
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,986
Murrell specializes in stagecoaches.

336
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,358
He wouldn't dare
hold up the United States mail.

337
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:40,831
I'd protest to the Post Office Department
immediately.

338
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,731
Murrell wouldn't be after the mail.

339
00:23:42,904 --> 00:23:48,809
Not with five business men like us,
carrying between us maybe 15- Or $20,000.

340
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:52,845
Yes, that's right.
We would be a pretty good haul at that.

341
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,279
That's what I figured. Now there isn't
any point in making any trouble.

342
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:59,648
If you'll hand over quickly what you have,
nobody will get hurt.

343
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:02,454
Well, doggone if you'd take
a man's father's watch.

344
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:03,955
MARBLEHEAD:
Dadgum.

345
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:05,821
Quickly.

346
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:08,218
Now you.

347
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:09,727
I take it you're Mr. Murrell?

348
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,461
You are a smart fellow.
Come on, hand over, if you please.

349
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,067
But that's the point. I don't please.

350
00:24:16,238 --> 00:24:18,706
Don't be funny, mister.
This gun has a hair trigger.

351
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,366
- Don't be a fool, Kerry, he might shoot.
- Go on, give him the doggone money.

352
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,774
It won't go off. Would you like to bet?

353
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:26,413
Oh, please, Mr. Bradford...

354
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:30,142
Why, Miss Hayne.
Such solicitude is very touching.

355
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:31,751
You were saying, sir?

356
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,686
I do not particularly want to shoot you,
mister, but I do not mind.

357
00:24:35,857 --> 00:24:38,417
If you'll look back out of the window,
you will see why.

358
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:45,929
- Guerrillas.
- Yes, Murrell's guerrillas.

359
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:48,126
I think I outdraw you, eh, mister?

360
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:52,637
Maybe. I've only got one pair,
but that ought to be enough.

361
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:58,610
Don't reach for that. Get them up.

362
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:03,342
I thought that little derringer of yours looked
a little bit too well used to be a sample.

363
00:25:03,518 --> 00:25:06,919
In any case, I didn't like your face.
As a matter of fact, I still don't.

364
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,147
See if he's got another gun, Moose.

365
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:12,253
MARBLEHEAD: Give me that stuff.
MOOSE: Give me that money.

366
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,361
MARBLEHEAD: You leather-headed...
MOOSE: Your purse, madam.

367
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:16,656
I'll say he's in the hardware business.

368
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:24,997
Driver.

369
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,230
Now, Mr. Murrell...

370
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:31,869
...you're gonna tell your little boys playtime
is over and you're coming along with us.

371
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:33,779
Driver, pull up.

372
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:48,293
Now then,
start talking and make it quick and fast.

373
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,896
Come on.

374
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:54,093
Put up your guns, boys.

375
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:57,329
This fellow, he's got the drop on me.
If you shoot, he'll plug me.

376
00:25:57,505 --> 00:25:59,700
You go back and don't follow.
He means business.

377
00:25:59,874 --> 00:26:03,674
Mr. Driver, please drive
before they change their minds.

378
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:14,619
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

379
00:26:28,803 --> 00:26:31,795
Now, Mr. Murrell,
would you be kind enough to step out?

380
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:35,599
No, you'd best ride on top,
we don't like your company.

381
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:38,439
- What makes you think I would?
- Hope three ain't crowding.

382
00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:41,946
- Keep that on him till the next station.
- I don't need this peashooter.

383
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:45,484
Keep my hands on him, you mean.
All right, son.

384
00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:51,687
TED:
Bess, Dolly.

385
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,727
Just to think, I tried to sell
that ruffian life insurance.

386
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:57,228
Oh, he wasn't as tough as my last wife.

387
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:01,995
- Pardon, I didn't know you were married.
- Married? Only four times.

388
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,467
Five.

389
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:05,538
All insured, I hope.

390
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:10,608
Never mind. Don't pay any attention to me.
I don't know what I'm saying. I'm all upset.

391
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:13,247
That's the tightest squeeze
I was ever in in my life.

392
00:27:13,415 --> 00:27:14,473
How about you, ma'am?

393
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:17,140
Don't you think
the heroics were a trifle exaggerated?

394
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:20,914
Ma'am, you don't know him. You should
have saw the last mess he got us out of.

395
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:23,319
Why, the night we started the dig...

396
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,528
You have a peculiar way
of looking at things, Miss Hayne.

397
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:30,893
- What?
BRADFORD: Pardon me.

398
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,296
Try it that way.
The other can be done, but it is difficult.

399
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,303
I was silly, wasn't I?

400
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,597
But I was rude. Sorry.

401
00:27:40,175 --> 00:27:42,439
I deserved it. I haven't said thank you.

402
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,511
- Lf you hadn't been here, Mr. Bradford...
- But I had to be here.

403
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,545
Don't you believe in predestination?

404
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:49,547
You had to be here too, so did Murrell.

405
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,514
There's probably future reason for it.

406
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,815
MARBLEHEAD:
Hey, Kerry.

407
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:57,685
The driver says there's a $5000 reward
for this shadbelly.

408
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:00,794
TED: That's a lot of money
for buzzard-bait like him.

409
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:02,987
MURRELL:
You have not collected yet.

410
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:07,634
You doggone, tin-horn gambler.

411
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:13,663
Murrell's loose.

412
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:11,216
MARBLEHEAD: Doggone the dad-burn-it.
Stuck in the creek.

413
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:14,994
All right, folks,
unload and give us a push.

414
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:18,929
Ain't nothing else to do.
Here's where we start playing horses.

415
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:22,099
This is a dreadful situation.

416
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,331
I shall most certainly write
the Bureau of Rivers and Harbors about this.

417
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:30,010
TED: All right, folks,
unload and give us a push.

418
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,574
Oh, no. No, don't put me down.

419
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,342
- Don't put me here.
- There you are.

420
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:38,145
Now then, you stay there.

421
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,311
If you behave yourself,
I may come back and get you.

422
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:49,720
Hey. Watch that there rock.

423
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,428
That one?

424
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:09,277
Hey.

425
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:14,783
I knew there was something I forgot.

426
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:21,351
Kerry, if you let me fall...

427
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:22,826
I wish you would.

428
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:25,557
I fell 10 days ago.

429
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:36,733
Hurry up, Kerry.
You're too slow for a packhorse.

430
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:56,129
- Late today.
TED: Had a rough trip.

431
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:58,265
- Any mail?
TED: Yup.

432
00:31:58,433 --> 00:31:59,730
- There you are.
- Thank you.

433
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:02,233
We won't be here long, folks,
don't stray off.

434
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:05,634
- Where are we gonna stray to?
- Well, got a fair-to-middling saloon.

435
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:08,071
What about you, little man?
Will you have a drink?

436
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:10,710
A drink? Moosehead,
when I come out of that saloon...

437
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:16,646
...l'd be so teetotally tight that if I live
to be 108 years old I'll die with a hangover.

438
00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:18,513
Go ahead, boys, have something.

439
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,018
I don't mind if you wanna join them.

440
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,317
You know,
for the first time in years, I don't.

441
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,151
You're a strange trio.

442
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:29,194
They're so totally different
from you in every way.

443
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,730
I've often wondered
what brought you together.

444
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:35,300
Oh, just luck, like you and I.

445
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:39,031
The interesting part is, what keeps
people together, don't you think?

446
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:54,811
Hello.

447
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,118
What were you dreaming?

448
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,282
Oh, about us.

449
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,791
Was I behaving myself?

450
00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:04,022
We were climbing a mountain together
and we were almost at the top.

451
00:33:04,198 --> 00:33:05,597
But suddenly you stopped me...

452
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:09,567
...as if there was something on the other
side you were afraid for me to see.

453
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,373
There isn't, Kerry, is there?

454
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,338
I've been looking on the other side
of mountains all my life.

455
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,604
- Usually, all I've got was a bumped nose.
- Oh, don't tease me.

456
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,839
There isn't much time.

457
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:24,682
- We know so little about each other.
- What do we wanna know?

458
00:33:24,852 --> 00:33:26,581
You're a very charming young woman.

459
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,222

No, only one or two small accounts.

- Haynes?
- Yes, Haynes or Hayne.

00:42:48,846 --> 00:42:50,837
I thought they might be
depositors of yours.

No, never heard of them.

Sure that's the right name?

614

Frankly, I'm not sure
of anything these days, sir.

615

You see some incredible mirages
in the desert.

616
00:43:00,825 --> 00:43:03,623
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, thanks for the information, sir.

Not at all, sir. It's been a pleasure.

Why, I don't know that it does.
It puts quite a burden on faith, though.

01:05:02,345 --> 01:05:05,109
You're in some kind of danger,
aren't you, Kerry?

920
01:05:05,515 --> 01:05:09,144
Well, Virginia City's a dangerous place.
Besides, there's a war on and...

921
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:11,014
Yes, there's a war on.

922
01:05:13,223 --> 01:05:15,555
- Could I see you for a moment, sir?
- Yes.

923
01:05:15,725 --> 01:05:18,125
Excuse me. What is it?

924
01:05:18,295 --> 01:05:22,197
Someone reported they saw Irby around
the rear door of the Sazerac a half-hour ago.

925
01:05:22,365 --> 01:05:24,265
Good, we'll take a look around.
Wait here.

926
01:05:24,434 --> 01:05:26,197
- I'll be right with you.
- Yes, sir.

927
01:05:26,836 --> 01:05:28,599
Is that why you came here?

928
01:05:28,772 --> 01:05:30,603
I can't tell you about it now, darling.

929
01:05:30,774 --> 01:05:32,833
But I want you to know this,
I do love you...

930
01:05:33,009 --> 01:05:35,569
...and that's the most important thing
in the world.

931
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:41,844
Remember that always, will you?

932
01:05:51,629 --> 01:05:53,460
IRBY:
Close that door.

933
01:05:53,732 --> 01:05:55,324
Vance.

934
01:05:55,567 --> 01:05:57,034
Lock it.

935
01:06:00,238 --> 01:06:03,799
Why did you risk coming here?
Bradford's downstairs now looking for you.

936
01:06:03,975 --> 01:06:07,843
Yes, I saw him. He found the hideout. Every
street leading out of town is blocked...

937
01:06:08,012 --> 01:06:11,607
...with soldiers but we're going tomorrow
night and the gold is going with us.

938
01:06:11,783 --> 01:06:12,807
But how can we?

939
01:06:12,984 --> 01:06:15,452
Remember Murrell, the outlaw?
I made a deal with him.

940
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:17,485
His gang is camped
a few miles from here.

941
01:06:17,655 --> 01:06:20,419
Between 2 and 3 tomorrow night,
they'll attack the garrison.

942
01:06:20,592 --> 01:06:22,787
That'll draw every soldier
out of Virginia City.

943
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:25,691
When they arrive,
we slip out of town with the four wagons.

944
01:06:25,864 --> 01:06:28,424
The others will be up in Box Canyon
waiting for us.

945
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,067
Waiting for us?

946
01:06:30,235 --> 01:06:32,829
But you can't stay here now, Julia.

947
01:06:33,104 --> 01:06:35,163
Or would you rather stay?

948
01:06:35,507 --> 01:06:38,772
Why, I have nothing to stay for, Vance.

949
01:06:38,943 --> 01:06:41,138
Of course I'm going with you.

950
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:45,276
There's just one other thing
left to be done, Julia...

951
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:49,352
...but it's the most important,
and you are the only one who can do it.

952
01:06:49,521 --> 01:06:50,545
What is it, Vance?

953
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:56,020
Get in touch with Bradford, tell him you
know where I'm hiding and send him to me.

954
01:06:56,194 --> 01:06:58,321
Send him to you? What for?

955
01:06:58,496 --> 01:07:00,896
He's the one man in Virginia City
who could stop us.

956
01:07:01,065 --> 01:07:04,933
The moment he saw us start, he'd arouse
a posse to grab us and the gold.

957
01:07:05,103 --> 01:07:08,231
The only way to stop that
is to grab him first.

958
01:07:10,341 --> 01:07:12,832
What are you going to do with him,
Vance?

959
01:07:13,111 --> 01:07:14,203
I don't know yet.

960
01:07:14,979 --> 01:07:17,641
You're going to kill him, aren't you?
Of course you are.

961
01:07:17,816 --> 01:07:21,149
You couldn't afford to leave him here alive,
he knows too much about us.

962
01:07:21,319 --> 01:07:26,188
So I must lead him quietly and unsuspecting
to his death because I'm a woman.

963
01:07:26,357 --> 01:07:28,655
That's something only a woman could do.

964
01:07:28,827 --> 01:07:33,423
Why, all of this was your idea, Julia.
Taking the gold from here.

965
01:07:33,598 --> 01:07:36,226
Remember the look
on Jefferson Davis' face when he said:

966
01:07:36,401 --> 01:07:39,893
"We are very proud of you
and deeply grateful"?

967
01:07:40,872 --> 01:07:42,499
I remember.

968
01:07:42,674 --> 01:07:46,542
"And the hopes of 10 million of us
will be riding with you."

969
01:07:46,878 --> 01:07:47,936
I remember.

970
01:07:48,112 --> 01:07:50,706
That's why your decision right now
is so important.

971
01:07:50,882 --> 01:07:54,249
Oh, but why must I be the one, Vance?
Can't you see this is murder?

972
01:07:54,419 --> 01:07:57,411
It's even worse than murder,
Kerry trusts me.

973
01:07:57,589 --> 01:08:00,080
And what about those
who are trusting us?

974
01:08:00,258 --> 01:08:02,351
When these people leave
with their children...

975
01:08:02,527 --> 01:08:04,620
...they're turning their backs
on their homes.

976
01:08:04,796 --> 01:08:09,927
Some of them are facing death
and they know it, but not one hesitates.

977
01:08:15,006 --> 01:08:16,735
Yes.

978
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:21,977
I know what this means to you, Julia...

979
01:08:22,146 --> 01:08:26,583
...but there's no alternative,
you are the only one who can do it.

980
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,679
What shall I tell him?

981
01:08:32,590 --> 01:08:33,750
Now, listen...

982
01:08:37,395 --> 01:08:40,762
All right, we'll spread out from here.
Moose, you take the north section.

983
01:08:40,932 --> 01:08:43,423
You men check everything up that way.

984
01:08:44,936 --> 01:08:46,801
Come on, Marble, we'll look around here.

985
01:08:46,971 --> 01:08:49,906
By golly. Ain't a man got time
to get a little grog around here?

986
01:08:50,074 --> 01:08:53,043
You're groggy enough, partner. Wait here.

987
01:08:56,848 --> 01:09:00,079
How do you do? I understand
this is a boarding house, is that correct?

988
01:09:00,251 --> 01:09:03,186
- We're filled up.
- Well, thanks. I wasn't looking for a room...

989
01:09:03,354 --> 01:09:06,482
...I was looking for a boarder.
Mind telling me who your guests are?

990
01:09:06,658 --> 01:09:09,422
That's their business. I never ask them.

991
01:09:09,594 --> 01:09:12,859
- Well, would you mind if I looked around?
- You can take a look at this.

992
01:09:13,031 --> 01:09:16,364
I'll have no yellow-livered Yankee
in my house unless it's a dead one.

993
01:09:16,534 --> 01:09:19,025
And I got a twitchy finger, so get.

994
01:09:19,203 --> 01:09:20,795
Well, do you still want to argue?

995
01:09:20,972 --> 01:09:23,440
No, ma'am. I never argue with women.

996
01:09:23,608 --> 01:09:25,508
And certainly not a woman with a gun.

997
01:09:26,311 --> 01:09:28,973
I'd do something for that twitchy finger
if I were you...

998
01:09:29,147 --> 01:09:32,310
...it even makes me nervous. Good day.

999
01:09:33,017 --> 01:09:35,508
So the Union forces retreat, huh?

1000
01:09:35,687 --> 01:09:38,383
Yes, sir. The third battle of Bull Run.

1001
01:09:40,925 --> 01:09:43,621
MAN: Hey, come back here,
you little ragamuffin.

1002
01:09:44,329 --> 01:09:46,229
Here he is, sergeant.

1003
01:09:46,397 --> 01:09:47,557
COBBY:
Let me go.

1004
01:09:48,866 --> 01:09:52,063
- Answer my questions and I'll let you go.
- I can't tell you anything.

1005
01:09:52,236 --> 01:09:55,433
You know every rebel in town,
you run errands for them. Where's Irby?

1006
01:09:55,607 --> 01:09:58,269
- I don't know and I wouldn't tell if I did.
SERGEANT: You're lying.

1007
01:09:58,443 --> 01:10:01,810
- I'll wail that tar out if you don't talk.
COBBY: Go ahead, you're big enough.

1008
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:04,346
Hold on, sergeant. Let the kid alone.

1009
01:10:04,515 --> 01:10:06,983
- Yes, but...
- I said, let him alone.

1010
01:10:07,151 --> 01:10:08,209
Come on, partner.

1011
01:10:08,386 --> 01:10:10,377
We're not fishing
for Southerners your size.

1012
01:10:10,555 --> 01:10:13,490
Yeah, well, I was fishing for you.

1013
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:17,487
- Miss Julia sent me to find you.
- She did?

1014
01:10:17,662 --> 01:10:19,687
- What are you fellas butting in for?
- What?

1015
01:10:19,864 --> 01:10:23,891
If I had my way, I'd whip that little
copperhead until he couldn't stand up.

1016
01:10:34,846 --> 01:10:38,213
If you don't find her on the stage,
you'll find her in her dressing room.

1017
01:10:38,383 --> 01:10:39,907
I see.

1018
01:10:40,852 --> 01:10:44,219
- Thanks. Here's something for your trouble.
- No, thanks, I don't want it.

1019
01:10:44,389 --> 01:10:47,222
Hey, you don't like Yankees much,
do you?

1020
01:10:47,392 --> 01:10:49,087
No, I don't.

1021
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:50,955
Well, I think I know how you feel.

1022
01:10:51,129 --> 01:10:54,223
When I was a boy in Ireland,
I felt the same way about Englishmen.

1023
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:55,525
But you can change.

1024
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,827
Well, thanks all the same.

1025
01:10:58,936 --> 01:11:00,528
So long.

1026
01:11:01,472 --> 01:11:02,962
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

1027
01:11:03,307 --> 01:11:04,831
Come in.

1028
01:11:05,977 --> 01:11:08,309
- Darling, did you send for me?
- Yes.

1029
01:11:08,746 --> 01:11:11,340
- The boy said it was urgent.
- It is.

1030
01:11:14,352 --> 01:11:17,344
Come over here, Kerry,
and sit down by me.

1031
01:11:17,522 --> 01:11:18,989
What is it?

1032
01:11:19,157 --> 01:11:21,557
Oh, I'm worried about you.

1033
01:11:21,726 --> 01:11:25,321
Half of Virginia City knows who you are
and why you're here.

1034
01:11:25,496 --> 01:11:27,054
Why didn't you tell me?

1035
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,358
Well, it's part of my job
not to talk too much.

1036
01:11:29,534 --> 01:11:33,994
- I would have told you at the right time.
- Oh, there'll never be a right time.

1037
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:36,638
I know these Southern people,
I've lived among them.

1038
01:11:36,808 --> 01:11:39,072
They'll kill you
before they'd give up their gold.

1039
01:11:39,243 --> 01:11:41,108
You can hardly blame them for trying.

1040
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:43,839
But they're gonna have
to improve their aim first.

1041
01:11:44,015 --> 01:11:45,880
You mustn't go on with the search.

1042
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:48,245
Please. For my sake.

1043
01:11:49,387 --> 01:11:52,788
But I must go on with it.
This job's gotta be finished.

1044
01:11:52,957 --> 01:11:56,825
But what can you, one man,
hope to accomplish against hundreds?

1045
01:11:56,994 --> 01:12:00,896
You can't stop them, Kerry,
the whole Union Army can't stop them.

1046
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:04,294
I love you, darling.

1047
01:12:04,469 --> 01:12:06,767
I'm so afraid for you.

1048
01:12:08,706 --> 01:12:11,072
I love you too, Julia.

1049
01:12:11,509 --> 01:12:14,034
But I won't run out
and leave them a clear field here.

1050
01:12:14,212 --> 01:12:17,079
I couldn't do it. Don't you see?

1051
01:12:17,248 --> 01:12:20,376
This means too much
to too many people.

1052
01:12:21,252 --> 01:12:23,618
Does it mean more than...?

1053
01:12:23,788 --> 01:12:25,016
Than you and me?

1054
01:12:27,825 --> 01:12:30,191
It's the only thing that does.

1055
01:12:32,463 --> 01:12:34,397
All right, if that's your decision.

1056
01:12:34,565 --> 01:12:36,192
I'm sorry, darling.

1057
01:12:36,367 --> 01:12:38,426
I want to help you.

1058
01:12:38,636 --> 01:12:40,627
I can tell you where to find their leader.

1059
01:12:40,805 --> 01:12:42,397
- Who? Irby?
- Yes.

1060
01:12:42,573 --> 01:12:46,031
He's in love with one of the girls here.
She saw him less than an hour ago.

1061
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:49,543
- Where is she? Where can I talk to her?
- She'd be afraid to talk to you.

1062
01:12:49,714 --> 01:12:53,946
She said that Irby's ready to make a deal,
give himself up tonight if you come alone.

1063
01:12:54,118 --> 01:12:56,586
- Then he must know he's beaten.
- Yes.

1064
01:12:56,754 --> 01:12:57,812
Where is he?

1065
01:12:57,989 --> 01:13:00,457
There will be someone here tonight
to take you to him.

1066
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:02,024
I see.

1067

You ain't declared that hefty a load.

01:41:10,746 --> 01:41:12,509
For one of them, especially.

1372
01:41:12,682 --> 01:41:14,912
You sure was right
about that gold train, Kerry.

1373
01:41:15,084 --> 01:41:17,279
That's the way they're headed, all right.

1374
01:41:17,487 --> 01:41:18,715
Walton, Brown.

1375
01:41:22,258 --> 01:41:24,556
- Yes, sir.
- Ride back to Major Drewery's camp.

1376
01:41:24,727 --> 01:41:27,855
- Tell him to follow us as quickly as he can.
- Yes, sir.

1377
01:42:01,597 --> 01:42:04,395
They started out with 10 wagons,
now they only have four.

1378
01:42:04,567 --> 01:42:07,468
Whatever money they got is in those four,
that's a cinch.

1379
01:42:21,784 --> 01:42:23,752
I figured we'd run onto them about here.

1380
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,717
You figured? Didn't I tell you?

1381
01:42:25,888 --> 01:42:28,322
Yes, I've often wondered
what I'd do without you two.

1382
01:42:28,491 --> 01:42:29,890
You see?

Maybe we give them little surprise, huh?

- What do you want here?

I have some business to talk with Irby.

1396

He's finished his business with you.

1397
01:43:19,642 --> 01:43:21,769
Maybe he thinks so, but not me.

1398

For the fine service I have given him,
two little bags of gold is not enough.

You named your price and we paid it.

1400

Now, get out of here.

1401
01:43:35,057 --> 01:43:37,821
I think maybe you tell Irby
I want to talk with him, huh?

1402

Hold your fire, men. Let them come in.

1407

Don't shoot at them. Hold your fire.

- Thanks, Irby.
- Forget it.

1409

- Plenty.

- Let's get his shirt open.

Yes.

That's a bad one. Dr. Cameron?

IRBY: Bradford?
- Yes.

You take command, will you?

- Right. Don't worry.
- Yes.

1421

Get him comfortable, doctor.

- Julia.

1424
01:46:32,268 --> 01:46:34,702
Come over here. Follow me, quick.

1425
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:36,337
Come on.

1426
01:46:37,173 --> 01:46:39,903
Now, line up shoulder to shoulder.
Now, hold your fire.

1427
01:46:40,075 --> 01:46:42,873
And when they get close,
let them have a little volley.

All right.

Now, we hold off until daylight.

1433
01:47:15,211 --> 01:47:19,045
And when the sun comes up,
we finish off this wagon train pretty quick.

1434
01:47:33,596 --> 01:47:35,223
Better build that barricade higher.

1435

Get a little sleep if you can, Vance.

Thanks, doc.

I'm sorry.

01:47:51,113 --> 01:47:53,377
I was hoping you'd come.

1440

What's our chance of holding out?

1441
01:47:58,621 --> 01:48:00,248
Not much, frankly.

As soon as daylight comes
they'll be down on us again.

Tomorrow, maybe. Maybe not for days.

If any of us gets through...

1448
01:48:15,704 --> 01:48:17,433
...l'd like it to do some good.

1449
01:48:18,107 --> 01:48:20,200
So would l, but that's not up to me.

1450
01:48:20,376 --> 01:48:22,640
What happens to the gold,
that's out of my hands.

1451
01:48:22,811 --> 01:48:23,835
No, it isn't.

1452
01:48:24,013 --> 01:48:26,447
It was your job to get us and you did it.

1453
01:48:27,583 --> 01:48:31,144
Anyway, the South can't win now,
but the gold still belongs to our people.

1454
01:48:33,155 --> 01:48:37,922
After the war, they'll need it to help
thousands like them throughout the South.

01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:41,129
I thought because of Julia, you might...

1456

I told you, whatever happens to the gold
is not up to me.

1457
01:48:47,169 --> 01:48:48,796
I promise you one thing, though.

1458
01:48:48,971 --> 01:48:50,495
Murrell won't get it.

1459
01:48:50,673 --> 01:48:51,765
But if Drewery...

1460
01:48:51,941 --> 01:48:54,171
That's all I can promise.

Right.

1464
01:49:07,756 --> 01:49:11,590
Too bad you and I had to be
on opposite sides of the fence in this.

1465
01:49:12,394 --> 01:49:14,385
I think we might have been friends.

Oh, he's pretty bad, poor fella.
I don't think he'll make it.

- Where?

- Well, I'll be.

Look, get every able-bodied men in camp.

into the first wagon there.

- Yes, what is it?

1480
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:53,859
- How much gunpowder have we got?
- Kegs of it.

1481
01:49:54,036 --> 01:49:55,799
Get out two kegs and a length of fuse.

1482
01:49:55,971 --> 01:49:58,303
- What are you trying to do?
- We're moving the gold.

What for? What are you gonna do with it?

Well, look, doctor,
you take care of the wounded...

...and I'll worry about the rest, huh?

Come on. Here, hitch this horse up.

1490

- Irby.

1491
01:50:18,927 --> 01:50:21,589
- You'd better go to him, Julia.
- Vance wouldn't trust you.

1492
01:50:21,764 --> 01:50:25,495
You've tricked him and now you plan
to use us to take what's still ours.

Oh, I'd rather Murrell got it
than the North.

01:50:27,903 --> 01:50:29,928
I don't use those people who trust me.

1495
01:50:30,105 --> 01:50:34,201
In any case, this time tomorrow none of us
will care who has the gold or where it is...

...because we probably won't be alive.

There'll be a certain rough justice
about that.

What do you know about justice?
What do you know...?

Now, the rest of you men, get
on those wheels and start the load rolling.

01:54:48,030 --> 01:54:49,895
DREWERY:
Is the gold safe?

1527
01:54:50,565 --> 01:54:52,590
Well, where is it? Let's have a look at it.

1528
01:54:55,637 --> 01:54:56,729
There isn't any gold.

1529
01:54:56,905 --> 01:54:59,840
DREWERY: Is this your idea of a joke,
Bradford? Answer my question.

1530
01:55:00,008 --> 01:55:01,441
Have you searched the wagons?

1531
01:55:02,277 --> 01:55:04,404
I told you, sir, there isn't any gold.

1532
01:55:04,579 --> 01:55:06,376
Why, that's absurd.

1533
01:55:06,548 --> 01:55:09,676
Do you think I followed you
hundreds of miles to believe this lie?

1534
01:55:09,851 --> 01:55:11,443
What have you done with it?

1535
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:12,882
Who are you holding it for?

1536
01:55:13,522 --> 01:55:15,046
Just a minute, Bradford.

1537
01:55:15,490 --> 01:55:16,980
Yes, sir.

1538
01:55:17,426 --> 01:55:19,417
You're under arrest.

1539
01:55:21,163 --> 01:55:24,621
Get your belongings together,
we're taking you back to Virginia City.

1540
01:55:34,776 --> 01:55:36,801
It is the verdict of this court martial...

1541
01:55:36,978 --> 01:55:41,074
...that you seized and withheld contraband
of war for private reasons...

1542
01:55:41,249 --> 01:55:44,013
...and are therefore guilty of high treason.

1543
01:55:44,619 --> 01:55:46,883
Before final sentence is passed...

1544
01:55:47,055 --> 01:55:49,785
...is there anything else
you wish to say in your defense?

1545
01:55:49,958 --> 01:55:53,155
Yes, sir,
there is something I'd like to add.

1546
01:55:53,428 --> 01:55:55,123
It's true I took the gold...

1547
01:55:55,297 --> 01:55:57,822
...and I'm the only one responsible
for taking it...

1548
01:55:57,999 --> 01:56:00,058
...but not for the reasons the court infers.

1549
01:56:00,235 --> 01:56:02,328
The court is willing
to consider any reason...

1550
01:56:02,504 --> 01:56:04,802
...consistent with your obligations
as a soldier.

1551
01:56:04,973 --> 01:56:08,101
There are some things that aren't covered
by the military code, sir.

1552
01:56:08,276 --> 01:56:09,538
This was one of them.

1553
01:56:09,711 --> 01:56:11,804
You came here, not as a private citizen...

1554
01:56:11,980 --> 01:56:14,540
...but as an officer
with an official duty to perform.

1555
01:56:14,716 --> 01:56:17,844
And I performed it,
to the best of my ability.

1556
01:56:18,019 --> 01:56:20,647
My job was to see
that the gold didn't reach the South.

1557
01:56:21,123 --> 01:56:24,115
I knew that if it did, it'd prolong the war.

1558
01:56:24,292 --> 01:56:25,953
The gold did not reach the South.

1559
01:56:26,128 --> 01:56:27,891
That was not enough.

1560
01:56:28,063 --> 01:56:31,726
It was also your duty to hand it over
as contraband to your government.

1561
01:56:31,900 --> 01:56:33,162
That's true, sir.

1562
01:56:33,335 --> 01:56:34,859
I had a choice to make...

1563
01:56:35,036 --> 01:56:37,834
...a choice between doing my duty
as a soldier or as a man.

1564
01:56:38,907 --> 01:56:42,274
Well, I made that choice. I couldn't
very well have done anything else...

1565
01:56:42,444 --> 01:56:44,639
...after I saw what
those people went through...

1566
01:56:44,813 --> 01:56:46,713
...for a cause they believed to be right.

1567
01:56:46,882 --> 01:56:48,645
And what has this to do with you?

1568
01:56:50,252 --> 01:56:54,018
Their leader hoped that someday that gold
would still return to the South...

1569
01:56:54,189 --> 01:56:59,183
...where it belonged, to help them rebuild
their homes and restore some of their pride.

1570
01:56:59,628 --> 01:57:01,118
Continue.

1571
01:57:01,296 --> 01:57:03,958
I don't think I can explain it
any better than that, sir.

1572
01:57:04,132 --> 01:57:07,795
Except that I believe
I'm doing the right thing.

1573
01:57:07,969 --> 01:57:10,335
That's why I refused to deliver the gold.

1574
01:57:10,505 --> 01:57:11,836
That's why I still refuse.

1575
01:57:12,007 --> 01:57:15,204
Captain Bradford,
that's your final decision?

1576
01:57:15,977 --> 01:57:17,410
Yes, it is, sir.

1577
01:57:27,756 --> 01:57:29,815
It is the sentence of this court martial...

1578
01:57:29,991 --> 01:57:33,688
...that you shall be executed
on the morning of April the 9th, 1865...

1579
01:57:33,862 --> 01:57:38,322
...in the usual manner at the usual time
prescribed by regulations.

1580
01:58:00,922 --> 01:58:02,787
JULIA:
l... I can't tell you...

1581
01:58:02,958 --> 01:58:05,483
I've no words to...

1582
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:08,026
Oh, I'm so deeply grateful
for this audience.

1583
01:58:08,196 --> 01:58:10,721
I know how busy you are, Mr. President.

1584
01:58:10,899 --> 01:58:13,663
I was afraid you wouldn't see me,
because I'm a Virginian.

1585
01:58:13,835 --> 01:58:16,395
Why, I've got a lot of friends down south,
Miss Hayne...

1586
01:58:16,571 --> 01:58:20,007
...and more relatives in Virginia
than a Blue Ridge rabbit.

1587
01:58:20,475 --> 01:58:22,602
I've sort of missed them
these last four years.

1588
01:58:22,777 --> 01:58:25,041
Mr. President,
the execution is set for tomorrow.

1589
01:58:25,213 --> 01:58:27,272
That's less than six hours in Nevada.

1590
01:58:27,449 --> 01:58:30,543
I've been studying the minutes
of the court martial, Miss Hayne.

1591
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:34,951
According to military code,
there's no question of Bradford's guilt.

1592
01:58:35,123 --> 01:58:37,318
I know that, I heard them say so.

1593
01:58:37,492 --> 01:58:39,119
I was there.

1594
01:58:39,294 --> 01:58:41,091
Oh, but I beg you, Mr. President...

1595
01:58:41,263 --> 01:58:44,061
...judge him as a man
and not by military code.

1596
01:58:44,232 --> 01:58:46,860
He mustn't... He can't be killed.

1597
01:58:47,035 --> 01:58:49,731
I'm not a military man, my child.

1598
01:58:49,905 --> 01:58:52,032
He won't be killed.

1599
01:58:54,709 --> 01:58:57,576
Thank God that the killing is over.

1600
01:58:58,513 --> 01:59:01,141
Your General Lee is meeting
our General Grant tomorrow...

1601
01:59:01,316 --> 01:59:06,117
...at a place called Appomattox
Court House to discuss the terms of peace.

1602
01:59:08,123 --> 01:59:11,115
Then we've lost?

1603
01:59:11,293 --> 01:59:13,625
Not lost, found.

1604
01:59:13,795 --> 01:59:16,855
They're coming back, back in the Union.

1605
01:59:17,032 --> 01:59:19,933
Miss Hayne, you came over 2000 miles...

1606
01:59:20,101 --> 01:59:23,229
...to save the life of a man
who was once your enemy.

1607
01:59:23,405 --> 01:59:25,703
I think, very likely,
you're in love with him.

1608
01:59:25,874 --> 01:59:30,709
Well, to me, you two are symbols
of what I hope we can do for our country.

1609
01:59:31,313 --> 01:59:35,010
Mr. Lincoln,
I didn't know you were like this.

1610
01:59:35,183 --> 01:59:39,347
I want to tell them in Virginia,
everywhere.

1611
01:59:39,521 --> 01:59:42,922
Yes, tell them we're not enemies,
but friends.

1612
01:59:43,091 --> 01:59:46,720
That in my heart and in thousands like mine
throughout America...

1613
01:59:46,895 --> 01:59:50,126
...there is no spirit of revenge
in our victory.

1614
01:59:50,398 --> 01:59:53,492
There must be no harbor of hatred
in their defeat.

1615
01:59:53,668 --> 01:59:57,729
Tell them we are now one people,
united by blood and fire.

1616
01:59:57,906 --> 02:00:02,172
<i>And that from this day forward, </i>
<i>our destiny is indivisible. </i>

1617
02:00:02,344 --> 02:00:05,905
<i>With malice toward none, </i>
<i>with charity for all. </i>

1618
02:00:06,081 --> 02:00:09,380
<i>With firmness in the right</i>
<i>as God gives us to see the right. </i>

1619
02:00:09,551 --> 02:00:12,714
<i>Let us now strive</i>
<i>to bind up the nation's wounds. </i>

1620
02:00:12,887 --> 02:00:16,448
<i>To do all which may achieve</i>
<i>and cherish a just and lasting peace... </i>

1621
02:00:16,625 --> 02:00:19,924
<i>... among ourselves and with all nations. </i>

1622
02:01:01,569 --> 02:01:03,560
