WE'RE NOT.

00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:53,234

HE DIDN'T HEAD
FOR MEXICO,

00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:59,067
AND HE COULD'VE
AND MADE IT, EASY.

00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:02,000
INSTEAD HE--HE HEADED
INTO BAD COUNTRY

807
00:48:02,067 --> 00:48:04,033
AND THEN SWUNG NORTH.

808
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,234
NOW, PUT THAT
WITH THE FACT

809
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,968
THAT HE BOUGHT
SUPPLIES IN TOWN,

810
00:48:08,033 --> 00:48:09,934
AND I THINK THAT POINTS
TO HIM HAVING SOMEPLACE

HE WANTS KEPT SAFE.
