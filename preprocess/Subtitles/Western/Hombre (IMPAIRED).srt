I guess you must be

I'm Russell.
Who are you?

I'm Billy Lee Blake.
I work for Henry Mendez.

If he sent you for horses,
all we got are green.

Mr. Mendez
wants to see you.

He's waiting down at
Delgado's station.

He told me to tell you
to come on in.

Anyway, I brought you here
about something else.

42
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,713
I thought you'd
want to know

43
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:47,716
that Mr. Russell died
three nights ago.

44

He went in his sleep.

Doesn't that affect you?
The man who raised you?

46

Seventy-eight years
is a long life.

Yes. He was an old man.

48
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:04,165
Not a bad one, either.

49
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:07,670
Anyway, he left you his watch
and a boarding house

to think about.

Why?

55
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:21,183
Because you can live
among white men again...

has given you.

00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:27,073
I don't have anybody
to talk to.

164
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:29,079
I don't have anybody
to visit.

165
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:31,138
Big excitement around here
is to watch Jessie

166
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:33,150
chop the head off
a chicken for dinner.

167
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:34,879
If you're hurting
for something to do

168
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,750
I'm poking through
every sock I own.

169
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:39,255
Try putting a darn
in some of them.

170
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:41,258
Darns raise blisters.
Buy some new ones.

171
00:16:41,326 --> 00:16:43,760
You must think
I'm made of money.

172
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:47,264
- If you are, I never see it.
- Now I'm cheap, huh?

173
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:49,266
This isn't what
you promised me.

174
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:51,268
I promised you
I'd do the best I could.

175
00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:53,429
What did you think
married life was gonna be?

176
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:56,303
Getting away from a hardscrabble
ranch on the Rogue River

177
00:16:56,374 --> 00:17:00,071
and my old man who never raised
anything but kids and bad luck!

178
00:17:03,414 --> 00:17:05,780
The lovemaking's fine, isn't it?

179
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,283
No, it isn't fine!

180
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:11,220
It's mostly something you want to do
and usually without taking a shave.

181
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:13,723
Look. You don't want
to have any kids.

182
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,725
You don't want to
keep house.

183
00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:18,227
Now you don't want
to sleep with me.

184
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:21,231
I can do better to get
a dog to keep me company!

185
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:31,240
I'd like to see
these forks just once

186
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:34,244
without yesterday's
dried egg on them.

187
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:39,749
The walls
of this house

188
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:41,751
are paper thin,
Billy Lee.

189
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:43,753
What's that
supposed to mean?

190
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:46,756
It means you can hear
everything through them,

191
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:48,257
and I mean everything.

192
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:50,351
We fight a lot.

193
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:53,397
What's wrong
with you two?

194
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:55,762
Well, what isn't?

195
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:01,202
What did you
get married for?

196
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:06,710
So you'd have the right
to sleep in the same bed?

197
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:08,177
I guess.

198
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:12,706
Well, that part of it isn't
going to last, believe it or not.

199
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:15,116
She'll get fat,
and you'll get old.

200
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:16,619
Then what?

201
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:19,714
I'm not worried about then.
I'm worried about now.

202
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,225
You try living with
the 24-hour bellyaching

203
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:24,284
and see how you like it.

204
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:26,387
That's the price you pay
if you want it

205
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:28,398
where you can
nudge it in the night.

206
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:33,236
Billy,
time to go to work.

207
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:36,239
Well...

208
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:39,242
I see the silver's being
polished all nice and bright

209
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,470
for Mr. Russell.

210
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:42,638
And what's the matter
with that?

211
00:18:42,714 --> 00:18:46,650
And who are you going
to all this trouble for?

212
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:50,017
A man who was carried off by
the Apaches when he was a child,

213
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,489
raised among red devils
to be a red devil.

214
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:56,584
Is that what I'm gonna have sleeping
in the bed in my front bedroom?

215
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:59,255
I'll tell you
something else about him.

216
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,264
When old man Russell found him

217
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:03,266
amongst some army
prisoners at Fort Thomas

218
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:07,771
and took him to his home,
gave him his name,

219
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,205
this ingrate went back
to the Apache again.

220
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,210
He had no use
for the white man.

221
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:17,214
So... you don't waste
your time with this, hmm?

222
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,216
He eats with the fingers.

223
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,718
When I get done with him,

224
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,414
he'll be eating
out of my hand.

225
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:25,922
You think so?

226
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,184
Uh-huh.

227
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,243
Mr. Russell?

228
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,249
I'm Jessie Brown.
I've been expecting you.

229
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,754
The gate seems to be
off the hinge.

230
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,258
I know. I've been meaning to
do something about that

231
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,759
sometime or other.

232
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,261
Come on in.
We can't talk here.

233

[Door Squeaks]

234
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,271
I hear it.

235
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,776
The roof s got
a nice, big leak too.

236
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,777
If it were raining now,

237
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,279
you'd drown right where
you're standing.

238
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,782
But it isn't raining,
is it?

239
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,283
Doesn't appear to be.

240

[Squeak]

241
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,548
Mr. Russell,

242
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:33,988
this house has got ten rooms,
two flights of stairs,

243
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:36,856
and one woman to
keep it all nailed down.

244
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:37,860
That's me.

245
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:38,987
All right.

246
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:42,123
Would you like to see
the rest of the house?

247
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,634
There's nothing else
to show you

248
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,670
except me
and the account books,

249
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:50,333
and you've already had
a fairly critical look at me.

250
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:53,275
Well, I'll take
a look at the books.

251
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:58,080
You might like to know

252
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:00,583
that old man Russell
had a fine funeral.

253
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:02,516
Everyone in the house
chipped in.

254
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:05,021
We bought him a horseshoe
of red carnations.

255
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:07,023
They didn't last
in this heat,

256
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:08,524
but they
were pretty.

257
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:11,027
And we got him
a marble headstone.

258
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:13,529
It has his name on it,

259
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:15,532
and underneath
we had them put,

260
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,534
"In the fullness
of his years."

261
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:19,035
Is that all right?

262
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:21,367
I'd settle for that
on my own slab.

263
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,872
What do you figure
yours is gonna read?

264
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,204
"Shot dead," probably.

265
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:27,642
Don't people like you,
Mr. Russell?

266
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:29,577
Only takes
one who doesn't.

267
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:35,551
Let's assume you're
going to have a future.

268
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,214
How would you feel about
going into business with me?

269
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:42,385
I'll make the same arrangement with
you that I had with old man Russell.

270
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,054
These are the accounts.

271
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:47,063
You'll clear $300 a year

272
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:49,065
without even
lifting a finger...

273
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,569
and you'll have a place
to hang your hats, besides.

274
00:21:57,141 --> 00:22:00,076
I've had an offer
on this house...

275
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:03,011
for a herd of horses
down in Contention.

276
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:06,879
I think
I'm going to take it.

277
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:11,251
You knew that when
you walked in the door.

278
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:17,526
Let me ask you
something, lady.

279
00:22:17,595 --> 00:22:20,029
This house here that
you're so hot about,

280
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:21,530
it's mine, isn't it?

281
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,032
Yes, it's yours.

282
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,536
I can sell it or not sell it,
whichever, right?

283
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:29,539
You can do
what you want to.

284
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:31,541
Was there anything
in that will

285
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:33,304
that made provision
for you?

286
00:22:33,377 --> 00:22:35,242
Not a line.

287
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,543
Then it turns out
that I don't have

288
00:22:37,615 --> 00:22:40,049
any responsibility
toward you at all.

289
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:42,551
You don't owe me
a thing.

290
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,087
No. Fact is, I don't.

291
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:47,556
And I'm not one
to quarrel with the facts,

292
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,320
Mr. Russell.

Got something to say,

nobody heard it.

Why? Something wrong?

00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,014
I'm high and dry.

301
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:13,516
Well, now, that's
kind of sudden, ain't it?

302
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:15,518
It's his house
and my luck.

303
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:18,578
If you're hurting for money,
I can let you have a little.

304
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:20,647
You can let me have
more than that.

- Make an honest woman out of me.

Come on, Jess.
You're already that.

307
00:23:25,596 --> 00:23:28,030
Now, don't hedge.
I need an answer.

308
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:29,532
You appear to be it.

309
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,036
That's a hell of a romantic
way of looking at it.

310
00:23:33,104 --> 00:23:35,038
You could do a lot worse.

When you got the stomachache, I'm
ready with the bicarbonate of soda.

314

When you get a cold, I'm the one
who brings up the croup kettle.

I know I'm not 20,
but that's not too bad.

Over the years, I have learned

00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,001
Not a chance.

320
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,004
Well...

321
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,505
I've gone this far.

322
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:13,010
So if it's not
too undignified to ask,

323
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,510
why not?

324
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,846
Jessie, you could be the Queen
of Sheba with a rose in your teeth,

325
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:23,910
you could be Velvet-skin Annie
out of a Frisco hook shop,

326
00:24:23,988 --> 00:24:25,421
the answer
would still be "no."

327
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:28,083
You got me in pretty
classy company anyhow.

328
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,150
I been working since
I was ten years old,

329
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:32,388
cleaning spittoons
at a dime a day.

330
00:24:32,463 --> 00:24:34,556
It's now 30 years later and
all I can see out the window

331
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:36,759
is a dirt road
going nowhere.

332
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,029
The only thing
that changes the view

333
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:42,197
is the spotted dog lifting his leg
against the wall over there.

334
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,537
Saturday nights,
I haul in the town drunks.

335
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:48,045
I get their 25-cent dinners
and their rotgut liquor

336
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,546
heaved up over the front
of my one good shirt.

337
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:54,051
I wear three pounds of iron
strapped to my leg.

338
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,552
That makes me fair game
for any punk cowboy

339
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,054
who's had one too many.

340
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:01,489
No, Jess.
I don't need a wife.

341
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,527
I need out.

342
00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:07,052
Doesn't seem to be
my day, does it?

343
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,531
I'm doing you
a favor, honey.

344
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,004
Anytime a man
weasels out on you,

345
00:25:15,072 --> 00:25:18,508
it turns out that
he's doing you a favor.

346
00:25:18,576 --> 00:25:21,511
Well, maybe you are, Frank.

347
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:46,736
Are you in charge here?

348
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:48,032
Henry Mendez.

349
00:25:48,105 --> 00:25:51,040
It's urgent that my husband
and I get to Bisbee.

350
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:53,542
I want to arrange
to leave tonight.

351
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:56,546
- The line is closed.
- I'm prepared to hire a rig.

352
00:25:56,614 --> 00:25:57,911
We don't have any.

353
00:25:57,982 --> 00:25:59,347
What do you have?

354
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:00,782
Nothing at all, lady.

355
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:01,977
We got a mud wagon.

356
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:05,580
Who's going to drive it?

357
00:26:05,656 --> 00:26:07,180
I could do it.

358
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:08,691
He doesn't have
enough experience.

359
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,693
The company would
not allow it.

360
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:12,991
I'm willing
to let him drive.

361
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:15,498
You might also
be willing to sue us

362
00:26:15,566 --> 00:26:16,498
in case
something happens.

363
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:18,000
If I bought the wagon?

364
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:19,502
It's not mine to sell.

365
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:23,506
If I paid for more
than just our fares?

366
00:26:23,574 --> 00:26:26,008
Well, you'll need
a driver, horses...

367
00:26:26,077 --> 00:26:27,510
four, maybe six horses.

368
00:26:27,578 --> 00:26:30,012
And the relay stations
aren't working anymore.

369
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:33,482
The same horses
will have to go all the way.

370
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,520
If they don't make it,
who's going to pay for them?

371
00:26:36,587 --> 00:26:40,523
I'll buy the horses. So there's
no other problem, is there?

372
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:43,025
You want to get there
bad, don't you?

373
00:26:43,094 --> 00:26:44,186
Settle it.

374
00:26:44,261 --> 00:26:46,525
We'll go to the hotel
and have dinner.

375
00:26:46,597 --> 00:26:50,533
That should give you time
to find a man and get ready.

376
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:52,034
I don't know, lady.

377
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:54,537
You'll make a month's wages
in three days.

378
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:56,038
You'll be ready.

379
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:09,486
Me and Doris want to get
out of here, so does Jess.

380
00:27:09,553 --> 00:27:10,986
That's three more of us.

381
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:13,489
And Russell's looking
for a ride too.

382
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:14,990
All right,
that's four.

383
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:16,993
Why can't we do it?

384
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:18,494
Have I said we couldn't?

385
00:27:30,074 --> 00:27:32,590
Whoa!

386
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:39,590
Is everybody ready?

387
00:27:39,664 --> 00:27:42,030
I saw that fella Mendez.
I'm going along with you.

388
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:44,363
Going to Bisbee to get married.
What do you think?

389
00:27:44,435 --> 00:27:47,871
Not much, but that's up to you.
Here's your ticket.

390
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:50,874
If there are any stops open
on the way, show that for meals.

391
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:52,375
Drinks are extra.

392
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:54,877
Hand it in when you
reach your destination.

393
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:56,379
Hey, this one's for him.

394
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:58,381
Want to hand it to him?

395
00:27:58,449 --> 00:27:59,882
Sure.

396
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:07,323
I see you're
going to Contention.

397
00:28:07,391 --> 00:28:09,325
I change there for Bisbee.

398
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:12,658
Yesterday I was in the army, and
next week I'll be a mining man.

399
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,665
Week after, I'll have a wife
all arranged for and waiting.

400
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:17,928
Isn't that something?

401
00:28:18,002 --> 00:28:19,333
Yes, it is.

402
00:28:19,403 --> 00:28:21,769
What did you do
with my house plant?

403
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,171
I stuck it in the boot.
It's O.K.

404
00:28:24,242 --> 00:28:25,675
It better be.

405
00:28:25,743 --> 00:28:28,007
I nursed that thing along
for six years.

406
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,512
[Door Opens]

407
00:28:47,832 --> 00:28:50,357
- Cicero Grimes.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:28:50,434 --> 00:28:53,870
Well, write it down, boy,
for the coach out front.

409
00:28:53,938 --> 00:28:55,371
It's a special run.

410
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:58,636
I know that.
That's why I'm going on it.

411
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:00,643
I'm afraid
it's full-up.

412
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:03,305
You can get
one more on up top.

413
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:07,010
No one's allowed to ride with
the driver. That's a company rule.

414
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:11,946
They going?

415
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:14,321
Yes, sir. Both of them.

416
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:28,838
You got a ticket for
that stage out in front?

417
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:34,168
Well, that's it.

418
00:29:34,245 --> 00:29:36,770
You can give me your ticket,
and you can take the next stage.

419
00:29:36,847 --> 00:29:39,145
That's a funny idea.

420
00:29:39,216 --> 00:29:43,585
No, that's not a funny idea.
That's a good idea.

421
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:47,647
See, you could stay here,
get drunk, have some fun.

422
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:49,158
Now, how's that sound?

423
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:51,820
But I'm gonna be traveling tonight.
No. I don't think so.

424
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:55,696
Leave him alone! You come late,
you find your own way.

425
00:29:58,736 --> 00:30:00,169
What did you say?

426
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:01,670
I said why don't you
leave him alone?

427
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:04,708
The man wants to take
the stage, let him take it.

428
00:30:11,248 --> 00:30:14,183
Well, suppose I take
your ticket instead.

429
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:17,687
You just walk in and take
someone else's seat?

430
00:30:17,755 --> 00:30:20,189
Looks like it, don't it?

431
00:30:20,257 --> 00:30:23,192
Somebody's pulling
a joke on somebody.

432
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,353
You think so?

433
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:35,466
What kind of a business
do you run here?

434
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:37,473
You let a man walk in
and say he's taking your seat

435
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,031
after paying the fare?

436
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,340
The company doesn't
do anything about it?

437
00:30:41,412 --> 00:30:43,710
Friend.

438
00:30:45,282 --> 00:30:47,716
This business is
between you and me.

439
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:52,722
We don't want anybody else
poking their nose into it, do we?

440
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:55,088
You wearing a gun?

441
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:00,195
You better get one.

442
00:31:00,264 --> 00:31:03,165
You can't just threaten
a man like that.

443
00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:06,203
There are witnesses here
seeing you threaten me.

444
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,670
They heard you call me
a dirty name.

445
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:10,172
I never called you anything.

446
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:13,802
And even
if they didn't, I did.

447
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:17,244
I didn't say a word.

448
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:26,188
Now, friend...

449
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:29,192
I'm going to step out
into the street here,

450
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,855
and if you don't come out
in about one minute,

451
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:37,128
I'm going to have to
come back in here.

452
00:32:13,737 --> 00:32:15,432
You should have
done something.

453
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:19,402
You talking to me, lady?

454
00:32:19,477 --> 00:32:20,910
Yes, to you.

455
00:32:20,978 --> 00:32:22,673
It wasn't my business.

456
00:32:22,746 --> 00:32:24,611
What if he'd taken
your ticket?

457
00:32:24,682 --> 00:32:25,876
He didn't.

458
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:29,181
That soldier would have
helped you, and you know it.

459
00:32:29,253 --> 00:32:31,187
I didn't ask him for any.

460
00:32:31,255 --> 00:32:33,689
He didn't even
have a gun.

461
00:32:33,757 --> 00:32:36,885
That's his business,
he don't want to carry one.

462
00:32:39,263 --> 00:32:42,061
Takes a lot to light
a fire under you.

463
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:44,693
If it's all right
with you, lady,

464
00:32:44,768 --> 00:32:47,202
I just didn't feel
like bleeding for him.

465
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:50,206
And even if it isn't
all right with you.

466
00:33:24,775 --> 00:33:27,175
What if there were
Apaches out there now,

467
00:33:27,244 --> 00:33:28,711
watching us?

468
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:30,713
Don't alarm yourself,
young lady.

469
00:33:30,781 --> 00:33:32,214
The wild, free ones

470
00:33:32,283 --> 00:33:34,183
are all up in the mountains.

471
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:35,684
The wild, caught ones

472
00:33:35,753 --> 00:33:36,981
are at San Carlos.

473
00:33:37,054 --> 00:33:38,487
I've heard
a lot of stories

474
00:33:38,556 --> 00:33:41,150
about what Indians
do to white women.

475
00:33:41,225 --> 00:33:43,693
They do the same thing
to white women

476
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:45,194
they do to Indian women,

477
00:33:45,262 --> 00:33:48,959
and they don't mind it much,
red or white.

478
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:51,399
I don't know if the ladies
enjoy that kind of talk.

479
00:33:51,468 --> 00:33:53,732
What kind of talk?

480
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:56,432
About Apache Indians
and what they do to women.

481
00:33:58,776 --> 00:34:01,336
You saying
I got a loose mouth?

482
00:34:01,412 --> 00:34:03,539
If he wasn't
saying it, I am.

483
00:34:03,614 --> 00:34:07,015
Right. That lady
speaks right up, don't she?

484
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:08,210
Mm-hmm.

485
00:34:08,285 --> 00:34:12,085
If you want to know
if I'm carrying a gun, I'm not.

486
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:15,648
My tongue is my only
weapon, Mr. Grimes.

487
00:34:15,726 --> 00:34:17,091
And it's deadly.

488
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:29,105
I've lived among the Apaches
on a reservation...

489
00:34:29,173 --> 00:34:33,542
the women grinding corn
and rubbing skins,

490
00:34:33,611 --> 00:34:35,044
the men almost naked...

491
00:34:35,112 --> 00:34:36,670
some of them quite striking.

492
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:39,181
Just when you begin to
find them almost beautiful,

493
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,184
they squat
and pick at themselves

494
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:42,446
with the dogs

495
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,679
sniffing at them.

496
00:34:43,754 --> 00:34:46,222
I can't imagine
eating a dog

497
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,190
and not thinking
anything of it.

498
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:50,193
You ever been
hungry, lady?

499
00:34:50,261 --> 00:34:52,195
Not just ready for supper,

500
00:34:52,263 --> 00:34:56,290
but hungry enough
so that your belly swells up?

501
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:58,699
I wouldn't care
how hungry I got.

502
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,236
I know I wouldn't eat
one of those camp dogs.

503
00:35:00,304 --> 00:35:04,138
You'd eat it. You'd fight
for the bones too.

504
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,904
Have you ever
eaten a dog, Mr. Russell?

505
00:35:06,977 --> 00:35:09,241
Eaten one
and lived like one.

506
00:35:09,313 --> 00:35:11,975
Dear me.

507
00:35:17,221 --> 00:35:19,155
Mr. Russell
obviously feels sympathy

508
00:35:19,223 --> 00:35:21,157
for the Indians' plight.

509
00:35:21,225 --> 00:35:24,160
If you're a humane man,
you do.

510
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:28,426
But you have to live on
a reservation like San Carlos

511
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:29,989
to see that caring for them

512
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:32,331
is not a simple matter
of giving them food and clothing.

513
00:35:32,403 --> 00:35:34,667
My name is Favor,
by the way.

514
00:35:34,738 --> 00:35:37,468
I happen to be
the Indian agent at San Carlos.

515
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:40,476
As the agent,
I see all the problems

516
00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:42,307
the Interior Department
is faced with...

517
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:45,314
natural resentment
on the part of the Indians,

518
00:35:45,382 --> 00:35:46,679
their distrust,

519
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,684
their reluctance to
cultivate the soil.

520
00:35:48,752 --> 00:35:51,152
They live where
they don't want to live.

521
00:35:51,221 --> 00:35:55,681
That too, which can't
be helped for the time being.

522
00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:59,251
Do you happen to know
someone at San Carlos?

523
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,628
Most of them.

524
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:06,295
- You've visited the agency?
- I lived there.

525
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,804
I don't think
I recognize you.

526
00:36:08,872 --> 00:36:10,806
Did you work for
one of the suppliers?

527
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:13,308
No. I worked
for the police.

528
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:16,612
But the police
are all Apache.

529
00:36:37,234 --> 00:36:38,667
Whoa.

530
00:36:40,037 --> 00:36:42,335
Delgado's station.

531
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:45,933
- Mendez!
- Well, who else?

532
00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:48,842
You can wash at the bench
near the kitchen door

533
00:36:48,912 --> 00:36:52,780
and follow the path around the back
for the other things.

534
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,511
- Still got horses?
- A few more days.

535
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:56,246
Then change them for these.

536
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,788
I thought you had closed down.

537
00:36:58,856 --> 00:37:00,380
That's a long story.

538
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:02,948
Get your woman
to make some coffee, eh?

539
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:10,029
Mr. Mendez.

540
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,625
I find myself
in an awkward situation.

541
00:37:12,703 --> 00:37:15,638
I'm going to have
to rely on your tact.

542
00:37:15,706 --> 00:37:18,470
You mean you have
a dirty job for me to do.

543
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:20,510
Giving as little
offense as possible

544
00:37:20,577 --> 00:37:23,205
arrange to have Mr. Russell
ride on top with you.

545
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,341
How do I offend the man
without offending him, Dr. Favor?

546
00:37:27,418 --> 00:37:29,147
My wife finds it disturbing

547
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:31,153
having him inside with us.

548
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:34,657
What is there about him
that bothers the lady?

549
00:37:34,725 --> 00:37:37,717
I'm sure you know
his history better than I do.

550
00:37:37,795 --> 00:37:39,660
I leave it in your hands.

551
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,992
And wash yours?

552
00:38:20,204 --> 00:38:21,637
It's for the dust...

553
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:23,639
or whatever reason
you want.

554
00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:44,584
Dr. Favor... says you shouldn't
ride in the coach.

555
00:38:48,232 --> 00:38:49,665
They all say that?

556
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:52,167
I don't know
what they all say,

557
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:54,170
but he's paying
for most of it.

558
00:38:54,238 --> 00:38:55,671
I don't think
he wants to argue.

559
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:57,001
What do you say?

560
00:38:57,074 --> 00:39:02,102
Well, I say,
why make people unhappy?

561
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:04,613
Let them do
what they want.

562
00:39:04,681 --> 00:39:06,478
It's not a big thing.
Why should we let it worry us?

563
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,110
What if I decide
to stay inside?

564
00:39:09,186 --> 00:39:13,623
A man could catch his death
of cold riding up on top.

565
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,783
Is that worth
arguing about,

566
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:18,123
making trouble, getting
people angry and upset?

567
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:20,356
Or is it easier
to forget it? Which?

568
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:28,600
If you ask...

569
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:32,233
why I lend myself
to this...

570
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,243
it's a habit...

571
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:37,473
a lifetime of it.

572
00:39:37,548 --> 00:39:39,948
I didn't ask.

573
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:42,943
Against the cold.

574
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,460
I want you
to hear this.

575
00:39:55,532 --> 00:39:57,500
I was just telling him

576
00:39:57,568 --> 00:40:00,332
that you're not the first
through here this afternoon.

577
00:40:00,404 --> 00:40:02,167
About an hour ago,
three men came by.

578
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,434
- Did you know them?
- Some riders.

579
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:06,476
- But did you know them?
- They may work around here.

580
00:40:06,543 --> 00:40:08,477
This station's
supposed to be closed.

581
00:40:08,545 --> 00:40:09,978
What were they
doing here?

582
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:12,140
It happens.
People pass by.

583
00:40:12,215 --> 00:40:14,979
What did they look like? Did they
say where they were going?

584
00:40:15,052 --> 00:40:17,043
If you think they
planned to hold us up,

585
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,487
they wouldn't know
a stage was coming by today.

586
00:40:20,557 --> 00:40:23,492
I want to go another way.
Is there one?

587
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,495
There's a road past
the old San Pete Mine.

588
00:40:26,563 --> 00:40:28,497
It hasn't been used in years.

589
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:31,864
It's wild and hard to travel over,
but it ends up in the same place.

590
00:40:31,935 --> 00:40:34,426
We'll take it.
We have women.

591
00:40:34,504 --> 00:40:38,338
Any possibility of being stopped,
we should take precautions.

592
00:40:38,408 --> 00:40:40,501
Start without delay,
if you please.

593
00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:46,010
Hyah!

594
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:49,519
Get up! Get up!

595
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:51,019
Hyah!

596
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:54,022
Hyah!

597
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:20,443
Smoke bother you?

598
00:41:22,422 --> 00:41:25,858
Would you put it out
if I said it did?

599
00:41:28,428 --> 00:41:30,089
Oh, yeah.

600
00:41:30,163 --> 00:41:34,361
My mama taught me
to remove my hat and my cigar

601
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:36,868
in the presence
of a lady.

602
00:41:36,937 --> 00:41:38,370
Whatever else I take off

603
00:41:38,438 --> 00:41:40,463
depends on
how lucky I get.

604
00:41:54,955 --> 00:41:57,549
Oh, it's stuffy in there.

605
00:41:57,624 --> 00:41:59,387
I noticed.

606
00:41:59,459 --> 00:42:03,327
Listen, I had nothing to do
with your getting thrown out.

607
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:04,830
All right.

608
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:07,332
Although, frankly,
it wouldn't bother me a bit

609
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:10,336
if you had to walk
all the way to Bisbee.

610
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:12,463
It wouldn't bother
me either, lady.

611
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,349
Get up there!

612
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,354
Get up now!

613
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,356
Get up! Get up!

614
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:32,358
Giddup! Yes!

615
00:42:32,426 --> 00:42:34,360
Giddup!

616
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,041
Ho!

617
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:02,987
All right,
everybody out!

618
00:43:05,058 --> 00:43:07,492
Billy, take care
of the horses

619
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:09,495
and get a water bag.

620
00:43:09,563 --> 00:43:11,497
Why have we made this stop?

621
00:43:11,565 --> 00:43:13,999
If you're thinking of us,
we're not tired.

622
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:16,501
No. I'm thinking
of the horses... and me.

623
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,003
I'm tired.

624
00:43:18,071 --> 00:43:20,301
We'll rest here
for a couple of hours.

625
00:43:20,374 --> 00:43:22,501
I have to get some sleep.

626
00:43:22,576 --> 00:43:25,010
If you're smart,
you'll do the same.

627
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:35,520
Hey, amigo.

628
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:40,525
This ain't the stage road.

629
00:43:40,594 --> 00:43:43,028
We took a different way.

630
00:43:43,096 --> 00:43:44,529
Different way?

631
00:43:44,598 --> 00:43:48,034
You just take any old road
you feel like?

632
00:43:48,101 --> 00:43:51,036
I think you'd better
talk to Dr. Favor.

633
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:53,038
No.
I'm talking to you.

634
00:43:57,611 --> 00:43:59,272
We all agreed.

635
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:01,473
You were asleep.

636
00:44:01,548 --> 00:44:05,450
I thought... he wants
to come with us so bad,

637
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,453
this will be all right.

638
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:08,749
Where's it go?

639
00:44:08,822 --> 00:44:10,289
Same place.

640
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:14,293
We'll be in Benson tomorrow
if the road is all right

641
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:15,794
and nothing happens.

642
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,295
What could happen?

643
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,825
You better stop
right there, lady,

644
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:57,330
or I'm going to know
all there is to know about you.

645
00:45:57,397 --> 00:46:00,161
Well, you could at least
have cleared your throat.

646
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:03,464
I couldn't.
My heart was in it.

647
00:46:03,537 --> 00:46:06,768
It's hot.
These are heavy.

648
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:10,275
So you've seen my legs.

649
00:46:10,343 --> 00:46:12,903
There are worse
walking around.

650
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,641
Some worse,
some better.

651
00:46:15,715 --> 00:46:19,776
Well, you're not going to
have much to do with them,

652
00:46:19,853 --> 00:46:21,787
so don't
let it worry you.

653
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:23,789
You're a pretty
thorny woman.

654
00:46:23,857 --> 00:46:26,291
Has anyone ever gotten
within range of you?

655
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:28,793
Not that it's
any of your business,

656
00:46:28,862 --> 00:46:30,796
but I was married once.

657
00:46:30,864 --> 00:46:34,300
Been a widow
since I was 19.

658
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:38,804
My husband was
a sweet Missouri boy.

659
00:46:38,872 --> 00:46:42,308
One night, they brought him home
on a kitchen door.

660
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:44,309
Been shot eight times.

661
00:46:44,377 --> 00:46:46,311
Seems there
had been an argument

662
00:46:46,379 --> 00:46:49,314
over the price
of a Mexican saddle.

663
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:53,284
He had a comic valentine
for me in his pocket.

664
00:46:53,353 --> 00:46:56,652
The dead are dead.
You ought to bury them.

665
00:46:58,391 --> 00:47:00,325
I'm sure
that's good advice.

666
00:47:00,393 --> 00:47:03,760
Trouble is, Mr. Russell,

667
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:08,267
I think you feel the same way
about the living.

668
00:47:27,821 --> 00:47:29,789
What do you want?

669
00:47:29,856 --> 00:47:32,290
I hope I'm not
bothering you,

670
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:34,691
but it's so hot,
I was just cooking.

671
00:47:36,263 --> 00:47:39,289
Whew. There's a nice little
breeze up here, though,

672
00:47:39,366 --> 00:47:41,129
isn't there?

673
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:43,761
Everybody's
gone to sleep.

674
00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:46,305
I can't sleep
when it gets this hot.

675
00:47:46,373 --> 00:47:47,704
I just wake up dizzy.

676
00:47:47,774 --> 00:47:50,299
That a fact?

677
00:47:53,713 --> 00:47:55,647
This place
sure is spooky,

678
00:47:55,715 --> 00:47:58,650
all those buildings
and nobody in them.

679
00:48:01,288 --> 00:48:04,780
You know, I'm awfully glad
you're along with us.

680
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:06,485
If anything happened,

681
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,993
it's nice to know
there's somebody along

682
00:48:09,062 --> 00:48:10,859
that could do
something about it.

683
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,296
That's what you think?

684
00:48:12,365 --> 00:48:15,027
I saw you back
at the station.

685
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:18,537
You frightened the life
out of everyone back there.

686
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:21,039
Did you like that,
little lady?

687
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:23,337
I like to see a man
act like a man.

688
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:27,039
I think that you should
have what you like.

689
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,274
Oh! Don't do this!

690
00:48:30,951 --> 00:48:32,543
You scared?

691
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:35,053
You never had it
like this, hmm?

692
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,555
You get hurt a little,
and then you...

693
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:42,561
get rubbed a little bit.

694
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:50,068
Ha ha ha!

695
00:48:51,771 --> 00:48:54,069
[Sobbing]

696
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:03,047
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm going to get my husband!

697
00:49:03,116 --> 00:49:05,243
So he can charge up that hill
and get his head blown off?

698
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:06,876
You let go of me!

699
00:49:06,953 --> 00:49:08,887
He's got to do something.
That man hurt me.

700
00:49:08,955 --> 00:49:12,721
You wagged your tail in his face to
get his attention, and you got it.

701
00:49:15,095 --> 00:49:17,529
You're disgusting,
you know that?

702
00:49:17,597 --> 00:49:20,225
You talk so dirty.

703
00:49:23,603 --> 00:49:26,538
Wipe your nose
and shut your mouth...

704
00:49:26,606 --> 00:49:28,039
and tell everyone

705
00:49:28,108 --> 00:49:30,042
you fell and skinned your knees

706
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:31,509
going to the public
convenience.

707
00:49:31,578 --> 00:49:33,546
Here. Mop up.

708
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:53,065
Hyah! Hyah!

709
00:49:54,634 --> 00:49:56,067
Hyah!

710
00:50:17,157 --> 00:50:21,093
We're missing a water bag.
We started with three.

711
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:24,096
I must have left it
behind at San Pete.

712
00:50:24,164 --> 00:50:25,597
Mendez will skin me.

713
00:50:25,665 --> 00:50:27,098
Right down
to the bone.

714
00:50:36,176 --> 00:50:38,610
[Doris Blake]
Oh, that's an awfully pretty kit.

715
00:50:38,678 --> 00:50:41,613
[Mrs. Favor]
Yes. It's made of Spanish leather.

716
00:50:41,681 --> 00:50:42,773
Geranium?

717
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:44,248
Jasmine.
Would you like some?

718
00:50:44,317 --> 00:50:45,614
It's cooling.

719
00:50:45,685 --> 00:50:49,121
Thank you. What does
a bottle like this cost?

720
00:50:49,189 --> 00:50:51,623
The best years
of your life.

721
00:50:51,691 --> 00:50:53,124
I like Dr. Favor.

722
00:50:53,193 --> 00:50:55,127
He has
such lovely manners.

723
00:50:55,195 --> 00:50:56,628
I was noticing his hands.

724
00:50:56,696 --> 00:50:59,130
He keeps his nails
so nice and clean.

725
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,100
He's very proud of his hands
and feet, they're so small.

726
00:51:02,168 --> 00:51:05,535
I, on the other hand, am proud
of his brain. It's very large.

727
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:06,936
He reads a lot, doesn't he?

728
00:51:07,006 --> 00:51:10,271
Far into the night,
which is just as well.

729
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:14,370
'Cause when he takes his trousers
off and folds them neatly

730
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:17,007
and hangs them over
the back of a chair,

731
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:21,577
that sharp, exciting intelligence
of his doesn't count for very much.

732
00:51:21,654 --> 00:51:24,088
All we're left with
is thin, spindly legs

733
00:51:24,157 --> 00:51:26,887
with those
little blue veins on them

734
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,394
and all the knots
and bumps.

735
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:31,589
A love match, huh?

736
00:51:31,664 --> 00:51:34,098
When I was 18
and a student of his

737
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:36,727
and I heard him read
Robert Browning.

738
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:41,604
But now I'm 35,
and I hear him cough up phlegm.

739
00:51:41,674 --> 00:51:43,608
They all make
those noises...

740
00:51:43,676 --> 00:51:46,110
bathroom noises
and bedroom noises.

741
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:49,615
Well, I suppose we've
all felt the same chill.

742
00:51:49,682 --> 00:51:51,616
Not me. I like men.

743
00:51:51,684 --> 00:51:55,120
They may have put
a little gray in my hair,

744
00:51:55,188 --> 00:51:57,622
but I keep coming
back for more,

745
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,624
so they must have
something.

746
00:51:59,692 --> 00:52:01,091
[Russell]
Hear, hear.

747
00:52:09,135 --> 00:52:11,069
[Mendez Barking Orders
At Horses]

748
00:52:34,661 --> 00:52:36,094
Whoa!

749
00:52:37,664 --> 00:52:41,725
Everybody take a nice walk
to the top of the grade.

750
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:56,114
Hyah!

751
00:53:27,647 --> 00:53:31,083
Well, I'm getting tired
of this trip.

752
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:32,583
I want a bath.

753
00:53:32,652 --> 00:53:35,086
I want to sleep
12 hours.

754
00:53:35,154 --> 00:53:38,089
I want a big, rare steak.

755
00:53:39,659 --> 00:53:41,092
And then what?

756
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,095
I don't know.
I never know what's next.

757
00:53:44,163 --> 00:53:48,099
Whatever it is, I'm going
to have to scratch for it.

758
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:49,600
That I do know.

759
00:53:49,669 --> 00:53:53,503
Wish I could find a rich old man
and give it a rest for a while.

760
00:53:53,573 --> 00:53:57,600
- Where? Out to pasture?
- Mm-hmm. I'm ready.

761
00:53:57,677 --> 00:54:01,113
Let someone else
work up a sweat for a change.

762
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:04,547
Let someone else
put the meat on the table.

763
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:08,045
Glad to buy you dinner.

764
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:10,055
Mmm. There's
a lot of men

765
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:12,557
who will do that,
Mr. Russell.

766
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:15,560
Well, I'd just as soon
make it breakfast.

767
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:17,061
No, thanks.

768
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:21,066
I just take coffee in the morning...
nothing with it.

769
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:43,588
You know, we liked
not to have made it.

770
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,090
I figured you had
some catching up to do.

771
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:48,593
When you didn't come
by the main road,

772
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:50,094
we went back
to Delgado's.

773
00:54:50,163 --> 00:54:52,097
He told us you'd
come this other way.

774
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:54,656
He didn't want
to tell us, but he told.

775
00:54:54,734 --> 00:54:57,100
I tell you,
we done some riding.

776
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,070
Well, look who
we have here.

777
00:54:59,138 --> 00:55:01,629
Hello, Jessie.

778
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:03,869
Feeling ornery,
Frank?

779
00:55:03,943 --> 00:55:06,411
Let's not start
asking questions.

780
00:55:06,479 --> 00:55:09,971
Just one...
what are you doing here?

781
00:55:10,049 --> 00:55:12,176
Going bad, honey.

782
00:55:12,251 --> 00:55:15,448
All right.
Break out that luggage.

783
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:18,046
Doc Favor's pretending
he don't see us.

784
00:55:18,124 --> 00:55:20,558
Things kind of
close in on you,

00:55:20,626 --> 00:55:22,560
don't they, Doctor?

786
00:55:22,628 --> 00:55:25,563
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

787
00:55:25,631 --> 00:55:28,065
My wife and I
are going to Bisbee

788
00:55:28,134 --> 00:55:29,567
to settle some affairs.

789
00:55:29,635 --> 00:55:31,466
We'll be there
two days at most.

790
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,562
That's not where
you're going.

791
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:36,972
You're going to
hole up in Mexico,

792
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:40,069
or you're going
to get on a boat in Veracruz

793
00:55:40,146 --> 00:55:41,272
and head out.

794
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:43,281
Hey, Lamar,
you know something.

795
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:46,079
He ought to be
over here with a gun.

796
00:55:46,152 --> 00:55:49,588
He don't need a gun
to pull off a robbery.

797
00:55:49,655 --> 00:55:51,646
He does it
with pen and ink.

798
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:54,591
- No.
- Yeah.

799
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,118
He just claims a higher
beef tally than what comes in.

800
00:55:58,197 --> 00:56:02,031
Then he pays the trail driver off
for what's delivered,

801
00:56:02,101 --> 00:56:05,764
charges the government for meat
that ain't even there,

802
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:07,863
and then pockets
the difference.

803
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,373
Ain't that right, Doctor?

804
00:56:09,442 --> 00:56:11,774
The Indians go hungry,
but you don't.

805
00:56:11,844 --> 00:56:15,541
All right.
Let's get to it.

806
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:38,069
What about
up in the boot?

807
00:56:38,137 --> 00:56:39,570
A shotgun.

808
00:56:41,641 --> 00:56:44,075
Do you think this
is worth your while?

809
00:56:44,143 --> 00:56:47,196
You won't be able to
show your face again.

810
00:56:48,263 --> 00:56:49,958
I purely appreciate that,

811
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:55,629
but don't give me
no more advice, please.

812
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,899
I'll bet you're dead
or arrested in two weeks.

813
00:56:57,973 --> 00:57:00,066
You ain't gonna have
nothing to bet with.

814
00:57:00,142 --> 00:57:03,305
- There are witnesses.
- I don't see no witnesses.

815
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:05,313
Lamar, you see
any witnesses?

816
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:06,973
No. Not here.

817
00:57:10,386 --> 00:57:13,822
That man don't look
like no witness.

818
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,754
Hey, mister!

819
00:57:15,824 --> 00:57:18,315
Are you a witness?

820
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:24,263
I've seen you someplace.

821
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:27,968
That bothers me.

822
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:31,202
Come on, mister.

823
00:57:31,273 --> 00:57:33,503
Help me out.
Where was it?

824
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,837
Cicero!

825
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:38,345
Well, now,
lookee here.

826
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:40,348
How much did you steal?

827
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:42,350
Tell us so we don't
have to count it.

828
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:44,249
He figures he's helped enough
without giving us the tally.

829
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,254
- About 12,000, I figure.
- Somewhere around there.

830
00:57:47,322 --> 00:57:48,289
Get it loaded.

831
00:57:48,357 --> 00:57:50,382
Looks like you did good,
and we did better.

832
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:52,927
Boy, get up there.
Throw those two saddles down.

833
00:57:52,995 --> 00:57:57,295
Amigo, you and you,
saddle them two horses.

834
00:58:05,374 --> 00:58:08,810
I figured you'd
ride along with us a way.

835
00:58:10,379 --> 00:58:12,313
I'd better not.

836
00:58:12,381 --> 00:58:14,315
You'll be all right.

837
00:58:14,383 --> 00:58:17,318
I'll be all right here.

838
00:58:19,388 --> 00:58:20,980
You're coming.

839
00:58:21,056 --> 00:58:24,025
One way or the other,
you're coming.

840
00:58:50,352 --> 00:58:52,786
Friend, I'll thank you
for the buggy ride,

841
00:58:52,855 --> 00:58:55,221
and we'll do it again
some time.

842
00:59:05,868 --> 00:59:08,302
Hyah! Hyah!

843
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:09,860
Hyah!

[Closes Shotgun]

845
00:59:25,888 --> 00:59:28,618
Kid, get down.

846
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,816
What?

847
00:59:29,892 --> 00:59:31,826
Just get down
from there.

848
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,731
Hey, Braden.

849
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:41,325
Hold up a minute.

850
00:59:41,403 --> 00:59:43,337
I forgot
a little something.

851
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:48,775
What are you
doing up there?

852
00:59:48,844 --> 00:59:50,277
Getting my things.

853
00:59:50,345 --> 00:59:52,279
You figure
you're going someplace?

854
00:59:52,347 --> 00:59:54,281
Why stay here?

855
00:59:54,349 --> 00:59:55,782
Just how far

856
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:58,513
do you think
you're going to get?

857
00:59:58,587 --> 01:00:00,612
That's to find out.

858
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:11,856
Now, how far did you say
you're going to get?

859
01:00:11,934 --> 01:00:14,164
Leave us some water!

860
01:00:25,047 --> 01:00:26,878
Now how far?

861
01:00:38,393 --> 01:00:41,294
Oh, about as far
as Delgado's.

862
01:00:45,901 --> 01:00:47,596
What does that mean?

863
01:00:47,669 --> 01:00:49,762
Maybe if
we all get thirsty,

864
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:52,773
we'll go to Delgado's
and get some mescal.

865
01:01:31,413 --> 01:01:34,814
Jessie, do you want me
to do something about Braden?

866
01:01:36,385 --> 01:01:38,785
There's nothing
to be done about him.

867
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:55,496
Russell!

868
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:00,107
Russell,
where are you going?

869
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,273
Russell!
Wait for us!

870
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:04,778
Russell!

871
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,939
Russell, wait!

[Coughing]

873
01:03:15,851 --> 01:03:17,944
Why didn't you
wait for us?

874
01:03:18,019 --> 01:03:20,647
What did you want me
to wait for?

875
01:03:20,722 --> 01:03:23,316
Look, we want to
get out of here

876
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,655
before they come after us.

877
01:03:27,395 --> 01:03:28,987
Is there something
stopping you?

878
01:03:29,064 --> 01:03:31,999
Man, what is
the matter with you?

879
01:03:32,067 --> 01:03:34,535
This isn't happening to one person.
It's happening to everyone.

880
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:36,833
And you want me
to show you the way?

881
01:03:36,905 --> 01:03:40,864
Sure.
You show us the way, we follow,

882
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,173
but we are
all together.

883
01:03:44,246 --> 01:03:45,338
Together, huh?

884
01:03:45,413 --> 01:03:49,281
I flatter myself
that I understand Mr. Russell.

885
01:03:49,351 --> 01:03:51,285
We affronted his dignity...

886
01:03:51,353 --> 01:03:54,322
a very necessary thing
to a man.

887
01:03:54,389 --> 01:03:57,290
We asked him
not to ride with us.

888
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,020
Now he's telling us
we can't walk with him.

889
01:03:59,094 --> 01:04:00,493
Isn't that right, Mr. Russell?

890
01:04:00,562 --> 01:04:03,588
Maybe we don't walk
the way you walk.

891
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:06,327
Fair, but harsh.

892
01:04:06,401 --> 01:04:09,802
But for all that, you're no longer
in a hurry, are you?

893
01:04:09,871 --> 01:04:11,304
No. I'm in no hurry.

894
01:04:11,373 --> 01:04:13,807
If you want
to go on, go on.

895
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,399
Leave the saddlebags
and the gun.

896
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:17,809
I thought
we'd get to that.

897
01:04:17,879 --> 01:04:19,813
You forgot something,
didn't you?

898
01:04:19,881 --> 01:04:21,109
Money.

899
01:04:21,183 --> 01:04:24,812
An odd oversight for a man
who thinks of everything.

900
01:04:24,886 --> 01:04:27,354
I was a little busy
back there.

901
01:04:27,422 --> 01:04:29,856
He's thinking, "Why not
take my money out here?"

902
01:04:29,925 --> 01:04:31,517
No law to stop him.

903
01:04:31,593 --> 01:04:34,027
Your money?

904
01:04:34,095 --> 01:04:38,293
You starved a bunch of Indians to
death at San Carlos for that money,

905
01:04:38,366 --> 01:04:40,334
and now you're trying to get
your sticky fingers on it,

906
01:04:40,402 --> 01:04:42,461
and meanwhile Grimes is
getting the time he needs.

907
01:04:42,537 --> 01:04:45,506
Enough of this.
We have to move.

908
01:04:45,574 --> 01:04:47,269
Why move?

909
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:49,776
Why not wait here for him,

910
01:04:49,845 --> 01:04:51,506
maybe finish it?

911
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:52,774
Finish it?

912
01:04:52,848 --> 01:04:54,679
You mean kill him?

913
01:04:54,749 --> 01:04:56,910
They get close enough,
they're gonna kill you.

914
01:04:56,985 --> 01:05:00,148
They didn't hurt anybody before.
Why would they wanna hurt us now?

915
01:05:00,222 --> 01:05:02,782
They'll be running out of water.
You wanna give them yours?

916
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:04,792
- No.
- They'll kill you for it.

917
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,795
And if we don't
finish it, what then?

918
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:10,297
You got
no say in this.

919
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:13,300
Now, you can go on
or stay, whichever.

920
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:16,565
Either way, you leave the saddlebags
here. The belly gun too.

921
01:05:16,638 --> 01:05:20,472
You're not a figure to command
too much confidence, Mr. Russell.

922
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,874
What if everyone
decides against you?

923
01:05:22,944 --> 01:05:25,913
Then they've got you
to show them the way home.

924
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:36,323
It's the frying pan
or the fire,

925
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:37,824
as far as I'm concerned.

926
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:39,986
At least Russell
knows the way.

927
01:05:56,011 --> 01:05:57,979
All right.
Everybody, stay put.

928
01:06:04,853 --> 01:06:07,788
You got one thing
to do, kid...

929
01:06:07,856 --> 01:06:08,948
watch him.

930
01:06:09,024 --> 01:06:11,288
He can leave until
the time they come.

931
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:12,849
After that, no.

932
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:15,795
If he tries to leave
with nothing,

933
01:06:15,864 --> 01:06:17,297
shoot him once.

934
01:06:17,365 --> 01:06:20,300
If he takes the money,
shoot him twice.

935
01:06:20,368 --> 01:06:23,565
If he picks up the water,
you empty your gun. Understand?

936
01:06:23,638 --> 01:06:26,163
I don't understand
anything about this mess.

937
01:06:27,876 --> 01:06:30,310
Mendez, you think
you can do this?

938
01:06:33,381 --> 01:06:34,609
That's right.

939
01:06:48,897 --> 01:06:49,989
Right there.

940
01:06:56,404 --> 01:06:59,339
First, a shotgun
when they're close...

941
01:06:59,407 --> 01:07:02,843
and I mean so close
you can touch them...

942
01:07:02,911 --> 01:07:05,345
and then this
if you need it.

943
01:07:05,413 --> 01:07:06,846
I'll be over there.

944
01:07:06,915 --> 01:07:07,847
Where?

945
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:09,008
Right there.

946
01:07:09,084 --> 01:07:12,019
If one of us
doesn't get a good shot,

947
01:07:12,087 --> 01:07:13,611
the other
probably will.

948
01:07:13,688 --> 01:07:15,588
Hit something, Mendez...

949
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:19,093
first the men,
then the horses.

950
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,593
I don't know.

951
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:24,063
Just to sit here
and wait to kill them?

952
01:07:24,132 --> 01:07:26,100
If there was some
other way, we'd do it.

Maybe we can
outrun them.

954
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:34,071
If you run, they're going to catch
you. They're going to kill you.

more than you believe anything.

All right.

And try not to puke.

I am going to
give you back this bullet.

Tonight, Mendez,
not while the sun is out.

Look, amigo,
how close you come.

I tried to do better.
I think you moved.

You can be sure I move.

You could,

982
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:25,845
but first I have to talk
to this other...

983
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,182

his wife,

You out of water, huh?

992
01:14:44,672 --> 01:14:49,632
Ah, this Grimes,
he never bring canteen,

993
01:14:49,711 --> 01:14:51,144
only whiskey.

994
01:14:51,212 --> 01:14:54,648
He think it is
going to be easy.

995
01:14:54,716 --> 01:14:57,651
It's going to get harder.

996
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:00,654
Not if this Favor
give us the money.

997
01:15:00,722 --> 01:15:02,155
He hasn't got it.

998
01:15:02,223 --> 01:15:04,487
He gave it to me.

01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:08,654
Ohh!

All right.
We trade with you then.

You give us the money,

1004

or we shoot the woman.

1005

All right. Shoot her.

little soft woman?

You don't care
we shoot her?

She's nothing to me.

How about the others?
What do they say?

an eyelash,

how you feel about us.

Then will you tell me why
we keep trotting after you?

1023

Because I can cut it, lady.

If we cross in daylight,

they'll ride us down

Then we leave
when it's dark.

Can we have
some water now?

Do you object
to our eating?

The biscuits,
not the beef.

the next morning.

And then home.

1037

It doesn't seem so far
when you look ahead.

1038
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:12,375
The trouble is you have to
keep looking back.

1039
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:17,884
Don't let that
get away from you.

1040

It took more nerve

to lie there
waiting for them.

Well, he shouldn't have
made me do it.

You didn't have to,
you know.

Listen, he makes sense,
whether you agree with him or not.

He makes sense, even if it kills
you... that's what you're saying.

1049
01:19:21,449 --> 01:19:24,384
It's just I never
shot at a man before.

1050
01:19:24,452 --> 01:19:28,388
- That's not an easy thing.
- I know, but it seems easy to him.

1051
01:19:28,456 --> 01:19:31,550
If he can kill two people,
he can kill five.

1052
01:19:31,626 --> 01:19:33,560
- For what reason?
- My money.

1053
01:19:33,628 --> 01:19:37,462
No. I know him
better than that.

1054

Where money
is concerned,

1055
01:19:39,467 --> 01:19:42,197
I'm afraid
you don't know anyone.

you can carry all that?

put down that gun.

you're going to be dead.

You might make it.

been something

What does that mean?

1113
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:45,364
I don't know.
A signal, maybe.

1114
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:46,872
Maybe they found Favor.

1115
01:24:46,941 --> 01:24:48,806
Yeah, maybe that, too.

1116
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:12,247
We'll hole up
in that shack on top

1117
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:13,748
while it's daylight

1118
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:15,751
and hope
they pass us by.

1119
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:17,252
Why stop now?

1120
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,754
If we keep going,
we get home.

1121
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:21,256
Oh, man,
we're so close.

1122
01:25:21,324 --> 01:25:22,757
So are they.

1123
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:45,110
There's blood
in my shoe.

1124
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:50,183
You always bought them
a size too small.

1125
01:26:28,992 --> 01:26:31,256
Dr. Favor!

1126
01:26:33,763 --> 01:26:35,993
It's Dr. Favor!

1127
01:26:57,053 --> 01:27:00,022
He doesn't remember
we left water behind.

1128
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,149
We have to tell him.

1129
01:27:02,225 --> 01:27:03,692
You don't do anything.

1130
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,524
What do you mean
we don't do anything?

1131
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:10,032
Take a look at him.
He's dying of thirst.

1132
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,034
What did you think
would happen?

1133
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:14,536
You just thought you'd
never see him again,

1134
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:17,038
so yesterday,
it was all right, huh?

1135
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:19,541
No. I should have
said something yesterday.

1136
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:21,042
I'm saying it now.

1137
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:22,339
Lady.

1138
01:27:22,412 --> 01:27:24,710
They could be
anywhere out there.

1139
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:26,214
Don't press our luck.

1140
01:27:31,855 --> 01:27:33,914
Dr. Favor!

1141
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:37,358
Dr. Favor!

1142
01:27:41,164 --> 01:27:43,997
We left water behind
in the mine shaft!

1143
01:27:46,836 --> 01:27:49,361
In the mine shaft!

1144
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:10,519
You will learn something
about white people...

1145
01:29:10,587 --> 01:29:13,055

1146
01:29:13,123 --> 01:29:15,353
They better.

[Sigh]

1148
01:29:40,116 --> 01:29:43,051
Well, I reckon
I will just take me

1149
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:46,054
a little hike up that hill
and parley.

1150
01:29:46,122 --> 01:29:49,353
Any message you want
to send your husband?

1151
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:52,519
Tell him I'm being
well looked after.

1152
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:56,326
That's real wifely.

1153
01:29:59,602 --> 01:30:00,967
Hey!

1154
01:30:01,037 --> 01:30:03,369
I'm coming up to talk.

1155
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:05,703
Y'all hold your fire.

1156
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:21,056
Wait a minute. Wait!

1157
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:22,557
He wants to talk.

1158
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,559
That's no trick.

1159
01:30:24,627 --> 01:30:27,562
Let's hear
what he has to say.

1160
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,072
You don't know
what he wants.

1161
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,074
You have to find out
what he wants.

1162
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:43,738
- Doesn't that make sense to you?
- All right.

1163
01:30:52,589 --> 01:30:55,683
- Anybody home?
- We can hear you.

1164
01:30:55,758 --> 01:30:58,522
Come on out.
We'll talk some.

1165
01:30:58,595 --> 01:31:00,529
You say what you want.

1166
01:31:00,597 --> 01:31:03,464
How'd you like
to go home?

1167
01:31:05,435 --> 01:31:06,527
What else?

1168
01:31:06,603 --> 01:31:08,662
It's looking at you.

1169
01:31:08,738 --> 01:31:12,538
See, we can stay here
just as long as we please.

1170
01:31:12,609 --> 01:31:15,544
I can send a man
for more water and chuck,

1171
01:31:15,612 --> 01:31:17,546
but you people
can't move around.

1172
01:31:17,614 --> 01:31:21,050
You can't move
unless I let you, right?

1173
01:31:21,117 --> 01:31:22,812
What's your offer?

1174
01:31:22,886 --> 01:31:26,219
You leave the money,
we leave the woman.

1175
01:31:26,289 --> 01:31:28,621
We have to
talk about that.

1176
01:31:28,691 --> 01:31:30,056
You do that.

1177
01:31:30,126 --> 01:31:33,562
We'll let you look at the woman
while you're talking.

1178
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:35,063
That may help.

1179
01:31:35,131 --> 01:31:37,065
When you're ready,
bring the money down,

1180
01:31:37,133 --> 01:31:38,566
and you take her.

1181
01:31:38,635 --> 01:31:40,068
Suppose...

1182
01:31:40,136 --> 01:31:42,627
Well, suppose nobody
wants this woman.

1183
01:31:45,141 --> 01:31:46,574
That's all right,

1184
01:31:46,643 --> 01:31:49,510
but you ain't leavin' here
with the money,

1185
01:31:49,579 --> 01:31:52,514
and that's the main thing
you think about.

1186
01:31:52,582 --> 01:31:56,018
- Hey. I got a question.
- What's that?

1187
01:31:56,085 --> 01:31:58,553
How you going to
get down that hill?

1188
01:31:58,621 --> 01:32:01,522
Now, you hold on.

1189
01:32:01,591 --> 01:32:06,028
I'm going down this hill
the same way I come up it.

1190
01:32:06,095 --> 01:32:08,325
You hear me?
Now, you just hold on.

1191
01:32:08,398 --> 01:32:10,093

Where's he going?

1198
01:33:19,102 --> 01:33:22,037
Up behind us
to close the back door.

1199
01:33:23,606 --> 01:33:25,540
How do we get out?

1200
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,693
Hey, hombre!

01:34:28,604 --> 01:34:31,334
How would you like that woman?

If you want
that woman, hombre,

you better hurry,

We have to
give them that money.

01:35:42,979 --> 01:35:44,913
I think you know that.

1220
01:35:44,981 --> 01:35:47,415
Like you had to give
that one water, huh?

1221

go ahead.

01:35:59,428 --> 01:36:02,864
No. What I want to know
is why you helped.

1229
01:36:02,932 --> 01:36:04,365

just like that woman needs it.

1231

It's not up to us to decide

1232
01:36:09,438 --> 01:36:11,998
whether she deserves
to live or not.

1233
01:36:12,074 --> 01:36:13,871
We only help, huh?

1234

Do we have
another choice?

1235
01:36:16,445 --> 01:36:17,810
Not help.

1236
01:36:19,949 --> 01:36:21,644
Just let her die?

01:36:21,717 --> 01:36:23,708
That's up to Grimes.

1238
01:36:25,955 --> 01:36:28,219
You mean,
you'd sacrifice her life

1239
01:36:28,291 --> 01:36:29,815
for that money?

1240
01:36:29,892 --> 01:36:31,382
Is that
what you're saying?

1241
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:32,893
You go down there,

1242
01:36:32,962 --> 01:36:36,398
and you ask that lady
what she thinks of life.

1243
01:36:36,465 --> 01:36:38,558
Ask her what life is worth
to those Indians in San Carlos

1244
01:36:38,634 --> 01:36:40,124
when they run out of meat.

1245
01:36:40,203 --> 01:36:43,036
But she didn't
take the money. Favor did.

1246
01:36:43,105 --> 01:36:46,905
She said, "Those
dirty Indians eat dog,"

1247
01:36:46,976 --> 01:36:48,910
that she couldn't eat dog
no matter how hungry she got.

1248
01:36:48,978 --> 01:36:50,843
Ask her if she'd eat dog now.

1249

I don't know what your gripe is
against the world.

to spread their blankets.

1256

Now, you call the men who did that
Christians, and you trust them.

[Crying]

1274
01:38:14,964 --> 01:38:19,424
Alex, please!
Please help me!

1275
01:38:19,502 --> 01:38:22,618
Alex! Alex!

1276
01:38:25,087 --> 01:38:26,850
God sees this,

1277
01:38:26,922 --> 01:38:31,359
and if we live,
we must live in fear of him.

1278
01:38:33,429 --> 01:38:35,863
At least that's what
they frightened me with

1279
01:38:35,931 --> 01:38:37,364
when I was a child.

1280
01:38:37,433 --> 01:38:39,367
Don't be frightened,
Mr. Mendez.

1281
01:38:39,435 --> 01:38:41,369
There is no God.

1282
01:38:41,437 --> 01:38:43,871
Not in either of us, perhaps.

1283
01:38:43,939 --> 01:38:45,133
Not anywhere.

1284
01:38:45,207 --> 01:38:47,869
Nothing, Dr. Favor?

1285
01:38:47,943 --> 01:38:49,308
Nothing.

1286
01:38:49,378 --> 01:38:50,811
You're sure?

1287
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,814
No reward in heaven?

1288
01:38:52,882 --> 01:38:55,316
Why lie to ourselves?

1289
01:38:55,384 --> 01:38:56,817
Well, hell, then?

1290
01:38:56,886 --> 01:38:59,821
A little bit of hell, maybe?

1291
01:38:59,889 --> 01:39:01,823
Ah, yes.

1292
01:39:01,891 --> 01:39:03,756
There's hell.

1293
01:39:07,897 --> 01:39:09,330
[Audra Faintly]
Alex?

1294
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,334
Alex?

1295
01:39:17,406 --> 01:39:18,839
Alex?

1296
01:39:21,477 --> 01:39:22,842
Alex?

1297
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,347
Alex?

1298
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:29,850
Alex?

1299
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:33,081
Alex?

1300
01:39:34,423 --> 01:39:35,856
Alex?

1301
01:39:38,928 --> 01:39:40,862
Alex?

1302
01:39:42,431 --> 01:39:44,831
Alex?

1303
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:46,367
Alex?

1304
01:39:46,435 --> 01:39:49,302
[Doris]
By dark, she'll be dead.

1305
01:39:51,874 --> 01:39:54,672
Isn't somebody
going to do something?

1306
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:05,982
All right.

1307
01:40:06,055 --> 01:40:08,717
Somebody want
to go down there, go ahead.

1308
01:40:08,791 --> 01:40:11,988
Just one thing...

1309
01:40:12,061 --> 01:40:14,359
You walk down there,
you're not going to walk back.

1310
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:17,763
You leave the bag and start up with the
woman, they're gonna kill both of you.

1311
01:40:17,833 --> 01:40:21,064
You're saying that so nobody
will take the money and try.

1312
01:40:21,136 --> 01:40:23,832
They'll kill both of you.

1313
01:40:23,906 --> 01:40:25,840
That's why I'm saying it.

1314
01:40:25,908 --> 01:40:27,842
That's your wife down there.

1315
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:29,969
You going to cut her loose?

1316
01:40:34,416 --> 01:40:36,680
Mendez, you going to save her?

1317
01:40:44,927 --> 01:40:47,361
Billy Lee What's-your-last-name,

1318
01:40:47,429 --> 01:40:49,795
you going to go down there?

1319
01:40:49,865 --> 01:40:51,298
This one won't.

1320
01:40:51,367 --> 01:40:53,130
That's his woman,
but he won't do it.

1321
01:40:53,202 --> 01:40:54,965
He doesn't care enough
about his own woman,

1322
01:40:55,037 --> 01:40:56,905
but maybe somebody else does.

1323
01:40:56,905 --> 01:40:57,894
But maybe somebody else does.

1324
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:01,706
All right. You, lady.

1325
01:41:01,777 --> 01:41:04,803
You worry about his wife
more than he does.

1326
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,313
Go on down there,

1327
01:41:06,382 --> 01:41:09,818
cut her loose, start back up again,
get shot in the back...

1328
01:41:09,885 --> 01:41:11,944
or in front, if the Mexican
by the trough does it.

1329
01:41:12,021 --> 01:41:14,888
In the back or in the front,
one way or the other.

1330
01:41:29,405 --> 01:41:31,339
Just give me your knife.

1331
01:41:31,407 --> 01:41:33,705
That's all I want from you.

1332
01:41:36,912 --> 01:41:40,348
You want a lot more
than that from me, lady.

1333
01:42:20,622 --> 01:42:22,317
All right.
Kid, come here.

1334
01:42:29,798 --> 01:42:32,232
I'm not looking
to get myself killed,

1335
01:42:32,301 --> 01:42:33,734
so pay attention.

1336
01:42:33,802 --> 01:42:36,236
You know how
to use this?

1337
01:42:36,305 --> 01:42:37,738
I guess so.

1338
01:42:37,806 --> 01:42:40,240
Ejects and loads.
It's ready now.

1339
01:42:40,309 --> 01:42:41,742
There's one in there,

1340
01:42:41,810 --> 01:42:44,745
and I hope
you only need the one.

1341
01:42:44,813 --> 01:42:46,576
Watch the Mexican.

1342
01:42:49,618 --> 01:42:51,552
After I go past him,

1343
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:54,054
he'll come out
with his back to you.

1344
01:42:54,123 --> 01:42:56,387
If he touches his gun,
shoot him.

1345
01:42:56,458 --> 01:42:57,823
In the back?

1346
01:42:57,893 --> 01:43:00,555
I'll ask him
to turn around.

1347
01:43:02,131 --> 01:43:04,065
There's something else...
the money.

1348
01:43:04,133 --> 01:43:05,566
What about it?

1349
01:43:05,634 --> 01:43:09,570
Maybe it's you who will have to
take it up to San Carlos after,

1350
01:43:09,638 --> 01:43:11,572
but that's easy, huh?

1351
01:43:17,646 --> 01:43:20,080
I thought you were
keeping it for yourself.

1352
01:43:20,149 --> 01:43:22,083
Think what
you want to think.

1353
01:43:22,151 --> 01:43:23,778
That's up to you.

1354
01:43:23,852 --> 01:43:26,320
All of us thought so.

1355
01:43:26,388 --> 01:43:29,084
It belongs to those
people up there.

1356
01:43:29,158 --> 01:43:31,092
I grew up
on their land.

1357
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:33,094
I hunted
every foot of it.

1358
01:43:33,162 --> 01:43:35,255
Maybe you take
the money back

1359
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:36,763
I owe it.

1360
01:43:38,667 --> 01:43:40,601
I'll see it gets back.

1361
01:43:40,669 --> 01:43:44,435
Tell them to cut you out
a plain ten-dollar horse

1362
01:43:44,506 --> 01:43:45,973
by way of thanks.

1363
01:43:54,616 --> 01:43:57,050
All that trouble
you went to, huh?

1364
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:01,384
It's a shock to grow old,
Mr. Russell.

1365
01:44:12,134 --> 01:44:13,226
Hey!

1366
01:44:14,803 --> 01:44:17,567
Got something for you.

1367
01:46:06,615 --> 01:46:10,551
Mister, you got
a lot of hard bark on you,

1368
01:46:10,619 --> 01:46:12,644
walking down here
like this.

1369
01:46:32,407 --> 01:46:33,840
Now I owe you.

1370
01:46:33,909 --> 01:46:36,503
You put two holes in me.

1371
01:46:36,578 --> 01:46:39,342
That's usually enough
for most of them.

1372
01:46:39,414 --> 01:46:40,847
Don't try it again.

1373
01:46:40,916 --> 01:46:43,885
That vaquero is more
than a fair hand.

1374
01:46:43,952 --> 01:46:46,182
You got the money?

1375
01:46:46,254 --> 01:46:49,280
Unless I brought
my dirty laundry by mistake.

1376
01:46:49,358 --> 01:46:51,326
Let me see it.

1377
01:46:51,393 --> 01:46:52,860
You look for yourself.

1378
01:47:00,869 --> 01:47:02,734
Come on. Hurry up.

1379
01:47:20,288 --> 01:47:22,722
Oh,
get out of the way.

1380
01:47:22,791 --> 01:47:24,418
Please get out of the way.

1381
01:47:28,964 --> 01:47:31,899
Well, now.

1382
01:47:31,967 --> 01:47:36,404
What do you suppose hell
is going to look like?

1383
01:47:36,471 --> 01:47:39,907
We all die. It's just
a question of when.

1384
01:48:38,467 --> 01:48:40,492
Mr. Mendez?

1385
01:48:40,569 --> 01:48:42,230
This one's still alive.

1386
01:49:10,932 --> 01:49:16,529
I would like at least
to know his name.

1387
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:20,874
He was called
John Russell.
