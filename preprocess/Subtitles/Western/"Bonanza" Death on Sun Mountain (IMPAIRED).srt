1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,734
(cattle lowing)

2
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:28,767
ADAM:
Look over there.

3
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,767
BEN:
So that's what's been
happening to our cattle.

4
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:04,734
It is as I have promised,
O, Winnemucca.

5
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:06,934
The cattle are in
the small canyon.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,067
Your people are grateful.

7
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,067
Take them quickly.
If the Cartwrights come...

8
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,434
BEN:
The Cartwrights
are here.

9
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,701
You know what happens
to cattle thieves.

10
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:21,868
Shoot, Ben Cartwright!
Shoot!

11
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:27,200
(theme song playing)

12
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,767
Tukwa, I trusted you.

13
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:18,133
I gave you a good life
on the Ponderosa.

14
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,067
Do you repay me by
stealing my cattle?

15
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,601
Do not blame my brother.

16
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:24,467
He but did the word
of his chief.

17
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:27,000
How long have the Paiutes
been cattle thieves?

18
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:30,968
Since the Washoe antelope
and deer are gone.

19
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:35,000
Since thepinon tree burns in
the fires of Sun Mountain.

20
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,567
Since our women and our children
and our braves sit hungry

21
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:40,000
in our tents, and
sicken without food.

22
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:44,133
What say you, Winnemucca?

23
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,367
The Washoe antelope herds
have fed the Paiute

24
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,734
since the long-ago dream time.

25
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:51,334
The diggers of Sun
Mountain eat antelope,

26
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,901
while the pots of
the Paiute are empty.

27
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:58,000
They are but three head, the
weakest of the Ponderosa herd.

28
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,200
Tukwa cannot see
his people starve.

29
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,267
What's the matter
with you, Tukwa?

30
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:04,767
Would the Cartwrights
let the Paiute starve?

31
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:05,934
Why didn't you ask us.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,934
The Paiute is a man.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,934
He does not beg.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,501
Even now, Winnemucca
is called woman

35
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,734
by my young men around
the council fires.

36
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:18,834
Winnemucca is
no woman.

37
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:20,801
He thinks
of his people.

38
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,200
The ways of peace
are good ways,

39
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:26,367
but because the
Paiute loves peace

40
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:28,200
does not mean he
cannot make war.

41
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:32,267
War brings nothing but wailing
in tents and lodges, Winnemucca.

42
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:33,934
For the Paiute and
for the white man.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,601
You and I understand
these things.

44
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:40,000
Does Ben Cartwright disregard
the voices of his sons?

45
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:43,567
Even so, Winnemucca hears
the words of his young men.

46
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:45,100
They speak for war.

47
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:48,067
They see as I see

48
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,400
that the Paiute walks
the same trail

49
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:51,634
as the antelope,

50
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,467
and the antelope is dead.

51
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,734
The men who dig
in the earth

52
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,701
are new to Washoe,
Winnemucca.

53
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:00,701
They do not know
the ways of the land.

54
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:02,801
My sons and I, we will
ride to them

55
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:03,834
and make them understand.

56
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:05,267
They will listen.

57
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:07,534
The Cartwrights
and the Paiutes

58
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,300
have long walked
the earth together,

59
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:13,000
but if there is war,
Ben Cartwright,

60
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:16,300
even the men of the
Ponderosa can die.

61
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:19,100
There will be no war.

62
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,501
And no more
antelope will die.

63
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:24,868
I will see to it.

64
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:27,400
Tukwa always speaks
the truth.

65
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,567
They must indeed be the
weakest cattle of our herd.

66
00:04:30,634 --> 00:04:33,334
For our friendship, would you
drive them off the Ponderosa?

67
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,434
Help your people, Tukwa.

68
00:04:57,234 --> 00:05:01,167
Pa, I don't like
all that war talk.

69
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,033
That new Virginia City
is full of fools.

70
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,434
You'd think even
fools would know

71
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:07,501
you can't push
Indians around.

72
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,467
 All they were
thinking about was food.

73
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:10,734
Food is one thing.

74
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:12,501
Destroying the balance
of nature is another.

75
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,200
If they keep this up,
the whole of Washoe
will become a desert.

76
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:16,868
I saw it happen to
John Sutter's California.

77
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,000
All right, let's go.

78
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,667
Where, Pa?
Virginia City.

79
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:21,734
Come on!
Hey, hey!

80
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,133
(speaking Chinese)

81
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:56,701
Hey, Adam, you see that
little gal smile at me?

82
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:58,901
What makes you think it was
you she was smiling at?

83
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:00,167
You know, every time
I come in here,

84
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,267
I got to get used
to it all over again.

85
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:03,834
Remember when this was nothing
more than a jackrabbit run?

86
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:05,267
HOSS:
Yeah, I don't know but what

87
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:06,567
I liked the jackrabbits better,
Little Joe.

88
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,734
Whoa.
All right, you two country boys

89
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,067
get your fill of the city.

90
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,000
Adam and I will take
a little look around.

91
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,267
Let's go.

92
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:20,067
Hey, Hoss, did you ever
see anything like this
in your whole life?

93
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:26,133
Yep, I seen a
stampede last fall

94
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,767
up in Silver Meadow.

95
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:29,167
Only difference was

96
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:30,601
the stampede
made more sense.

97
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,200
Come on before
you take root.

98
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,834
Looks good, Ma.

99
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,067
Move over, boy.

100
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,968
Wish there was more.

101
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:48,434
Guess we've seen it all now.

102
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,334
The good and the bad.

103
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,968
Is this what they call
striking it rich?

104
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:57,868
Looks like all they've
struck so far is bad luck.

105
00:06:57,934 --> 00:07:01,000
Pretty rough on
young ones like that.

106
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,467
Howdy.

107
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:09,634
Howdy.

108
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:12,801
That's not much of a meal
for growing boys.

109
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,400
That ain't much of
a meal for anybody,

110
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:18,434
but that's my
business, ain't it?

111
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:21,601
No offense
intended, Mister...?

112
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:22,868
Harris. Carl Harris.

113
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,467
This is my wife, my boys.

114
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:26,601
Hello.
Howdy.

115
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,234
Howdy.

116
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,968
You know, Mr. Harris, you could
be feeding those boys beef.

117
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:37,300
Yeah, if'n I had wings,
I could fly, too.

118
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:38,634
Mr. Harris, we're
the Cartwrights,

119
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:39,934
from the Ponderosa.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,834
Now there's plenty of
beef in the valley.

121
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:44,434
I... I reckon so.

122
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:46,968
All I can do
to fork over $10 a pound

123
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,234
for that skinny antelope.

124
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,567
I couldn't afford beef.

125
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:51,400
You paid $10 a pound?

126
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:53,067
And lucky to get it.

127
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:54,934
A man come through
last week

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,734
selling salt pork
for $15 a pound.

129
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:00,667
Least this
meat is fresh.

130
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:02,200
We aren't
starving, Mister.

131
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:03,734
We take care of ourselves.

132
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:05,934
I'm sure you do, ma'am.

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,968
But you don't have
to pay those prices.

134
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:11,400
We market our steers over to
Placerville for $25 a head.

135
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:14,467
We'd be making money
selling them to you for $20.

136
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:16,067
Twenty dollars?

137
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,400
That's right.

138
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:27,033
Are you joking me, Mister?

139
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,534
They're yours
if you want them.

140
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:30,000
All you have to do

141
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,100
is come over to the Ponderosa
and drive them away.

142
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,467
Whoo!

143
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:40,000
(laughing)

144
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:44,367
I couldn't do much better
than that back home in Kaintuck.

145
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:45,534
Kentucky?

146
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:46,901
You're a long
way from home.

147
00:08:46,968 --> 00:08:49,934
I got tired of seeing my family
starve on 40 acres of rock.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,667
and I figured if we had to
starve, we might as well do it

149
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:54,434
somewhere where there's a
chance of striking it rich.

150
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,501
Nobody's going to starve
while we have cattle to sell.

151
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:57,734
Now get yourself
some men together,

152
00:08:57,801 --> 00:08:59,267
and come over
to the Ponderosa.

153
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:01,067
Well, by golly,
we'll do it!

154
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,434
(laughing)

155
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,634
Did you hear that, woman?

156
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,868
We gonna eat
ourselves some beef.

157
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:11,067
Oh, here I am acting
like a Yankee.

158
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,734
Come on in, have
a cup of coffee.

159
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:16,234
 Mr. Harris, you sure don't know
anything about us Yankees.

160
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,868
You're Yankees?

161
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,601
(laughing)

162
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:20,934
Oh, I didn't mean any...

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,334
Oh, it's all right.
It's all right.

164
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,634
Come on in,
have some coffee.

165
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,300
BEN:
Mighty kind of you.

166
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:31,868
(piano playing lively tune)

167
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:35,801
Hey, where'd you come from?

168
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:36,834
You're cute.

169
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:38,400
Hey, now wait
a minute.

170
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,834
Lady, you just mind
your own business.

171
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:42,701
Come on, Little Joe.
She isn't for you.

172
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:44,467
Stuff your eyes back
in your head.

173
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:45,934
They're about to pop out.

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,400
You know, Hoss, I could have
a good time if you weren't here.

175
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:50,534
Yeah, and get yourself
into a peck of trouble, too.

176
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:52,200
(people clamoring)

177
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:53,667
Hey, look at that, Little Joe.

178
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:55,501
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's go!

179
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:58,000
Hurry up!
Let's go!

180
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:00,300
Antelope meat,
$10 a pound.

181
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,734
Yeah. Looks like
we're raising

182
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,234
the wrong kind of
stock, don't it?

183
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,934
Well, come on.

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,501
Hurry up!
Let's go!

185
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,367
Come on now!

186
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,367
Here, let me try,
Little, Joe.

187
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:15,801
Excuse me, men.

188
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:17,634
Excuse me.

189
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:21,968
Excuse me. Excuse me.

190
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:27,734
(clamoring)

191
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,400
All right, get back in line!
Get back...!

192
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:31,834
Stay outta my way!
Get back there!

193
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:32,934
Get back in line!

194
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,901
Pound and a half, $15.

195
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:39,634
They must be out
of their minds.

196
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:41,634
How so, friend?

197
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,667
Always like to hear the other
fella's side of things.

198
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:48,567
$10 a pound
for antelope meat--

199
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:49,601
that make
sense to you?

200
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,300
Depends on your
point of view.

201
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,601
You see, that happens
to be my antelope meat
they're buying.

202
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,667
The Paiutes might
argue with you about that.

203
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:57,901
(chuckles)
I haven't seen you boys around.

204
00:10:57,968 --> 00:10:59,367
Are you staking out
in Virginia City?

205
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:00,701
Mark Burdette's the name.

206
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,501
Joe Cartwright.
This is my brother Hoss.

207
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:03,667
Pleased to meet you.

208
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:05,601
Say, he's a big fella,
isn't he?

209
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,300
Boys, do you have any
idea how many people

210
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,200
are heading toward
Virginia City right now?

211
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:11,801
Thousands.
Yes, sir, thousands.

212
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:14,467
And every blessed one of them
with a belly he's got to fill.

213
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:16,167
Going to be a bunch
of 'em, huh?

214
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:19,033
Ever since they found out about
that blue stuff being silver,

215
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,467
which assays at better
than $3,500 a ton,

216
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:23,601
they're heading here
from all over the world.

217
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:24,901
Silver!

218
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:27,434
All that time, Comstock
and those other fellas

219
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:29,100
were chucking it away,
thinking only about gold.

220
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,734
Gold? Virginia City's
going to be

221
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:33,100
a hundred times the strike
the mother lode ever was.

222
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,601
And let me tell
you something, boys,

223
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,801
there's more than one way
to strike it rich.

224
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:39,234
Man can live without
whiskey and women

225
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,267
and clothing,
even shelter,

226
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,968
but if he doesn't eat,
he dies.

227
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:45,934
Hey, Little Joe, what
are you doing here?

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,901
Pa. Pa, I'd like you
to meet Mark Burdette.

229
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:49,100
He owns this place.

230
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,300
Proud to meet you,
Mr. Cartwright.

231
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,300
Howdy.

232
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:52,300
This is my
brother Adam.

233
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:53,534
Adam.
Howdy.

234
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:55,167
You've got a good thing
here, haven't you?

235
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:57,567
Takes a businessman to know good
business, Mr. Cartwright.

236
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,200
 Is that what
you call it?

237
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:00,634
I could think
of another name.

238
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,601
(chuckles):
Well...

239
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,467
you boys sound
as if you want to talk.

240
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:06,167
Well, one thing you'll
find out about me,

241
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:07,767
I'm always ready to oblige,

242
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:09,000
This way, gentlemen.

243
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:12,567
Here we are.

244
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:14,534
It's not very much,
but it's a beginning.

245
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,534
What I say is, let them
have their silver,

246
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,801
as long as I can sell
them their meat.

247
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,501
Your charging pretty
fancy prices for that meat.

248
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,200
It's the only meat
in town, Mr. Cartwright.

249
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:23,834
It costs me a
lot to get it.

250
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:25,567
 It's liable to cost
you a lot more.

251
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:27,334
Mister, you went out and
butchered the meat supply

252
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,767
of the whole Paiute nation.

253
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,234
You're risking an Indian war.

254
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,267
Oh, come now, friend.

255
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,534
I've got nothing
against the Indians.

256
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,667
What I always say is
fair game is fair game.

257
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:35,968
Hey, Pa, why don't we sell

258
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,634
some of our stock
to Mr. Burdette here,

259
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:39,834
and the Paiutes can
have the antelope to
themselves again?

260
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:41,167
What stock you talking
about, son?

261
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:42,567
Don't you know
about the Ponderosa?

262
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:44,067
Joe!
We got more
prime cattle than...

263
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,234
You have?

264
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,701
Real prime beef
east of the Sierras?

265
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,601
I'll tell you what I'll do,
Mr. Cartwright.

266
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll take all you've got.

267
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,334
You can name your own price.

268
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
If you charge ten dollars
a pound for antelope meat,

269
00:12:58,467 --> 00:12:59,868
what will you be
charging for beef?

270
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:00,868
All I can get.

271
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:02,434
If you think
that's out of line,

272
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:04,801
take a look in the saloon,
see what rot-gut
whiskey's going for.

273
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,234
Or a bag of flour.

274
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,501
Or a pick and shovel.

275
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:10,734
I just sold last side
of antelope, Mr. Burdette.

276
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,033
We're out of business.

277
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,067
Not yet, Thorne.

278
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,501
These gentlemen are
the Cartwrights

279
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:15,601
from the Ponderosa ranch.

280
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,667
Prime beef cattle,
as much as you want.

281
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:18,667
My assistant, Early Thorne.

282
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:19,667
How are you, gents?

283
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:20,901
Well, do we do business?

284
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,167
Why not, Pa? We're in
the business to sell cattle.

285
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:27,000
Mr. Burdette, we have
our own way of doing business

286
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,534
on the Ponderosa.

287
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:31,601
We pay an honest day's wages
for an honest day's work,

288
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:33,000
and we expect the
same in return.

289
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:34,334
Nothing more,
nothing less.

290
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,567
You referring to us, mister?

291
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:36,734
It's all right, Thorne.

292
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:39,067
Let's be honest, friends.
I need your cattle.

293
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:41,601
I'm willing to pay you
the best price you'll ever get.

294
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,467
I have a cold storage
tunnel out there

295
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:44,901
full of ice from the Sierras.

296
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:46,300
It's the only ice in town.

297
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,868
If you're gonna sell
in Virginia City,

298
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:49,367
you'll have to sell
to me anyhow.

299
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:51,100
I say let's get together,
we'll both clean up.

300
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:52,934
We ain't hurting for customers,
Mr. Burdette.

301
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,968
Any miner in town can
come up to the Ponderosa

302
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:56,434
and buy all the meat
he needs.

303
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,400
And we don't intend
to profit from his hunger.

304
00:13:58,467 --> 00:13:59,534
Profit from their hunger?

305
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:01,267
You think I was twisting
those fellows' arms

306
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:02,400
to get 'em in here?

307
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,300
Every minute they can spare

308
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:07,200
they use to dig for silver.
I'm doing them a service.

309
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:09,567
My son is right.

310
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,567
The Ponderosa is
a business,

311
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:13,667
but there's more involved
here than profits.

312
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:16,767
I'm sorry, Mr. Burdette,
no deal.

313
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:17,767
Why not?

314
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,300
I'm offering you
top dollar.

315
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:20,501
And charging top dollar

316
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,501
to people who can't
afford to pay.

317
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:24,367
Maybe you need taking
down a peg.

318
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:25,901
Thorne!

319
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:27,634
It would be
foolish, mister.

320
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,801
I've told you
about your temper!

321
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:35,033
I'm sorry about this, gentlemen.

322
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,400
But we can't let it interfere
with our negotiations.

323
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:40,033
Our negotiations are over.

324
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,901
I want to warn you again.

325
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,167
Stop slaughtering
the wild herds.

326
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:45,467
If you don't want a war
on your hands,

327
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:47,234
you'll follow this advice.

328
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,834
The Paiutes can be...
unpleasant.

329
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:52,534
Come on.

330
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,601
I'm gonna kill me one
of them Cartwrights!

331
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,033
Thorne, when are you
gonna learn

332
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,367
there's more than one way
of getting what you want?

333
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:09,501
Are you sure,
Mr. Burdette?

334
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,634
I'm sure.

335
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,234
They'll sell to me
before I'm through

336
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,534
or they'll never sell cattle
to anyone else.

337
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:34,334
CAROL: Whoa. Hi, there,
Mr. Cartwright.

338
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,334
What do you think
of Virginia City?

339
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,701
Sure is growin' up,
ain't she?

340
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,367
It sure is, Mr. Harris.

341
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:41,501
This place is busier
than a nest of hornets.

342
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,801
Where you fixin' to go?

343
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:47,033
Oh, I got a little diggin'
to do up Six Mile Canyon.

344
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,701
You know,
back in Kaintuck,

345
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:50,734
I never thought
that I'd be living on

346
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:53,334
a mountain of solid silver.
(chuckles)

347
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,701
Kind of takes a man's mind off
other things, though.

348
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,467
About them Cartwrights...

349
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:00,701
There they are.

350
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,601
Don't you let it take
your mind off those cattle.

351
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,167
You get some people
together and come on over

352
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:05,901
first thing in the morning,
and we'll fix you up.

353
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:08,300
By golly, I'll do that
first thing in the morning.

354
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,000
And I want
to thank you all.

355
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,734
That's a real neighborly
thing to do.

356
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:13,467
I'll bet them two boys
make mighty good help

357
00:16:13,534 --> 00:16:15,133
when it comes to digging,
don't they, Mr. Harris?

358
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,501
We sure do.

359
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:17,868
Yeah, well,
they'll be even better

360
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:19,901
when we get a little beef
on their bones!

361
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:21,534
We'll see ya.
Bye, boys.

362
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,534
You heard what
they're fixin' to do?

363
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:28,100
Sure, the Cartwrights
are gonna sell beef

364
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,133
direct to the miners.

365
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,267
That'll wreck us,
Burdette.

366
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:32,467
It could if those cattle
reach Virginia City.

367
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,901
Want me to stop 'em?

368
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:35,868
Let's just say I don't
look with favor

369
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:37,601
upon any unnecessary
competition.

370
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,133
If anyone's looking
for me, Thorne,

371
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,133
tell 'em I'm investigating

372
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,734
the pleasures of
The Bucket of Blood.

373
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,133
Right.

374
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:01,000
You were just about
to buy me a drink,
weren't you?

375
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:05,000
Well... how did you guess?

376
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,467
I suppose I just have a knack
for certain things.

377
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:12,767
Uh-huh, I'm sure you have.

378
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:16,434
Oh, um, isn't there
some kind of a rule

379
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:18,200
about women frequenting saloons?

380
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,300
Didn't you know?

381
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:22,801
This is Virginia City.
Anything goes.

382
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:24,868
Exactly my sentiments.
After you.

383
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:32,400
Well, it isn't exactly the
Palace Hotel in San Francisco,

384
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:34,934
but it'll have to do.

385
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,868
The name is Glory DeLacey.

386
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:38,901
And it's all right,
I've been in here before.

387
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:41,534
Then you'll know the kind
of whisky to order.

388
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:42,868
It's all one kind:
rotgut.

389
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:44,267
Well, let's see
if you're right.

390
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:48,067
Bartender, a bottle
of your very finest.

391
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,734
Why is it that
a new mining camp

392
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:51,300
always has the worst
kind of whisky?

393
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:53,501
And the worst kind of women?

394
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,934
That wasn't what I was thinking.

395
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,434
What were you thinking?

396
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:02,000
That you are the only really
beautiful thing I've seen

397
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,000
in Virginia City.

398
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:07,334
Why haven't I
seen you before?

399
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,734
I just got in town
a few days ago.

400
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:12,000
Well, let's celebrate.

401
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:14,968
Thank you.

402
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,167
What's your name?

403
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,801
Burdette. Mark Burdette.

404
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:25,534
To Glory

405
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:27,334
of the Comstock Lode.

406
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,334
To the Comstock Lode.

407
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,934
They say it'll be the biggest
and richest strike in history.

408
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,167
A bonanza, a real bonanza.

409
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:37,834
And I'm gonna get
my share of it.

410
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:40,634
You're not exactly
dressed for the part.

411
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:43,133
Hmm? Oh, you don't think I mean
to dig for it

412
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,567
like those fellows over there?

413
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:47,167
No, there's more than one way
of panning for silver.

414
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:49,200
Yeah, I know.

415
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:52,734
I didn't mean it that way.

416
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,167
Why are you here?

417
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,200
The excitement of a new camp.

418
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:01,667
I don't know.

419
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:04,033
Maybe the hope
that this one'll be it.

420
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,133
Anyway, there's nothing left
in California.

421
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,300
This is gonna be the biggest
thing that ever happened.

422
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:10,133
Make California look sick,
I can feel it.

423
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,667
And this time,
I mean to get my share of it.

424
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:16,667
How come you never made it
in California,

425
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:19,534
a smart man like you?

426
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:23,267
Oh, maybe I wasn't smart enough.

427
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:24,501
Come to think of it,

428
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:26,367
I could ask you the same
question, couldn't I?

429
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:28,000
Don't.

430
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:31,367
To the future,
when we both have
what we want.

431
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:33,367
You care to drink
to it?

432
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:35,267
As long as you're buying
the drinks, Mr. Burdette,

433
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:36,801
I'll drink to anything.

434
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:38,067
I'm going to be rich.

435
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,100
The richest man
in town.

436
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:41,234
Here's wishing you luck.

437
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,400
What I mean to say is
that from now on.

438
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:48,434
I don't want anyone
else buying you drinks.

439
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:55,601
You mean you want to take care
of... everything?

440
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:58,601
I'm gonna take care
of everything.

441
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,601
$20, $40, $60,

442
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,234
$80, $100,
Mr. Cartwright.

443
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,000
And I sure want
to thank you.

444
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:07,901
You can have more cattle,
if you want.

445
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:10,367
That's pretty near
all we can afford right now,

446
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:13,567
but as soon as I get a dozen
more feet down in my diggings,

447
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:15,634
I'll come back and buy
your whole ranch!

448
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:17,067
(all laugh)

449
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,667
Hey, there comes ol' Tukwa.

450
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:21,033
I thought he was supposed to be
up on the rim.

451
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:26,734
LITTLE JOE: He's riding like
there's some trouble.

452
00:20:26,801 --> 00:20:28,133
Anything wrong, Tukwa?

453
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,667
More new diggers,
Ben Cartwright. Too many.

454
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:32,501
Like the trees
of the forest.

455
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,334
He ain't a-fooling you there,
Mr. Cartwright.

456
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,734
I bet there ain't a hard-rock
man left in California,

457
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:40,033
unless'n he's too sick
to walk.

458
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,734
Men who chase
the mirage.

459
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:43,100
Maybe so, maybe not,

460
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,934
but somebody's gonna hit it
over there

461
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,801
to Virginia City, and
nobody knows who yet!

462
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:50,334
Well, my boys, we got 'em.

463
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,601
Thanks again.

464
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,901
And just wait till them women
see a square meal

465
00:20:53,968 --> 00:20:56,067
walkin' in on the hoof.
(laughs)

466
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,534
Bye.

467
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:05,667
Go ahead!

468
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:09,000
CARL:
Hyah! Hyah!

469
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:14,133
What's the matter, Pa?

470
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,701
Those newcomers
from California.

471
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:18,968
Adam, you double the riders
on the rim.

472
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:20,033
We'll start losing cattle.

473
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,033
I go back, tell 'em?

474
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,634
No, you've
had a hard ride.

475
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:24,868
You go down to Steamboat Springs
camp for a while.

476
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:27,200
I'll put another man
up on the rim.

477
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:29,133
Pa, we could have got
a lot more

478
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,901
than $20 a head
for those cattle.

479
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:32,234
We made a fair profit.

480
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,267
That's all the Ponderosa asks.

481
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,667
Yeah? Well, what about
the other ranches?

482
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:35,934
Pa spoke to the
other settlers.

483
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,334
They won't boost
up their prices.

484
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,534
What do you want more money
for, anyhow, Little Joe?

485
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:40,868
You ain't going no place.
(chuckles)

486
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
We're eating steak
tonight.

487
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:04,167
Get ready.

488
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:30,701
Remember, I'll take care
of the one who's to be
left alive.

489
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:41,000
Get 'em!

490
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:42,033
(all whooping)

491
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Don't shoot!

492
00:22:58,467 --> 00:22:59,767
Hyah!

493
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,767
(all whooping, gunshots)

494
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:11,367
The-The, The kids...

495
00:23:11,434 --> 00:23:14,133
What are we gonna
tell the kids?

496
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,501
It's all over
town, Thorne.

497
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:30,267
Fever's running high
against the Indians.

498
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:33,267
Did you <i>have</i>
to kill like that?

499
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:35,467
Them cattle didn't get
to Virginia City, did they?

500
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:36,701
All right, they didn't,

501
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:38,634
but you could have
stopped short of murder.

502
00:23:38,701 --> 00:23:40,100
You know any other way,
Mr. Burdette?

503
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:41,501
The Cartwrights
would've come around;

504
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,167
I'd have upped the price
until they had no choice.

505
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:44,968
Someday, you're gonna learn
it takes more than money

506
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:46,300
to make a real killing.

507
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:52,334
Thorne... you're a monster.

508
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,968
I never should have
taken up with you again.

509
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:58,334
You need me, Burdette.

510
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,467
Remember, we have
a murder charge hanging over us

511
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:01,701
back in St. Louis.

512
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:03,801
Or did you forget about
that prison guard I killed

513
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:06,133
so you could get
to be a free man again?

514
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:17,467
There you are--
three kings.

515
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:23,801
All right, boys,
party's over.

516
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:25,367
We got some more
work to do.

517
00:24:25,434 --> 00:24:26,767
I thought we done enough,
Thorne.

518
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:27,801
Our job's only
half-done.

519
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:28,901
There's still
the other half.

520
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:29,767
Yeah? What's that?

521
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,334
The town is plenty riled up

522
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,834
against the Indians
for killing them miners.

523
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:35,234
Well, they're getting the posse
together to go after 'em.

524
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,367
Yeah, I know.
That's why we gotta get

525
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,000
the Indians stirred up
against the miners.

526
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:41,033
That way, we put the Cartwrights
plumb in the middle.

527
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,934
What's on your mind?

528
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,033
Killing us some Paiutes...

529
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,467
for having massacred
those poor hardworking miners.

530
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:48,033
Why don't we let the posse
go after 'em?

531
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,334
Because the posse might stop
long enough to ask questions,

532
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,601
and I don't like questions.

533
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,901
You mean, like "Who really
killed those miners?"

534
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:56,734
What's the idea?

535
00:24:56,801 --> 00:24:58,701
I told you I don't
like questions.

536
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:01,067
You really are smart,
aren't you, Thornton?

537
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,133
Smart enough to know
a dead man can't talk,

538
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,067
even to a posse.

539
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:09,234
What's the name of that Indian
that works for the Cartwrights?

540
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,767
Did you hear me?

541
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:11,767
Tukwa.

542
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:13,167
Tukwa.

543
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:15,534
All right, boys,
let's get moving.

544
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:17,667
We got to get to him
before somebody else does.

545
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:18,968
Get your hat.

546
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:31,300
(gunshot)

547
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:35,300
(gunfire)

548
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:41,033
(men whistling,
shouting)

549
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,801
(gunfire continues
in distance)

550
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:11,534
It was the diggers
from Sun Mountain.

551
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:13,133
Some of my
people saw them

552
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,033
as they drove the cattle
toward the waters.

553
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,267
Are you sure,
Winnemucca?

554
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:19,434
The Paiute does not lie.

555
00:26:19,501 --> 00:26:22,334
The diggers kill
the deer and the antelope.

556
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,467
They cut down the pinon tree,
and the Paiute has no bread.

557
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:28,367
And now he cuts down
my young men.

558
00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:31,167
It's like California
all over again.

559
00:26:31,234 --> 00:26:32,801
Whatever they
touch, they kill.

560
00:26:32,868 --> 00:26:35,634
Why would anybody want
to kill Tukwa?

561
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:39,634
Vengeance-- some strange
notion of vengeance.

562
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:42,067
It just don't
make sense, Pa.

563
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,968
Them miners was all
killed with bullets.

564
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:45,767
Paiutes use arrows.

565
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:48,968
I guess he didn't have much
chance to tell then that.

566
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:52,067
What will my young men
say when I tell them

567
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,701
of their brother's murder?

568
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,000
You must keep them
in hand, Winnemucca.

569
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:59,334
Let the Ponderosa find
the men who did this.

570
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,100
I am an old man leading
a thousand stallions.

571
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:06,534
Today I can stop
my young braves.

572
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:08,734
I do not know if
I can tomorrow.

573
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:11,667
We will return for Tukwa.

574
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:32,667
Now let's find out
who did this.

575
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,367
I know who.
Who?

576
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:36,467
Mark Burdette.

577
00:27:36,534 --> 00:27:37,868
LITTLE JOE:
Now wait a
minute, Adam.

578
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:39,200
Don't you think you're
pushing this a little bit?

579
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:40,434
I know you don't
like Burdette,

580
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:41,534
but you heard Winnemucca
say some miners did this.

581
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:42,934
Burdette's no miner.

582
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,367
At the moment he's the only man
who stands to make a profit

583
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:46,501
by starting trouble
between the ranchers

584
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,067
and the miners,
not to mention the Indians.

585
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,701
Pa, we've got
nothing to go on.

586
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:50,901
If we listen to Adam,

587
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:52,400
we may ride
into Virginia City

588
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:53,901
and hang an innocent man.

589
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:56,000
He has a point
there, Adam.

590
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:57,434
We have no proof.

591
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:59,367
You've met Burdette.
How much proof do you need?

592
00:27:59,434 --> 00:28:01,267
Enough to know that
we've got the right man.

593
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:03,367
Look, why don't you let me
go into Virginia City

594
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:05,200
and snoop around--
see what I can pick up.

595
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,734
Alone?

596
00:28:06,801 --> 00:28:08,868
Sure. If we all go in
together, everyone
will see us.

597
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:10,534
I go in by myself,
I won't be noticed.

598
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:12,567
It might not be
a bad idea, Pa.

599
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:16,300
Well, maybe.

600
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:18,467
Now you take care
of yourself, Little Joe.

601
00:28:18,534 --> 00:28:21,133
Don't let Burdette sell you a
half-interest in his business.

602
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,067
Might not be
a bad investment.

603
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:26,834
Little Joe, maybe I ought
to ride in with you, huh?

604
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:29,601
Hoss, I'd be less noticed if
I rode down the main street

605
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,634
with a couple
of wild steers.

606
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:33,501
Don't worry,
I'll take care of myself.

607
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:41,200
How can anybody, even
a man like Mr. Burdette,

608
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:43,834
shoot down innocent men
just for a few dollars?

609
00:28:43,901 --> 00:28:46,634
Not for just a few dollars,
Hoss-- a bonanza.

610
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:09,267
Joe Cartwright just
rode in alone.

611
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:10,968
He's taking quite
a chance, isn't he?

612
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:12,434
Riding into
Virginia City alone?

613
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,701
Especially if word
gets around

614
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:15,567
that the Cartwrights are
siding with the Paiutes.

615
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:18,067
What do you think would
happen to him, if it did?

616
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,267
Who knows?
Almost anything.

617
00:29:19,334 --> 00:29:20,801
I wouldn't want
him hurt bad.

618
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:22,701
I have a feeling that
Joe Cartwright and I

619
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:23,968
are going to be friends.

620
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:25,667
Yeah, good friends.

621
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:41,734
Hey, kid.

622
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:46,767
You talking to me, mister?

623
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:48,901
Yeah, I'm talking to you,
you murdering little skunk.

624
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:52,667
(men shouting)

625
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:54,901
(all clamoring)

626
00:29:58,934 --> 00:30:01,100
Come on.
Yeah, get up
and hit him.

627
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:07,367
Get him.

628
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:08,901
Get up!
Come on!

629
00:30:08,968 --> 00:30:12,701
Yeah, get up.
Get up and hit him, boy!
Come on.

630
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:18,734
Get up!
Hit him.

631
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:21,200
You know who he is?
No.

632
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:23,267
He's one of them
Cartwrights.

633
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:25,167
And they're siding with those
murdering, thieving Paiutes.

634
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:26,267
Paiutes?

635
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:28,367
Somebody get a rope.

636
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:30,801
No, don't do it.
He didn't do anything.

637
00:30:30,868 --> 00:30:31,868
Let him alone!

638
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:34,701
Let him go!
He didn't do anything!

639
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,601
Let's hang him.

640
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:39,234
Come on,
let's get him!

641
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,834
What is all this?

642
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:43,300
We're going to hang
ourselves an Injun lover.

643
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:44,901
Nobody's going to
hang this boy.

644
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,400
We've got three men dead
over those Paiutes.

645
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:49,634
That don't say Joe Cartwright
here's any part of it.

646
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:53,234
Who started this-- you?

647
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,300
Yeah, so what?

648
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:55,667
Thorne, you're fired.

649
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:57,934
I don't want to see you
around my place anymore.

650
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,367
Here we go.

651
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:02,734
Take him
into my office.

652
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:04,100
Open up. Let 'em through.

653
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:05,834
What is this?

654
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:10,100
Anybody want to argue
about anything?

655
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:24,601
(groans)

656
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:25,834
Did I hurt you?

657
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:27,734
Oh, I don't think
you could hurt me, ma'am.

658
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:29,033
(chuckles)

659
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,934
I don't understand-- those
miners out in the street--

660
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,300
they wanted to hang me.
Why?

661
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:34,100
You don't know?

662
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:36,267
Well, the miners sent
two groups out to buy cattle.

663
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:37,968
One of them went
down to your place.

664
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:39,634
Yeah, that's right. We sold them
about half-dozen head.

665
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:41,834
BURDETTE:
The other went from
Gold Hill down toward Carson.

666
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,200
They found both
groups murdered.

667
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:44,400
Cattle were gone.

668
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:45,801
What makes them think
it was the Paiutes?

669
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:47,701
One of the miners,
a man named Harris,

670
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,200
managed to stay alive.

671
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:52,200
He recognized one of the
Indians, a fella called Tukwa.

672
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:54,701
That's a lie.

673
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:56,534
Easy, Joe.

674
00:31:56,601 --> 00:31:58,000
He said it, not me.

675
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:00,067
Anyway, that's why
this Tukwa is dead.

676
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:01,334
They would've
hung him anyway.

677
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,868
Tukwa's not that
kind of a man.

678
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:05,200
He'd never take a part
in anything like this.

679
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:07,767
Mr. Burdette, You helped
me out there in the street.

680
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:09,968
I-I kind of think
of us as friends.

681
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,501
You can believe
me about Tukwa.

682
00:32:11,567 --> 00:32:13,000
No, I don't want
to believe it.

683
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:14,000
Drop it.

684
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,767
Drop it?

685
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:16,767
What do you mean?

686
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,200
What I said.
It's all over now.

687
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:19,534
This Indian, whatever
his name was...

688
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:21,701
His name was Tukwa.
All right, it's Tukwa.

689
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:23,467
Anyway, he's dead now,
and he deserved to die.

690
00:32:23,534 --> 00:32:24,567
He took part in
that massacre.

691
00:32:24,634 --> 00:32:26,067
But he didn't,
Mr. Burdette, not Tukwa.

692
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:27,901
I know.
How do you know?!

693
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:33,400
Young fool,
how do you know?

694
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:34,801
I told you, he
was identified.

695
00:32:34,868 --> 00:32:37,033
LITTLE JOE:
Yeah, that's right,
you told me.

696
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,334
Thanks for the help.

697
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:45,334
A fella buy you a
drink someday, ma'am?

698
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,868
You know where
to find me.

699
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:49,801
I'll find you.

700
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:58,701
You were pretty
nice to that kid.

701
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:01,968
That's my job,
being nice to people.

702
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:03,534
To paying customers, you mean.

703
00:33:03,601 --> 00:33:05,400
He wasn't a paying customer.

704
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:07,534
And you are,
aren't you, Mr. Burdette?

705
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:10,267
You bought me
three drinks.

706
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:11,501
Or was it four?

707
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:12,501
I didn't count.

708
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:13,501
Look, what's
bothering you?

709
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:14,834
You, if you want to know.

710
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:16,601
What about me?

711
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:19,334
I don't want you fooling around
with anyone else, do you hear?

712
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,000
I told you I'm going to be
the biggest man in this town.

713
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,868
(chuckles)

714
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:26,400
Then God have mercy
on this town.

715
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:36,267
I'm sorry, Glory.

716
00:33:36,334 --> 00:33:37,968
I didn't mean that.

717
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:41,300
I'm glad you did it.

718
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,267
'Cause now I don't
owe you a thing

719
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:44,534
for those three drinks.

720
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:45,834
What's bothering you?

721
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:47,467
You act as though
I've done something wrong?

722
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:48,534
What have I done?

723
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:50,400
I'm not sure.

724
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:51,701
But if it's
what I'm thinking...

725
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:53,267
What are you thinking?

726
00:33:53,334 --> 00:33:57,300
That maybe, just maybe it was
you who ordered that massacre.

727
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:58,567
No, that isn't true.

728
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:00,133
You heard about Harris
identifying Tukwa.

729
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,834
I heard you identify him,
Mr. Burdette.

730
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:05,701
I didn't hear anything else.

731
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:09,000
I didn't hear
Mr. Harris say anything.

732
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:34,501
Well, there he is now.

733
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:35,901
About time.

734
00:34:35,968 --> 00:34:37,501
Where you been?

735
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:38,968
We were worried
about you.

736
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:41,234
Sit down and eat and tell
us what you found out.

737
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,934
Little Joe, what
they do to you, boy?

738
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:52,200
What happened
to your face?
Forget it.

739
00:34:52,267 --> 00:34:53,267
Who did it?

740
00:34:53,334 --> 00:34:54,834
Now hold still a minute.
Now who did it?

741
00:34:54,901 --> 00:34:55,901
Some miners in
Virginia City.

742
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:56,968
I said forget it.

743
00:34:57,033 --> 00:34:58,167
They beat you
like this?

744
00:34:58,234 --> 00:34:59,367
They'd have hanged me

745
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:00,801
if Mark Burdette
hadn't have stopped them.

746
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:02,501
Hanged you?
For what?

747
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,434
For being a friend
of the Paiutes.

748
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:07,000
They saw Tukwa riding with the
men who staged that massacre.

749
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:08,200
That's a lie.

750
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:09,868
Yeah, that's what
I tried to tell them.

751
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:11,067
For what good it did me.

752
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:12,467
Who was the one
who identified Tukwa?

753
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:14,367
The only one that
came out of it alive.

754
00:35:14,434 --> 00:35:16,734
That fella named Harris.

755
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:17,934
Adam, what are
you up to?

756
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,400
I'm going to have
a little talk

757
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:20,868
with our friend Harris.

758
00:35:20,934 --> 00:35:22,667
No, wait, don't ride
in there alone;
we'll go with you.

759
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,601
Where've you been?

760
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:48,000
Staying away.

761
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:50,067
After all,
you fired me.

762
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,701
Don't be funny.

763
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:56,100
You look worried, Burdette.

764
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:58,234
Don't remember seeing
you look that way before.

765
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,000
You're seeing things.

766
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:01,701
There isn't anything
I can't handle.

767
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,367
Sure, sure.

768
00:36:03,434 --> 00:36:05,334
Like that girl
I seen walk out of here.

769
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,767
That one named Glory?

770
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:09,567
Why do you mention her?

771
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,534
She doesn't have
anything to do with it.

772
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:12,934
She don't, huh?

773
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,601
Well, I'm real
glad to hear that.

774
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,968
Because I just seen her
going up to the Harris place.

775
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:19,667
The Harris place?

776
00:36:19,734 --> 00:36:21,667
Suppose Harris tells
her the truth?

777
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:24,834
I thought you and me
came to Virginia City

778
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:27,801
to strike it rich,
not stretch a rope.

779
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,801
Well, hello, boys.

780
00:36:45,868 --> 00:36:47,267
Ma'am.
Hello, ma'am.

781
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:48,567
You're pretty
busy, aren't you?

782
00:36:48,634 --> 00:36:50,367
We are. We're panning
for gold, ma'am.

783
00:36:50,434 --> 00:36:53,033
Gold? Does anybody
ever find it?

784
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,567
Michael...

785
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:58,734
You want anything here?

786
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:01,100
You're Mrs. Harris,
aren't you?

787
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:02,868
Yes, I'm Mrs. Harris.

788
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:05,067
I'm pleased to
know you, ma'am. I'm...

789
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:06,667
I know who you are.

790
00:37:06,734 --> 00:37:08,601
What do you want here?

791
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:11,167
I'd like to see
your husband.

792
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:14,367
My husband?

793
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:15,968
You know my husband?

794
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,267
No, but I must
talk with him.

795
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:20,300
It's very important.

796
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:30,067
How is he?

797
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:32,133
Since he was hurt out there,

798
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,934
he does nothing
but stare at the ceiling.

799
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:40,067
Sometimes he talks,
but mostly he just stares.

800
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:49,133
Carl?

801
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:52,400
There's somebody here
wants to talk to you.

802
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:56,467
A woman.

803
00:37:56,534 --> 00:37:59,400
Mr. Harris?

804
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:02,334
There's something I've got to
know about that Indian attack.

805
00:38:03,801 --> 00:38:07,667
I thought
I was doing the best thing,

806
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:10,767
coming out west,

807
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:13,434
bettering myself.

808
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:18,167
We're worse off here
than we were back home.

809
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:25,934
Mr. Harris...

810
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,167
Mr. Harris, I've got to know
about that Indian attack.

811
00:38:32,434 --> 00:38:35,100
What do you want to know?

812
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:38,667
That Indian, the one that
rode for the Cartwrights,

813
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:41,167
the one they called Tukwa.

814
00:38:41,234 --> 00:38:42,901
Did you see him
during the attack?

815
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:49,400
I don't even know who he is.

816
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:54,200
Then you couldn't have
identified him, could you?

817
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:59,300
I couldn't identify anybody.

818
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:06,334
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

819
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,467
Thank you very much.

820
00:39:11,534 --> 00:39:13,567
Thank you, ma'am.

821
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:15,868
I sure hope your luck
changes for the better soon.

822
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,901
Goodbye, boys; I sure
hope you find that gold.

823
00:39:24,968 --> 00:39:26,067
We will.

824
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:29,133
We just got
to keep on digging, though.

825
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,968
She's pretty.

826
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:32,534
Hey, Mike, keep digging.

827
00:39:32,601 --> 00:39:34,934
All right.

828
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,300
What are they doing to her?
I don't know.

829
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:44,267
We won't hurt you, Glory,
but you better go with us.

830
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:45,267
(yelping)

831
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:46,334
Why, you...

832
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,734
Thorne! Don't you
ever hit her again.

833
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:50,701
Who's going to stop
me, Burdette, you?

834
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:52,801
Get up there.

835
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:53,868
They're hurting her!

836
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,801
Ma! Ma!

837
00:39:55,868 --> 00:39:57,834
Mark, why are you
doing this? Why?
Be quiet!

838
00:39:57,901 --> 00:39:59,434
What is it, Michael?
They're hurting her.

839
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:01,601
Who?
The lady that just
left the house.

840
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:14,334
Carl, they've taken
that girl away.

841
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,901
I gotta get to town,
get help.

842
00:40:15,968 --> 00:40:19,968
It was just a bare rock farm.

843
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:24,968
A man had to take a chance...

844
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:28,501
for his wife, his boys...

845
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:33,968
You boys stay here
in case your pa needs something.

846
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,033
Mrs. Harris, we'd like to have
a talk with your husband.

847
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,501
The girl!
They've taken the girl!

848
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:44,834
The girl?

849
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:47,601
What girl?

850
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,400
I don't know her name.
She works in the saloon.

851
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:50,634
You mean Glory?

852
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:52,167
You've got to help!
They'll kill her!

853
00:40:52,234 --> 00:40:54,601
Now, Mrs. Harris, just
try to calm yourself

854
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:55,934
and tell us what happened.

855
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,367
It was that man named Thorne.
They were beating her.

856
00:40:58,434 --> 00:41:00,367
They? Who?
Who was with Thorne?

857
00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:02,868
The man he works for, the one
that wears the fancy clothes.

858
00:41:02,934 --> 00:41:04,534
Two men beating up on a girl?

859
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:07,033
They rode out of town.

860
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,234
Thorne had the girl.

861
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,801
Adam, I was wrong
about him. I'm sorry.

862
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,033
Forget it, younger brother.

863
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,834
Now, what do we do
about the girl?

864
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:15,400
We find her.

865
00:41:15,467 --> 00:41:16,801
Don't we, Pa?

866
00:41:16,868 --> 00:41:18,467
Yeah, we find her.
Come on.

867
00:41:36,767 --> 00:41:39,400
Think I can
run away out here?

868
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:40,868
Thanks.

869
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:42,801
Where's that line shack you
were talking about, Thorne?

870
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:45,367
Should be
just over that hill.

871
00:41:45,434 --> 00:41:47,033
Hyah!

872
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:51,701
Whoa... Whoa.

873
00:41:52,934 --> 00:41:55,167
I sure would like to get
my hands on that Thorne.

874
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:57,601
You'll get your chance as soon
as we find the girl.

875
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:59,300
Hoss, you think you can tell
which way they're heading?

876
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:03,300
Pa, if I read the signs right,
it looks to me like

877
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:05,701
they're trying to make
the other side of Devil's Gate.

878
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:06,968
You think so?

879
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:08,701
Just the hottest,
driest strip of desert

880
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,501
in the Nevada territory.

881
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:11,834
All right. Let's go.

882
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:20,834
Now, this is Devil's
Gate, isn't it, Thorne?

883
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:22,167
Yeah, it sure is.

884
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:24,133
Where's the shack?
Just over the ridge.

885
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,133
You sure?

886
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,000
It wouldn't make much
difference if I wasn't,

887
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:30,167
would it, Mr. Burdette?

888
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:33,467
Why don't you kill him,
Burdette?

889
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:36,067
Now, where did you get
that idea?

890
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:39,200
I thought you were the biggest
man in Virginia City.

891
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:41,567
All right, prove it.

892
00:42:41,634 --> 00:42:42,734
Kill him.

893
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:46,067
Think you can do it,
Mr. Burdette?

894
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,934
You're right, Hoss.
They're headed
for Devil's Gate.

895
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,467
Wait a minute,
Little Joe.

896
00:43:04,534 --> 00:43:06,968
They can't be too far ahead,
with one horse riding double.

897
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:09,868
Adam, you and Little Joe
cut around that hill.

898
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:11,534
Hoss and I will plug the gap
from this end.

899
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:13,033
Sounds good, Pa.
Come on!

900
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:46,067
You were lying, Thorne.
I should've known it.

901
00:43:46,133 --> 00:43:48,934
Now, why would I do a thing
like that, eh? Come on.

902
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,200
There's no shack there.
There isn't anything there.

903
00:43:51,267 --> 00:43:53,634
Well, there's plenty of space.

904
00:43:53,701 --> 00:43:55,634
Long, dry, hot space.

905
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:01,601
Want a drink, miss?

906
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,234
Course, it ain't none
of that fancy whisky

907
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,400
like you're used to having.

908
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:06,000
I don't want anything
from you.

909
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:08,467
Good. 'Cause that's exactly
what you're going to get.

910
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:13,300
Is that what
you were planning, Thorne?

911
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:15,033
To turn her loose
in that desert, without water?

912
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,400
She's the only thing

913
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:18,100
between you and me making
a real killing, partner.

914
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:20,501
I'm going to kill you, Thorne.

915
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:24,167
And just how do you plan
to do that, Mr. Burdette?

916
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:28,200
(gunshot)

917
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,868
Take cover!

918
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:50,667
HOSS: Sounds like Adam
and Little Joe found them.

919
00:44:50,734 --> 00:44:52,667
(gunfire in distance)

920
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,300
You've got a gun.
Why aren't you using it?

921
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,667
You look worried, Thorne.

922
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,334
I don't remember you
looking that way before.

923
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,367
They'll kill you, you fool.
You want to get killed?

924
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:19,567
Get her.

925
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:23,467
She got away.

926
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:24,734
No, she didn't.

927
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:32,634
Use that gun.

928
00:45:35,634 --> 00:45:36,734
Use that gun, Burdette!

929
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:39,167
You knew about me
all along, didn't you?

930
00:45:39,234 --> 00:45:40,901
I didn't fool you
for a minute.

931
00:45:40,968 --> 00:45:44,400
Not very many men fool me, Mark.

932
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:45,601
I didn't, either.

933
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:48,300
That's what's important to me.

934
00:45:48,367 --> 00:45:50,734
You saw what a fake I was
right from the start.

935
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:54,667
Not a fake.

936
00:45:54,734 --> 00:45:57,300
Just a man reaching
for the moon...

937
00:45:57,367 --> 00:45:59,534
or anything else
a million miles away.

938
00:45:59,601 --> 00:46:02,801
A million miles...

939
00:46:02,868 --> 00:46:05,901
a million dollars.

940
00:46:05,968 --> 00:46:07,234
Same difference, isn't it?

941
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:12,033
You coward.
You fancy-pants coward, you!

942
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,133
(Glory shrieks)

943
00:46:21,701 --> 00:46:23,734
He ain't good enough
to worry about; let him die.

944
00:46:29,734 --> 00:46:32,267
I said let him die!

945
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:33,534
Let me go!

946
00:46:36,267 --> 00:46:38,000
Come any nearer,
I'll shoot her in the back!

947
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:49,934
Why doesn't he shoot?

948
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,367
'Cause Thorne can
still kill the girl.

949
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,100
Now, you clear out of here.
Clear out of here!

950
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:24,801
(gagging, grunting)

951
00:47:41,534 --> 00:47:44,133
Hoss... Hoss!

952
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,133
You all right?

953
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,133
(muttering):
Yeah...

954
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,367
Always said he had
a hard head, Pa.

955
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:53,801
He's dead.

956
00:47:53,868 --> 00:47:58,634
He's dead, isn't he?

957
00:47:58,701 --> 00:48:00,334
He came here to
strike it rich,

958
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,934
find a bonanza,
and now he's dead.

959
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,067
He found it.

960
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:09,434
He found his bonanza.

961
00:48:09,501 --> 00:48:11,834
He found it
just as he died.

962
00:48:13,801 --> 00:48:18,801
And that's better than never
finding it at all, isn't it?

963
00:48:18,868 --> 00:48:20,934
Yes, Glory, it's better.

964
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,934
Much better.

965
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:34,200
BEN:
 <i>One place or another, there</i>
 <i>will always be a Mark Burdette.</i>

966
00:48:34,267 --> 00:48:36,868
 <i>And, for everyone like him</i>
 <i>who makes it,</i>

967
00:48:36,934 --> 00:48:40,033
 <i>a thousand will fail.</i>

968
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,367
 <i>But then,</i>
 <i>what are thousand-to-one odds</i>

969
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:46,667
 <i>for a man who looks up</i>
 <i>into the sky</i>

970
00:48:46,734 --> 00:48:49,200
 <i>and sees a bonanza?</i>
