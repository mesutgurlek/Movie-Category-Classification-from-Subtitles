I've found out from bitter experience
that when folks come for a hanging...

...all guns should be confiscated
until after...

if we discussed...

...the disposition of your ranch.
- Disposition?

216
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,040
Yes. Several weeks ago
I had a discussion...

217
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,237
...with Nathan about a possible sale.
I made him an offer.

218
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,790
- He seemed quite agreeable.
- The ranch is not for sale.

219
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,589
- You don't expect to live out there...
- I intend to keep it.

220
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,035
But you don't intend to run it.

Whether or not I succeed
in operating it, Mr. Carter...

00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,788
Well, what about this big sheriff
and his bunch?

460
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,110
Think he's gonna cross the border?

461
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,318
A South Texas sheriff who once
rode with Nathan Bedford Forrest.

462
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,393
A man who was made a fool of
in his own town.

463
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,755
He'll cross it.

464
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,469
If there's something
you know that we don't...

465
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,837
...I think you'd better tell us
what it is. You're with us.

466
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,028
Whatever happens to us happens to you.
Maybe even more so.

467
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,028
The country we have been through
between here and the Rio Grande...

468
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,192
...is patrolled by the federales.

469
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,638
From here to south
is the territorio bandolero.

470
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,917
Well, what's that,
"territorio bandolero"?

471
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:43,234
Bandit country.
They kill every gringo they can find.

472
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,474
- You don't look too worried.
- I am not a gringo.

473
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,476
Well, there's a town called
Sabinas just south of here.

474
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,349
- It is a three-day ride.
- We'll be safe there.

475
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,988
The sheriff won't follow us
that deep in.

476
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,071
He will follow.

477
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,390
What makes you so certain?

478
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,439
Because you have something
he has wanted for a long time.

479
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,149
- What's that?
- Me.

480
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:51,039
Four, maybe five hours.

481
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,629
This is the first time I have been
in my country since I left.

482
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,917
I always knew
I would come back again...

483
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,514
...but not quite this way.

484
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:23,557
How'd you come to marry
your husband, Mrs. Stoner?

485
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,439
He bought me, Mr. Bishop.

486
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,797
He found me in the backroom
of a cantina.

487
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,953
He liked me, and he bought me.

488
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,678
He gave my father five cows
and a gun.

489
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,037
It made my father the richest man
in our village.

490
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,434
Did you ever come to love him?

491
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,072
No.

492
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,194
But he was kind to me.

493
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,999
He was considerate.

494
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,154
And he took me from something
I never felt a part of.

495
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,080
He gave me a home.

496
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,112
Now here I am.

497
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:10,872
Well, from the looks of you, Mrs. Stoner,
you have a long way yet to go.

498
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,920
- Want some coffee?
- No.

499
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,911
Excuse me.

500
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,879
Mace, if you're ever alone
with Pop and his little boy...

501
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,713
...don't you turn your back on them.
- I know.

502
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,269
I can't decide which of us
they hate the most.

503
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,597
- Oh, it's you.
- I think you're right.

504
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,875
Mace, I ain't had a chance to tell you,
but it sure is real good to see you again.

505
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:24,113
And sometimes I think back
to how it used to be with you and me.

506
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,716
- You remember when...?
- Dee, that was yesterday.

507
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,957
Now, let's talk about today.

508
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,317
All right. What about today?

509
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,950
Now, why do you ride
with men like these?

510
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,195
Oh, I don't know. I just got used to it,
I guess, through the years.

511
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,750
You know, you begin to go one way
and keep on going that way...

512
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,115
...pretty soon, there's no other way.

513
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,675
You really believe that?

514
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,358
No, I guess not.

515
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,670
BABE: You sure are pretty.
- Pretty.

516
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,997
A pretty woman ain't good
for nothing but smelling sweet...

517
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,469
...and laying around the house.

518
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,273
Just so pretty.

519
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,359
Is it after a little kiss you are, Babe?
Oh, he's a great kisser, ma'am.

520
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,318
He's the best damn lady-kisser
in the whole of Texas.

521
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,879
[MEN LAUGHING]

522
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,156
Leave the woman alone.

523
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,679
Oh...

524
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,389
Hell, he wouldn't harm a hair
on her head, laddie.

525
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,479
She's a lady. Treat her like one.

526
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,190
It's time you got some sleep.

527
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,754
How far are we going, July?

528
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,797
I mean, are we just gonna...

529
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,633
...keep following them
till we come up on them...

530
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,711
...or what?
No matter how far they go?

531
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,552
That's right.

532
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,029
Suppose they just keep
going on forever?

533
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,555
Then we'll just keep going on forever.

534
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,711
What if we lose them?

535
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,998
There's only a couple of places
they could be headed.

536
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,754
There's only a couple of places
with water.

537
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,115
I won't lose them.

538
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:43,236
I'll find them, or I'll find their bones,
but I won't lose them.

539
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,670
HAWKINS:
Hold up, July!

540
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,231
This don't make sense no more, July.

541
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,876
- What don't make sense, Hawkins?
- We've come too far already.

542
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,794
Ain't no telling where we'll end up,
dead most likely, if we keep going.

543
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,234
You wanna turn back?

544
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,313
Wanting ain't part of it.
I'm turning back.

545
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,710
Anybody going with me?

546
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,315
Ain't nobody coming with me?

547
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,397
Maybe he's right, Johnson.

548
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,519
It don't make no sense no more.
I mean, it just don't make sense.

549
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,436
Goodbye, Ross, Hawkins.

550
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,435
HAWKINS:
You coming with us?

551
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,269
It's not the Bishop gang he's after now,
it's the Stoner woman.

552
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,032
Just like Carter said.

553
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,318
Hey! Wait up there! Wait for me!

554
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,352
What are you hurrying so for? That sheriff
can't go any faster than we can.

555
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,238
Are you giving out, Pop?

556
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,315
Oh, it's just that I don't see no sense
in hurrying, that's all.

557
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,473
So the old bastardo is not as tough
as he smells.

558
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,915
How can two brothers be so different?

559
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,356
Who, Mace? Oh, he believes
in the goodness of his fellow man.

560
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,670
He's never seen it,
but he believes in it.

561
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,910
I don't believe in it.

562
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,594
- What do you believe in?
- I believe in myself.

563
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,548
You fool nobody but yourself.
And I don't believe you even do that.

564
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,632
You really think you had a hard life,
don't you, Dee?

565
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,314
- You don't understand.
- No?

566
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,631
What would you know about
having to scrape for a living?

567
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,109
I could tell you a lot
about the hard life...

568
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,669
...but you'd have to live it
to understand it.

569
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,478
Yes, I believe that.

570
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,956
CORT:
Johnson!

571
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,590
We ain't going no further. This is it.

572
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,075
We're turning back.

573
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,637
- All of you?
- All of us.

574
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,349
- You just ain't gonna find them.
- I'll find them.

575
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,229
Do you know how big this country is?
Why, it just swallowed them up.

576
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,709
- For all we know, they...
- Now, who's missing?

577
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,475
We came into that pass with 10 men.
I count eight of us now.

578
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,958
Clyde Anderson ain't with us, July.

579
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,118
Wade Phillips is missing too.

580
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,159
July.

581
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,869
All right, Cort, you and the men can
ride back home if you want to.

582
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,235
Course, that's the only way.

583
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,358
Unless you wanna ride
50 miles around.

584
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,553
All right, then.
You stay here till we get back.

585
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,711
Stay where you are.
You wouldn't recognize him anyway.

586
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,151
I reckon the other one's
around here somewhere.

587
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:41,950
- The Indians, July?
- No, bandits.

588
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,157
If you wanna ride for home,
you leave right now from here.

589
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:52,108
I'll understand. I'll tell the others
I sent you home to report.

590
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,199
I'll stay with you, July.

591
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,239
Now, you don't have to.
I just want you to know that.

592
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,231
No, I'll stick.

593
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,550
Then if anybody ever says to me:

594
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,508
"Did you ride all over Mexico
with July Johnson?"

595
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,114
I can say to him, "Yep...

596
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:14,033
...I rode all over Mexico
with July Johnson."

597
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,669
You're a good boy. I always said it.

598
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,077
You stop picking your nose, boy.
It ain't mannerly.

599
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,710
- You had no call to do that.
- Now, none of your lip.

600
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,952
You're raising up your boy
to be a good Christian, I see.

601
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,793
POP: I'm learning him
what my pa learned me.

602
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,872
The Almighty rest his damn bones.

603
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,999
There's three things
a man ought never do:

604
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,790
Spit in church, scratch himself
in front of his ma...

605
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,875
...and pick his nose. Yes, sir.

606
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,830
That's what my pa learned me,
and it stood me in good stead.

607
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,790
I don't imagine your pa
ever mentioned...

608
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:13,236
...shooting people and burning houses
and things like that.

609
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,228
I'm talking about mannerly things,
Mr. Bishop.

610
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,392
I ain't talking about making a living.

611
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,788
Oh.

612
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,910
What the hell, Bishop?

613
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,230
You were leaning on my saddle,
Mr. Chaney.

614
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,595
You lean on your own saddle.

615
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,320
Babe, get out there
and see if anything's moving.

Dee.

617
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,398
- Something wrong?
- Things have been wrong a long time.

618
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:55,438
Don't you think it's about time
we have a talk?

619
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:00,628
- Well, I'll tell you the truth...
- Yeah, liars always start that way.

620
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,030
No, Mace, I'll tell you the truth.

621
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,237
I can't remember a single instance
where talking's ever...

622
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,674
...gotten me anyplace.

623
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,549
But go ahead. Tell me what you wanna
talk about, maybe I'll join you.

624
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,554
All right. I wanna talk about us
having a place of our own.

625
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,109
Our own ranch.
How's that sound to you?

626
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,111
Not worth a rooster without a hen.

627
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,397
How come? Seems to me
I can remember back to a time...

628
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:26,028
...you wanted a place
of your own awful bad.

629
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,589
That was before the war.
We were younger then.

630
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,352
Well, not that much younger.

631
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,829
Young enough to think
about a good woman.

632
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,039
You know how long it's been since
I been with a woman I could respect?

633
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,836
I may not be good, but I sure do know
what good's supposed to be.

634
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,669
We were young enough back in
those days to think about children.

635
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,348
You're not saying
you're too old to be a father?

636
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:53,433
I'm just saying you reach a time
when all them things are lost to you.

637
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,036
They're not lost to you, Dee.
They're not lost.

638
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,590
You may have thrown some of them
away. They're not lost to you.

639
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,273
DEE:
Get up, Babe.

Get up!

642
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,277
Honest, Dee, I wasn't gonna do
nothing but kiss her.

643
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,954
Well, what's wrong
with a little old kiss?

644
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:54,032
Ain't nothing wrong
with a little old kiss, Dee.

645
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,634
A little old kiss never hurt nobody.

646
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,037
From now on, you and me are gonna be
close together whether you like it or not.

647
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,560
I can't stand the thought
of something like him...

648
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,790
...with his hands
on something like you.

649
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,235
I thought he was your friend.

650
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,597
He is, but that don't make him
any less disgusting.

651
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,877
Matter of fact,
all my friends are disgusting.

652
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,917
You take Pop, for instance.

653
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,958
He was due to be shot
the day he was born.

654
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:06,033
And that heart of his is nothing
but a festering sore.

655
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:09,710
His kid, he's something, ain't he?

656
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,549
If you feel that way about them,
why are you with them?

657
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,870
I know where they stand.

658
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,918
I've never known
where respectable people stood.

659
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,117
Maybe they don't know themselves.

660
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,752
You say the sheriff's
always wanted you?

661
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,832
He is a good man.

662
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,515
I...

663
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,797
I reckon he's got you
all to himself now.

664
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,909
He's a good man,

I was just thinking. We'd make
a perfect pair, you and me.

668
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,318
I'm broke, without a woman...

01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,358
...and you're rich and without a man.

670

- This ain't Sabinas, is it, laddie?
- Is this what you brung us to?

671
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,876
DEE: This is the town.
MACE: Why, it's a ghost.

DEE: Looks that way, Mace.
Sure does look that way.

MACE: A lot of horses
through here lately, Dee.

674
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,152
Maybe not more than a day or so.

675
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,314
Mostly barefoot.

This is your country. What do you
think happened to these people?

677
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,913
Bandoleros.

678
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,715
They demand too much of the people.

679
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,440
When they grow tired
of being raided, they leave.

680
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,079
As they have done here.

681
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,198
You mean to say a whole town
just packs up and leaves...

682
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,679
...and never comes back?

683
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,070
Well, sometimes
they go to a larger town...

684
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:17,755
...where they can be protected
by the soldiers of Benito Juarez.

685
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:23,040
Mace, we'll put up over in that cantina.
That's the best place around.

01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,795
What do you plan on doing now, Dee?

687
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,158
Well, I'll just rest up here
a few days...

...ride on to Hidalgo for supplies
and push on to Matamoros.

I got friends in Matamoros.

Well, what about Mrs. Stoner?

Mace, you think we could
make a go of it in Montana?

Dee, there's a town up there
called Missoula.

- Prettiest place you ever saw.
- What about the Indians?

694
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,195
And the Rockies, they're snowcapped,
and the slopes are forested...

695
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,557
...and there are lots of lakes and...
- What about the Indians?

696
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,551
And there's deer in Montana, Dee.

Ain't there no Indians in Montana?

Well, a few.

- Well, they're around.
- What else, Mace?

- Listen, Dee...
- What else?

...and Chippewa.
- Some Cree?

Yes. Yes, there are Cree in Montana.

And the Shoshone and the Kootenai
and the Stoney.

I'm tired, Mace. Bone-tired.

having a good breakfast.

some cool, clean sheets.

MACE:
Well, what way is that, Mr. Chaney?

726
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:22,070
This way. The way we know.

727
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,674
The way we growed.

728
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,833
Well, now, that may be so for you,
but for my brother, it's different.

729
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,958
I don't care if he is your brother.
The son of a bitch...

01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,476
Now...

731
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,630
...before you apologize, I'm gonna
tell you something, Mr. Chaney.

732
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,475
My brother and I are the sons
of an honest dirt farmer.

733
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,638
A man who slaved all his life
from sunup to sundown...

734
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,712
...and never took time
except to deliver his children...

735
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,192
...and go to meeting on Sunday.
A man who died of old age at 45...

736
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,512
...and who never saw more than
$ 10 at one time in his whole life.

737
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,877
We're the sons of a woman
that married him for his goodness...

01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,031
...because she was good!

739
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:13,239
And now you can apologize
for slandering my family, Mr. Chaney.

01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:16,233
I'll blow your head off.

I'm sorry, Mr. Bishop.

744

01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,472
Why shouldn't she have me?

01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:26,589
Well, I don't know.
It's just, she might not want you.

No, July, it's just...

Well, because you want her
doesn't mean that...

- Roscoe, I just don't.

a good boy all of these years.

01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,990
Jeeters.

763
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:16,711
Well, I reckon I'll go spell him.

764
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,792
MACE: Well, there's another one'll
never make it to Matamoros.

765
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,918
DEE: How many does that make?
- Three.

766
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:18,835
Looks to me like we'll be
mostly walking when we leave.

767
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,912
You two have gotten pretty close,
haven't you?

768
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:30,232
- Nothing's been said.
- Well, nothing has to be said.

769
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:34,393
It's just a feeling, Mace.
You know, it's just a feeling, but...

770
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,437
But what?

771
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,433
I don't know if she has
the same feeling.

772
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,239
Have you thought about asking her?

773

- Asking?
- Dee...

774
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,315
...I know you don't believe in talking...

775
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:50,438
...and you've said that talking
never got you anywhere...

776
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,273
...but how are you ever gonna
find out anything...

777

...from anybody if you don't talk?

There will be coffee soon.

779
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:20,189
- I wanna ask you something.
- Yes?

780
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:23,875
I know I've done you real wrong...

781
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,708
...and even if I wanted...

782
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,872
...it's kind of late for apologizing.

783

in this whole world...

784

...why you wouldn't like to
step on something like me...

785
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:41,108
...but do you think you could ever
take to a man who...

786
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:45,990
...dragged you from your home
and done you the way I done you?

787
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,833
Well, I'll be damned.

788
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,276

- Nothing.

789

Oh, well, you two are gonna be
very happy.

790
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,472
Mace, what'd she mean by that?

791
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,552
She just looked at me, hugged me.
Didn't say nothing.

792
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,199
Oh, boy.

793

Dee, you're so dumb.

- Yes, you are.

795
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:32,199
- How'd you like a knock in your teeth?
- No, listen to me, Dee.

796
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:35,033
Do you wanna go up to Montana
with me or don't you?

797
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,873
Do you wanna help me build
our spread up there?

798
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,793
- I reckon, yeah.
- And the children, what about them?

799
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,871
- What children?
- Children of your own.

800
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,270
The ones you used to want.
What about them?

801
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,079
And her? Do you want her
to go with you to Montana?

802
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:51,471
- It'd be right nice, yeah.
- Well, then go and tell her.

803
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:56,111
You're right. That's right, Mace.
Now, why didn't I think of that?

ROSCOE:
Bishop, close the door.

805

01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,914
All right, tell them it's over, Roscoe.

Now, just so we understand
one another...

808

...you make one move
I don't like, and I'll kill you.

809
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,594
Now, what's your real name?

810

- Mace Bishop.
- Bishop. You're brothers.

811
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,234
You hear that, Roscoe?
They're brothers.

812
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:07,792
All right, brothers.
Where'd you hide the bank money?

813
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:12,112
- What bank money?
- Oh, it's gonna be that way, is it?

814
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:18,150
The $ 10,000 your brother there
took out of the Val Verde Bank.

815
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:21,955
$ 10,000 that he helped himself to
when the rest of you lit out.

816
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,628
That's what bank money.

817
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,236
You robbed a bank? You, Mace?

818
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,994
Well, Dee, the bank was there...

819
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:35,517
...and I was there, and there wasn't
very much of anybody else there...

820
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:38,752
...and it just seemed like
the thing to do.

821

You know, it's not like
something you never heard of.

Lot of people rob banks
for all sorts of different reasons.

823
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,797
You just walked into a bank
and helped yourself to $ 10,000...

824
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,349
...because it seemed like
the thing to do?

825
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:00,719
That's about the way it was, yeah.
That's as well as I can remember, yeah.

826
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,792
I don't know what to say to you.

827
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,878
Well, just don't say anything, Dee.
Don't say a word.

828
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,752
Why, you old bastard.

829
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:12,038
Now I know what you meant by,
"I might be able to get some money."

830
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,395
You planned on us...

831
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,358
We were gonna start our new spread
on stolen money?

832
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,193
Just a thought, Dee. Just a thought.

833
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:23,512
Well, I'm sure glad Mama
ain't around to hear all this.

Well, I sure wish Papa
was around to hear all this.

835

Wouldn't it be wonderful to see
$ 10,000 in Papa's hands?

836
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,434
$ 10,000 in the hands of a man...

837

...that didn't know there was that
much money in the whole world.

Now, there's no need to worry. There'll
be somebody on guard all night long.

848

but it's the best I could find.

01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:42,032
Yes.

915
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,875
- You'd have gone to Montana with us?
- Yes.

916
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,789
Did you hear that, Mace?

917
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,715
You here, Mace?

918
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,829
I'm here, Dee.

919
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,396
Babe was right.

920
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:12,677
A little old kiss never hurt nobody.

921
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,991
Dee?

922
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,876
Dee.

923
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,271
Did you mean what you said
to my brother?

924
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:01,798
For the first time in my life.

925
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,309
I'm glad.

926
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:07,870
I'm awful glad.

927
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,635
Because, you see,
Dee always wanted to believe.

928
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,189
He always...

929
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:19,955
He always wanted the right things.

930
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:27,357
But there was just something in him.

931
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,396
It just...

932
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:36,512
It was always hard for Dee to see
the light at the end of the trail.

933
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:01,994
It almost worked.

934
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,595
MARIA:
No one will even know who lies here.

935
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:02,796
Does it matter?

936
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:05,311
Perhaps not.
