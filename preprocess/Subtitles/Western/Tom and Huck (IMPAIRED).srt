Tom.!

Becky.

- [ Panting ]
- [ Tom ] I think we lost him.

[ Screaming ]

938
01:20:34,191 --> 01:20:38,321
[ Tom ]
It's One-eyed Murrell.

939
01:20:38,395 --> 01:20:41,853
He must've been hiding here
when the army came to get him.

940
01:20:41,932 --> 01:20:46,596
Looks like he got lost
and slowly... died.

941
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:48,638
Come on.

942
01:20:48,705 --> 01:20:50,696
Please be careful.

943
01:20:50,774 --> 01:20:55,609
- This way, Becky.
- Not so loud, Tom. He'll hear us.

944
01:20:58,282 --> 01:21:01,615
- [ Tom ] Number two under the cross.!
- What are you talking about?

945
01:21:11,195 --> 01:21:13,163
Becky, look!

946
01:21:21,038 --> 01:21:24,132
Go on.
I'm right behind you.

947
01:21:29,746 --> 01:21:31,839
Tom, come on.

948
01:21:31,915 --> 01:21:34,748
Find your father.
Bring him back.

949
01:21:35,986 --> 01:21:39,649
- It's dangerous.
- Hurry!

950
01:22:01,945 --> 01:22:03,970
[ Gasps ]

951
01:22:10,187 --> 01:22:14,214
Looks like I got it all.!
The treasure... and you.!

[ Screams ]

953
01:22:33,477 --> 01:22:35,377
Hey.!

954
01:22:50,961 --> 01:22:53,225
I know you.

955
01:22:57,434 --> 01:22:59,334
Huck?

956
01:23:00,637 --> 01:23:04,004
You're Pap Finn's boy.

957
01:23:04,074 --> 01:23:06,542
Blueberry!

958
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:08,840
Huckleberry.

959
01:23:10,948 --> 01:23:14,884
Your daddy was the best knife fighter
on the Mississippi.

960
01:23:14,952 --> 01:23:17,682
Did he teach you?

961
01:23:17,754 --> 01:23:19,722
He taught me.

962
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:21,451
Ah.

963
01:23:23,193 --> 01:23:26,720
Then let's see what you got, river trash.
[ Laughing ]

964
01:23:26,797 --> 01:23:29,766
- I ain't river trash!
- Come on!

[ Grunts ]

You got guts, boy!

967
01:23:38,709 --> 01:23:42,406
And in a minute,
they're gonna be on the ground.

968
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:45,539
Let's see you hit this!

No!

[ Screaming ]

971
01:24:32,524 --> 01:24:36,460
So, why'd
you come back, Huck?

972
01:24:38,063 --> 01:24:41,191
When a friend's in trouble,
you don't run away.

973
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:54,311
I guess Injun Joe
got his treasure.

974
01:24:54,379 --> 01:24:56,847
No, no, he didn't.

975
01:24:59,985 --> 01:25:04,786
The chest-- I couldn't lift it.
It was too heavy.

976
01:25:04,857 --> 01:25:08,759
I had to dump out
all the coins.

977

[ Muff]
Here comes our hero.! There he is.!

It's all right.
Come on out.

- [ Laughing ] You're a good boy!

Three cheers. Three cheers
for the richest boys in Hannibal.

Thank you,Judge.
Thank you.

Young man,
what's to become of you?

986
01:25:49,902 --> 01:25:52,632
Have you begun to think
about your future?

987
01:25:52,704 --> 01:25:55,639
No, ma'am.
I never really much had a future.

988

Well, you've got one now.
And you best begin!

You are indeed our hero, Tom.!

- Huck?
- What do you think?

Well, I think one of us
has lost his mind.

999
01:27:06,078 --> 01:27:10,208
Widow Douglas
is gonna adopt me.

The widow?

- Huck, say it ain't so.
- I gotta get goin'.

I promised the widow
I'd take her to the church social.

01:27:43,849 --> 01:27:47,046
Church social?

1009

All right, that's it!
That tears it!
