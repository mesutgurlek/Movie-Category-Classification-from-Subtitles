What parade?

319

You know, the one that usually
arrives before you do.

320

That nice tour manager...

and the reporters.

No. It's just me this time.

all that hair. Ha, ha.

- Oh, hell, I'm fine.

getting bigger and bigger.

- I saw you over in Dallas.

- That was quite an extravaganza.
- Why didn't you call me?

331

I love to hear you sing.

- But...
- It was loud, and I couldn't hear the words.

338
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,390
Without the words, there's no song.

want to play me a song sometime.

00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,003
You don't want my fans to
get suspicious, do you?

468

DAVE: You don't belong in there.

469
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,186
Lula, you better get over here.
We have a problem.

470
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:40,649
Peckerhead.

471
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,202
(WHOOPS)

472
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,957
Well, what do you think?

473
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:01,708
Buddy, we were real lucky. If there
was one glitch with the tape...

474
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:04,878
- ...if Bobby Louis had come much closer...
- BUDDY: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

475
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,591
Hell, aren't you
even gonna thank me?

476
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:11,885
Yes.

477
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,224
Yes, of course, I am.

478
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:17,185
- Thank you.
- Good. Then we can...

479
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:18,895
We can go celebrate.

480
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,484
Lula.

481
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,613
The guys in the band would
like to have a word with you.

482
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,913
Get him out of these clothes
before someone sees him.

483
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,878
You bet.

484
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,296
Ah, hell.

485
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,254
You guys were great tonight.

486
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,923
What the hell was Buddy
Jackson doing out there?

487
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,765
Why didn't you just cancel the
show, rain check it or something?

488
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,975
We can't play with a guy
who's lip-synching.

489
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:00,767
If we speed up or slow down, he can't
follow us or the audience will know.

490
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,276
Where is Dusty, anyway?

491
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:05,108
Buddy Jackson? Have you
lost your mind, Lula?

492
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,319
If I hadn't done what I did...

493
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,276
all of those people would
have gone home mad.

494
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,739
And we...

495
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,825
would all be out of a job.

496
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,165
Now, I am sure that
your ex-wives...

497
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,998
and Henry's five kids
and Keith's mother...

498
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,788
don't care if it was
Buddy, Dusty...

499
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:28,003
or King Kong up there on that stage,
so long as you get your paychecks.

500
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:32,298
You know I have always
taken care of you guys.

501
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:34,891
Now...

502
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:38,513
we've got a little time off before
we get to the big show in Vegas.

503
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:43,483
Everything will be
straightened out.

504
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,696
Dusty will be back.

505
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:53,824
I'm gonna tell you something. I need you
to promise me you will not say one word...

506
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,409
to anybody about what
happened tonight.

507
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,874
This is for Dusty's sake.

508
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:02,878
- And your own.
- For Dusty's sake?

509

I'm sick to death of your crap.

510
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:10,044
You had him hung up and
twisting in the wind.

511
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:14,848
He had nothing to do with this.
Tonight was all you, Lula.

512
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:17,009
He had nothing to do with this?

513
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,893
He walked out.

514
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:23,229
And he left you and me and everyone
in this room sitting on their thumbs.

515
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:27,187
- He had everything to do with it.
- You should have cancelled tonight.

516
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:31,236
I ain't gonna be a damn dancing
chicken in your freak show.

517
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,901
Get yourself another drummer.

I'm sorry. I was...

527
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,840
a little drunk last night.

Yeah, I think so.

Okay. Might as well
have some breakfast.

long on that pattern this morning.

little bit earlier, you know.

I'm kind of glad I won't be around
long enough to see it all go.

622
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:35,965
And Harley?

623
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:41,468
Well, Harley thinks she's going to
save it by winning at the rodeo.

624
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:51,393
Would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

625
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:18,045
You rope pretty good.

626
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:21,515
I've always wanted to
learn how to do that.

627
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:25,223
- Good luck.
- Any chance you'd give me some lessons?

628
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:31,233
Ha, ha, ha. J.W. Did you hear that? This
guy wants us to give him roping lessons.

629
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:34,151
DUSTY: I'll pay.

630
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,483
In advance.

631
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,243
In advance?

632
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,245
Yep.

633
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:54,540
Wondering if maybe you might want to
rent out that empty bunkhouse too.

634
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,677
I could pay room and board.
Maybe stay a little while.

635
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:01,513
Take some roping lessons.

636
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,307
Okay.

637
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:12,562
You want to buy a rope?

638
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,438
You mind telling me...

639
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:17,400
- why you can't stand still for one minute?
- All right.

640
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:21,442
I just don't believe you're telling
our problems to a perfect stranger.

641
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,402
Our problems with this ranch
are none of his business.

642
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:28,369
If he's such a perfect stranger, what
are you doing bringing him home?

643
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,454
He got knocked out
defending my honor.

644
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:33,416
Was I supposed to leave him
lying there on the ground?

645
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:36,957
- If you hadn't liked him, you would have.
- I do not like him.

646
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,842
Then why is he making
you so nervous?

647
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,552
I'll be right back.

648
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:06,824
What's he doing on a horse?

649
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:10,123
- Well, he bought it.
- He what?

650
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:14,582
- He's gonna be staying with us for a while.
- What?

651
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:18,165
For roping lessons and room
and board. He's paying.

652
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,925
What's your problem?

653
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,344
You like him, don't you?

654
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:28,011
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

655

his voice particularly strong...

657
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:39,486
Dusty delivered the performance of his
life last night in Shreveport Auditorium."

658
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,146
Idiots.

659
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:44,316
Idiots? Hell, they love me. They
think I'm better than Dusty.

660
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:45,608
Loved you?

661
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,411
They didn't even know it was you.

662
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,119
- Thank God they didn't.
- Maybe they should know that it's me.

663
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:56,498
Buddy...

664
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:00,086
you've got a lot of talent...

665
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:03,798
and someday people are gonna be
spending a lot of money to see you.

666
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,008
But these people paid to see Dusty.

667
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:09,015
So did the people in Vegas who
bought tickets for the show.

668
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,723
And what happens if
you don't find Dusty?

669
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:21,603
I will.

670
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,817
Uh-huh.

671
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,871
Grandma Ivy?

672
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,373
IVY: Who's there?

673
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,579
- Earl Blackstock.
- Who?

674
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,212
Earl Blackstock. Wyatt's friend.
You took us fishing.

675
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,088
I know who you are.

676
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,174
I just couldn't hear you.

677
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,964
Why don't we go over
here and sit down.

678
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,674
It's cooler over here.

679
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,555
You're looking well, ma'am.

680
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:52,012
Thank you. I'm feeling pretty good.

681
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,561
The rain is doing great
things for your flowers.

682
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,767
Yeah. They are pretty this year.

683
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:00,601
He's not here.

684
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:07,486
Tell you the truth, Grandma Ivy,
I'm pretty worried about him.

685
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,196
He took off and...

686
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:14,452
He's got all this pressure and people just
trying to get a piece of him, you know.

687
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,042
It ain't surprising.

688
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:22,380
But this one's different.
He missed a show and...

689
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:26,464
- That just ain't like him.
- Well, sometimes...

690
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,586
the tree grows too fast.

691
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,305
And the roots don't develop.

692
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:37,897
And sometimes you have to chop off the top
of that tree to let the roots catch up.

693
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:42,559
- But do you know where he's at?
- No.

694
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:46,150
I expect if you follow the
roots, you'll find him.

695
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,533
Grandma Ivy, in all the
years I've known you...

696
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:57,449
I've never heard you answer
a question directly.

697
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,458
There are no answers.

698
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,170
Only the search.

699
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:06,424
Yeah. Whatever that means.

700
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,255
It was great seeing you.

701
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:13,969
Yeah, you too.

702
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:16,551
- Take care now.
- I will.

703
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,136
Drive careful.

704
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:24,188
Earl. Don't you leave home,
now, without seeing your mama.

705
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,353
Yes, ma'am.

706
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:43,836
No. There's no sign of Dusty.

707
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:14,950
Go, go.

708
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:35,137
Come on.

709
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:39,221
Yes!

710
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:53,990

Dusty is working on some new
material for the Vegas show...

716
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:15,758
and he don't want to be disturbed
right now. Yeah. Okay.

717
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:19,474
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.
All right, bye.

718
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,565
- What's the problem now?
- It's Frankenstein.

719
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:31,770
He's saying we better take care of him
in case Dusty doesn't show up for Vegas.

720
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,906
Yeah. This morning he
asked me for a massage.

721
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:38,443
Come on, Lula, I don't have to put
up with that. I don't work for him.

722
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:42,785
I know, I know, I know.
But you guys do work for me...

723
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:46,243
and I want you to keep
him quiet and happy...

724
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:48,457
- ...just a few more days.
- Yes, ma'am.

725
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,122
And I don't want him talking
to anyone. Understand?

726
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:54,509
Yes, ma'am. I'm still not
giving him a massage.

727
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,469
Hi, there.

728
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,473

01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,142
Looks pretty nice, huh?

Well...

731
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:11,977
I think it'd look a whole lot better
without that price tag right there.

732
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,857
Oh.

733
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:20,948

for Vegas. Drop the cornball stuff.

735
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,949
Dusty will be back.

736
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:32,251
Come on, Lula. Dusty is a joke to people
on the cutting edge. He's a farce.

737
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:35,713
Since when do you know anything
about the cutting edge?

738
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:45,727
I talked to this reporter last night. She
wanted to know the roadie's view of Dusty.

739
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:49,480
She said she thought the
whole show was passé.

740
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,650
What are you doing
talking to a reporter?

741

She bought me a drink.

742
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:58,444
You know, I got to
thinking afterwards...

743
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:00,946
here I am saving the day...

744
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:04,033
yet I'm not getting anything.
No one even knows it's me.

745
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:06,163
No one's gonna know it either.

746
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,162
- That was our agreement.
- I know.

747
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:13,956
But everything happened so fast, I didn't
have a chance to think it through.

748
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:15,836
I mean...

749
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:20,636
I think I ought to get a
recording contract, at least.

750
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:23,138
And money.

751
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,307
How much money?

752
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:29,770

it down to the station this trip.

Yeah.

759
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,459
He's gonna be real
disappointed too.

760
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,628
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

761
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:57,878
No, I'm gonna send you
and the guys some CDs.

no more light shows.

it was all about the music.
We did it because we loved it.

980

Lately, it seems like it's
just for the smoke...
