Loved by the buffalo had
traveled across the nations,

4
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,165
but had not yet found the prophet

5
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,400
who could make false the terrible
vision of the white man's wheel.

6
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:54,565
He sought the signs that would lead
him to his people's salvation...

7
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,300
but found only traces of those who had
come before and vanished into the darkness.

8
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,107
Let the ribbons of the
union pacific railroad

00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:28,506
Omaha, Nebraska Territory
December 1, 1863

10
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,465
unfurl from this immortal point

11
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,800
until they reach the shores
of the mighty pacific!

12
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,600
I have in my hand a telegram
just received from washington...

13
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,800
Which I shall read to you.

14
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,700
It says,

15
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,365
"when this great task shall have been done,"

16
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,400
"disunion shall be rendered
forever after impossible."

17
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,000
"There will be no fulcrum for the
lever of treason to rest upon."

18
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,900
Thomas, jackson, stop shirkin'
and set that wheel on the bench.

19
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,700
They say it's gonna take
10 years to finish the line.

20
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,667
I'd sure like to ride it one day.

21
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:25,600
One train from atlantic to pacific?

22
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:26,600
Whoo-hoo!Ha ha!

23
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,300
Maybe they'll finish it, maybe they won'T.

24
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,000
If there's money to be made, I fully
intend to see our family gets its share.

25
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,300
I want to see 20 wheels
on that wall by sundown.

26
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,200
Come on, pop, you're talkin'
like the railroad's already here.

27
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,165
Listen to me.

28
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,565
We have to make ready.

29
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,700
Haven't I taught you anything, boy?

30
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Pardon me, sir.

31
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,000
My name is clara wheeler.

32
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,100
My father's name was samson wheeler.

33
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,800
You can't turn out an orphan, daniel.

34
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:02,800
The poor thing has no one.

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll send her back east where she belongs.

36
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,000
And where will she find
safety in the middle of a war?

37
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,200
We've heard nothing from
wheelerton these many months.

38
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,900
There are places in st.Jo,

39
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,600
across the river, where she
can be with her own kind.

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It is our christian duty
to care for that child.

41
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,465
We're the only people that she has left.

42
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,800
Woman, she's not even
samson's natural child.

43
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:26,100
Just a foundling he took in...

44
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,067
as was his wont.

45
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,000
We owe her nothing.

46
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,565
What?

47
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,100
Ma's right.

48
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,265
Excuse me.

49
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,400
We just can't turn our backs
on someone lookin' for our help.

50
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:42,600
Not after what she's been though.

51
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Think if it was one of us.

52
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,065
Charity always costs those that give it.

53
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,600
So you'd bear that burden
upon yourself, I take it?

54
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:54,300
Be responsible for her?

55
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,765
Yeah.I will.

56
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,700
And you will answer for
her, for good or ill?

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's right.

58
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,700
Very well, then.

59
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,100
Robert, why does she get to sleep in my bed?

60
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,665
Well, because clara's our guest, lilly.

61
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,095
We're all gonna have to
learn to make sacrifices.

62
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,500
Really, the floor is fine.

63
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,900
There's comfort in just
having a roof over my head.

64
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:49,900
Mother says you can wear some of her
things until she can make you some new ones.

65
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,565
Please tell her not to bother.

66
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,200
I know how to work a sewing machine.

67
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,800
All right.

68
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,700
What you got there?

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,200
Did you do these?

70
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,800
I used to have time for frivolities.

71
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,100
I thought the world was a pretty place,
but it's not.

72
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,300
Well...let me know if you need anything.

73
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll just...I'll be in my room.

74
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:21,800
-Thank you.
-Yes

75
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,900
Mother, take off!

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,100
I'll tell you when it's over.

77
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:46,100
God be with you.

78
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,550
-Go on.Git!

79
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:48,900
Come on!

80
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,300
Aah!

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Oh, my god!

82
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,700
Aah!

83
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,000
Clara! Clara!It's ok!You're ok……

84
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,600
You're ok.

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,900
You're ok.

86
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,165
Ohh!

87
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,500
What's wrong with her?

88
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,950
You're ok.

89
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:07,700
You stay here.

90
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,950
Outside Sacramento, California
March, 1864

91
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:15,165
As governor of the state of california,

92
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,400
I am proud to welcome you to this glorious
celebration of our american industry.

93
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,600
We of the central pacific railroad
have come far these last few months.

94
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:29,600
Further, I might add,
than our competitors on the union pacific.

95
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,400
Bravo.

96
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,800
The great race has now begun.

97
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,865
We may now look forward to the day

98
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,250
when the pacific will be bound
to the atlantic with bands of iron

99
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:43,842
that shall consolidate and
strengthen our ties of nationality

100
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:47,400
and advance with giant strides
the prosperity of our nation.

101
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:48,400
Hear, hear!

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,400
Can you imagine that?

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,800
We can have breakfast in san francisco,

104
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,800
supper in carson city, all the way
to the mississippi in just 3 days.

105
00:07:57,835 --> 00:07:59,600
It is truly remarkable.

106
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,600
It's all changing so fast.

107
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,300
The wheels of progress, my dear,

108
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,865
the wheels of progress.

109
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,700
It is our destiny to smash it asunder!

110
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,100
Shoot, 1, 2, 3.

111
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,700
[Speaking lakota language]

112
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,500
[Speaking lakota language]

113
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,300
What are you saying, my dear?

114
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,200
Oh...something my mother said
to me before we were married.

115
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,600
Her world always seemed
so different than mine.

116
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,900
I'd like to see it sometime.

117
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,200
I don't see any reason
why we shouldn't see some of it sometime.

118
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,500
Ethan...

119
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:49,365
hmm?

120
00:08:49,400 --> 00:09:19,400
-Do you mean it?
-Absolutely.

121
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
That's what we've always said we'd do.

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,800
We could catch the next stage to denver.

123
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,500
Really?

124
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,300
You're brilliant, you know that?

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,800
And exquisitely beautiful.

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,500
You're truly one of the most
wonderful women I've ever known.

127
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,600
And there've been so many, my love.

128
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,200
Oh! -Ethan! I love you, too.
-Mmm.

129
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,100
My daughter margaret and her husband ethan
were not alone in their wandering.

130
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,800
My son abe joined the ranks of jobless men
(Central Pacific Railhead Sierra Navadas)

131
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,950
who threw their lot in
with the central pacific

132
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:27,700
in its 1,000-mile journey
east from sacramento.

133
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,365
By the time it was finished,

134
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,264
the railroad would profoundly
impact my children's lives.

135
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,700
Put your backs into it!

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,400
Come back here, chief.

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,700
The name's abe.

138
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,300
One of the lost tribes of israel, are we?

139
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,965
Well, my old testament friend,

140
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,400
have you had a look at the
offering you just brought me?

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,700
We're trying to keep the grade level.

142
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,765
This won't do it.

143
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,600
You'll have to clean it up.

144
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,900
That's your job.

145
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,300
Fight!

146
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,300
Hit him!

147
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,700
Damn gandy dancers!

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,100
That'll cost you sons
of whores a day's wages!

149
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,300
That goes for all of you! Now, move it!

150
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,600
Mr. Strobridge, get over here!

151
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,900
You men, get back to work!

152
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,465
I will not tolerate
mistreatment of these men!

153
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,000
You can't speak to them as though you
were speakin' to gentlemen, mr. Crocker.

154
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,900
They're as near as brutes as they can get.

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,784
Now, most of these micks will be off to the

156
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:44,900
gold fields as soon as
they can earn a grubstake.

157
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,900
We started with 5,000 men.

158
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:47,500
Now?

159
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,900
I got less than 600.

160
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,100
Well, there seems to be a surplus
of chinese in san francisco.

161
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:59,100
They're said to be very reliable workers.

162
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,600
I will not boss chinese! Damn it!

163
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,400
Denver, Colorado Territory
September, 1864

164
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:13,219
Good God.

165
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:14,165
What happened?

166
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,300
How did this happen?

167
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,800
This is not right.

168
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,800
You got that right.

169
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,600
Look ye upon this outrage
to all civilized people!

170
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,700
The hungate family...

171
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,700
cruelly murdered on their own land...

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,500
land only 25 miles to
the east of our fair city.

173
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,500
Sacrificial lambs slaughtered
by the godless cheyenne dog soldiers...

174
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,400
their bodies cast like joseph's into a well.

175
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,100
Who's this speaker?

176
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Colonel chivington, the fightin' parson.

177
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,365
Whooped the greycoats at glorieta pass,

178
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,600
and he's gonna give these redskins a hidin'!

179
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,600
Brothers and sisters of colorado.

180
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,400
Our territory sits poised
just on the cusp of statehood.

181
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,300
But there can be no statehood without order.

182
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:06,417
Hear, hear.

183
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:07,500
Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,065
And there will be no order

185
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,965
as long as a single savage is allowed

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,800
to occupy one sacred
inch of our precious soil!

187
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
All right.

188
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,700
Now, there is hope.

189
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,765
Governor evans has authorized me

190
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,000
to muster a new regime for our self-defense.

191
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,500
Yeah!Yeah!

192
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,100
Now...

193
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,100
who of you...

194
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,221
will join me in this righteous enterprise?

195
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,200
Hyah!

196
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,200
Grisly business, that.

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,300
Why must you insist on making record of it?

198
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,000
You know that's what we do.

199
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,400
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,800
I was just thinking...

201
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,300
helluva price to pay for some mangy cows.

202
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,700
They say old man hungate was out
lookin' for strays when they butchered him.

203
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:10,765
Yes, thank you kindly.

204
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,850
I'd--if you could keep quiet?

205
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:12,900
Beggin' your pardon, ma'am.

206
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,200
You just leave everything
to colonel chivington.

207
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,100
When he wants to get somethin' done,

208
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,500
you bet it gits did.

209

214
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,900
Leave her!

215
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,500
No! Don't kill him!

what's happen?  What are they doing to us?

231
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,800
I think they're taking us to their camp.

232
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,200
I won't let anything happen to us.

233
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,600
Balck Kettle's Camp,
Sand Creek, Colorado

234
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,600
They are treating us as
honored guests, not captives.

235
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,300
Guess they admire you here.

236
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,000
You're one of them.

237
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,400
No.

238
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,500
I've spent most of my life
denying my mother's blood.

239
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,700
It's all right.

240
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,200
Take these.

241
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,500
It's all right.

242
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,900
I'll be here.

243
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,600
Tell me about this magic box.

244
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,400
We call it a camera.

245
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,500
Cam-camera.

246
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:28,867

00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:30,200
Camera.

248
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,100
The white man's words, they have no, um...

249
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,800
um..music in them.

250
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,300
You speak them very well.

251
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,900
So many white man come.

252
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,300
They fill our land with their noises.

253
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,300
I do not like their language.

254
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,600
Their words...

255
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,400
they have no meaning.

256
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,900
Walkin' under white man's road,
as you have done, it is difficult.

257
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,800
The, um, spirit...

258
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,900
does not know where to rest.

259
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,200
Sometimes I...

260
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,700
I feel a hole in my heart.

261
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,000
Ah, the white men are like locusts.

262
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,400
They fly so thick that the
whole sky looks like a snowstorm,

263
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:22,800
and we are like small buffalo
herds who have scattered.

264
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,900
They will keep coming.

265
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,400
They're building a railroad.

266
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,200
It will carry them from
one ocean to another.

267
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,500
That one over there.

268
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,900

279
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,365
When the white father told those of us

280
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,100
who wished peace to come
to this place, we came.

281
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,800
But there is nothing here for us.

282
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,100

283
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,100

they have brought about this trouble.

293
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,300

00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,200

310
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,400
We want to take good
tidings home to our people.

311
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,000
I want...

312

all the chiefs of the soldiers
to understand that we are for peace.

That we may not be mistaken
by them for the enemy.

314
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,000
Governor evans and colonel
chivington have heard your words.

315
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,500
The governor and the father of all white
men in this territory will now speak to you.

We cannot live together on this land.

The war among the whites is nearly through.

318

The great father will have
nothin' to do with his soldiers

319
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:19,600
except send them out after the indians.

320
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,700
Your people must make their peace with us.

321
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,100

322
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,600
to keep my young men quiet,

323
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,100
but they do not always listen.

324
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,200
Well, by their rebellion,

325
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,100
they seek to help the great
co-traitors who make war on us.

326
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,000
No.

327
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,700
We do not fight the white man's war.

00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,400
All cheyenne...

329
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,400
have ears open.

330
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,100
White antelope proud to see all
white chiefs of this country.

331
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,300
Since I go washington
and receives this medal...

332
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,500
I have been proud to call
all white men brothers.

333
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,800
Whatever peace you make must be
with the soldiers, not with me.

334
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
We see now.

335
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,500
I am not a great war chief.

336
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,200
But in this country...

337
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,600
all the soldiers are under my command.

338
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,300
My rule of fighting,

339
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,600
whether it's the greycoats
from the south or the indians,

340
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,300
is to fight them until
they lay down all their arms

341
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:52,700
and submit to military authority.

342
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,400
When you are ready to do
that, then major wynkoop...

343
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,500
major wynkoop...

344
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,900
at ft. Lyon will see to all your needs.

347
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:21,699
Please, everybody, look this way.

348
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,900
That's no captive. She's one of them.

349
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,100
Black kettle, it is an honor
for me to present to you

350
00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:30,000
the flag of the united states.

351
00:27:30,035 --> 00:27:31,500
Everyone, very still.

352
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,700
With all due respect, gentlemen...

353
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,700
cheyenne don't want a war.

354
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,300
I believe their pledges to be sincere.

355
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,900
And what will I do with the third
colorado volunteers if we make peace?

356
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,300
The third was raised
primarily to kill indians.

357
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,700
Then they must kill indians.

358
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,000
The tall chief said as long as
this flag flies above our camp,

359
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,000
no soldiers will harm us.

360
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,900
Margaret light shines had
lifted the people's spirits

361
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:38,100
with the magic of the
white man's shadow box.

362
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,865
Now black kettle called on the young men

363
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,700
who remained behind to
search for the buffalo.

364
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,200
All right, men...the gates!

365
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,200
Major.

366
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,500
See that these men are fed
and given a place to rest.

367
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,200
We march on the hostiles
at sand creek tonight.

368
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,600
I've heard of no new provocation, sir.

369
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,065
Don't you know the cheyenne nation

370
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,400
is guilty of robbery, arson, murder, rape,
and fiendish torture?

371
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,365
Not even sparing women and children?

372
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,690
I feel it is right and honorable to use any

373
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:28,300
means under god's heaven
to end these outrages.

374
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:29,500
Including murder, colonel?

375
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,700
Where's sergeant owens?

376
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,500
Sir!

377
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,800
Post a ring of pickets around
the perimeter of this post!

378
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,800
Any man tryin' to leave
will be shot on sight!

379
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:41,000
Is that understood?

380
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:42,000
Yes, sir!

381
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,200
Damn any man in sympathy with the indian.

382
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,500
When will you leave?

383
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,200
Tomorrow.

384
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,800
You have brought us much happiness.

385
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,700
But it's good you should
return to your people.

386
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,200
Many white people will see the
cheyenne as they really are.

387
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,000
They will understand that
your spirits are peaceful.

388
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,100
I will keep this one.

389

Of course.

This is good medicine.

My husband and i can never repay
your the kindness you have shown us.

You go in peace, my granddaughter.

Off with your overcoats, men.

399
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,800
Oh, you'll fight better without 'em.

Yeah!  Yeah!

brothers and sisters have been slain,

Kill 'em all.

407
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,600
Scalp 'em all.

408
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,400
That's right!

Listen.  Listen. Take this.

Fasten it to the top of the flag.

As quickly as you can!

it won't be long before this enterprise
gets beyond the reach of any town.

are inclined to get restless.

why, then the town will
just have to come to them.

he's first to come out.

Sure heard stories about him.

484
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,400
They tamed so much of it,

I figure railroad will tame what's left.

I guess I just wanna see it
before it goes, that's all.

488

Let me see it with you.

You're all I have left.

00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,200
Then you'll help me?

493
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,000
I can't make promises.

494
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,100
-I'm gonna take 2 melds.
- Mm-hmm.

495
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,500
Dog star had once believed the white man
would someday leave the land.

496
00:41:31,535 --> 00:41:33,365
Black Hills,
Dakota Territory

497
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,000
Now, with his grandson white
bird and his son sleeping bear,

498
00:41:37,035 --> 00:41:40,500
he saw them come like a
prairie fire on a hot wind.

499
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,492
Many passed through the sacred ground with

500
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:47,400
the hope of the world
bent to the 4 directions,

501
00:41:47,435 --> 00:41:50,400
seeking the yellow stone
that made them crazy.

502
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:56,600
Dog star had heard how the long knives
repaid black cattle's promise of peace.

503
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,100
He feared that a similar
fate awaited his people.

504
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,500
Sioux promised to fight
until every white man

505
00:42:11,535 --> 00:42:13,600
was driven from their sacred land.

506
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,400
The bravest of these leaders sent his
messengers riding through the nation.

507
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,950
Dog star's brother running fox
answered the call to battle,

508
00:42:22,985 --> 00:42:26,500
and invited the great warrior
to speak to their village.

509
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,100
His name was makhpiya luta, red cloud.

510
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:40,900
[Speaking lakota language]

511
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,500
[Speaking lakota language]

512
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,000
Red cloud spoke.

513
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,865
and white crow, His son red lance,

514
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,800
and many young men were inspired
to follow him to protect their land.

515
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,500
Sleeping bear and white
bird also wished to fight,

516
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,400
but dog star had already
lost one son to the white man,

517
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,100
and did not wish to sacrifice another.

518
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,800
Keep 'em straight, boss!
Cape Horn,
Northern California

519
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,700
Celestials.

520
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,000
Worse than savages, you are.

521
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,300
Half-made men.

522
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,300
What do you know about
railroad construction?

523
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,900
They built the great wall
of china, didn't they?

524
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,000
Come on, get moving!

525
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:05,700
Quickie! Quickie!

526
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:06,565
Come on!

527
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,800
Keep it straight!

528
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,450
You got a problem?

529
00:44:17,485 --> 00:44:18,800
Men say you indian.

530
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,600
Yeah?  What of it?

531
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,100
Never seen indian.

532
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,600
Very afraid you eat them.

533
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,500
Well,I've never had a celestial before.

534
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,100
Might like to try me one.

535
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,700
Abe wheeler.

536
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,800
Chow ping.

537
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,500
What bad luck brings you out here,chow ping?

538
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,000
Before here,gum shan,gold mountain.

539

Fan gway steal claim.

540
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,400
Gold not for chinese,he say.

541
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,300
why?

542
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,900
A white ghost.

543
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,400
Demon.

544
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,850
Fan gway stand,talk,

545
00:45:00,885 --> 00:45:02,500

546
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,800
Call us coolies.

547
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,500
Chinese like indian.

548
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,900
Fan gway hit,

549
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,700

550
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,300
Come on,guys.

551
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,200
Keep 'em straight!

552
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,100
Incline 75 degrees!

553
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,765
That face is straight up.

554
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,800
We got a clear a shelf 3 miles
long across that bastard of a rock.

555
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,200
Your plan to accomplish this,mr. Strobridge?

556
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,500
Damned if I know,sir.

557
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,200
One-eye bossy man think road not possible.

558
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,700
Use very bad language,but road possible.

559
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:45,900
How?

560
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,700
I'll be.

561
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Now,if there's one thing the chinese
know something about, it's gunpowder.

562
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,750
Ready?!

563
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:30,700
Gung-hoy!

564
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Gung-hoy!  Gung-hoy!.........

565
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,900
Help!

566
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,500
Chow ping!.....

567
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,700
Come on,help me!

568
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,800
Chow ping!

569
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Good

570

Ft. Phil Kearny
Wyoming Territory
December 20, 1866

571
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,500
The white man's forts spread like
a stain across the people's land.

572
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,900
White crow and red lance join
the warriors of red cloud.

573
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,900
There they would fight to
remove any mark of the white man.

574
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,100
This would be a different kind
of war,  fought like no other.

575
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,000
It would be a war of watching,of waiting.

Captain,the supply train

00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,500
You are to support the supply
train,captain fetterman.

602
00:50:25,535 --> 00:50:27,265
Relieve it,and report back to me.

603
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,365
Under no circumstances are you to pursue

604
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,300
and engage the indians
over lodge trail ridge.

605

Is that understood?

606

Yes,sir.

Godspeed,captain.

Whoa.

610
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,800
Hold up!

611
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,900
That's lodge trail ridge,captain fetterman.

612
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,800
What's he doing?

613
00:51:31,300 --> 00:52:01,300

00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,700

7000 feet above sea level
February, 1867

620
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,500
We're never gonna break out of that rock.

621
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:44,500
We've been trying for a year.

622
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,500
Fan gway say

623
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,400
move mountain, but
mountain don't want to move.

624
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,400
That's white man's logic.

625
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,900
Don't try to understand it.

626
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,500
You'll go crazy trying.

627
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,300
You have people back where
you come from, chow ping?

628
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,200
Have wife in home village.

629
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,900
One day, I finish here.

630
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:15,100
Say to her, "you come now."

631
00:55:15,135 --> 00:55:16,100
Give her silk dress.

632
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,900
We going to live in tai fau.

633
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,565
Tai fau?

634
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,200
San francisco, right?

635
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,500
You learn chinese real good.

636
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,400
I've been studying your phrase books.

637
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,700
Learned how to write a
little of your alphabet.

638
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,800
You have village?

639
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,800
Americans don't belong to any one place.

640
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,000
Just when we get settled, we up and
get restless for something different.

641
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,200
I rode the pony express till it played out.

642
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,300
Never as free as when I
was on the back of a horse.

643
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,200
Nothing steady after that.

644
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,100
Why you stay now?

645
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,300
Never been part of something like this.

646
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,800
Something permanent.

647
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,600
Think maybe I'll see it
through, just this once.

648
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,400
Maybe I'm just a crazy
indian like they all say.

649
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,000
North Platte
Nebraska Territory
April, 1867

650
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,900
Once north platte had only been an
empty prairie 300 miles from omaha.

651
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,100
Ambitious men like daniel wheeler had
turned the wilderness into a boom town.

652
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:49,800
Carnivorous swarms followed the
railroad workers every step of the way,

653
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,000
devouring their weekly pay
faster than grasshoppers.

655
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,300

00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,200
Comin', pa!

657
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,200
Sure is flush times.

658
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,400
Hell on wheels.

659
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,800
You should've seen this
place before we civilized it.

660
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,465
I don't mind telling you, wheeler,

661
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:31,500
the union pacific finds the very presence
of a sinkhole like this a noxious affront.

662
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,700
I'd like to see you try
to stop it, casement.

663
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,800
You'd have a mutiny on your hands.

664
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,000
Might be wiser for you to start
thinking of us as informal partners.

665
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,165
You appropriated railroad land

666
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:48,200
for illicit purposes and then sold it
to other speculators at 5 times its value.

667
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,165
Don't bellyache to me if the union pacific

668
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,500
swells couldn't see the potential
of their own right-of-way.

669
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,000
Do not presume to lecture me
on what's good for the railroad.

670
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,300
No. That's for you.

671
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,100
You masters back east
don't need any lessons.

672
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,165
Government bonds

673
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,000
16,000 a mile for flatlands
graded and tracked.

674
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,600
32,000 a mile for foothills,

675
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,800
64,000 a mile  for mountains.

676
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,565
Tell me, casement,

677
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,200
how many so-called mountains

678
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,700
has the union pacific climbed thus far?

679
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:22,800
Ha ha ha!

680
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,100
You, sir, are a rank opportunist.

681
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,100
Welcome to north platte, sir.

682
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,000
King of the plains emporium
is the place for you.

683
00:58:36,035 --> 00:58:37,400
Best tables and the best liquor.

684
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,000
They got the best looking women, too.

685
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,300
Here, let me get that for you, sir.

686
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,800
There you go.

687
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,900
Give us this day our daily strangers.

688
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:54,762
-Hey.

689
00:58:55,315 --> 00:58:56,479
- I have your britches ready.

690
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,900
All right.

691
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,500
You'd never even know they were ripped.

692
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,600
5 cents, please.

693
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,300
Almost forgot.

694
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,965
Now those are getting pretty worn.

695
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,300
You ought to let me make you a new pair.

696
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,573
- Oh, yeah? You'd do that?

697
00:59:12,608 --> 00:59:13,400
- Yeah.

698
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,000
I'd like that.

699
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,300
I'll have to measure you.

700
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,800
Step right up.

701
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,300
Ow!

702
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,700
Put your arms out like this.

703
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,300
Well, sure looks like you're prospering.

704
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,365
If I save up enough money,

705
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,500
I can get my own shop and I won't
have to rent from your father anymore.

706
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:40,100
You deserve finer things, clara.

707
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,400
So do you.

708
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,500
Robert!

709
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,900
See ya.

710
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,600
You're needed at the shop.

711
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:58,600
Yes, sir.

712
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,300
Don't let me see you idling again.

713
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,950
Especially with that girl.

714
01:00:01,985 --> 01:00:03,100
That girl has a name, father.

715
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,900
It's clara!

716
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,200
About time you got used to saying it!

717
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,300
Those miscreants will not
trouble your establishment again.

718
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,700
What about my money, colonel?

719
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,700
Are you gonna make good these men's debts?

720
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,500
Good day, sir.

721
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,700
Soldiering in the west was
a lonely, miserable affair.

722
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,900
Some men deserted outright and
others fell into bad habits.

723
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,300
Before officers like george armstrong
custer could tame any indians,

724
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,100
they first had to tame their own men.

725
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,165
My son, jacob jr.,

726
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,165
Didn't like what the army had become

727
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:12,400
but still thought his skills could be
used to preserve peace on the frontier.

728
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,865
When custer took charge of the 7th cavalry,

729
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:20,500
jacob knew it wouldn't be long before
his job went from scouting to killing.

730
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,400
I reckon that this...

731
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,200
Will help morale any.

732
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,700
His morale will improve
when they'll be given indians to fight.

733
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,765
For that, gentlemen,

734
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:36,300
I have relied upon your good
offices to no avail, it seems.

735
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,165
The funny thing about indians, colonel,

736
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,000
they ain't so easy to find
when they don't want to be.

737
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,000
Let me offer you an alternative
explanation, mr. Wheeler,

738
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,700
you, being half-breeds,

739
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:51,550
have not applied yourself to the
work with the requisite enthusiasm.

740
01:01:51,585 --> 01:01:55,600
The 7th cavalry has been charged
with clearing these plains of savages

741
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,900
from the arkansas to the platte.

742
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:04,100
All depredations on lands being opened up
by the railroad are to cease.

743
01:02:04,135 --> 01:02:08,400
You will oblige me by performing
your duties without further delay.

744
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,500
Have I made myself clear?

745
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,400
As day, colonel.

746
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,100
We're finished here. Dismissed.

747
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Thank you, trooper.
That'll be sufficient.

748
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:55,400
We're through.

749
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,200
Donovan, we're through!

750
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,000
They've bloody done it!

751
01:03:01,035 --> 01:03:02,100
They've done it!

752
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:06,400
They built the great wall
of china, didn't they?

753
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,600
Fantastic!

754
01:03:09,443 --> 01:03:09,500
You should be proud of yourselves!

755
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,500
Let's see the union
pacific try to beat us now!

756
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,900
We did that.

757
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,500
Eastward, men!

758
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,400
Eastward to victory!

759
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,600
Medicine Lodge Creek
October, 1867

760
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:47,700
Margaret light shines had followed black
kettle's people in their wanderings.

761
01:03:47,735 --> 01:03:50,900
She began to live the life
of her mother before her.

762
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,850
When the long knife chief sherman,

763
01:03:53,885 --> 01:03:55,965
came to speak words of friendship,

764
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,800
she listened,
but she no longer trusted any white man.

765
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:04,900
It was white men who had killed her husband.

766
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:11,700
The iron horse is now crossing the lands
between the arkansas and the platte.

767
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,400
But there's land south of the arkansas,

768
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:15,665
and before it's taken,

769
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,200
we'd like to set aside a
part of it for your home.

770
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,865
On this home,

771
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,100
we'll build a house to
hold the goods we'll send.

772
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,900
To this home,

773
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:28,700
we'll send a physician to live
with you and heal your sick.

774
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:34,050
We'll send a farmer to teach
your people to grow corn

775
01:04:34,085 --> 01:04:38,300
and wheat and a mill to
make for you meal and flour.

776
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:43,365
For all this, you'll receive
an allowance of $20,000

777
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:48,300
each 12 moon to be spent by
the white father on your behalf.

778
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,900
He says, "why do you come here?

779
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,300
Because red cloud has
killed so many bluecoats?

780
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,500
"This is the time for
fighting, not talking."

781
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,500
From this day forward,

782
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:23,100
all war between the parties to
this agreement shall forever cease.

783
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,265
War will end in the total destruction

784
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,700
of the indian because his numbers are less.

785
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,400
We've prepared peace papers.

786
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:36,165
We ask that your chiefs and
head men hold their council

787
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,100
and meet with us when the shadows
are long to sign these papers.

788
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,000
Many wrongs have been done my people,

789
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,400
but I still live in hope.

790
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,900
I have not got 2 hearts.

791
01:07:10,056 --> 01:07:12,167
North Platte

792
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,100
What am i paying you for?

793
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,500
Get to work!

794
01:07:24,535 --> 01:07:25,500
Move your stuff!

795
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,700
I'm sending the girl back to omaha.

796
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,900
She belongs with your mother and sister.

797
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I won't let you do that.

798
01:07:44,035 --> 01:07:44,800
You won't let me?

799
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,400
You won't let me?

800
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,100
You've been seduced by
girlish blandishments.

801
01:07:49,135 --> 01:07:50,200
It's not like that.

802
01:07:50,235 --> 01:07:51,000
Yes, it is.

803
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,465
If you want to expend

804
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,765
some of that surplus of
manly urges you've got,

805
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,600
-I suggest you do it in one of own establish
-stop it!

806
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,700
I got a mind to teach that little slut

807
01:07:59,735 --> 01:08:01,100
I said you shut your mouth!

808
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:02,500
No!

809
01:08:02,535 --> 01:08:03,100
Stop!

810
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,200
Get off him.

811
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,100
I will let this pass...

812
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,500
for now.

813
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,900
Don't make me choose.

814
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,300
What are you looking at?

815
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,465
Sorry.

816
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,700
I didn't mean to startle you.

817
01:09:12,735 --> 01:09:13,700
It's all right.

818
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:16,700
It was about me...

819
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,700
what happened before with
your father, wasn't it?

820
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:26,500
It's not just the land
that's changing, clara.

821
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:27,900
It's people.

822
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,700
Me.

823
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:31,900
No.

824
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,800
You are one of the better angels.

825
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:37,500
Ohh! Ha ha!

826
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:43,500
Better angels, huh?

827
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,300
The better angels of our nature.

828
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,500
That's what mr. Lincoln called them.

829
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,400
Whoa!

830
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,400
Oh, he's got a spot open.

831
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,600
That's mine.

832
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:00,300
How could a country so
beautiful make men so cruel?

833
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,300
Ha ha ha!

834
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,765
So the towns came and went-

835
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,700
Cheyenne, Wyoming Territoy
May, 1868
julesburg, sidney, potter, kimble, archer.

836
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:10,765
At every stop,

837
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,000
the empire that daniel wheeler sought
for his family grew a little larger.

838
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,965
Then came cheyenne,

839
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,800
the magic city of the plains nearly halfway
between omaha and the shores of california.

840
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,800
The wheelers had become men of substance,

841
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,365
but robert knew that
something more important

842
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,800
had been lost along the tracks
and he aimed to get it back.

843
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,500
Thank you.

844
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,900
Hello, robert.

845
01:10:46,935 --> 01:10:48,100
Let me help you.

846
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,200
That's a pretty dress, clara.

847
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,300
It speaks of a real delicate sensibility.

848
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,500
Delicate?

849
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,200
Is that how you see me?

850
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,465
No.

851
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,500
I was just

852
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,965
all I meant to say was it's just nice to see

853
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,400
some refinement in a place
such as this, that's all.

854
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,800
Thank you.

855
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,200
You did just what you said you would.

856
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:14,865
I'm proud of you.

857
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,100
Let me show you something.

858
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,400
Clara...

859
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,900
-these are-
- vanities, I know.

860
01:11:34,935 --> 01:11:36,200
No. No, not at all.

861
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,000
These are... great.

862
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,500
I never thought I'd take up drawing again.

863
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,100
When I was a girl, I had such ambitions.

864
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,300
I dreamed of owning a ladies' emporium

865
01:11:48,335 --> 01:11:51,800
in a place like new york or san francisco.

866
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,465
I imagined myself

867
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,800
traveling to all the great
capitals of europe and...

868
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,300
I had time to dream then, I suppose.

869
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,200
You should never stop dreaming, clara.

870
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,800
That was...

871
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,500
bold of me.

872
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,300
Not nearly bold enough, robert wheeler.

873
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,200
Humbolt Sink, Great Basin
Nevada June, 1868

874
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,600
donovan!

875
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,865
A jackrabbit would need a canteen

876
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,800
and a haversack to get through this desert.

877
01:12:48,835 --> 01:12:50,700
Makes me wish we were back in the mountains.

878
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:52,465
Damn it!

879
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,200
Put your backs into it!

880
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:00,000
Every mile we make the
mother-lovin' union pacific makes 4!

881
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,800
Now you work as though heaven itself
were before you and hell behind you!

882
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,500
This isn't a ladies' social, donovan!

883
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,900
Beggin' your pardon, mr. Strobridge.

884
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,900
You work these men any harder,
you're not gonna have one left.

885
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,300
The heat, sir.

886
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,300
You get these cursed celestials digging!

887
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,465
If you don't get these
chinese working, donovan,

888
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,900
you and the other walking bosses will
have to take their place on the line.

889
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,800
I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.

890
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:43,767
What did you say?

891
01:13:43,802 --> 01:13:44,700
Can't or won't?

892
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,600
No disrespect meant, sir.

893
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,600
But we're gonna finish
this railroad together

894
01:13:49,635 --> 01:13:51,800
or we're not gonna finish it!

895
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,600
Let them have their damn rest.

896
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,400
We resume work first light tomorrow morning.

897
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,800
Yes, sir!

898
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,100
Thought you said you didn't
have any use for the chinese.

899
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,000
Got even less for bosses.

900
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,100
Ft. Phil Kearny
Wyoming Territoy
August, 1868

901
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,265
After 2 years of fighting,

902
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:28,800
the long knives abandoned
their fort and signed a treaty

903
01:14:28,835 --> 01:14:32,300
that gave the sacred
lands back to the lakota.

904
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,350
The red cloud had done what no man,

905
01:14:35,385 --> 01:14:37,900
white or indian, thought possible.

906
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,800
Young warriors took heart
from this great victory.

907
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,950
Many who had gone to the reservations

908
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:47,300
began to return to their hunting grounds.

909
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,200
There they found the white men.

910
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,400
The circle of violence was renewed.

911
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:57,500
Punishment fell on those
who did not seek war.

912
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:58,800
Black Kettle's Camp
Washita River

913
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,500
See that, mr. Wheeler?

914
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,000
A presentiment of victory.

915
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,900
Heaven sent, colonel.

916
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:21,000
Fine work, scouts.
I will send for you if I have need.

917
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,200
The garry owen, if you please, corporal.

918
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,200
Hyah!

919
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:55,200
Soldiers! Soldiers!

920
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,550
All around us!

921
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:57,700
See to the women.

922
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,700
Save as many as you can.

923
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,000
We're living in a nightmare.

924
01:16:04,035 --> 01:16:05,500
We will meet again.

925
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,800
Colonel wants to see you.

926
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,300
Give me that coat.

927
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,800
Now!

928
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,300
Keep moving!

929
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:14,600
Go on!

930
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,800
Get back in line!

931
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,900
Margaret?

932
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,900
Git!

933
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:52,900
Fort Hays, Kansas
7th Cavalry Headquarters

934
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,600
That one doesn't look like such
a bad sort,does she,armstrong?

935
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,900
Their women possess a fierceness
not found in our more refined sex.

936
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,000
Those who have not been too
degraded by being mere chattels

937
01:18:09,035 --> 01:18:11,900
may yet learn some rudimentary manners.

938
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,400
And what's your name?

939
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,500
This one goes by margaret,ma'am.

940
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:20,600
Margaret.

941
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,300
That's a lovely name.

942
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,400
It's nice to have met you,margaret.

943
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,700
[Speaking lakota language]

944
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,300
Oh,that's the one.

945
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,400
You tell the lieutenant
to mind his privates.

946
01:19:15,435 --> 01:19:17,200
This one's a wildcat.

947
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,600
No! Take me back!

948
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,900
Stop fighting me!  Ain't
nothing gonna happen to you.

949
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,400
You're nothing but a murderer
like the rest of them!

950
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:29,200
No! No!

951
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,900
Listen to me,listen to me.

952
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,100
shu shu... It's ok.

953
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:36,700
Listen to me.

954
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,500
I'm gonna march you through that gate.

955
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,600
There's a pony waiting at the corrals,ok?

956
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:41,700
You get on it.

957
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,700
You go ride clear of here,you understand me?

958
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,300
No,I won't!

959
01:19:45,335 --> 01:19:46,000
No!

960
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,100
Aah! Take me back!

961
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,200
You don't belong with these people!

962
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:54,300
You don't belong with them!

963
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,265
These people-

964
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:10,900
- they're my sisters and my mothers,

965
01:20:10,935 --> 01:20:14,700
my children,and my brothers!

966
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,400
I won't leave them!

967
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,000
You ain't talkin' sense,margaret.

968
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:22,600
How can I ever face ma and pa if
I don't see you safe out of here?

969
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,100
You tell them...

970
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,900
their daughter margaret died at sand creek.

971
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:42,400
Lived to see the white man keep
his promises on the washita.

972
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:46,300
You tell them that the hole in my heart...

973
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,500
is now filled with sorrow.

974
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,900
You tell them...

975
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,400
that I can never be who I was.

976
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,200
Tell them that I love them.

977
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,900
Will you do this for me, jacob?

978
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,600
Will you tell them these things, jacob?

979
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,500
The lines will meet at promontory summit.

980
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,800
Utah's mormon country.

981
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,000
But they say brother brigham appreciates
the work of a gentile dollar.

982
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,900
When they drive that last spike,
a real opportunity begins.

983
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,500
We'll have our pick of the spur lines and...

984
01:22:25,535 --> 01:22:26,300
hauling contracts.

985
01:22:26,335 --> 01:22:27,400
Yes.

986
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,200
I don't want any part of it.

987
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,300
I had hoped to bestow upon
you our family's good fortune.

988
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,265
That is no more or less than my obligation

989
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,500
as it is yours to respect
and serve our businesses here.

990
01:22:42,535 --> 01:22:44,600
And I'll carry out my
duties until the rails meet.

991
01:22:44,635 --> 01:22:46,000
I owe you that.

992
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,900
Once it's finished, I'm
striking out on my own.

993
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,100
You display no aptitude for enterprise, sir.

994
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,000
That girl has a better head for
business than you'll ever have.

995
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,865
I underestimated her.

996
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,900
Clara, father. Can you say her name?

997
01:23:02,935 --> 01:23:03,700
Clara.

998
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,400
Clara.

999
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:10,300
She makes people nice things.

1000
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,700
Taking advantage of their weakness
doesn't seem much a business to me.

1001
01:23:14,735 --> 01:23:16,500
Different times call for different methods.

1002
01:23:16,535 --> 01:23:17,765
Oh, if that's progress,

1003
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,700
I suppose I don't want much a part of it.

1004
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,100
You better think hard on your future, boy.

1005
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,000
You boys earned it.

1006
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,300
Now fill it to the brim.

1007
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:55,600
All right.

1008
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:03,750
The union pacific.

1009
01:24:03,785 --> 01:24:05,000
Late as usual.

1010
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:24,500
Promontory Point, Utah
May 10, 1869

1011
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,165
For my wayward son abe,

1012
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:34,500
that may morning was a
triumph like no other.

1013
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,750
A ribbon of iron stretched 1,800 miles

1014
01:24:37,785 --> 01:24:40,700
from the mississippi to the pacific ocean.

1015
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,200
When those final rails were laid,

1016
01:24:44,235 --> 01:24:46,200
america changed forever.

1017
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,900
The final spike!

1018
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,200
Preacher.

1019
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:04,700
Some men fancied that they represented
the future of that new america,

1020
01:25:04,735 --> 01:25:06,965
but it was men and women like robert

1021
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,500
and clara who would come
to embody its true spirit.

1022
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,265
Their pluck and determination

1023
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:16,600
would be sorely tested in
the years that lay ahead.

1024
01:25:16,635 --> 01:25:18,465
We're right here today

1025
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,700
Bless this majestic road and
all those who ride upon it.

1026
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,300
May they and their business prosper.

1027
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,500
Now...

1028
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,600
where we now stand...

1029
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,800
but a few months since could be seen nothing
but the path of the red man.

1030
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:46,100
Now, a thousand wheels will bear on
their axles the wealth of half the world,

1031
01:25:46,135 --> 01:25:47,400
drawn by the iron horse,

1032
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,565
darkening the landscape
with its smoky breath,

1033
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:54,400
and startling the wild indian
with its piercing scream!

1034
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:00,165
We are a great people

1035
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,200
and can accomplish great things!

1036
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,500
You micks get down off that train!

1037
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:03,500
Get the real railroad men up here!

1038
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,200
All right, all right, time for a photograph!

1039
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,900
All you micks, break up.

1040
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:12,900
Get down from those rails, you chinese!

1041
01:28:12,935 --> 01:28:13,700
Come on!

1042
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,500
At least we got this to show for it.

1043
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,900
They can't ever take this away from us.

1044
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,400
Good luck in tai fau.

1045
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:41,200
You watch out for fan gway.

1046
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,000
Can't escape 'em.

1047
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,800
They're everywhere.

1048
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,893
All still now!

1049
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:53,094
