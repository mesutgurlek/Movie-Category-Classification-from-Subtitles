01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,129
Maybe April.

651
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:21,725
March, maybe.

652
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:24,042
I don't believe April.

653
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:26,684
Winter's a long time going?

654
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:29,881
Yeah.

655
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:34,522
Stays long this high.

656
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:50,723
March is a green,
muddy month down below.

657
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,329
Some folks like it.

658
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:55,648
Farmers mostly.

659
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:06,005
You have done well
to keep so much hair...

660
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:08,487
...when so many are after it.

661
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:12,484
I hope you will fare well.

662
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:51,482
