Yes, madam?

00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,467
I'd like to see
my nephew, please,

4
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:34,867
Wesley McQueen.

5
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,900
Sorry, no visitors.
Governor's orders.

6
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:39,267
But this is his birthday.

7
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,167
I baked him a cake.

8
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:45,267
I've come all the way Kansas
just to see him.

9
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,500
His, uh, Uncle Pluthner
sent him the prayer book.

10
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,067
I knitted him the socks.

11
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:51,933
We'll see that
he gets them, madam.

12
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:55,267
I wanted to tell Wesley
about his folks

13
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,267
And about the farm.

14
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,633
And, oh, about his horse.

15
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,467
The one he used to ride
when he was a little boy.

16
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:06,500
You tell him his Uncle Pluthner
has broken him to a buggy now.

17
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,600
And he takes
good care of him.

18
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,833
Yes, ma'am. We'll tell him
about his horse.

19
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,067
Thank you, thank you.

20
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,467
It's a white horse.

21
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:17,933
A white horse.

22
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:20,533
Tell him we pray
for him to be set free.

23
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,367
He's innocent, you know.

24
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,167
Just a mischievous boy.

25
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,333
He never really done
anybody any wrong.

26
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,567
Never done anybody any wrong.

27
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,067
Only held up four banks.

28
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:36,500
And the Missouri
and Pacific Railroad. Twice.

29
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:38,500
Like she says, mischievous.

30
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:40,667
Hank, cut into that cake.

31
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:49,433
Nothing in it.

32
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,767
Eat a piece.

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,133
Mm, not bad.

34
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,367
Try a piece.

35
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,333
No, thanks.
It might be poisoned.

36

Here, take the big innocent
rattlesnake his goodies.

37

Some presents
from your aunt.

Don't you want to hear
what she had to say?

I'm listening.

41
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,067
She said to tell
you that the white horse

42
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,867
You used to ride
when you was a kid

Is now pulling
your Uncle Pluthner's buggy.

McQueen is not gonna
like getting up this early.

Well, he can catch
up on his sleep

Don't worry, I'm all right.

I handle things
for him at this end.

He's out
in the Colorado Territory.

Oh, here's your route
and some money.

68
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,367
He wants to see you
as quick as you can got there.

69
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:01,433
I owe him that.

You owe him
more than that.

Cost him a pile of cash
to bust you out.

He's got a big job
set up for you.

A chance to get rich.
I've been rich.

It's a promised land, sir,
that's what it is.

109
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,067
My father used to say,

"The sun travels west
and so does opportunity."

My daughter and I, we've left
the past behind us.

Yes, sir, we, uh, had a little
farm back in Georgia.

But then, uh, soil was beat out,
crops poor, prices bad.

So we sold out everything
we had, lock, stock and barrel.

That is, everything except
our household goods

00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,600
Marshal, the stage was held up.

165
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:34,933
Charlie and Bill were killed.

166
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:40,200
MAN:
Here's the gentleman
who brought it in.

167
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:45,267
Meet, uh... What'd you say
your name was?

168
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,433
Chet Rogers.

169
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,467
You was on the stage?

170
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,067
On it? Mister, he saved it.

171
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,367
He took on six bandits
single-handed. Six!

172
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:52,800
And he killed 'em all.

173
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:54,500
I thought
the Day of Judgment had come.

174
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,267
I... Look at that.

175
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,800
Look at that bullet hole.

176
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:59,600
If that stagecoach had bounced
up instead of down,

177
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,933
That hole would have been
right through my head.

178
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,867
Oh!

179
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,633
The guard got three of them.
I got two.

180
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,733
The other one got away.

181
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Can you describe him?

182
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:09,600
Oh, big fella.

183
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,400
About 6'4", I'd say.

184
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:12,500
Long hair.

185
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:14,533
Too bad you missed him.

186
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,333
That sounds like Wes McQueen.

187
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,133
You'd have been $5000 richer.

188
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,333
Looks like I had
an expensive morning.

189
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,067
Where'd he jump you?

190
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,833
About 8 miles back,
right after we left the canyon.

191
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,700
Come on.

192
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:30,200
I wanna thank you, Mr. Rogers,
for what you did.

193
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,833
You're a brave man.

194
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,633
And if ever you find yourself
up around our way,

195
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,433
The Rancho Del Sol,

196
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
We'd be mighty glad
to see you.

197
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,267
Wouldn't we, Julie Ann?

198
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,933
You'll be most welcome.

199
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:43,433
Goodbye, sir.

200
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,167
Goodbye, sir.

201
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,767
Mister, the way I figure it,

202
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,633
You got quite a reward
coming from Wells Fargo.

203
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,067
Just leave your name and address

204
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,900
And our superintendant'll
get in touch with you.

205
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,700
Thanks, but I'll settle
for a good horse and saddle.

206
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,433
You got 'em, mister.

207
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,067
[**]

208
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,100
[**]

209
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:51,933
Howdy.

210
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,700
Howdy.

211
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,500
What do they call
this place?

212
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:59,067
You're in the Canyon of Death,
mister.

213
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,467
What's that up there?
That?

214
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,067
That's the City of the Moon.

215
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:08,300
Leastways, that's what
the Injuns call it.

216
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,600
A dead city hanging in space.

217
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,667
How far to Todos Santos?

218
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:15,500
Oh, that's way north of here.

219
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:16,900
Sits in the mountains.

220
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:19,800
Over the top of that ridge.

221
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,967
You ain't headed
for there, are you?

222
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,267
Why not?

223
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,367
I'll tell you
about Todos Santos, mister.

224
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:29,367
Strictly the back end
of nothing.

225
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:32,067
The Spaniards moved in first.

226
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:35,200
Injuns come along
and massacred 'em.

227
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,567
Then the pox come along
and took care of the Injuns.

228
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:42,300
Left nothing but scorpions
and Gila monsters.

229
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:45,700
Then an earthquake come along
and took care of them.

230
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:48,733
Ain't nobody gone
there since, mister.

231
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,667
Less'n some rattlesnake maybe
got himself lost.

232
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:56,167
Well, I ain't lost.

233
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:59,233
[**]

234
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:31,700
[**]

235
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:49,300
Who are you?

236
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,700
I'll do the asking.

237
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,733
[**]

238
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:03,133
That's McQueen, all right.

239
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,067
It sure fits the old man's
picture of him.

240
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,467
Glad you got here, McQueen.

241
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,567
We're in old Dave's
setup with you.

242
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,833
I'm Duke Harris.

243
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,400
This is Reno Blake.

244
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:19,800
Where's the old man?

245
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,500
He stays in Potrero.

246
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:22,600
How far is that?

247
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,533
About 60 miles.

248
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,167
What do you think
of the hideout?

249
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:27,833
Looks all right.

250
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,933
It is all right.
I picked it.

251
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:33,567
Reno's an expert
on hideouts.

252
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:35,267
Who's boss here?

253
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,667
A debatable issue.

254
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:39,600
Do you mean physically
or intellectually?

255
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,767
I'll talk to you.

256
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,233
The great Wes McQueen.

257
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,967
Just a big Kansas jay.

258
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:58,133
[**]

259
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:06,300
Reno and I are quartered
in that broken-down hacienda.

260
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:07,633
The girl has a room upstairs.

261
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,233
Anything else with a roof on it?

262
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,467
Well, we reserved
the old Indian kiva for you

263
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:14,933
If you're not bothered
by ghosts.

264
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:20,567
The tribal council chamber,
Mr. McQueen.

265
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,467
Gathering place
of the medicine men,

266
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:23,467
The seats of the mighty.

267
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,600
No longer occupied.

268
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:26,667
You talk kind of fancy.

269
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,900
Only philosophizing,
Mr. McQueen,

270
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:31,733
On my favorite subject: Doom.

271
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,167
When it's got you marked,
you're already dead.

272
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,700
What's the girl doing here?

273
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,733
You don't have
to worry about her.

274
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,600
Why not?
She's stupid, McQueen.

275
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,467
She thinks loyalty a virtue.

276
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,633
Reno met her
in an El Paso dance hall.

277
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,233
There was a bit of shooting.

278
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,067
He cleared out to save his hide
and he took her with him.

279
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:52,833
For some obscure reason
she's grateful.

280
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,700
Where do you two fit
in with the old man?

281
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:58,267
A large payroll
is the bond that unites us.

282
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:02,633
It travels by the Denver
Rio Grande up to Potrero.

283
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,067
A Mr. Wallace,
the railroad conductor,

284
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:07,200
Will tell us the next date
of shipment.

285
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:09,800
So the details of execution
are in your hands.

286
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:12,200
Is Wallace in touch
with the old man?

287
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:14,567
He'll be up to talk
to you on his day off.

288
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:18,900
I'll do my own
talking to the old man.

289
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:19,867
That's all.

290
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:22,900
I take it
I'm dismissed.

291
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,067
And get that girl
out of here.

292
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:27,267
There are two of you
and one of her, savvy?

293
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,533
To be accurate,
Mr. McQueen,

294
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,067
There are now three
of us and one of her.

295
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:38,567
Yes, sir.

296
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:42,067
Pickings must be awful
easy back in Kansas,

297
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:46,433
A big jay like McQueen
can get a reputation.

298
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,700
I didn't see you
tangling with him.

299
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:51,233
What're you looking for,
a punch in the nose?

300
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:56,233
Well, what'd the big noise
have to say?

301
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,667
Very little.

302
00:19:57,733 --> 00:20:00,067
Colorado, you can start packing.

303
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,667
[**]

304
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,700
What's eating you?

305
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,200
McQueen's orders.

306
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,800
This is to be a bachelor club
from now on.

307
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:10,967
Why, that overgrown jailbird.

308
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:13,100
He's not boss around here
any more than I am.

309
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:14,733
He can't come in...
Keep it up, Reno.

310
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,033
You may talk yourself into
winning this argument yet.

311
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,567
You getting tired
of living, Duke?

312
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:20,733
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!

313
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,233
Instead of fighting
with each other,

314
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,067
Why don't you go over
and tangle with him?

315
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:35,600
Yeah.

316
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,633
Trouble is we might
need him for this job.

317
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,267
A rather obvious point.

318
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:45,233
Well, give my regards
to the girls in El Paso.

319
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,233
I ain't there yet.

320
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,167
I'd like to talk
to you, Mr. McQueen.

321
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:01,367
Help yourself.

322
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,467
Duke tells me
I have to pull out.

323
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,500
That's right.

324
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:12,200
What if I tell you
I don't want to go?

325
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:13,500
I'm telling you,

By the way,

Colorado.

Colorado Carson.

387
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,900
Colorado. You born
in these mountains?

388
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,533
My mother.

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,900
She was part Pueblo.

390
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:39,333
I guess she was homesick
when she named me.

And your old man?

392
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:43,067
Boss cowhand down
on the Pecos country.

393
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,367
Grew up there.

394
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:46,533
Pretty tough place for a kid.

00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,933
It was all right
as long as Pa was living.

396
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:51,633
After that, it was either
the Comanches

397
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,767
Or the cowpokes.

398

I don't know which was worse.

That was on clear nights.

401

Rainy weather it was,
"Let's go inside the barn

Evening, Miss Julie Ann.

00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,600
This Indian woman is looking
for water for her sheep.

490
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:33,500
Yeah, don't seem
to be much water hereabouts.

was expecting too much.

Less than a dozen.

And not then till
you've seen it,

Felt it, tasted it
and smelt it.

521

At that, you might
get bamboozled.

You expect to dig
a well with those tools?

With them things, I couldn't
dig a hole in a swamp.

00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,467
Oh, what's the use?

810
00:44:40,533 --> 00:44:42,333
You don't get off that easy.

811
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:45,733
Don't, Wes. It don't matter.

812
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,500
Now, wait a minute, McQueen.

813
00:44:48,567 --> 00:44:49,800
We gotta start pulling together.

814
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,600
The heist comes off Friday.

815
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:52,700
Who told you?

816
00:44:52,767 --> 00:44:55,067
Some crony of the old man's.

817
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,067
All right. Turn in.

818
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:00,900
I'll give you the layout
in the morning.

819
00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:04,167
Get out of line again,
I'll kill both of you.

820
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:10,733
Get your bed roll
and bring it in here tonight.

821
00:45:12,367 --> 00:45:14,400
Where'd they get the bottle?

822
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:15,400
Pluthner brought it.

823
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:16,467
Pluthner?

824
00:45:16,533 --> 00:45:18,267
That's what they called him.

825
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:19,567
He's the big scissor-bill

826
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,233
That brought the message
about the payroll.

827
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,467
You know him?

828
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:26,300
Yeah. I know him.

829
00:45:52,633 --> 00:45:56,267
Martha.

830
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:57,300
Martha.

831
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:06,400
Martha.

832
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:08,067
Wait. Don't go.

833
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,700
Don't go.

834
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:32,100
Where are you going?

835
00:46:33,867 --> 00:46:36,067
I'm getting out
of Todos Santos.

836
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,100
Come on back here.

837
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:01,933
Who's Martha?

838
00:47:04,633 --> 00:47:07,233
Martha?

839
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,667
You was dreaming
out loud.

840
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:12,333
Must have been.

841
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:16,267
Are you in love with her?

842
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,467
We was gonna get married.

843
00:47:19,533 --> 00:47:22,267
What stopped you?

844
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,100
She's dead.

845
00:47:31,567 --> 00:47:33,567
It wouldn't have done
no good.

846
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:35,867
What do you mean?

847
00:47:35,933 --> 00:47:38,067
Marrying her wouldn't
have helped none.

848
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,367
You bust
out of jails maybe,

849
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:43,733
Or mud holes like I was in,

850
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,267
But you can't
bust out of what you are.

851
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:48,200
You can if you're set on it.

852
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:49,367
Can you?

853
00:47:50,433 --> 00:47:52,600
Me. Hm.

854
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:55,500
I was born under a chuck wagon.

855
00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:57,600
Never got much higher.

856
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:00,500
Anything was a step up.

857
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:03,667
Even getting hit by Reno
was all velvet.

858
00:48:03,733 --> 00:48:06,533
He won't do that again.

859
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,333
He had a right to.

860
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,433
He knew Duke was right when
he said it was you I wanted.

861
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:19,067
Hold me, Wes.

862
00:48:19,067 --> 00:48:20,400
Hold me.

863
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:25,267
It won't work.

864
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:26,600
I've got plans.

865
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:27,767
There's no room
in them for you.

866
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,967
Not for the long pull.

867
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,800
Maybe there won't be
no long pull.

868
00:48:35,867 --> 00:48:40,100
Maybe it all ends
Friday on that train.

869
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,400
Yeah.

870
00:48:42,467 --> 00:48:44,833
Yeah, that's where it ends.

871
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,333
Everybody takes
his own road after that.

872
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,600
Reno. Duke. Rickard.

873
00:48:50,667 --> 00:48:53,467
You and me.

874
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:55,833
We're all through then.

875
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,633
WES:
There's the railroad.

876
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,967
There's a good stand of trees

877
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,500
At Pine Flats
you can hide out in

878
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:30,267
Until I signal you
to board the train.

879
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:33,433
Colorado, if we make this haul,
you're in on it.

880
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,733
Right?

881
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:42,100
There's a small bridge
at Luckman's Pass.

882
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:44,400
You wait there
with the extra horses.

883
00:49:44,467 --> 00:49:47,467
That gives you just about four
minutes to get that safe open.

884
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:48,633
It'll be open.

885
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,233
I only hope those train guards

886
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,767
Give us an argument.

887
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:53,633
If there's anything I hate,
it's railroaders.

888
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,067
Don't be getting a trigger itch.

889
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:57,300
I don't want any funerals
on this picnic.

890
00:49:59,067 --> 00:50:01,867
Did, uh, Pluthner
have anything else to say?

891
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:03,167
Pluthner?

892
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,333
You forgot to mention him,
didn't you?

893
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,533
You know, the bird that brought
you that whiskey yesterday.

894
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,100
Oh.

895
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:12,833
Was that his name?

896
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,433
I just knew he was a friend
of the old man's.

[BELL RINGING]

898
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:35,233
WES:
Nice, private hideout
you picked.

899
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,100
Ain't supposed to be
anybody around here.

900
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:48,867
Welcome.

901
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:52,567
I'm glad to see this old bell
has a small voice after all.

902
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,133
A sky pilot, uh?

903
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,400
I am Brother Tomas.

904
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:56,533
Year in and year out,

905
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,533
I travel the trail
of the missions,

906
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,300
Keeping the chapels in order.

907
00:51:00,367 --> 00:51:05,500
Stopping often to ring the poor,
old broken bell of Todos Santos.

908
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:08,067
Not that it can be heard
very far.

909
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,267
Well, that's good.

910
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:12,433
The ways of the Lord
are strange and wondrous.

911
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,833
In the... In the foundry at Aztec
there is a bell cast of bronze.

912
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,800
Its tone is clear,
its call will carry far.

913
00:51:19,867 --> 00:51:23,167
Ha! For 10 years
it has lain there.

914
00:51:23,233 --> 00:51:25,267
Aztec's not far away.

915
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:28,367
It is not a matter of distance,
child, but of money.

916
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:31,067
When we receive enough offerings

917
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:32,600
To pay for it,

918
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:36,500
Then it will hang high
and sound its call.

[LAUGHING]

920
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,633
Perhaps, then,
the Indians will come back.

921
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:46,233
We will even rebuild
the mission of Todos Santos.

922
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:51,467
Oh. Thanks be to the travelers
who dropped this offering here.

923
00:51:51,533 --> 00:51:52,467
Nothing is too small.

924
00:51:52,533 --> 00:51:54,200
I didn't know it was there.

925
00:51:54,267 --> 00:51:55,600
I'm quite sure you didn't.

926
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:57,600
Nothing is too small.

927
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:59,233
Time to be riding.

928
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,300
Good luck, Wes.

929
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,933
Do you travel far?

930
00:52:02,067 --> 00:52:03,467
Far enough.

931
00:52:03,533 --> 00:52:05,067
May God be with you.

00:52:19,567 --> 00:52:20,467
Yeah?

935
00:52:20,533 --> 00:52:22,067
Is your husband at home?

936
00:52:22,067 --> 00:52:24,500
No, he's down at the train,
about ready to take her out.

937
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:28,333
Oh, I guess I'm too late for
that job I was hoping to get.

938
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,600
What job?

939
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:31,167
Guarding the payroll shipment.

940
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:33,233
I figured they might
need some more guards.

941
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,633
They ain't short.

942
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,133
The marshal himself's
riding the train.

943
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,533
Homer had four of his deputies
in for poker last night.

944
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,933
He think that's enough?

945
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:42,900
More than enough,
if you ask me.

946
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:46,633
The hold-upper they're expecting
is only priced at 10,000.

I told Homer he'd be sorry

He took them other
fellers in on it.

00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,067
Just makes less for him.

He's got one.

Get me a sharp knife.

1135
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:14,067
I got my veterinary kit.

1136
01:07:14,133 --> 01:07:16,067
Well, get it.
And boil some water.

hide those horses.

01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,667
I told you I had a past
to get done with.

1140
01:07:27,733 --> 01:07:30,400
I never figured it would
end like this.

You can't go anyplace.

Not now.
You've got to get well.

I knew it.

I knew I could
count on you, Julie Ann.

Tomorrow she gets her share
and goes her own way.
