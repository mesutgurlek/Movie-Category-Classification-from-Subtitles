- If they do.

of the witness, Michael.

You remind me of a gorilla

Only the gorilla had better breeding.

for Durant, so I told him.

00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,048
Miss Ellison may just be right.

320
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:24,984
Durant is just the kind of
man to do such a thing,

321
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:27,253
arrange his own kidnapping.

322
00:29:28,823 --> 00:29:32,325
- No.
- If she's wrong, if we're wrong...

323
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,527
Durant's no worse off than he is now.

324
00:29:34,562 --> 00:29:39,465
If we're right, won't be long before
he waltzes through that door.

325
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:43,001
Of course, he'll have to stand trial

326
00:29:43,026 --> 00:29:46,608
for what
befell his chief engineer on that train.

327
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:55,915
Fine.

328

DURANT: John Campbell is not
going to let the murderer

331
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,421
of the chief engineer of the
Union Pacific railroad go free.

332
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:39,158
He will hunt your cousin
down until he finds him.

And when he finds him... (INHALES)

Do you think we can rely
on that thing up there?

335
00:30:50,238 --> 00:30:54,540
It would be prudent to tie things off.

You're absolutely right.

That would be the prudent thing to do.

339
00:31:05,787 --> 00:31:10,756
So when these bastards get here,
and drop that money off,

340
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:15,361
that thing up there and
me are gonna take it

a damn thing you can do about it,

were worth saving.

Take the damn money.
Take it and get of here.

$250,000. Not 50.

It's not enough.

It's enough for the life that we want.

Maggie Palmer rode up over the ridge.

397

She had a sack of money.

He picked up the bag,

shot her dead
and rode away, if I had to guess.

I don't know, John.
