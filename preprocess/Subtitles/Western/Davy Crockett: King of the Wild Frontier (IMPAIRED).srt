[Jackson] Major. Major Norton.

16
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,521
- Yes, sir?
- Where's that scout I told you to find?

17
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,623
They say the best man is one
of the volunteers, Crockett.

18
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,636
- Where is he?
- Matter of fact, he's out hunting.

19
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:07,798
- Hunting?
- We need food. He's across the river.

20
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:12,334
That's enemy territory.
What you're short on is brains, not rations.

21
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:16,371
- He didn't take a gun, sir.
- I want this Crockett fellow now.

22
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:18,815
- Fetch him.
- Yes, sir.

23
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:24,554
[Norton] Crockett.

24
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,952
Crockett.

25
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:32,089
Davy Crockett.

26
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:34,190
Where's Crockett?

27
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:36,132
Speak up, man.

28
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:42,566
Where is he?

29
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:45,503
- [Growling]
- What's he doing in there?

30
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:49,175
He's tryin' to grin down a bear.

31
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,182
Grin down a...

32
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:55,779
You backwoods buffoons think
the rest of us'll believe anything.

33
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:58,586
Crockett. Crockett, can't you hear me?

34
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:00,057
[Growling]

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,219
Come out of there.
I've got a message...

36
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:04,797
- [growling]
- [Grunting]

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,468
You sure spoiled things good.

38
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:12,004
Now I gotta do it the old-fashioned way.

39
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:14,867
Yee-haw. Give him what for, Davy.

40
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,568
[Crockett grunting]

41
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,916
Stick with him, Davy.

42
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,113
[Growling]

43
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:41,598
Now, Major, what was it
you wanted to see me about?

44
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,931
[Panting] General Jackson
wants to see you.

45
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:49,101
As soon as we get that bear pulled up.
It's a fair-to-middlin' size critter.

46
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:53,108
[Cheering, indistinct chatter]

47
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:57,375
Full bellies tonight, boys.

48
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:04,317
- I hear you want to see me, General.
- That's right. Come inside.

49
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,556
Now, how'd you kill that brute?

50
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,998
With my knife.
I was figurin' on grinnin' him to death,

51
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:17,161
but this stumble-footed major
busted my concentratin'.

52
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:20,297
Grinnin' him to death?
What in thunderation is that?

53
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,864
It's somethin' I've been
experimentin' with.

54
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:26,071
You see, there's nothin'
so absolutely unresistable

55
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:29,706
as an old-fashioned,
good-natured grin, like this.

56
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,144
I started on 'coons.
I got so good at it,

57
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,314
an old 'coon throwed up his hands
the minute he seen my teeth.

58
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:40,120
"You got me," he hollered
and he skinned down that tree

59
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,160
and plopped himself in my sack.

60
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:46,528
I figured the same thing ought to work on
bears, but I never got a chance to find out.

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,592
The major come along
and busted up my concentratin'.

62
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:52,695
I wound up havin' to wrestle
this critter into table meat.

63
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:56,503
- Why was you hankerin' to see me?
- We're on the edge of enemy territory.

64
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:59,511
I want a scouting party to see
what them redskins is up to.

65
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:03,208
Major Norton and a squad of regulars
will accompany ya.

66
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:05,444
That wouldn't make the chore no easier.

67
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:08,214
Be sure the major brings back
the information I want.

68
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,483
Come on, Major.

69
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:36,878
Some of your boys rode water pretty deep.
Better look to their powder.

70
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,941
Re-prime your pieces.

71
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,113
From here on, don't make
no more noise. No talkin'.

72
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:45,316
Everybody keep close up.

73
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:26,692
Better stick closer to us, Major.

74
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:31,533
You've led us through swamps,
canebrakes, and briar patches all day.

75
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:34,266
I see a trail and
there's no sense in not taking it.

76
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,831
Has the general got your wife's address?

77
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,845
Take that trail and he's apt
to write her a sad letter.

78
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:43,440
We're here to locate Indians and
I don't like the way you're doing it.

79
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:46,713
We'll cover more ground if we separate.
I'll take that trail.

80
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:50,017
We'll be back here in this clearing
by dawn. See that you are.

81
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,288
Better fix up a signal to identify ourselves.
Can you do an old hoot owl?

82
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,850
Certainly.

[Hooting weakly]

84
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:02,330
That ought to fool the redskins just dandy.

[Laughing]

86
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:16,941
Come on.

87
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:30,156
[Davy] War party, a big one.

88
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:35,257
Here comes another bunch.
Head for cover.

89
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:58,991
[Speaking native language]

90
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:10,492
- That was Red Stick.
- What makes you so sure?

91
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,698
Creeks only got one young chief.
Gotta be him.

92
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,875
Let's leave the horses here.

93
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:30,511

[Chanting, drums beating]

95
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:38,261
Looks like Red Stick's finally
talked the tribe into listening.

96
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:42,296
I don't know what he said,
but I sure don't like it.

97
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:44,393
I hope they keep that up a spell longer.

98
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,166
[Shouting, chanting]

99
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:51,337
We'd better get back to the major fast.

100
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,610
[Hooting]

101

Everybody take cover.
Take cover, men.

104
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:54,764
Sounds like the major
got himself in trouble.

105
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,036
- And we'll have to get him out.
- How?

106
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,670
- Surround 'em.
- Think there's enough of us?

107
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:02,544
We'll give 'em the ol' Crockett charge.

108
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:11,089
- [Crockett] Brigade, halt.
- [Russel] Company, halt.

109
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:14,558
Brigade... charge.

110
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:16,753
Company... charge.

111
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:19,297
It's the general and the whole regiment.

112
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:21,560
[Cheering]

113
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:24,159
All together now. Fire at will.

114
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,762
Charge. Yee-haw.

115
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:33,209
Advance on the line of skirmish.

116
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:35,543
Dragoons, dismount.

117
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:40,148
[Russel] Yippee. Yee-haw.

118
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:42,653
We got 'em on the run, men.

119
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,488
Company B, close up.

120
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:47,456
[Indistinct shouting]

121
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,289
Charge.

122
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,960
Charge.

123
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:57,461
[Russel shouting]

124
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:11,382
Company A reportin'.

125
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:15,586
[Russel] Here's the rest of us, Major.

126
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:18,488
Company B reportin'.

127
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,988
- You mean, just two of ya?
- Two was enough, wasn't it?

128
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:28,466
- These varmints were just a little party.
- The Creek nation is gatherin'.

129
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:32,470
Take care of your casualties.
We'll get the news to the general.

130
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:52,089
The general's expectin' me.

131
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:56,852
- Sorry to disturb you, General.
- Never mind. What did you find out?

132
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:59,830
They aim to fight.
They had a big war dance last night.

133
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,357
- Where?
- Back in the mountain.

134
00:12:03,436 --> 00:12:04,698
Red Stick, sir.

135
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:07,968
Red Stick? I'd sure like
to get my hooks on him.

136
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,033
We gotta move fast.
He's whippin' 'em up quick.

137
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,045
- Where's Major Norton?
- He had a little trouble.

138
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:16,445
Sentry.
What kind of trouble?

139
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:18,746
- Injun trouble, lost some men.
- Yes, sir?

140
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:21,844
Tell the sergeant major to order
the camp struck.

141
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,883
- Lookouts are accounted for.
- Good.

142
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:08,766
When we catch Red Stick,
this war will be over.

143
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:13,033
There's only two ways he can escape.
I got him stoppered.

144
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:18,237
As soon as the regulars are in position,
jump in and stir up them red hornets.

145
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:10,485
[Yelling]

146
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:12,622
Give it to 'em, boys.

147
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,200
[Gunshots]

148
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:55,067
Fire and fall back.

149
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:26,330
[Shouting]

150
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,878
Fire.

00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:02,804
[Bugle]

153
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:13,245
I reckon Red Stick's tomahawk's
got an awful nick in it.

154
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:17,683
- Got away, didn't he?
- Yeah, but a lot of 'em didn't.

155
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:20,521
Much obliged for savin' my scalp.

156
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:23,824
Mrs. Crockett might have
a kiss for ya when we get home.

157
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:29,824
- [Man #1] Feelin' better, boy?

00:30:57,602 --> 00:31:00,503
# Where the trees is tall
And the grass is green

309
00:31:00,572 --> 00:31:03,837
# Where the fish is fat
In an untouched stream

310
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:07,401
# And the teemin' woods
Is a hunter's dream

311
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:11,176
# Davy, Davy Crockett

312
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:16,277
# Lookin' for paradise #

313
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:37,705
- You goin' any further?
- Not me. I like it fine right here.

314
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:42,176
[Mooing]

315
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:47,483
[Barking]

316
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:49,543
Hold on there, mister.

317
00:31:49,621 --> 00:31:52,522
Who do we see about filin' a claim
on some land?

318
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:56,220
Why, me. But you'll have to wait 'til
after I judge a shootin' match.

319
00:31:56,294 --> 00:32:00,458
A shootin' match? Any objection
to a couple of strangers buyin' in?

320
00:32:00,532 --> 00:32:04,491
Save your money.
You'll be shootin' against Big Foot Mason.

321
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:07,163
- Reckon we can risk a dollar?
- [Gunshot]

322
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:10,174
Sounds like they started without ya.

323
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:21,551
- You should have waited for me, Big Foot.
- You wasn't here.

324
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,756
Right in the notch, Big Foot.

325
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:36,361
- That's the last round. The beef's mine.
- Wait a minute.

326
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:39,426
This ain't fair judgin'.
Them's friends of yours.

327
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:41,995
Don't hear no complaints
from the losers.

328
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:46,635
Hey, what do you figure
that beef you won's worth?

329
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:49,236
$15 cash money, why?

330
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:52,772
Never went to a shootin' match
without gettin' at least one shot off.

331
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:56,685
One shot it is.
Hey, Bruno, charge up my other rifle.

332
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:58,814
Give it two extra thimbles.

333
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:03,316
Take care of these cartwheels.
This time you do the judgin'.

334
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:12,860
Mighty fancy shootin' iron
for this part of the woods.

335
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:14,461
Yeah, ain't it?

336
00:33:26,584 --> 00:33:29,212
Dead center for Big Foot.

337
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:43,526
This one's dead center too.
You'll have to fire another round.

338
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:46,297
You was lucky.

339
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:56,673
Less'n a finger off the notch.

340
00:33:56,748 --> 00:33:59,717
Better save your powder, stranger.

341
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,465
Why, he didn't even cut paper.

342
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:19,162
That'll take the turpentine
out of your bark.

343
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:23,105
- I was a-fearin' you fired too fast.
- Let's take a look.

344
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:32,440
- He missed the whole blamed board.
- [Old man] I ain't so sure.

345
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:41,855
Looky here.
One bullet right on top of the other.

346
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:43,052
Yee-haw.

347
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:46,564
That's the kinda shootin' makes
the ol' possum squeal.

348
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:48,832
Come on.

349
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:53,604
Here.

350
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:57,302
You're the first ones
in over to them parts.

351
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:00,572
Nearest neighbor's a Cherokee,
name of Charley Two Shirts.

352
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:02,408
Nice folks.

353
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:06,183
Thank you, Mr. Russel.

354
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:15,355
Davy Croc... you Davy Crockett?

355
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:18,794
- Why, sure.
- Davy Crockett.

356
00:35:18,863 --> 00:35:22,856
No wonder you won Big Foot's beef
away from him.

357
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,266
[Russel] Didn't seem too happy about it.

358
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:28,499
No, Big Foot ain't used
to things goin' again' him.

359
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:31,097
Got folks pretty well
buffaloed around here.

360
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:32,803
So I noticed.

361
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:35,573
We had the beginnin's
of a decent community here,

362
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:38,172
before him and his riffraff moved in.

363
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:41,844
- What are they doin' here?
- Nobody dares talk much about it.

364
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,186
They been runnin' the Injuns off
their land, sellin' it to newcomers.

365
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:49,351
Government guarantees the Indians
their lands by treaty.

366
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:52,021
Treaties don't mean nothin' to Big Foot.

367
00:35:52,096 --> 00:35:56,396
- Why don't somebody stop him?
- Fella that was magistrate here tried.

368
00:35:56,468 --> 00:35:59,596
Went over to serve a warrant on him.
Never come back.

369
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:02,799
He had the prettiest rifle
ever seen in these parts.

370
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:06,139
Nobody knows what happened to him,
but we know where his gun is.

371
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:10,580
Yeah, Big Foot was shootin'
with it against Davy today.

372
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:16,143
That's right. Crockett, you're the only one
I know that could stand up to him.

373
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:18,951
Will you take on the job as magistrate?

374
00:36:19,023 --> 00:36:23,426
- What would I have to do?
- Get us some law and order around here.

375
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:27,192
Well, I ain't crawfishin',
but I kinda got my hands full.

376
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:29,995
We gotta finish our cabins,
so I can bring my family.

377
00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:33,799
It ain't no fit place for families
as long as they're runnin' loose.

378
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:35,669
What do you say?

379
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:39,266
Well, take some thinkin'.

380
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:47,648
- I'm drier than a powder horn.
- Fetch me some too.

381
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:05,399
[Whistling]

382
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:48,946
Hey. This what stood your hair up?

383
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:52,048
[Speaking native language]

384
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:56,177
- I was sure I seen a man.
- Nobody's gonna hurt ya. Come on out.

385
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:03,393
Come out of there.

386
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:08,695
- Who are you?
- Charley Two Shirts.

387
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:13,169
- He's our neighbor.
- What happened to you?

388
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:17,765
Three white men come to my farm.
Tell Charley Two Shirts, "Get off."

389
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:22,336
I say, "This my land."
They say, "Indian got no land."

390
00:38:22,413 --> 00:38:25,280
I show paper.
This land belong Cherokee.

391
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,979
They tear paper up,
then Charley Two Shirts fight.

392
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:40,958
Reckon I'm gonna take on that job
of magistrate right now.

393
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:51,332
Hey, Big Foot.

394
00:38:55,647 --> 00:38:57,137
Lookin' for somebody?

395
00:38:57,215 --> 00:39:00,742
Yeah, the man that run my friend here
off his land.

396
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:11,421
I know who you are. Since when
is Davy Crockett a friend of Injuns?

397
00:39:11,496 --> 00:39:13,726
Always been a friend of the Cherokees.

398
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:16,767
Got no bones to pick with the others
since we made peace.

399
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:19,769
This land's too good for Injuns.
I'm filin' on it.

400
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:24,433
No, ya ain't. Injuns got rights.
They're folks same as anybody else.

401
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:27,273
Take a powerful argument
to convince me of that.

402
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:31,975
- That's what I come for.
- I've ate better men than you whole.

403
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:37,246
- How'll you have it, Big Foot?
- Rough and tumble. No holds barred.

404
00:40:03,414 --> 00:40:05,279
Now ya got him, Big Foot.

405
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:07,409
Oh.

406
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:44,117

[Speaking Cherokee]

408
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:04,572
That goes for me too.

409
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:07,639
[Russel] Give him what for, Davy.

410
00:41:13,718 --> 00:41:15,743
[Gunshot]

411
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:23,652
Get 'em, Charley.

412
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:27,192
Come on.

413
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,498
Get up. I said, get up.

414
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:40,407
- Much obliged, Charley.
- Come on, get goin'.

415
00:41:42,446 --> 00:41:45,244
- What you aimin' to do to us?
- Me? Nothin'.

416
00:41:45,316 --> 00:41:49,412
But you're gonna stand trial.
You two varmints got a lot to answer for.

417
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:51,546
Now get.

418
00:42:00,331 --> 00:42:02,799
[Caller indistinct]

419
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:07,603
Davy Crockett.

420
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:10,106
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

421
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:13,342
- Howdy, Mr. Russel.
- Quite a frolic you got.

422
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:16,209
Ain't it?
Since Davy's been magistrate here,

423
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,408
we can enjoy ourselves
without it turnin' into a brawl.

424
00:42:19,483 --> 00:42:23,749
I'll do the tradin' and meet ya out
by the dance. Save a pretty girl for me.

425
00:42:23,821 --> 00:42:27,188
Before that fiddle gets into your foot,
I got some tidings for ya.

426
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:29,624
Come over to my place.
I'll tell ya about it.

427
00:42:29,694 --> 00:42:34,154
Folks around here is pretty proud
of the job you done for us, Davy.

428
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:39,192
Since you got rid of Big Foot,
honest settlers is movin' in.

429
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:43,001
There's so many of 'em we're gonna
get us representation in Nashville.

430
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:45,167
That's what I want to talk to you about.

431
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:49,646
We held a meetin' last night to pick
who we want to run for state legislature.

432
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:54,481
- You won hands down.
- [Chuckling]

433
00:42:55,653 --> 00:43:00,681
Well, I'm plumb flutterated by the honor,
but I ain't no politician.

434
00:43:00,758 --> 00:43:05,718
You got the wrong bear up a tree, Judge.
Better get somebody more fittin'.

435
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:10,699
Like Amos Thorpe?
That lawyer who tried to get Big Foot off?

436
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:14,499
- You wouldn't run him?
- We wouldn't, but the opposition is.

437
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:17,541
Thorpe's got plenty of money
to spend on a campaign.

438
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:20,008
Money he made off
them Injun land grabs.

439
00:43:20,077 --> 00:43:23,410
We figure you're the only man
that's got a chance of beatin' him.

440
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:25,745
Will ya run again' him?

441
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:30,117
The way you put it,
I ain't got much choice.

[Cheering, applauding]

Be right back.

It's only a month old too.

446
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:10,025
This ain't Polly's hand.

447
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:16,666
It's mighty poor writin'.
See if you can make it out.

448
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:22,395
- From your sister-in-law.
- Why'd she be writin'?

449

"Dear Davy, I take my pen in hand
to tell you some very sad news."

00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:07,081
but the good Lord knows best.

459
00:45:07,184 --> 00:45:09,709
Your loving sister-in-law."

460
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:15,214
[Sigh] Wish there was somethin'
I could say, Davy.

461
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:17,157
Anything I could do?

462
00:45:17,228 --> 00:45:20,891
Just give me some time by myself.

463
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:41,375
# Now he lost his love
And his grief was gall

464
00:45:41,452 --> 00:45:44,785
# In his heart he wanted to
Leave it all

465
00:45:44,855 --> 00:45:47,585
# And lose himself in the forest tall

466
00:45:49,593 --> 00:45:51,458
# But he answered instead
To his country's call

467
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:54,531
# Davy, Davy Crockett

468
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:59,968
# Beginnin' his campaign #

469
00:46:01,105 --> 00:46:03,266
Well, here it goes.

470
00:46:04,108 --> 00:46:08,340
My honorable opponent knows
I ain't much shucks at speechifyin'.

471
00:46:08,412 --> 00:46:13,042
Kind of him to let me speak first, so he
can make a lie out of everything I say.

472
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:14,209
[Crowd laughing]

473
00:46:14,285 --> 00:46:19,587
Truth is, I don't know nothing at all
about politics. I'll leave that up to him.

474
00:46:19,657 --> 00:46:22,717
But I do know the woods
and the folks in 'em.

475
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:26,422
If you send me to Nashville,
I'll represent you as honest as I can.

476
00:46:26,497 --> 00:46:28,556
Hooray for Davy.

477
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:32,465
I reckon that's all I got to say.

478
00:46:32,536 --> 00:46:36,063
If this here speech seems a mite brief,

479
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,735
looks like my worthy opponent's
all set to make up for it.

480
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:42,301
If his speech is gonna be
as dry as I think it is,

481
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:45,439
maybe we better go over
to the tavern and wet our whistles.

482
00:46:45,516 --> 00:46:47,814
[Cheering] Come on, boys.

483
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:51,545
Voters of the sovereign state
of Tennessee, I am well aware

484
00:46:51,622 --> 00:46:54,853
of the sacred responsibility
you're about to bestow on me...

485
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:57,655
# Sent up to Nashville
The best they could find

486
00:46:57,728 --> 00:47:01,289
# A fightin' spirit and a thinkin' mind

487
00:47:01,365 --> 00:47:04,698
# Davy, Davy Crockett

488
00:47:04,768 --> 00:47:09,296
# Choice of the whole frontier #

489
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:14,334
- Is Colonel Crockett at home?
- No, but I'm expectin' him directly.

490
00:47:14,411 --> 00:47:18,404
I'm Tobias Norton.
He served under me in the Indian wars.

491
00:47:18,482 --> 00:47:21,076
Would you like to wait in his room?

492
00:47:28,058 --> 00:47:32,654
- You remember me, don't you?
- So you're Tobias Norton.

493
00:47:33,264 --> 00:47:35,528
Never did know your first name, Major.

494
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,126
No rank any more, Davy.
I resigned from the Army three years ago.

495
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:42,468
- It's just plain Mr. Norton now.
- Sit down. What can I do for ya?

496
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,839
Just a sociable call.
I've been meaning to look you up.

497
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,969
Wish I could offer you something.

498
00:47:48,045 --> 00:47:50,809
No, thanks. I never drink
before sundown, Colonel.

499
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:55,045
I ain't rightly a colonel. That was
in the militia, out in the canebrake.

500
00:47:58,422 --> 00:48:01,983
We've watched your career
in the legislature with a lot of interest.

501
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:05,290
- Just who's "we"?
- Why, General Jackson and myself.

502
00:48:05,362 --> 00:48:07,728
As you may know,
we're opening a political battle

503
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:09,959
with the present administration.

504
00:48:10,034 --> 00:48:14,232
We're going to make Andrew Jackson
the next president of the United States.

505
00:48:14,305 --> 00:48:18,469
I had a notion old hickory-face
was travelin' along on his own shanks.

506
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:20,840
Well, everyone needs help, you know.

507
00:48:20,911 --> 00:48:24,642
I'm sort of a campaign manager,
unofficially of course.

508
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:27,643
Ever been out to the Hermitage?

509
00:48:27,718 --> 00:48:29,515
No, but I sure heard about it.

510
00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:33,956
I could get you an invitation.
The general would be glad to see you.

511
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:37,693
I'd admire that just fine.

512
00:48:46,937 --> 00:48:50,236
- Howdy, General.
- Welcome, Crockett.

513
00:48:51,342 --> 00:48:54,869
Come in. I'll be right down
soon as I get my boots on.

514
00:48:54,945 --> 00:48:57,379
Don't hurry, General.

515
00:49:03,254 --> 00:49:05,779
Good afternoon, Mr. Crockett.

516
00:49:09,793 --> 00:49:11,954
Take your hat, sir.

517
00:49:15,165 --> 00:49:17,292
Glad you could come out, Crockett.

518
00:49:18,602 --> 00:49:21,435
It's been a long time
since we've seen each other.

519
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:24,838
You ain't changed, except
you ain't so fearsome out of uniform.

520
00:49:24,908 --> 00:49:28,571
And you ain't so gamey without
your buckskins. Come on in.

521
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:34,476
Yes, everything's imported.

522
00:49:37,254 --> 00:49:39,620
Except this.

523
00:49:40,257 --> 00:49:42,782
Been savin' it for home folks.

524
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,260
Can't keep it in a decanter.
Eats the bottom out.

525
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,931
To your health, Crockett.

526
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,435
Here's somethin' else
I have to keep out of sight.

527
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:03,912
Exploits of Davy Crockett
in the Rocky Mountains.

528
00:50:03,981 --> 00:50:09,385
I ain't never been west of the
muddy ol' Mississip. Let me see that.

529
00:50:09,453 --> 00:50:11,887
Somebody's got a mighty
powerful imagination.

530
00:50:13,424 --> 00:50:15,949
"As told by his friend,
G.E. Russel."

531
00:50:16,026 --> 00:50:19,086
Georgie Russel.
I might've knowed.

532
00:50:19,163 --> 00:50:20,858
They're making you famous.

533
00:50:20,931 --> 00:50:24,059
Next to me you're about the most
famous man in Tennessee.

534
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:26,500
No wonder people's
taken to pointin' me out.

535
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,538
It's not only these yarns.

536
00:50:28,605 --> 00:50:31,540
You've made yourself quite
a name in local politics.

537
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:34,133
Soap is only good for
washin' dirty hands.

538
00:50:34,211 --> 00:50:37,009
Well, it's a fact.
Now, you listen to me.

539
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:38,946
I'm going to run for president.

540
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:41,951
My enemies will lift my scalp
if I get to Washington City.

541
00:50:42,019 --> 00:50:45,682
I intend to take theirs first,
if I can get the right kind of help.

542
00:50:45,756 --> 00:50:48,987
Crockett, I want you
to run for Congress.

543
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:53,291
Congress? General, you sure an old
head wound didn't trouble you a little?

544
00:50:53,364 --> 00:50:56,356
I mean it.
I want men I can trust.

545
00:50:56,433 --> 00:51:00,164
Men I know are with me.
Men that can get the country behind me.

546
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:04,205
If I was to do what
you asked and I did get in,

547
00:51:04,274 --> 00:51:06,538
I wouldn't be takin' orders from you.

548
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:09,807
I'd be takin' 'em
from them that elected me.

549
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:13,714
That's just the answer I hoped I'd get.

550
00:51:14,852 --> 00:51:17,753
# The votes were counted
And he won hands down

551
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:21,484
# So they sent him off
To Washington town

552
00:51:21,558 --> 00:51:25,494
# With his best dress suit
Still his buckskins brown

553
00:51:25,562 --> 00:51:29,293
# A livin' legend
Of growin' renown

554
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:32,995
# Davy, Davy Crockett

555
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:37,063
# The canebrake Congressman #

556
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:42,078
Good mornin'.

557
00:51:43,514 --> 00:51:45,482
Good mornin'.

558
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:50,012
Just a minute, Your Honor.
Hiya, Davy.

559
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:52,487
I wondered when you
was gonna show up.

560
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:55,787
You ol' bear wrestler you.
How are you?

561
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:58,020
I put up with your singin'
them lies about me,

562
00:51:58,095 --> 00:51:59,926
but printin' 'em is goin' too far.

563
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:03,023
- They helped put you here.
- Now I gotta live up to 'em.

564
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,365
You think I can go in dressed
like a respectable congressman?

565
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:09,600
I gotta go like the King of the Wild Frontier,
thanks to you.

566
00:52:09,673 --> 00:52:12,767
That's ungrateful.
I come all the way from the Obion River,

567
00:52:12,843 --> 00:52:14,834
to wish ya luck
on your maiden speech.

568
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:18,814
You just get yourself up in the gallery.
You're gonna hear a gullywhomper.

569
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,743
[Indistinct chatter]

570
00:52:23,587 --> 00:52:26,886
[Gavel pounding]

571
00:52:26,957 --> 00:52:29,790
Before we get to the order
of business for the day,

572
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,227
the chair will recognize the
new gentleman from Tennessee,

573
00:52:33,297 --> 00:52:36,596
the honorable David Crockett.

574
00:52:39,303 --> 00:52:42,101
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.

575
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:44,834
The fella around called
a Master-At-Arms

576
00:52:44,908 --> 00:52:48,002
tells me a new congressman's
supposed to make a speech.

577
00:52:48,078 --> 00:52:51,138
Well, here she goes.

578
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:55,015
I'm David Crockett,
fresh from the backwoods.

579
00:52:55,085 --> 00:52:58,987
I'm half horse, half alligator and
a little attached to a snappin' turtle.

580
00:52:59,056 --> 00:53:00,614
[All chuckling]

581
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:05,253
I got the fastest horse, the prettiest sister,
surest rifle and ugliest dog in Tennessee.

582
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:10,564
My father can lick
any man in Kentucky,

583
00:53:10,634 --> 00:53:13,626
and I can lick my father.

584
00:53:13,704 --> 00:53:18,004
I can hug a bear and eat any man
opposed to Andy Jackson.

585
00:53:20,878 --> 00:53:25,975
Some congressmen take pride in sayin'
a lot about nothin', like I'm doin' right now.

586
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:29,815
Others don't do nothin' for their pay
but just listen day in and day out.

587
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:32,913
I wish I may be shot
if I don't do more than listen.

588
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:37,450
The next time I get up before ya,
I'll have somethin' to say worth sayin'.

589
00:53:47,604 --> 00:53:52,303
Made yourself at home here.
Buildin' that stable for your racehorses?

590
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:55,106
Man's got to have a way
to get his mind off his troubles.

591
00:53:55,178 --> 00:53:58,614
This job's twice as tough as
fighting Injuns and ain't half the fun.

592
00:53:58,682 --> 00:54:00,081
I know what you mean.

593
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:03,017
More government business is done
at fancy dress balls

594
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:04,883
than on the floor of Congress.

595
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:08,482
A man's got to skin the cat
any way he can. You know that.

596
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,017
What's important is keepin'
men like you behind me, solid.

597
00:54:12,095 --> 00:54:15,223
You put a strain on a fella sometimes,
Mr. President.

598
00:54:15,299 --> 00:54:19,030
You're bound to make mistakes,
and you've made some humdingers.

599
00:54:19,102 --> 00:54:22,469
Davy, the President can't
think of just one group.

600
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:26,100
We're growing too fast.
There's nearly 13 million of us now.

601
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:29,304
We're bustin' at the seams.
We need room to grow.

602
00:54:29,379 --> 00:54:32,075
Expansion.
That's what I'm thinkin' of.

603
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:35,585
And by the eternal, I'll not let
anything stand in the way of that.

604
00:54:38,255 --> 00:54:42,089
Good morning, Congressman.
I'd like to speak to you a moment.

605
00:54:44,094 --> 00:54:46,961
I see ya ain't combed all
the nits out of your hair, Davy.

606
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:50,193
Norton's changed.
He's been a lot of help to me.

607
00:54:50,267 --> 00:54:55,034
I was planning to see you later.
How long have you been in town, Russel?

608
00:54:55,105 --> 00:54:58,541
I've arranged for you to do
a speaking tour of the big Eastern cities.

609
00:54:58,609 --> 00:55:02,010
- I got work to do.
- That can wait. This is more important.

610
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,946
You're the logical choice.

611
00:55:05,015 --> 00:55:09,111
- Now, hold on. Why me?
- You've become a national figure.

612
00:55:09,186 --> 00:55:11,916
Everybody's heard of you
and wants to see you.

613
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:16,289
- You can do a service for the country.
- By tellin' backwoods jokes?

614
00:55:17,494 --> 00:55:20,691
I'm serious, Davy.
This tour is an opportunity.

615
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:24,097
You've got to think ahead.
Jackson's in his second term.

616
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:27,625
In three years, they'll be
electing a new president.

617
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:30,502
And some of us have been
seriously considering you.

618
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:33,634
Under the circumstances,
you can't afford to pass this up.

619
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:37,646
- Is it convenient to leave Sunday?
- Well...

620
00:55:37,714 --> 00:55:40,239
- I guess so.
- I'll arrange your passage.

621
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,716
I enjoyed talking to you, Russel.

622
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:49,822
Davy, you used to have a motto.

623
00:55:49,893 --> 00:55:52,657
"Be sure you're right,
and then go ahead."

624
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:56,889
Well, I sure hope you're right.

625
00:55:56,967 --> 00:56:00,300
# Him and his jokes traveled
All through the land

626
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:03,669
# His speeches made him friends
To beat the band

627
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,766
# His politickin'
Was their favorite brand

628
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:10,472
# And everyone wanted
To shake his hand

629
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:14,005
# Davy, Davy Crockett

630
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:18,544
# Helpin' his legend grow #

631
00:56:20,757 --> 00:56:22,850
Citizens of Philadelphia,

632
00:56:23,894 --> 00:56:27,990
this here's the most beautiful rifle gun
I ever hope to see.

633
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:31,523
She's so pretty, I'll give her a name.
Betsy suit you folks?

634
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,176
Now you all heard about me baggin'
105 bears in one winter.

635
00:56:41,244 --> 00:56:43,712
Betsy here ain't gonna
come to no such use.

636
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,045
I don't get no joy out of
killin' critters like that no more.

637
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:50,553
Why, the last bear I treed
I brung home alive.

638
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,214
We tamed him and now he sits
at the table like a man.

639
00:56:55,092 --> 00:56:57,026
Named him Death Hug.

640
00:56:57,094 --> 00:57:01,053
I wouldn't wonder if he was smart enough
to travel and maybe go to Congress.

641
00:57:01,164 --> 00:57:03,758
[All laughing]

642
00:57:05,402 --> 00:57:10,567
Now, I hate long-winded speeches
and this one's long enough.

643
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,736
I'll always treasure this here
testimony of your friendship.

644
00:57:14,811 --> 00:57:19,077
With a gun like this a man could
put a rifle ball through the moon.

645
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:21,982
First chance I get, I'm gonna try it.
Thank you.

646
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:35,957
What sliver's under your toenail?

647
00:57:36,032 --> 00:57:38,557
Remember you tellin' me
how helpful Norton was?

648
00:57:38,635 --> 00:57:41,661
He helped you out of Washington
'cause you was in the way.

649
00:57:41,738 --> 00:57:43,899
- Of what?
- The President's Injun bill.

650
00:57:43,974 --> 00:57:46,875
- That's not on the floor.
- It's in debate now.

651
00:57:46,943 --> 00:57:48,001
What?

652
00:57:48,078 --> 00:57:52,515
Couple of your friends are tryin' to stall,
but no tellin' how long they can hold out.

653
00:57:52,582 --> 00:57:55,608
Looks like my tour's over now.
How's the quickest way back?

654
00:57:55,685 --> 00:57:59,018
- Way I come, in the saddle.
- I know where we can get fresh horses.

655
00:58:36,293 --> 00:58:38,659
Haven't you been able
to force the vote yet?

656
00:58:38,728 --> 00:58:41,526
The opposition won't yield the floor.

657
00:58:44,668 --> 00:58:46,795
Get them to call that vote.

658
00:58:48,038 --> 00:58:52,168
- I didn't expect you back for a week.
- I know.

659
00:58:52,242 --> 00:58:55,734
If you're worried about the Indian bill,
it's over. They've passed it.

660
00:58:55,812 --> 00:58:58,280
They'll have to change their minds.

661
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:03,012
I'm warning you. Go in there
and you commit political suicide.

662
00:59:03,086 --> 00:59:05,213
Know what I think about your politics?

663
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:16,459
I yield to the gentleman
from Tennessee.

664
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:25,732
Mr. Speaker,

665
00:59:25,809 --> 00:59:28,869
fellow members of the Congress
of these United States,

666
00:59:28,945 --> 00:59:32,676
I've stood before you a good
many times in fights and fun.

667
00:59:32,749 --> 00:59:35,684
We've had a laugh for the country
and our own digestion.

668
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:38,721
But you can fold up your grins
and put 'em away,

669
00:59:38,788 --> 00:59:42,053
for you'll hear no jokes
from Davy Crockett today.

670
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:45,094
You have before you somethin'
called an Indian bill.

671
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:47,721
I don't aim to keep you here
much longer arguing.

672
00:59:47,797 --> 00:59:49,526
You've had enough of that.

673
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,467
But before it comes to a vote,
I want to remind you of something.

674
00:59:53,536 --> 00:59:58,064
Expansion is a mighty fine thing.
Sure, we gotta grow.

675
00:59:58,141 --> 01:00:02,009
But not at the expense of the things
this country was founded to protect.

676
01:00:02,078 --> 01:00:06,310
The government's promises in the treaties
is as sacred as your own word.

677
01:00:06,383 --> 01:00:09,819
Expansion's no excuse for persecutin'
a whole part of our people

678
01:00:09,886 --> 01:00:13,447
because their skins are red
and they're uneducated to our ways.

679
01:00:13,523 --> 01:00:16,959
You wouldn't be doin' the settlers
no good votin' for this bill.

680
01:00:17,027 --> 01:00:22,727
You'd only be makin' rich men out of
the land grabbers tryin' to get it passed.

681
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:26,360
Now, just who are these scalawags?

682
01:00:26,436 --> 01:00:28,700
One of 'em could be the President,

683
01:00:28,772 --> 01:00:31,536
usin' this Congress for his own purpose.

684
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:34,702
But I've known General Jackson
for half of my born life,

685
01:00:34,778 --> 01:00:38,305
and I'm sure he's got nothin'
but the good of the country at heart.

686
01:00:38,381 --> 01:00:42,715
No, it's just a few thievin' varmints
hangin' on by givin' dinners and parties,

687
01:00:42,786 --> 01:00:45,619
reachin' for whatever
they can get a hold of.

688
01:00:45,689 --> 01:00:49,523
But they're a no-count lot,
'bout as natural as flies around molasses.

689
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:55,189
The real scalawags in this capitol
of the brave and free is us, you and me.

690
01:00:55,265 --> 01:00:59,201
I'm the worst of the lot. Reckon I've
missed as many sessions as any of you.

691
01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:02,534
Out shootin' my mouth off
when I should have been here.

692
01:01:02,605 --> 01:01:06,564
It's nobody's fault but our own
if a bill like this gets passed.

693
01:01:06,643 --> 01:01:12,104
We got a responsibility to this strappin',
fun-lovin' young bear cub of a country.

694
01:01:12,182 --> 01:01:16,585
We got a responsibility to help it grow into
the kind of nation the Lord meant it to be.

695
01:01:16,653 --> 01:01:21,818
If we showed we were the men our friends
figured we was when they sent us here,

696
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:25,292
a bill like this would never live
long enough to even get on our desks,

697
01:01:25,362 --> 01:01:27,694
let alone come to a vote.

698
01:01:37,674 --> 01:01:40,666
# He knew when he spoke
His career was done

699
01:01:40,744 --> 01:01:44,271
# But he spoke out strong
And his point he won

700
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:48,078
# Then packed his gear
And his trusty gun

701
01:01:48,151 --> 01:01:51,746
# And lit out a-grinnin'
To follow the sun

702
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:55,279
# Davy, Davy Crockett

703
01:01:55,358 --> 01:02:00,489
# Hittin' the trail again #

704
01:02:01,164 --> 01:02:03,462
Oh, there you are.

705
01:02:03,533 --> 01:02:05,194
Hey, Davy...

706
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:08,536
ain't you gonna get no sleep?

707
01:02:08,605 --> 01:02:11,039
- I've been doin' some thinkin'.
- Me too.

708
01:02:11,107 --> 01:02:15,066
We're pretty far downriver.
Ain't it time we decided where we're goin'?

709
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:18,581
- Always have had a good idea.
- Where?

710
01:02:25,722 --> 01:02:28,782
"Texas independence threatened."

711
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:32,225
"General Santa Ana
vows to expel settlers."

712
01:02:32,295 --> 01:02:34,229
Texas?

713
01:02:34,297 --> 01:02:38,825
We got the whole country to choose from,
and you gotta pick...

714
01:02:38,902 --> 01:02:42,895
- Nothin' there but a mess of trouble.
- Americans in trouble.

715
01:02:42,972 --> 01:02:47,432
A bunch of crazy fools tryin'
to take on a whole army.

716
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:51,844
They're so far away from the rest of
the country, they know they won't get help.

717
01:02:51,915 --> 01:02:56,352
A bunch of rock-headed idiots that won't
quit because they think they're right.

718
01:02:59,055 --> 01:03:03,082
How soon you reckon we'll
be headed out that way?

719
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:05,787
Right after we get to Little Rock.

720
01:03:08,598 --> 01:03:11,726
A magnificent birthright,
flung willfully into the gutter.

721
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:13,928
A superb inheritance of mind and body,

722
01:03:14,003 --> 01:03:17,234
squandered recklessly
in the muck of the common herd.

723
01:03:17,307 --> 01:03:20,970
Talents dissipated, courage abandoned,
character destroyed.

724
01:03:21,044 --> 01:03:24,536
Gentlemen, the very one
for whom I've been waiting.

725
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:28,607
'Tis truly written,
"Hope springs eternal."

726
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:32,485
I've been thinking I might yet
find redemption in the company

727
01:03:32,555 --> 01:03:36,889
of some peerless paragon of manhood
and virtue such as yourself.

728
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,291
You too, of course.

729
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:41,194
In other words, you want
Davy to be your backbone.

730
01:03:41,264 --> 01:03:44,893
Backbone?
That's putting it rather bluntly, sir.

731
01:03:44,968 --> 01:03:48,597
I am offering the Colonel
my incomparable companionship.

732
01:03:48,671 --> 01:03:52,300
Me and Russel are figurin'
on headin' down Texas way.

733
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:56,573
That ain't no place for a riverboat gambler
with wobbly knees.

734
01:03:56,646 --> 01:04:00,173
There are times when cowardice
is a virtue, my dear Colonel.

735
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,377
It makes choosing a course simple.

736
01:04:02,452 --> 01:04:05,148
I know nothing of this Texas,

737
01:04:05,221 --> 01:04:08,987
but I do know the fury
of the outraged minions of the law,

738
01:04:09,058 --> 01:04:11,925
and as a consequence,
I fear what lies behind me

739
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:15,055
far more than the unknown,
which lies ahead.

740
01:04:15,131 --> 01:04:19,465
Surely, you'll not deny me
the pleasure of your illustrious company.

741
01:04:22,238 --> 01:04:26,038
Look, in the mornin'
don't forget this was your idea.

742
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:28,976
# He heard of Houston
And Austin and so

743
01:04:29,045 --> 01:04:32,412
# To the Texas plains
He just had to go

744
01:04:32,482 --> 01:04:36,316
# Where land was free
And there was room to grow

745
01:04:36,386 --> 01:04:40,015
# And freedom was fightin'
Another foe

746
01:04:40,089 --> 01:04:43,456
# Davy, Davy Crockett

747
01:04:43,526 --> 01:04:48,020
# King of the wild frontier #

748
01:04:48,097 --> 01:04:49,962
Well, there she is.

749
01:04:50,033 --> 01:04:52,433
[Davy] Texas.

750
01:04:52,535 --> 01:04:55,333
There's room out there
for every dream I ever had.

751
01:04:55,405 --> 01:04:58,238
Yeah, there's room, all right.
Too much of it.

752
01:04:58,308 --> 01:05:00,970
A desolate, desiccated desert,

753
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:04,502
untouched by the hand
of man and God alike.

754
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:09,182
Well, there's somebody around,
and they know we're here.

755
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:15,983
- Indians?
- Probably Comanches.

756
01:05:16,092 --> 01:05:22,361
You mean, that barbaric horde
they call the Cossacks of the Plains?

757
01:05:22,432 --> 01:05:25,595
Same critters.
We better be gettin' out of here.

758
01:05:36,312 --> 01:05:39,042
[Low rumble]

759
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:40,673
Whoa.

760
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:47,520
- What unearthly manifestation is that?
- Supposin' we find out.

761
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:08,739
[Davy] There's your Comanches.

762
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:10,676
That's what stampeded 'em.

763
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:17,476
He's crazy. He's headed
into that prairie dog town.

764
01:07:02,298 --> 01:07:05,495
Don't just stand there.
Give me a hand.

765
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:07,502
Bite off more than you could chew?

766
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:10,903
He might not look it, but he's
a powerful lot of Indian.

767
01:07:10,973 --> 01:07:13,965
If we can patch him up,
he'll make us a good guide.

768
01:07:28,858 --> 01:07:32,954
I can hardly wait to sink my teeth
in this buffalo meat.

769
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:36,658
- Your friend's awake.
- [Davy] Good.

770
01:07:36,733 --> 01:07:39,167
Think I'll have a palaver with him.

771
01:07:42,071 --> 01:07:45,040
Can the Colonel actually
converse with that aborigine?

772
01:07:45,108 --> 01:07:46,166
Watch.

773
01:08:07,697 --> 01:08:10,723
He's tellin' Davy about himself
but I can't get it all.

774
01:08:12,935 --> 01:08:15,802
Near as I can make out,
this Indian's had a hard time.

775
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:18,636
He's been on many war parties
and never got a scalp.

776
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:22,144
The medicine man took his squaw
and kicked him out of the tribe.

777
01:08:22,211 --> 01:08:24,907
On top of that, his pony fell
and he lost a buffalo.

778
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:28,075
With all his busted luck,
sure you want him for a guide?

779
01:08:28,151 --> 01:08:31,917
Lucky we ran into him. If we'd have
kept on goin', we'd have lost our hair.

780
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:33,819
Lost our hair?

781
01:08:45,101 --> 01:08:47,433
Mmm, smells good.

782
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:50,097
Says he's willin' to lead us
to a white settlement.

783
01:08:50,173 --> 01:08:52,903
I, for one, do not trust
that perfidious savage.

784
01:08:52,975 --> 01:08:57,708
You better trust him. He's the only one
that knows the trail to the next water hole.

785
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:10,087
Mornin'.

786
01:09:10,226 --> 01:09:13,992
There's a settlement of Texans
down this way. Know where it is?

787
01:09:14,063 --> 01:09:17,464
- You mean San Antonio de Mexar?
- Yeah, that's her, San Antone.

788
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:19,501
It is not safe to go over there.

789
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:21,867
General Santa Ana
has already taken Mexar.

790
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,873
If he's taken the town,
where are the Texans?

791
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:29,105
In the Alamo,
an old mission across the river.

792
01:09:29,178 --> 01:09:32,306
- We got here a mite late.
- Let's see if we can make up for it.

793
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:37,114
You must not go there. The Alamo
has been surrounded by a big army,

794
01:09:37,186 --> 01:09:39,313
and there's many patrols all over.

795
01:09:39,388 --> 01:09:41,856
We got through Injun country
without trouble.

796
01:09:41,924 --> 01:09:43,949
Company, forward.

797
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:53,799
[Speaking Spanish]

798
01:10:09,018 --> 01:10:11,953
- They don't look very friendly.
- Let's get.

799
01:10:26,168 --> 01:10:28,602
[Gunshots]

800
01:11:33,903 --> 01:11:35,700
[Rifle shots]

801
01:11:43,012 --> 01:11:44,912
[Distant gunshots]

802
01:11:47,149 --> 01:11:48,810
Cover 'em.

803
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:04,297
- That was a tight squeeze. You all right?
- I reckon.

804
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:06,164
- You in command?
- I'm second.

805
01:12:06,235 --> 01:12:09,500
- Col. Bowie's commander.
- The fella who invented the knife?

806
01:12:09,572 --> 01:12:11,802
That's him. Come on.

807
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:15,071
He's been laid up. He took a fall
helping us mount the cannon.

808
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:18,204
The fever's been giving him
the devil ever since.

809
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,908
Colonel, we have more reinforcements.

810
01:12:20,983 --> 01:12:24,384
- I'll see your men are taken care of.
- Thank you.

811
01:12:24,453 --> 01:12:27,217
- Colonel Bowie?
- Yeah.

812
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:29,621
I brought a company in
and wanted to report.

813
01:12:29,692 --> 01:12:31,751
I'm Davy Crockett
from Tennessee.

814
01:12:31,827 --> 01:12:35,524
Davy Crockett.
I should've known.

815
01:12:35,598 --> 01:12:40,092
By God, I never hoped to see you
in this neck of the woods. Sit down.

816
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:42,637
[Coughs] I can't get rid of this cough.

817
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:47,836
- Tell me. How many men did you bring?
- Four, includin' myself.

818
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:51,141
Four?
Two acres of wall to defend.

819
01:12:51,213 --> 01:12:54,376
It'd take 1,000 troops to man
this garrison adequately.

820
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:56,441
I've got less than 200 volunteers.

821
01:12:56,519 --> 01:12:59,511
200 stubborn men
can do a lot of fightin'.

822
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:01,852
Crockett, I'm gonna be honest with you.

823
01:13:01,924 --> 01:13:05,087
This miserable excuse
of a fort is our last chance.

824
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:10,189
If we can't hold Santa Ana until Houston
reorganizes our army, Texas is lost.

825
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:13,667
Well, we'll just have to hold her.

826
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:16,201
Right.

827
01:13:16,272 --> 01:13:18,706
I want to tell you
what we're up against.

828
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:20,765
We're practically encircled.

829
01:13:20,843 --> 01:13:23,573
On top of that, we don't
have enough rations left

830
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:25,840
for a good-sized family dinner.

831
01:13:25,915 --> 01:13:30,852
Powder? There's about enough left
for a turkey shoot.

832
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,787
None of this goes
outside this room.

833
01:13:33,856 --> 01:13:38,520
Sure, Colonel. These 200 you got,
ain't there any more Texans around?

834
01:13:38,594 --> 01:13:40,687
We've been sending messengers out.

835
01:13:40,763 --> 01:13:44,199
One did get back from Gonzales
with 32 men.

836
01:13:44,266 --> 01:13:48,430
There's a fair-sized force at Goliad.
We sent a courier a few days ago.

837
01:13:48,504 --> 01:13:52,235
- But I don't think he made it.
- I'll take a crack at gettin' through.

838
01:13:52,308 --> 01:13:56,472
No, we need your breed of men here.
Half horse, half alligator.

839
01:13:56,545 --> 01:13:59,537
The amount of powder in the gun's
not near as important

840
01:13:59,615 --> 01:14:02,243
as the spirit of the men
behind the sights.

841
01:14:02,318 --> 01:14:04,343
Half any battle's
knowing you'll win.

842
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:08,789
Crockett, for the first time since
I've been here, I believe we can hold out.

843
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:13,758
With old Betsy here, and this here
Arkansas toothpick of yourn,

844
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:16,127
how can we lose?

845
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:24,038
Look at that camp. Every morning
there's twice as many as the night before.

846
01:14:24,106 --> 01:14:25,835
I bet there's 2,000 of them.

847
01:14:25,908 --> 01:14:30,106
Why did Santa Ana call that truce,
sent for that messenger?

848
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:32,647
[Russel] Whatever it is, it ain't good.

849
01:14:42,992 --> 01:14:45,859
With His Excellency's compliments.

850
01:14:45,928 --> 01:14:48,226
Crockett, come down here.

851
01:14:55,237 --> 01:14:57,205
Listen to this, Colonel.

852
01:14:57,273 --> 01:15:00,606
[In Spanish]

853
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:04,669
It's so flowery, it must've
been written by some other attorney.

854
01:15:04,747 --> 01:15:08,513
Roughly translated, it means
we surrender on his terms or...

855
01:15:08,584 --> 01:15:11,678
- I ain't much authority on surrenderin'.
- Neither am I.

856
01:15:11,754 --> 01:15:13,688
Moriarty.

857
01:15:14,456 --> 01:15:16,947
His Excellency's
offered to let us surrender.

858
01:15:17,026 --> 01:15:21,224
He's waitin' for an answer.
Let's give it to him. Fire in the hole!

859
01:15:50,392 --> 01:15:52,417
Hit the dust.

860
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:03,733
They say that war is the most
exalted experience a man can endure.

861
01:16:03,806 --> 01:16:07,503
To me, it's the most miserable
and untheatrical method of suicide.

862
01:16:07,576 --> 01:16:10,511
Shelled us all night and all day,
ain't hit a man yet.

863
01:16:10,579 --> 01:16:12,638
You ain't got nothin' to worry about.

864
01:16:12,715 --> 01:16:15,878
Ain't nobody gonna hit you.
You're too shifty.

865
01:16:19,488 --> 01:16:22,924
You volunteers better get
food and rest while you can.

866
01:16:22,992 --> 01:16:25,825
Sorry, no rest for the
gunners and officers.

867
01:16:25,895 --> 01:16:28,591
Go get some food.
You too.

868
01:16:28,664 --> 01:16:30,461
Take your relief, men.

869
01:16:31,433 --> 01:16:33,799
I'll get yours for you, Davy.

870
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:39,499
Some of the boys are gettin'
worn pretty thin.

871
01:16:39,575 --> 01:16:42,408
Four days and no casualties yet.
Incredible.

872
01:16:42,478 --> 01:16:44,469
How much longer
will our luck hold up?

873
01:16:44,546 --> 01:16:47,014
This ain't luck.
It's the hand of Providence.

874
01:16:47,082 --> 01:16:50,415
- You really believe that?
- I sure do.

875
01:16:50,486 --> 01:16:52,317
So do I, Davy.

876
01:16:52,388 --> 01:16:54,720
You call that a serving?

877
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:58,954
It's difficult to maintain
manly courage on this provender.

878
01:17:03,565 --> 01:17:07,467
Would you care to tempt lady luck,
double or nothing?

879
01:17:07,536 --> 01:17:11,063
Why not?
My stomach sure ain't gonna miss this.

880
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:15,543
You hold the stakes, Busted Luck.
Come, my sporting friend.

881
01:17:15,611 --> 01:17:19,172
We'll venture our fortunes
with the elusive pea.

882
01:17:19,248 --> 01:17:24,083
Neither voodoo, hoodoo nor Hindu.
Prestidigitation, an old and honorable art.

883
01:17:24,153 --> 01:17:26,519
Now you see it, now you don't.
Choose.

884
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:38,662
Oh, you'd risk your pittance of food
for a chance of a full belly?

885
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:44,434
Very well, my hungry aborigine,
since you thrust the wager upon me...

886
01:17:44,506 --> 01:17:46,599
Choose.

887
01:17:46,675 --> 01:17:48,336
There.

888
01:18:17,172 --> 01:18:20,300
- How ya doin'?
- Keepin' awake.

889
01:18:20,376 --> 01:18:22,936
I just found out somethin'.

890
01:18:23,012 --> 01:18:25,776
We're sittin' here like a bunch
of treed possums.

891
01:18:25,848 --> 01:18:28,749
We're about out of ammunition.
There's no help comin'.

892
01:18:28,817 --> 01:18:32,253
I knowed that since the day we got here.
We're still holdin' out.

893
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:35,654
Since the day we...
You knowed it since then?

894
01:18:35,724 --> 01:18:38,022
Colonel asked me not to say anything.

895
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:40,288
You knowed and
you couldn't trust me,

896
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:43,160
after all the tight ones
we've been through?

897
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:45,325
I thought we was in this together.

898
01:18:45,401 --> 01:18:48,268
We're both wore out.
Go get some sleep.

899
01:18:48,337 --> 01:18:52,273
All right. From now on,
it's every man for hisself.

900
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:07,586
- What do you want?
- I had to see you.

901
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:09,317
Was it necessary to wake me up?

902
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:12,656
I ain't scared of fightin',
but this is gonna be a massacre.

903
01:19:12,728 --> 01:19:15,788
- Not if we get help from Goliad.
- But you ain't got it.

904
01:19:15,864 --> 01:19:20,062
You ain't got no way of tellin' unless
you get a messenger through.

905
01:19:20,135 --> 01:19:21,727
You think you can make it?

906
01:19:21,804 --> 01:19:25,638
I've been in and out of bear traps
all my life. I ain't lost no toes yet.

907
01:19:25,707 --> 01:19:28,175
- When do you want to try?
- Right now.

908
01:19:28,243 --> 01:19:30,541
I'll have the Colonel's
horse saddled up.

909
01:19:30,612 --> 01:19:33,740
Good. Now, how do I get
to this Goliad town?

910
01:19:33,816 --> 01:19:36,341
That's a good question.

911
01:19:36,418 --> 01:19:40,081
Here's a drainage ditch,
sort of a sunken road.

912
01:19:40,155 --> 01:19:44,285
If the moon's behind a cloud
and the sentries are asleep,

913
01:19:44,359 --> 01:19:47,556
and if you have more luck
than one man's entitled to,

914
01:19:47,629 --> 01:19:49,756
you might get through
their lines here.

915
01:19:55,571 --> 01:19:58,096
- Why, that man's deserting.
- Deserting?

916
01:19:58,173 --> 01:20:00,869
That's Russel trying to make it
to Goliad for help.

917
01:20:00,943 --> 01:20:02,911
Russel?

918
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:19,991
If you're worrying about Russel, don't.

919
01:20:20,062 --> 01:20:23,930
He's only been gone two days.
It's nearly 100 miles to Goliad.

920
01:20:23,999 --> 01:20:27,901
- Couldn't make it back, then.
- Not yet. He'd have to wait for darkness.

921
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:29,835
[Explosion]

922
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:36,502
- There she is.
- Gun crew, over there in that draw.

923
01:20:36,578 --> 01:20:39,308
Save the big pop gun.
It eats too much powder.

924
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:42,214
They ain't as far off as they think
they are, are they?

925
01:20:42,284 --> 01:20:44,616
Obligin' of 'em to move in so close.

926
01:20:44,686 --> 01:20:46,551
Moriarty, hold it.

927
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:52,358
- Leave a mite too much windage.
- Raise my sights a mite.

928
01:20:52,427 --> 01:20:55,419
Guess you boys haven't
had enough practice.

929
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,925
He says old Betsy'll reach.

930
01:21:11,213 --> 01:21:12,510
[Cheering]

931
01:21:13,982 --> 01:21:15,745
That's more like it.

932
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:32,594
Hey, it's Russel.

933
01:21:33,702 --> 01:21:36,170
- Open the gates.
- [Rifle shots]

934
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:47,548
- How many men will they send us?
- They can't spare us none.

935
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:50,608
You eternal idiot.
You was safe, in the clear.

936
01:21:50,686 --> 01:21:54,281
- What'd you come back for?
- Just got lonesome, I reckon.

937
01:21:56,391 --> 01:21:58,586
Notched you up like an ol' razorback.

938
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:01,060
They can't shoot for sour apples.

939
01:22:01,129 --> 01:22:05,463
We won't get any help from Goliad.
I can't keep this from my men any longer.

940
01:22:05,534 --> 01:22:07,331
Break it to Colonel Bowie.

941
01:22:07,402 --> 01:22:11,168
Have him move to a room in the chapel
where there's more protection.

942
01:22:11,974 --> 01:22:14,636
[Gunfire]

943
01:22:30,425 --> 01:22:32,916
Oh, it's you, Davy.

944
01:22:33,729 --> 01:22:36,061
Mighty good of you
to keep lookin' in on me.

945
01:22:36,131 --> 01:22:38,964
When a man's laid up,
he gets tired of his own company.

946
01:22:39,034 --> 01:22:41,229
I'm glad to see a friend's face.

947
01:22:41,303 --> 01:22:43,897
Friends for less than a week.

948
01:22:44,706 --> 01:22:47,140
Pity we didn't meet before.

949
01:22:49,177 --> 01:22:51,270
Russel made it back from Goliad.

950
01:22:51,346 --> 01:22:53,337
Tell me, did he...

951
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:56,344
No help.

952
01:22:59,221 --> 01:23:03,351
I brought those men in here.
Reckon I better be with 'em now.

953
01:23:03,425 --> 01:23:06,553
Take it easy, Colonel.
I'll get you outside.

954
01:23:09,598 --> 01:23:12,226
Hornbuckle. Contreras.

955
01:23:14,636 --> 01:23:17,127
Move the Colonel outside.

956
01:23:17,472 --> 01:23:22,136
I've called you all together
because it's time you knew the truth.

957
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:24,474
Russel brings bad news, men.

958
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:27,515
The defense of the Alamo
rests on us alone.

959
01:23:28,216 --> 01:23:32,118
General Santa Ana has nearly
5,000 men massed against us.

960
01:23:32,187 --> 01:23:37,591
I can't force you beyond patriotism
and your own conscience.

961
01:23:37,659 --> 01:23:41,288
While it's still dark,
there's time to slip off to safety.

962
01:23:41,363 --> 01:23:44,662
I won't blame any man
who doesn't stay.

963
01:23:52,974 --> 01:23:57,001
Those who stay,
cross over the line.

964
01:24:00,982 --> 01:24:03,314
Boys, I don't think
I can make it myself.

965
01:24:03,385 --> 01:24:06,115
I'd appreciate it if some of you
would help me across.

966
01:24:25,841 --> 01:24:27,706
Thank you, men.

967
01:24:49,064 --> 01:24:53,433
- It's been a long time for us, Georgie.
- Yeah, a lot of years.

968
01:24:54,836 --> 01:24:57,396
A lot of things to remember.

969
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:59,497
Play us a little tune.

970
01:24:59,574 --> 01:25:02,702
Why don't you play one, Davy?

971
01:25:02,778 --> 01:25:06,737
That piece you made up when we was
leavin' the green hills of Tennessee.

972
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:10,911
- Figured you'd remember that 'un.
- Yeah, it's the only one you ever writ.

973
01:25:10,986 --> 01:25:13,477
Fellas like it too.

Hadn't you better get a little rest?

1001
01:27:23,151 --> 01:27:26,848
It's a capital idea.
It may be our last.

1002
01:27:39,134 --> 01:27:40,931
They're on us.

Colonel, what's that bugle call
they were playin'?

That's their signal for no quarter.

1008
01:28:35,523 --> 01:28:38,856
Yeah?
Well, they'll be playin' that again.

Here they come.
