00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:36,418
Narrator: In 1804,
president thomas jefferson

3
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,053
Commissioned meriweather lewis
and william clark

4
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:43,290
To explore the vast, uncharted
territories of the northwest.

5
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:47,560
What most people don't know is
there was a second expedition,

6
00:02:47,562 --> 00:02:48,894
Led by 2 other men,

7
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:51,296
Men that may not have
possessed the courage,

8
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:54,198
Vision, or intelligence
of lewis and clark,

9
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,733
But men nonetheless.

10
00:02:56,735 --> 00:02:59,035
Their story, such as it is,

11
00:02:59,037 --> 00:03:02,171
Begins in
arlington, virginia.

12
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:11,144
[screaming]

13
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:19,985
Yaah! It'll take more...

14
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:21,686
Than a couple of fops...

15
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:24,922
To take me down!
I tell you--

16
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:28,091
I hope satan himself
burns the flesh

17
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,159
From your
miserable bones!

18
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:32,794
Good god, lady.

19
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,797
Get your hands
off me!

20
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,800
Leave me alone!

21
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:51,477
[gasps]

22
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:57,415
Faster, man, faster!

23
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:58,783
But not too fast!

24
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:00,417
As much haste as possible

25
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,119
While maintaining a
tolerable level of comfort.

26
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:06,856
A man's life is
at stake. Ah-ah!

27
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:10,226
On march 25, 1804,

28
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:13,562
Bartholomew hunt,
a tracker employed by

29
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:16,164
The army of the
united states of america,

30
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,966
Was found guilty of drunken
and disorderly conduct

31
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,167
In the presence
of an officer.

32
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:24,637
Then later, he forced
that officer to waltz with him

33
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,505
Through a crowded mess hall.

34
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:28,773
[gasps]

35
00:04:31,677 --> 00:04:33,777
Have you
anything to say?

36
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:36,246
Yes, i do.

37
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:40,582
When i am dead and have
passed on to the next world,

38
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:45,453
I want you to lower me
from these gallows and...

39
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:48,222
Kiss my hairy buttocks!

40
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:51,091
Hang him!
Hang him!

41
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:52,892
Hang him!
Hang him!

42
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:54,860
Hang him,
then shoot him!

43
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,895
[crowd chanting]

44
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,465
Hang him!
Hang him!

45
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,934
Hang him!
Hang him!

46
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:09,304
May god have mercy
on this man.

47
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:12,740
Aah!

48
00:05:12,742 --> 00:05:14,108
Oh!

49
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:15,475
Out of the way!
Get back. Get back.

50
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:18,312
Out of the way. Get back.
Out of the way.

51
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:20,247
[choking]

52
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:23,149
I have a stay of execution

53
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:25,618
Signed by
president jefferson himself!

54
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,987
See? He signed it right here.

55
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:30,656
"thomas jefferson"!

56
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:33,759
[choking]

57
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:34,726
Sorry.

58
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:36,728
Thank you.

59
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:39,463
[gagging]
oh, god!

60
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:42,566
Mr. Hunt, i plan
on being the first man

61
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:44,067
To map a route
to the pacific,

62
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:46,936
But i require
an expert guide.

63
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:50,139
You wanted a tracker,
why'd you choose me?

64
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,474
Why didn't you
get william clark?

65
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:54,476
Don't you think
i tried?

66
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:55,310
Oh.

67
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:57,545
Meriweather lewis
beat me to him.

68
00:05:57,547 --> 00:05:58,946
I'm sick to death
of those two!

69
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:01,548
Lewis and clark this,
lewis and clark that!

70
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,583
Well, we'll see
who talks about them

71
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:05,151
After we beat them
to the pacific.

72
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:07,720
We'll see who gets invited
to the finest parties.

73
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:10,723
We'll see who parlays
their accomplishments

74
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:13,659
Into a political career.

75
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:15,827
When the history books
are written,

76
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:18,496
Lewis and clark will be but
a footnote to a footnote,

77
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:23,234
And i, sir,
will be the note!

78
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:28,071
My hands will grow rough,

79
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:29,973
My teeth may yellow,

80
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,874
I might even experience
a soreness in the joints.

81
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:34,910
Yes, this mission will be
a treacherous one,

82
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:37,763
Make no mistake.

83
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,615
We will face danger from
savages<i> and</i> from bears.

84
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:41,415
Oh.

85
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,216
These bears are wild,
mind you,

86
00:06:43,218 --> 00:06:47,219
Not trained
carnival bears with...

87
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:48,820
Little hats.

88
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:50,588
Sounds
exhilarating, sir.

89
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,756
Few men would have
the courage

90
00:06:52,758 --> 00:06:55,742
For such
an endeavor.

91
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,727
I'm not afraid, mr. Burr.
My mind will protect me.

92
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:01,196
I'm a man of science,
a man of learning,

93
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:04,566
A man who knows how
to buy the finest books.

94
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:06,200
Fear will be our breakfast

95
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:09,570
And stark, raving terror
our daily luncheon.

96
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:12,305
Eh, mr. Hunt?

97
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,674
Mr. Hunt?

98
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:20,144
I'd be more worried about
the indians than the bears.

99
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:22,446
It's common knowledge

100
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:24,747
That when the savages
capture a white man,

101
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,351
They will split open his head,
pick out his brains,

102
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:33,588
And eat them with
a crudely-fashioned fork.

103
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,855
So...

104
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:38,558
Have you witnessed
such atrocities?

105
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,995
I've, uh, seen the forks.

106
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:53,972
You look like a man who
appreciates good whiskey.

107
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:58,041
Uh, thank you, sir,
but i fear inebriation

108
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:00,309
May cause me
to forget my manners

109
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:01,843
In such fine company.

110
00:08:01,845 --> 00:08:05,313
Good god, i'm not talking
about getting blind drunk.

111
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:07,782
I just meant for you
to have a taste.

112
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:09,984
Well, then...

113
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:12,853
A taste it shall be.

114
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:22,060
Ahh...Ha ha!

115
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:23,861
Not bad.

116
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:25,495
[chuckles]

117
00:08:25,497 --> 00:08:29,198
How about you get
your own bottle?

118
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:34,035
[belching]

119
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:38,071
Whoa-oa-oap!

[groaning]

121
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:45,261
Good morning.

122
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:47,179
I had jonah put you
in here last night.

123
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:49,948
It seemed a barn was
the only suitable place

124
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,449
For a man
in your condition.

125
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:55,852
I think there was something
wrong with that whiskey.

126
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:58,287
My head is splittin' open.

127
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:01,123
I'm surprised
you're hung over at all,

128
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,290
Considering the amount

129
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,026
You regurgitated
into the harpsichord.

130
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:09,029
[groaning]
oh, god.

131
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:13,666
Look, um,
sorry about that.

132
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:16,835
I'd better go now.

133
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:18,236
Mr. Hunt, mr. Hunt.

134
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:20,438
I cannot go on this
journey without you.

135
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,740
I'm offering you
a full partnership.

136
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:25,209
What do you
think of that?

137
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:28,312
I think it ain't worth
the spit you wasted saying it.

138
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:33,016
I'm also willing
to pay you $100.

139
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:38,320
200.

140
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:39,821
125.

141
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:41,489
150.

142
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:44,058
Deal.

143
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,861
Ha ha ha! Great things
are in store for us!

144
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:51,164
Soon our names
will be on the lips of...

145
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,534
Well, on a great many
influential lips.

146
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:55,701
[pigs squealing]

147
00:09:55,703 --> 00:09:57,536
Are you listening,
mr. Hunt?

148
00:09:57,538 --> 00:09:59,371
Mr. Hunt?

149
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:01,039
Ah.

150
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:06,810
I believe those pigs would
prefer their privacy.

151
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:12,014
Hell, paid good money to see
this onstage in louisville.

152
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:14,182
Of course, there,
the pigs were dressed

153
00:10:14,184 --> 00:10:16,450
Like the king and queen
of france.

154
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:21,855
Ah, costumes.
Legitimate theater.

155
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,367
I'm looking
for leslie edwards.

156
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:36,534
I am leslie edwards.

157
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,771
My name's jackson.
It's been my lifelong dream

158
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,073
To see the pacific ocean
before i die.

159
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,507
Please take me with you.

160
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,408
An old bag of bones
like you

161
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,910
Wouldn't make it
100 yards upriver.

162
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:52,013
On my worst day, i could still
beat the stuffing outta you,

163
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:54,015
You puffed-up crow's cock.

164
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:55,449
No, you couldn't.

165
00:10:55,451 --> 00:10:58,718
I know.
Please take me with you.

166
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,486
I must see the pacific.

167
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:02,955
Can you deny
an old man his dream?

168
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:05,557
I cannot,
and i will not.

169
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,193
Jackson,
you may accompany us.

170
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:10,928
Horse's ass.

171
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,828
Turd.

172
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,829
Help us load the boats.

173
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:16,799
Sorry, can't do.
I'm an old man.

174
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:21,535
Edwards, this man says you
hired him as an interpreter.

175
00:11:21,537 --> 00:11:24,004
You must be
guy fontenot.

176
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:25,055
I am.

177
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:26,105
It is my understanding
you have mastered

178
00:11:26,108 --> 00:11:29,109
The languages of all
the indigenous population

179
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:31,077
From here to the pacific.

180
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,745
Who told you this?

181
00:11:32,747 --> 00:11:35,180
Why, you did,
in your letter.

182
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:38,016
My letter.

183
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:39,851
Ah, the letter.

184
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:42,220
Yes. Then
it is the truth.

185
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:42,954
Wonderful.

186
00:11:42,956 --> 00:11:46,557
Which boat will we be in?

187
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,391
We?

188
00:11:47,393 --> 00:11:49,659
Fontenot wants
to bring his wife.

189
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:50,793
I told him he can't.

190
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:53,762
She's not my wife.
Not my wife.

191
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:58,066
I buy her. She belong
to me as a property.

192
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:01,636
Well, the distinction
has been noted.

193
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,372
Unfortunately, the boats
have been fully loaded,

194
00:12:04,374 --> 00:12:07,975
And we haven't even taken
on my hats and tea service.

195
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,978
They say you can't come.

196
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:18,684
You didn't
let me finish.

197
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:20,952
Certainly
we can make room.

198
00:12:20,954 --> 00:12:23,988
I mean,
who needs tea?

199
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,689
Let it be known...

200
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:31,359
That if i catch any man
looking at her...

201
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:33,928
I will gut him like a pig.

202
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,432
Yes. I'll see if i can
work that into my speech.

203
00:12:42,336 --> 00:12:43,768
Hey!

204
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,803
Uh-uh.

205
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:48,371
[mutters]

206
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:51,006
Edwards: Father.

207
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:54,408
Dear lord in heaven...

208
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,745
Bless us as we leave
this christian world...

209
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:00,797
And give us courage

210
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:02,848
To bring your gospel
of love and tolerance

211
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:06,852
To the ignorant, godless
savages who await us.

212
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,620
Amen.

213
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,954
Amen.
Amen.                   Amen.

214
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,722
Amen.

215
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,090
All right, let's go!

216
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:16,759
Hold on, mr. Hunt.
Hold on, everyone.

217
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:18,960
I've prepared
a short address

218
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:21,362
To commemorate
our embarkation.

219
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:22,396
Here we go.

220
00:13:22,398 --> 00:13:24,197
Men, we are about to embark

221
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:28,601
On an unprecedented adventure
to the great northwest.

222
00:13:28,603 --> 00:13:32,337
Unfortunately, lewis and clark
have a 2-week head start,

223
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,839
So time is of the essence.

224
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:37,374
We will be pushing
up the missouri--

225
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:39,676
What? Against
the current?

226
00:13:39,678 --> 00:13:43,112
Mightn't it be easier
to go down the mississippi

227
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,680
Instead of up the missouri?

228
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:46,682
Yes, it most
certainly would be.

229
00:13:46,684 --> 00:13:49,751
We could go to
new orleans instead.

230
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:52,053
Ooh.

231
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:54,354
Gentlemen, we have already
been to new orleans.

232
00:13:54,357 --> 00:13:57,458
I've been to new orleans.
It's wonderful.

233
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,759
I've been there as well.

234
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:01,094
The food alone
is worth the trip.

235
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:04,297
The food.
Sir, oh, the food!

236
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:06,532
New orleans!
New orleans!

237
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:08,800
New orleans!
New orleans!

238
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:10,935
New orleans!
New orleans!

239
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:12,569
All right, fine!

240
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:14,571
Any man who is
too cowardly to share

241
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:16,606
The greatest adventure in
our young country's history

242
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:20,109
And would rather experience
the decadence of new orleans...

243
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:22,978
Well, then go right ahead.

244
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,480
[cheering and whooping]

245
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:31,483
Mr. Hunt, do something.

246
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,687
Next man
who leaves for new orleans

247
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:40,590
Will do so with a lead ball
in his back!

248
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:44,559
Need i remind you that
you all have signed contracts?

249
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:45,793
What about them?

250
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:49,596
Well, they will be
dealt with.

251
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,397
By who?

252
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,666
All right, they escaped.

253
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:57,602
Now, get in the boat!

254
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:01,371
Everyone!

255
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,908
Edwards: And so,
our journey begins.

256
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,110
I believe the men and i
share a tremendous sense

257
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:13,380
Of excitement and anticipation
for what lies ahead.

258
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:15,815

260
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,924
Thank you, higgins.

261
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,259
Your music will be a welcome
companion on our journey.

262
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,162
We will be following the map
of trapper pierre leblanc

263
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:36,032
Who explored the missouri
in 1792.

264
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:38,401
Hunt, you've traversed
most of these territories.

265
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:42,271
Tell the men what they
might expect to encounter.

266
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,690
Ok.

267
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:47,108
Well, what i remember
most were the animals.

268
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,576
Ah, the animals.

269
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:55,848
Fearsome beasts of
the mountains and plains.

270
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,782
[laughs]

271
00:15:56,784 --> 00:15:59,417
I seen a bear so powerful

272
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:02,720
That it snapped
a man's body in half

273
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:04,988
With its huge jaws.

274
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,991
[snarling]

275
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,427
I seen a badger with paws
as big as frying pans.

276
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,730
Now, that'd rip your face
right off. Right off!

277
00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:18,899
There's nothing you can do
with that! Just rip it off!

278
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:23,369
Once there was a hawk that
swooped down from the sky...

Caw! Caw! Caw!

out of his sockets.

Ow! Aah!

what he's up against.

We are now spending
our first night in the wilds.

From this point on,
hardship and depravation

Will be

brutal out here!

The water's nowhere near
as hot as it was in virginia.

I wouldn't know, sir.

Personally, i just finished
washing my privates

My paisley robe
this evening.

It's your
prerogative, sir.

00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,958
Yes, it is.

Mr. Hunt here
to see you, sir.

315
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:25,666
I just thought i'd tell you

316
00:18:25,668 --> 00:18:28,101
There's already a problem
with the men's morale.

It's our first night out.

318
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:31,137
How can there
already be a problem?

319
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:34,273
Well, one faction feels
you don't care about them.

320
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:37,809
Another feels the original
goals of the expedition

321
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:40,545
Have been abandoned
for quick profits.

322
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:43,347
You, uh...

323
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:46,650
You have to keep on top
of these things.

00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:50,753
Edwards: And we are
all in this together.

We are no different
from one another.

00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:55,757
Except, of course,
for our rank in society

327
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,160
And in this company.

328
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:03,163
Let us get
better acquainted.

329
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:06,432
What do you do with
your leisure time?

330
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:08,933
Leisure time...

331
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:10,701
You know,
time for yourself

332
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:13,403
Where you
don't have to work.

333
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:16,138
Leisure--

334
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:18,640
Never mind.

335
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:21,442
You there, fingering
that stomach wound,

336
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:26,013
Stand up and tell us
a little about yourself.

337
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:26,747
Me, sir?

338
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,550
Yes, you.
Bidwell, isn't it?

339
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:33,752
Yes, sir.

340
00:19:33,754 --> 00:19:35,820
What did you
want to know?

341
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:38,189
Well, anything.
Where are you from?

342
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:41,258
What's your family like?

343
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,427
Name's bidwell, sir.

344
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:46,929
Yes, i know that.

345
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:49,764
All right.
Anyone else?

346
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:52,233
Sir? Higgins
has a story.

347
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:55,536
Oh! Oh, yes, you're
gonna love this one.

348
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:59,439
Well, all right, higgins.
The floor is yours.

[clears throat]

350
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:04,309
This particular event
happened last summer

351
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:06,644
On my uncle's farm
in virginia.

352
00:20:06,646 --> 00:20:07,878
My brother and i

353
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,714
Had just finished
cutting a field of hay

354
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:12,782
And were enjoying
the evening meal

355
00:20:12,784 --> 00:20:14,950
Under the shade
of an elm tree.

356
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:18,086
He went down for water
by the creek,

357
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:20,888
And while he was gone,
i took a bowl

358
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,258
That was filled with
delicious plum pudding

359
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,425
And placed into it

360
00:20:25,427 --> 00:20:31,363
Not one, but 2 large
pieces of sheep shit.

361
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:32,797
Ha ha ha!

362
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,165
[men laughing]

363
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,867
When he--when he returned,

364
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,169
I encouraged him to taste
the plum pudding,

365
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,138
And as sure as i'm
standing before you today,

366
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,007
He did! He ate it all!

367
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:46,641
Shit pudding!

368
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:49,577
He ate shit pudding!

[laughing]

370
00:20:58,987 --> 00:21:02,754
You got your brother
to eat sheep dung.

371
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:04,355
Yes.

372
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:06,957
Yes, that's a very
amusing story.

373
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,909
Ha.

374
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,860
[snickering]
tell him...

375
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:12,261
Tell him the ending.

376
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:15,264
That's the best part.

377
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:16,698
Oh, yeah!

378
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,167
And to be completely
honest, sir,

379
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:20,968
I have no brother.

380
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,803
It was me!

381
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:24,538
I ate sheep shit!

382
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,274
I swear! I did!

383
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:36,281
Yes...Yes, clever twist
on the end there.

384
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:39,883
Well, i think we've become
well enough acquainted

385
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:42,418
For one evening.

386
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,286
Fun, fun.

387
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,189
He ain't got
a brother!

When i said your music would
be a welcome companion--

392
00:22:02,502 --> 00:22:06,403
Don't you know
any other goddamn tune?!

393
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:07,737
Huh?!

394
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:09,004
No, sir.

395
00:22:09,006 --> 00:22:10,538
Of course
you do, lad.

396
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,673
Play 'em that
haunting air

this morning.

Indians.

403
00:22:48,204 --> 00:22:49,770
These are the iowas.

404
00:22:49,772 --> 00:22:53,639
Fontenot, please greet this man
in his native tongue.

405

Ha ha ha!

This is not
one of them.

410
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,486
Hmm.

411
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:12,020
Bad luck.

412
00:23:12,022 --> 00:23:16,390
They do trade with whites.
He probably speaks english.

413
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:18,258
Ah.

414
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,393
Good day.

I bring you wishes for peace
from thomas jefferson,

of the whites.

yourself.

you speak english.

Is this so?

is bent twig.

Looks like they're
going to let us live.

Let us live?

449
00:25:29,214 --> 00:25:30,597
I had to give them a few
of your finer things

450
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,599
So they wouldn't
kill us.

Then they're scooping your
brains out with a spoon.

You mean a fork.

wouldn't have killed us.

I know that.

I'm just not carrying that junk
with us the whole trip.

bit my ear off!

and i said it again,

at her will die.

492
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:39,297
And his dubious experiment
with bidwell's ear.

493
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,101
I shall name this flower
"amanda's bloom."

494
00:27:43,103 --> 00:27:44,535
Mr. Hunt, as my partner,

495
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:47,970
You should be naming some
of our discoveries as well.

496
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:49,471
Uh...

497
00:27:49,473 --> 00:27:50,872
Me?

498
00:27:50,874 --> 00:27:52,273
Yes.

499
00:27:52,275 --> 00:27:56,210
You could name that fork
in the river, for instance.

500
00:27:56,212 --> 00:27:59,979
Perhaps there's a loved one
you'd care to immortalize.

501
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:02,348
Loved one.

502
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,484
Yeah, sure.

503
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:08,153
Ha. I know.

504
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:11,388
I name this here fork...

505
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,790
"pittsburgh nellie."

506
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:14,991
A welsh whore

507
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,360
Who could do things
with her one good arm

508
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,863
That'd make you forget
that thing on her neck.

509
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,398
[wheezing laughter]

510
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:30,603
Edwards: By permitting mr. Hunt
to name some of our discoveries,

511
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:33,105
I have unleashed
his imagination.

512
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:35,574
He now insists
that i teach him to read.

513
00:28:35,576 --> 00:28:39,811
His enthusiasm reminds me
of the schoolboy i once was.

514
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:41,179
Are you ready?

515
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:42,079
Yes.

516
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:43,513
Excellent.

517
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:44,714
This...

518
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:47,550
Is the uppercase...

519
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:49,018
"a."

520
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,020
You know, i spent a day
in school once,

521
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:52,421
But the schoolmarm
claimed

522
00:28:52,423 --> 00:28:53,922
That i just couldn't
concentrate.

523
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:56,691
Let's prove her wrong,
shall we?

524
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,995
You know, i've waited years
to hear somebody say that.

525
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:03,963
Again.

526
00:29:04,432 --> 00:29:05,631
Hunt.

527
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:09,134
This is the uppercase...

528
00:29:09,136 --> 00:29:10,301
"a."

529
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:11,902
Ahh.

530
00:29:11,904 --> 00:29:15,805
The uppercase "a."

531
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:18,374
Heh. Got that.

532
00:29:18,376 --> 00:29:19,775
All right.

533
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:21,610
Ahh.

534
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,011
Whoa.

535
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:30,315
And this
is the lowercase...

536
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:32,916
"a."

537
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:36,185
The...

538
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:38,387
L-lower...

539
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:39,955
Case...

540
00:29:39,957 --> 00:29:43,091
"a."

541
00:29:46,196 --> 00:29:48,295
Ohh, god.

542
00:29:49,464 --> 00:29:51,263
Ohh.

543
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:53,932
Ohh...

544
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:56,167
God.

545
00:29:56,702 --> 00:29:58,968
Oh, god.

546
00:29:58,970 --> 00:29:59,969
Ok.

547
00:29:59,971 --> 00:30:01,003
Yep.

548
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:03,138
And this is the--

549
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,373
Enough!

550
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:09,409
Do you want my head
to explode?!

551
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:13,846
In the name of all
that is good and decent,

552
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:17,282
No more for today!

553
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,153
In exchange
for reading lessons,

554
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,287
Mr. Hunt reciprocates

555
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:28,857
By teaching me
some of his frontier skills.

556
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:30,692
[sniffs]

557
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:32,560
The buffalo
is near now.

558
00:30:32,562 --> 00:30:36,697
Ah, you can tell that just
by sniffing its droppings.

559
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:38,449
No.

560
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,200
I can see the herd
right over there.

561
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:42,035
Hmm.

562
00:30:42,037 --> 00:30:43,036
[sniffs]

563
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:45,438
Well, then
why are you...

564
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,373
Mmm.

565
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:08,425
No, i shouldn't, uh...

566
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,927
I couldn't possibly...

567
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:17,365
Edwards: Ohh.

568
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:19,700
Oh, ohh.

569
00:31:19,702 --> 00:31:20,967
Edwards!

570
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:22,635
Ha ha ha ha!

571
00:31:22,637 --> 00:31:25,838
You're not doing any naming
up here without me,

572
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,806
Huh, partner? Ha ha!

573
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:28,973
Uh, no, no.

574
00:31:28,975 --> 00:31:31,342
Hey, uh,
what you looking at?

575
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:32,176
The moon.

576
00:31:32,178 --> 00:31:33,710
I was looking
at the moon.

577
00:31:33,712 --> 00:31:38,280
For me, the moon brings
to mind "romance."

578
00:31:38,282 --> 00:31:39,414
Yeah.

579
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:41,883
Have you ever been
in love, mr. Hunt?

580
00:31:41,885 --> 00:31:44,402
Uh...

581
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,920
I've had my head
under a petticoat or 2.

582
00:31:47,857 --> 00:31:49,089
Good lord.

583
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:50,423
Must you and the others

584
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:53,692
Reduce everything
to its crudest terms?

585
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:55,911
Well...

586
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:58,129
I thought i cleaned it up
rather nicely for you.

587
00:31:58,131 --> 00:31:59,029
Mr. Hunt,

588
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:02,732
Behold the object
of my desire.

589
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:04,200
Behold an angel

590
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:07,603
Sent down
from on high.

591
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:12,841
Angel from on high.

592
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:16,844
Huh?

593
00:32:19,715 --> 00:32:22,215
Oh, my god.

594
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:23,349
From here on out

595
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:25,884
You keep your distance,
all right?

596
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:26,918
What?

597
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,419
No.

598
00:32:28,788 --> 00:32:29,753
No, no, no!

599
00:32:29,755 --> 00:32:34,023
Get out of the way,
you big french oaf!

Now you see?

602
00:32:42,331 --> 00:32:43,997
Hunt:
Ohh, yeah.

603
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:45,365
Now i see.

604
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:47,266
Whoa.

605
00:32:47,268 --> 00:32:47,966
All right,

606
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,600
That's enough,
mr. Hunt.

607
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:51,868
Ohhhhhh!

608
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,036
I said all right!

609
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,937
Mr. Hunt,
that will be enough!

610
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,973
Ohh, i understand.

611
00:32:57,975 --> 00:33:01,809
You wanna watch her
by yourself.

612
00:33:01,811 --> 00:33:04,478
Ha ha ha ha ha!

613
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,745
You wanna be alone

614
00:33:05,747 --> 00:33:09,314
So you can shake hands
with ben franklin, huh?

615

[wheezing laughter]

00:33:11,618 --> 00:33:12,783
You know,

617
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:14,918
Polish the pewter.

618
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,185
Polish the pewter?

619
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:18,587
Why, jonah does that
for me.

620
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:20,455
Yeah, right.

621
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:21,489
What?

622
00:33:21,491 --> 00:33:23,408
No!

623
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:25,326
Mr. Hunt, i assure you,
i've never...

624
00:33:25,428 --> 00:33:26,960
Edwards: 10 july.

625
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:28,795
Have driven the men hard,

626
00:33:28,797 --> 00:33:30,213
And i'm positive

627
00:33:30,214 --> 00:33:31,630
We've closed the gap
on lewis and clark.

628
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:33,432
However,
because of the currents,

629
00:33:33,434 --> 00:33:35,400
I surmised
that we'd be better off

630
00:33:35,402 --> 00:33:38,603
Portaging for the next
several miles.

631

Yaaah!

632
00:33:39,305 --> 00:33:40,337
Edwards: It's hard work,

633
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:42,839
But it's nothing compared
to the deadly currents

634
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:45,374
We'd be battling
on the mighty missouri.

635
00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:46,341
Hunt: Pull!

636
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:47,942
Here we go!

637
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:49,944
Heave!

638
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:51,645

don't move.

If he sees you,

You're dead.

Wait.

Hunt: I think it's leavin'.

657
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,745
I'm gonna scratch it.

658

You scratch your nose,
you're dead.

00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:26,885
No! Don't!

[screaming]

665
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:35,990
The bear is worse!

666
00:35:35,992 --> 00:35:39,259
The bear
is definitely worse!

667
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:41,194

00:35:41,196 --> 00:35:42,995
[reciting latin]

669
00:35:42,997 --> 00:35:46,430
That poor, poor man.

00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:50,766
Bidwell.

672
00:35:50,768 --> 00:35:52,234
Can you hear me?

673
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,869
Bidwell,
can you hear me?

674
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:56,888
Can you--

675
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:58,906
I fear the bear has killed
mr. Bidwell, sir.

676
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,208
He's failed
to communicate with me

677
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,509
By way of his ear.

678
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:04,377
It doesn't work
that way.

679
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:06,679
It doesn't work
any way.

680
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:07,980
But even if it did,

681
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:09,881
He couldn't talk
through it.

682
00:36:09,883 --> 00:36:11,949
Bidwell?

683
00:36:12,985 --> 00:36:15,118
Never mind.

684
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,419
Bidwell: Help me!

685
00:36:17,421 --> 00:36:19,253
Ha ha!

686
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,521
Bidwell!

687
00:36:22,523 --> 00:36:24,940
Sir.

688
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:27,358
Sir, i've been
to hell and back.

689
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,626
Yes, i can see that.

690
00:36:29,628 --> 00:36:30,760
I suspect that now

691
00:36:30,762 --> 00:36:32,995
You'll want to lead
a hunting party

692
00:36:32,997 --> 00:36:35,030
To slay
that terrible beast!

693
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:38,833
Well, yes, that thought
did cross my mind...

694
00:36:38,835 --> 00:36:40,184
Briefly...

695
00:36:40,185 --> 00:36:41,534
But now i have
a better idea.

696
00:36:41,537 --> 00:36:42,969
Yes, sir?

697
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:44,637
I shall fashion for you

698
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:47,539
The finest wooden leg
you've ever seen.

699
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:48,606
Ohh.

700
00:36:48,608 --> 00:36:50,841
But what about the bear?

701
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:51,975
Rest assured, bidwell,

702
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:54,277
In 20 years or so,
the ravages of old age

703
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,612
Will deal with the bear
far more cruelly

704
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,281
Than we ever could have.

705
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:03,184
Revenge is sweet, sir.

706
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:08,255
Edwards: 29 july.

707
00:37:08,257 --> 00:37:09,990
We reached
the final settlement

708
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:12,258
Before entering
uncharted territory

709
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,761
And god only knows what.

710
00:37:21,968 --> 00:37:25,568
Edwards: Well, it seems
as if we've arrived--

711
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,435
Wait!

712
00:37:26,437 --> 00:37:27,536
I can read it.

713
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:30,605
I can read it.
Ha ha ha.

714

For the love of god,
man!

720
00:37:48,454 --> 00:37:53,222
It says "welcome
to snakes bend"!

721
00:37:53,224 --> 00:37:56,024
Ohh! God, yeah.

722
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:58,425
Onward, men!

723
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,259
Snakes bend.

724
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:02,861
Almost had it.

725
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:09,566

i got it.

00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:17,571
Yes, it's a tavern.

731
00:38:17,573 --> 00:38:18,889
Whew.

732
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,206
I think it would be
a nice gesture

733
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,875
If i bought the men
a few tankards of ale.

734
00:38:22,877 --> 00:38:23,709
Oh-ho-ho,

735
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:25,944
A nice gesture
indeed.

736
00:38:25,946 --> 00:38:27,829
Ha ha ha!

737
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,713
We both know how you get
when you drink.

738
00:38:29,716 --> 00:38:32,349
Oh, yes, we do.

739
00:38:32,884 --> 00:38:34,100
Hey.

740
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:35,317
And that's why
i think you should go

741
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:38,219
To the trading post
for supplies now.

742
00:38:38,221 --> 00:38:40,187
Yeah.

743
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,824
All right, men.
Fun, fun.

744
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:47,493
[laughter]

745
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:58,269
To captain edwards.

746
00:38:58,271 --> 00:38:59,270
Captain edwards!

747
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:01,572
Captain edwards!

748
00:39:02,308 --> 00:39:04,508
Excuse me.

749
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,709
I had heard there was a party
of brave men here.

750
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,344
I'm here to tell you

751
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,914
That i am not unfamiliar
with the ways of men

752
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:13,583
Who have been long
in the wilderness.

753
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:16,686
I understand their cravings
for food and drink

754
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,887
And also their cravings

755
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,723
For the companionship
of young women.

756
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:21,557
Women!

757
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,691
He's got women!

758
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,625
Where are they?

759
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,293
Wait for me outside.

760
00:39:25,295 --> 00:39:27,228
I will take you to them.

761
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,229
Mmm-mmm.

762
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:29,096
Come on!

763
00:39:29,098 --> 00:39:30,697
Take me to 'em.

764
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:32,031
Gentlemen?

765
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:34,250
Ahh.

766
00:39:34,251 --> 00:39:36,468
My woman pleasure me
whenever i want.

767
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,370
Yes, i shall refrain
as well.

768
00:39:39,372 --> 00:39:41,505
I've made a solemn
promise to someone.

769
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:42,539
Man: Really?

770
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:44,607
Yes, i promised
my doctor

771
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:48,844
I wouldn't engage
in that sort of thing.

772
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:51,312
Got a drippy dong, eh?

773
00:39:51,314 --> 00:39:52,680
No.

774
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,081
No more than normal.

775
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:55,449
It drips when it should,

776
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:58,218
And it doesn't
when it shouldn't.

777
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:03,789
Will that be it?

778
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:05,791
Let's see, uh...

779
00:40:05,793 --> 00:40:06,958
Beans.

780
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,309
Rope.

781
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,659
Uh, is there
a barber in town?

782
00:40:09,662 --> 00:40:11,378
I'm a barber, sir.

783
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:13,095
Oh, fine. I'll have
a haircut and a shave.

784
00:40:13,098 --> 00:40:14,230
By the way, uh,

785
00:40:14,232 --> 00:40:15,431
You smell
like something

786
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:17,299
That's been passed
through the system

787
00:40:17,301 --> 00:40:19,000
Of a sick old woman.

788
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:20,101
Well...

789
00:40:20,103 --> 00:40:23,470
Maybe i'll have a bath,
too, then.

790
00:40:23,472 --> 00:40:26,005
Good idea.

791
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:28,473
This way, gentlemen.

792
00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:30,441
Don't be shy.

793
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:34,478
Come in
and meet the ladies.

794
00:40:37,716 --> 00:40:42,484
Man: Did i not tell you
they were beautiful?

795
00:40:43,753 --> 00:40:45,619
Don't you have
any real women?

796
00:40:45,621 --> 00:40:48,088
These women may be whores,

797
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,190
But they have their dignity.

798
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:53,393
Now, who would like
to be the first

799
00:40:53,395 --> 00:40:57,764
To introduce himself, hmm?

800
00:41:01,268 --> 00:41:03,001
Hello, my dear.

801
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:05,703
My name
is hieronymus pratt.

802
00:41:05,705 --> 00:41:10,641
Might you have relatives
in richmond, virginia?

803
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,477
[buzzing]

804
00:41:22,586 --> 00:41:24,552
Some of them,
uh, flies

805
00:41:24,554 --> 00:41:27,488
Were there
before i got in.

806
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:34,393
I just saw hidalgo.

807
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:35,227
Hidalgo!

808
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:36,294
With all his men?

809
00:41:36,296 --> 00:41:37,662
No. Just half a dozen,

810
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:40,798
But they're headed
this way!

811
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:45,134
Double my wages for anyone
who'll take my shift.

812
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:51,006
I have heard
of this hidalgo.

813
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,109
A spaniard who wanders
the northwest.

814
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,178
Even crazy people
think he's--

815
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,879
Whoo-hoo.

816
00:42:11,593 --> 00:42:13,358
[whimpers]

817
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:18,596
Did you say something?

818
00:42:18,598 --> 00:42:20,164
I, uh...No.

819
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:22,283
No, i...

820
00:42:22,284 --> 00:42:24,401
You said something
about my hair.

821
00:42:24,403 --> 00:42:25,635
No.

822
00:42:25,637 --> 00:42:27,236
Why not?

823
00:42:27,238 --> 00:42:29,371
You don't like my hair?

824
00:42:29,373 --> 00:42:32,006
Yes. It's nice.

825
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,008
Nice?

826
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,409
My hair is magnificent.

827
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:38,444
It's long and soft

828
00:42:38,446 --> 00:42:41,013
And shines with a light
that comes from within.

829
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:42,014
Can't you see it?

830
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:43,582
Yes. It's beautiful.

831
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:44,616
Beautiful, yes.

832
00:42:44,618 --> 00:42:47,018
That's all
i have to say.

833
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,320
I'm sorry
if i frightened you.

834
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,857
Good god.

835
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:56,391
Good.

836
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:58,259
You do good work.

837
00:42:58,261 --> 00:42:59,994
Thank you, sir.

838
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:01,728
I strive for excellence
in all my various trades.

839
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:03,397
Tell me,
among those trades

840
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:05,732
You wouldn't happen
to practice...

841
00:43:05,734 --> 00:43:07,200
Taxidermy?

842
00:43:07,202 --> 00:43:08,167
No.

843
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,235
I was going to say
dentistry.

844
00:43:10,237 --> 00:43:12,370
Oh. Well, i'm primarily
a taxidermist.

845
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:14,472
However, i have
practiced dentistry

846
00:43:14,474 --> 00:43:17,141
On the animals
i've preserved.

847
00:43:19,979 --> 00:43:22,579
And, of course,
over there.

848
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:23,646
Ohh.

849
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:24,813
Good, good,

850
00:43:24,815 --> 00:43:27,015
'cause i have got a molar

851
00:43:27,017 --> 00:43:29,951
That's been bothering me
since st. Louis.

852
00:43:29,953 --> 00:43:32,620
Oh. I can oblige, sir.

853
00:43:32,622 --> 00:43:33,721
He said, "i know.

854
00:43:33,723 --> 00:43:36,323
It wasn't a horse.
It was a donkey."

Her hair is perfect.

857
00:43:52,772 --> 00:43:55,606
So beautiful.

858
00:43:55,908 --> 00:43:57,474
Is this your woman?

859
00:43:57,476 --> 00:43:59,642
She belong to me.

860
00:43:59,644 --> 00:44:00,976
Well, who are you?

861
00:44:00,978 --> 00:44:02,777
Guy fontenot.

862
00:44:02,779 --> 00:44:06,447
Well, you may call me
hidalgo.

863
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:08,549
Hidalgo.

864
00:44:08,551 --> 00:44:10,551
I wander
the northwest territory

865
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:13,220
Searching
for a fabulous place.

866
00:44:13,222 --> 00:44:16,890
A place where the earth
trembles and speaks

867
00:44:16,892 --> 00:44:17,957
And a white cross

868
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:20,759
Marks the location
of an age-old secret.

869
00:44:20,761 --> 00:44:23,194
And what is
the secret?

870
00:44:23,196 --> 00:44:24,828
Ahh.
You try to trick me

871
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,996
With your deceiving
questions, huh?

872
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,464
[spaniards laughing]

873
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:30,165
But you will learn
nothing.

874
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,301
Not unless you join us.

875
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:34,235
Come on.

876
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:35,869
You're perfect.

877
00:44:35,871 --> 00:44:37,303
If you join us,

878
00:44:37,305 --> 00:44:40,205
Everything
that belongs to you,

879
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:42,807
Belongs to me, too.

880
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:44,759
And if i don't?

881
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,710
Then we tear out your heart,
cut off your limbs,

882
00:44:46,712 --> 00:44:48,845
And skin you alive.

883
00:44:48,847 --> 00:44:50,379
I'll join.

884
00:44:50,381 --> 00:44:52,981
Good. I'm delighted.

885
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:53,915
Ha ha!

886
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:55,450
Ha ha ha!

887
00:44:55,451 --> 00:44:56,984
Now this should
dull your senses.

888
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:57,751
All right.

889
00:44:57,753 --> 00:44:59,319
Ow!
What are you doing?!

890
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,788
What, are you trying
to kill me? Ow!

891
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:03,857
Put it down!

892
00:45:03,858 --> 00:45:05,925
Put the thing down
and pull my tooth!

893

God almighty!

894
00:45:07,728 --> 00:45:09,427
Ohh.

895
00:45:10,296 --> 00:45:11,728
All right.

896
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,896
Say, "ahh."

Ahh...

898
00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:16,064
It's in the back.

00:45:16,066 --> 00:45:17,031
All right.

900
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:18,198
Ok. Ok. Aah!

901
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:18,898
Ohh!

902
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,833
That guy is in there.

Don't take her!

906
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,752
Take me instead.

907
00:45:43,922 --> 00:45:45,588
Hmm.

908
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:52,360
Put your hands
on your hips.

909
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:56,296
No, no, no, no.
Like this.

910
00:46:00,435 --> 00:46:02,134
Hmm.

Huh? Look at that.

914
00:46:16,347 --> 00:46:19,448
And here i've avoided
the dentist for years

915
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,817
Because i thought
it'd hurt.

916
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:22,751
Oh-ho, no.

917
00:46:22,753 --> 00:46:23,818
Look at that.

918
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,187
No, i think i'll still
keep the woman.

919

Come on. Let's go.

920
00:46:27,256 --> 00:46:30,890
You can't take a woman
against her will.

921
00:46:32,827 --> 00:46:34,827
Of course,
maybe it's time

922
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:38,263
For her to spread
her wings and fly.

923
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:43,367
Hunt: Well, well.

924

And your ladies in armor

We are more than equal
to a duel, señor,

since you won't live

do you choose?

Pistols, swords,
or...

I'm deeply impressed
and grateful.

Maybe now
you'll agree...

Drinking
has its benefits.

00:51:19,823 --> 00:51:21,622
Not at all.

1001
00:51:21,624 --> 00:51:23,624
Look at you.

1002
00:51:24,493 --> 00:51:27,327
Thin wrists.

1003
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:30,363
Skin like a baby.

1004
00:51:30,365 --> 00:51:33,566
Almost a total absence
of shoulders.

1005
00:51:33,568 --> 00:51:35,635
All right.

1006
00:51:35,636 --> 00:51:37,703
I think you've flattered me
quite enough.

1007
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,148
Look at me.

1008
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,815
I'm behaving like
some kind of animal.

1009
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,783
I liked it.

1010
00:51:56,987 --> 00:51:58,386
No, no, no!

1011
00:51:58,388 --> 00:51:59,687
This can never be.

1012
00:51:59,689 --> 00:52:01,321
I'm betrothed
to another.

1013
00:52:01,323 --> 00:52:04,157
Besides, we come
from different worlds.

1014
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:05,024
You are primitive,

1015
00:52:05,026 --> 00:52:07,259
And you follow
your baser instincts.

1016
00:52:07,261 --> 00:52:11,129
I come from a culture that
values christian morality.

1017
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:13,431
Maybe one more
couldn't hurt.

1018
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:16,000
What? What?
What did i say?

1019
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:17,334
Shaquinna.

1020
00:52:17,336 --> 00:52:18,301
Shaquinna!

1021

Higgins: I don't see
how it's possible

1022
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:24,673
For the river to flow up
and over those mountains

1023
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:26,274
To the western sea.

1024
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:30,177
The river can't
flow up and over

1025
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:32,245
Anything.

1026
00:52:32,247 --> 00:52:35,581
So, i guess
our journey's over.

1027
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:36,982
Well...

1028
00:52:36,984 --> 00:52:38,717
No, no! Never!

1029
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:40,185
We're pushing on.

1030
00:52:40,187 --> 00:52:42,120
We'll scale
the rocky mountains

1031
00:52:42,122 --> 00:52:43,020
Within the month

1032
00:52:43,022 --> 00:52:45,255
And then build canoes

1033
00:52:45,257 --> 00:52:48,091
And float down
the western slope

1034
00:52:48,093 --> 00:52:51,093
Before the first frost.

1035
00:52:51,962 --> 00:52:53,328
Edwards: 29 october.

1036
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:55,930
What i had hoped
was an early dusting

1037
00:52:55,932 --> 00:52:58,432
Turned out
to be somewhat more.

1038
00:52:58,434 --> 00:53:00,267
Our journey
is half finished,

1039
00:53:00,269 --> 00:53:03,136
But our food supply
is nearly depleted.

The only man who seems
to be thriving is pratt,

1042
00:53:06,508 --> 00:53:10,342
Who is eating what remains
of his straw woman.

1043
00:53:10,344 --> 00:53:11,927
As for me,

1044
00:53:11,928 --> 00:53:13,511
I seem to have come down
with a slight chill.

What do you think
you're doing?

1048
00:53:20,184 --> 00:53:22,017
The last rites.

1049
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:24,252
No, no. There'll be
none of that.

1050
00:53:24,254 --> 00:53:28,189
Please do not try to bury me
before i'm dead.

1051
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,757
Go away.

I can make medicine

1054
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,903
But i will need
the egg of an eagle,

1055
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:46,271
Or he will die.

1056
00:53:46,273 --> 00:53:47,905
The egg...

1057
00:53:47,907 --> 00:53:49,039
Of an eagle?

1058
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:50,040
That's all?

Were way down below
the snow line.

You're a very brave man
to do this for your friend.

President jefferson,
i implore you.

1098
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:14,308
If we do not give bears
the right to vote,

1099
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:16,043
They will rise up,

1100

And bears will be
in congress,

Well, just the same--

1168
01:01:15,668 --> 01:01:17,968
I'm serious.

1169
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:19,469
Oh.

1170
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,818
Good god.

1171
01:01:40,289 --> 01:01:43,423
Edwards:
What rare luck is this?

1172
01:01:43,425 --> 01:01:44,357
Hunt: What?

1173
01:01:44,359 --> 01:01:45,324
Lewis and clark,

1174
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:49,027
And, the damn fools,
they're portaging.

1175
01:01:51,564 --> 01:01:53,096
Huh.

1176
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:55,964
They're portaging
because they think

1177
01:01:55,966 --> 01:01:58,933
The river is
too dangerous up ahead.

1178
01:01:58,935 --> 01:02:00,801
I think we should
do the same.

1179
01:02:00,803 --> 01:02:03,637
I see no reason
for concern.

1180
01:02:03,639 --> 01:02:04,504
Sir?

1181
01:02:04,506 --> 01:02:05,972
An old saying--

1182
01:02:05,974 --> 01:02:08,941
"white water
in the morning."

1183
01:02:08,943 --> 01:02:10,142
Yes?

1184
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:12,277
That's it.

1185
01:02:12,279 --> 01:02:14,079
Mr. Hunt,

1186
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,880
This is our chance
to overtake lewis and clark.

1187
01:02:15,882 --> 01:02:16,914
Sure, we may
overtake 'em,

1188
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:20,117
But it ain't worth risking
the lives of the men.

1189
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:23,553
I assure you
all will be fine.

1190
01:02:23,555 --> 01:02:27,088
I hope to god
you're right.

1191
01:02:27,523 --> 01:02:30,156
[men on shore
shouting and laughing]

1192
01:02:50,278 --> 01:02:51,977
Don't worry, men.

1193
01:02:51,979 --> 01:02:54,496
According
to my calculations,

1194
01:02:54,497 --> 01:02:57,014
We have less than 100
yards of rapids ahead.

1195
01:02:57,016 --> 01:02:58,382
Oh!

1196
01:02:58,384 --> 01:03:01,017
[screaming]

1197
01:03:04,855 --> 01:03:06,721
Aah!

1198
01:03:06,723 --> 01:03:09,356
[screaming]

1199
01:03:13,962 --> 01:03:15,928
Aah!

1200
01:03:17,932 --> 01:03:19,765
Ooh! Ooh!

1201
01:03:21,068 --> 01:03:22,867
Yeah!

1202
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:23,801
Ha ha!

1203
01:03:23,803 --> 01:03:26,436
[screaming]

1204
01:03:33,411 --> 01:03:35,110
Aah!

1205
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:35,977
Aah!

1206
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:38,879
[screaming]

1207
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:48,054
Aah!

1208
01:03:48,056 --> 01:03:55,227
Aah!

1209
01:04:06,206 --> 01:04:08,339
My hat's off to you, sir.

1210
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:10,641
We made it!

1211
01:04:10,643 --> 01:04:12,376
Uhh!

1212
01:04:12,377 --> 01:04:14,110
Men, we have overtaken
lewis and clark.

1213
01:04:14,113 --> 01:04:15,912
Gather up the pieces
of the boat

1214
01:04:15,914 --> 01:04:18,281
And what's left
of our supplies.

1215
01:04:18,283 --> 01:04:19,949
No!

1216
01:04:20,584 --> 01:04:22,317
I beg your pardon?

1217
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:23,751
You almost got us killed

1218
01:04:23,753 --> 01:04:25,252
Just so you could be
famous.

1219
01:04:25,254 --> 01:04:26,820
Well, i ain't
taking no more.

1220
01:04:26,822 --> 01:04:28,488
I'm quitting
this expedition.

1221
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,490
What of
our partnership?

1222
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:31,591
Partnership?

1223
01:04:31,593 --> 01:04:34,093
You didn't care nothing
about our partnership

1224
01:04:34,095 --> 01:04:35,027
Back there on the river.

1225
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:37,729
Well, i don't care
nothing about it now.

1226
01:04:37,731 --> 01:04:39,363
Who's coming with me?

1227
01:04:39,365 --> 01:04:41,565
To hell with
both of you.

1228
01:04:41,567 --> 01:04:43,133
I've spent
my entire life

1229
01:04:43,135 --> 01:04:45,235
Trying to see the pacific,

1230
01:04:45,237 --> 01:04:46,803
And i'm going by myself.

1231
01:04:46,805 --> 01:04:49,172
Who's going with me?

1232
01:04:49,173 --> 01:04:51,540
Jonah, where do
your loyalties lie?

1233
01:04:51,542 --> 01:04:52,607
I'm your slave.

1234
01:04:52,609 --> 01:04:54,241
Who do you think
i'm with?

1235
01:04:54,243 --> 01:04:55,141
Thank you, jonah.

1236
01:04:55,143 --> 01:04:57,843
I'm going with mr. Hunt.

1237
01:04:57,845 --> 01:04:59,244
We're close!

1238
01:04:59,246 --> 01:05:01,679
Only a few hundred miles!

1239
01:05:01,681 --> 01:05:03,080
We will be the first!

1240
01:05:03,082 --> 01:05:05,048
Trust me,
the worst is over.

1241
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:06,916
The worst
will never be over--

1242
01:05:06,918 --> 01:05:10,286
Not with this
precious dandy in charge.

1243
01:05:10,288 --> 01:05:13,022
If you want to live,
come with me.

1244
01:05:13,624 --> 01:05:15,557
Use your minds, men.

1245
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:17,158
Think for yourselves.

1246
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,893
Or would you rather have
mr. Hunt

1247
01:05:18,895 --> 01:05:20,261
Do your thinking for you?

1248
01:05:20,263 --> 01:05:24,430
My heavenly father
does my thinking for me,

1249
01:05:24,432 --> 01:05:26,565
And he thinks i'd be
a damn fool

1250
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:27,999
Not to go with hunt.

1251
01:05:28,001 --> 01:05:29,433
No, no.

1252
01:05:29,435 --> 01:05:32,135
Father.
Father, wait.

1253
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:37,506
It is better to think
for yourself,

1254
01:05:37,508 --> 01:05:41,976
And i think we should
continue to the pacific.

1255
01:05:41,978 --> 01:05:43,877
Stout fellow, bidwell.

1256
01:05:43,879 --> 01:05:45,912
How can you
say that, man?

1257
01:05:45,914 --> 01:05:48,314
You've had it worse
than all of us--

1258
01:05:48,316 --> 01:05:49,982
Been mauled by a bear,

1259
01:05:49,984 --> 01:05:52,484
Your ear bit off
by a frenchman.

1260
01:05:52,486 --> 01:05:53,384
True enough, sir.

1261
01:05:53,386 --> 01:05:55,519
I have had my share
of bad luck,

1262
01:05:55,521 --> 01:05:57,988
But i cannot abandon
mr. Edwards now,

1263
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:00,757
For he alone
has dared to dream.

1264
01:06:00,759 --> 01:06:04,260
And now we are
so very close

1265
01:06:04,262 --> 01:06:06,862
That i believe him
when he says

1266
01:06:06,864 --> 01:06:08,063
The worst is over.

1267
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:09,898
[gunshot]

1268
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:13,567
When i said
the worst was over,

1269
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,535
Perhaps i spoke
too soon,

1270
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:16,502
But now surely--

1271
01:06:16,504 --> 01:06:18,871
[gunshot]
ow!

1272
01:06:18,873 --> 01:06:20,572
Bidwell!

1273
01:06:20,574 --> 01:06:22,741
Get down!

1274
01:06:22,742 --> 01:06:24,909
Hidalgo: I'm sorry.
I was aiming for your head.

1275
01:06:24,911 --> 01:06:26,327
You wait there.

1276
01:06:26,328 --> 01:06:27,744
We'll be down in a moment
to capture you.

1277
01:06:27,747 --> 01:06:28,712
Ha ha ha!

1278
01:06:28,714 --> 01:06:30,513
[men laugh]

1279
01:06:30,515 --> 01:06:33,349
Hidalgo: I want them
in their underthings

1280
01:06:33,351 --> 01:06:34,650
When they die.

1281
01:06:34,652 --> 01:06:36,652
That makes it
much worse,

1282
01:06:36,654 --> 01:06:37,653
Don't you think?

1283
01:06:37,655 --> 01:06:39,721
Heh heh heh heh.

1284
01:06:39,723 --> 01:06:41,689
Prepare the gauntlet.

1285
01:06:41,691 --> 01:06:43,390
What?

1286
01:06:43,392 --> 01:06:44,491
The gauntlet.

1287
01:06:44,492 --> 01:06:45,591
I've decided
these 2 men will die

1288
01:06:45,594 --> 01:06:47,961
Running the gauntlet.

1289
01:06:48,496 --> 01:06:49,812
The...

1290
01:06:49,813 --> 01:06:51,129
The gauntlet!
The gauntlet!

1291
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:53,064
All right.
Calm yourself.

1292
01:06:53,066 --> 01:06:56,233
You don't think i know
where there's a gumbit?

1293
01:06:56,235 --> 01:06:57,000
Gumblit?

1294
01:06:57,002 --> 01:06:58,201
Sanchez!
Gauntlet.

1295
01:06:58,203 --> 01:07:02,237
You and the frenchman
prepare the gauntlet.

1296
01:07:02,706 --> 01:07:05,406
I'm sorry we must
cut short our fun,

1297
01:07:05,408 --> 01:07:06,924
My little kitten.

1298
01:07:06,925 --> 01:07:08,441
If you so much as
lay a hand on me,

1299
01:07:08,444 --> 01:07:09,810
I will kill you!

1300
01:07:09,812 --> 01:07:10,710
Ooh.

1301
01:07:10,712 --> 01:07:12,144
Take her away.

Punch him!

it's all about, huh?

Whose idea
was the corn?

1318
01:08:13,891 --> 01:08:15,857
They're getting away!

1319
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:17,391
Hector, follow them!

1320
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:18,358
After them!

01:09:05,898 --> 01:09:07,230
You can do it!

1334
01:09:07,232 --> 01:09:08,231
Save yourself.

1335
01:09:08,233 --> 01:09:12,301
I'll never forget this,
bartholomew.

1336
01:09:15,272 --> 01:09:17,338
And now
we kill you, señor,

1337
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:19,039
And take your head
back to hidalgo,

1338
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:21,541
But we do have one tiny
favor to ask of you.

1339
01:09:21,543 --> 01:09:24,143
Yes. You see, so often
when we bring a head

1340
01:09:24,145 --> 01:09:25,611
Back to hidalgo,

1341
01:09:25,612 --> 01:09:27,078
It has a grimace
or a look of terror.

1342
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:29,247
It would really put us
in good with hidalgo

1343
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:32,782
If you could smile
as we kill you.

1344
01:09:32,784 --> 01:09:34,817
Go to hell.

1345
01:09:34,819 --> 01:09:36,885
Oh.

1346
01:09:38,021 --> 01:09:39,086
No, no.

1347
01:09:39,088 --> 01:09:40,587
Did you see how ugly
your face was

1348
01:09:40,589 --> 01:09:41,821
When you said that?

1349
01:09:41,823 --> 01:09:43,289

Yes. Say "poppy."

help but smile

the word "poppy."

What you did back there
for me was, uh...

1361
01:10:26,058 --> 01:10:27,624
That was real nice
of you.

1362

It's just that, uh...

1365

No one's ever done
nothing like that

1366
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,696
For me before.

Wait. At least let us
explain the situation.

There's no time
for that.

are being held captive

By at least
20 conquistadors.

Are there others in your

to guess why?

No.

1402

No.

Oh. I know, i know.

Because her hair's
more beautiful than yours,

And you're jealous.

No.

I am going to cut
her hair off

Because it's<i> not</i>
as beautiful as mine.

Because even if
she won't admit it,

1411

She's thinking,

"why should i even
bother to have hair

Prepare her.

you had summoned

But, uh,

We're going to probably
just, uh...

Do this alone.

At the moment of battle,

1434
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:27,598
Our spirits will soar

1435
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,367
And give us the strength

1436
01:13:31,369 --> 01:13:32,501
To fight.

we must travel.

our strength for the battle.

how these indians

Are going to help us.

1451
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:21,340
Perhaps we need not
rely on them to fight.

1452

Perhaps i can bluff hidalgo
using my wits.

much too difficult.

1498
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:52,134
You had me go--

1499
01:16:52,135 --> 01:16:54,369
And i'll put a big hole
in<i> your</i> hairy french ass.

1500
01:16:54,371 --> 01:16:56,137
Man, you--

1501
01:16:56,139 --> 01:16:57,638
Oh.

1502
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:04,944
Aah!

1503
01:17:04,946 --> 01:17:07,078
Uhh!

1504
01:17:09,882 --> 01:17:12,349
Aah!

01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:13,817

Hey, señor!

1507
01:17:15,821 --> 01:17:18,655
Look what i have!

1508
01:17:18,657 --> 01:17:20,590
Your woman!

1510
01:17:22,727 --> 01:17:24,059
I'll take care of this.

1511

No!

1512
01:17:25,295 --> 01:17:27,361
You've done enough,

1513
01:17:27,363 --> 01:17:28,862
Oh, leslie!

1514
01:17:28,864 --> 01:17:30,029
Come on!

1515
01:17:30,031 --> 01:17:33,431
It's time for me
to fight my own battles.

1516
01:17:33,433 --> 01:17:34,932
Uhh!

1517
01:17:34,934 --> 01:17:36,433
Aah!

1518
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:40,937
Hidalgo is mine.

1519
01:17:50,614 --> 01:17:52,113
Aah!

1520
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:05,625
Sir, you are a coward.

1521
01:18:05,627 --> 01:18:08,594
You seized a woman
and ran,

1522
01:18:08,596 --> 01:18:11,530
And now i'm going
to teach you a lesson.

1523
01:18:14,801 --> 01:18:15,766
Uhh!

1524
01:18:15,768 --> 01:18:17,534
Ha ha ha!

1525
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:27,643
Either you're brave,
or you're stupid.

1526
01:18:27,645 --> 01:18:31,647
Perhaps there's not much
difference between the two.

1527
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,810
You're a smart man.

1528
01:18:45,811 --> 01:18:47,661
After i kill you, i'll have
to look at your brain

1529
01:18:47,663 --> 01:18:50,363
To see if it's different
from, you know,

1530
01:18:50,365 --> 01:18:53,766
Other brains
i might have seen.

1531
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:04,342
Good god.

1532
01:19:04,344 --> 01:19:07,178
Oh!

1533
01:19:07,613 --> 01:19:09,179
Well, hello, baldy.

1534
01:19:09,181 --> 01:19:10,747
Hey, baldy, baldy,

1535
01:19:10,749 --> 01:19:12,582
Baldy, baldy, baldy!

1536
01:19:12,584 --> 01:19:14,116
Oh, my--

01:19:15,652 --> 01:19:17,151
Aah!

1539
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,259
No!

1540
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:30,896
Ooh! Uhh!

1541
01:19:31,999 --> 01:19:33,131
Huh?

1542
01:19:33,133 --> 01:19:34,298
Now...

1543
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,933
You see me as
i truly am, señor--

1544
01:19:36,935 --> 01:19:39,502
Just a bald...

1545
01:19:39,504 --> 01:19:41,437
Fat man

1546
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:42,571
Begging

1547
01:19:42,573 --> 01:19:45,040
For your mercy.

Edwards!

1549
01:19:46,143 --> 01:19:48,476
We've just seen
lewis and clark.

1550
01:19:48,478 --> 01:19:49,711
They're a mile away,

1551
01:19:49,712 --> 01:19:50,945
And they're headed
for the ocean.

1552
01:19:50,947 --> 01:19:52,746
My god.

1553
01:19:52,748 --> 01:19:54,214
Well, come on, then.

1554
01:19:54,216 --> 01:19:56,215
We can still beat them!

1555
01:19:57,785 --> 01:19:59,117
Hey, señor!

1556
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:01,552
This business
with my wig--

1557
01:20:01,554 --> 01:20:03,887
It's just between
you and me, huh?

1558
01:20:03,889 --> 01:20:05,421
Ha ha!

1559
01:20:26,042 --> 01:20:28,342
Oh, my god.

1560
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:41,319
We did it.

1561
01:20:43,389 --> 01:20:44,688
Not yet, we haven't.

1562
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:48,324
They're going to get
to the ocean before us.

1563
01:20:48,326 --> 01:20:49,291
The only way
to beat them

1564
01:20:49,293 --> 01:20:51,660
Is straight down
that rock face.

1565
01:20:51,662 --> 01:20:56,398
Well, then, as leader
of this expedition...

1566
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,867
I should be the one
that climbs down.

1567
01:20:58,869 --> 01:21:01,169
Leslie!

1568
01:21:01,171 --> 01:21:03,404
You ain't going down there.

1569
01:21:03,406 --> 01:21:06,240
You'll be killed.
I should go.

1570
01:21:06,742 --> 01:21:08,408
Nonsense.

1571
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:11,910
Then this is
for your own damn good.

1572
01:21:14,314 --> 01:21:17,815
How was that
for my own damn good?

1573
01:21:17,817 --> 01:21:19,850
Sorry. The, uh...

The punch was supposed
to knock you out.

Give me the flag.
