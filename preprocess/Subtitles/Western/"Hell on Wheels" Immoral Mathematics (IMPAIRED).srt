They'll find you.

329
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,125
Not where I'm going.

330
00:35:38,784 --> 00:35:40,160
So, it's true.

331
00:35:40,285 --> 00:35:41,828
Mm-hmm.

332
00:35:41,953 --> 00:35:43,864
All of them?

333
00:35:43,989 --> 00:35:47,145
Everyone but the woman.

334
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,869
Them injuns get her?

335
00:35:48,994 --> 00:35:51,107
I don't know.

336
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:52,706
Put the word out,

337
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:56,176
$100 reward for anyone who finds her,

338
00:35:56,301 --> 00:36:00,742
but, uh...Not a word about the maps.

339
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,574
Yeah.

340
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,981
[Horse neighs]

341
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,273
Mr. Durant?

342
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,449
Who the hell are you?

343
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:40,156
Cullen Bohannon...The man
they're looking to hang.

344
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:42,422
For killing Johnson?

345
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:45,328
I suppose you're here to
tell me you're innocent?

346
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,659
No, sir.

347
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:48,790
I'm here to ask for his job.

348
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:53,795
How do you put your trousers on, son?

349
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,421
Sir?

350
00:36:55,587 --> 00:36:58,258
Over those big balls of yours?

351
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:12,772
2 minutes.
That's all I ask.

352
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:28,872
2 minutes.

353
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,748
[Ticking]

354
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:36,713
Did you fight in the war, Mr. Durant?

355
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:40,049
I served my country in other ways.

356
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:41,680
Oh.

357
00:37:41,805 --> 00:37:44,984
Building this railroad ain't
much different than the war.

358
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:47,765
You got an army out there
and they need a leader.

359
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:51,853
I take it you fought for
the South, Mr. Bohannon.

360
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,225
Yes, sir.

361
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,482
And that's exactly why
you need to hire me.

362
00:37:56,648 --> 00:37:59,903
You're going to have
to explain that to me.

363
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,833
I can't remember a time
I wasn't outgunned,

364
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:05,636
outmanned, or out supplied
fighting you Yankees.

365
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:08,995
But I damn sure whooped
your asses more often than not.

366
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,747
Is that so?

367
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:13,711
Yes, sir. My men rode to hell
and back for me, Mr. Durant.

368
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:17,337
That's why you need me out here.

369
00:38:18,941 --> 00:38:21,507
What do you know about
building railroads?

370
00:38:21,673 --> 00:38:22,988
Well, I had to learn
how they was built

371
00:38:23,113 --> 00:38:25,223
so I could figure out
bestow to blow them up.

372
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:26,857
You remember the Baltimore

373
00:38:26,982 --> 00:38:29,260
and Ohio bridge over
the monacacy river?

374
00:38:29,385 --> 00:38:31,559
I built that bridge before the war.

375
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,767
I blew the whole thing up

376
00:38:35,892 --> 00:38:39,400
using half a keg of black powder...

377
00:38:39,566 --> 00:38:42,439
But I'm done
destroying things, Mr. Durant.

378
00:38:42,564 --> 00:38:45,240
I want to help you
build this railroad.

379
00:38:49,172 --> 00:38:53,581
Why should I trust
my railroad to a gray back?

380
00:38:55,478 --> 00:38:58,724
You didn't have too much trouble
trusting gray backs

381
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:02,461
when you was smuggling cotton out of
Mississippi during the war, now did ya?

382
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:04,300
You walk a fine line, son.

383
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:06,198
40 Miles, Mr. Durant.

384
00:39:06,323 --> 00:39:09,347
Ain't no secret you got to lay
40 Miles of usable track

385
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,803
before your government
money kicks in.

386
00:39:11,928 --> 00:39:14,372
Now, you and I both know

387
00:39:14,497 --> 00:39:17,272
that you ain't gonna get
there going at this rate.

388
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,900
You don't get that $16,000 a mile,

389
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:23,572
this whole thing goes belly-up.

390
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,449
You're fighting a war, Mr. Durant.

391
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:30,489
No doubt about it.

392
00:39:30,614 --> 00:39:34,122
You need me to help you win it.

393
00:39:48,568 --> 00:39:50,013
Son of a bitch.

394
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,684
What the hell are you doing, man?

395
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,477
He's the son of a bitch
who killed Johnson.

396
00:39:56,643 --> 00:39:57,686
We gonna hang him.

397
00:39:57,811 --> 00:39:59,314
Nonsense.

398
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:01,899
This is my new foreman.

399
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,820
Find me someone else to hang.

400
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:45,651
You're the new foreman?

401
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:47,653
Yeah.

402
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,868
Johnson's things still in there?

403
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,142
Yes, sir.

404
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:56,704
You want me to clear it out?

405
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,164
Leave it.

406
00:40:59,705 --> 00:41:01,472
Yes, sir.

407
