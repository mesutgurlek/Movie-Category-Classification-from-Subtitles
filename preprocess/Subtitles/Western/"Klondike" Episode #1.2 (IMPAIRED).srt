[Sighs]

823
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:03,622
We're in a tavern up north,

824
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:05,624
and there is this big Indian there.

825
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:07,959
Tlingit, I think.

826
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:10,579
And he's had a few, but he's not drunk.

827
00:52:10,581 --> 00:52:12,664
We decide we're going to
have a little fun with him.

828
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:16,418
Now, the man is standing with
his back to a mirror, see,

829
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,137
and we tell him, "if you turn your
head really fast toward the mirror,

830
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,139
you can see the back of your head."

831
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:22,841
[Laughter]

832
00:52:22,843 --> 00:52:25,927
Well, this savage just stares at us,

833
00:52:25,929 --> 00:52:27,596
doesn't say anything.

834
00:52:27,598 --> 00:52:30,015
Indian doesn't understand
English, we think.

835
00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:32,400
[Chuckles] Then we see him.

836
00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:34,436
When he thinks nobody's looking,

837
00:52:34,438 --> 00:52:36,888
he's whipping his head around like this.

838
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,074
He does it every three seconds or so.

839
00:52:39,076 --> 00:52:43,028
- Almost saw it.
- [Laughter]

840
00:52:45,998 --> 00:52:48,867
Could I have a word with you alone, sir?

841
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:52,087
How may I help you, Father?

842
00:52:52,089 --> 00:52:55,257
Well, the prisoners you're about to hang

843
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:57,092
are innocent.

844
00:52:57,094 --> 00:52:59,177
And you say that why?

845
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:01,763
Because I've spoken to the murderer.

846
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:03,765
He's a white man.

847
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:05,267
What's his name?

848
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:08,637
I don't know his name or his face.

849
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:11,540
It was in the darkness of the confessional.

850
00:53:11,552 --> 00:53:13,987
And the bond of the confessional
prevents you from saying more,

851
00:53:13,988 --> 00:53:16,471
- no doubt.
- Yes, sir.

852
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:18,356
Even if I did know more I wouldn't say,

853
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:20,275
- but I don't know more.
- Ah.

854
00:53:20,277 --> 00:53:22,694

[Laughter]

856
00:53:24,148 --> 00:53:26,698
Boys, remind me never
to confess to a priest.

857
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,450
He'll blab it all over town.

[Laughter]

859
00:53:30,738 --> 00:53:33,121
I've known men like you.

860
00:53:33,123 --> 00:53:35,657
Strong with others, weak alone.

861
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:38,627
I said what I came to say.

862
00:53:38,629 --> 00:53:41,630
Now you do with it what you will.

863
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:45,050
Hey, priest.

864
00:53:45,052 --> 00:53:47,035
You know if you turn around really fast,

865
00:53:47,037 --> 00:53:48,503
you can see the back of your head?

866
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:50,255
[Laughter]

867
00:53:55,178 --> 00:53:56,595
Wait.

868
00:53:58,648 --> 00:54:01,066
The man who confessed, you sure it was

869
00:54:01,068 --> 00:54:04,102
the killing of Byron
Epstein he was talking about?

870
00:54:10,276 --> 00:54:13,111
It's amazing to me... how you can all

871
00:54:13,113 --> 00:54:16,164
have a chuckle when innocent
men are likely to die.

872
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:18,667
You don't understand how it is.

873
00:54:18,669 --> 00:54:20,786
There's a lot more going on.

874
00:54:20,788 --> 00:54:23,505
I can't think of anything that would
trump the death of innocent men.

875
00:54:23,507 --> 00:54:25,874
You'd be the last person I would think

876
00:54:25,876 --> 00:54:27,926
to get on a soapbox.

877
00:54:29,629 --> 00:54:31,346
Why?

878
00:54:31,348 --> 00:54:33,414
Because I'm a whore?

879

There's only one whore

standing out here, Superintendent,

and it isn't me.

out is just the tail of the beast.

Did you get a look at the assailant?

00:56:27,457 --> 00:56:31,042
Got to be the same one that killed Epstein.

910
00:56:31,044 --> 00:56:33,461
They want the mine.

911
00:56:33,463 --> 00:56:35,713
That's the problem with property
rights in this territory.

If the claim owner dies, his next of kin

has one week to take possession.

914

No one can get here in a week.

Unless they're already here.

If both you and Mr. Meeker had died,

that mine would be a free-for-all.

the killing to someone.

990
01:02:45,049 --> 01:02:47,033
What's going on, Val?

991
01:02:47,035 --> 01:02:49,753
Count rented the place for the night.

992
01:02:58,263 --> 01:03:01,315
How about I lift that off you?

993
01:03:04,102 --> 01:03:07,387
Ain't no way to conduct business.

994
01:03:07,389 --> 01:03:10,390
Are we gonna have a problem?

995
01:03:10,392 --> 01:03:12,860
That's a good lass.

996
01:03:12,862 --> 01:03:16,029
How about we have a seat over
there at the special table?

997
01:03:17,899 --> 01:03:20,367
Count pay you by the day
or pay you by the gun?

998
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:23,170
You ain't gonna buy me out.

999
01:03:23,172 --> 01:03:26,173
I got no need for your type.

1000
01:03:44,392 --> 01:03:46,092
Count: $2,000 U.S.

1001
01:03:48,062 --> 01:03:49,780
The deal was for $6,000.

1002
01:03:49,782 --> 01:03:52,032
Yeah, but your properties are rotten.

1003
01:03:52,034 --> 01:03:53,600
They're not worth that.

1004
01:03:53,602 --> 01:03:55,285
You're not buying properties.

1005
01:03:55,287 --> 01:03:57,404
You're buying peace of mind.

1006
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:01,408
$3,000?

1007
01:04:03,578 --> 01:04:05,779
$6,000.

1008
01:04:05,781 --> 01:04:09,416
You know, I was the first
one that believed in you,

1009
01:04:09,418 --> 01:04:12,252
back when even you didn't believe in you.

1010
01:04:12,254 --> 01:04:14,788
Now look at you.

1011
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,139
Eh?

1012
01:04:16,141 --> 01:04:17,508
Was I wrong?

1013
01:04:21,396 --> 01:04:23,263
You don't have it, do you?

1014
01:04:27,134 --> 01:04:29,436
Your men here know you
don't have the money.

1015
01:04:29,438 --> 01:04:32,105
What my men know is that my new lumber yard

1016
01:04:32,107 --> 01:04:33,807
has got better equipment than yours.

1017
01:04:33,809 --> 01:04:37,528
On any given business
day, I pull in $1,000,

1018
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:40,531
which means that $6,000 is nothing to me.

1019
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:42,416
Then pay it.

1020
01:04:44,285 --> 01:04:47,254
Get me a beer while you're at it.

1021
01:04:47,256 --> 01:04:50,791
Champagne's... soft.

1022
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,164
There's cash in the back. Get it.

1023
01:04:58,166 --> 01:05:01,018
Man: That cash is a
big chunk of your money.

1024
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,519

1025
01:05:02,521 --> 01:05:05,305
So, get it.

1026
01:05:08,059 --> 01:05:10,727
How do I know you're not gonna
shoot me like you did McDonald?

1027
01:05:10,729 --> 01:05:12,563
Well, because McDonald and I,

1028
01:05:12,565 --> 01:05:14,364
we didn't have the history that we have.

1029
01:05:16,484 --> 01:05:18,569
I suggest you sign that.

1030
01:05:18,571 --> 01:05:21,855
'Cause otherwise I might change my mind

1031
01:05:21,857 --> 01:05:25,525
and wait you out, watch you drop dead.

1032
01:05:25,527 --> 01:05:29,129
You got the typhus, right?

1033
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:34,534
Bring me the cash.

1034
01:05:47,065 --> 01:05:48,682
Give me a pen.

Where's dog?

1049
01:07:57,627 --> 01:07:59,276
He's run off.

1050

Dog knows something.

1051

Smells a blizzard coming, maybe.

1052
01:08:04,784 --> 01:08:09,119
You ascribe a lot of intellect to that dog.

1053
01:08:09,121 --> 01:08:13,624
Well, he's got what's
needed in these environs.

1054
01:08:13,626 --> 01:08:15,626
More than we got.

01:08:19,598 --> 01:08:22,517
You ought to know...

1056
01:08:22,519 --> 01:08:25,319
Belinda's taken down with the typhus.

1057
01:08:25,321 --> 01:08:28,739
She's on a cot in judge's.

1058

I know you two have feelings.
You're like school kids.

1059
01:08:34,247 --> 01:08:37,114
You show your love by fighting each other.

How bad is it?

Keep talking.

1074

When I first saw you,

1075
01:10:28,945 --> 01:10:32,280
I thought to myself, "that woman

1076

is stronger than iron."

1077

You dominate a room just by standing in it.

I'm tired of kicking.
