means he's right-handed.

167
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,370
If you're right-handed,
do you inject your left or right arm?

168
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,180
- Left.
- Left.

169
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,059
So why is he shooting
up into his right arm?

170
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,771
Maybe somebody else injected him.

171
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,027
What are you two doing?

172
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,429
Looking for more needle marks.

173
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,682
Sometimes users shoot
up between their toes

174
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,910
to hide the injection marks.

175
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,623
So far, he's just got the one
injection mark in his right arm, so...

176
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,904
No marks on this foot.

177
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,591
This one's clean, too.

178
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,872
Which makes me think...

179
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,434
Joey wasn't a user.

180
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,268
Then what was he?

181
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,813
[Malachi] Well, now.

182
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,856
Looky here.

183
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,854
Tickle his toes all you want, Victoria.

184
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,624
I don't think he's gonna wake up.

185
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,291
[laughs]

186
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,611
And there he is.

187
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,656
Red Pony's own cigar store Indian.

188
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,759
[chuckles]

189
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:28,014
Let's make sure we get plenty
of pictures of everything.

190
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:32,543
We need to get the victim's
car to the shed for prints.

191
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,421
I'm gonna send that syringe
to the lab in Cheyenne.

192
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,422
Okay.

193
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,691
[trunk lid closes]

194
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,037
[sighs]

195
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,933
[keyboard keys clacking]

196
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,464
So, did you call the
sheriff like I suggested?

197
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,609
Walt is at the Red Pony now.

198
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,740
Which he has already deduced
to be a murder scene.

199
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:26,071
[Mathias] So the scumbag was murdered.

200
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,849
Presumably, that's not a
problem for either of us.

201
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,661
Not until Walt starts asking questions.
What do I tell him?

202
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,104
How about the truth?

203
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,584
That Joey Takoda was a drug dealer
who got what was coming to him.

204
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,587
But I already acted like
I did not know him.

205
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,613
Then don't say anything.

206
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,675
Who cares if Walt figures out
who killed some heroin dealer?

207
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,207
We <i>both</i> should care.

208
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,334
I torched Joey's entire stash,

209
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,253
and when I did,
he was scared for his life.

210
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,881
Clearly, he had good reason to be.

211
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,777
I think whoever killed him
may be coming after Hector next.

212
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,612
Why?

213
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,097
Days after I burn Joey's drugs,

214
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,701
he shows up dead in my parking lot.
Coincidence?

215
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,269
I'm the only one who
knows you're Hector.

216
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,271
And even if someone else did know,

217
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,252
how would they guess that Hector
was the one that burned up that heroin?

218
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,546
Maybe because I spray-painted
"Hector Lives" across the house.

219
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,174
Well, that was stupid.

220
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,663
I never intended to be
a criminal mastermind.

221
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,999
And now <i>we</i> have a problem.

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,919
I am sure that Walt will go to
Joey Takoda's house to investigate,

223
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,440
but we might be able to paint over
Hector's name before he does.

224
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,068
Maybe.

225
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,761
[intercom buzzes]

226
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,656
[Woman] <i>Mathias, Sheriff
Longmire's here to see you.</i>

227
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,662
Or maybe not.

228
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,952
[Vic] Hey. So I got the
coroner's initial results back.

229
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,763
Hey, uh, so, what did he say?

230
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,956
Joey Takoda died
from respiratory failure

231
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:19,227
and cardiac arrest due to
a large dose of heroin.

232
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,837
- Was he a user?
- Can't tell yet.

233
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,130
But the coroner couldn't find any
more injection marks on his body,

234
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,049
so he's gonna do a
more thorough autopsy.

235
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,801
He probably wants to look at the lungs.

236
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,803
Oxygen deprivation damages the tissue.

237
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:33,490
It's a telltale sign of long-term abuse.

238
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,493
It's so cool that you know that.

239
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,414
What'd you find out in <i>your</i> questioning?

240
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,583
Yeah. Uh, so, um...

241
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,111
there's no evidence of any bad
batches of heroin making the rounds,

242
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,049
but there has been a significant
uptick in, uh, heroin overdoses.

243
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,033
Heroin's exploded over
the last couple months.

244
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,327
It's a rare shift not to
have a few heroin cases

245
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,037
coming through the E.R.

246
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,099
It's not just here.
It's small towns everywhere.

247
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,460
[chuckles]

248
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,520
Awesome. Ferg, let's go.

249
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,967
So, I sent the syringe
off to the lab in Cheyenne,

250
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,219
but we're not gonna get
the results back for a while.

251
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,971
Oh, shoot.

252
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,532
I think I left my phone back there.
I'll be right back.

253
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,228
Excuse me, sir.

254
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,689
Can I ask you a question
you might be able to answer?

255
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,065
I'll try.

256
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,109
What's wrong with my black water hose?

257
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,819
Black hose.

258
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,172
I have absolutely no idea.

259
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,679
Hey.

260
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,540
Did you forget something?

261
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,309
I did.

262
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,581
[sighs]

263
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,548
I appreciate you letting me
search the victim's house.

264
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,368
You know anything about him?

265
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,263
[Mathias] Well, by the looks of things,

266
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,415
I'm thinking he didn't
have a girlfriend.

267
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,417
[Walt] Have any enemies?

268
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,270
Yeah. Me.

269
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,005
Why's that?

270
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,718
I arrested this asshole three separate
times for dealing drugs on the Res.

271
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,510
But I couldn't hold him.

272
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,556
All I was allowed to do was
charge him with a misdemeanor.

273
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:41,267
Well, it looks like he died
of a heroin overdose.

274
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,229
- Do you know if he used?
- No idea.

275
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,291
Do you know everyone who's using
hard drugs in <i>your</i> jurisdiction?

276
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,839
Well, there's, um...

277
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,949
no needles...

278
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,929
no pipes, no bent spoons
anywhere in this place.

279
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,623
No track marks on his body.

280
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:06,644
It's odd for a non-user to die
of an overdose, don't you think?

281
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,754
Honestly, I don't care.

282
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,525
All I know is that there's one less
person peddling drugs on my land.

283
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:16,344
But if you're so concerned about solving
the lonesome death of Joey Takoda,

284
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,074
why don't we head back to the station
so I can give you my files on him?

285
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,912
Thanks. We'll do that.

286
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,821
Looks like I have a suspect.

287
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,033
Hector doesn't kill.

288
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,225
The real Hector didn't kill.

289
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:08,038
I'm not so sure this new Hector
has the same kind of self-control.

290
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,858
And as much as I understand how the
law works against your people,

291
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,902
I just can't look the other way.

292
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,422
If Hector killed someone in my county...

293
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,031
[sighs]

294
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,991
Well, whoever this Hector is,

295
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,328
I'm not gonna play any part
in helping you arrest him.

296
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,723
You've investigated the victim's house.

297
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,582
- Favor's finished.
- That's fine.

298
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,685
Now I know what I'm looking for.

299
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,190
Pain in the butt.

300
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,105
You guys look like a couple of pros.

301
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,108
If I'm gonna be in sportsman country,
I'm gonna be a sportsman.

302
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,818
Not a tourist.

303
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:59,715
I, uh... understand that you
might be a little upset.

304
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,884
So you got my message?

305
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,493
Message?

306
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,139
Oh, the... the kid in the parking lot.
Joey?

307
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,541
Um, it's a little excessive,
don't you think?

308
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,294
He lost $10,000 worth of product.

309
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,440
What do you expect? Time-out chair?

310
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,843
Well, could have been
some kind of mistake.

311
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,428
How does a kid go and
lose that much heroin?

312
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,948
[Shane] He didn't lose it.

313
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,700
He said some guy named
Hector burned it up.

314
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,536
Well, then, why didn't you kill Hector?

315
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,290
We couldn't find him.

316
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,066
But we found the kid.

317
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,628
Turns out he couldn't
reimburse our losses,

318
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,114
- so...
- I see.

319
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,716
Well...

320
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,262
Careful now, Wahoo.

321
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,207
Always.

322
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,853
I've got a little over two grand on me.

323
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,535
[chuckles lightly]

324
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,947
I'll give you two weeks
to come up with the rest,

325
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,757
plus 20% interest.

326
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:27,761
You do know that I can, uh,
get you something much better.

327
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,763
Like what?

328
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,851
Like the head of Hector himself.

329
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,963
You mean instead of the
remaining eight grand?

330
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,273
Yes.

331
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:43,759
Plus, uh... going forward,

332
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,489
I want another 5% on everything
you run through the casino...

333
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,765
that's drugs, whores, everything.

334
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,912
If this Hector is still, uh,
lurking around,

335
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,147
he'll at least be that much
of a drag on your business.

336
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,525
So, if we, uh, if we move him out,

337
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,277
everybody wins.

338
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,964
And there won't be anybody
here to match you.

339
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,867
Except maybe you, old-timer.

340
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:09,929
I've run into your kind before.

341
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,472
Yeah? Where?

342
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,683
Belfast.

343
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,813
So, is it a deal?

344
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,527
You're still breathing, aren't you?

345
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,655
Do you know this man?

346
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,284
Probably not.

347
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,662
His name's Joey Takoda.
Have you heard anything about him?

348
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,313
Yeah, I heard that you
were looking for him.

349
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,915
[Bob] Knock it off, Billy.

350
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,959
You owe the sheriff.
Now answer him honestly.

351
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,046
Honestly, the sheriff can kiss my ass.

352
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:47,675
[Bob] Now you can talk to me like that,
but not him.

353
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,094
He deserves your respect.

354
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,121
Now look at this picture and tell him...

355
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,932
You tell Walt if you've seen
this man before or not.

356
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,811
[Walt] I know you got
some connection to him.

357
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,815
I found the same heroin pod in
your pocket that I found on him.

358
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,050
All right.

359
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,111
All right.

360
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,779
He's a Res guy. He's a dealer.

361
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,740
Anything else?

362
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,934
Yeah.
If he knew I was talking about him,

363
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:17,312
he'd probably show up at my door
with a baseball bat and a .30-06.

364
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,123
[Walt] Joey's dead, Billy.

365
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,167
Did he have trouble with anyone?

366
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:26,279
Anybody ever talk about...
sending Hector after him?

367
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,781
Look, I don't know
anything about Hector,

368
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,218
but there was a girl who tried to get me

369
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,994
to steal a bunch of smack off of Joey,

370
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,972
which I refused to do
because I'm not an idiot.

371
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,726
You think she may have recruited
somebody else to rip him off?

372
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,418
Yeah, that was her plan.

373
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,938
Is she Cheyenne?
Could she have sent Hector?

374
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,523
No, she's not Native.

375
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,234
But she is persuasive.

376
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:51,029
- Her name's Jule.
- Jule what?

377
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,116
I don't know. It's not like we
spent a lot of time talking.

378
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:57,536
Is this Jule the same girl that
we found you with this morning?

379
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,750
I was with somebody this morning?

380
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,945
[paper rustles]

381
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,573
One last question, Billy.

382
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,076
Have you ever run into
anybody wearing a black hood

383
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,203
and a red sash around their neck

384
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,099
out at that party site or on the Res?

385
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,601
No.

386
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,770
I think even I'd remember
seeing something like that.

387
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,635
Walt wants us to go through
mug shots and arrest records.

388
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:34,072
We're looking for a woman named
Jule as a possible murder suspect.

389
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,851
- Jule what?
- Don't know.

390
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,247
Walt says she's a known heroin user,

391
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,915
probably in her mid-20s.

392
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,401
[sighs] Okay.

393
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:50,881
"Jule" could be short
for Julia, Juliana...

394
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,199
You know,
we should call the high school

395
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,594
and have them send over
their most recent yearbooks.

396
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,929
The last time heroin
swept through Philly,

397
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,415
it hit the good kids as
hard as it hit the bad.

398
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,918
I saw cheerleading honor
students O.D. at 17.

399
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,920
Since heroin is new to Durant,

400
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,023
this Jule probably doesn't
have a record yet.

401
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,153
Any hits on Jule?

402
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,615
No, you just called from the
road like a minute ago.

403
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,582
What you looking for?

404
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,484
Well, Ferg and Zach, uh,
put together a list

405
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,420
of possible Hectors a while back, so...

406
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,589
Yeah. It's in my desk.

407
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,718
Think there's a Jule or a Julie on it?

408
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,829
No, but, uh,
it's possible this new Hector

409
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,015
could be another suspect in this murder.

410
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:45,435
I found "Hector Lives" spray-painted
at the victim's house.

411
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,965
Here's the list with the names on it.

412
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,776
Zach checked into most of them.

413
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,070
Yeah. Zach.

414
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,390
Do you remember what he said the last
time we were looking for Hector?

415
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,244
"A badge and a gun
doesn't make you flawless."

416
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,187
- Yeah.
- Well, it wasn't too long ago

417
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,368
that you thought that he was
the one that shot Walt,

418
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:07,704
so going by that logic...

419
00:26:07,812 --> 00:26:09,692
You think that Zach is Hector?

420
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,778
Just saying that... that the
dead guy is a drug dealer.

421
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,049
We can't rule out the idea that
the killer has a badge and a gun.

422
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,886
Zach doesn't have a badge anymore.

423
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,537
Does he have a gun?

424
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,290
I-I know what I said before,

425
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,311
but I really think Zach
just wanted to help people.

426
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,897
Yeah, I'm sure that's what the new
Hector thinks he's doing, too.

427
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,403
I just feel like we shouldn't discount
people because we feel like we know them.

428
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,948
Especially if they're feeling powerless.

429
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,519
No.

430
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,079
We shouldn't.

431
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,322
[bag crinkles]

432
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,008
Fellas.

433
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:03,204
I'm guessing you may have missed out
investing in Apple and Google stock.

434
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:08,418
So allow me to introduce
a genuine business opportunity.

435
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,521
What opportunity is that, boss?

436
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,649
Early retirement with a
big, fat bank account.

437
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,009
And all you have to do is...
is bring Hector to me.

438
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,445
Dead or alive.

439
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,698
Hector's already dead.

440
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,491
Everyone knows that.

441
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,434
He's just a ghost story now.

442
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,036
No way. I saw him.

443
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,520
Or I almost did.

444
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,331
Anyway, he's alive and very real.

445
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,733
As fascinating as this
philosophical debate may be,

446
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,902
somebody's sticking their
hand in our business

447
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,654
and signing it "Hector."

448
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,257
Now, this has got to stop.

449
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,718
Okay. We'll keep our eyes open.

450
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,762
You'll keep your eyes open?

451
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,789
This isn't a bunch of Indians
sitting around type of deal.

452
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,394
This is "Get off your asses
or else" type of deal.

453
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,186
I can't do it.

454
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,939
What was that?

455
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,757
I'm sorry.

456
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,192
Hector's a spirit,

457
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,195
a descendant of the Dog Soldiers.

458
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,072
I can't do it.

459
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,474
[sighs] So you're saying

460
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:08,412
you're more afraid of
Hector than you are of me.

461
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:13,608
I'm saying if Hector is really
speaking for our ancestors...

464
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:28,765
Well... if Hector really <i>is</i> a spirit,

465
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,684
you tell him hello for me.

466
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,602
And let him know that
I'm coming for him.

Walt.

472
00:28:57,027 --> 00:29:00,005
- Malachi's put fish on the menu?
- No.

473
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,509
A couple of tourists asked me
to cook their fresh catch.

474
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,848
So, uh...

475
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,937
the man you found today
was actually murdered.

476
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,066
Turns out he was dealing on the Res.

477
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:24,988
And "Hector Lives" was spray-painted
on the side of his house.

478
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,279
Which makes me think that Hector may have
had something to do with this murder,

479
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,725
so...

480
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,496
I need to ask you something
about this new Hector.

481
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,001
Fire away.

482
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,630
Is Hector...

483
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:46,134
actually... Mathias?

484
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,056
Mathias.

485
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,143
What makes you think
he has become a vigilante?

486
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,354
Mathias tried to arrest
Joey for dealing,

487
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,130
but he could never hold him.

488
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,733
So he was frustrated.

489
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,427
Just like he was when he
couldn't arrest Gab's rapist.

490
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:07,573
Now, becoming Hector
would get him around all that.

491
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,624
Mathias is not the only
person who is frustrated

492
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,517
by the limits of Reservation law.

493
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,202
[Walt] No.

494
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,020
But Mathias <i>is</i> the only person

495
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,916
to come to me with notes
taken from Hector's jar.

496
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:22,962
Now, one of those notes called
for the death of Gab's rapist.

497
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,740
Mathias claimed that he
intercepted those notes,

498
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:29,994
but if he did, how would Hector
know to show up at the bonfire

499
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:33,641
unless Hector is Mathias?

500
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,685
[sighs]

501
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,089
You said you found "Hector Lives"
graffiti at the victim's house?

502
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,066
I did.

503
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,551
And Mathias tried to
keep me from finding it.

504
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,638
But the body was found
here in the parking lot.

505
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,056
If it was Hector that killed him,

506
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,018
why not write "Hector Lives" on the
car or on the side of the Red Pony?

507
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,002
Why do it all the way back
at the victim's house?

508
00:30:56,003 --> 00:30:57,146
I don't know.

509
00:30:57,147 --> 00:31:00,459
Is it possible that this
murder is unrelated to Hector?

510
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:05,213
Either way, this new Hector
needs to be stopped.

511
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,342
Okay.

512
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,497
But given all the... attention

513
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,375
focused on you with your civil suit,

514
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,960
you should probably rule
out all other suspects

515
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,647
before you make an
accusation that serious.

516
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,985
[fish sizzling]

517
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:35,160
So, what abuse of authority
is on the menu today?

518
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,144
Harassment? Entrapment?

519
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,039
I'm actually investigating a murder,

520
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,690
so if you'll excuse me.

521
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,274
My son is not a murderer.

522
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,377
- Where are you going?!
- To talk to your son.

523
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,406
Hey, Travis! Are you up yet?

524
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,825
Vic? Is that you?!

525
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,702
Uh, yeah. Of course I'm up.

526
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:55,287
Um... what are you doing here?

527
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,671
[Vic] I need to ask you something.

528
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,106
Uh, yeah, sure.

529
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,810
The... The door's unlocked.

530
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,813
Nope. Not this time, missy.

531
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,690
Um...

532
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,858
your mommy won't let me in.

533
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,318
Mom!

534
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,344
Answer the question

535
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,030
through the door, Travis.

536
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,264
[sighs]

537
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,449
[Vic] Um...

538
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,455
Do you recognize that guy?

539
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,275
I don't think so. Who is he?

540
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,003
[Vic] His name's Joey Takoda.

541
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:30,030
He's a drug dealer that was
found murdered at the Red Pony.

542
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,009
I was thinking maybe you'd
seen him there, at the casino?

543
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,744
I don't recognize him.

544
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,245
[Vic] What about a girl named Jule?

545
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,849
- You ever run into her?
- The singer?

546
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,667
Oh, I wish he would meet someone
like that instead of...

547
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,977
Mom. Damn it!

548
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,438
I think I can handle this.

549
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,207
[Mary Jo] Of course you <i>think</i> you can.

550
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,192
But I'll be watching.

551
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,611
I see everything.

552
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,075
I'm sorry. Um...

553
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:01,705
I don't think I know any Jule.

554
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,290
I'm sorry. I-I wish...
I wish I could help you.

555
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,378
Um... you might still be able to.

556
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,862
Yeah?

557
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,739
You used to have a trailer home, right?

558
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,407
Yeah. Yeah.

559
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,303
What the hell is wrong
with my black water hose?

560
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,707
[knock on door]

561
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,976
Come in!

562
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,986
I got your message. What did Walt say?

563
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,032
Walt thinks Hector murdered
the heroin dealer.

564
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,533
Well, we knew that would happen.

565
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,202
And he thinks Hector is you.

566
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,771
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

567
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,081
Me?

568
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,027
Shit.

569
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,588
Well put.

570
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,575
So, what's Walt gonna do now?

571
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:59,763
[Henry] I imagine he will keep
digging until he proves his theory.

572
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,372
But...

573
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,459
if we can get Walt off the
idea that Hector is a killer,

574
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,729
he might stop.

575
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,129
He'll still be suspicious of me.

576
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,991
And that'll put him awfully close
to discovering the truth about you.

577
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:18,180
Well, then maybe we should
start with the truth about me.

578
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,683
Walt needs to realize
that all that Hector did

579
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,577
is burn Joey Takoda's drugs.

580
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,955
Well, how are you gonna manage that?

581
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,941
Very carefully.

582
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,627
And with your help. [grunts]

583
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,509
How are you feeling, Billy?

584
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,097
Like warmed-over shit.

585
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,837
My deputies have, uh,
put together some pictures.

586
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,881
Are any of these women the Jule

587
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,442
that wanted your help
ripping off Joey Takoda?

588
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,053
Um...

589
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,322
[sniffs]

590
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,392
Man, I don't know.

591
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,895
I just see her at parties.

592
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,331
She'd show up whenever I scored dope.

593
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,544
Uh...

594
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,756
I think that's her.

595
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,177
There.

596
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,204
Well, she's changed,

597
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,850
but I think that's who
you were with yesterday.

598
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,501
Is that... Is that a yearbook photo?

599
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,421
[Walt] It is. Junior year.

600
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,381
How many years ago?

601
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,984
[Walt] Last year.

602
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,737
So Jule would be 18, at most.

603
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,948
Eighteen.

604
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,418
Shit.

00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,826
[Vic] All right, ma'am. I understand.

607
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,536
Can you at least tell
me where to find Jule?

608
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,306
[keyboard keys clacking]

609
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,060
And do she and her grannie
share the same last name?

610
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,146
Hello?

611
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,672

[sighs]

00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,390
Any progress?

615
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,810
Oh, I don't know.

616
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:32,082
Does completely solving your entire
damn problem count as progress?

617
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,149
Are you serious?

618
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,318
You fixed it? How?

619
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:40,506
Good ol' American
stick-to-it-iveness and ingenuity.

620
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,283
Also, uh...

621
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,244
I went up to the hardware store.

622
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:49,206
Your... Your adapter...
well, it was all busted.

623
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,500
It turns out the, uh, male
end and the female end

weren't exactly, uh, <i>simpatico.</i>

625
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,925
I guess I have intuition
when it comes to stuff like that.

626
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,736
So, um, you're welcome.

627
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:06,724
How about you?
Any luck on your... your Jule search?

628
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,101
Uh, all Jule's mom would tell me

629
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,365
was that after she kicked her
daughter out of the house,

630
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:14,010
Jule moved in with her Grannie Ethel.

631
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,653
[tool thuds]

632
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,071
What is it?

633
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,990
Um...

634
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:26,011
Lot 64.

635
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:31,682
Yesterday, I heard about...
an Ethel and her granddaughter,

636
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:34,937
and they live on Lot 64.

637
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,152
Oh, Walter.

638
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,679
There you are.

639
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,116
Bob Barnes just called,

640
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,911
and they're kicking Billy
out of the rehab facility.

641
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,831
Kicking him out? What for?

642
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,460
Well, Bob can't afford it.

643
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,352
I've been calling around to see
if the state facilities can take him,

644
00:38:01,353 --> 00:38:03,506
but they've all got wait lists.

645
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,510
I remember what a sweet
little boy he was.

646
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,516
Do you know anybody with some pull

647
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:18,687
that could maybe help him
get moved up the list?

648
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,482
Actually, I do.

649
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,195
[clears throat]

650
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,937
[Ethel] Can I help you, hon?

651
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,940
Yeah, I-I'm Deputy Moretti
from the sheriff's department.

652
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:41,861
Oh, did you find my
Social Security check?

653
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:44,905
Well, my granddaughter called
you about it last week.

654
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,424
No, ma'am. I'm sorry.

655
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,325
- We haven't found it yet.
- Oh.

656
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,660
But I am looking for
your granddaughter.

657
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,181
Jule, is it? - Juliette.

658
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,558
Well, I think she's in the bathroom.

659
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,560
I hear the water running.

660
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,979
She'll just be a minute. Come on in!

661
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,232
Thank you.

662
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,071
Come on in.

663
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,805
I'll just check and see if
she's out of the shower.

664
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,391
Okay.

665
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:16,979
Juliette, someone is here to see you.

666
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,789
[knock on door]

667
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,307
[Ethel] <i>I'm sure she'll be right out.</i>

668
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,249
Can I get you a ginger ale?

669
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,126
- Uh, yes, please.
- Okay.

670
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,062
Have a seat.

671
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,903
[Travis] Hey.

672
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,032
Jule!

673
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,741
Can we... Can we talk?

674
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,976
No.

675
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,453
- Hey!
- No!

676
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,289
Hey! Come back! Stop!

677
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,124
- No!
- Citizen's arrest!

678
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,917
So does your granddaughter
live here with you?

679
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:07,279
Yes. Uh-huh.
But I barely see her anymore.

680
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,924
She's a very busy young woman.

681
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:14,137
Halt in the name of the
Absaroka County Sheriff's Department!

682
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,684
[Ethel] With her job and her friends,

683
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,478
we always called her our overachiever.

684
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:23,521
[chuckles]

685
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,899
Get away from me! [grunts]

686
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:30,028
Get away! Agh! Get away from me!

687
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,862
- Calm down.
- [screams]

688
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,515
You know, she's been in there a while.

689
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:35,699
Do you mind if I go check on her?

690
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,702
Well, I... I suppose that's fine.

691
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,288
Okay. Thank you.

692
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,253
[knock on door]

693
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,216
[Jule screams] Let me go, you asshole!

694
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,178
I really hope this is the
girl you're looking for.

695
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,038
- [Jule] Let me go!
- [Travis] Just chill out!

696
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,098
[Jule groans]

697
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,017
[Walt sighs]

698
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,814
Do you know this man?

699
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,982
Nope.

700
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,985
[Walt] Really?

701
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,404
I heard that he was your heroin dealer.

702
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,514
And you were planning on robbing him.

703
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:19,619
[chuckles]
Sounds like junkie talk to me.

704
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,080
Drop the attitude, Jule.
We know Joey's dead.

705
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,582
We're investigating his murder, okay?

706
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,441
And the junkie talk that we're hearing

707
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,378
is more than enough to make
you our primary suspect.

708
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,989
Well, I didn't kill him,

709
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,658
and I wasn't planning on robbing him,
either.

710
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,910
I was just planning on
getting what was mine.

711
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,221
He owed me.

712
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,164
What'd he owe you?

713
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,891
Money?

714
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:47,754
Let's say, hypothetically,
a girl needed medicine.

715
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,340
But that girl has no money.

716
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,468
So, hypothetically,

717
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,013
this girl becomes really friendly

718
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:58,807
with the guy with [chuckling]
a lot of medicine

719
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,726
so she could get more.

720
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,829
You slept with a drug
dealer for heroin?

721
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,356
[Jule] Yeah. It's not
actually something

722
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,818
you would put in your
annual Christmas letter.

723
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:11,504
But, yeah, I did.

724
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,340
[Walt] You said that Joey owed you.

725
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,260
Did something go wrong
with your arrangement?

726
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,637
You could say that.

727
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,292
[sighs]

728
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:30,022
We were at Joey's, the
usual arrangement.

729
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:36,279
After we'd spend some time together,
he was gonna hook me up.

730
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,781
But we got interrupted.

731
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:41,450
By who?

732
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,684
I don't know.

733
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:46,331
This... redheaded dude.

734
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,875
I didn't get a name,
but [chuckles] Joey was scared of him.

735
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:55,364
Anyway, this redhead told Joey
that he was short 100 bucks this week

736
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:59,927
and that if it happened again,
he'd get "emotional."

737
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:05,808
After that, Joey refused to
give me any more from his stash

738
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:10,896
after I'd completely satisfied
my end of the deal.

739
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,277
So, did you get someone
to help you rob Joey?

740
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:18,595
I didn't rob Joey.

741
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,805
I didn't need to.

742
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,033
I found another way to score.

743
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:25,245
You find someone else to sleep with?

744
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:32,419
Grannie Ethel always said
I was a very clever girl.

745
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,231
Hello!

746
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:15,043
Got a Meat Lovers,
half-order of garlic knots!

747
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,646
[sighs]

748
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,718
[engine starts]

749
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,696
[screaming]

750
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:49,311
Brought over those files on
Joey Takoda I mentioned.

751
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:51,563
Thanks. [clears throat]

752
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,583
Take a seat.

753
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:01,799
In your many run-ins with Joey,
did you ever encounter a redheaded man?

754
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,301
No. Why?

755
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:09,873
Because a redheaded man seems to
have been Joey's heroin supplier.

756
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:13,520
He also threatened his life
when he was short on a payment.

757
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,939
Does that mean you're off
your Hector theory?

758
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,261
Is that why you're really here?

759
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:24,906
To see if I'm off my Hector theory?

760
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,224
[knock on door, door opens]

761
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,934
Walter, excuse me.

762
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,621
Jamie DeBell is on line one.

763
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,290
- What does he want?
- I couldn't tell.

764
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,709
He was hyperventilating.

765
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,821
[panting]

766
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,198
He s... He said his name was Hector.

767
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,845
He held me up and then took my car.

768
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,515
- Who would want to steal my car?
- Nobody.

769
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,350
Found it down the road.

770
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,064
[groans]

771
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:04,052
- So, what'd this Hector look like?
- I don't know.

772
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:08,973
He had a black hood covering his face
and a red string around his neck.

773
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:12,077
Which honestly seemed like
kind of a safety hazard.

774
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,372
How tall was Hector?

775
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,816
He was tall. About as tall as you.

776
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:21,570
- Hector again?
- Sounds like it.

777
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:24,656
- Did he say anything to you?
- Yeah.

778
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,909
Said I was spreading
poison on the Reservation.

779
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,931
Then he took my merchandise
and burned it.

780
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,061
- [Mathias] What kind of merchandise?
- Tell him.

781
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:41,440
I'm a... cannabis enthusiast.

782
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,318
So Hector burned your pot?

783
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:47,136
He said, "You stay on your land,
I'll stay on mine."

784
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,864
I told him, "You got a deal."

785
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,308
If Hector's going around
destroying drugs,

786
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,120
maybe he just burned
Joey Takoda's stash.

787
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,708
Well, like I said, Hector doesn't kill.

788
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,444
I noticed a burn barrel
in Joey's backyard.

789
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,880
You should go back and
check for heroin residue.

790
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,886
You ever run into a
redheaded heroin dealer?

791
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:14,015
Yeah, actually. H-How did you know?

792
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:17,166
He offered me a job dealing heroin.

793
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,895
I turned him down 'cause I-I
don't do the hard stuff.

794
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,463
Too much stress makes me nauseous.

795
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,172
[Walt] You get his name or anything?

796
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,733
I got a business card.

797
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,070
There's no name, but a number.

798
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,575
So you've kept it?

799
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,828
I didn't want to litter.

800
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:41,167
I need you to call him back.

801
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,455
Tell him you've changed your mind.
You want to meet.

802
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:46,881
I assume that's preferable
to a drug-dealing arrest.

803
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,285
I thought you and I had...
an arrangement.

804
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,846
[Mathias] But you and I don't,

805
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,889
and this is my jurisdiction.

806
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,972
Your grandmother
thought I was visiting her

807
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,534
about a lost Social Security check.

808
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,203
She said that you'd reported it missing.

809
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,940
But I checked.

810
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,668
You didn't report it.

811
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:30,532
Because you're the one that stole it,
aren't you?

812
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:31,842
Yeah.

813
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:36,370
I stole my own grandmother's
Social Security check

814
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,891
so I could go and get high.

815
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,770
And I've always been her favorite one.

816
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,149
Have you stolen any more from her?

817
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,068
No. No.

818
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:55,181
I found that having sex
with a drug dealer

819
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,077
was easier to live with
than stealing from her.

820
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,151
[clears throat]

821
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,445
Come on.

822
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,632
I'll walk you in.

823
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,769
Juliette. You okay?

824
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,214
You know, she's actually, uh...

825
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,424
She's more than okay.

826
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,111
She just helped us with an
important investigation.

827
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:37,891
And that actually entitles her...

828
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,619
to a reward.

829
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,536
[clears throat]

830
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:44,415
But your granddaughter here...

831
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:48,335
she wanted me to make the
reward check out to you

832
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:53,031
because she thought
that that might help you

833
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:56,343
with the loss of your
Social Security check.

834
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:07,271
[Ethel] Thank you.

835
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:12,109
And thank you, my precious Juliette.

836
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,688
Why wouldn't he meet at the
location we suggested?

837
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,552
Why's he got to meet out here?
What's it mean?

838
00:50:27,553 --> 00:50:29,405
Jamie. Jamie. You need to relax.

839
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:33,404
All you got to do is get
the heroin and leave.

840
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,216
- We'll take care of the rest, okay?
- Okay.

841
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:39,679
Um, I'm guessing you want me
to record the conversation?

842
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,096
That would help.

843
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,349
Okay. Here.

844
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,002
You... You need me wired up, right?

845
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:51,590
Uh, just hit record...

846
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,275
and you're wired.

847
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,280
And while you're at it,
see if he'll give you any syringes.

848
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,640
The victim had a large
yellow syringe on him.

849
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,786
I was just at the hospital with Travis,
and they use different syringes.

850
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,622
So if this redhead has a yellow one,
that could connect him to the murder.

851
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:10,775
Murder? You...
You didn't say anything about a murder.

852
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,568
Is that who I'm gonna meet? A killer?

853
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,171
Jamie. Jamie. Come here. Come here.

854
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:18,324
Now, you were very good to my
wife during a difficult time.

855
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,744
I don't forget that.

856
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:25,266
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, okay?

857
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:28,811
Okay. Okay.

858
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,773
Okay. Okay. [sighs]

859
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,266
[engine starts]

860
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,913
You sure we have enough evidence
to convict this guy of the murder?

861
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:52,084
If we don't, at least we can
get him for selling heroin.

862
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:57,530
So, are we in the clear?

863
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,926
[Mathias]
<i>You are a criminal mastermind.</i>

864

Walt seems to be off Hector
as a murder suspect.

865
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,763
And off me as Hector.

866
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,205
Good.

867
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,082
Now we just have to keep him off of me.

[cell phone beeps]

869
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,199

00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,952
Yeah. Hector.

00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,124
He does not seem to be here.

873
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,127
Yeah, I know. But he's been here.

874
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:39,923
I've seen "Hector Lives"
graffiti in here before.

875
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:44,660
If you hear any Hector rumors,
let me know and I'll cut you in.

876
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,346
On what?

877
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,265
The bounty on Hector's head.

878
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,189
Remember me? We just talked.

879
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,251
I'm here for my supply.

880
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:22,365
I-I'm, uh, pretty excited about...

881
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:25,761
I mean, it's a real
gr-growth opportunity for me.

882
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:29,080
It may take me a while to...
to move the heroin, though.

883
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:31,100
A lot of my regulars
don't... don't use it.

884
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:42,069
Just don't come up short.

885
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:47,032
First time you're short,
you get a warning.

886
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:51,620
The second time... I get emotional.

887
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,257
It's in there.

888
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,555
[Jamie] Oh.

889
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:20,965
Okay I take some of these?

Don't oversell it.

Is there some kind of problem here?

905
00:55:05,283 --> 00:55:06,842
Not if you come over here right now.

All right. Yeah. I got it.

what you're talking about.

00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,778
Mr. Harp, I don't think you're
understanding the situation.

925
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:34,449
This man was drugged and
killed with a heroin overdose

926
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,660
from a large yellow syringe,

927
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:40,914
which matches the drugs and syringe
that we just found on you.

928
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:43,149
Nah, nah.

929
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:46,485
I think the guy that you got in your
cell had the heroin and syringes on him.

930
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,530
I was just out there fishing
when he offered me the drugs.

931
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,657
Yeah. I turned him down, of course.

932
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,344
The guy in my cell got the
drugs from your creel.

933
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,807
No, no, no. Hold on.
Y-You found drugs in my creel?

No. 'Cause you kicked
it over into the river.

with your version of events, Sheriff.

I'm not too sure a judge will, either.

Truly, I respect you.

00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,499
I just don't want that guy to
think that I'm in on any of this.

958
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,560
I'm pretty sure he doesn't.

959
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,312
- So, did he confess?
- No.

960
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,713
No, he insisted Jamie had the drugs

961

on him the entire time.

962
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,675
Which doesn't matter,

963
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,802
since we have the transaction on tape.

964

00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:43,495
[water rushing]

967
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:47,833
Now we know why he wanted
to meet Jamie by the creek.

968
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,484
Can't make out a thing they're saying.

969
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:51,819
[knock on door, door opens]

970
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,380
[Vic] Hey.

971
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:57,926
I just got off the phone with the FBI.

972
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,222
- What do they want?
- Eddie Harp.

973
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:04,154
Soon as I punched his
name into the database,

974
00:59:04,155 --> 00:59:05,916
I got a phone call from an FBI agent

975
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,300
saying they wanted to pick him
and transport him to Montana

976
00:59:08,301 --> 00:59:10,820
to question him in an ongoing
federal investigation.

977
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,024
Look.

978
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,801
I don't like the FBI being
involved any more than you do,

979
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,112
but maybe they've got more
on this guy than we've got.

980
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:22,576
And it's never a bad idea to get
a drug dealer out of the county.

981
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,246
- No offense, of course.
- Oh, none taken.

982
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:33,026
Vic, um, tell the FBI
they can have Harp,

983
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,338
but I'd prefer
to transport suspects myself.

984
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:38,508
Walter! Donna just called.

985
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:41,702
She's found another
clinic for Billy Barnes.

986
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,013
If you can get him
there within the hour.

987
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,230
[Ferg] Walt. You should go help Billy.

988
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:54,566
I can drive Harp out to the feds.

989
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,908
The landscape out here is stunning.

990
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,119
It really is.

991
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:09,873
The depth of color, the scale of it all.

992
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,710
Not to mention that John Ford sky.

993
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,778
Yep.

994
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,030
We like it here.

995
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,383
[Eddie] That's it.

996
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,742
I've made up my mind.

997
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,994
I've been threatening to take
up watercolors for years,

998
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,704
but I'm gonna do it now.

999
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,975
Get myself some nice brushes, an easel.

1000
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:32,145
What do you think?

1001
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:34,838
I think...

1002
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:38,109
having a hobby like painting

1003
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:42,489
might help pass the time in prison.

1004
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:58,046
[tires squeal]

1005
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,261
That's weird.

1006
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,436
What's going on?

1007
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,629
[laughing] Who knows?

1008
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,649
It's like the Wild West out here,
ain't it?

1009
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:22,946
My dad would <i>love</i> this.

1010
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,576
Pure Peckinpah.

1011
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,581
It's like they're cutting
you off at the pass.

1012
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:39,045
[guns cocking]

1013
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,064
[automatic gunfire]

1014
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:05,914
