a normal girl.

162
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:04,653
Has she ever
been arrested?

163
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,958
Yes, once.
Shoplifting.

164
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:11,893
But that was
wiped from her record.

165
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:13,495
Johnson: There was also
a check-forging charge.

166
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:15,397
She was on bail,
awaiting a trial,

167
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:16,898
when she disappeared.

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,435
Our daughter is...
was aimless.

169
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:22,537
She was just trying
to find herself.

170
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,207
But she would never,
ever harm another person.

171
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,876
Did she
have a boyfriend?

172
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:29,845
Teddy brown.
We didn't approve of him.

173
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:32,047
But it's impossible
that she ran off with him.

174
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:34,282
Why's that? He still
lives in Portland.

175
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:35,584
We see him
from time to time.

176
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:37,919
Usually
coming out of a bar.

177
00:09:41,691 --> 00:09:44,026
Ferg: I mean,
I went on outward bound.

178
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,061
You know,
I'm a little rusty.

179
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:51,099
But I learned survival skills,
rock climbing, orienteering.

180
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,102
Ferg, you realize that
tracking's a solitary journey?

181
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:56,004
Oh, sorry. Oh.

182
00:09:56,105 --> 00:10:00,709
Yeah,
my pod leader...

183
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:07,149
he said it was a conversation
between man and nature.

184
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,218
A conversation
that you are interrupting.

185
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:14,489
This is a toe print pointing
right toward the front door.

186
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:19,061
The girl came
from that direction.

187
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,238
No one else
has come forward

188
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,340
with information
about this woman.

189
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:36,111
How about a cash reward?
The Maces could afford it.

190
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:37,345
That's asking the parents

191
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:39,448
to put up a bounty
on their own daughter.

192
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,683
They want to find her.

193
00:10:41,784 --> 00:10:44,152
They may not
want to send her to prison.

194

Vic: I have been on the phone
with the D.M.V. All morning.

195

It's my favorite branch of the
state government. Any luck?

196

Out of the four license plates
that start with 17-78,

197
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:58,166
only one could have possibly been
in Ellis' gas station yesterday.

198
00:10:58,267 --> 00:10:59,568
It's a late-model Chrysler

199
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:02,738
leased to Newett

200

Isn't that
your husband's company?

201
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:07,275
It is, and he got us a sit-down
with the supervisor.

202
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:11,213
Pulling some strings.
Nice work, Vic.

203
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:12,447
Got to watch out
for you.

204

Tell your husband
thanks from me.

Actually,
I don't think I will.

I had to promise that you wouldn't
be involved so he'd agree to help.

209
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:34,402
We know a vehicle with the
beginnings of that plate number

210
00:11:34,504 --> 00:11:36,438
was near the scene of a homicide.
I'm... I'm sorry.

211
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:39,307
Did you say the beginnings
of the plate number?

212
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,076
We're gonna need a list

213
00:11:41,144 --> 00:11:42,477
of everyone who's driven
that car in the last three days.

214
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:45,380
Uh,
pardon me for asking,

215
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:49,317
but, uh, aren't you the sheriff
of Absaroka county?

216
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,086
That's right.

217
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:54,156
Since we happen to be standing
here in Cumberland county,

218
00:11:54,223 --> 00:11:57,459
shouldn't sheriff Wilkins
be the one asking the questions?

219
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,862
I'd feel a lot better
if he were here.

220
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:04,399
This is a very simple request,
Mr. Vaughn.

221

I'm afraid our company
privacy policy's

222
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:08,003
also very simple,
sheriff Longmire.

Any requests for personal
information on employees

224

requires a subpoena.

225

Mr. Vaughn, do you happen
to know Randy Cahill?

226
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:20,048
I can't say I know him.

227
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:23,251
Wait, isn't he the editor
of the <i>Durant Courant?</i>

228
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:24,386
That's him.
Hmm.

229
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,555
He's always bugging me
for scoops.

230
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:28,757
I bet he'd be interested to know
that your company

231
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:33,161
is stonewalling
a homicide investigation.

232
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:34,229
Huh.

233
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:36,064
So, Mr. Vaughn here
has to decide

234
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:38,700
whose privacy
is more important...

235
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:41,336
that of a single employee

236
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:44,372
or the huge corporation
that pays his salary.

237
00:12:47,577 --> 00:12:51,746
I'll take a look at those
numbers one more time.

238
00:12:51,848 --> 00:12:54,850
I used to do some work
down in South America.

239
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:57,152
I thought I'd left behind
the corruption

240
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,955
and the blackmailing
from the local police force.

241
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,193
The vehicle with those plates
is... it's a company car.

242
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:06,528
It's used by Leland Townes.

243
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:09,598
He's not really an employee,
technically.

244
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:11,333
So,
who is Leland Townes?

245
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,834
He owns this property.

246
00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:17,472
We lease his mineral rights
so we can drill here.

247
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:31,052
Henry, look at this.

248
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,688
Ferg, we are not
collecting rocks.

249
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:38,126
No, this is herderite.
Okay.

250
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:41,196
Herderite doesn't occur
naturally in Wyoming.

251
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:46,401
Is that true?
Yeah.

252
00:13:46,469 --> 00:13:50,672
Most herderite
comes from Brazil or Africa.

Leland:
I inherited the place

258
00:14:08,824 --> 00:14:10,392
about five years ago
from my dad,

259

but I'm a terrible rancher.

260
00:14:12,094 --> 00:14:13,795
The land went to hay
a few years later,

261
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,797
so I decided to
lease some of it to Newett.

262
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,799
And they promised
that they'd clean it up

263
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,301
after they were done drilling.
