1
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,800
I wish you hadn't
done that, son.

2
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,920
Please,

3
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,040
please, don't shoot!

4
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,560
# A hundred years
have come and gone

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,400
# Since 1849

6
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,760
# But the ghostly wagons
rollin' west

7
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,760
# Are ever brought to mind

8
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,120
# Their rollin', rockin',
creakin' wheels

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,160
# Were heard
from shore to shore

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,480
# And always
in the hearts of men

11
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,240
# It lives forevermore

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,400
# Rollin', rollin'

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,440
# Rollin', rollin'

14
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,520
# Rollin', rollin'

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,520
# Rollin', rollin'

16
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,720
# Wagons west are rollin'

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,360
# Out where winds are blowin'

18
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,480
# Cross rivers and plains

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,480
# Through sand
and through rain

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,920
# Rolls a mighty
wagon train... #

21
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,560
# I left my gal in West Virginny

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,800
# Fell in 'hind the wagon train

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,480
# Another I left in old Kentucky

24
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,040
# Fell in 'hind the wagon train

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,720
# I left my gal in Indiana

26
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,160
# Fell in 'hind the wagon train

27
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,520
# Another I left in ole Missouri

28
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,280
# Fell in 'hind the wagon train

29
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,080
# Oh, the white tops
are a-rollin'

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,880
# The big wheels
keep on turnin'

31
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,720
# And when I reach
that promised land

32
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,280
# For my gal,
I'll still be yearnin'... #

33
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,200
The way I figure,
Travis,

34
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,080
these ponies ought
to bring us 30 a head.

35
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,480
And 12 head at 30
comes to, er...

36
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,840
Er...320. >

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,480
360.

38
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,920
It does? Well,
that's better yet.

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,720
Divided by two...
Well, that makes it, er...

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,800
quite a tidy sum.

41
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,120
Yeah. Subtract that
20 bucks you owe me
from the tidy sum,

42
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,000
and you'll have
160 left.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,920
I will?

44
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,520
Say, that's not
bad for four
months' work.

45
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,040
Not bad at all.

46
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,880
Look anything
like them?

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,920
No.

48
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,760
Howdy, Marshal.

49
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,160
Howdy.

50
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,040
Good horse.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,720
Mighty gentle.

52
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,880
Horse trader?

53
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,360
Yep. That's my business.

54
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,280
You fellas looking
for a horse trade?

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,240
If you are,

56
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll trade you
this sorrel horse pretty cheap.

57
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,400
He's sound.

58
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,240
Straight eye,
wind and limb.

59
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
THEY NEIGH

60
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,880
Whoa, Bridesmaid.
Be gentle now.

61
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,480
Eight, nine and ten.

62
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,920
Thank you, Marshal.

63
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,760
You got yourself
a good horse for 10.

64
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Of course, he's
got his own little
peculiarities...

65
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,320
..you might say
his own little
failings.

66
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,960
Howdy, Elder.

67
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
Howdy, son.

68
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Howdy, ma'am.

69
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,000
These here your horses?

70
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,600
Yeah, they belong
to me and Sandy here.

71
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
NEIGHING

72
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,440
Whoa, be gentle.
Easy now.

73
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,960
Eh...gentle, hmm?

74
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,280
Gentle? Ask the marshal.
He can tell you.

75
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,200
What are you
figuring on

76
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
asking for them?

77
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,560
Oh...

78
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,920
50 a head.

79
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,640
50 a head!

80
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,080
Well, I'll be
dad-blasted...

81
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,560
Elder Wiggs! Please.

82
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,760
Aw, bears' claws,
Adam!

83
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,160
50 a head!
That's enough to make
the Lord his-sel...

84
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
Elder!

85
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,360
All right,
all right,

86
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,360
I repent my words
of wrath.

87
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,840
But I'll be
gol-danged

88
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,800
if I'm paying
any 50 a...

89
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
NEIGHING

90
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,960
Whoa, Buttercup.
Whoa.

91
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,520
Be gentle.

92
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,120
Where'd you boys
get these here...

93
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,240
..gentle horses?

94
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,680
Meaning exactly what?

95
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,080
Just keep your
shirt on, son.

96
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,120
Your face looks
honest to me,

97
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,280
even if it is
homely.

98
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,000
Navajo country,
mostly,

99
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,480
southwest of here.

100
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,280
Navajo, huh?

101
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
Yep.

102
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,680
Southwest.

103
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,960
Hey, you wouldn't
happen to know

104
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,840
that San Juan river
country, would you?

105
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,240
Yeah, we know it.
What about it, grandpa?

106
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,640
Look here, don't you
be "grandpa-ing" me,

107
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,040
you young
whippersnapper.

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,160
I'll pull you
off that fence

109
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,880
and tan your britches
for you...

110
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,240
Now, Elder...

111
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,160
You know,
folks around here

112
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,080
tell me
that there ain't
no through trail

113
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,520
to the San Juan.

114
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,360
Folks is right.

115
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,720
But we've been there.

116
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,960
That little buckboard's
part burro.

117
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,360
It just goes
anywhere.

118
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,640
Hmm...

119
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,560
You boys
mind telling me
if you're...

120
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,480
drinking men?

121
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,400
Nope.

122
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,800
Got a brother's
a drunkard,
though.

123
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,120
Do you ever chaw?

124
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,440
Tried it once.

125
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,680
Use the words
of wrath?

126
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
Only tolerable-well.

127
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,080
Are you family men?

128
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,760
No, sir!

129
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
NEIGHING

130
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,280
Daisy!

131
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
Well...

132
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,120
how would you boys
like to sell us

133
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,800
all these here
gentle horses of yours

134
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,240
at 50 a head

135
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,960
and maybe...

136
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,800
pick yourselves up
an extra 100 or so
on the side?

137
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,240
Doing what?

138
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,240
Wagon master,
that's what.

139
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,680
Leading our wagons
to the San Juan,

140
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,880
to a valley that...

141
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,200
that's been reserved
for us by the Lord...

142
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,280
been reserved
for his people...

143
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,200
so we can plow it

144
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,720
and seed it

145
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,760
and make it fruitful
in His eyes.

146
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
Amen.

147
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,240
Are you people
Mormons?

148
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,200
That's why
I keep my hat on
all the time,

149
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,120
so my horns
won't show.

150
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,440
Why, I got
more wives than
Solomon hisself.

151
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,000
At least that's
what folks
around here say.

152
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,400
And if they
don't say it,

153
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,920
they...
they think it.

154
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,600
We're not a big
party, son.

155
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,680
We're just a...
a handful of people

156
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,120
sent out to mark
the trail

157
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,560
and prepare
the ground

158
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,440
for those that
are going to
come after us.

159
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,880
By next summer,

160
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,600
there will be
100 families
on the move.

161
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,920
They're counting
on us

162
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,200
to have a crop
ready for them.

163
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,520
And if we don't,

164
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,800
they'll starve
sure as...

165
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,440
..shootin'.

166
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,840
That's why we got
to reach that valley

167
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
before the winter
rains come.

168
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,240
We've been praying

169
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,000
that we'd be showed
the way.

170
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,560
It might just be
that you boys

171
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,640
are the answer
to our prayer.

172
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,080
It makes you
feel noble,

173
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,400
being an answer
to a prayer, Travis.
Yeah, it does.

174
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,280
Well, the elder's
offered us a fair
price for our horses.

175
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,160
A fair price
for that crow-bait?!

176
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,560
I never saw...

177
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,760
Elder!

178
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,920
Big strip of country
between here and
the San Juan, Elder.

179
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,360
My guess is,

180
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,640
you can't make it
in a wagon.

181
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,040
Nope.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,480
Better count us out.

183
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,200
Besides,
me and my partner,

184
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,120
we's kind of figuring
on settling

185
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,520
and playing a little
high-low-jick-jack-jenny

186
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,960
and the bean gun.

187
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,720
Owe more
or claim it?

188
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,480
Claim it.

189
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,880
Gambling, huh?

190
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,160
Gambling
with cards.

191
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,280
And 100 people gambling
their lives on us.

192
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,120
Come on, Adam.

193
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,280
We've been
a-wasting our time.

194
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,080
High-low-jick-jack-jenny
and the bean gun.

195
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,160
Thank you, gentlemen.

196
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,200
What are you claiming
for low?

197
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,040
Had the trey.

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,520
I didn't see it.

199
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
The Mormons got
the fire stirring.

200
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,120
Looks like they're
pulling out.

201
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,000
As long as they're
out of town by 7.30.

202
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,400
That's their deadline.

203
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,000
Mormons,

204
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,040
Cleggses,

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
show folks,

206
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,600
horse...traders.

207
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,520
I'm in.

208
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,480
# Oh, be thanked, Lord

209
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,440
# For all you give

210
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,480
# For this day

211
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,480
# On this earth. #

212
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,480
Well, folks...

213
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,280
we're going to
have to leave

214
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,280
this hospitable
community

215
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,280
at exactly 7.30.

216
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,400
It's 7.00.
You better get a-moving.

217
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,720
Looks like we've got
a trial ahead of us.

218
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,520
But it's not
the first time.

219
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,960
We've had to go it
alone before,

220
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,400
and we'll have to
go it alone again.

221
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,720
We're tough.

222
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,680
We've had to be
tough,

223
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,080
ever since
Brother Brigham

224
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,640
led our people
across the plains.

225
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,960
Well, they survived,
and dang it...

226
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
Elder!

227
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,280
Well, we'll survive, too.

228
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,680
Now put out your fires
and get to your wagons.

229
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,760
Elder,
we'll get there

230
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,200
with the Lord's
help.

231
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,600
That's right,
Sister Ledyard.

232
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,480
But I was
kind of wishing

233
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,200
that them
young horse traders

234
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,600
would give the Lord
a hand.

235
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,000
Sister Ledyard,

236
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,920
supposing you blow
that horn again.

237
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,720
Gosh, all those
women and children.

238
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,680
Yeah, and that
red-headed gal.

239
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,760
What's going
to happen when they
reach that desert?

240
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,840
Oh, I don't know.

241
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,720
We warned them,
didn't we?

242
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,000
Lookee here, Travis,

243
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,880
50 a head is
a good price,
ain't it?

244
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,960
Yeah, but there's
a lot easier ways
to make a living.

245
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,360
# I left my gal
in old Virginny

246
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,280
# Fell in 'hind
the wagon train

247
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,800
# Another I left
in ole Missouri

248
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,000
# Fell in 'hind
the wagon train. #

249
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,560
Well, Sandy,
I'll meet you
at the river.

250
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,680
Looks like
we got a job.

251
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,720
Yes, sir!

252
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,000
Yee-hah!

253
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,680
Say, Elder!

254
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,440
Head 'em west.

255
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
West? Why?

256
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,480
The Lord didn't
provide any water

257
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,960
the way
you're heading.

258
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,040
I knowed you'd
give the Lord
a hand, son.

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,120
You owe me
450 silver dollars.

260
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Payable
at the San Juan.

261
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,440
Wagons west!

262
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,360
Wagons west!

263
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
# Wagons west

264
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,280
# Wagons west

265
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,320
# Wagons west

266
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,400
# Wagons west

267
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,520
# Wagons west

268
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,480
# Wagons west

269
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,360

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,120

282
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,440
# Are ever brought to mind

283
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,280
# Their rollin', rockin',

284
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,480
# Were heard from

# And always
in the hearts of men

286

GUITAR PLAYS

298
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,640
Hey, gosh!

299
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,280
Do I hear music?

300
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,080
It sounds like music!

301
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,160
If I'm not loco,
so do I.

302
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,960
Do you...do you suppose
it's Navajos?

303
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,960
I never heard of a Navajo
playing a guitar.

304
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,160
Come to think of it,
neither have I.

305
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,160
Miss Phyffe,
we have company.

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,840
Thank you.

307
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,560
Dr Hall...

308
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,800
Gus!

309
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
We have
an audience.

310
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,360
Horses.

311
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Ma'am, I heard
your music...

312
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,760
Got a match?

313
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,320
Yeah.

314
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,160
You might offer
a lady a drink.

315
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,240
You mean this stuff?

316
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,160
Oh...

317
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,360
Not that stuff.

318
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,200
We've been drinking that
for three days.

319
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,280
Water.

320
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,640
Just a drink of water.

321
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,840
Sandy, you idiot!

322
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,240
Don't stand
there like a fool!

323
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,160
Get the lady
some water!

324
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,960
And so,
with their water all gone,

325
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,360
Mr Peachtree here

326
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,880
poured a couple of quarts
of this lightning elixir

327
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,560
into a bucket and give it
to their mule.

328
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
Last they seen,

329
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,360
she was going over
the hill like a Kansas twister.

330
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,360
And here they've been
ever since.

331
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,800
Now, these people,

332
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,600
they have what I used to call
in my sinning days,

333
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,400
a hoochy-koochy show.

334
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Oh! Why, I do declare!

335
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,600
The question is, what are
we going to do with them?

336
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,360
Give them a team
and water to get them
to Crystal City.

337
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,400
Well, er,
Mr Peachtree here

338
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
says that the professor

339
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,560
wasn't exactly popular
in Crystal City.

340
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,160
That's where
they come from.

341
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,880
You mean they
was run out.

342
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,720
Well, they was
invited out,
like we was.

343
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,600
Anyhow, they
started out for California.

344
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,680
The poor handsome man,

345
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,880
being driven out like that
with his wife and daughter.

346
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,160
That ain't exactly
the way it is,
Sister Ledyard.

347
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Miss Denver,
the young one there,

348
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,120
she ain't
his daughter.

349
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,680
And Miss Fleuretty,

350
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,520
dang-blasted fine figure
of a woman that she is.

351
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,160
Well, she
ain't exactly...

352
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,560
That settles it.

353
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,160
Give them
what they need,

354
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,560
and let's get on.

355
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,000
I don't believe
they're up to
travelling alone.

356
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,960
Well, they will be
when they're sober.

357
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,640
We reach the California
trail in a couple days.

358
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,040
Don't think we ought
to take up

359
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,960
with their kind
of people, Elder.

360
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,360
I'm not leaving them,
and that's flat.

361
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,800
You're
hired out to us!

362
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
Hold on, both of you.

363
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,160
Just calm down.

364
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,600
I ain't so sure

365
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,520
but what the Lord
put them in our path

366
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,960
for a reason.

367
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,280
As I see it, the Lord ain't
one to waste his energy.

368
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,160
He's gone
to a lot of trouble

369
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
getting these people
into this fix.

370
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,560
If I was him,

371
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,400
I wouldn't want anybody
messing up my plans.

372
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,360
Well, putting it
that way...

373
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
All right.

374
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,760
Back to your wagons,
folks.

375
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,160
We've wasted enough time.

376
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,600
Blow your horn,
Sister Ledyard.

377
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Wagons west! Wagons west!

378
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,080
HORN BLARES

379
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,520
# I left my gal
in old Ohio

380
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,920
# Fell in 'hind
the wagon train

381
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,000
# Another I left
in old Virginny

382
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,680
# Fell in 'hind
the wagon train

383
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,280
# Oh, the white tops
are a-rollin', rollin'

384
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,000
# The big wheels
keep on turnin'

385
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,920
# And when I reach
that promised land

386
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,640
# For my gal
I'll still be yearnin'. #

387
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,200
Stock all watered?

388
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Stock's watered.

389
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,560
How far you
reckon it is?

390
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Next water?

391
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Mm-hmm.

392
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,120
Oh, 40 miles.

393
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
Well, the Lord
will provide.

394
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,120
I hope so.

395
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,440
Good morning.

396
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,360
Good morning.

397
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,360
Good morning.
How are you?

398
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,840
By golly,
I bet it's going
to be hotter than...

399
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,120
Mind your language!

400
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,360
I wasn't cussing!

401
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,160
You were going
to say hell!

402
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,920
I was going
to say Hades,

403
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,960
but hell ain't cussing.
It's geography.

404
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,480
Name of a place,

405
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,360
like you might say
Abilene or Salt Lake City.

406
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,560
Don't you go be
making remarks about
Salt Lake City.

407
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,240
Sandy! Jackson!

408
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,680
Dang-blast you!

409
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,960
Come on, here!
Stop it!

410
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,120
What's the matter
with you two?

411
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,800
Hey, Sandy!

412
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,200
You idiot, you!
What's the matter with you?

413
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,560
Ain't you got no...

414
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,680
Sister Ledyard!
Sister Ledyard!

415
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,080
Blow your horn!

416
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,680
Hyah!

417
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,720
Idiot!

418
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,160
Ain't got the sense
that God gave a goose!

419
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,760
Oh!

420
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,360
Go on, get back
to your wagons!

421
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,960
Hitch up!
Get out of here!

422
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,480
Pardon me,
ladies.

423
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,960
Excuse me,
Professor,

424
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,840
but shaving ain't
permitted here.

425
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,560
Kind of low
on water.

426
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,960
Young man,
in all my years
of trouping,

427
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,360
I've never appeared
before my audience
unshaven.

428
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,760
I don't propose
to do so now.

429
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
Sorry, sir.

430
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,360
Your apology
is accepted.

431
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,760
Get to your wagon.

432
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,960
You all right?

433
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,520
You shouldn't have
done that, ma'am.

434
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,920
I'm sorry you fell
off your horse.

435
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,280
I mean about
taking a wash
out here in the desert.

436
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,040
That water's
for our horses.

437
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,360
I tell you what...

438
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,080
I won't take
another bath

439
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,000
till you tell me to.

440
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,960
Looks like
you got yourself
an admirer, Denver.

441
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,960
That rube.

442
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,520
Feet hurt, ma'am?

443
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Nope.

444
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,680
Here, try these on.

445
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,440
Did you get these
from that red-headed gal?

446
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,160
You mean
Miss Prudence?

447
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,200
Yes, ma'am.

448
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,760
Is she your wife?

449
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,800
No, ma'am.

450
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,080
How they feel?

451
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,080
Oh...

452
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,040
..fine.

453
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,920
A little large for me,
maybe, but...fine.

454
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,720
Thanks very much, and...

455
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,640
thank your lady friend.

456
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
She ain't that
either, ma'am.

457
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,120
# Oh, oh

458
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,280
# Oh, oh, oh, oh

459
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,600
# Rollin' dust,
rollin' dust

460
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,440
# Rollin' dust

461
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,680
# We ride along
the fading trails

462
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,880
# Of long, long ago

463
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,520
# And sparks
of hoofbeats glitter

464
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,400
# In the shadows
as they go

465
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,320
# Out across
the backlands

466
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,720
# Where the dust
has laid so long

467
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,240
# You see them lopin'
through the night

468
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,720
# And hear
their riding song

469
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,360
# Oh, oh

470
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,360
# Rollin' dust,
rollin' dust

471
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
# Rollin' dust,
rollin'... #

472
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,760
Water!

473
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,040
Water!

474
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,160
River yonder!

475
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,160
River yonder!

476
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,280
Better pull them up.

477
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,640
Hold your horses!

478
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,080
Hold your
horses, men!

479
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,400
Hold your horses!

480
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,000
Hold them horses!

481
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,320
Why, you
dang-blasted idiots!

482
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,320
Hold them horses!

483
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,320
Hold them horses!

484
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,280
Thank you kindly,
Brother.

485
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,280
You're welcome.

486
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Whoo!

487
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,680
Whoo-hoo!

488
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,440
Hurry up, fellas!

489
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,720
Have I your permission
to take a bath now?

490
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,120
Why, yes, ma'am,
I reckon you...

491
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,600
Thank you.

492
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Hey, ma'am!
I think I'll join you!

493
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,840
Fine!

494
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
Yee-haw!

495
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,960
Yeow!

496
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,880
Ya-hoo-ha!

Yay!

00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,280
Whoo!

501
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,080
Well, let's see now...

502
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,880
Say, Adam,

503
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,320
if you fellas
will play that
Chuckawalla Swing,

504
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,360
I think I can get
a Texas Star Square
going.

505
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,120
Let's give her a whirl.

506
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,560
How's it go?

507
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,320

Wouldn't you ladies
like to join us
in the dancing?

514
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,280
I haven't
danced in...

515
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,160
When was it, Gus?

516
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,480
I wouldn't remember.

517
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,680
Well, it's about time
you did, ma'am.

518
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,960
May I have
the pleasure, ma'am?

519
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,520
Why not?

520
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,720
May I have
the pleasure, ma'am?

522
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,720
Honour your partner.

523
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,000
Corners, all.

524
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,240
Honour that gal
across the hall.

525
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,080
All join hands
and circle south.

526
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,680
Put a little sunshine
in your mouth.

527
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,800
Please sashay
to your corner, all.

528
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,680
Ladies in the lead,
and the gents hang on.

529
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,880
Now you break,
and now you swing.

530
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,080
Swing, swing,
everybody swing.

531
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,400
Gents to the centre
and back to the bar.

532
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,920
Ladies to the centre
and form a star

533
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,520
with a right hand prom.

534

# Way out west, there's
a dance a-bein' done

< Yee-hoo-hoo!

563
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,760
< Yahoo!

564
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,600
Evening.

565
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,440
Me and the boys
seen your fire.

566
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,360
Scared at first
you might be Navajo.

567
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,760
Then I heard
your mountain music.

568
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,200
Said to Floyd here,

569
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,000
"wherever there's
singing and dancing,

570
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,480
"you can be sure
there's Christian folks."

571
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,280
Never did know
a bad man

572
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,720
that had
any music in him.

573
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,440
Thought maybe you might
help out some strangers

574
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,360
down on their luck.

575
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,520
Maybe stake us
for a feed.

576
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,760
You're welcome to share
what little we have.

577
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,160
That's neighbourly,
mister.

578
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,080
Real neighbourly.

579
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,280
Did you hear that,
boys?

580
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,080
These good
God-fearing folks

581
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,880
is bidding us
welcome.

582
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,920
Brother Boulton,
help Brother Jackson
with their stock.

583
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
We-uns has been
out hunting

584
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,280
but had nothing
but hard scrabble.

585
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,120
Our pack horses stompeded
with all our grub,

586
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,000
and I fell
and bust my shoulder.

587
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,880
Sister Ledyard,
fix these men
some food.

588
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,720
Thank you, Floyd.

589
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,200
Thank you, Jesse.

590
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,520
Shoulder's
been hurting bad.

591
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,440
Can't hardly sit
my horse no more.

592
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,240
You know who they are,
don't you?

593
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,880
Yep.
I reckon I do.

594
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,480
We've been celebrating
the crossing of the desert

595
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,280
and getting
to the water,

596
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,960
so we're just
going to turn in.

597
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,720
When you folks
finish eating,

598
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,120
if you'll just
stack your plates
up there,

599
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,560
we'll be a-seeing you.

600
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,920
Bless you, Brother.

601
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,840
Don't you worry
about us.

602
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,440
We'll just sit and
enjoy your fire a spell.

603
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,360
Uncle Shiloh.

604
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,240
They're the only ones
toting guns.

605
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,440
You boys ever
draw on anybody?

606
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,400
No, sir.

607
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,080
Just snakes.

608
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,160
SISTER LEDYARD LAUGHS

609
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Turn my eggs over,
sister,

610
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,680
and put some
hot sauce

611
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,080
and chili pepper
on them, please.

612
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,400
What's them words
on your wagon say?

613
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,920
Read them for yourself.

614
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,200
I don't read so good.

615
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Tell me.

616
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,920
It says,
"Doctor A Locksley Hall,

617
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,600
"kickapoo snake oil

618
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,360
"and lightning elixir."

619
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,120
And in the smaller
letters,

620
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,200
"teeth pulled

621
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,800
"and hair restored."

622
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,640
Uncle Shiloh!

623
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,360
Look here what I found!

624
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,000
A doctor!

625
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,920
A doctor.

626
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,800
Well, now, that's
real providential.

627
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,600
Be obliged if you'd
look at my shoulder, doc.

628
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,680
Well, I...

629
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,120
I'm not certain, sir.

630
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,040
Said you was
a doctor.

631
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,440
A doctor, yes,
but I...

632
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,200
I'm not exactly
qualified.

633
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,800
Are you lying?

634
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,000
I hate liars.

635
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,800
My boys would
just as soon shoot a liar

636
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,240
as look at him.

637
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,720
If you're a doc,
you'll fix my shoulder.

638
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,320
If you're lying...

639
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,120
That's a bullet hole.

640
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,560
You've been wounded.

641
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
That's right.

642
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,160
That chunk of lead
is still in there.

643
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,760
Get it out.

644
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,080
Yes, sir. It's
real providential.

645
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,520
They got grub,
water,

646
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,400
and a doc
to tend my arm.

647
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,480
And a golden bed
for me to rest up in.

648
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,040
Supposing that marshal
catches up with us?

649
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Then what?

650
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,680
Ain't likely any posse
will look for us

651
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,520
in a mormon wagon train,
now, is it?

652
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,840

657
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,720
Good morning.

658
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,520
I brought you
some water, ma'am.

659
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,480
Thank you.

660
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,800
Won't you stop
and have a bite
of breakfast with us?

661
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,200
Yes, ma'am!

662
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,640
Sandy, let's go.

663
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,840
Uncle Shiloh.

664
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,320
Mr Cleggs,

665
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,560
are you ready?

666
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,920
Yes, sir. Now don't you fret
about me, Brother Wiggs.

667
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,960
I don't intend to.

668
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,640
I expect your people
to go easy
on our food,

669
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,720
obey orders,

670
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,560
mind your language,
and keep
your distance.

671
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,480
We Cleggs ain't used to
being spoke to thataway.

672
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,920
You shut up, Luke.

673
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,800
Elder here has been
right kind to us'n,

674
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,720
so you mind
your manners.

675
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,720
He ain't quite bright.

676
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,600
When you get
your strength back,

677
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,640
you go it
on your own.

678
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,080
Is that understood?

679
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,280
The lord will bless you
for this, Brother.

680
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,120
He marks
the sparrow's fall.

681
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,120
Hitch up,
Sister Crenley!

682
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,160
We're moving,
Brother Fitzsimmons!

683
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,600
Moving out,
Brother Hightower.

684
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,760
Get ready.

685
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,080
That wasn't very
healthy, Elder.

686
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,520
You afraid of them?

687
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,520
Yeah. I am.

688
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,920
What about you, Son?

689
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,360
Who, me? Huh.

690
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,960
That makes
three of us.

691
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,360
But I'm not letting
the Cleggses know it,

692
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,200
and I'm not letting
my people know it
either.

693
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,600
We're still headed
for the San Juan.

694
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,840
I want us all
to get there.

695
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,440
Your haul,
wagon master.

696
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,560
Lead out!

697
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,040
Wagons west!

698
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,520
Let's go again, everybody!
Heading out!

699
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,440
You dang-blasted idiot,
can't you stand up?

700
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,640
What's the matter?

701
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,560
Oh, you tarnation,
consarned, no-good
idiot.

702
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,960
Elder,
watch your language.

703
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,160
Watch, my foot.
I never saw such a...

704
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,120
Quicksand.
He couldn't help it.

705
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,040
Quicksand?

706
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,440
Oh.

707
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,200
I guess we'll
have to find

708
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,160
a new trail
out of here.

709
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,760
Yeah.

710
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,520
Hold your train!

711
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,280
Hold your train!

712
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,480
Sorry, horse.

713
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,440
Whoa.

00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,960
Come on, now.

719
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,360
Get up there.

720
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,600

00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,640
To tell you the truth,
Sandy, I'm lost.

725
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,560
We passed
through here once.

726
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,880
Remember?

727
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,280
You said that tower
over there

728
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,600
looked like a cathedral
back in Santa Fe.

729
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,240
Yeah, could be.

730
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,680
You bring up
the wagon train.

731
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,600
I'll look it over
a little closer.

732
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,000
All right, Travis.

733
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,200

734
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,320

We got troubles enough.

739
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,960
Never did kill
myself a Navajo.

740
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,320
Ha ha ha ha.

741
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,200
Pull them up,

742

Just enough

he don't seem

Mormons

769
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,280

It's not my music.

As the rule,

00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,120
They ain't whipping
no Cleggses.

820
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,000
Whipping's better
than scalping.

821
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,400
Ain't going to be
no scalping.

822
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,280
How you going to
stop it, Uncle Shiloh?

823
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,800
Aah!

824
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,440
Brother Jackson.

825
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,320
WHIP CRACKS >

826
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,520
Straight ahead,
Mr Peachtree.

827
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,440
This is where
you leave us.

828
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,080
Whoa.

829
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:59,880
Well, Professor,
here's where
we leave you.

830
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,880
About this team
and the outfit,

831
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,120
I'm not asking payment.

832
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,080
We've got a small colony
in San Bernardino.

833
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,480
Make a contribution
as you pass through.

834
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,880
We'll do that, Elder.

835
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,280
I'm sure you will.

836
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,480
Thank you.

837
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,720
Elder, on behalf of myself,
Miss Phyffe, Miss Denver,

838
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,480
and the entire company,

839
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,800
I should like to take
this opportunity...

840
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,240
It's all right,
Professor.

841
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,200
Good luck.

842
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,160
Thank you.

843
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,840
Good luck,
Miss Fleuretty,
Miss Denver.

844
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,840
Mr Peachtree,
carry on.

845
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,000
Giddyup.

846
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,120
Hey, Sandy.

847
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,480
Sandy, I think
I'll go a-courting.

848
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,080
Sure hope I see you
again, Miss Denver.

849
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,000
Thanks.
Don't bank on it.

850
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,800
We move around.

851
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,240
With
a medicine show,

852
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,280
you have to
to keep healthy.

853
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,680
Move a lot
trading horses, too.

854
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,160
Good thing,
you get to know
a lot of country,

855
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,040
like a valley
I got in mind.

856
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,360
A man could make
a nice cattle ranch
in that valley...

857
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,080
if he didn't mind
being lonesome...

858
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,960
and had someone
to kind of help him

859
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,520
with the cooking
and such.

860
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,080
Goodbye, fella.

861
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,880
Whoa!

862
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,880
Uncle Shiloh wants
you folks back in camp.

863
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,240
Come on.

864
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,960
Let's get a-going.

865
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,600
Whoa!

866
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,280
Let's get a-going.

867
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,160
I'm telling you for
the last time, Elder,

868
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:27,080
if there's any trouble,
I just got to kill you.

869
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,920
Now, where's
that wagon master

870
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,560
and that
carrot-headed kid?

871
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,200
Come on down here
in front.

872
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,600
Uncle Shiloh,
they're toting guns.

873
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,720
Drop 'em.

874
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,760
Whoa!

875
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,200
Welcome back.

876
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,600
How was California?

877
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,480
It pains me, doc,
to spoil your trip,

878
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,880
but I couldn't rest
thinking of you

879
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,320
traipsing
around the country.

880
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,240
No telling
what you might run into -

881
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,400
Indians, varmints,
or maybe even a posse.

882
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,280
That'd be bad,
wouldn't it?

883
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,000
Real bad.

884
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,440
I assure you, sir...

885
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,520
Get over there
with the rest of them.

886
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,320
Floyd!

887
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,840
Evening.

888
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,320
You can put your hands
down now, folks.

889
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,880
Professor, so it was
like I was saying,

890
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,200
we'll stay together until
we reach the San Juan river.

891
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,680
One big, happy family

892
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:35,760
with your old Uncle Shiloh
at the head of it.

893
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,600
If you're heading
for the Arizona border,

894
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,000
there's lots better
trails to take.

895
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,800
If a man
knowed the country.

896
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,280
But we don't.

897
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,680
We'll string along
with you folks

898
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,560
so we can
keep an eye on you.

899
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,400
There won't
be any trouble,
will there, Elder?

900
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:57,200
No, reckon there won't.

901
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,600
Wagons west! Get rolling!

902
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,560
Get in your wagons there!

903
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,040
All right, get it
off your chest.

904
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I got nothing to say.

905
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,400
We're hired as
wagon masters,
not gunfighters.

906
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,800
I never claimed
to be a gunfighter.

907
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,560
I'd have taken
my chances.

908
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,000
I know you would.

909
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,360
I ain't risking 60 lives
on a fool play.

910
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,320
60?

911
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,720
What if we'd got
ourselves killed?

912
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,160
They'd starve
to death

913
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,200
trying to get over
these mountains

914
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,680
or die of thirst

915
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,000
trying to get back
to Crystal City.

916
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,840
No. Without us,
they haven't got
a chance.

917
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,760
What happens when we
reach the San Juan?

918
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:53,120
Think the Cleggses will tip
their hats and ride away?

919
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,000
We'll handle that
when we come to it.

920
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:56,960
Yeah.

921
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,880
Want a drink of lightning
liquor, Elder?

922
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,200
GLASS BREAKS

923
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,520
That mormon train
sure come quite
a piece, hasn't it?

924
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,600
Don't suppose they've
seen the Cleggses.

925
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,480
Won't hurt none to ask.

926
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,400
Fill up our canteens
anyway.

927
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,640
Whoa. Whoa!

928
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,640
Wagons, ho!

929
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,120
I'm giving the orders
around here, Elder.

930
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,040
You going
to give the orders

931
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,960
to that sheriff's
posse, too?

932
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,080
Sheriff's posse,
Uncle Shiloh.

933
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,440
Jesse, get in here
with me.

934
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,440
Reese, take
the Perkins' wagon.

935
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,920
Floyd!

936
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,280
You ride with the doc
and them show folk.

937
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,680
You all heard what
Uncle Shiloh said.

938
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,360
Just you be quiet.
Don't say nothing.

939
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,680
Elder, one wrong move
out of anyone,

940
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,200
we start shooting.

941
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,320
Howdy, Elder.

942
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,400
Howdy, Marshal.

943
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,320
Didn't think
you'd make it.

944
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,840
Oh, we've been
moving right along.

945
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,800
Well, we're still
hunting them Cleggses.

946
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,200
Don't suppose
you've seen them.

947
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:17,240
Well, now, don't seem
hardly likely, does it?

948
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,080
Nope.
Had to ask though.

949
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,760
Happen you see them,

950
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,200
get word to me.

951
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,080
We're camped
down by the old
California cutoff.

952
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,600
They ain't going
to slip past us.

953
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,480
How about
the bacon,
Marshal?

954
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,880
Oh. We're running
low on grub.

955
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,480
Don't suppose you have
an extra side of bacon?

956
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,600
Well, uh...

957
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,920
yeah, I reckon so.

958
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,240
Help yourself.

959
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,680
Thank you, Elder.

960
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,240
I'll get it for you.

961
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,160
Know just where it is.

962
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,160
Thank you.

963
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,560
Round of bacon's
in the second barrel, Elder?

964
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,960
That's right, son.

965
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,560
Here you are, partner.

966
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,000
Ah, thank you.

967
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,440
Think nothing of it.

968
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,720
Marshal.

969
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,200
Howdy, Marshal.

970
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,720
Whose buckskin horse
is this?

971
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,560
Seems like I've seen him
someplace before.

972
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,520
Sure have.

973
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,920
Tried to sell him
to you once.

974
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,800
You can still have
him pretty cheap.

975
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,200
Elder,

976
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,120
you wouldn't be lying
to me, would you?

977
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:56,040
Well, now, Marshal,
I tell you,

978
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:02,480
I don't rightly think
I've told a lie to a man

979
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,680
for an awful long time,

980
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,080
and if the circumstances
were such

981
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:10,480
that a man had a gun
in my back, I...

982
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:14,880
I guess about now's
as good a time as any.

983
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,800
..tell you.

984
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,560
WHISTLE

985
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,320
Kick him, Marshal!

986
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,440
Ride that dang-blasted...

987
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,400
horse.

988
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,560
If I was you, Wiggs,

989
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,440
I'd be careful
who I took up with.

990
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,320
There's some mighty
unsavoury characters
travelling with you.

991
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,880
That's the lord's
truth, Marshal.

992
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,320
Thanks for the bacon.

993
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,040
Get going!

994
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,200
Wagons west!

995
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,240
There was
a trail there once.

996
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,120
If it ain't washed out,
we'll try it.

997
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,440
Mighty rough going, Elder.

998
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,200
Mighty rough going.

999
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:33,000
I think we can make it
a-foot or a-horseback,

1000
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,840
but my opinion
is the grain wagon
can't make it.

1001
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:40,920
That grain's
more valuable to us
than gold itself.

1002
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,840
We just
got to get...

1003
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,360
FOOTSTEPS

1004
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,240
Did I hear somebody
mention gold?

1005
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,120
Gold always
interests me.

1006
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,000
You got gold in this
wagon train, Elder?

1007
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,400
We were talking
about our seed grain,
Mr Cleggs.

1008
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,880
We're getting it across

1009
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:11,600
even if we have to
carry it over bag by bag
on our backs.

1010
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:16,920
Well, now, my boy
Reese won't be
much help to you.

1011
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,320
His back's pretty sore

1012
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,720
after that whipping
you give him.

1013
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,640
We want to talk to you
about that later.

1014
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,520
Tomorrow, maybe.

1015
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,560
When are you going
to make your play?

1016
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,640
Well, son...

1017
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,960
did you find the trail
to that promised land?

1018
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,760
The old trail's
all washed out,
Elder.

1019
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:28,120
But I think
we can make it.

1020
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,800
Sure take a lot
of digging, though.

1021
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,200
Digging? What do
you mean, digging?

1022
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,640
Oh, sort of
a dug-way.

1023
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,520
Sure a lot of
mighty pretty country
over that mountain -

1024
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,800
river, valley,
and all.

1025
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,200
You better
get yourself
some food

1026
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,840
and start
digging.

1027
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,160
Well, Elder,
when you get over

1028
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,880
in that pretty valley
he's talking about,

1029
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,720
I guess we won't
see you no more.

1030
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,920
And you won't have
no Cleggses

1031
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,840
to tie to wagon wheels
and whip.

1032
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,360
Travis,
I got me a gun.

1033
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,320
Where did you
get that?

1034
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,760
From Miss Prudence.

1035
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,160
She got it from
her little brother.

1036
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,520
Here's what
I want to do
if you'll back me.

1037
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,720
What did you ever
shoot at

1038
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,840
besides tin cans
and beer bottles?

1039
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,800
Never mind.

1040
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,200
We'll take care
of them Cleggses.

1041
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,360
Careful that gun
don't go off

1042
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,280
and blow
your brains out.

1043
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,320
Now there's a sharp turn

1044
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,720
right around
that yonder point there.

1045
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,760
Are you ready,
wagon master?

1046
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,360
Ready, Elder.

1047
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,520
All right,
Brother Boulton.

1048
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,520
Hyah!
Hyah!

1049
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,320
Whoa!

1050
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,640
Brother Boulton!
Brother Boulton!

1051
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,520
THE CLEGGSES LAUGH

1052
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,400
They didn't make it,
Uncle Shiloh.

1053
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,240
Kind of dangerous,
huh, Elder?

1054
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,360
I'll take the next one
over myself.

1055
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,440
Elder Wiggs,
I demand
the privilege

1056
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,480
of taking my
wagon over next.

1057
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,920
It contains
nothing of value,

1058
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,120
including
the driver.

1059
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,040
Now, Professor...

1060
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,680
Sir, I insist.

1061
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,680
Gus... Gus!

1062
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,520
Mr Peachtree,
if you please.

1063
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,400
I'm going
with you...

1064
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,400
you big ham.

1065
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,480
Hey! Hey!

1066
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,040
Giddyup!

1067
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,360
Come on! Hyah!

1068
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,320
Giddyup!

1069
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,320
Come on!

1070
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,720
Hey! Hey!

1071
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,440
Giddyup!

1072
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,520
Hyah!

1073
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,200
Giddyup!

1074
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,800
CHEERING

1075
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,000
Giddyup! Come on!

1076
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,080
CHEERING

1077
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,880
Giddyup! Come on!

1078
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,720
CHEERING

1079
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,040
Everything's
all clear,
Brother Jackson!

1080
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,360
Fine, Elder.

1081
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,640
Ready?

1082
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,600
Ready!

1083
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,000
Climb up
and take her across.

1084
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,720
Now watch
your wheels.

1085
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,640
Keep them
in that dug-way.

1086
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,680
Give them their head
upgrade.

1087
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,160
Once started,
don't stop.

1088
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,480
Keep them going.

1089
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,440
Sandy, now...

1090
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,000
We're saying
goodbye, Elder.

1091
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,080
We're parting
company.

1092
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,920
You been real good
to us Cleggses.

1093
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:08,840
Reese, now,
he ain't likely
to forget you.

1094
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,280
None of us is.

1095
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,680
So it's only fitting

1096
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,640
that we give you
something

1097
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,080
to remember us by.

1098
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,960
That grain wagon...

1099
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:21,160
more valuable
than gold itself.

1100
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,920
You said so, Elder.

1101
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,800
Son, get down off
of there.

1102
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,200
Why? What are you
going to do?

1103
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,360
Elder, get up there.

1104
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,720
To save you
from asking why,

1105
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,160
I'm going to
tell you.

1106
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,600
You'll have
the privilege

1107
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,520
of taking that
grain wagon over,

1108
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,920
only it's going
to be at a dead run,

1109
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,800
and them wheels
won't be in no rut.

1110
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,680
Luke, go down
by that lead team.

1111
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:00,880
Reese, I'll let you
whip them up.

1112
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,560
Reese!

1113
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,480
Whoa!

1114
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,880
Hold it! Ho!

1115
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,800
Whoa! Ho!

1116
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,200
Ho!

1117
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,920
Don't shoot.

1118
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,400
Please don't shoot.

1119
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,480
My boys...

1120
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,440
you killed my boys.

1121
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,280
Good boys they was,
too.

1122
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,240
Jesse.

1123
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,040
Luke!

1124
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Ho, boy!
Ho. Easy.

1125
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,360
Luke was
my oldest boy.

1126
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,240
I thought you
never drew on a man.

1127
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,160
That's right,
sir...

1128
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,080
only on snakes.

1129
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,120
# Come, come, ye saints

1130
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,240
# No toil
nor labour fear

1131
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:10,720
# But, with joy,
wend your way

1132
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,200
# Though hard to you

1133
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,440
# This journey
may appear

1134
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:21,040
# Grace shall be
as your day

1135
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,040
# 'Tis better far
for us to strive

1136
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,840
# Our useless cares
from us to drive

1137
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:36,600
# Do this and joy
your hearts will swell... #

1138
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,160
Well, I'll be doggone.

1139
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:44,760
I'll be doggone.

1140
