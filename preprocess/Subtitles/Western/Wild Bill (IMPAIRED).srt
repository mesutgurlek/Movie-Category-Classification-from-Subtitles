They couldn't find no buffalo.

Figured since he'd failed his people

he had to go off

Can't tell you how many times in my life
I've gone bust.

155
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,990
Yes, but it's not the same for you.
You don't know what real poverty is.

156
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,113
Everybody wants to buy
the great Wild Bill dinner or drinks.

157
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,073
This pot is mine. Three kings.

158
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,193
Mr Hickok?

159
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,392
Mr Hickok, there's a man in the street
gonna give me a dollar

160
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:22,959
to come in here and tell you that
you're a coward, and a wife stealer...

161
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,516
and I can't say the rest,
but it was much worse.

162
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,790
What'd he say?

163
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,796
Bill Hickok!

164
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,593
I'm callin' you out!

165
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,430
Hickok!

166
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,314
You gonna ride or hide?
What's the matter?

167
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,797
Afraid of a cripply old man in a wheelchair
who can't even face you, are you?

168
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,593
What'd he <i>say?</i>

169
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,349
He said that you were a horse molester.

170
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,036
He say what horse?

171
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,229
What, are you hidin'?

172
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,150
The great Wild Bill Hickok
is actually inside hidin'?

173
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,230
- <i>(man)</i> What's this?
- <i>(man #2)</i> Wild Bill in a wheelchair!

174
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,836
Needless to say, Bill, all good fortune.

175
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,394
<i>I never saw a greater compliment to Bill</i>

176
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,512
<i>than that paid</i>
<i>by the citizens of Cheyenne.</i>

177
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,156
<i>Their confidence in his marksmanship</i>
<i>was such that none of them ran for cover,</i>

178
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,512
<i>but lined up as if they were watching</i>
<i>some athletic contest.</i>

179
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,831
- A whisky, please. Neat.
- You ain't gonna go out and watch this?

180
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,349
I don't think my friend needs my help.

181
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,189
I generally stay in the bar when he
gets involved with this sort of affair.

182
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,359
You just help yourself,
cos I ain't gonna miss it.

183
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,430
Here's to you, Bill.

184
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,795
<i>This dispute had begun two years before,</i>
<i>when one Ed Plummer had called Bill out.</i>

185
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,398
<i>Some said the reason</i>
<i>was a gambling debt.</i>

186
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,876
<i>Others claimed that it involved a woman.</i>

187
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,512
<i>Bill discovered that the Plummers</i>
<i>regarded the affair as a family matter.</i>

188
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,315
Argh! My leg!

189
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,754
I can't move my leg!

190
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,438
Aaargh!

191
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,872
Damn it, Will Plummer. I already shot you
once when you tried to bushwhack me.

192
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,152
You hear that? The man is accusing me.

193
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,555
Imagine that.

194
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:18,198
Have you forgotten, Mr Hickok,
that I am the aggrieved party here?

195
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,630
You must be drunk or gone crazy, Will.

196
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,514
Now, if you got any sense left,
you'll just head on home.

197
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,076
No, no. You're not gonna get off that easy.

198
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,317
You took the life from my brother.

199
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,274
And you left me a crippled old man
in a wheelchair.

200
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,709
You, sir, will die!

201
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,389
Mister, Wild Bill
just shot Will Plummer dead.

202
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,832
Then he told me to come ask you if you'd
mind to get the lead out of your ass...

203
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,839
sir... and come outside
and help untie him.

204
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,520
Will Plummer, rest in peace.

205
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,915
We owe God a death.

206
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,871
<i>Bill chose to move on to the town</i>
<i>that was the talk of the entire West.</i>

207
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,917
DEADWOOD GULCH,
DAKOTA TERRITORY, AUGUST 1876
<i>Gold had been discovered a year before.</i>

208
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,998
<i>"Get rich quick" was in the air.</i>

209
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,468
<i>From raw wilderness, suddenly up came</i>
<i>this hell-roaring place called Deadwood.</i>

210
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,636
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

211
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,159
You, uh, haul our bags
over to the tent city.

212
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,319
Tell 'em to find room
for Bill Hickok and a friend.

213
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,993
How are the eyes, Bill?
Going to be a lot of strangers in this town.

214
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,396
Ah, I can see OK straight ahead.

215
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,671
The sides are narrowin' in, and it hurts.

216
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,918
Comes and goes,
but hurts like hell when it's on you.

217
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,795
This town. I really think it's like
something out of the Bible.

218
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,789
- What part of the Bible?
- The part right before God gets angry.

219
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,911
<i>(whooping and cheering)</i>

220
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,356
<i>Deadwood was a haven</i>
<i>for cardsharps, con men,</i>

221
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,792
<i>thieves, killers, roughs, drunks,</i>
<i>pimps and whores...</i>

222
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,955
<i>along with those arbiters of disputes:</i>
<i>Whip, fist, knife and pistol.</i>

223
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,916
These two fellers must have
caused some trouble.

224
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,396
No trouble, just a couple of card cheats.

225
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,159
That's the worst kind of feller.

226
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,873
Man that cheats at cards
ain't got no religion.

227
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,353
Howdy, Jane.

228
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,471
Howdy, Bill.

229
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,593
Boys! This here is James Butler Hickok.

230
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,233
<i>(cheering and whooping)</i>

231
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,114
Everybody to the bar!
Drinks are on Bill!

232
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,235
Wild Bill. Carl Mann.

233
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,397
Pleased to meet you. This here's
my place, Mann's Number 10.

234
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,115
Make it your personal headquarters.
What kind of whisky do you favour?

235
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,598
Well, Carl, I prefer it in a glass.
Other than that, it's all good.

236
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,155
- That's the great Hickok?
- Sure as hell is.

237
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:14,230
He'll buy you a drink, shake your hand,
and you can tell your grandkids about it.

238
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,591
Charles Prince, of London, New York
and parts west, friend of Wild Bill's.

239
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,792
I know you're Calamity Jane.
He's spoken of you many times.

240
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,148
Joe!

241
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,238
Half a grand howdy, pard!

242
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,512
The whole town's crazy. Every polecat
in the territory's looking for gold.

243
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,078
They ain't even got a sheriff yet.
I figure I'll nominate you for the job.

244
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,634
- Wild Bill?
- <i>(Joe)</i> They got varmints here that...

245
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,354
What are you doing?

246
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,552
Wild Bill, I'm talkin' to you.

247
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,195
You'd better look out when
you walk down the street in this town.

248
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,677
You listen careful to every sound.
I come here to kill you.

249
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,473
He's not wearing a gun, Bill.

250
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,559
The man that kills Wild Bill
is gonna be awful famous.

251
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,636
<i>(laughter)</i>

252
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,156
You come here to kill me?
Let me give you some advice.

253
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,353
If you have to shoot a man,
you shoot him in the guts.

254
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,630
Might not kill him.

255
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,320
Sometimes they die slow.

256
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,915
But it'll paralyse his brain,
and the fight's as good as over.

257
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:46,672
Why don't you shoot the little snot?
At least rough him up some.

258
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,554
- He's just a dumb-ass kid.
- I got...

259
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,035
You son of a bitch!

260
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,989
- How you been, Bill?
- Middlin'. Just middlin'.

261
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,237
I ain't seen you in two, maybe three years.

262
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,316
Well, I'm still here.

263
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,874
- How you been?
- Well, I'm still here too.

264
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,958
Lots of towns, lots of camps.

265
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,079
Good to see you, Jane.
I like seeing old friends.

266
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,591
It's just for old times' sake.

267
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,713
- You wipin' it off?
- No. I'm rubbin' it in.

268
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,116
You can see me about as much as you
want. I guess that's always been the case.

269
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,198
I'm just a little too available.

270
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,957
I gotta be available too. Awful lot
of people want a piece of Wild Bill.

271
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,158
Let's have us a card game and a drink.

272
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,356
Outta my way, boys.

273
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,189
<i>As Bill played cards</i>
<i>and drank whisky on into the night,</i>

274
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,713
<i>Deadwood proceeded with its own</i>
<i>forced levity and bizarre behaviour.</i>

275
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,836
<i>The Dakota Dance Hall was</i>
<i>the preferred site for assignations.</i>

276
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,918
<i>This was no rude crib or flimsy shack.</i>

277
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,998
<i>It featured papered walls,</i>
<i>comfortable furniture,</i>

278
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,274
<i>polished spittoons,</i>
<i>and a piano that was actually in tune.</i>

279
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,157
You don't touch me. I saw
what you were doing. I don't like it.

280
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,952
Maybe you oughta.

281
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,355
You picked the wrong one,
cos I don't care.

282
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,756
Ow! Owww!

283
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,836
Ow! My ear!

284
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,158
Are they shakin'? My hands?

285
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,596
Are they shakin'?

286
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,188
This your first time?

287
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,438
I'm showin' you
Wild Bill don't scare me none.

288
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,836
He's right over there in the Number 10.

289
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,715
- How come you're after Wild Bill?
- I got personal reasons.

290
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,192
- What'd you say your name is, anyhow?
- Lurline.

291
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,030
Lurline Newcomb from Lawrence,
Kansas. But I been all over.

292
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,116
I bet you have.

293
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,960
I kinda like that name Lurline.

294
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,875
You were talking about Dave McCandless.

295
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,391
- You were sayin' of McCandless, Bill?
- He wasn't sayin' a goddamn thing.

296
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,798
You keep nosin' that around along with
Dave Tutt and how he took Bill's watch,

297
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,037
and them soldiers beat him
half to death in Hays City.

298
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,312
- I heard you killed seven men, Bill.
- He didn't have no reputation before that.

299
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,910
He just drove freight wagons.
It happened at Rock Creek Station.

300
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,830
Bill was taken with a woman kept by
the outlaw and horse thief McCandless.

301
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,473
Her name was Sarah.

302
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,515
McCandless and his bunch, ten men in all,
rode up lookin' to settle things.

303
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,078
Inside the station, Bill seen an old buffalo
gun. He wasn't sure it would shoot.

304
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,475
McCandless yelled
"We know you're in there,

305
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,196
and you've breathed your last breath
for messin' with my girl!"

306
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,953
Wild Bill was shot and cut bad
when they laid on him,

307
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,038
but he met 'em shootin', stabbin',
shoutin', hackin'.

308
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,835
He kicked and bit and kneed 'em down
till the air was blue with smoke

309
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,871
and the floor was wet with blood.

310
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,758
Ten men lay dead or dyin', and his boots
was fillin' with the blood of 16 wounds.

311
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,908
He thanked God and walked out into
the blindin' light before he fell over,

312
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,477
and that all happened July 12, 1861.
You can look it up.

313
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,114
I think it was maybe five killed.

314
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,789
- Are you all right, Bill?
- I'm fine, Charley.

315
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,473
I just need me some night air.

316
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,550
- Now, what set him off?
- Five men, Bill?

317
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,518
Well, hell, I thought it was seven!

318
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,920
The young kid stole a horse,

319
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,830
somebody said the Chinaman
looked the wrong way at a white woman,

320
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,478
and the Indian was in town tradin'
when we got the word about Custer.

321
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,637
We're gonna hang them all on Saturday.

322
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,949
<i>In the Chinese section of Deadwood,</i>

323
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,995
<i>there was generally available</i>
<i>a remedy for the restless spirit.</i>

324
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,556
<i>Bill was susceptible to its application.</i>

325
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,996
<i>(in Chinese)</i> Take it.
Afterwards, you'll have good dreams.

326
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,358
It will take you to a special place.

327
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,078
Dog soldiers. Cheyenne.

328
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,156
<i>(speaks Cheyenne)</i>

329
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,075
He said you saw a little dog. Um...
Can't make much sense out of it.

330
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,760
They followed your tracks.

331
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,677
Did the little dog speak to you?
The little dog's special medicine, sacred.

332
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,360
No! It's mine!

333
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,835
I'll kill you!

334
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,428
Argh! God!

335
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,395
Tell them I spoke to the little dog.

336
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,431
<i>(speaks Cheyenne)</i>

337
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,673
Tell them the little dog took me
to a holy place, then it disappeared.

338
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,756
<i>(Joe speaks Cheyenne)</i>

339
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,199
Then we went to the other world.

340
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,316
Tell them the little dog told me
that I was blessed. I'd live a long life.

341
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,196
<i>(speaks Cheyenne)</i>

342
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,955
Says you're a damn fine liar.

343
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,228
Says you saved yourself
and your friends for today.

344
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,957
But if he catches you killin' any buffalo
or takin' hides, the Cheyenne'll kill you.

345
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,712
What'd he tell you, Joe?

346
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,628
He said the next time
you saw the little dog,

347
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,911
you wouldn't live to see another moon.

348
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,036
<i>(footsteps)</i>

349
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,800
You OK, Bill?

350
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,354
I'm fine. No need to worry.

351
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,836
I damn well did get all concerned.

352
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,191
Nobody knew where you'd got to.

353
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,392
Had a hell of a time
findin' where you'd been.

354
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,910
Maybe I drank a little too much last night.

355
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,428
Had me some dreams.

356
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,552
Had too much on that Chinese pipe.

357
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,240
You're lookin' mighty peaked.

358
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,708
You wanna tell me
what you was dreamin' about?

359
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,109
About me and California Joe.

360
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,637
Things we did
when we come across some Indians

361
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,558
on a buffalo hunt six, seven years back.

362
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,875
What things? Bad things?

363
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,471
You know, they say sometimes
a dream might be a foretellin'.

364
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,797
Wasn't just a dream, it was a fact.
Gimme some room, Jane.

365
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,275
I gotta clear my head.

366
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,434
You ain't the same, Bill.

367
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,154
- How's that?
- I don't know.

368
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,273
You just... got kinda
different from before is all.

369
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,914
Maybe. I don't know.

370
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,998
You got a bathhouse in this town?

371
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,475
Sure could use one.

372
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,838
Howdy.

373
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,078
- What you doin' here?
- Maybe I'm just bein' friendly.

374
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,557
It ain't that I don't appreciate it.
I just got a lot of things to do today.

375
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,956
- What things?
- Weigh up my methods.

376
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,594
I'm gonna stir up old Wild Bill.

377
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,271
You'd better listen to me, because I know
where your Mr Wild Bill was last night.

378
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,517
One of them Chinese girls
told an upstairs girl that told me

379
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,030
that he went down to Song Lew's
and had himself a pipe.

380
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,755
You tell your friend, next time
he goes in there, tell me about it.

381
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,236
I'll make it worth her while. Yours, too.

382
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,718
You know, you can move all your plunder
into my room if you want.

383
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,673
It's the first room at the top of the stairs.

384
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,429
Maybe I'd better stay on
out at the tent city.

385
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,555
What's the problem?

386
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,796
No problem.

387
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,071
I think it just might be best if I stay out...

388
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,953
You got yourself some new gal?

389
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,955
I just ain't in the mood.

390
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,756
Well, you must have
got yourself some new gal.

391
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,509
You know, I don't ever remember askin'
to be the only thing in your life,

392
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,756
or you in mine, for that matter.

393
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,839
But what we had was kinda special,
and I don't see why we can't have it now,

394
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,909
so I would just like some kind of goddamn
explanation. You owe me that much.

395
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,272
I don't owe nobody nothin'.
I don't explain myself.

396
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,232
Not to you, not to some punk-ass kid!

397
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,316
Not to nobody!

398
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,589
Now, just run along and leave me be.

399
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,358
Sure thing.

400
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,313
And to hell with you, Mr Wild Bill!

401
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,153
<i>In truth, Bill felt some remorse</i>
<i>for his argument with Jane.</i>

402
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,196
<i>But it was the nature of their friendship</i>
<i>that feelings for one another go unstated.</i>

403
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,515
<i>Typical for a man of action,</i>

404
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:40,191
<i>Bill found romance</i>
<i>the most perplexing aspect of his life.</i>

405
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,551
Bill! Look what I got! This damn kid!

406
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,031
People said bring him. I bringed him!

407
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,912
<i>(laughter)</i>

408
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:03,309
Well, look what we got here. I'd stick
him in the manure bin if I was you, Joe.

409
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,635
Take him around back and shoot him.

410
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,911
He's makin' all kinds of trouble, Bill.
Skunk stuff, all of it.

411
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,237
Insulted some ladies,
broke some china over to the store.

412
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,591
He even claims that you told him to do it!

413
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,034
Here. You see to the damage.

414
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,276
- What name do you go by?
- Jack McCall.

415
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,234
Joe, cut his ropes.

416
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,911
Hear you been misbehavin', Jack.
What's the problem between me and you?

417
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,077
I don't like the way you treated my ma.

418
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,192
How you done whatever then you left her.

419
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,235
She kept track of you. She had lots
of stories from newspapers, dime novels.

420
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,148
I told her she should write you.
She said you wouldn't answer no letter.

421
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,555
- Who was she?
- A decent lady.

422
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,912
Miss Susannah Moore.

423
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,596
Greetings, Jack.

424
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,553
Charles Prince, friend of Bill's.

425
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,356
Could be that Wild Bill's made
a few mistakes over the years, but...

426
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,871
Well, it's understandable. But past is past.

427
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,275
Shut up, Charley.

428
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,991
Yeah, shut up, Charley.

429
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,508
I planned killin' you
from the time I found out

430
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,031
the man that ruined my ma
was a great hero to the country.

431
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,911
I'm gonna give you a chance in life, Jack.

432
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,875
I don't wanna kill nobody
so young and confused about things.

433
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,233
Joe, get him a horse, would you?
Put him on it and point him east.

434
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:50,310
East is where fellers like him oughta live,
but my recommendation is still to kill him.

435
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,191
I liked your ma. She was
a good, fine woman. Awful pretty.

436
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,758
This here's been
a real pleasure, Mr Hickok.

437
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,431
Not a word to your mother.
I don't wanna cause her no trouble.

438
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,233
She's dead six months.

439
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,318
I've been on your trail ever since.

440
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,916
<i>(thunderclap)</i>

441
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,431
It's gonna take some stitches.
That's what you get for actin' ornery.

442
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,680
Everybody in town's heard how the great
Wild Bill knocked you around. Hold still.

443
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,270
Now, you just don't worry about it none.

444
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,960
I accomplished my purposes.

445
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,758
<i>The rumour of Jack McCall's purpose</i>
<i>had spread through Deadwood.</i>

446

<i>The circumstances called for a killing.</i>

447

<i>There would be no shortage of killers</i>

- Whatever it is, I ain't interested.
- I'm Donnie. Donnie Lonigan.

450
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,795
I figure you and me
got things to talk about.

451
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,074
- That right? Where you from, Donnie?
- New York. Came here to find the gold.

452
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,954
- Had a bad run of luck.
- Who's your friend?

453
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,117
Jubal Pickett. Pleased to meet you.

454
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,716
I say just throw 'em out, Jack.
They just look to be street trash.

455
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,750
A five-dollar whore's
gonna tell me about street trash?

456
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,836
Oh, now.

457
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,396
Donnie, let's be polite.

458
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,273
How can I help you fellers?

459
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,960
We heard you're gonna be
paying to kill a man.

460
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,036
You hears wrong.

461
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,998
You gonna do it by yourself, Jack?

462
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,076
All alone?

463
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,798
I doubt you ever even shot a feller.

464
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,709
Bill Hickok. He'd be
at least a thousand dollars.

465
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,990
He's a two-gun plainsman.

466
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:30,035
And in addition, he carries a derringer
in his vest pocket as a hide-out.

467
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,075
He's killed at least 20 people. That's
not countin' what he done in the war.

468
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:41,196
I got three more fellers that work for me.
They like to take chances for money.

469
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:46,155
Well, I ain't there yet, Donnie,
but you boys stay in touch.

470
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,595
Well, hallelujah. Let's lift up our hands
tonight and praise the Lord. Hallelujah!

471
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,874
Hallelujah! How I love the Lord!
I love him, because he is able!

472
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,074
I love him, because he reached down and
he pulled me right from the gutters of sin!

473
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,877
I love him, because when sin and
sickness had me bound, he reached out.

474
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,959
He washed me in his precious blood.

475
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:27,428
Oh, hallelujah. And I am here to testify
tonight that it is my determination!

476
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:32,236
I will hold on! I will hold on
to the rock that is my salvation!

477
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,749
I will hold on to the word of God!

478
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,317
I will hold on to him!
Oh, yes, Satan, you can't touch me now!

479
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,591
Come on, you dirty devil!
I said you can't touch me now!

480
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,837
Oh, hallelujah.
Lift up your hands. Praise the Lord.

481
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,520
Hallelujah. Praise him.

482
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,029
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.

483
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,994
Thank you, Jesus.

484
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,873
Amen. Thank you, Jesus.

485
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,956
Thank you, Jesus.

486
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,272
- Who's that feller?
- Yankee. Name of Bill Hickok.

487
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,837
He's awful dashin', ain't he? They say
he was spyin' around here during the war.

488
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,430
- He's lookin' at you.
- Look all he wants, won't do no good.

489
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,596
I bet he comes over
and asks you to dance.

490
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,315
- I won't dance with no Yankee.
- I thought you was a loyal Union woman.

491
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,795
I am. My dead husband wasn't.

492
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:45,472
He'd be rollin' in his grave
if I was dancin' with some Yankee feller.

493
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,676
I knew it. Here he comes.

494
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:01,750
It ain't gonna do no good. I didn't come
here to meet up with Yankee strangers.

495
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,399
You look like the prettiest girl around.
I was wonderin' if you wanna dance.

496
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,272
Surely.

497
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,795
You comin' with me?

498
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,155
I just think you're lyin'.

499
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,319
I ain't lyin'. I'll take you
on up to Springfield.

500
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,114
You had your way,
and you want to again, and you'll...

501
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,109
I'll take you on up to Springfield,
and that kid of yours, too.

502
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:13,190
I bet you have your way with lots of girls.
Bet you tell 'em all a whole pack of lies.

503
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,829
I ain't lyin'.

504
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,317
But I would if I couldn't figure
no other way with you.

505
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,069
<i>(in Chinese)</i> He has had two pipes.

506

He is a famous man.

507
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:17,316
I know. He has killed many.
He has had many fights.

508
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,791
Howdy, Bill.

509
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,799
- Dave.
- What brings you back to these parts?

510
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,629
I spent the last six months scoutin'
for the army. Figured I'd come back here,

511
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,593
see the sights, see my old friends.

512
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,598
I hope you ain't figurin' on startin'
back up with Miss Susannah Moore.

513
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,838
Got tired of waitin' on you,
took up with somebody else.

514
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,394
Who'd that be, Dave?

515
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,875
That'd be me, Bill.

516
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,150
She took up with me.

517
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,555
Be seein' you around.

518

<i>(tinkly tune)</i>

519
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,431
- Dave?
- Hm?

520
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,994
Where'd you get that watch?

521
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,590
Goddammit, how many times I told you
to stop botherin' me about things?

522
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,395
I recognise it. It's Bill's, ain't it?

523
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,757
His daddy gave him this watch.

524
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,235
You sure never took it off him.

525
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,478
Yeah? Well, I never said
I did that neither, did I?

526
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,875
Then how'd you get it?

527
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,036
Card game last night.

528
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,995
You walk around town wearin' this watch,
he'll kill you.

529
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,070
Say, pard.

530
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,033
You seen old Dave Tutt today?

531
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,436
I sure have.
He's right over across the way.

532
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,518
Tell me, friend, is he wearing my watch?

533
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,632
I really couldn't say.

534
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,912
Well...

535
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,431
By God, Bill, I'm glad to see
you could make it out today.

536
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,229
You know, this ain't about
no timepiece, Bill.

537
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,316
You know it...

538
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,150
and I know it.

539
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,716
He called it.

540
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,431
Whole damn thing didn't have to happen.

541
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,872
I come here for Wild Bill.
I don't want nobody interferin' none.

<i>(speaks angrily in Chinese)</i>

Make your move, Jack.

547
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,630
We'll both go.

Hm! <i>(speaks Chinese)</i>

<i>(bell tolling)</i>

550
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,236
<i>(Jack)</i>
I've been thinkin' about you, Donnie.

551
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,876
I've been thinkin' a man has to seize
his opportunities where he finds them.

552
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,754
I tried last night,
but I fell short of my mark.

553
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,595
Now, you're a lot rougher feller than I am,
ain't you, Donnie?

554
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,951
You and your boys here are real capable.

555
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:28,559
And you've found your greatest
opportunity right here in Deadwood.

556
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,558
The most famous gunfighter
in all the world.

557
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,797
- He's gettin' old.
- He is for a fact.

558
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:40,517
But, uh, the sight of him in the street,
well, it could make a young feller shake.

559
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,519
He don't make me shake.
How much money are we talkin'?

560
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,791
You called it before, Donnie. $1,000.

Here she is.

562

$250 now, $250 when we meet tonight,
the other half when it's done.

00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,715

I don't know.

too much, or... <i>(chuckles)</i>

...maybe I ain't got the nerve.

Tie the knot right there, would you? A bow
knot or something that'll slip real easy.

Come tonight, I either
see him dead and be on the run...

tell them to have a horse ready?

You stayed?

602
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,996
Maybe I was worried about you, Bill.

603
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,076
Ain't damn likely.

604
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:47,711
Joe and Charley hung around too.
Nobody knew where you'd been holed up.

605
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:53,790
If you're lookin' for them,
they're upstairs sleepin' in the flop room.

606
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,238
Had me another bad dream
on the Chinese pipe.

607
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,990
- Things are comin' back to haunt me.
- I figured it was somethin' like that.

608
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,908
You got to stay away from that stuff.
Stick with whisky.

609
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,794
Go on, now. Drink that.
It's real good for you.

610
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,308
Mmm. Good, right?

611
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,476
Yeah. Thanks.

We're gonna ride out past the Number 10
down to Jensen's barn.

615

I don't want anybody suspicious
of our horses out front.

616
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,630
- You OK, Jack?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

617
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:48,196
Been waitin' for this for a real long time.

618

<i>He had found</i>

619

Must be his ma.

624
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,595
She was one hell of a damn fine woman.

01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,759
She could talk good, drink,
tear off a piece...

626
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,239
I had a lot of good times
with Miss Susannah Moore.

627
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,552
I'd like us to be in love
like you and Susannah Moore.

628
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:00,200
She was the one, wasn't she?

629
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,880
The one you loved most of all.

630
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,111
That's why this kid's got a hold to you.

631
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,355
She was young and pretty,

632
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,229
and it was before
you was the great Wild Bill.

633
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:22,831
And you loved her
as close as you ever did anybody,

634
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,315
in an innocent kinda way.

Ain't that right?

636
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,032
Yeah, I suppose.

I'd like you to feel about me.

639
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,475
Ain't it a sweet thought?

640
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:50,999
I think it's a very sweet and fine thought.

641
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,716
Didn't ever come real good till I met you.

642
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:10,838
- Now, why do you think that is?
- I don't know precisely.

643
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,475
I always reckoned I knew you
better than them others.

You've been around lots.

This pain in my eyes,
that's all I think about.

646
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,992
It comes and goes.
Your little... charm, it distracts me.

647
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:35,471
You and me, we had our time
in Cheyenne, didn't we? Hm?

648
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,149
We had something
kinda special for a while.

649
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,159
Yeah. Listen to us,
talking about our pleasures.

Mm. As if they mattered a damn.

651
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:50,597
All this love talk, I got me a hard-on.
You wanna see?

652
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,472
Surely.

653
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,669
You know, I'm just an ordinary fellow.

654
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,839
I don't want nobody thinkin' more
than that. It's all a bother to me.

655
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,158
This thing happens when I spend
a night or two with no sleep,

656
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,669
too much whisky, no food.

Don't want no back of the head shot
like Mr Lincoln.

674
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:40,037
Give me that pocket gun
you keep in there.

675
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:56,751
Hey! Would you mind avertin' your eyes?
I'm a little exposed here.

676
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,632
Donnie!

677
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,070
Goddammit! A Negro.

678
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:11,435
Just a gun-sharp.
Don't mind my colour. I make a livin'.

679
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,869
You ungrateful son of a bitch.

680
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,596
I almost got my ass shot off 20 times
tryin' to free your type during the war!

681
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,393
That was mighty white of you, Wild Bill.

682
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,677
Bill! The horses'll be ready at...

683
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,358
Aw, shit.

684
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,956
Who the hell are you?

685
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,717
I don't think these are gentlemen
we should challenge, Joe.

686
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:48,676
They look a bit on the rough and
boorish side, possibly even dangerous.

687
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,629
What are we waitin' for?
Let's get this done.

688
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:14,309
I told you I wanted to think things through.

689
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:18,877
I kinda enjoy the great man
bein' captured like he is.

690
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,039
You lose your nerve?
We've been here long enough.

691
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,475
- Well, play cards.
- You reckon we're really gonna do this?

692
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:35,836
You deserted my ma
and left her unacknowledged.

693
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:39,475
Then you shot and killed the only man
that coulda made her happy.

694
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,149
Your ma always knowed
I might have to leave.

695
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:47,999
She enjoyed our little time together,
just like I did.

696
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,477
Then how come you promised
you were gonna be like a father to me?

697
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:56,559
That's a mighty evil thing
to tell a young widow.

698
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:01,396
Now, you see, Jack,
that's the way it is with men and women.

699
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:07,595
Lots of times, men make some promises,
then take their pleasures and move on.

700
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:11,599
- Jane, play cards.
- Now, on the other side of the ledger,

701
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:16,236
you ought to understand that when
a woman finally surrenders to a man,

702
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,319
she's usually got him
just about where she wants him.

703
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,477
I'd love to go do my toilette,
<i>s'il vous plat?</i>

704
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,556
Sit back down.

705
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,518
- Bill?
- You can sit a minute.

706
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,075
I do believe I will.

707
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,396
Count me in, boys.

708
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:44,877
What if I could persuade Wild Bill
to let you go?

709
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:49,509
Erase the shadow
that he has cast over you.

710
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,790
Apologise.

711
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,150
Go drown in crap, Charley.

712
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,435
I don't know why this matters to me,

713
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,199
except that I'd miss Bill's company.

714
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:09,518
But every time there is a death of a hero,
we are all the less.

715
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:13,599
It drags down morale. People get anxious,
depressed, drink more, fight more,

716
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,553
causing more killings,
till the general uncertainty

717
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:20,150
destroys whatever
useful or good remains.

718
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,594
Jack, with luck, and rough cunning,

719
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,076
you've got maybe 40 years
to rid yourself of Wild Bill

720
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,873
and learn the value of simple things.

721
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,597
Fall in love with some pretty girl
and learn to cultivate your talents.

722
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:42,190
Is this your college education
that makes you dribble on so?

723
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,834
Oh, come on, Bill.

724
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,315
You can let this kid go.

725
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:51,433
Apologise for wrongs, real and imagined?

726
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,028
Shake hands, have a drink?

727
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:58,551
You'll need all the friends you can get
when your eyes get worse.

728
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,636
I don't apologise.

729
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:06,710
See, he figures whatever he done,
even if it wasn't perfect, was justifiable.

730
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,389
Well, you see, Jack.

731
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:18,710
Even if Bill won't do anything but die
restless, trying the patience of his friends,

732
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,559
maybe you could let him go.

733
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,192
Forgive him.

734
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,880
And move on.

735
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,992
He's the one captured here.

736
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,320
Well... I've said my piece.

737
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,516
You rotten bastard!

738
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,355
OK, Charley. Come on.

739
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,429
Come on. I got you.

740
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:49,917
Charley had him
some mighty interesting cards here.

741
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,393
There you go. Come on, sugar.

742
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,873
Carl, give me a rag or somethin'.

743
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,511
There ain't even a Chinaman out there.

744
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:22,038
There isn't much change.
I expect she could see a visitor, though.

745
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:27,477
She has her screaming fits now and then,
but most times she's normal.

746
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,239
I knew her family down in Arkansas.

747
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:35,115
Her momma's from Yell County.
The boy's been boarded out.

748
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,152
He's roomin' up the road there
at the James place.

749
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:42,398
- Our women ain't very pretty, are they?
- They look mostly hungry.

750
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:47,878
Probably are. The state's had us
on mush and molasses for months.

751
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,474
You shouldn't have come.

752
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:18,231
You got nothin' to be ashamed about.
The woman, she says you're normal.

753
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:23,718
That's what she says. Normal.
You act right, they'll let you out.

754
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:29,117
- I'll make 'em do it.
- No. I'll get outta here.

755
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,515
Don't you worry about that.

756
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,998
I just went through a bad time is all.

757
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,639
Lost my husband,

758
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,399
lost you, lost Dave.

759
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,670
You come into my life...

760
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:51,590
I thought you was the dashin' stranger
that was gonna change everything,

761
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,275
make it all fine.

762
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,994
And you did.

763
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:02,271
It was all real fine for a while.

764
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,073
The best I ever knew, about.

765
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:11,036
I even thought you was gonna be
a real good daddy to my son.

766
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,400
But then you went off, and...

767
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,990
when you come back,

768
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,589
it was gone. The special feeling was gone.

769
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,756
Go on your way.

770
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,310
I got my boy.

771
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,795
He'll take care of me.

772
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:44,990
I'll get outta here, and he'll take care
of me, and I'll take care of him.

773
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,355
Go on your way now, Bill.

774
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:00,479
You gonna do it?
You gonna shoot Wild Bill?

775
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,909
I just gotta get the time right in my head.

776
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,270
If you're gonna finish Bill, just get to it.

777
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:10,713
I killed two men in my life.
I never made no goddamn circus out of it!

778
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,751
I didn't know no ladies killed.

779
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,952
I was defendin' myself
against unnatural advances.

780
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,834
Well, pard, looks like you've come
to a messy end, no size to it.

781
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:25,353
Don't seem right for the great Wild Bill,
but it don't seem like nothin' can be done.

782
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:28,597
So I figure, Jack, since
all this makes no difference to Bill,

783
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,950
kill him quick and don't apologise.

784
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,640
You're gonna go to hell, Joe.

785
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:39,437
It'd be a kindness to have your company,
but I'm just tryin' to get it over with.

786
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,676
Kill him.

787
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,268
Make sure you do it clean.
Don't prolong it.

788
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,039
Just kill him! Let's get it done.

789
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,790
Everybody says kill you.

790
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,796
Ain't their concern. It's yours and mine.

791
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,320
Now, listen.
I have here one hell of an idea.

792
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:05,352
You just give me the pistol,
one hard slug in her,

793
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,040
I'll blow my own damn brains out,
save you the trouble!

794
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,470
Yes, let him kill himself.
He's been doing it all his life.

795
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,158
Give me the gun!

796
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:34,076
I left one slug in there. I'm gonna
stand back so you can fire when ready.

797
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,040
You wanna say goodbye?

798
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,472
Sure.

799
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,473
Goodbye, Jack.

800
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,233
I got you that time, Wild Bill.

801
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,155
Now this is it.

802
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,192
I can't.

803
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,554
For Christ's sake!

804
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:43,390
I couldn't do it last night in the
Chinese flophouse, and I can't do it now.

805
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,875
Cos I done it already.

806
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,117
Like the Bible says, I done it in my heart.

807
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,595
I killed you already.

808
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,109
How about I do it?

809
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:00,438
The man who kills Wild Bill
will be very famous.

810
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,438
Especially when he hangs for it.

811
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:07,075
Could you just jump over the bullshit?

812
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,235
Let's get outta here.

813
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:25,320
Be seein' you around, Wild Bill.

814
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:31,035
Maybe next time I won't be workin'
for no chickenshit kid.

815
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,558
Come on, let's go.

816
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,114
Well, at last I can do my toilette.

817
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:08,190
We got your guns! Anybody come outside
before we're gone, there will be a killin'!

818
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,992
Bill!

819
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,069
You all best stay in here.

820
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,839
Gimme one of them Colts, Bill.

821
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:41,512
Can't do it, Joe. I'm a better pistol shot
than you with either hand.

822
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,916
How are the eyes, Bill?

823
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,309
Never can tell, Charley.
It comes and goes.

824
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,118
<i>The theatre of Bill's life</i>
<i>had come to demand</i>

825
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,959
<i>that he walk up</i>
<i>the centre of a muddy street</i>

826
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,640
<i>rather than use the boardwalk.</i>

827
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:18,671
<i>He had discovered being Wild Bill</i>
<i>was a profession in its own right.</i>

828
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,791
<i>(horses fretting)</i>

829
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:30,471
You oughta know better
than to touch another man's hat.

830
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,318
Get him!

831
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,474
Come here, Jack.

832
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,713
Give me my pocket gun back.

833
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,516
I'm lettin' you live.

834
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:46,192
A sentimental gesture in honour
of your mother. Now get on outta here.

835
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,198
Thank you, Mr Hickok, sir.

836
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,514
Uh...

837
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:53,791
Mind if I have me a drink afore I leave?

838
01:24:55,160 --> 01:25:01,110
I'll buy you one. Whisky's good for a man.
Helps you see things in perspective.

839
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:07,474
<i>(Joe)</i> Whisky and cards.
The Lord does provide.

840
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,079
Ohh!

841
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,794
I've been up here 20 minutes
cryin' my eyes out,

842
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:15,196
and none of you bastards would come up
and tell me what happened!

843
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:19,518
- Bill killed 'em, killed 'em all.
- I don't expect decent treatment from Bill,

844
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:23,679
but I figured a gent like Charley
would come upstairs and tell a lady!

845
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:28,157
I knew if I told you that Bill was alive,
you'd be mad at him again.

846
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:32,910
- What's he doin' here?
- <i>(Joe)</i> Bill's buyin' him a drink.

847
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,992
Go on there and drink your drink
and then head on outta town!

848
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,475
Else I'll be the one to put a bullet in ya!

849
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,989
Yes, ma'am.

850
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:47,875
You ain't no kinda man at all.
You're just some kinda fool.

851
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,360
This whole thing's
been too damn crazy, Bill!

852
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:56,598
You've always been able to do
whatever you want, and we don't matter!

853
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,631
- None of us! Ever!
- Hush up now.

854
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:02,150
I'm concentratin' on my cards.
I like this view over here better, boys.

855
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,716
And I'm gonna like you a whole lot better
when you've passed on!

856
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:12,075
That way I can just say I loved you
and I don't have to explain it none! <i>(sobs)</i>

857
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,555
Come on, deal 'em up, Joe.
My luck's runnin'.

858
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:17,433
You remember them soldiers
in Hays City, Bill?

859
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:20,996
<i>(Charley)</i> He remembers every fight
he was ever in. He loves them all.

860
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:24,590
<i>(Bill)</i> Goddamn soldiers!
Never liked them, any of them.

861
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:28,998
Never liked bein' one, neither.
Wasn't cut out for the army life.

862
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,315
Never liked eastern bastards, neither.

863
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,115
One time Bill says to his deputy,
Mike Williams, he says...

864
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:40,519
This is in Abilene. Bill says "I don't want
you mixin' in this, cos this is my affair."

865
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:45,998
"It's just between me and this feller
Phil Coe, who stole my watch."

866
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,395
Dave Tutt stole my watch.

867
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:54,072
Then Bill waded into this mob of drunks,
sharps, whores, mental deficients,

868
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:57,476
all of 'em friends
of the great Texas gunfighter, Phil...

869
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:02,390
Phil Coe. Another one of them bullshit
Texans. Never much liked any of 'em.

870
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:05,671
Mean sons of bitches, usually
cheat at cards, never take a bath.

871
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:09,156
Bill says "Phil Coe, I'm arrestin' you,

872
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,748
because you went
and committed a murder."

873
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:15,589
All of a sudden Phil Coe pulls a drop
on Bill, who was too quick for him

874
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:20,077
and gunned him down with two shots,
the second one breakin' his spine.

875
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,794
He deserved it.
And that ain't the way it happened.

876
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,388
Then Bill heard footsteps
runnin' behind him.

877
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:30,469
He turns and fires, and accidentally
kills his own deputy, Mike Williams.

878
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,751
Then he tells the crowd
to clear the streets - which they done -

879
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:36,872
and he stands there
and cries over the body.

880
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,913
Nothin' like that ever happened.
It was windy. The dust got in my eyes.

881
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,077
Then there was the time
Bill fought them soldiers in Hays City.

882
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:47,317
A whole platoon of bluecoats
from the 7th Cavalry took him on

883
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,273
over a chance remark
about a woman Bill was seein'.

884
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:53,915
Bill's great fights always
involved a woman one way or another.

885
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:58,158
It was the only time the great Wild Bill
took off his guns.

886
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:01,238
Them soldiers damn near killed him
with their fists and boots.

887
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,999
Only the miracle of the bartender,
one Tommy Drum,

888
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,908
who gave Bill back his firearms,
saved the day.

889
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,792
Sendin' you home, Wild Bill.

890
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,272
No!

891
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:23,150
<i>Jack McCall was hanged March 1 st, 1877,</i>

892
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:28,035
<i>for the murder of James Butler Hickok,</i>
<i>known as Wild Bill.</i>

893
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,355
