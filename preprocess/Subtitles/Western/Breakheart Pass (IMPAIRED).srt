1
00:00:17,595 --> 00:00:20,137
(STEAM LOCOMOTIVE)

2
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:14,165
Esther! Jane-Marie!

3
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,835
Up and dressed.
Come on out now, ladies.

4
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:20,797
- Train ain't due for a damn week.
- Where's Esther?

5
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:23,508
She's busy. She's got an all-nighter.

6
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,636
Oh.

7
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:37,362
Myrtle! Myrtle!

8
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:38,711
MAN: All right, fall in, fall in.

9
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:41,836
Dress up, Madigan. Dress up.

10
00:04:41,837 --> 00:04:45,008
Murphy, dress 'em up. Come along.

11
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,522
- How long you gonna be?
- 20 minutes, half an hour.

12
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:09,239
Howdy do, ma'am?

13
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,074
You could have a lot of fun
out of me, darlin', if you tried.

14
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:17,917
One thing about me, darlin',
I won't go to hell for not tryin'.

15
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,678
Message from Fort Humboldt
for the governor.

16
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:34,347
I'll take it.

17
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:38,017
It's an army transport train.
No civilians on board.

18
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:47,654
Well, well, well. This is
an odd place to settle.

19
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,572
OK, you heard him,
gentlemen. Line it up.

20
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:54,450
- Major Claremont.
- Sergeant, get me Captain Oakland.

21
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:58,666
Fall out the troops for exercise,
but keep them out of those tents.

22
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:01,707
Yes, sir.

23
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:05,628
Now you listen to me.

24
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:09,090
You will remain hard by this train.

25
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:13,852
You ever see an Indian washing?
They're dirty, and they're ignorant.

26
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,730
Major Claremont.

27
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:28,902
- How long will this take?
- As long as necessary, Governor.

28
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:32,113
This train runs on steam.
That requires water.

29
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:34,699
Let's get it done as
quickly as possible.

30
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,040
Of course.

31
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:39,996
All right, fall in.

32
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:43,049
There will be no skylarking...

33
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:47,045
Bellew said you want to see me.

34
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:50,596
Get your cipher book.
See what you can make of this.

35
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:54,719
- It's for the governor.
- It's from the fort.

36
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,223
Maybe it'll tell us what's going on.
Pissant politicians running an army train!

37
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:01,564
Yes, sir.

38
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:07,523
- (CLATTERING/GUSHING)
- You havin' any problems?

39
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:11,653
No. We're just making sure we're
not gonna have any, Lieutenant.

40
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:15,031
- Newell, come with me a minute.
- For what, Captain?

41
00:07:15,032 --> 00:07:18,783
Major gave me a message from
the fort to be deciphered.

42
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,066
Looks like you've got
room for one more.

43
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:53,695
No civilians, except by special
permission from Washington.

44
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:57,532
I'm a deputy US marshal.
Indian agent for the territory.

45
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,492
The governor can tell ya.

46
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:03,496
My orders are to accept no
unauthorized persons on this train.

47
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:07,166
Dr. Molyneux and the Reverend
Peabody are posted to Fort Humboldt.

48
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,837
The young lady is a daughter
of the commandant at the fort.

49
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:13,590
Why do you want to go to Humboldt?

50
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:17,552
Levi Calhoun. He's in custody
up there. I wanna bring him back.

51
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:21,055
- Well, if ever a man deserved to hang...
- And hang he will.

52
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:24,726
The sooner I can get up there,
the sooner he takes the drop.

53
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:27,228
We can have him sent to
you under armed escort.

54
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:29,772
You said that ain't army business.

55
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:32,743
That way or no way.
Good day, Marshal.

56
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:48,249
Major Claremont.
Locomotive's ready, sir.

57
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,294
- Very well, Sergeant. Carry on.
- Major.

58
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:54,880
I can't find Lieutenant
Newell or Captain Oakland.

59
00:08:57,217 --> 00:09:00,219
Corporal said Humboldt's
only two days up the line.

60
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,012
Something funny's goin' on.

61
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,900
Get the hell off here, son.

62
00:09:12,024 --> 00:09:14,108
Wonder why we ain't movin' yet.

63
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:18,158
You sign up yesterday?
Hurry up and wait. Hurry up and wait.

64
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:21,491
Right, I need eight
volunteers right now.

65
00:09:21,492 --> 00:09:25,912
You, you, you two. You.
You, Murphy. You too, Rafferty.

66
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:29,040
Here's what I want you to do.
Go up and scour this town.

67
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:33,086
Captain Oakland and Lieutenant Newell
are missin'. See if you can find 'em.

68
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:35,675
Murphy and I will
take the small tent.

69
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:46,224
Well, have you found them?

70
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:49,561
- Not yet.
- Next time bring a nursemaid.

71
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:54,692
- The train cannot be held any longer.
- You expect me to leave my officers?

72
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,860
I'm very sorry. You know
the urgency of our mission.

73
00:09:57,861 --> 00:10:00,905
Just a goddamn minute!
Just once too often, friend.

74
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:03,958
Put the gun away, friend.
What's your problem?

75
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:08,210
Well, Slippery Fingers
here took $120 off of me.

76
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:12,292
- Maybe he's a good poker player.
- Too good to be true.

77
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:14,881
Looks like a pretty fair hand to me.

78
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:21,009
What's your name?

79
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,052
John Deakin.

80
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:25,393
Stand up.

81
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:29,479
I said stand up.

82
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:37,075
- No gun?
- I'm not a man of violence.

83
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:46,166
What's known as playing
it close to the chest!

84
00:10:47,536 --> 00:10:50,920
That's not good enough,
Marshal. Outside.

85
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:57,295
I'm not a man of violence.

86
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:59,380
(WOMEN SCREAM)

87
00:10:59,381 --> 00:11:01,674
- That's enough.
- Not for me it's not!

88
00:11:01,675 --> 00:11:04,217
Marshal, look at this!

89
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:14,477
"Wanted for theft, gambling
debts, arson and murder."

90
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:20,156
"John Murray, alias John
Deakin, alias Hayes."

91
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:23,238
"Former lecturer at the
University of Iowa."

92
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,615
A lecturer in what, Mr. Deakin?

93
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:31,287
- Medicine.
- You don't expect us to believe that?

94
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:33,623
Here. Listen to this.

95
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:35,625
"Convicted of embezzlement."

96
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:41,881
"Trapped in Lake's Crossing, where he
escaped under cover of a fire that he set."

97
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:46,886
The whole town burned down.
Seven people killed.

98
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:50,521
Seven people. My God,
Richard, that's awful.

99
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:54,018
He blew up a wagonload
of explosives in Sharps.

100
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:56,187
It's still not army business.

101
00:11:56,188 --> 00:11:59,983
Those explosives was on the way
to the presidio in San Francisco.

102
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:02,026
That makes it army business.

103
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:06,076
I'm pretty sure Mr. Deakin here's
gonna be my ticket to Humboldt.

104
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:34,350
So the governor here got hold of
some of his friends in Washington,

105
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:37,771
had me appointed Indian
agent for the territory.

106
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:44,193
More ways to pacify Indians
than shooting holes in 'em.

107
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:48,326
PEABODY: But you did that, too.
In the line of duty, of course.

108
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:52,083
Even back in Ohio,
we knew about Nathan Pearce.

109
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:55,663
- Notorious, was I?
- No. Famous is more like it.

110
00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:58,087
"Famous" is a better word, Marshal.

111
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:01,920
I must admire your spunk, young lady.

112
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:04,839
It's not an easy life out here.

113
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,385
How come you're making this trip if no
civilians are supposed to be aboard?

114
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:13,055
Oh, I have friends in high places.

115
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:17,352
Miss Scoville's joining her father,
at his urgent request.

116
00:13:17,353 --> 00:13:21,147
Gentlemen, I have a
hard day tomorrow.

117
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:23,358
At my age, sleep is a necessity.

118
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:27,193
- "A hard day tomorrow"?
- I have to check the medical supplies.

119
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,907
We're cut off from the world now.

120
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:35,040
May I please just know
what in the hell is going on?

121
00:13:37,873 --> 00:13:42,087
Governor, these are all
intelligent people.

122
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:45,967
I think they have a right to know.

123
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:52,057
Dr. Molyneux here is a specialist.

124
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,309
Your troops are not merely relief. They're
replacements for soldiers who've died.

125
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,020
- Died?
- God save us! The Indians.

126
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:05,233
Not Indians. Fort Humboldt is in
the grip of a diphtheria epidemic.

127
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:06,859
Oh, Richard. My father!

128
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,655
We're in daily contact with the fort,
Marica, and your father's fine.

129
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:12,824
Why wasn't I told?

130
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:16,828
Because we might have lost the rest of
your command, not only two officers.

131
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:20,707
- They must have found out.
- Governor, how dare you expose a lady,

132
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:26,170
- all of us, to this dreadful pestilence?
- We have provisions for a month.

133
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:29,757
We'll remain aboard until Dr. Molyneux
pronounces Humboldt clean.

134
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:33,052
He's got as good a chance as
any of catching the diphtheria.

135
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:36,806
I've already had
the disease. I'm immune.

136
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:39,942
- Where'd you catch it?
- In Mexico. Why?

137
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:42,146
Just curious.

138
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:44,772
How many troops are
available for duty?

139
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:47,113
- Gentlemen.
- Doctor.

140
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:50,862
25 out of a garrison of 76.

141
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:55,291
The others are too sick
for duty, or... dead.

142
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:59,203
- White Hand must like that.
- White Hand?

143
00:14:59,204 --> 00:15:02,873
Paiute chief. He needs watchin'.

144
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:07,295
25 men. That's not even
enough for patrols.

145
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:09,635
If you'll excuse me.

146
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:14,851
Marica. Are you all right?

147
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,764
Yes, of course.

148
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:20,307
It's been a long day.

149
00:15:23,979 --> 00:15:26,522
Are you going to leave
him like this all night?

150
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:29,359
I reckon we could turn him
loose in the morning.

151
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,278
By then we'll be in snow country,
and he'll have no place to go.

152
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:38,033
You sure got a mighty poor
choice for your pity, ma'am.

153
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:42,413
Then you make a mighty poor
example of a lawman, Mr. Pearce.

154
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:44,956
A man is innocent
until proved guilty.

155
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:48,338
But you've tried,
convicted and condemned.

156
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:52,760
Show me the law that says you can
treat a man like a wild animal!

157
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:00,742
You frightened me.

158
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:02,785
I'm sorry.

159
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:05,375
I didn't mean to.

160
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:09,038
Aren't you afraid of
someone seeing you?

161
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:13,053
I'm afraid we're not much
of a secret any more.

162
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,972
- Richard.
- Hm?

163
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:21,848
You should have told me about
the epidemic at the fort.

164
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:23,813
Why?

165
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,643
You'd only have worried.

166
00:17:26,644 --> 00:17:29,187
Or are you afraid I might
have deserted, too?

167
00:17:29,188 --> 00:17:32,572
No. No, I'd never think that.

168
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,416
Let's wait until we
get off the train.

169
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:05,498
Can I get you something?
There's some food left.

170
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:08,411
No, thanks.

171
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:11,544
A drink?

172
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,333
That I'll have.

173
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:49,661
Would you untie my legs?

174
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:51,621
Don't be silly.

175
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:55,421
- I won't go anywhere, I promise.
- I'm sure you won't!

176
00:19:56,085 --> 00:19:59,469
I'm all cramped up and I
need the circulation.

177
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,925
I give you my word.

178
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,520
I'll only untie your legs.

179
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:13,518
And if you want to...

180
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,858
hop off the train,

181
00:20:16,272 --> 00:20:18,611
it's a long hop to anywhere.

182
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:21,241
There. Better?

183
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,994
Give me a hand up?

184
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:30,998
Oh, my God!

185
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:33,705
You promised.

186
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:37,375
When a man is a killer, arsonist,
a cheat and a coward,

187
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:41,377
it's hardly surprising if he
turns out to be a liar as well.

188
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:47,053
- Is your mother still alive?
- Yes. But what's that to do with you?

189
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:50,808
- But she's not well.
- How do <i>you</i> know that?

190
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:56,436
Well, if she were, the commander of
the fort would be visited by his wife,

191
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:58,776
and not his daughter.

192
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:03,524
It's strange, you coming out
here with diphtheria around,

193
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,277
and the Indians on the prod.

194
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:11,492
It must have been an urgent
invitation that brought you.

195
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:15,874
But not by letter. Your invitation
came by telegraph, right?

196
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:22,003
- You gonna marry the governor?
- Now, really! This is quite intolerable.

197
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:24,795
Before you leave, tie my hands again.

198
00:21:25,382 --> 00:21:27,889
Not so tightly.

199
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:32,805
Why all this concern
and interest in me?

200
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:36,225
I should have thought you,
Mr. Deakin, had enough worries.

201
00:21:36,226 --> 00:21:38,151
Yes.

202
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:41,029
I have.

203
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:49,535
Thank you.

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS)

Have Ferguson ready with his telegraph
equipment when we stop at 7.00.

206
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:12,266
- And get Mr. O'Brien.
- Yes, sir.

- Why are we stopping?
- Morning, Governor.

208
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:20,645
My orders are to contact
the fort daily at this hour.

209
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:24,361
I hope you have, uh, no objection.

210
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:27,610
Make it short, please, Major.

211

Fall out. Fall out, everybody.
Everybody out.

213

Nice fresh air out here, men.
Everybody outside.

214
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:08,484
Come on, get it out
of there, Bennett.

215
00:23:08,485 --> 00:23:12,572
Guard mounts for everybody. Murphy,
you post guards on the other side.

And you, you, you and you,
up on the top. Keep your eyes open.

217

White Hand's around here somewhere,
men, waiting to pounce on you little boys.

218
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:26,628
So stay awake, stay alert,
and keep your iron unbuckled.

219
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:28,588
I'll be right back.

220
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:32,969
I've gotten through to them, Major,
and they've acknowledged.

00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,345
My regards to Colonel Scoville,

That's the train, Calhoun.
What do I tell 'em?

225
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:02,622
How do I know you won't
pull no fancy tricks?

226
00:24:02,623 --> 00:24:05,165
I swear I never would.

As God is my witness, Calhoun,
I'll see you before a firing squad.

Don't you give me
no trouble, Colonel.

I got your bluebellies locked up.
By God, I'll skin 'em alive, one by each.

Major Claremont.

The epidemic's worsened.

00:25:08,355 --> 00:25:12,775
- Is there news of my father?
- It has his signature, so he must be fine.

They're asking about
our time of arrival, sir.

With this weather, I guess we'll
be at Breakheart Pass in about...

240
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:24,667
20 hours.

compliments to Colonel Scoville.

Then get Myrtle City. Request word on
Captain Oakland and Lieutenant Newell.

00:25:34,548 --> 00:25:37,220
Yes, sir.

244
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:48,567
- I can't get Myrtle City, Major.
- Keep trying.

245
00:25:59,073 --> 00:26:01,908
- Dead, sir.
- I don't understand how it could've gone.

246
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:04,702
Weather's been good.
It worked yesterday.

247
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:08,455
- Sergeant Bellew, board the troops!
- Yes, sir.

248
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:12,794
Troopers, fall in. Board the train.

249
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:15,964
Murphy, get 'em aboard.
You be sure you take a roll call.

250
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:18,553
I don't wanna leave anybody behind.

251
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:38,653
- Seen Dr. Molyneux this morning?
- No, not yet.

252
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:42,287
- Shall I send for him, Governor?
- No, it isn't necessary.

253
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:50,588
Dr. Molyneux had better adjust to army
schedules. We don't run a restaurant.

254
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:09,851
Dr. Molyneux.

255
00:27:09,852 --> 00:27:12,607
The governor asked for you, sir.

256
00:27:14,732 --> 00:27:17,071
Dr. Molyneux?

257
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:25,370
It looks like some sort of seizure.

258
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:28,542
Apoplexy, I'd say.

259
00:27:28,662 --> 00:27:31,331
You mind if I have a look?

260
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:35,048
- What the devil for?
- I do know something about medicine.

261
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:37,925
Why not, Major?

262
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:40,597
All right.

263
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:52,393
- The skin's broken above the left ear.
- Of course. He fell.

264
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:55,897
- Died before a bruise could form.
- Apoplexy kills instantly.

265
00:27:55,898 --> 00:28:00,278
No, a seizure like that would turn
the lips and the fingers blue.

266
00:28:02,571 --> 00:28:05,073
It's lucky we have the law aboard.

267
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:07,408
Now, what does that mean?

268
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:11,161
There's a puncture. Right there.
Just below the ribs.

269
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:17,085
Looks like somebody knocked him out,
stuck a surgical probe up under his ribs.

270
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:19,628
God save us.

271
00:28:22,841 --> 00:28:26,842
- It's hard to believe.
- The fact is, we have a killer aboard.

Yes, we have.

Move it along, men. Murphy,
keep an eye on that detail.

I'll check the drivers.

finished, put the men back on the train.

00:35:22,428 --> 00:35:24,970
Go ahead.

310
00:36:00,674 --> 00:36:03,512
Whiskey. He was reeking with it.

311
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:09,226
God is my witness, I never saw
Jackson touch that stuff.

312
00:36:19,235 --> 00:36:22,946
Trooper Rafferty reporting, sir.
I'm your new fireman.

313
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,572
Hop up, young fella.

314
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:34,958
Morning, sir.

315
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,211
Good morning. You must
be Carlos the chef.

316
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:42,344
I am. And you must be
Mr. Deakin, the murderer.

317
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:45,809
How about some coffee? It's hot.

318
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:49,681
Thanks.

319
00:36:58,023 --> 00:37:00,031
Thank you.

320
00:37:06,532 --> 00:37:08,491
Marshal Pearce.

321
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,203
Yeah?

322
00:37:12,871 --> 00:37:17,750
You're all mighty relaxed in the face
of what's transpired aboard this train.

323
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:21,503
- What?
- If Deakin's right, Molyneux was killed.

324
00:37:24,758 --> 00:37:28,928
The telegraph line to
Myrtle no longer works.

325
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:32,056
It could be ice
or animals, even wind.

326
00:37:32,057 --> 00:37:36,402
I think this bears investigation,
more than you're giving it.

327
00:37:46,572 --> 00:37:49,327
Some little time ago I
had a choice, Colonel.

328
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:51,493
Major.

329
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:55,255
Keep your nose clean
and you'll get there.

330
00:37:55,789 --> 00:37:58,249
What about it?

331
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,003
Never had no call to be a detective.

332
00:38:02,004 --> 00:38:05,381
Now, we're gonna all be
on this train for a while.

333
00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:09,677
We just might find out what
happened before we have to get off.

334
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:12,350
Could be <i>you</i> did it all.

335
00:38:17,811 --> 00:38:20,271
Could be.

336
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:22,814
Or you.

337
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,593
(CLUNK)

338
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:48,672
Oh, hell, we're stopping again.

339
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,271
Oh, no!

340
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,686
Oh, my God!

341
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,784
- Hey, we're going backwards!
- Oh, my God!

342
00:39:15,494 --> 00:39:19,080
- He's right. We're not stopping.
- I know.

343
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:38,808
What's going on?

344
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,519
Quickly! Get in your bunks!
Down there!

345
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,524
- Move! Get in those bunks and stay there!
- Sarge, I'm scared. What's going on?

346
00:39:46,525 --> 00:39:49,652
Lay down, and stay there.
Get back in your bunks!

347
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:53,698
All of you, get back in your bunks!
It'll be all right. Stay in your bunks.

348
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:57,035
Troopers! Troopers,
calm down! Don't panic!

349
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:11,049
- God! It's locked from the outside!
- What the hell is going on here?

350
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,591
Where's that brakeman?

351
00:40:14,386 --> 00:40:17,604
Where's that brakeman? Open it!

352
00:40:34,073 --> 00:40:36,199
(GUNSHOTS)

353
00:42:16,216 --> 00:42:19,969
It's broken. The metal
must have crystallized.

354
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:25,183
- I don't know why the brakes didn't hold.
- Sounded like a gunshot to me.

355
00:42:25,184 --> 00:42:27,685
Thank God we didn't lose
the medical supplies.

356
00:42:27,686 --> 00:42:31,898
- Not much good without a doctor.
- You're a doctor. Least, so you said.

357
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:35,485
- Not any more I'm not.
- Simple charity to your fellow man.

358
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,359
My fellow man is about to hang me.

359
00:42:41,617 --> 00:42:44,586
Major, we must try for
more replacements.

360
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,299
Major, you have to contact the fort.

361
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,883
The telegraph set's in the
front of the supply wagon.

362
00:42:58,884 --> 00:43:01,473
Henry, telegraph set
in the supply wagon.

363
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,348
Sooner or later, me and sonny
boy are gonna need some sleep.

364
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:17,692
There's nothing you can do
about that. They're dead.

365
00:43:19,655 --> 00:43:21,781
So am I. Or as good as.

366
00:43:21,782 --> 00:43:26,709
It wasn't your fault. You were back there
with us. Nothing you could have done.

367
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,084
It ain't there, sir.

368
00:43:34,628 --> 00:43:37,715
- What?
- The spare telegraph set. It's gone.

369
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:48,938
(SPEAKS PAIUTE)

370
00:44:11,206 --> 00:44:15,006
Mighty glad to see you, White Hand.
You made good time.

371
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,670
The train?

372
00:44:17,671 --> 00:44:19,672
It's comin'.

373
00:44:19,673 --> 00:44:22,643
- Soldiers?
- No word yet.

374
00:44:43,572 --> 00:44:45,699
Me, too, sonny boy.

375
00:44:46,075 --> 00:44:48,533
Me, too.

376
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,196
All right. Six hours, no more.

377
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:24,361
Take a compartment in the next car.

378
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:31,832
Who's gonna watch the steam?

379
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,630
I think we have someone
who can take care of that.

380
00:45:36,792 --> 00:45:40,962
Feed in the fuel to keep the
needle between 100 and 130.

381
00:45:40,963 --> 00:45:43,505
You got any questions?

382
00:45:47,136 --> 00:45:49,637
Use the wood pile on the left.

383
00:45:49,638 --> 00:45:52,180
The other's no good. It's wet.

384
00:50:25,831 --> 00:50:28,958
- He says they didn't wreck the troop cars.
- Son of a bitch!

385
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:31,419
He ain't done yet, Jebbo.

386
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,840
Hawkins, ask him what time
he gets to Breakheart Pass.

387
00:50:35,341 --> 00:50:38,760
Then tell him to stop the
train when he gets there.

388
00:50:39,845 --> 00:50:42,430
We'll have to get rid
of those soldiers.

389
00:50:42,431 --> 00:50:46,776
White Hand's gonna have to work
a mite harder than he figured.

390
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,282
It's about time. It's almost morning.

391
00:51:05,371 --> 00:51:07,710
I'm hungry.

392
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,511
Pressure's right up there.

393
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:29,310
Go back and go to bed. You can
sleep the rest of the way.

394

(BLOWS WHISTLE)

395
00:52:50,726 --> 00:52:53,561
Mind if I help myself?

396
00:52:53,562 --> 00:52:56,104
Of course not, Major.

397
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:02,784
What is it, Henry?

398
00:53:03,697 --> 00:53:06,239
I can't find the reverend.

399
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:18,337
He can't be far. Only ten minutes
ago he was trying to save my soul.

400
00:53:19,004 --> 00:53:22,090
Could he have fallen off?

401
00:53:22,091 --> 00:53:27,136
- We could back up and look for him.
- Well, where's O'Brien? We'll back up.

402
00:53:28,597 --> 00:53:31,057
- No!
- My God, Richard!

403
00:53:31,058 --> 00:53:34,519
- Why not?
- Someone is trying to stop this train.

404
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,898
- I will not allow that to happen.
- I can't believe you won't stop to look.

405
00:53:38,899 --> 00:53:43,945
Marica, darling, there are men dying at
that fort who desperately need our help.

406
00:53:44,196 --> 00:53:47,118
It's my responsibility
to get us there.

407
00:53:47,408 --> 00:53:52,833
If the reverend was stupid or unlucky
enough to have fallen off, I'm sorry.

408
00:53:54,582 --> 00:53:57,752
- We're going through.
- Governor!

You are one superior son of a bitch.

410
00:54:04,258 --> 00:54:07,096
We'll search what's
left of this train.

411
00:54:49,637 --> 00:54:52,178
Who are you?

412
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,730
John Deakin.

413
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,900
What are you?

414
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:03,274
He must have fallen off.
If we back up maybe five miles...

415
00:55:03,275 --> 00:55:06,066
He certainly wouldn't
have jumped off.

416
00:55:06,654 --> 00:55:10,786
Reverend Peabody was small. A big,
strong man could have thrown him off.

417
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:15,411
Me, I have an alibi. Miss Scoville
obviously is not a strong man.

But the rest of you

Deakin, what the hell
are you talking about?

420
00:55:21,293 --> 00:55:24,629
You're pretty free with
your theories, Mr. Deakin.

00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,969
And my whiskey.

422
00:55:29,301 --> 00:55:32,555
A damn sight better than
that whiskey back in Myrtle.

There's no need for that.

Mr. Deakin is not a man of violence.

425
00:55:46,986 --> 00:55:49,444
He told us what he's not,

Don't. You'll die if you do.

No, not me. Your friends out there.

438

I'm gonna take my hand away.
Don't scream. You promise?

You damn fool. You'll get us both killed.
There's no help for you out there.

Especially not from your
friend the governor.

Don't... scream.

I want you to hide me.

Why should I?

01:05:21,477 --> 01:05:24,562
To save both our lives.

445
01:05:24,563 --> 01:05:27,523
I asked you this once before,
and you didn't tell me.

You'd better tell me now.

Who are you?

My name is John Deakin.
That's my real name.

449
01:05:34,698 --> 01:05:38,785
- I work for the US Secret Service.
- I don't believe you.

- What is it, O'Brien?
- The prisoner, Deakin. He's escaped.

01:06:19,535 --> 01:06:22,287
Where could a man escape
to in this wilderness?

457
01:06:22,288 --> 01:06:26,835
That's the point, there is no place.
That's why we think he's still on the train.

01:06:27,001 --> 01:06:29,377
- And you think perhaps <i>I</i> had...?
- No, no, no.

Just that he could have sneaked
in when you were asleep.

I can assure you he isn't
hiding under <i>my</i> bed.

463
01:06:49,315 --> 01:06:51,654
Tight squeeze.

464
01:06:52,276 --> 01:06:55,197
I'm a damn fool. Now please get out.

465
01:06:55,988 --> 01:07:01,199
I want you to do one more thing for me.
Go along and bring back the major.

466
01:07:03,203 --> 01:07:06,623
Nobody else. Just the major.
Don't even talk to anybody.

- Especially not Governor Fairchild.

- I don't believe a word of it.

472
01:07:46,705 --> 01:07:51,167
What if I showed you 400 Winchester
rifles that were stolen from the factory?

473
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:54,462
We've been tracking them
halfway across the country.

474
01:07:54,463 --> 01:07:57,634
They're on the train now,
in the supply car.

475

All those men killed.

476

01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,851
- All that over stolen rifles?
- There's more to it than that.

478
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:11,938
And the governor? Surely he'd
have nothing to do with it.

479
01:08:11,939 --> 01:08:16,025

Where in God's name can they be?

(DOOR SLAMS)

01:09:22,134 --> 01:09:25,053
All right, stolen rifles.
Not worth all that killing.

Dr. Molyneux... there was no reason.

493
01:09:27,097 --> 01:09:31,559
If you remember, Molyneux said he was
going to inspect the medical supplies.

494
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,313
Rifles, dynamite, ammunition...

495

There is no diphtheria.

498
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:46,199
Reverend Peabody didn't
go into the supplies.

499
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:49,327
I don't think he went
to church, either.

500
01:09:49,328 --> 01:09:54,707
Mr. Peabody was a secret service
operative for 15 years,

501

Don't touch that gun.

Hey, point that thing the other way.
I'm just a working stiff.

Bring him over here.

Get down.

- I don't have a gun. I'm just the engineer.

- No! No, no, no!
- Jump!

509
01:11:09,283 --> 01:11:10,994
No!

510
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:15,455
- Where's the gun?
- It's... it's in the box.

511
01:11:15,456 --> 01:11:17,380
Underneath the seat.

512
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:27,717
I don't know who you are,
but the law says...

513
01:11:27,718 --> 01:11:30,390
The law's who I am.

514
01:11:33,933 --> 01:11:36,770
Have a look behind that wood.

515
01:12:07,675 --> 01:12:10,927
They got onto something back
there in Myrtle, and died for it.

516
01:12:10,928 --> 01:12:14,561
Then when Jackson the
fireman spotted the bodies,

517
01:12:14,807 --> 01:12:17,432
Banlon threw him off the train.

518
01:12:18,602 --> 01:12:21,144
Are you gonna listen
to this murderer?

519
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:26,192
I looked at Jackson at the bottom of the
trestle... a head wound with a lot of blood.

520
01:12:26,527 --> 01:12:28,778
A dead man doesn't bleed.

521
01:12:28,779 --> 01:12:32,828
You probably hit him with a
wrench before you threw him off.

522
01:12:34,994 --> 01:12:38,871
Before God, Major, I don't
know what he's talking about.

523
01:12:38,872 --> 01:12:41,498
Major, sir, what do I do?

524
01:12:42,376 --> 01:12:46,756
Keep your gun on Banlon.
If he moves, kill him.

525
01:12:49,592 --> 01:12:53,052
We'll have to crawl forward on
the roof and shoot him out.

526
01:12:53,053 --> 01:12:56,347
What for? He's driving us
right where we wanna go.

527
01:12:56,348 --> 01:12:59,058
Well, let's agree that
Deakin is no idiot.

528
01:12:59,059 --> 01:13:01,601
Why is he taking us there?

529
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:05,522
Well, let's get 'er done.

530
01:13:08,027 --> 01:13:11,654
My job was to arrange
a train. I'm no gunman.

531
01:13:11,655 --> 01:13:14,280
Oh, that's true, O'Brien.

532
01:13:15,075 --> 01:13:19,539
But a noose would fit your neck
just as neatly as it would fit ours.

533
01:13:34,303 --> 01:13:36,477
Hey, sonny boy.

534
01:13:37,264 --> 01:13:40,138
Give me the wrench there.

535
01:13:41,435 --> 01:13:45,270
The nut on the brake handle's loose.
Give me the wrench!

536
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:09,466
You know how to run this thing?

537
01:14:09,838 --> 01:14:12,178
I think so.

538
01:14:34,196 --> 01:14:37,165
You suspected everybody else.
Why not me?

539
01:14:38,993 --> 01:14:41,661
Marshal Pearce was our
number one suspect.

540
01:14:41,662 --> 01:14:44,789
You didn't want him on the train.
That put you in the clear.

541
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:47,875
What's ahead of us at the fort?
What's wrong there?

542
01:14:47,876 --> 01:14:50,378
Calhoun's not in custody.

543
01:14:50,379 --> 01:14:54,173
He's probably with White Hand,
and they're in control of the fort.

Humboldt's a shipping point for all gold
and silver from California and Nevada.

01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:05,437
That's why everybody's
involved, except the girl.

547
01:15:05,853 --> 01:15:10,481
The Indians want the rifles
and ammunition back there.

548
01:15:10,482 --> 01:15:14,863
I figure they were gonna put the gold
and silver in the coffins and ship it back.

549
01:15:17,573 --> 01:15:22,202
