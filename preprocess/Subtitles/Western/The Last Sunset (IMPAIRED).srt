159
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:39,704
JOHN: Good morning, my dear.

160
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:45,005
Good, I say, because it's
one of the last we'll spend
on this accursed ranch.

161
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,736
Did you find trail hands?

162
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:48,144
Just one.

163
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,651
But I'm sure two
or three more will
join us directly.

164
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:56,154
Not many people
want to work for
a living these days.

165
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,755
Oh, John,
this is Mr. O'Malley.

166
00:17:01,962 --> 00:17:03,452
How do you do?

167
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,797
Welcome, Mr. O'Malley.

168
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:12,703
Permit me to offer you
the hospitality of these
poor acres.

169
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:14,172
O'MALLEY: Thank you,
Mr. Breckenridge.

170
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,541
We have a saying
down here in Mexico,
to which I hardly subscribe.

171
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:22,008
"Everything that's
mine is yours."

172
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:24,416
It's a fine saying.
I'll remember it.

173
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:26,884
You'll join me in coffee?
Thank you.

174
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:28,319
JOHN: O'Malley...

175
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:33,349
I knew some O'Malleys
in Virginia. Tidewater?

176
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:37,062
I'm afraid
they'd be lace curtain,
my people were all shanty.

177
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,119
(LAUGHING)

178
00:17:38,232 --> 00:17:41,633
After you, sir. Take that
chair right over there.

179
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:46,767
I take you for a man
who's handled quite a
lot of cattle in his time.

180
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,331
Oh, I've done
a little bit of
almost everything.

181
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:52,173
Well, I run about
1,000 head on the place.

182
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,946
I plan to trail the herd
up to Texas and
sell them there.

183
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:58,507
Now if you're at
liberty, I could...

184
00:17:58,585 --> 00:18:00,416
Mr. O'Malley
was trailing south.

185
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:04,115
North or south doesn't make
much difference to me,
Mrs. Breckenridge.

186
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:05,715
There, you see?

187
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:10,892
I'm sure my wife echoes
my sentiments in hoping you'll
join us on the trail, sir.

188
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:14,125
I don't think Mr. O'Malley
would be influenced
by my wishes.

189
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:16,499
I hope you won't
always think that, ma'am.

190
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,664
I'm sure that's not
what she meant.

191
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:24,334
Touch up your coffee?

192
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:25,605
Thanks.

193
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:30,743
I'm willing to pay you
a dollar a day, in fact.

194
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:36,818
Plus a $25 bonus
when we deliver the herd
in Crazy Horse, Texas.

195
00:18:37,424 --> 00:18:38,857
Crazy Horse?

196
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:42,061
That's pretty
dangerous country
you're going through.

197
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:47,464
And you need
two men you haven't got.
Fast gun and a trail boss.

198
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,626
I don't know any more
about cows than you do,

199
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:51,933
so if I go as the gun,
where's the trail boss?

200
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,599
Well, I haven't got one.
I wasn't able to find anybody.

201
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,609
I know one. Good one.

202
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,110
Think you can get him?

203
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,605
He'll probably be
here by tomorrow.

204
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,679
Maybe even today.

205
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,488
You think he'll take the job?

206
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:11,750
He just might.

207
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,620
You see, this fellow and
I are kind of bound up
with each other.

208
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,528
But with or without him,
my terms are gonna be
pretty high.

209
00:19:18,598 --> 00:19:21,863
Well, you just
name your terms,
Mr. O'Malley.

210
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:24,561
Only two.

211
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,430
First I take
a fifth of the herd.

212
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:28,997
It's outrageous.

213
00:19:29,443 --> 00:19:32,241
Well, I fight better when
part of the property's mine.

214
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:34,007
But that's exorbitant.

215
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:36,342
You think about it.

216
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:46,119
All right. All right,
you've got your fifth.
Good.

217
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,662
Now, wait a minute, you
said you had two conditions.
What's the second?

218
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,095
Oh, yes, the second.

219
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:53,090
I want your wife.

220
00:19:57,971 --> 00:20:00,098
You're joking.
No.

221
00:20:00,774 --> 00:20:04,005
If I get the herd
through for you,
I mean to take your wife.

222
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:08,138
(LAUGHING)
You? You and my wife?

223
00:20:08,482 --> 00:20:11,076
You and Mrs. Breckenridge...

224
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:12,943
(JOHN LAUGHING LOUDLY)

225
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,189
A dirty shirt Irishman
and a Fitzleigh from Richmond.

226
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,853
Yes, I'll accept your
challenge. Yes, indeed.

227
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:25,762
And you can go to work.
You can go to work at once.

228
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:35,440
(MAN SHOUTING)

229
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,643
(COWS LOWING)

230
00:21:45,712 --> 00:21:47,179
Hold it, O'Malley!

231
00:22:02,762 --> 00:22:04,161
(WIND HOWLING)

232
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,960
They told me
you'd try to circle around
to get the sun in my eyes.

233
00:22:09,636 --> 00:22:12,104
You did a little
circling yourself.

234
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,938
Insurance.

235
00:22:14,407 --> 00:22:17,706
The sun was in
Jimmy Graham's face
when you killed him.

236
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,910
I don't remember.

237
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,175
Well, a lot of
people do.

238
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,111
I got a warrant
for your arrest.

239
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:28,814
I'm taking you back to
Frio County, Texas,
to stand trial.

240
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:38,259
Will you come voluntarily
or will I have to take you?

241
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,734
Say, it just happens
that I'm just headed
for Texas right now.

242
00:22:42,802 --> 00:22:45,930
Crazy Horse. Of course,
it isn't Frio County,

243
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:50,033
but you'd die
a lot closer to home than
if I had to kill you here.

244
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:57,646
All right, let's go.

245
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,284
I'm running these
cattle up there.

246
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,409
You?

247
00:23:01,488 --> 00:23:02,785
Yeah.

248
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,284
With a drunken owner,
no trail boss, a few
<i>vaqueros</i> and myself.

249
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:14,296
What do you want in that
outfit you're willing
to risk a hanging for?

250
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:17,132
Why don't you ride over
and find out?

251
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,604
Why not?

252
00:23:23,243 --> 00:23:27,111
You know,
Sheriff, this is Mexico.
Your warrant's no good here.

253
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:30,948
I'll serve it
as soon as we cross
the Rio Grande.

254
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,585
JOHN: Is that the gentleman
you were telling me about,
Mr. O'Malley?

255
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,093
That's him.

256
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,559
They need a trail boss.

257
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:47,192
Mmm-hmm.

258
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:51,428
With just the two of us
riding, I can always
keep you in sight.

259
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:55,664
But trailing cattle,
it'd be too easy to catch
a bullet in the back.

260
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:01,644
I hope Mr. O'Malley has
discussed the possibilities
of your joining up with us?

261
00:24:01,715 --> 00:24:04,411
He has.
I'm not interested.

262
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:07,417
Why that's most unsettling.
I was counting on it.

263
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,388
You have any idea
what you're getting
yourself into?

264
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,490
There's nothing
on that trail but
rustlers and Indians.

265
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,394
And Johnny Rebs who crossed
the border to steal what they
couldn't win in a fair fight.

266
00:24:17,464 --> 00:24:19,432
I do beg your pardon.

267
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:21,898
I almost lost a leg
at Fredericksburg

268
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:23,731
in as fair a fight as
this world has ever seen.

269
00:24:23,803 --> 00:24:27,432
I'm a Virginian and
an officer in the armies
of the Confederacy.

270
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,476
I'm from Virginia, too,
except I served under Grant.

271
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,573
Oh, I beg your pardon.

272
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:36,215
Oh, forgive me.
My dear, allow me
to present Mr...

273
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:39,112
Stribling.
Dana Stribling.

274
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:41,210
Mr. Stribling, my wife.

275
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:42,310
(JOHN LAUGHING)

276
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:44,047
JOHN: Almost forgot her.

277
00:24:44,124 --> 00:24:45,955
I don't see how that
could be possible.

278
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,551
Well, bravo, you are
really a Virginian.

279
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:51,425
Why don't I
show Mr. Stribling
around the place?

280
00:24:51,498 --> 00:24:52,829
Might help him
change his mind.

281
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:55,766
JOHN: That's a mighty
good idea, Mr. O'Malley.

282
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:57,994
It's right gracious of you.

283
00:24:58,238 --> 00:24:59,500
Ma'am.

284
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:10,082
You know,
I've got a nasty feeling
I've seen you before.

285
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,548
You were too drunk
to remember.

286
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:15,153
Bents Fort, Colorado.

287
00:25:15,855 --> 00:25:18,483
So broke
you were making up
rhymes for whiskey.

288
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,992
One free drink,
one free verse.

289
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:23,092
What's the matter?
Cost you a drink?

290
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:25,393
I'm gonna see that
you hang, O'Malley.

291
00:25:25,765 --> 00:25:28,791
Ooh! Hanging's
a long-time proposition.

292
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:42,576
Well, Mr. Breckenridge,
to pull the 1,000
head of cattle,

293
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:46,983
you need two good point
riders, four swing riders,
and one man on the tail.

294
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,250
You need a man to drive
the mules, a trail cook,
a wrangler for the horses,

295
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:52,917
plus four horses
in the remuda
for each rider.

296
00:25:52,992 --> 00:25:55,460
I got plenty of horses
in the remuda.

297
00:25:55,562 --> 00:25:57,860
My wife drove a chuck wagon
coming down here

298
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,832
and she's perfectly willing
to drive one going back.

299
00:26:01,134 --> 00:26:02,897
And she's an
excellent trail cook.

300
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:04,698
Then she counts
for two men.

301
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,595
You've married well.

302
00:26:07,974 --> 00:26:09,066
You ride, miss?

303
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:11,542
Oh, yes. I can even
work cattle on a horse.

304
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,805
DANA: Good.

305
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,411
She can ride herd on
the remuda. Give us
another hand for the cattle.

306
00:26:17,484 --> 00:26:20,180
My daughter's a lady.
A Southern lady.

307
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,479
If I'm trail boss,

is a sign that you see

You could stop this thing
if you didn't hate him so.

932
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:52,794
I don't hate him.

933
01:33:54,069 --> 01:33:55,661
I did, at first.

934
01:33:57,273 --> 01:33:59,867
It's hard to keep on
hating somebody
you've come to know.

935
01:33:59,942 --> 01:34:02,035
Then let him go.
Forget about him.

he wouldn't cross over.

Or what was he?

942
01:34:26,302 --> 01:34:29,032
I knew him years ago,
when I was a girl.

943

I haven't seen him since.

01:34:37,613 --> 01:34:39,205
I thought I was.

947
01:34:40,649 --> 01:34:42,446
I was afraid of that.

there's anything now?

Please. If you really love me,
you won't gamble your
life away like this.

01:35:03,739 --> 01:35:05,866
Remember,
it's my life, too.

really love you.

955

Oh, then don't fight him.

956
01:35:18,454 --> 01:35:20,854
There must be
a way out. Find it.

Good afternoon,
Mrs. Breckenridge.
You look beautiful.

961
01:35:59,895 --> 01:36:02,921
I had to see you, Bren.
I have to talk to you.

962
01:36:03,365 --> 01:36:06,266
All right. Let's talk.

963

I want to thank you
for all you've done

That's all right.

But don't you think you
should get out of the country,
before something happens?

What could happen?

01:36:22,184 --> 01:36:24,584
Well, if you
stay here, you'll...

968
01:36:24,653 --> 01:36:28,885
Either you'll have another
murder on your hands,
or you'll be killed.

969
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:31,825
You're not thinking
about me. You're
worried about Stribling.

970
01:36:31,894 --> 01:36:36,024
You love him. You don't
want to see him killed.
That's fair enough.

I'm not thinking
of Stribling.

You're a real woman,
Belle.

won't live long enough
to know what he's got.

I can't let you
take her, Bren.

Nothing bad will ever happen
to her while I'm with her.
I promise that.

She's so young, it can't.
It will.

983

need each other. I don't
know how it happened,

she'll never love

But I do. I want Missy.
And she belongs to me.

I love my own life.
