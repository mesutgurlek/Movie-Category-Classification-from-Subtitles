162
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,566
(gunshot)

163
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:20,596
<i>¡Jorge! ¡Carlos!
¡Ve y agárralo!</i>

164
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,897
(laughing)

165
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,778
<i>¡Alto!</i>

166
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,697
<i>¡Y no se me dispersen!</i>

167
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:46,580
<i>Oye, viejo. ¿No has visto a un gringo
pasar por aquí mucho muy apurado?</i>

168
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,458
<i>Sí, capitán. Un hombre muy malo.</i>

169
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:53,086
<i>Y se fue por ahí. Y no traía zapatos.</i>

170
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,756
(men laughing)

171
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,341
No shoes, huh?

172
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,344
(laughing continues)

173
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,765
<i>¿Es aquel su caballo?</i>

174
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:12,940
<i>Sí, señor.
Y se llevó al mejor de los míos.</i>

175
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:16,026
<i>- Te pagó, ¿no?
- Sí, mi jefe.</i>

176
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,695
<i>- A ver, ¿cuánto?
- Muy poco.</i>

177
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,240
Say, I wonder what happened
to your friend, huh?

178
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:27,829
Well, uh, maybe he goes back
to find the shoes.

179
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,248
(laughing)

180
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:36,964
<i>¡Bueno, ya vámonos, muchachos!
¡Vámonos, muchachos!</i>

181
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,899
<i>Refrescante.</i>

182
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:41,278
We get to my woman's place,
she'll get us horses and clothes.

183
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,031
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

184
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:48,952
Well. <i>Vamos para allá.</i>

185
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,640
I've been thinking, amigo,
about this Longworth.

186
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,852
Must be very hard to find him.

187
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,147
It's a very big country.

188
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:20,734
I know all his old stompin' grounds.

189
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,615
Sooner or later I'm gonna find him.

190
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:29,826
Five years we spent in that stinking hole.

191
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,369
'Bout time we live a little.

192
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,165
- What if he's dead?
- Then I'll find him dead.

193
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,753
You could spend the rest of your life
looking for this man.

194
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,882
Let's get going.

195
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:45,509
Cinch up.

196
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:58,271

Hey, you boys, you wait here,

Aw. Where you goin', Red?

I'll be back.

I think she's tryin' to get us drunk

I'm all right.

239
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,607
What are you doing here?

240
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,694
Just killing time.

241
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,279
Oh.

242
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:55,115
It's five or six years since I see you.

243
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:58,201
Hey, I hear you got in some bad trouble.

244
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:01,371
Ah, a little bit.

245
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:04,332
Mmm, that's bad.

246
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:07,836
Hey, what happened to your friend?

247
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:12,048
Well, I don't know.
I kinda lost track of him.

248
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,928
- When was the last time you seen him?
- Not since he was here with you.

249
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:19,931
You remember. When the rurales
came and killed that guy —

<i>¡Ay, Chihuahua!</i>

251
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:25,687
Maybe he run back over the border.

00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,316
Yeah.

253
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,736

Hey, Red, what you doing over here?
I'm over there.

Ah, just one moment, baby.

(babbles, laughs)

257
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,995
I'm coming right away.
I'm here talking to an old friend.

- No, let's go.
<i>- Momentito.</i>

00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:46,708
- (Harv groans)
- She'll be right back.

260
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,877
I'm just asking her a few things.

261
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,171
Ask her questions on your own money, bub.
Let's go.

262
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:52,964
<i>- Momentito. Momentito.</i>
- Come on.

263
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:54,674
Don't be doin' her like that.

264
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:02,223
- What'd you just say?
- I said, don't be doin' her like that.

265
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:05,810
You know, I've had just about
enough out of you, jackass.

266
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,454
Well, Harvey Johnson's gonna be
a famous name round these parts.

267
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:29,959
You're gonna get yourself killed
by a fella called Rio.

268
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,303
(chuckles)

269
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,890
That ain't him.

270
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,475
It ain't, huh?

271
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,063
I wouldn't want to lose me
a handful of brains tryin' to find out.

272
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,731
Now, would you, Harv?

273
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,904
I don't care if it is him.

274
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,739
(chuckles)

275
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,533
You don't, huh?

276
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,004
My name's Amory. I'd like to
sit down with you and buy you a drink.

277
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,257
Got something I'd like to talk over.

278
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,052
<i>Te veo, guapo.</i>

279
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,348
Mind if I sit down?

280
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:37,402
Oh, don't pay no attention to him.
He's just pumped up a little.

281
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:41,865
You must have heard of me.
Bob Amory?

282
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:44,826
Nope.

283
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:52,500
Well, don't matter anyway.

284
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:55,879
You know what's a real piece of luck?
My running into you like this.

285
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,841
Got a good idea
I'd like to talk to you about.

286
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:06,514
How would you like to get rich
once and for all?

287
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:12,437
You could stand a piece of change,
couldn't you?

288
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,067
You got something to tell me?

289
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:23,448
Fourteen days' ride from here,
there's a town.

290
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:29,162
And in that town
there's the fattest bank you ever saw.

291
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,706
And it ain't nothin' but a cheese box.

292
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,210
What are you telling me all this for?

293
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:39,881
I'm gonna need some help to take that bank.

294
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:42,550
How come you don't do it on your own?

295
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:46,763
Two men ain't enough.

296
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:55,605
I never saw a bank two men couldn't take.

297
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,108
That's true.

298
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:01,361
But this is a little different deal.

299
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:06,407
Word's going around that you're
looking hard for Dad Longworth,

300
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,493
that there's dirt between you.

301
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,871
Now, if that's true,

302
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,457
I can tell you where you can find him.

303
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,003
Want me to keep talkin'?

304
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,467
Mm-hmm.

305
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,930
Now, here's where the fun comes.

306
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,143
And it's gonna tickle you.

307
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,732
The sheriff in that town is Dad Longworth.

308
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:43,736
(Bob laughing)

309
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,616
Now we gonna do some business?

310
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,831
Yeah.

311
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:19,105
BOB: Well, there she is.

312
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,566
Monterey, California.

313
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:26,779
I think of the money waiting in that bank,
just makes me wanna cry.

314
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:29,616
(Harv, Bob laughing)

315
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,618
Harv, you gonna have
diamonds in your teeth.

316
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:34,495
And you ain't never

I'll be back.

Looking for somebody?

323
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:08,381
Looking for Dad Longworth.
Could you tell me where I could find him?

324
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,675
What do you want with him?

325
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:12,343
I wanna see him.

What about? I'm the deputy.

330
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:29,986
I don't believe you could handle it.

331
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,530
I asked you polite.

332
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:35,074
Read that sign?

333
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:39,537
I got a lot of funny things to do today,
but lippin' with you ain't one of 'em.

334
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:43,750
I'd say you was shy a few manners, mister.

335
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:49,922
You're looking
to get your back busted, sonny.

Can you tell me
where I can find Dad Longworth?

340

- Oh, Dad's over at home.
- Where's that?

341
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,043
About two miles out of town.
You take the south fork plumb to the beach.

00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,295
Yeah?

Well.

Remember the last time
we had tequila together?

371
00:38:41,112 --> 00:38:45,533
Sure do. That was up on the mountain
when we was hung up there. Remember?

372
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:47,702
- About five years ago.
- That's right.

373
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:50,579
No, just — Yeah, that's right.
It was just under five years.

374
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:56,168
I, uh — I guess you wondered
why I never showed with the horses.

375
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:58,045
Yeah, I thought about it.

376
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,758
Well, you know, knowin'
how you was in them days,

377
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:06,262
I figured you for gettin' drunk
and fallin' down onto some <i>chiquita</i>

378
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:08,848
and losing track of time. (chuckles)

379
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:13,686
No, I didn't forget, kid.

380
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:16,230
But there was nothing I could do.

381
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:19,358
When I got to that little <i>rancho,</i>
there were no horses.

382
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:21,360
That old Mexican couldn't talk American,

383
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:23,362
and when I finally figured out his lingo

384
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:26,741
he was saying that he had sold
the horses a couple of weeks before.

385
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:31,412
The old paint horse I was riding
was pretty done in,

386
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:33,247
but I headed straight for you.

387
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:37,918
When I got to the canyon,
I see rurales all over the place.

388
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:43,007
Well, I — I high-tailed it out of there

389
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:47,386
and got as far as La Quinta
before the horse caved in.

390
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,472
I hid out in a cantina

391
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:53,642
and I gave the bartender some gold
to keep his mouth shut.

392
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:56,729
Well, there wasn't too much of that,
as I recollect it.

393
00:39:56,812 --> 00:40:00,733
There was enough to get me over the border
and all the way here.

394
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,401
Here to Monterey.

395
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:05,988
I figured I'd keep my nose clean
until the —

396
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:12,161
till that, um, fracas down in Mexico
was forgotten.

397
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:15,664
Well, I kept myself clean.

398
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:19,043
Clean enough to be elected sheriff.

399
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:22,963
Knowing me the way I used to be, I...

400
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:25,591
I couldn't blame you for not believing.

401
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:32,098
But if you're looking now
to be satisfied for what I did,

402
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:35,851
I'd be sorry for it, kid.

403
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:40,648
But if that's what you want, just let me know
how and where you want the play.

404
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:43,984
I'll stand up to you.

405
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:48,030
You're gettin' way ahead of yourself, Dad.

406
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:52,576
No need for all that,
'cause nothin' happened to me.

407
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,705
I just fooled around with them dogfaces
till it got dark.

408
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:59,125
Then I went down
and stole the captain's horse.

409
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:02,336
They wasn't about to find me neither.

410
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:06,465
Then after that it was just, you know,

411
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:08,592
rosemary and sweet whiskey and...

412
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:12,346
just whoopin' and yellin'.

413
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,016
You sure that's the straight of it, kid?

414
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:20,146
Well, you know me, Dad.

415
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,148
If I didn't feel right about it,

416
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:24,024
we'd have been out there

417
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:26,819
splatterin' each other
all over that front yard.

418
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:33,242
I admit I was hot about it for a time,
but that's five years ago.

419
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:37,580
A man can't stay angry for five years.

420
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:41,041
Can he?

421
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,639
You know what you're gonna do?

422
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:57,474
No.

423
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:59,810
You're gonna stay to supper.

424
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,355

425
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:07,234
I tell ya, I was just pokin' through
and thought I'd stop in and say hello.

426
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:11,030
- But it wouldn't look good, me hanging around.
- You let me worry about that.

427
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:13,699
Well, now, you'd better think about it,

428
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:17,328
'cause... I'm still in business.

429
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:21,123

to grace this table with thy divine bounty.

460
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:10,399
We offer up our humble thanks

461
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:13,319
and ask that you bless this food
to our use

I never knew you to pray
over the grub before, Dad. Yeah.

465

Have you known each other for a long time?

466

Oh, yeah. Dad and I go way back.

467
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:33,839
I wasn't anything more than a kid
when Dad picked me up.

468
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:36,800
I have never heard him
talking about you before.

469
00:44:36,884 --> 00:44:39,595
Well, we was kinda hairy in them days.

470
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,639
When he was a bandit, no?

471
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:47,978
That's all right, kid. Everybody here knows
I used to be on the other side of the law.

472
00:44:49,563 --> 00:44:53,192
Yeah, we were a couple of cockleburs, huh?
Had a lot of fun, didn't we?

473
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:55,861
- Always full of laughs, Dad.
- (chuckles)

474
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:01,658
You know, it's a wonder
we didn't get our fool heads shot off.

475
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:04,328
That or wind up in the pen or something.

476
00:45:05,204 --> 00:45:06,330
Lucky.

477
00:45:07,331 --> 00:45:09,208
- Just luck, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

478
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:13,128
Of course, that was a...
that was a long time ago.

479

You were a bank robber, Mr. Rio?

480
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,384
Yes, ma'am.

481
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:20,469
Me and your dad here.

482
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:22,388
But no more.

483
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:23,931
No more.

484
00:45:25,808 --> 00:45:28,102
Will you be in Monterey long?

485
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:33,148
Well, long enough to get my horse shod
and do a couple things.

486
00:45:33,232 --> 00:45:35,317
And after that, where are you going?

487
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:40,030
I don't know, Mrs. Longworth.
I thought I might go up to Oregon.

488
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:44,576
That's awful pretty country up there.
Thought I'd go take a look.

489
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,620
Will you be here for our fiesta?

490
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:50,541
- When is that gonna be?
- Well, tomorrow and tomorrow night.

491
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:53,752
But you will not be able to buy
any shoe for your horse

492
00:45:53,836 --> 00:45:56,046
because everything will be closed.

493
00:45:57,798 --> 00:46:01,260
You mean, the barbershop
and the blacksmith, bank and all?

494
00:46:01,343 --> 00:46:03,053
Bank, everything'll be closed.

495
00:46:03,846 --> 00:46:06,932
Yes, so why don't you stay here?

496
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:09,768
You heard <i>señor.</i> He's going to Oregon.

497
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:14,773
Well, you know, I just could
lay over a day or two.

498
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:19,278
Don't expect too much, kid.
It's just a street dance, that's all.

499
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:22,614
Well, must be enough there
to give a man a laugh.

500
00:46:22,698 --> 00:46:24,700
Then you will stay?

501
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:27,578
Well, from such a lovely young lady

502
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:30,831
I don't know as how I could
rightly refuse an invitation.

503

(Rio laughing)

504
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:36,628
RIO: Yeah, I'll stay.

505
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:41,717
- (both laughing)
- RIO: Don't tell me they're for real.

506
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,138
RIO: Yeah.

507
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:48,974
Well, I don't know about you, kid,

508
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:51,602
but it's been a great day for me.

509
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:57,816
For five years it's been tearing at me,
and I'm sure glad it's all under the bridge.

510
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:00,736
I'll bet.

511
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:05,991
Good party, Dad.
You tell the missus thanks again for me.

512
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,618
Yes, I will.

513
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,581
Good night, Rio. Thanks for coming.

514
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:14,666
My pleasure, Dad.

515
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,084
Good night.

516
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:25,677
I say I got a right to know
where you been.

517
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:30,432
Just so's there's no misunderstanding, Bob,
as far as what I do goes...

518
00:47:31,225 --> 00:47:33,227
you ain't got no rights at all.

519
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:39,399
Just so as you understand me...

520
00:47:43,612 --> 00:47:46,573
I didn't ride 900 miles to come up empty.

521
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:51,537
Bank don't open till day after tomorrow.

522
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:55,999
What about Longworth?

523
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,836
Nothing about him.

524
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,550
When the bank opens, I'm gonna kill him.

525

(crowd cheering, applauding)

526

Welcome to the party,

and we hope you enjoy yourselves.

528
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:16,395
Every year we have this fiesta

529

to remind one another that we're neighbors.

530

Also, I'd like to take this opportunity

to make this city
and, well, to make this county

537

to raise our children.

629
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,925
And I don't see your friend either.

630
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:03,718
Well, that's not awful.

631
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:06,513
- Please. Please.
- What?

632
00:55:06,596 --> 00:55:09,015
Why don't you go and try to find them?

633
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:12,060
- Not now, not now. No.
- Yes, now. I say now.

634
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:14,312
Please, Mr. Longworth. Now.

635
00:55:14,396 --> 00:55:17,440
All right, Mrs. Longworth. I'll find her.

636
00:55:18,984 --> 00:55:20,652
But I'll be back.

637
00:55:21,945 --> 00:55:23,530
All right, you go now.

638
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:27,325
- (crowd shouting, chattering)
- You're drunk! Huh?

639
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,455
- Chet!
- Hi, Dad.

640
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:33,957
- Hello, Lizzie.
- Hello.

641
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,960
- Have you seen my gal Louisa?
- Let me fire you up.

642
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:38,962
No, no, we don't mix it, do we?

643
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:42,048
Yeah, she was dancing around
with that fella over there a while ago.

644
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,886
- You look very handsome tonight, Sheriff.
- Well, so do you. Enjoying yourselves?

645
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,346
(laughs)

646
00:55:56,396 --> 00:55:59,107
There you are, my friend. What do you see?

647
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,650
An empty glass!

648
00:56:00,734 --> 00:56:05,071

655
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:06,549
Ladies and gentlemen, I told you —

656
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:09,469
Let's go home. Let's go home.

657
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:13,640
Go home?
I'm having myself a little fiesta! Huh?

658
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:15,892
(crowd continues shouting)

659
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:17,727

662
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:30,406
Hey! Get up!

663
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:33,368
Come on! Get outta there! Get out!

664
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,662
- This is mine!
- Get out.

665
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:37,622
This is my beer!

666
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:42,669
- (grunting)
- Attaboy!

667
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,714
- Where is Louisa?
- MAN: We'll get Louisa.

668
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:48,967
- Let's go. Come on.
- Where is Louisa?

669
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:51,344
She's around here somewhere.
She's with that Rio fella.

670
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:53,638
- I have to go to find her.
- Sit still, Mrs. Longworth.

671
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:57,118
- But we should bring her home! Please!
- I'll take care of Louisa. I'll see she gets —

672
00:57:57,142 --> 00:57:59,352
- Get his foot back in there.
- You promise me that.

673
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:02,480
I'll take care of it.
Tim, drive on now! Drive careful!

674
00:58:02,564 --> 00:58:05,483
- I'll see that she's all right.
- (shouting continues)

675
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:09,237
I'll take care of Louisa, Mrs. Longworth!
Don't worry about nothin'!

676
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:25,712
What's the matter?

677
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:33,219
I was just thinking that you're
the most decent woman I've ever met.

678
00:58:36,264 --> 00:58:40,894
I'm sure you have met
many nice women in your life before.

679
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:44,522
Yeah, I met a few.

680
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:48,484
But not many like you.

681
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:55,658
Something I want to tell you, Miss Louisa.

682
00:58:56,659 --> 00:59:00,455
I... lied to you about myself.

683
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:03,708
I told you I was just a drifter
and that ain't true.

684
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:08,087
I work for the government.

685
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:10,506
Why did you lie about it?

686
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:13,509
Well, I had to.

687
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:16,846
I was sworn in under oath
not to talk about my job.

688
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,017
Anyhow, I'm going to Oregon tomorrow,
but not just to look around.

689
00:59:21,935 --> 00:59:25,063
I'll be gone as long as four or five months.

690
00:59:26,189 --> 00:59:30,360
You're to come back to Monterey...
sometime?

691
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:33,446
Yeah, I'm hoping to.

692
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:38,701
Miss Louisa, I don't have
much time to court you.

693
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:42,538
And I...

694
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:45,750
I ain't exactly what you'd call
a high-bred gentleman.

695
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:50,630
But before I go I want you to know that
I think you'd make a man a wonderful wife.

696
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:55,551
And I know I ain't got no right
to say this, but...

697
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,849
I want you to wait for me.

698
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:05,144
I don't know what to say.

699
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:08,648
You don't have to say nothin' now.

700
01:00:09,691 --> 01:00:11,943
I was just hoping you'd think about it.

701
01:00:17,115 --> 01:00:20,159
Yes, I will wait for you.

702
01:00:21,369 --> 01:00:24,497
You don't have no idea
how good that makes me feel.

703
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:30,878
I don't have much of anything to give ya.

704
01:00:30,962 --> 01:00:33,256
I don't have no ring or nothin'.

705
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:37,260
All I got is...

706
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:39,554
this necklace here.

707
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:42,974
My mother give this to me
just before she died.

708
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:49,689
And it'd mean an awful lot to me
if you'd wear it while I'm gone.

709
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:05,538
I will very proud to wear it.

710
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:08,351
I will miss you very much.

711
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:10,978
But I will write you every day.

712
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:16,150
Where can I write to you in Oregon?

713
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:25,410
I ain't going to Oregon.

714
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:28,788
But you must go.

715
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:31,165
I don't want to keep you from your work.

716
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:36,963
I don't have no work.

717
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:40,591
I make my living robbing banks.

718
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:44,137
What do you mean?

719
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:48,683
I mean that...

720
01:02:50,017 --> 01:02:53,312
everything I told you about
last night was lies.

721
01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:58,192
You lie?

722
01:03:03,531 --> 01:03:05,032
Yeah.

723
01:03:08,703 --> 01:03:10,371
About everything?

724
01:03:12,623 --> 01:03:14,208
Yeah, just about.

725
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:34,562
But your mother's necklace...

726
01:03:36,898 --> 01:03:38,065
True?

727
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:42,236
I never knew nothin' about my mother.

728
01:03:43,446 --> 01:03:47,283
I bought that thing off a girl
for 25 bucks.

729
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:53,289
Well... (exhales)

730
01:03:55,124 --> 01:03:56,626
That's about it.

731
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:01,672
It ain't gonna help much to say it, but...

732
01:04:02,673 --> 01:04:04,258
I shamed you.

733
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,263
I wish to God I hadn't.

734
01:04:14,644 --> 01:04:16,979
You only shame yourself.

735
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:27,360
- (gasps)
- Scare ya?

736
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:29,362
Out kinda late, huh?

737
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:31,739
What are you doing here?

738
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:34,158
I reckon I know where you been.

739
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:35,743
I was just walking.

740
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:39,997
Let's take a little walk, you and me.

741
01:06:40,081 --> 01:06:42,083
One more ain't gonna make no difference.

742
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:50,174
Get out of my way.

743
01:07:28,129 --> 01:07:29,714
(whispering) Dad.

744
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:31,090
(louder) Dad!

745
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:34,927
It's me, Lon.

746
01:07:52,528 --> 01:07:56,157
Sure am sorry to get you up
this early, Dad.

747
01:08:01,162 --> 01:08:03,164
I hate to tell you this.

748
01:08:04,123 --> 01:08:06,083
She's been out all night.

749
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:08,169
Who?

750
01:08:09,253 --> 01:08:10,713
Louisa.

751
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:12,506
With that Rio fella.

752
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:26,020
How do you know, Lon?

753
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:30,649
I've been round here half the night,
and she just this minute come home.

754
01:08:30,733 --> 01:08:32,818
Looking kinda messy too.

755
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,408
Sure hate to be the one to...
the one to tell you, Dad.

756
01:09:15,611 --> 01:09:17,738
Lon tells me that, uh...

757
01:09:18,989 --> 01:09:20,741
you were out with Rio all night.

758
01:09:20,825 --> 01:09:22,409
Is that true?

759
01:09:25,663 --> 01:09:26,789
No.

760
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:30,292
Then why are you still dressed?
Why hasn't your bed been slept in?

761
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:33,546
Hmm?

762
01:09:33,629 --> 01:09:35,130
(shouts) Answer me!

763
01:09:35,923 --> 01:09:37,424
Were you with him?

764
01:09:38,342 --> 01:09:40,678
Yes, but... but...

765
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:42,471
But what? What? What?

766
01:09:42,555 --> 01:09:45,182
- Nothing happened.
- Don't you lie to me!

767
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:48,477
I'm not lying to you!
We just walked on the beach!

768
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:50,521
- That's all? You just walked on the beach?
- Yes!

769
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:53,274
- We just walked on the beach! I swear that!
- What's the matter?

770
01:09:53,357 --> 01:09:56,193
What's happened here? What is it?

771
01:09:58,195 --> 01:09:59,780
Louisa, what happened?

772
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:06,120
Mother, I want to speak to you
for a moment.

773
01:10:09,999 --> 01:10:11,792
Louisa, what happened?

774
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:16,630
<i>¿Qué hiciste en toda la noche?</i>

775
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:19,133
<i>¿Te pasó algo?</i>

776
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,552
<i>¡Contesta!</i>

777
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:23,679
Mother, I'm waiting!

778
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:41,113
I think she's lying to me,
and I want you to find out.

779
01:10:41,196 --> 01:10:42,531
Louisa would never lie.

780
01:10:43,324 --> 01:10:45,367
I hope you're right.

781
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:59,256
Louisa.

782
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,883
<i>¿Es verdad?</i>

783
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:03,886
<i>¿Te fuiste con él?</i>

784
01:11:09,808 --> 01:11:11,435
<i>¿Por qué, Louisa?</i>

785
01:11:13,187 --> 01:11:14,730
<i>¿Por qué lo hiciste?</i>

786
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,567
<i>Porque yo creí que él me quería.</i>

787
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,695
<i>Y era mentira.</i>

788
01:11:42,174 --> 01:11:44,259
<i>Perdóname, mamá.</i>

789
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:47,763
<i>Perdóname.</i>

790
01:11:49,515 --> 01:11:51,016
<i>Hija.</i>

791
01:11:53,102 --> 01:11:54,728
(door closes)

792
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:03,821
Was she telling the truth?

793
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:08,158
Yes.

794
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:11,662
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

795
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:14,289
But she was out with him all night.

796
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:16,333
She's all right.

797
01:12:18,669 --> 01:12:21,046
You keep her in her room.

798
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:26,260
(door opens, closes)

799
01:12:34,226 --> 01:12:36,854
- HOWARD: My little girl.
- (glass shatters)

800
01:12:36,937 --> 01:12:40,024
(laughing)

801
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,778
(laughing continues)

802
01:12:44,862 --> 01:12:48,240
There you are, gents.
Here's some hot coffee for you.

803
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:51,201
I guess you can use it
after last night, huh?

804
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:54,580
- Oh, what a night.
- (Howard chattering, laughing)

805
01:12:54,663 --> 01:12:56,665
Hey, hombre.

806
01:12:56,749 --> 01:12:59,126
This horse is still fighting for his life.

807
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:01,628
That's what you got
a sharp knife for, friend.

808
01:13:01,712 --> 01:13:03,589
Barney! It's a party.

809
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:06,383
I told you I'll be with you in a minute, Howard.

810
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:07,760
<i>Ay, me duele.</i>

811
01:13:09,595 --> 01:13:13,515
(grunts)
Oh, what a night we had. What a night.

812
01:13:14,725 --> 01:13:17,102
Now what do you want?

813
01:13:17,186 --> 01:13:21,190
We're bone dry. (laughing continues)
So bone dry.

814
01:13:21,273 --> 01:13:24,151
- Give us some more whiskey.
- What do you want to eat?

815
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:26,570
- You got any chili?
- WOMAN: I'm not hungry.

816
01:13:26,653 --> 01:13:29,114
- Take a nice drink for yourself.
- Use this one.

817
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:31,366
- Come on, drink up.
- I don't want any. Please.

818
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:34,203
- Drink up. Be a nice girl.
- The night's over with.

819
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:36,580
Grab the glass. That's it.
Now, come on, drink.

820
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:38,665
- Let's see you drink.
- No, I don't want any.

821
01:13:38,749 --> 01:13:41,794
Why not? Drink, you cow. Come on, drink!

822
01:13:41,877 --> 01:13:43,629
- (gasps)
- Drink it!

823
01:13:43,712 --> 01:13:46,965
That's it. That's the way
you gotta treat them, Barney.

824
01:13:47,049 --> 01:13:49,426
- All right.
- You pay them, they don't wanna eat.

825
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:51,762
- You owe me six bits.
- Wait a minute, Barney.

826
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:55,224
She's gotta have something to eat.
I don't want my little girl to starve.

827
01:13:55,307 --> 01:13:57,684
- Please, I'm sick.
- You gonna eat?

828
01:13:57,768 --> 01:14:00,187
- Go on about your business.
- Come on. Take it easy!

829
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:03,482
Get it out of here! This is a nice place.
What do you think you're doing?

830
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:07,069
You're gonna give me a dollar
so I can pay this man. He's mad at us.

831
01:14:07,152 --> 01:14:11,073
- Please, he's breaking my arm.
- (laughing)

832
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:14,910
- You gonna be good now?
- Will that be all?

833
01:14:14,993 --> 01:14:17,955
- Yeah, just about.
- Thank you very much.

834
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,710
- How are you, sonny boy?
- Good morning.

835
01:14:23,794 --> 01:14:25,754
(grunting)

836
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:28,924
(screams)

837
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,804
You get up, you big tub of guts.

838
01:14:42,271 --> 01:14:44,398
<i>- Con esto lo mato.
- ¡Tú, ya!</i>

839
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:46,483
<i>- ¡Tú quítate de enfrente o te mato!
- ¡Basta ya!</i>

840
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:47,901
<i>¡Suéltame!</i>

841
01:14:47,985 --> 01:14:50,028
<i>¡Quítate tú o te mato a ti también!</i>

842
01:14:50,112 --> 01:14:54,158
<i>¡Los mato! ¡Los mato esta vez! ¡Suelta!</i>

843
01:14:54,241 --> 01:14:56,160
<i>¡Cuidado!</i>

844
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:14,136
If I told him once, I told him a thousand times
something like this was gonna happen.

845
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:18,223
Well, it finally got him.

846
01:15:19,725 --> 01:15:21,727
Mister, you really killed him.

847
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:25,981
I better take care of this.

848
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:29,067
(spits) <i>Bicho abusivo.</i>

849
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,195
<i>Te mataron por fin.</i>

850
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:37,451
<i>¡Suéltame tú también! ¡Suéltame, te digo!</i>

851
01:15:40,162 --> 01:15:42,748
Now what do we do, amigo?

852
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,252
This don't change nothin'.

853
01:15:49,755 --> 01:15:52,591
We just wait for them two

854
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:54,509
and get on with it.

855
01:15:59,556 --> 01:16:01,558
Let's get us a drink.

856
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:15,155
- Hello, kid.
- Good morning, Dad.

857
01:16:20,494 --> 01:16:22,120
How'd it happen?

858
01:16:22,204 --> 01:16:24,790
We took to scuffling,

859
01:16:24,873 --> 01:16:28,502
and he come out from behind there
with that scattergun.

860
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:32,089
- Sounds like him.
- Yeah, he didn't give me no selection.

861
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:38,720
He was always askin' for it.

862
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:43,892
If it hadn't been you, it would have
been somebody else, I guess.

863
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:55,946
Well, better get him out of here.

864
01:16:59,574 --> 01:17:01,910
I'll bring the coroner over.

865
01:17:01,994 --> 01:17:04,997
- You fellas give me a hand.
- Yeah, you bet.

866
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:18,552
Let's put him in the rig.

867
01:17:39,156 --> 01:17:41,325
Kid.

868
01:17:41,408 --> 01:17:44,828
Think it'd be a good idea
if you'd hand over your gun.

869
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:54,004
All right.

870
01:18:08,852 --> 01:18:10,729
Ephraim.

871
01:18:10,812 --> 01:18:12,397
- (gun cocks)
- Yeah.

872
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:16,234
Ace.

873
01:18:19,905 --> 01:18:21,490
Tim.

874
01:18:22,324 --> 01:18:23,950
Lon.

875
01:18:36,296 --> 01:18:37,881
Left hand, kid.

876
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,342
Dump it.

877
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:44,971
(gun clatters on ground)

878
01:18:45,472 --> 01:18:47,557
Lon.

879
01:18:49,351 --> 01:18:50,852
Come on.

880
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:12,582
I warned him not to cause
any trouble around here.

881
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:17,003
But no, kid, you ignored my warning
and went right ahead and killed a man.

882
01:19:17,087 --> 01:19:18,588
Didn't you?

883
01:19:19,673 --> 01:19:21,341
Well,

884
01:19:21,425 --> 01:19:23,427
we don't want his kind around here.

885
01:19:25,846 --> 01:19:28,765
I'm going to teach you a lesson
you'll never forget.

886
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:34,604
(shirt rips)

887
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:40,777
Now, let's see the kind of stuff
you're made of.

888
01:19:40,861 --> 01:19:42,362
(spits)

889
01:19:44,489 --> 01:19:46,450
(clears throat)

890
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:48,952
That's a pretty good start.

891
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:21,693
Look here what's happening to Romeo.

892
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:22,777
(whip cracks)

893
01:20:22,861 --> 01:20:25,530
- Oughta get down there and do something.
- Do something?

894
01:20:25,614 --> 01:20:27,657
- Not this horse.
- (whip cracks)

895
01:20:27,741 --> 01:20:30,702
Enough shotgun down there to start a war.

896
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:35,415
'Sides, it might help him
to get rid of some of that snot nose.

897
01:20:35,499 --> 01:20:38,752
- (whip cracks)
- What's this gonna do about the bank?

898
01:20:38,835 --> 01:20:43,173
Well, we'll just have to kiss that good-bye
for today anyway.

899
01:20:59,606 --> 01:21:01,525
Now what do you say, kid?

900
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:04,736
You better kill me.

901
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,821
- Kill you?
- Yeah.

902
01:21:06,905 --> 01:21:10,200
Nah. No, there's no need for that.

903
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:20,085
- (woman screams)
- (people gasping)

904
01:21:22,671 --> 01:21:24,839
Your gun days are over.

905
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:26,424
Untie him!

906
01:21:26,508 --> 01:21:28,593
Ephraim! Bring the horses here.

907
01:21:43,191 --> 01:21:45,277
Now, I'm letting you go.

908
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:50,282
But if you ever come back here again,
I'll shoot you down like a dog in the street.

909
01:22:03,587 --> 01:22:06,256
All right. That's all. It's all over now.

910
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,842
Go on. Back home!

911
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:34,743
Whew. Man.

912
01:22:34,826 --> 01:22:37,537
Slashed you clear down to the rib bone.

913
01:22:37,621 --> 01:22:39,706
Yeah, we're sure sorry about that, Rio.

914
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:44,252
We got in on the tail end of everything,
and there wasn't nothin' we could do.

915
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:46,087
It's all right, Bob.

916
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:48,798
The place was crawling all over
with deputies.

917
01:22:51,092 --> 01:22:53,345
You know me, Rio.

918
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:58,183
If there was anything I could have done,
I'd been in there like a streak.

919
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:03,563
- I said it's all right, Bob.
- Well, what's it gonna be now?

920
01:23:03,647 --> 01:23:07,150
There's a small fishing village
up the coast a couple of miles.

921
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:09,319
It's called Punta del Diablo.

922
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:11,738
When we get there, what then?

923
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,657
We'll just wait.

924
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:16,910
Just wait.

925
01:23:18,411 --> 01:23:20,413
Think you can make it that far, Rio?

926
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:26,878
Say, they really did mash that hand.

927
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:29,673
Whew.

928
01:23:30,965 --> 01:23:33,093
Looks like it might be all broke up.

929
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:40,684
I guess you won't be doin' no business
with that for quite a spell.

930
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:44,062
Well, there's no need
for you to hang around, Bob.

931
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:45,980
It ain't that, Rio.

932
01:23:46,064 --> 01:23:48,692
It's just that I'm thinking of you,
that's all.

933
01:23:51,361 --> 01:23:53,363
Come on. Let's go.

934
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:19,889
(chattering, laughing)

935
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:25,353
No! (speaking Cantonese)

936
01:24:25,437 --> 01:24:27,522
(horse whinnying)

937
01:24:37,407 --> 01:24:41,286
- What?
- We need some rooms.

938
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:44,164
My friend is sick.

939
01:24:44,998 --> 01:24:46,833
We need a place to stay.

940
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:49,794
- How many rooms?
- Four.

941
01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:56,176
Phew. What is that? Fish?

942
01:24:57,177 --> 01:24:59,179
Somethin' dead.

943
01:25:06,019 --> 01:25:08,521
Hey, where can we get a drink around here?

944
01:25:08,605 --> 01:25:10,440
There.

945
01:25:20,241 --> 01:25:22,160
(water pouring)

946
01:25:44,265 --> 01:25:45,892
Howdy, Miss Louisa.

947
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:47,644
Wait a minute.

948
01:25:47,727 --> 01:25:50,939
Boy, you're just as pretty
as a bird on a limb this morning.

949
01:25:51,773 --> 01:25:54,275
Say, I heard from a friend of yours.

950
01:25:54,359 --> 01:25:57,862
That fella, what's his name? Uh, Rio.

951
01:25:58,655 --> 01:26:00,740
Thought you'd be interested.

952
01:26:00,824 --> 01:26:03,409
Really? What about him?

953
01:26:03,493 --> 01:26:06,454
Nothin'.
He's a-hangin' out down at the point,

954
01:26:06,538 --> 01:26:09,374
lickin' his back.

955
01:26:09,457 --> 01:26:11,543
How would you know?

956
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:14,546
Somebody smelled him, I guess.

957
01:26:46,286 --> 01:26:47,787
Four weeks.

958
01:26:50,123 --> 01:26:52,834
I think the hand is finished, <i>chico.</i>

959
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:55,545
It's not going to get any better.

960
01:26:57,922 --> 01:26:59,924
Let it go.

961
01:27:01,134 --> 01:27:05,513
Let's go back to Morelos
and lay in the sun. (spits)

962
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:08,975
Forget this Longworth.

963
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:10,852
He's not worth it.

964
01:27:10,935 --> 01:27:12,854
Huh? What do you say, amigo?

965
01:27:17,942 --> 01:27:19,944
You must be crazy.

966
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:19,063
Hey.

967
01:29:19,147 --> 01:29:21,065
(gunshot)

968
01:29:21,149 --> 01:29:23,192
(speaking Cantonese)

969
01:29:23,276 --> 01:29:25,778
Take them stinkin' fish out of here.

970
01:29:25,862 --> 01:29:27,697
(gunshot)

971
01:29:32,702 --> 01:29:34,537
I'm through with the fish, Harv.

972
01:29:35,163 --> 01:29:39,417
That, and them damn waves
floppin' in all day long.

973
01:29:41,961 --> 01:29:43,671
(gunshot)

974
01:29:43,755 --> 01:29:47,383
Six weeks in this puke hole,
and listen to him.

975
01:29:50,136 --> 01:29:52,138
That hand ain't gettin' no better.

976
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:53,723
(gunshot)

977
01:29:59,187 --> 01:30:01,022
How's the hand, Rio?

978
01:30:02,607 --> 01:30:04,442
Oh, it's coming.

979
01:30:05,485 --> 01:30:09,363
You know, Rio, I've been wondering
if we oughta lay around here anymore.

980
01:30:09,447 --> 01:30:11,282
Throw me the dipper, Bob.

981
01:30:11,365 --> 01:30:15,328
I've been thinking a lot about
all that kale waitin' in the bank.

982
01:30:15,411 --> 01:30:17,622
How 'bout the dipper, Bob?

983
01:30:19,332 --> 01:30:21,334
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

984
01:30:22,376 --> 01:30:26,672
We're all gonna lay for that sheriff
outside his house some sunup.

985
01:30:26,756 --> 01:30:30,635
Cut him down with scatterguns
and then take that bank.

986
01:30:30,718 --> 01:30:33,054
That's not my style, Bob.

987
01:30:35,556 --> 01:30:37,475
It ain't, huh?

988
01:30:46,067 --> 01:30:50,488
Well, maybe you better change it
'cause your style seems a touch slow to me.

989
01:30:52,782 --> 01:30:55,076
I'm getting tired of listening to that bull.

990
01:30:55,952 --> 01:31:00,331
We rode 900 miles because you were
supposed to be the big man with an iron.

991
01:31:01,332 --> 01:31:04,043
But the way things are going,

992
01:31:04,127 --> 01:31:06,420
I think even I can outpull you now.

993
01:31:07,421 --> 01:31:09,715
Probably could get six into me...

994
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:19,058
before I got that one into you.

995
01:31:21,144 --> 01:31:22,645
Huh, Bob?

996
01:31:26,732 --> 01:31:28,943
<i>¿Qué no piensas levantarte
en toda la mañana, hija?</i>

997
01:31:29,026 --> 01:31:31,737
<i>Son las 8:00 de la mañana.
Ándale, levántate.</i>

998
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:35,116
<i>Hay muchas cosas que hacer.
Mira, toda la casa está tirada y tú aquí.</i>

999
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:36,701
Louisa.

1000
01:31:38,828 --> 01:31:41,038
<i>Louisa, ¿por qué no me contestas?</i>

1001
01:31:54,051 --> 01:31:55,553
Louisa.

1002
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:05,563
Louisa.

1003
01:32:08,065 --> 01:32:09,692
<i>Mamá.</i>

1004
01:32:11,652 --> 01:32:13,738
<i>Voy a tener un hijo.</i>

1005
01:33:11,504 --> 01:33:14,298
<i>Padre nuestro que estás en los cielos,
santificado sea tu nombre.</i>

1006
01:33:14,382 --> 01:33:16,467
<i>Venga a nos tu reino.</i>

1007
01:33:18,594 --> 01:33:20,096
(gunshot)

1008
01:33:26,102 --> 01:33:27,436
(gunshot)

1009
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:32,984
(gunshot)

1010
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:52,086
(horse whinnies)

1011
01:34:16,527 --> 01:34:19,071
- Hello.
- Hello.

1012
01:34:19,155 --> 01:34:20,865
How are you?

1013
01:34:20,948 --> 01:34:22,450
I'm fine.

1014
01:34:23,659 --> 01:34:25,911
Are you all right now?

1015
01:34:25,995 --> 01:34:27,830
Yeah, I'm all right.

1016
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,002
Want to sit down?

1017
01:34:46,599 --> 01:34:49,477
How'd you find me here?

1018
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,937
- Lon told me.
- Lon?

1019
01:34:52,021 --> 01:34:54,023
I don't know how he knows.

1020
01:34:57,568 --> 01:34:59,070
Well...

1021
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:03,741
Don't matter.

1022
01:35:03,824 --> 01:35:06,410
I'll be gettin' outta here pretty quick.

1023
01:35:08,788 --> 01:35:10,790
Where are you going?

1024
01:35:13,834 --> 01:35:17,254
I'll figure that out
when I've finished up with Longworth.

1025
01:35:18,047 --> 01:35:19,548
Finish what?

1026
01:35:21,592 --> 01:35:23,094
I'm gonna kill him.

1027
01:35:25,513 --> 01:35:28,140
You're gonna kill him?

1028
01:35:28,224 --> 01:35:29,725
That's right.

1029
01:35:32,061 --> 01:35:35,689
But why? Just because he whipped you?

1030
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:39,193
Yeah. That, and a couple of other things.

1031
01:35:40,778 --> 01:35:43,614
I know it was a terrible thing,
what he did.

1032
01:35:44,573 --> 01:35:47,618
And I was ashamed for him.

1033
01:35:47,701 --> 01:35:50,579
But those are not reasons
for to kill a man.

1034
01:35:52,498 --> 01:35:53,999
Reasons?

1035
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:57,837
I got reasons.

1036
01:35:59,922 --> 01:36:02,341
I got 1,708 of 'em.

1037
01:36:04,718 --> 01:36:07,596
That's how many days I spent
down in that lead mine

1038
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,598
in the pen in Sonora.

1039
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:16,480
That's how many nights I spent digging
the maggots out of the sores in my ankles,

1040
01:36:16,564 --> 01:36:18,774
with the rats running all over me.

1041
01:36:20,568 --> 01:36:23,654
I laid awake for five years at night,

1042
01:36:23,737 --> 01:36:26,282
listening to men screaming and praying

1043
01:36:26,365 --> 01:36:29,201
while they was getting beat to death.

1044
01:36:29,285 --> 01:36:31,495
I don't understand.

1045
01:36:31,579 --> 01:36:33,205
You don't, huh?

1046
01:36:36,417 --> 01:36:38,711
Well, it ain't hard to understand.

1047
01:36:41,839 --> 01:36:45,718
Five years ago in Mexico,
we was caught on the hill by rurales.

1048
01:36:47,178 --> 01:36:49,221
And he run off to get fresh mounts.

1049
01:36:50,347 --> 01:36:52,349
And he never come back.

1050
01:36:53,934 --> 01:36:58,105
He was the best friend I had,
and he left me there for rot.

1051
01:36:59,064 --> 01:37:01,066
And you know what for?

1052
01:37:02,485 --> 01:37:04,320
Two sacks of gold.

1053
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:13,120
Are you sure he did this?

1054
01:37:13,913 --> 01:37:15,998
Yeah.

1055
01:37:18,459 --> 01:37:20,461
Well, that's my sad tale.

1056
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:26,592
And when it's over,

1057
01:37:28,052 --> 01:37:30,679
I was hopin' you'd come away with me.

1058
01:37:32,556 --> 01:37:34,725
After you murder him?

1059
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:37,978
That ain't murder.

1060
01:37:38,062 --> 01:37:41,565
That's just standin' up,
same as any man would do.

1061
01:37:42,983 --> 01:37:46,946
And you think to kill him
will make you a man?

1062
01:37:47,821 --> 01:37:50,074
I don't know about that.

1063
01:37:50,157 --> 01:37:53,869
But I know that I thought about him
every day for five years.

1064
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:57,331
And that was the only thing
that kept me going.

1065
01:38:00,501 --> 01:38:02,878
Rio.

1066
01:38:02,962 --> 01:38:06,048
There are not many chances in life
to be happy.

1067
01:38:07,049 --> 01:38:09,843
And I think that we have a good one now.

1068
01:38:10,511 --> 01:38:13,556
Won't you try to forget this?

1069
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:15,140
Forget it?

1070
01:38:17,685 --> 01:38:20,104
Not as long as I breathe.

1071
01:38:48,549 --> 01:38:50,050
Rio.

1072
01:39:19,747 --> 01:39:21,707
Rio.

1073
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:24,126
Please.

1074
01:39:24,209 --> 01:39:27,296
Please try to forget this.

1075
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,966
Please just take me with you.

1076
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:34,345
We can be very happy. Can't you forget?

1077
01:39:34,428 --> 01:39:38,057
- Can you forget all —
- I can't. I can't.

1078
01:39:39,141 --> 01:39:42,978
Don't you understand? I can't.
I gotta die to forget that.

1079
01:39:44,146 --> 01:39:45,731
Then...

1080
01:39:46,815 --> 01:39:49,735
I'll be going away too,

1081
01:39:49,818 --> 01:39:53,322
because I don't want to be here
when they bury you.

1082
01:39:55,157 --> 01:39:56,992
I love you.

1083
01:39:58,452 --> 01:40:02,414
I know that, my sweet man.

1084
01:40:02,498 --> 01:40:03,999
I love you.

1085
01:40:11,757 --> 01:40:13,592
Wait a minute.

1086
01:40:15,427 --> 01:40:19,139
You must've had some reason
for comin' all the way down here.

1087
01:40:20,557 --> 01:40:22,309
Yes, I did.

1088
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:26,772
But it doesn't matter now.

1089
01:41:05,853 --> 01:41:08,147
Mr. Modesto,
I'm gonna raise you for a bit.

1090
01:41:08,230 --> 01:41:11,608
Boy, that's — that's too rich
for my blood, Bob.

1091
01:41:11,692 --> 01:41:14,737
- (Bob chuckling)
<i>- Ni yo. ¿Qué? Qué suerte.</i>

1092
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:17,865
Well, now, thanks for the donations, gents.

1093
01:41:17,948 --> 01:41:19,783
(chuckling)

1094
01:41:21,118 --> 01:41:24,955
How 'bout some of your cash there, Romeo?

1095
01:41:28,959 --> 01:41:32,212
Man oughta dig up something
for being around this manure pile.

1096
01:41:32,296 --> 01:41:34,006
Huh, Harv?

1097
01:41:34,089 --> 01:41:35,716
That's right, Bob.

1098
01:41:35,799 --> 01:41:39,219
Maybe the boy's all petered out
from playing on the beach

1099
01:41:39,303 --> 01:41:40,929
with that little jumpin' bean.

1100
01:41:41,013 --> 01:41:44,016
That's right, Bob.
He should have shared with us.

1101
01:41:45,517 --> 01:41:48,812
Get up, you scum-suckin' pig!

1102
01:41:50,105 --> 01:41:51,607
Get up!

1103
01:41:57,404 --> 01:42:00,282
I want you standin' when I open you up.

1104
01:42:01,283 --> 01:42:03,285
Now, get on up.

1105
01:42:09,374 --> 01:42:10,876
Go on.

1106
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,842
You got right on the edge.

1107
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:23,722
You mention her once more,

1108
01:42:23,806 --> 01:42:26,141
and I'm gonna tear your arms out.

1109
01:43:01,718 --> 01:43:04,847
Guess we forget
about the bank tomorrow, huh?

1110
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:08,392
Yeah.

1111
01:43:10,477 --> 01:43:12,312
What are you gonna do now?

1112
01:43:13,939 --> 01:43:17,109
I'll be going in after her in the morning.

1113
01:43:17,985 --> 01:43:19,611
What about Longworth?

1114
01:43:26,285 --> 01:43:29,830
I just pray to God I don't run into him.

1115
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:42,009
You ridin' with us, Modesto?

1116
01:43:42,968 --> 01:43:45,345
I don't know. You going back to Mexico?

1117
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:48,974
I just might.

1118
01:43:50,017 --> 01:43:52,019
What do you think about it, Harv?

1119
01:43:52,102 --> 01:43:53,979
Might as well.

1120
01:43:55,063 --> 01:43:56,690
Nothin' else to do.

1121
01:43:57,482 --> 01:44:01,486
How 'bout your friend? Is he still set
on going in after that female?

1122
01:44:01,570 --> 01:44:04,615
Yeah, I guess so. I don't know.

1123
01:44:04,698 --> 01:44:07,534
- I'm gonna say good-bye. Then we go, huh?
- All right.

1124
01:44:18,629 --> 01:44:20,130
<i>Chico.</i>

1125
01:44:22,049 --> 01:44:23,592
(horse blusters)

1126
01:44:23,675 --> 01:44:26,053
We'll be riding out now.

1127
01:44:26,136 --> 01:44:28,513
I just come to say <i>adios.</i>

1128
01:44:33,310 --> 01:44:36,313
We rode a long way together, buster.

1129
01:44:36,396 --> 01:44:37,898
That's right.

1130
01:44:40,275 --> 01:44:44,071
- You think of me once in a while, no?
- You bet.

1131
01:44:44,154 --> 01:44:46,573
You bet. I'm gonna miss you, <i>frijol.</i>

1132
01:44:48,408 --> 01:44:53,038
Hey, listen, you get tired of around here,
come to Morelos.

1133
01:44:53,121 --> 01:44:55,874
I got a little place down in Tepoztlán.

1134
01:44:55,958 --> 01:45:00,087
It's not much,
<i>pero</i> you can live quiet there, huh?

1135
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:03,048
I might do that, <i>chico.</i>
I just might do that.

1136
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,634
<i>Bueno. Adiós, amigo.</i>

1137
01:45:05,717 --> 01:45:07,511
<i>Adiós,</i> boy.

1138
01:45:07,594 --> 01:45:09,596
You take care now.

1139
01:45:24,444 --> 01:45:26,613
<i>¡Rio! ¡Adiós, amigo!</i>

1140
01:45:26,697 --> 01:45:29,449
<i>¡Que te vaya bien! ¡Cuídate!</i>

1141
01:45:29,533 --> 01:45:31,535
<i>- ¡Adiós!
- ¡Adiós!</i>

1142
01:45:40,627 --> 01:45:42,796
Hey, where you going?
That's the wrong way, no?

1143
01:45:42,879 --> 01:45:44,381
Uh-uh. This way.

1144
01:45:44,464 --> 01:45:47,175
- That's the way to Monterey.
- That's right.

1145
01:45:47,259 --> 01:45:50,095
We're going to take the bank right now.

1146
01:45:50,178 --> 01:45:53,807
- I mean, just the two of you?
- Kind of figured on maybe three.

1147
01:45:55,809 --> 01:45:57,102
You in, or you out?

1148
01:45:57,185 --> 01:45:59,354
Not me. That's no good.

1149
01:45:59,438 --> 01:46:02,607
We go in now, we make a lot
of trouble for Rio, you know?

1150
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:05,110
If we wait, maybe.

1151
01:46:05,193 --> 01:46:07,904
We're all through waiting for Rio.

1152
01:46:09,239 --> 01:46:14,911
No more waitin' and no more takin' that bull,
'cause he ain't the big man no more. I am.

1153
01:46:15,495 --> 01:46:17,956
Now, you comin' or not?

1154
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:20,709
Not me. And neither are you.

1155
01:46:21,877 --> 01:46:24,046
You gonna try to stop me, <i>cholo?</i>

1156
01:46:24,963 --> 01:46:26,757
Yeah, I'm gonna stop you.

1157
01:46:27,466 --> 01:46:31,261
Well, now, Modesto,
I'm — I'm real disappointed,

1158
01:46:31,344 --> 01:46:34,139
you pulled on an old sidekick like that.

1159
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:36,558
You're gonna give Rio time.

1160
01:46:36,641 --> 01:46:38,393
I tell you something.

1161
01:46:38,477 --> 01:46:41,229
One more word out of you,
and I cut you in half.

1162
01:46:41,313 --> 01:46:43,482
One more word, huh?

1163
01:46:47,486 --> 01:46:50,155
Let me see. Maybe I can think of one.

1164
01:46:51,448 --> 01:46:53,450
Yeah, I got one.

1165
01:46:53,533 --> 01:46:56,912
G-R-E-A-S-E-R. Greaser.

1166
01:46:56,995 --> 01:46:59,372
(gun clicking)

1167
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,875
Try it again. (laughing)

1168
01:47:07,005 --> 01:47:10,717
I'm real disappointed in greaseball.
Ain't you, Harv?

1169
01:47:10,801 --> 01:47:12,260
HARVEY: Sure am.

1170
01:47:12,344 --> 01:47:15,180
Maybe this is what you're looking for.

1171
01:47:20,519 --> 01:47:22,854
Eat 'em, greaser.

1172
01:47:30,821 --> 01:47:34,574
- (hammer cocks)
<i>- Malditos.</i> (spits)

1173
01:47:40,872 --> 01:47:42,958
You had a good life, <i>cholo.</i>

1174
01:47:46,711 --> 01:47:48,421
(laughing)

1175
01:47:50,090 --> 01:47:52,008
(horse whinnies)

1176
01:48:21,496 --> 01:48:22,998
Let's go.

1177
01:48:32,716 --> 01:48:35,844
- Wait here. I'll be right back.
- All right.

1178
01:49:03,914 --> 01:49:05,832
Hey, Longworth!

1179
01:49:13,590 --> 01:49:15,258
Longworth?

1180
01:49:17,719 --> 01:49:19,346
Mornin', Sheriff.

1181
01:49:28,563 --> 01:49:30,482
Rio said to tell you wait here.

1182
01:49:32,192 --> 01:49:35,987
- What for?
- Said he was comin' in to kill you.

1183
01:49:37,948 --> 01:49:39,574
You tell him I'm waiting.

1184
01:49:40,784 --> 01:49:43,161
All right. I'll tell him.

1185
01:50:16,695 --> 01:50:19,114
- MAN: Good morning.
- Good morning.

1186
01:50:21,074 --> 01:50:23,535
Hold on. I'll be right with you.

1187
01:50:23,618 --> 01:50:25,120
Deposit?

1188
01:50:26,371 --> 01:50:27,872
Not hardly.

1189
01:50:29,874 --> 01:50:31,793
Where's your hog leg?

1190
01:50:33,336 --> 01:50:35,380
I ain't got none.

1191
01:50:35,463 --> 01:50:37,924
You ain't got none?

1192
01:50:38,008 --> 01:50:39,634
You better dig one up.

1193
01:50:40,844 --> 01:50:42,345
(hammer cocks)

1194
01:50:43,263 --> 01:50:45,098
Right there.

1195
01:50:45,181 --> 01:50:48,184
(chuckling) Pretty fancy.

1196
01:50:50,603 --> 01:50:53,523
Give me the paper. Forget the hard stuff.

1197
01:50:59,112 --> 01:51:01,781
Good morning, Mr. Carvey.
Has my father been here yet?

1198
01:51:01,865 --> 01:51:03,658
He was here a little while ago.

1199
01:51:04,659 --> 01:51:07,704
Now, honey, you're gonna be
a real good little girl, ain't you?

1200
01:51:07,787 --> 01:51:10,915
You're not gonna scream, and you're
not gonna run out of here, are you?

1201
01:51:10,999 --> 01:51:12,000
(quietly) No.

1202
01:51:12,083 --> 01:51:15,754
Then you get over there in the corner,
and sit down, and you won't get hurt.

1203
01:51:15,837 --> 01:51:19,257
Now, you better get busy
or I'll blow your liver out.

1204
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:32,228
That's it.

1205
01:51:36,316 --> 01:51:37,650
I'll take that.

1206
01:51:48,912 --> 01:51:49,912
- (gunshot)
- (screams)

1207
01:51:49,954 --> 01:51:51,414
(gunfire)

1208
01:51:56,586 --> 01:52:00,673
- What do you reckon that was, Lon?
- It ain't the Fourth of July. Let's go.

1209
01:52:02,801 --> 01:52:04,761
Harv.

1210
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:10,517
- MAN: Hey, Barney?
- Yeah.

1211
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,435
- Where's Longworth?
- I don't know.

1212
01:52:12,519 --> 01:52:14,604
- What happened?
- I been shot.

1213
01:52:17,482 --> 01:52:18,983
Whoa!

1214
01:52:19,484 --> 01:52:20,777
- Hi, Sheriff.
- Hello, Dad.

1215
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:24,030
Dad, all hell broke loose back in town.

1216
01:52:24,114 --> 01:52:25,907
They shot up everything.

1217
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:28,827
I run one clean out of town.
I done the best I could.

1218
01:52:28,910 --> 01:52:31,996
- Tell me what happened.
- They held up the bank. That's what happened.

1219
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:34,249
- Who did?
- Rio's bunch.

1220
01:52:34,332 --> 01:52:37,043
The teller got Bob Amory,
and the other one got away.

1221
01:52:37,836 --> 01:52:40,547
They killed the little Ames girl.

1222
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:42,424
What about Rio?

1223
01:52:42,507 --> 01:52:44,551
Didn't see him.

1224
01:52:46,428 --> 01:52:48,263
Smart.

1225
01:52:48,930 --> 01:52:51,474
Thought maybe they got you.
That's why I come out here.

1226
01:52:51,558 --> 01:52:54,602
They got me, all right.
I'll be right back.

1227
01:52:59,441 --> 01:53:02,819
(chattering)

1228
01:53:03,445 --> 01:53:05,280
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1229
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,386
Hold it, Rio.

1230
01:54:11,763 --> 01:54:13,973
Get your hands up slow.

1231
01:54:16,309 --> 01:54:18,394
(chattering)

1232
01:54:22,690 --> 01:54:24,108
MAN: You're all right, Dad!

1233
01:54:24,192 --> 01:54:26,694
CARVEY: Dad, I didn't mean to
take the law into my hands,

1234
01:54:26,778 --> 01:54:28,780
but I did what any person would do.

1235
01:54:28,863 --> 01:54:32,450
MAN #2: Take care of this one, Dad.
I want to fix his wagon.

1236
01:54:32,867 --> 01:54:36,079
(shouting continues)

1237
01:54:44,796 --> 01:54:48,174
- MAN: Take the bucket away.
- RIO: I don't need the bucket. You know that?

1238
01:54:48,258 --> 01:54:50,802
LON: Who'd he ever stand up to later?

1239
01:54:50,885 --> 01:54:52,971
Get up there!

1240
01:54:53,054 --> 01:54:56,808
- Cut that out.
- Shoot. I seen the big whupping you give him.

1241
01:55:05,483 --> 01:55:07,110
- Get him!
- Stop!

1242
01:55:07,193 --> 01:55:09,696
- Get him.
- I'll remember this.

1243
01:55:09,779 --> 01:55:11,739
You'll remember nothing. Now, get back!

1244
01:55:11,823 --> 01:55:13,533
RIO: You're gonna get yours.

1245
01:55:13,616 --> 01:55:15,660
Hear me?

1246
01:55:15,743 --> 01:55:17,370
You'll get him, Lon.

1247
01:55:20,832 --> 01:55:24,669
Oh, no. Come in. Hurry it up.

1248
01:55:27,630 --> 01:55:29,632
Hurry up. Come on. Outside.

1249
01:55:31,134 --> 01:55:32,510
That's all.

1250
01:55:35,221 --> 01:55:37,223
You too, Lon.

1251
01:55:47,609 --> 01:55:49,319
Well, that's it, kid.

1252
01:55:55,867 --> 01:55:58,161
I guess there's nothing more to say.

1253
01:56:07,086 --> 01:56:08,588
Dad.

1254
01:56:10,423 --> 01:56:11,924
Got a minute?

1255
01:56:14,469 --> 01:56:16,095
Sure, kid.

1256
01:56:24,437 --> 01:56:28,983
You know I didn't send Bob Amory
in there to tell you to stay home.

1257
01:56:30,693 --> 01:56:33,488
Well, I could be wrong.

1258
01:56:34,739 --> 01:56:38,326
But then I'm not going to be judging you.
Those folks out there will.

1259
01:56:38,409 --> 01:56:40,244
They'll be your jury.

1260
01:56:41,996 --> 01:56:44,916
You're dying to get me hung, ain't you?

1261
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:47,585
No, kid.

1262
01:56:47,669 --> 01:56:50,380
You've been trying to get yourself hung
for the past ten years,

1263
01:56:50,463 --> 01:56:52,965
and this time
I think you're gonna make it.

1264
01:56:54,092 --> 01:56:56,469
You should have quit when you were ahead.

1265
01:56:59,263 --> 01:57:00,890
Like you, huh?

1266
01:57:02,266 --> 01:57:04,560
Mm-hmm. Like me.

1267
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:09,565
You're a one-eyed jack around here, Dad.

1268
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:13,528
I seen the other side of your face.

1269
01:57:17,323 --> 01:57:20,410
You know where I spent
the last five years?

1270
01:57:26,207 --> 01:57:30,211
Rottin' my guts out
down in that pen in Sonora.

1271
01:57:33,172 --> 01:57:35,258
Now, what you think of that?

1272
01:57:37,927 --> 01:57:40,138
I think you're lying.

1273
01:57:41,764 --> 01:57:44,684
Faster than a dog can trot.

1274
01:57:46,978 --> 01:57:49,897
I am gonna get a trial, ain't I, Dad?

1275
01:57:49,981 --> 01:57:53,651
Oh, sure, kid, sure.
You'll get a fair trial.

1276
01:57:58,114 --> 01:58:02,034
And then I'm gonna hang you, personally.

1277
01:58:23,055 --> 01:58:24,557
Rio?

1278
01:58:27,268 --> 01:58:29,187
I had to come.

1279
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:35,985
I'm glad you did.

1280
01:58:37,236 --> 01:58:39,363
I was kind of hoping you would.

1281
01:58:40,323 --> 01:58:43,701
You're lookin' fine. Just fine.

1282
01:58:45,328 --> 01:58:49,207
Maybe if we had seen each other again,

1283
01:58:49,290 --> 01:58:51,125
you would change your mind.

1284
01:58:52,043 --> 01:58:54,754
Louisa, I wasn't coming in after Dad.

1285
01:58:55,755 --> 01:58:58,633
And I don't know nothin' about that bank.

1286
01:59:01,344 --> 01:59:04,180
I was coming in to take you away with me.

1287
01:59:05,973 --> 01:59:08,601
I was gonna ask you to be my wife.

1288
01:59:08,684 --> 01:59:10,394
It is true?

1289
01:59:11,771 --> 01:59:13,981
I ain't got no time for lyin'.

1290
01:59:16,901 --> 01:59:18,736
Listen to me.

1291
01:59:23,491 --> 01:59:25,701
I want to tell you something.

1292
01:59:29,205 --> 01:59:31,207
I am going to have your baby.

1293
01:59:34,418 --> 01:59:36,796
Why didn't you tell me before?

1294
01:59:36,879 --> 01:59:39,048
Because I was afraid.

1295
01:59:39,924 --> 01:59:42,260
I thought that you don't want.

1296
01:59:42,343 --> 01:59:44,387
No.

1297
01:59:45,096 --> 01:59:47,473
He will be something wonderful...

1298
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:51,352
because he is our love.

1299
01:59:52,228 --> 01:59:54,730
And you will be very proud of him.

1300
01:59:57,775 --> 01:59:59,652
I love you, Louisa.

1301
02:00:01,362 --> 02:00:04,365
I never did get a chance to say it.

1302
02:00:07,034 --> 02:00:09,287
I want you to know something, that...

1303
02:00:11,205 --> 02:00:13,249
I'll be thinking about you tomorrow.

1304
02:00:13,875 --> 02:00:15,501
Don't say that.

1305
02:00:18,337 --> 02:00:20,840
They will listen to you at the trial...

1306
02:00:21,841 --> 02:00:25,511
and they will know that you are innocent.

1307
02:00:25,595 --> 02:00:27,471
But you must believe that.

1308
02:00:28,681 --> 02:00:30,182
You bet.

1309
02:00:32,602 --> 02:00:34,103
LON: All right. Let's go.

1310
02:00:36,314 --> 02:00:37,815
Come on.

1311
02:00:39,775 --> 02:00:42,570
Sorry to have to break up
this little Valentine.

1312
02:00:42,653 --> 02:00:44,363
You heard me.

1313
02:00:52,288 --> 02:00:53,915
Step back.

1314
02:00:54,916 --> 02:00:56,918
Turn around.

1315
02:00:57,001 --> 02:01:00,296
Get ahold of them bars.
Keep your feet back.

1316
02:01:08,012 --> 02:01:10,890
There ain't no call for that, Lon.
What's the matter with you?

1317
02:01:10,973 --> 02:01:13,976
Nothin'. Just sorry the county's
gonna take care of him.

1318
02:01:14,060 --> 02:01:17,688
I'd like to do it myself, with this,

1319
02:01:17,772 --> 02:01:20,900
with both barrels of double-aught shot
about waist high.

1320
02:01:21,484 --> 02:01:22,985
Want to?

1321
02:01:24,862 --> 02:01:27,198
Let's see you pull it, Lon.

1322
02:01:28,491 --> 02:01:29,992
All right.

1323
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:34,956
Go ahead.

1324
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:37,124
Make a try for it.

1325
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,920
There ain't no need for that, Lon.

1326
02:01:41,003 --> 02:01:43,839
All you got to do is just squeeze one off.

1327
02:01:43,923 --> 02:01:47,176
Go on. You're supposed to
have so much guts.

1328
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:50,846
Mm-mmm.

1329
02:01:50,930 --> 02:01:53,557
You're the one with the gut, Lon.

1330
02:02:00,564 --> 02:02:04,318
Second thought, maybe it'd be more fun
to wait till tomorrow.

1331
02:02:05,152 --> 02:02:07,989
How's your face gonna look?

1332
02:02:08,072 --> 02:02:11,450
All turnin' black,

1333
02:02:11,534 --> 02:02:14,328
and your tongue is stickin' out.

1334
02:02:16,038 --> 02:02:18,624
Why don't you just
shut your big mouth, Lon?

1335
02:02:18,708 --> 02:02:21,544
Why don't you tend to your own business?

1336
02:02:29,385 --> 02:02:31,929
You're forgettin' one thing, Lon.

1337
02:02:32,013 --> 02:02:34,306
Yeah? What's that?

1338
02:02:35,349 --> 02:02:37,101
Ain't hung yet.

1339
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:39,770
Yeah, but you will be, brother.

1340
02:02:39,854 --> 02:02:42,565
You ain't gettin' no older than tomorrow.

1341
02:02:44,108 --> 02:02:45,609
Oh, say.

1342
02:02:48,904 --> 02:02:51,782
Let's don't forget about her.

1343
02:02:51,866 --> 02:02:55,619
I'll be taking care of that
before they cut you down.

1344
02:02:56,996 --> 02:02:59,540
- You gob of spit.
- (laughing)

1345
02:03:00,541 --> 02:03:03,169
I sure am, ain't I? (laughing)

1346
02:03:05,504 --> 02:03:07,423
You watch yourself.

1347
02:03:18,976 --> 02:03:21,187
What's the matter? Aren't you hungry?

1348
02:03:23,272 --> 02:03:25,274
What is going to happen to him?

1349
02:03:26,358 --> 02:03:28,360
What's going to happen to who?

1350
02:03:30,529 --> 02:03:32,948
Is he really going to be hanged?

1351
02:03:33,032 --> 02:03:34,575
Oh, of course he is.

1352
02:03:34,658 --> 02:03:37,953
Could it be that you have your own reasons
for wanting him to die?

1353
02:03:38,954 --> 02:03:41,957
No. No reasons at all.

1354
02:03:42,041 --> 02:03:46,462
He just, uh, robbed the bank
and killed a little girl, that's all.

1355
02:03:48,047 --> 02:03:50,174
Why do you ask?

1356
02:03:50,966 --> 02:03:54,470
I hear you might have personal reasons.

1357
02:03:54,553 --> 02:03:56,055
Personal reasons?

1358
02:03:57,598 --> 02:03:59,141
Like what?

1359
02:03:59,225 --> 02:04:04,730
Oh, the story about you run away from him
in Mexico and leave him to die.

1360
02:04:06,232 --> 02:04:08,150
Did you?

1361
02:04:08,234 --> 02:04:09,735
Is this truth?

1362
02:04:11,529 --> 02:04:13,531
I've heard that story.

1363
02:04:15,324 --> 02:04:18,869
- Where did you hear it?
- He told Louisa.

1364
02:04:21,539 --> 02:04:23,249
Smart pup.

1365
02:04:23,874 --> 02:04:26,293
It is the truth?

1366
02:04:26,377 --> 02:04:29,463
The truth? Why, he'd choke on the truth.

1367
02:04:30,256 --> 02:04:32,842
What the hell is the matter with you?

1368
02:04:36,762 --> 02:04:38,597
I will tell you.

1369
02:04:41,559 --> 02:04:43,394
Louisa's going to have his baby.

1370
02:04:51,318 --> 02:04:52,820
Yes.

1371
02:05:00,494 --> 02:05:03,122
Please listen to me.

1372
02:05:03,205 --> 02:05:06,041
You have been good to us,
and I'm grateful.

1373
02:05:06,125 --> 02:05:10,713
But if I talk to you so, it's because
I don't want my daughter to suffer as I did.

1374
02:05:11,714 --> 02:05:14,967
- Then you lied to me that morning.
- Yes, I lied to you, but...

1375
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:18,053
Shut up!

1376
02:05:19,138 --> 02:05:23,434
Is this the thanks I get
for taking you out of the bean fields

1377
02:05:23,517 --> 02:05:25,769
and giving you respectability?

1378
02:05:25,853 --> 02:05:28,814
I gave you the clothes on your back.

1379
02:05:28,898 --> 02:05:30,941
And I gave you a roof over your head.

1380
02:05:31,025 --> 02:05:32,526
And what's more,

1381
02:05:33,903 --> 02:05:36,447
I gave your daughter my name.

1382
02:05:36,530 --> 02:05:38,157
Mine.

1383
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:40,284
When she had none of her own.

1384
02:05:40,367 --> 02:05:42,995
Everything you say is truth.

1385
02:05:44,079 --> 02:05:47,875
But now she needs your help
more than ever.

1386
02:05:47,958 --> 02:05:49,460
Help?

1387
02:05:50,794 --> 02:05:52,713
Yeah.

1388
02:05:52,796 --> 02:05:54,673
I'll help.

1389
02:05:56,675 --> 02:06:00,054
It's taken me five years
to build this decent life.

1390
02:06:00,137 --> 02:06:03,224
- I'm not gonna let him ruin —
- Killing him will not help!

1391
02:06:03,307 --> 02:06:04,934
- Let go my arms.
- Please.

1392
02:06:05,017 --> 02:06:07,102
- Let go of my hand!
- Please!

1393
02:06:11,982 --> 02:06:15,527
- He's guilty, and he's gonna pay.
- Don't lie to me anymore.

1394
02:06:15,611 --> 02:06:19,198
I saw it on your face
since the first day he came here.

1395
02:06:20,407 --> 02:06:23,994
Your hatred is more important to you
than anything,

1396
02:06:24,078 --> 02:06:25,704
including our own lives.

1397
02:06:25,788 --> 02:06:30,000
And you will do anything to hide
that memory of what you did to him,

1398
02:06:30,668 --> 02:06:32,294
even to kill.

1399
02:06:34,129 --> 02:06:37,258
I told you to shut up.

1400
02:06:37,341 --> 02:06:41,053
His execution will be a day earlier.
That's all.

1401
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:47,434
(door opens, closes)

1402
02:06:51,689 --> 02:06:54,984
♪♪ (Lon vocalizing)

1403
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:13,794
What do you think you're doing up here?
Get on back down them stairs.

1404
02:07:13,877 --> 02:07:15,879
I brought him something to eat.

1405
02:07:17,923 --> 02:07:19,591
Tell you what.

1406
02:07:19,675 --> 02:07:24,305
Why don't you just trot on home,
'cause you ain't gonna give him nothin'.

1407
02:07:24,388 --> 02:07:29,059
My father told me to bring this,
and you're supposed to give it to him.

1408
02:07:29,143 --> 02:07:31,812
He never said nothin' to me about it.

1409
02:07:32,479 --> 02:07:36,608
All right. I'll tell him that you refused.

1410
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:42,865
Wait a minute.

1411
02:07:48,412 --> 02:07:50,247
Let me see it.

1412
02:07:57,129 --> 02:08:00,507
- What do you got in here anyhow?
- That's just some stew.

1413
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:04,970
Just take a little peek.

1414
02:08:05,054 --> 02:08:07,306
You're not supposed to touch that.

1415
02:08:28,118 --> 02:08:30,537
- I love you, Rio!
- LON: Come here, you little runt.

1416
02:08:30,621 --> 02:08:33,374
I love you! I love you!

1417
02:08:34,750 --> 02:08:36,960
Now get back!

1418
02:08:37,044 --> 02:08:38,712
Take your hands off her!

1419
02:08:39,797 --> 02:08:41,548
Get your damn hands off her!

1420
02:08:41,632 --> 02:08:43,258
<i>¡Suelta!</i>

1421
02:08:45,761 --> 02:08:49,181
<i>¡Suéltame, animal! ¡Suéltame!</i>

1422
02:08:49,264 --> 02:08:52,142
- I'll stick a fork in you!
<i>- ¡Suelta!</i>

1423
02:08:52,226 --> 02:08:56,021
I'm taking you out of here and let Tim
keep you till your daddy gets back.

1424
02:08:56,105 --> 02:08:58,732
(Lon, Louisa shouting, faint)

1425
02:09:07,366 --> 02:09:09,284
(mutters)

1426
02:11:39,059 --> 02:11:41,395
(door opens, closes)

1427
02:11:44,606 --> 02:11:47,109
(footsteps on stairs)

1428
02:11:54,032 --> 02:11:55,659
That's right, Lon.

1429
02:11:55,742 --> 02:11:57,911
Now, up in here right quick.

1430
02:11:57,995 --> 02:12:01,748
I count eight, and I ain't got them keys,

1431
02:12:01,832 --> 02:12:04,042
I'm gonna take you off at the neck.

1432
02:12:04,126 --> 02:12:05,961
One.

1433
02:12:06,044 --> 02:12:09,423
You ain't about to take my neck off
with that little old popper.

1434
02:12:09,506 --> 02:12:10,841
That's two.

1435
02:12:11,842 --> 02:12:13,635
You'll be lucky if you hit the wall.

1436
02:12:13,719 --> 02:12:15,178
Three.

1437
02:12:17,514 --> 02:12:21,393
I might get shot up a little bit
diving down these stairs,

1438
02:12:21,476 --> 02:12:24,021
but you're gonna hang any way you put it.

1439
02:12:25,147 --> 02:12:27,190
Four.

1440
02:12:27,274 --> 02:12:30,861
- You're runnin' a bluff, and I'm gonna call you.
- Five.

1441
02:12:31,987 --> 02:12:33,905
Go ahead. Try it, Lon.

1442
02:12:34,948 --> 02:12:36,199
Six.

1443
02:12:37,784 --> 02:12:41,246
All I gotta do is duck a little bit,
and you're done.

1444
02:12:42,331 --> 02:12:43,707
Seven.

1445
02:12:47,919 --> 02:12:50,213
- That's eight.
- I'm comin'.

1446
02:12:57,471 --> 02:12:59,306
Open that door.

1447
02:13:00,932 --> 02:13:02,643
Easy now.

1448
02:13:05,937 --> 02:13:08,357
Now turn around
and come in here backwards.

1449
02:13:10,067 --> 02:13:13,862
Step in here.
Left hand. Take that belt off.

1450
02:13:19,242 --> 02:13:21,244
Down on your knees.

1451
02:13:24,331 --> 02:13:27,793
Lookee here, Lon. Wasn't loaded.

1452
02:13:27,876 --> 02:13:29,711
Get back, you.

1453
02:13:33,590 --> 02:13:35,592
Get them keys out.

1454
02:13:40,222 --> 02:13:42,057
Take them chains off.

1455
02:13:46,353 --> 02:13:49,981
- Now —
- Oh, please, God, don't kill me.

1456
02:13:50,065 --> 02:13:53,568
You remember, Lon?
I told you I ain't hung yet.

1457
02:13:53,652 --> 02:13:56,071
- I don't want to die!
- How you gonna look?

1458
02:13:56,154 --> 02:13:58,615
How you gonna look, Lon?

1459
02:13:58,699 --> 02:14:01,993
Kickin' and snappin',
spittin' out your blood.

1460
02:14:02,077 --> 02:14:04,413
- Oh, please, don't kill me. Don't.
- Huh?

1461
02:14:04,496 --> 02:14:06,456
Get on up here.

1462
02:14:07,165 --> 02:14:09,543
Get on up, Lon. Get up!

1463
02:14:13,964 --> 02:14:16,591
Now just turn around and get your turn.

1464
02:15:16,359 --> 02:15:17,861
Don't move.

1465
02:15:21,156 --> 02:15:22,657
Get up.

1466
02:15:23,825 --> 02:15:25,327
Get up.

1467
02:15:38,298 --> 02:15:41,218
You get in there and send me
the best horse you've got, and quick.

1468
02:15:41,301 --> 02:15:43,845
I ain't got any. They're all gone.

1469
02:15:43,929 --> 02:15:46,264
You're gonna die if you're lyin'.

1470
02:15:48,850 --> 02:15:52,562
Get — Turn around, you.
Put your hands down.

1471
02:16:15,877 --> 02:16:17,712
- (grunts)
- (body thuds)

1472
02:16:23,260 --> 02:16:27,097
- McKittrick around?
- No. He's over to the saloon.

1473
02:16:27,180 --> 02:16:28,682
Oh.

1474
02:16:34,271 --> 02:16:37,107
Help! Help, somebody!

1475
02:16:37,190 --> 02:16:39,109
Help! Tim!

1476
02:16:39,192 --> 02:16:41,444
- Get off that horse.
- (woman gasps)

1477
02:16:41,528 --> 02:16:44,447
(Lon shouting) Somebody help!
Help! He's gettin' away!

1478
02:16:44,531 --> 02:16:45,866
Help!

1479
02:16:45,949 --> 02:16:48,702
Dad, it's me up here, Lon!

1480
02:16:50,871 --> 02:16:54,082
- (gunshot)
- (horse whinnies)

1481
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:58,044
- (gunshot)
- (people shouting)

1482
02:17:04,259 --> 02:17:05,969
(gunshot)

1483
02:17:07,220 --> 02:17:09,180
(gunshot)

1484
02:17:49,596 --> 02:17:51,556
You killed Dad!

1485
02:17:52,641 --> 02:17:55,352
It's all over. Wasn't nothin' else to do.

1486
02:17:55,435 --> 02:17:57,187
- Come on.
- No.

1487
02:17:57,270 --> 02:17:59,439
Come on. There's nothin' to do.

1488
02:18:49,948 --> 02:18:51,741
I gotta leave you here, Louisa.

1489
02:18:51,825 --> 02:18:53,994
Yes, you must go now, quickly.

1490
02:18:54,911 --> 02:18:57,956
I want you to tell your mother something.

1491
02:18:58,039 --> 02:19:01,376
I want you to tell her that I tried to run,

1492
02:19:01,459 --> 02:19:04,546
but he didn't give me no chance.

1493
02:19:04,629 --> 02:19:06,423
And tell her I'm —

1494
02:19:07,507 --> 02:19:10,844
Well, just tell her whatever you have to.

1495
02:19:14,764 --> 02:19:16,766
Will you be all right?

1496
02:19:18,059 --> 02:19:19,894
Where can you go now?

1497
02:19:20,603 --> 02:19:23,064
I don't know.

1498
02:19:23,148 --> 02:19:26,443
I'll have to figure that out later.
Maybe Oregon.

1499
02:19:27,610 --> 02:19:30,238
I'll be ridin' for a while anyhow.

1500
02:19:30,321 --> 02:19:34,826
Why don't you go to Mexico?
I could meet you in Sonora in April.

1501
02:19:34,909 --> 02:19:36,536
After my baby comes.

1502
02:19:36,619 --> 02:19:39,039
No, I —

1503
02:19:39,122 --> 02:19:40,874
No.

1504
02:19:40,957 --> 02:19:44,252
They're lookin'
all over hell for me in Mexico.

1505
02:19:44,335 --> 02:19:46,713
That don't matter. Listen.

1506
02:19:46,796 --> 02:19:49,758
You be lookin' for me in the spring.

1507
02:19:49,841 --> 02:19:53,887
One of them dark nights,
you're gonna see a jackass in the window,

1508
02:19:53,970 --> 02:19:56,347
and it's gonna be me.

1509
02:19:57,223 --> 02:19:59,225
Don't worry about it.

1510
02:20:01,227 --> 02:20:02,854
I'll find someplace.

1511
02:20:05,065 --> 02:20:07,525
I better start kickin' now.

1512
02:20:07,609 --> 02:20:09,611
Go. Please, go.

1513
02:20:13,823 --> 02:20:15,450
I love you, Rio.

1514
02:20:18,203 --> 02:20:20,371
Take care of yourself,

1515
02:20:20,455 --> 02:20:23,291
because I'm so afraid to losing you.

1516
02:20:39,224 --> 02:20:41,226
