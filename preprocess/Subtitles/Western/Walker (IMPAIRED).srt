[Henningson Grunts] l, who have studied
military strategy with Lubitsch...

363
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:22,362

- Well, there's no problem, sir.

366
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:30,466
I was just wonderin' though
perhaps maybe if, uh...

367
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:33,442
if I could be excused tomorrow
from being the drum major.

368
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,673
It's just that every time I've seen
pictures of battlefield scenes...

369
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,978
and, uh, I always see the drummer boy
lying dead next to his drum...

for a drum.

my drum in for a rifle.

You wanted to see me, sir?

377
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,876
Some men abandon all reason
before going into battle.

378
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,316
They become so seized with fear that...

379
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,888
that often the battle is lost
before it's begun.

380
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,164
I know this will not
happen with you, Timothy.

Thank you for your confidence, sir.

382
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:38,100
Sir, uh, I feel I have to tell you...

383
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,667
The men are awfully confused about
just what exactly we're fightin' for here.

384
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,443
I mean... I mean, I know, and they know,
that the liberals are our friends...

385
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,849
and the conservatives
are our enemies, but...

386
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:52,286
well, to tell you the truth, sir,
I can't tell 'em apart.

They all seem the same to me.

That is no concern of yours, Timothy,
nor of the men either.

All you have to remember...
