[yelling] You like Florida Georgia Line?

10
00:01:35,864 --> 00:01:38,407
You like annoying a man
holding a skill saw?

11
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:44,163
Somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

12
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:46,791
That would imply that I slept.

13
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:49,210
I've been layin' awake all night

14
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:51,880
thinking of this money pit
we call a ranch.

15
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:53,506
Oh, well, you should try warm milk.

16
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,550
Or tea.

17
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,053
We got a lot of work to do.

18
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:02,223
So all I want to hear
from now on is silence.

19
00:02:04,142 --> 00:02:06,477
You know, Dad,
you can't really hear silence.

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,979
It's actually the absence of all...

21
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,525
Your silence speaks volumes.

22
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:17,697
[straining] All right,
I think I got everything.

23
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:22,410
The two-by-fours, four-by-fours,
two-by-sixes...

24
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:25,454
Oh, yeah, I also brought a couple guns.

25
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:26,665
Boom!

26
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:31,252
Let's do this.

27
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,130
Oh, that's Dad's hammer.

28
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:36,340
All right. Cool story, bro.

29
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,342
[Rooster] No, no, no.

30
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:41,179
Any tool that says "Beau" on it
is off limits.

31
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:44,098
Also, any tool that says "Pedro" is mine.

32
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:45,934
I stole them from my boy Pedro.

33
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:48,602
That's enough.

34
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:51,397
You're not gonna need a hammer.
You need a shovel.

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,817
You're gonna go shovel out the bull barn.

36
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:56,945
Why can't I help up here?

37
00:02:57,946 --> 00:03:00,614
I need somebody up here
that knows what they're doing.

38
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:02,200
Well, I know what I'm doing!

39
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,703
All you're doing right now
is slowing us down.

40
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,871
And I know that, too.

41
00:03:08,998 --> 00:03:11,084
I don't see why I gotta do
all the grunt work.

42
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:14,963
[sighs] Colt, let me explain
something to you, all right?

43
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:17,506
Now, the three of us
are like a totem pole.

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,968
Dad's up on top.

45
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:23,429
He's an eagle, you know,
soaring above us all.

46
00:03:23,512 --> 00:03:26,766
He's rare, but when you catch a glimpse,
it's magical.

47
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:31,062
Now, below him is me, the rooster.

48
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,022
But, like, a badass rooster.

49
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:36,359
I'm the first one up in the morning,
and I'm on the label of hot sauce bottles.

50
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:40,071
All right, what am I?
Like, a wolf or... a lion?

51
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:41,405
[roars]

52
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:46,077
You're like a beaver, right?

53
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,370
Just swimming around,

54
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:50,581
gathering the wood and the crap
that the rooster and the eagle need

55
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,416
to build the dam
to keep the water out.

56
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,669
Wow, I am not gonna lie to you.

57
00:03:55,754 --> 00:03:58,047
I did not know where this analogy
was going when I first started,

58
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:00,383
but it is rock fucking solid.

59
00:04:04,553 --> 00:04:06,597
- Rooster?
- Yes, my eagle.

60
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,641
Shut up.

61
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:12,686
See you at lunch.

62
00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:14,939
See ya later, Beave.

63
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:21,570
You know, in 8th grade,
I used your toothbrush to scrub my balls.

64
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:29,370
Well, there he is.
We thought you were out for the night.

65
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:31,039
Dad was gonna put a blanket on you,

66
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:33,624
I was gonna come over
and draw a dick on your forehead.

67
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:38,296
- What time is it?
- 6:30.

68
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,381
You guys already ate?
You couldn't have woke me?

69
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:42,675
We eat dinner at 6:00.

70
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:44,969
I got a lot of things to do around here,

71
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:47,555
waking a grown man from his nap
isn't one of them.

72
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,599
Why didn't you say anything?

73
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:54,353
Well, I could have,
but this way I got two steaks for dinner.

74
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:58,900
Plus, I got to hear Dad
make fun of your nap for dessert. So...

75
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,361
[Beau] The meat's gone.

76
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:05,824
There's a baked potato
and half a scoop of beans there.

77
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:08,201
The meat's gone?

78
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:11,287
Hey, we working on the barn
again tomorrow?

79
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,123
We'll get the paper
and the shingles on in the morning.

80
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:16,250
We can have Colt
ride the fence on the north side,

81
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,294
see if that storm knocked any limbs down.

82
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:20,629
- [Rooster] Mmm-hmm.
- That ain't even a half a scoop.

83
00:05:20,713 --> 00:05:23,007
That's, like, four beans and a ham bone.

84
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:28,054
Don't touch that ham bone.
It's for the dog.

85
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,391
Yeah, by the way,
since when do you allow dogs in the house?

86
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:36,687
Better question would be
why I allow you and Rooster in the house.

87
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,522
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

88
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:40,358
Friendly fire there, Eagle.

89
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,527
It's beaver hunting season.

90
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:49,783
Oh, man, am I full.
I should not have eaten that second steak.

91
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:56,207
Hey, Dad, uh, I was thinking,
since we're re-doing the barn roof,

92
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,878
we could run a drain pipe
down to a cistern, catch the run-off.

93
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:02,296
It's extra water for the cattle
and irrigation.

94
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:04,257
That's a great idea.

95
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:07,676
- Thank you.
- Rooster and I were just discussing

96
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,596
how we wish we had
a few more projects around here.

97
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,766
Dad, I'm just trying to help.

98
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:18,021
Unless you got any more ideas,
I got bills to pay.

99
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:21,983
Uh, actually...
I got another idea.

100
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:25,528
I could set you up
so you could pay those bills online.

101
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:27,821
[whispering] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Pull back, man. Abort.

102
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:31,951
Why would I put my bankin' info online?

103
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:35,538
So half the population of China
can pay their bills with it, too?

104
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:40,960
Rooster, go grab a pen
and draw that dick on your brother's head.

105
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:50,303
Hey, sweetheart.

106
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:53,847
Hello to you, my sweet Margaret.

107
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:58,394
I was talking to my son.

108
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:00,229
Worth a shot.

109
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:05,484
Give me a whiskey the size you'd need
if you were still living with Dad.

110
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:19,873
- Rough day with him?
- Actually, I didn't see him all day.

111
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:24,295
He was up in the loft with Rooster.
I was scooping shit with Pedro's shovel.

112
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:29,467
Now my back is killing me.
I don't know who this Pedro guy was...

113
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,011
must've been a very short man.

114
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:35,014
Well, I still love you, sweetheart.

115
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,433
So just to be clear,

116
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:40,769
"sweetheart" is always
in reference to him?

117
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,524
Did I ever tell you about the first date
I ever had with your father?

118
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:46,817
It was on the ranch.

119
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,404
We worked all day, had dinner,
promptly at 6:00.

120
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:51,489
[chuckles]

121
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,907
I didn't even know it was a date
until he said...

122
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,160
[imitating Beau] "You wanna stay
for breakfast?"

123
00:07:56,244 --> 00:07:57,536
[chuckles]

124
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:02,166
So, what're you saying?
Dad's always been a jackass?

125
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,086
No, my point is that
every relationship with your father

126
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,380
begins with hard work on the ranch.

127
00:08:07,463 --> 00:08:10,633
And you just gotta keep proving yourself.

128
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:13,052
And that he's, you know,
always been kind of a jackass.

129
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:14,178
[chuckles]

130
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,391
Wow, look at you.

131
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,520
Abby. Hey.

132
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,438
Hey. [chuckles]

133
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:29,110
Standing at a bar
with a bottle of whiskey in your hand.

134
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:31,862
- Some things never change.
- [both chuckle]

135
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:34,657
- Hey, Mrs. Bennett.
- Hey, darlin'.

136
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,741
No!

137
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,497
- What can I get for you, Abby?
- Oh, just a water.

138
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,332
Water?

139
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,668
Huh. Well, let me check in the back.

140
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:49,630
Crazy seeing you.

141
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:52,966
Yeah.
[stammers] You look great.

142
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:55,636
- Oh.
- Uh, what you been up to?

143
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:58,389
Well, I'm teaching history
over at Garrison.

144
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,266
- Really?
- Oh, and a couple times a year,

145
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:01,892
- I put a condom on a banana.
- [laughs]

146
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,229
Right.

147
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:06,314
Sex ed?

148
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:07,565
No.

149
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:13,612
[stuttering] Why...

150
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:16,157
I'm messing with you.
It is sex ed.

151
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,908
- [both chuckle]
- All right.

152
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,618
So how about you?
What are you up to?

153
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:23,414
[stammering] Me? Come on.
I'm great! Yeah.

154
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:24,873
Things have been going good.

155
00:09:24,957 --> 00:09:28,169
I was playing football,
at the top of my game, and then...

156
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,546
Dad called and said
he needed some help at home,

157
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:35,218
so I, uh, decided it was time to be
MVP of life and not just football.

158
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:38,137
Still full of shit, huh?

159
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:39,555
[chuckles]

160
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:46,479
Wow. A Colt Bennett without football.

161
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:49,523
That's like the Battle of Hastings
without the death of King Edward.

162
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:51,150
- Right?
- [Abby chuckles]

163
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:52,651
Right.

164
00:09:55,363 --> 00:09:57,240
Is that, like, a <i>Game of Thrones</i> thing?

165
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:00,576
Are you serious?

166
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,372
- [chuckles nervously] No.
- [laughs]

167
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:08,126
I was just kidding
like you did with the banana thing.

168
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:12,130
It really is good seeing you again.

169
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:13,922
You, too.

170
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:16,342
Holy cow! [chuckles]

171
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:17,843
- I can't believe it!
- [laughs]

172
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:18,927
Colt Bennett!

173
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:21,054
Hey, buddy.
I'll sign something for you in a second.

174
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:22,223
I'm just catching up
with an old friend here.

175
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:24,850
No, actually, this is my boyfriend, Kenny.

176
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:29,105
- Oh. Yeah. Boyfriend. Nice.
- [chuckles]

177
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:31,149
Hey, nice to meet you, bud.

178
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:34,568
Colt, don't you remember?
He went to Garrison with us.

179
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,446
Oh, my God!

180
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:42,160
Kenny! Yeah!

181
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:44,787
Third period! It's...
Biology?

182
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:47,790
It's okay.
We didn't really hang in the same circles.

183
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:48,874
My big thing was band.

184
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:50,543
[laughs]

185
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:53,171
Oh, band! Yeah, cool!

186
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:55,339
Heck yeah, you guys used to play
"Eye of the Tiger"

187
00:10:55,423 --> 00:10:56,757
when we came out of the tunnel.

188
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,218
That was awesome.

189
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:04,640
[clicks tongue] Well, Kenny is the manager
of the Courtyard by Marriott in Telluride.

190
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:07,059
Well, uh, technically,
we're outside of Telluride,

191
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:10,813
but we do get a lot of business with
skiers and other winter sport enthusiasts.

192
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:13,148
Being a part of the Marriott family
is awesome.

193
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:15,526
You would not believe
the discounts he gets.

194
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,736
I mean, last year we went to Omaha.

195
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,197
Just because.

196
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,406
[laughs]

197
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:26,287
How do you even get a job like that?

198
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,622
That's a great question, Colt.
I, um...

199
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:31,500
I started out as a bellhop,
and I just worked my way up.

200
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:34,753
Most folks think you need a degree,
but, really, it's all about people skills.

201
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:38,382
The key word in "hospitality management"
is "hospitality."

202
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:39,508
[Abby chuckles]

203
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:42,470
But it's also "management."

204
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:45,848
Oh, uh, sweetie,
before I forget, I, uh...

205
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,766
booked us a room
for our anniversary.

206
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,269
- Not gonna tell you where.
- Let me guess.

207
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:51,770
The Marriott?

208
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:54,732
[clicks tongue] Dude!

209
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:58,402
Thank you.

210
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:03,616
Shoot, you know what?
I just realized I got my old man's truck,

211
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:06,702
so I gotta get it back
before it gets too late.

212
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:09,872
Oh, uh... okay.
Are you sure?

213
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:11,415
Yeah.

214
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:14,877
It's nice to see you, Abby.
You too, Kenny.

215
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,630
Yeah, hey, uh, if you ever
get sick of staying at home,

216
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:20,466
Marriott's got 4,200 locations worldwide.

217
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:24,512
Uh, I can, uh, get you
the family discount, Cousin Colt.

218
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:26,389
[laughs]

219
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:29,725
Yeah, maybe you can play
the "Eye of the Tiger" when I check in.

220
00:12:29,808 --> 00:12:30,893
Hey.

221
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:36,982
Here you go.

222
00:12:37,065 --> 00:12:39,902
Light beer.
It's the closest I could get to water.

223
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:42,195
Thanks.

224
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:46,742
- [country music playing on radio]
- There he is. Kenneth Ballard. [chuckles]

225
00:12:46,825 --> 00:12:51,997
"Activities: marching band,
jazz band...

226
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:54,124
[chuckles] French club...

227
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:57,878
chess club."

228
00:12:57,961 --> 00:13:00,130
Guess they couldn't fit "virgin club."

229
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:03,842
You know, there's a lot worse guys
in this town

230
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:05,928
- who could be dating your ex.
- Yeah, like who?

231
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:08,138
Oh, I don't know. Like me?

232
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:11,850
- Yeah, like that'd happen.
- [Rooster chuckles]

233
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:13,436
All right, full disclosure.

234
00:13:14,437 --> 00:13:19,567
One time, Fourth of July, both drunk,
back of the truck, boots on, sex.

235
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:23,362
What the hell, man?

236
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:24,905
Nah, I'm just kidding.

237
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:27,741
Or am I?

238
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:30,703
[cell phone chimes]

239
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:35,833
- Who's that?
- Oh, booty call.

240
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,669
- Linda Miller.
- Linda Miller?

241
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:43,131
Wait, is that Cute Linda
or Pregnant Linda?

242
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,635
They're both cute.

243
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:49,847
Pregnant Linda!

244
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:53,851
You're dating Pregnant Linda!

245
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,145
Come on, man,
that was her nickname in 10th grade.

246
00:13:57,229 --> 00:13:59,231
- [laughing]
- That kid's in juvie now.

247
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:03,986
But her other four are real cool.
We mostly play Xbox.

248
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,447
Any of them kids yours?

249
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,783
No, no, we are real careful.
We only have sex when she's pregnant.

250
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:15,914
Man, it is good to have you back.

251
00:14:15,998 --> 00:14:17,958
Just like old times.

252
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,586
Talking, having fun.

253
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:23,547
Plus, when I sit on the porch
and drink alone, I'm an alcoholic,

254
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:26,509
but when you're here,
it's just two brothers bonding.

255
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:30,554
Yeah. Bonding. Great.

256
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:33,265
Hey, so how long's Abby and Kenny
been going out?

257
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:35,142
I don't know.
What do you care for?

258
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:38,937
We dated all through high school.
That was, like, four years.

259
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:40,773
Maybe for you. Nerd.

260
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:46,779
I don't know, it's just weird, you know,
seeing her with another guy.

261
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:48,321
Yeah.

262
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:49,990
Kenny's pretty cool, actually.

263
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:51,700
I passed out on his porch one night,

264
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:54,202
woke up,
there was a little mint next to my head.

265
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,831
Will you two shut the hell up?

266
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,960
It was Colt.
Yeah, Colt was talking.

267
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:04,212
Want me to go inside
and get your belt?

268
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:06,048
[stutters] And your pants?

269
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:09,217
It's ten o'clock.

270
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,470
Next time I get up, we're going to work.

271
00:15:11,554 --> 00:15:14,890
So if you want to start in the middle
of the night, keep making noise.

272
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:19,978
Who in the hell's
coming up my driveway?

273
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:27,403
Looks like a blue Ranger, rally lights...
Oh, I think that's Abby's truck.

274
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:29,362
Whoa, it is Abby.

275
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:31,740
Tell her to shut the hell up, too.

276
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:38,789
[Colt] Hey, Abby!
[Rooster] Hey, what's going on?

277
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,541
[Abby sighs]

278
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,960
Hey, Colt. Rooster.

279
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,670
Hey, would you do me a favor?

280
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:47,172
When you go to school tomorrow,
could you say hey to Shari for me?

281
00:15:47,798 --> 00:15:50,258
It's the new Spanish teacher.
So hot.

282
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:55,848
She's, like, 50,
but looks at least <i>diez años</i> younger.

283
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,268
I thought you were dating Linda.

284
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:01,937
No, she's not pregnant right now.

285
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,651
Hey, I know it's late. I was just
wondering if we could talk for a second?

286
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:09,737
Yeah, no problem.
Colt, go inside.

287
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:13,657
- Rooster.
- Fine.

288
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:16,994
Abby, don't tell Colt about you and I...
[whistles]

289
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,412
You know, 'cause he gets all... [groans]

290
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,459
What are you talking about?

291
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:25,335
[chuckles] Perfect.

292
00:16:27,546 --> 00:16:29,256
Let's go over and talk by the truck.

293
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,967
We gotta keep it down unless
you wanna clean up stalls tonight.

294
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,220
Oh, sorry, your dad's asleep?

295
00:16:35,303 --> 00:16:36,639
How's he doing, by the way?

296
00:16:36,722 --> 00:16:40,225
Oh, he's good.
Told me to tell you to shut the hell up.

297
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:44,730
Wait, he yelled at me?

298
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:47,274
- Aw, he must still like me.
- [chuckles]

299
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:49,401
Yeah.

300
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:51,612
- You still got the old truck.
- Mmm.

301
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:53,280
We had our first date in this truck.

302
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:55,991
Yep. And we went to our first concert.

303
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:57,951
Billy Ray Cyrus.

304
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:00,538
The guy you called
the next Johnny Cash.

305
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:05,668
Hey, look, that ain't my fault.
He cut off his mullet.

306
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:07,335
His power was in his mullet.

307
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:10,589
[chuckles]

308
00:17:11,674 --> 00:17:12,675
Yeah.

309
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:16,804
- A lot of firsts in this truck.
- All right, take it easy.

310
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:18,514
Well, I was gonna say
the first drive-in movie.

311
00:17:18,597 --> 00:17:20,265
Get your mind out of the gutter, woman.

312
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,187
Look, Colt,
I'm sorry if I made tonight awkward.

313
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:29,357
Awkward? Come on,
I never even gave it another thought.

314
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:32,069
Well, it's not like I went
and dug my yearbook up

315
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,696
to see what this guy looked like.

316
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:36,156
So, what, do you guys
just hang out together,

317
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,200
playing chess and talking French?

318
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:41,995
I mean, you coulda
just stalked him on Facebook,

319
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,082
like I did your last girlfriend,
Jenny Roberts.

320
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,794
- Hmm.
- Her 18th birthday looked really fun.

321
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:56,426
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, that was a surprise for both of us.

322
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:06,061
Hey, uh, why'd you come
all the way out here?

323
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:09,607
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

324
00:18:11,984 --> 00:18:16,739
You coulda just called.
But instead, you drove 15 miles...

325
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,701
all the way out here,
in the middle of the night,

326
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:23,245
without your boyfriend...

327
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:25,748
just to see if I was okay.

328
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,126
Come on.

329
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:33,463
[laughs] First of all...

330
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:37,843
Kenny is on his way
to a mini-fridge expo in Boulder.

331
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,347
And second...

332
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:46,685
I felt like I wanted
to tell you in person that...

333
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:48,145
Kenny and I are in love.

334
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:52,190
Oh.

335
00:18:52,274 --> 00:18:54,610
And since we're going to be
seeing a lot of each other,

336
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:58,155
- I want to make sure it's not weird.
- Yeah, yeah. Uh...

337
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:04,577
Uh, I got to be honest, that is...

338
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:06,914
That's not the answer I was expecting.

339
00:19:06,997 --> 00:19:07,998
Um...

340
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,294
Yeah, you know...
No, it won't be weird,

341
00:19:12,377 --> 00:19:15,172
I promise when I run into you guys
in the future,

342
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:19,384
I will treat Kenny with hospitality.

343
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,056
And management.

344
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:27,726
- Good.
- Good.

345
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,103
- So it won't be awkward anymore?
- No, it won't.

346
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:32,773
That's...
No more awkwardness.

347
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,403
- After now.
- [both chuckling]

348
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:40,113
- Uh...
- Yeah, I gotta get going.

349
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:43,241
- I got a 7:00 a.m. detention.
- Detention? Wow!

350
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:47,454
I think I stopped calling it "detention"
and started calling it "homeroom."

351
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:49,622
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

352
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:52,500
Oh.

353
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:54,502
I remember this.

354
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,422
[chuckles]

355
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,386
Good to see you, Colt.

356
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:05,889
Yeah, you too, Abby.

357
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,695
Wanna do a little more bonding?

358
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:22,655
I do.

359
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:26,910
Last time I saw that truck...

360
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:29,079
me and her were in the back of it
making little Roosters.

361
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:30,748
[groans]

362
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,836
Let's see you make little Roosters now.

363
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:44,177
What the hell are you doing?

364
00:20:46,054 --> 00:20:49,266
Based on your tone,
something that pisses you off.

365
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:53,561
You know, when I was your age,
you broke a tool,

366
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:57,190
you had to craft a new one
with your own bare hands.

367
00:20:58,441 --> 00:21:00,360
Yeah, I'm gonna have to call BS
on that one.

368
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:06,074
What gave it away?
The smile on my face?

369
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:11,121
I know, I'm sorry I'm late.

370
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,623
Yeah, it's no big deal.
We're all done here.

371
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,625
Yeah, it's just,
I didn't hear the alarm, so...

372
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,211
Oh, I did. I came in there
and turned it off for you.

373
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:22,049
Hey, by the way,
how'd your toothbrush taste this morning?

374
00:21:22,132 --> 00:21:24,802
[sighing] Man, come on, not today.

375
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:28,305
Look, Dad, I'm really sorry.

376
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:31,724
It's all right, Colt.
I wasn't counting on you anyway.

377
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,685
No, you don't understand.

378
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:35,979
Abby came last night
and it really screwed me up, so...

379
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:39,149
Ah, there it is.
There's always an excuse.

380
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:42,485
This time it's a girl.
What's it gonna be next time?

381
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:45,238
I knew you were gonna pull this crap.
You always do.

382
00:21:46,698 --> 00:21:48,241
Dad, I'm here, okay?

383
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:50,327
I'm ready to work.
Just tell me what to do.

384
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,334
Here's the only thing I trust you with.

385
00:21:58,335 --> 00:21:59,461
Get me some coffee.

386
00:22:00,796 --> 00:22:02,547
You're kidding, right?

387
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:04,716
You don't know how to make coffee?

388
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,761
Uh, look, I don't mind mucking stalls
or carrying wood or riding fence,

389
00:22:08,846 --> 00:22:10,513
but I'm not gonna be your servant.

390
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:14,309
If you don't want to do the things
I ask you to do...

391
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:15,936
then I don't need you on this ranch.

392
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:19,189
- I'm not gonna get you coffee!
- Then get the hell out of here.

393
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:25,195
I'm just gonna remove this here
potential murder weapon up out of the way.

394
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:28,823
- Fine.
- Fine.

395
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:31,368
[scoffs] I'm out of here then.

396
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,751
You know what I'm gonna do?

397
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,711
I'm gonna go get you that coffee.

398
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:44,631
I love you, Daddy.

399
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:50,845
Give me a break, you know?

400
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:52,973
It's just Dad. I mean, you know,
he gets pissed at everything.

401
00:22:53,056 --> 00:22:55,683
Yeah, I know. I remember the Halloween
when the kid came to the door

402
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:58,603
and said, "Trick or treat,"
and Dad said, "Smith or Wesson."

403
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:01,648
It's different with me and him.

404
00:23:02,274 --> 00:23:04,359
Yeah, all right, he's tough on you.

405
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:06,194
Well, guess what,
he's tough on me, too.

406
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:07,654
Well, then come with me.

407
00:23:07,737 --> 00:23:10,532
I'm sure I can get us a great rate
at a Marriott in Omaha.

408
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:13,160
Oh, yeah, that's a...
that's a great idea.

409
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:14,286
You know, we'll both bail.

410
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:16,704
Dad will lose the ranch,
but we can always come back here and visit

411
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:18,415
when this place turns into an Applebee's.

412
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,042
Then stay!

413
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,127
You know, we're all playing our roles.

414
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,711
You're the good son.

415
00:23:23,795 --> 00:23:25,172
I'm leaving.

416
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,468
Man... [sighs] things were
just getting great here.

417
00:23:30,552 --> 00:23:33,055
Great here?
What is great about this?

418
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:34,264
Remember last night,

419
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:36,558
you were having girl problems,
I was making fun of you?

420
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:37,935
That was awesome!

421
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:39,811
No, it wasn't!

422
00:23:39,894 --> 00:23:42,897
'Cause I still don't know whether or not
you had sex with my ex-girlfriend.

423
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:45,442
Let's not get caught up
in all that kind of stuff.

424
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:46,609
Hey!

425
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:50,155
Look, man,
you're my little brother, okay?

426
00:23:50,238 --> 00:23:51,656
I don't want to lose you again.

427
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:56,661
Sorry.

428
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:02,500
[Colt] What the hell are you doing, man?

429
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:05,128
If you leave now,
Dad is not letting you back in here.

430
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:06,213
[Colt] Get off of me!

431
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:09,882
You're not leaving! [grunts]

432
00:24:18,516 --> 00:24:21,186
Hey, after dinner,
you wanna watch something?

433
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:22,354
Like what?

434
00:24:22,437 --> 00:24:24,939
I don't know.
Something on Netflix?

435
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,110
What the fuck is Netflix?

436
00:24:32,197 --> 00:24:33,490
Never mind.

437
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:35,450
[chuckles]

438
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:37,035
I heard a good joke today. So...

439
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:40,372
a horse walks into a bar, right?

440
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:42,624
Why would a horse walk into a bar?

441
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:45,335
To get a drink.

442
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,464
It's a horse.
He'd drink outside in a trough.

443
00:24:50,548 --> 00:24:52,634
Well, this horse
wanted something stronger.

444
00:24:53,676 --> 00:24:55,387
Horses don't drink alcohol.

445
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,638
This one does.

446
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,934
And no one else in the bar is reacting
to the fact that a horse walked in?

447
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,646
Yeah.

448
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:06,731
All right, yeah,
a couple of people react.

449
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:08,900
They're real surprised,
but then they get over it.

450
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:12,070
[sighs] So...

451
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:14,906
the horse walks up
to the bartender and says,

452
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:17,200
- "Hey, I would like a Jack and Coke."
- Wait.

453
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:18,493
Now the horse can talk?

454
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,376
Can I just finish my joke?

455
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:30,880
- Let me tell you one.
- Go ahead.

456
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,549
- Knock knock.
- Who's there?

457
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:34,051
- Do the dishes.
- Funny.

458
00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:40,848
You better hide your toothbrush tonight.

459
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:47,230
You know...
[sighs]

460
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:51,109
maybe it's none of my business,
but weren't you a little hard on Colt?

461
00:25:53,695 --> 00:25:54,696
You're right.

462
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:58,075
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

463
00:25:58,158 --> 00:25:59,992
It's none of your business.

464
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:03,205
You know, he's just like you.

465
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:05,039
He is nothing like me.

466
00:26:05,748 --> 00:26:08,000
Only reason this whole thing blew up?

467
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:10,462
'Cause you're both too stubborn
to admit it's either one of your fault.

468
00:26:10,545 --> 00:26:12,589
That is absolutely not true.

469
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,882
[chuckles] Okay.

470
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:16,551
Let me ask you something.

471
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,846
What would happen to this place if I died?

472
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:23,225
After the party?

473
00:26:25,893 --> 00:26:27,687
I mean, obviously, I would run it.

474
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:29,481
What if we both died?

475
00:26:29,564 --> 00:26:32,692
What's happening here? Is this,
like, a murder-suicide kind of thing?

476
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:39,991
Colt would sell all the livestock,
sell the ranch, piss the money away,

477
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:42,244
and no good would ever come of it.

478
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,662
Well, that's not true.

479
00:26:44,746 --> 00:26:47,332
A lot of strippers in Denver
would get new boobies.

480
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,709
[Beau smacks lips]

481
00:26:52,629 --> 00:26:54,922
Your brother is a 34-year-old child.

482
00:26:56,341 --> 00:27:00,178
I'm just trying to prepare him
for the rest of his life.

483
00:27:00,928 --> 00:27:04,182
If that means I have to push him,
so be it.

484
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:07,560
[inhales sharply] Well,
you pushed him all right.

485
00:27:07,644 --> 00:27:09,729
Pushed him right out the door.

486
00:27:09,812 --> 00:27:13,275
Congratulations, Pop. You win.

487
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,360
[door closes]

488
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:19,406
[Colt] You ever think about
getting a bigger place, Mom?

489
00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:21,783
Why? I like it here.

490
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:25,328
You know, I've found that
the happier you are, the less you need.

491
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:29,832
Your father has a 1,500-acre ranch.

492
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:34,003
You know, I think Dad
needs another 1,500 acres.

493
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,133
What about you, Colt?
What'll it take to make you happy?

494
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:41,886
[sighs] Oh... I don't know.

495
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:44,556
Old whiskey and young blondes. [chuckles]

496
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:48,226
If it's closing time,
young whiskey and old blondes.

497
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:52,730
Dodging the deep questions,
a long-standing Bennett tradition.

498
00:27:52,814 --> 00:27:54,357
Well, what do you want me to say?

499
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:57,277
I know I don't like taking crap from Dad.
That don't make me happy.

500
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,946
Well, no one said working with him
was gonna be easy.

501
00:28:01,906 --> 00:28:05,910
Yeah, well, I don't mind doing
the grunt work and being the beaver,

502
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:07,454
but I ain't gonna be his servant.

503
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,083
Well, you know,
you've gotta understand that Dad's...

504
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:16,379
He's in free fall now 'cause of the ranch.
He's in crisis mode.

505
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:19,841
And...
did you just call yourself a beaver?

506
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,760
It's a totem pole thing.

507
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:25,972
And by the way, the bottom of
the totem pole is the most important part,

508
00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:27,890
'cause it holds up the whole pole.
It's all about the base.

509
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:30,435
- It's like that song.
- Okay, wait. Focus, honey.

510
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:33,313
Focus on what?
The fact that Dad is impossible?

511
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:35,690
I'm... I'm sure your dad
is being unfair, all right?

512
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:38,568
Because, you know,
your dad can be unfair.

513
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:40,612
But you have a part in this, too.

514
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:45,116
You know, when the going gets tough,
you have a tendency to run.

515
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,868
No, I don't.

516
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:48,870
You're sitting on a suitcase, son.

517
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:52,540
All right, but you got this one wrong, Ma.

518
00:28:52,624 --> 00:28:53,750
- This is totally different.
- Okay.

519
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,211
I mean, he's got it out for me.
That's what it is.

520
00:28:56,294 --> 00:28:59,464
Oh, so there's absolutely no way
that I'm right?

521
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:00,840
No.

522
00:29:00,923 --> 00:29:03,843
Right, you're dead certain you're right
and won't listen to reason.

523
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:06,178
Huh!
You're just like him.

524
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:10,392
He's a stubborn, temperamental asshole!

525
00:29:11,226 --> 00:29:12,352
So we agree.

526
00:29:45,176 --> 00:29:46,761
[Rooster groaning]

527
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,057
- Morning.
- We got a lot of work to do today.

528
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,351
Oh, I slept fine, thanks.
How about you?

529
00:29:54,644 --> 00:29:55,895
Whoa.

530
00:29:56,813 --> 00:29:59,566
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

531
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:03,570
I know you got a busy day.
I made you breakfast sandwiches.

532
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:07,407
Oh... nice. Ham and Swiss.

533
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:11,494
For future reference,
the rooster likes provolone.

534
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:17,709
Come on, we got that 20 pair
to move to the south pasture.

535
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:20,002
Oh, hey, hang on.

536
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:21,796
Made you coffee.

537
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:27,969
Thanks.

538
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:33,600
You comin' or what?

539
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:44,611
- Hey, you wanna hear a joke?
- No.

540
00:30:44,694 --> 00:30:45,903
[chuckles]

541
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:48,406
Hey. A horse walks into a bar.

542
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:51,283
Why would a horse walk into a bar?

543
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,913
You think that's bad, it talks, too.

544
00:30:57,999 --> 00:31:00,543
Man, I'm glad you're back.

545
00:31:00,627 --> 00:31:02,128
Thanks. [groans]

546
00:31:07,384 --> 00:31:09,386
