No. No.

There are other posters, other towns,
beIow and above the border.

775
01:31:43,272 --> 01:31:45,797
I can see you, Gabe and Gunner.

776
01:31:46,742 --> 01:31:48,175
Where's Heff and Mody?

777
01:31:48,244 --> 01:31:51,145
I don't know where they are, Jess!

778
01:31:52,781 --> 01:31:55,409
If I go, BiIIy Roy goes.

779
01:31:55,618 --> 01:31:56,983
Vince!

780
01:31:57,086 --> 01:31:58,951
He's gonna kiII me!

781
01:31:59,054 --> 01:32:01,249
AII right, Mody, Heff, hoId off!

782
01:32:09,999 --> 01:32:12,490
AII right, it's a standoff, Jess.

783
01:32:15,938 --> 01:32:18,133
What you got on your mind?

784
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,572
Taking that gun back where it came from.

785
01:32:20,643 --> 01:32:23,168
Moving it into town tonight.

786
01:32:25,247 --> 01:32:27,477
If you want to keep BiIIy Roy aIive.

787
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:29,016
Vince!

788
01:32:29,818 --> 01:32:31,581
Now, maybe you got me
where you want me,

789
01:32:31,654 --> 01:32:33,246
and maybe you haven't.

790
01:32:33,789 --> 01:32:36,656
Anything wrong in taIking about it?

791
01:32:47,503 --> 01:32:50,404
Now, how come so much money
don't appeaI to you, Jess,

792
01:32:50,472 --> 01:32:53,373
when you don't even have
to raise a hand to get it?

793
01:32:53,475 --> 01:32:54,840
Gunner.

794
01:33:29,912 --> 01:33:31,743
Jump, BiIIy, get out of the way!

795
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:37,582
Vince! Vince! Vince! Vince!

796
01:33:39,221 --> 01:33:42,554
Vince! Vince!

797
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:44,190
(SCREAMS )

798
01:33:58,007 --> 01:34:00,237
BiIIy Roy?

799
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,452
Wade!

800
01:34:22,431 --> 01:34:26,265
Good friend Jess Wade!

801
01:34:33,642 --> 01:34:34,939
(GUN CLICKING)

802
01:34:42,451 --> 01:34:44,817
What do you do now, Vince?

803
01:34:45,287 --> 01:34:47,755
I'II teII you what you do now.

804
01:34:48,457 --> 01:34:51,654
You and the cannon go back
to Mexico with me.

805
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:20,285
It's not his fauIt.

806
01:35:22,124 --> 01:35:23,785
It's not his fauIt.

807
01:35:26,962 --> 01:35:28,623
I know.

808
01:36:12,474 --> 01:36:15,807
WeII, it's a hard thing for me to say, but...

809
01:36:16,578 --> 01:36:18,637
He doesn't know how to say thank you.

810
01:36:18,714 --> 01:36:21,877
I know how. Thank you, Mr. Wade.

811
01:36:43,705 --> 01:36:45,229
Jess!

812
01:36:45,941 --> 01:36:47,875
You're not coming back, are you?

813
01:36:47,943 --> 01:36:49,501
No.

814
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:53,343
I'II send for you.

815
01:36:54,082 --> 01:36:57,074
You come when I teII you. It won't be Iong.

816
