But here in the Nation,

They call us civilized because
we're easy to sneak up on.

They sneaked up on us and they
told us we wouldn't be happy here.

They said we would be happier
in the Nations.

452
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:34,082
So they took away our land...

453
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,209
...and sent us here.

464
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,630
We wore them because we belonged to...

"Boy! You boys sure look civilized!"

470
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,365
He congratulated us...

471
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:52,494
...and he gave us medals
for looking so civilized.

472
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:56,456
We told him about how
our land had been stolen...

473
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,000
...and our people were dying.

474
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:03,380
When we finished,
he shook our hands...

475
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:04,965
...and said:

476
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,843
"Endeavor to persevere."

Nasty habit, young fellow.

648

Hold it. Real still.

650
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:25,945
The wheat is from Kansas and the
molasses comes from Missouri.

651
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:27,655
We'll do without molasses.

652

Anything from Missouri
has a taint about it.

653

Grandma, you've got to tread lightly
now we're here in Texas.

Lots of nice elements from
Missouri coming West.

655

Nothing nice comes from Missouri.

I don't know. Various things.
I'm only the salesman.

Well, what can you expect
from a nonbeliever?

672

That old lady don't know the trouble
she can get into talking like that.

673
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:02,458
Too many folks around here
with thin skin.

674
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:05,461
Lots of Southern boys
been getting into trouble here.

Cullen Baker and Captain Bob Lee

Bill Longley, Creed Taylor...

...and all them other Taylors
down in Gonzalez.

678

Killed Simp Dixon over in Cotton Gin...

679
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:20,225
...weighted him down with lead.

680
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:23,771

Regulators are all over the place
looking for him.

687
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:48,629
How much for all this?

688
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,089
Three dollars.

689
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,925
Those regulators would pay plenty...

690
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,261
...to the man who could
identify Josey Wales.

691
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,473
Reckon so.

How about you, sir?

693
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:14,446
Just a few bottles left.
You won't regret it.

694

Oh, my God!

695

It's Josey Wales!

or whistle "Dixie"?

JOSEY:
Welcome to Texas, Mr. Lone Watie.

701
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:48,100
I guess we ain't going to see that
little Navajo girl again.

702
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,060
I guess not.

703
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,271
I kind of liked her.

704
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,940
-But it's always like that.
-Like what?

705
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,819
Whenever I get to liking someone,
they ain't around long.

706
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:03,991
I notice when you get to disliking someone
they ain't around long neither.

707
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:10,122
How did you know which one
was going to shoot first?

708
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:13,792
That one in the center
had a flap holster...

709
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:16,128
...and he was in no itching hurry.

710
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,630
And the one second from the left...

711
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,300
...had scared eyes.
He wasn't going to do nothing.

712
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,385
But that one on the far left...

713
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:27,180
...had crazy eyes.
Figured him to make the first move.

714
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:28,891
And the one on the right?

715
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:35,981
Never paid no him no mind.

716
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,357
You were there.

717
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,323
I could have missed.

718
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:47,367
SHOPKEEPER: Yes, sir!
It was Josey Wales, all right!

719
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,704
Saw him heading north out of town
with a renegade Injun.

720
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,332
I can identify him.

721
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:57,669
And I'd certainly be glad
to share in any reward.

722
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,048
Knew him quite well, actually.

723
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:06,261
Well, not a hard man to track.

724
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,222
Leaves dead men wherever he goes.

725
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,184
He's heading north now...

726
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,728
...riding with a renegade Indian.

727
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:18,523
He's heading north now,
but he'll turn southwest...

728
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:20,192
...head for Mexico.

729
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:23,278
Then we'll turn southwest
and head for Mexico.

730
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,697
Tell them to head north.

731

732

Look at those boys over there
with tied-down guns.

Every last mother's son of them wants
that money you've got on Wales' head.

736
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,056
You and me didn't ride
all that way for that.

737
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:55,060
I don't want to hear Wales is dead.

738
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:58,730
I want to see Wales dead.

739
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,779
We're heading north, men. Let's ride.

740

They're following us.

741
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:35,100
Couple of horses, far off, moving fast.

those things.

Yeah. All right, let's take them
out in the sand.

Glad you stopped me when you did.
I might have killed her.

746

Oh, I noticed that.

747
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,618

That's always a good idea.

Yeah. Sure pays to have an edge.

I heard a joke about Missouri once.

Something about how people
from Missouri...

Hello, Mr. Wilson.

...about an outlaw passed through
this way a while back.

I don't suppose you'd know
about him but--

...he went up against five

He got three of them

Could have even been 10.

Alive? No sir.
