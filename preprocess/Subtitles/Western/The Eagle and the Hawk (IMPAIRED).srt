and came to see me.

He told me a story.
I agreed to help him.

65
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:08,155
I furnished him an escort,
they became separated

66
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,959
And Mr. Randolph
was picked up by a patrol
of the Confederate cavalry.

67
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,794
When I learned of it,
I sent for you,

And as usual,
you carried out your orders

speed and dispatch.

we've lost two big shipments.

We've traced them to a town in
northern Mexico called Corrales.

as the border at least.

of playing nurse to a Yank.

rounding up deserters.

157
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,216
You mean to tell me, sir,
that there's Texans

158
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,352
Who refuse to fight
for their glorious state?

159
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:49,189
Not Texans...
Yanks who came to Texas.

I don't mind the Indians,
but Confederate cavalry,

161
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:56,463
I'd have a hard time
explaining what I'm doing
with a Yankee spy.

162
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,765
That's Confederate cavalry.

Let's get out of here.

Don't shoot,
they're friends!

You call that friendly?

[Whitney] Phew! Whoa!
They're turning back.

167
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,753
They had to.
That's the Rio Grande.

168
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,556
Ah. That was a close one.

169
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,659
I'd hate to be stopped
by a Texas bullet.

- Shall we, uh...
- [shakes dice]

To see who
rescues her, Mr. Croyden?

00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:09,229
You can have her, Mr. Randolph,
I'll take the water.

She thinks we're bandits.

Don't argue with her.

She waits for that army
to fix that carriage,

Nope, if there's
a reason you should.

I don't wanna miss the fun.

Well, if you feel that you
can spare an hour or two,

296
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:03,329
I might have a message
for you to take back

Punching cattle pays good.

299
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:18,110
Or is that too peaceful?

300
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,912
That depends.

301
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,715
- Punching for you?
- Nah.

You know where I can
get a boot repaired?

307
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,734
And a busted holster fixed?

308
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:45,437
There's a boot shop,
zapateria, down the street.

309

Much obliged.

ain't looking for cowhands.

You know, nurse, you got the
makings of a first-rate spy.

[Speaking Spanish]

316
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,336
The heel to the boot,
she's unstuck.

317
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:54,373
- The... [speaks Spanish]
- Oh. [Speaks Spanish]

318
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:57,176
The heel,
she's unstuck, senor.

What do you want?

321
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:25,537
I've lost a heel and my friend
would like to get
a holster fixed.

322
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,473
I am busy.

323
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:33,980
Too busy to talk to a friend
of theirs, Roberto?

324
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:40,820
President Juarez has
a great admiration for
your Abraham Lincoln.

325
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,055
What has that to do with me?

326
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,105
Take off your boot.

327
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:01,974
[Speaks Spanish]

328
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:20,159
What do you want of me,
Senor Randolph?

329
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,994
I'm looking for
a Captain Brooks.

330
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,196
Have you seen or heard
anything of him?

331
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,336
Captain Brooks is dead.

332
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,942
He was dead
when we found him.

333
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:38,377
I put up a cross.
I could do no more.

334
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,012
Thanks.

335
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,281
I do not care to
put up any more crosses,

336
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,683
Or have one put over me.

337
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,418
Nor do I.

338
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,620
Then you must work
with extreme caution.

339
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,523
There's a man named Danzeeger
behind what is going on here.

340
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,294
He has spies everywhere,
mostly renegade Americans.

341
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:56,863
You mean like that fella
at the cantina?

342
00:29:56,963 --> 00:30:00,299
Yes. He watches
the newcomers in town.

343
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,935
What do you know
of this man, Danzeeger?

344
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:05,237
It is rumored that he is
a cashiered German army officer.

345
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,706
But we know
nothing for certain.

346
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,375
Except that he
has plenty of money

347
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,143
With which to pay El Gavilan
and his soldiers.

348
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:14,646
- Who?
- El Gavilan. The Hawk.

349
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,882
That is what
General Liguras,

350
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:18,084
Who leads the army,
calls himself.

351
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:21,954
- And, uh, what of him?
- A poor, misguided fool, senor.

352
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:26,392
In these troublesome times,
any man who can
gather a thousand men

353
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,727
Will call himself a general.

354
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,863
He is, at heart,
a loyal Mexican.

355
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:33,099
Of that I am sure.

356
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:35,101
But he's not
an educated man

357
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:38,237
- and could easily be misled.
- [Whitney] By Danzeeger?

358
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,739
- Who else?

[Speaking Spanish]

360
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:55,054
There, you see for yourself.
The Hawk returns with
the payroll for his army.

361
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:57,289
There will be dancing
in the streets tonight,

362
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:00,292
As there always is
when the soldiers are paid.

363
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,596
Sit down, please.
They are coming here.

364
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:13,672
Pick up boots for El Gavilan.

365
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:16,108
- They are ready, muchacho?
- They are ready, General.

366
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,478
Pedro, my boots.

Oh! These are the best of all.

You have done well, muchacho.

Ah! [Speaks Spanish]

00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,512
You make another pair for
Liguras right away, eh?

376
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,181
[Speaks Spanish]

377
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,984
The boots.

378
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,952
- You take these.
- [speaks Spanish]

379
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:02,388
Adios, Roberto.

380
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:27,346
Now that General Liguras
is a man of wealth,

381
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,149
He buys a new pair of boots
each month.

382
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:32,284
Well, at least
we know his weakness.

383
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,587
You never can tell when a thing
like that will pay off.

384
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,357
Agreed. What are your plans?

385
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:42,394
I'd like to start with
a visit to Brooks' grave.

386
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:45,031
Meet me a mile south
of town in an hour

387
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,898
And I will take you there.

388
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:48,534
If you need any lodgings,

389
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:51,803
See the good Senora Alvarez
and tell her I sent you.

390
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,472
Thank you, Roberto.

391
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:27,239
We saw the buzzards circling
even before he was dead.
That's how we found him.

392
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:31,377
He spoke more like an
Englishman than an American.

393
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:34,546
A transplanted Englishman,
Roberto.

394
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:37,083
What had they done to him?

395
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:39,651
They tied him
between wild horses.

396
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,587
An old Indian custom.

397
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:44,956
But this was not
the work of Indians.

398
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:47,826
The thongs that tied him
were not deer hide,

399
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:51,130
They were rope.
American rope.

400
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,200
There is no worse torture.

401
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,535
The headlong fight
of wild and broken Mustangs,

402
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:59,571
Pulling at the arms and legs
of the man tied between them,

403
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:03,242
Is more than human courage
can endure.

404
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:04,976
When the arms are pulled
from their sockets...

405
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:06,412
Who did it?

406
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,116
One dares not ask.

407
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:13,252
One can only grope in the dark
for the answer.

408
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,590
I see an army gathering
in the mountains.

409
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:24,963
I see the pockets of honest
field workers turned soldiers
lined with silver.

410
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,567
And I hear a general boast that
he will lead an army into Tejas,

411
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:32,904
When guns and ammunitions
come from Presidente Juarez.

412
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,874
The governor was right.

413
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,576
Do they speak of
this plan openly?

414
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,778
[Roberto] Oh, yes.

415
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,147
Oh...

416
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:45,050
No, there's more to this
than meets the eye.

417
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:48,520
Brooks was not killed
for finding that out.

418
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,291
Juarez has hardly enough
guns and ammunition
to defend himself.

419
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:56,061
Why should he send them
to this... this Liguras?

420
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:58,330
Besides, Juarez is
building for the future,

421
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,500
He's not concerned
with the past.

422
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,869
No. No, my friend,

423
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:06,372
Brooks was not killed
for that.

424
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:08,039
He was killed
for something else.

425
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,477
Agreed, amigo, but no word
comes from Juarez himself.

426
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,379
He is bottled up
by the French,

427
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:16,882
Yet Danzeeger says
he's an agent from Juarez.

428
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,251
I do not believe him.

429
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:23,121
I don't think Brooks
believed him either.

430
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:25,257
That's why they killed him.

431
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:35,501
[Todd] Odd that an
Englishman should be
fighting for your cause.

432
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,536
Not so odd.

your message, nurse,
you can leave anytime now.

about leaving?

Decide to stick around?

443
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,021
How about your friend?

444
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:38,957
We hit the same trail,

445
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,760
We don't ask each other where
we've been or where we're going.

446
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,962
Or why.

447

A fellow lives longer
that way.

He sure does
in this town.

Wrap yourself in your
own tarp, I always say.

450

We've, uh...
met before someplace.

What were you saying about
wrapping yourself

We were talking.

That's very good,
you're fast.

00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:06,311
- Todd what?
- Just Todd.

472
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:08,747
My mother was
closed-mouthed, too.

473
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,549
Well...

474
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:12,551
Well, you gentlemen got more
out of him in your first meeting

475
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:17,456
Than I did eating out of
the same frying pan with him
for two weeks.

476
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:20,859
- Nice to know you, Mr. Todd.
- Hello.

477
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,297
Since curiosity seems to be
a disease around these parts,

478
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:28,734
I shall cure it forthwith.

479
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,703
- Mm. I'll have one of these.
- [man speaks Spanish]

480
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,539
My name is Whitney Randolph.

481
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:36,007
I am not seeking occupation
of an outdoor nature

482
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,510
And I frown on the
indiscriminate use of firearms.

483
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:44,616
Gracias. The latter being
the chief reason
for my presence here.

484
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,454
Have you a dice cup, muchacho?

485
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:52,791
Now, anything else, gentlemen,

486
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,761
Before I lure someone
into a game of chance?

487
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:58,564
Is that how
you make your living?

488
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,432
Know a better way, friend?

489
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,568
Yeah, poker.

490
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:03,802
You can play it
sitting down.

491
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,637
Ah, a man after my own heart,

492
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,740
Hating even the slightest
suggestion of exercise.

493
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,975
Dice...

494
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,014
While a
fascinating pastime...

495
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,585
How do you do?

496
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:22,287
Does overdevelop the muscles
of the throwing arm

497
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:24,456
And put calluses on the knees.

498
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:27,826
Now, it, uh, just so happens...

499
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:32,864
No hard feelings, but I
like the cards here better.

500
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:35,333
The backs got prettier
pictures on them.

501
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,903
An art lover appears
in the wilderness.

502
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:39,871
Shall we?

503
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,079
I'll peg you yet.

504
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,517
Keep working on it.

505
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,734
- Hello.
- Hi.

506
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,805
[Hoofbeats approaching]

507
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:30,055
[Woman laughing]

508
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,860
Hello. Remember me?

509
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,563
Without the whiskers, I mean.

510
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:39,631
Yes, of course.

511
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,166
Uh... This is Mr...

512
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:44,335
- Todd's the name.
- Mr. Danzeeger.

513
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,038
I found your daughter sitting
in the middle of a creak

514
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,841
With a broken wheel
on her carriage.

515
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:51,943
Oh?

516
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:55,814
My daughter didn't
mention the incident.

517
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:58,984
Oh, it was nothing, really.
Not worth mentioning.

518
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:02,287
Nevertheless, I'm very happy
to be able to thank Mr., uh...

519
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:03,722
Todd, you said the name was?

520
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,957
[Todd] That's as good as any.
Isn't it?

521
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:08,627
It's as good
or better than most.

522
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,495
You know, there aren't
very many men around here

523
00:42:10,596 --> 00:42:14,265
That I'd care to trust
with my daughter, Mr. Todd.

524
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,501
[Todd] I can understand that.

525
00:42:16,602 --> 00:42:19,170
[Danzeeger] You plan to
stay long in Corrales?

526
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:22,107
If the climate agrees with me.

527
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,442
My health wasn't
too good up north.

528
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,312
- How far north?
- Texas.

529
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:30,716
There's a war on up there.
Or... hadn't you heard?

530
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:33,719
Oh, yes. Yes, I've heard.

531
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:36,154
You, being a peace-loving man,
came to Corrales

532
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:39,457
In preference to, uh,
fighting, is that it?

533
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:43,729
- That's about it.
- I have a number of men
in my employ who, uh,

534
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,731
Feel the same way about it.

535
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:50,068
Perhaps our Mr. Hyatt here can
talk you into working for me?

536
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,838
I think I could be argued
into that without...

537
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:55,774
- too much trouble.
- [Danzeeger] Good.

538
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:58,810
- [speaking Spanish]
- [shouting, cheering]

539
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,993
You will honor me
with a dance?

540
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,162
I'm very sorry,
General, but...

541
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,965
Well, I'm rather tired after
my long trip from Monterrey.

542
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:22,367
Excuse me, won't you?
We were just leaving.

543
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:24,102
[Danzeeger] You understand,
I'm sure, General.

544
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:26,304
Si, I understand.
The lady is tired.

545
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:29,607
- Buenas noches.
- Buenas noches, General.

546
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,209
Guillermo.

547
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:42,420
* Oh, I come from Alabama
with a banjo on my knee *

548
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,225
* I come from Alabama
My true love for to see *

549
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:49,828
* Oh, Susanna...

550
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:54,733
* Oh, Susanna
Don't you cry for...*

551
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,367
[Door opening]

552
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:01,506
Oh, good night,
Senora Alvera.

553
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:05,877
- And, uh, gracias.
- [woman speaks Spanish]

554
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:11,482
I'd have been here sooner,
only my companions
were careful players.

555
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:15,954
They were as reluctant
to part with their words
as they were with their wages.

556
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:21,960
I guess I'd never make
a first-rate spy.

557
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,295
Not good enough
at gambling.

558
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,132
I'll give you another lesson
one of these days.

559
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:30,101
If we're both still
alive and kicking.

560
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:31,703
Somebody...

561
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:36,307
Somebody's playing an
awful rough game up here.

562
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,443
Somebody named Danzeeger?

563
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:44,750
Danzeeger, Liguras,
perhaps both.

564
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:48,954
At any rate, it's Liguras
who winds up with the chips.

565
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:51,923
Did you find out
anything else?

566
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:56,427
Uh-huh. Liguras' force
numbers about 1,500 men,

567
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,363
Most of 'em unarmed.

568
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:03,401
Give these a gentle rinsing,
will you, nursey?

569
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:07,272
And get blood poisoning?

570
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,808
Anything else?

571
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:12,243
Several interesting things.

572
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:15,613
It, uh, took me a little longer
than I expected,

573
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,816
But I finally found out
what I wanted to know.

574
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:19,584
[Sniffs] Roberto was right,

575
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:24,689
Liguras is waiting for guns
and ammunition from Juarez.

576
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:28,894
- Hm. Heliotrope.
- Wait a minute.

577
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:31,029
Didn't you just lose
two big shipments of arms?

578
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:33,865
Didn't you trace them here?
Well...

579
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:36,768
Every once in a while,
you meet a bright Texan.

580
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:38,736
You're right again.

581
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:41,940
Somebody is double-crossing
somebody.

582
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,009
The question is
who's doing it to who?

583
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:48,980
Hm... [tsks] "To whom,"
my uncouth friend, "to whom."

584
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:54,085
Well, I know that I'll lay my
hard-earned pesos on Danzeeger.

585
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,721
What's he doing with
a private army of thugs?

586
00:45:56,822 --> 00:46:00,425
And where does he get the money
to pay Liguras and his soldiers?

587
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:03,995
- Just what is he up to?
- When you find that out,

588
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,465
You'll find out who killed
your friend Brooks. And why.

589
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,669
That's exactly what
I mean, Mr. Croyden.

590
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,872
Eh? What do you say?

591
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:16,441
Shall, uh, we have a look?

592
00:46:18,043 --> 00:46:21,346
I'll cover Danzeeger.
He offered me a job.

593
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,081
Good. I'll take Liguras.

594
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:25,616
Oh, by the way, have you
recalled where Hyatt met you?

595
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:26,985
Yeah. [Chuckles]

596
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:28,453
I got a better memory
than he's got.

597
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:31,389
El Paso bank hold-up.
I threw a slug at him.

598
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,391
He should be packing a piece
of lead in him somewhere.

599
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:36,661
He was, uh,
running away at the time.

600
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:38,096
Oh.

601
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:42,433
Seems to me you're taking
quite a chance, son.

602
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,369
Didn't you say the worst thing
that could happen to you

603
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,804
In the spy business
is getting killed?

604
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:50,575
Ooh. [Groans]

605
00:46:50,675 --> 00:46:52,577
Water. Where's water?

606
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:54,012
Oh, here. I'll get it.

607
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:00,085
Well, give it to me.

608
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:28,179
Keep a straight line.
Keep in formation!

609
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:30,181
At least they make
a frightening noise.

610
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:33,084
They're supposed
to be cavalry men.

611
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,223
[Guns firing]

612
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,715
Mr. Todd,
men come to Corrales

613
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,985
For two reasons.

614
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:08,987
Sometimes they're chased
across the border,

615
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:10,821
These men I can use.

616
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:12,958
Sometimes they're sent
across the border,

617
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:15,060
These men I can't use.

618
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,929
[Chuckles] You should have seen
the chunk of border I crossed.

619
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:21,933
Mm, yes,
perhaps I should have.

620
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:25,971
Listen, mister.
I came here looking for work.

621
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:29,474
All I ask is...
what's the pay?

622
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:32,177
Pay's good.
A man can become rich.

623
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:35,180
That's what this man
would like to become.

624
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,749
No curiosity about
my little army?

625
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:42,887
You want a private army of

That's a pretty song.

787
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:16,380
It's an old French love song.

788
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,018
- French?
- I learned it at school
in Paris.

789
01:05:21,118 --> 01:05:25,155
It will always
remind me of... someone.

790
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,591
A girl in Texas, perhaps?

791
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:29,726
Young and sweet?

792
01:05:29,826 --> 01:05:31,828
Like this song?

793
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,331
* I dream of Jeannie

794
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:39,636
* With the light brown hair

795
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:44,541
There is a girl somewhere,
isn't there, Todd?

796
01:05:44,641 --> 01:05:46,110
Maybe.

797
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:47,877
Maybe there are
a lot of girls.

798
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:49,679
[Distant knocking]

799
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,449
- Keep playing.
- [man] Someone's
in the powder house!

800
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:56,286
- [continues playing]
- Someone special, I mean.

801
01:05:56,386 --> 01:05:57,687
Waiting?

802
01:05:58,655 --> 01:05:59,956
If there was,

803
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:02,226
You could make
a man forget her.

804
01:06:02,326 --> 01:06:04,194
[Man] Hey, Mack, Brownie...

805
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,762
You could make a man
forget a lot of things

806
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:08,132
Like sentries
outside his window

807
01:06:08,232 --> 01:06:10,834
Or guards sleeping
on his saddle blankets.

808
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:13,903
- Yes?
- I could use some help,

809
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:16,406
Something with
a saddle on it.

810
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:18,708
- [man] Open the gate!
- [man 2] Spread out!

811
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,745
[Indistinct shouting continues]

812
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:23,680
Come with me.

813
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:29,319
What happened?

814
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:31,088
I just remembered who I am,

815
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:32,956
And word is getting around
quick out there.

816
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:34,891
What are you going to do?

817
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,560
I've gotta get out of here.

818
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,729
- But I'll be back, I promise.
- No, don't promise.

819
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,098
You'd be foolish
enough to try,

820
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:43,300
And they'd only kill you
as they did Brooks.

821
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,804
- Why did they kill Brooks?
- Don't try to find out.

822
01:06:47,904 --> 01:06:50,240
Promise you'll go away
and not come back.

823
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,676
I want you to live, Todd.

824
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,947
[Knocking]

825
01:06:58,048 --> 01:07:01,051
Give me ten minutes,
then drop over the wall
into the storehouse.

826
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:03,019
I'll manage
your horse somehow.

827
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,589
[Men continue shouting]

828
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:09,259
[Door opens, closes]

829
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,181
[Shouting in Spanish]

830
01:07:31,281 --> 01:07:33,617
[Speaking Spanish]

831
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:57,307
[Speaking Spanish]

832
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,597
You say Senor Danzeeger
send this to me?

833
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,133
That's right.

834
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:33,710
You're a very big liar,
he knows I cannot read.

835
01:08:36,346 --> 01:08:38,415
- You're pretty smart, General.
- Ah, very smart.

836
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:41,951
That's why they call me
El Gavilan, The Hawk.

837
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:44,721
Why you come here?
What do you want?

838
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:46,590
I'm looking for...

839
01:08:49,993 --> 01:08:53,096
Looking for a friend
of mine named Randolph.

840
01:08:53,197 --> 01:08:55,232
He came up here
a couple of days ago.

841
01:08:55,332 --> 01:09:00,370
Oh, yes, that fella.
You look for him, eh?

842
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:03,473
Come with me.

843
01:09:14,117 --> 01:09:16,720
[Sighs] Hello, nurse.

844
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:23,360
You run along now, Melinda,
see if the beer's cold.

845
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:28,932
I was afraid
your luck had changed.

846
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:30,367
I'm glad to see
it hasn't.

847
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:34,571
Oh, but it has, it has.
The general won my boots.

848
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:36,005
So I see.

849
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:40,344
Liguras cannot read writing
but he can read the cards.

850
01:09:40,444 --> 01:09:45,282
Why you lie? Why you
say Danzeeger sent you?

851
01:09:45,382 --> 01:09:46,816
So I wasn't very smart, General.

852
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,386
I wanted to get in
so I thought up the letter.

853
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:52,289
I am a little new
at the spy business.

854
01:09:52,389 --> 01:09:54,958
What is that you mean,
"spy business?"

855
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,928
You just let
a rabbit out, son.

856
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,865
- Better catch it.
- Doesn't make any difference.

857
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:03,733
I just remembered who I am.

858
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:05,669
If you had hound's ears,
you could probably hear

859
01:10:05,769 --> 01:10:07,504
Him and Danzeeger
riding this way now.

860
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:10,707
[Speaks Spanish] Why you say
Danzeeger come for you?

861
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:14,177
[Whitney sighs]
Because, General,
he's found out who we are.

862
01:10:14,278 --> 01:10:17,314
And he thinks
that you oughta know, too.

863
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:20,850
- I hope he's right.
- You're wasting time. Tell him.

864
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:24,354
[Sighs] Well, I have a distinct
feeling that the water's going
to be awfully cold,

865
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:26,623
But, uh, here goes.

866
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:30,394
General, I'm an agent of
the United States government,

867
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:34,498
And, uh, this...
this brash, young
fellow here is a...

868
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:40,003
- He's a Texas Ranger.
- Ranger, eh?

869
01:10:40,103 --> 01:10:41,871
You come to spy on El Gavilan?

870
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:45,809
Well, now, let's not
put it that way, General,
it's just that...

871
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:47,644
Well, when one country
sees a friendly neighbor

872
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,280
Raising an army
on her borders, she...

873
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,115
Well, naturally, she...

874
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:55,218
You can't blame her
for being... curious.

875
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:58,422
So we were sent down here
to see what's going on.

876
01:10:58,522 --> 01:11:01,124
I will tell you
what is going on.

877
01:11:01,224 --> 01:11:02,892
But afterward, you must die.

878
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:06,596
For then you will know
El Gavilan's plans.

879
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:09,165
You still wish to know, senores?

880
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,668
Ah, I see you
do not want to die,

881
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:15,305
But it is no matter,
I tell you all the same.

882
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:18,342
El Gavilan will sweep down
on the Tejanos

883
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:20,444
And take the land, so!

884
01:11:20,544 --> 01:11:22,712
Then he will give it
back to Mexico.

885
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:26,082
Or maybe he will
keep it for Liguras.

886
01:11:26,182 --> 01:11:27,617
Now you know.

887
01:11:27,717 --> 01:11:30,520
And, while the Hawk
is sweeping down on Texas,

888
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,256
Just what do you think
an old bird called the Eagle

889
01:11:33,357 --> 01:11:34,791
Is going to be doing?
Sleeping?

890
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:36,693
Your people are too busy
fighting each other,

891
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,128
They will have
no time for Liguras.

892
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,897
He will fight
and he will win.

893
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:44,668
Or maybe he will die.
It makes no difference.

894
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:47,471
They will celebrate
in the villages.

895
01:11:47,571 --> 01:11:51,541
The people will build
big statues to Juarez.

896
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:55,345
And perhaps they will build
little one for Liguras.

897
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:57,381
Who knows?

898
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:02,686
They don't build statues
to traitors, General,

899
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:07,357
- they hang 'em.
- I, Liguras, a traitor?

900
01:12:07,457 --> 01:12:09,025
[Todd] You will be
if you fight for Danzeeger.

901
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,461
He's an agent
of the French government.

902
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:13,497
Well, so you finally
figured it out, too.

903
01:12:13,597 --> 01:12:14,598
It wasn't too hard.

904
01:12:14,698 --> 01:12:16,533
This is some sort of trick,

905
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:18,001
I do not believe you.

906
01:12:18,101 --> 01:12:20,236
[Whitney] No, General,
it's no trick, it's the truth.

907
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,572
Where do you think Danzeeger
gets the money

908
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,674
That he pays you
and your soldiers?

909
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:27,744
- From Juarez, senor!
- No, General.

910
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:30,179
That money comes from
the French agent in Monterrey.

911
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:34,851
And it's brought
into Corrales by the
beautiful Madeline Danzeeger.

912
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:37,721
Yes. In trunks so heavy

913
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:39,923
That it takes two full-grown
nitwits to help lift them

914
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:44,093
- into a carriage.
- You sure?

915
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:47,397
Just as sure as I am that the
perfume she wears is French.

916
01:12:47,497 --> 01:12:51,668
No! Danzeeger is
a friend to Mexico.

917
01:12:51,768 --> 01:12:55,472
When the guns and ammunition
arrive from Juarez, we march!

918
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:57,641
He has given his word!

919
01:12:57,741 --> 01:13:00,376
The guns are already here,
General.

920
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:02,378
But they're not from Juarez,

921
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:04,481
They're French guns
and stolen American guns

922
01:13:04,581 --> 01:13:06,783
- intended for Juarez.
- You saw them?

923
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:10,654
- Enough to outfit a regiment.
- You're a very big liar, senor.

924
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:14,157
If Danzeeger has guns,
why he don't tell Liguras?

925
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:15,992
Because he's working
for the French!

926
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:18,061
I don't know what, but he's
got some kind of a trap.

927
01:13:18,161 --> 01:13:20,464
When he's ready to spring it,
you'll get your guns,

928
01:13:20,564 --> 01:13:23,199
And you'll be in the trap.

929
01:13:23,299 --> 01:13:25,735
You can prove this, senores?

930
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:32,642
General, you'll have
to take our word.

931
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:36,780
No, no, it's not enough.
I must see proof.

932
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,949
I go to Danzeeger.

933
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:43,487
If what you tell me is true,
I kill him.

934
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:51,160
If what you tell me
is not true, I kill you.

935
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,531
[Liguras speaking Spanish]

936
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:56,900
We can't let Liguras
go with us.

937
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,403
If he gets his hands on those
guns, he'll march right now.

938
01:14:00,504 --> 01:14:02,539
And then it's,
"Look out, Texas."

939
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:04,073

We use an entirely
different kind of...

1099
01:29:51,987 --> 01:29:56,792
Transportation
where I'm going.

1100
01:29:58,661 --> 01:30:01,029
If my luck holds out.

1101
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:08,704
Sun's getting kind of high.

1102
01:30:09,705 --> 01:30:11,774
Don't forget, you got a...

1103
01:30:13,809 --> 01:30:16,244
Luncheon date with Liguras.

1104
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:17,946
I know.

1105
01:30:19,515 --> 01:30:21,917
Can I have your guns, Whit?

1106
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,622
Sure, Todd.

1107
01:30:43,506 --> 01:30:45,508
You know something, mister?

1108
01:30:46,675 --> 01:30:49,778
I've changed my mind
about a short war.

1109
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:54,617
It'll take us quite a while
to lick you Yanks.

1110
01:31:14,436 --> 01:31:17,773
- I'll be back as soon as I can.
- Sure.

1111
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:20,776
You know something funny?

1112
01:31:20,876 --> 01:31:24,547
Everything happens to me
with my boots off.

1113
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:02,284
[Danzeeger] The shadow
grows longer, General.

1114
01:32:02,384 --> 01:32:04,352
It's well past noon.

1115
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:09,658
Where are these Americans
who will bring proof
of my disloyalty to Mexico?

1116
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:12,060
Si, muchacho,

1117
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,630
Where are the men who tell
Liguras this wild story

1118
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:16,932
Of hidden guns and ammunition?

1119
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:18,934
Perhaps they were burned
in the storehouse, General.

1120
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:22,738
[Chuckles] I would destroy
valuable powder and weapons?

1121
01:32:22,838 --> 01:32:25,173
[Liguras] You have listened
to the Yankee, Roberto.

1122
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:29,211
If there are guns
I must have proof.
Where is the proof?

1123
01:32:29,311 --> 01:32:32,715
[Danzeeger] There'll be no
proof. The Americans won't come.

1124
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,384
[Liguras] I believe this.

1125
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:39,221
I ask my friend to forgive me.

1126
01:32:39,321 --> 01:32:41,990
No need
of forgiveness, General.

1127
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:44,927
Just take your men
back to camp.

1128
01:32:45,027 --> 01:32:46,328
Si, si.

1129
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:54,402
- [speaking Spanish]
- [speaks Spanish] He comes!

1130
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:56,739
[People chattering]

1131
01:32:58,306 --> 01:33:01,043
Did I not tell you that he
would keep his word, General?

1132
01:33:01,143 --> 01:33:05,681
He comes alone, like a man
who is sick or drunk.

1133
01:33:13,321 --> 01:33:16,725
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,
General, but...

1134
01:33:16,825 --> 01:33:18,661
I was unavoidably detained.

1135
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:22,164
Your friend,
he of the good luck?

1136
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:24,800
His luck ran out today.

1137
01:33:26,635 --> 01:33:28,103
He's dead.

1138
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:33,876
Thanks to him, I'm not.

1139
01:33:33,976 --> 01:33:35,510
You overlooked him, Danzeeger.

1140
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:39,281
Regrettable oversight on the
part of Mr. Hyatt, I assure you.

1141
01:33:39,381 --> 01:33:44,787
Come, Tejano, where's
the proof you promised?

1142
01:33:44,887 --> 01:33:49,591
Last night, I had a paper
in my hands signed by the
French Minister of War.

1143
01:33:49,692 --> 01:33:51,493
It said that Danzeeger
was his agent.

1144
01:33:51,593 --> 01:33:52,627
[Liguras] Well,
the paper, where is it?

1145
01:33:52,728 --> 01:33:55,630
Go on, Captain.
Show it to him!

1146
01:33:55,731 --> 01:33:58,000
- You have it, Tejano?
- No, but I saw it.

1147
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:01,603
That's why I was tied
to wild horses like Brooks.

1148
01:34:01,704 --> 01:34:03,505
He wanted to make sure
I didn't tell you.

1149
01:34:03,605 --> 01:34:06,742
- He's lying.
- The paper said that the money
that pays your troops

1150
01:34:06,842 --> 01:34:08,877
- comes from France.
- It comes from Juarez.

1151
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:12,948
[Todd] Maybe you'll believe
your own countrymen.
Tell him, Roberto.

1152
01:34:13,048 --> 01:34:14,750
Si, what say you, muchacho?

1153
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:16,885
He tells the truth.
These are with the French

1154
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:18,821
Who sent an Austrian
to be our emperor,

1155
01:34:18,921 --> 01:34:20,588
And his wife, a Belgian,
to be our empress.

1156
01:34:20,689 --> 01:34:22,357
Why did you not
tell me this before?

1157
01:34:22,457 --> 01:34:25,794
You were afraid because you
could not prove what you say?

1158
01:34:25,894 --> 01:34:28,030
Would you believe me, General,
if I told you?

1159
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:33,001
- [Danzeeger] Madeline!
- Yes, I take the lady's word.

1160
01:34:34,636 --> 01:34:35,838
The American speaks the truth.

1161
01:34:35,938 --> 01:34:37,773
- Stay out of this.
- No, I won't.

1162
01:34:37,873 --> 01:34:39,607
You promised to let him go.

1163
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:42,044
You and your troops will be
used to stop the Americans

1164
01:34:42,144 --> 01:34:44,279
- if they come to help Juarez.
- Don't listen to her!

1165
01:34:44,379 --> 01:34:47,983
You've got to listen to me.
My husband and I
are agents of the French.

1166
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:51,887
If you seize Texas, you will
take it for France, not Mexico.

1167
01:34:53,756 --> 01:34:55,090
Hurry, Captain!

1168
01:34:56,725 --> 01:34:59,728
- Todd!
- [gunshot]

1169
01:34:59,828 --> 01:35:03,431
Smith, Brown, cover us.

1170
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:08,003
- [Madeline groans]
- [gunfire continues]

1171
01:35:21,483 --> 01:35:24,753
- Take care of her, Roberto.
- I will.

1172
01:35:24,853 --> 01:35:27,122
[Shouts in Spanish]

1173
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:17,539
- Stay with your men!
- [shouts in Spanish]

1174
01:37:06,922 --> 01:37:10,959
Why you stop?
It's almost dark,
he'll get away.

1175
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:21,236
Get up!

1176
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:23,105
Come on, get up!

1177
01:37:51,566 --> 01:37:54,102
- There he is!
- Wait.

1178
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:57,439
Danzeeger!
Can you hear me?

1179
01:37:59,141 --> 01:38:02,377
- I hear you!
- You've got one chance!

1180
01:38:02,477 --> 01:38:03,611
Give up!

1181
01:38:05,113 --> 01:38:08,050
Will Liguras treat me
as a prisoner of war?

1182
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:11,619
Guarantee safe conduct
to Mexico City?

1183
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:15,290
- How about it, General?
- No, senor, he must die.

1184
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:16,824
I make no promise!

1185
01:38:16,925 --> 01:38:18,927
In that case, gentlemen,

1186
01:38:19,027 --> 01:38:20,595
Come and get me!

1187
01:38:33,008 --> 01:38:35,243
You stay here,
amigo, I get him.

1188
01:38:35,343 --> 01:38:37,179
You wouldn't get 50 feet
up that hill, General.

1189
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:40,448
- He'll slip away.
- We'll smoke him out.

1190
01:38:40,548 --> 01:38:43,718
I'll set fire
on the base of the peak
and set the draw here.

1191
01:38:43,818 --> 01:38:46,588
You cover from there
and get him when he comes out.

1192
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:50,558
He must not escape.

1193
01:38:53,828 --> 01:38:56,631
You'll get him, General.
Stay down here.

1194
01:39:04,539 --> 01:39:06,208
[Gunshot]

1195
01:40:10,305 --> 01:40:12,907
Keep your eye on that draw,
General, he'll come out like
a scared jackrabbit.

1196
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:15,210
That's the only way out.

1197
01:40:15,310 --> 01:40:18,046
The horses, senor, they'll
be frightened by the fire.

1198
01:40:18,146 --> 01:40:20,682
You will take
them away, please.

1199
01:40:53,014 --> 01:40:57,185
Liguras? Liguras!
Where are you?

1200
01:40:57,285 --> 01:40:59,954
- Here I am!
- Come back! Come back!

1201
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:01,423
No! No!

1202
01:41:35,723 --> 01:41:37,659
[Gunfire continues]

1203
01:41:58,313 --> 01:42:02,450
[Gunfire]

1204
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:31,546
Poor Liguras,
he could have been a great man.

1205
01:42:32,514 --> 01:42:34,482
He was a patriot.

1206
01:42:35,517 --> 01:42:37,719
Are there any greater?
