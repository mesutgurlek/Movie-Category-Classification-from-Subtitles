00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:45,302
Shit.

330
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:46,770
I'm going through a lot here.

331
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:48,005
Mr. Simpson, I am very sorry.

332
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:50,274
[grunts]

333
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:51,375
But we do have some questions

334
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:53,043
about the death of
your ex-wife, Nicole.

335
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,744
Would you be willing to
come down to headquarters?

336
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:56,780
Have a talk?

337
00:18:56,781 --> 00:19:00,050
HOWARD: O.J., O.J.

338
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:02,286
You don't have to talk to them.

339
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:04,955
You're wrong, Howard.

340
00:19:04,956 --> 00:19:08,558
If I don't talk, it looks
like I have something to hide.

341
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,095
Yes, Officer, I'm happy to cooperate.

342
00:19:13,998 --> 00:19:15,999
Great.

343
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:26,275
So, what happens now?

344
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:32,348
O.J.'s a suspect.

345
00:19:40,455 --> 00:19:42,010
Honey?

346
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,082
Honey, where's my Hugo Boss?

347
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,516
I swear that girl hides my clothes.

348
00:19:48,517 --> 00:19:50,518
I-I-I got nothing to wear!

349
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,887
Johnnie.

350
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:54,189
I got a thousand million
things to do today.

351
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,690
I got to stop by the DA's.

352
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:57,192
Meet with the Taylor family.

353
00:19:57,193 --> 00:19:58,260
Do a TV appearance.

354
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:02,263
So I can't dress too festive.
I need to be strong, uplifting.

355
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:04,198
Okay, what about lime green?

356
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:06,067
Lime gre... that would be exceptional.

357
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:08,770
Except... then I got
to run out to Neverland.

358
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:10,872
MJ's got some new pile of commotion,

359
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:13,207
so I can't wear lime...
Michael's afraid of that color.

360
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,243
I never met someone
with so many phobias.

361
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:16,944
[laughs]

362
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:18,780
Nobody said your job would be easy.

363
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:20,414
All right, what about purple?

364
00:20:20,415 --> 00:20:21,916
Purple? Well, that would be fine...

365
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,985
no, I don't want
to look like no grape.

366
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:29,590
_

367
00:20:29,591 --> 00:20:32,593
Afternoon, Chris.

368
00:20:32,594 --> 00:20:35,096
You finish your investigation
of the Taylor shooting?

369
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:36,429
Uh, yeah.

370
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,765
I didn't want to just send
over the report.

371
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:40,834
I thought it'd be better
if we talked in person.

372
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,002
Save your breath, my brother.

373
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:44,604
- Well, let me explain.
- Come on, I had your job.

374
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:46,173
I know the drill.

375
00:20:46,174 --> 00:20:48,008
The police commission
determined the officer

376
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:50,310
acted in self-defense.
The officers were scared.

377
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:52,578
There were seven of them with
guns up against one mentally ill

378
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:54,247
woman with a knife.

379
00:20:54,248 --> 00:20:55,282
Johnnie, I tried.

380
00:20:55,283 --> 00:20:57,117
You know all they had to claim

381
00:20:57,118 --> 00:20:58,584
- was that their lives were in danger.
- Danger.

382
00:20:58,585 --> 00:21:00,120
They shot her in the back.

383
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:01,788
You know, it's remarkable to me

384
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:03,589
how many black folks
get shot in the backside

385
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,158
while they're attacking.

386
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:07,593
Like they're going backwards
and forwards at the same time.

387
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:09,963
Johnnie, I wish I could prosecute.

388
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:12,431
I... it's terrible.

389
00:21:12,432 --> 00:21:15,100
Look, if you check the report,
you'll see that I slipped in

390
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:17,602
that the officers may not
have been 100% truthful.

391
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:19,972
Oh, please!
One sentence nobody's gonna read

392
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:22,308
- makes you feel better about yourself?
- What do you expect me to do?!

393
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:23,642
You know what we're talking about!

394
00:21:23,643 --> 00:21:24,810
Choose a side!

395
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:32,318
Look.

396
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:35,020
I know your heart
is in the right place.

397
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:37,356
But these four walls, they,

398
00:21:37,357 --> 00:21:39,325
they box you in.

399
00:21:39,326 --> 00:21:42,228
It's just an endless cycle
of bullshit.

400
00:21:42,229 --> 00:21:44,196
Can I be honest with you?

401
00:21:44,197 --> 00:21:46,198
Always.

402
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,972
I hate this place.

403
00:21:56,308 --> 00:21:58,809
I mean, I hate S.I.D.
I'm thinking of quitting.

404
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,146
Good, now you're finally
talking some sense.

405
00:22:02,147 --> 00:22:04,315
And I know you're capable of more.

406
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:08,853
The world needs more black men
willing to make a difference.

407
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:13,224
That means a lot to me.

408
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:15,826
You know, I've always
looked to you as a mentor.

409
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:18,396
Indeed.

410
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:22,900
Onward and upward.

411
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:25,669
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Oh.

412
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,939
I've got to go deliver the bad
news to the Taylor family.

413
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,375
Fortunately, I've got a plan "B."

414
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:34,278
I'm gonna advise the family
to sue the city

415
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:36,881
for police brutality
and wrongful death.

416
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:38,549
See, the way things are sometimes,

417
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:42,251
money is the only way to get justice.

418
00:22:43,554 --> 00:22:45,121
Hey, uh, take...

419
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,834
This is outrageous.

420
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,202
Eight 911 calls.

421
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:03,740
The police were called
out there eight times.

422
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:08,711
Nicole had a bruised face,
black eye, bleeding lip.

423
00:23:08,712 --> 00:23:12,081
O.J. broke a windshield
with a baseball bat.

424
00:23:12,082 --> 00:23:14,616
God, the system failed her.

425
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:16,084
You can't get so upset.

426
00:23:16,085 --> 00:23:17,719
You know what really pisses me off?

427
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,121
This went on for years.

428
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:23,459
All that battering
before he was even arrested.

429
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,893
It's the LAPD and a famous guy.

430
00:23:24,894 --> 00:23:26,462
WOMAN: Marcia.

431
00:23:26,463 --> 00:23:27,563
Yeah.

432
00:23:27,564 --> 00:23:29,264
The tape is here.

433
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:33,936
VANNATTER: O.J., when was
the last time you saw Nicole?

434
00:23:33,937 --> 00:23:38,306
O.J.: Yesterday when we were leaving
our daughter's dance recital.

435
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:41,944
It ended at about, uh, 6:30,
6:45, something like that.

436
00:23:41,945 --> 00:23:45,347
VANNATTER: And what time
did you get back home?

437
00:23:45,348 --> 00:23:47,816
Oh, 7:00-something.

438
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:49,817
I'm trying to think.

439
00:23:49,818 --> 00:23:51,719
Did I leave?

440
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,555
You know, I had to run
and get my daughter,

441
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:57,459
uh, recital flowers.

442
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,397
Then I called my girlfriend Paula
as I headed to her house.

443
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:04,132
And Paula wasn't home.

444
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:06,567
What-what did he say? Did...?

445
00:24:06,568 --> 00:24:09,437
Did he buy flowers
before or after the recital?

446
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:11,439
- Did he even go to Paula's house?
- Shh.

447
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,142
VANNATTER: And when did you park
your Bronco on Rockingham?

448
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:15,310
O.J.: 8:00-something.

449
00:24:15,311 --> 00:24:17,945
7:00, 8:00.

450
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:20,448
9:00... I don't know.

451
00:24:20,449 --> 00:24:22,450
Around that area.

452
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:24,318
And then I was sitting with Kato.

453
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,453
He hadn't done a Jacuzzi,
so we went and got a burger.

454
00:24:26,454 --> 00:24:29,156
7:00, 8:00, 9:00.

455
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:30,525
That's not an answer.

456
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:32,960
Guys, lock him to a time frame.

457
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:35,530
Pin him to a version of
the story he can't change later.

458
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:38,332
And what about your left hand there?

459
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:40,034
How did you get that injury?

460
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:41,636
Oh, I don't know.

461
00:24:41,637 --> 00:24:43,671
Uh...

462
00:24:43,672 --> 00:24:45,406
the first time I was in Chicago.

463
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:47,675
Yeah, and then I got
back to the house,

464
00:24:47,676 --> 00:24:50,511
and I was running around and, uh,
I broke a glass.

465
00:24:50,512 --> 00:24:51,602
- Oh.
- Yeah.

466
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:54,448
And then one of your guys

467
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:55,950
just called.

468
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:57,451
Uh, actually,

469
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:58,518
uh, uh, I cut it before.

470
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:00,620
Maybe I opened it.

471
00:25:00,621 --> 00:25:02,789
But it's no big deal.

472
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,323
I bleed all the time.

473
00:25:04,324 --> 00:25:05,992
I golf, you know. [chuckling]

474
00:25:05,993 --> 00:25:07,961
It's always something.

475
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:09,696
Nicks and stuff, yeah.

476
00:25:09,697 --> 00:25:11,031
That's it.

477
00:25:11,032 --> 00:25:12,465
Well, I can't tell.

478
00:25:12,883 --> 00:25:15,168
Did he cut his hand in Los Angeles

479
00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:16,369
or in Chicago?

480
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,857
How did he injure himself?

481
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,864
<i>This is a fiasco.</i>

482
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:22,202
<i>Why did the cops tolerate it?</i>

483
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:23,502
GIL: <i>'Cause they're not
used to grilling a star.</i>

484
00:25:23,503 --> 00:25:24,343
<i>He's The Juice.</i>

485
00:25:24,344 --> 00:25:26,655
He rushed more than 2,000 yards
in one season.

486
00:25:26,656 --> 00:25:28,515
I have no idea what that means.

487
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:30,215
But you know what?
It shouldn't matter.

488
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:31,584
He got away with beating her.

489
