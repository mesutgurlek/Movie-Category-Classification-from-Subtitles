absent a swimming pool,

159
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,416
the presence of a pool man
would appear to be suspicious.

160
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,681
But, madam,
who is the real victim here?

161
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,688
Let me suggest to you
the following.

162
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,691
Your husband,
on a prior occasion,
had slapped you... beat you.

163
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,455
I think that word
is not inappropriate.
No, l...

164
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,462
let me finish, please.

165
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,964
I'm not concerned
with who slapped whom first.

166
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,467
Your husband,
who had beaten you repeatedly...
no, he never...

167
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,561
please... repeatedly, was at the time
brandishing your firearm.

168
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,574
- It was his gun.
- And we'll get it back for you.

169
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,509
Trying, in his rage,
to shoot an acquaintance,

170
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,512
a friend of long standing.

171
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,980
They never really cared
for each other.

172
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,983
And if not for your
cool-headed intervention,

173
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,986
his tantrum might have ended
this schmo's life and ruined his own.

174
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:59,491
As for the sexual indiscretion
which he imagined took place,

175
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:03,255
wasn't it in fact he...
who was sleeping with the pool man?

176
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,891
No?
Am i going too far here?

177
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,902
Were his sexual... no.
I don't...

178
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,904
sorry. I'm not omniscient.

179
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:16,066
The point is
that he acted upon an assumption
which he cannot prove,

180
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,406
and i take it you deny.

181
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,911
- Well...
- fine. I'll take the case.

182
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,279
It's imperative
that i meet with oliver olerud
before we proceed any further...

183
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,446
so that i can massage the kinks
out of our testimony.

184
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,682
Do you really think
we can put all this across?

185
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,953
The truth is so self-evident
to me, mrs. Donaly,

186
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:38,360
that i'm sure i'll be able to make it
equally as transparent to anyjury,

187
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,365
should your husband
decide to take it that far.

188
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:44,130
We'll need to caucus again
to draw up a picture
of your husband's net worth.

189
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,637
A map of enemy territory,
so to speak.

190
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,641
You said he's a television producer?
He has a soap opera...
the sands of time.

191
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,643
It's a silly show.

192
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,645
[Chuckling]
Well, it'll be yours soon.

193
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,647
Thank you very much.

194
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,047
Thank you, mr. Massey.
Yeah. Bye-bye.

195
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,787
Still, you have to admire him
for taking those pictures.

196
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,424
[Lawyer]
Now, mrs. Gutman,

197
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:10,428
you testified that you were
your husband's sexual slave...

198
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,431
for 36 years
during your marriage.

199
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,595
Except for two years
when he was in the navy
in southeast asia.

200
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,605
And before your marriage,
what was your profession?

201
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,335
I was a hostess
for braniff airlines.

202
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,105
And what is
your husband's profession?

203
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,477
He manufactures staples
and industrial brad tacks.

204
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,482
He's very successful.

205
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,078
How would you describe
your husband's sexual proclivities?

206
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:40,615
Well, at first he was
a very gentle and tender lover.

207
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,628
But then he became
more and more fiixated...

208
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,631
on toys and machinery
and devices of various kinds.

209
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,634
[Mrs. Gutman continues]
[Whispering] i can't help it.
You don't decide to become bored.

210
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,136
It just happens.
[Whispering]
You're just looking for trouble.

211
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,138
It's a midlife crisis.

212
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,800
Look, get yourself
a new car.

213
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,810
I have a new car.

214
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:02,336
I have two new cars and a tab
at the mercedes dealership.

215
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,279
Torn the house down
twice,

216
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,215
rebuilt
the cabin in vail,

217
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,220
got three of those, uh...
yard people...

218
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,314
gardeners?
Gardeners. I've got a man
who waxes my jet.

219
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,621
These encounters
were videotaped.

220
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,991
Sometimes
there would be a gizmo.

221
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,996
[Lawyer]
A gizmo?

222
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,999
He had a device
he called the intruder.

223
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,900
It was something he had
the engineers at the factory design.

224
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,066
And then he had a prototype built
out of the parts from our vacuum cleaner.

225
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,972
I see.

226
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,978
So the vacuum cleaner
wasn't available to me
for several months.

227
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,708
Several months
without the appliance.
Yes!

228
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,717
The problem is,
everyone is willing
to compromise.

229
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:43,221
That's the problem with
the institution of marriage.
It's based on compromise.

230
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,223
Even through
its dissolution.

231
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,226
Mrs. Gutman here,
she's gonna score some points...

232
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,228
concerning her husband's
sexual politics.

233
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,230
Naturally,
we'll try to impeach.

234
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,233
And then the entire process
will find an equilibrium point...

235
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,735
based on the skill
of the individual lawyers.

236
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:01,933
Then both parties will go home
with their portion
of the staple factory.

237
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,941
That's life.
Life is compromise.

238
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,068
That's not life.
That's death.

239
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,007
Struggle and challenge
and ultimate destruction
of your opponent... that's life.

240
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,018
Let me ask you
something.

241
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,020
Attila the hun.

242
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,023
Thank you, mrs. Gutman.
Ivan the terrible.
Henry the eighth.

243
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,559
[Judge]
Mr. Massey, any questions?
What do they have in common?

244
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,530
Middle name.
No. They didn't just win.
They... they...

245
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,533
mr. Massey?
They destroyed...

246
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,626
mr. Massey, again i ask,

247
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,695
have you any questions
for the complainant?

248
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,799
I'm sorry, your honor.
I was just consulting
with an associate.

249
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,446
Now, mrs. Gutman,

250
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,142
do you know a man
named david gonzalez?

251
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,146
Well, he's the tennis pro at the club.

252
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,588
The tennis pro?
[Paper snaps]

253
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,921
Then why are your letters addressed to him,
"dear david and goliath"?

254
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,860
[Tires screeching]

you don't exhibit a great deal of tact.

301

You want tact, call a tactician.
You want an ass nailed,
you call gus petch.

00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:16,219
This is going to be
my passport to wealth,

309
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,321
independence and freedom.

310
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,332
[Chuckling]

311
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,130
Sounds like to me
you gon' nail his ass.

312
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,211
Honey? Honey!

313
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,510
[Woman on intercom]
Rex, get away from the door.

314
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,517
Honey?
[Chuckles]

315
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,519
My key doesn't work.

316
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,521
Can we talk about this?

317
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,523
Rex, get away
from the door.

318
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,025
Oh, look, i know
that you're upset, honey.

319
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,529
Rex, for your own safety,
get away from the door.

320
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,031
I don't like having
to set the dogs on you.

321
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,829
Oh, for crying out loud,
if we could... dogs?

322
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,336
[Barking]

323
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,441
[Barking continues]
[Whimpering]

324
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,982
[Phone dialing]
[Woman on phone]
Yes, dogs.

325
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,317
I wanted some security
since i'll be living here alone.

326
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,722
Look, marylin, can't we have
a civilized discussion about this?
Our lawyers can.

327
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,059
- Aaah!
- [Growling]

328
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,489
You have a discovery hearing at 5.30
for the maxine gopnick case.

329
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,499
Discovery? Gopnick?
And a lance kelso called.

330
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,501
He read your article
about palimony settlements...
lance kelso.

331
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,332
In same-sex
partnerships...

332
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,338
and would like to schedule
an appointment.
Same-sex.

333
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,341
Arthur yardumian
and his tax attorney want to reschedule
their caucus for tomorrow.

334
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,344
Yardumian?
Arthur had to fly to atlanta
for a deadbeat dad hearing.

335
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:43,074
Atlanta?
And your 10:30 is here.
Rex rexroth.

336
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,675
- Rex rexroth?
- Real estate. He's okay.

337
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,590
Mr. Rexroth.

338
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,626
Uh, call me rex.
Please.

339
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,628
Miles massey.
Please sit. Relax.

340
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:02,793
Consider this office your office,
your haven, your war room
for the duration of the campaign.

341
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,768
Thank you.

342
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,770
Now, sir...

343
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,772
tell me your troubles.

344
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,705
Well...

345
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,711
my wife has me
between a rock and a hard place.

346
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,940
That's her job.
You should respect that.

347
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:19,882
When i first met marylin,
we were crazy about each other.

348
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,887
Not emotionally, of course.
Just, we couldn't keep
our hands off each other.

349
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,049
But then...
[sighs] then...

350
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,426
time marches on.

351
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,054
- Ardor cools.
- Yeah.

352
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,964
So, um, we had an understanding.

353
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,003
Whereby?
We could see other people.

354
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,633
Has mrs. Rexroth pursued the opportunities
implicit in your arrangement?

355
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,007
Uh, i can... i can only assume...

356
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,103
not in court, you can't.

357
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,206
- Has she retained counsel?
- I don't know.

358
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,150
- She has rottweilers.
- Not a good sign.

359
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:58,849
And have you yourself exploited
your understood freedom?

360
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,790
There's a lady.

361
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,794
A-ayoung lady.

362
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,989
She lets me be myself.
Of course.

363
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:10,296
And your wife is aware
and/or has evidence?

364
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,304
- Video.
- Hah!

365
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,034
To cut to the chase,
forensically speaking,

366
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,099
is there a prenup?

367
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:28,019
"The fault, dear brutus, lies not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

368
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,783
Let me ask you this...
what kind of a settlement do you seek?

369
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:35,088
What are, for you,
the parameters of the possible?

370
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,094
Well, that's the problem.

371
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,187
I can't afford to give her anything.

372
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,969
Nothing?

373
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,972
Yeah, i know that sounds
a little rough, but listen,

374
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,975
i'm about to close a deal
to develop some mini-malls.

375
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,977
I'm mortgaged up to my heinie.

376
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,570
If this deal goes south, i am ruined.
I will lose millions.

377
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,081
So you propose...

378
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,779
that, in spite of demonstrable
infidelity on your part,

379
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:05,345
your unoffending wife should be
tossed out on her ear?

380
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,155
Well, is that possible?

381
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,731
It's a challenge.

382
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,370
Why don't you come out to malibu
and see my new beach house tomorrow.

383
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,872
I didn't know dmitri
had a beach house.

384
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,875
Neither did i
until my lawyer found it.
Quite a paper trail.

385
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,911
He had it
in the dog's name.
Oh.

386
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,446
Well, tomorrow won't work.
I'm having a body wrap.

387
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,448
How's wednesday?
Hair appointment
in the morning.

388
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,041
Afternoon?
Shrink.
How's your thursday?

389
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,054
I'm having facial injections.
That kills friday and saturday.

390
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,613
- Botox?
- Butt fat.

391
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,251
Does that really work?
You tell me.

392
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,795
Hello, darlings.
Mwah!

393
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,797
Mwah!

394
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,356
So, you and rex are...

395
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:54,030
well, as my private investigator put it,
we're gonna nail his ass.

396
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:58,406
I've been trying
to nail george's ass for years,
but he is so careful.

397
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:02,208
- [Coughing]
- Oh.! Oh.!

398
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,043
Are you all right, claire?

399
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,277
Down the wrong pipe.
[Giggling]

400
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:09,286
- So, who's your lawyer?
- Freddy bender.

401
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:12,790
I have an appointment this afternoon
with rex and his schnauzer.

402
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,292
So, who's rex's guy?
Miles massey.

403
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,420
Miles massey?
Of massey, myerson?

404
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,431
Do you know him?
By reputation.

405
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,161
And, marylin, he's no schnauzer.

406
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,170
He got phyllis rumsey
that cute little island
of george's.

407
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,173
George was so impressed,
he hired him
when he divorced his second.

408
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,766
- Muriel rumsey.
- Who's she?

409
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,812
Now?
Night manager at mcdonald's.

410
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,941
But, marylin,
do we have a man for you.

411
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,951
Thorstenson gieselensen.

412
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,579
He just separated from his third.
He's in fish.

413
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,589
He is fish.
Well, he's tuna.

414
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:49,024
Ladies, i'm not seeing anyone
until i've finished nailing rex's ass.

415
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,654
But, marylin,
this man is tuna.

416
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,131
Sarah, one husband at a time.

417
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,602
[Miles]
I'll do the talking.

418
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:03,869
I know you'll be tempted to chime in,
but remember that you're in
an emotionally vulnerable state.

419
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,206
I'm the professional.
Oh.

420
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,643
Okay.

421
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:10,545
Freddy.
[Clears throat]

422
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,713
Freddy bender,
this is rex rexroth.

423
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,720
And you are
the lovely marylin.

424
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,722
Please, ms. Rexroth.

425
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,815
And you must be mr. Massey.

426
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,826
Please, miles. Sit.

427
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,488
Sit down.
[Groans]

428
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:29,261
Freddy, i was sorry to hear
about the goldberger award.

429
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,996
- Pastry?
- [Wrigley giggling]

430
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,004
We did very well.

431
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,063
We did very well.

432
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,076
Not to worry, mrs. Rexroth.
You're ably represented.

433
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,136
I'm sure freddy's just too modest
to tell you he used to clerk
for clarence thomas.

434
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,148
Pastry?
Going begging.

435
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,707
[Stammering]
Don't try to bait me, miles.

436
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,219
If you have a proposal to make,
let's hear it.

437
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,882
Well, at this point
my client is still prepared
to consider reconciliation.

438
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,760
My client's ruled that out.

439
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:00,821
My client is prepared to entertain
an amicable dissolution to the marriage
without prejudice.

440
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,833
That's a fart in a stiff wind.

441
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,835
My client proposes
a 30-day cooling-off period.

442
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,701
My client feels
sufficiently dispassionate.

443
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,105
My client asks that you not
initiate proceedings pending
his setting certain affairs in order.

444
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,007
[Both laughing]

445
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,213
What's so goddamn funny?

446
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,215
Please, let me handle this.

447
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:22,344
All right,
so much for the ice-breakers.
What are you after, freddy?

448
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,116
My client is prepared to settle
for 50 percent of the marital assets.

449
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:30,726
Why only 50, freddy?
Why not a hundred?

450
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:33,559
While we're dreaming,
why not 150?

451
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,600
- Are you familiar with kershner?
- Kershner does not apply.

452
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,601
Bring this to trial,
we'll see if kershner applies.

453
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,432
What's kershner?
Please, let me handle this.

454
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,904
- Kershner was in kentucky.
- Kershner was in kentucky?

455
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,739
- Kershner was in kentucky.
- All right, freddy, forget kershner.
What's your bottom line?

456
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,937
Primary residence,
30 percent of remaining assets.

457
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,811
What, are you nuts?
Have you forgotten kershner?

458
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,711
Freddy, it's a negotiation.

459
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,720
[Freddy]
See you at the preliminary.

460
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,881
Freddy,
we're all friends here.

461
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:02,154
It's a negotiation. Hey, uh...

462
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,092
freddy!

463
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,097
Fine. We'll eat the pastry.
[Door opens, slams]

464
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,841
I thought that went well.

465
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,844
[Woman]
Don't cry out loud
[men chuckling, muttering]

466
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,846
[Continues]
[Man chuckling]
Oh, yeah.

467
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,848
[Man]
Gus, you outdid yourself.

468
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,850
Mm-hmm.
Hear, hear.

469
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,852
Mm-hmm, that's cool.
Very cool.

470
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,252
Let's go back
to the football game.!

471
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,759
Oh, kiss my ass, now.
It's halftime, man.
This is some good shit.

472
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,760
I'm 'bout to nail his ass
right here.

473
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,763
Gussy, go back to
the rabinowitz tape again.
[Phone ringing]

474
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:43,062
Hold on, now.
Here come the good part.
She 'bout to take off her panties.

475
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,069
Oh, yeah.
Come on, come on, come on.
[Laughing]

476
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,071
[Woman]
Gus?
Mm-hmm... yeah?

477
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:50,573
It's miles massey.
Uh, take a number.

478
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,576
It's about
a job tonight.!

479
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,578
Goddamn it.

480
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,171
Aah! Aah!
Did you see that?
Oh, come on, man!

481
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,864
[Waiter]
Here we are.

482
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:19,469
Ms. Rexroth, i am so delighted
you decided to come.

483
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,471
Well, i must admit
i was curious.

484
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:25,270
Something to start?
Some wine, perhaps?

485
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,140
Red?
French?

486
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,578
Bordeaux?
Chateau margaux?

487
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,616
'57?
'59.

488
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,310
'54.

489
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,149
Mmm, mr. Massey.
[Waiter]
Good, sir.

490
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:40,590
Your husband had told me
you were the most beautiful woman
that he'd ever met.

491
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,153
I didn't expect
the most beautiful woman
i'd ever met.

492
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,524
"Dismiss your vows,
your feigned tears, your flattery,

493
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,593
for where a heart is hard
they make no battery."

494
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:59,238
"Whoever loved
that loved not at first sight?"

495
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,904
Now, you didn't ask me here
to pick me up.

496
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,914
You could be disbarred for that.

497
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,348
Maybe i'm reckless.

498
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:09,285
What was your performance about
this afternoon?
What did your lawyer say?

499
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,288
Oh, freddy thinks you're a buffoon.

500
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,916
He says
you've been too successful,

501
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:17,723
you're bored, complacent,
and you're on your way down.

502
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,855
But you don't think so.
How do you know?

503
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:21,922
Why would you be here?
Why did you ask me?

504
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,467
Can't i be curious?
About what?

505
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,469
Do you ever
answer questions?
Do you?

506
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,472
I'll have the tournedoes of beef.
The lady will have the same.
Thank you.

507
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,405
Thank you, sir.

508
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,409
I assume you're a carnivore.

509
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:36,038
[Chuckles]
Oh, mr. Massey, you have no idea.

510
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,605
Miles, please.

511
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,617
Tell me more about yourself.

512
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,620
All right, miles.

513
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,623
Let me tell you
everything that you need to know.

514
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:50,388
You may think you're tough,
but i eat men like you for breakfast.

515
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,295
I've invested five good years
in my marriage to rex,

516
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:56,299
and i've nailed his ass
fair and square.

517
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,961
Now i'm going to have it
stuffed, mounted...

518
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,904
and have my lady friends come over
and throw darts at it.

519
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,463
Man-hater, huh?

520
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,605
People don't go on safaris
'cause they hate animals.

521
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,614
So it's just for the hunt,
with the trophy at the end.

522
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,276
No. Nothing so frivolous.

523
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,684
This divorce means money.

524
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,690
Money means independence.

525
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,352
That's what i'm after.

526
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,622
What are you after, miles?

527
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,630
Well, i'm a lot like you.

528
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,859
Just looking for
an ass to mount.

529
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,460
Well, don't look at mine.

530
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,811
[Groans]

531
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,815
[Panting]

532
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,443
Yeah.
[Grunting]

533
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,778
[Exhales, grunts]

534
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:53,221
Oy vey.

535
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,720
[Exhales]

536
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,731
[Barking, snarling]

537
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:17,173
[Laughs]
I got ya. See this?

538
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,917
[Barking, snarling continue]

539
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:27,047
[House speakers. Lightjazz]

540
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,261
Yeah?

541
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:37,631
Uh, i'll just have
a, um, salad, please.

542
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,932
Um, baby field greens.

543
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,438
What did you call me?

544
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,967
Uh, no, l-l...
l-i didn't call you anything.

545
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:50,378
You want a salad?
Yeah. Do you... do you have
a, uh, green salad?

546
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,780
What the fuck color
would it be?

547
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,785
Why are we eating here?

548
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,787
[Waitress]
What's his problem?

549
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:01,258
Just bring him an iceberg lettuce
and a mealy tomato wedge
smothered with french dressing.

550
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:07,026
- And for you?
- Ham sandwich on stale rye bread.
Lots of mayo, easy on the ham.

551
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,259
- Slaw cup?
- What the hell.

552
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,268
Hello, marge.
How are you, gus?

553
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,600
I'm all right.

554
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:17,198
Okay, now, i minoxed
her address book.

555
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,210
Don't call me anymore
for this penny-ante shit.

556
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,803
I shoot action.
Me and the ikegami, jack.

557
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,815
Thank you, gus.

558
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,317
And those rottweilers
were a menace, man.

559
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,319
I told you she had dogs.

560
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,117
Yeah. You ain't tell me
they had a hard-on for anus africanus.

561
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,216
Gus, did you see any evidence,

562
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,227
any telltale signs...

563
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,321
of indiscretion
on the part of mrs. Rexroth?

564
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,333
What are you talkin' 'bout,
"telltale signs"?

565
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,336
Look, i see an ass, i nail it.

566
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,497
I don't sneak around
sniffin' at sheets.

567
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,507
Goddamn it,
i'm gus petch!

568
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,009
Couldn't you
be disbarred for that?

569
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,012
No, i don't think so.
Maybe if i'd had the patty melt.

570
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,015
You had a guy break into her house
and photograph her address book.

571
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,950
No, wrigley, i happened
to let a man know...

572
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,955
that i was interested
in her address book...
that's not criminal.

573
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,958
I also happened
to let him know that i was
taking her out to dinner.

574
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,960
That's not a crime either.

575
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,963
No, i don't see myself
as culpable in any sense.

576
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,966
You, on the other hand,
could be disbarred...

577
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,969
for developing
and examining these photos
of her address book,

578
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,972
but that doesn't
really concern me.

579
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,974
Right.

580
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,510
Who are you looking for?
Tenzing norgay.

581
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,511
Tenzing norgay.

582
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,547
That's someone she slept with.

583
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:35,018
I doubt it. Tenzing norgay
was the sherpa that helped
edmund hillary climb mt. Everest.

584
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,179
And marylin knows him.

585
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:40,884
No, you idiot.
Not the tenzing norgay.
Her tenzing norgay.

586
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,827
I'm not sure
that i actually follow that.

587
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,831
Few great accomplishments
are achieved single-handedly,
wrigley.

588
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,833
Most have their norgays.

589
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:53,359
Marylin rexroth is even now
climbing her everest.

590
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,372
I wanna find her norgay.

591
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,965
But how do you determine
which of the people on here are...

592
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,636
how do you spot a norgay?
Yeah.

593
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,543
You start with the people
with the funny names.

594
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,084
Oyez, oyez.
Family court of the fifth district
of los angeles county now in session.

595
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,676
The honorable
marva munson presiding.
All rise.

596
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,162
Have you sat before her
before?

597
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,461
No. No, the judge sits first.
Then we sit.

598
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,467
Well, have you sat
after her before?

599
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,698
Sat after her before?
You mean, have we argued
before her before?

600
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:31,208
The judge sits in judgment.
The counsel argues before the judge.

601
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,573
So, have you argued
before her before?

602
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,909
[Wrigley] before her before,
or before she sat before?
[Rexroth] before her before.

603
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,575
I said, before her before.
No, you said
before she sat before.

604
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,584
I did at first, but...
look, don't argue.

605
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,586
I'm not. I'm...
no, you don't argue.
We argue.

606
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,087
Counsel argues.
You appear.

607
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,090
[Miles]
Thejudge sits.
[Wrigley] then you sit.

608
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:49,092
- Or you stand in contempt.
- And then we argue.

609
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,219
The counsel argues.
Which you've done before.

610
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,229
Which we've done before.
Ah.

611
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,288
But not before her.

612
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:00,699
Rex. Sit.

613
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,639
[Woman screaming]
[Gus chuckling]
There it is! I got it!

614
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,302
I'm gon' nail yo' ass!
[Rexroth]
Enough, i say!

615
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,312
[Screaming continues]
I'm gon' nail yo' ass! Yeah!

616
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,577
[Chuckling]
Yeah, i'm gon' nail yo' ass!
A silly misunderstanding...

617
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,584
[rexroth]
Get that thing off me!

618
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,586
[Gus]
Yeah, i'm gon' nail yo' ass!
[Sobs]

619
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:20,818
I'm gon' nail yo' ass!
I'm gon' nail your ass.!

620
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,099
Devastated.

621
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,105
Simply devastated.

622
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,465
Thank you, mrs. Rexroth.

623
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,536
[Judge munson]
Mr. Massey, any questions?

624
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,757
[Sniffles]

625
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,378
"Dismiss your vows,

for where a heart is hard
they make no battery. '"

628
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,886
Mrs. Rexroth,
do you know those lines?
Objection, your honor.

629
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,947
- Grounds?
- Uh, poetry recitation.

630
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:30,152
Let me rephrase.
Mrs. Rexroth...

631
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:33,789
how high is that wall
around your heart?

632
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,799
Your honor, this is harassment,

633
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:39,394
and, frankly,
it's still a little, uh, arty-farty.

634
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,405
- Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth,
have you ever been in love?
- Yes.

635
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,464
Of course.

636
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,376
With rex.

637
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:50,380
And you've always loved him?

638
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:53,144
"Whoever loved
that loved not at first sight?"

639
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,684
S...

640
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:02,885
so it's your sworn testimony
that you have loved rex rexroth...

641
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,951
since first you met?

642
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:10,056
Yes.

00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,536

Solemnly swear that the testimony
you are about to give shall be the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

658
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,063
so help you god?

Mais bien sur.
But of course, yes.

Have a seat, sir.

Did you sleep with him?

Don't be a fool.

[Elsbieta yips]

666
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,945
Baron von espy,
what is your profession?

667
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,748
[Laughs]
Silly man. I am a baron.

668
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,756
Yes, but do you not
also hold a day job?

669
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,349
Paying job.
A, uh, a square job.

670
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,360
Well, one has to live.

671
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,363
I am the concierge
of les pantalons rouges...

672
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,662
at bad-gadesbourg
in the canton of uri.

673
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,600
And what does that job entail?

674
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,436
I satisfy such requests
as the clientele may present.

675
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,169
[Miles]
Towels, ice, et cetera?

676
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,108
We have bellmen for that.
No, no, no.

677
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:05,012
Such requests that, were you at home,
you would address not to your valet...

678
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,016
but to your majordomo.

679
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,676
Shush, poochy-chow.

680
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,880
I see. Baron, do you
recognize that woman?

681
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,391
Ah, cher marylin.
But of course.

682
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,949
Look who is here. Hi!

[Chuckles]

684
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,057
And she was a guest
of the red... trousers?

685
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,694
[Von espy]
Oh, many times,

686
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,705
for relaxing
and making alpine recreation.

[Elsbieta yips, snarls]

688
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,543
Mm-hmm. I am curious about
her visit of five years ago.

689
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:36,239
January 1998.

690
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,579
Can you remember
any specific request
she made at that time?

691
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:44,212
- Yes, i can.
- At what, at that time,
did she tell you she required?

692
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:47,257
She said that she required...

693
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,259
a husband!

[Elsbieta yipping]

695
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:55,254
Do you want some bones? Huh?
Does elsbieta want some bones?
[Spectators murmuring]

696
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,198
Has anyone any bones?

697
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:01,068
Does anyone have any bones?
B... uh, bones? Dog candies?

698
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:05,040
No, they are not candies. Milk-bones.
Hard, crunchy bones for the teeth.

699
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,202
Uh, hard, uh...
[judge munson clears throat]

700
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,406
[Stammering]
We'll attend to the dog later.

701
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,346
Now, baron...
[elsbieta whimpers]

702
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,543
Where were we?

703
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,588
"She said that
she required a husband.

"Does elsbieta want some bones?

706
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,027
Has anyone any bones?
Hard, crunchy bones for the..."

707
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,031
right.

708
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,966
Now, a husband.
That's an unusual request.

709
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,970
Did she specify what kind
of a husband she was looking for?

710
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,972
[Whispers]
Stop him.
Objection.

711
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,441
- Grounds?
- Uh... hearsay.

712
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,809
It's not secondhand, your honor.
This is direct testimony
about the baron's own conversation.

713
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,043
- I'm going to allow it.
- Yeah.

714
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,348
She said she wanted
a very rich husband.

715
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,619
She wanted to know
the businesses and the wealths-s...
the wealths-s-s...

716
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:59,959
can i say this?
Wealths of our various eligible guests.

717
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,464
And did she have
any other specifications?

718
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,900
- Objection, your honor. Inflammatory.
- What's good for the gander, your honor.

719
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,406
- Is this a legal argument...
"what's good for the gander"?
- You got to play your tape, freddy.

720
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,408
Mr. Massey has a point there.
I'm going to allow it.

721
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,967
Were there any other
specifications?

722
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:18,071
She "specificated" a silly man.

723
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:21,016
Objection, your honor.!
I'm going to allow it.

724
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,851
She "specificated" a man who,
though clever at making money,

725
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,015
would be easily duped
and controlled.

726
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,026
Objection, your honor.
Shut up, freddy.
She's allowing it.

727
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,120
She "specificated'"a man
with a wandering pee-pee.

728
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:37,691
How you say? Aphilanderer whose affairs
would be transparent to the world.

729
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,201
Objection, your honor!

730
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,604
Finally, a man whom
she could herself brazenly cuckold...

731
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,302
until such time
as she might choose to, uh...

732
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:49,312
we would say, "faire un coup
de marteau sur des fesses. '"

733
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,974
You would say,
"make hammer on his fanny."

734
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:55,280
- Your honor, objection.! L-irrelevant.!
- I'm going to allow it!

735
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,879
Tell us, baron...
did you introduce her to such a man?

736
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,514
Sir, i am the concierge!

737
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,617
And to whom did you introduce
that calculating woman?

738
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,060
I introduced her...

739
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,223
to that silly man.

740
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,960
[Spectators gasping, murmuring]
Your honor, objection.!

741
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:14,061
Let the record show that the baron
has identified rex rexroth as the silly man!

742
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,901
[Baron]
I did it.! It was i.!

743
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,703
I introduced her
to that silly man!
[Gasping, murmuring continue]

744
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:22,507
- You son of a bitch!
- The red-faced angry one.
I introduced them!

745
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,708
Absolument!
I did it.! It was i.!

746
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,717
I just love trains!

747
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,219
I love trains!
If you please, sir!

748
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:33,723
[Grunting] i'm not sick.!
You're the one who's sick.!

749
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,658
No... [groaning]
If you please...

750
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,195
[strangulated]
Not the larynx!

751
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,094
Objection, your honor!
Strangling the witness!

752
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,996
I'm going to allow it.

753
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,433
[Growling]
[Elsbieta yipping]

754
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:47,434
Well, i think it stinks.

755
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,439
They left you with nothing.

756
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,442
Makes you wonder about
the entire legal system,

757
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,444
like rodney what's-his-name.

758
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,946
They bought
massey's argument.

759
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,949
If i lied or cheated
and was with rex only for his money,

760
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,882
then he shouldn't have to
give me any.

761
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:05,115
Well, that makes no sense.
Why else would you put in
all those years?

762
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,123
Oooh!
[Groans]

763
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,625
Are you all right,
sarah?
[Gasps]

764
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,627
[Sighs]
Yeah.
Wh-what is it?

765
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,629
[Sighs]
Peptic ulcer.

766
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:18,760
I have medication,
but i can't take it
before elective surgery.

767
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:22,101
[Sighs]
You shouldn't be
living here alone, sarah.

768
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,470
My goddamn husbands
gave me the ulcer.

769
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,908
But a bottle of bromo
can't love you back.

770
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,911
Yeah.

771
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,209
It's a catch-22.

772
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:34,445
I have to admit,
i don't like living alone.

773
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,452
I mean, do i need 46 rooms?

774
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,715
You could see people.

775
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,723
It's risky. Palimony.

776
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,726
Son of a bitch marvin mitchelson.

777
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:47,491
I'm telling you, honey, getting laid
is financial russian roulette.

778
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:52,628
Maybe i shouldjust tear it all down,
build a cottage.

779
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,501
More landscaping.

780
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:01,777
Well, with my money,
i can't afford to be fooling around.

781
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,779
Besides, i have you.

782
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,179
It'll be fun...
just the girls.

783
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:11,119
Well, thanks, sarah, but i can't
sleep on your couch forever.

784
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,622
I'm going to marry again,

785
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,818
nail the guy's ass good.

786
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:20,453
And this time
there'll be no puffy von espy.

787
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,544
Knock knock.

788
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,546
Excuse me. Mr. Donaly?

789
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,548
Mr. Donaly?
[Snorts]

790
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,016
Mr. Donaly, excuse me.

791
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,421
You are donovan donaly?

792
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,616
I'm in a meeting.
Mr. Donaly.

793
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,750
I need a name.

794
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:58,695
And, of course, we will have to litigate.
Sentence, paragraph.

795
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,561
Naturally, the first concern
for both parties...

796
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,404
is the welfare
of little wendelljunior.

797
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:09,572
Nevertheless, we do question
whether the continuing expenses
for his special ed classes...

798
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,081
are truly justified,
given the great strides...

799
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,141
[receptionist on intercom]
Mr. Massey, the senior partner
would like to see you.

800
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,380
Herb wants to see me?
If you have a moment.

Fourteen summaryjudgments sought.

Eighteen movements to void
for respondent's prejudice.

806
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,405
Eighteen granted.

807
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:12,840
Twelve court days
on the rexroth case alone.

808

[Wheezing]

809
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:20,248
320 billable hours paralegal services.
[Wheezing]

810
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:24,620
680 billable...

you are the engine...

00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:58,220

[Receptionist on intercom]
Mr. Massey?

823
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,033
Please, no calls.

824
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,035
I'm feeling... a little fragile.

825
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:17,039
I'm sorry, mr. Massey,
but i felt certain you'd want to know
marylin rexroth wants to see you.

826
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,042
Marylin... uh, uh, uh, w...
uh, when did she, uh...

827
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,044
she's here now.

828
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,047
Is she armed?
[Nervous laughter]
Give me a minute.

[Gargling]

830
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,927
Marylin.

831
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,429
How nice of you to...

832
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,431
marylin?

833
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,763
Shame on you.

834
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,769
Marylin.

835
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,828
What a lovely surprise.

836
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,907
Marylin, what a pl...

837
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,342
- who the hell are you?
- Hello, miles.

838
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:58,142
So nice of you to see us.

839
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:03,384
May i introduce
howard d. Doyle
of doyle oil.

840
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,387
I'm goddamn pleased
to meet you.

841
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:07,946
Marylin here,
she says you're the best.
Says you're aces.

842
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,721
Well, thank you, mr., uh...

843
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:15,231
uh, any... any relation
tojohn d. Doyle of doyle oil?

844
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,393
Oh, you must be talkin'
about grandpa john.
My papa's john d. Too.

845
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:21,403
The deuce, we called him.
You know, kinda the rebel
of the family.

846
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:24,565
But they knocked off
that wholejohn d. Routine
when they christened yours truly.

847
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,632
[Chuckling]
Grandpa nearly had a stroke.

848
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:30,339
He did have a stroke,
but that was later,
during the labor activity in '52.

849
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,348
The government
stepped in.
Mm-hmm. Uh...

850
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,441
they called it mediation.
Well...

851
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,486
he called it
incipient communism.

852
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,487
Of course, that's when
he had his stroke.

853
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:41,490
Golly, the whole left side of his body
is as useless as tits on a boar hog.

854
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:44,493
He lingered in a vegetative state
for years...
well, that is fascinating, mr. Doyle.

855
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,495
What say we have a seat?
A seat?

856
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:49,999
Marylin's had me runnin'
up and down rodeo drive all day long.

857
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:53,002
Kinda hit-and-run shoppin', you know.
Take no prisoners.

858
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,005
Forced march kind of thing.
My god, my dogs are barkin'.

859
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:59,008
We started out at this li'i ol' place
right off of wilshire...
it's been quite a day.

860
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:00,941
Had pewter things.

861
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:05,812
But anyway, miles, i know you're busy
and you charge by the hour,
so i'll get straight to the point.

862
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,648
Howard d. And i
are planning to marry.

863
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:15,457
Well...

864
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:18,983
well, i suppose
that congratulations are in order.
[Doyle] well, thank you, miles.

865
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:24,295
You know, the urge to wedlock
and form a lastin'monogamous bond
sanctified by ritual, it's pert-near universal.

866
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:28,327
As a matter of fact,
it might be of some interest to you,
bein'in a related business...

867
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,340
even your indigenous americans...
uh, i believe it was your cree... used to...

868
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:35,344
howard and i are here
because i've learned,
through bitter experience,

869
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:39,576
that when it comes
to matrimony and law,
you are the very best.

870
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,711
And as you are well aware,
my previous marriage...

871
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:47,188
ended in an unjustified stain...

872
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,191
upon my reputation.

873
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,193
My motives were impugned.

874
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,593
I was slandered in court.

875
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,360
I was painted a harlot.

876
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,367
Oh, honey, you ain't no harlot.

877
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,369
Oh, yes, honey.

878
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:04,874
So it's my desire to remove
any trace of suspicion...

879
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,503
from the mind
of my dear howard doyle.

880
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:10,512
Oh, honey, come on, now.

881
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,912
I wish to execute
a prenuptial agreement.

882
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:16,419
And i'm dead-set against it.
I mean, just anti the whole deal.

883
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,420
Howard's lawyers prefer it.

884
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,422
I insist upon it.

885
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:24,221
Oh, damn lawyers.
Uh, no offense to the present company
or anything, you know.

886
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,923
Now, is it my understanding
that the massey prenup
has never been penetrated?

887
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,133
That is correct.

888
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:34,227
Not to blow my own horn,
but they devote an entire semester to it
at harvard law.

889
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,273
They got a hell of a school up there,
ain't no doubt about it.

890
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:40,276
We donated that doyle building
up there here a while back.
Mm-hmm.

891
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:43,108
Now, i myself went to texas a&m.
I'm an aggie.

892
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,114
- Business?
- Tight end.

893
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:48,117
And i had a fair amount of success
against the split-t defense.

894
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,653
See, when they line up
symmetrical thataway,

895
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:54,555
it allows me to buttonhook
and, you know, do a down-and-in,
up-and-out and different things...

896
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,717
post pattern
every now and then.

897
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:58,727
Your tight ends
don't generally run a post.

898
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,956
[Stammering]
But if the qb calls it,
hell, i'm ready.

899
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:02,293
Interrupt for a second?
Yeah.

900
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:07,235
I wanna make sure
that you both understand...
what it is you're asking.

901
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:11,138
The massey prenup
provides that in the event
of a dissolution of the marriage,

902
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,142
for any reason,

903
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:17,169
both parties will leave it
with what they brought in...
and earned during.

904
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:20,182
No one can profit
from the marriage.

905
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:23,447
The prenup protects
the wealthier party.

906
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,583
Without it, that party is exposed,
a sitting duck.

907
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,593
Not a hell of a lot
of romance in that.

908
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:34,129
No, sir, there is not.
No romance.

909
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,791
More to the point,
no wriggle room.

910
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,268

Howard and i are very much in love.

I don't know what you're thinking,

You sign the prenup,

Thanks for the professional help.

Marylin, think of me for a moment...

not as an attorney but as a friend.

and all of a sudden, the rules

two-week divorce without a lawyer."

1079
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:46,172
Made me sick to my stomach.

Good god.
Talk about your oxymoron.

are you talkin' about?

1083
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:58,611
- Freddy.
- [Wrigley] i had lunch
with freddy bender yesterday.

1084
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:02,055
He tells me
that marylin rexroth-doyle
is now richer than croesus.

1085
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:05,720
Ah, yes, but is she richer
than mrs. Croesus?

1086
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:08,559
She could buy and sell you
10 times over.
She...

1087

- my god, is that her?
- Mmm.

1088
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:17,266
Freddy said she was flying in with him.
Celebrating, i guess.

1089
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,003
I'm fascinated by that creature.
Richer than me, huh?

1090
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:23,705
Well, she deserves every penny.

1091
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:28,080
And now she's single again.
Excuse me.

1092
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:30,847
No. You should stay away
from her, miles.

You promised to have dinner with me
once you were free.

1107
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:29,134
I said i wouldn't whilst i wasn't,
which implies no promise once i am.

Marylin, this is
a moment to savor.

Yes, we were adversaries,

but we were also professionals.

So let us raise a glass

Friends,

this morning i stand before you
a very different miles massey...

1223
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:26,768
than the one that
addressed you last year...

on the disposition of marital assets
following murder/suicide.

1225
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:34,774
I wish to talk to you today
not about technical matters oflaw.

I wish to talk to you
about something more important.

I wish to talk to you
from the heart...

It's a word
we matrimonial lawyers avoid.

1235
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:30,600
Funny, isn't it?
We're frightened of this emotion,
which is, in a sense,

1236
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,663

I am, of course, aware that these remarks
will be received here with cynicism.

1244
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:13,443
Cynicism, that cloak
that advertises our indifference...

1245
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:15,574
and hides all human feeling.

1246
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:19,109
Well, i'm here to tell you that that cynicism
which we think protects us...

destroys our clients,

and, ultimately,
destroys ourselves.

01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:33,529
Colleagues, when our clients come to us
confused and angry and hurting...

1251
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:37,197
because their flame of love
is guttering and threatens to die,

1252
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:40,366
do we seek to extinguish that flame
so that we can sift...

1253
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:43,377
through the smoldering wreckage
for our paltry reward,

1254
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:46,414
or do we fan
this precious flame,

1255
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:51,283
this most precious flame,
back into loving, roaring life?

1256
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:55,380
Do we counsel fear or trust?

Do we seek to destroy or build?

1258
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:02,388
Do we meet our clients'problems
with cynicism...

1259
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:05,756
or with love?

1260

The choice is, of course,
each of ours.

For my part, i've made the leap of love,
and there's no going back.

the same kind of financial remuneration

01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:52,233
it's mr. Smith's address,
although mr. Smith is not
directly involved.

1365
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:56,498
Because of an impending legal matter,
we need this to happen
within a certain time frame.

1366
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:59,870
- On an expedited basis.
- You're in a rush.

1367
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:02,273
We're not in a rush.
Mr. Smith is.

[Inhaler hissing]

Sh... sh... sh... she won't...
she won't suffer, will she?

1370
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,459
Not unless you pay extra.
[Train whistle blows]

1371

Oh, i've been workin'

I've been workin' on the railroad

[rex]
Can't you hear the whistle blowing
[all whooping, laughing]

Whistle's goin' "toot-toot."
[Laughter subsides]

1379
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:51,954
What's the matter, rexie?

[Wrigley]
Hello?

1382
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:06,168
Yes, he's here.
One moment, please.

Miles.

1384

It's for you.

Hello? Yes?

1386
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:44,201
What?

1387
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:49,046
I see.

1388
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:51,585
[Phone beeps off]
My god.

1389
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:55,248
- What?
- That was marvin untermeyer.

1390
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:58,417
He was rex rexroth's
personal attorney.

1391
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:00,427
Yes?

1392
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:02,360
What do you mean, he was?

1393
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:07,197
Rex had a massive coronary
in the middle of a business meeting.

1394
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:09,202
He's dead.

1395
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,670
Well, i'm very sorry to hear that,

1396
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:14,572
but you two weren't... close,
were you?

1397
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:19,773
Marvin said that rex's will
was four years old.
Never redrafted it.

1398
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:23,079
He was stinkin'rich.
Yes?

1399
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:27,578
Everything goes to marylin.

1400
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:36,589
She's not poor.
She's richer than you.

1401
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:39,656
She is exposed. No prenup.
She's a sitting duck.
[Line ringing]

1402
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:42,032
She's a sitting duck.
Can't kill her. No need.
Mm-hmm.

1403
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:44,799
No. It would be pointless.
She's exposed.
It's pointless.

1404
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:47,341
Exposed.
Why kill the only woman
you've ever loved when
she's the richer party?

1405
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:50,002
She's rich. And i love her.
Don't need to kill her.

Hi, it's miles smith...
mr. Smith... calling to say...

1409
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:00,479
on behalf of myself,
that it is...
no-go.

1410
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:02,420
Uh, no-go
concerning marylin.

1411
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:06,221
I'm speaking with no knowledge.
This is what mr. Smith wants.

1412
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:08,489
This is what i want.

1413
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:11,930
I am mr. Smith.
Thank you.

That was good.

- You think i'm protected?
- Ehh... you...

1416
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:20,604
am i protected?
I think it would hold up.

1417
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:23,075
- Marylin.
- Yes, yes. Marylin.

1418
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:26,307
- What do we do?
What if he's on his way there?
- Yes. Oh!

1419
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:29,817
- If he's on his way there...
- oh, no! Marylin!

1420
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:34,548
Get her out and buy some time.

Hello?

1423
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,690
Marylin, you must
leave the house immediately.

1424
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:45,756
It's imperative
that you leave the house.
Hello, miles.

1425
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:49,325
- Hello, dear.
- Now, miles, pending final settlement,

1426
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:52,202
you know that i'm entitled
to use the house.
No, no, no! You don't understand!

It's an emergency!

1428

What is it?
I forgot that i left the gas main on,
which leaks!

1429

- Good gosh. That sounds dangerous.
- It's a deadly, odorless, colorless,

No.

No one need be the wiser,
so you can just go on home.

01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,344
will you explain to the lunkhead
that it's a no-go?
No-go. It's a no-go.

- Hello, marylin.
- Hello, miles.

1471
01:31:05,226 --> 01:31:09,629
- This is where we first met, remember?
- Of course i remember.

1472
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:16,368
It's hard to believe that when
you walk out that door today,
you'll be walking out of my life forever.

1473
01:31:17,738 --> 01:31:19,433
It's not something
i wanted either.

1474
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:21,498
But, then, i guess...

1475
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:25,301
something inside of me died...

1476
01:31:25,379 --> 01:31:28,940
when i realized that
you'd hired a goon to kill me.

1477
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:32,577
Wait a minute.
You hired him to kill me.
No. Both of you wait a minute.

1478
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:35,781
- Nobody hired anyone to kill anyone.
- Hear, hear.

1479
01:31:35,857 --> 01:31:38,883
Apparently, from what i can gather,
a burglar broke into your house.

[Wrigley]
Miles's house.
Whatever! [clears throat]

intending to loot the place,

over his lifestyle
and shot himself.

- Well, we've outlined a settlement.

to consider a reconciliation.

miles, after all this?

1486
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:07,020
[Freddy]
See, that's exactly right. The point is...
you wounded me first, marylin.

1487
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:10,353
I'm not proud of what i've done,
but god knows, i did trust you once.

01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:16,158
If you couldjust...
just give us another chance.

1489
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:21,258
[Chuckles] well, if you'll pardon me here,
but i think my client is well beyond
the point of considering...

1490
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:25,328
how could i ever trust you again?
I mean, really trust you, miles?

1491
01:32:39,687 --> 01:32:43,714
Marylin, there is nothing
in the massey prenup that says...

1492
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:47,022
it can't be executed
after the parties wed.

1493

Well, if this, uh, indeed
is a massey prenup,

1494
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:57,803
and a cursory examination
tends to support that it is, then...

You're exposed.

From a tv producer.

1503
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:52,357
I think you know him.
I gave him an idea for a new show,
so he made me a partner.

1504
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:01,799
I guess that means i'm a partner.
I guess it does.

i am just a poor boy
though my story's seldom told

1534
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:40,112
i have squandered my resistance

1535
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:45,056
for a pocketful of mumbles
such are promises

1536
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:48,227
all lies andjest

1537
01:37:48,295 --> 01:37:51,560
still, a man hears
what he wants to hear

1538
01:37:51,632 --> 01:37:54,601
and disregards the rest

1539
01:38:00,941 --> 01:38:03,808
when i left my home
and my family

1540
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:06,312
i was no more than a boy

1541
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:09,406
in the company of strangers

1542
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:14,944
in the quiet of a railway station
running scared

1543
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:19,924
laying low
seeking out the poorer quarters

1544
01:38:19,994 --> 01:38:22,656
where the ragged people go

1545
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:27,531
searching for the places
only they would know

1551
01:38:50,124 --> 01:38:53,321
but i get no offers

1552
01:38:53,394 --> 01:38:57,888
just a come-on from the whores
on seventh avenue

1553
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,197
i do declare

1554
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:04,294
there were times
when i was so lonesome

1555
01:39:04,371 --> 01:39:07,534
i took some comfort there
