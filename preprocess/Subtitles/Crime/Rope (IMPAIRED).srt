1
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:22,777
(Man Screaming)

2
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:40,182
Open it.

3
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:12,383
Don't.

4
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:17,782
- We've got to see if -
- I know.

5
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:20,985
But not just yet.

6
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:24,180
Let's stay this 
way for a minute.

7
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:47,377
Phillip,
 we don't have too much time.

8
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:53,861
It's the darkness that's got you down.
Nobody feels really safe in the dark.

9
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:57,860
Nobody who's ever a child, that is.
I'll open these, alright?

10
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,455
There.
 That's much better.

11
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:12,062
What a lovely evening.

12
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:22,346
Pity we couldn't have done it with
the curtains open in the bright sunlight.

13
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:25,979
Well...

14
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:29,461
We can't have everything,
 can we?

15
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:32,264
We did do it in daytime.

16
00:04:32,427 --> 00:04:34,223
Alright now,
 Phillip?

17
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:35,216
- Yes.
- Good.

18
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:39,504
You better put those away in my
chequebook drawer behind the box.

19
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:58,778
Now...

20
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:01,461
It's a museum piece now.

21
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:04,346
We really should 
preserve it for posterity,

22
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:08,658
except, it's such good crystal
and I'd hate to break up the set.

23
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:16,382
Out of this,
David Kentley had his last drink.

24
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:20,625
It should have been ginger ale,
or even beer.

25
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:25,415
It was out of character for David
to drink anything as corrupt as whiskey.

26
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:28,180
Out of character
for him to be murdered, too.

27
00:05:28,346 --> 00:05:33,341
Yes, wasn't it? Good Americans
usually die young on the battlefield.

28
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:37,944
Well, the Davids of this world
merely occupy space,

29
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:43,100
which is why he was
the perfect victim for the perfect murder.

30
00:05:43,665 --> 00:05:47,262
'Course,
he was a Harvard undergraduate.

31
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:49,987
That might make it 
justifiable homicide.

32
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:53,024
He's dead and we've killed him.
But he's still here.

33
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:57,146
In less than eight hours
he'll be resting at the bottom of a lake.

34
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:59,298
Meanwhile,
 he's here.

35
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:03,899
- What are you doing?
- It's not locked.

36
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:08,139
All the better. It's more dangerous.
And the lock's too old. It won't work.

37
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:11,218
I wish it would.
I wish we had him out of here.

38
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:13,536
I wish it were somebody else.

39
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,983
It's a trifle late for that,
 don't you think?

40
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:20,059
Whom would you have preferred,
Kenneth?

41
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:23,024
I don't know,
I suppose anyone was as good...

42
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:25,461
or as bad as any other.

43
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:30,096
You, perhaps.
 You frighten me.

44
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,896
You always have,
from that very first day in prep school.

45
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:37,059
Part of your charm,
 I suppose.

46
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:42,223
I'm only kidding,
 Brandon.

47
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:47,096
I obviously can't take it as well as you,
so I'm turning on you a little.

48
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:52,295
- That's rather foolish, isn't it?
- Yes, very.

49
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:55,538
May I have a drink now?

50
00:06:56,346 --> 00:07:00,420
By all means. This is an occasion.
It calls for champagne.

51
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,817
- Champagne?
- I put some in the icebox.

52
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:06,423
- When did you put it there?
- Just before David arrived.

53
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:09,146
- You knew it would work.
- Of course.

54
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:12,663
You know I never did anything
unless I did it perfectly.

55
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:15,625
I've always wished
for more artistic talent.

56
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:17,937
Well,
 murder can be an art too.

57
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:22,975
The power to kill can be just
as satisfying as the power to create.

58
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:28,983
Phillip, do you realise we've actually
done it, exactly as we planned?

59
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:32,855
And not a single thing has gone wrong.
It was perfect.

60
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:35,415
- Yes.
- An immaculate murder!

61
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:39,100
We've killed for the sake of danger
and for the sake of killing.

62
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:42,656
We're alive,
 truly and wonderfully alive.

63
00:07:42,826 --> 00:07:45,216
Champagne can't equal us,
or the occasion.

64
00:07:45,387 --> 00:07:46,819
I'll take it,
 though.

65
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:48,898
You aren't frightened any more,
 are you?

66
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,500
Neither of us can have fear.

67
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:53,701
That's the difference
between us and them.

68
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:56,540
They talk about committing
the perfect crime but don't do it.

69
00:07:56,706 --> 00:08:01,064
Nobody commits a murder just for...
the experiment of committing it.

70
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:03,343
Nobody except us.

71
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:07,425
- You're not frightened still, are you?
- No.

72
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:09,862
Not even of me?

73
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:12,894
- No.
- That's good.

74
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:17,906
You just astound me,
 as always.

75
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:20,023
That's even better.

76
00:08:21,187 --> 00:08:23,461
To David,
 of course.

77
00:08:31,706 --> 00:08:34,504
- Brandon, how did you feel?
- When?

78
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:36,259
During it.

79
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:39,222
I don't know,
 really.

80
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,822
I don't remember
feeling very much of anything,

81
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:47,464
until his body went limp

82
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,780
and I knew it was over.

83
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:55,461
- And then?
- Then I felt tremendously exhilarated.

84
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:59,899
H-How did you feel?

85
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:02,942
Oh, l... I...

86
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:10,135
- You don't think the party's a mistake?
- No, it's the finishing touch to our work.

87
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:12,865
It's more.
It's the signature of the artists.

88
00:09:13,027 --> 00:09:15,143
Not having it would be like,
 uh...

89
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:18,058
Painting the picture 
and not hanging it?

90
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,979
That's not a good 
choice of words.

91
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:22,534
It may end up too choice,
thanks to the party.

92
00:09:22,706 --> 00:09:25,937
Oh, rot. This party will be
the most exciting ever given.

93
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:28,380
- With these people?
- Oh, they're a dull crew.

94
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:32,859
The Kentleys couldn't be duller if
they tried, but we did have to have them.

95
00:09:33,027 --> 00:09:36,620
After all,
they are David's mother and father.

96
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:39,062
That doesn't make them
any easier to talk to.

97
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:42,058
Don't worry.
Janet'll be buttering them up, poor girl.

98
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:45,344
She's banked everything
on hooking David.

99
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:49,293
Somehow, I don't think
she's going to succeed.

100
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:53,254
- Do you?
- No, somehow I don't.

101
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,985
Well, she can switch back
to Kenneth tonight.

102
00:09:56,147 --> 00:10:01,822
You must admit, it was most considerate
of me in view of recent events to...

103
00:10:07,547 --> 00:10:09,264
- Phillip?
- What?

104
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:11,418
- Take the other one.
- What for?

105
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:14,702
Never mind.
 Come with me.

106
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:19,224
- What's this all about?
- You'll see. It's brilliant.

107
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,783
What the devil are you doing?

108
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:31,859
Making our work of 
art a masterpiece.

109
00:10:32,027 --> 00:10:35,224
- Brandon, you're going too far.
- Why? What do you mean?

110
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:39,538
I just thought it'd be nice
to have supper in here...

111
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,105
on this.

112
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,817
Isn't it a good idea?

113
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:50,426
Well, at least this way
no one will try to open it.

114
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:53,259
I don't think you appreciate me,
 Phillip.

115
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:55,065
I'm beginning to,
 Brandon.

116
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,902
Come on, we don't have much time.
Mrs Wilson will be back soon.

117
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,820
Did you forget to borrow her key?
I might've known -

118
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,783
I didn't forget.
 I have her key.

119
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:07,254
- Oh, good.
- How are you going to explain this?

120
00:11:07,427 --> 00:11:09,894
- I'm not.
- We've got to have some excuse.

121
00:11:14,346 --> 00:11:17,817
- We can't leave our guest alone.
- We must have an excuse for the others.

122
00:11:17,985 --> 00:11:19,543
Let me think.

123
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:26,538
Really, you get much too upset
much too easily, Phillip.

124
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:30,096
We have a very simple excuse

125
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:32,258
right here.

126
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:36,221
What are you worrying about,
 Phillip?

127
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:38,980
Mr Kentley's coming
mainly to look at books.

128
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:41,740
What could be better than having them
on the dining room table

129
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:44,466
where the poor old man
can easily get at them.

130
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:48,302
Considerate, aren't we?
 (Phone Ringing)

131
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,706
Hello? Oh,
 of course.

132
00:11:57,346 --> 00:11:59,099
- You start on the books -
- Who is it?

133
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:01,461
Mrs Wilson.

134
00:12:19,147 --> 00:12:21,138
Brandon?

135
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:24,543
Brandon!

136
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:29,183
What the devil?
Don't you have any more sense than to...

137
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:31,099
What is it?

138
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:34,177
- Well, go on, yank it out.
- I can't.

139
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:36,576
If Mrs Wilson were here,
she'd yank it out for you.

140
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:40,740
A stupid display like that in front of
others will be as good as a confession.

141
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:43,296
Take these and get 
ahold of yourself.

142
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:45,537
If you'd let me keep the light on,
I would have seen it.

143
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:47,618
Alright!
 You're perfect.

144
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:49,014
We have to be,
 Phillip.

145
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:54,100
We agreed there was only one crime we
could commit, that of making a mistake.

146
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:57,464
- Being weak is a mistake.
- Because it's being human?

147
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,187
Because it's being ordinary.
I won't let either of us do -

148
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,336
(Door Buzzer)

149
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:14,062
You owe me $2.40 for taxis,
including the tip.

150
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:16,138
If it weren't for the traffic,
I'd have been here a half hour ago.

151
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:19,058
It's just as well.
We didn't expect you back until now.

152
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:21,581
I went to five stores
for the special pâté we like.

153
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:25,023
But the prices! I couldn't see any
reason for throwing away good money.

154
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:29,178
So, I went downtown to that little
delicatessen where Mr Cadell goes.

155
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:32,735
But I tell ya, the next time
we give a party, I'm only going to -

156
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:34,898
Good evening,
 Mrs Wilson.

157
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,662
What, may I ask,
is happening to my table?

158
00:13:40,826 --> 00:13:44,263
We're just moving 
the things in here.

159
00:13:44,427 --> 00:13:46,418
Well...

160
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:49,740
I personally
thought my table was quite lovely.

161
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:51,100
Oh,
 it was quite lovely.

162
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:56,658
But Mr Kentley is coming to look
at these old books I had in the chest.

163
00:13:56,826 --> 00:14:01,615
You wouldn't want the poor old man
to have to get on his knees to see them?

164
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:03,582
Well, I think it looks 
downright peculiar.

165
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:05,144
- Peculiar?
- Very.

166
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:07,899
Particularly those candlesticks.
They don't belong there at all.

167
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:12,345
On the contrary, I think they suggest a...
a ceremonial altar,

168
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:15,418
which you can heap with the foods
for our sacrificial feast.

169
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:17,100
Hmph,
 heap is right.

170
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:20,259
Isn't enough room for me to set
things out properly, is there, Mr Phillip?

171
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,542
Oh,
 you can make it do.

172
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:23,457
You two'll be the death of me.
What's to be done with the books?

173
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,423
We'll lay them out
on the dining room table.

174
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:27,623
A crazy idea,
 if you ask me.

175
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:30,096
Well, I have too much to do
to discuss this thoroughly, dear.

176
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:32,576
I still think it's peculiar.

177
00:14:32,745 --> 00:14:34,658
- What on earth is the matter?
- I was sure she'd notice.

178
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:36,897
- Notice what?
- The rope, of course.

179
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,056
Brandon,
 we've got to hide it.

180
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:39,625
- Why?
- Why?

181
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:43,380
Yes, why? It's only a piece of rope,
an ordinary household article.

182
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:45,615
Why hide it?

183
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:48,426
It belongs in the 
kitchen drawer.

184
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:07,860
- Mrs Wilson?
- Yes?

185
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:09,538
There's champagne in the icebox.

186
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:12,301
- We're not giving them champagne?
- We are.

187
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:16,221
Oh, it's going to be that kind of party.
I'd better doll up a little.

188
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:19,298
We only serve champagne
at Mr Cadell's on very high occasions.

189
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:23,142
Matter of fact, he and I once had
a glass together on my birthday.

190
00:15:23,307 --> 00:15:27,014
Tonight, Mrs Wilson, you'll have
an opportunity to renew that romance.

191
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:29,985
May l?
 Mr Cadell's coming.

192
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:33,822
Oh, my. Oh,
 Mr Cadell is terribly nice.

193
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:37,263
- Rupert's coming?
- Yes, I thought I told you.

194
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:40,066
No, you didn't.

195
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:45,062
Some people say he's a little peculiar,
but I always thi...

196
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:47,695
Well,
 you might let me finish.

197
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:50,620
I thought you liked Rupert.

198
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:52,980
- I do.
- Well, then?

199
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:56,855
Of all the people on this Earth, Rupert
Cadell is the one man likely to suspect.

200
00:15:57,027 --> 00:16:00,062
He's the one man who might appreciate
this from our angle, the artistic one.

201
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,615
- That's what's exciting.
- I'm glad it excites you. It frightens me.

202
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:05,301
I suggest you keep 
your voice down.

203
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:08,937
It would have been too easy
with the others, Phillip, and too dull.

204
00:16:09,105 --> 00:16:13,225
As for Rupert,
I once thought of inviting him to join us.

205
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:16,423
- Why didn't you? The more the merrier.
- He hasn't the nerve.

206
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:18,498
Oh, intellectually,
he could've come along. He's brilliant.

207
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,498
But he's a little 
too fastidious.

208
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:23,418
He could've invented and admired
but he never could have acted.

209
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:26,306
That's where we're superior.
We have courage. Rupert doesn't.

210
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:30,096
Mr Cadell got a bad leg in the war for his
courage. You've got your sleeve in the celery.

211
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:34,942
(Door Buzzer)
They're here. Are we ready?

212
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:36,426
As ready as we'll ever be.

213
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:39,418
Don't you be so busy
at that piano that you don't eat.

214
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:40,815
You're getting too thin.

215
00:16:40,985 --> 00:16:43,820
And don't you let them gobble up
that pâté before you have any.

216
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:47,138
Let's hope it's a success.
 Oh, my tray.

217
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,423
Take it in the kitchen.
I'll answer the door.

218
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:53,260
There wouldn't be this last minute
hustle bustle if you'd kept my table...

219
00:16:53,427 --> 00:16:56,658
Now the fun begins.

220
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,418
- Hello, come in.
(Kenneth) - How are you, Brandon?

221
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:04,782
- Fine. Just put your hat there.
- Thank you.

222
00:17:04,947 --> 00:17:06,264
It's been quite a while.

223
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:11,454
Yes, that's why I sounded so stupid
on the phone. Surprised, I guess.

224
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:14,576
- Hello, Kenneth. Good to see you.
- You too.

225
00:17:14,746 --> 00:17:17,817
- Been up to much lately?
- Oh, nothing to speak of. You?

226
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:22,615
Trying to get ready for exams. I have
to start cramming before everyone else.

227
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:25,060
- Am I the first?
- You are.

228
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:27,104
Why is it I'm always too early
at parties?

229
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:29,096
Probably because 
you're always on time.

230
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:31,622
Mrs Wilson,
 champagne.

231
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:32,776
Oh.

232
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:35,982
It... It isn't someone's 
birthday, is it?

233
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:39,694
Don't look so worried, Kenneth.
It's really almost the opposite.

234
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:40,663
The opposite?

235
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,818
Phillip's bidding the world a temporary
farewell. I'm driving him to Connecticut.

236
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:46,020
Oh.
 Where are you going?

237
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:48,621
To Brandon's mother's place
for a few weeks.

238
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:50,855
- I'm to be locked up.
- What?

239
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:53,257
To make sure he practices
six hours a day.

240
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:56,544
- I've finally wrangled a debut for him.
- Town Hall, at that.

241
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:58,823
That's wonderful.
I hope you knock 'em dead.

242
00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:00,306
Thank you.

243
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:03,105
Mmm.
 Most decorative.

244
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:06,135
Think so?

245
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:08,537
- Hey.
- What is it?

246
00:18:08,707 --> 00:18:10,823
- I feel pretty honoured.
- Oh, why?

247
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:13,421
Well, it looks like
a pretty small farewell party.

248
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:16,499
Well, we're really killing two birds
with one stone.

249
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:18,498
The party's also for Mr Kentley.

250
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,544
- David's father?
- Yes.

251
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:24,143
Oh. Is...
 David going to be here?

252
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:27,298
- Of course.
- Who else is coming?

253
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:29,219
No one you don't know,
if that's what's bothering you.

254
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:32,663
- The Kentleys, Janet Walker -
- Janet?

255
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:36,022
Yes. I thought you'd 
be glad to see her.

256
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:38,134
Won't you be?

257
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:41,423
Brandon,
 Janet and I are all washed up.

258
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:45,214
- Didn't you know?
- I'm sorry, I didn't.

259
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:46,422
Well, you knew,
 Phillip?

260
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:50,785
Oh, I'd heard vague rumours, but I never
pay attention to that sort of thing.

261
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:52,221
I wish you had.
 (Door Buzzer)

262
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:56,141
- Why?
- Well, Janet and David are -

263
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:58,182
(Janet) Hello,
 Mrs Wilson.

264
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,496
- May l?
- Help yourself.

265
00:18:59,665 --> 00:19:04,261
Cheer up. I have a feeling your chances
with the lady are better than you think.

266
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:07,098
- What do you mean?
(Brandon) - Janet.

267
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:10,661
Hello, ducks.
 Angel!

268
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:12,895
Be careful of my hair.
 It took hours.

269
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:17,219
- You smell dreamy. What is it?
- That swill you gave me last Christmas.

270
00:19:17,385 --> 00:19:20,459
- I knew I had good taste.
- You do. You look lovely.

271
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,141
I won't by the time 
it's all paid for.

272
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:25,775
Was that funny?
I never know when I'm being funny.

273
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:28,618
Whenever I try to be,
I lay the bomb of all time.

274
00:19:28,787 --> 00:19:31,221
- Phillip, sweet.
- Hello.

275
00:19:31,385 --> 00:19:33,855
What's this rumour
I hear about you and Town Hall?

276
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:37,779
I bet you're going to play a foul trick
on all of us and become...

277
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:38,934
horribly famous.

278
00:19:39,105 --> 00:19:42,144
I believe you've met.

279
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:46,019
- Hello, Ken.
- Hello, Jan.

280
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,816
That was fascinating, wasn't it?
I seem to have run down.

281
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:52,660
What would you say
to some champagne?

282
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:54,781
'Hello,
 champagne.'

283
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,982
You see what I mean
about trying to be funny?

284
00:19:58,145 --> 00:19:59,703
- How've you been, Ken?
- Fine, thanks.

285
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,538
- How's the new job?
- What are you doing?

286
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:05,382
Writing that same dreary column
on how to keep the body beautiful.

287
00:20:05,547 --> 00:20:09,778
- For whom this time?
- An untidy little magazine called Allure.

288
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:11,663
Thanks, chum.

289
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:18,737
- Oh, isn't that painting new?
(Brandon) - Yes it is. Do you like it?

290
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:22,104
- Well, what is it?
- New Young American Primitive.

291
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:23,825
I have a new young 
American sister.

292
00:20:23,987 --> 00:20:26,979
She's three
and her stuff is really primitive.

293
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:28,625
(Laughing)
(Janet quietly) - You dirty dog.

294
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:33,222
(Brandon quietly) - Why?
- Didn't I notice another one in the foyer?

295
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:36,220
I don't think so.
 Which?

296
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:42,424
This.

297
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:47,656
- I could really strangle you, Brandon.
- What have I done now?

298
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:50,660
At times, your sense of humour
is a little too malicious, chum.

299
00:20:50,826 --> 00:20:52,384
What are you chattering about?

300
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:54,740
- Why did you invite Kenneth?
- Well, why not?

301
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:56,625
You know perfectly well why not.

302
00:20:56,787 --> 00:21:00,300
We called it quits ages ago and I'm
practically engaged to his best friend.

303
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,855
- David?
- Yes, David.

304
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:04,903
Which makes everything
just ginger-peachy.

305
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:09,980
I'm terribly sorry, but it is difficult
trying to keep up with your romances.

306
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,182
After me came Kenneth,
and now it's David.

307
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:16,737
Why the switch
from Kenneth to David, anyway?

308
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:21,740
- Obviously, I think he's nicer.
- Well, he's certainly richer.

309
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:25,297
That's a new low even for you,
 chum.

310
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:28,140
(Kenneth) - Gave me a 'D' in conduct.
(Phillip) - How's your drink doing?

311
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:32,585
How many years has it been since I said,
'Oh, it tickles'? And don't you tell me.

312
00:21:32,747 --> 00:21:35,896
- I hear Rupert's coming.
- He was invited, but you never know.

313
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:38,182
- I hope he does. How is he?
- Who is he?

314
00:21:38,346 --> 00:21:41,737
Rupert Cadell
was our housemaster in prep school.

315
00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:44,057
Housemaster for you 
three little dears?

316
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:48,059
Four little dears.
He tried valiantly to teach David, too.

317
00:21:48,227 --> 00:21:49,660
Rupert's a publisher now,
 isn't he?

318
00:21:49,826 --> 00:21:51,656
Successful?
 Maybe he can give me a job.

319
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:55,422
Rupert only publishes books he likes,
usually philosophy.

320
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:58,338
Oh. Small print,
 big words, no sales.

321
00:21:58,507 --> 00:22:01,067
- Right.
- Rupert's extremely radical.

322
00:22:01,227 --> 00:22:03,375
Do you know that he selects
his books on the assumption that

323
00:22:03,547 --> 00:22:06,505
people not only can read
but actually can think.

324
00:22:06,665 --> 00:22:09,338
- Curious fellow, but I like him.
- You always did.

325
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:12,499
Golly, those bull sessions you
and Rupert used to have in school.

326
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,306
Brandon would sit up till all hours
at the master's feet.

327
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,220
Brandon at someone's feet!
Who is this Rupert?

328
00:22:18,385 --> 00:22:21,777
- He used to tell you the weirdest things.
- Really? What sort of things?

329
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:27,419
I suppose Kenneth means Rupert's
impatience with social conventions.

330
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:32,615
For example, he thinks murder
is a crime for most men, but -

331
00:22:32,787 --> 00:22:34,698
- A privilege for the few.
- Yes.

332
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:41,703
It's alright, Mrs Wilson,
I'll answer the door.

333
00:22:41,865 --> 00:22:44,939
- Mr Kentley. So glad you could come.
- Thank you, Brandon.

334
00:22:45,105 --> 00:22:47,903
Mrs Kentley isn't well, so I took
the liberty of bringing my sister-in-law,

335
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,864
Mrs Atwater,
 who's staying with us.

336
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:53,019
- Delighted to have you.
- Delighted to come, dear boy.

337
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:57,384
I've been in New York two weeks.
Alice has been ill almost the whole time.

338
00:22:57,547 --> 00:23:00,538
Henry is forever 
cataloging his library.

339
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:03,617
Oh, no, Anita. Occasionally,
I even read one of my books.

340
00:23:03,787 --> 00:23:07,539
But I'm on a visit.
This is just my second party.

341
00:23:07,707 --> 00:23:10,824
- I suppose it's only fair -
- Let me take your things.

342
00:23:10,987 --> 00:23:13,057
- I'm sorry to hear Mrs Kentley's so ill.
- Oh, it's just a cold.

343
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:15,661
Colds can be very dangerous
this time of the year.

344
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:18,703
I hope Mrs Kentley's staying
in bed with lots of fruit juice.

345
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,742
- She is, thank you.
- Well, that'll do the trick.

346
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:25,057
Colds dangerous, in this heat?
I don't understand that at all.

347
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:27,787
Exactly two years ago
this summer I had one myself.

348
00:23:27,945 --> 00:23:30,017
I was down for three weeks.
The doctors -

349
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:33,179
Excuse me. This way,
 Mrs Atwater.

350
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:34,983
(Janet) ...
particularly at parties.

351
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:37,217
(Kenneth) This is over my head.

352
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:38,704
David!
 (Glass Crunching)

353
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:40,698
(Brandon)
Uh, no, you've made a mistake.

354
00:23:40,865 --> 00:23:42,538
This is Kenneth Lawrence.

355
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:43,901
(Mrs Atwater) Oh,
 I'm so sorry.

356
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,578
(Henry) That's alright,
 Anita.

357
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:50,182
Kenneth is often mistaken for David
even by people who aren't nearsighted.

358
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:54,181
We haven't had much opportunity to
observe the resemblance lately, my boy.

359
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:57,019
- Haven't been studying, have you?
- I've been trying to, sir.

360
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,415
Oh, dear.
The resemblance is only physical.

361
00:23:59,586 --> 00:24:01,862
I believe you both 
know Miss Walker.

362
00:24:02,027 --> 00:24:03,585
Janet, my dear.

363
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:07,342
I finished working out your horoscope
just before we came.

364
00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:10,817
- Oh, tell.
- The stars are very kind.

365
00:24:10,987 --> 00:24:13,943
They indicate a 
marriage very soon.

366
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:18,384
to a tall, fair-haired young man
with a very lovely father.

367
00:24:18,547 --> 00:24:21,903
- Oh, Anita, I told you that a week ago.
- Oh, well, I suppose you did.

368
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:24,786
- But the stars confirm it.
- Wonderful.

369
00:24:24,945 --> 00:24:27,017
(Brandon) Mrs Atwater,
may I present Mr Phillip Morgan?

370
00:24:27,185 --> 00:24:29,018
- How do you do?
- Oh, you've hurt your hand.

371
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:31,257
- Oh, it's nothing, just a little cut.
- What happened?

372
00:24:31,425 --> 00:24:33,987
Nothing. The glass was cracked
and it broke. That's all.

373
00:24:34,145 --> 00:24:37,262
- May I get you some champagne?
- Oh, I should adore some.

374
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:40,223
Daddy used to have a glass
every morning at eleven.

375
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:43,741
But of course,
 Henry doesn't like it.

376
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:45,578
Mr Kentley,
 may I get you some?

377
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:48,545
I'd prefer a little Scotch
with a lot of water, if you don't mind.

378
00:24:48,707 --> 00:24:51,016
Is David here?

379
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:54,019
I expected him to come with you.

380
00:24:54,185 --> 00:24:56,178
He called and said
that he'd meet us here.

381
00:24:56,346 --> 00:24:58,815
- Where did he call from?
- Our maid spoke to him.

382
00:24:58,987 --> 00:25:02,057
He was at the club,
studying for his examinations...

383
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:04,218
In tennis.

384
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:07,982
The trouble with David is, he doesn't
have to study. He's too bright.

385
00:25:08,145 --> 00:25:11,662
- David does alright, very much so.
- Thank you.

386
00:25:11,826 --> 00:25:16,057
- How's Mrs Kentley?
- As usual. It's a cold this time.

387
00:25:16,227 --> 00:25:19,344
I hope David arrives soon.
She wants him to call her.

388
00:25:19,507 --> 00:25:21,541
David's her only child,
 Mr Kentley.

389
00:25:21,707 --> 00:25:24,981
He's my only child too,
but I'm willing to let him grow up.

390
00:25:25,145 --> 00:25:27,136
Why don't I call
and tell her he's been detained.

391
00:25:27,307 --> 00:25:30,458
- No, you mustn't pamper her.
- David might have stopped to see her.

392
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,298
- Mr Kentley?
- May I use the phone?

393
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:34,423
- Of course. It's in the bedroom.
- How cosy.

394
00:25:34,586 --> 00:25:37,702
- Aren't you ready for another?
- I will be.

395
00:25:39,027 --> 00:25:41,096
I am,
 thank you.

396
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:43,904
(Henry) What a charming young man.
I wish David saw more of him.

397
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:47,582
(Janet) Yes.
 I'll go and call.

398
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:50,213
Kenneth,
there's too much air in your glass.

399
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:53,105
- Mine's fine, thanks.
- Would you mind taking this in to Janet?

400
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:55,019
Sure. Why?

401
00:25:55,185 --> 00:25:59,544
No particular reason. I thought you'd like
to take it to her. She's in the bedroom.

402
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:02,424
- Then you'd like David to walk in.
- No, that'd be too much of a shock.

403
00:26:04,905 --> 00:26:06,499
(Atwater) - When were you born?
(Phillip) - July 14.

404
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:10,453
- Can you really tell my future from that?
- I'm only an amateur astrologer.

405
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,095
- I'm sure you're very good.
- I do my best.

406
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:16,065
I suppose you want to know
if your concert will be a success.

407
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:19,105
- Yes, I do.
- Let me see now.

408
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:22,337
You were born on 
the 14th of July.

409
00:26:22,507 --> 00:26:25,463
You're Cancer, the crab.
You're a moon child.

410
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,825
You're very much influenced
by the moon. May I see your hand?

411
00:26:29,987 --> 00:26:32,704
You don't remember the hour
of your birth, by any chance?

412
00:26:32,865 --> 00:26:34,184
No.

413
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:38,862
Good fingers,
 strong, artistic.

414
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:42,142
What about the concert?

415
00:26:42,307 --> 00:26:45,777
These hands will 
bring you great fame.

416
00:26:50,227 --> 00:26:53,423
(Henry) Well, I consider myself
a very fortunate man today.

417
00:26:53,586 --> 00:26:55,894
- I'm on hand for the grand opening.
(Brandon) - Of what?

418
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:59,057
- Of your collection, so to speak.
- Oh yes, of course.

419
00:26:59,227 --> 00:27:01,787
(Atwater)
Are you going to play? How lovely.

420
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:04,743
(Janet) - Your wife sends her love.
(Henry) - David wasn't there ?

421
00:27:07,707 --> 00:27:10,346
No. He'll probably be here
in a minute, though.

422
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:28,541
- Your touch has improved, Phillip.
- Rupert!

423
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:31,699
I... I was beginning to think
you weren't going to show.

424
00:27:31,865 --> 00:27:33,823
You know me better than that.

425
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,740
Mrs Atwater,
may I present Mr Rupert Cadell.

426
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,134
- Delighted.
- Thank you.

427
00:27:38,307 --> 00:27:40,261
- Mr Kentley.
- How do you do, Mr Kentley?

428
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,541
Rupert Cadell,
the housemaster at Somerville?

429
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:45,663
- I used to be.
- You must have taught my son, David.

430
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:48,182
- You flatter me. How do you do?
- Hello, chum.

431
00:27:48,346 --> 00:27:50,415
- Oh, Miss Walker.
- How'd you know?

432
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,101
- Brandon spoke of you.
- Did he do me justice?

433
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:56,462
Do you deserve justice?
 Well!

434
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,298
Well, little Kenneth Lawrence,
how you've grown.

435
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:02,980
- Hello, er...
- Kenneth, school's out. You can say it.

436
00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:06,057
Rupert, you're the same as ever.
It's awfully good to see you again.

437
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,900
- Why?
- Uh, well...

438
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:12,218
Don't mind me.
Very pleased to see you again.

439
00:28:12,385 --> 00:28:15,220
And that bears a curious
resemblance to champagne.

440
00:28:15,385 --> 00:28:17,537
- It is.
- Very good champagne.

441
00:28:17,707 --> 00:28:20,267
- What's the occasion?
- I told you on the phone.

442
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:24,545
It began as a little party for Mr Kentley
so he could look over the first editions.

443
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:26,741
Then it turned out Phillip
and I were going to the country -

444
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,577
Yes, you told me that too,
 Brandon.

445
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:29,973
- Did l?
- Yeah.

446
00:28:30,145 --> 00:28:33,137
Well, I thought I'd make it
sort of a farewell for Phillip.

447
00:28:33,307 --> 00:28:35,136
- Therefore, champagne.
- Yes.

448
00:28:35,307 --> 00:28:38,183
- I see.
- Well, it's true.

449
00:28:38,346 --> 00:28:41,259
You always did stutter
when you were excited.

450
00:28:41,425 --> 00:28:44,098
Well, l-l guess I'm always excited
when I give a party.

451
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:45,778
- Really?
- Mr Cadell.

452
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:48,381
Oh, Mrs Wilson.

453
00:28:48,547 --> 00:28:50,820
Well,
 what have we here?

454
00:28:50,987 --> 00:28:52,739
(Whispering)
I got that special pâté you like.

455
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,738
(Whispering) - I don't like it anymore.
- Oh, no!

456
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:56,784
No, I'm just teasing,
 just teasing.

457
00:28:56,945 --> 00:29:00,257
- You're awful.
- Thank you. Thank you.

458
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:02,097
You'd better get along 
with the carving.

459
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:04,383
The rest of the things'll be here
in two shakes.

460
00:29:04,547 --> 00:29:06,538
Oh, Mr Brandon,
 I found it.

461
00:29:06,707 --> 00:29:09,221
I haven't the least notion
what it was she lost.

462
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:12,105
Wonderful Mrs Wilson.

463
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:14,383
I may marry her.

464
00:29:14,547 --> 00:29:16,980
It looks heavenly.
I hope David gets here soon.

465
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:19,615
- Yes, where is David?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

466
00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:22,017
But he's so late,
Mr Kentley's getting annoyed.

467
00:29:22,185 --> 00:29:25,222
- And you?
- Me? I'm hungry?

468
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:27,582
Brandon,
 exactly what is this?

469
00:29:27,747 --> 00:29:30,896
- A cassone I got in ltaly.
- No, I mean why are we eating off it?

470
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:34,262
Oh, I've turned
the dining room into a library.

471
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:36,497
Trust you to find a new use
for a chest.

472
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:40,625
One was always turning up in the
bedtime stories he told in prep school.

473
00:29:40,787 --> 00:29:45,178
"The Mistletoe Bough,"
that was your favourite tale, wasn't it?

474
00:29:45,346 --> 00:29:48,623
- What was that one about?
- I don't quite remember how it started.

475
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,221
- It was about a lovely, young girl -
- She was a bride-to-be.

476
00:29:51,385 --> 00:29:54,105
On her wedding day,
she playfully hid herself in a chest.

477
00:29:54,267 --> 00:29:57,223
- Yes, that's right.
- Unfortunately, it had a spring lock.

478
00:29:57,385 --> 00:29:59,740
Fifty years later,
they found her skeleton.

479
00:29:59,905 --> 00:30:03,104
- I don't think I'll get that playful.
- Would you all please help yourselves?

480
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:06,737
Talking of skeletons, have you seen
that new thing at the Strand?

481
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,135
- Yes, I adored it.
- Did you? Good.

482
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,377
I didn't like the new girl much.
Definitely Scorpio.

483
00:30:12,547 --> 00:30:15,298
No, I didn't like her either,
but her clothes were fabulous.

484
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:17,820
- Simply divine!
- Absolute heaven!

485
00:30:17,987 --> 00:30:21,500
- I must see it.
- I have a passion for James Mason.

486
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:23,737
- Is he good?
- Absolutely terrific.

487
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,422
So attractively sinister!
Taurus, the bull, you know.

488
00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:29,066
- Very obstinate.
- Really?

489
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,785
But I have a confession to make.

490
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:34,701
Do you know, I think I like Mason
as much as Errol Flynn?

491
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:38,382
- I'll take Cary Grant, myself.
- Oh, so will l.

492
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:41,698
Capricorn, the goat.
 He leaps, divine!

493
00:30:41,865 --> 00:30:43,617
- So much "oomph."
- Yes.

494
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:47,939
- Absolutely.
- He was thrilling with Bergman.

495
00:30:48,105 --> 00:30:51,258
What was it called?
"Something of the something."

496
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:55,020
No, that's the other one.
This was just plain "Something."

497
00:30:55,185 --> 00:30:57,221
You know, it was sort of,
 you know.

498
00:30:57,385 --> 00:30:58,786
It was right on the 
tip of my tongue.

499
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:02,336
Mine too. It was just plain
"Something" I'm sure. I adored it.

500
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:05,226
- And Bergman!
- She's the Virgo type!

501
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:09,016
- Like all these, you know.
- Oh, I think she's lovely.

502
00:31:09,185 --> 00:31:13,066
I once went to the movies.
I saw Mary Pickford.

503
00:31:13,227 --> 00:31:16,058
I was mad about her!
Didn't you love her?

504
00:31:16,227 --> 00:31:18,218
Well, the Virgo type,
 like all of these.

505
00:31:18,385 --> 00:31:21,345
- What did you see her in?
- I don't quite recall.

506
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:23,941
"The Something Something."

507
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:27,941
Or was it just plain "Something"?
Something rather like that.

508
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:30,665
I don't believe you ever went.

509
00:31:31,227 --> 00:31:36,778
If I were you, I'd go easy
on the pâté, dear - calories.

510
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:39,700
Phillip,
would you mind helping Mrs Atwater?

511
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:42,506
I'd be glad to. Sit down, Mrs Atwater.
I'll bring it to you.

512
00:31:42,665 --> 00:31:44,223
Thank you so much,
 dear boy.

513
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:47,058
I must apologise for David.
I can't think what's keeping him.

514
00:31:47,227 --> 00:31:49,261
He's only in town for the weekend
and David is very popular.

515
00:31:51,747 --> 00:31:55,660
- Here, let me help. White or dark?
- A little of both on this for Mrs Atwater.

516
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:58,660
- What about you?
- I don't eat it.

517
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:01,259
How queer! I never heard of anyone
who didn't eat chicken.

518
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:04,499
Did you, Brandon?
 Oh, you probably did.

519
00:32:04,665 --> 00:32:07,545
- Why don't you eat it, Phillip?
- I just don't.

520
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:08,776
There must be a reason.

521
00:32:08,945 --> 00:32:12,221
Freud says there's a reason
for everything, even me.

522
00:32:12,385 --> 00:32:14,582
There's no reason,
 Janet.

523
00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:17,020
As I remember,
you have a very funny reason.

524
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,461
- Doesn't he, Brandon?
- Yes.

525
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:21,617
- I knew there had to be one. What is it?
- It's nothing too much.

526
00:32:21,787 --> 00:32:24,299
(Rupert) - It's fascinating.
(Janet) - Come on, Brandon, please.

527
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:27,741
Well, it happened about
three years ago in Connecticut.

528
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:30,182
Mother has a place there,
 you know.

529
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:34,020
We were going to have chicken
so we walked over to the farm.

530
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,858
It was a lovely
Sunday morning in late Spring.

531
00:32:37,027 --> 00:32:39,858
Across the valley,
the church bells were ringing.

532
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:43,861
In the yard, Phillip was doing likewise
to the necks of two or three chickens.

533
00:32:44,027 --> 00:32:45,060
Oh, dear!

534
00:32:45,227 --> 00:32:47,900
It was a task he usually
performed very competently.

535
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:52,265
But on this particular morning, his touch
was, perhaps, a trifle too delicate.

536
00:32:52,425 --> 00:32:55,499
because one of the subjects
for our dinner table suddenly rebelled.

537
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:57,817
- Like Lazarus, he rose -
- That's a lie!

538
00:33:00,905 --> 00:33:02,499
(Phillip) That's not true.

539
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:04,623
I never strangled a chicken in my life!
(Brandon) - Now look here, Phillip -

540
00:33:04,787 --> 00:33:07,299
(Phillip) I never strangled a chicken,
and you know it.

541
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:10,980
(Janet Laughing) Forgive me,
but it just seemed very funny,

542
00:33:11,145 --> 00:33:14,457
you two being so intense
about an old, dead chicken.

543
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,585
(Brandon) Sorry.
We were ridiculous and very rude.

544
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:20,464
I apologise for both 
of us and the story.

545
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:22,616
Well!

546
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:26,539
- Is it all over?
- I'm afraid so, Rupert.

547
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:28,220
Oh,
 what a pity.

548
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:31,902
In a moment, you might have strangled
each other instead of a chicken.

549
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:35,662
(Atwater) - Mr Cadell, really.
- But a man's honour was at stake.

550
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:39,022
And personally, I think a chicken
is as good a reason for murder

551
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:42,179
as a blonde,
 a mattress full of dollar bills,

552
00:33:42,346 --> 00:33:46,384
or any of the customary,
unimaginative reasons.

553
00:33:46,547 --> 00:33:49,903
Now, you don't really approve
of murder, Rupert, if I may.

554
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:53,025
You may, and I do.
Think of the problems it would solve -

555
00:33:53,185 --> 00:33:58,020
unemployment, poverty,
standing in line for theatre tickets.

556
00:33:58,185 --> 00:34:00,701
I must say,
I've had a perfectly dreadful time

557
00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:03,903
getting tickets for that new musical,
what's it called?

558
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:07,025
- You know.
- "Something" with what's-her-name?

559
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:11,019
My dear Mrs Atwater,
careful application of the trigger finger

560
00:34:11,185 --> 00:34:14,144
and a pair of seats in the first row
is yours for the shooting.

561
00:34:14,306 --> 00:34:17,777
And have you had any difficulty getting
into our velvet rope restaurants?

562
00:34:17,945 --> 00:34:20,300
- Frightful!
- A very simple matter.

563
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:22,458
A flick of the knife,
 madam,

564
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:24,663
and if you'll kindly 
step this way -

565
00:34:24,827 --> 00:34:28,376
Oh, no, step over the 
head waiter's body.

566
00:34:28,547 --> 00:34:29,980
Thank you,
 and here's your table.

567
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:32,536
(Janet laughing)
Rupert, you're the end.

568
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:34,856
(Kenneth) There's a hotel clerk
I could cheerfully flick a knife at.

569
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:39,065
Oh, no, sorry. Knives may not
be used on hotel employees.

570
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:43,539
They are in the
"death by slow torture" category,

571
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:47,585
along with bird lovers,
small children and tap-dancers.

572
00:34:47,746 --> 00:34:51,056
Landlords, of course, are another matter.
You seeking an apartment?

573
00:34:51,226 --> 00:34:53,456
Call on our Miss Sash Weight

574
00:34:53,626 --> 00:34:55,538
of the blunt 
instrument department.

575
00:34:55,706 --> 00:34:58,141
What a divine idea!

576
00:34:58,306 --> 00:35:01,378
If it suits your purpose,
 merely...

577
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:05,215
- But we'd all be murdering each other.
- Oh no. Oh no.

578
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:09,824
After all, murder is,
 or should be, an art.

579
00:35:09,987 --> 00:35:13,103
Not one of the seven lively, perhaps,
but an art, nevertheless.

580
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:17,623
As such, the privilege of
committing it should be reserved

581
00:35:17,786 --> 00:35:21,097
for those few who
are really superior individuals.

582
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:24,782
And the victims - inferior beings
whose lives are unimportant anyway.

583
00:35:24,947 --> 00:35:26,061
(Rupert) Obviously.

584
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:28,297
Now mind you,
I don't hold with the extremists

585
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:31,186
who feel there should be open season
for murder all year round.

586
00:35:31,347 --> 00:35:34,817
No, personally,
 I would prefer to have...

587
00:35:34,987 --> 00:35:37,056
"Cut a Throat Week."

588
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:40,139
Or "Strangulation Day."

589
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:42,818
Probably a symptom
of approaching senility,

590
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:47,422
but I must confess I really don't
appreciate this morbid humour.

591
00:35:47,585 --> 00:35:50,976
- The humour was unintentional.
- You're not serious about these theories.

592
00:35:51,146 --> 00:35:53,023
(Brandon) - Of course he is.
- You're both pulling my leg.

593
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:54,585
No.
 Why do you think that?

594
00:35:54,746 --> 00:35:59,661
The notion that murder is an art
which superior beings should practice -

595
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:01,737
(Rupert) ln season!

596
00:36:01,907 --> 00:36:05,695
- Now I know you're not serious.
(Rupert) - I'm a very serious fellow.

597
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:08,777
Then may I ask who is to decide
if a human being is inferior,

598
00:36:08,947 --> 00:36:10,824
and is therefore
a suitable victim for murder?

599
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:15,742
- The privileged few who commit it.
- And just who might they be?

600
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:18,898
Oh, myself,
 Phillip...

601
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,463
possibly Rupert.

602
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:23,742
(Rupert) I'm sorry,
 Kenneth, you're out.

603
00:36:23,907 --> 00:36:26,181
- Gentlemen, I'm serious.
- And so are we, Mr Kentley.

604
00:36:26,347 --> 00:36:29,498
The few are those men of such
intellectual and cultural superiority

605
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:32,898
that they're above
the traditional moral concepts.

606
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:36,264
Good and evil, right and wrong were
invented for the ordinary average man,

607
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:37,860
the inferior man,
 because he needs them.

608
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:40,018
So you agree with Nietzsche
and his theory of the superman.

609
00:36:40,186 --> 00:36:41,905
- Yes, I do.
- So did Hitler.

610
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:43,978
Hitler was a paranoid savage.

611
00:36:44,146 --> 00:36:47,184
His supermen, all fascist supermen
were brainless murderers.

612
00:36:47,347 --> 00:36:48,746
I'd hang any who were left.

613
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:52,422
But then, you see,
I'd hang them first for being stupid.

614
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:56,023
I'd hang all incompetents and fools.
There are far too many in the world.

615
00:36:56,186 --> 00:37:00,623
Then hang me. I must be stupid, because
I don't know if you're serious or not.

616
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:03,175
In any case,
I'd rather not hear any more of your,

617
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:05,702
forgive me, contempt,
 for humanity,

618
00:37:05,867 --> 00:37:08,175
and for the standards of a world
that I believe is civilised.

619
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:09,460
- Civilised?
- Yes.

620
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:11,697
Perhaps what is called
"Civilisation" is hypocrisy.

621
00:37:11,867 --> 00:37:16,338
Well, I'm sure Rupert, fortunately,
has the intelligence and imagination -

622
00:37:16,507 --> 00:37:22,025
(Kentley) Please, Brandon,
we've had had just about enough.

623
00:37:22,186 --> 00:37:25,259
Phillip, where did you put those books
you set out for Mr Kentley?

624
00:37:25,427 --> 00:37:29,181
- I'd like to see them myself, if I may.
(Phillip) - They're in the dining room.

625
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,702
Mr Kentley, wouldn't you
like to see the books now?

626
00:37:31,867 --> 00:37:33,936
I apologise,
 sir.

627
00:37:34,106 --> 00:37:36,746
Again, I'm afraid
I let myself get carried away.

628
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:39,420
Oh, that's quite alright,
 my boy.

629
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:42,306
I think it's a good collection,
the first editions, I mean.

630
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:45,219
Yes, I'd like to see them.
May I use the telephone first?

631
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:48,219
I'd like to talk to my wife.
She may have some word of David.

632
00:37:48,387 --> 00:37:51,503
(Phillip) - Of course, it's this way.
(Atwater) - Oh, dear, oh, dear -

633
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:54,976
- Uh, Brandon?
- Yes.

634
00:37:55,146 --> 00:37:58,105
You were pushing your 
point rather hard.

635
00:37:58,266 --> 00:38:01,737
You aren't planning to do away with
a few inferiors, by any chance?

636
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:05,695
- I'm a creature of whim. Who knows?
- I see.

637
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,697
(Janet)
I think he's definitely Scorpio.

638
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:11,063
Uh, Mrs Atwater,
wouldn't you like to see the books?

639
00:38:11,226 --> 00:38:12,978
Oh,
 I'd love it.

640
00:38:13,146 --> 00:38:16,219
Do you know, when I was a girl,
I used to read quite a bit.

641
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:19,538
Oh, we all do strange things
in our childhood.

642
00:38:22,027 --> 00:38:25,860
Kenneth, why don't you switch on
the radio or play some records.

643
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:29,416
Atmospheric music 
goes a long way.

644
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:34,425
He is such a sly,
 little devil, isn't he?

645
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:37,623
(Record) Bringing us back together
with sweet music.

646
00:38:37,786 --> 00:38:40,744
Don't let it get you.
He's always doing something like this.

647
00:38:40,907 --> 00:38:42,976
- I'm going in the other room.
- To see the books?

648
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:45,342
No,
 to let Brandon see me.

649
00:38:45,507 --> 00:38:48,146
- Do you care what he thinks?
- I know what he thinks.

650
00:38:48,306 --> 00:38:52,186
He thinks I threw you over because
David has a bigger bank account.

651
00:38:52,347 --> 00:38:54,177
Then,
 why do you go?

652
00:38:54,347 --> 00:38:55,666
Because...

653
00:38:57,306 --> 00:38:59,297
Because I'm embarrassed
at being here with you.

654
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,344
Oh, Janet!

655
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:03,018
Never thought I could be,
 did you?

656
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:04,824
Honestly?

657
00:39:04,987 --> 00:39:06,385
No.

658
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:10,141
Well, I am and I 
don't like it one bit.

659
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,219
I should think you'd have the decency
to be embarrassed yourself.

660
00:39:13,387 --> 00:39:15,695
- Why?
- Well...

661
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:19,063
You threw me over,
 chum, remember?

662
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:23,139
My, wouldn't friend Brandon
love to know that?

663
00:39:24,306 --> 00:39:27,458
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm just thinking.

664
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:31,016
- What about?
- Female vanity.

665
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:35,577
Well, I'm also 
embarrassed because...

666
00:39:35,746 --> 00:39:37,065
Go on.

667
00:39:37,226 --> 00:39:39,181
Well, you and David
used to be such good friends.

668
00:39:39,347 --> 00:39:41,860
You're not now 
and it's my fault.

669
00:39:42,027 --> 00:39:44,335
- I'm such an idiot girl.
- No, you're not.

670
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,896
Then I'm certainly giving
a good imitation of one.

671
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:51,422
Why must I try and be so smart
with everyone but David?

672
00:39:51,585 --> 00:39:54,862
Don't you kid with David too?

673
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:58,463
I relax with David,
 thanks to you.

674
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:01,018
- To me?
- Yes.

675
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:05,702
That...
 That grim Sunday at Harvard,

676
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:08,335
when you called it quits,

677
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:11,067
David took me for a walk.

678
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:13,614
My chin was about an inch
from the ground.

679
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,505
I just couldn't be the gay girl.

680
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:20,454
I just relaxed and let 
everything pour out.

681
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:24,266
The real,
 real me stuff.

682
00:40:24,427 --> 00:40:28,306
Did you hear that phrase?
I hear myself saying things like that...

683
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,501
Oh,
 where's David?

684
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:32,864
You know,
 I'm not very smart.

685
00:40:34,027 --> 00:40:35,346
Why?

686
00:40:36,146 --> 00:40:38,945
I never realised you were...

687
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:43,226
(Sighs)
Brandon and his atmospheric music.

688
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:46,025
You are in love with David,
 aren't you?

689
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:47,505
Yes.

690
00:40:49,266 --> 00:40:51,382
- I don't get it.
- Get what?

691
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:53,422
Brandon made a crack 
when I got here.

692
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:56,545
He implied I'd have a chance with you
again because David's out of the running.

693
00:40:56,706 --> 00:41:00,097
Wait. You mean, before I got here
Brandon knew we had broken up?

694
00:41:00,266 --> 00:41:02,985
- He even knew about you and David.
- What?

695
00:41:03,146 --> 00:41:05,786
Kenneth, he pretended to be completely
ignorant when I told him. He said -

696
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:06,936
What's going on here?

697
00:41:07,106 --> 00:41:10,496
I don't know,
but I'm going to find out once and for all!

698
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:12,820
- Brandon?
- Yes?

699
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:14,864
- May I see you for a moment?
- Certainly.

700
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:17,985
Why can't he keep 
his hands off people?

701
00:41:18,146 --> 00:41:20,137
Well?

702
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:22,657
Just exactly what are you up to?

703
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:25,978
- Up to getting you a coffee, if you like.
- Let's dispense with the charm!

704
00:41:26,146 --> 00:41:27,465
I'd like to know 
why you had gall

705
00:41:27,626 --> 00:41:30,425
to tell Kenneth he wouldn't have to
worry much longer about David and me.

706
00:41:30,585 --> 00:41:32,338
I don't think that's 
precisely what I said.

707
00:41:32,507 --> 00:41:34,862
It's what you implied
and I want to know why.

708
00:41:35,027 --> 00:41:37,824
Some women are quite charming
when they're angry, Janet.

709
00:41:37,987 --> 00:41:39,260
Unfortunately,
 you're not.

710
00:41:39,427 --> 00:41:41,860
- Cut that out, Brandon.
- Well, chivalry rears its ugly head!

711
00:41:42,027 --> 00:41:44,541
- I don't believe David's coming.
- Wait and see.

712
00:41:44,706 --> 00:41:47,619
I don't have to. He's never this late.
He's never late at all.

713
00:41:47,786 --> 00:41:50,061
If something had come up,
he'd have phoned.

714
00:41:50,226 --> 00:41:53,025
I think you deliberately arranged it
so that he wouldn't come.

715
00:41:53,186 --> 00:41:54,414
How clever of me.

716
00:41:54,585 --> 00:41:57,420
I might have known you couldn't
just give a party for Mr Kentley.

717
00:41:57,585 --> 00:41:59,577
You'd have to add something
that appealed

718
00:41:59,746 --> 00:42:01,577
to your warped sense of humour.

719
00:42:01,746 --> 00:42:05,706
I hope you've enjoyed
yourself, Brandon. I haven't.

720
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:07,585
(Janet) He's really impossible.

721
00:42:07,746 --> 00:42:09,577
(Kenneth)
You shouldn't let him upset you.

722
00:42:09,746 --> 00:42:10,896
Something gone wrong,
 Brandon?

723
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:15,025
No, Janet has a talent
for being bothersome at times.

724
00:42:15,186 --> 00:42:18,623
However,
 I suppose I'd better...

725
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,541
Uh, what did you mean,
'something gone wrong'?

726
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:26,858
You always plan your parties so well,
it's odd to have anything go wrong.

727
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:29,666
She seems to be missing David.

728
00:42:30,626 --> 00:42:33,744
(Rupert) As a matter of fact,
I'm beginning to miss him myself.

729
00:42:33,907 --> 00:42:35,340
Aren't we all?

730
00:42:37,827 --> 00:42:42,025
- Two desserts, Mr Cadell?
- One for you and one for me, my love.

731
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:45,065
The others don't seem to be
in the mood for ice cream.

732
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:47,945
No, well, they could
all do with a little cooling off.

733
00:42:48,106 --> 00:42:52,224
My, it's a peculiar party,
not that that surprises me.

734
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:54,896
- Why not?
- I could have predicted it this morning.

735
00:42:55,067 --> 00:42:57,456
Both of them must have got up
out of the wrong side of the bed.

736
00:42:57,626 --> 00:42:59,106
They've been in a state all day!

737
00:42:59,266 --> 00:43:02,143
Mr Brandon says he's always
in a state when he gives a party.

738
00:43:02,306 --> 00:43:03,422
First time I've seen it.

739
00:43:03,585 --> 00:43:05,862
Usually, he lets me prepare
everything my own way.

740
00:43:06,027 --> 00:43:09,143
But, look at this,
the chicken's hardly been touched.

741
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:11,695
- What was so different today?
- What wasn't?

742
00:43:11,867 --> 00:43:15,335
Mr Brandon was in the maddest rush
for me to clean up and get the table set.

743
00:43:15,507 --> 00:43:17,543
And, oh,
 it looked so lovely!

744
00:43:17,706 --> 00:43:19,583
(Mrs Wilson) But when
I was whisking out to do shopping,

745
00:43:19,746 --> 00:43:23,103
he suddenly told me to take
the whole afternoon for it.

746
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:26,498
The whole afternoon,
after that mad rush in the morning.

747
00:43:26,666 --> 00:43:29,943
- Did he say why?
- No, just a whim, I suppose.

748
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:33,860
But when I came back, he and Mr Phillip
were going at it hammer and tongs.

749
00:43:34,027 --> 00:43:36,494
Oh. What about?

750
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:40,626
Now, Mr Cadell, even if I did know,
do you think I'd tell?

751
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:44,222
- Well, I hope so.
- Not me. I'm like the grave.

752
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:47,025
Look at this mess!
Just makes double the work.

753
00:43:47,186 --> 00:43:48,905
After I have this cleaned off,

754
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:52,422
I have to clear all those books off
the dining room table,

755
00:43:52,585 --> 00:43:54,623
bring them here,
put them back in the chest,

756
00:43:54,786 --> 00:43:56,697
which is where
they were in the first place.

757
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:00,496
- Why did you serve from here, anyway?
- It wasn't my idea.

758
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:04,898
I had everything laid out in the
dining room and it was just beautiful.

759
00:44:05,067 --> 00:44:07,945
(Whispering) On this thing,
it doesn't have... (Fade Out)

760
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:11,735
(Undiscernable)

761
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:24,054
Is she still harping on her table and
how awkward it is to serve from this?

762
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:26,297
It's much more convenient,
 you know.

763
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:29,106
Because this way, people don't have
to go all the way into the dining room

764
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,063
to get food and come
all the way back to eat it.

765
00:44:31,226 --> 00:44:34,458
Seems to me they've gone in there
now for their dessert and coffee.

766
00:44:34,626 --> 00:44:39,302
Mrs Wilson, please serve the guests.
Don't lecture them.

767
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:44,739
We did get up on the wrong side
of the bed, didn't we?

768
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:51,579
(Piano)

769
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:02,864
- I'm in quite an embarrassing position.
- How do you mean?

770
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:06,224
I seem to be the only one
having a good time.

771
00:45:06,387 --> 00:45:08,378
You and Mrs Atwater.

772
00:45:11,827 --> 00:45:13,818
What's going on,
 Phillip?

773
00:45:13,987 --> 00:45:16,547
Would you mind turning that off?

774
00:45:16,706 --> 00:45:20,177
- Sorry.
- I don't like the light in my eyes.

775
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:26,018
You know,
 Phillip,

776
00:45:26,585 --> 00:45:31,217
I get quite intrigued when people don't
answer questions and quite curious.

777
00:45:31,387 --> 00:45:34,617
- Did you ask me a question?
- Yes, Phillip, I asked you a question.

778
00:45:34,786 --> 00:45:38,257
(Sirens)

779
00:45:38,427 --> 00:45:41,338
Well,
 what was it?

780
00:45:41,507 --> 00:45:44,498
I asked you what 
is going on here.

781
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:49,422
- A party.
- Yes, but a rather peculiar party.

782
00:45:49,585 --> 00:45:51,224
What's it all about,
 Phillip?

783
00:45:51,387 --> 00:45:55,221
What's what all about? Stop playing
"Crime and Punishment", Rupert.

784
00:45:55,387 --> 00:45:56,739
If you want to know something
come out with it! Otherwise -

785
00:45:56,907 --> 00:45:59,262
Now, now,
 temper, temper.

786
00:45:59,427 --> 00:46:00,905
- Don't stop.
- I'd like a drink.

787
00:46:01,067 --> 00:46:04,059
Wait, I'll get it for you. Keep playing.
What would you like, Scotch?

788
00:46:04,226 --> 00:46:06,297
(Phillip) No,
 brandy.

789
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:08,458
(Piano Continues)

790
00:46:10,827 --> 00:46:14,739
You're very fond
of that little tune, aren't you?

791
00:46:14,987 --> 00:46:18,581
You know, I wish I could come
straight out with what I want to know.

792
00:46:18,746 --> 00:46:21,659
Unfortunately,
 I don't know anything.

793
00:46:21,827 --> 00:46:23,818
I merely suspect.

794
00:46:25,987 --> 00:46:28,342
- I said that -
(Phillip) - I heard you.

795
00:46:28,507 --> 00:46:31,817
- This alright?
(Phillip) - Thank you.

796
00:46:32,746 --> 00:46:34,737
(Guests Laughing)

797
00:46:37,827 --> 00:46:40,340
- Do you use this?
- Sometimes.

798
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:42,940
I thought only beginners did.

799
00:46:43,106 --> 00:46:46,143
- I must say -
- Alright, Rupert, I'll ask you.

800
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:48,614
What do you suspect?

801
00:46:49,387 --> 00:46:53,096
Oh, I'd forgotten.
 Where's David, Phillip?

802
00:46:53,266 --> 00:46:55,701
I don't know.
 Why?

803
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:57,141
- Brandon knows.
- Does he?

804
00:46:57,306 --> 00:46:58,422
- Doesn't he?
- Not that I know of.

805
00:46:58,585 --> 00:47:01,976
- Oh, come now.
- I don't. Why don't you ask Brandon?

806
00:47:02,146 --> 00:47:04,181
I have,

807
00:47:04,347 --> 00:47:08,625
but he's too busy manoeuvring
the other two points of the triangle.

808
00:47:08,786 --> 00:47:10,425
What for,
 Phillip?

809
00:47:10,585 --> 00:47:13,784
Just what is Brandon trying to do
with Janet and Kenneth?

810
00:47:13,947 --> 00:47:15,938
(Laughs)

811
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:19,346
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing.

812
00:47:19,507 --> 00:47:23,181
What is it?
What, am I so far off the track?

813
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:27,056
There's nothing going on at all,
 Rupert.

814
00:47:30,027 --> 00:47:31,699
You're, uh...

815
00:47:32,907 --> 00:47:35,978
more than usually allergic
to the truth tonight, Phillip.

816
00:47:36,146 --> 00:47:37,978
That's the second time
you haven't told it.

817
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,898
Thanks.
 When was the first?

818
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:43,503
When you said that you'd
never strangled a chicken.

819
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:44,893
You're confused.

820
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:48,139
Brandon dreamt that up
for the sake of a very unfunny joke.

821
00:47:48,306 --> 00:47:51,697
No, he didn't. No,
 he didn't, Phillip.

822
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:57,021
And if you'll think back carefully,
you'll realise that I know he didn't.

823
00:47:58,746 --> 00:48:03,059
About a year ago,
I was up at the farm. Remember?

824
00:48:03,226 --> 00:48:07,266
One morning
I saw you display your handiwork.

825
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:10,817
You're quite a good chicken strangler,
as I recall.

826
00:48:10,987 --> 00:48:14,023
Well, l... I just meant
that Brandon's story wasn't true.

827
00:48:14,186 --> 00:48:16,302
- I didn't mean I hadn't killed chickens.
- That's what you said.

828
00:48:16,467 --> 00:48:19,583
Well, I didn't think it was a suitable topic
of conversation while we were eating.

829
00:48:19,746 --> 00:48:21,498
- You could have said that.
- Alright, I didn't.

830
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:24,226
We're not eating now, Phillip.
What did you lie to me for?

831
00:48:24,387 --> 00:48:26,581
- Because I don't like to talk about -
- About what? Strangling -

832
00:48:26,746 --> 00:48:29,625
- I can't play with that thing!
(Brandon) - I want you to have them.

833
00:48:29,786 --> 00:48:31,936
(Kentley) - It's extremely generous
of you, Brandon. I don't -

834
00:48:32,106 --> 00:48:35,416
(Brandon) Please, I know you appreciate
first editions more than l, Mr Kentley.

835
00:48:35,585 --> 00:48:38,498
(Kentley) - It's very nice of you.
- What's wrong?

836
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:41,340
(Kentley) - You must come to dinner...
- What's wrong now, Phillip?

837
00:48:41,507 --> 00:48:43,143
Don't you want
Mr Kentley to have the books?

838
00:48:43,306 --> 00:48:47,346
- No. I don't care if he has them, I just -
- What? What?

839
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,021
I think it's a clumsy way
of tying them up, that's all.

840
00:48:50,186 --> 00:48:52,018
(Brandon) David's never had
trouble taking care of himself.

841
00:48:52,186 --> 00:48:53,905
(Mr Kentley)
I know but I cannot understand this.

842
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:56,945
Whenever he's been detained before,
he's telephoned us. Isn't that so, Janet?

843
00:48:57,106 --> 00:48:59,541
(Janet) Oh yes. He's always
been after me to be more punctual.

844
00:48:59,706 --> 00:49:00,856
(Kenneth) And well he might.

845
00:49:01,027 --> 00:49:04,940
You wouldn't know me these days.
I'm a new woman, punctual as a clock.

846
00:49:05,106 --> 00:49:07,018
(Atwater)
That's very unfeminine, my dear.

847
00:49:07,186 --> 00:49:09,576
(Kentley) Perhaps,
but I prefer manners to femininity.

848
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,737
(Atwater)
Oh Henry, you sound just like Daddy.

849
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,864
I remember once, when David
was still at home...(Fades Out)

850
00:49:15,027 --> 00:49:17,416
Take it easy,
 Phillip.

851
00:49:17,585 --> 00:49:19,817
- Rupert's onto something.
- He isn't. Now, let up.

852
00:49:19,987 --> 00:49:21,704
- I've got to have a drink.
- Enough.

853
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:24,141
Take your hand off my arm!

854
00:49:24,306 --> 00:49:28,697
Don't you ever again tell me
what to do and what not to do.

855
00:49:28,867 --> 00:49:31,744
- I don't like it, and I'm not going -
- Keep your voice down.

856
00:49:31,907 --> 00:49:35,181
I, uh,
 hope I didn't upset Phillip.

857
00:49:35,947 --> 00:49:38,983
Uh, no, he's more 
likely mixing his drinks.

858
00:49:40,106 --> 00:49:43,099
- You seem rather upset yourself.
- Do l?

859
00:49:43,266 --> 00:49:45,905
Yes, there's something upsetting
both of you a great deal.

860
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,818
- Something that -
(Wilson) - Excuse me, sir.

861
00:49:50,306 --> 00:49:52,867
There's a lady phoning
for either Mr Kentley or Mrs Atwater.

862
00:49:53,027 --> 00:49:56,224
- It must be Alice. I'll talk to her, Henry.
- (Kentley) Alright.

863
00:49:56,387 --> 00:49:58,139
Down the hall to your left,
 dear.

864
00:49:58,306 --> 00:49:59,820
- Thank you.
- The first bedroom.

865
00:49:59,987 --> 00:50:03,262
(Janet) Mr Kentley,
do you suppose David could be home?

866
00:50:03,427 --> 00:50:05,179
(Kentley) I don't know.
 I hope so.

867
00:50:05,347 --> 00:50:07,018
(Rupert) I hate 
to throw a damper,

868
00:50:07,186 --> 00:50:10,577
but if David was home, I think he'd
be calling instead of Mrs Kentley.

869
00:50:10,746 --> 00:50:12,817
- Wouldn't you say so, Brandon?
(Brandon) - I wouldn't know.

870
00:50:12,987 --> 00:50:15,978
(Rupert) The David I remember
was polite as well as punctual.

871
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,659
(Janet) He hasn't changed.

872
00:50:17,827 --> 00:50:21,422
(Rupert) Of course,
if he's not home, where could he be?

873
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:22,815
(Kenneth) Don't ask me.
 I don't know.

874
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:24,898
(Brandon)
He might be at any number of places.

875
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:28,456
(Rupert) - Such as?
(Brandon) - The club, or Bradley's party.

876
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:31,221
- Maybe he went down to Janet's.
(Rupert) - Why?

877
00:50:31,387 --> 00:50:32,820
(Brandon) Perhaps he decided
to pick her up, after all.

878
00:50:32,987 --> 00:50:35,420
(Janet) I phoned my place
after I spoke to Mrs Kentley.

879
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:38,385
(Kentley) - He wasn't there ?
(Janet) - No. I left a message in case.

880
00:50:38,547 --> 00:50:40,663
(Rupert) We might have a better chance
of finding out where he is now

881
00:50:40,827 --> 00:50:43,943
if we knew where he was this
afternoon. What do you think, Brandon?

882
00:50:44,106 --> 00:50:46,257
(Brandon) I haven't the least idea
where he was this afternoon.

883
00:50:46,427 --> 00:50:49,260
(Rupert) Don't you think It would help
if we found out where he was?

884
00:50:49,427 --> 00:50:50,701
(Brandon) I suppose so.

885
00:50:50,867 --> 00:50:53,061
(Kentley) I know he went to the club
this afternoon to play tennis.

886
00:50:53,226 --> 00:50:55,023
- I know he got there.
(Rupert) - Why?

887
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:58,735
(Kentley) Someone phoned with a
message that David would meet us here.

888
00:50:58,907 --> 00:51:01,626
(Rupert) - Do you know who?
(Kentley) - No.

889
00:51:01,786 --> 00:51:06,224
(Rupert) Obviously, David ran into
someone at the club and changed plans.

890
00:51:06,387 --> 00:51:08,342
You weren't there this afternoon,
were you, Kenneth?

891
00:51:08,507 --> 00:51:10,259
(Kenneth) No.
 I wish I had been.

892
00:51:10,427 --> 00:51:12,418
(Rupert) I don't suppose
you or Brandon were, Phillip ?

893
00:51:12,585 --> 00:51:13,576
(Phillip) No.

894
00:51:13,746 --> 00:51:16,056
(Brandon) Hardly, we had our hands
full getting ready for the party.

895
00:51:16,226 --> 00:51:18,217
(Rupert) Oh, there was a lot
to be done this afternoon?

896
00:51:18,387 --> 00:51:21,139
(Brandon) - You know.
(Rupert) - Yes, I see.

897
00:51:21,306 --> 00:51:24,378
You didn't speak to 
David at all today?

898
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:26,617
(Brandon) No.
 Why do you ask?

899
00:51:26,786 --> 00:51:29,902
(Rupert) I thought he might have have
called to say he'd be late or something.

900
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:30,704
(Brandon) He didn't.

901
00:51:30,867 --> 00:51:34,063
Neither Phillip nor I have talked to
David since we invited him to the party.

902
00:51:34,226 --> 00:51:36,501
(Kentley) - That's odd.
(Rupert) - What do you mean?

903
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:40,420
(Kentley) I thought I heard David on the
phone to Phillip yesterday morning.

904
00:51:40,585 --> 00:51:43,021
(Phillip) Yes, you did.
 I'd forgotten.

905
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:45,701
(Brandon) Oh? What were you talking
about? Did he call about the party?

906
00:51:45,867 --> 00:51:48,699
(Phillip) Yes, he wanted to make sure
about the time. That was all.

907
00:51:48,867 --> 00:51:51,061
Here,
 I'll help you with that.

908
00:51:51,226 --> 00:51:53,900
Oh, thank you,
 Mr Cadell.

909
00:51:54,067 --> 00:51:55,818
That's alright,
 Mrs Wilson.

910
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,501
You can put the books back
when you come to clean in the morning.

911
00:51:58,666 --> 00:52:00,577
I didn't have any idea
of coming in in the morning.

912
00:52:00,746 --> 00:52:04,262
I'm afraid you'll have to.
Just let the books go for now.

913
00:52:04,427 --> 00:52:06,179
Well, alright.

914
00:52:08,266 --> 00:52:12,657
Henry, Alice hasn't had a word
from David. She's frantic.

915
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:15,260
- I better talk to her.
- She hung up.

916
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:18,817
She began to cry so badly.
Oh, Henry, I'm worried.

917
00:52:18,987 --> 00:52:20,056
What did she say?

918
00:52:20,226 --> 00:52:24,219
She's called every place he might be,
not once, but several times.

919
00:52:24,387 --> 00:52:28,016
And now, Henry, she thinks
he may have had an accident.

920
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,826
- She wants you to call the police.
(Janet) - The police?

921
00:52:30,987 --> 00:52:34,820
(Kentley) Oh, no, Anita,
I don't think that's necessary.

922
00:52:34,987 --> 00:52:37,376
David's no longer a child.

923
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:40,902
I'm quite sure he's alright.
 I -

924
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:44,503
Brandon, I think I'd better go home.
My wife needs me.

925
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:48,295
- This isn't like David. He -
- No, of course, I understand.

926
00:52:48,467 --> 00:52:51,219
- May I go with you, Mr Kentley?
- Thank you, Janet.

927
00:52:51,387 --> 00:52:52,864
- I'll get your things.
- Thank you.

928
00:52:53,027 --> 00:52:57,543
- Oh, Mr Kentley, your books.
- Oh! Oh, yes.

929
00:52:57,706 --> 00:53:00,221
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

930
00:53:00,387 --> 00:53:02,581
Would you call me as soon
as you hear from David?

931
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:06,456
(Atwater) I'm sure the dear
boy will turn up somehow.

932
00:53:06,626 --> 00:53:08,422
- Janet?
- Yes?

933
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:12,215
This is hardly the time,
but I'm very glad we had that talk.

934
00:53:12,387 --> 00:53:15,184
So am l,
 and David will be too.

935
00:53:15,347 --> 00:53:16,541
Good.

936
00:53:16,706 --> 00:53:19,699
- Well -
- Kenneth, why don't you come with us?

937
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:22,539
- Oh, I don't -
- Please.

938
00:53:22,706 --> 00:53:24,777
- Thanks.
- This yours, Janet?

939
00:53:24,947 --> 00:53:28,735
Yes, I'll just carry it.
 Oh, thanks.

940
00:53:28,907 --> 00:53:31,023
- I'll get my hat.
- Oh, going with Janet?

941
00:53:31,186 --> 00:53:35,543
- Yes, we're all going together.
- What did I predict?

942
00:53:38,106 --> 00:53:41,893
(Brandon) Good night, Mr Kentley.
I hope Mrs Kentley feels better soon.

943
00:53:42,067 --> 00:53:43,420
(Kentley) Thank you.

944
00:53:43,585 --> 00:53:45,304
(Brandon) You will call me
the moment you hear from David?

945
00:53:45,467 --> 00:53:47,583
(Kentley)
I will. Say good night to Phillip for us.

946
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:50,704
(Brandon) Mrs Atwater,
thank you so much for coming.

947
00:53:50,867 --> 00:53:53,061
(Atwater)
Thank you for letting me come.

948
00:53:53,226 --> 00:53:55,739
I'm so sorry we 
have to leave. Bye.

949
00:53:55,907 --> 00:53:57,498
(Brandon) Good night.

950
00:53:57,666 --> 00:54:01,818
(Laughs) - Oh, that's not yours.
- Oh. Oh.

951
00:54:01,987 --> 00:54:03,340
(Kentley)
I'm very sorry we had to spoil it.

952
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:05,304
(Brandon) You couldn't possibly
spoil it, Mr Kentley.

953
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:07,775
(Kentley) I meant 
by leaving so early.

954
00:54:07,947 --> 00:54:11,335
Good night.
Be careful of those stairs, Anita.

955
00:54:11,507 --> 00:54:14,146
- Thank you, Mrs Wilson.
- Good night, Mr Cadell.

956
00:54:14,306 --> 00:54:17,583
- Oh, you going too?
- Yes, I must. Good night.

957
00:54:17,746 --> 00:54:18,815
Good night.

958
00:54:18,987 --> 00:54:23,139
(Rupert) May I help you
with those books, Mr Kentley?

959
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:49,297
Thank you for a lovely evening.
Good night. It's been charming.

960
00:54:49,467 --> 00:54:50,820
(Laughing)

961
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:55,025
Oh, Phillip, this party really
deserves to go down in history.

962
00:54:55,186 --> 00:54:58,543
Well, come on, it's over, and it
couldn't have gone more beautifully.

963
00:54:58,706 --> 00:55:00,981
Yes, it could,
 without Rupert.

964
00:55:01,146 --> 00:55:04,503
But he was brilliant. He helped me
say all I wanted to say to those idiots.

965
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:06,862
He gave the party
the very touch I predicted.

966
00:55:07,027 --> 00:55:08,585
The touch of what?

967
00:55:08,746 --> 00:55:12,501
Prying, snooping,
 or just plain pumping?

968
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:14,978
Do you know how busy
he was questioning me?

969
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:18,059
- About what?
- Oh, what difference.

970
00:55:18,226 --> 00:55:21,184
You were busy in there arranging
that other little touch of yours.

971
00:55:21,347 --> 00:55:24,304
- What touch?
- Tying up the books that way.

972
00:55:24,467 --> 00:55:26,742
Oh, I thought that was wonderful.
Didn't you like it?

973
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,295
No, Brandon,
 I didn't like it one bit.

974
00:55:29,467 --> 00:55:31,264
You'll ruin everything
with your neat little touches.

975
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:34,543
Be quiet.
 Mrs Wilson's still here.

976
00:55:35,706 --> 00:55:40,302
- Determined to get drunk, aren't you?
- I am drunk.

977
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:43,617
And just as childish as you were before
when you called me a liar.

978
00:55:43,786 --> 00:55:46,539
- You had no business telling that story.
- Why did you lie, anyway?

979
00:55:46,706 --> 00:55:47,981
I had to.

980
00:55:48,146 --> 00:55:50,056
Have you ever 
bothered for one minute

981
00:55:50,226 --> 00:55:52,023
to understand how
someone else might feel?

982
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:53,858
I'm not sentimental,
if that's what you mean.

983
00:55:54,027 --> 00:55:55,539
That's not what I mean,
but it doesn't matter.

984
00:55:55,706 --> 00:55:59,460
Nothing matters,
except that Mr Brandon liked the party.

985
00:55:59,626 --> 00:56:01,422
Mr Brandon gave the party.

986
00:56:01,585 --> 00:56:04,146
Mr Brandon had a 
delightful evening.

987
00:56:04,306 --> 00:56:07,025
Well,
 I had a rotten evening.

988
00:56:07,186 --> 00:56:09,655
Keep drinking
and you'll have a worse morning.

989
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:13,614
At least if I have a hangover,
it will be all mine.

990
00:56:15,746 --> 00:56:17,702
Y-You know, Phillip,
 I've been thinking.

991
00:56:17,867 --> 00:56:20,255
We deserve a real holiday
after it's all over.

992
00:56:20,427 --> 00:56:22,179
Where would you like to go?

993
00:56:22,347 --> 00:56:24,338
Of course, we should come back here
for a few days, first.

994
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:25,985
Otherwise,
 it might look -

995
00:56:26,146 --> 00:56:29,536
I've been praying I'd wake up
and find we hadn't done it yet.

996
00:56:29,706 --> 00:56:31,503
But why?

997
00:56:33,746 --> 00:56:37,534
I'm scared to death, Brandon.
I think we're going to get caught.

998
00:56:37,706 --> 00:56:41,063
Oh, there's not a chance.
Well, there was, but not any more.

999
00:56:41,226 --> 00:56:43,980
Why,
 we're pra - (Door Opening)

1000
00:56:44,146 --> 00:56:46,103
Uh. Is that you,
 Mrs Wilson?

1001
00:56:46,266 --> 00:56:49,498
Yes. I'll need a key to get in
and clean up in the morning.

1002
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:52,056
That is if you're still
driving up to the farm tonight.

1003
00:56:52,226 --> 00:56:54,820
- Oh, we're driving up, alright.
- Oh, that's good.

1004
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:57,706
You don't look too well,
either one of you. Oh, thanks.

1005
00:56:57,867 --> 00:56:59,664
Of course,
 I could do with a rest myself,

1006
00:56:59,827 --> 00:57:02,898
but I want both of you
to come back in tip-top shape.

1007
00:57:03,067 --> 00:57:05,534
- We will.
- Well, I'm off. Enjoy yourselves.

1008
00:57:05,706 --> 00:57:08,016
Don't forget to write.

1009
00:57:08,186 --> 00:57:11,384
And mind your P's and Q's.

1010
00:57:16,585 --> 00:57:17,905
Who are you calling?

1011
00:57:18,507 --> 00:57:20,224
Only the garage.

1012
00:57:21,186 --> 00:57:25,179
Hello? This is Mr Brandon Shaw.
Would you send my car around, please?

1013
00:57:25,347 --> 00:57:27,702
Yes, right away.
 Thank you.

1014
00:57:47,186 --> 00:57:50,623
We'd...
 better draw the curtains.

1015
00:57:53,626 --> 00:57:56,664
(Phone Ringing) Who's that?

1016
00:57:57,827 --> 00:58:00,420
- Brandon, who's that?
- Probably the garage man. Answer it.

1017
00:58:00,585 --> 00:58:02,179
There hasn't been time
for him to get here.

1018
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:04,541
Then maybe Mrs Wilson
forgot something. Answer it.

1019
00:58:04,706 --> 00:58:07,585
Brandon... Brandon,
couldn't we pretend we're not home?

1020
00:58:07,746 --> 00:58:10,625
With all these lights on?
Answer it, Phillip.

1021
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,378
(Phone Ringing)

1022
00:58:19,226 --> 00:58:21,217
(Ringing Continues)

1023
00:58:26,146 --> 00:58:28,137
Who is it?

1024
00:58:32,347 --> 00:58:34,860
- Brandon. Brandon, it's Rupert.
- What?

1025
00:58:35,027 --> 00:58:38,257
He wants to come up.
He says he left his cigarette case here.

1026
00:58:38,427 --> 00:58:42,260
- Well, let him come.
- You know he's lying! He's caught on.

1027
00:58:42,427 --> 00:58:44,860
- Shut up and get back to that phone.
- I won't.

1028
00:58:45,027 --> 00:58:47,018
- Get back to that phone.
- Brandon, I can't.

1029
00:58:47,186 --> 00:58:48,666
- You've got to.
- No! He knows -

1030
00:58:48,827 --> 00:58:50,818
Shut up!

1031
00:59:04,947 --> 00:59:07,938
Rupert?
 Come on up.

1032
00:59:09,467 --> 00:59:12,378
No, uh,
 course not.

1033
00:59:12,547 --> 00:59:14,742
He's just a little tight.

1034
00:59:16,706 --> 00:59:19,585
No, but we'll 
find it in no time.

1035
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,666
Right.

1036
00:59:31,266 --> 00:59:33,860
Phillip... Phillip,
 listen to me.

1037
00:59:34,027 --> 00:59:37,463
Rupert's on his way up now,
and you've got to pull yourself together.

1038
00:59:37,626 --> 00:59:39,458
Phillip,
 did you hear me?

1039
00:59:40,626 --> 00:59:42,617
Come on,
 have another drink if you must,

1040
00:59:42,786 --> 00:59:46,496
but get hold of yourself
and keep your mouth shut.

1041
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,818
It'll be over in five minutes.

1042
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:52,784
I don't know how much,
if anything, Rupert knows,

1043
00:59:52,947 --> 00:59:58,737
but I promise you he'll be out of here
in five minutes, one way or the other.

1044
00:59:58,907 --> 01:00:03,059
Phillip, for those five minutes,
you've got to pull yourself together.

1045
01:00:03,226 --> 01:00:05,980
- Brandon, Brandon -
- Now look.

1046
01:00:06,146 --> 01:00:10,663
I'm not going to get caught
because of you or anyone else.

1047
01:00:10,827 --> 01:00:13,625
No one is going to 
get in my way now.

1048
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:31,577
(Door Buzzer)

1049
01:00:38,585 --> 01:00:41,579
Brandon,
 it's not loaded, is it?

1050
01:00:45,146 --> 01:00:46,579
(Door Buzzer)

1051
01:00:48,266 --> 01:00:50,780
(Rupert) - Sorry to bother you, Brandon.
(Brandon) - It's no bother. Come in.

1052
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:55,099
I knew you were leaving tonight.
I didn't want to be left without my case.

1053
01:00:55,266 --> 01:00:56,585
- Hello, Phillip.
- Hello.

1054
01:00:56,746 --> 01:00:58,385
I didn't mean to 
alarm you before.

1055
01:00:58,547 --> 01:01:02,016
You didn't alarm him. I'm afraid
Phillip's a little antisocial tonight.

1056
01:01:02,186 --> 01:01:05,940
- Oh? I thought perhaps -
- Any idea where you left the case?

1057
01:01:06,106 --> 01:01:08,097
No. No,
 not at all.

1058
01:01:09,547 --> 01:01:11,697
Completely unlike me to forget it,
 isn't it?

1059
01:01:11,867 --> 01:01:15,940
I suppose a psychoanalyst would say
that I didn't really forget it at all.

1060
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:20,463
I unconsciously left it
because I wanted to come back.

1061
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,418
But, uh...

1062
01:01:24,186 --> 01:01:27,384
- Why should I want to come back?
- Yes, why?

1063
01:01:27,547 --> 01:01:30,141
For the pleasure of our company
or another drink.

1064
01:01:30,306 --> 01:01:32,217
That's a good idea.
May I have one for the road?

1065
01:01:32,387 --> 01:01:34,105
Of course.
 A short one?

1066
01:01:34,266 --> 01:01:36,496
No, I'd prefer a long one,
if you don't mind.

1067
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:39,226
Not at all.
Phillip, will you fix Rupert a drink?

1068
01:01:39,387 --> 01:01:43,619
Now let me see,
the last I remember having the case

1069
01:01:45,585 --> 01:01:47,577
was when I was there.

1070
01:01:49,547 --> 01:01:54,541
I was just going to open the chest
for Mrs Wilson, when you came over.

1071
01:01:54,907 --> 01:01:56,898
And then what?

1072
01:02:00,947 --> 01:02:02,938
I think l, uh -

1073
01:02:05,907 --> 01:02:08,340
Wonder where it could be.

1074
01:02:08,507 --> 01:02:11,385
Oh, well, here it is,
 right where I left it.

1075
01:02:11,547 --> 01:02:14,505
Gentlemen, I beg your pardon.
I'm very sorry.

1076
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:16,942
I, uh -

1077
01:02:17,106 --> 01:02:19,063
Well,
 may I have that drink anyway?

1078
01:02:19,226 --> 01:02:20,706
Of course.

1079
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:23,335
- You really don't mind?
- No. Why should we?

1080
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:25,463
- Well, you might be -
- What?

1081
01:02:25,626 --> 01:02:29,460
- Tired. You're sure it's alright?
- He said you could have it!

1082
01:02:29,626 --> 01:02:30,980
- Thank you.
- Don't mind Phillip.

1083
01:02:31,146 --> 01:02:35,777
- I'm afraid he's had a few too many.
- Well, why not? Why not?

1084
01:02:35,947 --> 01:02:38,938
After all,
 it was a party.

1085
01:02:41,907 --> 01:02:46,297
Well, it's very pleasant to sit here
with a good drink and good company.

1086
01:02:46,467 --> 01:02:48,458
I'm glad.

1087
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,786
- Please don't let me be in the way.
- Of what?

1088
01:02:53,947 --> 01:02:56,619
- I know you have things to do.
- What do you mean?

1089
01:02:56,786 --> 01:02:58,539
Packing,
 last-minute odds and ends.

1090
01:02:58,706 --> 01:03:00,617
You are driving
to Connecticut tonight, aren't you?

1091
01:03:00,786 --> 01:03:04,574
- Yes, but we're all packed.
- Oh, I see. All ready.

1092
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:09,257
All except one guest,
who must be gotten rid of.

1093
01:03:09,427 --> 01:03:11,657
Well, I'll be off as.
.. uh...

1094
01:03:11,827 --> 01:03:14,260
as soon as I finish my drink.

1095
01:03:15,266 --> 01:03:17,985
There's no need to hurry,
 Rupert.

1096
01:03:18,146 --> 01:03:21,503
Thank you.
I, uh... would like to stay a bit.

1097
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:25,056
Perhaps even see you off.

1098
01:03:26,027 --> 01:03:28,824
I always hate to leave a party,

1099
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:35,226
especially when the evening
has been unusually stimulating,

1100
01:03:35,387 --> 01:03:38,184
or strange,
 like this evening.

1101
01:03:38,786 --> 01:03:41,175
What do you mean,
 'strange'?

1102
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:45,146
Did I say 'strange,
' Brandon?

1103
01:03:45,306 --> 01:03:48,936
You often pick words for sound
rather than meaning.

1104
01:03:49,106 --> 01:03:52,655
I don't exactly 
know what I meant,

1105
01:03:52,827 --> 01:03:56,376
unless I was 
thinking about David.

1106
01:03:58,266 --> 01:04:01,942
- What was strange about David?
- His not showing up.

1107
01:04:02,106 --> 01:04:04,985
You don't think anything
really did happen to him, do you?

1108
01:04:05,146 --> 01:04:08,422
- What could have?
- He could have been run over or held up.

1109
01:04:08,585 --> 01:04:13,056
- In broad daylight?
- That's right, I'd forgotten.

1110
01:04:13,226 --> 01:04:17,219
Yes, it must have been broad
daylight when it happened.

1111
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:20,583
When, uh...
 what happened?

1112
01:04:22,746 --> 01:04:25,545
When whatever did 
happen to David.

1113
01:04:26,507 --> 01:04:28,498
Nothing,
 probably.

1114
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:36,094
Still...
 where is he?

1115
01:04:36,266 --> 01:04:39,259
- What's your theory?
- Mine?

1116
01:04:39,427 --> 01:04:41,224
I was considering
Janet's for the moment.

1117
01:04:41,387 --> 01:04:44,583
- Oh? I didn't know she had one.
- Yes, you do.

1118
01:04:44,746 --> 01:04:47,818
I couldn't help 
overhearing Janet.

1119
01:04:47,987 --> 01:04:51,536
She thinks you kidnapped David, or did
something to prevent him from coming.

1120
01:04:51,706 --> 01:04:55,494
I'm not interested in Janet's prattle,
but you always interest me, Rupert.

1121
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:58,739
Do you think l, uh..
. 'kidnapped' David?

1122
01:04:58,907 --> 01:05:01,978
It's the sort of mischief that would
have appealed to you in school,

1123
01:05:02,146 --> 01:05:05,139
for the experience,
the excitement, the danger.

1124
01:05:05,306 --> 01:05:10,141
But it would be slightly more difficult
to pull off now, though, don't you think?

1125
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,217
- Ah, you'd find a way.
- How?

1126
01:05:12,387 --> 01:05:14,775
I mean,
 suppose you were l.

1127
01:05:15,706 --> 01:05:18,300
How would you
get David out of the way?

1128
01:05:18,467 --> 01:05:20,059
You're much better
at this sort of thing than I am.

1129
01:05:20,226 --> 01:05:23,297
What would you do if you were l?

1130
01:05:25,867 --> 01:05:30,496
Well... if I wanted 
to get rid of David,

1131
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:34,978
I'd invite him for a drink
at the club or some quiet bar.

1132
01:05:35,146 --> 01:05:37,103
or better still,
 I'd invite him here.

1133
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,338
- Then no one would see us together.
- That's good. And no witnesses?

1134
01:05:40,507 --> 01:05:42,974
- Yes, that's right.
- Then what?

1135
01:05:45,706 --> 01:05:47,697
Well...

1136
01:05:50,067 --> 01:05:52,056
Well,
 let me see.

1137
01:05:53,626 --> 01:05:56,539
(Rupert)
At the right time, David would arrive.

1138
01:05:56,706 --> 01:05:59,221
I'd walk slowly
out of the room, into the hall.

1139
01:05:59,387 --> 01:06:03,664
I'd greet him, tell him how fine
he's looking and so forth,

1140
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:05,818
and, uh...
 take his hat.

1141
01:06:07,947 --> 01:06:10,302
Then I'd bring him in here,

1142
01:06:10,626 --> 01:06:13,664
make some small talk
to put him at his ease,

1143
01:06:13,827 --> 01:06:16,215
probably offer him a drink,

1144
01:06:18,146 --> 01:06:20,217
- and then he'd sit down.
(Brandon) - Yes?

1145
01:06:20,387 --> 01:06:24,619
(Rupert) I'd try to make it all
very pleasant, you understand?

1146
01:06:24,786 --> 01:06:28,018
Phillip would probably 
play the piano.

1147
01:06:28,507 --> 01:06:32,215
Now, as I recall,
 David was quite strong.

1148
01:06:32,387 --> 01:06:34,855
He'd have to be knocked out.

1149
01:06:35,027 --> 01:06:40,862
So I'd move quietly behind the chair
and hit him on the head with something.

1150
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:44,536
His body would fall 
forward on the floor.

1151
01:06:44,706 --> 01:06:47,664
(Brandon)
Then where would you put him?

1152
01:06:52,626 --> 01:06:55,505
(Rupert) Well,
 uh...

1153
01:06:57,387 --> 01:06:59,617
Well,
 let me see.

1154
01:07:02,306 --> 01:07:05,981
Well, I think I'd get Phillip
to help me carry him out of the room,

1155
01:07:06,146 --> 01:07:10,663
down the back stairs, and the
two of us would put him in the car.

1156
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:12,465
- You'd be seen.
(Rupert) - What?

1157
01:07:12,626 --> 01:07:15,664
Well, you said yourself
that if anything did happen,

1158
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:17,340
it must have happened 
in broad daylight.

1159
01:07:17,507 --> 01:07:19,143
Oh, that's right.
 I'd forgotten.

1160
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:22,105
I'd have to find someplace
to hide the body until dark.

1161
01:07:22,266 --> 01:07:25,099
Yes, you would,
 but where, Rupert?

1162
01:07:26,706 --> 01:07:28,697
Yes.

1163
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:32,458
Yes, where?

1164
01:07:35,387 --> 01:07:37,820
- Cat and mouse! Cat and mouse!
- Phillip!

1165
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:40,784
- Which is the cat and which the mouse?
- That's enough of that.

1166
01:07:40,947 --> 01:07:43,063
- Mind your own business.
- That's enough, Phillip!

1167
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,822
I told you before,
mind your own business!

1168
01:07:47,987 --> 01:07:51,376
It really isn't any of my business.
I'm not his keeper.

1169
01:07:53,746 --> 01:07:55,099
With him in this condition,
 though

1170
01:07:55,266 --> 01:07:58,498
there doesn't seem to be
much point in your staying, Rupert.

1171
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:00,099
That is...

1172
01:08:00,266 --> 01:08:04,385
unless you came back to find something
besides your cigarette case.

1173
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:07,697
You mean, for example,
to find if you really got rid of David?

1174
01:08:07,867 --> 01:08:11,097
- Yes, that's what I mean.
- Oh, you're as romantic as Janet.

1175
01:08:11,266 --> 01:08:14,338
I don't think for a moment
that you kidnapped David.

1176
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:19,661
I'll admit Janet put the notion in my head,
but I never would have mentioned it,

1177
01:08:19,827 --> 01:08:24,184
if it weren't that you seem to be carrying
fear of discovery in your pocket.

1178
01:08:24,346 --> 01:08:26,176
- What?
- That's a gun, isn't it?

1179
01:08:26,987 --> 01:08:28,625
(Laughing)

1180
01:08:28,787 --> 01:08:31,425
That teased my suspicions
more than anything else.

1181
01:08:31,586 --> 01:08:36,502
And to tell you the truth,
it really scares me a little.

1182
01:08:36,666 --> 01:08:41,421
I'm terribly sorry, Rupert.
I don't blame you, but... well, here.

1183
01:08:41,587 --> 01:08:43,782
You can relax.
I have to take it up to the country.

1184
01:08:43,947 --> 01:08:48,179
There have been several burglaries,
and mother's a bit on edge.

1185
01:08:48,345 --> 01:08:51,622
- Uh, finished, Phillip?
(Phillip) - Alright.

1186
01:08:51,787 --> 01:08:53,537
(Brandon) Did you hear
what Rupert said about the gun?

1187
01:08:53,707 --> 01:08:56,823
He thought..
. (Laughing)

1188
01:08:57,027 --> 01:09:00,814
It's odd the way one can pyramid
simple facts into wild fantasies, isn't it?

1189
01:09:00,987 --> 01:09:03,581
(Brandon) - We all do, don't we, Phillip ?
(Phillip) - Yeah.

1190
01:09:03,747 --> 01:09:07,706
(Brandon) Particularly after a few
drinks. How is yours, Rupert?

1191
01:09:07,867 --> 01:09:10,095
(Rupert) I think 
I'll be running along.

1192
01:09:10,265 --> 01:09:12,827
(Brandon) Phillip, you'll feel much
better once you get out in the open air.

1193
01:09:12,987 --> 01:09:16,341
I don't think there'll be much traffic
and we ought to make good time.

1194
01:09:16,506 --> 01:09:19,658
(Rupert) It's a lovely night
and you'll be driving up in good weather.

1195
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:24,742
I almost wish I were going with you.
It might be rather exciting.

1196
01:09:24,907 --> 01:09:27,421
Driving at night always is,

1197
01:09:27,587 --> 01:09:29,862
but driving with you 
and Phillip now...

1198
01:09:30,027 --> 01:09:34,020
might have an additional
element of, uh... suspense.

1199
01:09:35,587 --> 01:09:37,737
You were right,
 Phillip.

1200
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:40,341
Those books were tied clumsily.

1201
01:09:40,506 --> 01:09:42,975
- He's got it. He's got it!
- Phillip.

1202
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:45,216
He knows. He knows.
 He knows.

1203
01:09:45,386 --> 01:09:48,777
- Alright, easy. I'll take care of it.
- No, you won't.

1204
01:09:48,947 --> 01:09:53,225
I'd just as soon kill you
as kill him - Sooner.

1205
01:09:53,386 --> 01:09:55,854
This is what you wanted,
somebody else to know.

1206
01:09:56,027 --> 01:09:59,462
Somebody else to see how brilliant
you are, just like in school.

1207
01:09:59,627 --> 01:10:02,743
I told you he'd find out,
but you had to have him here.

1208
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,783
- Now we're done for!
- Shut up!

1209
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:07,939
You made me do it
and I hate both of you. I was -

1210
01:10:18,587 --> 01:10:19,734
(Gunshot)

1211
01:10:22,225 --> 01:10:26,935
- Stupid babbling drunk. I'm sorry, Rupert.
- It's alright.

1212
01:10:27,426 --> 01:10:30,737
It's alright. If you really want to kill,
you don't miss, not at that range.

1213
01:10:30,907 --> 01:10:32,545
Of course he didn't 
want to kill you.

1214
01:10:32,707 --> 01:10:36,015
He didn't know what he was doing, any
more than he knew what he was saying.

1215
01:10:36,185 --> 01:10:40,020
I didn't want anyone to know this but
he's becoming an alcoholic, Rupert -

1216
01:10:40,185 --> 01:10:42,747
Brandon,
will you step over there, please?

1217
01:10:42,907 --> 01:10:45,261
Phillip's drunk,
 Rupert.

1218
01:10:45,426 --> 01:10:48,337
Surely you don't take those
nightmare ideas of his seriously?

1219
01:10:48,506 --> 01:10:52,100
Brandon. Brandon,
 I'm tired.

1220
01:10:53,265 --> 01:10:56,542
And in a way,
 I'm frightened, too.

1221
01:10:56,707 --> 01:10:59,095
- But I don't want to fence anymore.
- What are you going to do?

1222
01:10:59,265 --> 01:11:03,738
I don't want to,
but I'm gonna look inside that chest.

1223
01:11:03,907 --> 01:11:05,738
- Are you crazy?
- I hope so.

1224
01:11:05,907 --> 01:11:09,536
- With all my heart I hope I'm crazy.
- This has nothing to do with you.

1225
01:11:09,707 --> 01:11:10,694
- I've got to.
- Don't.

1226
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:14,221
- I have to look inside that chest.
- Alright!

1227
01:11:14,386 --> 01:11:16,377
Go ahead and look.

1228
01:11:16,546 --> 01:11:19,140
I hope you like what you see.

1229
01:11:35,345 --> 01:11:37,337
Oh, no. No!

1230
01:11:37,987 --> 01:11:42,104
(Brandon) - Rupert -
- I couldn't believe it was true.

1231
01:11:43,067 --> 01:11:45,103
- Rupert, please -
- Please what?

1232
01:11:45,265 --> 01:11:47,622
Listen to me.
 Let me explain.

1233
01:11:47,787 --> 01:11:49,823
Explain?
Do you think you can explain that?

1234
01:11:49,987 --> 01:11:52,899
- Yes, to you, because you'll understand.
- Understand?

1235
01:11:53,067 --> 01:11:56,742
Rupert, remember the discussion
we had before with Mr Kentley?

1236
01:11:56,907 --> 01:12:01,219
Remember we said, 'the lives
of inferior beings are unimportant'?

1237
01:12:01,386 --> 01:12:04,743
Remember we said,
we've always said, you and l,

1238
01:12:04,907 --> 01:12:08,944
that moral concepts of good and evil
and right and wrong

1239
01:12:09,105 --> 01:12:11,256
don't hold for the 
intellectually superior.

1240
01:12:11,426 --> 01:12:14,020
- Remember, Rupert?
- Yes, I remember.

1241
01:12:14,185 --> 01:12:18,064
(Brandon) That's all we've done.
That's all Phillip and I have done.

1242
01:12:18,225 --> 01:12:21,185
He and I have lived
what you and I have talked.

1243
01:12:21,345 --> 01:12:25,943
I knew you'd understand, because,
don't you see, you have to.

1244
01:12:39,466 --> 01:12:41,822
Brandon -

1245
01:12:44,345 --> 01:12:47,783
Brandon,
 till this very moment,

1246
01:12:49,027 --> 01:12:50,538
this world and the people in it

1247
01:12:50,707 --> 01:12:54,618
have always been dark
and incomprehensible to me.

1248
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:58,301
I've tried to clear 
my way with logic

1249
01:12:58,466 --> 01:13:00,899
and superior intellect.

1250
01:13:01,067 --> 01:13:04,819
And you've thrown my own words
right back in my face, Brandon.

1251
01:13:04,987 --> 01:13:08,944
You were right, too. If nothing else,
a man should stand by his words.

1252
01:13:09,105 --> 01:13:13,942
But you've given my words
a meaning that I never dreamed of!

1253
01:13:14,105 --> 01:13:15,506
And you've tried to twist them

1254
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:19,783
into a cold, logical excuse
for your ugly murder!

1255
01:13:20,947 --> 01:13:24,301
Well, they never were that,
 Brandon,

1256
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,421
and you can't make them that.

1257
01:13:26,587 --> 01:13:30,055
There must have been something
deep inside you from the very start

1258
01:13:30,225 --> 01:13:33,297
that let you do this thing,

1259
01:13:33,466 --> 01:13:35,582
but there's always been
something deep inside me

1260
01:13:35,747 --> 01:13:38,055
that would never let me do it,

1261
01:13:38,225 --> 01:13:41,024
- and would never let me be a party to it.
- What do you mean?

1262
01:13:41,185 --> 01:13:45,145
I mean that tonight you've made me
ashamed of every concept I ever had

1263
01:13:45,305 --> 01:13:48,297
of superior or inferior beings.

1264
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:51,185
But I thank you for that shame,

1265
01:13:51,345 --> 01:13:56,578
because now I know that we are each
of us a separate human being, Brandon,

1266
01:13:56,747 --> 01:14:00,658
with the right to live and work
and think as individuals,

1267
01:14:00,827 --> 01:14:03,819
but with an obligation
to the society we live in.

1268
01:14:05,105 --> 01:14:07,096
By what right do you dare say

1269
01:14:07,265 --> 01:14:11,658
that there's a superior few
to which you belong?

1270
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:14,020
By what right did 
you dare decide

1271
01:14:14,185 --> 01:14:19,703
that that boy in there was inferior
and therefore could be killed?

1272
01:14:19,867 --> 01:14:22,381
Did you think you were God,
 Brandon?

1273
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:25,743
Is that what you thought
when you choked the life out of him?

1274
01:14:25,907 --> 01:14:29,136
Is that what you thought
when you served food from his grave?

1275
01:14:29,305 --> 01:14:32,854
I don't know what you thought,
but I know what you've done.

1276
01:14:33,027 --> 01:14:34,823
You've murdered!

1277
01:14:34,987 --> 01:14:37,581
You've strangled a 
fellow human being

1278
01:14:37,747 --> 01:14:41,216
who could live and love
as you never could.

1279
01:14:41,386 --> 01:14:43,024
- And never will again.
- What are you doing?

1280
01:14:43,185 --> 01:14:48,545
It's what society's going to do. I don't
know what that will be. I can guess.

1281
01:14:48,707 --> 01:14:52,698
And I can help. You're going to die,
Brandon, both of you!

1282
01:14:52,867 --> 01:14:55,506
You're going to die.

1284

(Woman 3) There 
were shots fired!

1285
01:15:29,587 --> 01:15:33,421
(Man 2) I think that
somebody better call the police.

1286
01:15:33,587 --> 01:15:36,863
(Man 3)
Did any of you hear any shots fired?

1287
01:15:38,587 --> 01:15:43,216
(Man 2) Somebody better call
a squad car. Can I use your phone?

1288
01:15:46,105 --> 01:15:51,738
(Man 2) I'm not going up to look.
There might be a mad man up there!
