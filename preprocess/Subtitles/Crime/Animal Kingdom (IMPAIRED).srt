Look, I know you got a problem,
Janine.

But I don't see how
this mess your boys are in

1260
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,078
has got anything to do with me.

1261
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:03,600
So if you've called me in here to see
if there's some strings I can pull,

1262
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,999

Hey, Randall, before you go on,

1265
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:16,600
this boy who's currently
being looked after -

1266
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,080
tell me if you agree with this -

1267
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:22,631
this boy who's being looked after,
he knows who you are.

1268
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,520
And you know how these things go.

1269
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,160
They're gonna ask him
all sorts of questions

1270
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,640
about everything
he's ever seen or done.

1271

Haven't you?

1275
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,200
I want this part to be clear.

1276
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,440
This is not about you
doing me a favour

1277
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:49,120
or...me blackmailing you,
anything like that.

for everyone.

Ezra's got the address.

1280
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,520
It shouldn't be too hard to set up
a raid on the house.

1281
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:02,240
There'd be reasonable grounds,
what with all the strange activity,

1282
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,040
the comings and goings day and night.

1283
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,554
One of the neighbours might've seen
a gun or something.

1284

This is your area of expertise.

1287
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:25,909
I really don't see how
anything can be done, Janine.

We do what we must.

Just because we don't
want to do something

1294
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,397
doesn't mean it can't be done.

Of course, dear.

1333
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,320
I want to set up a meeting with Ezra

OK. Of course.

Yes, you are, dear.

No, I知 not.

01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,200
I知 not safe in witness protection
either,

1347

You'll be safe at home, honey.

that I知 here to help.

I think J's made his position clear.

1354
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:55,840
Where that leaves us now
is to decide how best to proceed,

1355
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,513
given the brave offer
of assistance he's made.

1356
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:03,280
You know, this thing's going to trial
with or without J, that's a given.

1357
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,430
What we want is to win it.

1358
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,520
You know what I liked
about the committal hearing?

1359
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:13,400
Despite the fact that we've been
ordered to stand trial, of course.

1360
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:17,520
But what I liked about the committal
was that for the most part,

1361
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,880
their case looked
pretty flimsy to me.

1362
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,480
Largely dependent
on witness testimony

1363
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:24,720
that shouldn't be too hard to
discredit, I wouldn't have thought.

1364
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:27,920
And if the committal痴 any indicator,
then J here's their star witness.

1365
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,640
Without him, they'll need
to strengthen their brief,

1366
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,995
which they will do
with something else.

1367
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:38,320
Personally, I壇 rather tackle
the evidence I saw at the committal

1368
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,800
than any rejigged brief
they come up with

1369
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,200
should J suddenly decide to leave.

1370
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,800
You know what I mean?

1371
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,560
So I think we should
just get into it.

1372
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,755

we'll need to go through...

- Hiding.

1375
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,160
You shouldn't have left the house.
Where did you go?

1376
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,920
I was hiding.

1377
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:25,000
It was the Drug Squad
who raided the house today.

1378
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,760
OK? They'd been told
something funny was going on here.

1379
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,520
It was just a fuckin' mix-up.

1380
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,680
Now, you're not in any danger,
alright?

1381
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,160
I need you to understand that.

1382
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:35,160

- OK.

1383
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,040
Did anybody see you out there today?

1384
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,800
No.

1385
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,840
OK.

1386
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,960
You alright?

1387
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,791
I知 fine.

1388
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:05,788

with what's known as a 'hot shot'.

1407
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,520
Yes.

01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:01,114
- Did you see them do it?
- No.

1409
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,315
Was she known to you
to be a user of heroin?

1410
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,600
Sometimes, yeah.

1411
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,320
Was she? This is me talking now.

No.

Then say no. You don't need to lie.

1414

Was there any reason why
on this particular night

1415
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,560
she might have wanted to use heroin?

1416
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:21,993
Maybe.

1417
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,720
Why maybe?

1418
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:28,080
I broke up with her.

1419
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:31,231
- That night?
- Yeah.

1420

So to some extent you feel
responsible for Nicole's death.

I don't know, maybe to an extent.

But you want your uncles
put away for it,

even though you didn't see them do it

1424
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:48,200
and she was justifiably upset
on this night

1425
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,760
because you had ended
the relationship.

1426

You're looking for someone to blame

1427

for something
you feel responsible for.

1428

Would you agree with that?
Blah, blah, blah.

- You OK, sweetheart?

Yeah, I知 fine. Can you go grab us
a drink or something?
