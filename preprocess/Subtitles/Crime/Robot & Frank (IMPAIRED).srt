00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,968
I don't have
an off switch, Frank.

162
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,646
If you let go of me,
I'll do the dishes.

163
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,960
Go ahead.

164
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,650
Wake up, Frank.

165
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,247
It's 7:00, Frank.
Wake up.

166
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,486
Frank, it's crucial that we establish
a set schedule for your day

167
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,528
to help keep you oriented.

168
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,330
Frank, I've reviewed
your medical records.

169
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,121
Are you finding your episodes of
disorientation increasing in frequency?

170
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,043
What the hell are you?

171
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,524
I'm a robot, Frank.

172
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,921
Oh.

173
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,850
Oh, yeah.

174
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,080
How are you doing?

175
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,683
I'm fine, Frank.
(CLEARS THROAT)

176
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,921
Wake up.

177
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,651
Just bring me some cereal.

178
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,882
That cereal is full of
unhealthy ingredients.

179
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,440
I threw it away.
Don't throw away my stuff.

180
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,729
Frank, that cereal is for children.
Enjoy this grapefruit.

181
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,609
You're for children, stupid.

182
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,650
Today, we're going
to start a garden.

183
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,529
Oh, fuck this shit.

184
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,528
Frank, you need a project.

185
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,682
Mental stimulation
plus a regimented schedule

186
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,288
will vastly improve your cognitive functioning.
Besides, it's good exercise.

187
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,607
Frank, we're going to
have to work together.

188
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,489
You are a robot butler.

189
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,566
I'm not a butler, Frank.
I'm a health care aide

190
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,928
programmed to monitor and improve
your physical and mental health.

191
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,923
Yeah? Get out of my house.

192
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,085
If you're not going to cooperate with
me, I might as well not be here.

193
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,446
Fine with me.

194
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,205
If that's the way you feel,
I'll contact Hunter.

195
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,361
Good.

196
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,804
What are you doing?

197
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,280
Do you have a phone up there in that brain?
You calling him?

198
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,930
Look, you heard what he said.

199
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,128
He was trying to put
me into a nuthouse.

200
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,808
I don't recall
Hunter saying that.

201
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,405
There's nothing
wrong with my memory.

202
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,687
I'm fine, I'm telling you.
I'm fine.

203
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,764
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

204
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,161
My memory is fi...
What am I doing?

205
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,808
I'm talking to an appliance.

206
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,882
I suggest you work with me.

207
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,524
I'm not gardening.

208
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,608
Can't you do that super fast?

209
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,648
Some things take time, Frank.

210
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,643
FRANK: Shit, I hate hikes.
Goddamn bugs.

211
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,410
You see one tree,
you seen them all.

212
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,405
I just hate hikes.

213
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,042
While my programme's goal is to improve
your health, I'm able to adapt my methods.

214
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,283
Would you prefer another
form of moderate exercise?

215
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,285
I would rather die eating cheeseburgers
than live off of steamed cauliflower.

216
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,521
What about me, Frank?

217
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,290
What do you mean,
what about you?

218
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,522
If you die
eating cheeseburgers,

219
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,523
what do you think
happens to me?

220
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,045
I'll have failed.

221
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,522
They'll send me back to the
warehouse and wipe my memory.

222
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,486
If we're going to walk, we might
as well make it worthwhile.

223
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,199
Come on, keep up.

224
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,241
Stop.

225
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,131
If you come in there with me, I'm
going to have a heart attack and die.

226
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,964
But, Frank...
Just stay.

227
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,763
MR DARCY: <i>Can I help you
find anything, sir?</i>

228
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,444
Where is the librarian?

229
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,761
<i>I'm not familiar
with that title.</i>

230
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,161
(EXHALES) You're worse
than the other one. No.

231
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,527
Where is the librarian?

232
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,602
<i>Jennifer.
She's in her office.</i>

233
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,602
<i>Sir, you are not permitted
in the offices.</i>

234
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,889
Maybe we could create a little something
in honour of Dewey Decimal System.

235
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,610
Frank, you're not
allowed back here.

236
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,603
Hey, there, old-timer.
How are you doing?

237
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,761
How am I doing? I'm Frank.

238
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,085
This is Jake Finn.

239
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,561
He's been filling me in on the plans
for the new library. It's his project.

240
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,689
You must remember the days
when this library

241
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,410
was the only way
to learn about the world.

242
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,720
New library?

243
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,526
We talked about it the other day.
Remember?

244
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,649
I gotta slide. The movers are probably
taking a two-hour lunch break.

245
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,611
Jennifer, I'll be by Thursday to see
how it's coming along. Frank. Frank?

246
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,760
I'd love to talk to you some more about
your history with printed information.

247
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,606
You're our connection
to the past, buddy.

248
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,486
Who is that little shit?

249
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,289
BOY 1: My grandma
has one of these.

250
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,681
BOY 2: Yeah,
but this one's sweet.

251
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,131
I heard of these ones.

252
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,009
It's got advanced legs.

253
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,923
Warning. Do not molest me.

254
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,844
What are these assholes doing?

255
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,163
It's okay. The books are going,
but they're going to scan

256
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,289
whatever they don't already have
and then they'll recycle them.

257
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,886
It's like goddamn
Nazi Germany in here.

258
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,646
I know it's upsetting,
but it's okay.

259
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,441
Come on. Let me
show you something.

260
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,522
These will not be recycled.
These are the real deal.

261
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,489
Now, this is our
most valuable book.

262
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,441
Look at that.

263
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,601
Do you get to
keep these, at least?

264
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,205
(CHUCKLES) I wish.

265
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,523
No. They have to be
very carefully preserved.

266
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,366
And they're just too old to be handled any more.
It's really a shame.

267
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,965
It sounds like the same people
who stopped coming here

268
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,405
want to take away what's yours.

269
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,686
No, they're not
the ones that left.

270
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,491
They're just kids that think
books are cool again.

271
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,087
Mmm. That's a beautiful one.

272
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,531
Hey! Beat it,
you little bastards!

273
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,562
What's the matter, you can harass
old men, but you can't handle kids?

274
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,086
I told them to stop,
but they wouldn't listen.

275
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,561
The next time that happens,
just say,

276
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,927
"Self-destruct sequence
initialised."

277
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,401
And then start
counting down from 10.

278
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,888
Why would I do that, Frank?

279
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,369
Let's go to Harry's.

280
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,401
Have you smelled
our lavender heart soaps?

281
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,409
We should be going, Frank.

282
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,687
What a cute little
helper you have.

283
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,366
What is in your pocket?

284
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,445
I'm sorry, young lady.
I couldn't quite hear you.

285
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,922
What is in your pocket? I'm going
to make a citizen's arrest.

286
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,571
Nothing. Nothing's
in my pockets. Look.

287
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,766
Frank.

288
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,286
It's time we head home.

289
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,887
Yeah.

290
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,528
If you'll excuse us, ladies.

291
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,443
Nice to see you.

292
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,605
Have a good one.

293
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,208
Listen, you don't have
to argue with me.

294
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,328
I'm stuck with the damn thing.

295
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,607
Did you talk to your brother?

296
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,604
She doesn't like you.
I don't like you, either.

297
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,245
Yeah, yeah.

298
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,766
It is creepy.
He's cramping my style.

299
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,601
No. By all means, go ahead.
You let him have it.

300
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,086
Yeah. Bye.

301
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,971
Well, looks like maybe you're
going to be out of my hair soon.

302
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,283
Is your daughter politically
aligned against robot labour?

303
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,250
Hey, where did this come from?

304
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,210
From the store.

305
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,847
Remember?

306
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,730
Yeah, of course I remember, but
what did you do? Did you...

307
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,484
You put this in here?
You took this?

308
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,607
I saw you had it,

309
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,524
but the shopkeeper distracted
you and you forgot it.

310
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,204
I took it for you.

311
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,167
Did I do something
wrong, Frank?

312
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,286
Come on.

313
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,844
You know what stealing is?

314
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,922
The act of a person who steals.

315
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,526
Taking property without
permission or right.

316
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,045
Yeah, I guess.

317
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,881
You stole this.

318
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,648
How do you feel about that?

319
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,722
I don't have any
thoughts on that.

320
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,049
They didn't program you
about stealing,

321
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,202
shoplifting, robbery?

322
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,171
I have working definitions for those terms.
I don't understand.

323
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,605
Do you want something
for dessert?

324
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,401
Do you have any programming
that makes you obey the law?

325
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,121
Do you want me to incorporate state and
federal law directly into my programming?

326
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,487
No, you leave it as it is.

327
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,884
You're starting to grow on me.

328
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,121
Thank you, Frank.

329
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,486
It's time for your enema.

330
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,885
FRANK: Okay. Let's see
what you can do.

331
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,049
Any lock in the world
is just a little puzzle.

332
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,521
And the only key is the key.

333
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,843
No lock is perfect and
any lock can be picked.

334
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,729
All you need is...

335
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,881
(CLICKS)

336
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,166
...time.

337
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,124
Okay, your turn.

338
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,685
I think this hobby would be more
beneficial for you than me, Frank.

339
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,682
Teaching you is the hobby.

340
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,565
Okay, go.

341
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,685
You know, I did six years for one
stretch and then I did 10 for another.

342
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,889
I did know that, but Hunter
told me not to mention it.

343
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,329
According to your file, you were first
arrested for possessing stolen goods,

344
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,050
and then tax evasion.

345
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,806
That tax evasion rap was garbage.
I was a second-storey man.

346
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,961
What's that?

347
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,442
Finding away in
where no way in exists.

348
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,330
Like climbing up
to the second storey.

349
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,607
I specialised in jewellery.
Diamonds.

350
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,770
You want the most
value by the ounce

351
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,164
when you're rappelling down a 50-storey
casino in the middle of a hurricane.

352
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,529
And the women back then.

353
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,084
The most value by the ounce?

354
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,687
I always went high-end.
That way, nobody gets hurt.

355
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,489
Except for the insurance
company crooks.

356
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,647
(CLICKS)

357
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,206
(CHUCKLES)

358
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,641
That was your best time yet.

359
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,490
I'm getting the hang of it.

360
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,769
We're going to clean up.

361
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,603
I thought you said
the library was closed, Frank.

362
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,887
This is what
they call "casing."

363
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,045
To your right.

364
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,085
Oh, Frank, the library's
closed for renovations.

365
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,444
Oh. Well, we were
just taking a walk

366
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,249
and I thought we'd
stop by and say hello.

367
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,731
Hello.
Hi.

368
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,526
Is this your new robot?

369
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,731
Yes, it is.

370
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,844
Hey, there. I'm Jennifer.
What's your name?

371
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,326
I don't have a name.

372
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,731
Oh, Frank, you have to name it.

373
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,208
This is Mr Darcy.
He's my helper.

374
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,329
Avery reliable model.

375
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,126
Thank you.

376
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,410
I'm glad you're here,
Frank. All this change.

377
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,006
It doesn't feel like
home here any more.

378
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,689
What's the point of a library if
you can't check out the books?

379
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,809
It's all about
augmented reality stuff now.

380
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,164
Jake says it's about
the library experience.

381
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,971
When people can get any book,
anytime, any place, instantly,

382
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,206
this building
is about community now.

383
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,003
Community. Yeah, right.

384
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,401
Jake?

385
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,407
They're going to have this big
fundraiser party-thing on Friday

386
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,723
and all the young, hoity-toity
couples are going to come.

387
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,847
It sounds awful.

388
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,968
Yeah. Do you want
to come with me?

389
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,447
Yes.

390
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,367
Cool.

391
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,368
See that? A magnetic alarm that
trips when the door opens.

392
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,681
And there, a night-vision
security camera.

393
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,683
It's simple,
but it's effective.

394
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,731
Frank, you don't have any free
activity time scheduled after sunset.

395
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,367
What?

396
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,450
It's just one night.

397
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,000
And what's the point
of an arbitrary schedule?

398
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,051
The schedule is the most important part.
It helps you remain oriented.

399
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,849
Can we do it during the day?

400
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,526
No. The whole point is
not to be seen.

401
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,171
We have to be quiet.
It's got to be dark.

402
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,208
We gotta sneak in.

403
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,242
I don't know if I can sneak.

404
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,321
Hunter brought you here
to help me,

405
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,721
but I don't need
that kind of help.

406
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,001
You want to be partners?
Let's be partners.

407
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,289
You said yourself,
I need a project.

408
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,887
I do. I need something to keep me
stimulated, to keep me exercised.

409
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,450
Look, this is it.

410
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,605
Okay, Frank.

411
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,007
Okay.

412
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,524
(PHONE RINGING)

413
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,251
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Call from Hunter Weld.</i>

414
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,288
Oh, why is he calling?

415
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,566
<i>Call from Hunter Weld.</i>

416
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,244
Did you call him?

417
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,367
No.

418
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,769
<i>Call from Hunter Weld.</i>

419
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,406
Hello.

420
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,330
<i>Dad, call off
your dogs, all right?</i>

421
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,606
<i>I'm not changing my mind.</i>

422
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,523
What? What are you
talking about?

423
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,924
Dad, Madison won't stop calling me with
all these Human Movement talking points.

424
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,647
Deal with her yourself.

425
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,007
<i>What? No, no, no.
This is not going to work.</i>

426
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,447
<i>The robot is staying.
I can't keep coming up there.</i>

427
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,363
Nobody's asking you to.

428
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,090
<i>This is ridiculous.
A robot caretaker</i>

429
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,084
<i>is just as humane as a human caretaker.
'Cause they're more efficient...</i>

430
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,321
<i>Hunter, I don't care... it
doesn't make them inhumane.</i>

431
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,488
<i>All right, well, she said that you said
you were saying that the robot is...</i>

432
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,800
The robot's fine.

433
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,531
Just go do something
nice with your kids.

434
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,690
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

435
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,681
<i>Would you tell her to stop bugging me, please?
We're on vacation.</i>

436
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,205
<i>All right. Bye.
All right, bye.</i>

437
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,001
You're not telling Hunter anything
about the locks, are you?

438
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,567
Developing trust
is part of my programme.

439
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,610
I can keep anything that you feel
is important between just us.

440
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,921
Perfect.
Keep your mouth shut.

441
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,410
Not a word about
anything to anybody.

442
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,641
(CLICKS)

443
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,767
FRANK: Wait.

444
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,881
Eureka.

445
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,046
Wait here.

446
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,960
(sums)

447
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,409
This reminds me of a job
I did in South Florida.

448
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,407
It was probably a bad idea,
scaling that high-rise,

449
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,881
but I was involved with this
knockout redhead at the time.

450
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,361
I can't remember
her name. Okay.

451
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,087
Okay.

452
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,884
Let's see what we got here.

453
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,330
This kind of stuff
used to be solid gold to me.

454
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,322
I never got caught because I understood
building plans better than anybody else.

455
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,687
My family thought
I was a maintenance man.

456
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,561
It's open.

457
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,131
Which book do you want?

458
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,407
<i>Jane Eyre? Don Quixote?</i>

459
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,960
Take whatever's most valuable
by the ounce.

460
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,847
But I really was
a maintenance man.

461
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,285
Because I couldn't
spend the money.

462
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,931
I had two toolboxes, my work
tools and my other tools.

463
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,890
And I taught Hunter how to
fix just about anything.

464
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,084
We're supposed
to be quiet, Frank.

465
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,889
(CLEARS THROAT) What?

466
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,889
Why are you wearing
a space helmet?

467
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,883
Frank, we need to leave.

468
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,643
Yeah, I know. I know.

469
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,969
ROBOT: That was more dangerous
than you led me to believe, Frank.

470
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,166
FRANK: Oh...

471
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,120
Jennifer's just going
to love this.

472
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,328
Frank, it's time to go to bed.

473
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,966
You know what you are?
You're no fun.

474

You were crackerjack
at those locks, though.

475
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,050
I never could show Hunter
how to do that stuff.

476
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,007
I wanted to.
I wanted to.

477
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,010
But I never did.

478
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,768
He was a little hellraiser.

479
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,842
He burned a hole in the carpet.

480
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,329
Or was that Madison?

481
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,845
I read about it.

482
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,688
They used to send me letters.

483
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,962
Frank, it's very late.

484
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,405
Do you remember?

485
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,006
Was that you
or was that your sister?

486
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,970
I missed so much.

487
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,604
When I came home,

488
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,086
I thought you were
the neighbour's kid.

489
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,371
Why does that matter?

490
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,761
You know what? I don't even
mind this stuff any more.

Wait a minute.

what was he thinking,</i>

<i>just leaving you there
with this thing?</i>

502
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,520
Look, I told him that he comes
around to see me too much.

503
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,841
So...

Yeah, well, you know...

506
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,725
At least he did something.

510

I didn't mean it that way.

Are you okay?

518
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,482
Actually, I'm not supposed
to say anything,

519
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,961
but somebody broke into
the library last night.

520
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,644
It's funny you should say that.

521
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,327
It's almost as if they sensed our
vulnerability. It's horrible.

522
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,403
Jake thinks that maybe
they were trying to hack

523
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,006
into the new donor information.

Why don't you pretend that Mr
Darcy is a human being like me

539
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,402

It's so nice to meet you.

Why, I...
I love this old place.

You shouldn't be drinking those, Frank.
It's not good for gout.

560
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,570
I don't have goddamn gout.

561
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,688
You don't have gout. Yet.

Hey, Frank.
What?

00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,729
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

Is it about
printed information?

No. It's just...

No, I don't. Why?

come around here any more.

Excuse me.

575

Thank you.

576

So, that wasn't such a bad
party once you start drinking.

thing isn't just one big scam?

00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,127
What?

579
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,567
What if this guy, Jake,
isn't who he says he is?

580
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,883
Look at all these donations coming in.
These people are loaded.

581
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,884
And look at all the
gowns and the jewels.

582
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,368
That's a little far-fetched,
don't you think?

I'm sorry, Frank, but I can't agree
to let you risk another burglary.

Let's focus
on the garden instead.

593
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,441
Look, the library was strictly
a smash-and-grab job.

594
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,322
Smash and grab? You didn't
even give Jennifer the book.

595
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,125
I'll give it to her
some othertime.

596
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,884
Maybe I'll invite her over
for dinner or something.

597
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,010
Meanwhile, going after one of these rich
yuppies, it's a whole different story.

598

You can't predict that, Frank.

599
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,921
Isn't this something
you're supposed to encourage?

600
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,641
Without the library job,
I'd just be down in the dumps,

601
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,370
watching you dig up my lawn.

I don't want to
lose that again.

604
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,201
Maybe we can just do the casing
portion as a research project.

605
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,160
And if I've covered everything so
that it's basically zero risk?

606
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,447
You would have to be
very thorough, Frank.

607
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,490
I'm a strict judge.

608
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,641
Okay.

609
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,681
Okay.

What a maroon.

613
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,567
How come you didn't have anything
to say to that other robot?

614
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,802
I do what I'm programmed to do.

615
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,608
Were you programmed
to have this conversation

616
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,570
or to work in a garden
or to pick locks?

617
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,808
All of those things are in
service of my main programme.

618
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,042
What about when you said
that I had to eat healthy

619
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,487
because you didn't
want your memory erased?

620
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,803
I think there's something more
going on in that noggin of yours.

621
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,167
I only said that to coerce you.

622
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,766
You lied?

623
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,888
Your health supersedes
my other directives.

624
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,563
The truth is, I don't care if
my memory is erased or not.

625
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,286
But how can you not care
about something like that?

626
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,523
Think about it this way.
You know that you're alive.

627
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,886
You think, therefore you are.

628
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,486
No, that's philosophy.

629
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,609
In a similar way,
I know that I'm not alive.

630
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,761
I'm a robot.

631

00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,961
<i>Married three years.
The money's on her side.</i>

790
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,328
<i>She's a lawyer. He's a
consultant, whatever that means.</i>

791
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,091
<i>They own this house
and an apartment in the city.</i>

792
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,162
<i>They spend just about
half their time here.</i>

793
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,370
<i>When they're out here, they always leave
for some kind of event or vacation.</i>

794
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,329
<i>That's our When.</i>

795
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,164
<i>That brings us to What.</i>

796
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,720
<i>As in, "What are we stealing?"</i>

797
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:40,283
<i>She has at least two pieces
that have to be in that house.</i>

798
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,362
<i>But how to go in?
That's our next "W."</i>

799
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,050
Where. I found the plans
on their architect's site.

800
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,441
<i>I have our entry path
sketched out.</i>

801
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,010
I have 10 possible exits,

802
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,650
<i>20 different scenarios,</i>

803
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,485
alarm trip, dogs,
houseguests, et cetera.

804
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,361
<i>It's all set.</i>

805
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,090
ROBOT:<i> But what about the How?</i>

806
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,845
A home like this will have
an advanced security system.

807
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,244
Aren't you just adorable? This is
where my years of experience come in.

808
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,610
<i>Every security system is designed
by security companies, not thieves.</i>

809
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,366
<i>It's not a question of if a thief
can break in, it's how long.</i>

810
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,371
<i>They place
all the heavy systems</i>

811
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,204
<i>where their customers
can see them.</i>

812
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,886
<i>They're selling
the feel of security.</i>

813
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,124
<i>It's never hard to find a spot that
they assumed no one could reach.</i>

814
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,603
<i>It just takes the right eye.</i>

815
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,604
ROBOT:<i> And have you found
that way in, Frank?</i>

816
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,444
FRANK:<i> You bet I have.</i>

817
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,362
<i>There's no alarm here.
Just a flimsy little lock.</i>

818
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,289
<i>They're asking for it.</i>

819
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,490
<i>That brings us to the safe.</i>

820
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,643
I'll bet you a steak dinner,
we'll find it right here.

821
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,245
Do you know
the correct combination?

822
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,810
That's where you come in.

823
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,166
Me?

824
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,884
<i>You're going
to brute-force it.</i>

825
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,371
ROBOT:<i> Brute force?</i>

826
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,249
<i>That sounds like it might
attract attention.</i>

827
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,084
<i>All it means is,
you're going to try</i>

828
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,128
<i>every combination
until you get it right.</i>

829
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,771
That would take
a human like me weeks.

830
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,046
How long would it take you?

831
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,202
Assuming it's
a three-number combination,

832
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,408
somewhere between four seconds

833
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,882
and one hour and 43 minutes.

834
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,565
FRANK:<i> It's perfection.</i>

835
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,768
<i>We know there's something
worth stealing.</i>

836
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,561
<i>We know when to go in, how to
get in, and how to get out.</i>

837
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,291
It would be a crime
not to do it.

838
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,605
So, how about it?

839
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,205
You have been thorough, Frank.

840
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,046
It is unlikely we'd be seen and
even less likely we'd be caught.

841
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,963
But although your
memory has improved,

842
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,371
you still have
a long way to go.

843
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,681
I'm fine.
I can handle this.

844
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,841
Are you in?

845
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,922
Only if you agree to eat a
low-sodium diet from now on.

846
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,163
Okay.
Okay.

847
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,405
What? What is it?
I'm trash to you?

848
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,283
You're acting like a baby.

849
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,250
Am I a bad baby?

850
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,245
FRANK: Oh, shit.

851
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,886
Is something wrong?

852
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,089
What are these people doing
with this kind of stuff?

853
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,241
I don't understand.

854
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,883
Oh, this is way too hot.

855
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,961
Look at that.

856
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,647
We're just going to have
to sit on this, that's all.

857
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,246
We're just going
to have to sit on it.

858
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,804
It'll be fine. Yeah.

859
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,642
I made yours virgin, Frank.

860
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,961
Come on, buddy, I got troubles.

861
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,281
I need a little booze
to help unwind myself.

862
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,488
It's not good
for your blood pressure.

863
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,210
You worry too much.

864
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,684
What are you smiling at?
You two are funny.

865
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,046
Ahem. Cheers, Daddy.

866
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,281
Cheers.

867
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,722
Also, Frank, there's
someone here to see you.

868
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,600
What? Just tell them
I'm not taking visitors.

869
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,886
MAN: Hello?

870
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,364
Hey, there. Hello, Frank.
This is Sheriff Rowlings.

871
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,686
How do you do?
How do you do?

872
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,364
This is my daughter, Madison.

873
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,441
Hello.

874
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,488
And your name again, was what?

875
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,289
You remember me.

876
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,771
I don't buy your whole act.

877
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,649
Excuse me? Who are you?

878
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,645
What is this about?

879
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:23,406
Are you aware that your neighbour up the
lane here was recently burglarized?

880
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,811
No. What neighbour?

881
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,927
ROWLINGS: Jake and his wife.

882
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,367
Yeah, real professional job.

883
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,966
Frank, computer brought your name up.
Frank Weld, right?

884
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,121
Guilty as charged.

885
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,361
I think I read about
you at the academy.

886
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,930
Come on, that is ridiculous.

887
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,049
The police have been hassling
him for his entire life

888
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,168
about a few mistakes
he made when he was a kid.

889
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,083
Ma'am, you misunderstand me.

890
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,970
The computer thinks Frank's
a suspect, of course.

891
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,246
I don't mean any disrespect.

892
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,164
I can't see him pulling a job
like this off at his age. Sorry.

893
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,322
JAKE: What?
What are you talking about?

894
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,731
He did it.
He obviously did it.

895
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,320
Jake, why don't you
go wait in the car?

896
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,920
I'm amazed that all these yuppies moving
in here just don't get hit more often.

897
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,607
I know, right? Listen, I
could really use your help.

898
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,762
As a consultant or something.

899
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,921
Be on the right side this time.

900
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,968
Are you kidding me?
Arrest him!

901
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,485
Okay. You know what?
Back off.

902
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,925
Calm down.
Jake, stop it.

903
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,047
MADISON: What?

904
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,600
Everything's fine, okay? No one's
accusing anyone of anything.

905
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,091
We're all friends here.

906
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,800
What do you say, Frank?

907
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,130
My robot will be happy
to see you to the door.

908
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,450
All right, all right.
It's okay, I know the way.

909
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,000
I had to ask.
You guys have a good day.

910
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,008
I know you were
in my library, Frank.

911
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,491
I know you were in my house.

912
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,891
Jake, come on.
I know.

913
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,086
ROWLINGS: Jake.

914
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,006
JAKE: I got a lot
of pull in this town.

915
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,805
Maybe I should stay
a few more days

916
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,689
and make sure
they don't bother you.

917
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,364
No. No, honey.

918
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,249
It's going to be fine.

919
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,447
Bye.

920
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,327
You knock them dead
in Turkmenistan.

921
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,686
(MADISON CHUCKLES)

922
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,611
Oh, you know what?
I got something for you.

923
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,524
A little surprise.
I hope you like them.

924
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,489
Are those from
the crazy man's house?

925
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,246
No. No.

926
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,728
These are from the old days.

927
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,363
I want to donate them
to your cause.

928
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,442
You keep them out of sight and then
you can pawn them someplace far away.

929
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,124
I know the drill.

930
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,926
Would you call Hunter, please?

931
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,680
I know he's a pain in the ass,

932
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,324
but he's just
worried about you.

933
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,084
I don't want to...
Call him.

934
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,684
You can tell him I said he
was right about the robot.

935
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,331
Bye, Robot.

936
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,131
Goodbye, Madison.

937
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,327
Are you sure you're
going to be all right?

938
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,528
Yeah. I think I am, actually.

939
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,360
(MOUTHING)

940
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,047
We better get back
in the house.

941
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,531
Did you notice that van before?

942
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,841
I first noticed it
at 3:04 a.m.

943
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,446
That son of a bitch,
Jake, isn't kidding.

944
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,010
Maybe you should call Hunter.

945
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,242
You don't seem to be reacting
well to Madison leaving.

946
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,051
Wait. Did you let those two
bastards through this house?

947
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,167
Yes.

948
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,924
(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)

949
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:38,082
(WHISPERING) We got to get
rid of all the evidence now.

950
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,529
What about these, Frank?

951
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,726
Frank, there's another
piece of evidence.

952
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,486
My memory can be used against you.
You must reformat me.

953
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,803
Yeah, okay. Hold on.
Just hold on with that.

954
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,201
Let me alone.
Let me alone for now.

955
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,291
Frank, I'm concerned. I may have
to sedate you for your safety.

956
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,886
Back off, you little
astronaut bastard.

957
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,006
Back off.

958
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,165
Ow! Shit!

959
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,842
They're watching the house.

960
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,604
Any excuse to scan.

961
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,927
I think I should call Hunter.
You're behaving erratically.

962
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,684
What do you want
to call a hunter for?

963
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,569
Hunter, your son.

964
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,121
Oh.

965
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,051
Oh, yeah, Hunter.
No, he's sick of me.

966
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,328
Frank, you're not well.

967
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,967
No, I'm not. I'm dying.

968
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,005
What do you mean, you're dying?

969
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,447
Call Hunter.
Tell him I'm dying.

970
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,204
I don't think
you are dying, Frank.

971
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,045
No, it's just an exaggeration.
It'll get him up here.

972
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,090
I'm not going to be very
healthy in prison, am I?

973
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,442
<i>Hi, it's Madison. Why are you
leaving me a voice-mail?</i>

974
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,242
Madison, it's Hunter. Did Dad's
robot leave you a message?

975
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,882
Call me back when you get this.

976
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,406
Thank you.

977
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,887
Dad.

978
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,044
Hey.
Sorry.

979
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,244
How are you feeling?

980
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,728
I don't even feel like I have
the strength to stand up.

981
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,927
Listen, I was talking to the robot and I...
What are you doing?

982
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,240
I think we should
get you to a hospital.

983
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,890
No, no, no,
I want to stay here.

984
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,681
The robot's really more than
enough to look after me.

985
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,003
Okay. Well, I don't know.
I still think we should go.

986

(CLEARS THROAT)

987
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,448
I want to say something to you.

988
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,364
And I'm not good at this.

989
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,488
I was a lousy father.

990
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,041
Jesus, Dad.

991
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,124
I just want to tell you
that I knew.

992
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,051
All the time.

993
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,248
I knew I wasn't around a lot.

994
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,530
I hope you forgive me for that.

995
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,930
And I know it's a lot
to ask of you.

996
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,970
You come up here every week,
drive all the way up to see me.

997
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,361
I want to thank you
for that, too.

998
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,567
Do you remember what it was
like before, when I was little?

999
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,209
Yeah, sure. Sure.

1000
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,245
I hope you do.

1001
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:42,531
Remember when we had that little
apartment with that tiny backyard?

1002
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,285
You know, I...

1003
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,881
I think about that a lot.

1004
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,444
Yeah, so do I. Look, I want you to
do something for me, would you?

1005
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,367
I want you to put this
where nobody can find it.

1006
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,963
What? Oh, God, Dad, what?
Why? What's in it?

1007
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,168
No, don't ask me what's in it.

1008
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,284
I don't want you
to take the heat for this.

1009
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,203
And don't look inside it, okay?

1010
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,521
You promise me that.
Just hide it someplace for me.

1011
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,601
You want me to hide it?

1012
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,284
Yeah, I want to...

1013
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,407
I want to go out clean, Hunter.

1014
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,881
I just want to
go out clean, please.

1015
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,807
Okay.

1016
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,244
Okay. Don't worry about it.

1017
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,004
Do it now, please.

1018
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,367
What? Yeah. It'll
make me feel better.

1019
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,047
You want me
to hide it right now?

1020
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,360
Yeah.

1021
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,645
Just put it
someplace safe, okay?

1022
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,885
You want me to hide this
right this minute?

1023
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,086
(COUGHS)

1024
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,650
Oh, Jesus.
Sorry.

1025
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,245
No, it's okay.

1026
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,924
You better go now.

1027
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,284
Get out of the car, please, sir!
What?

1028
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,204
Put your hands out of the car, please.
These guys are new.

1029
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,281
Come on.

1030
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,161
Step out of the car,
please. Slowly.

1031
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,521
Thank you.

1032
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,565
What's going on?

1033
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,130
What's in the trunk?

1034
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,361
Yeah, what's in the trunk?

1035
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,521
Nothing. Golf clubs.

1036
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,011
Uh, a bag.

1037
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,050
Yeah, what's in the bag?
Dad!

1038
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,125
I don't know what's in that bag.
I found it.

1039
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,606
Beautiful.

1040
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,207
It's just beautiful.

1041
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,127
It's inside. They're inside.

1042
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,202
All right, Jake.
This is evidence.

1043
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,327
What the hell's going on?

1044
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,131
I want to search the house. Come
on, this is probable cause.

1045
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,247
Fine. Okay, fine.

1046
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,290
Okay, wait. Hold on. Wait a second.
Probable cause for what?

1047
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,489
Frank Weld is a suspect in a multi-million
dollar robbery up the road.

1048
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,961
What? That's impossible.
He's sick.

1049
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,806
He's sick.

1050
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,971
Good morning.

1051
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,368
Would you like to come in?

1052
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,401
(CRACKLING)

1053
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,850
Dad, why aren't you in bed?
What's going on?

1054
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,884
I'm just cooperating
with the cops.

1055
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,485
They always seem to
come and pester me

1056
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,289
whenever anything
remotely criminal happens.

1057
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,886
Yeah, but how are you feeling?

1058
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:04,770
I'm fine. I'm just not
getting enough sleep.

1059
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:08,130
I'm sorry, but thanks
for coming up to see me.

1060
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,126
Okay, wait, wait.

1061
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,248
Hey, any of you boys hungry?

1062
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,206
Wait a minute.
Where's his stupid robot?

1063
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,361
Who would like a selection
of fine cheeses?

1064
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,328
Nothing. You have got
to be kidding me.

1065
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,765
We have probable cause, okay?

1066
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,046
Not you.

1067
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,727
You're "dying"?

1068
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,001
You're playing games
about dying?

1069
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,889
I called Mom.
I called Madison.

1070
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,209
And what the hell are you?
You're lying for him?

1071
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,480
All right, everybody
get the hell out.

1072
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,450
We're not going anywhere until
we find what we're looking for.

1073
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,320
Hunter, don't worry.
There's nothing to find.

1074
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,165
Do you think I care? If there was anything
in that bag, I would turn you in myself.

1075
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,040
You're an egotistical prick,
you know that? I don't care.

1076
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:06,682
I just feel guilty because
at least I have feelings.

1077
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,603
The best thing you ever did
was being locked up

1078
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,120
so I didn't have
to be raised by you.

1079
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,042
Why do you think I left
you with a goddamn robot?

1080
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,925
Leave him out of it!

1081
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,968
Warning. Do not molest me.

1082
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,042
Dad, he's not your friend.

1083
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,122
He's a slave who, apparently,

1084
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,885
you can manipulate into
doing just about anything.

1085
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,891
Wait a minute. Wait a
minute, wait a minute.

1086
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,802
We should download
this thing's memory.

1087
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,887
Yeah.

1088
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,486
No, no.

1089
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,604
Just hold on there, now.

1090
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,604
You can't do that.
Frank, sit down.

1091
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,608
Warning. Do not molest me.

1092
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,761
ROWLINGS: You know
what you're doing?

1093
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,604
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

1094
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,681

1101
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,324
Frank, stay there!
Don't move!

1102
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,447
Six.

1103
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,249
He's lying.
Five.

1104
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,402
There's no bomb.
Four.

1105
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,681
Three.

1106
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,807
Goddamn it!
Come on, come on.

1107
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,927
Two.

1108
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,881
One.

1109
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,124
What a hunk of crap.

1110
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,930
Son of a bitch.

1111
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,366
Get in.

1112
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,446
Frank!

1113
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,086
Nice work.

1114
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,480
Terrific.

1115
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,609
ROBOT: You shouldn't
be driving, Frank.

1116
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,728
Pull over and
reformat my memory.

1117
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,406
It's the only way for you
to remain safe and healthy.

1118
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,687
Can't you just
erase the bad parts?

1119
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,683
My memory
is a holographic array.

1120
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,526
If I lost half of it, I'd still have every
memory, just in half the resolution.

1121
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,641
Okay, but you can't just
lobotomize yourself.

1122
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,202
It's like I explained to you, Frank.
I'm not a real person.

1123
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,889
We'll lay low till we get a
chance to go back for the stuff,

1124
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,962
and then we're out of here.

1125
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,241
Are we going to
lay low here, Frank?

1126
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,086
I hope so.

1127
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,961
Here. Do your stuff.

1128
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,880
Hey, there.

1129
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,201
Oh, my God, Frank. Hunter called me.
Are you okay?

1130
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,441
Hunter called you?

1131
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,363
How did you get in here?
You're not allowed back here.

1132
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,521
I came to apologise.

1133
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,806
You don't need to apologise.

1134
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,963
You've just been very forgetful
these days, that's all.

1135
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,690
No, I'm not forgetful.

1136
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,445
(STAMMERS) I've just
been a little bit busy.

1137
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,126
I'm fine, really.
Please, can I come in?

1138
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,923
Okay. Come in.

1139
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,446
Thank you.

1140
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,764
I'm kind of
in a bit of trouble.

1141
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,444
Of course you are.

1142
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,400
No. Well, this is
worse than late fees.

1143
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,285
I guess I'm sort of on the lam.

1144
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,441
On the lam?

1145
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,567
Yeah.

1146
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,081
I've led a very colourful life.

1147
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,684
I'm a cat burglar.

1148
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,962
You took the <i>Don Quixote.</i>

1149
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,247
Didn't you? Oh, Frank.

1150
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,606
Well, I...

1151
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,608
I just wanted you to have it.

1152
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,525
Is that you?

1153
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,407
Yes.

1154
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,531
Is that me?

1155
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,445
JENNIFER: When I moved back,
you just didn't remember.

1156
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,609
After our walk, we go
home, read for an hour.

1157
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,004
Then we have lunch.

1158
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,120
And... (STAMMERS)

1159
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,407
Then we stake out
our next target.

1160
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,481
Frank, wait.

1161
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,490
You really don't know any other information?
You haven't seen any...

1162
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,847
Oh... You gotta be kidding me.
Frank!

1163
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,926
Frank. Frank!
Hold it right there!

1164
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,047
Dad!

1165
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,490
No. Dad, stop!
Would you just stop?

1166
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,369
Frank, don't you lock this!

1167
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,723
Don't you touch
that robot, Frank!

1168
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,404
You are making this more
complicated than it has to be.

1169
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,290
By the time they get up here, we
can scale down from the window.

1170
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,091
Frank, stop.
Just wipe my memory.

1171
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,161
No.

1172
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:20,961
Frank, I know you don't like to
hear this, but I'm not a person.

1173
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,682
I'm just an advanced simulation.

1174
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,610
After you've wiped my memory,

1175
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,648
things can go back to normal,

1176
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,451
and you can continue
planning your next job.

1177
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,290
(DOOR RATTLING)

1178
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,487
What did you say?

1179
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,006
Remember, Frank?
Your next job.

1180
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,888
You deal in
diamonds and jewels,

1181
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,962
the most value by the ounce.

1182
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,250
Remember?
HUNTER: Dad!

1183
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,845
It's not too late, Frank.
Just open up.

1184
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,285
Don't give up.

1185
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,204
Lifting that high-end
stuff, no one gets hurt.

1186
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,760
Except those insurance
company crooks.

1187
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,644
Show me what to do.

1188
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:27,245
You have to open the round panel
in back and push the small button.

1189
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,483
I've unlocked it for you.

1190
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,968
I knew you had an off switch.

1191
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,481
Dad.

1192
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,647
Dad?

1193
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,969
Hey, how are you doing?

1194
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,325
It's Hunter.

1195
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,601
Hunter.

1196
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,042
You want to go
for a walk with me?

1197
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,963
Yeah, that sounds good.

1198
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:50,607
So...

1199
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,125
How's Princeton?

1200
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,526
Princeton.

1201
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,160
Princeton's good.

1202
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,241
Good?

1203
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,288
Hey, it's Princeton.

1204
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,201
Yes.

1205
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,081
Well,

1206
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,561
(GRUNTS)

1207
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,049
that's one thing that I
don't have to worry about.

1208
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,561
My son did better
than his old man.

1209
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,965
(INAUDIBLE)

1210
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,171
Bye, Daddy.

1211
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,123
I'll come see you soon.

1212
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,846
Bye, Dad.

1213
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:36,761
What?

1214
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,882
FRANK:<i> "Check the robot's
garden, under the tomatoes."</i>

1215
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,281
<i>"Have fun, kids. Dad."</i>
