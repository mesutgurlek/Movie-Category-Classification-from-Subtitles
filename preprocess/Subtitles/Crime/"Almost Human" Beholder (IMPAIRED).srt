You wouldn't have a clue.

00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:20,596
Well... and I'm
just positing this...

63
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,830
perhaps you're boring.

00:03:21,864 --> 00:03:24,233

You're calling me boring?

Hey, I need you to help me

68
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:29,638
check out a possible homicide.

69
00:03:29,672 --> 00:03:30,952
Sure. When did the call come in?

70
00:03:30,974 --> 00:03:32,407
It didn't.

71
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,109
There's no sign of forced entry,
no struggle.

72
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:36,311
No foul play indicated at all.

73
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:38,447
EMTs are calling it
cardiac arrest.

74
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:39,815
I don't understand.

75
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,149
Why is it considered
a possible homicide?

76
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,417
The victim's a chrome.

77
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:44,119
We're genetically engineered.

78
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:45,621
We don't die young.

79
00:03:56,466 --> 00:04:00,068
The deceased's name
is Brian Barrow, 28.

80
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:03,071
Bond trader
at Kane Asset Management.

81
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:05,607
JOHN: Explains the view.
Anything missing?

82
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:07,943
According to the report, no.

83
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:10,812
Rules out robbery as a likely motive.
Medical history?

84
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:12,147
Typical chrome.

85
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:13,248
No health issues.

86
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:16,318
World-class athlete,
a swimmer.

87
00:04:16,352 --> 00:04:18,854
He competed in the
Detroit Olympics of 2036.

88
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:20,923
There's no logical explanation
for this.

89
00:04:20,957 --> 00:04:22,491
How could he die like this?

90
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:23,926
We should do a toxicology.

91
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,062
Maybe EMTs got it right:
heart attack.

92
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:30,232
No. When a chrome is designed,
every box is checked:

93
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:32,467
health, beauty, intelligence.

94
00:04:32,502 --> 00:04:34,403
Look, I know chromes
aren't supposed to have

95
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:37,105
congenital defects;
perfect genes and all that.

96
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,907
Chromes don't normally
become cops, either.

97
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:41,009
There's a first time
for everything.

98
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:43,011
DORIAN:
Look at this.

99
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:46,658
There's a half-millimeter
puncture wound

100
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:48,050
at the base of his skull.

101
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:49,885
It goes all the way
to his cerebral cortex.

102
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,399
JOHN:
Can you get any DNA?

103
00:05:07,403 --> 00:05:08,470
Something wrong?

104
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:10,105
If this is the entry point

105
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,641
to something that killed him,
the DNA indicates

106
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:15,544
that Brian Barrow was murdered
by seven different people.

107
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:21,850
JOHN: Alec Govain,
Philip Moses makes seven.

108
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:23,085
And these are the seven people

109
00:05:23,086 --> 00:05:24,486
whose DNA we found in the wound?

110
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,687
Of the murder victim?

111
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:29,391
DORIAN: Whatever weapon was used
to kill Brian Barrow

112
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:31,326
was contaminated by the DNA
of all these people.

113
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:32,427
MALDONADO:
Did you locate them?

114
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:34,142
JOHN:
They're all dead.

115
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:37,008
DORIAN:
They're all listed as dying

116
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,167
of natural causes.
Their hearts stopped.

117
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,404
What do you think's
going on, John?

118
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:46,008
I don't know, but I doubt
they died of natural causes.

119
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,843
MALDONADO:
Are these people chromes?

120
00:05:47,877 --> 00:05:50,646
They are not, but they must
have been chosen for a reason.

121
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,481
Do you think we stumbled
upon a serial killer?

122
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:54,549
JOHN: Yeah. If he hadn't
killed the chrome,

123
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:55,945
we never would have
picked this up.

124
00:05:55,952 --> 00:05:57,419
It would be pretty easy to miss

125
00:05:57,453 --> 00:05:59,054
a little pinprick
on the back of the neck.

126
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:00,422
What do they have in common?

127
00:06:00,456 --> 00:06:01,657
They all lived in city limits.

128
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:03,425
Other than that, our algorithms

129
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:04,726
didn't pick up any patterns.

130
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:06,261
I see one pattern.

131
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:09,331
They're all very attractive.

132
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,076

135
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:00,916
We have to stop.

136
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:05,487
You will do what I want,
or I will call

137
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:07,222
the police,
and you will go to jail

138
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:08,557
for the rest of your life

139
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:11,159
for practicing
with a revoked license.

140
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:13,295

Someone's been talking

about the chrome murder.

146
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:06,422
You're kidding. Already?

147
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:07,923
"Metro Police hunt for
possible serial killer

148
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,225
targeting the city's
young and beautiful."

<i>L.A. Times, New York Times,</i>
<i>AP Deathwire.</i>

150
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:13,496
My comm's been
ringing off the hook.

151
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,830
We don't even know
anything yet,

152
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:16,365
and they're already
talking about it.

153
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,434
VALERIE: This kind of news sells.
Chromes have ears

154
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:20,403
all over the city,
and they take care of their own.

155
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:22,004
Now, I have a lead.

156
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,873
Two hours before
the victim was killed,

157
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:26,075
he was at the Electus Club
on Remington.

158
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:27,677
Killer could have followed him
from the club.

159
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,478
I'll check it out.

160
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:31,180
Actually, I should go.

161
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:32,848
Alone.

162
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,184
The Electus is a chrome club.

163
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,987
Of course. Makes sense.

164
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:39,889
We'll go check in with Rudy.

165
00:08:39,923 --> 00:08:43,092
The bodies of the other victims
are on the way to him.

166
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:45,287
If they have the same wounds
on the back of their neck,

167
00:08:45,295 --> 00:08:46,896
maybe he can find out
what killed them.

168
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:50,876
You sure you're up for
going to the chrome club?

169
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:53,102
Yeah. They may not respect
what I've done with my life,

170
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:55,504
but they sure respect
what I can do for theirs.

171
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,673
You were the first one they
called when Brian Barrow died.

172
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,188
Only because they're
praying it was murder.

173
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,977
If Brian Barrow died
of natural causes,

174
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:03,379
the chromes would have
to face something

175
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:04,747
they never thought possible.

176
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:07,950
The whole selling point of being
a chrome is a long life.

177
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:09,318
And perfect health.

178
00:09:09,353 --> 00:09:12,321
People pay a lot of money
for perfection.

179
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:15,024
Let me know
if you need anything.

180
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,568
Robert, Violet, welcome.

181
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:27,570
Nice to see you.

182
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,673
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:32,074
This is a private club.

184
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,287
I'm sorry, too,
that I'm a member.

185
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:37,246
Detective Valerie Stahl.

186
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,548
I need to see your surveillance
data from yesterday.

187
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,217
You're a police officer?

188
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:42,491
You're a chrome.

189
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,986
Yeah, I just
showed you my badge,

190
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:45,901
and I know you have
20/20 vision.

191
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:48,224
20/10. And I'm afraid
I can't help you.

192
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:49,759
I'm investigating the murder

193
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:51,193
of a chrome named Brian Barrow.

194
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:53,429
I'm sure you heard about it
on the news.

195
00:09:53,463 --> 00:09:55,064
As general manager,
I'm responsible for protecting

196
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:56,565
the privacy of our members.

197
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,267
Maybe I'm not making
myself clear.

198
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:00,469
We believe his killer may have
followed him from here.

199
00:10:00,504 --> 00:10:03,305
In that case, he would show up
on the police drones,

200
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,580
wouldn't he?

201
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:06,275
Again, this is a private...

202
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,744
Club. Yes, I know, and I'm sure
you're smart enough to know

203
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,146
that I can get a search warrant

204
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,480
in about 45 seconds.

205
00:10:11,515 --> 00:10:12,915
And you must be
smart enough to know

206
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,150
that I can get
Chief Judge Thorne

207
00:10:14,184 --> 00:10:15,718
to quash it
ten seconds after that.

208
00:10:15,752 --> 00:10:17,887
- He's a member.
- I guess I'll just be forced

209
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:19,422
to cut your police patrol
by 50%.

210
00:10:19,456 --> 00:10:21,457
- Is that supposed to scare me?
- Should.

211
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:23,192
Based on statistical models,
it'll trigger

212
00:10:23,226 --> 00:10:25,461
a 32% rise in violent attacks
in the area.

213
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:27,163
Criminals find out we're not
patrolling like we used to,

214
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:29,131
and they're gonna
take advantage.

215
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,367
Before you know it,
this is a high-incident area.

216
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:33,035
You know how that works.

217
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,337
We don't need the police.

218
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:35,492
We have private security.

219
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:36,939
You mean the guy in the hallway

220
00:10:36,974 --> 00:10:38,975
violating the concealed
weapons statute 49B?

221
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:42,311
That's a lot to sweep under
the rug, even for Judge Thorne.

222
00:10:42,346 --> 00:10:44,680
- Sorry. Is there a problem?
- Yeah.

223
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:46,215
Do you have anyone
a little more formidable?

224
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:47,350
(quiet laugh)

225
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:48,985
Oh, not me.

226
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,252
I bruise easily.

227
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:51,687
Chromes don't bruise easily.

228
00:10:51,722 --> 00:10:53,055
Ah, you are

229
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,124
a good police officer.
I'm the owner.

230
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:57,426
You want to sit?

231
00:10:57,461 --> 00:10:58,861
I'd love to.

232
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:01,063
Jake Bellman.

233
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:08,814
DORIAN:
<i>Do you think it was a chrome</i>

234
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,172
that leaked our investigation
to the press?

235
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,447
It's possible.

236
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:13,142
They got a lot of
pull in this town.

237
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:14,543
Do you know
how many murders there are

238
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:15,845
in this city every year?

239
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,813
- 756.
- Yeah, a lot.

240
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:19,808
One of them turns out to
be a chrome, and suddenly

241
00:11:19,816 --> 00:11:21,884
the whole world stops.

242
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:23,486
Just proves my point.

243
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,654
What point?

244
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:26,389
That technology, in this case

245
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:27,790
chromes,

246
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:29,225
is driving a wedge
between people.

247
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:31,360
Making it us versus them.

248
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:34,196
Technology, like being
holo-blocked on a date.

249
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:36,098
I thought we agreed
that you had a bad date

250
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:37,333
because you're boring.

251
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:39,969
You just can't handle the fact

252
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:42,204
that technology's
part of the problem.

253
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:43,773
Cuts a little close
to the titanium.

254
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:47,043
No, in fact, I'm excited
to embrace this new,

255
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:49,278
- anti-tech lifestyle.
- Really?

256
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:50,913
On the way back
to the precinct,

257
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:53,416
let's replace your robotic leg
with a tree limb.

258
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,751
Or maybe something useful,
like a shovel.

259
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:57,253
I wish I had a shovel.

260
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
JAKE BELLMAN:
<i>I was an attorney at 18,</i>

261
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:03,192
so I know that detectives

262
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:05,061
can't cut police patrols.

263
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:06,362
(quiet laugh)

264
00:12:06,396 --> 00:12:08,297
I'm gonna get that footage

265
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:10,099
one way or the other.

266
00:12:11,268 --> 00:12:12,802
A chrome was killed.

267
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:14,270
A member of your club.

268
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:15,805
One of your own.

269
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,873
We want to know
what the story is.

270
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:21,077
Okay, well, I want to know
what your story is.

271
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:23,913
Why, 'cause I'm
a police officer?

272
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:25,448
I'm a curiosity to you?

273
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:28,451
No, but I am curious.

274
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:31,420
It's a long story.

275
00:12:31,455 --> 00:12:32,622
Well, I've got time.

276
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:35,458
Yeah? You don't need
to get back to your club?

277
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:37,727
No.

278
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:40,129
Being a cop, it's
not the strangest

279
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:41,998
life choice I've
heard for a chrome.

280
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:44,133
You know,
my brother's a sculptor.

281
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,069
You want to know
what his medium is?

282
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:48,671
Sure.

283
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:49,839
You ever heard of a chain saw?

284
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:51,807
Yes.
Chain saw and lumber.

285
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:53,476
That's his medium.

286
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,678
Not too many galleries
for something like that.

287
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:57,813
I think they kind of

288
00:12:57,848 --> 00:13:00,249
overdid his creative gene.

289
00:13:00,284 --> 00:13:02,685
I can imagine you'd know
how my parents felt

290
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:05,354
having a chrome who didn't
meet their expectations.

291
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:09,125
You pity him?

292
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,427
(laughs)
No. He pities us.

293
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:13,429
He's proud to call himself
a sculptor.

294
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:14,864
He's happy.

295
00:13:14,898 --> 00:13:16,732
What about you?

296
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,301
You proud to call yourself
a police officer?

297
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:19,869
Yes.

298
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:23,673
Even in front of other chromes?

299
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:25,007
(sighs)

300
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:27,343
I told you it's a long story.

301
00:13:27,377 --> 00:13:29,278
Are you happy?

302
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:32,682
Yeah, I am.

303
00:13:32,716 --> 00:13:35,351
Every time I get a bad guy.

304
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:40,957
Then let's get you
that surveillance video.

305
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:43,635
FEMALE REPORTER:
<i>Updating our top story...</i>

306
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,095
police officials
refuse to confirm

307
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,098
an investigation into
the so-called beauty killer.

308
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:51,033
But sources close to the probe

309
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:53,736
say the hunt
for a possible serial murderer

310
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,005
is underway and intensifying.

311
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,274
This is Claire Chang re...

312
00:13:58,308 --> 00:14:00,309
- Rudy.
- Oh! (groans)

313
00:14:00,344 --> 00:14:01,377
You're here.

314
00:14:01,411 --> 00:14:04,013
Finally. (sighs)

315
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:06,349
Mausoleum dropped off three
of the exhumed bodies

316
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:07,717
an hour ago.

317
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:08,784
And...

318
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:10,353
you were right.

319
00:14:10,387 --> 00:14:12,888
Vir-topsy reveals
that all seven of them

320
00:14:12,923 --> 00:14:16,025
have the same wound, uh,
at the base of the neck.

321
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,460
They were indeed murdered.

322
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:19,262
Have a look.

323
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:22,374
JOHN:
Any idea what caused it?

324
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,933
I might, yeah.

325
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,237
Something wrong?

326
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:32,041
You've got this "beauty killer"
out there,

327
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:34,043
and I have to hear
about it on the news.

328
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:35,544
You don't think to warn me?

329
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:37,780
What's the difference

330
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:40,583
between me and all seven
of these victims?

331
00:14:40,617 --> 00:14:42,418
Hmm? I'll tell you.

332
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:44,120
They're all dead.

333
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:46,088
You're worried
that you're gonna be targeted?

334
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:48,090
I was a child model.

335
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,559
I-I have
a Rothschild's nose.

336
00:14:49,593 --> 00:14:51,894
My grandmother's
a sixth cousin of the heir.

337
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:53,729
(laughing)

338
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:56,399
(clears throat)

339
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:02,038
It was an oversight, Rudy.

340
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:03,105
Uh, we're sorry.

341
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,273
Duly noted.

342
00:15:04,308 --> 00:15:05,575
So what did you find?

343
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:06,943
Something in the wound.

344
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:09,912
First centimeter,
a very clean insertion point,

345
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:11,380
consistent with a needle.

346
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:13,816
After that, it gets weird.
It's irregular.

347
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:17,853
JOHN:
Looks like tiny

348
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:19,789
claw marks.
They are.

349
00:15:19,823 --> 00:15:21,090
From nanobots.

350
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:22,158
Nanobots?

351
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,726
Are you saying

352
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,595
robots were injected
into their necks,

353
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:28,431
crawled inside their skulls
and killed them?

354
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:30,266
Yeah, same as Brian Barrow.

355
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,701
In fact, they found

356
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:33,469
two of these things
still inside him.

357
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:35,571
I call them Mike and Ike.

358
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:39,408
Any idea what Mike and Ike
are designed to do?

359
00:15:39,443 --> 00:15:40,676
I'm working on it.

360
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:48,017
Great work at the Electus Club.

361
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:50,653
I'm amazed they gave up
the tape without a fight.

362
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:53,522
Thanks.

363
00:15:53,557 --> 00:15:55,424
What's on your mind?

364
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,026
I'm thinking
maybe it wasn't so bad

365
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,462
being around chromes after all.

366
00:15:59,496 --> 00:16:00,997
The last time
you dealt with chromes,

367
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:03,165
you were at the shooting range
for three hours.

368
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,001
Poor targets didn't know
what hit them.

369
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:07,036
Yeah, well...

370
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,339
I guess we can all be surprised.

371
00:16:10,374 --> 00:16:13,109
I spent so much time resenting
where I came from

372
00:16:13,143 --> 00:16:15,344
that I forgot
they're people, too.

373
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:18,147
You know, sometimes it's nice

374
00:16:18,181 --> 00:16:20,249
to connect with people
who are like you,

375
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:21,617
who understand you.

376
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:23,986
Is that why you keep
Kennex around?

377
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:25,121
No.

378
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:26,322
I lost a bet.

379
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:27,890
(laughs)

380
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:30,192
MAN:
Captain.

381
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:33,775
Looks like facial rec
has a match.

382
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:37,266
(cell phone rings)

383
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:38,501
Stahl.

384
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:40,436
Hey. I got the footage
from the Electus Club.

385
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,737
I'm sending you a file.

386
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:42,939
What do you got?

387
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:45,608
I have Brian Barrow
leaving the club at 5:30.

388
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:47,009
Keep watching... There!

389
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:48,277
You see that?

390
00:16:48,312 --> 00:16:49,512
The guy in the coat?

391
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:51,681
Yup. I think that's our guy.

392
00:16:51,715 --> 00:16:53,516
He follows Barrow
down Remington.

393
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,984
Comes around Sixth Avenue.

394
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:56,786
And then I get
a facial recognition

395
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,754
from the Bitcoin exchange
across the street.

396
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:01,357
Comes up as Alec Govain.

397
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:02,358
That's one of the dead victims.

398
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:03,392
Correct.

399
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:04,961
It's not over.

400
00:17:04,995 --> 00:17:06,362
He comes around the next corner.

401
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:08,731
Now a camera from the cab stand
picks him up.

402
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:11,000
This time, facial rec reads him
as Todd Paxton.

403
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:12,368
JOHN:
Another victim.

404
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:15,404
How could one man
come up on facial rec

405
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,806
as two different people?

406
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,674
I think I have an answer.

407
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:26,849
There you are.
Thank you.

408
00:17:31,822 --> 00:17:33,623
Can... can I help you?

409
00:17:33,657 --> 00:17:35,791
One large nitro.

410
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:37,360
Coming right up.

411
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:39,161
RUDY:
<i>What these nanobots</i>

412
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:41,998
are programmed to do,
they read and reconstruct

413
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:43,533
facial tissue.

414
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,001
What did he say?

415
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:46,769
He said our killer is stealing

416
00:17:46,803 --> 00:17:48,471
<i>parts of people's faces.</i>

417
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:53,075
Did anyone ever tell you
you have very pretty eyes?

418
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,946
RUDY: <i>This is about
nanobot plastic surgery.</i>

419
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:09,365
Dr. Randolph Amir.

420
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:12,134
Excuse me. Excuse me!

421
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:14,103
(door opens) Stop! You're
not allowed to be in...

422
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:15,638
Dr. Randolph Amir?

423
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:17,640
- Yes. - We understand
that you're involved

424
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:18,974
in the research

425
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:21,143
into nanobot
facial reconstruction.

426
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:23,879
Yeah, I'm gonna call you back.

427
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:26,349
The idea was a new technology.

428
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:28,551
Nanobot facelifts
on an atomic level.

429
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:30,553
No more laser nips and tucks.

430
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:31,987
Microscopic robots programmed

431
00:18:32,022 --> 00:18:34,957
to rebuild the face
from the inside.

432
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:37,593
Not a single scar.
At least not on the outside.

433
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:39,428
- And?
- And...

434
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:41,364
it did not go well.

435
00:18:41,398 --> 00:18:42,798
I wasn't involved in the trials.

436
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,633
But I have to admit I was

437
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:47,236
one of the first people
to really believe in it.

438
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,371
We still don't know why.

439
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:50,406
Why what?

440
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,375
It was stopping people's hearts.

441
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:56,979
On the victim, we found a mark
right at the...

442
00:18:57,013 --> 00:18:58,414
At the base of the skull.

443
00:18:58,448 --> 00:19:00,216
Yeah, the device
that inserts the nanobots

444
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,551
into the neck
is called an actuator.

445
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:03,853
Uh, let's say

446
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:06,989
you wanted his perfect nose.

447
00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:08,491
The actuator injects
the nanobots

448
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,192
into the target area.

449
00:19:10,227 --> 00:19:11,994
They're programmed to collect
his genetic blueprint.

450
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:13,929
Then the actuator
would draw them out again,

451
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:15,598
and then they'd be
injected into you.

452
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,366
The patient.

453
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:18,934
Rebuilding your nose
to look exactly like his.

454
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:20,569
All done from the inside.

455
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:22,171
The problem was

456
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:23,839
the electricity caused
by the nanobots

457
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:25,841
somehow triggered an arrhythmia
in the donor's heart

458
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:27,243
until it stopped.

459
00:19:27,277 --> 00:19:29,512
The donors were dying.

460
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:34,617
Some of the recipients
in the study

461
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:37,353
were substantially disfigured.

462
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,161
Where would someone
find an actuator

463
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:47,630
to do this procedure?

464
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:55,104
The nanobots followed
their blueprint perfectly.

465
00:19:55,138 --> 00:19:57,973
You're one step closer
to your ideal face.

466
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:01,977
Let's keep going.

467
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:05,981
Now.

468
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:08,150
When will it ever
be enough, Eric?

469
00:20:12,356 --> 00:20:14,156
You know I know
all about the risks.

470
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:17,126
You know I don't care.

471
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,997
What you did to me
was worse than dying.

472
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:23,632
You volunteered for the trials.

473
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:27,169
Do it.

474
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:53,062
I don't like what that stuff
does to me.

475
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:56,465
You know I have to flood
your system with adrenaline,

476
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,700
boost your physical strength,

477
00:20:57,734 --> 00:20:58,801
or you will never survive

478
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:00,269
another procedure so soon.

479
00:21:04,207 --> 00:21:05,441
(gasps)

480
00:21:05,475 --> 00:21:06,776
(exhales)

481
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:09,979
(beeps)

482
00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:11,714
(machinery whirring)

483
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:13,482
(panting)

484
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,020
(groaning)

485
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:20,790
(groaning continues)

486
00:21:20,824 --> 00:21:22,725
(screaming)

487
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:27,730
(screaming stops)

488
00:21:56,526 --> 00:21:58,661
They're beautiful.

489
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,334
You know, it's okay
to have flaws, John.

490
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:07,503
Whatever helps you sleep.

491
00:22:07,537 --> 00:22:09,739
It is said that
the more flaws you have,

492
00:22:09,773 --> 00:22:10,940
the more human you are.

493
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:12,441
Have I told you how very human

494
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:14,010
you are lately?

495
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:15,778
You know, sometimes
when you're doing this,

496
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:17,780
I'm not really listening.

497
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:20,750
I don't have that many flaws.

498
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:21,951
Your left eye
is one half millimeter

499
00:22:21,985 --> 00:22:23,419
higher than the right.

500
00:22:23,453 --> 00:22:25,388
Your nose has an abnormality
one inch from the base.

501
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:27,323
Yeah, that's from being
punched in the face.

502
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:28,791
Adds character.

503
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:30,126
You have a fertile unibrow

504
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,560
that you tend to regularly.

505
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:33,262
At least it's my face.

506
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:35,231
I know where I came from.

507
00:22:35,265 --> 00:22:37,366
You're a composite; who
knows where you came from?

508
00:22:37,401 --> 00:22:39,135
(phone rings)
Just think about that.

509
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:40,536
Kennex.

510
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,804
VALERIE:
Hey, John, where are you?

511
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:43,939
I'm on my way to Chinatown.

512
00:22:43,974 --> 00:22:45,608
Near the Wall.

513
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:46,909
We've got another victim.

514
00:22:46,943 --> 00:22:48,244
What have you got?

515
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:50,413
I have an informant
who knows everything

516
00:22:50,447 --> 00:22:51,681
about the black market.

517
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:52,915
We're trying to find
an actuator.

518
00:22:52,949 --> 00:22:54,216
What's an actuator?

519
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:56,185
It's what our guy is using
to kill these people.

520
00:22:56,219 --> 00:22:57,586
I want to see
if I can track one,

521
00:22:57,621 --> 00:22:59,388
find out where he got it.

522
00:22:59,423 --> 00:23:01,624
The latest victim has
the same M.O.

523
00:23:01,658 --> 00:23:03,459
Heart stops, small wound

524
00:23:03,493 --> 00:23:05,695
at the back of the neck.

525
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:07,997
John, the last seven murders
were each a month apart,

526
00:23:08,031 --> 00:23:10,766
and the last two victims
were within 48 hours.

527
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:12,268
This guy's accelerating.

528
00:23:12,302 --> 00:23:15,237
We need to stop him.

529
00:23:16,673 --> 00:23:18,153
DORIAN:
You chew with your mouth open,

530
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:20,276
you lie about putting gel
in your hair,

531
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,277
and you snore.

532
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:22,545
JOHN:
How do you know I snore?

533
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:24,447
Your smartbed told me.

534
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:26,983
Oh, I didn't realize you
two had a relationship.

535
00:23:27,017 --> 00:23:28,284
What else did it tell you?

536
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:29,585
I don't know.

537
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:31,988
Whatever it was,
I purged it from my data.

538
00:23:32,022 --> 00:23:33,422
Apparently,
I didn't want to remember.

539
00:23:33,457 --> 00:23:35,358
(sighs) Good.

540
00:23:35,392 --> 00:23:38,794
So what does this informant
look like?

541
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:40,930
I'll know him when I see him.

542
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:43,132
(crowd cheering)

543
00:23:51,008 --> 00:23:54,443
I hate to see robots used
for entertainment like this.

544
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:56,612
(cheering continues)

545
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,692
(cheering continues)

546
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:20,803
You know a guy called Dicarlo?

547
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:23,406
No.

548
00:24:28,378 --> 00:24:30,858
DORIAN:
What are you doing, man?

549
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,384
Hey, Dicarlo.

550
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:39,221
Damn it, Kennex!

551
00:24:40,557 --> 00:24:42,558
I thought you were dead.

552
00:24:42,592 --> 00:24:44,126
Glad to see me?

553
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:46,896
Do you have any idea
how expensive these things are?

554
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,097
Huh?!

555
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:49,832
Dorian, Dicarlo.

556
00:24:49,866 --> 00:24:51,534
Dicarlo, Dorian.

557
00:24:57,427 --> 00:24:59,628
(crowd cheering)

558
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:01,587
That was my favorite exosuit.

559
00:25:01,622 --> 00:25:03,923
Super comfy on the inside

560
00:25:03,957 --> 00:25:06,225
and sweet like pie
on the outside.

561
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,094
Look, I need your help.

562
00:25:08,128 --> 00:25:10,797
I want to find something
called an actuator.

563
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:11,964
That's what it looks like.

564
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:15,535
Look at it.

565
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:17,804
- I am looking.
- Look at it like you mean it.

566
00:25:17,838 --> 00:25:19,872
It's used in
illegal high-end

567
00:25:19,907 --> 00:25:21,107
plastic surgery.

568
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:22,375
Plastic surgery?

569
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:23,409
Yeah, the kind that kills

570
00:25:23,443 --> 00:25:24,744
the person whose face you want.

571
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:26,913
You know where I can
find something like that?

572
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:28,948
What do I get out of it?

573
00:25:28,982 --> 00:25:31,551
Look, you either help us out
of the goodness of your heart,

574
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:34,020
or I'll get my robot to
toss you and your suit

575
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,421
over the Wall.

576
00:25:37,658 --> 00:25:39,358
Okay, look,

577
00:25:39,393 --> 00:25:41,794
there's a guy,
and if there's heat on you,

578
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:43,963
he can change your face
so facial rec

579
00:25:43,997 --> 00:25:45,465
won't recognize you.

580
00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:46,866
Is this guy a doctor?

581
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,601
I don't know. Probably.

582
00:25:48,635 --> 00:25:49,735
Where do we find him?

583
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,771
In the East Term.

584
00:25:55,943 --> 00:25:58,411
(sirens wailing)

585
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,915
(computer chirping)

586
00:26:04,017 --> 00:26:07,153
(beeping)

587
00:26:08,222 --> 00:26:10,857
(knocking)

588
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:12,792
JOHN:
Police. Open up.

589
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:17,663
- Police. Open up.
- No, no, no.

590
00:26:25,873 --> 00:26:27,440
(bellowing)

591
00:26:27,474 --> 00:26:30,309
(grunting)

592
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:34,347
A little help here?!

593
00:26:35,082 --> 00:26:36,949
(choking)

594
00:26:38,585 --> 00:26:41,888
(gasping)

595
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:43,456
He's gone into cardiac arrest.

596
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,391
(electrical whirring)

597
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:54,634
(panting)

598
00:26:54,668 --> 00:26:56,502
DORIAN:
He's dead.

599
00:26:56,537 --> 00:27:00,006
Looks like he took a shot
of synthetic adrenaline.

600
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,707
He was freakishly strong.

601
00:27:01,742 --> 00:27:04,444
Thought he was gonna
fight his way out.

602
00:27:04,478 --> 00:27:06,746
Whatever this guy was into,
he didn't want to get caught.

603
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,514
You think?

604
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:12,018
His name is Dr. Curtis McCann.

605
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:13,686
Was.

606
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,323
He was one of the 20 doctors
involved in the nanobot trials.

607
00:27:17,357 --> 00:27:18,658
He lost his medical license

608
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:20,226
for hiding the side effects.

609
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,861
(computer chirping)

610
00:27:21,895 --> 00:27:25,932
Dorian, here's the guy
we're looking for.

611
00:27:27,968 --> 00:27:29,235
This face is a composite

612
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:30,703
of the specific features
of the victims.

613
00:27:30,737 --> 00:27:33,339
There are ten parts
to this facial construction.

614
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:35,608
These are the
facial features he wants.

615
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:37,110
There have only been
nine victims so far.

616
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:39,512
Means there's still
one out there.

617
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:42,749
Can you extrapolate
who the next victim's gonna be?

618
00:27:44,418 --> 00:27:47,286
According to facial rec,
this looks like the next victim.

619
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:50,189
Looks like he selected
the cheekbone structure.

620
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:53,426
Stahl, we think we know

621
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,596
who the next victim's
going to be.

622
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:02,101
Freeze!
This is the police.

623
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:03,136
Sweep the perimeter.

624
00:28:03,137 --> 00:28:04,303
Jonathan Geddes?

625
00:28:04,338 --> 00:28:05,505
What the hell is this?

626
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:06,939
(sighs)

627
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:08,908
We're here to protect you.

628
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:12,779
What have you got?

629
00:28:12,813 --> 00:28:13,880
Nothing yet.

630
00:28:13,914 --> 00:28:15,114
We've got a plainclothes
downstairs,

631
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:16,916
<i>but we're ready for him up here</i>

632
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,852
<i>if he makes it past him.</i>

633
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:21,454
Any more info
on the killer's I.D.?

634
00:28:21,488 --> 00:28:23,623
We subpoenaed the insurance
company to get the names

635
00:28:23,657 --> 00:28:25,758
of the patients in the trials.

636
00:28:25,793 --> 00:28:28,027
Might take a few days
to get through the red tape.

637
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:29,382
VALERIE:
<i>We don't have that long.</i>

638
00:28:29,396 --> 00:28:32,231
JOHN:
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

639
00:28:37,404 --> 00:28:39,038
(phone ringing)

640
00:28:39,072 --> 00:28:41,174
Hold on a minute.

641
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:45,144
(ringing continues)

642
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:50,550
Who is it?

643
00:28:50,584 --> 00:28:52,452
The call is scrambled.
Answer it.

644
00:28:52,486 --> 00:28:53,886
And say what?
I don't know.

645
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:55,521
Just-just use his voice,
you know,

646
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:56,789
like you... like you do mine.

647
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:58,458
I have never heard his voice.

648
00:28:58,492 --> 00:29:00,653
I've only heard him grunt
when he was kicking your ass.

649
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:02,361
(ringing continues)

650
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,935
(ringing stops)
(sighs) Terrific.

651
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:11,270
JOHN:
Hey, I'm back. Sorry.

652
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:14,140
He's not gonna give up

He did work at the DMV.

He went on disability

September 9, a year ago.

707
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,644
That's when the trials
were beginning.

708
00:32:39,678 --> 00:32:42,180
Do you think he still
has access to the DMV files?

709
00:32:42,214 --> 00:32:44,683
He could. Technically,
he's still an employee.

And there's nothing

They chatted every day.

DORIAN:
Her screen name is Judy.

740
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:07,866
They communicated this morning.

741
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,801
They've been corresponding
for months.

742
00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:11,936
He told her he lives in Arizona.

743
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:13,138
They've never met,

744
00:34:13,172 --> 00:34:15,507
but he's using his real name.

745
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:17,175
I don't think she's a victim.

746

He's perfecting
his face for her.

JOHN: Have you got her address?

748
00:34:20,646 --> 00:34:23,048
All I have is a screen name.

749
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:25,383
With a little time,
I think I can track her

750
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:27,898
through her IP address.

751
00:34:30,423 --> 00:34:31,856

Yes.

00:34:35,394 --> 00:34:37,295
I think I found her.

755
00:34:38,597 --> 00:34:40,532
The food cartridges
are in the third bag.

00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,110
in the world...

819
00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:51,624
that there's someone
out there for everyone?

820
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:54,048
I do.

821
00:39:55,887 --> 00:39:56,927
That's old-fashioned.

822
00:39:56,952 --> 00:39:57,919
That's me.

823
00:39:57,953 --> 00:39:58,920
(chuckles)

824
00:39:58,954 --> 00:40:01,222
Old-fashioned.

825
00:40:01,256 --> 00:40:04,158
Even my robot's discontinued.

826
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,827
Do you want me to come
to a bar with you

827
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,195
and watch you drink?

828
00:40:07,229 --> 00:40:09,330
(chuckles) No.

829
00:40:09,364 --> 00:40:10,565
No, that's okay.

830
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:12,400
That, uh... got a little
weird last time.

831
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:13,835
(chuckles)

832
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,004
Good night, John.

833
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:32,129
Hey, John.

834
00:40:32,154 --> 00:40:33,387
Hey.

835
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:34,489
You going home?

836
00:40:34,523 --> 00:40:36,290
Yeah, I was thinking about it.

837
00:40:36,325 --> 00:40:38,993
I might head out for a drink.
You ever heard of

838
00:40:39,027 --> 00:40:41,329
a place called Leo's? That's
actually where I'm going right now.

839
00:40:41,363 --> 00:40:42,563
I love that place.

840
00:40:42,598 --> 00:40:43,959
Come on.
You're kidding me. Really?

841
00:40:43,966 --> 00:40:46,467
- Yeah.
- Detective Stahl.

842
00:40:46,502 --> 00:40:47,602
VALERIE:
Hi.

843
00:40:47,636 --> 00:40:48,636
I'm sorry. I'm...

844
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,670
not interrupting, am I?

845
00:40:49,705 --> 00:40:51,739
No. No, not at all.

846
00:40:51,773 --> 00:40:53,207
Jake, this is John.

847
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,876
Hey. How are you?

848
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,444
- You ready?
- Yeah.

849
00:40:56,478 --> 00:40:57,845
Will I see you there?

850
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,747
Yeah. Yeah, I might swing along.

851
00:40:59,781 --> 00:41:00,982
You know, but...

852
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:03,217
got a few reports
to finish, but...

853
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,852
You guys have fun.

854
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:06,954
Don't work too hard.
