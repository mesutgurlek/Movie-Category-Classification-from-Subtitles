1
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:00,501
[sighs]

2
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,000
Man on radio:
foxtrot 31 delta...

3
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:20,501
Tango one romeo headed
for your 20, over.

4
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:24,133
Second man on radio:
zero alpha, copy,
bring it on, out.

5
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,734
Dr. lightman?

6
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:52,734
This way, doc.

7
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:55,934
"doc." i like that.
i do, you know? i do.

8
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,367
Right this way.

9
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:01,100
Watch your head here.

10
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:07,901
Festive.

11
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:09,734
Yeah, the more i make,
the better they get.

12
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:11,734
Welcome to the north pole,
dr. lightman.

13
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:13,167
John parks, team commander.

14
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:14,567
How do you do?

15
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:16,968
Look, straightaway,
i see you're wondering
what idiot came up

16
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:19,300
With the plan
to send me over here.

17
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:20,801
So, we have something
in common.

18
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,434
Charlie team
at altitude,

19
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,033
Waiting for your
go-order, boss.

20
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,033
Right now, all you
and i care about are my
12 soldiers in the air,

21
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,534
Ready to halo into
the taliban compound
our new friend here says

22
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:32,067
Are holding
those two marines.

23
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,067
Wait. i mean,
you already sent
the mission over

24
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,868
Before i even had
a chance to talk
to you?

25
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,868
I moved my team
within striking distance.

26
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,434
I do my job,
you do yours.

27
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:42,167
Final decision's mine,
period.

28
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:44,601
No disrespect,
but we don't have
a lot of time

29
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,968
To screw around
before these animals
start cutting heads off.

30
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:48,367
All right, well,
do me a favor, will you?

31
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:50,968
Just hold on
the go-order, you know,
till i've had a chance

32
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:52,467
To talk to your
new friend here.

33
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:54,801
Yeah, i'll do my best not
to screw around, all right?

34
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,767
We gave him a shave,
cleaned him up.

35
00:08:57,834 --> 00:09:00,501
Sat-link eyes
to your people.

36
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:09,767
Do you believe
in santa claus?

37
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:13,200
Up.

38
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,667
Cheers.

39
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:27,100
Say hello to
the folks back home.

40
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,934
I'm serious.

41
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,801
Say hello to the folks
back home.

42
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:35,501
Hello.

43
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:37,000
Whoa. he felt that.

44
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:39,834
Deep sadness at
the mention of home.

45
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:42,534
Loker: what are they?
paper snowflakes?

46
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:45,934
Torres: when lightman asked him
if he believed in santa claus,
i saw a flash of hope.

47
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,501
Where's home for you,
franko?

48
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,934
What?

49
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,767
Where's home for you,
franko?

50
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:55,367
1276 bayview,
baltimore, maryland.

51
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:58,033
Torres: blurts out
a street address, like he
memorized it by heart.

52
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,534
I--i lived
with my aunt.

53
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:00,968
Aunt wendy.

54
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,567
[chuckles]
i'm sorry?

55
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:05,367
Franko:
wendy perriman.
my aunt.

56
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:07,300
Is that supposed to mean
something to me or--

57
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:09,400
My aunt.

58
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:11,901
Bayview what?

59
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:14,400
Bayview avenue?

60
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:17,400
Bayview...terrace?
boulevard?

61
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:19,267
Street? what is it?
[whispers]
avenue.

62
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:21,734
Lightman: 'cause you seemed,
you know, pretty sure
about every other detail,

63
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:24,234
Except for that
one small thing.

64
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,801
Bayview road, baltimore.

65
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:29,234
And the natives
pronounce it "ballmer."

66
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,801
You know, i'm not
buying much, if any,

67
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:33,567
Of the whole aid worker,

68
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,100
Aunt wendy story.

69
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,033
I mean, why lie about
your aunt wendy

70
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Unless she's part
of some cover-up,

71
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:41,334
Some--what is it?

72
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,067
Cia?

73
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:46,734
Oh, that struck a nerve.

74
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,834
All right. moving on.

75
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:52,434
How do you know where
the taliban are holding
these two marines?

76
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,467
Why give up
that information?

77
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:57,234
Because
i'm an american,
not like you.

78
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,834
Ex-cia,

79
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:01,701
Rogue lunatic--
i mean, whatever it is,
any idiot can see

80
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:05,334
That you've--you've
grown some deep...

81
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,133
Hatred of all things
uncle sam.

82
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,234
You know what i think?
i think you're just...

83
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,234
A traitor...

84
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,801
Trying to save
his own skin.

85
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:20,467
What's your
taliban name, franko?

86
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:25,534
This close to the border
with pakistan,

87
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,534
The taliban never moves
more than ten miles

88
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,033
With prisoners
in the first 48 hours,

89
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,534
And only at night.

90
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:33,601
The place i told
these soldiers about

91
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,100
Is the safest place
to hide

92
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,267
That close to where
the marines were
captured.

93
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:39,701
He said the first
half of that with
extreme confidence

94
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,300
Because it's
probably true.

95
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,000
But he used
the word "safest,"

96
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:44,901
Inferring that the
taliban have more

97
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,334
Than one place
they hide out.

98
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,734
Where else might
the taliban be hiding?

99
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:50,234
Nowhere.

100
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,400
Oh, well, your shoulder
begs to differ.

101
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:55,100
Man: all call signs,
stand by for go.

102
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,167
He's lying.

103
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:05,400
Yeah, he's sending you
to the wrong location.

104
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:07,467
He's...lying.

105
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:09,434
Man on radio: charlie one,
over target area now.

106
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:11,467
You're sure he's lying?
yeah.

107
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:14,100
No. well, 70%.

108
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,601
Yeah, at best,
he's sending you to
an empty compound;

109
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,367
At worst, it's
an ambush, right?
sit down.

110
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,801
70%?
it's not an exact science.

111
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:24,734
If it was, you'd have
bin laden by now,
wouldn't you, huh?

112
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,200
Abort.

113
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,000
Do it, mo. now.

114
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:35,834
Abort. say again,
abort the mission.

115
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:38,534
You better be right,
dr. lightman.

116
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,467
Yeah.

117
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:49,101
Parks: forget it.
no way in hell.

118
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:51,667
Look, i get that
you're a scientist,

119
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,600
But this is no place
for experiments.

120
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:56,633
Look, this guy,
he's definitely
hiding something.

121
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,101
Whatever it is,
it's buried it deep.

122
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:00,101
And there's a connection
to your government
somewhere.

123
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:01,800
I'm telling you,
you gotta let me

124
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:03,301
Dig it out of him.

125
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,034
You mean to tell me
this maggot's some
sort of spy for us?

126
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:07,267
Yeah. cia, or related.

127
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:09,600
And either
he's protecting

128
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,368
Some long-term
deep cover operation,

129
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:12,867
Or he's just been
out here too long

130
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:14,900
And he's flipped
to the other side.

131
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:16,500
Those are just
theories, doc.

132
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:17,967
Look, you already
proved smarter
than that

133
00:13:18,034 --> 00:13:19,267
When you axed plan "a."

134
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:21,101
Don't give up
on me now, pal,

135
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,468
Or i'm on
the first donkey
out of here, all right?

136
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,201
Whatever he is,
whoever he is,

137
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:25,700
I don't care.

138
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:27,034
I need accurate intel
from him,

139
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:28,134
And i need it yesterday.

140
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:31,567
Yeah, yeah.
no, you're right.

141
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:32,967
Sod the science.
give me a weapon.

142
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:34,633
Well, at least
i'll get home in time

143
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,234
For my daughter's
christmas party.

144
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:38,434
I'm serious.
weapon please.

145
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,401
Mr. komisky?

146
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:45,567
Please. ed.

147
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:47,201
State department?
pentagon?

148
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:48,633
Defense.

149
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,734
Special deputy
operations and plans.

150
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,934
I'll be observing
dr. lightman's progress
with the prisoner.

151
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,567
Top secret news sure does
spread fast in this town.

152
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,267
Ha ha!
welcome.

153
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:01,267
Cute.
this way.

154
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,001
Rah!

155
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:16,034
All right.

156
00:14:16,101 --> 00:14:17,600
Well, he's ready
for battle,

157
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:21,401
And he's smart enough
to know when to live
to fight another day.

158
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:25,900
So he's a warrior.
he's not a martyr.

159
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,734
These are 3 of the boys
you tried to lead

160
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,434
To the wrong
taliban compound.

161
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,533
What was it? eh?

162
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,434
Was it an ambush?

163
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,434
Was it
an empty compound?

164
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,533
Oh, empty compound.

165
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,267
Well, that's something,
i suppose. eh, lads?

166
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,500
Hey!

167
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,067
We keep hearing
this story

168
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:49,001
About you being a cia
agent who got boned.

169
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,434
That you got sent
out here years ago,

170
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,267
Left for dead.
is that right?

171
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:55,001
If i don't get home
to texas, boy,

172
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:56,900
My wife is gonna take
my daughter

173
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:58,067
And move back
to michigan.

174
00:14:58,134 --> 00:14:59,734
Look, this is
my last tour.

175
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,234
After this, i'm done.

176
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,267
Is it true you got
boned by the cia?

177
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:05,067
Still don't understand
what you did.

178
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:06,401
What'd i do?

179
00:15:06,468 --> 00:15:09,034
You went over to the enemy,
you punk.

180
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:13,468
Attempt at anger.

181
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,800
No, wait, wait.

182
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:23,134
Now, i get it.
i see your shame.

183
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:24,633
I see it.

184
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,633
All right, it was
either join them or die.

185
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,900
I mean, these 3,
they might not do
what you did,

186
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:31,500
But i might.

187
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:32,967
I mean, i'm
a natural born
coward, me.

188
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:35,001
My blood runs as yellow
as the next man's.

189
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,234
Lightman just called him
a coward.

190
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:39,401
How is this helping
get our marines back
exactly?

191
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:40,468
Well, lightman just
called him a coward

192
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:42,201
Because he's about to
present him

193
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:43,334
With an opportunity
for redemption.

194
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,167
Watch.

195
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:47,934
But what you've
got in common
with these guys

196
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:50,101
Is that it's
all about living
to fight tomorrow,

197
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:52,434
Right, in the hope
that someday soon

198
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,900
You get to go home.

199
00:15:56,167 --> 00:16:00,700
If that's not
on the cards,

200
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:05,500
Then all that remains
is the last fight
you fight.

201
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:08,800
And then the question
becomes...

202
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,034
Which side of the fight
are you on?

203
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:14,201
He's thinking about it.

204
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:17,468
Oh, god. i'm--crap.
i'm so sorry.

205
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:20,034
Uh, here, let's--
quick, before it stains.

206
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:22,934
There is another hideout
in the area.

207
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:24,934
But first, i have...

208
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,301
First you have what?

209
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:27,934
A condition.

210
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:29,368
It's a very common
power play

211
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,001
For someone who feels
backed into a corner

212
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:33,500
With nothing
to lose or gain.

213
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:36,201
You have a what?
what do you got?

214
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:39,034
Every time you ask me
a question,

215
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,900
I get to ask you
a question.

216
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,700
The truth buys you
the truth.

217
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,434
You lie, i lie.

218
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,800
All right.

219
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:50,401
But first, you
show me on the map

220
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,600
Where the taliban
are holding these
two marines.

221
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,867
All right?

222
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:12,101
Ok, here.
there's two caves

223
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,667
With a tunnel
that connects them.

224
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,800
It's been there
for over 200 years.

225
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:20,034
Why didn't you
tell us about this
place to start with?

226
00:17:20,101 --> 00:17:23,267
No. he's been with
the taliban too long.

227
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,201
You're still
the bloody enemy.

228
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:26,401
Me, on the other hand--

229
00:17:26,468 --> 00:17:28,734
I'm all that's
between you two.

230
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:32,867
I'm really sorry
about this.

231
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,201
I needed an excuse
to talk to you

232
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:35,368
Away from komisky.

233
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:36,700
We need to figure out
some signals

234
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,633
Or this is gonna get
expensive.

235
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,201
Komisky's no stranger
to franko.

236
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,533
Yeah. you saw that, too?

237
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,767
Another thing i saw--

238
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:44,368
He's careful to keep himself
off the sat-link cameras,

239
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:45,700
Hidden from lightman
and franko.

240
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:49,134
Have you heard from my dad
in the last 24 hours?

241
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,800
Yeah. yeah. why?

242
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:54,468
Well, he always calls
to check in when he's
out of town,

243
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,734
And he hasn't this time.

244
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,468
His phone goes straight
to voicemail.

245
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:59,533
Sweetheart, he's really
swamped right now,

246
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,767
And he'll call
as soon as he can.

247
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:03,734
Hey guys, we're minutes away
from...

248
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,301
Hi, em,
how's the party coming?

249
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:08,334
Well, what are they
minutes away from?

250
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:09,767
Minutes away from what?

251
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:11,834
He will be back
before you know it, ok?

252
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,500
I gotta go, em, all right?
we'll talk later.

253
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,067
Yeah, yeah. that's it.

254
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:25,267
That's the cave.

255
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:27,167
Bloody better be.

256
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:28,500
Tell me.

257
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,734
Am i ever gonna get home?

258
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,700
We don't have time
for this game.

259
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:34,334
It's not a game.
it's a test of trust.

260
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:35,934
Right?

261
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:36,967
Well, if you ever
do get home,

262
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,700
You're pretty much
screwed.

263
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:42,401
It's the right cave.
i'm 100% certain.

264
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:47,900
Charlie one,
target confirmed.

All right. hey.

00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,567
What did he just say
to you? what did he
say to you?

277
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:26,800
He said, "kill me now,
it would be an honor."

278
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,834
You meant it,
didn't you?

279
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,334
Who are you now?
huh? who are you?

280
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:32,234
My taliban name
is khaled.
yeah?

281
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:34,234
My name is mo--short
for mohammed.

282

Man, over radio:

charlie three's hit bad.

283
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:37,334
Wait. out.

284
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:39,234
Oh!

285
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:41,533
Did you or did you not
send my men into an ambush?

286
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,767
I did not!

287
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:44,900
I told you it was
a taliban hideout.

288
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:47,067
Did you expect it
to be guarded?

289
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:51,567
Maybe you underestimate
your enemy.

290
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:52,500
No, wait!
no, wait!

291
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,101
Hey, he's telling
the truth.

292
00:19:55,167 --> 00:20:00,334
No, he was as
shocked as you are
by what happened.

293
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:03,301
And you're not going
to kill an unarmed man
in cold blood

294
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,101
Just out
of sheer frustration,
so knock it off.

295
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:07,468
All right?

296
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:14,134
You know that man?

297
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:15,500
You know
that man?

298
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:16,800
I've never
seen him before.

299
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:17,834
Do you know that man?

I've never seen him
before.

301

Foster? foster,
who you got in there?

Ed komisky,

00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,267
Hi, ed. i see you've met
my friend franko,

304
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:30,800
Oh, a little bit ago.

305
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:32,067

Is he one of the ones
who sent you here?

00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:42,934
Hey?

Is he the one
that sent you here?

What did he tell you?
what did he tell you?

311
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:51,201
Did he tell you
you were gonna be a hero?

312
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:52,700
Did he tell you you were
gonna be a patriot?

313
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:55,600
Is that...
what then, eh?
then what?

314
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:58,500
Oh, that's between
you and him?

315

Well, i'll be very happy to set
up that face-to-face meeting,

00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:03,468
But right now, we've got
some mess to clear up,

317
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,334
All right? move. move.

318
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:06,567
Kill the feed.

319
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:07,600
Kill the feed!

320
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,167
Komisky: what,
he's shutting us out?

321
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,700
Get him on
the sat-phone.

322
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:13,001
Order him to
give us eyes back.

323
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:14,934
Yeah, if you think
cal lightman is gonna jump

324
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:16,600
Just because you bark,
you don't know the man.

325
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,267
Trust me.

326
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:20,368
Call me
if he comes back online.

327
00:21:20,434 --> 00:21:22,468
You know franko,
don't you?

328
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,667
The only reason i'm here

329
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,401
Is because i want
to see those two marines

330
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:27,734
Returned home alive.

331
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,101
Us, too.

332
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:33,167
Look at you, huh?
look at you.

333
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:36,001
A minute ago, you said
you were willing to die

334
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:38,567
At this man's hand,
it would be an honor.

335
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:39,500
Now look at you.

336
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,401
You'd anything you can
to get home

337
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,201
Just because of what you saw
on that sat-link.

338
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,167
Man, over radio:
zero, charlie one, over.

339
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:48,234
Casualty, charlie three.

340
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:49,500
Chest wound.

341
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:51,767
Stand by air support
and casevac.

342
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:53,734
Stand by for coordinates.

343
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,867
If he calls in
an air strike, right,

344
00:21:55,934 --> 00:21:57,834
In a matter of minutes,
a lot of people are gonna die.

345
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,468
Doesn't matter
what side you're on.

346
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,301
When i got here,

347
00:22:01,368 --> 00:22:05,201
You thought i was here
to help you, didn't you?

348
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:06,967
Didn't you?

349
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,700
There's another way in.

350
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:10,867
Where?

351
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:12,067
When did you get hooked,
dr. lightman?

352
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:14,368
Let's go! let's go!
hurry the hell up.

353
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,134
What? what?

354
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,034
On war. on this.

355
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:19,167
You get high on being
in the middle of it all.

356
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:20,167
Don't you?

357
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:21,567
Don't you? i can
see it in your face.

358
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,934
Why are you--
why are you doing this?

359
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:24,001
Ok, you know what?

360
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:25,734
There is no
other way in.
they're dead.

361
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,301
Look, i told you,
you lie, i lie.

362
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:33,201
All right, bosnia, 1994.

363
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:34,734
I didn't see direct action,

364
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,800
But i was
this close to it.

365
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:43,234
You get lucky just one time.
you survive, right?

366
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:45,334
It's the rush.
there's no--

367
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:46,700
There's nothing like it.

368
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:48,234
It's delusions
of immortality.

369
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:49,667
Right? right?

370
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:51,834
You're enjoying this.

371
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:57,434
No, no. no, no.
now. now it's your turn.

372
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,934
You owe me the other
tunnel to that cave.

373
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:02,034
Tell them to go left--

374
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:04,867
No. you tell 'em.
you tell 'em.

375
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:06,267
You tell him!
you tell him!

376
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:07,934
Tell them to go left
about a hundred yards.

377
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:11,334
There's a rock
with an arch in it.

378
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:13,201
This doesn't work,
he's done.

379
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,234
Yeah, well,
so am i.

380
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,134
Man:
charlie call signs...

381
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:22,134
This isn't just
a test of trust,
is it?

382
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,134
Right.

383
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,567
You're playing this game

384
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:25,667
Because you think
that if this mission
goes south,

385
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:27,734
Then you're not
the only one to blame.

386
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,567
But if it succeeds,

387
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:35,600
I'm gonna become your
brother in arms, right?

388
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,167
I'm gonna be more
likely to help you

389
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:39,900
Somewhere down the road,
right?

390
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:44,134
Don't hold your breath.

391
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:51,667
Ms. lenox, what do you
know about ed komisky?

392
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:53,001
Mr. komisky
is a hangover

393
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:54,667
From previous
administrations.

394
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,734
Man's more like
a pentagon ghost.

395
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,201
We're beginning to think
that he was involved

396
00:23:58,267 --> 00:23:59,533
In some sort of operation

397
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,533
Which abandoned this man
franko in afghanistan.

398
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,700
Are you aware of
any such operations?

399
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:03,700
No.

400
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:06,001
You don't want
to think about it?

401
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:07,767
I know of no operations
involving franko.

402
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:08,967
No records exist of cia

403
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:11,034
Or any other
agency's involvement.

404
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:12,700
But he could be
an agency asset

405
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,667
That you have never
heard about?

406
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:15,767
No. i understand
what you're asking.

407
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,700
But i'm not sure
i can get

408
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,101
Any answers quicker than
you can.

409
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,533
Franko's aunt.

410
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,267
I need her here as soon
as possible.

411
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:23,468
Can you do that?

412
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:24,867
Hey, lightman's
back on line.

413
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:26,368
He needs our eyes and
ears for this next part.

414
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:27,533
We never had--

415
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,900
Never had this
conversation.
i got it.

416
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:36,167
If i help get
these marines out,

417
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:37,401
I want my story told.

418
00:24:37,468 --> 00:24:39,134
That's above my pay grade,
pal. dream on.

419
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:40,700
It's right at
my pay grade,

420
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:42,468
If your story's true.

421
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:44,267
Well, that's
the back entrance
into the cave.

422
00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:46,301
They're gonna hit a tunnel.

423
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:49,267
And they can go
one of two directions.

424
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,667
Left?
left is bad.

425
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:55,167
Charlie one, move right,
over.

426
00:24:55,234 --> 00:24:56,167
No, no, no!
wait, wait, wait!

427
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:57,267
Wait a second!

428
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:58,434
If this is a back way
into the cave,

429
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,633
It's also a back way out.

430
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,034
We mount a frontal assault.

431
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:02,734
That way they'll try and
haul ass out the back way

432
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,334
With the prisoners.

433
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:06,800
That's what i'd do.

434
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:08,967

They got his radio
when he was hit.

for good.

478
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:51,133
They're out there
on their own now.

479
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,834
Wait. what about us?

480
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:54,934
You got any contingencies?

481
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,801
In the event
of loss of comms

482
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,567
During contact
with the enemy,

483
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:01,300
We have 20 minutes to
haul ass out of here.

484
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:02,567
What happens
in 20 minutes?

485
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:05,167
Smart bombs turn
this place into
a parking lot.

486
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:06,300
And everything in it.

487
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:07,567
So the only way that you
can get out of here

488
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:09,367
Is if you lure the enemy
into the kill zone,

489
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:10,968
Which happens to be...
right?

490
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:12,100
Copy that.

491
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,267
Oh, thank you
very much.

492
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:14,667
All right,
you wait here.

493
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:17,133
If i'm not back
in 18 minutes,

494
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,934
You leave by that door.

495
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,634
You know how to use that?

496
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
[explosion]

497
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:29,300
Not bad
for a scientist.

498
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,200
I've had my moments.

499
00:27:36,534 --> 00:27:37,834
Terrific.

500
00:27:37,901 --> 00:27:39,534
We've got 17 minutes.

501
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:42,467
You want to tell me
about your moments?

502
00:27:42,534 --> 00:27:45,567
That game's over now.
yeah, i mean...

503
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:48,133
Besides, you're
the one who wants
his story told, so...

504
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,834
How badly you want
to hear it?

505
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,901
[explosion]

506
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:54,334
All right, well,

507
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,267
The answer's probably
gonna stay in this
room anyway. go on.

508
00:27:56,334 --> 00:27:57,834
Ask your question.

509
00:27:57,901 --> 00:27:59,267
What did you do
in bosnia?

510
00:27:59,334 --> 00:28:00,601
Intelligence.

511
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:03,267
You seem like you don't want
to really talk about it.

512
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:04,934
Why is that?

513
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,167
Well, the past
is the past, right?

514
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:07,734
I can relate to that.

515
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:10,267
I know that
you're trying to get
some common ground

516
00:28:10,334 --> 00:28:12,801
Between us, all right,
khaled,

517
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:15,767
But i didn't betray
my country.

518
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:18,100
You betrayed something.

519
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,767
Yeah, i betrayed myself.
how about you?

520
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:21,968
[explosion]

521
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,100
Mr. komisky,
a moment of your time?

522
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,000
You too, torres.

523
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:30,901
My real name is
specialist glen welsh.

524
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,501
What branch
of the military
were you in?

525
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:40,467
Uh, back to bosnia,
your betrayal.

526
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:41,634
All right.

527
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:45,834
Sarajevo. '94.

528
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:48,868
Right, we were
interrogating
a serb officer

529
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:50,067
About his
sniper positions.

530
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:51,300
We?

531
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:53,868
Yeah. mi6,
british intelligence.

532
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,901
And i didn't
believe him,

533
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,567
So we changed
his clothes

534
00:28:57,634 --> 00:29:00,300
And chocked him out
into sniper alley.

535
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:02,033
He lasted 4 seconds,

536
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,300
Got about 18 feet-ish.

537
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:07,000
His information
was accurate.

538
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:09,267
But he was the enemy,
right?

539
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:10,601
[gunfire]

540
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,300
I'm a scientist. i'm
not an executioner.

541
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:15,601
War got the better
of you, too.

542
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,067
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
now your turn.

543
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:20,834
I was aiming
for special ops.

544
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:23,934
Before i got there,
'99,

545
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,501
I got in a bar fight.

546
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:27,434
They threw me in the brig
for three years.

547
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:28,667
Manslaughter.

548
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,968
I could tell you
my drinks were spiked,

549
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:32,267
But what would you care,
right?

550
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:33,767
Right.

551
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:37,300
Two years later,
and this is right after 9/11,

552
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:41,734
I got jumped in the brig
and was thrown in the hospital.

553
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:43,300
Somebody had knifed me
in my back.

554
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:45,567
That's when they
offered me a way out.

555
00:29:45,634 --> 00:29:48,400
That man you saw
on the sat-link.

556
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:49,634
Yeah?

557
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:51,801
[explosion
and gunfire]

558
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:53,667
Ms. perriman.

559
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:56,067
Franko's aunt wendy?

560
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:59,434
Franko?
is he alive?

561
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:01,167
Where is he?

562
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,601
And they moved you straight
from the brig hospital

563
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:13,267
To a training facility,
right?

564
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:14,634
Uh-huh.
where?

565
00:30:14,701 --> 00:30:16,267
Somewhere out west.
i don't know exactly.

566
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:18,334
They didn't tell me--
you know,

567
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,300
It looked a lot like this
hell hole.

568
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:21,567
All right,
and they trained you
to do what?

569
00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:23,534
[explosion]

570
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:25,300
They taught me pashto.

571
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,000
They--they put me through

572
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:29,000
Their own brand
of special ops training.

573
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:31,834
And then they dropped
me in the middle of
taliban territory,

574
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:34,701
Posing as an aid worker
with shia sympathies.

575
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:37,767
You know, they said
they were gonna be watching me,

576
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:39,434
That they'd have my back

577
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:41,801
And that they'd pull me out
when the time was right.

578
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:43,200
All right,
but they didn't.

579
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:44,200
They never came back
for you, right?

580
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:45,701
Yeah.

581
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:47,534
They betrayed you,
right, so you went over
to the other side.

582
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:49,767
Is that it?

583
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:51,901
Did you ever kill any
american troops?

584
00:30:51,968 --> 00:30:53,534
No.

585
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,968
That's a bloody lie.

586
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:58,400
No. no. look.

587
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:03,534
Look, look, you try
to shoot over their heads,

588
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:08,033
But those bastards,
they just keep
shooting back.

589
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:13,400
What? what?
what are you doing?

590
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:19,267
Ah! aah!

591
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:21,667
Hold still!

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,467
How did the people
that put you here,

594
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:28,667
How did they know
how to find you?

595
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:30,234
How were they
tracking you? eh?

596
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,467
I think i know.
i think i know.

597
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:35,734
Hold still!
if i'm right,

598
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:37,834
This is gonna prove
your story's real.

What the hell
are you doing,
lightman?

600
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,267
All of you, you have to help me
hold him still!

601
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,467
Hold him still!

602
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:46,434
Hey, we gotta go!
we gotta go right now!

603
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:47,667
Not until
i've done this!

604
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:48,801
You listen to orders!

605
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:50,167
I often have orders
from the president.

606
00:31:50,234 --> 00:31:51,601
Did i forget
to mention that?

607
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,167
Now hold him still.

608
00:31:53,234 --> 00:31:54,501
Aah!

609
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:55,601
All right, give me
the pliers.

610
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,000

Aah!

613
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,067
My sister, peg, died
giving birth to franko.

614
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:10,601
And i raised him
just like he was my own.

615
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,434
Have you two
met before?

616
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:18,067
No.

617
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:21,901
What elementary school
did franko go to?

618
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:25,067
Who was his first
girlfriend?

619
00:32:27,234 --> 00:32:29,234
Ms. perriman...

620
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,100
I believe you really did have a
sister who died in childbirth,

621
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:34,534
Which is what makes
your story believable...

622
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:35,567
To the layman.

623
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:37,334
It's not a story.

624
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,200
Do you carry a picture
of your nephew?

625
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:40,834
I just--i imagine
over the years

626
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:42,133
Of not knowing
where he is

627
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,634
Or if he's even alive,

628
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:44,934
It might be a great
comfort to you,

629
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,300
You know, a symbol of hope
top have some--

630
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:47,267
Komisky:
that's enough.

631
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:49,434
You don't have
to answer that.

632
00:32:51,634 --> 00:32:53,467
They came to me
after 9/11.

633
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:57,434
My sister's death didn't have
to be for nothing, they said.

634
00:32:57,501 --> 00:32:59,400
She's definitely
telling the truth.

635
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:02,167
Now, i can tell you want
to get this out,

636
00:33:02,234 --> 00:33:03,534
So please keep going,
ms. perriman.

637
00:33:03,601 --> 00:33:05,968
Someone from the cia
did come to me.

638
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:11,634
I guess it was
like an acting role...

639
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:13,067
For my country.

640
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:16,133
You gotta understand,
i wanted

641
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,567
To do something.

642
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:19,434
We all wanted
to do something.

643
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,934
Including you, sir.

644
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,200
I believe that.

645
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:29,601
But you sent a man
into afghanistan

646
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:30,868
To infiltrate
the taliban.

647
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:32,534
Then what? you just
forget about him?

648
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:34,200
Or you just leave
him there to rot?

649
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:35,200
Or worse.

650
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:36,234
We lost him.

651
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,868
The battery in his
tracking device died.

652
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:40,467
The battery?
it happens.

653
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:43,634
Know how hard it is to find
anyone out there?

654
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:45,501
I've heard.

655
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:46,968
We kept waiting
for him to show up,

656
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:50,067
And when he didn't,
we assumed he was dead.

657
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:54,501
So please, take your
sanctimonious judgment

658
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:56,200
And park it
somewhere else.

659
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,067
Aah!

660
00:34:05,734 --> 00:34:07,133
Snow.

661
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,534
If we don't
get out of here,

662
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:10,501
It'll be the last white
christmas we ever see.

663
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:12,167
Not until i finish.
not until i finish.
hold on.

664
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:13,400
Aah!

665
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:15,300
Hey, hey, hey,
hold still!

666
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:18,033
Aah!

667
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,167
There.

668
00:34:21,234 --> 00:34:23,367
It's a tracking device.

669
00:34:23,434 --> 00:34:24,667
Two-year battery life.

670
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:25,834
He is one of ours.

671
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:27,033
Why didn't you tell us

672
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,033
Who you were
in the beginning?

673
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,200
Orders.

674
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,601
I disobey, i'm dead.

675
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:33,033
The only person
i reveal my
identity to

676
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,534
Is the man
with the code.
nobody else!

677
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:35,534
[explosion]

678
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:39,033
The code is aunt wendy.

679
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,334
Well, that's a reason.

680
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,300
But it's not
a real reason, is it?

681
00:34:42,367 --> 00:34:43,801
Come on, you can do
better than that.

682
00:34:43,868 --> 00:34:46,868
And these bastards caught
me, and they beat me.

683
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,667
Yeah. i was taliban.

684
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:50,501
Well, that's better.

685
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,501
So, who are you now, eh?

686
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:55,968
You're the expert.
you tell me.

687
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:58,400
[explosion]

688
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:02,334
You tell your mom?

689
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,334
No.

690
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,601
Why not?

691
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,501
Same reason you
didn't tell me.

692
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:08,501
Don't you think
you should tell her?

693
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:11,400
He can tell her
when he gets back.

694
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:21,200
Move out!
let's go, go!

695
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:28,467
Let's go! move, move!

696
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:30,701
Move, go!

697
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:34,334
Lightman,
you're out of here!

698
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Lightman:
no. no, no, no.

699
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,968
We saw it on your face
earlier, right?

700
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:39,801
You've got orders never to let
this man leave this room alive,

701
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:42,033
Don't you? eh?

702
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,033
Am i right?

703
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:50,567
These men remind you
of what you wanted to be,

704
00:35:50,634 --> 00:35:51,734
All right?

705
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:53,000
And so now it's about
a last fight you fight

706
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,434
And which side of the fight
you're on,

707
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:57,300
All right, and if you
finally get to do

708
00:35:57,367 --> 00:36:00,234
What you came here
in the first place to do.

709
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,601
Ok?

710
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:04,834
I need 45 seconds
of fight out of him

711
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:06,033
To clear the tunnel.

712
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,234
Here.

713
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:22,133
Where's home?

714
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,801

Nice job, doc!

00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:01,367
Not really!

That's him.

722
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:22,800
Heard you helped
get us out.

723
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:24,467
Thank you.

724
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,667
No. thank you.

725
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:59,700
Dr. lightman.

726
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:05,867
Oh. the real
aunt wendy.

727
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:09,433
Please don't do this.

728
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,867
This is a matter
of national security.

729
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:15,700
What story
did you people tell
specialist welsh,

730
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:17,467
Franko's, family?

731

Killed in action?

732
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,167
Died in the brig?

733
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:24,167
Oh, died
in the brig.
nice one.

734
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:25,533
I was serving
my country.

735
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,034
Oh, yeah?
our country, you mean.

736
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:30,634
It's our country.

737
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,734
It's about time
you let that one
go, mate.

738
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,268
You go public with this,
you'll be breaking the law.

739
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:36,767
I'm not going public
with it.

740
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:37,967
I'm gonna tell
a man's family

741
00:38:38,034 --> 00:38:38,967
The truth about
their son.

742
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:40,167
You know what i mean.

743
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,700
You know...
sooner or later

744
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:46,667
You got to stand up
and be counted for
our mistakes, right?

745
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:48,634
Your man, franko,
he went over...

746
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,500
To the taliban.

747
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:51,934
That's a big mistake.

748
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:54,667
But in the end...

749
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:57,034
You know what i mean?

750
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,967
Mr. welsh?

751
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:02,867
Yeah, but what's
going on out here?

Who is it, hon?

Do you mind
if if come in
for a minute?

755
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:09,101
There's a few things
i'd like to tell you

00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,533
About your son,

You shouldn't have had
to see that, em.

I was scared, dad.

I was really scared.

00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,967

to ask you,
beg you really,

785
00:41:07,867 --> 00:41:09,500
Never to do anything
like that again?

No.
