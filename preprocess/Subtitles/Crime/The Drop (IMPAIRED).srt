1121

you put that old biddy at.

1127
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:04,570
That was my stool and
nobody sat on that stool

1128
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:06,027
because it was
Cousin Marv's stool.

1129
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,337

1130

1131

something desperate?

we can't clean up this time?

Give me another shot, will you?

1264
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:45,229
What was the name
of your partner?

1265
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:49,575
Wouldn't be much of a threat if you
knew who he was, would he, Bob?

he helped you kill
Richie Whelan, right?

That's the rumor, Bob.

1269
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,842
More than a rumor.
It's what you said.

1270
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:03,579
Then it's more than a rumor, Bob.
What time is it?

Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

ago, man, he had...</i>

01:24:32,601 --> 01:24:33,944
a problem with the cards.

<font color="#ffff00">ERIC</font>: I didn't know that, Bob.

But he was more of a

1299
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:41,948
And I remember this kid.“

1300
01:24:42,344 --> 01:24:44,790
he was into him for a
shitload of money.

1301
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:48,517
Hopeless case when it came
to the dogs and B-ball.

1302
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:51,221
Just degenerate, really.

1303
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:53,288
Kind of kid who'd never be
able to pay back what he owed.

1304
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:54,967
It's 1:57, all right?

1305
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:57,636
And then the kid goes to A.C.
and he...

1306
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:02,636
hits up a slot machine
for <i>22</i> grand.

1307
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:04,637
<i>Bam.</i>

1308
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,373
<i>Who'd have thunk it?
It was, like,</i>

1309
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:09,541
<i>a fraction move than
what he owed Marv.</i>

1310
01:25:09,805 --> 01:25:11,807
So he didn't pay up and
you roughed him up.

1311
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,042
No, no. That's not
what happened.

1312
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,214
He paid back Marv, every cent.

1313
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:17,980
He was a good guy.

1314
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:19,988
It's 1:58, all right?

1315
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:23,992
What he didn't account for was
Marv skimming off his own stash.

1316
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:26,893
<i>Because of his habits
and his gambling debts.</i>

1317
01:25:27,155 --> 01:25:31,069
And this kid coming out of the
blue with 22 grand was a...

1318
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:32,669
what'd he say?

1319
01:25:33,662 --> 01:25:36,506
"A viable business opportunity."

1320
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:38,842
That's my cousin Marv.

1321
01:25:39,668 --> 01:25:44,014
So long <i>as</i> nobody knew that he'd
paid Marv back off, you know?

1322
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,183
You see where this is going?

1323
01:25:46,842 --> 01:25:48,344
Yeah, kid had to be ripped off.

1324
01:25:48,577 --> 01:25:51,023
No. Kid had to be killed.

1325
01:25:52,581 --> 01:25:55,084
So nobody'd know he'd
paid Marv back off.

1326
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:57,757
So that's what we did.

1327
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,363
Oh, so you...

1328
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:02,929
killed him. Yeah, I did.

1329
01:26:03,525 --> 01:26:05,266
I shot him in the face, twice.

1330
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:07,772
Then I wrapped his
head in a towel

1331
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:09,206
and stabbed him in the heart...

1332
01:26:09,431 --> 01:26:10,808
so he would bleed out,

1333
01:26:10,866 --> 01:26:12,868
put him in my bathtub
and watched him drain.

1334
01:26:13,702 --> 01:26:15,204

No way, my man.
You have friends.

Speaking of friends,
your cousin Marv?

1419

He told me he's retiring. He want
you to be the boss of the bar.

Sure.

Yeah. Had to break his

I don't know yet. I got a shift.

They sold it. To Milligan Development.

Condos with stained

Eric Deeds.

I mentioned him to you once.

I remember you mentioning him.

01:37:16,964 --> 01:37:20,309
He was in this bar Super Bowl Sunday.
You see him'?

1472
01:37:20,535 --> 01:37:23,175
No. There was a lot
of people in here

1473
01:37:23,271 --> 01:37:24,716
on Super Bowl Sunday, so...

1474
01:37:25,473 --> 01:37:26,816
Yeah, that's true.

1475
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:31,380
It's just this was the last place
he was ever seen and then...

1476
01:37:31,813 --> 01:37:33,383
Just like Richie Whelan.

<i>Mmm.</i>

1478

Ironic, 'cause Deeds
supposedly killed Whelan.

1483

People do all the time.

1484
01:37:56,003 --> 01:37:59,507
That's true. If he does, it'll
probably be in a psych ward.

I'm not lying. It's true.

Deeds always took credit for the Whelan
hit 'cause nobody else wanted to.

1488
01:38:12,353 --> 01:38:14,594
He thought it would
help his street cred...
