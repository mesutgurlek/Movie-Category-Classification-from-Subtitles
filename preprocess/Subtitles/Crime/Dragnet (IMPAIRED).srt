25th Anniversary double issue of Bait.

- Bait.
- That's his skin magazine.

The intelligent subscriber regards it...

socially-impacted monthly.

No. No, they don't, Miss Wiss.

Let me tell you something.

246
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:43,518
There are two things which differentiate
the human species from animals.

247
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:47,202
One, we use cutlery.
Two, we can control our sexual urges.

248
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:51,599
You might be an exception, but don't
drag me into your private hell.

249
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:56,245
You've got a lot
of repressed feelings, don't you?

250
00:16:56,327 --> 00:16:59,080
Must be what keeps your hair up.

251
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:13,040
- What is bothering you besides me?
- l'm thinking about those Pagans.

252
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:17,040
lf all they were after was revenge
against Caesar, it's slime versus slime.

253
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:21,643
But when they attack great institutions
like our city zoo, my hackles turn red.

254
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:24,958
You'll lose those red hackles
if you eat those chili dogs.

255
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:26,560

They're the worst thing for you.
Filled with nitrates, toxins, poisons.

257
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,198
And you're doubling up on them.

258
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:36,041
Mister, outside of cigarettes
l only have one vice: chili dogs.

So pipe down and let me
enjoy my lunch in peace.

and bug excrement?

263
00:17:57,087 --> 00:18:01,399
Except for you and canned cling peaches,
l'd be hard-pressed to find anyone...

264
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:04,081

suppose you ever make any of those.

One more thing.

hewn from majestic redwood forests.

277

had been siphoned individually...

from their respective
hijacked tanker cars.

279
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:57,083
We questioned the battered
train engineer, Señor Tito Provencal...

280
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,603
and attempted to determine the precise
identification of the missing gases...

281
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:04,236
from the owner of the
chemicals company, a Mr Roy Grest.

282
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:09,082
Actually trichlornitromethan
and the pseudo-halogenic cyanogen.

283
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,123
Pseudo-halogenic cyanogen.

284
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:14,722
They're shipped in separate containers.
Mixed properly in the exact ratio...

285
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:17,958
they form a liquid fertilizer
that's clear as water.

286
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:20,277
- But you wouldn't want to smell it.
- Why is that?

287
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,518
lt burns the eyes, lungs, and throat,
causes vomiting...

288
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:25,802
and if continuously inhaled, death.

289
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:28,242
Sort of like your aftershave.

00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:16,964
Why don't you listen and learn?

302
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:21,837
What a deep honour it is for this city
that you have chosen Los Angeles...

303
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:26,159
to be the new focal point for
the Moral Advance Movement of America.

304
00:20:26,247 --> 00:20:30,206
lt's quite simple, Jane.

305
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:33,324
lf one wishes to effect a financial
upheaval in this country...

306
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,796
one should set his or her sights
on Wall Street.

307
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:39,436
lf one wishes to revolutionize
the political system...

308
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:42,405
he or she would naturally
go to Washington.

309
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:45,923
But when dealing...

310
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:49,124
with pornography, filth, crime...

311
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,277
degradation...

312
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:54,803
what better place is there to begin with
than Los Angeles...

313
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:58,235
the current capital of depravity...

314
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:01,842
in what sadly passes
for the modern world.

315
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:12,800
[ Friday ]
2:15 p.m.

316
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:17,324
We had been advised to follow up on
a theft at 8823467 Magnolia Boulevard.

317
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,602
At this time of day,
it took us 20 minutes to get there.

318
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:21,598
The complainant was the landlady,
Enid Borden.

319
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:23,678
Some Pagan cards had been found.

320
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:31,321
- What the hell do you want?
- Police officers, ma'am.

321
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:33,398
About time you pencil dicks showed up.

322
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,842
Why couldn't you have gotten here
before that big, bad...

323
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,283
stupid-looking piece of sewage breath
stole my wedding dress?

324
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,927
Sewage breath would be
your nickname for--

325
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:43,486
Muzz. Emil Muzz.

326
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,762
Not much of an improvement.

327
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:51,001
That ass-wipe also stiffed me for two
months' rent when his cheque bounced.

328
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:53,157
Goddam puss-faced pimp stick.

329
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:55,442
All that was left in his room...

330
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:57,722
was a big box of these things.

331
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:05,484
Any idea where Emil Muzz could be now?
Friends? Family?

332
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:08,923
He was a loner.
Took off in the middle of the night.

333
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:11,043
Useless scum-lapping shitbag.

334
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:13,243
Just the facts, ma'am.
He leave anything else behind?

335
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:16,956
Yeah, a tape deck which l had to sell
to make up for the lost rent.

336
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:20,881
So there's nothing you can do about it,
you slimy little jizz bucket.

337
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:25,006
Yes, ma'am. Although you could be cited
for swearing at us.

338
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:26,998
Says who, flathead?

339
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:30,875
The California penal code 314.1
covering obscene conduct in public.

340
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:32,320
Good enough for you?

341
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:35,797
Them magazines and papers
were his down in the trash.

342
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,798
No cheques or money. l looked.

343
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:40,117
l should've thrown it in the river
the day he left...

344
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:43,483
but unlike some people,
l have a heart, goddam it!

345
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,797
That miserable bag of puke.

346
00:22:48,087 --> 00:22:51,443
l think we're finished here,
don't you, Detective Streebek?

347
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:56,399
Didn't she say she threw
some of his stuff in the trash?

348
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:59,320
There it goes. Let's roll.

349
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:15,796
Am l glad l got transferred
into Robbery-Homicide!

350
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:19,243
You can almost reach out
and touch the tension.

351
00:23:19,327 --> 00:23:21,966
What the hell was that?

352
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:23,878
lt has its days.

353
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:26,037
Yeah. Like today.

354
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:30,643
Sitting in a park, getting eaten
by ducks, sifting through garbage.

355
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:34,402
Hello! Photographs of people.
Kinda faded.

356
00:23:34,487 --> 00:23:37,638
- Maybe one of them's Muzz.
- We couldn't be that lucky.

357
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:43,286
Hey, phone number.
Think it means something?

358
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:46,677
There's only one way to find out,
isn't there?

359
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:54,242
lt's for you. The president.

360
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:09,481
lt's ringing.

361
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:16,000
- Good afternoon. Caesar residence.
- Bingo.

362
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,647
- Hello. May l help you?
- Emil Muzz, please.

363
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:22,037
- He's not here right now.
- This is Sergeant Friday, L.A.P.D.

364
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,083
Could you tell us where he is?

365
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:26,761
He's Mr Caesar's driver...

366
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:30,920
and Mr Caesar's sailing on his yacht.

367
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:33,077
That's it.
The limousine from the mansion.

368
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:34,885
Yeah, and Emil Muzz.

369
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:37,435
Let's check Enid Borden's description.

370
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:39,245
Well...

371
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:41,477
''Big, bad, stupid-looking.''

372
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,159
An exact match.

373
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:58,398
Police officers. Emil Muzz?

374
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:04,916
We need to ask you
a few questions.

375
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:06,884
Blow it out your pants, cop.

376
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:09,879
Good, Muzz.
Give yourself a hard time.

377
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:19,319
l'll drive!

378
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:43,598
- What are you doing?
- Calling for backup.

379
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:46,485
- Why?
- There are regulations for pursuit.

380
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:50,037
- We're gonna follow every one of them.
- Forget it. This is our collar.

381
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:52,083
- Our collar, huh?
- l think so.

382
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,317
Let me tell you something,
Mr Lone Wolf.

383
00:25:54,407 --> 00:25:58,002
The dedicated people of the Los Angeles
Police Department are one big family...

384
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:00,681
from my brother, the traffic cop,
to my sister, the metre maid.

385
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,237
And when one of us makes a collar,
we all make a collar.

386
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:07,717
Are you on any medication that as
your partner l should be made aware of?

387
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:10,879
2-King-14.
l am requesting a backup--

388
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,926
Oh, no! Ahh!

389
00:26:32,847 --> 00:26:33,916
Look out!

390
00:26:48,127 --> 00:26:49,526
Look out! Muppets.

391
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:12,843
Reckless endangerment of human life,
wilful disregard of private property--

392
00:27:12,927 --> 00:27:16,442
- He's really racking up the violations.
- Not him, you!

393
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:19,917
Your ticket back to civilian life, Mr
l-Like-To-Throw-The-Book-Out-The-Window.

394
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:21,645
That's a good idea.

395
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:30,559
Ever been to Hawaii?

396
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:43,517
Look out!

397
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:52,884
Surf's up, but not for you.

398
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:56,118
You'll be hanging 10 downtown.
Read him his rights.

399
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,198
Emil Muzz, guess what!

400
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:00,278
You are under arrest!

401
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,315
Sit down, unless you're growing!

402
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:08,319
We've got you on
'87 motre vehicle violations.

403
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:11,046
lt's only time before we tie you in
to one of those Pagan jobs.

404
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:13,163
And you stole
your landlady's wedding dress...

405
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:16,478
which is the only endearing thing
about you, so talk to us.

Listen, you public pawn.
My attorney's on his way.

407
00:28:21,727 --> 00:28:24,799
We both know l'll be out
on bail.

408
00:28:24,887 --> 00:28:27,082
So take off these cuffs
and open the door!

409
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:32,116
l wouldn't worry about the door. Scum
who'd represent you would ooze under it.

410
00:28:32,207 --> 00:28:35,836
Joe, why don't you go get
a couple cups of coffee?

411
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:38,566
l could use one.
You want anything?

412
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:42,322
Chewing gum, Snickers bar,
and my attorney, badge kisser!

413
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:59,359
Well, Emil.

4:15 p.m.

420
00:29:28,487 --> 00:29:32,799
By the time l had returned with coffee,
Muzz was singing like Beverly Sills.

421
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:35,845
He had been planning to attend a meeting
that night at the Pagan clubhouse...

422
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:39,044
but he refused to divulge the time
or location of that meeting.

423
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:41,357
Muzz, let's run through it again.

424
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:45,042
You say you're a Pagan, but you work for
Jerry Caesar. That makes you a plant.

425
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:47,641
Make it easy on yourself.
Lead us to the stolen magazines.

426
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:49,797
Jump on this and spin, cop.

427
00:29:49,887 --> 00:29:52,924
l'm not saying another word
until my attorney gets here!

428
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:54,201
Joe...

429
00:29:54,287 --> 00:29:58,565
wouldn't a couple of Danishes
go good with this coffee?

430
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:10,601
At 7:13 p.m., Captain Gannon authorized
us to stake out Muzz's clubhouse...

431
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:13,759
located in the ecologically-balanced
San Gabriel Mountains.

432

When a code-5 authorization for
undercover surveillance is approved...

433

officers proceed to the building
where the department has research...

434
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:25,357
on the precise behaviour and dress
of today's average street gang member.

9:56 p.m.

437
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:38,924
We were issued appropriate apparel
and withdrew from receiving...

438
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:42,682
one distressed
1985 unmarked Ford sedan.

439

lt's right up here, off highway 61!

00:30:46,727 --> 00:30:48,922
Yeah. Probably some
rat-hole roadhouse...

and suck beers all day.

- What was the offence?

- Yeah?

Yeah. Show 'em your card, Muzz, Emil.

l forgot about the snake.
How big did you say it was again?

613
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:38,126
- 30 feet.
- 20 feet.

614
00:44:38,207 --> 00:44:42,598
We'd like to have you come to the crime
scene and visually verify our report.

615
00:44:42,687 --> 00:44:44,598
lf you could call
Commissioner Kirkpatrick...

616
00:44:44,687 --> 00:44:47,884
we believe this incident, because of its
magnitude, is worthy of her attention.

617
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:51,084
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

618
00:44:51,167 --> 00:44:53,283
- Yes, sir.
- Don't ask him that, Captain.

619
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:57,155
- lt's 4:27 a.m., sir.
- He lives for that. lt's in his blood.

620
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:01,676
Thursday, January 8, 5:45 a.m.

621
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:04,804
Having gained Captain Gannon's grudging
agreement to contact the commissioner...

622
00:45:04,887 --> 00:45:07,321
and proceed with us
to the San Gabriel Mountains...

623
00:45:07,407 --> 00:45:11,036
we eventually arrived at the scene
of the previous night's debauchery.

624
00:45:18,447 --> 00:45:21,883
What is this?
Some sort of juvenile cop humour?

625
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:24,527
And where the hell
is this supposed Pagan festival?

626
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:28,236
l can't understand it. There was a huge
screen with Pagan vision written on it.

627
00:45:28,327 --> 00:45:31,603
Yeah! Yeah! This was the hole
that was filled with water.

628
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:35,316
We had to dive in to save the virgin
being eaten by the giant snake.

629
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:38,001
Who are these painted cretins?

630
00:45:38,087 --> 00:45:41,966
- Two of my best men, ma'am.
- That's right. That's right.

631
00:45:42,047 --> 00:45:44,322
They're heading up
the Pagan investigation.

632
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:48,525
They were heading up the investigation.
Now you may consider them off it.

633
00:45:48,607 --> 00:45:51,121
- But, Commissioner?
- Gannon.

634
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,641
What am l going to tell the press?

635
00:45:53,727 --> 00:45:57,083
That now we are investigating
invisible crimes on the word of two...

636
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:58,839
trick-or-treaters?

637
00:45:58,927 --> 00:46:02,078
You are a civilian and probably unaware
the department's ''regs''...

638
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:05,204
authorize us to wear specialized apparel
during a simulation surveillance.

639
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:10,558
- l assume you were once a civilian.
- Yes, ma'am.

640
00:46:10,647 --> 00:46:14,845
lf you do not drop that insubordinate
tone, you'll be one again soon.

641
00:46:17,327 --> 00:46:19,045
Wait a minute, Friday.

642
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:23,007
l've never known you to act this way.

643
00:46:23,087 --> 00:46:26,966
Certainly not the behaviour
your Uncle Joe would have approved of.

644
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:30,039
You know the kind of man he was.

645
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:34,880
l suggest you try to be
a little more like him from now on.

646
00:46:34,967 --> 00:46:36,844
Yeah, sir. l'll try.

647
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:38,882
Good.

648
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:58,562
l'm sorry, Joe.
He's not in any of these.

649
00:46:58,647 --> 00:47:00,638
And l'll never forget his face.

650
00:47:01,647 --> 00:47:06,482
Okay. l guess this officially closes
my end of the investigation.

651
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:13,677
As far as your personal safety
is concerned, l wouldn't worry.

652
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:16,565
That guy's probably
200 miles from here by now.

653
00:47:25,247 --> 00:47:29,445
10:30 a.m. l picked up Streebek at his
sanitationally-questionable commune--

654
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:32,485
his apartment building in the ''come
as you are'' section of Venice Beach.

655
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:48,519
The door was opened
by Police Officer Betsy Blees...

656
00:47:48,607 --> 00:47:52,759
who had dropped by to chat about more
effective methods of law enforcement.

657
00:47:52,847 --> 00:47:55,202
They'd been playing a version
of good-cop, bad-cop.

658
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:59,326
Though l was unable to fathom the rules,
it seemed Streebek had lost this round.

659
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:02,444
Playtime was over...

660
00:48:02,527 --> 00:48:04,995
and it was back to routine duty
for me and Pep Streebek.

661
00:48:05,087 --> 00:48:10,002
Joe, l suddenly got very hungry.
Let's grab some sushi.

662
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:13,875
We're late for our watch already,
and raw tuna isn't my bag.

663
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:34,643
My hat was in that car.

664
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:38,356
- l can tell who reblocked it for you.
- Pagans.

665
00:48:38,447 --> 00:48:39,800
l need coffee.

666
00:48:39,887 --> 00:48:42,401
l know where they serve
the best in town. Come on.

667
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:46,400
¶¶ [ Rock And Roll Playing ]

668
00:49:10,887 --> 00:49:12,320
Ma'am.

669
00:49:21,687 --> 00:49:25,885
l hate to admit it, but for once in your
life you're right. This is good coffee.

670
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:28,083
You should try the French toast.

671
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:30,317
Joe, lend me 20 bucks.

672
00:49:30,407 --> 00:49:33,843
Do l know you long enough
to lend you money? l don't think so.

673
00:49:33,927 --> 00:49:35,758
We've been ordered off the Pagans...

674
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:39,237
but that doesn't mean we can't follow up
on one of their thefts.

675
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:42,637
The trichlornitromethane and
the pseudo-halogenic compound cyanogen.

676
00:49:42,727 --> 00:49:47,482
There's one illegal lab in the city with
the capacity, personnel and equipment...

677
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,637
to mix those two chemicals
into a deadly gas.

678
00:49:49,727 --> 00:49:53,481
Narcotics has been waiting for months to
bust this place. We can do it tonight.

679
00:49:53,567 --> 00:49:56,161
Forget it.
lt's out of our jurisdiction now.

680
00:49:56,247 --> 00:49:59,762
But this won't be a Pagan investigation.
We can bring Narc in on it.

681
00:49:59,847 --> 00:50:04,159
Police work is a matter of us
against them, not ''Mother, may l?''

682
00:50:04,247 --> 00:50:08,081
Hi, Kay. How are you? l could find out
where they set up the lab this week.

683
00:50:08,167 --> 00:50:11,398
- Oh? How?
- By you lending me 20 bucks.

684
00:50:19,127 --> 00:50:23,166
[ Friday ]
6:30 p.m. After witnessing
the gratuitous sex display...

685
00:50:23,247 --> 00:50:26,284
at Streebek's favourite coffeehouse
and an outlay of $50 by me...

686
00:50:26,367 --> 00:50:30,565
to one of his old informants,
l proceeded by Celebrity Cab...

687
00:50:30,647 --> 00:50:33,286
to 3396834 108th Street...

688
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:37,076
an illegal drug lab disguised
as a legitimate place of business.

689
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:39,998
Streebek had gone to seek assistance
from friends...

690
00:50:40,087 --> 00:50:42,840
in the undercover narcotics unit
where he used to work.

691
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:44,758
lt didn't surprise me
that he was late...

692
00:50:44,847 --> 00:50:46,724
even though he knew l was waiting
in a part of town...

693
00:50:46,807 --> 00:50:49,799
where it's not advisable
to stand around whistling.

¶¶ [ Whistling ]

Hey, zipper-head!

696
00:51:00,687 --> 00:51:02,723
Up late tonight, kids?

697
00:51:02,807 --> 00:51:04,684
Let's have one of your smokes.

698
00:51:04,767 --> 00:51:07,122
lt's an unhealthy habit
l don't encourage in others.

699
00:51:07,207 --> 00:51:09,323
Get smart.
Give it up by not taking it up.

700
00:51:09,407 --> 00:51:11,238
Thanks for
the public service announcement.

701
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:14,558
Hand over your money,
and l'll go buy my own smokes.

702
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:17,639
lf you're that strapped for cash,
l'd suggest a part-time job.

703
00:51:17,727 --> 00:51:19,558
How 'bout a paper route?

704
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:21,877
lt builds character.
lt did in my case.

705
00:51:21,967 --> 00:51:25,801
Hey, we're not askin' you
for your money, Ozzie.

706
00:51:25,887 --> 00:51:28,196
- No?
- No.

707
00:51:28,287 --> 00:51:32,963
- Are you threatening me, son?
- [ Hoodlums ] Ooh!

708
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:05,962
And on a school night, too.

709
00:52:24,927 --> 00:52:26,440
Hit the deck!

710
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:02,043
l can't quite place it.

711
00:53:03,407 --> 00:53:04,760
lt tastes like--

712
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:06,360
Milk.

713
00:53:06,447 --> 00:53:09,723
Just like the sign said on the building
before you obliterated it.

714
00:53:09,807 --> 00:53:12,367
Fresh, wholesome milk.

715
00:53:12,447 --> 00:53:14,915
You probably love this stuff,
don't you?

716
00:53:15,007 --> 00:53:17,646
Vitamin D, calcium...

717
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,719
essential for good strong bones
and healthy teeth.

718
00:53:20,807 --> 00:53:24,436
But that's probably all Greek to you,
isn't it, Mr Gingivitis?

719
00:53:27,607 --> 00:53:29,484
7:15 p.m.

720
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:33,560
After explaining to the milk factory
they could not take legal action...

721
00:53:33,647 --> 00:53:35,558
since we had properly obtained
a search warrant...

722
00:53:35,647 --> 00:53:37,478
our apology was
reluctantly accepted...

723
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:40,923
and Streebek and l were on
our way back to Parker Center.

724
00:53:41,007 --> 00:53:43,601
After losing two previous vehicles
we had been issued...

725
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:46,201
the only car the department would
release to us at this point...

726
00:53:46,287 --> 00:53:49,085
was an unmarked 1987 Yugo...

727
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:53,206
a Yugoslavian import donated
as a test vehicle by that country...

728
00:53:53,287 --> 00:53:56,882
and reflecting the cutting edge
of Serbo-Croatian technology.

729
00:54:31,687 --> 00:54:34,724
l've been thinking.
Maybe your informant was right.

730
00:54:34,807 --> 00:54:36,684
Maybe the Pagans anticipated our raid...

731
00:54:36,767 --> 00:54:39,235
and mixed those chemicals
into a deadly gas before we got there.

732
00:54:39,327 --> 00:54:41,887
Nuh-huh.

733
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:44,322
- Friday?
- That's me.

734
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:46,238
What do you like to do for fun?

735
00:54:47,607 --> 00:54:50,360
l'm your partner, and
l don't even know where you live.

736
00:54:50,447 --> 00:54:52,278
That's right, mister, you don't.

737
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:58,284
Streebek, why are you always looking
at your watch?

738
00:54:58,367 --> 00:55:00,198
l'm watching my TV.

739
00:55:00,287 --> 00:55:04,644
You don't like my music, you don't want
to talk, so l'm watching my TV.

740
00:55:04,727 --> 00:55:06,604
We're at the Law and Order
Foundation dinner...

741
00:55:06,687 --> 00:55:10,600
where Los Angeles mayor, Peter Parvin,
is fighting for his political survival.

742
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:14,441
Leading that attack again is
Police Commissioner Jane Kirkpatrick.

743
00:55:14,527 --> 00:55:16,836
Let's hear what she has to say.

744
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:21,398
This rampaging gang of Pagans has made
a mockery of city administration.

745
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:24,445
Vehicles from the fire and police
departments are stolen in daylight.

746
00:55:24,527 --> 00:55:29,647
Deadly toxic chemicals are on the loose.
What next, Mr Mayor?

747
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:31,638
ln my opinion...

748
00:55:31,727 --> 00:55:34,878
Mayor Parvin should consider
the welfare of his constituents...

749
00:55:34,967 --> 00:55:37,162
and do the honourable thing:

750
00:55:37,247 --> 00:55:39,044
Resign now.

751
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:45,038
You know, l think you and the
commissioner would make a cute couple.

752
00:55:45,127 --> 00:55:47,004
You both keep your jaws locked.

753
00:55:47,087 --> 00:55:50,238
Plus you two share
that curious affection for hats.

754
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:52,682
May l remind you that
Commissioner Kirkpatrick...

755
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:55,406
threatened to turn me
into a civilian?

756
00:55:55,487 --> 00:55:58,285
Yeah, l know.
There was a gleam in her eye, though.

757
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:00,039
Put a clamp on it!

758
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:03,085
l have never been elected
to public office.

759
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:07,558
l have always sought the approval
of a somewhat higher power...

760
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:09,080
for my actions.

761
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:12,045
The sad truth...

762
00:56:12,127 --> 00:56:14,766
is that we live here now
in a city...

763
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:18,760
where even a gross pornographer
like Jerry Caesar...

764
00:56:18,847 --> 00:56:21,919
is not immune from lawlessness!

765
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:25,795
With this grim fact in mind...

766
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:29,277
l am relieved to announce tonight...

767
00:56:29,367 --> 00:56:32,677
that even Mr Caesar himself
has bravely decided...

768
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:35,679
to strike a blow in our common fight
against crime!

769
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,644
Yes, sir! Yes, indeed!

770
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:42,443
This guy knows God personally.
l hear they play racquetball together.

771
00:56:42,527 --> 00:56:45,803
Just chuckle away.
l don't hear God laughing.

772
00:56:45,887 --> 00:56:48,196
You will once He sees your haircut.

773
00:56:49,167 --> 00:56:53,718
My friends, in an unprecedented
gesture of atonement...

774
00:56:53,807 --> 00:56:57,436
Mr Caesar has agreed
to donate the sum...

775
00:56:57,527 --> 00:57:02,123
of $1 million
to my Moral Advance Movement.

776
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:07,884
[ Friday ]
7:52 p.m.

777
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:10,925
After witnessing the raging political
turmoil on Streebek's puny TV...

778
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:14,158
l was really looking forward
to the end of a rotten day.

779
00:57:14,247 --> 00:57:18,445
- Well, want to get something to eat?
- Not tonight. l have plans.

780
00:57:18,527 --> 00:57:21,917
You do? What? What?

781
00:57:22,007 --> 00:57:25,158
Where do you go? What is her name?
Does she have a sister?

782
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:27,317
Good night, Streebek.

783
00:57:29,967 --> 00:57:33,039
Truth is, l don't care where you go.

784
00:57:36,927 --> 00:57:38,963
Yeah, l do.
l gotta know.

785
00:58:05,407 --> 00:58:07,238
l knew it.

786
00:58:07,327 --> 00:58:09,716
lt's Nightmare on Elm Street.

787
00:58:09,807 --> 00:58:13,322
- That would make him Freddie Krueger.
- [ Coyote Howling ]

788
00:58:14,647 --> 00:58:17,036
We're gonna be driving along some night
and the lighting's gonna be bad.

789
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:21,086
He's gonna mistake me for some
pretty coed, and out comes that claw.

790
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:25,285
[ Snarling, Screaming ]

791
00:58:26,327 --> 00:58:28,283
170 pounds of ground chuck.

792
00:58:30,847 --> 00:58:35,716
Who knows what kind of thrill-seeking
hose monster he's got stashed in there?

793
00:58:42,207 --> 00:58:45,643
My God, he's dating Mother Goose!
Hey, Joe!

794
00:58:45,727 --> 00:58:48,844
Streebek, what are you doing here?

795
00:58:48,927 --> 00:58:52,158
- Who is this nice-looking young man?
- He's nobody.

796
00:58:52,247 --> 00:58:53,965
My partner.

797
00:58:54,047 --> 00:58:57,005
Streebek, introduce yourself
to my grandmother, quickly.

798
00:58:57,087 --> 00:59:00,523
Well, what a pleasant surprise.

799
00:59:00,607 --> 00:59:02,438
Granny Friday.

800
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:05,883
She's my maternal grandmother.
Her name is Mundy.

801
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:10,278
Why don't we discuss this over dinner?
lt's my birthday.

802
00:59:10,367 --> 00:59:14,440
We're going to the Brown Derby.
Do join us, Detective Swayback.

803
00:59:14,527 --> 00:59:16,358
- Streebek.
- Pep.

804
00:59:16,447 --> 00:59:18,358
l don't think it's a good idea.

805
00:59:19,087 --> 00:59:21,806
- Why not, Joe?
- Yeah, Joe, why not?

806
00:59:21,887 --> 00:59:27,007
l've invited someone already
to join us, and you don't know her.

807
00:59:27,087 --> 00:59:28,361
- Her?
- Her?

808
00:59:28,447 --> 00:59:31,519
Joe! You have a date?

809
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:38,875
l'm so proud!

810
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:45,477
Well, it looks like
l have a date, too.

811
00:59:45,567 --> 00:59:48,559
Granny Mundy, may l escort you
to Joe's car?

812
00:59:48,647 --> 00:59:52,003
l'd be privileged,
Detective Startrek.

813
00:59:55,927 --> 00:59:59,886
9:00 p.m. Exactly one night after
witnessing the satanic cult rally...

814
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:04,279
l escorted my grandmother to her
favourite restaurant, the Brown Derby.

815
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:08,997
There was someone l wanted her to meet,
and it wasn't Detective Streebek.

816
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:11,396
Sergeant Friday, your table is ready.

817
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:14,206
l took the liberty of pouring
the Dom Perignon.

818
01:00:14,287 --> 01:00:15,686
What Dom Perignon?

819
01:00:15,767 --> 01:00:19,840
l stopped and phoned in an order
in honour of Granny Mundy's birthday.

820
01:00:19,927 --> 01:00:22,839
You'd want her to have
the most expensive kind, wouldn't you?

821
01:00:22,927 --> 01:00:26,761
What a thoughtful gesture!
Don't you think so, Joe?

822
01:00:26,847 --> 01:00:30,044
Yes, Granny.
lt was very considerate of him.

823
01:00:38,887 --> 01:00:42,118
Hello, Joe.
Guess l'm early.

824
01:00:42,207 --> 01:00:44,038
l was kind of excited.

825
01:00:44,127 --> 01:00:46,118
You sly minx!

826
01:00:47,767 --> 01:00:50,486
l'd like you to meet my maternal
grandmother, Mrs. Grace Mundy.

827
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:52,478
Granny, this is
the virgin Connie Swail.

828
01:00:54,367 --> 01:00:55,720
You're kidding?

829
01:00:55,807 --> 01:00:57,638
Hi.

830
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:01,276
Well, allow me.
The place of honour for Granny.

831
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:03,597
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

832
01:01:06,047 --> 01:01:08,607
And if l may, a toast.

833
01:01:08,687 --> 01:01:10,086
To Granny Mundy.

834
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:13,239
May you live as long as you want
but never want as long as you live.

835
01:01:15,167 --> 01:01:16,566
Hear! Hear!

836
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:22,275
Ahhh.

837
01:01:22,367 --> 01:01:24,517
This is such a happy restaurant.

838
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,485
Commissioner Kirkpatrick,
how nice to see you again.

839
01:01:27,567 --> 01:01:29,956
Reverend Whirley,
it's a privilege.

840
01:01:32,047 --> 01:01:33,878
An aperitif, perhaps?

841
01:01:33,967 --> 01:01:37,164
l once saw Alan Hale, Jr. in here.

842
01:01:37,247 --> 01:01:40,637
Alan Hale, Jr.! Wow!
''Gilligan, little buddy!''

843
01:01:40,727 --> 01:01:45,323
Don't order anything more expensive than
the Cobb salad. That is an order.

844
01:01:45,407 --> 01:01:48,046
Oh, my God!

845
01:01:48,127 --> 01:01:50,436
- Connie?
- That's him.

846
01:01:50,527 --> 01:01:52,597
That man with the collar.

847
01:01:52,687 --> 01:01:54,518
The Reverend Whirley?

848
01:01:54,607 --> 01:01:57,963
He's the one who kidnapped me
and threw me in that pit...

849
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,117
with that horrible snake.

850
01:02:01,207 --> 01:02:04,040
l'll never forget his face
as long as l live.

851
01:02:04,127 --> 01:02:06,641
You have to be sure about this.

852
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:09,480
How about very, very sure?

853
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:11,842
l'm positive, Joe.

854
01:02:11,927 --> 01:02:13,724
That's him.

855
01:02:13,807 --> 01:02:15,684
The face behind the mask.

856
01:02:17,247 --> 01:02:19,715
The man who tried to kill me.

857
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:25,879
Would you testify to that under oath
in a court of law?

858
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:28,606
Wait a minute. Settle down.

859
01:02:28,687 --> 01:02:31,838
Let's think about this.
That is Jonathan Whirley.

860
01:02:31,927 --> 01:02:35,078
Head of the Moral Advance Movement
of America. He's a public hero.

861
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:38,842
- You can't just walk up to him--
- Streebek.

862
01:02:38,927 --> 01:02:40,997
Vermin aren't allowed
inside restaurants.

863
01:02:41,087 --> 01:02:43,157
l'll be enforcing
the public health code.

864
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,997
lf you'll both excuse me...

865
01:02:47,087 --> 01:02:50,443
l'm afraid
the second-highest duty calls.

866
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:58,877
Joe, he is sitting with the commissioner
and our captain.

867
01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:02,277
Bust him now, tomorrow you'll
be mucking out stalls at Horse Patrol.

868
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,680
Thank you.

869
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:14,000
l am sorry.

870
01:03:14,087 --> 01:03:16,920
Hold it there, Whirley. Police Officer.
You're under arrest.

871
01:03:17,007 --> 01:03:19,316
l beg your pardon?
ls this some sort of feeble joke?

872
01:03:19,407 --> 01:03:24,845
Oh, it's a knee-slapper, if you consider
Penal Codes 484207 A597 and 217...

873
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,600
theft, kidnapping, cruelty to animals,
attempted murder things to laugh about.

874
01:03:27,727 --> 01:03:30,082
l don't know
what you're talking about.

875
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:32,840
My partner and l witnessed
that torchlight picnic you threw.

876
01:03:32,927 --> 01:03:36,442
We're gonna put you where your kind
always ends up: in a 7-by-7 cage...

877
01:03:36,527 --> 01:03:40,679
in some hundred-year-old penitentiary
with a wooden plank for a bed.

878
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:44,077
Sure, this city isn't perfect. We need
a smut-free life for all our citizens.

879
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:46,362
Cleaner streets, better schools,
a good hockey team.

880
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:50,281
But the difference between you and me is
you made the promise, l'm gonna keep it.

881
01:04:03,687 --> 01:04:07,441
Our good reverend's an amazing
piece of work, isn't he, Jane?

882
01:04:07,527 --> 01:04:10,485
- May l call you Jane?
- No.

883
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,237
Captain, Commissioner...

884
01:04:20,327 --> 01:04:23,239
l demand an immediate explanation
for this outrageous behaviour.

885
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:25,363
lt's him again.

886
01:04:25,447 --> 01:04:27,756
Are you insane?

887
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:31,442
Reverend Whirley abducted that girl,
had his men throw her in a pit...

888
01:04:31,527 --> 01:04:34,280
filled with polluted water
and a giant Bolivian jungle snake.

889
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:36,927
These accusations are preposterous!

890
01:04:37,007 --> 01:04:40,636
l beg to differ. Ask him if he remembers
3,000 gallons of stolen...

891
01:04:40,727 --> 01:04:43,605
trichlornitromethane and the
pseudo-halogenic compound cyanogen...

892
01:04:43,687 --> 01:04:45,723
which, when mixed properly,
form a liquid fertilizer that burns...

893
01:04:45,807 --> 01:04:49,197
the throat, eyes, lungs, and nose,
and could cause vomiting and death.

894
01:04:49,287 --> 01:04:51,926
We're just about to eat here!

895
01:04:52,007 --> 01:04:55,682
Reverend Whirley, please accept
our most sincere apologies.

896
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:58,804
Sergeant, you will remove
those handcuffs immediately.

897
01:04:58,887 --> 01:05:01,640
Then you will hand in your badge.
You are relieved from duty.

898
01:05:01,727 --> 01:05:03,206
But-- But--
But, Commissioner--

899
01:05:03,287 --> 01:05:04,720
Now!

900
01:05:06,647 --> 01:05:08,683
Yes, sir. Ma'am.

901
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:11,884
l don't care.
l'm absolutely humiliated.

902
01:05:11,967 --> 01:05:15,846
l know the young man was overzealous,
but he springs from a great tradition.

903
01:05:15,927 --> 01:05:19,078
Commissioner, won't you please
change your mind?

904
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:34,003
l'm afraid l'll have to take
your badge and gun.

905
01:05:34,087 --> 01:05:37,966
- lf we could just please--
- l don't want to discuss it!

906
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,561
Just hand them over.

907
01:06:09,407 --> 01:06:14,242
Look, Joe, don't worry. l'm still
on active duty. l'm building a case.

908
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:16,522
You're building nothin'.

909
01:06:16,607 --> 01:06:20,600
lf l ever hear you've come
within one mile of Reverend Whirley...

910
01:06:20,687 --> 01:06:22,598
l'll have your badge for breakfast!

911
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,679
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

912
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:37,360
lt was very nice of you to try
and take us out to dinner, Joe.

913
01:06:37,447 --> 01:06:41,042
Yeah. Thanks, Joe, for everything.

914
01:06:42,727 --> 01:06:47,437
Let's not stand around here moping.
l'm hungry! Let's go for chili dogs.

915
01:06:47,527 --> 01:06:52,647
Granny, have you ever eaten a chili dog
off the back of a motorcycle?

916
01:06:52,727 --> 01:06:54,558
Not till now.

917
01:06:54,647 --> 01:06:57,957
You smooth-talking son of a gun.

918
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:10,405
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

919
01:07:15,287 --> 01:07:17,960
l'm very sorry
you lost your job, Joe.

920
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:20,242
l really did have
a very good time.

921
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:22,443
l'm glad, Connie.

922
01:07:22,527 --> 01:07:25,439
Now, fasten your seat belt.
l can still effect a citizen's arrest.

923
01:07:25,527 --> 01:07:28,724
l don't want to ruin a wonderful evening
by bringing you in on a misdemeanour.

924
01:07:30,007 --> 01:07:31,759
That was a joke.

925
01:07:32,847 --> 01:07:35,077
Oh.

926
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:51,283
Oh, Joe!

927
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,278
Look at the stars!

928
01:07:53,367 --> 01:07:55,437
Dozens of them.

929
01:07:57,727 --> 01:08:01,766
You know, when l was a little girl...

930
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:04,680
l used to wish upon
a different star every night...

931
01:08:04,767 --> 01:08:08,043
for that special someone to come along.

932
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:10,641
Someone with whom
l could share...

933
01:08:12,647 --> 01:08:14,638
everything.

934
01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:21,316
l guess that's not so unusual.

935
01:08:22,207 --> 01:08:25,643
All girls do that, don't they, Joe?

936
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,241
Some guys do, too, Connie.

937
01:08:31,887 --> 01:08:34,162
- Joe?
- That's me.

938
01:08:35,687 --> 01:08:37,518
Was there ever...

939
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:41,520
anyone else?

940
01:08:41,607 --> 01:08:43,359
Of course there was.

941
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:46,319
Oh.

942
01:08:46,407 --> 01:08:50,082
Actually, l've only been driving
with Streebek a couple of days.

943
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:53,284
- Before that l was with Frank.
- That's not what l meant.

944
01:09:13,687 --> 01:09:17,839
- [ Banging ]
- [ Screaming ]

945
01:09:17,927 --> 01:09:20,646
Goodness! Earthquake! lt's the big one!

946
01:09:20,727 --> 01:09:22,957
Joe, help!

947
01:09:23,047 --> 01:09:24,605
Request Code 3.
Officer in distress.

948
01:09:24,687 --> 01:09:27,360
Assist officer.
l'll handle this. Calm down.

949
01:09:29,367 --> 01:09:32,996
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Shotgun Pump Clicking ]

950
01:09:33,247 --> 01:09:35,886
January 9, 8:37 a.m.

951
01:09:35,967 --> 01:09:38,561
My name's Streebek.
l'm a cop.

952
01:09:38,647 --> 01:09:40,000
l overslept.

953
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:46,638
Curiously enough, l still hadn't heard
from my anal-retentive ex-partner...

954
01:09:46,727 --> 01:09:49,844
although l was sure he'd be proud to
know l was making a concerted effort...

955
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:52,202
to personally develop
a close relationship...

956
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:55,518
with one of my sisters
in the Los Angeles Police Department.

957
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:19,727
l placed a call
to the virgin Connie Swail...

958
01:10:19,807 --> 01:10:22,844
but according to the girl's mother,
she hadn't come home either.

959
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,646
l don't know what to say, Mrs. Swail.

960
01:10:25,727 --> 01:10:28,241
l'm beginning to be concerned myself.

961
01:10:28,327 --> 01:10:32,115
No, Joe Friday has never
stayed out all night, either.

962
01:10:32,207 --> 01:10:35,677
The day he was born,
his mother had him home by 9:00.

963
01:10:35,767 --> 01:10:39,680
Well, let's both stay in touch
in case we hear from them.

964
01:10:39,767 --> 01:10:41,723
Thank you, Mrs. Swail.

965
01:10:44,767 --> 01:10:47,565
Oh, my goodness.
l'm gonna be late for my stake-out.

966
01:10:48,687 --> 01:10:50,598
As enchanting as Robin was...

967
01:10:50,687 --> 01:10:54,521
l still couldn't get my mind off
what happened to Joe Friday.

968
01:10:54,607 --> 01:10:56,802
For one misguided moment...

969
01:10:56,887 --> 01:11:00,084
l actually pictured my ex-partner
introducing that little cupcake...

970
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:04,001
to the one piece of equipment that
wasn't issued to him by the department.

971
01:11:04,087 --> 01:11:08,524
But then l realized Joe would never
spring for the price of a motel room.

972
01:11:08,607 --> 01:11:12,043
And since having sex in a Yugo
was a logistical impossibility...

973
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:15,199
l came to the conclusion
that something must be wrong.

974
01:11:15,287 --> 01:11:16,879
Who cares?

975
01:11:16,967 --> 01:11:18,764
Listen to me, Captain.

976
01:11:18,847 --> 01:11:21,805
Joe Friday was the most dedicated cop
in this city.

977
01:11:21,887 --> 01:11:24,720
Okay, so maybe all his dogs
aren't attached to one leash.

978
01:11:24,807 --> 01:11:27,321
He's thickheaded, insensitive
and reactionary.

979
01:11:27,407 --> 01:11:30,797
And generally less fun to be around
than any person l've ever met.

980
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:33,606
Still, he was my partner.

981
01:11:33,687 --> 01:11:36,042
You want to find Joe Friday?

982
01:11:36,127 --> 01:11:40,040
My advice is to start checking out
the sanitariums.

983
01:11:41,647 --> 01:11:43,478
- Hey, Pep.
- What's shaking?

984
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:45,842
- Hey, you!
- Me, Pep?

985
01:11:46,887 --> 01:11:49,196
Detective Streebek to you.
Let's get this mop trimmed.

986
01:11:49,287 --> 01:11:51,278
Stop shaving with a pocketknife,
and next time you eat your lunch...

987
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:53,198
put it in your stomach,
not on your uniform.

988
01:11:53,287 --> 01:11:56,006
You're a disgrace to this department
and that badge.

989
01:12:11,367 --> 01:12:13,278
You're late, Jerry.

990
01:12:14,887 --> 01:12:19,438
l saw your announcement about my
so-called million-dollar contribution.

991
01:12:19,527 --> 01:12:21,518
Do yourself a favour, friend.

992
01:12:22,767 --> 01:12:24,246
Try the lottery.

993
01:12:24,327 --> 01:12:26,204
The lottery l can fix.

994
01:12:26,287 --> 01:12:28,482
Our problem is Mayor Parvin.

995
01:12:28,567 --> 01:12:32,640
l'm afraid he is not
''going gentle into that good night.''

996
01:12:32,727 --> 01:12:34,080
Say what?

997
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:38,046
That he is not responding
to our pressure to resign.

998
01:12:38,127 --> 01:12:40,687
We're gonna have to push him
over the edge.

999
01:12:40,767 --> 01:12:44,840
Your million-dollar contribution
will insure his presence at your party.

1000
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:49,364
Just make sure he turns into
a drug-crazed idiot, with pictures.

1001
01:12:49,447 --> 01:12:52,086
Once he's politically dead,
Commissioner Kirkpatrick...

1002
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,442
will be a shoo-in to replace him
in the next election.

1003
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:57,837
You and l will split control
of the city.

1004
01:12:57,927 --> 01:12:59,997
You will monopolize all pornography.

1005
01:13:00,087 --> 01:13:03,602
Half the poor dumb sheep in Los Angeles
will be forking over money...

1006
01:13:03,687 --> 01:13:05,643
to buy your sleaze...

1007
01:13:05,727 --> 01:13:08,400
while the other half will be funding me
with the means to fight it.

1008
01:13:09,847 --> 01:13:11,200
Reverend...

1009
01:13:12,327 --> 01:13:14,795
you got balls as big as church bells.

1010
01:13:16,327 --> 01:13:17,806
Thank you.

1011
01:13:33,927 --> 01:13:37,522
Jonathan, l do not trust that man.

1012
01:13:37,607 --> 01:13:40,405
Thank goodness he trusts me.

1013
01:13:40,487 --> 01:13:42,682
That socially-retarded hedonist...

1014
01:13:42,767 --> 01:13:46,077
actually believes he's going
to be alive tomorrow.

1015
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:23,359
Where's Joe Friday?

1016
01:14:36,447 --> 01:14:37,800
lt's no use.

1017
01:14:37,887 --> 01:14:39,718
These knots are too tight.

1018
01:14:39,807 --> 01:14:42,275
Untie the girl.
She's coming with me.

1019
01:14:44,807 --> 01:14:48,880
You hypocrite. lf you were decent,
you'd let her go and kill me instead.

1020
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:50,320
lnstead?

1021
01:14:51,647 --> 01:14:56,516
But, my dear Sergeant Friday,
l'd always planned on killing you.

1022
01:14:56,607 --> 01:14:59,167
How do you see yourself
going down in history?

1023
01:14:59,247 --> 01:15:01,477
Pagan or reverend,
devil or angel?

1024
01:15:01,567 --> 01:15:04,764
Why, both, of course.

1025
01:15:04,847 --> 01:15:07,077
One can't exist without the other.

1026
01:15:07,167 --> 01:15:09,920
Without the Jerry Caesars,
there'd be no moral outrage.

1027
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:12,077
What's the good of moral outrage...

1028
01:15:12,167 --> 01:15:15,239
unless you have something tangible
to direct it against?

1029
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,887
By this time tomorrow,
thanks to that poison gas...

1030
01:15:17,967 --> 01:15:20,561
you've been tracking
like some flu-ridden bloodhound...

1031
01:15:20,647 --> 01:15:24,401
Mr Caesar will be sitting
in that big Jacuzzi in the sky...

1032
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:26,796
and l'll control both sides
of the equation.

1033
01:15:26,887 --> 01:15:30,163
Sure, but like every other psycho
in this city with a foolproof plan...

1034
01:15:30,247 --> 01:15:33,000
you've forgotten you're facing the
finest fighting force ever assembled.

1035
01:15:34,407 --> 01:15:35,760
The lsraelis?

1036
01:15:35,847 --> 01:15:38,486
Try the decent, hardworking
men and women of Los Angeles.

1037
01:15:40,487 --> 01:15:42,682
Forgotten about them?

1038
01:15:42,767 --> 01:15:44,883
My dear Sergeant...

1039
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:48,277
l'm absolutely counting on them.

1040
01:15:50,607 --> 01:15:52,484
- Joe.
- [ Whirley Laughs ]

1041
01:15:52,567 --> 01:15:54,637
Joe?

1042
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:32,319
[ Friday ]
You may have taken a wrong turn,
but there's time to straighten out.

1043
01:16:32,407 --> 01:16:34,602
You're the one that's gonna
straighten out, cop...

1044
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,518
all the way down the mountain.

1045
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:42,120
Let's go, Streebek.

1046
01:17:10,647 --> 01:17:13,115
Just relax and hold on tight.

1047
01:17:13,207 --> 01:17:16,404
Tighter!
Pretend l'm Connie. Ooh!

1048
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:19,919
Look out! Look out!

1049
01:17:24,447 --> 01:17:26,961
There's no road here.

1050
01:17:29,087 --> 01:17:31,442
No road. Look out!

1051
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,483
Look, there's the mayor.

1052
01:17:45,567 --> 01:17:48,320
Pretty clever of Whirley manoeuvring
him up here to Caesar's party.

1053
01:17:48,407 --> 01:17:50,557
He's got both people
he wants to eliminate in one place.

1054
01:17:50,647 --> 01:17:53,957
Hey, isn't that Whirley's car?

1055
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,356
Good evening, Reverend.

1056
01:17:56,447 --> 01:17:58,244
Child.

1057
01:17:58,327 --> 01:18:00,602
l don't see Connie.

1058
01:18:00,687 --> 01:18:04,885
- The next car comes, follow me in.
- Wait. You can't go in there.

1059
01:18:04,967 --> 01:18:08,243
- When did you become Miss Manners?
- First, you don't have a warrant.

1060
01:18:08,327 --> 01:18:11,603
Penal Code 836: A police officer
may make an arrest without a warrant...

1061
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,518
if he believes there's probable cause--

1062
01:18:13,607 --> 01:18:16,360
You're not a police officer any more.

1063
01:18:19,207 --> 01:18:21,846
l hate to be the one to break
that to you, but it's the truth.

1064
01:18:21,927 --> 01:18:24,725
You charge in there now,
you'll never get your badge back.

1065
01:18:24,807 --> 01:18:26,718
Whirley's the only one
