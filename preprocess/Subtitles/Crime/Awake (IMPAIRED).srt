Honestly, he would
want you to tell her.

80
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,969
No, my father would want me

81
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,669
to stop fishing
in the middle of the day

82

00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,577
If he knew what I was doing

I want you to
take a good look around you, Clay.

You own half of this city.

You're creating jobs,
you're saving companies.

filled his shoes, you know?

My dad's feet were four sizes bigger

I can't even fill his socks.

You tell her and, I swear to you,
she'll be happy.

- Well, look, I've got...
- Four. Yes, I know.

109
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,494
All for trying to save people's lives.

110
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,936
It's a disgrace.

Please.

114
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:28,146
It's because they don't know
what to do with their grief.

115
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:32,651
It's because people
need someone to blame.

116
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,916
It's because of patients like you

117
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:40,323
who cannot accept the facts.

118
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,985
Come on in.

119
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,860
Get acquainted. Lie down.

120
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,062
Only because you're my friend.

Get comfortable.

00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,376
How's it feel?

124
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,046
Not so bad.

125
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:13,559
These, Clay, are the facts.

126
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:17,426
When I open up your chest
and remove your heart,

127
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:22,958
it is a very real possibility that you will die
right here on this table.

128
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,903
And if the transplant is successful,

129
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:30,932
there is a 50% chance
that you'll be dead in 10 years.

The clock's ticking.

You think this is a joke?

Look at that.

134
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,290
Hold it.

135
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,758
That's surgical steel.

Imagine what it will be like.

I need you to be ready.

142
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,278
I need you to be prepared.

You get your house
in order, just in case.

and live your life.

Wait, I thought we didn't
have anything until later.

No, Riordan's cabbage
from this morning,

he's in the ICU bleeding.

He took off for
the fucking vineyard,

so, uh... Hey, Clay.

155
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,341
How about letting us
have all your money

156
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,578
so that we could retire?

157
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,587
You wouldn't mind
doing that, would you?

158
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:49,587
No. You know me.

Go ahead, take it all.

No regrets.

164
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,595
[Jack]
The clock's ticking.

165
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,599
[Man]
Jack, what are you doing?

166
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,659
Let's go.
Let's go, Jack.

167
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,204
Come on!

168
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,832
<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>Promise me you'll kiss me all over.</i>

169
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,432
Well, I've got a big
Halloween party tonight,

170
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,444
but how about
I sneak out afterward?

171
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,207
<i>What's wrong with right now?</i>

172
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,679
Well, I can't. I'm...

173
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:19,013
I know it's daylight
and all, but I missed you.

174
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,485
You look beautiful, Sam.

175
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,181
I do?

176
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,087
Yeah, you do.

177
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,456
I should tell you that more often.

178
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,825
What's wrong?

179
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,389
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,526
I didn't know she was going
to be here, all right?

181
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,127
If I turn around, she'll see.

182
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,570
This is getting boring, Clay.

183
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,800
Uh-huh.

184
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,605
We're going to have to
discuss this merger later.

185
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,167
[Sam]
I feel sick.

186
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:50,148
You're not supposed
to make me feel sick.

187
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,945
Thought you'd run off and left me.

188
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,078
You remember Dr. Neyer,
don't you?

189
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,087
Hello, Clayton.

190
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,145
Good to see you again.

191
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,451
We've already been through this.

192
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,425
Dr. Harper's my surgeon.
I've already told you...

193
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,394
I know, but Jonathan
leads the field, remember?

194
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,522
Yeah, well, like I said before,

195
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,566
I have a surgeon.

196
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:11,229
Now, I know he's been
on the donor list for a year, Lilith,

197
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,738
but that's completely
normal for his type.

198
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:18,436
O-negatives like you and your son
always wait a little longer.

199
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,002
It just means
you're special, that's all.

200
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,513
Excuse me.

201
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,345
I don't think you're listening
to what I'm saying...

202
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,714
Although, since he has
a cardiomyopathy

203
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,047
of undetermined etiology...

204
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,020
Hey.

205
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,112
I'm sitting right here.

206
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,590
You want to talk
about me, talk to me.

207
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,127
- Clay.
- It's fine, Lilith.

208
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,460
You and Dr. Harper
have obviously become friends.

209
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,556
He was on call when you had
your first attack.

210
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,430
He saved your life.

211
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,595
I get the attachment. Really, I do.

212
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,936
But your mother and I
have been friends for 15 years.

213
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,498
My hands have been
inside presidents.

214
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:53,944
Don't you think I might at least
deserve the time of day?

215
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,176
You want to be operated on
by the best surgeon possible.

216
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,083
Don't you, Clay?

217
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,415
Good.

218
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,521
Now let's talk about the party tonight.

219
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:08,187
<i>No, no, no, no,</i>
<i>no, no, no, no.</i>

220
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,819
<i>Now see, that is where</i>
<i>you're wrong.</i>

221
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,989
<i>I just don't see</i>
<i>the growth in leadership.</i>

222
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,999
<i>That's why this whole</i>
<i>Beresford Capital business</i>

223
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,193
<i>scares me so much.</i>

224
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,065
<i>Now look, are my numbers</i>
<i>wrong here?</i>

225
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,798
<i>Because if the Shimotomo merger</i>
<i>does not go through soon,</i>

226
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,965
<i>then that entire firm is in a lot of trouble.</i>

227
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,702
<i>[Man 2]</i>
<i>That doesn't matter.</i>

228
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,438
<i>Look, I'm telling you,</i>
<i>Beresford better stay away from Shimotomo.</i>

229
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,740
<i>They're going to smile at your face,</i>

230
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,338
<i>and then they're going</i>
<i>to stab you in the back.</i>

231
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,439
<i>These guys are dangerous.</i>

232
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,983
<i>Trust me, I've seen them do it.</i>

233
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,110
<i>Anybody who gets</i>
<i>into business with them</i>

234
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,654
<i>is really asking for trouble.</i>

235
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:36,916
<i>Clay Beresford better know</i>
<i>what he's doing...</i>

236
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,924
[Woman]
Sir, they need you out there.

237
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,482
Thank you.

238
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,357
Welcome.

239
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,693
My daughter Tanya and my wife.

240
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,199
Happy Halloween.

241
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,276
Oh, here he is.

242
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,679
Whiz kid of Wall Street,

243
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,547
<i>Barron's</i> Man of the Year at 22:

244
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,449
Clayton Beresford, Jr.

245
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,856
Sir, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Inamoto and Mr. Waturi.

246
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,450
They're with our friends
at Shimotomo.

247
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,722
They're here to check up on you.

248
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,922
They know about your condition.

249
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,989
[speaking Japanese]

250
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,100
Mr. Waturi would like for you to know

251
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,900
how much respect he had
for your father,

252
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,099
Mr. Beresford.

253
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,165
He was quite a businessman.

254
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,006
Yes, he was. <i>Arigato.</i>

255

[speaking Japanese]

256
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,177
Mr. Waturi would also like to know
how you're feeling today.

257
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,011
Well, you'll have to tell Mr. Waturi
that I feel fabulous.

258
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,350
[speaking Japanese]

259
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,616
Please also tell him that I'm ready

260
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,214
to cut to the chase
whenever he is.

261
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,223
[speaking Japanese]

262
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,554
In the last eight quarters alone,

263
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,255
we bought and nurtured
over 600 companies.

264
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,061
We donate 80 million
charitable dollars per annum.

265
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,159
We provide over 16,000 jobs.

266
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:01,400
Mr. Waturi, my heart may be weak,
but my mind is strong.

267
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,964
And the only thing
you need to worry about

268
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,976
is which one of our 17 Niigata sakes

269
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,807
you'd like to enjoy with your dinner.

[chuckling]

273
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,895
You're a ridiculous person,
you know that?

274
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,897
I don't know how you say that
with a straight face.

275
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,433
I mean, it's just... it's ridiculous.

276
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,991
I'm serious this time.

277
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,367
Let's just leave
the country, you know?

278
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,201
Go to China.

279
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,740
Try our luck on the black market.

280
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,173
Why don't we just go outside?

281
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,938
We'll grab some random
person off the street,

282
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:39,943
drag them in here, you know...

283
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,309
Sounds good to me.

284
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,179
Drag them in and cut them open.

285
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,912
Hey, whatever it takes, right?

286
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,419
You worry too much,
you know that?

287
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:49,978
Oh.

288
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,648
They'll find me one.

289
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,455
It just takes a little time, that's all.

290
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:58,019
You're not going to like this.

291
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,657
Straight to the king.

292
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,225
Oh, nice hand!

293
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,794
Boat. Jacks over eights.

294
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,068
- Are you kidding me? Again?
- [laughs]

295

Come on, you're my son.

296
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,701
Can't hide anything
from your mother.

297
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,271
I think I need to go upstairs.

298
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,382

301

Yeah, right.

318
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,465

I don't know.

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,172
I saw the way
you were looking at him.

322
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,239
I don't need anyone else.

323
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,047
I got you, Clay. Remember?

324
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,984
So, I closed Lambert today.

325
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,682
That means if we get
a hold of Mecter too,

326
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,123
that's 2,000 new jobs guaranteed,
plus new housing...

327
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,058
Do you remember him, Clay?

328
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,595
I remember bits.

329
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,690
Like what?

330
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,093
He died at Christmas.

331
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,935
Come on, don't you
remember anything else?

332
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,441
Sure, he was wearing a Santa suit,
and he fell down the stairs.

333
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,206
I mean from when he was alive, Clay.

334
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,945
I remember he smiled a lot.

335
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,150
Sorry to interrupt, Mrs. Beresford.

336
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,852
Uh, door was open.

337
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,326
What?

338
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,692
I just need your signature.

339
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,698
I know it's late,
but I want to get this out tonight.

340
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,734
Of course, Sam.
Thank you.

341
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,995
[Sam]
The Edmond "thank yous" are done,

342
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,161
your table's locked for the benefit,

343
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,795
and I put you down for the roast beef.

344
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,066
I know it's your favorite.

345
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,404
You're too good to me, Sam.

346
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:30,441
Well, if that will be all,
I... should be heading home.

347
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,450
- Good night, Mrs. Beresford.
- Night.

348
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,815
Mr. Beresford.

349
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:48,827
Sam!

350
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,861
- Sam.
- I'm tired, all right?

351
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,134
I just want to go home.

352
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,936
Actually, fuck it.

353
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,239
You got me hiding
my engagement ring, Clay.

354
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,143
What is wrong with you?

355
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,407
- Will you come under the umbrella?
- No.

356
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,005
I've been engaged for six months.

357
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,052
No one even knows I'm dating anyone.

358
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,984
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

359
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,044
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,181
If you won't even acknowledge me,
how do l...

361
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,352
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

362
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:19,091
For Christ's sake, Clay,
what are you doing?

363
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,359
You can't be in the rain.

364
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,095
Will you come inside
so we can get warm?

365
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:26,929
But she'll see.

366
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,971
Are you sure?

367
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,378
Unless you'd rather stand in the rain.

368
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,720
I should have done this
a long time ago.

369
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,284
She's not going to like it.

370
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,849
Come on.

371
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,794
I trusted you in my home, Samantha.

372
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,959
How could you come in here
and sneak around?

373
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:56,967
Please.

374
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,298
Clay, she lied to me to my face.

375
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,601
- She's a liar.
- I can't stay here forever.

376
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:03,301
I'm not asking you to.
Just... wait a bit.

377
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,400
Get to know each other first.

378
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,069
We've been together for a year.

379
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,045
Then wait till you're a little older.

380
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,843
How old were you
when you got married?

381
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,315
It's different. I was too young.

382
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,876
Clay, you've got your
whole life ahead of you.

383
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,319
Do I?

384
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,023
If you walk out that door,
you've made your choice.

385
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,457
You're making it for me.

386
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,573
Sam, wait.

387
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,206
Oh... oh, God.

388
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:48,049
Okay. Um...

389
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,452
Nope.

390
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,820
Here we go.

391
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,882
Look what we've got here.

392
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,295
All right, sweetie.

393
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,093
All right. Open up, honey.

394
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,464
You okay?

395
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,467
You okay?

396
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,935
I am so sorry.

397
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:07,199
I just needed to be acknowledged, that's all.

398
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,332
I'm going to go away
and leave you two alone, okay?

399
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,569
Marry me.

400
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,111
What?

401
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,510
Tonight. Right now.

402
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,842
Marry me tonight.

403
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,746
But it's the middle of the night.

404
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,081
I don't want to wait anymore.
We've waited long enough.

405
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,254
[sighs]
Really?

406
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,158
[Jack]
The minister is on his way,

407
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,597
and he's bringing
his wife as a witness.

408
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,067
How the hell did you
pull that one off?

409
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,331
Triple bypass last June.

410
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,997
I'm calling in a favor.

411
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,968
You're a good best man, Jack.

412
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,477
- Thank you.
- Okay, hold on.

413
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,479
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.

414
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,310
- Come on, please! Please, please, please.
- We had this conversation.

415
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,543
Clay, I am pulling
80 hours a week, man.

416
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,984
I've gotta drag these
little moments out any way I can.

417
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,954
Just... Just one, okay?

418
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,717
[laughs]
You gotta take the lens cap off first.

419
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,760
Oh, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

420
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,159
Just one, just one.

421
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,357
Oh, man, look at that.

422
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,162
- An actual smile.
- [shutter clicks]

423
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,834
[sighs]

424
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,337
So proud of you.

425
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,638
[Man]
I, Samantha Jane Lockwood...

426
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,440
I, Samantha Jane Lockwood...

427
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:23,277
take you, Clayton Beresford, Jr...

428
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,874
take you, Clayton Beresford, Jr...

429
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,749
to be my lawful wedded husband...

430
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,187
to be my lawful wedded husband...

431
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,452
to have and to hold...

432
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,517
to have and to hold...

433
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,858
[Minister]
from this night forward...

434
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,693
[Sam]
from this night forward...

435
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,165
for better, for worse...

436
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,031
for better, for worse...

437
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,663
for richer, for poorer...

438
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:49,037
for richer, for poorer...

439
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:52,168
[Minister]
in sickness and in health...

440
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:55,042
[Sam]
in sickness and in health...

441
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:59,346
till death do us part.

442
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,818
till death do us part.

443
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:24,137
Clay.

444
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,234
Clay, whoa!

445
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,710
[laughs]
Whoa!

446
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:27,837
What are you doing?

447
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,676
What do you think I'm doing?

448
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,181
[vibrating]

449
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,877
What is...

450
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,246
Clay.

451
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:39,484
[vibrating continues]

452
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,957
Clay.

453
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,828
They're the only ones with the number.

454
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,888
Holy shit.

455
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:51,825
I love you.

456
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,599
I love you, too.

457
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,396
Here.

458
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,249
There he is.

459
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,789
The man of the hour.

460
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,882
[Jack]
Now, what took you two so long?

461
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,517
Sam, this is Dr. Puttnam.

462
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,891
- Hello.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

463
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:17,894
I've heard a lot about you.

464
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,328
Clay's a lucky man.

465
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,387
I am.

466
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:21,558
[clatter]

467
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,296
Shit. I'm sorry. Sorry.

468
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,467
[Clay]
You'll have to excuse Penny.

469
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,097
She's not from around here.

470
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,335
You walk on the other side
of the road over there, huh, Penny.

471
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,503
Very funny.

472
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,603
Sorry I'm late.

473
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,705
Had a hard time getting a sitter.

474
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,647
Penny Carver. Nice to meet you.

475
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,548
Nice to meet you, too.
Sorry about him.

476
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,644
Oh, it's all right.
We're used to it by now.

477
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,849
So, D.C., gunshot to the head,

478
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,189
O-negative, perfect crossmatch.

479
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,160
Heart will be here in two hours.

480
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:52,060
And your mother's here.

481
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,098
What?

482
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,826
- Wait, she's here?
- Mm-hmm.

483
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,833
What? She's on the call sheet.

484
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,032
You certainly took your time.

Dr. Neyer's performing
this transplant across town.

Would you please clear it
with administration?

Actually, I'm staying right here.

What?

- Hello, Jonathan.
- Jack.

490

You two know each other?

491
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,219
Of course.

492
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,345
Dr. Jack Harper,

493

Head of Cardio
Varick University Medical.

Two mortgages, two ulcers,
two ex-wives.

495

You sound like my ex-wives.

496
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,126
You still fishing
in the East River, Jack?

497
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,293
Well, some of us
just don't have the time

498
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,701
to make it to the North Shore
every weekend.

499
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,672
Clay, this man has three malpractice suits
against him.

500
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,538
Three. I checked.

501
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,509
Four. l...

502

I think it's four, right, Jack?

You think this is funny?

Clayton, this time next year
I'll be Surgeon General.

505

I write textbooks on this procedure.

I sure hope you've read them, Jack.

Will you excuse us for a minute?

511
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,571
Look at me. Look at me.

This isn't about her.

513

I'm not risking your life
on some second-rate doctor.

514
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,241
He's my friend, Mother.

515
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,285
I trust him.

516
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,980
I really wish you'd start trusting me.

517
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,613
I'm sorry, darling.

518
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,089
The answer is no.

519
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,820
I wasn't asking for your permission.

520
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:44,438
All right, I'm going to leave you guys
for a minute, okay?

521
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,307
Thanks, Jack.

522
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,141
Looks nice.

523
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,446
Does it fit?

524

Yeah. It's perfect.

But, hey, you know what?

529
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,092
As soon as you get out of here,

530
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,162
we're going to start from scratch.

531
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,900
Get a little house on the beach.

532

- Mm-hmm.
- Do it right, you know?

533
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:19,409
Chase seagulls.

534
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,571
What do you say?

535
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:27,216
As soon as you get out,
I'll be right here.

536

You think my new heart will love you
as much as my old one?

Okay, lovebirds.

538

We gotta go.

539
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,367
All right.

Sometimes you have to hold the button down

Guys, I'm Dr. Lupin.

Uh, you can call me Larry.

551
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:53,634
I'd shake hands,
but, uh, heh, you know.

552
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:56,105
- Who is this? What's going on?
- I don't know.

553
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,609
Your colleague,
Fitzpatrick, got laryngitis.

554
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,406
They called me up
from Saint Mathew's.

555
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,538
I thought Fitzpatrick
was going to be here.

556
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,082
Yes, me, too, but we have Larry now.

557

The players may have changed,
but the game is still the same.

558

We've been, um,
together a long time.

559
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,021
Sort of like a little family.

560
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,684
This is Dr. Puttnam.

561

I understand.

562
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:18,824
It's a pleasure, Doctor.

563
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,159
How's the patient feeling?

564

Okay.

Just fine, Clay.

Okay, just gonna give you
a little oxygen here.

Yeah.

00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,147
Yeah, there she is.

805
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,749
Thanks, Penny.

806
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,054
Clear.

807
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,596
Look at her. She's a beauty.

808
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,130
He's a lucky man.

809
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,098
Oh, by the way,
I've got two tickets

810
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,863
to the Knicks,
third row, tonight, Penny.

811
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,426
- Any interest?
- No, thanks.

812
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,439
What, is it
too American for you?

813
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:58,169
<i>We're halfway home, Sam.</i>

814
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,235
See where you live?

815
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,835
<i>The new heart's already here.</i>

816
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,904
That's you. Right there.

817
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:05,779
<i>They're gonna put it in soon.</i>

818
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,943
Not that far away from
each other after all,

819
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,953
are we Clay?

820
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,548
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

821
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,721
<i>God, I miss you.</i>

822
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,026
Stay with me.

823
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,127
Just stay.

824
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:27,194
<i>We're almost there, Sam.</i>

825
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:30,264
<i>We're almost there.</i>

826
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,042
[Jack]
How are we doin', Penny?

827
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,409
He's looking good. He's stable.

828
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,072
What about you, Jack?
You wanna go to the Knicks tonight?

829
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,775
It might be good for you
to take the edge off.

830
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,818
I hate the Knicks.

831
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,284
Jesus, what is wrong
with you people?

832
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:43,581
I got third row.

833
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,522
Oh, shit.

834
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:54,759
Levatol, Nalapril, Digoxin.

835
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,965
He likes me to carry them around.

836
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:02,131
If I left it up to him,
he'd be popping 'em like M&Ms.

837
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,607
He could OD on
these things, you know?

838
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,507
Can't say I'll miss them.

839
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:10,605
A lot of cute purses I haven't
been able to use over the last year.

840
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,777
I didn't know you did that,

841
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:19,221
that you carried his meds around.

842
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,426
I tried not to like him.

843
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:30,126
I honestly did.

844
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,068
Lilith, I know
how much he means to you.

845
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,265
What do you want from me, Sam?

846
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:40,744
I want you to tell him
that he's as good as his father.

847
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:45,442
I want you to tell him
that it's okay to love me,

848
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,576
and I want you to tell me
that it's okay to love him back.

849
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:55,421
He's already lost one parent,
he can't lose another.

850
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,120
He needs you.

851
00:39:57,195 --> 00:40:00,653
I'm not a bad person.

852
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,131
I mean, if you could
just give us your blessing...

853
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,694
Okay, just stop talking.

854
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,634
Just make sure
he takes his meds and...

855
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,609
stop talking.

856
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:15,612
What?

857
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,238
He has terrible allergies,
did you know that?

858
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,907
Especially in the spring.

859
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:22,419
Grass and flowers...

860
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:25,115
Don't think this means
I'm going to be visiting every week.

861
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,625
Okay. Okay, let go.

862
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:33,630
All right.

863
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:36,292
Still sleeping like a baby.

864
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,801
Okay, why don't you
take your break, Larry?

865
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,929
We've been at this for a while.

866
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:44,031
They've got a soda machine
in the waiting room.

867
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,668
Really? 'Cause I do
have to make a call.

868
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,905
Sure, go ahead,
you've got at least 20 minutes.

869
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,947
We don't need you for a while.

870
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:50,946
Well, thanks, guys.

871
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:51,947
Sure.

872
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,108
Thanks a lot.

873
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,448
Pickups. Need adrenaline.

874
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,748
Peanut.

875
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,381
Hey, if you need somebody
to go with you tonight,

876
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,255
to the game...

877
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:04,158
Thanks, Larry.

878
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,268
Jack?

879
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,808
What's the matter?
You all right?

880
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:23,304
I don't know if I can do this.

881
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:25,281
What is the problem?

882
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,442
Fitzpatrick is the problem.

883
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,348
He screwed us.

884
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,979
This guy's been watching everything I do.

885
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,784
Oh, come no, Jack. Larry's an idiot.

886
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,324
He doesn't know
what's going on here.

887
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,984
No, it's like he's
been sent here to spy on us.

888
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,392
I think they found out we've been pushing
Clay down the donor list.

889
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:39,395
<i>What?</i>

890
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:40,726
Did you smell his breath, Jack?

891
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,129
He's not a spy, he's a drunk.

892
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,395
He's probably in there right now
in the bar topping himself...

893
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,403
Hey, would you just be quiet?

894
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:47,403
He could be back any second.

895
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:48,803
Okay, then go stand guard.

896
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,740
Go on. Now! And find out
what happened to Fitzpatrick...

897
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:56,011
Hey, Jack, do not get paranoid.

898
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,014
No one knows.

899
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,073
I started this thing,
and I swear to you I will end this.

900
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:01,516
I am not going to jail.

901
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,110
<i>Wait, wait, wait. What?</i>

902
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,711
No one's going to jail.

903
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,417
Look, let's inject the heart, put it in,

904
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:08,516
and end this thing, okay?

905
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:09,958
<i>What the fuck?</i>

906
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,256
Nobody's on to anything.

907
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:12,956
We are in... the... clear.

908
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,658
We're gonna kill this guy,

909
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,700
and then we're gonna go get
a fucking martini, okay?

910
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:19,066
By the time Larry walks back in here,

911
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:21,105
he'll be toes up
on the slab downstairs.

912
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,764
<i>You gotta be fucking kidding me.</i>

913
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,171
He knows something's going on.

914
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:25,937
I just wanna be on bypass
before Larry gets back.

915
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,500
You get no arguments there.

916
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,772
<i>You gotta stand up.</i>

917
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,576
<i>You gotta stand up, Clay.</i>

918
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,277
<i>Take the tape off your eyes</i>
<i>and shit out of your throat,</i>

919
00:42:34,352 --> 00:42:35,478
<i>and wake up.</i>

920
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,952
...is if we suddenly
stopped the procedure.

921
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,852
<i>That's it, there you go.</i>

922
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,390
<i>You can do it.</i>

923
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:43,052
<i>Just open your eyes, Clay.</i>

924
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,187
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

925
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:08,516
[Puttnam]
I'm not doing this by myself.

926
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,019
[gasps]

927
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,022
I'm telling you,
if this thing goes sour,

928
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,183
if this guy looks like he's
figuring something out,

929
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,920
I'm pulling the plug
on this whole thing so quickly.

930
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,086
I'm not kidding, Eugene.

931
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,720
Hey, will you help me
with these stitches, please?

932
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:22,497
[Jack]
I'm too young to go to jail right now.

933
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,330
This ain't even worth it.

934
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:25,369
We're fine, Jack...

935
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,132
<i>All right, now think.</i>

936
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:31,403
Do you know how many
bullshit malpractice lawsuits

937
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:32,943
there are in this country?

938
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:33,977
<i>Think, Clay.</i>

939
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:35,273
Hard-working doctors, that's just...

940
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,938
<i>Look closer.</i>

941
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,606
You know how many I got?

942
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:39,843
- Four.
- Yeah, I know.

943
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:40,941
<i>There's gotta be a way out of this.</i>

944
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,485
All for trying to
save people's lives.

945
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,020
It's a disgrace.

946
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,420
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>
<i>You're gonna be all right.</i>

947
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:50,294
<i>You're not gonna die.</i>

948
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,023
I'm sorry.
They called me out of nowhere.

949
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,725
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

950
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,200
Mm-hmm.

951
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,568
You know what? I'm gonna try
and find out what's going on.

952
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,629
- Yeah.
- Okay?

953
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,539
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

954
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:10,371
Hi. Excuse me.

955
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:12,177
I was wondering
if you knew the status

956
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,343
on the heart transplant patient?

957
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,545
Mr. Beresford?

958
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:17,553
Yeah.

959
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:19,214
I'll call you back.

960
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,281
He's doing just fine.

961
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,656
We're taking
good care of him. Don't worry.

962
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:25,025
Everything's going according to plan.

963
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:29,024
Really?
I just came from there.

964
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:32,335
What is it?

965
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,735
You're not a doctor at this hospital.

966
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:39,105
I mean, you don't work here, do you?

967
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,441
I'm Dr. Larry Lupin.
Pleasure to meet you.

968
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,739
Mr. Beresford's anesthesiologist.

969
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:48,010
Will you excuse me a minute?

970
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:55,581
Fitzpatrick got laryngitis.
They called me in from St. Matthews.

971
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,184
Oh.

972
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:58,626
I thought Fitzpatrick
was gonna be here.

973
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,529
Yes, me, too,
but we have Larry now.

974
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,897
The players may have changed,
but the game is still the same.

975
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:07,404
God, look how fucking obvious.

976
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:10,030
I understand.

977
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,768
This is Dr. Puttnam.

978
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,140
Pleasure. How's the patient doing?

979
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,577
Okay.

980
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,072
Everything all right?

981
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:20,310
I don't get it, Jack.

982
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,217
Why?

983
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,161
Is she asleep?

984
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,494
Oh, no, no. Everything's fine.

985
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,590
Just, um, just give her a kiss for me,

986
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,362
and tell her I'll be home soon.

987
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,700
Good. Thanks.

988
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,865
Say that again.

989
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:43,872
Wife!

990
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,705
What'd I ever do to you?

991
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:50,480
What did she do to you?

992
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:52,880
Huh?

993
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,248
How the fuck
could you do this to us?

994
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,479
[Puttnam]
What are you doing in here?

995
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:59,318
[Sam]
I wanted to see how it was going.

996
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,316
Sam.

997
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,124
How's it going? Is everything okay?

998
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:08,290
Yeah.

999
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:11,267
Sam.

1000
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,700
They're trying to kill me.

1001
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,739
I just had an interesting chat
with some guy named Larry.

1002
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,774
Everything's fine.
You shouldn't be in here.

1003
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:21,369
No, don't trust him, baby.

1004
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,912
He's lying to you.

1005
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,379
Are you sure everything's fine?

1006
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,939
There is nothing wrong.
Everything's under control.

1007
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:28,542
Bullshit.

1008
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,916
What the hell's going on in here?

1009
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,420
That's right. Come on, baby.

1010
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,423
Where the fuck is Fitzpatrick?

1011
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:36,051
I just spoke to him.
He's at home.

1012
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,721
What do you mean, he's at home?

1013
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,286
- He's backing out.
- He's backing out?

1014
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,298
What?

1015
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:43,298
He can't back out.

1016
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,891
Do you want me to call him back?

1017
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,527
No, he's an idiot.

1018
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:49,300
We'll deal with him later.

1019
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,898
What about this Larry guy?
Does he have a clue?

1020
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,841
None. What about her?

1021
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,105
Are you kidding?

1022
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,204
She's ready to adopt me.
Everything's fine.

1023
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,280
Everything is fine, right?

1024
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:07,483
Right?

1025
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:12,659
Jack, you okay?

1026
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,894
Jack?

1027
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:19,768
Get her a gown.

1028
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,065
What about Larry?

1029
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,732
I'll watch for him. Just hurry.

1030
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,113
[Penny]
Guys, finish putting him on bypass.

1031
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,279
Jack.

1032
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:44,260
It was my idea, Sam. You know?

1033
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,262
Jesus.

1034
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,390
I can pull the plug if I want to.

1035
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:52,334
Everything is working, Jack.

1036
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:54,030
Okay?

1037
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:55,163
There he is.

1038
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,730
- I got him to marry me.
- The man of the hour.

1039
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,298
The hard part's over.

1040
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,538
[Jack]
This is Dr. Puttnam. Sam.

1041
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,045
Sam, I've heard a lot about you.

1042
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:04,240
[crash]

1043
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:06,306
<i>Christ, they know her.</i>

1044
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:09,012
Sorry, I'm late.
I had a hard time getting a sitter.

1045
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,917
Penny Carver.
Pleasure to meet you.

1046
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,580
Nice to meet you, too.

1047
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,419
Sorry about him.

1048
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:15,891
I'm used to it by now.

1049
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,757
So...

1050
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:21,355
How the hell do they all know her?

1051
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:23,662
[Sam]
We didn't waste a year of our lives

1052
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,601
for nothing, did we, Jack?

1053
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,103
Nobody knows I worked your team.

1054
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:29,139
<i>What?</i>

1055
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:31,003
I changed my name.

1056
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,635
We're clear.
We're totally in the clear.

1057
00:48:33,711 --> 00:48:36,111
[Jack]
Yeah, they're all mine.

1058
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:40,708
Kind of depressing to know that
your whole life can just fit on one wall.

1059
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:42,616
My dream is to one
day fill up this one.

1060
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,621
Jack, you know how much
we owe from the lawsuits.

1061
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,590
The insurance won't cover it.

1062
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:51,526
I can't just kill him, Sam.

1063
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,496
This is our only way out.

1064
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,931
Without this money, we're finished.

1065
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:02,700
He has to die.

1066
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,003
I am fucked.

1067
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:06,633
It's just money, Sam.

1068
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,543
I'd rather stay in debt than go to jail.

1069
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,580
Jesus, Jack.

1070
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:12,741
Grow some fucking balls.

1071
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:15,377
Hey, I started this
whole thing, remember?

1072
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:18,183
He landed on my table, I brought you in,

1073
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,688
I brought all y'all in.

1074
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:22,920
It's my choice.

1075
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:25,928
And I wasn't the one that nearly
screwed this whole thing up, was I?

1076
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,122
[Penny]
He's right, you know.

1077
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:29,063
I would've had that ring on my finger

1078
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,065
in two months.

1079
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,533
Really?

1080
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:32,796
Well, if you hadn't got knocked up,

1081
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,134
maybe you would've had
the chance, wouldn't you?

1082
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:37,902
[Jack]
Just go, Penny, all right?

1083
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,212
Jack, think about it.

1084
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:49,275
No more triple shifts.

1085
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:52,379
No more 30-hour days.

1086
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:56,688
Even if we settle the will, we're rich.

1087
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,389
You know what
100 million is four ways?

1088
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:06,233
He's a transplant patient, Jack.

1089
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,737
They all die eventually.

1090
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:12,207
Yeah.

1091
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:14,710
They all die eventually.

1092
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:24,780
Look at me.

1093
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,720
This isn't about her.

1094
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,553
I'm so sorry.

1095
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:31,493
I'm not risking your life
on some second-rate doctor.

1096
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:34,258
He's my friend, Mother. I trust him.

1097
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,993
I really wish
you'd start trusting me.

1098
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:40,695
[Jack]
Quickly. Watch the vein.

1099
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:43,205
All right, it's almost there.

1100
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:45,299
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1101
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,771
I got it.

1102
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:52,213
All right, I need some suction.

1103
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,751
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Please, God, no.

1104
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:57,616
- Just get that side, too.
- Okay.

1105
00:50:57,688 --> 00:50:59,519
Oh, no, please, God.

1106
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,387
No.

1107
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:06,022
Aah!

1108
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,791
[Penny]
It's right here.

1109
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:09,457
Thank you.

1110
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,158
You sure Larry's not close?

1111
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,601
[Penny]
We're fine. Don't worry.

1112
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:14,968
[Puttnam]
We gotta hurry all the same, okay, Jack?

1113
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:16,506
Let's just keep it moving.

1114
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,838
[Jack]
All right, just pass over the new heart.

1115
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,841
What?

1116
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,138
Pass over the new heart.

1117
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:22,838
But we haven't injected it yet.

1118
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,404
Pass it over.

1119
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,507
What are you doing?

1120
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,644
Where's the syringe?

1121
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,880
Give it to me.

1122
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:32,149
Come on.

1123
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,782
Move your fucking hand.

1124
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:38,624
Now, I want you to take this.

1125
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:44,300
Inject the heart,
and put it in the body, okay?

1126
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:50,103
You led us here.

1127
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:52,642
Finish what you started.

1128
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,610
Just do it, Jack.

1129
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,612
Let's get this over with.

1130
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:01,646
Sorry, baby.

1131
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:05,881
He really loved you, Sam.

1132
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,221
He didn't even know me, Jack.

1133
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,318
We never even met.

1134
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:21,363
Wait. Hold on.

1135
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:26,406
Holy shit.

1136
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,446
Oh, holy shit.

1137
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:52,899
Is he okay?

1138
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,234
Is everything okay?

1139
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,432
They wouldn't say.

1140
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,066
You were gone so long.

1141
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:00,075
- I know.
- I started...

1142
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:01,941
I know.

1143
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,674
I'm scared, too.

1144
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:16,123
Hey, guys.

1145
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,558
Survive without me?

1146
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:19,960
So far, so good. Smooth sailing.

1147
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,098
Forceps.

1148
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,998
Oh, you guys are flying.

1149
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:26,627
- Yeah.
- Watch your flow.

1150
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,929
Larry. Larry, Larry.

1151
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:32,771
Look at my eye.

1152
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:35,812
Come on, man. Can you see that?

1153
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,779
Why am I crying, huh?

1154
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:39,577
Something's wrong.

1155
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,778
Larry. Larry, look.

1156
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:45,447
Come on, man. Look at my eye.

1157
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,319
Come on, Larry, look!

1158
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:51,620
[Jack]
Pull it back so I can see...

1159
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:56,264
- Hold on.
- All right, here we are.

1160
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,234
- Okay.
- Clamp that.

1161
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:01,965
- Get me the suction.
- All right.

1162
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:04,234
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1163
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:06,538
Hold on. Hold on.

1164
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:13,475
Yeah. Yeah.
You got it. Come on.

1165
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,383
I'm sorry, I can't
go to the game tonight.

1166
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,387
My old lady and I have a date.

1167
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:24,285
You f...

1168
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,524
[indistinct chatter]

1169
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,657
[Puttnam]
Why don't I give you both tickets?

1170
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,360
- [Lupin] Really?
- [Puttnam] Sure.

1171
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,493
You can take your old lady.

1172
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,196
Make a night of it, go out on the town.

1173
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,641
Something's wrong.

1174
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,701
I can feel that something's wrong.

1175
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,406
What is it?

1176
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,913
I can't just sit here like this.

1177
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:48,145
They should have told us something by now.

1178
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:50,709
- Listen to me.
- No, you don't understand.

1179
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,449
He's not just my son.

1180
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:54,184
I was a kid when I had him.

1181
00:54:54,258 --> 00:54:55,623
He's going to be fine.

1182
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:58,820
We've grown up together.
It's me and him.

1183
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:00,693
He's not going to die.

1184
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:04,791
Not now, not today.

1185
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,199
He's going to live.

1186
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,500
How can you be so sure?

1187
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:11,166
Because he's got too much to live for.

1188
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,775
Well, I've got a big
Halloween party tonight,

1189
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,544
but how about
I sneak out afterward?

1190
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,141
[Sam]
What's wrong with right now?

1191
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:23,652
Well, I can't. I'm...

1192
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,918
I know it's daylight
and all, but I missed you.

1193
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,788
You look beautiful, Sam.

1194
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,327
- I do?
<i>- Look at you.</i>

1195
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:32,362
[Clay]
Yeah, you do.

1196
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,896
I should tell you that more often.

1197
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:36,660
<i>What would the old man</i>
<i>think of you now?</i>

1198
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:41,437
<i>You lost it all, Clay.</i>

1199
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:45,669
<i>Everything he gave you, everything he made,</i>

1200
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,505
<i>it's gone.</i>

1201
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:51,537
<i>You gave it all away.</i>

1202
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:53,742
[Puttnam]
Heart's in.

1203
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:56,308
[Jack]
All right, pressure down.

1204
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:57,751
Pressure down.

1205
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:00,449
Okay, release the clamp.

1206
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:03,254
[Puttnam]
Cross-clamp released.

1207
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,188
Wait a minute.

1208
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:08,389
Wait, wait, wait.
Something's wrong.

1209
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:12,265
Okay, re... re-clamp.

1210
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:13,598
He's... He's fibbing.

1211
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,103
You getting anything?

1212
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:16,969
- Nothing.
- All right, all right.

1213
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,668
Charge paddles n... now.

1214
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,267
Come on. Now, Penny. Hurry.

1215
00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:25,907
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke these things.

1216
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:28,383
It's not good for you.

1217
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:30,215
Especially with your condition.

1218
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:34,053
- My condition?
- Yep.

1219
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:35,591
How do you know
about my condition?

1220
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,388
<i>So many details.</i>

1221
00:56:37,461 --> 00:56:39,554
I know a lot more
about you than you think.

1222
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,428
<i>- I didn't even see.</i>
- Is that a fact?

1223
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:43,932
Of course.

1224
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,765
<i>Christ, I missed everything.</i>

1225
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:50,398
<i>What was I looking at?</i>

1226
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:53,409
Was I looking at you?

1227
00:56:53,477 --> 00:56:56,446
I hope you're happy, Sam.

1228
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,743
And I hope you get what you deserve.

1229
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,840
Got nothing?

1230
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:04,319
- Okay.
- Paddles to 20.

1231
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:06,151
- Amio's running.
- Charge.

1232
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:08,657
- [electrical crackle]
- Charge it again.

1235
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:14,327
Charge it to 40, please.

00:57:14,398 --> 00:57:15,592
- [Penny] Jack.
- Jesus.

1237
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:17,861
[Jack]
Charge it one more time, please.

1238

<i>Don't fight it.</i>

1239
00:57:19,303 --> 00:57:21,771

Just charge it one more time.

1240
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:23,430

Charge.

1241

What?

1243
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,542
<i>- Here we go.</i>
<i>- Tonight. Right now.</i>

1244
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,672
- Marry me.

We're losing him.

[Puttnam]
We gotta get him back on bypass.

[Jack]
No, no, no, not yet.

1248
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:43,086
Just one more time.

[Puttnam]
It's over, Jack. He's done.

1250
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,020
We have to put him back on...

1251
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:47,654
[Jack]
What about the adrenaline?

1252
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:48,857
[Puttnam]
It won't make a difference.

1253
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:51,264
A shot of adrenaline, please.

1254

Please!

Jack.

- Sure there's no air?
- No air.

1258
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,876
I'm looking at it.
There's no air.

1259

[Puttnam]
It's over, Jack.

1260
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,641
Shit.

1261
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:09,811
[Penny]
I'm sorry, Jack.

1262
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:13,823
[Jack]
It's my fault.

1263
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,551
[Puttnam]
No.

1264
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,092
[Jack]
It's my fault.

1265

[Penny]
Jack, come on.

1266
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:21,723
[Jack]
No, it is. It's...

1267
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:24,858
There's gotta be
something I could have done,

1268
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,732
something I could have tried.

1269
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:29,738
Jack, you did everything
you could do.

1270
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:32,036
Did I?

1271
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:34,669
You did all you could do, Jack.

1272
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:37,270
It was a bad heart.

1273
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,009
[machines powering down]

1274
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,716
We should tell the family.

1275
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,482
Any volunteers?

1276
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,289
I'll do it.

1277
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,853
I'm the one that should
be talking to them.

1278
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,934
- I'll go with him.
- Yeah.

1279
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,064
Thank you.

1280
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:17,583
So?

1281
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:19,144
He rejected the heart.

1282
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:24,250
We did everything
we could, but the...

the organ failed, and I am so sorry.

1284

The organ failed?

1285
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:37,534
Yes. It wouldn't respond
to the procedure.

1286
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:40,098
But in cases like this,
it's not uncommon for...

Don't you mean you failed?

1288
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,404
No, we...

1289
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:48,007
we did everything that we could.

1290
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,110
It's just an imperfect procedure.

1291
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:52,417
Say it.

1292
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:53,956
Say what?

1293
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:57,585
I want to hear you say it.
I want to hear you say...

1294
00:59:57,661 --> 01:00:00,289
you failed my son.

1295

It shouldn't have been you.
It should never have been you.

1296

I fucking knew it.

I'm... I'm sorry, Sam.

1298
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:24,010
Um...

1299
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,679
I'm afraid we're going
to need your permission

1300
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,086
to take him off bypass.

1301
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,793
What?

1302

We'll need your permission.

He's alive?

1306
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:45,801
Yes, but his blood's being
pumped by a machine.

1307
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:46,808
He has no heart.

1308
01:00:46,877 --> 01:00:48,902
Then get him another heart.

1309

You don't understand.

1310

His blood type's too rare.

Just wanted to see

Wanted to see how you were doing.

I know it's hard to even think about
anything else right now, but...

You're going to live, Clay.

Think I'll take it from here, Jack.

It's too late.

1341
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:25,752
We did everything we could,
but the body rejected the heart.

1342
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:28,093
Well, I think we solved that problem.

Let's go. Now, Jack.

I don't get it.

You're telling me that you knew?

No, no. Not at first.

1365
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:34,622
I had no idea.

1366
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,564
She did everything right.

1367
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:42,196
And then, she made one little mistake.

1368
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,433
She left her purse in the waiting room.

Only took me a second to put it together.

There was no time.

Well, I might
have to do an autopsy.
