1
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,290
<i>Get the truck in!</i>

2
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,625
<i>Damn it!
I said pull your men back.</i>

3
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,462
I don't want any more casualties.

4
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,331
Get that news crew
behind the line!

5
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,201
- Sir!
- I got men down. I got rumors flying.

6
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,297
What the hell's
going on down here?

7
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,206
We tried the urban assault tank.
SWAT tried the roof.

8
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,506
The guys in there are pros,
and, sir?

9
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,548
- They say they've got a nuke.
- Jesus!

10
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,880
And I'm up for reelection.
What are we gonna do?

11
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,818
Don't worry. We've called in
some pros of our own.

12
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,007
<i>Who the hell are those people?</i>

13
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,331
<i>- Sheriff's department.
- The Reno Sheriff's Department-</i>

14
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:22,898
the finest team of
law enforcement officers ever assembled.

15
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,236
But where the hell's
your commanding officer?

16
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:44,151
Ow. Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

17
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,226
All right, talk to me, people.
What do we got?

18
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,235
Thirty-five civilians on the 40th floor.

19
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,329
Twenty-two Chechnyan separatists,
heavily armed.

20
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,773
They say they got a nuke,
and I don't think they're just whistling "Dixie."

21
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,970
<i>All right, people,
here's how this is gonna go down.</i>

22
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,979
Jones, Garcia,
head into the sewer system...

23
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,413
breach the perimeter of that building
and get that nuke...

24
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,782
- before they flambé half of Washoe County.
- You got it, sir.

25
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,355
Kimball, Johnson,
take up sniper positions, so and so.

26
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,687
- Got it.
- Junior, I want you to shave Miss Acapulco...

27
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,886
<i>- and shave her good.
- All over it, sir!</i>

28
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,462
<i>Wait, hold on, man. How comeJunior
gets to shave Miss Acapulco...</i>

29
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,629
and I got to go down
in the sewers?

30
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,643
Why does he have to shave anybody?

31
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,085
Oh, wow.
I just had the weirdest dream.

32
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,115
You know you're driving, right?

33
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,762
Huh.
Nobody in it.

34
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,592
Is somebody gonna get that?

35
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,537
Damn it!

36
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,160
<i>My favorite thing
about being a cop-</i>

37
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,824
I love it when that perp
get all scared of you.

38
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,833
You draw down on 'em.
They get all scared.

39
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,335
"Oh, she about to kill me.
Don't kill me. Don't kill me."

40
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,372
I love that.

41
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,566
I became a cop because...

42
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,701
my doctors thought it
would be a good idea...

43
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,177
for me to get out of the house.

44
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,341
I feel like I bring a real, uh,
joie de vivre to law enforcement.

45
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,885
For example, my uniform, uh-

46
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,182
I don't wear the regulation uniform. l-

47
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,747
I wear these, uh, shorts.

48
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,726
And I actually had to lobby the sheriff's
department to get to wear these.

49
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,593
Uh, but my argument was,
hey, I'm out there on the streets.

50
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,133
I gotta be able to move
like a cheetah, you know.

51
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,067
A law enforcement cheetah.

52
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,038
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's move! Move! Move!

53
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,870
We got ourselves a 8-14-
armed person on a roof.

54
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,376
I'll tell you right now,
this is it. This is go time.

55
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,039
This is what working for
the Reno Sheriff's Department is all about.

56
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,173
<i>Let's do it, people. Move!</i>

57
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,753
- We got a situation here, Dangle.
- We got a chicken.

58
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,321
<i>- What?
- Chicken situation.</i>

59
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,619
<i>- That's not an 8-14!
- We got it-We got it wrong.</i>

60
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,751
<i>- Who called in the 8-14?
- I did.</i>

61
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,160
- Just chase him into the jacket, and I'll carry him.
- What's an 8-14?

62
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,630
<i>- Armed person on a roof.
- Well-</i>

63
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,760
- I thought a 8-14 was arson.
- No, armed person on a roof.

64
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,168
- No, no, no, no.
- Okay, okay, okay.

65
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,973
Stop, chicken! Stop!

66
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,476
<i>- Ah, shit!
- Look out!</i>

67
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,571
I got it. I got him.

68
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,650
- Oh, shit.
- Whoa!

69
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,311
<i>Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!</i>

70
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,615
Chicken!

71
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,656
- No, no!
- I'm just knocking him out, that's all.

72
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,420
- Maybe he'll hold still. We can beat him to death.
- Ready?

73
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,791
Ow! Shit! Whoa!

74
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,864
Can we all shoot
at the same time?

75
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,489
You point and you shoot.
Goddamn.

76
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,591
- Let's shoot at the same time?
- Shoot at the same time.

77
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,761
Okay. That's the only thing that
sort of makes sense.

78
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,896
- One.
- No, I got Dangle's gun. Mine's out too.

79
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,998
- Is yours out?
- Two-And then that way, we-
we'll never know who did it.

80
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,043
Don't start a count
and then stop.

81
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,737
- Oh, sorry.
- Yeah, it's like a execution. Nice.

82
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:54,835
One-

83
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,177
<i>- Sorry. My bad.
- What the fuck?</i>

84
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,183
One, two-

85
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,752
- What? I didn't know-
- Okay, on-

86
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,912
- Okay, on-
- Ah!

87
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,786
- What?
- I'm out.
- Am I out?

88
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,520
Oh, I wasn't out. Sorry.
I thought I was out!

89
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,926
- They fit that little midget guy.
- Aw, he's shittin'.

90
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,692
- Should I call the newspaper and
have 'em come take our picture?
- No!

91
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,290
You do one on both legs.

92
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,733
I have applied, uh...

93
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,771
nine times...

94
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,136
to the Aspen Sheriff's Department.

95
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:26,837
Um, I'll tell you this in-
in, uh, the utmost secrecy.

96
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,813
l-I just don't think I can
do it in this town anymore.

97
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,079
You know, Reno's really a lot
like Mayberry on the TV...

98
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,747
except that everybody's on crystal meth
and prostitution's legal.

99
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,654
Fuck you!

100
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,886
- Ah, morning, gang.
- Morning.

101
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,793
So, the trustees were
up in the ducts all weekend...

102
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:50,028
and there should not be...
too many more squirrels up in there.

103
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,833
So that sound that we were all hearing
should, uh- should be gone.

104
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,238
<i>- I hear it.
- No.</i>

105
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,574
- I knew they didn't get all of'em.
- Want me to get it, Jim?

106
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,148
No more shooting in here.
Have we not been over that?

107
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,877
- Yes. No, we have.
- We don't shoot in here ever, right?

108
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,510
<i>When do we shoot?
When is it okay to shoot in the building?</i>

109
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,714
Never.

110
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,347
- Hey!
- Hmm?

111
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:17,589
<i>Guess what, guys?
We... have... been invited...</i>

112
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,188
to the American Police
Convention in Miami Beach!

113
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,597
- Oh!
- Oh!

114
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,260
<i>- Is this a joke?
- What?</i>

115
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:29,066
<i>- Three days of fun in the sun.
- Why did they invite us?</i>

116
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,235
They invited us this year...
because...

117
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,245
they invited everybody.

118
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,908
- I'll take it.
- So they had to invite us by default. Yes!

119
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,951
Group hugs. Group hugs.

120
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,782
<i>- I'm gonna pass out.
- We get to stay in a hotel and everything?</i>

121
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:47,053
- Yeah.
- We do get to fly first class, right?

122
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,956
<i>Come on.</i>

123
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,961
<i>Flyin'in style!</i>

124
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,794
We, um-
We are not flying-

125
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,246
I'm pooping.

126
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,442
Aah!

127
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,044
- Oh, Christ, I was dreaming.
- Why was your hand on my dick?

128
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,885
I was dreaming that I was driving,
uh, in the Indy 500.

129
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,549
Oh, God! Oh!

130
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,098
- Can we go look at the guns?
- Yes, go look at the guns.

131
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,197
I'm gonna get our passes.
Let's all regroup here in 90 seconds.

132
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,037
Oh, my God.

133
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,077
That's the Aspen Sheriff's Department.

134
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,482
Sheriff Wagner.

135
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,488
- Wrong bar, buddy.
- No, no, s- No, sir. Uh, I apologize.

136
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,490
I'm in my, uh, civilian rig.

137
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,856
<i>- You probably remember me from your-
- Name?</i>

138
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,623
Dangle. Lieutenant, uh, uh, Jim-
uh, James Ron Dangle.

139
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,792
Uh, I sent you my résumé and-and some stats
and a couple of letters of recommendation.

140
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:39,530
- Yeah.
- And, um, about eight or maybe
even nine times actually.

141
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,472
- There were nine.
- Yeah. And you didn't get 'em, I guess.

142
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,806
We got 'em.
Uh, we pass 'em around.

143
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,471
We have a pretty good laugh.

144
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:52,483
I didn't believe you were real.
Here he is, guys.

145
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,021
This Dangle thing, I swear to gosh-
We thought it was a joke.

146
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,989
- I haven't seen one thing-
- Mm-hmm.

147
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,991
- in your file-
- Sure.

148
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,756
that would indicate...
our want of you.

149
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,061
So, thanks.
No, thanks.

150
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,465
- I'd love to change your mind on that.
- No, thanks.

151
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,036
Just want to press the- Okay.

152
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,698
Hi. Yeah, could you step away
from the helicopter, please?

153
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,207
Yeah, ma'am, I was just
explaining how I used to fly these...

154
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,938
- during the Marine Corps back in '82, '85.
- Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

155
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,947
Is there someone above you?
You, can I talk to you?

156
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,778
- There's, um- Is there yelling?
- Who are you?

157
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,853
Hi, I'm, uh, Deputy Assistant
MayorJeff Spoder.

158
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,649
- And you're-
- Hi. LieutenantJim Dangle,
Reno Sheriff's Department.

159
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,224
<i>- Lieutenant Jim Dangle,
Reno Sheriff's Department.
- Is his name in the system?</i>

160
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,520
I did it several times.
He is not in the system.

161
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,222
- Trudy did the reservations, right?
- I will do it again.

162
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,594
- You did a name and city search?
- Or not.

163
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,668
- There's no Reno.
- There is a Reno.

164
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,703
- I am aware that there's a Reno.
- We have an airport.

165
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,740
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Get him!

166
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,468
- Here we go.
- Go and do it, Trudy.

167
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,578
What the fuck?

168
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,944
- I don't like yelling, okay?
- If you won't give us our laminates...

169
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,018
- can we have at least, please,
our hotel room keys?
- We ain't got no place to stay.

170
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,950
- We've been on a bus for days.
- There's no-

171
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,318
- You're not in there for hotel rooms. Sorry.
- Hotel room keys...

172
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,221
are with the registration packets,
the brochures and the laminates.

173
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,226
And give us all of those
right now, please.

174
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,558
You can't have them because
you're not in my system.

175
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,598
- What are we gonna do?
- You know what?

176
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,099
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We don't need these guys.

177
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,102
- No, we don't.
- No.
- Fuck 'em.

178
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,297
- We have each other.
- Well, that wasn't-

179
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,601
- That's not-That's not better.
- No, what I meant is...

180
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,006
we'll go someplace even nicer-
That's what we'll do.

181
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:35,079
<i>Hola.
Scheiße!</i>

182
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,815
<i>- Hi.
- Hello.</i>

183
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,154
- How are you?
- Hello. Good.

184
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,319
How are you?
Welcome to International Inn.

185
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,397
How many of them are you
for my rooms?

186
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,432
Uh, there's eight of us
for your rooms.

187
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,331
Eight. How- How many
rooms do you need? One?

188
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,768
<i>- Uh, we would prefer eight.
- Eight.</i>

189
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,635
Let's go see the entire hotel,
shall we?

190
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,503
- I'll take you on a quick tour.
- Well-

191
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,600
Then you can all get back
to your suck fest.

192
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,441
Uh, A: we're not here for a suck fest,
we're here for the convention.

193
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,641
- There's been a little mix-up, which is why-
- Okay, I like convention "toos."

194
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,116
- Okay.
- Look at me. I'm in a convention.

195
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:10,450
A fucking suck fest convention
here at International Inn.

196
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:15,721
Hey, assholes. More assholes
for your big suck fest tonight.

197
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,657
How's the suck fest going, assholes?

198
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,461
You know the suck fest in here?

199
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:26,095
- How many rooms do you have, Glen?
- I have-

200
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,673
- I have- uh, six rooms.
- Just give us what you have.

201
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,334
- Can we have the keys to those?
- You can have keys to six rooms.

202
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,775
- Okay, gang, and we'll-
- This matches. Grab that one there.

203
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,370
- That's it.
- No, hey. Hey. Hey.

204
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,006
What are you doin'?

205
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,915
This motel is like-

206
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,252
It's like the kind of place you'd come to
if you wanted to get...

207
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,825
a good old-fashioned rapin'...

208
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,158
or a down-home murder.

209
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,391
Okay, gang,
I know we didn't get in.

210
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,900
- Yeah.
- I know we're not stayin'
at the nicest place in town.

211
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,493
But goddamn it,
we're in Miami, people.

212
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:03,041
- We're in "Mee-ami."
- It's true.

213
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,600
This city's got hot
Latin flavor up to its nuts.

214
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,340
Goddamn it. Let's go paint this town red.
Let's do it, huh?

215
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,926
<i>- Hey, bitch, you shut
that kid up, okay?</i>

216
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,534
Thanks for drivin', man.

217
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,763
<i>No problem.</i>

218
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,232
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

219
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,242
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

220
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,285
Take the night off, Joe.

221
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,316
Need some assistance there, ma'am?

222
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,777
- Hey, Clemmy.
- Jimbo.

223
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,109
How ya doin'?

224
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,810
I'm so tired. I just feel like we've been here
for years and years and years already.

225
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,012
Oh. Well.

226
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,487
- Let's go take-
- I need to get some smokes.

227
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,785
Oh, okay.
All right. Okay.

228
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,985
Good night.

229
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,028
<i>Damn.</i>

230
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,528
Hey, bro, check it out.
Candy underpants.

231
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,696
It's a goof. Just a goof.

232
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,371
Hey, Jim.

233
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,417
You want to be a doll
and help me lube up my sunburn?

234
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,082
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

235
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,991
<i>Stop right there
and take it all in.</i>

236
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,563
I got some liquor.
I got some ice.

237
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,564
- I'm not feelin' well, baby.
- Come here. Come here.

238
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,566
- Come here.
- No, Ray-Ray, I'm- I'm-

239
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,795
I'm coming down with something.

240
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,804
Please?

241
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,802
Ooh, that pisses me off.
That pisses me off.

242
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,812
- Hey, Ray.
- Shut up.

243
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:26,408
- Oh! Oh, hey, I'm sorry.
- Stop pushing up on me.

244
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:30,181
I don't appreciate you insinuating
all the time that I am some lesbian.

245
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,588
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you for apologizing.

246
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:38,152
This is, uh-This is Trill.
This is my friend, Sugar.

247
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,164
We're gonna go play
a little ball, aren't we?

248
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,166
We'll see you later.

249
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,998
<i>Come on, ladies.</i>

250
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,300
<i>Oh!</i>

251
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,171
<i>- What's up, girl?
- Mr. Jones, huh?</i>

252
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,335
- Yeah. Yes.
- Mr. Jones.

253
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,073
Why don't you come
give me some sugar?

254
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,672
- Speaking of bushes-
- Whoa!

255
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,809
I don't know
where there's one there.

256
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,080
Get one of these, uh-
Get one of them.

257
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,452
- Huh? Get in a bush and-
- No, l- I'm-

258
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,457
I don't know about that.

259
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,459
Oh.

260
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,997
I'm so sick.

261
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,792
Come on. Come on!

262
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,885

269
00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:41,549
It's open.

270

- Congratulations.
- Um, you have a- a bandage on your teat.

273

For real. Like for real.

274
00:18:56,264 --> 00:18:59,665
- A love bandage.
- No, like a Ace bandage.

Oh, my Go- If I have been stabbed,
I am gonna be so pissed!

277

- Stop the room.
Stop the room from moving, please.
- Hold on. Hold on.

278
00:19:11,113 --> 00:19:15,072
Hold on. Hold on. You have something
on your boob for real. No joke.

- That's him.
- Who?

282
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:29,889
This is the man that's been making sweet,
dirty love to me all night long.

283
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:32,694
Kinda looks like Richard Petty,
the NASCAR guy.

284
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:35,201
<i>- Yeah. You've been making love
with Richard Petty?

I love him.

286
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:39,205
I have to find who this is.

287
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:41,332
- Well, no, we gotta go-
- I have to find who this is.

288
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:43,434
No, we gotta go back
to the convention center, guys.

289

No, you have to go buy me
some cranberry juice...

- They were infected with a toxin
to which we have no antidote.</i>

298
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:17,141
Right. What we need is someone who is
high-ranking in the Miami Beach government.

299
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:19,770
They're all-
Everyone above me, um, is-

300
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:21,815
is stuck in the convention center
right now.

301
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:25,216
You quarantined them in there,
so I'm the acting, uh-

302
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,220
I'm actually-
I'm acting mayor right now.

303
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:30,485
All right, this is
Acting MayorJeff Spoder.

304
00:20:30,592 --> 00:20:33,152
If you need any office supplies,
get some copies made...

305
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:35,593
a stapler,
it's this guy.

306
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:39,064
l-I'd like to coordinate with your, um,
team to a-assess and handle the-

307
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:42,159
I'd love to know where you are at all times
so I can avoid you.

308
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,170
That would be helpful. Now-

309
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:47,469
We have an infectious
contamination in this building.

310
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:51,979
We have quarantined it. We have plus
or minus 2,000 law enforcement officers...

311
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,607
<i>from all over this great
United States of America in there.</i>

312
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:58,379
- 2,130.
- Do we have any police officers at all...

313
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:01,581
outside the confines of this building?

314
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,557
<i>Step up.
Highest ranking officer.</i>

315
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:10,865
<i>Anybody?</i>

316
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:17,764
Jesus Christ.
You're in charge?

317
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:20,933
Sir, yes, sir. Wh-What are-
What are ya-What's going on?

318
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:25,001
All right, right now we got the entire
Miami Beach police force in there.

319
00:21:25,113 --> 00:21:27,877
- Check.
- That means that these streets
right now are unpatrolled.

320
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:30,247
I need every one of you out there...

321
00:21:30,352 --> 00:21:33,287
answering 911 calls,
patrolling the streets.

322
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:36,380
Department of Homeland Security
is gonna be maintaining the perimeter.

323
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:39,790
There is no police force of
any kind outside the building?

324
00:21:39,895 --> 00:21:41,988
How the hell have you
not picked this up yet?

325
00:21:42,097 --> 00:21:44,122
<i>- Go out there, patrol the streets.
- Right.</i>

326
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:48,225
You're the only thing standing
between complete chaos and order.

327
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,236
Check!
We're on it!

328
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:52,533
The Reno Sheriff's Department
at your service, sir!

329
00:21:52,641 --> 00:21:54,268
- Where's the, uh-
- Can we have a map?

330
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:56,310
- Where's the police station?
- Where are we supposed to go?

331
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:06,018
It's all right.
It's all right. I'm here.

332
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:08,021
<i>- Rogers?
- That's me.</i>

333
00:22:11,626 --> 00:22:13,560
Holy shit!

334
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:18,758
Rick Smith, SWAT.

335
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:23,827
<i>They call me "The Condor."</i>

336
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:27,534
I'm sorry I'm late to the barbecue.
I was on a mission when I got the call.

337
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:29,405
<i>Let me ask you a question, people.</i>

338
00:22:29,511 --> 00:22:33,174
What's the difference
between bravery and courage?

339
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:38,241
- Oh, I know. Bravery is something that you do.
- Shh. Shh.

340
00:22:38,353 --> 00:22:41,220
Cour- Sorry.

341
00:22:41,323 --> 00:22:44,383
Bravery is when
you do something dangerous...

342
00:22:44,492 --> 00:22:46,756
and you're not even scared.

343
00:22:46,862 --> 00:22:50,855
Courage is when you're
smart enough to know...

344
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:55,926
<i>you should be scared,
but you do it anyway.</i>

345
00:22:56,037 --> 00:22:57,664
Oh.

346
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:01,198
You will not fail.

347
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:04,301
I will not allow you to fail.

348
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:08,439
Under my watch,
I will not allow you to fail.

349
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,884
As God as my witness,
we will not fail.

350
00:23:12,988 --> 00:23:14,888
Are you with me?

351
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,890
Uh-

352
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,960
- Are you with me?
- Is that-

353
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,962
It's okay. I know what I'm doing.
I know the thing is out of the thing.

354
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:25,624
This can come out.
This stays like this.

355
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:26,826
- Okay.
- Are you with me?

356
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:29,233
- Yes!
- Are you with me?

357
00:23:29,337 --> 00:23:31,669
- Yes!
- How- Okay, the thing.
Okay that came out now for real.

358
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:33,604
Wait. Wait. Wait.

359
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,609
No, it's okay. I got 10 seconds
with these sons of bitches.

360
00:23:36,711 --> 00:23:38,269
- I got 'em.
- Wait a second.

361
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,745
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

362
00:23:42,284 --> 00:23:45,276
Oh, man!
That's how blood splatters.

363
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:51,657
<i>Um, so does that mean
we're back in charge?</i>

364
00:23:52,794 --> 00:23:54,762
Yeah.

365
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:57,988
<i>I scheduled a big Friday meeting.</i>

366
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:34,758
Wow.

Hey, everybody. Everybody-

Supposed to be-

389
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:15,128
Wait a second.
Are we on a street?

Nothin'-
Nothin' to see here.

00:26:27,282 --> 00:26:29,113
It took us 40 minutes to get out.

396
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:31,117
If you would've turned
right on María Buena-

- Oh, shit.
- Hey, look. Look here.

419
00:27:27,008 --> 00:27:29,135
Rule number one for gator-

<i>- Stop!

Not a prey,

One, two, three, four, five,
and then it split to a double.

429
00:27:50,832 --> 00:27:53,426
That mean this gator 50 year old.
He been attacked before.

This is the life.
I am so gla-

439

How did we luck out,

00:28:31,005 --> 00:28:32,905
are dealing with that bio-attack?

441
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:34,907
I don't know.
And guess what?

442
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:36,977
I don't care.
'Cause I'm shaking my shoulders.

443
00:28:37,078 --> 00:28:39,171
- I'm shaking my shoulders.

445
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,713
- Don't hate.
- Don't hate on me.

446
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:46,150
- Don't hate on me. No, she didn't.
- Stop it.

447
00:28:46,254 --> 00:28:48,188
- Yeah.
- Let me get your vernacular
straightened out...

448
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:51,190
'cause I don't want you embarrassing me
in case we meet some people.

449
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:53,783
Okay, so if somebody comes up
to you and they say...

450
00:28:53,895 --> 00:28:56,295
"Hey, Officer,"
what you gonna say back?

451
00:28:56,397 --> 00:28:59,332
<i>- Give it to me.
- No- No, you didn't, bitch!</i>

452
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,239
- So if somebody says, "Hey, how you doin'?"
- Mm-hmm.

453
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,037
You just go, "What up, yo?" Got it?

454
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:11,634
What up, yo, player?

455
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:14,943
See, you keep putting extras on it.
That's-You don't follow instructions.

456
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:18,576
- You just supposed to say exactly
what I told you to say.
- All right, try it again.

457
00:29:18,686 --> 00:29:22,417
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Shut up, nigga.

458
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,031
I did it again.
Ow! Jesus Christ, Ray.

459
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:35,967
- I'm hungry.
- I'm afraid I did a terrible thing.

460
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,970
- What?
- Well, I had to pee...

461
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:40,939
so instead of doing
the whole bathing suit off...

462
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:43,636
I did the- the pull over
and out the side.

463
00:29:43,745 --> 00:29:45,770
Oh, yeah, where you
pull it to the side.

464
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,713
And I think I dribbled a little bit.

465
00:30:00,795 --> 00:30:04,322
<i>¿Coma mi amigo bailar
en el discotheque-o?</i>

466
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:06,366
I don't speak Spanish.

467
00:30:09,804 --> 00:30:11,499
Hey! What the hell? Hey!

468
00:30:11,606 --> 00:30:13,233
Shit! Ow!

469
00:30:30,992 --> 00:30:33,654
How ya doin', guys? Eh?

470
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:35,661
<i>- Uh-
- Who is your little friend?</i>

471
00:30:35,763 --> 00:30:38,527
- We don't know him, sir.
- Uh, we don't know that guy.

472
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:41,261
Oh, you don't know who this is?

473
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:43,269
<i>No, sir.</i>

474
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:45,498
<i>You believe these guys?</i>

475
00:30:45,606 --> 00:30:48,404
Oh! Oh!

476
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:50,841
- I get really sick and tired-
- I don't know you or anybody else-

477
00:30:56,984 --> 00:30:59,282
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

478
00:30:59,387 --> 00:31:00,854
- We don't know him.
- We don't know him.

479
00:31:00,955 --> 00:31:03,185
<i>I'm not a cop. I'm just-
I'm here on vacation, man.</i>

480
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:05,452
- How'd you know Mr. Big?
- We don't know Mr. Big.

481
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,926
- What is your connection to Mr. Big?
- We don't know Mr. Big!

482
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:10,964
- Why are you investigating me?
- We're not- Huh?

483
00:31:11,065 --> 00:31:13,363
Look, you guys are smart guys, right?

484
00:31:13,468 --> 00:31:15,368
<i>- Yeah.
- I know this.</i>

485
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,633
<i>- No. No. We're not.
- All the other cops are
imprisoned in that building.</i>

486
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,573
But you manage to walk the streets.
I don't know how you escaped it.

487
00:31:21,676 --> 00:31:24,372
We didn't-We couldn't get
our passes, sir.

488
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:28,574
You're very smart.

489
00:31:30,418 --> 00:31:33,046
Huh? Huh?
Get my message?

490
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:36,817
Oh! Oh! Man!

491
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:39,654
- Ow! Goddamn!
- Turn it off.

492
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:43,424
Sick fuck! Who brings
a weed whacker on a boat?

493
00:31:44,766 --> 00:31:48,668
You forget you ever see me.

494
00:31:56,944 --> 00:31:58,809
Sheriff's department.

495
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:00,813
I got this tattoo the other day, um...

496
00:32:00,915 --> 00:32:04,248
and I don't know where I got it,
so I'm wondering if I got it here.

497
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:08,015
Why don't you, uh, come back here.
Come take a look at it.

498
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:12,692
Mmm, yeah.

499
00:32:12,794 --> 00:32:15,194
Okay, so, the tattoo's
on the left, right?

500
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:17,230
- Mm-hmm.
- So, I don't know why we're-

501
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:20,494
Well, you know, it's- it's as much
about where it's not, as where it is.

502
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,466
Get a sense here, if I can-

503
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,470
- If I just-
- That's some beautiful work.

504
00:32:24,572 --> 00:32:27,040
Thank you. I'm hoping
you guys can tell me whose it is...

505
00:32:27,141 --> 00:32:29,109
because I'm really in pain here.

506
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,838
Hey! What the fuck?

507
00:32:31,946 --> 00:32:34,437
- Oh. I was-
- Our fucking toilets need snakin' back there.

508
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:36,813
- I don't pay you to play
grab-ass with the clients.
- I was-

509
00:32:36,918 --> 00:32:39,352
She came in and l-
You weren't around, so I was just-

510
00:32:39,454 --> 00:32:41,354
- Snake the fucking toilets.
- Got it.

511
00:32:41,456 --> 00:32:45,187
- See you later, Breen.
- Fucking plumbers, man.

512
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:47,352
- Can I help you?
- What's up?

513
00:32:47,462 --> 00:32:51,865
So, we got a call that there was some
lewd behavior going on on the boardwalk.

514
00:32:51,966 --> 00:32:54,526
Possible prostitution.

515
00:32:54,635 --> 00:32:56,535
Holy shit. Is that Terry?

516
00:32:56,637 --> 00:33:00,164
That's Terry.
That's one of our locals from Reno.

517
00:33:00,274 --> 00:33:02,674
- Terry!
- What?

518
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:05,974
- Hi!
- What the hell?

519
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,980
- What you doin' in Miami?
- What's goin' on?

520
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:09,982
Look at your hair.
That's fun.

521
00:33:10,084 --> 00:33:12,348
- Terry, what are you doin' here?
- What do you mean?

522
00:33:12,453 --> 00:33:14,546
I just flew in on my jet.

523
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:16,646
Terry, what are you-
Did you follow us to Miami?

524
00:33:16,757 --> 00:33:19,157
- Did you know we were coming down here?
- No, I live here.

525
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,160
It's where my house is.
I have 17 houses.

526
00:33:21,262 --> 00:33:22,923
- This is where one of'em is.
- Terry.

527
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,964
What did I do?

528
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:27,432
What-That's what we want to know.
What did you do?

529
00:33:27,535 --> 00:33:29,730
We got a call about lewd
behavior on the boardwalk...

530
00:33:29,837 --> 00:33:33,864
and you the only thing I see around here
that could qualify... as lewd.

531
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:35,875
How is this-
I'm not lewd at all.

532
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:38,343
I don't even know what-
Lube or lewd?

533
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:40,038
- Terry.
- What?

534
00:33:40,147 --> 00:33:42,138
Why are you here,
and what are you doing?

535
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:46,346
I just flew in.
I'm recording an album.

536
00:33:46,454 --> 00:33:48,354
It's called...

537
00:33:48,456 --> 00:33:51,482
<i>Terry: South Bitch: Live:</i>

538
00:33:51,592 --> 00:33:53,822
<i>Fuck You, Dad.</i>

539
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:56,692
And it drops in, uh, 2009.

540
00:33:56,797 --> 00:34:01,496
Terry, when you are here,
you are an ambassador for Reno.

541
00:34:01,602 --> 00:34:04,196
Heavy on the "assador."

542
00:34:04,305 --> 00:34:07,035
South "be-otch."

543
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:09,371
- Knock it off.
- Listen-

544
00:34:09,477 --> 00:34:12,139
- I'm on wheels, yo.
- What are you covered in?

545
00:34:12,246 --> 00:34:15,443
- Ew. Terry.
- What? It's, uh, apple martini and lube.

546
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,745
- Ugh!
- Come on, Terry.

547
00:34:17,852 --> 00:34:19,911
That's not all you on.
What else are you on?

548
00:34:20,021 --> 00:34:22,114
- What else are you on?
- I'm on fucking crack, yo.

549
00:34:24,425 --> 00:34:28,384
The Department of Homeland Security
has supplied us...

550
00:34:28,496 --> 00:34:31,260
<i>with some evidence collected
by themselves and the C.D. C...</i>

<i>from the convention center.</i>

552
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:38,327
<i>And it is ourjob
to put the pieces together.</i>

553
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:40,407
Anyone have a theory?

554
00:34:45,446 --> 00:34:47,710
Oh, my God!

555
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:49,976
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!
- Put it back on!

556
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:51,745
Aaah! Whoo-hoo!

557
00:34:51,852 --> 00:34:53,752
- Oh, God! Oh!
- Come on. Be thorough, guys.

558
00:34:53,854 --> 00:34:55,583
Oh! Aaah!

559
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:00,093
- You got some stunning abs.
- Oh, thank you. You know, I do, uh- I work out.

560
00:35:00,194 --> 00:35:02,059
- Really?
- Uh, a good bit.

561
00:35:02,163 --> 00:35:04,961
- Yeah, you yoga or something?
- I do- I do it all. I do yoga-

562
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:07,091
- You flexible?
- I'm pretty flexible.

563
00:35:07,201 --> 00:35:10,932
The thing is now you want to be sure
when you do it though, to just-

564
00:35:11,038 --> 00:35:13,302
You gotta, uh-
You gotta-

565
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:16,934
What you don't want to do is get-
You want to get the waist up.

566
00:35:17,044 --> 00:35:18,944
Oops.

567
00:35:19,046 --> 00:35:20,707
- Oh.
- Excuse me.

568
00:35:20,815 --> 00:35:23,181
Whoo. Sorry about that.

569
00:35:23,284 --> 00:35:25,809
- All the spicy food up in here in Miami.
- Occupational-

570
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,820
Occupational hazard.

571
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,999
<i>Okay, okay, what have we got?</i>

00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,415
I noticed.

575
00:36:04,525 --> 00:36:06,686
Boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs.

576
00:36:08,396 --> 00:36:10,296
All right. Yeah.

577

Uh-

578
00:36:17,471 --> 00:36:20,235
We gotta clear this beach.
We gotta clear it now. I want good ideas.

579
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:23,435
<i>Let's go. Boom.
What do we got? Williams.</i>

- Come back to me.</i>

581
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,475
- Come back to you. Trudy Wiegel.
- I have an idea, Jim.

582
00:36:32,586 --> 00:36:34,781
- Yeah?
- What about a telephone...

583
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:37,517
that you can actually smell through?

584
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,889
Uh, whale-related. Whale-related.
Clearing the beach ideas.

585
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:41,894
- Not in- Not inventions.
- I have nothing.

586
00:36:41,996 --> 00:36:45,193
- Jim, if you think about it-
- Who gave-Who gave topless a gun?

587
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:48,097
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Oh, no. No. Get down. Get down.

588
00:36:48,202 --> 00:36:53,401
Okay, people, this is how
we're gonna do it. Ready?

589
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:57,739
Here is our-What kind of whale

- Big one?

591
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:01,906
- Black whale.
- A narwhal. A narwhal.

per Travis and Trudy both-</i>

594
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,090
- What'd I do?
- What we're gonna do is-

595
00:37:11,192 --> 00:37:13,490
- Stick your butt in the air.
- we are going to-

596
00:37:13,594 --> 00:37:18,258
- You put your feet on it like
that and then I'll help you.
- get a rather large chainsaw-

597
00:37:18,365 --> 00:37:21,823
- Jonesy! Jonesy!
- We are going to make sushi cuts.

598
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:26,305
- Which is the hand-cut sushi
and which is-when they roll-
- Inside out roll.

599
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:28,398
We're gonna make some crosscuts,
crosscuts, crosscuts.

600
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:33,412
- l- I like California roll.
- Okay, we'll then roll each
individual piece into a channel...

601
00:37:33,514 --> 00:37:36,506
which we dig here to the ocean,
per Travis.

602
00:37:36,617 --> 00:37:39,711
- This is a channel to the ocean.
- We're gonna chainsaw the damn thing?

603
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,119
- Yeah, into little sus-
Which one's the hand-cut rolls?
- No one's paying attention.

604
00:37:43,224 --> 00:37:45,317
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

605
00:37:45,426 --> 00:37:47,986
<i>Let's try and get it.
It's only 15, 20 feet. How hard could it be?</i>

606
00:37:48,095 --> 00:37:50,859
In... five, six, seven, eight.

607
00:37:50,965 --> 00:37:52,865
And-

608
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:56,164
Do it! It's goin'!
She's movin'!

609
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,602
- It's movin'!
- I can feel it!

610
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:08,715
Five, four, three. Hut!

611
00:38:08,816 --> 00:38:10,716
<i>Go, Jonesy! Go!</i>

612
00:38:10,818 --> 00:38:12,479
- Oh!
- Oh. Oh.

613
00:38:12,586 --> 00:38:14,486
Okay, ready, people, on my count.

614
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:18,115
One, two, three!

615
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,660
Oh! Oh! Wait!

616
00:38:21,762 --> 00:38:23,855
Wait!

617
00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:29,731
<i>Get a Wet-Nap, people!</i>

618
00:38:29,837 --> 00:38:33,329
Good God! We got a officer down.
We need a Wet-Nap!

619
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,140
So, when the chips are down
and it's fourth and, uh-

620
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:41,146
- uh, fourth and, uh-
- Goal.

621
00:38:41,248 --> 00:38:43,842
Goal. Who can you count on?
LieutenantJimbo.

622
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:48,411
And... his associates.

623
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:51,320
Who shall remain nameless.
There's too many of them to name at once.

624
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:54,223
- Trudy! Give me a "T."
- No, we- they shall remain nameless.

625
00:38:54,328 --> 00:38:56,558
<i>His associates. Anyway, all right, here we go.
You ready, peeps?</i>

626
00:38:56,664 --> 00:38:59,462
- Yeah.
- Let's do it to it.

627
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:02,468
<i>And- un, deux, trois.</i>

628
00:39:04,104 --> 00:39:06,038
Whoa!

629
00:39:08,008 --> 00:39:11,000
- Go team! Go team! Aaah!
- Ew! Ew! Ew!

630
00:39:11,111 --> 00:39:12,976
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!

631
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,208
<i>Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!</i>

632
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:18,308
<i>[Jeff
You blew up a wha-</i>

633
00:39:18,419 --> 00:39:21,411
<i>You blew up a whale on-
on our- our beaches!</i>

634
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:27,119
There are people
screaming at me now...

635
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:31,358
<i>because you guys have been
screwing everything up!</i>

636
00:39:31,465 --> 00:39:33,524
You bunch of jerk heads!

637
00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:36,569
<i>P. Diddy's boat
is all covered in whale.</i>

638
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,003
And then Shaq's boat,
a piece of... whale-

639
00:39:40,107 --> 00:39:42,940
- Don't touch me!
- Sorry, I was just-

640
00:39:43,043 --> 00:39:47,776
Now, you people-you have to
start acting like this is a crisis!

641
00:39:48,883 --> 00:39:51,579
And you have to get
your stuff together!

642
00:39:51,685 --> 00:39:54,620
You need to strap it down!

643
00:39:54,722 --> 00:39:57,589
<i>And get it together!</i>

644
00:39:57,691 --> 00:40:00,683
<i>Now, I'm gonna go
and listen on my phone...</i>

645
00:40:00,794 --> 00:40:02,694
to get yelled at some more!

646
00:40:02,796 --> 00:40:04,696
So thanks!

647
00:40:08,102 --> 00:40:10,070
- Sorry.
- Bye, Jeff.

648
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:14,436
<i>Okay, guys, nojoke.
You heard littleJeff.</i>

649
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:17,305
We have got to strap it down.

650
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:19,470
<i>- Okay?
- What does that mean?</i>

651
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,174
I have no idea.
But you- He said it specifically.

652
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:25,081
I think it means
we've got to do better.

653
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:33,959
<i>What the fuck, man?</i>

654
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:36,154
<i>- That's what the siren's for.
- You gotta signal.</i>

655
00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:38,254
<i>- You're supposed to signal!
- Use your signal, fuck head!</i>

656
00:40:38,365 --> 00:40:39,832
<i>Fuckin'deaf, dude.</i>

657
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:50,008
<i>We are on a highly classified mission...</i>

658
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:54,444
from Homeland Security delivering
vital materials to Captain Rogers.

659
00:40:54,548 --> 00:40:57,016
E.T.A., 1.5 seconds.

660
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,951
- Whoa. Made it.
- What have we got?

661
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:03,683
- Coffee, sir.
- Here you go. Nice and hot.

662
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:07,386
I asked you for coffee. I didn't say
to make a national emergency out of it.

663
00:41:07,494 --> 00:41:10,463
<i>We still haven't found an antidote.</i>

664
00:41:10,564 --> 00:41:15,365
In 24 hours, I'm gonna have over
2,000 dead law enforcement officers.

665
00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:18,529
Not like you.
Real cops.

666
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,539
<i>If you fuck with me
one more time...</i>

667
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:22,541
I'm gonna fill up a tube sock
with oranges.

668
00:41:22,643 --> 00:41:26,443
I'm gonna beat you till I juice 'em.
Then I'm gonna drink that juice in front of you.

669
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:29,573
And you're gonna beg me, "Why? Why? Why?"
But I won't answer that question.

670
00:41:29,683 --> 00:41:32,675
'Cause you'll know it-
so you'll get your heads out of your asses!

671
00:41:32,786 --> 00:41:34,651
- Get outta here. Go.
- Now.

672
00:41:34,755 --> 00:41:36,416
Louis, coffee.

673
00:41:36,523 --> 00:41:39,390
- What are we doin'?
- I don't know. We tried to do somethin' right.

674
00:41:39,493 --> 00:41:41,518
Right? We give the guy-
Guy wants coffee.

675
00:41:44,298 --> 00:41:46,266
<i>Aaah! Why?</i>

676
00:41:58,746 --> 00:42:00,976
- Oh, shit!
- Come on, man!

677
00:42:01,081 --> 00:42:02,514
- Dang!
- Goddamn it.

678
00:42:02,616 --> 00:42:04,880
You guys are pretty smart, huh?

679
00:42:04,985 --> 00:42:06,247
- No.
- No, we're not.

680
00:42:06,353 --> 00:42:08,878
No, you keep saying that.
No, we're not. We're not smart.

681
00:42:12,393 --> 00:42:14,691
What? Ricky,
what are you doing?

682
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:17,491
<i>- Why you take one of my own, huh?
- We don't know this man.</i>

683
00:42:17,598 --> 00:42:21,796
Why you work against me? Why the three
of you and Mr. Big work against me?

684
00:42:21,902 --> 00:42:23,961
No, we don't-
we don't know him.

685
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:26,471
<i>- I've never seen those men in my life.
- I've never seen him!</i>

686
00:42:26,573 --> 00:42:28,803
- We didn't take him. We don't know him.
- Watch this.

687
00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:32,845
- Why... are you doing this?
- You're gonna light somebody up
on your own fuckin' boat?

688
00:42:32,946 --> 00:42:34,937
That's really, really bright.

689
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:38,143
You came to my daughter's
birthday party!

690
00:42:38,252 --> 00:42:41,016
Bad decision. Guys!

691
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:43,248
You wore a hat
on her birthday party!

692
00:42:43,357 --> 00:42:45,757
Light this piece of"chit" up.

693
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:49,454
Don't light this chicken!
Don't light this chicken!

694
00:42:49,563 --> 00:42:51,087
Come on.
Leave him alone.

695
00:42:51,198 --> 00:42:55,134
- I said piece of"chit," not chicken.
- I'll see you on the other side!

696
00:42:55,235 --> 00:42:58,398
Oh, God. Oh, shit.

697
00:42:59,907 --> 00:43:02,501
- Watch the hat.
- Oh, my God!

698
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:13,753
Oh, my.

699
00:43:13,854 --> 00:43:16,015
Sheriff's department.

700
00:43:16,123 --> 00:43:18,614
I need to know
if you've seen me before...

701
00:43:18,725 --> 00:43:21,819
and if I got this done
at this establishment.

702
00:43:21,929 --> 00:43:23,829
No, ma'am.

703
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:26,126
- Show me the other side.
- No.

704
00:43:26,233 --> 00:43:29,794
- No, it looks-They're twins.
- You got anything down there?

705
00:43:29,903 --> 00:43:32,394
Actually, I have nothing down there.

706
00:43:32,506 --> 00:43:35,270
- Just like a Barbie.
- Hey, hey, hey.

707
00:43:58,866 --> 00:44:01,164
<i>Ow!</i>

708
00:44:01,268 --> 00:44:03,498
Ow!

709
00:44:03,604 --> 00:44:05,538
<i>Ow!</i>

710
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:09,131
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh-

711
00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:11,573
We have received a noise complaint...

712
00:44:11,678 --> 00:44:14,146
at the residence of someone
named Suge Knight?

713
00:44:14,248 --> 00:44:16,876
- 4211. Here we go.
- Suge Knight.

714
00:44:16,984 --> 00:44:19,316
This is a house, huh?

715
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:24,146
<i>Mr. Suge Knight?</i>

716
00:44:24,258 --> 00:44:27,386
- Sheriff's department!
- Sheriff's department!

717
00:44:27,494 --> 00:44:29,689
Mr. Suge Knight!

718
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:40,528
- Shit.
- Hi. Hi. Hi.

719
00:44:40,641 --> 00:44:44,475
Uh, we're gonna need
to find Mr. Suge Knight.

720
00:44:44,578 --> 00:44:47,638
We're gonna need to get
the music turned down, okay?

721
00:44:47,748 --> 00:44:50,911
Uh, ex-excuse me.
Uh, d-do you know a Mr. Suge Knight?

722
00:44:51,018 --> 00:44:52,485
"Soog" Knight. Suge-

723
00:44:52,586 --> 00:44:55,783
Are you Suge?
Are you Suge?

724
00:44:55,889 --> 00:44:59,484
Are you Jay-Z?
Are you any of'em?

725
00:45:00,894 --> 00:45:03,260
- I don't think so.
- Uh, it's his birthday.

726
00:45:03,363 --> 00:45:05,456
- It's Suge Knight's birthday?
- Suge Knight's birthday.

727
00:45:05,566 --> 00:45:08,967
Hey, when are they doing the cake for Suge?
Does anybody know?

728
00:45:09,069 --> 00:45:10,969
Okay, I am standing right here!

729
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:13,733
I am using my outside voice,
and I am very angry right now!

730
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,933
I want the music
turned off right now!

731
00:45:16,043 --> 00:45:17,943
I am so serious,
it's not even funny!

732
00:45:18,045 --> 00:45:20,275
The music goes off right now!

733
00:45:27,621 --> 00:45:29,816
And now that
I have your attention...

734
00:45:33,227 --> 00:45:36,628
we have a special message
for the birthday boy...

735
00:45:39,399 --> 00:45:42,095
from Miami's...

736
00:45:42,202 --> 00:45:45,137
number one strip-o-grams.

737
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:47,139
That's right, birthday boy.

738
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,124
That's right.

739
00:46:39,926 --> 00:46:42,156
Listen.

740
00:46:42,262 --> 00:46:44,355
<i>What?</i>

741
00:46:44,464 --> 00:46:47,797
No phones.
No 911 calls.

742
00:46:47,901 --> 00:46:50,131
- All right.
- It's a city under control, people.

743
00:46:50,237 --> 00:46:53,570
- Wow.
- Reno S.D.

744
00:46:53,674 --> 00:46:57,166
Reno S.D. All right, okay. Okay.

745
00:46:59,246 --> 00:47:01,646
<i>- It's 0200 hours right now.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

746
00:47:01,748 --> 00:47:04,740
I don't think we're any good to this city
unless we get some rest, okay?

747
00:47:04,851 --> 00:47:07,217
Let's take a-
like a hour and a half.

748
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:09,687
We'll regroup here at 0330, okay?

749
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:13,556
Get some rest.
That is an order.

750
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,269
'Cause it's dirty! Yeah!

751
00:47:37,517 --> 00:47:40,850
You need me to hold your drink for you?
It's all right. She's good.

752
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:48,255
Oh! What!

753
00:47:49,996 --> 00:47:51,987
In this corner, we got
our undefeated champ...

754
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:56,593
and in this corner, we got some old,
weird uncle of somebody's and shit.

755
00:47:56,703 --> 00:47:58,568
Yo, man, you need to bring it.

756
00:47:58,672 --> 00:48:01,641
Come on.
You scared?

757
00:48:01,742 --> 00:48:04,575
<i>- Ohh!
- Need security.</i>

758
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,825
<i>Hey, there, Jim.</i>

759
00:48:33,473 --> 00:48:35,532
What do you say?

760
00:48:37,544 --> 00:48:39,535
Trudy, don't cry.

761
00:48:39,646 --> 00:48:41,739
- Oh, God, I'm so humiliated.
- Okay. Oh, God.

762
00:48:41,848 --> 00:48:44,043
Trudy. Trudy, please don't cry.

763
00:48:44,151 --> 00:48:46,051
Jim, I was just hoping that
maybe one time...

764
00:48:46,153 --> 00:48:49,145
- you and I could just sort
of hold each other and-
- I know. I know.

765
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:51,190
Trudy, you know I'm playing
for Visitor, okay?

766
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:53,350
- Mm-hmm. l- I had a hunch.
- You had a hunch?

767
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,758
- Yeah.
- Did you?

768
00:48:58,665 --> 00:49:01,259
Jim, would you just
give me a pity fuck?

769
00:49:25,225 --> 00:49:27,125
I thought that would break.

770
00:49:27,227 --> 00:49:29,127
Okay, here we go.

771
00:49:40,173 --> 00:49:42,073
Okay.

772
00:50:55,849 --> 00:50:59,250
<i>- What the fuck? What the fuck?
There's someone filming us!</i>

773
00:50:59,352 --> 00:51:01,752
- Ow! Ow! Jim. Ow. Ow.
- What? I know.

774
00:51:01,855 --> 00:51:03,755
- It's caught.
- You're caught on one of my pubes.

775
00:51:03,857 --> 00:51:06,121
- My watch. My watch is caught on your pube.
- Ooh. Jim. Ow!

776
00:51:06,226 --> 00:51:08,160
- Don't yank it.
- Well, that's what we get for tryin'.

777
00:51:08,261 --> 00:51:10,161
Don't jiggle.
Please don't- Ow!

778
00:51:10,263 --> 00:51:13,130
I'm trying to get it. Goddamn it!
If you'd hold still, I'd get it loose.

779
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:15,701
- You're caught on a pube.
- I said this was a bad idea.

780
00:51:15,802 --> 00:51:18,464
Well, I'm sorry!
This wasn't my idea to begin with.

781
00:51:18,572 --> 00:51:20,597
Meanwhile, my watch is caught
in your pubes. And I'm sorry.

782
00:51:20,707 --> 00:51:22,470
- Okay, let's do it like a Band-Aid.
- Ready?

783
00:51:22,576 --> 00:51:24,100
- Okay.
- One-

784
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,678
Okay, hold on. Hold on.
Now I'm anticipating.

785
00:51:32,786 --> 00:51:36,051
How did the 911 switchboard
come unplugged?

786
00:51:36,156 --> 00:51:38,818
Because we had to unplug it
to plug in the popcorn maker.

787
00:51:38,925 --> 00:51:40,825
Don't yell-
Don't yell back at me.

788
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,657
I'm not- in no mood
for my own tone of voice, okay?

789
00:51:43,763 --> 00:51:46,425
Sorry. Jim, we got
a lot of missed calls here.

790
00:51:46,533 --> 00:51:50,230
<i>- Ooh, you guys.
- What?</i>

791
00:51:50,337 --> 00:51:56,207
There's a domestic dispute on Brad Pitt
and Angelina Jolie's boat.

792
00:51:56,309 --> 00:51:58,573
No, it's not.

793
00:51:58,678 --> 00:52:00,543
Easy. Got it. Easy, easy.
That's an easy one.

794
00:52:00,647 --> 00:52:02,274
Done. Done, done, done.
Let's move.

795
00:52:07,287 --> 00:52:09,619
What the fuck, man?

796
00:52:09,723 --> 00:52:12,089
- Mr. and Mrs. Pitt!
- Sheriff's department!

797
00:52:12,192 --> 00:52:13,454
- Sheriff's department!
- Sheriff's department!

798
00:52:15,562 --> 00:52:17,655
<i>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

799
00:52:17,764 --> 00:52:21,097
- Okay. Okay, my-
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

800
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:23,169
I am so tired of you Renos.

801
00:52:23,269 --> 00:52:25,464
I'm sorry this is the end
of the road for you.

802
00:52:25,572 --> 00:52:27,631
But you see, I created
this Brangelina trap...

803
00:52:27,741 --> 00:52:30,107
because you are the last thing
standing in my way.

804
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:32,110
<i>Between what and what?</i>

805
00:52:32,212 --> 00:52:34,146
Between running this town.

806
00:52:36,082 --> 00:52:38,846
Freeze, you fuckin' little monkey!

807
00:52:38,952 --> 00:52:41,978
F.B.I. Nobody move.

808
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:43,988
Are you kidding me?

809
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:46,558
F.B.I., you know-
Catch it. Yeah, you said.

810
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,651
Get down. That's it.

811
00:52:48,762 --> 00:52:51,526
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hold me! Hold me!

812
00:52:51,631 --> 00:52:55,863
- That's it. Let's go.
You stay right where you are.
- We're not movin'.

813
00:52:55,969 --> 00:52:59,200
Go, you flies in the ointment!

814
00:52:59,305 --> 00:53:01,205
Get him!
Get him!

815
00:53:01,307 --> 00:53:04,037
F.B.I., you broke my heart!

816
00:53:04,144 --> 00:53:06,510
You broke my heart!

817
00:53:06,613 --> 00:53:08,205
Oh, shit.

818
00:53:08,314 --> 00:53:10,214
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

819
00:53:10,316 --> 00:53:12,079
<i>- Hold your fire!
- That's good. I'm out.</i>

820
00:53:12,185 --> 00:53:15,712
- Yeah, me too.
- He is gonna lead us to Mr. Big.

821
00:53:15,822 --> 00:53:18,689
- He has the antidote for the bioattack.
- For the convention center.

822
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:20,692
- You're undercover F.B.I.
- Just fucking amazing.

823
00:53:20,794 --> 00:53:22,694
<i>- She earned it.
- Yeah, I am. It's amazing.</i>

824
00:53:22,796 --> 00:53:24,457
- You got a little bit-
- Do l-Yeah.

825
00:53:24,564 --> 00:53:27,965
- On both sides.
- Oh, do I? It's all right,
'cause I'm gonna keep doin' it.

826
00:53:28,068 --> 00:53:31,367
This whole goddamn thing
is busted wide open, Jeff.
Busted open like a $2.00 piñata.

827
00:53:31,471 --> 00:53:34,065
The F.B.I. has had a mole
in with this drug jefe for months.

828
00:53:34,174 --> 00:53:36,734
She knows everything. She knows names.
She knows dates. She knows places.

829
00:53:36,843 --> 00:53:39,903
She can connect the drug
jefe to the bioattack.

830
00:53:40,013 --> 00:53:42,277
She can connect the bioattack
to this Mr. Big.

831
00:53:42,382 --> 00:53:45,818
She can connect Mr. Big, the bioattack
and the drug jefe to the antidote.

832
00:53:45,919 --> 00:53:48,979
We get to Mr. Big, all of these cops are fine.
This bird is gonna sing.

833
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:52,820
- She's gonna sing like a little bird.
- Where-And where is she?

834
00:53:52,926 --> 00:53:56,191
It's a 23-delta-one, sir.
Massive cocaine overdose.

835
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:10,775
You're fired.

836
00:54:10,877 --> 00:54:12,777
All of you.

837
00:54:12,879 --> 00:54:15,473
Um, hand in your badges.

838
00:54:15,582 --> 00:54:17,379
Out of Miami.

839
00:54:17,484 --> 00:54:19,349
- I'm sorry, Jeff.
- Just don't say you're sorry.

840
00:54:19,452 --> 00:54:20,646
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, Jeff.

841
00:54:20,754 --> 00:54:23,848
Don't- S-
Don't say that you're-

842
00:54:23,957 --> 00:54:25,925
- Our bad.
- I have to apologize.

843
00:54:26,025 --> 00:54:27,492
Don't say anything.

844
00:54:27,594 --> 00:54:29,892
- We suck.
- No, j-

845
00:54:29,996 --> 00:54:31,930
- I am really sorry, you know.
- Don't sa- I s-

846
00:54:32,031 --> 00:54:35,000
- You know. You know how shit goes d-
- No, l-Just go.

847
00:54:35,101 --> 00:54:36,591
- Sorry.
- Go. Go.

848
00:54:39,773 --> 00:54:43,675
I have some regrets. I, uh-

849
00:54:43,777 --> 00:54:46,177
It may seem dumb...

850
00:54:46,279 --> 00:54:49,077
but they had one of
those six-person bicycles.

851
00:54:52,786 --> 00:54:55,050
We never got to ride it.

852
00:54:55,155 --> 00:54:58,522
Yeah, might as well
take this and-

853
00:55:01,528 --> 00:55:03,894
"Miami's only 24-hour tattoo parlor.

854
00:55:03,997 --> 00:55:06,158
"Ron's Discount Tattoo.
No waiting.

855
00:55:06,266 --> 00:55:08,496
Hepatitis free."
Oh, my God! I think this is it.

856
00:55:13,173 --> 00:55:15,107
Sheriff's department.

857
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:17,108
- Ron, I'm looking for Ron.
- Hello.

858
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,700
<i>- Ron.
- Hello.</i>

859
00:55:18,812 --> 00:55:21,508
- Buddy.
- Yeah?

860
00:55:21,614 --> 00:55:24,981
<i>Do you remember me at all?
Please say yes.</i>

861
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:28,485
Oh, hey, I don't recognize the face,
but I certainly recognize the cleavage.

862
00:55:28,588 --> 00:55:31,113
How are you, Clem?
We didn't know you was fuzz.

863
00:55:31,224 --> 00:55:33,158
- You remember Paul, right?
- Hiya. Yeah, hi.

864
00:55:33,259 --> 00:55:35,159
- How you doin'?
- Nice to see you.

865
00:55:35,261 --> 00:55:37,752
Please, l- I am in-
I'm in hell here.

866
00:55:37,864 --> 00:55:40,162
- Who is this?
- Oh, that came out real clean.

867
00:55:40,266 --> 00:55:43,997
<i>- That's good work, Ron.
- That is a tight tit tat.</i>

868
00:55:44,103 --> 00:55:46,594
Thanks. Help me out.

869
00:55:46,706 --> 00:55:49,971
- All right. Well-
- Who is it?

870
00:55:50,076 --> 00:55:53,341
<i>Okay, well, you come in with this guy.
He was an older guy.</i>

871
00:55:53,446 --> 00:55:56,904
Looked to me like- I don't know-
he was homeless. Wouldn't you say, Paul?

872
00:55:57,016 --> 00:55:58,916
Yep. Hobo.

873
00:56:00,286 --> 00:56:03,084
And you got his face tattooed
right there on your tit.

874
00:56:07,794 --> 00:56:09,728
So-

875
00:56:13,032 --> 00:56:17,799
- What you're sayin' is I wandered in here-
- Stumbled.

876
00:56:17,904 --> 00:56:22,000
Stumbled in here...
with a vagrant.

877
00:56:23,409 --> 00:56:25,434
More or less. Yeah.

878
00:56:25,545 --> 00:56:27,513
And I...

879
00:56:28,715 --> 00:56:31,513
defaced my chest-

880
00:56:31,618 --> 00:56:34,280
<i>No, you-
y- you faced your chest.</i>

881
00:56:34,387 --> 00:56:36,446
<i>If you want,
we could cover that up.</i>

882
00:56:36,556 --> 00:56:38,922
I could make a unicorn out of that.

883
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:42,085
Freehand.
I do everything freehand.

884
00:56:42,195 --> 00:56:45,528
We screwed up pretty good.

885
00:56:45,632 --> 00:56:48,396
We letJeff the acting mayor down.

886
00:56:48,501 --> 00:56:51,334
But we're big enough...

887
00:56:51,437 --> 00:56:54,133
to admit when
we made a mistake.

888
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,768
And... we're smart enough to fix it.

889
00:56:58,878 --> 00:57:00,869
We're gonna make it up toJeff.

890
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,880
And how are we gonna
make it up toJeff?

891
00:57:02,982 --> 00:57:05,917
The best way we know how,
that's how.

892
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:09,511
Ice cream cake!

893
00:57:13,693 --> 00:57:16,253
<i>Coming!</i>

894
00:57:16,362 --> 00:57:18,523
<i>- Here I come!
- She's coming.</i>

895
00:57:18,631 --> 00:57:20,929
<i>- I'm almost there!
- She's almost here.</i>

896
00:57:21,034 --> 00:57:23,696
<i>All right, who's he-</i>

897
00:57:23,803 --> 00:57:27,295
- Oh! Hello! Look at all of you.
- Hey.

898
00:57:27,407 --> 00:57:29,568
How many?
Trick or treat.

899
00:57:29,676 --> 00:57:31,871
- Yeah, is that what you want?
- Well, no, we came-

900
00:57:31,978 --> 00:57:34,310
- Is Jeff around?
- Yeah. Yeah. He's cleaning his room.

901
00:57:34,414 --> 00:57:36,314
- Oh.
- So disappointed in that boy.

902
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:38,316
- Yeah, he's- he's-
- Oh, God, it's a mess.

903
00:57:38,418 --> 00:57:40,648
- Yeah. What do you want?
- Well, he's kinda disappointed in us...

904
00:57:40,753 --> 00:57:42,914
so we brought him a ice cream cake.

905
00:57:43,022 --> 00:57:44,990
Oh, my God!
Ice cream cake!

906
00:57:45,091 --> 00:57:46,991
Oh, she loves ice cream.
Oh, my God!

907
00:57:47,093 --> 00:57:50,494
- Chocolate chip?
- No, just vanilla. It's just a vanilla.

908
00:57:50,596 --> 00:57:52,530
All right, come on in.

909
00:57:52,632 --> 00:57:54,156
<i>- Jeff!
- He's, uh, in his room there?</i>

910
00:57:54,267 --> 00:57:57,202
<i>- Careful of your shoes, please.
- Watch out for your shoes.</i>

911
00:57:57,303 --> 00:57:59,601
<i>- Hey, Jeff.
- Maybe this would be cheaper than baby laxative.</i>

912
00:57:59,706 --> 00:58:01,606
Those pennies add up.

913
00:58:12,952 --> 00:58:15,512
<i>Take a bow, Reno cops.</i>

914
00:58:15,621 --> 00:58:20,024
<i>- You- Good job.
- Did you set me up, man? 'Cause if you did, man-</i>

915
00:58:20,126 --> 00:58:22,026
What the hell are you even saying?

916
00:58:22,128 --> 00:58:24,187
How clear could I have made it?
Leave no connection between us.

917
00:58:24,297 --> 00:58:27,494
- I don't leave nothing, man.
I see these guys on the-
- Don't leave nothin'.

918
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,194
Then we don't have to worry about them
coming with a camera and-

919
00:58:30,303 --> 00:58:32,203
Oh, my God!
Here they are!

920
00:58:32,305 --> 00:58:35,468
How did they figure out
that we were gonna poison everyone...

921
00:58:35,575 --> 00:58:37,566
in the way of me being the mayor?

922
00:58:37,677 --> 00:58:42,137
And then you, with all of your drug contacts
and distribution...

923
00:58:42,248 --> 00:58:44,273
was going to turn this state...

924
00:58:44,384 --> 00:58:49,117
into the biggest narco empire
on planet Earth?

925
00:58:49,222 --> 00:58:52,191
- Well, they figuring it out now.
- Well, obviously, yeah.

926
00:58:52,291 --> 00:58:54,589
Obviously, you guys put it all together.

927
00:58:54,694 --> 00:59:00,132
That's exactly right, Spoder.
We figured it out.

928
00:59:00,233 --> 00:59:01,825
- Mm-hmm.
- A-All of it.

929
00:59:01,934 --> 00:59:03,526
- Amen.
- And-

930
00:59:03,636 --> 00:59:06,070
Could you go over the middle part again,
what you were doing?

931
00:59:06,172 --> 00:59:08,834
Oh, I'd be- I'd be happy to
repeat the middle part.

932
00:59:08,941 --> 00:59:10,408
- Okay.
- Um, our plan was-

933
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:13,104
- All right, everyone. Everyone.
Everyone, get back!

934
00:59:13,212 --> 00:59:15,180
Get back!
No, no, put that away!

935
00:59:15,281 --> 00:59:18,478
Close the case. Close the case.
Close the case and give it to me.

936
00:59:18,584 --> 00:59:21,519
- Give me the antidote! Give me the antidote!
- Give him the antidote!

937
00:59:21,621 --> 00:59:23,111
- Okay.
- Sorry.

938
00:59:23,222 --> 00:59:25,087
- Hey, man.
- You're on your own.

939
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:27,091
- No, you know what you are, man?
- What?

940
00:59:27,193 --> 00:59:29,286
I say, you know what you are?

941
00:59:29,395 --> 00:59:32,558
<i>You're haza.
You're haza, man.</i>

942
00:59:32,665 --> 00:59:36,761
I've understood, like, every third word you've
said to me the whole time I've known you.

943
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:39,565
And you know what?
I don't really care.

944
00:59:39,672 --> 00:59:42,368
'Cause all of you-

945
00:59:42,475 --> 00:59:44,841
get a load of Spoder!

946
00:59:44,944 --> 00:59:45,911
<i>- Oh-
- Whoa!</i>

947
00:59:46,012 --> 00:59:48,071
Okay, okay. Okay.

948
00:59:50,116 --> 00:59:52,016
This isn't me. This isn't-

949
00:59:52,118 --> 00:59:54,143
<i>- What happened to your accent?
- Whoa.</i>

950
00:59:54,253 --> 00:59:56,778
My name is Ethan.
I live just outside of Denver.

951
00:59:56,889 --> 00:59:58,982
- Shut up!
- Well, not anymore. No, I live here now.

952
00:59:59,092 --> 01:00:01,287
Originally, I'm from Fort Collins.

953
01:00:01,394 --> 01:00:04,124
I was dealing blow
in Colorado, all right?

954
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:07,097
Uh, but it was a- a fruitless thing to do-
No one cared.

955
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,100
It's hard to sell coke there.

956
01:00:09,202 --> 01:00:12,262
I don't know whether it's the elevation
or just the way of life there.

957
01:00:12,371 --> 01:00:16,171
They're more interested in, uh, like, you know,
mush- mushrooms and acid and stuff.

958
01:00:16,275 --> 01:00:19,642
- This was, uh-
- Hey, there's the, uh- antidote-

959
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:23,977
- Do you have more of that here
or is it all with him?
- No, he took all of it.

960
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:27,575
- He has all of the antidote.
- Oh, shit. We should wrap this up.

961
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:29,985
Like I told you,
I will give you anything you want.

962
01:00:30,089 --> 01:00:32,284
Uh, as long as
I get immunity here. I don't care.

963
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:34,689
- I'll rat that guy.
- I think we can do that. That's cool.

964
01:00:34,794 --> 01:00:37,627
- I think we can do immunity, right?
- That would be the greatest.

965
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,630
<i>- No immunity to bullets.
- Oh, God!</i>

966
01:00:39,732 --> 01:00:41,791
<i>Oh, God!</i>

967
01:00:47,173 --> 01:00:49,164
- Let's get him!
- Oh, my God! Get him! Get him!

968
01:00:49,275 --> 01:00:51,175
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

969
01:00:51,277 --> 01:00:53,177
Shit! She's stuck!
She's stuck!

970
01:00:53,279 --> 01:00:55,179
- Push me!
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

971
01:00:55,281 --> 01:00:57,181
Go the other way!
Go the other way!

972
01:00:57,283 --> 01:00:59,308
<i>Other way! Other way!
Other way! Other way! Other way!</i>

973
01:00:59,418 --> 01:01:01,318
<i>- Go! Go! Go!
- Hey, what's going on?</i>

974
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:03,820
- You stay right there, Mrs. Spoder.
- Why are you going away now?

975
01:01:03,923 --> 01:01:06,585
<i>- You're a material witness, Mrs. Spoder!
- We're gonna come back for you.</i>

976
01:01:06,692 --> 01:01:08,660
- Can somebody help me?
- Spoder!

977
01:01:08,761 --> 01:01:10,956
<i>- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Drop it! Drop it right away, now!</i>

978
01:01:11,063 --> 01:01:13,827
Oh, my God! Jesus!

979
01:01:13,933 --> 01:01:16,163
Hey! Hey!

980
01:01:16,269 --> 01:01:19,568
What the fuck? Did they- Did they run away?
No running away! What the fuck?

981
01:01:19,739 --> 01:01:22,731
- Go! Come on! Go! Go! Go!
- All right, you want a chase?

982
01:01:22,842 --> 01:01:24,742
He's goin'.

983
01:01:24,844 --> 01:01:26,971
- Oh, time out.
- Hang on, Wiegel!

984
01:01:28,748 --> 01:01:30,648
Jeff!

985
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,650
- Travis!
- Give it up!

986
01:01:32,752 --> 01:01:34,652
- Junior, don't play God.
- Travis!

987
01:01:34,754 --> 01:01:38,281
- Out of the way! Police pursuit!
- Whoa!

988
01:01:38,391 --> 01:01:41,189
- You gotta- Son of a-Jesus!
- Junior! Halt!

989
01:01:41,294 --> 01:01:43,558
- Whoa!
- I got him!

990
01:01:43,663 --> 01:01:47,463
- Come on. Let's go for it!
- Get out of the vehicle now!

991
01:01:47,567 --> 01:01:50,297
- Ohh!
- Nice one.

992
01:01:50,403 --> 01:01:53,338
Why not?

993
01:01:53,439 --> 01:01:56,101
- Go to the left!
- Miami cops!

994
01:01:56,209 --> 01:01:58,143
Ohh! Ohh!

- I know. I know.

1001
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:19,262
- He's gonna do it!
- I'm gonna jump it!

Everyone, stand up and look at me!
Stand up and look at me!

Don't walk after them! Kick them
away from you and stay where you are!

- What are you doing?
- I'm kicking them and stepping back.

01:02:57,837 --> 01:03:00,032
Step back!

1016
01:03:00,139 --> 01:03:03,506
Guess what?
I'm glad it came to this.

1017
01:03:03,609 --> 01:03:08,376
I'm glad that you douche-nozzles
ruined my plan.

1018

Final words.
Johnson, go.

1022
01:03:23,996 --> 01:03:26,396
Um, um, uh, legalize it?

Great. Fine. Wiegel.

01:04:16,349 --> 01:04:19,147
<i>- Whoo! Ha, ha!
- We did it!</i>

1037
01:04:21,454 --> 01:04:26,153
I need the extender!

1038
01:04:26,258 --> 01:04:29,284
I need the- another set of cuffs.
He's too chubby to fit 'em.

1039
01:04:29,395 --> 01:04:31,386
Yeah!

1040
01:04:35,868 --> 01:04:39,565
I'm not chubby.
This is protective karate fat.

1041
01:04:39,672 --> 01:04:44,336
- Protective karate fat. You know what?
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1042
01:04:44,443 --> 01:04:46,502
Tell it to the judge, Spoder.

1043
01:04:51,784 --> 01:04:55,618
Nice work, people.
Nice work, indeed.

1044
01:04:55,721 --> 01:05:00,055
You know, I know we're probably not
the smartest bunch of cops in the whole world.

1045
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:02,286
Probably not the best trained.

1046
01:05:05,131 --> 01:05:07,759
Probably not the smartest bunch
of cops in the whole world.

1047
01:05:07,867 --> 01:05:10,836
<i>Individually, I don't think
we look like much-</i>

1048
01:05:10,936 --> 01:05:16,272
- a couple of colored people,
some white folks, a lesbian.
- Sir, I'm not-

1049
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:19,833
But l- I think
the important thing is-

1050
01:05:19,945 --> 01:05:22,937
<i>Know what we are?
Does anybody know what we are?</i>

1051
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:24,982
- A squad?
- Gorgeous.

1052
01:05:25,084 --> 01:05:26,984
- Squad. Gorgeous.
- People.

1053
01:05:27,086 --> 01:05:29,281
- People. All sort of right.
- Broke.

1054
01:05:29,388 --> 01:05:31,151
- Rope?
- Broke.

1055
01:05:31,257 --> 01:05:33,157
Broke. All pretty accurate.

1056
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:34,851
- Heroes.
- I thought you said rope.

1057
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,952
Heroes- Can I fini- Okay, can I fuckin' finish
the thing I was gonna say?

1058
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:43,597
<i>Shit!</i>

1059
01:05:47,706 --> 01:05:50,368
That was my bad.

1060
01:05:50,476 --> 01:05:52,944
- Was that the oneJeff was in?
- Yeah.

1061
01:05:55,915 --> 01:05:58,850
- Anybody-
- Double-time. Double-time.

1062
01:05:58,951 --> 01:06:02,478
Double-time. Double-time.
Trudy. Trudy, double-time.

<i>If you were inside
the convention center...</i>

1064

to be inoculated.</i>

1065
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:13,327
<i>We have an antidote. We need everyone
to line up now, please, in an orderly fashion.</i>

1066
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:18,602
Hi.

1067
01:06:18,704 --> 01:06:21,764
Look, you don't have to thank us.

1068
01:06:21,874 --> 01:06:23,933
I know.

1069
01:06:24,043 --> 01:06:27,171
You did your job. Barely.

1070
01:06:27,279 --> 01:06:29,474
So what?

1071
01:06:35,688 --> 01:06:39,180
Well, good ridd- riddance
to you too. I mean-

1072
01:07:13,459 --> 01:07:16,292
These were literally right in front of me.

1073

<i>He's getting his badge.</i>

1074
01:07:41,587 --> 01:07:43,987
- Heroes.
- We did it.

1075
01:07:44,089 --> 01:07:46,489
Teamwork. Teamwork. Teamwork.
Hands in. Hands in.

1076
01:07:46,592 --> 01:07:49,993
- That's my team. A teamwork team.
- Reno!

1077
01:07:50,095 --> 01:07:52,086
Best sheriff's department in the world.

1078
01:07:52,197 --> 01:07:54,131
I bet we're gonna make
the national real deal.

1079
01:07:54,233 --> 01:07:56,133
- We rock.
- Dangle. Can I talk to you?

1080
01:07:56,235 --> 01:07:59,568
- You could-
- Yeah. Sure.

1081
01:08:00,806 --> 01:08:03,934
You're something to behold
when you are in action.

1082
01:08:05,544 --> 01:08:07,944
I'm impressed.

1083
01:08:08,047 --> 01:08:12,677
And I have been wrong about you.
I want to make it right.

1084
01:08:12,785 --> 01:08:16,016
I want to invite you to
the Aspen Sheriff's Department.

1085
01:08:17,456 --> 01:08:19,686
We'd like you to join us.

1086
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,594
Sheriff Wagner...

1087
01:08:33,706 --> 01:08:37,642
the Reno Sheriff's Department
isn't just my coworkers...

1088
01:08:38,844 --> 01:08:40,812
they're like my family.

1089
01:08:43,582 --> 01:08:46,551
But they're also...

1090
01:08:48,954 --> 01:08:53,584
the dumbest group of people I've ever met
who weren't legally retarded.

1091
01:08:55,427 --> 01:08:57,418
So l- I would like a new family.

1092
01:08:57,529 --> 01:08:59,588
And I'd like that family
to be you guys.

1093
01:08:59,698 --> 01:09:03,794
- You're awesome. Yes, I accept.
Thank you very much.
- Boys.

1094
01:09:03,902 --> 01:09:06,666
Guys, I'll see you!
I'm going, uh, to Aspen.

1095
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:08,672
- What?
- Well, when are you gonna be back?

1096
01:09:08,774 --> 01:09:11,641
Uh, won't. Won't be back. I'm taking a job
at the Aspen Sheriff's Department.

1097
01:09:11,744 --> 01:09:13,905
<i>- What?
- You're quittin'?</i>

1098
01:09:14,013 --> 01:09:17,312
Yeah. I'm not quitting.
No. I mean, well, I am.

1099
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:19,247
Jim, you're just gonna leave me here?

1100
01:09:19,351 --> 01:09:22,343
- No, I'm gonna leave all of you here.
- I love you.

1101
01:09:22,454 --> 01:09:25,082
- I know. I know. You've always loved me. It's fine.
- Oh.

1102
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:27,715
I'll see you guys.
Where do you guys ski?

1103
01:09:27,826 --> 01:09:30,021
Do you guys ski Ajax
or do you guys ski Snowmass?

1104
01:09:37,436 --> 01:09:40,200
- Hold mine too.
- Sure was a good time.

1105
01:09:40,305 --> 01:09:42,466
<i>- Oh, he's not holding your bag.
- Whoo!</i>

1106
01:09:42,574 --> 01:09:45,702
Hey, Terry.

1107
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:49,269
<i>- What are you doing here?
- Terry was giving tug jobs
on the East Coast out here.</i>

1108
01:09:49,381 --> 01:09:51,281
He says he's out here
recording his album.

1109
01:09:51,383 --> 01:09:53,817
I am recording my album.
See, I have a violin.

1110
01:09:53,919 --> 01:09:57,787
<i>- Mm-hmm. That's a ukulele, Terry.
- Your mom's a ukulele, Terry.</i>

1111
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:00,882
We're getting on the bus and going back home.
We're not in the mood for your high jinks.

1112
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:03,860
I'm not taking the bus, 'cause
it smells like farts.

1113
01:10:03,962 --> 01:10:07,898
I have my own jet, okay,
that my dad bought me for Flag Day.

1114
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,195
- I already told you that.
- Terry, you gonna take your limo?

1115
01:10:10,302 --> 01:10:12,532
<i>I'll take my limo.
Yes, that's correct.</i>

1116
01:10:12,638 --> 01:10:14,572
And my limo driver, Barry Baum.

1117
01:10:14,673 --> 01:10:17,437
<i>- Your limo driver Barry Baum-
- That's his name. Barry Baum.</i>

1118
01:10:17,543 --> 01:10:20,307
<i>- is gonna take you to your privatejet?
- Here it is. Oh.</i>

1119
01:10:20,412 --> 01:10:22,539
Hey, look at my "lim'."
It just appeared.

1120
01:10:22,648 --> 01:10:26,482
- Hi, Barry Baum.
- Sir.

1121
01:10:26,585 --> 01:10:30,021
- Sir, is your name, in fact, Barry Baum?
- Thank you.

1122
01:10:30,122 --> 01:10:32,022
I'm Barry Baum, yes.

1123
01:10:32,124 --> 01:10:35,389
You guys want a ride or do you
want to ride in the fartmobile?

1124
01:10:36,462 --> 01:10:38,760
- I got shotgun!
- No, let's go.

1125
01:10:38,864 --> 01:10:40,832
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1126
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:46,770
Whoo!
Here it is!

1127
01:10:46,872 --> 01:10:48,840
- Super Terry Airlines.
- Oh, my God.

1128
01:10:48,941 --> 01:10:52,570
- Come onboard. It's so fucking sweet.
- Holy fuck!

1129
01:10:52,678 --> 01:10:55,647
<i>- Ta-da!
- Dad!</i>

1130
01:10:55,748 --> 01:10:59,809
<i>- Fuck You, Dad.
- Fuck you, Dad.</i>

1131
01:10:59,918 --> 01:11:03,149
Fuck you.

1132
01:11:03,255 --> 01:11:06,281
- Do you like the new album or what?
- I love the new album.

1133
01:11:06,391 --> 01:11:10,020
- Listening party. Monaco.
- Oh, sign me up.

1134
01:11:10,129 --> 01:11:13,792
- I like the hair. It's so Stamos.
- Thank you. Thank you. Who's your friends?

1135
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:16,390
These are my friends from Reno.
They're the police officers.

1136
01:11:16,502 --> 01:11:18,561
Nice to meet you, sir.
You have a wonderful son.

1137
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:20,695
Oh, thank you.
I know I got a wonderful son.

1138
01:11:20,806 --> 01:11:24,139
We've arrested him several times
for giving blow jobs on the street corner.

1139
01:11:24,243 --> 01:11:27,406
- Quick impression.
- That's you.

1140
01:11:27,513 --> 01:11:30,141
<i>Is this, uh, really,
uh, his jet up here?</i>

1141
01:11:30,249 --> 01:11:33,446
This is his jet. I gave it to him
as a gift for Flag Day, remember?

1142
01:11:33,552 --> 01:11:36,988
I do remember. Oh, that was a great Flag Day.
Probably my best one.

1143
01:11:37,089 --> 01:11:39,250
<i>- TheJacuzzi's on.
- We can get a ride?</i>

1144
01:11:39,358 --> 01:11:41,758
- Sure.
- Thank you, sir.

1145
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:45,057
- I didn't believe you. I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I love you guys.

1146
01:11:45,164 --> 01:11:47,530
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Thank you, Terry.</i>

1147
01:11:47,633 --> 01:11:50,295
<i>- Oh, wow.
- Whoo!</i>

1148
01:11:50,402 --> 01:11:52,893
<i>Whoo!</i>

1149
01:11:55,741 --> 01:11:58,107
Um, as you know, we have, uh...

1150
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:00,701
faced violence and danger
on a daily basis...

1151
01:12:00,813 --> 01:12:03,077
throughout our career, uh, via weapons...

1152
01:12:03,182 --> 01:12:06,515
such as knives, shivs, forks,
things like that.

1153
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:09,382
The department wants us
to be aware of something else.

1154
01:12:09,488 --> 01:12:11,547
They have issued us, uh...

1155
01:12:11,657 --> 01:12:16,060
a requirement to carry Handi sanitary wipes
for the deadly fluids.

1156
01:12:18,197 --> 01:12:20,927
Hi, guys.

1157
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:27,302
I'll take it from here.

1158
01:12:27,406 --> 01:12:30,136
Thank you. Thank you, guys.

1159
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:36,474
<i>I wanna-</i>

1160
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:41,414
I got out to Colorado...

1161
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,648
and I went out, uh, and stood...

1162
01:12:44,756 --> 01:12:48,192
at the top of a mountain
they- they call Ajax.

1163
01:12:48,293 --> 01:12:52,320
And I looked down the mountain,
and I looked at all the runs.

1164
01:12:52,431 --> 01:12:57,368
And I could see the way
that the runs intertwined.

1165
01:12:57,469 --> 01:13:00,302
- They found out you were a-
- Yeah, they did. Mm-hmm.

1166
01:13:00,405 --> 01:13:03,306
Yeah. They got a zero tolerance
on that one over there.

1167
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:08,910
I just want to say
I know that, um-

1168
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:11,278
I know that you came back for me.

1169
01:13:11,383 --> 01:13:13,613
And I appreciate it.

1170
01:13:16,255 --> 01:13:18,416
- We'll talk later.
- Okay.

1171
01:13:19,825 --> 01:13:21,725
<i>- Sorry, gang.
- It's okay.</i>

1172
01:13:21,827 --> 01:13:27,595
<i>No better way to show your affection
than a quick... wiener cupping.</i>

1173
01:13:29,301 --> 01:13:32,930
<i>- Hey, Jim, you know what you
missed while you weren't here?
- What's that?</i>

1174
01:13:33,038 --> 01:13:35,063
- Pajama Tuesdays.
- Oh, sweet!

1175
01:13:35,173 --> 01:13:37,607
Which, uh, she was only one
who really participated in.

1176
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:42,510
And I think that she did not do it on purpose,
but then tried to play it off as Pajama Tuesday.

1177
01:13:42,614 --> 01:13:44,582
<i>Hey, gang! Amazing news.</i>

1178
01:13:44,683 --> 01:13:50,315
Oh, my God. We have been invited to
take part in Handcuffs Across the Water.

1179
01:13:50,422 --> 01:13:52,788
<i>We're going to Scotland Yard!</i>

1180
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:56,190
<i>Yes!</i>

1181
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,699
All week long I've been
looking for this guy.

1182
01:14:04,803 --> 01:14:07,567
And he's on my boob,
and he's on my boob forever, you know.

1183
01:14:07,673 --> 01:14:10,107
And I don't-
I don't know who this is.

1184
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:12,472
I don't know who this is,
but damn it, Garcia...

1185
01:14:12,577 --> 01:14:16,741
- I just thought finally, you know, I can-
- Yeah. Yeah.

1186
01:14:16,848 --> 01:14:20,113
<i>- can come home to somebody.
- My God, I had the same thing
happen to me. l-</i>

1187
01:14:21,219 --> 01:14:22,948
Right there.

1188
01:14:23,055 --> 01:14:26,047
- Kinda.
- You got a tattoo.

1189
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,960
- Please, go on the other side
of the fence. You don't want-
- On the other side of the fence?

1190
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:41,403
I want to find out what
your half lives like. Lulu!

1191
01:14:47,646 --> 01:14:49,170
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

1192
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:51,181
- What is that?
- I'm giving you what you're asking for.

1193
01:14:51,283 --> 01:14:54,741
You wouldn't dare shoot me.
And I'll prove it.

1194
01:14:54,853 --> 01:14:57,822
- Holy shit!
- Okay, step out of the pool.

1195
01:14:57,923 --> 01:15:02,257
Look at you! Wow.

1196
01:15:02,361 --> 01:15:05,819
You are, uh, in high school.

1197
01:15:05,931 --> 01:15:09,628
Junior high. I'll be 14 next month.
I missed seventh grade.

1198
01:15:09,735 --> 01:15:12,966
Hey! Fourteen! Next month!

1199
01:15:13,071 --> 01:15:16,507
- No, well, I'm a whole year older for my grade.
- That's great. Good for you.

1200
01:15:16,608 --> 01:15:20,100
<i>- How are you?
- I'm running away from home.
So fuck you and fuck Iowa.</i>

1201
01:15:20,212 --> 01:15:23,238
- I'm leaving with my man.
- She's not- She's not- She's
not running away from home.

1202
01:15:23,348 --> 01:15:25,339
- Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
- No, no, no, no!

1203
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:27,577
- Come on.
- Is it the uniform? Is it the uniform?

1204
01:15:27,686 --> 01:15:29,586
- I can take it off.
- No, no, no, no.

1205
01:15:29,688 --> 01:15:31,679
- No!
- I can take it off! No, I'll take it off!

1206
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:33,951
Joe. Joe. Joe.
We'll get in real trouble with this.

1207
01:15:34,059 --> 01:15:36,892
I'll be bad.
Look, I'll be your naughty schoolgirl!

1208
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:39,327
- No! No!
- No! That's not really-That's not really funny...

1209
01:15:39,431 --> 01:15:41,831
- if you're actually still in school.
- I have on really cute under-

1210
01:15:41,933 --> 01:15:43,833
- They're fuzzy hearts.
- No, no, no!

1211
01:15:43,935 --> 01:15:47,632
- Touch my fuzzy hearts! No!
- No, no, no!

1212
01:15:47,739 --> 01:15:49,639
<i>No!</i>

1213
01:15:49,741 --> 01:15:52,869
Very, very nice to meet you.
You have a very good drive back to Iowa.

1214
01:15:52,978 --> 01:15:56,971
- No, no, no!
- Why?

1215
01:15:57,082 --> 01:16:00,108
Call me when you're 16.

1216
01:16:00,218 --> 01:16:04,211
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Easy. Easy does it.

1217
01:16:04,322 --> 01:16:06,449
Easy. Easy. Easy.

1218
01:16:06,558 --> 01:16:09,322
Tru. Tru. Easy. Easy. Easy.
Wait. Okay.

1219
01:16:09,428 --> 01:16:11,419
I don't know.
I saw this in the movies once.

1220
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:14,966
- It doesn't go like this.
- I don't think- I think I'm
supposed to be where you are.

1221
01:16:15,067 --> 01:16:18,468
<i>- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

1222
01:16:19,538 --> 01:16:21,438
- All right.

1223
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:24,475
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Tell me the truth.

1224
01:16:24,576 --> 01:16:29,536
You are a lesbian, right?
I ain't gonna tell nobody.

1225
01:16:29,648 --> 01:16:33,175
I don't know how many times
or how many ways I have to say this.

1226
01:16:33,285 --> 01:16:35,310
I am not a lesbian.

1227
01:16:37,823 --> 01:16:40,621
I'm pretty sure she is.

1228
01:16:40,725 --> 01:16:43,785
Get back on your Commie fuckin' raft,
and get the hell back to Cuba.

1229
01:16:43,895 --> 01:16:46,125
And you know what?
Tell Castro we said, "Hey, what's up?"

1230
01:16:46,231 --> 01:16:47,493
Now!

1231
01:16:57,843 --> 01:16:59,743
You know you're going
through X-ray, don't you?

1232
01:16:59,845 --> 01:17:01,836
How does it work?
What the hell kind of a-

1233
01:17:01,947 --> 01:17:05,747
- Oh, see, it's like that.
You put it in, and then you-
- Don't- Don't do that.

1234
01:17:05,851 --> 01:17:08,445
- Okay. What's that for?
- This gets the resin out, and then you- Here.

1235
01:17:08,553 --> 01:17:10,316
- You suck the resin off. Get high.
- Don't, don't, don't-

1236
01:17:10,422 --> 01:17:12,982
But you can also do a shotgun-
You can shotgun it too.

1237
01:17:13,091 --> 01:17:16,117
Well, wait, I can- No, you shotgun it
off of here. You light the middle.

1238
01:17:16,228 --> 01:17:19,129
- And then you light it, and you go-
- Oh, that's shotgunnin' it.

1239
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,131
<i>- Double bong. Double bong.
- Please- Please don't do that.</i>

1240
01:17:21,233 --> 01:17:23,997
- You suck on that. You suck on this end.
- That end right there-

1241
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:26,002
- And then you-
- Okay, no-

1242
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:30,268
- What does it do?
- That is inserted in the anus...

1243
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:35,813
and then you pull this to extract
impacted fecal matter.

1244
01:17:38,917 --> 01:17:40,885
I'm a proctologist.

1245
01:17:48,093 --> 01:17:51,085
- That explains the- the taste of the old butt.
- Yeah.

1246
01:21:44,129 --> 01:21:47,360
Check it out.

1247
01:21:50,402 --> 01:21:52,563
That one works.

1248
01:22:07,018 --> 01:22:09,316
- Is it workin'? It's stuck.
- The bag's stuck in there?

1249
01:22:09,421 --> 01:22:12,515
- The bag's stuck.
- Here, well, get it in-

1250
01:22:14,592 --> 01:22:17,117
- What's the radioactive symbol for?
- Uh-

1251
01:22:17,228 --> 01:22:20,288
- Can you get it?
- Wait. Okay, wait, push it this way.

1252
01:22:20,398 --> 01:22:22,298
- Push it which way?
- Yeah.

1253
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,834
- That way?
- No, th- No, other way. Other way. Other way.

1254
01:22:24,936 --> 01:22:27,461
Please. Other way.
Ow! Motherfucker! Goddamn it!

1255
01:22:27,572 --> 01:22:29,472
- Hang on. Hang on, I got it!
- Ow! Ahh!

1256
01:22:29,574 --> 01:22:31,769
- Oh, don't!
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

1257
01:22:31,876 --> 01:22:34,276
No, no, no, no!
Jesus! Ohh! Ohh!

1258
01:22:34,379 --> 01:22:37,280
Please stop it.
Please stop it. Ow!

1259
01:22:37,382 --> 01:22:39,282
Oh. Hey, okay, okay, okay!

1260
01:22:39,384 --> 01:22:42,012
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Please, don't move again.</i>

1261
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,486
- You never had your wisdom teeth out?
- What do you mean?

1262
01:22:44,589 --> 01:22:47,456
- I think you might need
your wisdom teeth out, bro.
- What are wisdom teeth?

1263
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:53,861
Is it goin'? Is it goin'?
Do l- Do I talk now? Do I talk?

1264
01:22:53,965 --> 01:22:56,763
Do I look at you,
or do I look into the thing?

1265
01:23:00,371 --> 01:23:03,363
You know, they told us just to
act natural when the cameras are on...

1266
01:23:03,475 --> 01:23:06,933
but, uh, you know,
you feel kinda like a-

1267
01:23:08,913 --> 01:23:12,747
Feel likeJeff Gordon or something
with the camera on me all the time.

1268
01:23:12,851 --> 01:23:14,910
Wish I had something to say.

1269
01:23:16,654 --> 01:23:20,090
Do I look better like this- 10:00 and 12:00-
or do I look better like this?

1270
01:23:20,191 --> 01:23:23,854
'Cause I could also- I could roll down
a window and do, like- like this.

1271
01:23:24,996 --> 01:23:27,294
<i>Shit! Fuck! Ow!</i>
