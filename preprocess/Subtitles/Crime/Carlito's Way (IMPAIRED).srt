There's no vindication here, Counselor.

Or absolution, or benediction, or anything,

29
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,383
other than an incredible convergence
of circumstances

00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,927
which you have exploited
to your client's benefit.

31
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,513
With all due respect, Your Honor,
these circumstances that you speak of

00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,433
include illegal wiretaps
and tainted evidence.

01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:40,152
CARLlTO: They're just dancin'.

1059
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:44,365
Don't you appreciate that,
the movement, the rhythm?

1060
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:47,451
What l don't appreciate,
he's got his fucking hands all over her ass.

1061
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:51,122
He don't have his hands over her ass.

1062
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,374
l believe those are her hips.

1063
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:57,128
Look at the shithead.

1064
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,506
These wise guys think
they're so hard-assed.

1065
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:04,135
l am so sick of hoods like that

1066
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:07,221
coming into my office, my office,

1067
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:10,308
thinkin' they can push me around.

1068
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:18,065
You should tell him what you think.
Why hold somethin' like that inside?

1069
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:21,319
Why not get something like that
off your chest?

1070
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:23,654
-lt's a terrible thing to carry around.
-l will.

1071
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,656
-l think you should.
-l will.

1072
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:29,785
See how interested he's gonna be
in your comments.

1073
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,167
What are you doin'?

1074
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,544
-Are you out of your fucking mind?
-What's that?

1075
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:42,173
-Yeah, you, wop.
-Me?

1076
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,592
-You, spaghetti-dick.
-Wait. Okay, okay.

1077
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:47,720
-l'm talking to you. Yeah, you.
-You're talkin' to me?

1078
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:51,057
-Just ignore him. He's drunk.
-What'd he say?

1079
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:53,517
Sit down !

1080
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:57,730
-Who does he think he is?
-No problem.

1081
01:27:57,814 --> 01:28:01,192
Come on. Let's have a drink.
Come on, everybody.

1082
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:05,029
-Can you believe this loser?
-Let's go back to the table.

1083
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,157
-People have no sense of humor.
-Let's go.

1084
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:12,119
l was just fooling around.
l'd never let anything happen.

1085
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:15,623
Carlito and me, we take care of each other.
He knows. Right, kid?

1086
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:16,958
Come on.

1087
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:20,503
You're a beautiful woman.

1088
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:25,925
You don't get seasick on boats, do you?

1089
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:31,055
-No, l don't.
-Good.

1090
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:35,810
Just asking 'cause of our little boat trip
tomorrow night.

1091
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:37,019
Just drop it.

1092
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:41,273
Just tryin' to cover all the bases.
lt's comin' up, you know.

1093
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:47,863
You two going somewhere?

1094
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,492
No big deal. Just a little boat ride.

1095
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:55,496
Why don't you just let it go?
lt's dull what you're doin'.

1096
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,498
-What's the problem?
-lt's just fuckin' dull.

1097
01:28:57,582 --> 01:29:00,126
-l'm just askin' a simple question.
-No, you're not.

1098
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,795
-What's the matter?
-You're actin' like an asshole.

1099
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:07,466
lf a guy's goin' on a boat, you wanna know
if he gets seasick. lt could be important.

1100
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:08,968
What boat?

1101
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:14,724
What boat are you talking about?

1102
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,232
What boat, Charlie?

1103
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:42,710
lf you ever talk that shit again
in front of her, l'm gonna kill you.

1104
01:29:48,467 --> 01:29:50,134
What's the matter with him?

1105
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:54,972
l don't like him.

1106
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:59,560
-l didn't like him the minute l met him.
-You're just not listenin' to me.

1107
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:03,606
All right.

1108
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:07,276
So what is this boat thing?

1109
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:11,489
What is that asshole manipulating you into?
Tell me.

1110
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:15,076
Just helpin' him out with something,
that's all. l owe him.

1111
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,494
You owe him?

1112
01:30:17,788 --> 01:30:20,206
He's a fucking cokehead !

1113
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:23,709
l can't believe you hang around
with that guy.

1114
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:26,045
He's sick.

1115
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:29,507
He's gonna get you killed,
or sent back to prison.

1116
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:31,509
He saved my life!

1117
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:35,387
So now you have to pay him with it?

1118
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:40,935
Jesus Christ, Charlie,
you give me this whole song and dance

1119
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:44,271
about how you're out of that shit,
but you're not.

1120
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:47,316
Song and dance? What does that mean,
"song and dance"?

1121
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:49,360
You're not.

1122
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:52,530
Where'd you get that? From what?

1123
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,619
-Why did you drag me into this?
-Drag you into what?

1124
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:02,123
Why did you make me believe all the crap
about Bahamas and paradise?

1125
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:06,043
l feel ridiculous!

1126
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:09,213
'Cause you haven't changed !

1127
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,757
You haven't changed a bit!

1128
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:19,682
What the fuck are you tryin' to tell me?

1129
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:24,311
That my gettin' out is just some bullshit,
fantasy trip l'm layin' on you?

1130
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,939
ls that what you're sayin'?
How could you say that?

1131
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:30,234
How can you say that
when you know how close l am?

1132
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:33,863
How could you say those words to me?

1133
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:38,576
l gotta do this, just this one thing,
and then l'm out.

1134
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:41,287
-l owe Dave.
-You don't owe him shit!

1135
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:43,831
You think you do. That's the problem.

1136
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:47,293
-That's why nobody like you gets out.
-You're not listening.

1137
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:51,088
Everything you learned
in the neighborhood, every instinct

1138
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:53,632
won't do anything but get you killed !

1139
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:56,886
How do you know what l learned
in my neighborhood?

1140
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,221
This is stupid what you're saying.

1141
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:01,557
l know how this dream ends.

1142
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:04,685
lt isn't in paradise.

1143
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:11,859
lt ends with me carrying you
into Sutton Emergency Room

1144
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:14,361
at 3:00 a.m.

1145
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,741
And standing there,

1146
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:21,577
crying like an idiot

1147
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:27,082
while your shoes fill with blood and you die.

1148
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:31,879
-You won't listen to me. . .
-'Cause you're bullshitting me!

1149
01:32:32,172 --> 01:32:34,715
You're not listening to me!

1150
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:42,848
Charlie!

1151
01:32:48,021 --> 01:32:51,815
Dave is my friend, Gail.

1152
01:32:52,317 --> 01:32:53,651
l owe him.

1153
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:56,070
That's

1154
01:32:57,656 --> 01:32:58,822
who l am.

1155
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:02,743
That's what l am, right or wrong.

1156
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:07,289
l can't change that!

1157
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:22,054
Whatever he wants you to do,

1158
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:26,141
don't do it.

1159
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:29,895
For me, please, don't do it.

1160
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,190
Please.

1161
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:36,777
Just don't do it.

1162
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:45,202
That's the last time l wipe up your blood !

1163
01:33:49,499 --> 01:33:52,793
<i>CARLlTO: Came the big night,</i>
<i>and right away l didn't like it.</i>

1164
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:55,629
<i>Kleinfeld was coked out of his mind,</i>

1165
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:59,341
<i>the flaps of his nose, all red and swollen.</i>

1166
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:01,719
<i>Bad start, Jack.</i>

1167
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:09,018
-What's with the extra guy?
-This is one of Tony's sons, Frankie.

1168
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:10,519
-lt's Frank.
-Whatever.

1169
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:13,981
-What is with the extra guy?
-Excuse me, is this your boat?

1170
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:17,359
Then shut the fuck up.
l thought l needed help, l brought help.

1171
01:34:17,444 --> 01:34:19,945
We'll take the La Guardia side
through the Sound.

1172
01:34:20,030 --> 01:34:24,116
Take the wheel when we pick up Tony.
Carlito, you help me fish him out.

1173
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,827
-lt's Frank.
-Whatever. Cast her off.

1174
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:31,415
-What's that?
-Untie the fuckin' rope, spic! Come on !

1175
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,433
This guy a friend of yours?

1176
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:53,020
Yeah, he's a friend of mine.

1177
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:55,105
He's a fucking cockroach.

1178
01:35:14,584 --> 01:35:16,835
All right now, take it easy.

1179
01:35:17,587 --> 01:35:18,837
l see the buoy.

1180
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:21,507
You see it? Where?

1181
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:26,804
Slow. l can't see a fuckin' thing.

1182
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:30,349
DAVE: lt's right there.
CARLlTO: Did you hear what l just said?

1183
01:35:30,433 --> 01:35:32,810
Would you slow down?
You're gonna run him over.

1184
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:38,273
TONY: Where you goin'?

1185
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:42,694
Jesus, fuck, you passed him ! You idiot!

1186

Frankie boy, hold on.
You come up on the fly deck with me.

1187
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:48,075
We can't back it up from down here.

1188
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,535
Up here! Come on !

1189

Yeah, the light.

1197
