-Yeah. I'll remember that.

"New people, new department."

-Do you? Ah. What is it this time?

-Or did you cook up something new?
-I知 sorry about all that.

I wanted your advice.
I was thinking of--

-Thinking?
-Marriage.

Marriage? The "M" word?

641
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,853
Does "confidentiality"
mean anything to you?

642
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,479
That's funny.

643

We'd go in my office...

-...and you know what you'd tell me?
-What?

645
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:21,071
You'd tell me something like, "Doc...

...l want to marry Murtaugh."

Something to ridicule me, Riggs.

Something to get a rise out of me.

-Captain Riggs.
-Captain Murtaugh.

The taller ones come up to the navel.

They were short, but big enough
to kick your ass. What can l do for you?

672

One of the ship's crew shot one of
the illegals, apparently under orders...

...and we'd dearly like to know
who's smuggling Chinese these days.

Where's he hanging out these days?

He's got a nightclub,
couple restaurants.

681
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:02,339
He operates mainly out on North Broadway.
Here's the address.

What you got on the freighter homicide?

686
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,687
I'm all over it. I talked to some illegals.
They only knew the shooter by sight.

687
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,188
Checked out the boat.

688
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,026
Turns out the boat's registered under
a dummy corporation out of Indonesia.

689
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:25,154
It'll be a rough one to crack,
but we'll nail them.

Benny Chan.
No. What kind of bad man is he?

Real bad.
Big crime boss in Chinatown.

Benny's doing it.

At this restaurant.

I'm hungry for Chinese, Rog.
How about you?

Since we're going there anyway,

Spend time with him.
You might learn to love him.
