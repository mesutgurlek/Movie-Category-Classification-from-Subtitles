We just present a threat assessment.

156
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,837
- Why is he coming?
- To make a speech.

157
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,513
To escape the International Criminal Court.

158
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:20,583
Security Council was debating whether
to bring charges of ethnic cleansing,

159
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:24,187
so he'll come,
talk about free elections and reform

160
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,187
and pray that that appeases everyone.

161
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,384
So the stakes are high.
He's not going to cancel.

162
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,161
Tell me about the interpreter.

163
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,133
Born here, but lived mostly
in Africa and Europe.

164
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,364
She studied music in Johannesburg

165
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,533
and linguistics at the Sorbonne
and various countries in Europe.

166
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,905
Parents?

167
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:52,607
<i>British mother, white African father</i>.
<i>Moved here five years ago</i>.

168
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,719
Interview couldn't have taken long.
She's just what they want.

169
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,890
- She is the UN.
- Can she cook?

170
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,788
What else do we know?
Since the initial clearance.

171
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,461
Is she married?

172
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:08,394
<i>Does she have a child?</i>
<i>Does she belong to any clubs?</i>

173
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,898
Is she registered to vote?

174
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,731
<i>Democrat? Republican?</i>

175
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,036
<i>What religion is she?</i>

176
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,409
Who is she?

177
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,476
Silvia.

178
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,914
[They speak Spanish]

179
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:40,328
Secret Service Dignitary Protection Squad.

180
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,933
We're responsible for visiting heads of state.

181
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:49,438
- I don't recall seeing you around.
- They hire us for our forgettable faces.

182
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,172
- Is she on guard?
- Yes, ma'am.

183
00:21:56,381 --> 00:22:01,614
Ma'am. Why is it you guys who carry guns
always sound like cowboys?

184
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,618
I don't concentrate on faces in my job.

185
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,953
But you listen to voices.

186
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,827
Do you think you could identify the voice?

187
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:18,162
Well, I'd say yes, if it were...
It was almost a whisper.

188
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:22,200
Whispers disguise the quality of a voice.

189
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,139
You, I imagine, study faces.

190
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,818
- You know, I'm not really a dignitary.
- I know.

191
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,685
How'd you happen to be up there after hours?

192
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,195
We had an evacuation.
I'd left some things in the sound booth.

193
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,734
And there just happened to be some fellas
talking about an assassination

194
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:58,274
in a language that you and eight other people
understand, in a room full of microphones.

195
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,638
Do you think I'm making it up?

196
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,739
Why would I report a threat I didn't hear?

197
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,043
- People do.
- I don't.

198
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,812
- Some people like attention.
- I don't.

199
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,585
- You don't want Zuwanie here.
- I didn't make it up.

200
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:20,026
- How do you feel about him?
- I don't care for him.

201
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,258
- Wouldn't mind if he were dead?
- If he were gone.

202
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,163
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

203
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,273
If I interpreted "gone" as "dead", I'd be fired.
If they were the same, there'd be no UN.

204
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,774
- Your profession is playing with words.
- I don't play with words.

205
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,742
- You're doing it now.
- You are.

206
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:40,577
If I wanted him dead, I wouldn't have
reported it. It's not what I want.

207
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,879
- That's not why I'm here.
- Here?

208
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,855
Working at the UN, instead of standing
on a road somewhere with a machine-gun.

209
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,584
- You believe in diplomacy?
- I believe in this place.

210
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:55,961
- I believe in what it tries to accomplish.
- Well, you've had a tough year, lady.

211
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,101
Listen.

212
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:04,163
I'm scared, and my protector
is someone who doesn't believe me.

213
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,371
You don't look scared.

214
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,105
People handle fear in different ways, Mr Keller.

215
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:15,582
It turns some people into stand-up comedians.
You don't know me at all.

216
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:22,588
Maybe I should see about assigning someone
to look after me who's better suited to the job.

217
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,819
I don't look after you,

218
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,933
I look after the man who's been
threatened, if there was a threat.

219
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,969
My job, as it concerns you,
is to investigate you.

220
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,607
So you're not here to offer me
any protection whatsoever?

221
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,971
No, ma'am.

222
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,545
And we were getting along so well.

223
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,917
- So what do you think?
- She's a liar.

224
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:09,772
Agent Keller? Morning.
Special Agent Lewis, FBI. This is Agent King.

225
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,310
We're on loan.

226
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:17,448
So they have to be returned
in the same condition, or no refund.

227
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,311
- Keller.
- Woods.

228
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,786
- Are you sure you're ready to come back?
- I'm better working.

229
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,858
- We got a credible threat?
- We should assume so.

230
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:38,160
As popular as we are in the rest of the world,

231
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,306
the last thing we need is to have
a foreign leader get popped here,

00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:45,499
particularly a guy like this that we don't like.

gave the people hope, and was a hero.

a madman and the UN not doing enough.

He's in exile in Brooklyn.

- Dead.

00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:22,457
- I want to split that.
- When do I know the results?

305
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,501
Right away.
You know when you're lying, don't you?

306
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:38,344
Look straight ahead, feet flat on the floor.

307
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,245
Is your name Silvia Broome?

308
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:43,713
Miss Broome?

309
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:47,049
I found out something from our domestic Intel.

310
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,055
All this may have begun with a tragic accident.

311
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,525
- What do you mean?
- Her parents farmed in the mountains.

312
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:56,700
This area became infested
with rebels in the '80s

313
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,529
and Dr Zuwanie was forced to mine the roads.

314
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:04,174
Her parents were bringing her younger sister
back from school and hit a mine.

315
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,037
- And they were killed?
- All of them.

316
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,145
- How old was she?
- 12, 13.

317
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,281
Something like that, even years later,
could incite all kinds of ideas.

318
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,896
She has every reason
to want Dr Zuwanie tried at the ICC.

319
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,002
I'll be right back.

320
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:42,779
- Oh, no. Come on.
- OK, the control questions show stress,

321
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,440
and the key questions show stress
as well as the baseline questions.

322
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,552
We should just read her palm.

323
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:55,923
- How did I do?
- <i>Je ne sais pas</i>.

324
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,461
Nils Lud. Dr Zuwanie's head of security.

325
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:08,232
I thought since you were in a
question-answering mood, I might ask a few.

326
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:13,141
Might I ask where you stand now
politically, Miss Broome?

327
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:19,247
I'm for peace and quiet, Mr Lud.
It's why I came to the UN. Quiet diplomacy.

328
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,578
With respect, you only interpret.

329
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,488
Countries have gone to war
after misinterpreting one another.

330
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,389
I would say she's clearly under stress,
but not necessarily lying.

331
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,958
Congratulations.

332
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:40,331
- I'm told what you heard was a whisper.
- Yes.

333
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:44,736
Is it possible you could identify it
if you ever heard it again?

334
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,337
It might be.

335
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,310
Tell me, do you have a brother?

336
00:35:55,853 --> 00:36:00,756
I hope it's all right. I took this opportunity
to ask Miss Broome a few questions.

337
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,785
You're free to go.
Agent Scott will drive you back to the UN.

338
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,796
Would you drive Ms Broome
back to the UN, please? Thank you.

339
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:17,100
- Does this mean the test was...?
- The test was inconclusive.

340
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:21,642
But I'd rather make the mistake
of believing her than the bigger one of not.

341
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:27,807
Next time you want to question an
American citizen here, you ask permission.

342
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,220
- Silvia.
- Don't worry, I'm not leaving any...

343
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:37,155
Did you do something naughty?
A couple of FBls were asking me about you.

344
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:43,156
If you often work later than everybody,
or bring things in after hours. Like that.

345
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:49,871
- What'd you tell them?
- I said, from a sound engineer's point of view,

346
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,234
you're perfect.

347
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,977
I need somebody on the guy with two names.

348
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:57,204
- Mo.
- It's one name twice. Kuman-Kuman.

349
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,609
You volunteering, or just correcting me?

350
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,217
- I'm from Brooklyn.
- You got him. You and...?

351
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:06,913
- I was on him when he first came here.
- OK, you got him again.

352
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,422
I thought she had perfect pitch.

353
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,255
She says whispers
don't have a recognisable pitch.

354
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,260
NSA agrees. They say it's very difficult.

355
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,933
- They don't know that.
- They say they do.

356
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:21,866
No, not NSA. Whoever she heard.

357
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,774
Why not let them keep thinking she can ID it?

358
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:31,445
- What are you asking me to do, Jay?
- I don't want her to be harmed.

359
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:36,985
In fact, get a place, keep an eye on her.
We got three days. She's your only link.

360
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,088
Are we using her as bait?

361
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,826
Just make the calls.

362
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:48,021
I'm sending you an attachment.
Can you print front and back?

363
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:52,901
I've asked INS for a list of arrivals
in the last six months.

364
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,063
<i>Zimbabwe, Botswana, Matobo</i>.
<i>I'll do voice samples on everyone</i>.

365
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,905
So when she hears the voice again,
she can identify it.

366
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:06,072
- She said it was a whisper.
- Well, now she thinks she can do it.

367
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:11,010
- Photo there yet?
- It's printing. Let me put you on speaker.

368
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,529
That's an anti-Zuwanie rally.
The man speaking is Ajene Xola.

369
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,857
Look at the crowd.

370
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,769
<i>Look closely</i>.

371
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,643
Any leads?

372
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,977
Maybe one.

373
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,347
Come on down to Mexico.

374
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,890
Is that you?

375
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,401
Tell me what someone like you

376
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:41,168
who uses the word "diplomacy"
like she's chastising me

377
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,244
is doing at a rebel rally?

378
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:47,076
- A peace rally.
- I don't want to do this again.

379
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:51,243
That's exactly what it is.
What I'm doing is listening.

380
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,184
After that. After you listen.

381
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,259
- You're asking the wrong question.
- It's one you don't want to answer.

382
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:02,057
Why would somebody type the names
of everyone in this on the back?

383
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:05,235
This is a death list.

384
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:12,136
The question you should be asking is,
"Who gave me this and why?"

385
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,273
- What are you not saying?
- What are you accusing me of?

386
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:23,476
How do you feel about Zuwanie,
never mind "I don't care for him"?

387
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,814
I feel disappointment.

388
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,685
That's a lover's word.

389
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,023
What about rage?

390
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,666
Of all the people I've looked into
since this thing started,

391
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:43,135
the one with the darkest
Zuwanie history is you.

392
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,545
- It was his land-mines that killed your...
- Sh!

393
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,207
We don't name the dead.

394
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,944
Everyone who loses somebody
wants revenge,

395
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,885
on God if they can't find anyone else.

396
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,584
But in Africa,

397
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:11,891
in Matobo, the Ku believe that
the only way to end grief is to save a life.

398
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,963
If someone is murdered,

399
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:22,407
a year of mourning ends with a ritual
that we call the Drowning Man Trial.

400
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:28,449
There's an all-night party beside a river.
At dawn, the killer is put in a boat.

401
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:34,147
He's taken out on the water and he's
dropped. He's bound so that he can't swim.

402
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:38,192
The family of the dead then has to choose.
They can let him drown,

403
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,386
or they can save him.

404
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,328
The Ku believe that if the family
lets the killer drown,

405
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:51,838
they'll have justice
but spend the rest of their lives in mourning.

406
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:58,781
But if they save him,
if they admit that life isn't always just...

407
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,420
...that very act can take away their sorrow.

408
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,625
Vengeance is a lazy form of grief.

409
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,704
Why do you look away?

410
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:32,239
There are things I don't like to talk about
and you call it lying.

411
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,549
But not when you do it.

412
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,115
I'm not the one under investigation.

413
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,290
That was a long time ago.

414
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,801
- <i>FBI</i>.
- <i>Intel</i>.

415
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,409
- TTF.
- Sniper team.

416
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,739
Secret Service.

417
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:40,906
This is Nils Lud,
head of Dr Zuwanie's security.

418
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,779
Shall we take a walk?

419
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:47,856
[She plays haunting melodic tune]

420
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:59,897
- How close can a vehicle get over here?
- Not close enough.

421
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:04,063
- No garage under the GA.
- Dogs sweep every night. It's not a bomb.

422
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,370
- It has to be a rifle.
- From where?

423
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,478
How does he get a rifle in?

424
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:22,951
- Could be from up close.
- Who gets that close?

425
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,788
One of Zuwanie's bodyguards?

426
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:31,332
That's a good thought, but we'd much prefer
to kill him at home without you watching.

427
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,526
It's already here.

428
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:38,771
If these guys know their stuff,
the weapon is here.

429
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,990
<i>[Phone rings]</i>

430
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,661
Hello?

431
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,596
- <i>[line crackles</i> - <i>no voice]</i>
- Hello, Philippe? Hello?

432
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,631
[She screams]

433
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:30,625
No prints on the door
and negative for latex dust.

434
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,126
- Nothing on the door?
- No.

435
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,890
- No forced entry.
- Did Doug not see him?

436
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:41,560
No, he missed it.
Some lady called 911, saw the guy.

437
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,707
Go easy on him, OK? He feels terrible.

438
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:51,981
On the roof. He must have gone over the roof
to get to the next building.

439
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:56,585
- I couldn't see the fire escape.
- Give me that.

440
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,088
You mean you screwed up.

441
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:04,886
- I mean I screwed up.
- So did I.

442
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,733
I need Polaroids of that, inside and out.

443
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:15,160
- You OK?
- Great.

444
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:18,398
- Who else has a key to this apartment?
- No one.

445
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,669
- You don't keep a spare outside somewhere?
- No.

446
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,870
- No one else has a key...
- Nobody.

447
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,675
- The door wasn't forced.
- They can't pick locks?

448
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:30,251
They can, we can tell. They didn't.

449
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,581
- Where do you keep your key?
- My purse.

450
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,816
- It hasn't been out of your sight all day?
- No.

451
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,329
Yes.

452
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,001
In my locker.

453
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:50,799
Dot. Wake up Rory, have him dust her locker
and those beside it before morning.

454

So you were just having a quiet evening,
some gentleman in a mask waves to you.

That's about it, yeah.

Dot?

Is there anything special about this mask?

459
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:15,963
I'll be honest with you.
I don't know how honest I can be with you.

460
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:21,236
My brother gave it to me.

461
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:26,066
I still have a brother there
who I'm close to. Simon.

462
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:33,238
We've... lost touch for a while,
but... we're close.

463
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:39,411
Is he standing on the road somewhere with
a machine-gun, or is he into diplomacy, too?

464
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,591
He's more into lists.

465
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,988
Farm kids will do anything
to amuse themselves. Mostly you fight.

466
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,592
I read. My brother kept lists.

467
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:54,066
Weird lists in ratty notebooks.

468
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:57,206
Times and dates that Mum used the F-word,

469
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:01,207
countries with advantageous
male to female ratios,

470
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,879
odd animal facts.

471

Did you know the leading cause of death
for beavers is falling trees?

472

- Yes.
- You did not.

473
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,282
He had a notebook for words that he liked.

474
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:20,088
Hypotenuse, doodad, bodacious.

475

Could he be involved in this?

476

We're stuck, aren't we? You and I?

We're <i>kepéla</i>.

It means standing on
opposite sides of the river.

NYPD'll keep an eye on you until morning.

Thank you.

488
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,755
My wife was killed two weeks ago.

489
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:36,464
She... she'd left me.

490
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:43,905
She'd left me before,
but she'd always come back.

491

She was going to come back this time.

492
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,835
She said.

493
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,350
She was a dancer.

494
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:03,050
The guy was a dancer, too.

495

496
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,762
Great dancer.

497
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:12,958
Lousy driver.

498
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,502
The only way he knew how to stop a car

499
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:21,234
was to slam it
into a bridge abutment in Santa Fe.

500
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,042
So there was no taking her back this time.

501
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:36,448
The thing is, if he had lived,
and I had a choice...

502
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,765
...I think I would have let him drown.

503
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:50,202
I might have even
held his head under the water.

504
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,205
Not a very Ku thing to do.

505
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:12,628
If you need anything, you can call the precinct
or just go downstairs.

This is my cell number.

It's a remodel. Owner's in the middle
of a divorce. We got lucky.

511
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,796
We got a clear view.
Front door's 50 seconds away.

- Are Lewis and Clark babysitting Kuman?

513

No. There won't be time for a second one.

01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,935
I can go home and get a good night's sleep.

608
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:23,963
Unless you want me to stay.

609
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:27,799
No. Thanks.

610
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:31,468
- Thanks.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

<i>United Nations, New York. Protests</i>

613
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:45,551
<i>The exiled leader Kuman-Kuman</i>
<i>rallied today's protesters</i>.

614

615
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,523
<i>He doesn't even have to die</i>.

616
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,531
<i>An almost-assassinated leader</i>

- Keller.
- <i>[Silvia] I'm sorry</i>.

621
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:11,948
I really didn't know you were watching me...

622
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:17,155
...<i>or I wouldn't have just</i>...<i>left like that</i>.

623
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:23,054
- You want to tell me what happened?
- <i>I had to meet someone</i>.

624
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,534
- Philippe Broullet.
- If you knew, why did you ask?

625
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:32,731
I know his name, I know he's
a photographer for a French magazine.

626
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:36,935
- He needed to talk to me.
- Now you're watching TV, unable to sleep.

627
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,774
- What did he say?
- How do you know I'm...?

628
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,211
Are you over there?

629
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,222
Jesus.

630
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:58,624
He told me we lost a friend.

631
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:03,295
He lost a friend.
I... lost someone I loved once.

632
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:07,304
It was a long time ago.

633
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,376
You can't sleep either.

634
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,709
I don't know why I'm calling you.

635
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:19,877
- What do you do when you can't sleep?
- I stay awake.

636
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:28,559
You don't name the dead, you said. Why?

637
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:32,126
What... what happens?

638
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:37,769
You move past them. You leave them behind.

639
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:42,801
You can do that,
but you have to be ready to let them go.

640
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:44,775
To move on.

641
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:49,680
You've been going through hell.

642
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,478
Keeping busy.

643
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:57,787
You, too, I think. I don't know all of it, but...

644
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:09,999
Are you going to be there until morning?

645
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:12,299
It almost is morning.

646
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,776
Yeah, I'll be here.

647
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:20,980
Is it OK if I just try to fall asleep
over the phone?

648
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:28,957
That's fine.

649
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,138
Goodnight.

650
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,823
<i>She's coming your way</i>.

651
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:10,592
Oh, no. No scooter, please.
Come on, no scooter.

652
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,200
Yes. Thank you, God.

653
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:27,443
You might as well drive me.
We're going to Brooklyn.

654
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,344
Corner of Bergen and Nostrand.

655
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:36,014
Jad Jamal. Worked the interpreters' lounge
the day the mask showed up.

656
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:39,717
- Bring him to me.
- Can't. He didn't show up for work.

657
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:41,920
- Sit on his apartment.
- Doug's there.

658
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,463
Hey. Got the INS files.

659
01:06:55,411 --> 01:07:00,246
- This isn't the way it's supposed to be done.
- You can let me off up here.

660
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:22,836
<i>She's at the corner of Bergen</i>
<i>and Nostrand in Brooklyn</i>.

661
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,304
- She's where?
- My guy's on the move.

662
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,939
<i>She's here, whether I brought her or not</i>.

663
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:33,638
- Go back. What's she doing?
- <i>Waiting for something</i>.

664
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:36,283
- Holy shit.
- What?

665
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:38,783
The janitor. Jad Jamal.

666
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:42,617
- That's not him.
- I know. That's his room-mate.

667
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,871
Jamal's room-mate just left the building.

668
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,768
His name is Gamba. Jean Gamba.

669
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:02,375
- Should I stay here?
- No, you stick with the room-mate.

670
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:05,547
- Are we working on a warrant?
- Lewis is.

671
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:08,045
- How are you?
- I got something for you.

672
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:11,048
OK, bless you.

673
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,020
Tobin?

674
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:01,568
- What's up?
- I don't know, but it don't feel good.

675
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,200
- What are they doing?
- Just standing there.

676
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:16,342
<i>We're getting on the el</i>.

677
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:26,053
[Speaks Ku]

678
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,160
- Shit.
- She just got on the bus with Kuman.

679
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,864
[Tobin] What the hell is she doing?
