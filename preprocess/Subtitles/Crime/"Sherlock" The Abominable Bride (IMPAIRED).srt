1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,400
The name's Sherlock Holmes and
the address is 221B Baker Street.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,760
Afternoon.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,080
Yeah.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,040
He's always like that.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,920
WHIPS AND POUNDS

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,200
Bad day was it?

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,680
Since yesterday you've moved in with him
and now you're solving crimes together.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,320
- Mwah!
- Look at you, all happy, it's not decent.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,280
Who cares about decent? The game,
Mrs Hudson, is on!

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,200
Don't make people into heroes, John.
Heroes don't exist and, if they
did, I wouldn't be one of them.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,400
I will burn the HEART out of you.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,720
Right, this should do it.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,360
- Are you wearing any pants? - No. - OK.

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,040
THEY CHUCKLE

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,720
This is how I want you to remember me,
the woman who beat you.

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,760
But there never was any monster.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,080
HOWLING

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,240
- Sherlock?
- Here we are, at last.

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,760
Argh! GUNSHOT

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,720
Goodbye, John. - Sherlock!
'Those things will kill you.'

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,280
Oh, you bastard!

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,160
The thrill of the chase, the
blood pumping through your veins,

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,600
just the two of us against
the rest of the world.

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,200
Wait!

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,160
We're going to need to coordinate.

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,840
I asked you for one more miracle.

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,280
- I asked you to stop being dead.
- I heard you.

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,960
Shut up! You are not a puzzle solver,
you never have been.

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,280
You're a drama queen!

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,960
Now there is a man in
there about to die.

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,880
The game is on, solve it!

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,200
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,480
No chance for you to be a
hero this time, Mr Holmes.

34
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,320
I'm a high-functioning sociopath!

35
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,520
GUNSHOT

36
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,720
There is no prison in which we
could incarcerate Sherlock without

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,800
causing a riot on a daily basis.

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,720
The alternative, however,
would require your approval.

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,800
To the very best of times, John.

40
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,280
- -
- Did you miss me?

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,760
- -
- Did you miss me?

42
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,840
How is this possible?

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
- How is the exile going?
- I've only been gone four minutes.

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,680
Well, I certainly hope
you've learnt your lesson.

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,080
Who needs me this time?

46
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,320
Miss me?

47
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,600
England.

48
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
SHELL WHINES

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,520
"The Second Afghan War brought
honours and promotion to many.

50
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,360
"But, for me, it meant nothing
but misfortune and disaster."

All right, Captain.

60
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,240
Watson!

61
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,880
Stamford.

62
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,320
Remember?

63
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,480
We were at Barts together.

64
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,640
Yes, of course. Stamford.

65
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,920
Good Lord! Where have you been?

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,640
You're as thin as a rake!

67
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,680
I made it home.
Many weren't so lucky.

68
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,680
So what now?

69
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,800
I need a place to live.

70
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,760
Somewhere decent at an
affordable price. It's not easy.

71
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,360
STAMFORD CHUCKLES

72
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,760
You know, you're the second
person to say that to me today.

73
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,080
Hmm? Who was the first?

74
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,320
POUNDING

75
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,720
Good Lord.

76
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,520
It's an experiment, apparently.

77
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,800
Beating corpses to establish how
long after death bruising is

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,000
still possible.

79
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,760
Is there a medical point to that?

80
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,520
Not sure.

81
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,320
Neither am I. So, where's
this friend of yours, then?

82
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,720
POUNDING CONTINUES

83
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,000
Excuse me.

84
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,960
I do hope we're not interrupting.

85
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,520
You've been in Afghanistan,
I perceive.

86
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,080
Dr Watson, Mr Sherlock...

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,920
Excellent reflexes, you'll do.

88
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,680
I'm sorry...?

89
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,280
I have my eye on a suite of rooms near
Regent's Park. Between
us we could afford them.

90
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,000
Rooms? Who said
anything about rooms?

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,960
I did, I mentioned it this morning,
I was in need of a fellow lodger.

92
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,920
Now he appears after lunch in the
company of a man of military aspect

93
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,000
with a tan and a recent injury,
both suggestive

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,920
of the campaign in Afghanistan and
an enforced departure from it.

95
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,680
The conclusion seemed inescapable. We'll
finalise the details tomorrow evening.

96
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,040
Now, if you'll excuse me,

97
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,960
I have a hanging in Wandsworth and
I'd hate them to start without me.

98
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,680
- A hanging?
- I take a professional interest.

99
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,080
I also play the violin and smoke a pipe.
I presume that's not a problem.

100
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,400
- Er, no, well...
- And you're clearly acclimatized to never getting

101
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,080
to the end of a sentence.
We'll get along splendidly.

102
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,320
Tomorrow evening,
seven o'clock, then.

103
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,560
Oh, and the name is Sherlock Holmes

104
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,160
and the address is 221B,
Baker Street.

105
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,280
Yes...he's always been like that.

106
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,240
Papers! Papers!

107
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Papers! Papers!

108

CAROL SINGING IN BACKGROUND

109
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,960
- Here, how's The Blue Carbuncle doing?
- Very popular, Dr Watson.

110
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,320
Is there going to be a
proper murder next month?

111
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,400
I'll have a word with
the criminal classes.

112
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,560
If you wouldn't mind.

113
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,720
Is that him? Is he in there?

114
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,640
- THUD
- Ow! No.

115
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,960
No, no, not at all.
Er, good day to you.

116
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,040
Let on, walk.

117
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,680
Merry Christmas, Mr Holmes!

118
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,680
Mr Holmes!

119
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,840
I do wish you'd let me know when
you're planning to come home!

120
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,080
I hardly knew myself, Mrs Hudson.

121
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,880
That's the trouble with
dismembered country squires.

122
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,080
They're notoriously
difficult to schedule.

123
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,800
- What's in there?
- Never mind.

124
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,120
Thank you.

125
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,880
Did you catch the murderer,
Mr Holmes?

126
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,120
Caught the murderer, still looking for
the legs. I think we'll call it a draw.

127
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,000
And I noticed you've published
another of your stories, Dr Watson.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,920
Yes, did you enjoy it?

129
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,680
No.

130
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,120
Oh?

131
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,200
- I never enjoy them.
- Why not?

132
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,520
Well, I never say anything, do I?

133
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,280
According to you,
I just show people up the stairs

134
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,560
and serve you breakfasts.

135
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,920
Well, within the narrative, that is,
broadly speaking, your function.

136
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,640
My what?!

137
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,480
- Don't feel singled out, Mrs Hudson, I'm hardly in the dog one.
- "The dog one?"

138
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,920
I'm your landlady,
not a plot device.

139
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,760
Do you mean The Hound
Of The Baskervilles?

140
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,400
And you make the rooms
so drab and dingy.

141
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,920
Oh, blame it on the illustrator,
he's out of control!

142
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,520
I've had to grow this moustache
just so people will recognise me.

143
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,920
"Over the many years it has
been my privilege to record

144

Mr Sherlock Holmes,

145
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,240
"it has sometimes been difficult

146
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,520
"cases to set before my readers.

147
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,520

149
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,280

physical extremes

151

152

Good Lord!

153
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,840
Mrs Hudson, there is a
woman in my sitting room!

154
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,800
Is it intentional?

155
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,120
She's a client. Said you were out,
insisted on waiting.

156
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,520
Would you, er, care to sit down?

157
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,840
Didn't you ask her what she wanted?

158
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,320
You ask her!

159
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,640
Why didn't YOU ask her?

160
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,600
How could I, what with me
not talking and everything?!

161
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,120
Oh, for God's sake,
give her some lines,

162
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,720
she's perfectly capable
of starving us!

163
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,560
Good afternoon. I am Sherlock Holmes,
this is my friend and colleague, Dr Watson.

164
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,840
- You may speak freely in front of him, as he rarely understands a word.
- Holmes!

165
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,840
However, before you do, allow me
to make some trifling observations.

166
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,400
You have an impish sense of humour,

167
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,920
which currently you are deploying to
ease a degree of personal anguish.

168
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,840
You have recently married a man
of a seemingly kindly disposition,

169
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,040
who has now abandoned you

170
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,680
for an unsavoury companion
of dubious morals.

171
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,040
You have come to this
agency as a last resort,

172
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,880
in the hope that reconciliation
may still be possible.

173
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,440
Good Lord, Holmes!

174
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,080
All of this is, of course, perfectly
evident from your perfume.

175
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,240
Her perfume?

176
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,520
Yes, her perfume, which brings
insight to me and disaster to you.

177
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,960
How so?

178
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,160
Because I recognised
it and you did not.

179
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,520
- Mary!
- John.

180
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,440
Why, in God's name,
are you pretending to be a client?

181
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,240
Because I could think of no other
way to see my husband, husband.

182
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,920
VIOLIN PLAYS

183
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,040
It was an affair of
international intrigue.

184
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,520
- It was a murdered country squire.
- Nevertheless, matters were pressing.

185
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,280
- I don't mind you going, my darling, I mind you leaving me behind.
- But what could you do?!

186
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,760
Well, what do you do, except wander
around taking notes, looking surprised?!

187
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,640
VIOLIN SCREECHES Enough!

188
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,280
The stage is set,
the curtain rises.

189
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,800
We are ready to begin.

190
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,040
Begin what?

191
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Sometimes to solve a case,
one must first solve another.

192
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,680
- Oh, you have a case, then, a new one?
- An old one, very old.

193
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,200
I shall have to go deep.

194
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,960
Deep? Into what?

195
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,360
Myself.

196
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,080
Lestrade! Do stop loitering
by the door and come in.

197
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,720
How did you know it was me?

198
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,840
The regulation tread
is unmistakable.

199
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,400
Lighter than Jones,
heavier than Gregson.

200
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,720
I, I just came up... Mrs Hudson
didn't seem to be talking.

201
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,280
I fear she has branched
into literary criticism

202
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,640
by means of satire.

203
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,480
It is a distressing trend
in the modern landlady.

204
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,120
What brings you here
in your off-duty hours?

205
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,960
- How do you know I'm off duty?
- Well, since your arrival,

206
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,720
you've addressed over 40% of
your remarks to my decanter.

207
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,200
Watson, give the Inspector
what he so clearly wants.

208
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,840
So...Lestrade,
what can we do for you?

209
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,360
Oh, I'm not here on business,
I just thought I'd drop by.

210
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,520
A social call?

211
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:03,320
Yeah, of course, just to wish you
the compliments of the season.

212
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,240
Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

213
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,560
Thank God that's over.

214
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,160
Now, Inspector, what strange
happening compels you

215
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,280
to my door, but
embarrasses you to relate?

216
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,800
Who said anything happened?

217
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,480
You did. By every means
short of actual speech.

218
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Holmes,
you have misdiagnosed.

219
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,880
Then, correct me, Doctor.

220
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,960
He didn't WANT a drink,
he needed one.

221
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,600
He's not embarrassed, he's afraid.

222
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,200
My Boswell is learning.
They do grow up so fast.

223
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,720
Watson, restore the
courage of Scotland Yard.

224
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,360
Inspector, do sit down.

225
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,440
I'm, I'm not afraid, exactly.

226
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,800
Fear is wisdom in
the face of danger,

227
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,520
it is nothing to be ashamed of.

228
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,080
Thank you.

229
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,680
From the beginning, then.

230
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,360
BANG

231
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,920
BULLETS WHISTLE

232
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,040
You!

233
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,680
No, please!

234
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,600
You?!

235
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,360
GUNSHOTS

236
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,480
A moment.

237
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,040
GUNSHOT

238
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,920
When was this?

239
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,840
Yesterday morning.

240
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,480
The bride's face,
how was it described?

241
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,320
"White as death,
mouth like a crimson wound."

242
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,240
Poetry or truth?

243
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,680
Many would say they're
the same thing.

244
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,800
Yes, idiots. Poetry or truth?

245
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,080
I saw her face myself. Afterwards.

246
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,440
After what?

247
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,000
You?

248
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,360
Or me?

249
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,920
GUNSHOT

250
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,640
SCREAMING

251
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,600
Oh, really, Lestrade, a woman
blows her own brains out in public

252
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,960
and you need help identifying
the guilty party?

253
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,720
I feel Scotland Yard
has reached a new low.

254
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,160
That's not why I'm here.

255
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,120
- I surmised.
- What was her name, the bride?

256
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,040
Emelia Ricoletti. Yesterday
was her wedding anniversary.

257
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,200
The police, of course, were called.

258
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,720
And her body taken to the morgue.

259
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,880
Standard procedure. Why are you
telling us what may be presumed?

260
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,120
Because of what happened next.

261
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,480
Limehouse. Just a few hours later.

262
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,640
CHURCH BELLS TOLL

263
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,040
Thomas Ricoletti.
Emelia Ricoletti's husband.

264
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,480
Presumably on his way to the
morgue to identify her remains?

265
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,400
As it turned out,
he was saved the trip.

266
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,560
HORSES WHINNY

267
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,320
# Do not forget me

268
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,440
# Do not forget me

269
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,320
# Remember the maid... #

270
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,800
Who are you?

271
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
# The maid of the mill... #

272
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,840
Why are you doing this?
Just tell me who you are!

273
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,000
You recognise our song, my dear?

274
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,480
I sang it at our wedding.

275
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,120
- HE SHIVERS
- Emelia?

276
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,560
You, you're dead,
you can't be here, you died!

277
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,080
Am I not beautiful, Thomas?

278
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,640
As beautiful as the
day you married me?

279
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,040
Who...

280
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,840
What the hell is all this about?!

281
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,640
What does it look like,
my handsome friend?

282
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,040
It's a shotgun wedding.

283
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,480
GUNSHOT

284
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,000
THUD

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,840
Till death us do part.
Twice in this case.

286
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,960
SCREAMING

287
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,800
HE BLOWS WHISTLE

288
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,480
Extraordinary.

289
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,120
Impossible.

290
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,440
Superb.

291
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,680
Suicide as street theatre, murder by corpse.
Lestrade, you're spoiling us.

292
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,240
Watson, your hat and coat.
Where are we going? - To the morgue.

293
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,640
There's not a moment to lose,
which one can so rarely say of a morgue.

294
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,000
And am I just to sit here?

295
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,680
Not at all, my dear.
We'll be hungry later.

296
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,160
Holmes, just one thing,
tweeds in a morgue?

297
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,800
Needs must when the
devil drives, Watson.

298
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,200
Ma'am.

299
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,400
I'm part of a campaign, you know.

300
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,880
Oh, campaign?

301
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,000
Votes for women.

302
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,680
And are you for or against?

303
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,160
Get out.

304
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
SHE SIGHS

305
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,040
DOOR KNOCKS

306
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,520
Ooh-ooh!

307
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,640
Oh, have they gone off again,
have they?

308
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,360
I don't know, what a life
those gentlemen lead.

309
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,360
Huh, yes. Those gentlemen

310
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,680
Oh, never you mind.

311
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,280
Oh, almost forgot,
that came for you.

312
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,560
Oh.

313
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,120
Mrs Hudson, tell my
husband I'll be home late,

314
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,440
I have some urgent business.

315
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,000
Is everything all right?

316
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,240
Oh, you know, just a,
er, friend in need.

317
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh, dear. What friend?

318
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,760
England.

319
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,200
Well, that's not very specific.

320
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,200
Who's on mortuary duty?

321
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,600
You know who.

322
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,440
Always him.

323
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,200
HORSE NEIGHS

324
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,400
Please tell me which
idiot did this!

325
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,120
It's for everyone's safety.

326
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,520
This woman is dead,
half her head is missing.

327
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,440
She's not a threat to anyone.

328
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,320
Tell that to her husband,
he's under a sheet over there.

329
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,720
Whatever happened in
Limehouse last night, I think

330
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,360
we can safely assume it wasn't
the work of a dead woman.

331
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,720
Stranger things have happened.

332
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,640
Such as...?

333
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,080
Well... Strange things.

334
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,520
You're speaking like a child.

335
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,040
This is clearly man's work.
Where is he?

336
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,080
DOOR OPENS

337
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,160
Holmes.

338
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,720
Hooper.

339
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,520
You, back to work!

340
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,400
So, come to astonish us with
your magic tricks, I suppose?

341
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,840
Is there anything to which you
would like to draw my attention?

342
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,680
Nothing at all, Mr Holmes.

343
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,840
You may leave any time you like.

344
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,800
Dr Hooper, I asked Mr Holmes
to come here. Cooperate.

345
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,200
That's an order.

346
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,400
There are two
"features of interest",

347
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,720
as you are always saying
in Dr Watson's stories.

348
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,080
I never say that.

349
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,960
You do, actually, quite a lot.

350
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,840
First of all, this is
definitely Emelia Ricoletti.

351
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,240
She has been
categorically identified.

352
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,440
Beyond a doubt, it is her.

353
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
Then who was that in
Limehouse last night?

354
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,040
That was also Emelia Ricoletti.

355
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,160
It can't have been.
She was dead, she was here.

356
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,560
She was positively identified by her
own husband, seconds before he died.

357
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,280
He had no reason to lie,
could hardly have been mistaken.

358
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,200
The cabbie knew her, too,
there's no question it's her.

359
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,040
But she can't have been in two
places at the same time, can she?

360
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,320
No, Watson, one place is strictly
the limit for the recently deceased.

361
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,360
- Holmes!
- CLICKS FINGERS

362
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,040
- Could it have been twins? - No. - Why not?

363
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,680
Because it's never twins.

364
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,920
Emelia was not a twin,
nor did she have any sisters.

365
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,720
She had one older brother
who died four years ago.

366
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,560
Hmm, maybe it was a secret twin.

367
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,160
A what?!

368
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,600
A secret twin.

369
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,280
Hmm? You know?

370
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,720
A twin that nobody knows about.

371
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,680
This whole thing could
have been planned.

372
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,080
Since the moment of conception.
How breathtakingly prescient of her.

373
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,080
- It is never twins, Watson!
- Then what's your theory?

374
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,680
More to the point,
what's your problem?

375
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,120
- I, I don't understand...
- Why were you so frightened?

376
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,640
Nothing so far has justified
your assault on my decanter,

377
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,480
and why have you allowed a dead
woman to be placed under arrest?

378
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,240
Ah, that would be the
other feature of interest.

379
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,000
A smear of blood on her finger.

380
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,440
That could have happened
any number of ways.

381
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
Indeed. There's one other thing.

382
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,520
It wasn't there earlier.

383
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,600
Neither was that.

384
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,480
You!

385
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,200
You?

386
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,000
You?!

387
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,840
Holmes?

388
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,160
Gun in the mouth,
a bullet through the brain...

389
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,520
Back of the head blown clean off.

390
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
How could he survive?

391
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,640
"She", you mean.

392
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,440
I'm sorry?

393
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,320
Not "he", "she".

394
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,840
Yes, yes of course.

395
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,480
HE STARTS

396
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,520
Well, thank you all for
a fascinating case.

397
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,560
I'll send you a telegram
when I've solved it. Watson.

398
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,560
The gunshot wound was
obviously the cause of death,

399
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,120
but there are clear
indicators of consumption.

400
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,520
It might be worth a postmortem.

401
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,560
We need all the
information we can get.

402
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,360
Oh, isn't he observant,
now that Daddy's gone

403
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,680
I AM observant in some ways,
just as Holmes is quite blind in others.

404
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,160
Really?

405
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,480
Yes, really.

406
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,640
Amazing...what one has to do
to get ahead in a man's world.

407
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,160
What's he saying that for?

408
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,640
Get back to work!

409
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,720
Well, Holmes? Surely you
must have some theory?

410
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,280
Not yet. These are deep waters,
Watson, deep waters.

411
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
And I shall have
to go deeper still.

412
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,680
"It was not for several
months that we were to pick up

413
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,480
"the threads of this
strange case again.

414
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,520
"And then under very
unexpected circumstances."

415
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,640
Five of them now, all the same,
every one of them.

416
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,200
Hush, please, this is a
matter of supreme importance.

417
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,160
- What is?
- The obliquity of the ecliptic. I have to understand it.

418
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,920
- What is it?
- I don't know, I'm still trying to understand it.

419
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,160
- I thought you understood everything.
- Of course not, that would be an appalling waste of brain space.

420
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,240
I specialise. - And what's so
important about this? - What's so
important about five boring murders?

421
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,280
They're not boring. Five men dead, murdered
in their own homes, rice on the floor

422
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,200
like at a wedding, and the word
"You" written in blood on the wall!

423
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,600
It's, it's her, it's the Bride.
Somehow she's risen again.

424
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,800
- Solved it.
- You can't have solved it!

425
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,080
Of course I've solved it,
it's perfectly simple.

426
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,040
The incident of the mysterious
Mrs Ricoletti, the killer from

427
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,840
beyond the grave, has been widely
reported in the popular press.

428
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,600
Now people are disguising their
own dull little murders as the

429
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,760
work of a ghost, to confuse the
impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard.

430
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,320
There you are, solved.

431
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,240
Pay Mrs Hudson a visit on your way out,
she likes to feel involved.

432
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,840
You sure?

433
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,840
Certainly. Go away.
Watson! I'm ready.

434
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,520
Your hat and boots,
we have an important appointment.

435
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,960
Didn't Dr Watson move
out a few months ago?

436
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,720
He did, didn't he?

437
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,600
Who have I been talking
to all this time?

438
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,880
Well, speaking on behalf of the
impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard,

439
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,200
that chair is definitely empty.

440
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,160
It is, isn't it?
Works surprisingly well, though.

441
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,720
I actually thought
he was improving.

442
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,240
HE EXHALES

443
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,440
Ah. Where have you been?

444
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,680
Sorry, sir, I'm rather
behind my time this morning.

445
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,320
Are you incapable
of boiling an egg?!

446
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,840
The fires are rarely lit,
there is dust everywhere

447
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,440
and you almost destroyed my
boots scraping the mud off them.

448
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,080
If it wasn't my wife's business to deal
with the staff, I would talk to you myself.

449
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,440
- Where is my wife?
- Begging your pardon, sir, but the mistress has gone out.

450
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,760
- Out? At this hour of the morning?
- Yes, sir. Did you not know that, sir?

451
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,040
Where did she go?
She's always out these days.

452
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,120
- -
- Not unlike yourself...sir.

453
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,760
I'm sorry...?

454
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,320
- Just observing, sir.
- Well, that's quite enough, nobody asked you to be observant.

455
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,440
Sorry, sir, I just meant you're hardly
ever home together any more, sir.

456
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,400
You are dangerously
close to impertinence.

457
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,280
I shall have a word with my
wife to have a word with you.

458
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,680
Very good, sir. And when
will you be seeing her?

459
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,360
Now, listen...

460
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,160
- Oh, I nearly forgot, sir. A telegram came for you.
- You forgot?!

461
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,880
- No, I nearly forgot.
- What have you been doing all morning?

462
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,480
Reading your new one
in The Strand, sir.

463
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,040
Did you enjoy it?

464
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,640
Why do you never mention me, sir?

465
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,160
Go away.

466
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,200
- The what of the what?
- The obliquity of the ecliptic.

467
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,480
"Come at once," you said.
I assumed it was important.

468
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,760
It is.

469
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,160
It's the inclination of the earth's
equator to the path of the sun

470
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,480
on the celestial plane.

471
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,200
- You been swotting up?
Why would I do that? - To sound clever.

472
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,280
I am clever. - Oh, oh, I see.
You see what?

473
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,360
I deduce we're on our way to
see someone cleverer than you.

474
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,640
Shut up.

475
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,920
Sh...

476
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,920
Sorry, what? Oh.

477
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,840
To anyone who wishes to study mankind,
this is the spot.

478
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,520
Handy really, as your ever-expanding
backside is permanently glued to it.

479
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,040
- Good morning, brother mine.
- Sherlock. Dr Watson.

480
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,160
You look...well, sir.

481
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,880
Really? I rather thought
I looked enormous.

482
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,320
Well, now you mention it,
this level of consumption

483
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,000
is incredibly injurious
to your health.

484
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,400
Your heart... - No need to worry
on that score, Watson. - No?

485
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,000
There's only a large cavity
where that organ should reside.

486
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,880
- It's a family trait.
- Oh, I wasn't being critical.

487
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,960
If you continue like this, sir,
I give you five years at the most.

488
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,120
Five? We thought three,
did we not, Sherlock?

489
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,440
I'm still inclined to four.

490
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,360
As ever, you see but
you do not observe.

491
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,840
Note the discolouration
in the whites of my eyes,

492
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,760
the visible rings of
fat around the corneas.

493
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,360
- Yes, you're right. I'm changing my bet to three years, four months and 11 days.
- A bet?!

494
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,520
I understand your
disapproval, Watson,

495
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,920
but if he's feeling competitive, it's
perfectly within his power to die early.

496
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,920
- That's a risk you'll have to take.
- You're gambling with your own life?

497
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,080
Why not? It's so much more exciting
than gambling with others'.

498
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,800
Three years flat - if you
eat that plum pudding! - Done.

499
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,720
HE GRUNTS

500
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,560
I expected to see you a few days
ago about the Manor House case.

501
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,000
I thought you might be a
little out of your depth there.

502
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,440
No. I solved it.

503
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,920
- It was Adams, of course.
- Yes, it was Adams.

504
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,520
Murderous jealousy. He'd written a paper
for the Royal Astronomical Society

505
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,000
on the obliquity of the ecliptic,

506
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,440
- and then read another that seemed to surpass it.
- I know, I read it.

507
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,880
Did you understand it?

508
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,440
Yes, of course I understood it,
it was perfectly simple.

509
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,040
No, did you understand
the murderous jealousy?

510
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,000
It is no easy thing for a great mind
to contemplate a still greater one.

511
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,920
Did you summon me here
just to humiliate me?

512
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,320
Yes.

513
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,600
Of course not, but it is by
far the greater pleasure.

514
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,200
Then would you mind explaining
exactly why you did summon...?

515
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,000
Our way of life is under
threat from an invisible enemy.

516
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,040
One that hovers at our
elbow on a daily basis.

517
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:17,040
These enemies are everywhere...
undetected...and unstoppable.

518
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,640
Socialists?

519
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,880
Not socialists, Doctor, no.

520
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,360
- Anarchists?
- No.

521
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,800
The French? The suffragists?

522
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,560
Is there any large body of people
you're not concerned about?

523
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,240
Dr Watson is endlessly vigilant.
Elaborate...

524
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,880
No. Investigate.

525
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,600
This is a conjecture of mine,
I need you to confirm it.

526
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,120
I'm sending you a case.

527
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,920
- The Scots?
- The Scots?!

528
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,200
Are you aware of recent
theories concerning what is

529
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,480
known as paranoia?

530
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,360
Oh, sounds Serbian.

531
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,920
A woman will call on
you - Lady Carmichael.

532
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,360
I want you to take her case.

533
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,280
But these enemies,
how are we to defeat them

534
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,960
if you won't tell us about them?

535
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,960
We don't defeat them.
We most certainly lose to them.

536
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,440
Why?

537
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,120
Because they are right.
And we are wrong.

538
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,280
Lady Carmichael's case, what is it?

539
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,040
Rest assured,
it has features of interest.

540
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,440
- I never really say that.
- You really do.

541
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,600
And you've solved it already,
I assume?

542
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,760
Only in my head.
I need you for the, er, legwork.

543
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,640
Why not just tell us your solution?

544
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,240
And where would be
the sport in that?

545
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,600
Will you do it, Sherlock?

546
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,080
I can promise you a
superior distraction.

547
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,240
On one condition.
Have another plum pudding.

548
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,560
There's one on the way.

549
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,680
Two years, 11 months and four days.

550
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,200
Ha, it's getting exciting now! Ticktock,
ticktock, ticktock.

551
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,920
Thank you, Wilder.

552
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,040
Also, a Mr Melas to see you,
Mr Holmes.

553
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,760
Ah. Give me five minutes,
I have a wager to win.

554
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,200
Better make that 15.

555
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,520
Ticktock.

556
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,680
SQUELCH

557
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,640
Mr Holmes, I have
come here for advice.

558
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,800
- That is easily got.
- And help.

559
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,760
Not always so easy.

560
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,080
Something has happened,
Mr Holmes, something...unusual

561
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,040
and...terrifying.

562
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,320
Then you are in luck.

563
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,800
- -
- Luck?!

564
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,520
Those are my specialisms. Hmm,
this is really very promising.

565
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,680
Holmes...

566
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,960
Please...do tell us what
has so distressed you.

567
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,680
I, I thought long and
hard as to what to do,

568
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,680
but then it occurred to
me that my husband was

569
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,200
an acquaintance of your brother
and that perhaps through him...

570
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,280
The fact is, I'm not sure this comes
within your purview, Mr Holmes.

571
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,480
No?

572
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,360
Lord help me, I think it may
be a matter for a priest.

573
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,600
And what does your morning
threaten, my dear?

574
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,360
A vigorous round of embroidering?

575
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,520
An exhausting appointment
at the milliners?

576
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,360
I hope you are teasing, Eustace.

577
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,240
HE CHUCKLES

578
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,640
SINISTER SCORE

579
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,840
What is it?

580
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,320
Eustace?

581
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,920
Daniel, Sophie, go out and play.

582
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,360
But, Mama...

583
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,120
Look, do as I tell you,
quickly now.

584
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,080
SHE LAUGHS

585
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,720
Well, Eustace, what does this mean?

586
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,800
Death.

587
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,520
What?

588
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,840
It means death.

589
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,640
Er, nothing, it's,
er, it's nothing.

590
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,800
I was...mistaken.

591
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,680
My dear, you've gone quite pale.

592
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,160
It's nothing!

593
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,560
Eustace...

594
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,880
'Did you keep the envelope?'

595
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,440
My husband destroyed it,
but it was blank.

596
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,600
No name or address of any kind.

597
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,160
Tell me, has Sir Eustace
spent time in America?

598
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,520
- No.
- Not even before your marriage?

599
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,360
- Well, not to my knowledge.
- Hmm.

600
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,560
Pray, continue with your
fascinating narrative.

601
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,040
Well, that incident took
place last Monday morning.

602
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,200
It was two days later
on the Wednesday

603
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,760
that my husband first saw her.

604
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,160
Who?

605
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,440
Eustace?

606
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,880
HE MOANS

607
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,240
HE WHIMPERS

608
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,840
She's come for me, Louisa!

609
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,760
Oh, God, help me,
my sins have found me out!

610
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,000
Who's come for you? Eustace,
you're frightening me.

611
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,680
Well, look, look!

612
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,320
Don't you see her?

613
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,800
No, I see no-one.

614
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,720
Gone.

615
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,560
HE WAILS

616
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,720
You keep so many secrets from me,
is this another?

617
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,880
Who have you seen?

618
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,960
It was her!

619
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,760
It was the Bride!

620
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,840
And you saw nothing?

621
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,080
Nothing.

622
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,400
- Did your husband describe...?
- Nothing, until this morning.

623
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,080
Eustace?!

624
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,600
SHE PANTS

625
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,520
Eustace?!

626
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,440
Eustace?

627
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,400
Eustace?!

628
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,960
Argh!

629
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,960
Blast!

630
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,520
Eustace?!

631
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,120
Where are you? It's me!

632
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,400
# Do not forget me

633
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,880
# Do not forget me

634
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,480
# Remember the maid

635
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,960
# The maid of the mill... #

636
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,160
Who are you?

637
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,040
I demand you speak, who are you?!

638
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,120
Eustace, speak to me.
In the name of God!

639
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,440
She's...

640
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,520
She is Emelia Ricoletti.

641
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,920
No, not you.

642
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,680
No...

643
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,480
Please!

644
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,960
This night, Eustace Carmichael,
you will die!

645
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
DRAMATIC SCORE BUILDS

646
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,360
HE GROANS

647
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,760
SHE GROANS

648
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,280
- Holmes?
- Hush, Watson.

649
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,040
But Emelia Ricoletti, the Bride.

650
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,560
- Well, you know the name?
- You must forgive Watson,

651
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,640
he has an enthusiasm for stating the
obvious, which borders on mania.

652
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,960
May I ask, how is your
husband this morning?

653
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,240
He refuses to speak
about the matter.

654
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,000
- Obviously, I have urged him to leave the house.
- No, no, he must stay exactly where he is.

655
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,600
Well, you don't think
he's in danger?

656
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,000
Oh, no, somebody definitely wants
to kill him, but that's good for us.
You can't set a trap without bait.

657
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,320
- My husband is not bait, Mr Holmes.
- No, but he could be if we play our cards right.

658
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,960
Now, listen, you must
go home immediately.

659
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,000
Dr Watson and I will
follow on the next train.

660
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,880
- There's not a moment to lose, Sir Eustace is to die tonight.
- Holmes.

661
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,280
And we should...
probably avoid that.

662
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,400
- Definitely.
- Definitely avoid that.

663
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,840
Little brother has taken
the case, of course.

664
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,320
I now rely on you to
keep an eye on things,

665
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,880
but he must never suspect
you are working for me.

666
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,880
Are you clear on that, Watson?

667
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,360
You can rely on me, Mr Holmes.

668
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,280
- You don't suppose...
- I don't and neither should you.

669
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,920
You don't know what
I was going to say.

670
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,800
You were about to suggest there
may be some supernatural agency

671
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,440
involved in this matter. And I
was about to laugh in your face.

672
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,520
But the Bride, Holmes,
Emelia Ricoletti again.

673
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,440
A dead woman walking the earth.

674
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,120
- You amaze me, Watson.
- I do?

675
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,600
Since when have you had
any kind of imagination?

676
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,800
Perhaps since I convinced
the reading public that

677
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,600
an unprincipled drug addict was
some kind of gentleman hero.

678
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,680
Yes, now you come to mention it,
that was quite impressive.

679
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,400
You may, however, rest assured
there are no ghosts in this world.

680
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,960
TRAIN WHISTLE

681
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,160
Sorry, what did you say?

682
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,400
Ghosts we make for ourselves,
what do you mean?

683
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,080
Somnambulism.

684
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,960
I beg your pardon?

685
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,560
I sleepwalk, that's all.
It's a common enough condition.

686
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,320
I thought you were a doctor!

687
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,440
The whole thing was a...bad dream.

688
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,400
Including the contents of
the envelope you received?

689
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,360
Well, that's a grotesque joke.

690
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,160
Well, that's not the impression
you gave your wife, sir.

691
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,440
- She's an hysteric, prone to fancies.
- No.

692
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,600
- I'm sorry, what did you say?
- I said no, she's not an hysteric.

693
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,920
She's a highly intelligent
woman of rare perception.

694
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,680
My wife sees terror
in an orange pip.

695
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,840
Your wife can see worlds
where no-one else can see

696
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,520
anything of value whatsoever.

697
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,720
Can she really

698
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,800
And how do you "deduce" that,
Mr Holmes?

699
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,240
She married you.

700
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,160
I assume she was capable
of finding a reason.

701
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,720
I'll do my best to save your
life tonight, but first it would

702
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,640
help if you would explain your
connection to the Ricoletti case.

703
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,240
Ricoletti?

704
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,720
Yes. In detail, please.

705
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,400
I've never heard of her.

706
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,720
Interesting. I didn't
mention she was a woman.

707
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,800
We'll show ourselves out. I hope
to see you again in the morning.

708
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,280
You will not.

709
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,680
Then sadly I shall be solving
your murder. Good day.

710
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,920
Well, you tried.

711
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,080
Will you see that Lady Carmichael
receives this. Thank you.

712
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,360
Good afternoon. - Certainly, sir.
What was that?

713
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,440
Lady Carmichael will
sleep alone tonight,

714
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,280
upon the pretence of
a violent headache.

715
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,720
All the doors and windows
of the house will be locked.

716
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,520
Ha! You think the spectre,
er, Bride,

717
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,040
will attempt to lure Sir
Eustace outside again?

718
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,360
Certainly. Why else
the portentous threat?

719
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,480
- "This night you will die!"
- Well, he won't follow her, surely?

720
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,160
Hmm, it's difficult to
say quite what he'll do.

721
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,920
- Guilt is eating away at his soul.
- Guilt? About what?

722
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,320
Something in his past.
The orange pips were a reminder.

723
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,600
- Not a joke?
- Not at all.

724
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,080
Orange pips are a traditional
warning of avenging death,

725
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,320
originating in America.

726
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,520
Sir Eustace knows
this only too well,

727
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,800
just as he knows why
he is to be punished.

728
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,920
Something to do with
Emelia Ricoletti?

729
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,600
I presume. We all have a past,
Watson. Ghosts.

730
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,880
They are the shadows that
define our every sunny day.

731
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,720
Sir Eustace knows
he's a marked man.

732
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,520
There's something more
than murder he fears.

733
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,760
He believes he is to be dragged
to hell by the risen corpse

734
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,280
of the late Mrs Ricoletti.

735
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,000
That's a lot of nonsense, isn't it?

736
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,680
God, yes. Did you
bring your revolver?

737
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,640
What good would that
be against a ghost?

738
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,480
- Exactly. Did you bring it?
- Yeah, of course.

739
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,440
Then come, Watson, come.
The game is afoot.

740
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,960
WATSON GROANS

741
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,560
- Get down, Watson, for heaven's sake!
- Sorry. Cramp.

742
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,560
- Is the lamp still burning?
- Yes.

743
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,160
There goes Sir Eustace.

744
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,200
And Lady Carmichael.

745
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,640
The house sleeps.

746
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,600
Hmm, good God, this is the
longest night of my life.

747
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,320
Have patience, Watson.

748
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,720
Only midnight.

749
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,120
You know, it's rare for us
to sit together like this.

750
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,760
I should hope so.
It's murder on the knees.

751
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,920
Two old friends just talking.
Chewing the fat.

752
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,680
Man-to-man.

753
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,400
So, a remarkable woman.

754
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,560
- Who?
- Lady Carmichael.

755
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,720
The fair sex is your
department, Watson.

756
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,240
- I'll take your word for it.
- Well, you liked her. "A woman of rare perception."

757
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,640
And admirably high arches. I noticed them
as soon as she stepped into the room.

758
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,840
- Huh, she's far too good for him.
- You think so?

759
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,400
No. You think so. I could tell.

760
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
On the contrary,
I have no view on the matter.

761
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,040
Yes, you have.

762
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,440
- Marriage is not a subject upon which I dwell.
- Oh, why not?

763
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,440
What's the matter
with you this evening?

764
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,480
That watch that you're wearing,
there's a photograph inside it.

765
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,560
I glimpsed it once.
I believe it is of Irene Adler.

766
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,200
You didn't glimpse it,
you waited till I'd fallen asleep

767
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,560
- and looked at it.
- Yes, I did.

768
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,120
- You seriously thought I wouldn't notice?
- Irene Adler.

769
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,160
Formidable opponent,
a remarkable adventure.

770
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,480
- A very nice photograph.
- Why are you talking like this?

771
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,240
- Why are you so determined to be alone?
- Are you quite well, Watson?

772
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,640
Is it such a curious question?

773
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,120
From a Viennese alienist, no.

774
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,640
From a retired Army surgeon,
most certainly.

775
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,000
Holmes, against absolutely
no opposition whatsoever,

776
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,920
- I am your closest friend.
- I concede it.

777
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,600
I am currently attempting to have

778
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,800
a perfectly normal
conversation with you.

779
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,160
Please don't.

780
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,560
Why do you need to be alone?

781
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,040
If you are referring to
romantic entanglement, Watson,

782
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,760
which I rather fear you are,
as I have often explained before,

783
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,080
all emotion is abhorrent to me.

784
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,040
It is the grit in a
sensitive instrument.

785
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,720
- The crack in the lens.
- The crack in the lens. Yes.

786
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,960
- Well, there you are, you see, I've said it all before.
- No, I wrote all that.

787
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,920
- You're quoting yourself from The Strand Magazine.
- Well, exactly.

788
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,320
Those are my words, not yours!

789
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,520
That is the version of you
that I present to the public.

790
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,600
The brain without a heart.
The calculating machine.

791
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,240
I write all of that, Holmes,
and the readers lap it up.

792
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,920
But I do not believe it.

793
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,240
- Well, I've a good mind to write to your editor.
- You are a living, breathing man.

794
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,680
- You've lived a life, you have a past.
- A what?!

795
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,920
Well, you must have had...

796
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,960
Had what?

797
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,120
- You know.
- No.

798
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,040
Experiences.

799
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,600
Pass me your revolver,
I have a sudden need to use it.

800
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,200
Damn it, Holmes, you are flesh
and blood, you have feelings,

801
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,520
you have...

802
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,200
You must have... Impulses.

803
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,680
Dear Lord, I have never been

804
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,400
so impatient to be attacked
by a murderous ghost.

805
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,920
As your friend, as someone
who worries about you...

806
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,280
..what made you like this?

807
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,480
Oh, Watson...

808
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,640
Nothing made me.

809
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,280
DOG YELPS

810
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,680
I made me.

811
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,160
Redbeard?

812
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,800
Good God!

813
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,840
What are we to do?

814
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,080
Why don't we have a chat?

815
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,080
Mrs Ricoletti, I believe!

816
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,600
A pleasant night for the
time of year, is it not?

817
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,880
It cannot be true,
Holmes, it cannot!

818
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,200
No, it can't.

819
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,520
MAN SCREAMS

820
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,720
GLASS SHATTERS

821
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,600
- Is it locked?
- As per instruction.

822
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,520
That was a window breaking,
wasn't it?

823
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,720
There's only one broken window
we need concern ourselves with.

824
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,480
- Stay here, Watson.
- What? No.

825
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,800
All the doors and windows
to the house are locked.

826
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,800
This is their only way out,
I need you here!

827
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,000
- But the sound was so close. It had to be from this side of the house.
- Stay here!

828
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,160
WOMAN WAILS

829
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,320
Oh!

830
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,760
No!

831
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,240
You promised to keep him safe.
You promised!

832
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,800
You...

833
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,200
SHE SOBS

834
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,160
CREAKING

835
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,240
BARREL CLICKS

836
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,840
CREAKING

837
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,920
HE STANDS ON GLASS

838
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,560
You're human, I know that.

839
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,200
You must be.

840
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,080
Little use us standing
here in the dark.

841
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,240
After all,
this is the 19th century.

842
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,840
WOMAN SCREAMS

843
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,000
WIND WHISTLES

844
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,600
HE PANTS

845
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,960
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

846
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,520
Do not forget me!

847
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,160
Do not forget me!

848
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,560
SHE WAILS

849
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,560
Watson!

850
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,800
- She's there! She's down there!
- Don't tell me you abandoned your post!

851
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,600
What? Holmes,
she's there, I saw her!

852
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,600
Empty, thanks to you!

853
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,240
Our bird is flown!

854
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,000
No! No, Holmes,
it wasn't what you think.

855
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,360
I saw her! The ghost!

856
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,200
THERE ARE NO GHOSTS!

857
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,400
What happened?
Where is Sir Eustace?

858
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,360
Dead.

859
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,720
You really mustn't blame
yourself, you know.

860
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,720
- No, you're quite right.
- I'm glad you're seeing sense.

861
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,400
Watson is equally culpable.

862
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,800
Between us, we've managed
to botch this whole case.

863
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,720
I gave an undertaking
to protect that man,

864
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,920
now he's lying there with
a dagger in his breast.

865
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,720
In fact, you gave an undertaking
to investigate his murder.

866
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,040
In the confident expectation
I would not have to!

867
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,680
Anything you can tell us, Doctor?

868
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,400
Well, he's been stabbed
with considerable force.

869
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,960
It's a man, then?

870
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,520
Possibly.

871
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,360
A very keen blade, so it could
conceivably have been a woman?

872
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,960
In theory, yes, but we
know who it was, I saw her.

873
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,880
- Watson!
- I saw the ghost, with my own eyes!

874
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,320
You saw nothing! You saw what
you were supposed to see!

875
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,240
You said yourself,
I have no imagination.

876
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,960
Then use your brain, such as it is,
to eliminate the impossible,

877
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,760
which in this case is the ghost,
and observe what remains, which
in this case is a solution

878
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,720
- so blindingly obvious even Lestrade could work it out!
- Thank you!

879
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,520
Forget spectres from
the other world!

880
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,160
There is only one suspect
with motive and opportunity.

881
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,560
- They might as well have left a note.
- They did leave a note.

882
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,920
And then there's the matter
of the other broken window.

883
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,280
- What other broken window?
- Precisely! There isn't one.

884
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,520
The only broken window is the one
that Watson and I entered through,

885
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,840
yet, prior to that, we
distinctly heard the sound of...

886
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,640
What did you just say? - Sorry?
About a note, what did you just say?

887
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,320
- I said the murderer DID leave a note.
- No, they didn't.

888
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,160
There's a message tied to the dagger.
You must have seen it!

889
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,840
- There's no message.
- Yes!

890
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,240
There was no message
when I found the body.

891
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,360
Holmes?

892
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,280
What is it?

893
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,760
Do you?

894
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,120
Do I what?

895
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,400
H-how did you get that?

896
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,000
I left it at the crime scene.

897
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,800
"Crime scene"? Where do you pick
up these extraordinary expressions?

898
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,520
Do you miss him?

899
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,920
Moriarty is dead.

900
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,320
And yet...?

901
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,280
His body was never recovered.

902
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,560
To be expected when one pushes a
maths professor over a waterfall.

903
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,440
Pure reason toppled
by sheer melodrama.

904
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,080
Your life in a nutshell.

905
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,520
Where do you pick up these
extraordinary expressions?

906
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,080
HE SNIFFS Have you put on weight?

907
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,720
You saw me only yesterday.
Does that seem possible?

908
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,040
No.

909
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,880
Yet here I am, increased.

910
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,240
What does that tell the foremost
criminal investigator in England?

911
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,720
In England?

912
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,080
You're in deep, Sherlock, deeper
than you ever intended to be.

913
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,320
- Have you made a list?
- Of what?

914
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,120
Everything. We will need a list.

915
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,360
Good boy.

916
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,240
No, I haven't finished yet.

917
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,280
Moriarty may beg to differ.

918
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,920
HE SIGHS

919
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,160
He's trying to distract me.
To derail me.

920
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,680
Yes.

921
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,000
He's the crack in the lens,
the fly in the ointment,

922
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,720
the virus in the data.

923
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,880
I have to finish this.

924
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,200
If Moriarty has risen from
the Reichenbach cauldron,

925
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,440
he will seek you out.

926
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,720
I'll be waiting.

927
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,400
Yes.

928
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,720
I'm very much afraid you will.

929
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,400
No, not a morsel.

930
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,240
Press are having a ruddy field day.
There's still reporters outside.

931
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,360
Oh, they've been there all the time,
I can't get rid of them.

932
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,320
I've been rushed off
my feet making tea.

933
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,280
Why do you make him tea?

934
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,200
I dunno, I just sort of do.

935
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,240
He said, "There's only one suspect,
" and then he just walks away

936
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,480
and now he won't explain.

937
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,640
Which is strange,
because he likes that bit.

938
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,240
Said it was so simple
I could solve it.

939
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,960
I'm sure he was exaggerating.

940
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,200
What's he doing, do you think?

941
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,680
- He says he's waiting.
- For what?

942
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,320
The devil. I wouldn't be surprised.

943
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,120
We get all sorts here.

944
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,240
- Well, wire me if there's any change.
- Yeah.

945
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,520
CREAKING

946
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,160
FOOTSTEPS

947
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,800
Everything I have to say has
already crossed your mind.

948
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,880
Then possibly my answer
has crossed yours.

949
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,240
Like a bullet.

950
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,080
It's a dangerous habit,

951
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:24,520
to finger loaded firearms in the
pocket of one's dressing gown.

952
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,960
Or are you just pleased to see me?

953
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,600
NECK CREAKS

954
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,880
You'll forgive me for
taking precautions.

955
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,240
I'd be offended if you didn't.

956
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,520
Obviously, I've
returned the courtesy.

957
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,520
BARREL CLICKS

958
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,240
I like your rooms. They smell so...

959
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,040
..manly.

960
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,840
I'm sure you acquainted
yourself with them before now.

961
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,800
Well, you are always away,
on your little adventures for The Strand.

962
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,600
Tell me, does the
illustrator travel with you?

963
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,520
Do you have to pose...
during your deductions?

964
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,920
I'm aware of all six occasions
you have visited these apartments

965
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,720
- during my absence.
- I know you are.

966
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,640
By the way, you have a
surprisingly comfortable bed.

967
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,560
Did you know that dust is
largely composed of human skin?

968
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,320
Yes.

969
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,680
Doesn't taste the same, though,
you want your skin fresh.

970
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,200
- Just a little crispy.
- Won't you sit down?

971
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,480
That's all people really are,
you know,

972
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,200
dust waiting to be distributed.

973
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,920
And it gets everywhere. Ugh.

974
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,760
In every breath you take,
dancing in every sunbeam,

975
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,080
all the used-up people.

976
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,600
Fascinating, I'm sure.
Won't you sit...

977
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,640
People, people, people!
Can't keep anything shiny.

978
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,680
Do you mind if I fire this?

979
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,520
Just to clean it out.

980
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,560
Exactly, let's stop playing.

981
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,360
We don't need toys
to kill each other.

982
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,080
- Where's the intimacy in that?
- Sit down.

983
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,360
- Why? What do you want?
- You chose to come here.

984
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,560
Not true, you know that's not true.

985
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,920
What do you want, Sherlock?

986
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,360
The truth.

987
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,640
That. Truth's boring!

988
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,680
You didn't expect me to turn up at
the scene of the crime, did you?

989
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,960
Poor old Sir Eustace.
He got what was coming to him.

990
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,520
But you couldn't have killed him.

991
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,080
Oh, so what? Does it matter?
Stop it. Stop this.

992
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,800
You don't care about Sir Eustace,
or the Bride, or any of it.

993
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,400
There's only one thing in this whole
business that you find interesting.

994
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,880
RATTLING

995
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,640
The Bride put a gun in her mouth
and shot the back of her head off

996
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,960
and then she came back.

997
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,760
Impossible. But she did it.

998
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,480
And you need to know how.

999
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,680
How?

1000
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,240
Don't you?

1001
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,480
It's tearing your world apart,
not knowing.

1002
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:19,480
You're trying to stop me...
To distract me, derail me.

1003
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,880
Because doesn't this
remind you of another case?

1004
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,200
Hasn't this all happened before?

1005
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,680
There's nothing new under the sun.
What was it?

1006
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,440
What was it?
What was that case? Huh?

1007
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,920
Do you remember?

1008
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,040
For the sake of Mrs Hudson's wallpaper,
I must remind you

1009
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,760
that one false move with your
finger and you will be dead.

1010
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,280
HE MUMBLES

1011
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,760
I'm sorry?

1012
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,280
Dead...

1013
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,480
RUMBLING

1014
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,440
GUNSHOT

1015
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,920
Well, I'll tell you what, that
rather blows the cobwebs away.

1016
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,400
How do I look?

1017
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,960
Huh?

1018
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,400
You can be honest,
is it noticeable?

1019
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,640
You blew your own brains out,
how could you survive?

1020
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,040
Or maybe I could backcomb.

1021
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,320
I saw you die.

1022
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,600
Why aren't you dead?

1023
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,440
Because it's not the fall
that kills you, Sherlock.

1024
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,720
Of all people, you should know that,
it's not the fall,

1025
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,880
it's never the fall.

1026
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,400
It's the landing!

1027
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,360
RATTLING

1028
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,680
TYRES SCREECH

1029
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,800
We've landed, sir.

1030
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,360
We've landed.

1031
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,280
No, no, not now, not now!

1032
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,440
Not now, not now.

1033
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,200
I trust you had a
pleasant flight, sir?

1034
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,960
- -
- Well, a somewhat shorter exile

1035
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,480
than we'd imagined, brother mine,

1036
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,600
but probably adequate,
given your levels of OCD.

1037
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,800
- I have to go back!
- What?

1038
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,680
I was...I was nearly there,
I nearly had it!

1039
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,280
What on earth are
you talking about?

1040
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,000
Go back where?
You didn't get very far.

1041
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,760
Ricoletti and his abominable wife!
Don't you understand?!

1042
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,400
No, of course we don't, you're
not making any sense, Sherlock.

1043
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,680
It was a case, a famous
one from 100 years ago.

1044
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,920
Lodged in my hard drive, she seemed
to be dead, but then she came back.

1045
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,080
- What, like Moriarty?
- Shot herself in the head, exactly like Moriarty.

1046
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,520
But you've only just been told.

1047
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,520
We've only just found out,
he's on every TV screen in the country.

1048
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,880
Yes? So? It's been five
minutes since Mycroft called.

1049
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,240
What progress have you made?
What have you been doing?

1050
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,080
More to the point,
what have YOU been doing?

1051
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,200
- I've been in my Mind Palace, of course.
- Of course.

1052
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,840
Running an experiment.
How would I have solved the crime,

1053
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,960
- if I'd been there in 1895?
- Oh, Sherlock.

1054
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,160
I had all the details perfect.

1055
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,360
I was there, all of it, everything.
I was immersed.

1056
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,560
Of course you were.

1057
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,880
You've been reading John's blog.
The story of how you met.

1058
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,400
It helps me if I see myself
through his eyes sometimes.

1059
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,720
I'm so much cleverer.

1060
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,680
Do you really think
anyone is believing you?

1061
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,040
No, he can do this, I've seen it.

1062
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,240
The Mind Palace, it's like
a whole world in his head.

1063
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,200
Yes, and I need to get back there.

1064
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,920
The Mind Palace is a memory technique,
I know what it can do

1065
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,680
and I know what it
most certainly cannot.

1066
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,200
Maybe there are one or two things
that I know that you don't.

1067
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,240
Oh, there are.

1068
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,440
Did you make a list?

1069
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,120
You've put on weight. That waistcoat
is clearly newer than the jacket.

1070
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,360
- Stop this! Just stop it! Did you make a list?!
- Of what?

1071
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,520
Everything, Sherlock.
Everything you've taken.

1072
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,320
No, it's not that, he goes into a
sort of trance. I've seen him do it.

1073
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,160
PAPER FLUTTERS

1074
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:10,880
We have an agreement, my brother and I,
ever since that day.

1075
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,600
GASPING

1076
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,760
Wherever I find him,

1077
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,240
whatever back alley
or doss-house...

1078
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,040
..there will always be a list.

1079
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,280
He couldn't have taken all
that in the last five minutes.

1080
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,000
He was high before
he got on the plane.

1081
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,720
He didn't seem high.

1082
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,120
Nobody deceives like an addict.

1083
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,440
I'm not an addict, I'm a user.

1084
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,200
I alleviate boredom and occasionally
heighten my thought processes.

1085
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,800
For God's sake!
This could kill you!

1086
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,680
- You could die!
- Controlled usage is not usually fatal

1087
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,040
and abstinence is not immortality.

1088
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,120
What are you doing?

1089
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,800
Emelia Ricoletti,
I'm looking her up.

1090
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,200
Oh, I suppose we should.

1091
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,000
I have access to the top
level of the MI5 archive.

1092
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,800
Yep, that's where I'm looking.

1093
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,040
What do you think of MI5 security?

1094
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,480
I think it would be a good idea.

1095
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,600
Emelia Ricoletti,
"unsolved", like he says.

1096
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,640
Could you all just shut
up for five minutes!

1097
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,840
I have to go back.

1098
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,840
I was nearly there before you
stepped on and started yapping away!

1099
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,160
"Yapping?" Sorry,
did we interrupt your session?

1100
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,400
Sherlock, listen to me.

1101
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,800
No, it only encourages you.

1102
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,760
- I'm not angry with you.
- Oh, that's a relief

1103
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,880
I was really worried... No,
hold on,

1104
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,160
I really wasn't.

1105
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,800
I was there for you before.

1106
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,400
I'll be there for you again.

1107
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,120
I'll always be there for you.

1108
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,400
This was my fault.

1109
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,000
It was nothing to do with you.

1110
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
- A week in a prison cell, I should have realised.
- Realised what?

1111
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,080
That, in your case,

1112
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,680
solitary confinement is locking
you up with your worst enemy.

1113
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,840
Oh, for God's sake!

1114
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,080
Morphine or cocaine?

1115
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,280
What did you say?

1116
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,800
I didn't say anything.

1117
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,640
No, you did, you said...

1118
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,280
IN WATSON'S VOICE: 'Which is it today?
Morphine or cocaine.'

1119
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,200
'Holmes?'

1120
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,640
Morphine or cocaine
which is it today?

1121
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,360
- DOOR SLAMS
- Answer me, damn it!

1122
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,840
Moriarty was here.

1123
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,000
Moriarty's dead.

1124
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,560
I was on a jet.

1125
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,880
A what?

1126
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,480
You were there, and Mycroft.

1127
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,600
You haven't left
these rooms, Holmes.

1128
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,640
You...haven't...moved.

1129
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,720
Now, tell me, morphine or cocaine?

1130
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,400
Cocaine. A 7% solution.

1131
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,440
- Would you care to try it?
- No.

1132
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,800
But I would quite like to
find every ounce of the stuff

1133
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,080
in your possession and
pour it out of the window.

1134
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,680
I should be inclined to stop you.

1135
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,400
Then you would be reminded,
quite forcibly,

1136
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,800
which of us is a soldier and
which of us a drug addict.

1137
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,760
You're not a soldier,
you are a doctor.

1138
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,960
I'm an army doctor,

1139
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,880
which means I could break every
bone in your body while naming them.

1140
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,880
My dear Watson, you are allowing
emotion to cloud your judgment.

1141
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,800
Never on a case.

1142
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,480
You promised me, never on a case.

1143
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,920
- No, I just said that in one of your stories.
- Listen,

1144
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,720
I'm happy to play the fool for you.

1145
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,440
I will run along behind
you like some halfwit,

1146
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,600
making you look clever,
if that's what you need.

1147
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:16,320
But dear God above, you will hold
yourself to a higher standard!

1148
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,320
- Why?
- Because people need you to.

1149
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,520
What people, why?
Because of your idiot stories?

1150
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,720
Yes, because of my "idiot stories".

1151
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,520
- FOOTSTEPS APPROACH
- Mr Holmes!

1152
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,400
Mr Holmes, telegram, Mr Holmes.

1153
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,240
What is it? What's wrong?

1154
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,480
- It's Mary.
- Mary? What about her?

1155
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,880
- It's entirely possible she's in danger.
- Danger?

1156
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,720
There's not a moment to lose.

1157
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,880
Is this the cocaine talking?

1158
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,240
What danger could Mary be in?

1159
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,200
- I'm sure she's just visiting with friends.
- Come on!

1160
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,400
What is happening?

1161
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,600
Are you even in a fit state?

1162
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,840
For Mary, of course.
Never doubt that, Watson.

1163
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,640
Never that.

1164
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,280
- HOLMES GROANS
- Holmes?

1165
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,560
I'm fine. I'm fine!

1166
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,680
Not that one!

1167
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,680
This one.

1168
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,280
- Why?
- You're Sherlock Holmes. Wear the damn hat.

1169
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,120
Cab! Cab!

1170
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,800
So tell me, where is she?

1171
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,760
You must tell me, what's going on?!

1172
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,040
Oh, good old Watson

1173
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,520
How would we fill the time
if you didn't ask questions?!

1174
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,040
Sherlock, tell me where my bloody
wife is, you pompous prick,

1175
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,760
or I'll punch your lights out!

1176
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,600
Holmes, where is she?

1177
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,560
A de-sanctified church.

1178
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,720
She thinks she's found the solution and,
for no better reason than that,

1179
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:54,440
she's put herself in the
path of considerable danger.

1180
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,360
What an excellent choice of wife.

1181
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,920
What the devil?!

1182
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,240
I've found them.

1183
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,200
CHANTING

1184
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,600
- What is all this, Mary?
- This is the heart of it all, John.

1185
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,440
The heart of the conspiracy.

1186
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,880
CHANTING CONTINUES

1187
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,880
FIGURES CHANT IN LATIN

1188
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,760
Great God, what is this place?

1189
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,840
And what the devil
are you doing here?!

1190
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,160
I've been making enquiries.

1191
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,840
Mr Holmes asked me.

1192
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,120
Holmes, how could you?

1193
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,720
No, not him, the clever one.

1194
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,320
It seemed obvious to me that this
business could not be managed alone.

1195
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,920
My theory is that Mrs
Ricoletti had help.

1196
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,440
Help from her friends.

1197
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,520
- Bravo, Mary. "The clever one?"
- I...

1198
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,120
I thought I was losing you.

1199
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,560
I thought perhaps we were...

1200
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,080
- neglecting each other.
- Well, you're the one who moved out.

1201
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,480
I was talking to Mary.

1202
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,560
You're working for Mycroft?

1203
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,680
He likes to keep an eye
on his mad sibling.

1204
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,040
And he had a spy to hand.
Has it never occurred to you

1205
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,320
- your wife is excessively skilled for a nurse?
- Of course it hasn't,

1206
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,640
because he knows what
a nurse is capable of.

1207
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,920
- When did it occur to you?
- Only now, I'm afraid.

1208
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,840
Must be difficult,

1209
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,440
being the slow little brother.

1210
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,000
Time I sped up. Enough chatter,
let's concentrate.

1211
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,200
Yes, all right.
What's all this about?

1212
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,880
- What do they want to accomplish?
- Why don't we go and find out.

1213
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,440
CHANTING CONTINUES

1214
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,600
GONG CRASHES

1215
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,560
Sorry! I can never resist a gong.

1216
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,440
- Or a touch of the dramatic.
- Never have guessed

1217
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,600
Though it seems you share my
enthusiasm in that regard.

1218
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,840
Excellent.

1219
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,200
Superlative theatre.

1220
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,240
I applaud the spectacle.

1221
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,000
Emelia Ricoletti shot herself,

1222
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,400
then apparently returned from the
grave and killed her husband.

1223
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,520
So...

1224
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,800
how was it done?

1225
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,680
Let's take the events in order.

1226
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,480
Mrs Ricoletti gets everyone's
attention in very efficient fashion.

1227
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,080
You!

1228
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,120
GUNFIRE CONTINUES

1229
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,920
You?!

1230
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,680
Or me?

1231
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,680
She places one of the
revolvers in her mouth,

1232
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,920
while actually firing the
other into the ground.

1233
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,920
An accomplice sprays
the curtains with blood

1234
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,320
and thus her apparent suicide

1235
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,880
is witnessed by the
frightened crowd below.

1236
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,240
A substitute corpse, bearing a
strong resemblance to Mrs Ricoletti

1237
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,920
takes her place and is later
transported to the morgue,

1238
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:06,160
a grubby little suicide of
little interest to Scotland Yard.

1239
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,920
Meanwhile, the real Mrs
Ricoletti slips away.

1240
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,320
Now comes the really clever part.

1241
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,160
Mrs Ricoletti persuaded a cab driver,
someone who knew her,

1242
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,680
to intercept her husband outside
his favourite opium den.

1243
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,080
The perfect stage
for a perfect drama.

1244
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,760
Who are you? What do you want?

1245
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,360
Emelia?

1246
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,600
- -
- Help!

1247
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,800
A perfect positive identification.

1248
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,040
The late Mrs Ricoletti has
returned from the grave

1249
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,960
and a little skilled make-up

1250
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,640
and you have nothing less than
the wrath of a vengeful ghost.

1251
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,200
There was only one
thing left to do.

1252
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,960
Swiftly now. No tears.

1253
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,640
GUNSHOT

1254
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:06,480
All that remained was to
substitute the real Mrs Ricoletti

1255
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,080
for the corpse in the morgue.

1256
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,920
This time, should anyone
attempt to identify her,

1257
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,360
it would be positively,
absolutely her.

1258
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,320
- -
- But why would she do that?

1259
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,960
Die to prove a point?

1260
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,280
Every great cause has martyrs.

1261
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,760
Every war has suicide missions
and make no mistake, this is war.

1262
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,440
One half of the human race
at war with the other.

1263
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:31,320
The invisible army
hovering at our elbow,

1264
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,360
tending to our homes,

1265
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,680
raising our children.

1266
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,440
Ignored, patronised,

1267
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,040
disregarded.

1268
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,680
Not allowed so much as a vote.

1269
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,440
But an army nonetheless,

1270
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,440
ready to rise up in
the best of causes.

1271
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,480
To put right an injustice
as old as humanity itself.

1272
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,680
So you see, Watson,
Mycroft was right.

1273
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,480
This is a war we must lose.

1274
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,840
She was dying.

1275
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,280
- Who was?
- Emelia Ricoletti.

1276
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,080
There were clear signs
of consumption -

1277
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,800
I doubt she was
long for this world.

1278
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,000
So she decided to
make her death count.

1279
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:25,200
She was already familiar with
the secret societies of America.

1280
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,040
And was able to draw on
their methods of fear

1281
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,400
and intimidation to publicly,
very publicly,

1282
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,720
confront Sir Eustace Carmichael
with the sins of his past.

1283
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,360
He knew her out in the States.

1284
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,480
Promised her everything.

1285
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,680
Marriage, position.

1286
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,080
And then he had his way with her...

1287
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,000
..and threw her over.

1288
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,880
Left her abandoned and penniless.

1289
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,120
Hooper!

1290
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,640
Holmes.

1291
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:03,120
For the record, Holmes,
she didn't have me fooled.

1292
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,280
Why do you never mention me, sir?

1293
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,880
Emelia thought that she'd found
happiness with Ricoletti,

1294
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,080
but he was a brute too.

1295
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,720
RAPID SPEECH

1296
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,880
Emelia Ricoletti was our friend.

1297
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,480
You have no idea how
that bastard treated her.

1298
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:35,760
But the Bride, Holmes, we saw her.

1299
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:36,920
Yes, Watson, we did.

1300
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,840
The sound of breaking glass?

1301
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,720
Not a window,

1302
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,920
just an old theatrical trick.

1303
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,160
- It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot!
- No, it can't.

1304
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,720
'It's called Pepper's Ghost.

1305
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,920
'A simple reflection in glass
of a living, breathing person.

1306
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:59,880
'Their only mistake was breaking
the glass when they removed it.'

1307
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,440
Look around you.

1308
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,560
This room is full of brides.

1309
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,480
Once she had risen,

1310
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,920
anyone could be her.

1311
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,120
The avenging ghost.

1312
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,880
A legend to strike terror
into the heart of any man

1313
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,800
with malicious intent.

1314
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,440
A spectre to stalk
those unpunished brutes

1315
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,480
whose reckoning is long overdue.

1316
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,560
A league of furies awakened.

1317
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,240
The women I...

1318
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,880
WE have lied to, betrayed.

1319
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,680
The women we have
ignored and disparaged.

1320
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,800
Once the idea exists,

1321
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,040
it cannot be killed.

1322
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,400
This is the work of a
single-minded person.

1323
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,840
Someone who knew first-hand about
Sir Eustace's mental cruelty.

1324
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,120
The dark secret,

1325
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,280
kept from all but
her closest friends,

1326
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,000
including Emelia Ricoletti...

1327
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:13,440
..the woman her husband wronged
all those years before.

1328
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:17,560
If one disregards the ghost,

1329
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,120
there is only one suspect.

1330
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,760
Isn't that right, Lady Carmichael?

1331
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,640
One small detail doesn't quite
make sense to me, however.

1332
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:35,960
Why engage me to prevent a
murder you intended to commit?

1333
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,120
Hmm?

1334
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:41,120
- -
- "Doesn't quite make sense, doesn't quite make sense."

1335
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,560
Of course it doesn't make sense,
it's not real.

1336
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,720
HE SCOFFS

1337
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,080
Oh, Sherlock.

1338
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,800
- SHERLOCK EXHALES SHARPLY
- Peek-a-boo.

1339
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,120
No.

1340
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,840
No, not you.

1341
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,280
It can't be you.

1342
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,800
I mean, come on, be serious.

1343
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,320
The costumes, the gong?

1344
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,200
Speaking as a criminal mastermind,

1345
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,280
we don't really have
gongs or special outfits.

1346
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,360
What the hell is going on?

1347
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:13,760
Is this silly enough for you yet?

1348
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:18,360
Gothic enough? Mad enough,
even for you?

1349
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,760
It doesn't make sense, Sherlock,

1350
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,840
because it's not real.

1351
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:25,760
- None of it.
- What's he talking about?

1352
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,320
This is all in your mind.

1353
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,880
Sherlock?

1354
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,680
Holmes!

1355
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,280
You're dreaming.

1356
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,880
- -
- Is he dreaming?

1357
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,800
- -
- And there he is.

1358
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,440
Thought we'd lost you for a moment.

1359
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,520
May I just check, is this what
you mean by "controlled usage"?

1360
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,560
Mrs Emelia Ricoletti, I need
to know where she was buried.

1361
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:51,080
- What, 120 years ago?
- Yes.

1362
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:54,040
That would take weeks to find,
if those records even exists.

1363
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,160
- Even with my resources.
- Got it.

1364
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,480
I don't get it,
how is this relevant?

1365
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,320
I need to know I was right,
then I'll be sure.

1366
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,760
- You mean how Moriarty did it?
- Yes.

1367
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,080
But none of that really happened,
it was in your head.

1368
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,600
My investigation was the fantasy,

1369
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,440
the crime happened
exactly as I explained.

1370
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,480
The stone was erected by
a group of her friends.

1371
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:14,160
- I don't know what you think you'll find here.
- I need to try!

1372
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,000
Mrs Ricoletti was buried here,
but what happened to the other one?

1373
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,040
The corpse they substituted for
her after the so-called suicide?

1374
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,320
- They'd move it, of course they would.
- But where?

1375
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,920
Well, not here.

1376
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,240
But that... That's exactly
what they must have done.

1377
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,160
The conspirators had
someone on the inside.

1378
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,120
They found a body, just like Molly
Hooper found a body for me, when...

1379
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,520
Yeah, well, we don't need to
go into all that again, do we?

1380
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,200
You're not seriously
going to do this?

1381
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,440
It's why we came here.
I need to know.

1382
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,880
Spoken like an addict.

1383
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,320
This is important to me!

1384
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,720
No, this is you needing a fix.

1385
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,120
- John...
- Moriarty's back.

1386
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,440
We have a case, we have a
real-life problem right now.

1387
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,920
Getting to that, it's next on the list.
Just let me do this.

1388
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,160
No, everyone always lets
you do whatever you want.

1389
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,400
- That's how you got in this state!
- John, please...

1390
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,240
I'm not playing this time,
Sherlock. Not any more!

1391
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,240
When you're ready to go to work,
give me a call.

1392
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:07,040
- I'm taking Mary home.
- You're what?

1393
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,840
- Mary's taking me home.
- Better.

1394
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,040
- He's right, you know.
- So what if he's right?!

1395
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,480
He's always right, it's boring!

1396
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,680
Will you help me?

1397
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,080
Cherchez la femme.

1398
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,640
THEY GRUNT AND STRAIN

1399
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,240
LOUD BUMP

1400
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,680
LESTRADE GRUNTS

1401
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,840
Eurgh!

1402
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,120
Oh, dear.

1403
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,360
The cupboard is bare.

1404
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,600
They must have
buried it underneath.

1405
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,360
They must have buried it
underneath the coffin.

1406
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,640
Bad luck, Sherlock.

1407
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:38,000
Maybe they got rid of
the body in another way.

1408
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,400
- No...
- More than likely.

1409
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,320
At any rate, it was a
very long time ago.

1410
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,680
We do have slightly more pressing
matters to hand, little brother.

1411
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:47,000
Moriarty? Back from the dead?

1412
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,080
- -
- 'Do not forget me.

1413
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:55,680
'Do not forget me!'

1414
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,560
CREAKING

1415
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,880
SCREECHING

1416
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,240
SHERLOCK GASPS

1417
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,880
CRASHING WATER This?

1418
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,120
Oh, I see.

1419
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,520
Still not awake, am I?

1420
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,800
Too deep, Sherlock, way too deep.

1421
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,080
Congratulations, you will
be the first man in history

1422
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,080
to be buried in his
own Mind Palace.

1423
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,920
The setting is a shade melodramatic,
don't you think?

1424
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,240
For you and me?

1425
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,840
Not at all.

1426
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,560
What are you?

1427
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,560
You know what I am.

1428
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,400
I'm Moriarty.

1429
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,120
The Napoleon of Crime.

1430
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,560
- Moriarty's dead!
- Not in your mind.

1431
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,800
I'll never be dead there.

1432
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,680
You once called your
brain a hard drive.

1433
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,320
Well, say hello to the virus.

1434
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,160
This is how we end, you and I.

1435
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,360
Always here,

1436
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,680
always together.

1437
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,360
You have a magnificent brain,
Moriarty.

1438
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,240
I admire it.

1439
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:36,880
I concede it may even
be the equal of my own.

1440
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,240
I'm touched.

1441
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,920
I'm honoured.

1442
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,520
But when it comes to the
matter of unarmed combat

1443
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,000
on the edge of a precipice...

1444
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:50,280
..you're going in the water,

1445
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,560
short-arse.

1446
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,600
MORIARTY HISSES, SHERLOCK CHOKES

1447
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,720
THEY GRUNT

1448
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:06,920
Oh, you think you're so
big and strong, Sherlock!

1449
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,160
Not with me.

1450
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,960
SHERLOCK GRUNTS

1451
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,280
THEY GRUNT AND GASP

1452
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,440
I am your weakness!

1453
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:27,040
I keep you down!

1454
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:32,040
Every time you stumble,
every time you fail,

1455
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,560
when you're weak,

1456
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,720
I...am...

1457
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,200
there!

1458
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,080
No,

1459
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,800
don't try to fight it.

1460
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,360
Lie back and lose!

1461
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,640
Shall we go over together?

1462
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,400
It has to be together, doesn't it?

1463
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,680
At the end it's always just you

1464
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,600
and me!

1465
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,040
WATSON CLEARS HIS THROAT

1466
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,960
PISTOL COCKS

1467
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,720
Professor, if you wouldn't mind
stepping away from my friend,

1468
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:11,000
I do believe he finds your
attention a shade annoying.

1469
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,440
That's not fair,
there's two of you!

1470
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,720
There's always two of us.
Don't you read The Strand?

1471
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,280
On your knees, Professor.

1472
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,080
Hands behind your head.

1473
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,600
Thank you, John.

1474
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,120
Since when do you call me John?

1475
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,800
You'd be surprised.

1476
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,080
No, I wouldn't.

1477
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,080
Time you woke up, Sherlock.

1478
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,640
I'm a story-teller,
I know when I'm in one.

1479
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,480
Of course.

1480
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,800
Of course you do, John.

1481
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,280
So what's he like?

1482
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,640
The other me in the other place?

1483
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,920
Smarter than he looks.

1484
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,360
Pretty damn smart, then.

1485
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,080
Pretty damn smart.

1486
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:06,840
Ugh, why don't you two just elope,
for God's sake?!

1487
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,600
Impertinent.

1488
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,320
Offensive.

1489
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,960
Actually, would you mind?

1490
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,120
Not at all.

1491
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,320
MORIARTY SCREAMS

1492
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,280
- It was my turn.
- Quite so.

1493
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,880
So how do you plan to wake up?

1494
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,600
Oh...

1495
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,040
I should think like this.

1496
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,600
Are you sure?

1497
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,800
Between you and me, John,
I always survive a fall.

1498
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,040
But how?

1499
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,160
Elementary, my dear Watson.

1500
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,560
HE GASPS

1501
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,080
- Miss me?
- Sherlock, are you all right?

1502
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,760
Yes. Of course I am,
why wouldn't I be?

1503
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,400
Because you probably just OD'd.
You should be in hospital.

1504
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,120
Hm, no time.

1505
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:27,440
I have to go to Baker Street now,
Moriarty's back.

1506
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,800
I almost hope he is,

1507
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,400
if it'll save you from this.

1508
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,200
No need for that now,

1509
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,680
I've got the real thing.

1510
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,400
- I have work to do.
- Sherlock...

1511
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,320
..promise me.

1512
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,440
What are you still doing here?

1513
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,840
Shouldn't you be off getting
me a pardon or something,

1514
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,080
like a proper big brother?

1515
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:54,560
Dr Watson...

1516
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:00,000
Look after him.

1517
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,120
Please.

1518
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,560
Sherlock, hang on, explain.
Moriarty's alive, then?

1519
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,680
I never said he was alive,
I said he was back.

1520
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,080
So he's dead?

1521
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:33,480
Of course he's dead, he blew his own
brains out, no-one survives that.

1522
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:37,000
I just went to the trouble
of an overdose to prove it.

1523
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,400
Moriarty is dead, no question.

1524
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,440
But more importantly, I know
exactly what he's going to do next.

1525
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,680
THEME TUNE BEGINS

1526
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,160
THEME TUNE JUDDERS TO HALT

1527
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:56,240
Flying machines,

1528
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,560
these, er, telephone contraptions?

1529
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,200
What sort of lunatic
fantasy is that?

1530
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:03,160
It was simply my conjecture of
what a future world might look like

1531
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,640
and how you and I
might fit inside it.

1532
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,920
From a drop of water a logician
should be able to infer

1533
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,480
the possibility of an
Atlantic or a Niagara.

1534
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,000
Or a Reichenbach?

1535
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,360
- Have you written up your account of the case?
- Yes.

1536
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,960
Hmm.

1537
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:20,000
- Modified to put it down as one of my rare failures, of course?
- Of course.

1538
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,760
The Adventure Of...

1539
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,080
The Invisible Army.

1540
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,240
The League Of Furies?

1541
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,280
The Monstrous Regiment?

1542
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:35,200
I rather thought The
Abominable Bride.

1543
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:39,400
- A trifle lurid.
- It'll sell. It's got proper murders in it too.

1544
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,640
You're the expert.

1545
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:43,720
As for your own tale,

1546
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:47,440
are you sure it's still just
a 7% solution that you take?

1547
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,560
I think you may have
increased the dosage.

1548
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,760
Perhaps I was being
a little fanciful.

1549
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,320
But perhaps such things
could come to pass.

1550
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:59,320
In any case, I know I would be
very much at home in such a world.

1551
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,960
- Huh, I don't think I would be.
- I beg to differ.

1552
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:06,680
But then I've always known I
was a man out of his time.
