00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,765
She ain't have the money
for it, and so, hey,

468
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,816
she tell me the church
took up a collection,

469
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,769
but they still
were short, so I...

470
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,229
Two dollars short?

471
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,697
Yeah.

472
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,321
Yeah, so I gave it to her. You
know, when the spirit moves me...

473
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,370
I guess we both got fucked. While
you was upstairs doing God's work,

474
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,536
I was over there
getting jack-legged

475
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,659
by one of these
fucking farmers

476
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,206
and one of these
goddamn waitresses.

477
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,658
I know the bitch is
in here somewhere.

478
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,459
They beat me down
to my goddamn socks.

479
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,962
You lost all our money
in a card game, Ray?

480
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,964
Fuck the money. It's not
even about the money.

481
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,837
Fuck the money.
I lost my daddy's watch.

482
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,089
Man, fuck that
cheap-ass watch, man.

483
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,718
Oh, I apologize.
It gotta stop some...

484
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,094
You right.
One more again,

485
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,301
one more again, see that I take
all your fronts out, I swear.

486
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,931
See how you go
back to New York.

487
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,813
[WHISTLES] That's how you gonna be back
in the car, all the way back there.

488
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:15,855
I'm sorry.
Fuck that.

489
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,808
Say something about the watch, Claude.
Bring up the watch.

490
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,685
In fact, just bring up watch.
Ray...

491
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,191
Look like you was fixing to make
your mouth up to say "watch."

492
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,944
<i>If I see you... I'm gonna whup your ass.
Ray, Ray...</i>

493
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,400
In fact, don't even
say "watch" no more.

494
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,699
You can't say
"watch" around me.

495
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,992
Say "little clock"
or some shit.

496
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,945
You say watch,
I'm gonna just dive on you.

497
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,747
How are we supposed to get
home without any money?

498
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,700
We got 36 cases of booze.
That's better than money.

499
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,332
Oh, okay. So we gonna
drive home drunk.

500
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,251
Is that it? Come on! Let me
pay and get out of here.

501
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,172
Hey, where's that girl
that was working over here?

502
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,340
What girl?
"What girl?"

503
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,884
Next time I come
back in here,

504
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,586
whichever bitch I start
choking, that's what girl.

505
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,670
Come on, man.

506
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,425
Big-time hustler, came and got
girked by a couple of farmers.

507
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,009
I'm gonna tell you something, Claude.
Can that twitter.

508
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,719
I'm all shot, and I just
wanna get back to New York.

509
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,894
What makes you think...

510
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,471
Ray, Ray.

511
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,937
Oh, shit.

512
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,900
I think he's hurt
pretty bad, man.

513
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,033
Hey, man, this guy's dead.

514
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,829
I ain't never seen no
dead body before, Ray.

515
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,163
What are you doing?

516
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,507
The man's been dead two seconds,
and you're in his pocket?

517
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,172
Don't you have any respect?

518
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,377
It ain't here.

519
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,380
What ain't there?
My daddy's watch.

520
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,806
This is the guy that
took my watch from me.

521
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,258
You motherfucker,
you fucked around with

522
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,809
the wrong person, didn't you?
Didn't you?

523
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,678
Now look at your ass out here bleeding.
BILLY: Hey!

524
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,140
What you boys
doing out here?

525
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,567
Hey, how y'all doing?

526
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,520
Hi.

527
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,947
We're just taking care
of our friend here.

528
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,524
What's wrong
with this one?

529
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,068
Drink...

530
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,118
Yeah, he's just
a little drunk.

531
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,446
Nothing at all.
He's just a little drunk.

532
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,826
Nobody drink
like old...

533
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:55,952
Winston.

534
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,203
Winston, Winston, yeah.
Winston.

535
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,661
Yeah, he's always drinking. Old
drunk-ass Winston always drinking.

536
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,917
This fella look
like he's dead.

537
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:07,001
Oh, no. No, no, not...
He's not dead. He's drunk.

538
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,173
He is too drunk.

539
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,344
CLAUDE: He likes to drink
until he pass out.

540
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,591
You know what'd
serve him right?

541
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,264
Just let him lay here
and sleep the shit off.

542
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,886
We gonna go. I'm gonna tell
his wife that we left him.

543
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,593
Let's go back to the car.
We gonna go...

544
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,390
I think you boys
better come with us.

545
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,891
MAN: That's right.

546
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,391
I think that... We're gonna
go to your car then.

547
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,817
Yeah, let's go.
Excuse me, Winston.

548
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,144
We're gonna go with
this gentleman here.

549
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,316
You know what, Ray?

550
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,192
You're responsible for this
whole situation. Yeah, yeah.

551
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:34,370
I blame you for everything, Ray.
Okay?

552
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,323
If it wasn't for you, man, I'd be home
right now about to have a hot meal.

553
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,953
If it wasn't for me,
your black ass would be

554
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,500
floating up on
a beach at Coney Island,

555
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,828
right now.
You forgot all that shit?

556
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,459
"I need all my finger and thumbs for
adding and..." You remember that shit?

557
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,582
I saved your life, nigger. They
think we killed somebody, Ray.

558
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,837
This is blood, okay?

559
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,133
Just shut up.
Listen.

560
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,382
<i>Just sit your ass down. Let me
work some shit out with this...</i>

561
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,678
I got a job
that starts Monday.

562
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,971
You're gonna
be late Monday,

563
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,051
'cause I got to work this
out, this whole thing.

564
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,516
Evening, boys.

565
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,939
Evening there, Sheriff.

566
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,732
Well, well, now.
What do we have here?

567
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:11,490
Billy Bob and the boys found them down
under the hill with Winston Hancock.

568
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,532
That's right.

569
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,860
He was dead.

570
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,786
Looks like murder.
Yeah.

571
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,326
Yep, it does.
Is that right?

572
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:22,289
Looks like they was running hooch.
Got 36 cases of evidence.

573
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,915
How about a little reward,
Billy Bob?

574
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,291
Well, thank you, sir.

575
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:33,004
Why bother with bootlegging when we
got us a clear-cut case of murder?

576
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:36,219
Hey, Sheriff Pike, like I told
your associate over there,

577
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,345
we didn't kill nobody.

578
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,892
The man was like
that when we found him.

579
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,477
He was out there dead.
He was already dead.

580
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,520
Now as far as
bootlegging goes,

581
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:47,147
well, I happen to work for a
very important man back east.

582
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:51,815
Yeah, yeah, does the name Spanky
Johnson mean anything to you?

583
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,115
Spanky Johnson?

584
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,985
No, I'm afraid not.

585
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,200
Hey, hey, Sheriff Pike.
Sheriff Pike, listen.

586
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,990
Listen.

587
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,494
This guy, Spanky Johnson,
is very well-connected.

588
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,577
Ooh!

589
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,756
Very well-connected. And if
you were to give us a break,

590
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:13,427
I can guarantee you, he would do
something to show his appreciation.

591
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,719
Now I'm sure.

592
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,968
[CHUCKLES] Mr. Pike.

593
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,682
I don't doubt that
you can buy your way

594
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,259
out of trouble
up in New York City,

595
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,846
but down here, we take
murder very seriously.

596
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,101
We didn't kill nobody.

597
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,727
I keep telling you, the man
was dead when we found him.

598
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:27,899
He was already dead.

599
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,022
CLAUDE: He's telling
the honest truth.

600
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,478
Now the liquor was ours.
That's our liquor.

601
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,937
There was no breath in him.
We're being truthful.

602
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,146
But that man's
being honest.

603
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,823
That was our liquor.
But the man was dead.

604
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,320
If that's the truth,
you boys don't have

605
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,777
anything to worry
about then, do you?

606
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,867
I guarantee it. I'll see
y'all in the morning.

607
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,200
You believe us, right? What time
you gonna be here in the morning?

608
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,956
Boys, don't drink all that
stuff tonight, you hear?

609
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,036
All right, Sheriff.

610
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,497
PIKE: See you in the morning.
Wait a minute.

611
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,173
He sounded like he
believed us, right, man?

612
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:56,129
The man's got a point.
We didn't kill nobody, Ray.

613
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,464
Hey, Claude, what about the
truckload of booze, man?

614
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,845
Man, that's Spanky's booze!
You know what?

615
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,176
Tomorrow,
I'm gonna tell that judge,

616
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,933
"Judge, we didn't
murder nobody.

617
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,639
"That was Spanky's booze."

618
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,896
What's the worst that can

00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,720
Did you go see
my cousin Melvin

926
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,555
like I asked you
to in my letter?

927
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,437
Of course I did. He said he'd
file an appeal right away.

928
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,029
Listen, Claude,
Melvin wanted to know

929
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,152
if he should file an appeal
on behalf of your friend, too.

930
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,364
Ray Gibson? No.

931
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:05,081
No. No. No.
No, Daisy.

932
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,409
He's the reason
I'm in here.

933
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,710
For all I know, he's got
a record a mile long.

934
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,255
I got a better shot of getting
out of here on my own.

935
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,299
You tell Melvin to think
about me, all right?

936
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,718
Just concentrate on me.
Claude.

937
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,179
Cookie made me
a map to Greenville.

938
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,476
So?

939
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,974
So, nigger,
you know what I'm saying.

940
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,431
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

941
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,727
And guess what
I'm saying.

942
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,228
If you made it that far,
they'd be checking

943
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,060
every train that
pulls out of that station.

944
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,020
We ain't taking the train.
There's a farm on the map.

945
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,776
Cookie told me
there's a boat on the farm.

946
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,450
What do you know about boats? You
probably don't even know how to swim.

947
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,368
I know a boat can help
sail our ass away from here.

948
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,321
Come on, nigger, we can do this shit.
Stop bullshitting.

949
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:47,198
Why are you always talking about "we"?
Say what?

950
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,751
There's no "we," Ray, okay?
There's a me, there's a you.

951
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,123
Why are you
talking so loud?

952
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,046
There ain't no "we"
between us.

953
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:09,888
Hey, Ray! Ray!

954
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,222
Yeah?

955
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,562
What's the name of that there
nightclub of yours again?

956
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,064
You talking about
the Boom-Boom Room?

957
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,770
Yeah, the Boom-Boom Room.

958
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,527
That's it. Boy, I'd sure
like to see that place

959
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,483
when you get it all up and
running and pretty-looking.

960
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,110
Yeah, me, too, Ray.

961
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,446
Me, too. I'd like to
see that room, too.

962
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:28,156
Yeah, I'll tell you what,
though, Radio.

963
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,741
You should've been
by there last night.

964
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,292
You'd have had
yourself some big fun.

965
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,085
What you talking about,
"There last night"?

966
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,583
Just like I said,
last night.

967
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,007
Satchmo was up in there and nearly
blew the roof off the place.

968
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,462
Ray, who that?

969
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,634
Satchmo.

970
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,336
You mean Louis...
Louis Armstrong?

971
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,263
Yeah, Satchmo, that's what I call him.
I know him personally.

972
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,340
Whenever he come by my spot,
I call him Satchmo,

973
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:47,801
and he come by
whenever he in town.

974
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:52,013
Hey, ain't nobody trying
to hear that bullshit, man.

975
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:53,435
Shut the fuck up, man!

You always trying to say
something at the wrong time.

00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:57,776
Let him finish, and do
whatever you got to do.

979
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:00,321
Go to sleep.
Let us have our fun.

980
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,364
Go ahead there, Ray. Finish
telling us about that Satchmo.

981
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,737
Go on. Tell me some more.
Go ahead, Ray.

982

Continue, Ray.
Damn!

983
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:09,618
As I was saying, last night
y'all should've come by, man.

984
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:12,075
Big fun. But y'all will never
guess who gonna be there tonight.

985
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,701
Who gonna be there, Ray?
Who that there?

986
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,206

Who that, Ray?

I thought I'd mention it.
