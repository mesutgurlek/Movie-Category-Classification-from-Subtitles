00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:02,094
A rich, successful businessman.
My father would have disowned him.

165
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,931
Why are you at Columbia
for your doctorate?

166
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:10,602
It's not just the way things worked out.
Your father got his at Columbia.

167
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:14,273
You can't fill his footsteps,
I'm sorry to say.

168
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:17,276
You might end up leaving
larger tracks than that,

169
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,362
but they'll be your tracks,
they won't be his.

170
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,533
Why didn't you answer
that Tennyson question?

171
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,077
It was obvious you knew.

172

I don't know.

if you continue to hide it from me?

our history that destroyed your father.

an objective doctoral thesis.

181
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:07,075
It mustn't become a hysterical crusade.
That's not the way to clear him.

182
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,666
All right, you may go.

183
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,514
I don't have to worry about clearing him,
because he was innocent.

(GUN FIRES)

185

Don't you think he was innocent, sir?

186
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,776
No, I think he was guilty.

187
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:46,198
He was guilty of being arrogant
and brilliant and of being naÔve.

188
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,953
Of not being able to cope with
the humiliation of being dismissed.

189
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:55,082
But of the charges,
I know he was innocent.

190
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,920
And if it matters, Levy,
I wept the day he died.

191
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,800
It was a bad day for all of us, sir.

but call as soon as you...

- No, make it the Palais-Royal.

- DOC: Goodbye.

199
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:00,355
There's something going on here
that we don't know about.

200
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,608
- Can't you be more specific?
- Yes.

201
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:05,360
I almost got my ass blown off
at the flea market.

202
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,530
I'd like to find out by whom and why.

00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,283
Also, LeClerc was not expecting me.

You sure you're not
overusing your limited imagination?

The bomb was not imaginary.

- Of course.

- Have you skied with him?
- Yeah!

00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,120
Where is it?

479
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,205
- Verbier.
- Verbier.

480
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:55,750
I've made all this up.

481
00:54:56,210 --> 00:55:00,130
There's no Mount Rosa in Verbier
or Claude LeSeur.

00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,257
You're not Swiss. What are you?

What are you?

00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:08,555

- Sure. German.

- ELSA: Anything else?
- How long are your papers good for?

486
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:16,354
Wait. If this is a joke, it's not funny.

487
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:19,274
I don't need work papers.
I'm a student here.

00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,820
Many foreigners marry Americans
to make things legal.

489
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:26,907
- Then the marriages don't work out.
- Is that what you think of me?

490
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:28,158
Stop it.

491
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:31,536
- Ask me if I care for him.
- Why? You haven't told the truth so far.

492
00:55:31,621 --> 00:55:35,165
Why don't you ask me if I love him?
Why don't you...

BABE: Wait a minute. Elsa! Wait!

494
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:41,630
Let her go. She's a phoney.
She's after something. Can't you see it?

00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,632
Stay out of it!

- Ja.

about my behaviour.

Not after what you've been pulling.

502
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:09,259
- I've done nothing.
- So Chen acted on his own?

503
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:14,806
I don't mind you hiring him,
but getting my brother involved?

504
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,975
- It was nothing.
- It was a violation.

505

It will not happen.

511

I'm much too old
and far too smart for that.

512
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:42,250
But we must talk. Truthfully.

513
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:46,671
- Are you to be trusted?
- No.

514
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:53,428
Is that the truth,
or are you trying again to upset me?

515
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:56,931
- You'll go to the bank sooner or later.
- Perhaps I've already been.

516
00:57:57,016 --> 00:57:59,476
If so, you wouldn't be here with me.

517
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,395
- What else do you know?
- I know you're panicking.

518
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:06,232
- You think you'll get robbed.
- Who would do that?

519
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:08,568
- Obviously, you think I would.
- Well?

520
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:12,989
- Can I trust you?
- You never could. You only had to.

521
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:15,408
We're talking of my safety.

522
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,745
- May I be candid?
- Yes.

523

I've been trying you for two hours.
Finally, I just went running.

I'm sorry about your brother.

- It doesn't matter.
- It does!

I don't care. Forget it. It didn't happen.

I wanted to explain.
I lied about the Swiss, because...

I can't hear.

You look at me
like I'm doing something wrong,

DETECTIVE 1: You're a student.

Tell them. Put the papers down!

DETECTIVE 1: Take it easy.
What's in the papers?

550
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:27,350
It's a paper I'm writing.

551

DETECTIVE 2: Would you
tell me who this is?

552
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:30,353
It's my father.

553
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:31,938
DETECTIVE 1:
Where can we contact him?

554
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:35,650
He's not alive any more.

555
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:40,196
- DETECTIVE 2: Is this yours?
- Yes. The license is in the drawer.

I don't know anything.

Why ask about this?
It has nothing to do with it.

but it's gotta be done,
you can understand that, right?

I was a friend of your brother's.

- I'm anxious as you to find who did this.
- I'm a little more anxious.

571
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:12,664
- I think it may have been political.
- Political? Why?

572
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:16,209
Considering what your brother did.
And your father, of course.

573
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:20,296
- What about my father?
- He was H.V. Levy, for Christ sakes.

574
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:23,174
He's been dead for 20 years,
and he was innocent.

Perhaps you could
give me some of the details.

- Where did your brother live?
- In Washington.

- What did he do?
- Oil business.

591

Wrong.

I know exactly how Doc made his living.

593
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:08,988
The closest he got to the oil business
was when he filled up with gas.

- Tell me what you're talking about.
- All right. Follow me.

Doc lived in Washington,
which is the centre of...

Why did he lie to me?

He was afraid you'd be
disappointed in him, I expect.

639
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,559
Is it safe?

640
01:13:18,228 --> 01:13:19,645
Are you talking to me?

641
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,398
- Is it safe?
- Is what safe?

642
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:27,069
- Is it safe?
- I don't know what you mean.

643
01:13:27,946 --> 01:13:31,323
I can't tell you
if something is safe or not

644
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:35,160
unless I know specifically
what you're talking about.

645
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:42,209
Is it safe?

646
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,213
Tell me what the "it" refers to.

647
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,384
Is it safe?

648
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:54,847
Yes, it's safe. It's very safe.
So safe you wouldn't believe it.

649
01:13:57,392 --> 01:13:59,101
Is it safe?

650
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:06,775
No, it's not safe.
It's very dangerous. Be careful.

651
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,555
Relax, relax.

652
01:14:36,723 --> 01:14:40,517
Come on. Open. Open. It's okay.

653
01:14:53,365 --> 01:14:57,076
- That hurt? I should think it would.
- Uh-huh.

654
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:59,161
You should take better care
of your teeth.

655
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:02,081
You have quite a cavity here.

656
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:06,418
- Is it safe?
- I told you I can't tell you... (SCREAMS)

657
01:15:12,592 --> 01:15:16,303
- Think he knows?
- Of course. He's being very stubborn.

658
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,725
No, please. Please don't. No.

659
01:15:23,478 --> 01:15:25,396
SZELL: It's okay.

660
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:32,569
Is it not remarkable?

661
01:15:32,654 --> 01:15:37,116
Simple oil of cloves
and how amazing the results.

662
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:42,204
Life can be that simple.
Relief, discomfort.

663
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:47,376
Now, which of these I next apply,
that decision is in your hands,

664
01:15:49,129 --> 01:15:53,132
so take your time and tell me.

Please stop.

- MAN 1: Take him.
- MAN 2: I got him.

Thank you. Thank you.

674
01:17:58,925 --> 01:18:02,845
Things are coming together.
Down, or your head gets blown off.

675
01:18:03,054 --> 01:18:06,014
Those two guys I wasted
work for Christian Szell.

676
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:07,724
- Know that name?
- No.

677
01:18:07,809 --> 01:18:10,018
He did experiments at Auschwitz.

678
01:18:10,103 --> 01:18:15,107
He was called The White Angel,
Der Weiﬂe Engel, due to his white hair.

679
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:17,693
The wealthiest and most wanted Nazi
left alive.

680
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:19,903
He's hiding out in Uruguay.

681
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:27,369
In '45, Szell told Jews in Auschwitz
he'd help them escape for a price.

682
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:30,956
He started out with gold, naturally,
but went on to diamonds.

683
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,791
Heard this?

684
01:18:32,876 --> 01:18:34,251
Szell saw the end early.

685
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:36,461
His brother took
the diamonds to America

686
01:18:36,546 --> 01:18:38,881
to a safe deposit box in New York.

687
01:18:38,965 --> 01:18:40,132
Szell's brother had the key.

688
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,801
The only other key
Szell kept in Uruguay.

689
01:18:42,886 --> 01:18:46,847
If he comes out to use it,
he'll expose himself to great risk.

690
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:50,851
Everything went fine till his brother
got killed by an oil truck.

691
01:18:51,144 --> 01:18:53,854
Why was it natural to start with gold?

692
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:56,732
He took it from the Jews' teeth
before he burned them.

693
01:18:56,816 --> 01:18:58,317
Szell was a dentist.

694
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:06,033
He's not coming to America,
Mr Janeway. He's here.

695
01:19:06,117 --> 01:19:07,993
No. We'd have known it.

696
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:11,246
The dentist almost killed me.
He kept saying, "Is it safe?"

697
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:14,625
White hair? Keep your head down!
Did he have white hair?

698
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:16,293
He was bald.

699
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:20,005
He's shaved his head!
He's here, and he's panicked.

700
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:24,092
- Why is he after me?
- Your brother was a diamond courier.

701
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:27,387
Szell thinks Doc said something to you
before he died.

702
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:30,891
- Did he?
- You say my brother worked for Szell?

703
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:34,561
No! He worked for us.
Everything we do cuts both ways.

704
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:38,899
Szell ratted on all his buddies.
He kept track on all the Nazis.

705
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:41,485
When we wanted to bring one in,
we went to Szell.

706
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:44,446
Babe, you gotta do one thing for me,
just one thing.

707
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:47,074
- Quit protecting Doc!
- I'm not.

708
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:50,702
- He kept alive to say something.
- He didn't.

709
01:19:50,787 --> 01:19:53,288
- He must have. Tell me!
- Nothing!

710
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:54,957
Shit!

711
01:20:03,091 --> 01:20:06,426
I thought you killed them.
You killed them!

712
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,470
You killed them!

713
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:11,682
You killed them!

714
01:20:12,058 --> 01:20:14,017
You fucking killed them!

715
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:16,436
You killed my brother!

716
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:26,738
I don't think he knows anything.
I think he knows too much.

717
01:20:26,823 --> 01:20:29,783
You can afford to think what you wish.
I can't.

718
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:45,424
The gun had blanks,
the knife a retractable blade.

719
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:49,720
Hardly original, but effective enough.
I think you'll agree.

722
01:20:55,685 --> 01:20:57,269
Brilliant, yeah?

723
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:02,733
You're an historian,
and I am part of history.

724
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:06,695
I should have thought
you would have found me interesting.

725
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:10,490
Frankly, I am disappointed
in your silence.

726
01:21:10,575 --> 01:21:13,035
Why do you have so little accent?

727
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:17,122
I had alexia as a child.
Alexia is a disease...

728
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,916
I know, it's where
you can't understand written speech.

Highest marks.

730
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:27,132
At any event, my writing is childish still,
but I'm a fanatic about spoken language.

731
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:31,553
I envy you your school days. Enjoy them.

732
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:35,432
It's the last time in your life
no one expects anything of you.

733
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:41,313
I know I behaved terribly,
but I had to be sure what you knew.

734
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,564
You see...

735
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:46,068
I'm positive
your brother meant to rob me

736
01:21:46,152 --> 01:21:49,821
when I left the bank with my diamonds.

737
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:51,907
I don't know anything.

738
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:56,161
- Did Scylla plan the robbery alone?
- Robbery?

739
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:03,126
- You know the value of diamonds?
- No, I don't.

740
01:22:03,211 --> 01:22:05,796
Neither do I. Not in today's market.

741
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:10,842
Tomorrow, I must go and find out
before I go to the bank.

742
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:14,346
You see...

743
01:22:17,517 --> 01:22:20,393
Your brother was incredibly strong.

744
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:24,022
Strength is often inherited.

745
01:22:24,357 --> 01:22:25,816
He died in your arms.

746
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:29,027
He travelled far
and in great pain to do that.
