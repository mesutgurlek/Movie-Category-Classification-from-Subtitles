1
00:00:35,407 --> 00:00:40,640
# I know I am, I'm sure I am
I'm West Ham till I die #

2
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,799
[shouting]

3
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:48,240
Go on, bruv. Go on, bruv.

4
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:59,436
Fuck me. If I knew we was going to a bar
mitzvah, I'd have brought me fucking skullcap.

5
00:00:59,607 --> 00:01:04,556
Mate, Tottenham's due north.
Are you lost or just fucking stupid?

6
00:01:04,727 --> 00:01:08,436
Still a stand-up comedian, eh, Dunham?
All right, mate.

7
00:01:08,607 --> 00:01:11,917
When the Major was doing your job,
he wasn't nearly so chatty.

8
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:15,045
Probably 'cause
he wasn't quite so nervous either.

9
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:18,438
The Major always preferred a scrap
to your yammer.

10
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:20,916
- What's all that? What is that?
- Yammer?

11
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:26,445
You reckon? Mate, I think you should get
on the next train and fuck off out of here.

12
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:29,724
- Before something bad happens.
- [Jeering]

13
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:32,401
We'd be interested to see exactly what that is.

14
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:35,604
You're not exactly top-flight mob
these days, are you?

15
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:38,201
- More like a two-bob mob.
- [Laughter]

16
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,961
See, now, that's just plain rude.

17
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:44,483
But if you fancy it, who are we to let you down?

18
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:49,641
- Come on, then!
- Come on, then, you fucking poncey cunt!

19
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:53,277
- You fucking cunt! You!
- [Chanting]

20
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:10,279
Fucking have it! Come on.

21
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:07,638
Let's go.

22
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:11,082
I'm telling you, you don't need Lewis.

23
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:18,005
I will trade you Keeshon and Maddux for Lewis.
And I'm gonna be losing out on this deal.

24
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:22,797
Because Keeshon, he's back
with the old coach. He's back with Parcells.

25
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:25,686
And they are gonna be an unstoppable team.

26
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:28,236
You know that. I know that.

27
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:34,196
Look, man, he was
comeback player of the year, you know.

28
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:39,077
Not many guys have thrown
over 6,000 yards. Come on.

29
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:45,684
Let me call you back.
I gotta deal with something.

30
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:53,720
Buckner. That $10,000.
I think it's a pretty good deal.

31
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:56,606
We never had a deal, Jeremy.

32
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:02,520
Look, I know you got screwed here.

33
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:06,316
But I have my family's reputation to protect.

34
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:10,924
A Van Holden getting expelled from Harvard.
No way.

35
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:13,476
I've got a little more at stake here, Matt.

36
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:16,836
Buckner.

37
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,077
Come on, man.

38
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:25,004
My dad is definitely gonna get re-elected.
When I graduate, I'll totally hook you up.

39
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:30,198
Thanks, bro.

40
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:39,996
You're really saving my ass.

41
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:16,283
You've reached Carl Buckner. I'm currently
on assignment in Kabul and I'm unreachable.

42
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:18,597
Leave a message
at the foreign correspondents desk

43
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:23,557
at the Washington bureau of the Times
and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

44
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:25,718
Thanks so much.

45
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:08,163
This is a security announcement
at Heathrow airport.

46
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:12,525
Please keep your belongings with you
at all times.

47
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:14,678
[Matt] My name is Matt Buckner.

48
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:18,681
Last spring, I got kicked out of Harvard
two months shy of my diploma,

49
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:23,318
but what I was about to learn, no lvy League
school in the world could teach me.

50
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:49,562
Mind the gap.
Please stand clear of the closing doors.

51
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:52,685
Mind the gap. Please stand clear.

52
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:12,157
[Woman] Matt!

53
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:17,003
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey.

54
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,556
- Oh, my God.
- It's so good to see you.

55
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:22,924
You, too. Was that a terrorist attack?
What happened here?

56
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:26,397
Welcome to match-day madness.
Tottenham was in town last night.

57
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:30,037
- Are you a soccer fan now?
- Don't let them hear you say soccer.

58
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,641
- Who's "them"?
- The British Empire.

59
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:36,326
Uncle Matt, meet Ben.

60
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:39,047
- Can you believe that?
- Hey there, little guy.

61
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,516
- He's adorable.
- Yeah.

62
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:46,726
It is so good to see you.
But what are you doing here?

63
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:57,357
It doesn't make sense. Why would you have
been expelled if you didn't do anything wrong?

64
00:08:57,527 --> 00:09:00,280
It was my roommate. He's a total cokehead.

65
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:04,599
Somebody tipped off campus security
and we got our room searched.

66
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,758
They found his stash in my stuff.

67
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:10,840
I guess he'd been hiding his shit
in my closet the entire time.

68
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:13,475
Really?

69
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:17,606
- Yeah, really.
- You could tell me if you were taking...

70
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:22,158
- It's not like that.
- So you fought it and they didn't believe you?

71
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:25,876
Matt. You fought it, right?

72
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:29,487
Look, you don't know who this guy is.

73
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,683
He's a Van Holden.

74
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,839
I wouldn't have even had a chance.

75
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:38,801
So what did Dad say?

76
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:40,446
"You've reached Carl Buckner."

77
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,519
"I'll be in the lvory Coast for 57 years"?

78
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:46,326
- Kabul this time.
- Whatever.

79
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:50,241
Seriously, though, when you spoke to him,
what did he say?

80
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:53,285
- I didn't tell him.
- He doesn't know?

81
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:59,683
- I probably would have done the same thing.
- Yeah?

82
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:03,078
Once he finds out his golden boy
got kicked out of Harvard,

83
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:05,636
he'll dive headfirst
into an empty swimming pool.

84
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:08,037
- Gee, thanks.
- [Car door closes]

85
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,836
Oh, Steve's home.

86
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,998
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

87
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:21,005
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Oh, honey, we have a guest.

88
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:24,125
This is my kid brother, Matt.

89
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:26,721
Matt. All right, mate? How are you doing?

90
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:31,005
- It's good to finally meet you.
- And you. Finally made it across the pond?

91
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,158
- Yeah.
- [Baby gurgles]

92
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:35,795
Who's this? Who's this?

93
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:38,356
Come here. Oh, I missed you. Come here.

94
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:40,438
Oh!

95
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:44,316
- I missed you, little Lord Ben.
- Honey, you want some tea?

96
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:46,523
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Tea, huh?

97
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,202
- Get over it.
- He's a good-looking little geezer, in't he?

98
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:52,403
- Sure is.
- Listen, Matt.

99
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:56,037
I'm really pleased you're here,
but I made some plans for tonight.

100
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:58,323
I've got this whole romantic evening set up.

101
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:01,763
I've got the babysitter booked,
and we've got tickets to see Chicago.

102
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,918
- You wouldn't mind if we go?
- [Knocking]

103
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:06,601
Oh, excuse me.

104
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:11,682
Shall we go and see who's banging
the door down? What a surprise.

105
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:15,157
- What are you doing?
- Aye aye! All right, bruv.

106
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:21,956
- Jesus, Shannon, you look rough.
- You're a funny guy, Pete.

107
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:25,403
- [Pete laughs]
- Matt, this is Pete, Steve's brother.

108
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,161
- Pete, this is my brother, Matt.
- Hi.

109
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:31,444
- All right, son?
- Good to meet you.

110
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,835
Hello, Ben.

111
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:36,795
# I'm West Ham till I die
I'm West Ham till I die

112
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:39,845
- # I know I am, I'm sure I am... #
- All right.

113
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:43,841
- I'm taking him to bed.
- All right, babe.

114
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:47,357
- See you later, Ben.
- Well done.

115
00:11:47,527 --> 00:11:50,997
- I thought you were going to the match.
- Well, technically, yes.

116
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,762
But we got into a bit of a drinking session
last night.

117
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:58,078
- One thing led to another...
- You've lost your wallet.

118
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:00,044
- And me keys.
- [Horn beeps]

119
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:03,483
There's a taxi outside.

120
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:07,919
Top bloke, my brother.

121
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:09,406
So...

122
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:14,967
How are we, my colonial cousin?

123
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:18,918
- Fine, thanks.
- [American accent] Fine, thanks.

124
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:23,919
- You couldn't make it a hundred?
- How does piss off sound?

125
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:25,884
Fuck off, come on.

126
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:29,164
# Get some drinks in
Get some drinks in

127
00:12:29,327 --> 00:12:33,002
- # Get... #
- Shut up. Just shut up.

128
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:37,124
I'll tell you what I'll do, all right?

129
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:40,563
I'll give you a hundred...

130
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:44,916
...if you take Matt here to the match.

131
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:48,124
Fuck off, you're having a bubble.

132
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:51,882
- I can't take a Yank to football.
- Yeah, you can.

133
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:55,642
And you're gonna be on your best behaviour,
do you understand?

134
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:02,564
- Go on.
- Well, come on, then.

135
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:06,322
Cheers, Matt.
We don't get much time on our own.

136
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:10,878
Right, listen to me.
You don't give him the money, OK?

137
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:13,322
No way. That's beer for the boys.

138
00:13:13,487 --> 00:13:16,240
- All right.
- All right?

139
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:18,841
Matt? Where are you going?

140
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,805
I'm going to the soccer game with Pete.

141
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,880
- But you just got here.
- I know, but I'll catch up with you later.

142
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:29,357
- Have a good time. See you.
- [Pete] Hurry up.

143
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:32,599
I don't want him hanging out
with Pete and those thugs.

144
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:35,964
It's all right. He's a big boy.
He can look after himself.

145
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,766
Pick a hand. Come on.

146
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:44,799
The right hand?
You've just won the star prize.

147
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:53,400
Yeah? How much do you love me?

148
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,478
- A lot.
- That's not enough.

149
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:07,599
I'm not being funny, but the last thing
I want to do is to take you to the match.

150
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:12,318
So here's how it works.
Give me half the money. I'll go to football.

151
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:17,845
You can see where Churchill took a tom,
or whatever you Yanks do in Jolly Old.

152
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:22,319
- Tom?
- Tom. A tomtit, shit.

153
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:26,082
It's rhyming slang.
Like bees and honey for money.

154
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:29,683
Like I could say to you,
give me the fucking bees.

155
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:35,319
- I made a promise to Steve.
- Well, Steve ain't here, is he, mate? I am.

156
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:38,763
You're pissing in the wind
if you think I'm taking you.

157
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:43,443
- I'm not giving you the money.
- You ain't really got a fucking choice, mate.

158
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:47,600
And you're starting to get on my tits.
Give me half the money.

159
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:51,478
Cops!

160
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:55,766
Well, how fucking stupid do you feel now?

161
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:59,158
Come on, then, dance for me, Yankee.

162
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:05,165
Serves you right
for fighting like a bleeding tart.

163
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:09,445
But try that again
and I will kick the shit out of you.

164
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:12,326
Yeah, the tom out of me. I get it.

165
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:14,478
Get up. Come on.

166
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:18,440
So, I'm guessing you're not much of a fighter.

167
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:21,121
Fighter? That's probably
the first fight I ever had.

168
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,245
You call that a fight?

169
00:15:25,887 --> 00:15:30,039
Fuck it. I will take you with me.
You might learn something.

170
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:34,962
- About soccer?
- No, mate. Not about soccer.

171
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:38,756
And for fuck's sake, stop saying soccer.

172
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:42,796
Come on, hurry up.

173
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:48,086
What are you talking about,
baseball is a girls' game?

174
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,478
The Red Sox guy pitches a ball
at 90 miles an hour.

175
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:55,481
Who cares? All that means is
he can have a wank faster than you.

176
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,842
- Come on.
- Think about it.

177
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:03,362
I just don't get it.
What is it with you Americans?

178
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:08,237
You start a fucking war, bottle it,
then we have to come save your arse again.

179
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:10,477
- Save our ass?
- Yes.

180
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:14,356
On top of that, you kill half our soldiers
in friendly fire.

181
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:18,042
- That's called an accident.
- Yeah, accident my arse.

182
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:20,402
- All right?
- All right, Dunham?

183
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:25,721
Look, we're sort of
going into my place of business, right?

184
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:29,197
Shut up and you might have
a better run of things.

185
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:33,155
Only thing regarded worse than a Yank
around here are coppers and journalists.

186
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,478
- What have you got against journalists?
- How long have you got?

187
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:41,084
They're lying fucking scum
who'll write anything just to fill papers.

188
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:44,683
Not your old man, of course.
He's the exception maybe.

189
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:49,363
These boys don't know about your old man.
If I was you, I'd keep it that way.

190
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:53,486
Another thing.
What you hear in here stays in here, all right?

191
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:57,003
No blabbing to brother Steve
about who said what.

192
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:59,965
What happens at football stays at football.
All right?

193
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:01,924
Yeah, all right.

194
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:06,126
Let's have some fun. It's football day!

195
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,718
All right, Pete.

196
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:14,479
- Aye aye!
- [Cheering]

197
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:19,323
- How's it going?
- Good, yeah, good. All right, boys?

198
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:21,682
This is Matt, Shannon's brother. Ned.

199
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:24,361
- Nice to meet you.
- Dave. Swill.

200
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,916
- Hello, mate.
- Ike.

201
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,363
- And the one with the dodgy haircut's Keith.
- Hey, Keith.

202
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:34,805
- I'll get the drinks in, then.
- Does that mean I'm getting the drinks in?

203
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:39,165
Every fucking time. Every fucking time.

204
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,160
- Where's Bovver?
- He's been in the toilet for 15 minutes.

205
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:46,002
- Dodgy Ruby or something.
- Look, he looks lost.

206
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,920
Ruby Murray means curry.
We call it cockney rhyming slang.

207
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:52,204
Slang. Yeah, like bees and honey for money.

208
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:56,599
- Struggle and grunt for cunt!
- Why'd you go there?

209
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:59,600
- Like septic tank for Yank.
- Bovver.

210
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:03,043
- Bov.
- How you doing? All right?

211
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,402
This is Matt, Shannon's brother.

212
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,398
Hey.

213
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,320
That's the proper... He don't give a fuck.

214
00:18:11,487 --> 00:18:14,559
- He don't give a fuck.
- Mate, he's practically family.

215
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,361
Ah, mate, it's fucking painful.

216
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:21,405
Bov's a miserable cunt,
but we love him dearly, don't we?

217
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,762
- Sometimes.
- Like a fucking brother.

218
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:27,442
- Grab these last two pints.
- Get some salted peanuts.

219
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,484
- Sure.
- Bov, come on.

220
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:32,400
- He's all right, man.
- What's with all the fucking babysitting?

221
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:36,845
- You know we had a meet set up for today.
- I'll stay out the way.

222
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:41,637
- It's not like we didn't have it last night.
- What? That's not the bloody point, is it?

223
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:44,879
We look like right mugs
if our fearless leader don't show

224
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:47,880
'cause he's playing
pin the tail on the fucking Yank.

225
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:50,163
He's right. He's got a point.

226
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:53,205
You let me worry about that, all right, boys?

227
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:56,757
As for the Yank, he's too modest to tell you,

228
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:02,684
but back in the States he's an internationally
ranked double black belt in karate.

229
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:05,566
- Is he fuck! Look at the size of him.
- No.

230
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,561
Bloody Karate Kid film? Based on his exploits.

231
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:11,763
- Really?
- Yeah, it's true.

232
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:15,044
- Bollocks! Bollocks!
- Come on, why not?

233
00:19:15,207 --> 00:19:19,485
You've been here fucking five minutes
and you're lying.

234
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:22,885
[# The Stone Roses: Waterfall]

He's now officially cockney, the boy.

You know that bollocks you was talking
about earlier about Karate Kid.

251
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,997
That's horse piss, right?

252
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:29,125
- Oh, no, no.
- No, mate. Shit's Gospel of Paul.

253
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:31,437
- Yeah.
- What was your coach's name?

254
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:35,321
Little Chink geezer. What was his name?

255
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:37,478
- In the first one?
- All fucking three.

256
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:41,959
Why weren't you in the fourth one?
Why'd you let the side down?

257
00:20:42,127 --> 00:20:44,766
You weren't there, mate...

260
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:55,037
What was his fucking name, your mentor?
You owe it all to him.

261
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:56,925
- I can't remember it.
- Miyagi!

262
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:59,078
- Miyagi! Fuck's sake.
- Miyagi.

263
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:04,765
Miyagi. Mr Miyagi.
He was based on a real person.

264
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:09,478
They based him on a real person.
That's out of order. Did they pay him?

265
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:13,640
- Of course he got fucking paid.
- Just imagine the situation.

266
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:17,516
No, listen, seriously. Imagine the situation.

267

- Someone uses you in a fucking film...
- It's a liberty.

Don't take the piss out of me.
This is real stuff I'm talking about.

00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:44,520
Oh, come on. You're the one
that's got to buy the bleeding thing.

449
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:51,999
[Bovver] Get your cash out.
The fat bird's about to sing.

450
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:55,117
Ah, shot.

451
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:58,199
Jesus! You two joined
at the fucking hip or what?

452
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:02,724
- Leave it out, Bov. It's getting old.
- No, I'm starting to wonder about you two.

453
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:07,324
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you was a couple of gay boys.

454
00:37:09,487 --> 00:37:14,197
Bov, we've known each other
a long time, yeah?

455
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:17,439
I trust you more than any other bloke I know.

456
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:21,805
But you're getting dangerously close
to crossing the line with me.

457
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:27,200
If you've got a problem,
then it's your fucking problem, not mine.

458
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:30,882
But if you want to discuss it further,
we can go outside.

459
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:35,962
- Beers, boys.
- Hey, Bov. It's your shot, mate.

460
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:40,484
Come on. Let's crack on with the game.

461
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:44,720
[Barman] Pete. Everything all right, mate?

462
00:37:50,487 --> 00:37:54,162
I can't believe you came all this way
and didn't even stay the night.

463
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:58,081
- I don't want to mess anything else up.
- You didn't mess anything up.

464
00:37:58,247 --> 00:38:02,240
- So you and Steve are OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

465
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:05,205
All right, well, I'll call you from Pete's.

466
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:13,163
Matt. Please don't go.

467
00:38:14,407 --> 00:38:16,682
Steve feels so horrible about what happened

468
00:38:16,847 --> 00:38:21,079
and he really wants you to stay with us,
and so do I.

469
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:25,479
- I don't want you to stay with Pete.
- Well, I wanna stay with Pete.

470
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:29,076
Pete and his thug friends aren't the answer.

471
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:33,924
What are you talking about? What answer?

472
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:40,280
I've been begging you to come and visit me
for the last three years

473
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:43,041
and you didn't even come to my wedding and...

474
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:45,721
You don't know my husband,
haven't held your nephew,

475
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:49,118
and you show up on my doorstep yesterday
and you're leaving already.

476
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:53,075
Look who's talking. You ran
to another fucking country after Mom died.

477
00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:03,684
I'm sorry.

478
00:39:08,687 --> 00:39:11,724
- You come and visit me.
- Yeah, of course.

479
00:39:19,687 --> 00:39:22,247
[Pete] Jeremy Van Holden?

480
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,876
Sounds like a cunt.

481
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:31,360
Mate, if he'd done that to me,
I'd smash seven shades of shit out of him.

482
00:39:33,527 --> 00:39:36,997
Sounds like these Harvard boys
would slit your throat in your sleep.

483
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:41,763
What was you studying,
before this geezer stitched you up?

484
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:45,886
- History.
- History? I teach history.

485
00:39:46,047 --> 00:39:50,837
- You teach?
- Yes, cheeky slag.

486
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:55,398
History and PE. What, did you think
the GSE paid a bloody wage?

487
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:58,240
I'm smart as fuck.

488
00:39:58,407 --> 00:40:01,558
Come on, it's brass monkeys out here.

489
00:40:03,887 --> 00:40:06,799
Class, today we have
an extraordinarily distinguished guest.

490
00:40:06,967 --> 00:40:13,202
Mr Buckner is an American who went to the
finest university in the United States, Harvard.

491
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:15,961
But despite his prestigious education,

492
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:22,646
Mr Buckner still thinks that baseball
is better than football.

493
00:40:22,807 --> 00:40:24,798
[Boys shout]

494
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:27,435
I know, boys. It's an utter sin.

495
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:30,485
It's our job to save this heathen
from his evil ways

496
00:40:30,647 --> 00:40:33,525
and teach him what really matters in life,
and that is?

497
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:37,157
- Football!
- Exactly. We're going to play five-a-side.

498
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:40,603
Mr Buckner will be goalie for the away colours.

499
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:44,555
Now, go easy on him, boys.
You know how these Americans bruise.

500
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,317
[Shouting]

501
00:40:50,487 --> 00:40:54,002
How do we keep this fair?
I let every other ball go through?

502
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:56,362
I wouldn't worry about that.

503
00:40:57,407 --> 00:40:59,398
All right. You ready?

504
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:11,396
[Pete] Go on, son.

505
00:41:12,207 --> 00:41:14,243
That's it! That's it!

506
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:17,160
Ah, beautiful! Beautiful!

507
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:20,238
Relax, kids.

508
00:41:22,807 --> 00:41:27,722
[Pete] Go on, Duncan. Go on, Duncan,
have it. Take it all the way.

509
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:31,722
Have it. Have a dig, mate.

510
00:41:33,047 --> 00:41:35,515
- [Cheering]
- [Pete] Oh, beautiful goal!

511
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:44,517
All right, that's it.

512
00:41:57,407 --> 00:41:59,841
What was that?

513
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:04,158
Go on, my son.

514
00:42:05,847 --> 00:42:07,883
Beautiful. Sheer beauty.

515
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:14,115
- Lovely.
- [Boys shouting]

516
00:42:14,287 --> 00:42:16,755
[Blows whistle]

517
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:21,079
All right. Home team: 10. Away team: 3.

518
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,603
Thanks to some pathetic goalkeeping
from the away keeper.

519
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:29,477
- All right, get yourselves changed, boys.
- Played.

520
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:33,526
- That's what I call a real ass-whipping.
- You set me up.

521
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:36,155
That was like
the junior Olympic football team, right?

522
00:42:36,327 --> 00:42:40,036
No, mate. Just regular English boys.
We've got history next.

523
00:42:40,207 --> 00:42:43,279
Say a few words about
the American War of Independence.

524
00:42:43,447 --> 00:42:48,646
- They'd get a kick out of a real live colonial.
- American history isn't really my specialty.

525
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:51,719
Mate, they're ten.
Teach them whatever you want.

526
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:55,323
Well, I sort of have plans
with Shannon this afternoon.

527
00:42:55,487 --> 00:42:58,559
- We'll have a beer later.
- Yeah, see you at the pub.

528
00:42:58,727 --> 00:43:02,003
All right, mate. Who are you? Who are you?

529
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:07,721
But these kids... He set me up, man. I'm
thinking this is some class of kids, little ones.

530
00:43:07,887 --> 00:43:09,878
Shut up.

531
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:15,606
- They're coming in everywhere...
- Oh, come on.

532
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:24,722
No, no. No.

533
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:26,878
[Cheering]

534
00:44:01,007 --> 00:44:03,646
- Fat cunt.
- Fucking fat bastard.

535
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,879
- Hello, mate.
- Get the fucking chips in.

536
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:11,040
Well, I'll be fucked.
If it ain't my old mate Bovver.

537
00:44:12,407 --> 00:44:14,875
How are you doing, son, all right?

538
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:20,121
I'll say one thing, you got some fucking front
showing your face over this side of the water.

539
00:44:20,287 --> 00:44:24,519
There's plenty of people round here love to kick
your fucking arse, given half the chance.

540
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:28,885
- There's four of 'em stood over there.
- Fucking right, son.

541
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:34,804
So, Bov, what's all this I'm hearing about
your firm gone all fucking international, eh?

542
00:44:37,527 --> 00:44:42,647
Don't you even fucking think
about ignoring me, you little cunt.

543
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:48,200
Now, I said what's all this bollocks I'm hearing
about you having a little Yank on the firm?

544
00:44:50,847 --> 00:44:54,078
It's only temporary.

545
00:44:54,247 --> 00:44:57,876
- Temporary, eh?
- [Chatting and laughter]

546
00:44:58,047 --> 00:45:03,599
Do you think I can get a bit of quiet here?
I'm trying to have a fucking conversation!

547
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:07,837
- [Whispers] What's his problem?
- Shh.

548
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:11,966
So, look at you, little Bovver.
All grown up now, look.

549
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:14,163
- Where's your other little girl...?
- [Man] Petey.

550
00:45:14,327 --> 00:45:17,000
Petey? She at home, is she?

551
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:22,116
Trying to get her little toes
into the Major's big fucking shoes?

552
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:26,758
I guess we was pretty small back then, son.
Back in your day.

553
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:33,718
You always did have a bit of bottle, you.

554
00:45:33,887 --> 00:45:38,881
- So tell me, Bov. You come over to Millwall.
- [Woman] Is he a bit of a bully?

555
00:45:39,047 --> 00:45:44,167
- Did you come alone?
- [Woman laughs]

556
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:47,683
What do you think?
Do you think that'd wind him up?

557
00:45:47,847 --> 00:45:51,681
- [She laughs]
- Excuse me a minute, Bov.

558
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:59,277
Hello. I'm Tommy. Tommy Hatcher.

559
00:45:59,447 --> 00:46:02,678
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh, you know?

560
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:05,964
Well, now, you see, that's bad.
That's really, really bad.

561
00:46:06,127 --> 00:46:10,166
You ain't got no fucking excuse
for not keeping that shit cunt of yours quiet.

562
00:46:10,327 --> 00:46:12,887
George, he can't talk to me like that.

563
00:46:13,047 --> 00:46:17,518
George, your bird hasn't stopped
fucking rabbiting since I've walked in here!

564
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:20,201
Now, can I recommend that you shut her up?

565
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:24,121
So I can continue my conversation
with our guest there, Bovver,

566
00:46:24,287 --> 00:46:26,278
of the once-proud GSE firm.

567
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:29,598
- You can't tell me... Oh, my God!
- See what she's doing?

568
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:33,521
Does she ever fucking, sodding, ever...?

569
00:46:33,687 --> 00:46:36,360
- That's enough!
- That's enough?

570
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,564
I'll tell you when it's enough, son, all right?

571
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:43,515
Tommy, the Paki's called the Old Bill, mate.
We best fuck off.

572
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:46,076
Tommy, we best fuck off sharpish, mate.

573
00:46:48,887 --> 00:46:52,084
I'll see you again. Soon, Bov.

574
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,996
I don't reckon I'll be back till tomorrow night.

575
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:30,843
- Be gentle with her. And remember, left side.
- Left side. Right.

576
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:39,800
- You seem nervous.
- Nervous? Fuck off.

577
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:41,958
What's on your mind, then?

578
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:46,643
Two little words keep every Hammer
in England up all night: United away.

579
00:47:46,807 --> 00:47:49,196
- Oi, oi!
- Aye aye!

580
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:54,561
- All right, mate. You all right?
- Yeah, all right, big man?

581
00:47:54,727 --> 00:47:56,718
- Hello, Matt.
- All right?

582
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:00,558
- Where's Bovver?
- Fuck knows.

583
00:48:00,727 --> 00:48:03,719
He's been a pain in the arse all week. PMS.

584
00:48:03,887 --> 00:48:07,846
Pre-Match Stress.
He's being a right cunt at the minute.

585
00:48:08,007 --> 00:48:11,397
- Come on, Pete. The train's in five minutes.
- Yeah, hang on.

586
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:17,961
His phone's off. I can't believe
he's gonna pull a runner for United away.

587
00:48:18,127 --> 00:48:22,757
They'll be gunning for you, too, after the job
you pulled on their top boy last year.

588
00:48:22,927 --> 00:48:25,441
What happened last year?

589
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:28,883
- I may have gone a bit over the top.
- Just a bit.

590
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:32,039
- Where's Dave? Have you heard from him?
- Have you?

591
00:48:32,207 --> 00:48:36,359
Oh, everything's just falling
right into place, isn't it?

592
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:39,485
- I'll go.
- No, mate.

593

something dodgy about that little cunt.

Yeah, mate, sly.

744
00:58:51,927 --> 00:58:56,318
- Tell you what. Pick me up after work.
- All right. I'll see you after work. Sweet.

745

[Carl] You know, your sister's worried sick
about you.

746
00:58:59,127 --> 00:59:01,766
She says you're running around
with some kind of gang.

747
00:59:01,927 --> 00:59:05,556
It's not a gang, Dad. They're my friends.

748
00:59:05,727 --> 00:59:10,118
- Are you at least writing about it?
- Am I writing about it? No.

749
00:59:10,287 --> 00:59:13,518
Hey, Matt, listen.
I want you to come home with me.

750
00:59:13,727 --> 00:59:15,763
- What?!
- Look.

751
00:59:15,967 --> 00:59:19,403
You may not trust me as your father,
but as a fellow journalist,

752
00:59:19,567 --> 00:59:21,239
your reputation is all you have.

753
00:59:21,447 --> 00:59:24,200
You've gotta get back to Harvard
and clear your name.

754
00:59:26,087 --> 00:59:29,397
- We can fight it together.
- Forget it, Dad.

755
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:33,523
- I'm not going home.
- Jesus...

I am keeping a journal.

It's one thing you taught me I held onto.

I knew that.

Take your time.
My cab will be here in half an hour.

766
01:00:09,887 --> 01:00:11,320
I gotta take off, Dad.

01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:16,276
Oh. OK, Matt.

768
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:19,078
Look, I know things have not been...

769
01:00:24,527 --> 01:00:27,917
Great to see you.

770
01:00:33,207 --> 01:00:35,596
- How you doing?
- Good.

771
01:00:35,767 --> 01:00:38,235
So you'll be celebrating the draw
with the lads?

772
01:00:38,407 --> 01:00:40,238
The draw. Wait, who did we get?

773
01:00:40,407 --> 01:00:43,399
- You don't know?
- No.

01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:47,116
- Oh, come on, Steve. Who?
- Millwall.

01:00:51,967 --> 01:00:53,605
Huh!

777
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:55,166
Hello.

778

Don't we want to play?

779
01:01:02,967 --> 01:01:05,037
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hey.

780
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:07,482
- You OK?
- Mm.

781
01:01:08,407 --> 01:01:11,843
Yeah, I was just watching my dad
playing with Ben.

782
01:01:12,007 --> 01:01:15,841
He's already a better grandfather
than he ever was a dad.

783
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:18,885
You know, he seems like
a decent bloke now.

784
01:01:19,047 --> 01:01:22,198
For a bloody journo.

785
01:01:25,967 --> 01:01:29,198
So he was an arsehole
when you were growing up.

786
01:01:29,367 --> 01:01:32,564
I guess that's why neither of you
joined the old man's racket.

787
01:01:32,727 --> 01:01:34,080
What do you mean?

788
01:01:34,247 --> 01:01:38,763
- You know. Followed in his footsteps.
- What are you talking about? Matt did.

789
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:40,525
What do you mean?

790
01:01:40,687 --> 01:01:46,125
Matt was always a little more fascinated
with our absentee father than I was.

Shannon, what do you mean, "Matt did"?

792
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:53,117
That's what Matt studied at Harvard.

793
01:01:53,287 --> 01:01:55,084
He was a journalism major.

794
01:01:55,247 --> 01:01:59,160
I just really hope that he gets back to it.

795

full of stories about all of us.

894
01:09:03,527 --> 01:09:06,485
- It's a fucking diary!
- Ned saw you at the Times

895
01:09:06,647 --> 01:09:08,046
with a couple of journos.

896
01:09:08,207 --> 01:09:12,439
That was my Dad.
He's the journalist, you knew that.

897
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:16,282
- His old man's a journo and you knew.
- That don't mean nothing yet.

898
01:09:16,447 --> 01:09:19,644
He studies to be a journo,
his old man is a journo.

899
01:09:19,807 --> 01:09:23,004
What's the difference?
You let one of them get in with us.

900
01:09:23,207 --> 01:09:26,916
- I wasn't trying to get anything.
- You, shut the...!

901
01:09:27,127 --> 01:09:30,915
I don't care who he is.
You don't do someone on the deck.

902
01:09:32,767 --> 01:09:36,965
What's wrong with you? He's gonna
bury us all and you're just gonna watch?

903
01:09:39,207 --> 01:09:42,643
No. Now, Steve, you're the Major.

904
01:09:42,847 --> 01:09:44,166
You started this firm.

905
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:47,598
We got the biggest ruck of our lives
coming up,

906
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:51,282
and your brother's too much
of a bottle-job to lead us.

907
01:09:52,687 --> 01:09:57,807
The GSE is Pete's firm. All right?
He calls the shots.

908
01:10:06,407 --> 01:10:09,319
Well, fuck the lot of you!

909
01:10:09,527 --> 01:10:11,358
GSE.

910
01:10:12,287 --> 01:10:14,243
Get out of the fucking way! Move!

911
01:10:16,727 --> 01:10:19,195
Get yourself cleaned up.

912
01:10:27,407 --> 01:10:29,363
Tommy.

913
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:36,639
This is it, mate. We're finally gonna get back
at those fucking Hammer cunts, eh?

914
01:10:36,847 --> 01:10:40,522
[All chanting] Millwall! Millwall! Millwall!

915
01:10:49,127 --> 01:10:50,526
The fuck's he doing here?

916
01:10:50,727 --> 01:10:53,321
Marky, sit down, son. Sweet.

917
01:10:53,887 --> 01:10:57,800
- That's it. Do as you're told, you mug.
- Fuck off.

918
01:10:57,967 --> 01:11:02,518
Bovver. You know, we're gonna have
to stop meeting like this, don't you, son?

919
01:11:02,687 --> 01:11:07,602
People are gonna start to talk. What you doing
up so late on a school night?

920
01:11:08,367 --> 01:11:13,202
Shouldn't you be at home with your pals all
shitting at the thought of us turning you over?

921
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,967
What, you had a lover's tiff?

922
01:11:18,127 --> 01:11:20,197
What do you want, Bov?

923
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:24,602
Fucking Yank's an undercover journo.

924
01:11:28,287 --> 01:11:31,882
He's at our boozer now.
Tom, you gotta give him the chop.

925
01:11:32,047 --> 01:11:34,402
He's got 'em eating
out of the palm of his hand.

926
01:11:34,567 --> 01:11:39,118
What makes you think that I'd wanna
sort that out for you, eh?

927
01:11:39,287 --> 01:11:41,517
Because the Major's there too.

928
01:11:46,047 --> 01:11:48,880
Stevie Dunham's in there?

929
01:11:57,727 --> 01:12:00,560
- Thanks, Pete.
- Shut up! History student my arse.

930
01:12:00,727 --> 01:12:04,276
- Who the fuck are you?
- Sorry I lied about being a history major,

931
01:12:04,447 --> 01:12:05,766
but I'm not a journalist.

932
01:12:05,967 --> 01:12:08,162
It don't look fucking good, does it?

933
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:12,519
- Why are you keeping a record?
- It's a journal. I've kept that my entire life.

934
01:12:12,727 --> 01:12:17,198
- Are you working for the Times?
- No. I'm telling you the truth.

935
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:19,801
You've gotta trust me, Pete.

936
01:12:29,767 --> 01:12:33,680
Mate, you've put me right fucking in it.

937
01:12:33,847 --> 01:12:38,363
If I don't convince those boys that
the head of their firm was not just taken

938
01:12:38,527 --> 01:12:42,361
by a fucking Yank journo,
the GSE is done.

939
01:12:45,647 --> 01:12:50,038
So I'm gonna go out there and I'm
gonna tell them that Bov's got it wrong.

940
01:12:50,207 --> 01:12:52,562
And that you're one of us.

941
01:12:52,727 --> 01:12:56,356
And I had better be fucking right.

942
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:16,515
So, Bovver, is there anything else
you wanna tell us?

943
01:13:16,687 --> 01:13:19,406
Tom, please.
This is how it's got to go down...

944
01:13:19,567 --> 01:13:21,797
You fucking... Go on, Marc.

945
01:13:21,967 --> 01:13:24,686
Afraid you're the only one
going down, little Bovver.

946
01:13:24,847 --> 01:13:26,724
Grass.

947
01:13:28,687 --> 01:13:30,996
Fuck!

948
01:13:31,167 --> 01:13:35,126
This shit with Bovver
could tear this firm apart.

949
01:13:35,287 --> 01:13:40,281
Mate, I need you.
Stay with us, just through Millwall.

950
01:13:42,807 --> 01:13:44,798
I'm not gonna help you.

951
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:50,485
I made a promise to my wife and kid, all right?
And I'm sticking to it.

952
01:13:50,647 --> 01:13:56,324
You know, there comes a time
when the best reputation you can have

953
01:13:56,487 --> 01:13:58,239
is the one with your family...

954
01:14:00,487 --> 01:14:04,116
- [man] Down, get the fuck down!
- Hello, boys.

955
01:14:07,047 --> 01:14:08,958
Jesus!

956
01:14:19,647 --> 01:14:21,763
[Matt] Pete! Pete, come on, man!

957
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:26,565
Terry.

958
01:14:28,127 --> 01:14:29,116
Fuck off!

959
01:14:32,887 --> 01:14:35,355
Terry!

960
01:14:37,567 --> 01:14:41,355
Look who's back in the fucking Abbey
after all these years.

961
01:14:41,527 --> 01:14:43,961
Tommy, I'm done with all this, mate.

962
01:14:44,127 --> 01:14:46,687
Retired, did you?
Got yourself a Yank wife, did you?

963
01:14:46,847 --> 01:14:50,044
Had a son of your own, did you?
I had a son once!

964
01:14:50,207 --> 01:14:52,402
Do you remember him?!
Do you fucking remember him?!

965
01:14:52,607 --> 01:14:55,201
- I'm sorry!
- It's too late!

966
01:14:56,007 --> 01:14:57,804
You fuck!

967
01:14:59,527 --> 01:15:01,404
Tommy!

968
01:15:04,207 --> 01:15:07,199
- You listen to me.
- Tommy!

969
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:12,566
You die tonight, and me and you are even.

970
01:15:23,087 --> 01:15:25,521
It's done! Let's go!

971
01:15:38,847 --> 01:15:43,159
- Pete! Over here, mate, quick.
- Jesus, fucking hanging here, like!

972
01:15:46,767 --> 01:15:50,077
- [Steve] Ah, fucking hell.
- Get him down.

973
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:53,997
[Bovver] I've messed.

974
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:57,443
Bovver, what the fuck did you do?

975
01:15:58,127 --> 01:16:01,085
Get a fucking car!

976
01:16:05,047 --> 01:16:07,720
[Car alarm wails]

977
01:16:11,487 --> 01:16:12,715
[Terry] Move!

978
01:16:12,887 --> 01:16:16,516
[Steve] Agh! Fucking hell!
[Terry] Move!

979
01:16:16,687 --> 01:16:20,043
[Pete] Get in there.
[Terry] Get him the fuck in the car!

980
01:16:23,007 --> 01:16:25,475
[Terry] Get in! Go!

981
01:16:26,007 --> 01:16:30,444
Go! Fucking go!
Get out of the way! Move, move!

982
01:16:42,647 --> 01:16:45,719
Somebody help!
Help us, he's been fucking stabbed!

983
01:16:45,887 --> 01:16:48,321
Come on, hurry!

984
01:16:49,887 --> 01:16:53,402
[Matt] Fucking hurry up!
[Man] Resus. Go, go.

985
01:17:23,287 --> 01:17:26,404
- What did he say?
- He's hanging on.

986
01:17:41,967 --> 01:17:44,686
Trusting lads.

987
01:17:44,847 --> 01:17:48,840
You always said trusting lads
was my problem, Bov.

988
01:17:49,047 --> 01:17:55,202
I trust lads too much.
Trust the Yank too much.

989
01:17:55,367 --> 01:17:58,677
This is how you prove your point?

990
01:17:58,847 --> 01:18:06,117
Backstabbing me? Teaming up
with Tommy Hatcher to kill the Major?

991
01:18:06,927 --> 01:18:09,395
Kill my fucking brother?!

992
01:18:10,287 --> 01:18:14,405
I'll kill Tommy.
Just say the word and I'll do it.

993
01:18:16,087 --> 01:18:19,477
I don't need you for that.

994
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:24,562
I don't need you for anything anymore.

995
01:18:28,407 --> 01:18:30,398
Go away.

996
01:18:31,287 --> 01:18:34,040
Please, I fucked up...

I'm so sorry.

I know.

1004
01:20:24,567 --> 01:20:27,400
The doctor said that you're gonna be OK.

1005
01:20:28,487 --> 01:20:31,524
He said it's just gonna take a little time.

1006
01:20:39,007 --> 01:20:41,726
We're leaving tomorrow.

1007
01:20:51,607 --> 01:20:54,167
It's not safe for us here now.

1008
01:21:14,567 --> 01:21:17,957
- How is he?
- He's hanging in there.

1009
01:21:18,167 --> 01:21:21,876
- So, what now?
- You let Tommy know I want a straightener.

1010
01:21:22,087 --> 01:21:24,920
- Tomorrow.
- All right.

1011
01:21:25,127 --> 01:21:28,836
We finish this once and for all.
Somewhere quiet.

1012
01:21:29,047 --> 01:21:30,605
Away from Old Bill.

1013

- Your mate still runs security at Trinity Wharf?
- Yeah.

1014
01:21:33,767 --> 01:21:36,156
- Get hold of him. Set it up.
- Sure.

1015
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:40,561
Come on.

1016

What's going on?

1018
01:21:57,927 --> 01:22:00,600
Ben and I are on the noon flight
to Boston.

1019
01:22:00,767 --> 01:22:03,406
You can't leave him.
He was trying to protect us.

1020
01:22:03,567 --> 01:22:08,721
- You can't do this to him, Shannon.
- Yes, she can. She has to.

1021
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:10,445
So should you.

1022
01:22:10,607 --> 01:22:13,485
I'm going with you to that wharf tomorrow.

They crash our pub, they put your brother
in the hospital.

1025
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:22,760
- That ain't your problem anymore.
- What are you talking about?

1026
01:22:22,927 --> 01:22:27,239
- I've got just as much at stake here as you do.
- Matt, listen to me.

1027
01:22:27,407 --> 01:22:29,637
It's time to go home.

1028
01:22:30,647 --> 01:22:35,767
- I don't know where my home is anymore.
- I think we both know where it ain't.

1029
01:22:37,607 --> 01:22:41,600
Mate, this is my fight.
It's my brother in the hospital.

1030
01:22:41,767 --> 01:22:44,565
I'll take care of Tommy.

1031
01:22:46,167 --> 01:22:48,840

Yeah.

1040

You know that back home nobody's
gonna care about your rep here.

You know that, right?

1042
01:26:27,287 --> 01:26:29,676
I'm gonna call a cab.

1043

- Where's Matt?
- Finally went home.

# Put it out, man
The cop's behind you

1197
01:41:51,807 --> 01:41:53,286
# Let me remind you, jail's an ugly place

1198
01:41:53,447 --> 01:41:56,166
# So wipe the smile off your face
So put it out, you gotta, hey

01:41:56,327 --> 01:41:59,763
# You run away, run away

1200
01:42:07,207 --> 01:42:10,517
# What say, you look right through me
You don't know where to find me

1201
01:42:10,687 --> 01:42:12,723
# Never give a fuck
Until you're in your car behind me

1202
01:42:12,887 --> 01:42:14,718
# Watching, judging
Making your pay

1203
01:42:14,887 --> 01:42:17,606
# Like every badge out there

1204
01:42:17,767 --> 01:42:19,678
# We're all victims of the system

1205
01:42:19,847 --> 01:42:22,407
# There's cops at every corner
And no way that you can miss them

01:42:22,567 --> 01:42:25,035
# How am I supposed to deal with the rage

1207
01:42:25,207 --> 01:42:29,485
# Take it out on you or on stage, yeah

1208
01:42:29,647 --> 01:42:34,084
# Buy it, buy it, can't deny it
You never know how it feels till you try it

1209
01:42:34,247 --> 01:42:36,124
# If you want the message
From the underground

# You gotta buy it
Burn it downl

1211
01:42:39,047 --> 01:42:43,677
# Want me, come and get me, pig
You want a piece of me

Why can't you let me be?

# Well, there are clean-cut sergeants
To the massive

1214
01:43:00,367 --> 01:43:02,483
# But all they ever do
Is take it up their asses

1215
01:43:02,647 --> 01:43:04,558
# And on the day that they end up in jail

1216
01:43:04,727 --> 01:43:07,446
# They turn their badge in
Their badge is their bail

1217
01:43:07,607 --> 01:43:09,677
# Now you want treats
With no clip at your hip

01:43:09,847 --> 01:43:12,361
# You gotta fight fist to fist
Ain't life a trip

1219
01:43:12,527 --> 01:43:14,518
# And all the drugs you said
Were killing my brain

1220
01:43:14,687 --> 01:43:19,078
# Look who's got his nose deep
In the cocaine
