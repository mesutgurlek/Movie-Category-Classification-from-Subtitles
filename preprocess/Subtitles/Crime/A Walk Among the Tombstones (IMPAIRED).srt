00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,740
a 25-year-old Interior Design
major at Brooklyn College

354
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,980
was found at Green-Wood Cemetery.

355
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,363
Andresen had been missing two
days when Eduardo Solomon,

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,780
florist across the street
from the cemetery,

357
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,260

as a portion of the victim's leg

in the dumpster behind his shop.

more human remains were found

scattered about the cemetery
by a groundskeeper.

Andresen's fiancé, Reuben Quintana,

364
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,644
told police that he and Leila were
supposed to meet up for lunch.

Okay. Nice meeting you, TJ.

What I'm saying is,
I don't care nothing about cows.

I just care about what
I put inside my body.

No meat, no soda, no Pringles,
none of that shit.

a little eat on myself.

it takes to be a good detective?

there the night before.

They do that, you know?

487

Throw their rubbers and their
empties into the pond.

You see the cops across the street?

489
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,660
Yeah, but I didn't make that connection

490
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,220
until Vince came running over
from the Fifth Avenue entrance.

491

Vince.

492

Yeah, he's the other groundskeeper.

493
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,300
He's the one that found
the bags over there.

494
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,460
Is Vince around?
I'd like to talk to him.

495
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,761
He quit.

496
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,010
He opened one of the bags.

to forget about her.

guy on the other side of the street.

Sure. If you have three guys.

a lot of payphones.

So you don't got no cell phone?

I don't like them.

He wasn't looking for me.

Funny. Me following you while
you following some other guy.

I was at this coffee
place on Prospect...

out of the van and grab her.

00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,280
You wouldn't really notice
them unless they spoke to you.

648
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,129
One of them had a beard, or a goatee.

649
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,009
The other one smiled a lot.
He did all the talking.

651

in a place like that.

Thought it was funny.

00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,161
Wanted to buy me drinks.

655

So we went to this bar
in the middle of the day.

656
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,860
Drank rum and Coke.

657
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,220
Talked about the different
videos we liked.

658
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,380
It was all one big laugh to them,

659
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,020
watching all the drug
addicts fuck each other.

660
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,540
They were, like,
obsessed with that whole world.

661
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,207
Dealers, addicts,
different kinds of drugs.

662
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,650
They told me they worked with the DEA.

663
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,041
They were cops?

664
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,691
They wouldn't say for sure.

665
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,525
They said what they did was secret.

666
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,802
But they had one of those
police radios, you know?

667
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,180
One of those handheld units.

668
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,780
And they had all these files on drug
dealers with DEA stamps on them.

669
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,969
Told me they worked on
special assignments.

670
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,526
You told them about Reuben.

671
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,128
I told them about Leila.

672
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,729
About how I wanted to
save her from Reuben.

673
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,767
So we came up here.
We watched them for a while.

676

678
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,980

We finally parked somewhere.

680

Said they wanted to
make their own video.

681
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,140

682

808
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,364
But she was working you?

809
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,420
Working him?

810
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,165
Fucking moron wanted to marry her.

811
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,485
That's how good she was.

812
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,569
Hello, my name's Peter.

813
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,140
I'm an alcoholic and
still a drug addict,

814
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,860
and I got one day back.

815
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,180
ALL: Hi, Peter.

816
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,620
PETER: It's good to see all
the friendly faces again.

817
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,140
Still haven't managed to
turn your back on me.

818
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,965
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

819
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,700
So I slipped, you know?

820
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,980
It happens.

821
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,220
The funny thing is I didn't
start using until I was 28.

822
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,300
Yeah?

823
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,180
Up until then,
I never even smoked a joint.

824
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,740
Even when I was overseas, you know,

825
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,460
half my unit was on
one thing or another.

826
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,820
You were in the army?

827
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,122
Yeah, I was in Germany,
then Desert Storm.

828
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,660
I come home, go back to school,

829
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,246
- and me and Kenny, we start dealing.
- (VEHICLE APPROACHING)

830
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,727
Just enough to get by.
It was more Kenny's thing.

831
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,140
He was dealing in college.

832
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,660
I do it to pay for art school.

833
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,340
Wind up getting hooked on the product.

834
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,620
Drop out.

835
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,420
Meanwhile, Kenny,
he stays in the business,

836
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,100
starts making some real money

837
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,420
while I'm eating garbage and
sleeping in abandoned buildings.

838
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,820
Till one night I nearly blew my fucking
heart out of my mouth up in Harlem.

839
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,281
What are you gonna do now?

840
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,140
I got this job as a breadmaker.

841
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,900
Figure stay busy at night,
sleep during the day.

842
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,440
Get in less trouble.

843
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,780
All right. See you around.

844
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,940
Take it easy.

845

I'd like the number for the
East Village Plumbing, please.

848
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,260
What borough?

849
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,700
I assume it's the East Village.

850
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,081
One moment.

851
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,808
- No listing in Manhattan.
- Try Brooklyn.

852
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,620
Nothing in Brooklyn either.

853
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,081
Try all the boroughs.

854
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,700
I'm sorry, we have no listing.

859
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,049
I bumped into something. You okay?

TJ: I'm fine.

- What you got there in your backpack?
- Nothing.

862
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,860
Just my notebook. Some Twizzlers.

Unless you're talking
about my pencil case.

864

No. I'm talking about the black
Beretta with the taped grip

865
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,580
you got tucked beside your water bottle.

866
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,881
Oh.

867
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,041
You mean this.

868
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,681
My new jammie.

869
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,500
It's a nice one.

870
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,260
What are you planning on doing with it?

871
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,860
I don't know, man.
Right now it's just for protection.

872
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,380
Figure, I'm gonna be a detective,
I need a piece.

873
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,380
Mmm-hmm. Where'd you get it?

874
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,842
I was just taking a nap in some alley.

875
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,620
Heard some footsteps.
I seen some dude who works

876
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,220
as a lookout for some ballers.

877
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,091
He just threw the bag
in a dumpster and split.

878
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,650
You stole someone's stash?

879
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,610
I didn't steal it. I left the
money and the rock where it was.

880
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,020
They're going to come back
for the piece, you know that.

881
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,403
Naw. They're in the wind,
Matthew. Trust me.

882

01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,528
Point it at me.
Like you're gonna shoot me.

886
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,161
Go ahead.

887
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,441
Come on.

888
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,366
That the way you hold a gun?

889
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,770
That's the way I hold it, yeah.

890
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,603
You know how to jack the clip?
Empty it? Clean it?

891
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,804
But the gun's still not empty.
You know that, right?

892
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,165
You know there's still a round
left in the chamber here?

893

Now. Put it back together.

Now cock it.

901
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,530
Now put it to your temple and
pull the fucking trigger.

902

- What?
- You heard me.

903
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,220
Shoot yourself in the head.

904
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,090
Might as well get it over with now.

905
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,660
Because you walk around with a gun,

sooner or later,
it's gonna happen anyway.

and coming back to the show.

- I can't say.
- Cut it out, Scudder.

You're not licensed so
you don't have privilege.

930
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:02,321

as much legal authority as a fucking mailman.

So the sooner you tell me what you're
doing hanging with known drug dealers,

932

the sooner you can get to an AA

they're on the DEA payroll.

Yeah. We had to.

Carrie had nothing to do with it.

About nine months ago, they go
to Bermuda for their anniversary.

But he was also out in the rain.

Either one could have
triggered the crisis.

- Crisis?
- He's a sickler.

He's got sickle cell anemia.

any time the body gets
ready to fight something,

1040
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,940
the red blood cells panic,
and they take on a sickle shape.

1041
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,980
Actually create a kind of a
traffic jam in the arteries.

The blood gets very thick.

Suddenly, you're not getting any oxygen.

Well, we're hydrating him,
giving him Demerol for the pain.

He got in here early enough,

outside and keep an eye out.

Now I post guards.

1129
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:49,565
The horse is stolen, so I lock the barn.
For what? Huh?

1130
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,700
What can they take from me now?
She's 14 years old.

1131
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,580
Fourteen.

1132
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,769
This is Anna, the nurse.

1133
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,082
They took her last night
and call us in the morning

1134
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,729
and tell us not to call the police.

1135
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,260
I remember Kenny calling the other day,
so I put two and two together.

1136
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,500
Mr. Landau, listen,
you have to know that...

1137
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,940
I'm sorry, what's your daughter's name?

1138
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:17,084
Ludmilla. But she calls herself Lucia.

1139
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,820
MATTHEW: You have to know
that the men who took Lucia

1140
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,681
have already killed at least two
women, including Kenny's wife.

1141
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,420
As things stand, they haven't
got the slightest intention

1142
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,722
of releasing your daughter alive.

1143
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,940
In fact, there's a strong possibility
that she's already dead.

1144
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,940
- No...
- The police know about these two.

1145
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,580
They know who they are,
they know what they're doing.

1146
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,211
No, no, no police.

1147
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,644
You have to help me.
Kenny said you would. I'll pay.

You gotta let me talk to her.

The important thing right
now is to keep Lucia alive.

That means these guys have to know

- They're already mad.

But you'll give them
an excuse to kill her.

1173
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,660
They don't need an excuse.

1174
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,961
They're gonna kill her anyway.

1175

What they need is a
reason to keep her alive.

Do these bastards want cocaine?

I can't guarantee the quality,
