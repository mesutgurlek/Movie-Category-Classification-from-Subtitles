10

wretched mistake?

12
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,446
I hate the expression
"I hear you."

is, "I'm ignoring you."

But, Professor Hornstein,
I hear you.

The poker site
has some of it, too.

19
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:39,298
I was hoping, perhaps, you
could get it back for me.

two things from it.

is that you are promoting

My more pressing concern,

the one expressed to me
by Mr. Arnaud's father

66

is that you are
encouraging Paul to gamble.

You told
your dad that, Paul?

It's his credit card.

69
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,893
MONROE: The point is,
Mr. Furst,

70
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,630
Mr. Arnaud did not send his
boy 3,500 miles from home

teaching assistant.

Instead, you are running
some kind of virtual casino.

75
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,347
Gambling is forbidden
on campus.

76

Bookmaking is forbidden
on campus.

change your tune,

78
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,022
you're going to be forbidden
on campus as well.

Dean, I'm not eligible

But that money
is basically gone.

my degree. And that's if I don't eat.

live by your own rules.

I'm not a bookie, okay?

My official title is
"Affiliate for Online Gaming."

96
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,881
I steer traffic to the website,
they pay me a commission.

97
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,649
Hands off.
Arm's length.

98
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,685
I get a small fee for
each player I sign up.

99
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,853
I'm not living some
elaborate lifestyle, here.

100
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,922
It's how I'm paying my way
through this university.

101
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:27,592
What we touch touches us,
too, Mr. Furst.

102
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:30,262
Dean, I'm in marketing.

103
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:32,497
As am I.

104
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,100
And what I market
is this university.

105
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:38,770
You will close up shop,
effective immediately,

106
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,607

All of it, Craigger.

113
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,320
What do you say, we shut
it down real quick?

114

(SCOFFS) It must be really nice
to have your education paid for,

but the rest of us still have
to grind for our Masters.

Is your plan just to gamble
for your tuition money?

117
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,729
Whoa, whoa, it's not like
I'm shooting craps

118
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,930
or playing blackjack
or something.

119
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,332
You're playing poker,
Richie.

120
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:43,135
I'm playing poker against fish, Craig.
It's a big difference.

121
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:47,272
And $17,000 means
zero to me right now.

122
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,741
This is my shot, okay?
And statistically, it's the right play.

123
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,443
Look, I've been
three-tabling.

124
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,078
I find a guy on the fourth,

who's acting like it's his life's
mission to give all his money away.

126
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,350
Hold up. (STAMMERING)
Why did you just raise?

127
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,519
Non-weighted game theory.

128
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:03,321
Because it'll outperform the EV of
flatting and he'll spaz in anyway.

00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,913
Oh, God, I haven't been called that
since the last time I was deposed.

306
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,514
It brings back bad memories.

307
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:24,816
It's Rebecca.

308
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,384
Rebecca,
I'm Richie Furst and...

309
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,452
You smell like
an affiliate.

310
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,687
Not anymore.

311
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,123
But you want something.

312
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,692
Okay, so there's a couple of
ways I could respond to that.

313
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,161
I could say "yes,"
and you walk away.

314
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,163
I could say "no," but then
you'd know I was lying.

315
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,466
And I walk away.

316
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,101
But you haven't
walked away yet.

317
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,203
Don't try to con me.

318
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,071
Just tell me straight up
what you want.

319
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,707
Okay.

320
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,809
I need to come to that
party tomorrow night.

321
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:55,013
There. How easy was that?

322
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,415
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

323
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,124
Hey, you!
Get down. Now.

324
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,661
RICHIE: All right, fellas.

325
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,630
GUARD: Let's go.

326
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,731
(LAUGHING)

327
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,203
Is this the guy?

328
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,506
Okay, you got in.
What do you want?

329
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,274
My name is Richie Furst.

330
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,109
I was cheated on your
site, Midnight Black,

331
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,445
and I'm guessing by the look on
your face you don't even know it.

332
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,615
If I had a dollar for every bad
gambler who lost money on my site,

333
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,050
and turned around and claimed they
got cheated, I wouldn't need a site.

334
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,219
Mr. Block, I ran a multimodal
sample distribution

335
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,388
at the Plasma Physics Lab
at Princeton.

336
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,357
These numbers
are negative-3 sigma.

337
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,926
That means they fall substantially
below the standard deviation.

338
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,700
I could have gone to the
Internet forums, chat rooms,

339
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,736
exposed the whole thing,
but I didn't.

340
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,171
I brought it to you.

341
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,240
Well, I appreciate that.

342
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,109
Thank you very much.

343
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,577
Have a good night.

344
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:40,745
Sir?

345
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,653
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

346
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,603
Hey. Come on aboard.

347
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,071
It's not gonna
make you sick, is it?

348
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,039
No, no, no.
I'm fine.

349
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,440
Good.

350
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,876
I'm a big believer
in being the person

351
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,911
who kills what
they eat, you know?

352
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,614
The Indians had
that figured out.

353
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,249
And not a whole
hell of a lot else

354
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,117
until the casino racket
in the mid '80s.

355
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,652
(CHUCKLES) Let's try this part again.
My name's Ivan.

356
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:22,887
Richie Furst.

357
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,155
It's a pleasure, Richie.

358
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,556
Welcome aboard.

359
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,992
<i>This is The House.</i>

360
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:30,528
I never in a million years thought
I'd have something like this.

361
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,964
Just got to the point where me and
my old partner, Alex Maynard,

362
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,433
looked in the ATM account and
realized we had so much money

363
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,402
that it was morally incumbent
on us to buy something.

364
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,605
So, we ordered
a set of these boats.

365
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,541
We had a good time.
A lot of fun.

366
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:46,310
(EXHALES)
Is he still involved?

367
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,580
No. Alex, um...

368
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,918
You know, this life
has a lot of temptation.

369
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,887
And it just gets
a hold of some people.

370
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:00,458
Alex died of a drug overdose a
little more than three years ago.

371
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,395
He was a good guy.
He was my...

372
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,464
He was my best friend.

373
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,066
<i>Why The House?</i>

374
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,635
Because the house
always wins.

375
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,872
Which is why we don't
have to cheat people.

376
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,775
We have the greatest
business model in the world.

377
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:21,379
50,000 players, three cents
a second, average rake.

378
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,447
That's just poker, okay?

379
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,951
The rest of the site we're doing
$1.2 to $1.9 million a day.

380
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:31,455
That translates into
$750,000 net profit per day.

381
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,025
But the math is right.
Am I missing something?

382
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:36,027
No, you didn't
miss anything.

383
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,363
We missed something.

384
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,965
We had a couple
of our programmers

385
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,700
who decided
it would be a good idea

386
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:44,602
to write a backdoor
into the code

387
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:46,537
so that they could
see player's hole cards.

388
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,539
And they cheated you.

389
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,641
And they cheated
other players.

390
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,610
And I'm really sorry
and I'm embarrassed.

391
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,045
And that has nothing
to do with what

392
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,780
this company
and what this site stand for.

393
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,782
You saw it.

394
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,684
The donkeys in Compliance
missed it.

395
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:01,185
This is why
they're on airplanes

396
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:04,088
to wherever the fuck donkeys
from Compliance come from.

397
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,589
But you came to me.

398
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,124
You didn't tell
anybody else.

399
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,793
Because you know rumors
of cheating and bullshit

400
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:10,761
can affect these sites
like fucking bedbugs

401
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,363
and you can never
get rid of it.

402
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,998
That took a lot of balls.

403
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,300
Honestly, I couldn't get
to you any other way.

404
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,903
Regardless,
I'm very grateful.

405
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:22,139
I am nothing if not world-class
at showing my gratitude

406
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:24,742
so we have checked you in
to one of our company's

407
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,944
executive luxury
penthouse suites

408
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,879
and your account
has been credited

409
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,981
with the amount of
money that you lost.

410
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,450
I don't know what to say.
Thank you.

411
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,818
Thank you. (SIGHS)

412
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,686
Just do me a favor
and don't try to win

413
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,355
your tuition
online again, okay?

414
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,089
How do you know
about that?

415
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,025
How do you think
I know?

416
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:46,530
Studying my player history,
ran it through your algorithm,

417
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,232
saw that I was playing
way above my mean.

418
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,500
No, none of that shit.

419
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:52,837
We bribed your roommate,
Craig.

420
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,340
Look, Richie, I understand
why you did what you did.

421
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:59,377
I know about what happened
with that job on Wall Street.

422
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,746
You were trying to get rich, and
you were trying to be respectable.

423
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,848
And you would have, if you
had another year and a half.

424
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,216
Those people
took your labor...

425
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,617
And my fucking money.

426
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,119
And your fucking money,
and they burned it all up.

427
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:09,520
And now you're fucked.

428
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:12,356
Because Wall Street's a different place.
The rules have changed.

429
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:15,926
The odds of getting a job at a
good hedge fund on Wall Street

430
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:18,129
are roughly the same
as hitting runner-runner flush

431
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,063
in a hand of Texas Hold 'Em.

432
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,535
You probably know what the odds
of hitting a runner-runner flush

433
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,303
in Texas Hold 'Em are,
don't you?

434
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,139
Roughly four percent.

435
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:29,840
Roughly four percent.

436
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,077
Well, listen,

437
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,612
I put a little something extra
in here for your troubles.

438
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,781
That will get you
through your Masters.

439
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:40,050
I think that ends
our business here.

440
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:42,787
Unless, of course, you
feel like sticking around

441
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:45,756
and taking a shot
at a real business.

442
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:49,059
Guaranteed seven figures
in the first 18 months.

443
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:51,095
Guaranteed eight figures
in the first three years.

444
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:55,199
I have met very few
people in my career

445
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:58,035
who I think can be really,
really exceptional at this.

446
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,738
And you are one
of those people.

447
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,741
The most important rule in the world
is that nobody gives you shit.

448
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:06,444
You want to do something in this
fucking life, you go out and build it.

449
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,313
What do you say?

450
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:12,116
Is it Newark, or you stick
around here with me?

451
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,318
(CHUCKLES)

452
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,654
What do you think?

453
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,556
I think any question
that starts with

454
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,324
"Either are you back
to Jersey or 'X'",

455
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,492
the correct answer is "X".

456
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:22,793
(BOTH LAUGHING)

457

<i>RICHIE: I was in.

up the affiliate business.</i>

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,333
<i>A few little things
and we're pagando blackjack.</i>

775
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,402
What few little things?

776
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:33,837
He wants an extra
three points rake-back

777
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,505
and to stay at
cost per acquisition.

778
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:36,740
I know it's not
the original deal,

779
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:38,308
but, uh, we still
make a huge profit.

780
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,943
No. Fuck him.

781
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:41,711
If we give him that, every piker
who thinks he's an affiliate

782
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,847
is gonna want
the same thing. No.

783
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:46,049
Then I don't think
we get him.

784
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,151
Well, then I guess that's it,
you don't want the bonus.

785
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:49,419
You know what I mean?
Pack your shit.

786
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:50,887
No, no, no.
Ivan, wait.

787
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,555
I've got this.

788
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,224
Tell me how much room
I have to negotiate.

789
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:56,226
You have no room
to negotiate.

790
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:57,694
You already
tried negotiating.

791
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,362
Now, you try leverage.

792
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,698
Everybody has something they
care about more than money.

793
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,100
Find out what that is.

794
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,668
Then you gotta do
the hard thing.

795
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,641
That little voice in the
back of your head right now?

796
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,009
It's not your conscience.

797
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,145
It's fear.

798
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,299
Hey, man.

799
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:37,734
How you doing?

800
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:39,836
Thanks for hanging in there,
giving me the day.

801
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,372
How could I pass up
the chance for marlin?

802
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:44,007
Are we good to go?

803
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,708
Just got to wait
for the crew to board.

804
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,777
Who's this guy?

805
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,580
Oh, he drives the boat.

806
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,518
Here comes your crew.

807
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,028
Permission to come aboard?

808
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,830
God, I love that accent.
(CHUCKLES)

809
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:08,431
Permission granted.

810
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,633
Come on, girls.

811
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:13,837
Look, man.
Eat, drink, fish.

812
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,772
Compliments of Ivan Block.

813
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:18,174
He's not gonna match
the UB terms,

814
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,810
but we do want you
to think of us as friends

815
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:24,914
so, if you ever decide to switch,
we'll be your first call.

816
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,019
Have fun.

817
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,088
I'll try.

818
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,289
Hi.

819
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,657
SHECKY: Well, hi.

820
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,798
SHECKY: (EXHALES)
I'm a fucking idiot.

821
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,634
They are very good-looking.

822
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,906
It's my own fault.

823
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:51,474
I can't blame you,
you're nothing.

824
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:52,942
I've got everything.

825
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:55,545
I've got a great wife, a
baby on the way, a business.

826
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:56,946
And I've got to come to Costa
Rica and act like an asshole.

827
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,952
I'm sure Block's gonna
press the terms now.

828
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:06,122
No, actually,

829
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,559
the terms are the same
ones we offered you.

830
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:12,495
Block wants you to feel great
about working with us.

831
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,330
Question is, where am
I gonna be working?

832
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:17,667
You can still work in London.
(SCOFFS)

833
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:22,272
Yeah, but will my checks be
coming from a Costa Rican bank,

834
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:25,708
or Caymans, or Malta,
or somewhere else?

835
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:27,544
I've heard the whispers.

836
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,948
Block's not too popular
around these parts anymore.

837
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,883
One of the reasons
I was gonna stay away.

My man. You got it?

842
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,573
Got it.

can you get 30 racks?

Right?

By Sunday, 200,000
of these penguins

849
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,754
will be betting
football on our site.

850
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:14,023
By the weekend, we'll
be doing nine million.

851
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,491
We'll lose some of them,

852
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:17,694
but luckily, we got Shecky out
there bringing them back for us,

853
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:19,128
so, we're gonna
be all right.

854
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,798
And this is
my thanks to you.

855
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,100
It's a little bonus to show
how much we appreciate you.

856
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,302
You're a fucking man and you
did what you had to do.

857
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:27,937
Spend it all in one place.

Knock yourself out.
Do some degenerate shit.

859
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:31,708
Do it in my car.

00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,543
Which one?
Whichever one you want.

00:43:33,545 --> 00:43:36,212

can't do this.

If you like me,
what's the problem?

871
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,924
You know what
the problem is.

872
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,962
You're right, I should
probably call you a car.

Mmm-hmm.

I think
that's the best idea.

My father described this place
as a gambler's paradise.

879

But to be honest, I never
really put too much stock

880
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,747
into what my father
had to say, ever.

Especially about gambling.

882
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:54,283
Well,
as a gaming professional,

883
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:56,819
that's exactly the type of
customer I want in the world.

00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:58,054
You would love him then.

I'm sorry.

As my friend?

talking about?

Just tell him.

914

Tell me.

915
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,792
I'm leaving
my girl's hotel room

916
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:11,561
this morning when
this real hard-ass,

917
00:47:11,563 --> 00:47:14,697
Agent Whatever-the-fuck-his-name-is,
from the FBI,

918
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:16,833
rolls up on me, tells me
I'm breaking U.S. fiduciary...

to kiss your ass.

He can't touch us down here.

923
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:24,740
He said some scary
shit about Block.

924
00:47:24,742 --> 00:47:26,776
He's a government
functionary, Pet.

That's what they do.

926
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:30,646
Block is the biggest trophy that
Shavers could ever take down.

927
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:32,148
Who gives a shit
what he says?

928
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,483
He told me I could be barred
from re-entering the country

929
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:35,818
if I didn't leave now.

930
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,221
So, what are you gonna do,
try and re-open your skin?

931
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:39,755
My brother owns a broker-dealer,
he offered me a job.

1092
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:28,650
Now, Richie, this is what I'm
willing to do for you, man.

1093
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:31,120
So I'll talk to the sergeant and
have him wipe the slate clean.

1094
00:56:31,122 --> 00:56:32,688
You'll never know this happened.
How about that?

1095
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,256
You want me to
do that for you, huh?

1096
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:35,724
Sergeant, can you do that?

1097
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:38,427
See that? Look at
that smile on his face.

1098
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:39,995
See, that's
the problem, Richie.

1099
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:43,465
I keep fucking doing for you,
so when are you gonna do for me?

1100
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:45,033
When's it gonna be my turn?

1101
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:46,635
BARRANCAS: When's it going
to be our turn?

1102
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:49,104
What are you, the only guy
here not on Block's payroll?

1103
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:50,472
(GRUNTING)

1104
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:51,774
(GROANING)

1105
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:53,942
All right!
RICHIE: Fuck, man!

1106
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:56,912
Why don't you just
fucking arrest him?

1107
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:59,481
You guys don't have jurisdictional
issues like the FBI!

1108
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:02,017
But if I walk him into a
station house or a courtroom,

1109
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:04,286
what do you think
he's going to do, huh?

1110
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:07,189
He's going to buy the judge a steak
dinner and I don't have a job!

1111
00:57:07,191 --> 00:57:11,427
All you got to do is help us
and all this goes away.

1112
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,996
Otherwise, you better brush
up on your prison Spanish

1113
00:57:13,998 --> 00:57:15,130
because they don't
take too kind

1114
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:17,433
<i>to gringo drug
dealers down here.</i>

1115
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:33,482
ANDREW: Richie. Jesus,
where the hell you been, man?

1116
00:57:33,484 --> 00:57:35,050
What the fuck happened
to your face?

1117
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:37,019
Nothing.
What did you want to show me?

1118
00:57:37,021 --> 00:57:38,587
All right.

1119
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:40,989
So they got me running these
credit card security protocols.

1120
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:42,858
And I get in there,
into the code,

1121
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,561
and I decide to freelance
around a little bit, right?

1122
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:48,297
So, I find there's nothing in the
individual players' accounts.

1123
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:49,465
What do you mean,
"nothing"?

1124
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,266
Nothing.
Practically drained, dude.

1125
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:52,935
They keep enough in there
to cover the floats.

1126
00:57:52,937 --> 00:57:54,937
So if any given player
wanted to cash out,

1127
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:57,005
the software would find the
money and then pay him off.

1128
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:58,507
In the meantime,
Block's just using

1129
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:00,609
everybody else's
funds as his own.

1130
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:02,177
Wait. So,
what are you saying?

1131
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:03,612
This whole fucking thing
is a Ponzi scheme.

1132
00:58:03,614 --> 00:58:05,681
ARCHIE: Hey, Richie!

1133
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:07,316
Block's upstairs.
He wants to see you.

1134
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:08,550
All right.

1135
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:11,720
(TYPING)

1136
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,862
IVAN: Hey.

1137
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:21,864
Come on in, Richie.
Have a seat.

1138
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:24,066
(GRUNTS)

1139
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:30,205
So, Richie,
here's the thing.

1140
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:33,442
People often make poor decisions
when they're desperate.

1141
00:58:33,444 --> 00:58:34,243
You know what I mean?

1142
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:36,845
No.

1143
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,947
What do you mean?

1144
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:40,782
Let's say you're being
charged by a bear.

1145
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:42,651
You're supposed
to stand still.

1146
00:58:42,653 --> 00:58:44,686
Most people run and they
end up getting killed.

1147
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:47,489
It's understandable, right?

1148
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:48,624
Let me show you something.

1149
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,495
I really have Wilson
to thank for this.

1150
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:54,997
He don't look like much,
but he's a dog

1151
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:57,132
with a bone when
he gets an assignment.

1152
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:59,835
This is some surveillance
footage he dug up.

1153
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:10,312
Would you look at that?

1154
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:13,515
Take a few years off him and the old guy
really does look like you, doesn't he?

1155
00:59:13,517 --> 00:59:15,617
This is the Trop in AC.

1156
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,323
If I wasn't your friend, I'd
say your dad was a deadbeat.

1157
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:25,360
There isn't a casino,
a bookmaker, or shylock

1158
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:27,763
from Vegas to New York

1159
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:31,266
that the old man isn't into
for some serious wood.

1160
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:33,835
You owe money like that,
you get a reputation.

1161
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:36,271
That's how I knew
how to find him.

1162
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:38,407
And now hopefully
we can get him some help.

1163
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:41,043
And get you
some help, too.

1164
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,179
This is my favorite part,
right here.

1165
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:45,581
Look at this.

1166
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:48,617
That isn't just card counting,
that's passing a bobo.

1167
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,819
Turns out, the old man's been
kiting counterfeit bills

1168
00:59:50,821 --> 00:59:51,920
from Tunica to Nevada.

1169
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,189
They were about
to arrest him

1170
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:56,291
before I grabbed him up.

1171
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:58,961
In fact, I have him over at
the Intercontinental Hotel,

1172
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:00,495
just down the street.

1173
01:00:00,497 --> 01:00:02,097
Here's the thing, Richie.

1174
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:06,602
Your dad owes $187,000 to some
guys that don't fuck around.

1175
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:09,004
But you're my man, and you
took some hits for me.

1176
01:00:09,006 --> 01:00:10,739
And I don't forget that.

1177
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:15,077
So this is what I did.
I bought the debt.

1178
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:16,945
I own the paper
on your father.

1179
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,614
The only person who can
do anything to him now

1180
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:20,816
is me.

1181
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:24,086
Which is good news, because I would
never do anything like that.

1182
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:26,421
I hold the debt,
your dad stays healthy,

1183
01:00:26,423 --> 01:00:28,624
and we can all go back
to exactly how it was.

1184
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:30,325
Okay?

1185
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,396
Yeah, thank you.

1186
01:00:34,398 --> 01:00:35,764
I appreciate it.

1187
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:40,902
Richie?

1188
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,639
Uh, come in.

1189
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,176
Sit.

1190
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:51,980
See this?

1191
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,718
What do you think?
This is where they put me.

1192
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,886
It's a real soft spot, huh?

1193
01:00:57,888 --> 01:00:58,854
It's real nice, Dad.

1194
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:04,359
Yeah, it reminds me of that suite we
were comped in Atlantic City once

1195
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:05,394
when you were a kid.

1196
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,632
Are you talking about the time you
left me all alone in the hotel room

1197
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:12,200
while you were
at the casino?

1198
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:15,070
Look, Rich, you know,

1199
01:01:15,072 --> 01:01:17,706
I wish I had a time machine, I'd
go back and I'd fix everything,

1200
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,808
but I don't.

1201
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,211
We're here now.

1202
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,016
And where do you think
"here" is? Huh?

1203
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,185
Paradise?

1204
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,754
Well, you know, it kind
of looks that way to me.

1205
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:37,893
Let's go out on the balcony.
Check out the view.

1206
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,300
Look, I know where I am,
all right?

1207
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:48,603
And I knew exactly what was happening
the minute my debt got bought

1208
01:01:48,605 --> 01:01:50,439
and they offer me this trip.

1209
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:52,274
Come on.

1210
01:01:52,276 --> 01:01:54,576
Been around gambling all my life,
and that would be a miracle.

1211

And miracles don't happen.

1212

You said he didn't even approach you.

Hey, Richie.
Where you going, babe?

1257
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,953
Going home.
Yeah?

1258
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:52,988
Why don't you
do that later?

1259
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,890
Come take
a ride with me.

1260
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:05,967
Wilson.

1261
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,570
Where are we going?

1262
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:11,072
Don't worry about it.
Enjoy the ride, man.

1263
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,659
So neither of you guys are gonna
tell me what the fuck we're doing?

1264
01:05:30,661 --> 01:05:31,993
Get off the boat.
Come on.

01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:44,172
Hey. Richie, remember, um,
that whole thing

1269
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:46,641
I was telling you
about the Indians?

1270
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:50,211
Not the casino thing, but the
respecting what you kill.

Or whatever that
hokum shit was.

here's the deal with this.

Bet is $10,000.

1275
01:05:59,222 --> 01:06:00,956
Do I pay you guys enough
to jump in on 10 grand?

1276
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,457
Yeah, I take the over.
How's that?

1277
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,792
What the fuck
you talking about?

1278

it's gonna be two minutes

get the fucking scent.

Your problem is with me,
let him go.

01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:24,379
Hey, Herrera, if you hadn't
acted like an asshole,

1288
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:26,047
you wouldn't be on
your knees right now.

1289
01:06:26,049 --> 01:06:28,283
So don't try
to be noble.

1290
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:30,618

There's just
a fucking ton of them.

Cruise ships come down here,
they dump off their edible waste,

1294
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:39,227
the crocs have learned
to swim downriver

1295
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:40,362
and they know to bite
whatever jumps in the water.

1297

but for some reason

1299
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:47,902
these fuckers
really like poultry.

1300
01:06:47,904 --> 01:06:48,737
All right, go ahead.

1301
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,111
All right, ready?
Ready to fire it up?

1302
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:57,579
Wilson, keep the clock.
Here we go.

01:07:10,494 --> 01:07:11,659
You scared the shit
out of them.

1311
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:12,727
Can we fucking
pull them back in?

1312
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:14,162
Hold on. Shh, shh.

1313
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:15,830
Do you hear them?

1314
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:17,599
I'm fucking talking
to you, motherfucker!

1315

Ivan!

1316
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:20,502
We got fucking money
on this, dude. Chill.

1317
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:21,569
You've scared
the shit out of them.

1318
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:23,304
Why don't you just
pull them back in?

1319
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:24,572
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1320
01:07:24,574 --> 01:07:25,907
Dude...

1321
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:28,143
I'm doing this
for you, man.

1322

1325

10 dimes. 90 seconds.

1326

1327
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,786
Fucking bullshit
local legend, I guess.

1328
01:07:37,788 --> 01:07:39,287
Give me the fucking thing.

1329
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:40,622
All right, calm down.
Fuck me.

1330
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:44,392
It's just a little fun,
that's all.

1337
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:55,603

1340
01:07:58,875 --> 01:07:59,774
I'm not getting them out.
You get them out.

1341
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:01,342
Pull them in.

1342
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:02,577
WILSON: Holy fuck, man.
Come on.

1343
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:05,747
Let's go.

1344
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,182
What are the odds?
I was kidding around.

1345
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:09,918
I didn't really think
crocodiles would come.

1346

(CHUCKLES) We just
got lucky, I guess.

1347
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,090
Are you all right, Richie?

1348
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:16,858
You seem a little worked up,
a little sweaty.

1349
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,927
Is it the hot night or...

1350
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:20,595
Are you okay?

1351
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:21,830
Yeah, I'm good.

1352
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:24,766
Okay, good.

1353
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,501
Terrific.

1354
01:08:26,503 --> 01:08:28,670
All right, clean them up.
Let's get them out of here.

1355
01:08:28,672 --> 01:08:29,604
(GROANING)

1356
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,108
Good luck. Hey,
how did that horse do?

1357
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,642

I'm fucking with you.

1360
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,413
I know
this isn't a good time.

1361
01:08:38,415 --> 01:08:40,215
All right, let's go.
Let's go.

1362
01:08:40,217 --> 01:08:41,449
See you soon, Richie.

1363
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,601
Cronin?

1364
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:02,904
Andrew?

1365
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:05,206
Cronin.

(EXHALES)

1368
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:27,395
What's happened?

1369
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,698
Did Block send you?

1370
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,667
No, he didn't send me.

1371
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,638
Something's happened
to Cronin.

1372
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,207
He was cooperating
with the Feds.

1373
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:40,375
But you knew that already,
didn't you?

1374
01:09:40,377 --> 01:09:41,776
I didn't.
Bullshit.

1375
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:43,912
Let me ask you a question.

1376
01:09:43,914 --> 01:09:45,680
When I talk to you,
am I talking to Block?

1377
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,916
Not anymore.
I wish I could believe that.

1378
01:09:47,918 --> 01:09:49,050
You can.
You can trust...

1379
01:09:49,052 --> 01:09:50,318
No, I can't trust you.

1380
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,819
I did trust you!

1381
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:53,087
I didn't know that he
was going to use you.

1382
01:09:53,089 --> 01:09:55,290
Stop fucking lying to me!

1383
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,129
Ivan is set to pull out
of this place in a week.

1384
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:02,630
We're moving to Antigua.

1385
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:04,199
And?

1386
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:06,534
And he's looking to
hang things on someone.

1387
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:07,569
A mark.

1388
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,239
Me.

1389
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:13,775
And when he's gone, all of those
people that we've crossed,

1390
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:15,410
they're gonna come
looking for you.

1391
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,313
How long have
you known this?

1392
01:10:18,315 --> 01:10:19,948
I started wondering
after two years.

1393
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:21,549
By the third year,
when we left the Caymans,

1394
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,318
I knew for sure
that he was stealing.

1395
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,720
But by that point
I was too far in.

1396
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:27,989
I'd signed a contract,
there was a paper trail.

1397
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:29,691
That's what Ivan
does to you.

1398
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,963
He figures out
exactly what you want

1399
01:10:34,965 --> 01:10:36,698
and he gives it to you.

1400
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:41,869
I'm sorry.

1401
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,574
I hope so.

1402
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:49,744
