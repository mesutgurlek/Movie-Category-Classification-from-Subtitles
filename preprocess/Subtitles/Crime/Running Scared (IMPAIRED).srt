You didn't call, you son of a bitch.

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,639
Let me guess.
My pearls you've been promising?

74
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,636
lt's nothing, just a little recycling.

75
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:29,755
Joey, come on.

76
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:32,229

Ssh.

78
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:36,472

Cos there's no way in hell i'm gonna be

Now, Joey, come on. No, no, no, no

On select occasions. What else?

<i>- Fuck! Come on !

You use language like that,

Go find Nicky.
l think he's up in the bedroom with Oleg.

100
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:06,554
Why's he always with that Russky kid?
Don't he have no other friends?

101
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:09,712
Joey, you know, they get along. it's fine.
What do you want?

102
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:12,553

That's what l want.

Good night, Oleg.

118
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:05,199
Good night, Mrs Gazelle.

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,153
He's not even up there.

120
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:14,198
They turned the basement
into a sports complex again.

121
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:17,989
- How many times am l supposed to tell him?
- What do you want? They're just boys.

122
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,352
Dad, l won't do it again, l swear.

Hey, can Oleg come?

134
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:03,277
He's never been to one game, and he's...

135
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:05,828
Not this time.
Sal could only score me a pair of tickets.

136
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:07,512
Maybe next time, though.

When l was growing up in Kishinev

l pick-pocketed a key off this apparatchik.

166
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:22,879
The man gave me as a reward
this children's projector.

167
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,916
lt came with three films.

168
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,910
Speedy Gonzales, Tarzan Of The Apes,
John Wayne in The Cowboys.

169
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,312
l watched that thing a thousand times.

170
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,116
Anzor, it's getting cold.

171
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,316
l was nine years old.

172
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,553
l didn't know how long movies
were supposed to be.

173
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:56,349
My version of The Cowboys,
it was only 1 0 minutes long.

174
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:59,000
No John Wayne getting shot.

175
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,279
Because it was for kids, they left that part out.

176
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,477
l didn't know this...until l arrive in America

177
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:13,836
and see it on TV for the first time.

178
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,711
l hate it. l want my 8mm back.

179
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,314
Because on that one, the Duke lives.

180
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,910
Some things were better in the old place.

181
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,756
Not too many. Some things.

182
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,996
Let me show you from the beginning.

183
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,916
No, no, no. Not forward.

184
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,236
This part's better.

185
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,356
Without the Duke?

186
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,632
Where are you going?

187
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:04,676
You don't walk out on the Duke!

188
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,196
Govnyak!

189
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,872
She said he's always distracted
and he never finishes his work,

190
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:16,916
and she wants to get him tested.

191
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,434
She wants to get him tested? Tested for what?

192
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:23,751
l think maybe er...attention disorder
or something.

193
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,353
l'm not fucking ADD.

194
00:16:25,353 --> 00:16:27,749
Hey! You don't use that word
in front of your mother.

195
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:30,673
- What's wrong with ADD?
- The other one, smartass.

196
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,199
He don't use that word, period.

197
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,033
l don't wanna be on medication.
You can't make me take it.

198
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:40,989
Don't even worry about it. There's no way in hell
anybody's gonna put you on meds, OK?

199
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:44,152
Tell that teacher to come to the rink
and watch him wax that puck.

200
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:47,789
- That's perfect concentration every time.
- That's different, Joe.

201
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:50,792
We're just trying to find out
what's going on with you .

202
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,552
She said some great things too.

203
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:55,791
She said that he's very bright,
that he's very creative.

204
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,236
You left that part out before. l like that part.

205
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:01,276
l got potential.

206
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,672
You taking a collection down there?

207
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,956
He must eat.

208
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,395
The little prick insults the Duke...

209
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,276
..he don't eat in this house.

210
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,589
You hear me, you little snot face?

211
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,318
Stay in your room!

212
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:03,356
Jerk off to your fucking Razors!

213
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,632
<i>Faggot!</i>

214
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,356
He's a growing boy.

215
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,036
What did l fucking say, sukka?

216
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,836
He has to eat, Anzor.

217
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,353
Please.

218
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:31,432
Who puts food on this fucking table?

219
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,916
Not you, blyad.

220
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,791
l'm the big man of this house.

221
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,792
When l say the little shit don't eat, he don't eat.

222
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,836
Anzor.

223
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,357
John Wayne was a faggot.

224
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,314
So Vicki Gilleto told me she saw you walking
hand in hand with Jeannie's daughter.

225
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:55,356
- The fat one?
(Gunshot)

226
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,116
Sounded like a gun.

227
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,076
Hey, Nick, throw me some bread.

228
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,476
Oh, shit, get down ! Get down !

229
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,872
Are you OK? You OK?

230
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:10,313
Jesus, Joe. What the hell?

231
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:12,118
Stay here. Motherfucker.

232
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:15,875
- Motherfucker! l'll kill that fucking piece of shit.
- Where are you going?

233
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,837
You Russian piece of shit!

234
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:19,717
Fucking cunt.

236
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,348
Dad, wait!

Get back in the house.
Get back in the house!

238
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,478
Get back in now! Go!

239
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:31,516
(Gunshot)

240
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,029
Don't you move.

241
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:36,189
You piece of shit.

242
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:38,840

-Nick, get inside.

243
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,956
Joe. Joe! What's the matter with you?

244
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:43,235

248
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:52,390
- Open the door.
- Joey, don't be a damn hero!

249
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,233
Open up! lt's Joey Gazelle from next door!
Open up!

250
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:57,276
Open up.

251
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,436
Get back. You get back.

252
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,518
Where is he? ls he upstairs?

253
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:04,953
- His room.

254
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,996
- His room.
- Get down.

255
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,156
What the fuck?

256
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:17,595
Where's the kid? Huh?

257
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,917
- Where's the kid?
- Fuck him. l'm the one who's shot.

258
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:28,956
Who is it? ls he still in the house?

259
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:30,712
The little snotfuck ran out back.

260
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,911
Oleg?

261
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:36,434
Oleg? What are you trying to say?
Oleg shot you?

262
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:38,476
What are you?

263
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:40,516
A fucking idiot?

264
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:42,556
l didn't do this to myself.

265
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,230
The little prick would've done me too.

266
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,196
Look at him.

267
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,596
(Soundless)

268
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,559
(Gunshot)

269
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,558
(Shot)

270
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,116
Jesus, it's a fucking miracle.

271
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,670
Where'd he get the fucking piece?

272
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,830
- Fuck should l know?
- What, it wasn't yours?

273
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,876
No ! No way !

274
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,034
l got a .357 in the safe out back.

275
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,876
He had some fucking snub-nose thing.

276
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,035
Silver. Chrome.

277
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,350
Bullshit! Now you tell me.
l'm not playing around.

278
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,113
We saw where you put the gun
but he didn't take anything.

279
00:21:56,113 --> 00:21:58,555
- Not with me.
- Well, he went back, Nicky.

280
00:21:58,555 --> 00:22:00,995
l didn't know. l swear l didn't know.

281
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,470
Come here. Listen to me. Listen to me.

282
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,596
That piece? That's not just any hot piece.

283
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:09,592
- Tommy used it to burn a dirty cop.
- Oh, no. Joe...

284
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:12,513
Yeah. Listen.
On top of it, that kid's out there right now.

285
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:17,355
The cops are on their way. lf they find the gun,
or they find the kid and he talks, l'm dead.

286
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,356
- Fuck!
- Calm down. Calm down.

287
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:22,158
Calm down. We can get to him.

288
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:25,152
- You can get to the gun before the cops do.
- Oh, shit.

289
00:22:25,152 --> 00:22:27,196
(Sirens)

290
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,638
Hey.

291
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,475
- Where are you gonna take him?
- Memorial.

292
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,951
Hey, Mila, you should go with him.

293
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:47,112
l'm gonna look for Oleg.
Me and Nicky are gonna go find him, OK?

294
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:49,634
l'll get Teresa to stay here
in case he comes back.

295
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,199
- You should go.
- Thanks, Joey.

296
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,918
- Yeah, no problem.
- l'm sorry.

297
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:55,434
We're gonna find him. Don't worry about it.

298
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:57,476
(Police sirens)

299
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,109
Motherfuck.

300
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,591
(Car doors slam)

301
00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:08,636
Come on.

302
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,036
(Door opens)

303
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:17,634
Police officers. Sir, do you live here?

304
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:19,676
No. No, actually l live next door.

305
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:22,274
l heard gunshots,
so l came to see what's going on.

306
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:24,032
- What did you see?
- Er...

307
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,436
l saw Anzor, my neighbour, in the kitchen.
He'd been shot.

308
00:23:29,436 --> 00:23:32,273
- See who did it?
-No, he was screaming in Russian.

309
00:23:32,273 --> 00:23:34,999
His wife asked me to stick around for the kid.

310
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:37,036
- You don't know who shot him?
-No.

311
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,716
l'm gonna need to take a statement outside.

312
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:41,836
l can't have you messing up the scene.

313
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:43,876
Hey, check it out.

314
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,553
l don't see nothing inside.
Maybe all the way back.

315
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,916
Forget it. Leave it for Forensics.

316
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,396
Sir, l need for you to wait outside.

317
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,316
All right. No problem.

318
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,116
l'm fucking having a heart attack.

319
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,349
- Breathe.
- l gotta find this kid. l gotta find this kid tonight.

320
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,638
Nick, l need to know places.
lneed to know hideouts.

321
00:24:20,638 --> 00:24:23,393
Go to your room and make a list.
Nick, make a list!

322
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:25,516
- OK.
- l'm not fucking around, Nick.

323
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:27,670

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,279
l can't have to keep fucking talking to the cops.

328
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,920
You understand me?
The fucking gun is on the street.

329
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,355
This whole fucking thing's about to blow up.

330
00:24:54,355 --> 00:24:57,910
<i>lf Tommy or any of those fucking guys

335
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,552

Teenager. DUl car wreck.

341
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:06,117
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

342
00:26:06,117 --> 00:26:08,236
No, wait, he took a bullet right here.

No, major trauma to chest.
He's been in surgery all day.

344
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,037
The guy was a cop.

345
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:16,556
Oh, wait. Yeah, they did bring someone in
about 40 minutes ago.

You looking for this? Yugorsky? GSW shoulder?

Yeah. Anzor Yugorsky.

368

Any relation to lvan Yugorsky?

369
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:44,633
My uncle.

370
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:48,076
The Czar of Brighton Beach.
l've been to his club a couple of times.

371
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:49,479
Nice joint.

372
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,516
He even sang a few songs.

373
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,718
He sings like a fucking toad.

374
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:57,429
Well, Sinatra he's not,
but he's a man with a serious reputation.

375
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,516
- He has a lot of enemies.
- Bullshit.

376
00:29:00,516 --> 00:29:04,036

00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:06,714
Yeah. Well, l spoke to the officers on the scene.

378
00:29:06,714 --> 00:29:08,711
There was no sign of forced entry.

379
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:11,360
But they did find some interesting shit out back.

380
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,591
Six cases of NyQuil,
and it ain't even cold season.

381
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:16,955
What do you think a search warrant's

382
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,676
- Come on. Where?

Be cool. And let me do all the talking.

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,036
How much you got?

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,431
Oh, l got a lot.

392
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,955
Yes.

393
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,916
Oleg, it's Nicky. Are you in there?

394
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,596
- This the spot?
- Mm.

395
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,077
Hey, where's the stash?

396
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,116
Last stall, motherfucker.

397
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,796
Find the stash. Find it.

398
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,996
Go on. Find it.

399
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,996
(Shouts) Find it!

400
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,558
We're gonna search this entire park.
He might still be around.

401
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,275
What the fuck do you think you're doin',
white boy?

402
00:31:21,275 --> 00:31:24,716
All right, drop it, or l'll fucking waste the midget.

403
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,395
Go ahead. He's just a tag-along.

404
00:31:28,395 --> 00:31:31,438
Plug 'em, Dell. Fuck it, man ! Fuck 'em up.

405
00:31:31,438 --> 00:31:33,875
(Confused shouting)

406
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,596
(Multiple gunshots)

407
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,358
All right, stay right by me.

408
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:55,112
Right here. Against the wall.

409
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:57,316
Don't you move. Stay right there.

410
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,193
l didn't do nothing, Officer. l just came to...

411
00:32:04,193 --> 00:32:06,669
Put your fucking head

412
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:08,591
Put your fucking head there!

413
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,592
Oleg.

414
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,113
l told you to stay outside.

415
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:18,795
- Did you find him?
- Get the fuck outside! Get out of here!

416

l'm talking to you ! What did you see?

417
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,437
Find a gun ? You find a silver gun ?
Did you find a fucking silver gun ?

418
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:26,748
l-l-l got no gun.

419
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,953
(Snarls)

420
00:32:30,953 --> 00:32:32,075
(Barking)

421
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,509
You wanna study for the GED? Here.

422
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,794
Look what you done to my fucking ride, bitch.

423
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,430
Jesus, please, baby. Please.

424
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,633
l've only been taking one class.
One class two hours a week.

425
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:04,756
l still got time to be pulling tricks.

426
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,875
Three Gs l fronted you
for these fucking airbags.

427
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,392
And what do l get in return ?

428
00:33:10,392 --> 00:33:12,277
- Fucking night school?
- l'll quit!

429
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,749
l'm super proud of you
for showing some initiative.

430
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:18,070
Maybe l'll even come to your graduation.

431
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,311
But first you're gonna give me back
my fucking property.

432
00:33:21,311 --> 00:33:23,038
(Gun cocks)

433
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,393
You learn how to use that
watching Sesame Street?

434
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,836
You ain't even holding it right.

435
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,395
What's the matter, kid? You got the shakes?

436
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,396
(Clicks)

437
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,989
Whoops.

438
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,315
Now l'm gonna put a smile on your face, boy.

439
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,678
Cheek to cheek.

440
00:33:52,678 --> 00:33:55,149
You're gonna be the happiest little brat
in school.

441
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:56,719
Say cheese.

442
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,155
Who's laughing now, you fucking grey meat
limp-dick motherfucker?

443
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:04,434
M ac Daddy !

(Coughs)

448
00:34:20,116 --> 00:34:22,156
(Gasps for breath)

449
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,356
Let me see your fingers, son.

450
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,916

00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,356
l'm taking care of him tonight, OK?

452
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,515
Unless you have the number of his doctor
and l can get a prescription over the phone,

453
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:44,272
you'll have to take him to Emergency.

454
00:34:44,272 --> 00:34:47,432
- lf you want me to call you a cab...

l need some spray shit for him!

456
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:52,669
That spray shit is a controlled substance,
ma'am, so what can l tell you?

457
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,518
- Keep the change.
- l can't... This is stupid. l can't do this.

458
00:34:57,518 --> 00:35:00,672
Listen, why don't we go in the back
and talk about it, OK?

459
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,150
- Look, lady...
- l'll take care of you .

460
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,233
- There's nothing l can do, lady.
- There's nothing you can do?

461
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,595
- Take him to Emergency.
- OK.

462
00:35:10,595 --> 00:35:11,908
OK.

463
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:14,355
Nothing you can fucking do?

464
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:17,193
Get what he needs. Now.

465
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,911
- lt's Beclovent.
- Yeah, l know.

466
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:21,035
Beclovent, bitch!

467
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,198
Come on, let's just go back.

468
00:35:23,198 --> 00:35:24,599
No.

469
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,716
lf he turns up, your mom's gonna call.

470
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,472
(Phone rings)

471
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:31,710
Tee.

472
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,356
Sal.

473
00:35:35,356 --> 00:35:37,351
Yeah.

474
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,431
- Do girls really get naked in there?
- You'll find out when you're 21 .

475
00:35:45,431 --> 00:35:47,909
l've seen Mom naked. It's no big deal.

476
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,711
Trust me on this one. It's always a big deal.

477
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,473
Stay here.

478
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,636
? Funky dance music

479
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,756
What?

480
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,956
lt's taken care of.

481
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:34,996
Oh. It's taken care of. Lucky us.

<i>RYDELL: Guys slt down Have a seat</i>

483
00:36:38,592 --> 00:36:40,636
Don't be shy.

484
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,868
They make a good Mai Tai for a twat bar,
but seriously overpriced.

485
00:36:45,868 --> 00:36:48,474
Two million dollars for a round of drinks.

486
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:50,516
And the pussy ain't even that hot.

487
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,473
Jody, l'm doin' business here.
Jody! Come on, get the fuck out of here.

488
00:36:55,473 --> 00:36:57,073
Two million dollars.

489
00:36:57,073 --> 00:36:59,879
Suck a dick, you prick bastard.
You don't have shit on us.

490
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:01,791
What do you think of this?

491
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:05,555
Cops never found these at the scene.
Just two dead narcs and three dead Jamaicans.

492
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:08,438
Ballistics is gonna reveal the slugs
that killed my partners

493
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:10,431
didn't come from the Jamaicans.

494
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:12,511
So there were others involved.

495
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:15,433
As for myself...erm...l was never there.

496
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,350
Well...

497
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,512
dead guys tell no tales.

498
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:22,910
Yeah. Why don't you ask your pal here?

499
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,518
What the fuck you talkin' about?

500
00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:29,319
You blew my partner Stevie's balls off
with a .38 snub nose.

501
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:31,311
A real distinctive piece.

502
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:34,198
Stainless. Polished up like a spic's hubcap.

503
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,596
Now, let me take a wild guess here.

504
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,669
<i>l think you gave him the gun
to dump ln the rlver</i>

505
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,990
<i>Now l'm assuming that he never
got around to lt hecause two hours ago</i>

506
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,469
<i>hls next-door nelghhour
took a slug ln the shoulder</i>

507
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:50,358
The shooter was the guy's 1 0-year-old stepson.

508
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:52,795
Who was over at Gazelle's house
two hours earlier.

509
00:37:52,795 --> 00:37:55,030
What the fuck you tryin' to do here? Huh?

510
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,439
You tryin' to fuckin' play us?

511
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:58,750
You're wasting your time, and this is bullshit.

512
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,796
Bullshit? Bullshit, huh?

513
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,636
This punk, Anzor Yugorsky?

514
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:06,188
He describes the gun to me in vivid detail.

515
00:38:06,188 --> 00:38:10,034
Makes mention it's a snub nose
with a serious shine to it.

516
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,390
- The fuck is this guy talkin' about?
- He's talkin' about a fuckin' shiny gun.

517
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,199
Big deal. There's a thousand on the street.
lt ain't the piece.

518
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:21,876
Oh, yeah? What were you doing at the hospital
when they brought Yugorsky in ? Huh?

519
00:38:21,876 --> 00:38:24,110
<i>Snlffing around Emergency</i>

on the slug they took out of hlm</i>

522
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:31,712
My wife asked me to go to the hospital.

523
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:33,995
She was concerned, in a neighbourly way.
She wanted me...

524
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:37,356
All right, you know what? Enough bullshit.
l expect to find a bag...

525
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,000
in this locker at Down Neck Station by midnight.

526
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,833

- You want some coffee, or somethin' to eat?
- Nah, l'm good.

Yeah, Tony, get him some fries
and a strawberry shake.

548

Don't scare him. He don't know you're coming.

<i>So Joe</i>

550
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:02,153
l got off the phone with lvan
about this thing with his nephew.

551
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:04,674
l told you, it's not the fuckin' piece.

552
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,190
Look, everybody knows the nephew
is a brain -fried reprobate.

553
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,157
Yeah, whatever. He's a tweaker piece of shit.

554
00:40:11,157 --> 00:40:13,435
And he's cooking meth in his backyard.

555
00:40:13,435 --> 00:40:16,353
lt's just a matter of time
before he blows up the neighbourhood.

But it's a sensitive issue with me, Joe.

You see, Joe, the tweaker's got it in his head

566
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:45,912
that maybe you were looking to knock him
out of the cooking business

567
00:40:45,912 --> 00:40:47,911
and helped the boy out.

568

Made a piece available to him.

569
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,519
l would never use a kid to do something like that.

570
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,315
Never.

571
00:40:55,315 --> 00:40:57,356
All right, all right, look.

572
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,194

573
00:41:01,194 --> 00:41:04,397
that I'll have my entire crew in the street
out looking for that kid.

574
00:41:04,397 --> 00:41:07,597
Now, in the interest of professional harmony...

575
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,035
..l think we all wanna get our story straight.

<i>You agree don't you Joe?</i>

00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,916
Goddamn it, Nicky.

642
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:57,230
Why did you lie to me? Why did you lie to me?

l didn't.

644
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:00,756

- Why did you lie to me?
- l'm not fucking lying! l put it in there!

646
00:46:03,718 --> 00:46:06,553
You just fuckin' killed me, Nick.

647
00:46:06,553 --> 00:46:08,596
You just fuckin' killed me!

648
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,479
l want you to keep an eye open.

649
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:57,394
lf you see anybody coming,
l want you to cough really loud, all right?

650
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,754
(Voices, Nick coughs)

651
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,676
- You're like a broken record.
- l'm telling you, you gotta see this thing.

652
00:47:11,676 --> 00:47:13,716
You better not be jerking my chain.

- What are you doin' here, kid?
- l was looking for the bathroom.

654
00:47:16,997 --> 00:47:20,390
- Even the kid thinks it's a shithole back here.
- Shut up, Ralphie.

655
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:21,754
All right, listen.

656
00:47:21,754 --> 00:47:23,239
You go on out through that door,

657

659
00:47:27,072 --> 00:47:28,309
You got it?

660
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,314
- Come on.

661
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,436
CHEF: Come here, kid. Come here.

662
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,916
Hey, Yolanda. Wait up!

Look, baba, why don't you just go home?

668

Oh, mother...

00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,036
Get off! Get off!

677
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,554
(Rap playing on stereo)

678
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,076
Do you know these guys?

679
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,716
(Cellphone rings)

680
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,196
- Yeah.

681
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,960
<i>- Where the hell are you?
- l'm takin' care of things</i>

682
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,838
Forget about it - they picked up Oleg
at a bus station with a hooker.

683
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:33,070
Who picked him up?

684
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,957
- The cops?
- Yeah.

685
00:49:34,957 --> 00:49:37,235
Jesus Christ, this is fuckin' bullshit.

686
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:38,753
<i>- Hey.

Yeah, he's right here.

689
00:49:41,954 --> 00:49:44,395
Then stop using your mouth around him!

690
00:49:44,395 --> 00:49:46,835
And bring my son home! Now!

691
00:49:46,835 --> 00:49:50,310
Yeah. That's what l'm doing.
l'm bringing him home right now.

692
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,992
(Tyres screech)

693
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,076
(Drink fizzes)

694
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,040
Ah. Do you mind?

695
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,076
l'm feeling kind of parched.

696
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,158
Big game Friday night.

697
00:50:08,158 --> 00:50:09,878
l bet you're excited about that, huh?

698
00:50:09,878 --> 00:50:13,270
lt's gonna be red ice,
and plenty of blue shirt body bags.

699
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,316
Am l right?

700
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,072
Look...l could help you, kid.

701
00:50:20,072 --> 00:50:21,832
You and your mom, if need be.

702
00:50:21,832 --> 00:50:24,309
Now l could get that prick out of your life.

703
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,156
Lock him up. l could do that, l'm a cop.

704
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,715
All you have to do
is tell me where you found the gun.

705
00:50:31,715 --> 00:50:33,756
And where you stashed it.

706
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,479
That's it.

707
00:50:36,479 --> 00:50:38,516
What do you say?

708
00:50:38,516 --> 00:50:40,556
You'll let me help you .

709
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,116
Get out of here, Mila.

710
00:50:46,116 --> 00:50:48,760
You know? Go to a shelter.

711
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,796
l can get you an address.

712
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,076
You don't understand.

713
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,596
l belong to him.

714
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,356
No. No.

715
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:02,396
No, no, l don't understand.

716
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,796
l was prostitute in Moscow.

717
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,752
Yugorsky Escort Service offered to
bring girls over with promise of big bucks.

718
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,955
We would owe 50 thousand dollars.
You know, pay back through work.

719
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,717
l take offer.

720
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,756
Not tell them l'm pregnant.

721
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,236
When they find out...

722
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,076
..they insist l have an abortion.

723
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,076
l tell them no.

724
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,356
They send Anzor to kill me.

725
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,356
Anzor's not a killer.

726
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,031
He's not...a hard man like big Yugorsky.

727
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,076
(Sighs) He thinks...

728
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,516
..he thinks he's John Wayne.

729
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,796
Wants to do right thing.

730
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,869
He goes against his uncle, and tells
big man Yugorsky he will pay off my debt.

731
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,196
His uncle refuses...

732
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,036
..and tells him...

733
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,076
he will send others to kill me.

734
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,996
Set example.

735
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,756
So Anzor make me wife.

736
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,640
Big man Yugorsky can't kill his nephew's wife.

737
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,550
But he...tells Anzor to leave Little Odessa.

738
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:45,553
He's no longer working for Yugorsky family.

739
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,470
l'm gonna get you the name of a shelter.

740
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,516
(Car approaching, tyres screech)

741
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,316
(Tyres screech)

742
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,956
You OK?

743
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,429
This ain't right, Joe.
He don't need to be put through this.

744
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:13,478
Hey, Nick, l'm proud of you .
You done good, all right?

745
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,278
l'm gonna head up to Community Hills.

746
00:53:24,278 --> 00:53:28,592
Cops don't got the gun yet but l may have
a line on it so l'm gonna go over there.

747
00:53:28,592 --> 00:53:30,875
l'm scared, Joe.

748
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:34,111
l am pissed at you, and l am scared!

749
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:36,156
Equal measures.

750
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,873
Be careful.

751
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,958
- Hey.
- Hey.

752
00:53:55,958 --> 00:53:57,917
Just got word. The cops picked up the kid.

753
00:53:57,917 --> 00:54:01,390
<i>- Anything you stlll wanna tell us?
- Tell you what? There's nothing to tell.</i>

754
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,715
- Where you headed, Joe?
- Erm....

755
00:54:04,715 --> 00:54:07,758
l was supposed to head to the store
and pick up some milk and eggs.

756
00:54:07,758 --> 00:54:10,229
ln all the excitement l forgot to do it, so...

757
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:12,550
TOMM Y: Hm.

758
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,393
Yugorsky's gonna call us
when he talks to the kid.

759
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,756
<i>Don't go too far</i>

760
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,076
- Later, Joe.
- Yeah, see ya.

761
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,313
Hey, Tee. Looking fucking good.

762
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,356
He keeps giving me this bullshit story
about finding the gun

763
00:54:38,356 --> 00:54:40,715
in some abandoned locker in school.

764
00:54:40,715 --> 00:54:42,279
What do you want me to do?

765
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,079
The little fucker shot me.
He ain't gonna spill dick to me.

766
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:48,118
You know,
l don't think l'm being clear enough here.

767
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,156
You know what l mean ?

768
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,196
Let me be crystal clear.

769
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,752
You get the boy to give up Gazelle
or l'm closing shop on your tweaker ass

770
00:54:58,752 --> 00:55:00,910

No! Oh, my God! l've never seen him.

782

- Where is he?
- OK, OK!

787
00:55:59,238 --> 00:56:01,197

He's at Armando's. Yeah.

790

01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,876
Hey, Holmes.

955
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,477
- l got a busted headlight.
- Hey, Lester, my man !

956
01:06:15,477 --> 01:06:17,915
Ouch. Who got over on you , bro?

957
01:06:17,915 --> 01:06:22,630
Some puta whose forwarding address
is gonna be in ten different zip codes.

958
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:24,551
All of them, dumpsters.

959
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:26,392
(Both laugh)

960
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,956
l got you covered by tomorrow night.

961
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,835
Hey, check this out.

962
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,111
ls that sweet or what? Hey!
A royal flush put her in my pocket.

963
01:06:37,111 --> 01:06:40,510
- Three hundred cold puts her in mine.
-No, man. She's a beauty.

964
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:42,556
Think l'm gonna hold on to her.

965
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,629
Five hundred.

966
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,879
Al won't miss them. Not until Cinco de Mayo.

967
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,948
Oh, Joe! Shit!

968
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,398
l'm under a lot of stress tonight,
so whatever l say don't count.

969
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,514
Do l still have to go to school tomorrow?

970
01:07:14,514 --> 01:07:16,556
l don't know. We'll see.

971
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,836
- Remember me?
- Who the fuck are you?

972
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,949
You got something that belongs to me.
Snub nose .38.

973
01:07:37,949 --> 01:07:40,474
You scored it off of Manny in a card game.

974
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,918
JOEY: Fuck!

975
01:07:45,918 --> 01:07:48,150

976
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:50,196
<i>Who the fuck are you huh ?</i>

977
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,956
JOEY: Don't be fucking stupid!

978
01:07:52,956 --> 01:07:54,996
Fuck!

979
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,272
(Curses in Spanish)

980
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,914
You fuck! You fuck! Where's my fucking gun ?

981
01:08:17,914 --> 01:08:19,911
Help me! l'm burning!

982
01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:22,389
Where's my gun ?
You gonna tell me where my gun is now?

983
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:26,553
lf you don't tell me where l can find it you'll have
third-degree burns. Know what that means?

984
01:08:26,553 --> 01:08:29,438
No cock, asshole!
You'll have a fucking melted dick!

985
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,238
- l sold it to a pimp. Lester!
- A pimp?

986
01:08:31,238 --> 01:08:33,276
Shit! What you waiting on for?

987
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:35,237
Where can l find him?
Where can l find him?

988
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:39,393
- l need to fucking know now!
- He booked a cab! Union Fleet. Ask them!

989
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,112
Stay here. Do not move.

990
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:02,116
OLEG: l'm not touching it.
Get away from me. Fuck you !

991
01:09:02,116 --> 01:09:04,395
DEZ: Ow, you little shit! Just bit me!

992
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,676
(Doorbell)

993
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,953
DEZ: Who the hell is that?
EDELE: l'll go see. Throw me my robe.

994
01:09:15,953 --> 01:09:17,439
Take the kids into the bedroom.

995
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,836
- May l help you?
- l'm looking for Oleg.

996
01:09:39,836 --> 01:09:43,071
- Oleg. You must have the wrong address.
-No. He's a ten -year-old boy.

997
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:45,310
He's pale. He never smiles.

998
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:48,312
He's my neighbour's kid.
He called me from this apartment.

999
01:09:48,312 --> 01:09:50,550
Owens Park Lane, apartment 303.

1000
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:52,835
Well, he must have given you
the wrong address.

1001
01:09:52,835 --> 01:09:55,036
Or maybe you heard wrong. There's no Oleg.

1002
01:09:55,036 --> 01:09:57,429
He said that he was being held against his will.

1003
01:09:57,429 --> 01:10:01,229
That's ridiculous. There's only my husband
and my two children inside.

1004
01:10:01,229 --> 01:10:03,709
- No-one else. And it's late.
- Well...

1005
01:10:03,709 --> 01:10:06,394
l would like to take a look inside
to satisfy my curiosity.

1006
01:10:06,394 --> 01:10:08,835
This is absurd.
Are you suggesting l kidnapped Oleg?

1007
01:10:08,835 --> 01:10:13,357
You know what? l'm gonna call the police.
l'm gonna stand here waiting for them to arrive.

1008
01:10:13,357 --> 01:10:15,590
When all's you gotta do is just let me in.

1009
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,079
lf you must.

1010
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,556
- Do you mind?
- Go right ahead.

1011
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,076
The children 's room is on the right.

1012
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:43,912
They are asleep.

1013
01:10:43,912 --> 01:10:45,956
Please go right in.

1014
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,356
(Exhales heavily )

1015
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,109
- Hello.
- Don't ask, it's too ridiculous.

1016
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:01,156
Sorry, l'm really embarrassed.

1017
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,397
Excuse me,
but l seriously doubt he's hiding in there.

1018
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,636
(Dez mouths)

1019
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,596
- What's through here?
- Playroom.

1020
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,634
Whoa.

1021
01:11:25,634 --> 01:11:27,756
Wow.

1022
01:11:27,756 --> 01:11:29,956
You guys got your own little Disneyland in here.

1023
01:11:29,956 --> 01:11:34,238
Well, it's all about the children.
And as you can see, there's no Oleg.

1024
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,951
l really hope that you find him.

1025
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:49,156
You hear too many stories these days.

1026
01:11:49,156 --> 01:11:53,631
- God only knows if it were our children.
- lf it were your children...photographs.

1027
01:11:53,631 --> 01:11:55,676
- Excuse me!
- Photographs.

1028
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,956
No photographs.

1029
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,469
lf they were your children, you would have...

1030
01:12:02,469 --> 01:12:05,279
at least one photograph
somewhere in this apartment.

1031
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,796
This is ridiculous! We only moved
into this place. Everything's in storage.

1032
01:12:08,796 --> 01:12:12,236
Now l really must ask you to leave! l insist!

1033
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,356
Oleg?

1034
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,956
(Dez and Edele whispering)

1035
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,556
Oh, man. This is too much.

1036
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,114
lt's too much.

1037
01:12:35,114 --> 01:12:37,714
- lt's like some kind of a lure.
- You're making a mistake.

1038
01:12:37,714 --> 01:12:39,153
Tell her to leave, Dez.

1039
01:12:39,153 --> 01:12:42,232
Ma'am, if you don't leave right now,
l'm calling the police.

1040
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:46,029
Call them. Call them. And mention you've got
two abducted children in the next room.

1041
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:49,749
Two children who don't appear
in any photographs in this house.

1042
01:12:49,749 --> 01:12:52,195
- Where is Oleg?
- How dare you suggest that we...

1043
01:12:52,195 --> 01:12:53,713
Oh...

1044
01:12:53,713 --> 01:12:55,756
Where's the boy?

1045
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,716
(Screams) Where is he?

1046
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,639
Oh, my God. Oh...

1047
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:16,676
You better pray he's not dead.

1048
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,276
Back off, you sick fuck!

1049
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,476
Jesus. Oh, God, help me.

1050
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,276
Come on, come on, come on.

1051
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,711

1052
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:42,598
You sick, twisted, motherfucking cunt!

1053
01:13:42,598 --> 01:13:44,238
Oh...

1054

- Oh, wake up.
- (Coughs)

1055
01:13:48,352 --> 01:13:51,000
That's right. That's right.
Breathe. You're gonna be OK.

1056
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,674
You can breathe, Oleg. l'm right here.

1057
01:13:53,674 --> 01:13:55,512
l'm right here, just breathe.

1058

1062
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,070
OK. Can you get up?

1063
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:23,029
OK. Go to the bedroom. Get the two kids.
Bring them downstairs. Nicky's there.

1064
01:14:23,029 --> 01:14:26,032
All right? Wait with him. OK? Move over.

1065
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,636
Get out of his way.

All you gotta do is take the boy and walk away.

Hey. Hey, listen, one of your cabs

l did not marry an evil man.

1109

Shady, sleazy,
mixed up with the wrong kind of people.

You're American, not Russian.
Why listen to that shit?

1128
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,032
My mother said l started in her belly in Russia,
so l'm Russian.

1129
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:26,715
You're not a Russian, you're an American,

You know...

..l used to know this kid.

1162
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,308
His old man was a real fucking piece of shit.

1163
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,355
Always drunk.

1164
01:20:08,355 --> 01:20:11,352
Always smacking him and his mom around.

1165
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:19,230
This kid, he takes his licks...
and waits this old fucking prick out.

1166
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,833
On the morning of his 1 4th birthday,

1167
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,758
he walks into his old man 's room
with a baseball bat.

1168
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,958
Then he Mark McGwire's
the fucking living shit out of him.

1169
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,951
After that, the old man,
he can't even hold a spoon without shaking.

1170
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,230
He don't remember things too good either.

1171
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:49,276
He's neutralised.

1172
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,116
Which is a good thing.

1173
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,716
Four more years max.

1174

l'm thinking, probably a couple of blue shirts.

1575
01:49:10,796 --> 01:49:13,599
Must have been Lashon and McCall.

01:49:15,671 --> 01:49:17,910
- You want some of this too?
- For sure, Marishka.

1578
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:19,558
Marishka, you want some of this too?

1579
01:49:19,558 --> 01:49:22,598
l'll take the both of you right now.
How about that?

(Eerie laughter)

01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:38,436
(Evil cackle)

1585
