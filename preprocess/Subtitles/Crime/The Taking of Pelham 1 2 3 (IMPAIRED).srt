00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,621
I didn't wanna call
till everything was ready.

156
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,374
WHlSPERlNG] lt's not Jerry.
I don't know who it is.

157
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,294
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
I understand, I understand,
Pelham 123.

158
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,504
Who the hell is this?

159
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,923
This is the man
who's gonna rock this city.

160
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,968
This is the man
who's gonna give the city
a run for the money.

161
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,137
Look up.
Look up at your screen and
you tell me what you see.

162
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,306
You see what l've done?

163
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,474
I see it.

164
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,686
RYDER:
One car is much more manageable
than 1 0 with the manpower I got.

165
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,647
Mr. Motorman's
gonna tell you all about it.
Tell him what we got here.

166
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,482
They got hostages,
lots of them.

167
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,151
And, uh, they got machine guns.
WHlSPERlNG] That's Jerry.

168
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,153
WHlSPERlNG] Yeah. That's Jerry.
RYDER: Yeah, that's right.

169
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,989
You check me,
do you understand that?

170
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,866
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
I check, I understand.

171
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,829
Didn't l tell you
to knock first?

172
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:18,000
RYDER [OVER SPEAKER]:
Good, because this is what
we call a cash transaction.

173
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,586
Now, you understand
commodities, don't you?

174
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,714
You know, pork bellies?
Gold? Light crude?

175
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,133
Listen.
Listen, no disrespect,

176
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,343
but maybe--
Maybe I'm not the guy
you should be talking to.

177
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,721
Oh, no,
you are exactly the guy
I wanna talk to.

178
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,599
Now, I want you
to look at the ticker
and you tell me

179
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,185
what is the going rate
for a New York City hostage
today?

180
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,065
You think a milIion dollars
is too much? I do.
I think it's corny.

181
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,610
Now get your calculator out.
You got one?

182
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,820
Uh...

183
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,907
RYDRT: Do you haνe a calculator?
Yeah, we got one. I got one.

184
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:56,705
Okay, good. Add this up.
You got $526,31 5 and 79 cents.

185
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:01,084
That's 526,31 5.79.

186
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,545
Now, times that by 1 9.

187
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:04,880
What do you got?

188
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,341
What is he,
a goddamn accountant?

189
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,471
That's 1 0 million?
What do you got?

190
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,890
That comes out to 1 0 million
plus one cent.

191
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,808
Oh. That is a deal.

192
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,269
You call the mayor
and you tell him the price.

193
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:23,398
And then you tell him
l want it in 1 00,000 $1 00 bills,
you got that?

194
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,400
I got it.
What about the one cent?

195
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,277
Oh, you keep that one cent,
that's your broker fee.

196
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,405
Now, I want the rest
in plain suitcases

197
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,700
the kind with the wheels
and the portable handle,
okay?

198
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,953
Now, this is not
a futures contract.
This is a spot trade.

199
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,165
That means there's a time limit on it.
Okay, you got that?

200
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,584
Now, what do you think
is a fair time limit?

201
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,464
You know, I don't know.
I'm really just a guy--

202
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,924
Come on,
give me a time limit.

203
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,592
Give me a
fair time limit.

204
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,513
Thursday.

205
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,307
I was thinking more like an hour.
Now, what's your watch say?

206
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,602
Two-thirteen.

207
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,521
Oh,
that's exactly what
my watch says.

208
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,857
So at 3:1 3,
I want that money here,
motherfucker.

209
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,403
And after that, there is a late fee.

210
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,988
What do you think
that late fee is gonna be?

211
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,119
Come on, tell me what it'll be.

212
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,664
You're gonna kill
the passengers?

213
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,791
Oh, commodities
is what I start to kill.

214
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,794
One for every minute
past the deadline
I am forced to wait.

215
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,671
Now, they become more valuable
this way

216
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,381
and still at the same price.

217
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,300
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
He's underground in the tunnel.
He's never gonna pull this off.

218
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,095
Don't tell me, tell him.
Who the hell is this guy?

219
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,304
I don't know who it is!

220
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,723
MORAN:
Garber, Garber,
just stay with it.

221
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,474
RYDER:
Now, what's your name?
I didn't get your name.

222
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,476
What's your name, my man?
My name?

223
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,687
What's your name?

224
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,189
Tell him?

225
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,984
Garber.
Garber, okay.

226
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,819
Now, seriously, man,
in 59 minutes,

227
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,779
I'm gonna start
killing passengers.

228
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:56,241
So my advice to you
is to get on the phone,
get the mayor notified now.

229
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,118
Listen, l mean...

230
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,329
I'm just a civil-service employee.
I can't get ahold of the mayor.

231
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,914
Well, that's your problem,
man, that's not mine.

232
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,460
It's like, who's responsible
for who lives and who dies
in New York?

233
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,086
That's New York City's problem.

234
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:12,257
Get the fuck off the radio
and notify the mayor,
motherfucker!

235
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,011
Okay.

236
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,063
Nine months of this,
and l'm free.

237
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,732
Next mayor gets inaugurated,

238
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,568
I'm gonna be sitting
in Saint-Tropez on the
beach with a piña colada.

239
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,112
I will never have to ride
the subway ever again.

240
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,282
Never say never, sir.
Never.

241
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,618
All right,
what's next for
the afternoon?

242
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,369
East Harlem Elementary
at 2:30.

243
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,039
You're supposed to read
The Cat ln The Hat
to the third grade.

244
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:47,542
Every time I go to
the schools, l get sick.
They all have runny noses.

245
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,379
Call Dr. Katz, tell him
I want him waiting at the
school, with a fu shot.

246
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,229
Mayor's office.

247
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,069
He's in Car 3.
MAN: Yeah.

248
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:16,947
What happened?

249
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,324
Somebody just hijacked
a 6 train.

250
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,910
It's stopped in the tunnel
between 51 st and 42nd.

251
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,788
Another idiot with a gun.
What do we know?

252
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,582
It's unclear, but l have a car
waiting for us downstairs.

253
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,334
Subway will get us there faster.

254
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,378
All right. Let the doors close.

255
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,089
Tell them we'll meet them
at 59th Street.

256
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,263
Tell the conductor
this is now an express.

257
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,598
We're skipping the next five stops.
What?

258
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,184
MAN: l gotta get to work.
Hold on, hold on.

259
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,437
Everybody will get
where they need to go,
we'll make all the stops.

260
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,107
Maybe he's not such
a douche bag after all,
huh?

261
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,609
Funny.

262
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,282
Figures you'd be the one
to get a call like this.

263
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,952
Hostage negotiation team
is here in five minutes, and
the mayor's been notified.

264
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,288
You gonna tell him?
Get the fuck out of here.

265
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,623
My shift's over in 1 0 minutes.

266
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,542
What are you staring at?
Your face.

267
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,878
I'm trying to remember
for when it's not here
anymore.

268
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,129
You gonna start in
on me now?

269
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,964
Damn right,
I'm gonna start in on you.

270
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,216
Don't fuck this up, Garber.
You wanna do it?

271
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,968
It's your station, it's your call.

272
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,470
Oh, it's my call now?
JOHNSON: That's right. Your call.

273
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,014
Come on.

274
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,148
GARBER [OVER RADlO]:
Pelham 1 23, come in, this is
Rail Control Center. Are you there?

275
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,192
Gerber Baby boy.
What's up?

276
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,739
Garber.
Just wanted to let you know
the mayor's been notified.

277
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,365
Are they gonna pay?

278
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,328
I don't know. l'm just the,
uh, what'd you call me?
The, uh, broker.

279
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,414
No, no. No, you represent
the city of New York right now,
buddy.

280
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,168
Well, l can tell you you're dealing
with one of the all-time
bureaucracies, I know that.

281
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:56,379
I mean, it takes time.
You'd better fix the bureaucracy,

282
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:59,341
because when the time comes,
these motherfuckers,
these hostages

283
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,010
are gonna go real quick.

284
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,264
You got it, you got it.
Any other demands?

285
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,391
Yeah, well,
no fucking pizza for them,
either, man.

286
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,394
No, I mean, are you guys, like,
you know, are you terrorists?

287
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,606
Do I sound like a terrorist?
Do I terrorize you?

288
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:18,068
Actually, you don't, but I mean,
not that I ever talked to one.

289
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,277
So--

290
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,113
So, what,
this is just about money?

291
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,907
Oh, is there anything else?

292
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,367
There's not dying.

293
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,912
Yeah, well, you know, you live,
you die. You either go with
the current or you fight it,

294
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,747
you all end up
in the same place.

295
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,123
Where's that, Jersey?

296
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,250
Yeah, you watch it.
I was born there, man.

297
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,753
I'm just saying,
you're up in the
motorman's cab.

298
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,382
That means you're on the radio,
which means that you're an
easy target.

299
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,509

595

sort of MTA big shot.

596

Today they put me at dispatch,

597
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:11,729
and my bad luck.

598
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,898
Oh. l thought you didn't
believe in bad luck.

599

rigged contracts

who I'm dealing with.

603
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:26,869
You need to know who--?

Yeah, l want to know
who I'm dealing with. I mean,
are you a bad penny?

605
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,833
Let me explain something to you.

606
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,753
Being accused of something
is one thing.

607
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,547
Being guilty of it
is something entirely different.

608
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:42,134
Well, agreed.
But you gotta take me
through this, my man.

609
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:46,055
You got to tell me from the top.
This whole train thing. Come on.

GARBER:
All right,
I started out in maintenance.

611
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,773

track maintenance,
flagman,

612
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,233

RYDER: Conductor, really?

613
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,028
Yeah. And then motorman.

614
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,197
A motorman.
How long did you
do that for?

over six years.

616

I went to tower operations,
assistant dispatcher,
dispatcher.

617
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,662
I finally ended up--

618
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,499
Yeah, you're assistant
chief transportation officer
or something.

619
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,376

620
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,044
That's right.

621
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,632
And part of my job is to go
out to the manufacturers,
you know,

622
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,387
the people who buiId the trains
and bid on contracts for the trains.

623
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,055
Is that where you took the bribe?

624

The Japanese train
over the Canadian train?

625
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:35,396
I did not take a bribe, all right?
I was accused of taking a bribe.

626
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,023
I have not been proven guilty yet.

627

Well, they haven't said yet.
I mean, they haven't decided.

628
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,320
Well, they got no proof.
I don't care what they decide.

629
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,155
It-- What--
They don't need--
It doesn't matter--

630
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,991
And then is this when
they demoted you?

631
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,160
That's correct.
They demoted me,
pending the outcome.

632
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,080
And now they're trying
to humiliate you,
is that right?

But you've gotta be
completely honest
with me, man.
