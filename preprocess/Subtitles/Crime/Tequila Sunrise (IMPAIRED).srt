00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:31,271
Here, look.
Watch!

155
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:33,143
That's terrific.

156
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:39,948
You know, I just...

157
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,866
...think something's going on.

158
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,629
I'm still a detective
even when there's no crime.

159
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:48,433
What do you think's going on?

160
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:50,227
Something
you don't want me to know.

161
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:53,108
JO: How are we treating you
this evening, Mr. McKussic?

162
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:57,828
Fine, thank you.

163
00:11:57,995 --> 00:12:00,350
JO: Can I offer you anything more?
- More?

164
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:03,304
JO: There are two excellent fish
you haven't tried.

165
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:05,665
MAC: Sure.
- What are they?

166
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:09,186
I thought I'd surprise you.

167
00:12:11,435 --> 00:12:14,393
This is my friend, Nick Frescia.

168
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,749
A pleasure, Jo Ann Vallenari.
A plate for you?

169
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:19,907
I've got to be going.

170
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,027
JO: Try us another night.
- What I tried tonight was terrific.

171
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,313
I'm pleased to hear it.

172
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:45,870
She's attractive.

173
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:48,474
Oh, yeah.

174
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:51,754
So, how about it?

175
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,634
How about what?

176
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:57,666
Whatever you're doing...

177
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:00,027
...do it somewhere else,
and don't make me look bad.

178
00:13:00,795 --> 00:13:02,433
There is one last thing.

179
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,434
There's no new business.
It's an accounting problem.

180
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:08,948
The Colombians.
Another discrepancy about money.

181
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:10,992
Sure.
They don't know how to count.

182
00:13:12,715 --> 00:13:14,273
I got your word, Mac?

183
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:16,470
Yeah.

184
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,983
One more thing.

185
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:20,988
How about another bite of that fish?
That's great!

186
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:27,545
ARTURO: I give him two drinks.
JO: That's two too many.

187
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:29,387
If my brother sees Nino like this...

188
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:31,273
What will he do, fire him?

189
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:33,545
He won't fire the chef, Arturo.

190
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:36,064
But one less bartender
is not a problem.

191
00:13:36,555 --> 00:13:38,864
JO: He can't drive that car.
ARTURO: He can have mine.

192
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:41,384
JO: Your Cadillac?
You want to kill him?

193
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:42,351
ARTURO:
I'll drive.

194
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:43,664
I go dance.

195
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:46,792
- No, you're going home.
- Why?

196
00:13:59,595 --> 00:14:01,665
(MAC AND JO OVER RECORDER)

197
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:12,946
Well?

198
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:17,906
In the course of last night...

199
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:20,709
...something came up
which persuaded me...

200
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:24,271
...that Mac dining in that place
is a non-drug related activity.

201
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:26,423
Yeah.

202
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:31,993
He won't get away with what he's
done for 15 years and just retire.

203
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:35,634
What do you suggest?

204
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:37,672
I suggest you make sure
we have a case.

205
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:41,471
After all, what are friends for?

206
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:46,146
(JO OVER RECORDER)
<i>We haven't seen you in a while.</i>

207
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:50,349
MAC: <i>I've been a little busy lately.</i>
<i>And I took a break, you know?</i>

208
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:52,626

<i>Did you go away for Thanksgiving?</i>

209

HAL: What the fuck
is the matter with you?

218
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:21,828
I don't need you
flying in from Washington...

219
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:25,744
...taking over my office,
telling me to manufacture evidence.

220
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:30,507
This is my backyard, Hal! I don't
grow weeds in it so I can pull them.

221
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:47,149
Mac.

222
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:54,874
GREG: I swear to God I wasn't using
you. I was just trying to pay some bills.

223
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:57,270
Now you got another one to pay.

224
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:00,753
And if I don't come through,
these guys'll kill me.

225
00:16:00,955 --> 00:16:03,992
They won't kill you. They'll
probably just break your legs.

226
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:05,747
MAC:
Here comes the money junkie.

227
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:10,312
I've been calling and calling.
I just broke a fucking nail!

228
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:12,665
MAC:
I sent your lawyer the check, Shaleen.

229
00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:15,793
Tomorrow's the first.
You might as well write another one.

230
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:20,954
I'm at a critical point.
This business requires cash.

231
00:16:21,155 --> 00:16:25,148
So do I. Sorry, I'm not starving
so you can tell your little boy...

232
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:27,954
...you're a rubber hose salesman,
not a drug dealer.

233
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:31,832
SHALEEN: Cody gets old enough to ask
what his father does for a living...

234
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:33,553
...suddenly he has a conscience.

235
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:36,667
Greg, I'll deal
with that other stuff later.

236
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:38,427
Leave my kid out of this.

237
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:39,704
Our kid.

238
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:46,549
SHALEEN:
Anyway, I need another 10,000.

239
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:49,270
SHALEEN: The Mercedes burned up.
- The SLC?

240
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,069
It's under warranty.
Take it back, make them fix it.

241
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:56,831
You know those assholes. They claim
I didn't have any oil in the engine.

242
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,354
I made an improper suggestion.

243
00:17:15,555 --> 00:17:17,785
I overreacted.
It was uncalled for.

244
00:17:18,075 --> 00:17:19,952
No.
It was my fault.

245
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:21,824
Well, Okay.

246
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:26,107
HAL: Look, I'll lay my cards
on the table.

247
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:29,073
Any questions about our operation...

248
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:30,983
...go ahead, ask me.
Shoot.

249
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:32,594
Who's your snitch?

250
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:33,984
I can't tell you that.

251
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:39,506
We got to start somewhere, Hal.

252
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:45,668
How about...
July 17, 1963?

253
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:48,426
"Frescia and McKussic were arrested...

254
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:50,825
...for curfew violation
on Hermosa Beach."

255
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:52,223
7 years later you were with Mac...

256
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:55,068
...when he was busted for drugs
on Rosarito Beach.

257
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:57,305
No, he was on the beach.

258
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:58,914
I was in the water.

259
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:02,670
Otherwise I'd have ended up in
the same Mexican jail for 2 years.

260
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,507
What can I say?

261
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:07,224
You have really done your homework.

262
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:09,625
This is not about you being a cop.

263
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:11,713
I know you're one of the best.

264
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:14,224
You're close to Mac.

265
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:17,155
Mac is close to Carlos,
who is coming to town.

266
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:18,544
Who says?

267
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:21,946
He's getting ready to move
1200 kilos of coke...

268
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:23,703
...personally.

269
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,594
That's the word.

270
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,313
For $ 1100 a week...

271
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:32,670
...a local snitch will tell you
anything you want to hear.

272
00:18:33,115 --> 00:18:35,868
I'm hearing it
from the Federal Mexican Police...

273
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:37,514
...and I'm not paying them.

274
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:41,146
You say this is your back yard.

275
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:44,553
Has Carlos ever made a move in it
without Mac's help?

276
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:48,313
If Carlos is back in town,
Mac's back in business.

277
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:50,344
What do you want?

278
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:53,872
- Use Mac to get to Carlos.
NICK: How?

279
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:55,713
Any way you can.

280
00:18:57,315 --> 00:18:59,988
If Mac's clean,
it will do him a lot of damage.

281
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:04,186
Say he is working with Carlos
and we bust him.

282
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:08,824
I will personally guarantee
that Mac...

283
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:11,385
...doesn't stand trial
in federal court.

284
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:15,269
You're liable to save him
15 years of his life.

285
00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:23,993
I cleared out of your office.

286
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:30,347
(MAC IN SPANISH)

287
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:38,794
- It's me, Mac.
CARLOS: <i>Hey, my buddy. Qué pasa?</i>

288
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:40,553
No, you called me, buddy.

290
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:46,427
Not now. They watch me
everywhere I go.

292
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:52,346
CARLOS:

293
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:55,674
I'm telling you,
there's renewed interest in me here.

294
00:19:56,035 --> 00:19:59,186
My cousin used my name
as a guarantee of delivery.

295
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:02,154
CARLOS:

296

CARLOS:

299

MAC: I'm not worried about my cousin.
It's you.

300
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:17,507
Don't come here now.
Not now.

301
00:20:17,755 --> 00:20:20,986
CARLOS:

302
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:25,149

(MAC IN SPANISH)

304
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:55,229
Your chef's visa has expired.

JO:
He has a work permit.

306
00:20:57,435 --> 00:21:01,508
My brother has an immigration lawyer
working to get Nino his green card.

307
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:02,909
Andy Leonard?

308
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:09,184
Have you seen Andy Leonard in
your restaurant with Dale McKussic?

309
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:13,752
Yes, they're both
very good customers.

310
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:15,747
- What's that?
- What's what?

311
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:17,793
A "good customer."

312
00:21:18,795 --> 00:21:20,990
JO:
Someone who is on time.

313
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:25,109
Who doesn't make personal requests
or demands for unusual dishes.

314
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:27,391
HAL: In other words,
you're telling us...

315
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,629
...you've never had to satisfy any
personal requests for Mr. McKussic.

316
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:36,387
No, he usually orders off the menu.
Who are you and what's this about?

317
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:38,388
Agent Maguire.

318
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:40,794
Federal Drug Enforcement.

319
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:44,591
JO: Has Andy Leonard been arrested
on some sort of drug charge?

320
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:45,705
HAL:
We arrested him.

321
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,706
JO:
You think my restaurant is involved?

322
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:49,907
Leonard's in there all the time.

323
00:21:50,115 --> 00:21:53,471
So is the District Attorney.
Does he sell drugs in my restaurant?

324
00:21:53,675 --> 00:21:57,350
HAL: Leonard doesn't have dinner
with the D.A. He does with McKussic.

325
00:21:57,595 --> 00:22:00,155
JO: You think Mr. McKussic
sells drugs there?

326
00:22:00,315 --> 00:22:00,986
SPUDDER:
Maybe.

327
00:22:05,795 --> 00:22:07,513
All I do is see him eat.

328
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:15,946
Miss Vallenari, we know
how important your chef is to you.

329
00:22:17,395 --> 00:22:20,387
We have our problems.
We certainly...

330
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:23,585
...don't have to help
Immigration with theirs.

331
00:22:25,955 --> 00:22:28,515
In other words,
if I'll spy on my customers...

332
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:31,149
...my chef won't be deported
for drunk driving?

333
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:32,993
I didn't say that.

334
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:34,788
JO:
Don't bother to explain.

335
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:38,988
At 8:00, I'll be seating my lawyer
and his ex-partner, a federal judge.

336
00:22:39,195 --> 00:22:41,755
I'm sure they'll explain to me
what you meant.

337
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:44,225
Okay, Hal.

338
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:48,706
Hello, I'm Lieutenant Frescia
from the Sheriff's Department.

339
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,669
We've met...
with Mr. McKussic.

340
00:22:51,915 --> 00:22:53,792
Absolutely.
And when you sue him...

341
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:56,828
...I don't want to be anywhere
in sight. Get me out of here.

342
00:23:03,035 --> 00:23:04,673
(GLASS BREAKS)

343
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:07,833
(NINO IN ITALIAN)

344
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:10,312
Arturo will come for it.

345
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,426
NICK: Take care of it.
JO: Everything okay?

346
00:23:12,715 --> 00:23:15,229
Somebody dropped
last night's evidence...

347
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:16,874
...including Nino's urine specimen.

348
00:23:17,035 --> 00:23:17,945
NINO:
What's that mean?

349
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:20,071
It means
we'll have to drop the case.

350
00:23:20,235 --> 00:23:20,906
No court?

351
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,109
No court.

352
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:29,433
Take it easy, for Chrissake!
I work here.

353
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:32,389
What's on your mind?

354
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:36,711
The way I met you with Mr. McKussic.
You seemed like friends.

355
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:41,354
I'm sorry.
It's really none of my business.

356
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:45,427
You've been terrific.

357
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,586
NICK:
Don't worry about it.

358
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:49,986
Just buy me dinner
one of these days.

359
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,867
Any goddamn day you want.

360
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:54,747
Thank you so much.

361
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:00,750
JO:
Bye.

362
00:24:06,355 --> 00:24:09,313
We got the word your friend
has got a deal cooking.

363
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,389
We're going to nail him.

364
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:15,072
If anybody can do it, you can.

365
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:18,107
Why'd you let her chef go?

366
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:21,153
She's tough, isn't she?

367
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:24,229
- She beat the shit out of you, Hal.
- The hell she did.

368
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:26,346
NICK: The hell she didn't.
Ask anybody.

369
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:28,665
HAL:
What you got going on here?

370
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:08,388
WOMAN:
Hi.

371
00:25:08,835 --> 00:25:10,985
Where've you been?
I've been looking for you.

372
00:25:11,155 --> 00:25:14,033
MAC: In Chula Vista,
selling farm equipment.

373
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:18,430
MAC:
What are the Sin Sisters doing here?

374
00:25:18,675 --> 00:25:20,427
GREG:
Just cranking on the coke.

375
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:24,191
I'm just kidding.
They're just leaving.

376
00:25:24,515 --> 00:25:27,871
What can I do for you?
I'll do anything.

377
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:29,584
GREG:
Name it.

378
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:34,473
Start by cleaning off that table,
and get some new paddles and balls.

379
00:25:34,915 --> 00:25:36,507
Suddenly up for Ping-pong?

380
00:25:36,755 --> 00:25:40,065
And drop something off
at Vallenari's for me.

381
00:25:40,355 --> 00:25:42,073
- Who for?
- Jo Ann Vallenari.

382
00:25:42,355 --> 00:25:45,028
- Aren't you going there tonight?
- I want to clean up first.

383
00:25:45,315 --> 00:25:48,193
Besides, she can look that over
before we talk.

384
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:52,429
- Could you give it a rest?
GREG: Whatever, man. I hear you.

385
00:25:57,795 --> 00:25:58,910
What is it?

386
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:01,949
ARTURO: The cop.
He's waiting for you.

387
00:26:03,635 --> 00:26:04,909
JO:
How nice.

388
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:07,675
Not nice,
he thinks he did you a favor.

389
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:09,348
And cops are the worst barflies.

390
00:26:09,515 --> 00:26:11,471
It's not worth it, I tell you.

391
00:26:11,795 --> 00:26:14,025
You just don't like his looks,
Arturo.

392
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:21,588
It's quite an experience
to watch you work.

393
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:24,791
Like you're in a play,
everything's on cue.

394
00:26:25,435 --> 00:26:27,824
NICK: You're kind of letter-perfect.
- Thank you.

395
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:30,586
Do you ever flub your lines?

396
00:26:31,795 --> 00:26:34,548
Are you politely suggesting
I lack spontaneity?

397
00:26:37,115 --> 00:26:38,150
Have you seen Mac?

398
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:40,385
Mr. McKussic.

399
00:26:40,635 --> 00:26:43,069
NICK: He's going to ask you
to cater a party.

400
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:47,426
That is our business.

401
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:50,754
NICK:
We think it involves his business.

402
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:56,426
Are you suggesting I refuse because
it's a party for drug dealers?

403
00:26:57,235 --> 00:27:01,831
No. But if it's for this one particular
guy, he's particularly unpleasant.

404
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:04,630
JO: You mean violent?
- No, I doubt that.

405
00:27:04,995 --> 00:27:06,747
Unless he doesn't like your lasagne.

406
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,753
I'm sure Mr. McKussic's friend
will be well-behaved.

407
00:27:12,115 --> 00:27:13,753
Why would you call him a friend?

408
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:16,753
A figure of speech.
Who else would you give a party for?

409
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:18,268
A business associate.

410
00:27:18,755 --> 00:27:21,315
As it happens,
Carlos and Mac are friends.

411
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:23,387
And you and Mac are friends.

412
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:24,790
That's right.

413
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:28,503
Sounds like a friendly situation
all around.

414
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:29,909
Not exactly.

415
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:33,505
Nobody knows Carlos. Nobody knows
what he looks like but Mac.

416
00:27:34,115 --> 00:27:38,108
You want me to spy on a customer so
you can find out what he looks like?

417
00:27:38,595 --> 00:27:40,028
Absolutely not!

418
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:44,023
Let's not discuss my business
or his business or your business.

419
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,071
But that leaves nothing
to talk about.

420
00:27:47,555 --> 00:27:48,670
Let's eat.

421
00:27:59,475 --> 00:28:01,352
VALET:
Good evening.

422
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,753

423
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:06,269
MAC:
She can't be.

424
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:12,667
The chef is with them right now
checking out their Caesar salads.

425
00:28:16,635 --> 00:28:19,593
Do you want me to drop off
the envelope anyway?

426
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:23,074
Yeah, I'm beat.
I'll never make it in there.

427
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:25,184
Thanks.

428
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:37,785
GREG: You meet at Orville and Wilbur's
every Christmas.

429
00:28:38,075 --> 00:28:40,225
He throws his Chevrolet keys
on the bar.

430
00:28:40,475 --> 00:28:42,511
You throw your Porsche keys
on the bar.

431
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:46,828
You pick up your drink
with a gold Rolex on your wrist.

432
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:48,792
He wears a Timex.

433
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,989
Even if he wasn't a cop
he'd hate your guts.

434
00:28:52,195 --> 00:28:55,346
(REPORTER OVER TV) <i>Deputies seized</i>

436
00:28:57,355 --> 00:28:59,425
MAC:

437
00:28:59,715 --> 00:29:01,228
What street is that?

438
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:04,194
You show me how to get there
just once.

439
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:08,186
Man, aren't you listening to me?

440
00:29:08,835 --> 00:29:13,431
Nick Frescia came in that restaurant
looking for a way to bust your buns.

441
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:16,912
He's going to have to drag me
out of bed to do it.

442
00:29:17,395 --> 00:29:19,625
I'm under the weather... heavily.

443
00:29:20,835 --> 00:29:22,473
GREG:
Hey, Mac.

444
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:25,705
What I'm telling you
is for your own good.

445
00:29:30,115 --> 00:29:33,187
NICK: That swordfish was great.
JO: Excellent piece.

446
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:35,511
- And the Cristal.
- You know it.

447
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:37,273
We serve it at the Lomita station.

448
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:39,027
What do cops drink?

449
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:42,591
Depends.
I tell my men to avoid vodka.

450
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:44,552
- And stick to Scotch and bourbon.
JO: Why?

451
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:47,309
So the brass will know
they're drunk, not stupid.

452
00:29:48,675 --> 00:29:51,428
- You have an answer for everything.
NICK: So do you.

453
00:29:52,515 --> 00:29:56,224
You answered Maguire's questions
like you were reading off a menu.

454
00:29:56,635 --> 00:29:58,068
ARTURO:
Your keys.

455
00:29:59,315 --> 00:29:59,986
Thank you.

456
00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:02,264
And yours.

457
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:07,274
Want me to lock up?

458
00:30:07,795 --> 00:30:10,229
No, I will.
Make sure the kitchen is closed.

459
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:16,234
Good night, Arturo.

460
00:30:22,795 --> 00:30:24,069
You were saying.

461
00:30:25,315 --> 00:30:28,068
You're still suspicious
of me and Mr. McKussic.

462
00:30:28,715 --> 00:30:30,592
You think
we're in business together.

463
00:30:37,595 --> 00:30:39,426

Especially when they drive
$50,000 cars and always pay in cash.

465
00:30:44,395 --> 00:30:46,147

No.

assumption on your part.

What is it? Do you need
some Chap Stick or lip gloss?

Your lips get stuck on your teeth,
or is that your idea of a smile?

00:43:09,835 --> 00:43:12,144
...and his tip is $2500.

620
00:43:15,515 --> 00:43:17,983
There's $5000 in there?

621
00:43:18,635 --> 00:43:20,785
ARTURO:
Must have been a pretty good party.

622
00:43:22,635 --> 00:43:24,114
Arturo, give me that envelope.

623
00:44:15,595 --> 00:44:16,789
If you want Mac...

624
00:44:17,035 --> 00:44:19,026
...he's down at the competition.

625
00:44:20,475 --> 00:44:21,225
Thanks.

626
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:31,303
Cody!

627
00:44:33,315 --> 00:44:34,873
MAC:
Get away from the pier!

628
00:44:37,915 --> 00:44:40,065
- Holy smoke, it's you!
JO: Yes, it is.

629
00:44:40,355 --> 00:44:43,233
Look, I don't want your money.
I don't want any of it.

630
00:44:43,675 --> 00:44:44,664
How come?

631
00:44:44,835 --> 00:44:46,427
What did you think
you were paying for?

632
00:44:49,235 --> 00:44:50,907
What?
If it's not enough...

633
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,074
No, it's not enough.
Did you think you could buy me?

634
00:44:54,915 --> 00:44:57,110
- Buy you what?
JO: There's $5000 in there!

635
00:44:57,475 --> 00:45:01,912
Lower your voice. Someone will think
something's going down. $5000?

636
00:45:02,235 --> 00:45:04,749
- Right!
MAC: I must have grabbed the hundreds.

637
00:45:04,995 --> 00:45:06,553
You owe me.

638
00:45:07,515 --> 00:45:10,029
What?
This was a mistake?

639
00:45:10,995 --> 00:45:14,192
Wrong envelope.
Shaleen must have the fifties.

640
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:16,667
MAC:
She'll be pissed.

641
00:45:18,595 --> 00:45:22,270
What did you think
I was trying to buy for $5000?

642
00:45:39,555 --> 00:45:43,150
GREG: Man, you all right?
MAC: Yeah, I'm fine. He's hurt.

643
00:45:43,395 --> 00:45:44,430
Could you get everybody out of here?

644
00:45:44,595 --> 00:45:46,233
JO:
I'll get the gate.

645
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:51,873
MAC:
What do you see?

646
00:45:52,235 --> 00:45:53,350
COD Y:
A Kleenex.

647
00:45:54,235 --> 00:45:55,907
Blow your nose on that!

648
00:45:59,275 --> 00:46:00,025
Still hurt?

649
00:46:00,835 --> 00:46:04,145
I feel like shit.
Mom's going to blame this on you.

650
00:46:05,515 --> 00:46:07,745
Cody, watch your language.

651
00:46:08,195 --> 00:46:10,914
JO: How about I send over
some angel hair pasta?

652
00:46:11,595 --> 00:46:12,869
Would you like that?

653
00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:13,831
COD Y:
Okay.

654
00:46:14,115 --> 00:46:15,389
MAC:
Thank you.

655
00:46:16,715 --> 00:46:18,194
Be well, Cody.

656
00:46:25,955 --> 00:46:28,833
I don't know what I'd have done
if you hadn't come along.

657
00:46:29,075 --> 00:46:30,303
Greg had my car.

658
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:33,913
I'm sorry, I don't usually
do things like that.

659
00:46:34,115 --> 00:46:36,834
They make you sign forms
when your kid's neck...

660
00:46:37,075 --> 00:46:38,827
Why don't you sit down?

661
00:46:39,075 --> 00:46:41,305
I'll just have some Herradura.

662
00:46:47,315 --> 00:46:48,907
Your boy lives with you?

663
00:46:51,195 --> 00:46:52,423
MAC: That depends.
- On what?

664
00:46:52,635 --> 00:46:54,227
Money and his mama's mood.

665
00:46:54,435 --> 00:46:56,346
Haven't you had enough?

666
00:46:57,035 --> 00:47:00,664
You want to hear if Cody wakes up
and needs something, don't you?

667
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:06,549
You won't answer me?

668
00:47:06,755 --> 00:47:08,393
I don't think you really want me to.

669
00:47:08,555 --> 00:47:09,908
Yes, I do.

670
00:47:12,715 --> 00:47:16,185
I'll answer any question you ask.
How about that?

671
00:47:17,595 --> 00:47:18,823
Okay.

672
00:47:23,355 --> 00:47:24,834
Bet I know the first one.

673
00:47:25,355 --> 00:47:26,993
What's that?

674
00:47:27,195 --> 00:47:30,392
How can you feel about your boy
the way you do and sell drugs?

675
00:47:30,635 --> 00:47:32,830
Cocaine.
It is cocaine, isn't it?

676
00:47:32,995 --> 00:47:34,553
MAC: It was.
- But not anymore?

677
00:47:34,795 --> 00:47:37,104
You were with Andy Leonard
when he was arrested.

678
00:47:37,795 --> 00:47:39,194
Nick tell you that?

679
00:47:39,475 --> 00:47:40,908
You weren't with him?

680
00:47:42,075 --> 00:47:43,554
I was with him.

681
00:47:43,795 --> 00:47:45,387
And you weren't selling cocaine?

682
00:47:45,635 --> 00:47:46,863
No, I wasn't.

683
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:48,950
He was.

684
00:47:49,235 --> 00:47:50,714
Then what were you doing?

685
00:47:51,075 --> 00:47:54,192
Trying to teach him how to sell it.

686
00:47:56,275 --> 00:47:57,708
You're serious?

687
00:47:57,955 --> 00:48:01,265
That's what it came to.
He's smart enough to be a lawyer...

688
00:48:01,555 --> 00:48:03,273
...but too dumb to be a crook.

689
00:48:03,555 --> 00:48:06,911
- You had to get something.
MAC: He's my lawyer.

690
00:48:10,675 --> 00:48:12,267
He's your lawyer, too.

691
00:48:14,115 --> 00:48:18,552
So he's your lawyer and he's my
lawyer. What does that do for you?

692
00:48:23,235 --> 00:48:26,227
I pretty much knew that you knew...

693
00:48:27,355 --> 00:48:31,189
...what I had done for a living.
I wanted him to let you know...

694
00:48:33,395 --> 00:48:36,114
...that I now had
a legitimate business.

695
00:48:37,475 --> 00:48:39,511
Naturally, I didn't want him busted.

696
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:43,669
So you thought Andy Leonard
would give you respectability?

697
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:46,150
Yes, ma'am.

698
00:48:46,795 --> 00:48:49,150
What do you need it for?

699
00:48:51,915 --> 00:48:52,984
You.

700
00:49:01,715 --> 00:49:04,513
So if I asked you out,
maybe you'd accept.

701
00:49:07,035 --> 00:49:08,946
You don't need a lawyer for that.

702
00:49:09,195 --> 00:49:12,870
Dating is not a criminal activity.
I think your...

703
00:49:13,115 --> 00:49:15,549
...profession has clouded
your judgment here.

704
00:49:19,075 --> 00:49:21,111
I'm flattered and I...

705
00:49:23,475 --> 00:49:24,954
...I believe you.

706
00:49:28,355 --> 00:49:29,674
It was awful dumb.

707
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:45,114
I'm late as hell.

708
00:50:05,395 --> 00:50:07,306
Pour me a glass of champagne.

709
00:50:08,955 --> 00:50:10,752
You'll never believe what happened.

710
00:50:10,955 --> 00:50:12,752
If it's bad news,
I believe it.

711
00:50:12,955 --> 00:50:14,547
I returned McKussic's money.

712
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:16,785
You gave back my tip.
I don't believe it.

713
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:18,508
Good evening, Lieutenant.

714
00:50:21,395 --> 00:50:23,431
- You're early.
- You're late.

715
00:50:23,795 --> 00:50:26,104
- Disappointed?
- Yeah. What kept you?

716
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:29,113
You don't want to know.
We're over here.

717
00:50:30,755 --> 00:50:32,347
No, we're not.

718
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:36,187
- Where do you suggest?
NICK: The wine cellar, where else?

719
00:50:36,955 --> 00:50:40,027
Nick, come on.
Stop kidding around. I mean it.

720
00:50:40,795 --> 00:50:43,184
I have customers all over the place.

721
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:45,754
I'll scream.

722
00:50:45,955 --> 00:50:47,866
CARLOS:
That won't be necessary, señorita.

723
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:51,903
May I present Commandante Xavier
Escalante-Portero y Vega...

724
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,946
...of the Mexican <i>Federales.</i>

725
00:50:54,435 --> 00:50:56,153
CARLOS:
Lt. Frescia has alarmed you.

726
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:59,427
I surprised her with a private party
in the wine cellar.

727
00:50:59,635 --> 00:51:01,626
Because I phoned
and made reservations.

728
00:51:01,755 --> 00:51:04,792
She arrived late
and didn't realize we were here.

729
00:51:05,475 --> 00:51:10,105
You go to a good deal of trouble
to explain an inconsequential event.

730
00:51:11,515 --> 00:51:14,234
Hal.
You remember Jo Ann Vallenari.

731
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:17,266
Yes, of course.
How are you?

732
00:51:17,555 --> 00:51:18,829
Nice to see you.

733
00:51:21,795 --> 00:51:23,831
You were going to
tell me about your day.

734
00:51:24,355 --> 00:51:25,913
Oh, with Mr. McKussic.

735
00:51:26,275 --> 00:51:28,584
You were with Mac?
How come?

736
00:51:28,915 --> 00:51:32,112
- Is this a professional question?
- Purely personal.

737
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,915
Please, the judge
is waiting for you.

738
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:37,433
I'll be right back.

739
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,911
JO: I hope we didn't keep you waiting.
JUDGE: Not at all.

740
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:51,673
Here's a green card for Nino.
I had to pull some strings.

741
00:52:10,075 --> 00:52:11,827
Come on, Escalante's waiting.

742
00:52:12,515 --> 00:52:14,153
He has a token of his friendship.

743
00:52:14,395 --> 00:52:15,589
What?

744
00:52:15,835 --> 00:52:17,063
A gun.

745
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,910
He's Mexican.
What can I tell you?

746
00:52:21,435 --> 00:52:24,825
You wanted someone to I.D. Carlos.
I've got him for you.

747
00:52:25,795 --> 00:52:27,865
I've worked with him for 8 years.

748
00:52:28,115 --> 00:52:30,026
He doesn't get involved
in an operation...

749
00:52:30,235 --> 00:52:31,987
...unless he can bring it off.

750
00:52:32,155 --> 00:52:33,304
Don't mess with him.

751
00:52:34,275 --> 00:52:35,993
You can mess with her anytime.

752
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:42,192
ANDY: Think it was an accident
Nino was arrested for drunk driving?

753
00:52:42,555 --> 00:52:45,228
Frescia had the police
waiting for him every night.

754
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:46,550
Why?

755
00:52:46,915 --> 00:52:50,464
He figured you knew more about Mac,
and used Nino to find out.

756
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:53,787
How's the judge involved?

757
00:52:53,955 --> 00:52:57,391
He's the Federal judge Frescia
went to for the deportation order.

758
00:52:57,835 --> 00:53:01,510
I told the judge he was about
to deport his fettucini verde...

759
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:05,065
...his ossobuco
and his rigatoni quattro formaggi.

760
00:53:07,515 --> 00:53:10,268
CARLOS: Informants assure us
Carlos will contact McKussic...

761
00:53:10,435 --> 00:53:12,426
...before he does business
elsewhere.

762
00:53:13,355 --> 00:53:15,550
HAL: Would he risk
going to McKussic's house?

763
00:53:16,035 --> 00:53:20,187
CARLOS: He hardly expects me to be
there to identify him, Mr. Maguire.

764
00:53:20,395 --> 00:53:24,024
After all, beaches are a crowded,
friendly place, aren't they?

765
00:53:24,355 --> 00:53:28,030
People don't wear much
in the way of clothing.

766
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:32,905
Guns and surveillance equipment are
that much more difficult to hide.

767
00:53:34,275 --> 00:53:37,187
Mr. McKussic
thinks about such things.

768
00:53:37,795 --> 00:53:39,114
Which brings me to the point.

769
00:53:40,035 --> 00:53:43,630
A group of Mexicans patrolling
the strand will look conspicuous.

770
00:53:43,795 --> 00:53:47,470
I suggest your people
patrol the beach...

771
00:53:47,675 --> 00:53:51,714
...and keep a wide perimeter with
some frozen surveillance for us.

772
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:53,470
Where'll you be?

773
00:53:53,635 --> 00:53:56,229
There's a lot on the highlands
above his home.

774
00:53:56,395 --> 00:54:00,024
But I'm told Mr. McKussic
has a boat stored there.

775

Excuse me.

782
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:27,186

- He owed me an explanation.

786
00:54:36,355 --> 00:54:38,664
Yeah.

787

I'm not sure.

788
00:54:42,555 --> 00:54:45,388
It seems he has been engaged
in his business...

789
00:54:45,555 --> 00:54:47,147
...for purely romantic reasons.

790
00:54:47,315 --> 00:54:51,354
While you have been engaged in
romance for purely business reasons.

791
00:54:51,715 --> 00:54:53,626
I'm not sure I understand that.

792
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:55,547
A little vague for you?

793
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:56,625
A little.

794
00:54:56,955 --> 00:55:01,312

fuck your friend? Fuck him, not me!

795

800

801

How do you know her name?

805
00:55:35,075 --> 00:55:37,430
She promised to make me
angel hair spaghetti.

806
00:55:38,195 --> 00:55:42,029
I wouldn't count on that now.
She's a very busy girl.

807
00:55:42,595 --> 00:55:43,948
Doesn't she like you, Dad?

808
00:55:44,155 --> 00:55:46,828
We never really got around to that.

809

Why doesn't she like you, Dad?

810
00:55:51,475 --> 00:55:53,067
I didn't say she didn't like me.

811
00:55:53,275 --> 00:55:56,347
I don't know what she likes
or if she likes a damn thing.

812
00:55:56,595 --> 00:55:58,790

GREG:
What are you doing?

816
00:56:10,635 --> 00:56:12,785
I got a ticket.
Noise abatement ordinance.

817
00:56:13,035 --> 00:56:15,310
Not allowed to do
any work on machinery.

818
00:56:16,235 --> 00:56:17,588
Haven't worked on it lately.

819
00:56:18,315 --> 00:56:20,875
Anyway, I better move it
or they will.

820
00:56:23,115 --> 00:56:25,675
I ran into Rudi Samudio's customers.

821
00:56:25,995 --> 00:56:27,747
They're desperate for product.

822
00:56:28,195 --> 00:56:30,470
Not as desperate as Rudi.
He's doing 100 years.

823
00:56:31,075 --> 00:56:33,191
They'll go up to
half a million in advance.

824

I couldn't help you if I wanted to,
and I don't want to.

826
00:56:43,035 --> 00:56:47,187
...even if it's bad shit.
I mean, half a million bucks!

827

We agreed you weren't going to hit
me with this kind of stuff anymore.

MAC:

831
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:15,308
MAC: I got to stick this thing
in the water. See if it floats.

832
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:41,069
- What can I do for you?
- I'm okay.

833
00:57:41,355 --> 00:57:42,868
You don't have to be here yet.

JO:
It's okay.

838
00:58:14,235 --> 00:58:15,793
I didn't know you...

839
00:58:16,595 --> 00:58:21,111
...or your relationship with Mac.
I only knew he was hiding something.

840
00:58:22,355 --> 00:58:24,346
It turned out to be his feelings.

841
00:58:26,715 --> 00:58:28,273
But you're so smooth...

842
00:58:29,035 --> 00:58:31,913
...I figured you were
hiding something too.

843
00:58:32,315 --> 00:58:33,873
JO:
How could you tell?

844
00:58:35,435 --> 00:58:38,108
You lie to me about Mac.
You lie to Mac about me.

845
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:40,351
You lie to the judge
about everybody.

846
00:58:40,595 --> 00:58:43,632
Eventually, you have to lose sight
of the facts, don't you?

847
00:58:44,275 --> 00:58:45,264
NICK:
No.

848
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:48,786
You don't lose sight of the facts,
not unless you're nuts.

849
00:58:53,075 --> 00:58:55,145
You lose sight of your feelings.

850
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:58,024
Mac knows his feelings.

851
00:58:58,195 --> 00:59:00,789
He's crazy for you
and doesn't want to get caught.

852
00:59:01,195 --> 00:59:05,632
For a crook, it's crystal clear.
But for a cop, it's confusing.

853
00:59:07,355 --> 00:59:08,834
Mac's my friend.
I like him.

854
00:59:08,995 --> 00:59:11,589
Maguire's my associate
and I hate him.

855
00:59:12,955 --> 00:59:17,471
I probably have to bust my friend
to do my job and I hate that.

856
00:59:17,675 --> 00:59:21,827
But I hate drug dealers and
somebody's got to get rid of Carlos.

857
00:59:22,715 --> 00:59:24,194
How do I do that?

858
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:28,951
With my powers of deduction,
I walk into your restaurant...

859
00:59:29,195 --> 00:59:30,628
...Iook at you and realize...

860
00:59:31,035 --> 00:59:34,630
...regardless of the food,
Mac's not here to eat. He's in love.

861
00:59:36,955 --> 00:59:40,994
And I wonder if you're not as good
about concealing your feelings...

862
00:59:41,275 --> 00:59:43,391
...as you are at
taking care of your customers.

863
00:59:43,675 --> 00:59:48,146
You're not in the drug business,
but you may have helpful knowledge.

864
00:59:49,595 --> 00:59:51,187
So I checked you out.

865
00:59:55,755 --> 00:59:59,828
You've had, near as I can tell,
3 affairs in the last seven years.

866
01:00:00,955 --> 01:00:04,265
With a lifeguard who was more
a high school buddy...

867
01:00:04,955 --> 01:00:07,469
...a painter who did frescoes
for your restaurant...

868
01:00:07,675 --> 01:00:11,429
...and a married man with whom
you broke off almost immediately.

869
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:15,190
So you're not exactly
wild and crazy in this area.

870
01:00:15,515 --> 01:00:19,872
I figured if you got involved with
me, you're not involved with Mac.

871
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:24,945
But his interest in you makes you
likely to find out what's going on.

872
01:00:25,675 --> 01:00:29,224
What I didn't figure
is that you're not like me.

873
01:00:30,555 --> 01:00:33,433
You're honest and kind
and principled.

874
01:00:35,675 --> 01:00:37,108
And I trust you.

875
01:00:40,755 --> 01:00:42,074
Suddenly, I'm...

876
01:00:44,395 --> 01:00:45,908
...ashamed.

877
01:00:50,555 --> 01:00:54,594
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen and I'm nuts about you.

878
01:00:57,835 --> 01:00:59,427
I've only got one question.

879
01:00:59,675 --> 01:01:02,747
I don't want to know
what you know about Mac.

880
01:01:06,155 --> 01:01:08,305
Man, I just want to see you tonight.

881
01:01:13,235 --> 01:01:14,270
Will you?

882
01:01:16,955 --> 01:01:18,183
See me?

883
01:01:26,235 --> 01:01:28,749

you'd be left alone unsupervised.

I don't believe you.

I'll see what I can do.

Okay.

- Of what?

...you were busted by the D.E.A.
Four months ago.

to Mac, did you? I didn't think so.

What a shame.

1087

People in trouble need to talk to
somebody. If not to their friends...

Carlos was real upset because...

1104

go to that trouble for half...

Half a million? Probably not, but

His boat?

1114

He sailed up here from Ensenada.

1115
01:23:48,155 --> 01:23:51,033
Said he wanted to go fishing
for albacore on the way home.

She enjoys it.

She goes from one customer

I'm sure the girl has friends
of her own.

01:33:38,875 --> 01:33:40,194
Any luck, Woody?

1233
01:33:40,755 --> 01:33:42,154
WOOD Y:
Yeah, see you.

1234
01:33:46,075 --> 01:33:48,464
WOOD Y:
I got to go post warning signs.

1235
01:33:49,515 --> 01:33:51,267
WOOD Y: Can you give me a hand?
- Yeah, sure.

1236
01:33:52,275 --> 01:33:54,505
It will make messy headlines.

1237
01:33:54,835 --> 01:33:57,508
NICK:
At least the CIA does it on purpose.

1238
01:34:01,955 --> 01:34:03,468
When will I see you?

1239
01:34:04,515 --> 01:34:05,709
MAC:
How about dinner?

1240
01:34:06,675 --> 01:34:08,825
What time do you want
your reservation?

1241
01:34:09,315 --> 01:34:10,668
7:30?

1242
01:34:11,035 --> 01:34:12,593
I'll put it down.

1243
01:34:15,315 --> 01:34:16,907
Anything else I can do?

1244
01:34:20,115 --> 01:34:21,309
Marry me.

1245
01:34:22,675 --> 01:34:23,869
Let's go.

1246
01:34:24,195 --> 01:34:25,423
Let's do it now.

1247
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:36,514
MAC: Hey, Woody.
Nick, thanks for showing up.

1248
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:39,747
- How did you two get here?
MAC: Boat. Could you excuse us?

1249
01:34:41,555 --> 01:34:43,830
MAC: Did Woody have
any trouble getting ahold of you?

1250
01:34:44,155 --> 01:34:45,747
NICK:
None at all.

1251
01:34:46,235 --> 01:34:49,113
MAC: I need you
to look after her for a while.

1252
01:34:49,275 --> 01:34:51,550
NICK:
Tell me where Carlos is...

1253
01:34:51,715 --> 01:34:54,513
...or you're an accessory
to your cousin's murder.

1254
01:34:55,155 --> 01:34:56,827
Mac, you're under arrest.

1255
01:34:56,955 --> 01:34:59,071
I hate to pull a gun on you
but that's how it is.

1256
01:34:59,915 --> 01:35:03,794
At this point, that's nothing new.
Here's another gun you pulled.

1257
01:35:09,155 --> 01:35:10,554
I don't believe you'll use that.

1258
01:35:10,755 --> 01:35:12,632
I know how you feel.

1259
01:35:13,715 --> 01:35:16,832
I don't get it.
I mean, you're not this stupid.

1260
01:35:17,075 --> 01:35:20,067
I caught you.
You can't pretend you're not caught.

1261
01:35:20,315 --> 01:35:23,512
You can't spend the rest of
your life hiding in Mexico, either.

1262
01:35:23,755 --> 01:35:25,825
You got one chance.
Turn yourself in.

1263
01:35:25,995 --> 01:35:26,711
What for?

1264
01:35:27,515 --> 01:35:29,267
- What for?
MAC: Yeah, what for?

1265
01:35:30,235 --> 01:35:33,113
I told you I had an accounting
problem in the restaurant.

1266
01:35:33,355 --> 01:35:37,109
I've been keeping money for someone
and he's here to pick it up.

1267
01:35:37,435 --> 01:35:39,995
I want to get this.
You'd kill me over drug money?

1268
01:35:41,995 --> 01:35:43,553
It's a lot of money.

1269
01:35:48,995 --> 01:35:50,633
What's it going to be?

1270
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:53,786
I can't believe this.

1271
01:35:55,475 --> 01:35:58,945
I can't believe what you've done
with your fucking life!

1272
01:35:59,235 --> 01:36:02,750
I can't believe you either, thinking
you can do anything, like Carlos.

1273
01:36:02,955 --> 01:36:05,469
You try to fuck her,
he tries to kill her.

1274
01:36:07,675 --> 01:36:10,747
Woody's the only one of us worth
anything. He's got a decent job.

1275
01:36:11,795 --> 01:36:14,309
I'll be back in an hour
and you can lock me up.

1276
01:36:19,075 --> 01:36:20,303
You lied to me.

1277
01:36:22,235 --> 01:36:24,226
You wouldn't shoot me over money.

1278
01:36:41,875 --> 01:36:44,264
You've got to tell me
where Mac's gone.

1279
01:36:44,475 --> 01:36:45,794
JO:
Why should I?

1280
01:36:46,995 --> 01:36:48,508
He'll try to kill Carlos...

1281
01:36:48,835 --> 01:36:51,030
...because Carlos
is trying to kill you.

1282
01:37:06,555 --> 01:37:09,627
MAC: Ensenada, this is Little Red.
I'm approaching Pier 17.

1283
01:37:09,955 --> 01:37:12,992
Ensenada, this is Little Red
approaching Pier 17. Over.

1284
01:37:15,195 --> 01:37:16,833
(IN SPANISH OVER RADIO)

1285
01:37:26,075 --> 01:37:27,428
(IN SPANISH)

1286
01:38:36,195 --> 01:38:39,870
CARLOS: You son of a bitch!
How could you do this?!

1287
01:38:40,435 --> 01:38:45,065
Friendship is the only choice
in life you can make that's yours!

1288
01:38:45,435 --> 01:38:50,065
You can't choose your family!
Goddamn it, I've had to face that!

1289
01:38:50,915 --> 01:38:54,351
No man should be judged for
whatever direction his dick goes!

1290
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:59,225
That's like blaming a compass
for pointing north, for Chrissake!

1291
01:39:00,035 --> 01:39:02,265
Friendship is all we have.

1292
01:39:04,115 --> 01:39:06,185
We chose each other.

1293
01:39:06,995 --> 01:39:08,906
How could you fuck it up?

1294
01:39:09,715 --> 01:39:12,229
How could you make us look so bad?

1295
01:39:12,915 --> 01:39:14,507
Welcome aboard.

1296
01:39:14,835 --> 01:39:16,427
Here.
Careful, it's loaded.

1297
01:39:16,755 --> 01:39:19,633
Keep it. You're going to spend
the rest of your life in jail.

1298
01:39:19,875 --> 01:39:23,390
I won't be there to take care
of you. I'll be in a Mexican jail.

1299
01:39:23,635 --> 01:39:26,991
- She's never going to testify.
CARLOS: How can you say that? Damn you!

1300
01:39:27,315 --> 01:39:29,545
She can't testify
against her husband...

1301
01:39:29,715 --> 01:39:31,353
...so she can't testify against you.

1302
01:39:31,515 --> 01:39:32,914
She said she'd marry you?

1303
01:39:33,155 --> 01:39:34,827
MAC: Yeah.
CARLOS: Oh no!

1304
01:39:37,395 --> 01:39:40,785
Under the circumstances,
she would have said anything!

1305
01:39:41,035 --> 01:39:43,230
She would have fucked a snake!

1306
01:39:44,315 --> 01:39:46,385
Come on, be serious!

1307
01:39:46,715 --> 01:39:48,148
I am serious.

1308
01:39:59,035 --> 01:40:02,869
Don't you even want to...
check below?

1309
01:40:03,835 --> 01:40:06,190
When it comes to money I trust you.

1310
01:40:06,995 --> 01:40:08,906
So, how are we going to do this?

1311
01:40:11,355 --> 01:40:13,391
I don't feel
like unloading $ 15 million.

1312
01:40:13,555 --> 01:40:14,874
Why don't we swap boats?

1313
01:40:15,035 --> 01:40:18,072
That is not exactly fair.
This is a real nice boat.

1314
01:40:18,875 --> 01:40:20,308
The hell with it.

1315
01:40:20,595 --> 01:40:22,347
So this is it?

1316
01:40:23,995 --> 01:40:25,747
I hope she's worth it.

1317
01:40:25,995 --> 01:40:29,146
And I hope she keeps her mouth shut.
That's all I can say.

1318
01:40:36,275 --> 01:40:37,151
CARLOS:
Go!

1319
01:40:40,635 --> 01:40:42,387
No, don't.
Hold it.

1320
01:40:44,475 --> 01:40:47,194
I got that thing rigged
to blow sky high.

1321
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:52,505
I'm sorry. I hated having to
do that, but I didn't want her hurt.

1322
01:40:54,595 --> 01:40:56,506
You mind undoing it?

1323
01:41:00,635 --> 01:41:01,909
Look at it this way.

1324
01:41:02,075 --> 01:41:04,111
MAC: If you had tried anything,
we both would have gone.

1325
01:41:04,315 --> 01:41:06,033
You love her that much?

1326
01:41:09,835 --> 01:41:10,790
Yeah.

1327
01:41:24,555 --> 01:41:27,592
CARLOS: When I first heard that,
I thought you rigged the butane stove.

1328
01:41:27,755 --> 01:41:30,144
MAC:
I thought of the butane stove.

1329
01:41:30,515 --> 01:41:32,790
But that's a little too hard
to control.

1330
01:41:33,115 --> 01:41:35,310
The ignition system is best.

1331
01:41:37,595 --> 01:41:38,471
You knew?

1332
01:41:38,675 --> 01:41:39,949
I know you.

1333
01:42:18,755 --> 01:42:23,067
CARLOS: Jesus Christ, look at that!
You shot me.

1334
01:42:23,355 --> 01:42:24,993
MAC: So what?
You shot me.

1335
01:42:25,195 --> 01:42:26,708
Look at my stomach!

1336
01:42:26,915 --> 01:42:28,667
You went too far, damn it!

1337
01:42:28,955 --> 01:42:32,630
And because you're my friend, that
means you can kill anyone you want?

1338
01:42:32,915 --> 01:42:36,146
Will you stop talking?
It's making me sick.

1339
01:42:36,995 --> 01:42:38,553
That looks bad, don't it?

1340
01:42:38,795 --> 01:42:41,070
That's what I've been telling you.

1341
01:42:43,515 --> 01:42:46,632
MAC: Now I got to get you a doctor.
- Don't move.

1342
01:42:47,275 --> 01:42:48,594
Wait a minute.

1343
01:42:49,355 --> 01:42:50,993
I feel seasick.

1344
01:42:52,515 --> 01:42:55,234
I think it's time
for both of us to quit.

1345
01:42:56,315 --> 01:42:57,191
I know.

1346
01:42:59,395 --> 01:43:03,547
I've seen it coming for some time.
Cocaine is no damn good for anybody.

1347
01:43:06,115 --> 01:43:07,514
The future...

1348
01:43:08,195 --> 01:43:11,346
The future is grass.
Grass, buddy!

1349
01:43:13,475 --> 01:43:16,512
I have 60 tons of Thai stick
coming in.

1350
01:43:17,035 --> 01:43:18,593
It's on the way.

1351
01:43:24,395 --> 01:43:26,306
Don't do this, goddamn it!

1352
01:43:30,075 --> 01:43:31,303
Oh, fuck.
