THAT'S EASIER SAID
THAN DONE.

1122
01:06:15,565 --> 01:06:17,567
BUT WHY, DADDY? WHY?

1123
01:06:17,567 --> 01:06:19,069
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU.

1124
01:06:19,069 --> 01:06:21,071
WHAT NONE OF US
HAVE NOTICED,

1125
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:23,073
WHILE WE'VE BEEN
SITTING HERE,

1126
01:06:23,073 --> 01:06:25,575
THE TIDE
HAS BEEN COMING IN.

1127
01:06:25,575 --> 01:06:27,143
WE'RE COMPLETELY CUT OFF.

1128
01:06:27,143 --> 01:06:29,379
OH! 
OH! OH!

1129
01:06:29,379 --> 01:06:32,032
WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?

1130
01:06:32,032 --> 01:06:33,350
HURRY, MR. POTTS!

1131
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:35,018
EVERYONE
STAY CALM!

1132
01:06:35,018 --> 01:06:36,503
QUICKLY, DADDY. 
QUICKLY.

1133
01:06:36,503 --> 01:06:38,004
AH, LOOK!

1134
01:06:38,004 --> 01:06:41,007
THEY ARE COMPLETELY
CUT OFF BY THE TIDE.

1135
01:06:41,007 --> 01:06:43,009
THEY WILL ALL DROWN!

1136
01:06:43,009 --> 01:06:46,513
I HAVEN'T SEEN
A GOOD DROWNING IN YEARS!

1137
01:06:46,513 --> 01:06:48,648
HO HO HO!
HA HA HA!

1138
01:06:48,982 --> 01:06:50,667
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

1139
01:06:50,884 --> 01:06:52,252
PUSH THE THROTTLE!

1140
01:06:52,252 --> 01:06:53,687
HURRY, DADDY! HURRY!

1141
01:06:53,937 --> 01:06:55,872
QUICKLY!
BEFORE THEY GET HERE!

1142
01:06:55,872 --> 01:06:57,173
THE OTHER ONE!

1143
01:06:57,173 --> 01:06:59,209
IT WON'T START!

1144
01:06:59,209 --> 01:07:02,295
WE WILL
HAVE TO SWIM FOR IT.

1145
01:07:02,295 --> 01:07:03,797
COME ON, JEMIMA.

1146
01:07:03,797 --> 01:07:05,298
COME ON. COME ON.

1147
01:07:05,799 --> 01:07:06,800
OVER THE SIDE.

1148
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,301
[BANG]

1149
01:07:08,802 --> 01:07:10,487
IT'S STARTING!

1150
01:07:10,487 --> 01:07:12,372
EVERYBODY HOLD ON!

1151
01:07:12,372 --> 01:07:13,857
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE!

1152
01:07:15,859 --> 01:07:17,360
OH, THIS IS
POSITIVELY CLEVER!

1153
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:19,362
WHEE!
WHEE!

1154
01:07:19,362 --> 01:07:20,847
THIS IS
IMPOSSIBLE!

1155
01:07:20,847 --> 01:07:22,332
YOU BUILT IT!

1156
01:07:22,332 --> 01:07:24,551
YOU ALWAYS SAID
IT WAS MAGIC.

1157
01:07:24,801 --> 01:07:26,269
I DID?

1158
01:07:26,269 --> 01:07:27,671
LIKE A BOAT!

1159
01:07:27,671 --> 01:07:29,406

A FLOATING CAR?

1163
01:07:36,713 --> 01:07:39,215
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT?

1164
01:07:39,215 --> 01:07:40,717
A CAR FLOATING,

1165
01:07:40,717 --> 01:07:42,569
FLOATING ON
THE WATER FOAM.

1166
01:07:48,675 --> 01:07:50,176
THIS IN
MY WHOLE LIFE,

1167
01:07:50,176 --> 01:07:52,729

HA HA HA!

1171
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:00,103
A FUEL-BURNING ORACLE.

1172
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:06,643
HA HA HA!

1173

01:10:39,979 --> 01:10:42,982
I WILL CUT OFF
YOUR HEADS.

1213

02:16:57,797 --> 02:16:59,782
KEEP CLEAR.

2246
02:17:07,707 --> 02:17:10,310
BYE!
BYE!

2247
02:17:12,211 --> 02:17:14,213
AND SO, AFTER THAT,

2248
02:17:14,213 --> 02:17:16,215
VULGARIA BECAME
A FREE COUNTRY,

2249
02:17:16,215 --> 02:17:18,217
AND ALL THE CHILDREN

2250
02:17:18,217 --> 02:17:20,720
LAUGHED AND PLAYED
IN THE SUNSHINE,

2251
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:22,221
AND THEY WERE
VERY, VERY HAPPY.

2252
02:17:22,555 --> 02:17:25,224
AND CHITTY FLEW HIGH
OVER THE MOUNTAINS

2253
02:17:25,224 --> 02:17:28,227
BACK TO ENGLAND,
EVERYBODY SAFE AND SOUND.

2254
02:17:28,227 --> 02:17:30,730
AND DADDY AND TRULY
WERE MARRIED.

2255
02:17:30,730 --> 02:17:32,732
AND LIVED HAPPILY
EVER AFTER.

2256
02:17:32,732 --> 02:17:33,733
YES.

2257
02:17:34,233 --> 02:17:36,669
IS THAT HOW
THE STORY ENDS?

2258
02:17:38,671 --> 02:17:42,141
IT'S GETTING LATE.
WE BETTER GET BACK.

2259
02:18:11,154 --> 02:18:11,654
WELL.

2260
02:18:12,155 --> 02:18:13,656
GOODBYE, JEREMY.

2261
02:18:13,806 --> 02:18:15,158
GOODBYE, JEMIMA.

2262
02:18:15,158 --> 02:18:17,160
WILL WE SEE YOU
AGAIN?

2263
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:19,662
OH, I EXPECT SO.
GOODBYE.

2264
02:18:19,662 --> 02:18:20,663
GOODBYE.

2265
02:18:23,166 --> 02:18:24,667
TRULY.

2266
02:18:27,170 --> 02:18:30,173
I HOPE THE CHILDREN
DIDN'T EMBARRASS YOU

2267
02:18:30,173 --> 02:18:33,676
BY THAT SILLY JOKE
ABOUT US GETTING MARRIED.

2268
02:18:33,676 --> 02:18:35,678
YOU KNOW HOW KIDS ARE.

2269
02:18:35,678 --> 02:18:37,680
I DON'T THINK
THEY REALIZE

2270
02:18:37,680 --> 02:18:39,682
HOW RIDICULOUS
THAT WOULD BE.

2271
02:18:39,682 --> 02:18:40,683
RIDICULOUS?

2272
02:18:40,683 --> 02:18:43,186
YOU LIVE
IN THAT BIG HOUSE,

2273
02:18:43,186 --> 02:18:45,688
YOUR FATHER,
THE FACTORY AND ALL.

2274
02:18:45,688 --> 02:18:47,690
IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD,
TRULY.

2275
02:18:47,690 --> 02:18:49,692
IF I SAID THAT,

2276
02:18:49,692 --> 02:18:51,694
YOU'D CALL ME
A SNOB.

2277
02:18:51,694 --> 02:18:53,696
I DIDN'T MEAN--

2278
02:18:53,696 --> 02:18:54,697
GOODBYE.

2279
02:18:59,669 --> 02:19:02,672
DON'T YOU WANT
TO RIDE UP FRONT?

2280
02:19:11,664 --> 02:19:14,667
THAT WAS
A FINE PICNIC,
WASN'T IT?

2281
02:19:19,172 --> 02:19:21,674
SHALL WE HAVE
ANOTHER ONE TOMORROW?

2282
02:19:21,674 --> 02:19:23,176
WITH TRULY?

2283
02:19:23,176 --> 02:19:25,178
WELL, MISS SCRUMPTIOUS

2284
02:19:25,178 --> 02:19:27,680
HAS A LOT
OF SOCIAL ENGAGEMENTS.

2285
02:19:29,182 --> 02:19:33,186
ARE WE EVER GOING TO
SEE TRULY AGAIN, DADDY?

2286
02:19:34,687 --> 02:19:36,689
WELL, WE'LL SEE.

2287
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:45,681
LOOK, THAT'S
LORD SCRUMPTIOUS' CAR.

2288
02:19:45,681 --> 02:19:47,683
I BELIEVE IT IS.

2289
02:19:47,683 --> 02:19:49,685
WHAT'S IT
DOING HERE?

2290
02:19:49,685 --> 02:19:51,687
I DON'T KNOW.

2291
02:19:51,687 --> 02:19:53,189
EXCUSE ME.

2292
02:19:53,189 --> 02:19:54,690
GOOD AFTERNOON.

2293
02:19:54,690 --> 02:19:56,192
ARE YOU--

2294
02:19:56,192 --> 02:19:57,693
[SHOUTING]

2295
02:20:02,148 --> 02:20:05,350
BOOM! THAT'S WIPED OUT
YOUR DASHED CAVALRY.

2296
02:20:05,350 --> 02:20:08,854
I HAVE MY SECOND
INFANTRY BATTALION

2297
02:20:08,854 --> 02:20:10,856
ATTACKING HERE
FROM THE REAR.

2298
02:20:10,856 --> 02:20:13,859
ATTACKING FROM THE REAR?
THAT'S DASHED UNETHICAL.

2299
02:20:13,859 --> 02:20:15,861
ARTILLERY,
PREPARE TO OPEN FIRE.

2300
02:20:15,861 --> 02:20:16,862
FIRE!

2301
02:20:17,129 --> 02:20:19,364
NUMBER ONE BATTALION,
PREPARE TO ADVANCE!

2302
02:20:19,364 --> 02:20:21,133
WHAT'S GOING ON?

2303
02:20:21,133 --> 02:20:23,351
AH, THERE YOU ARE,
YOUNG POTTS.

2304
02:20:23,351 --> 02:20:25,353
BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

2305
02:20:25,353 --> 02:20:27,355
AHA! WIPED OUT
YOUR ARTILLERY!

2306
02:20:27,355 --> 02:20:29,357
YOU'RE A CAD,
POTTS.

2307
02:20:29,357 --> 02:20:31,359
WHAT'S GOING ON?

2308
02:20:31,359 --> 02:20:33,862
FANCY YOU BEING
OLD BUNGIE'S SON--

2309
02:20:33,862 --> 02:20:36,865
BUNGIE POTTS, BEST
BATMAN I EVER HAD.

2310
02:20:36,865 --> 02:20:38,366
YOU WERE--

2311
02:20:38,366 --> 02:20:40,869
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE
MY BRIGADIER.

2312
02:20:40,869 --> 02:20:43,338
HOW ABOUT
SOME MORE TEA?

2313
02:20:43,688 --> 02:20:45,307
YES, SIR.
RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

2314
02:20:45,307 --> 02:20:48,810
YOUNG MAN,
THERE'S A CHANCE
YOU'LL BE RICH.

2315
02:20:48,810 --> 02:20:50,295
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

2316
02:20:50,295 --> 02:20:52,764
THOSE CONFOUNDED
SWEETS OF YOURS.

2317
02:20:52,764 --> 02:20:55,267
USELESS FOR HUMANS, 
WONDERFUL FOR DOGS.

2318
02:20:55,267 --> 02:20:57,269
WOOF SWEETS
WE'LL CALL THEM.

2319
02:20:57,269 --> 02:20:59,271
CANINE CANDIES. 
DOGS LOVE THEM.

2320
02:20:59,271 --> 02:21:01,273
MAKE A FORTUNE.

2321
02:21:01,273 --> 02:21:03,275
YOU'VE DONE IT,
DADDY.

2322
02:21:03,275 --> 02:21:07,279
IT'S THE POSH LIFE
FOR US NOW, MY BOY.

2323
02:21:07,279 --> 02:21:08,780
WE'LL BE RICH!

2324
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:09,781
HOORAY!

2325
02:21:09,781 --> 02:21:12,284
I INVENTED SOMETHING
THAT ACTUALLY WORKS?

2326
02:21:12,284 --> 02:21:15,287
I'VE GOT A CONTRACT.
SIGN HERE, PLEASE.

2327
02:21:16,788 --> 02:21:19,291
WAIT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

2328
02:21:19,291 --> 02:21:21,243
WHAT ABOUT
THE CONTRACT?

2329
02:21:21,343 --> 02:21:23,261
DADDY,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

2330
02:21:23,261 --> 02:21:24,379
DADDY!

2331
02:21:28,733 --> 02:21:30,735
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HIM?

2332
02:21:30,735 --> 02:21:34,239
WELL, HE'S A BIT
OF AN ECCENTRIC, SIR,

2333
02:21:34,239 --> 02:21:36,241
A GENIUS,
OF COURSE,

2334
02:21:36,241 --> 02:21:38,243
BUT DEFINITELY
AN ECCENTRIC.

2335
02:21:38,243 --> 02:21:41,746
CAN'T IMAGINE
WHERE HE GETS IT FROM.

2336
02:21:45,984 --> 02:21:47,686
TRULY, YOU'LL NEVER
BELIEVE IT.

2337
02:21:47,686 --> 02:21:50,188
YOUR FATHER
WAS AT MY HOUSE.

2338
02:21:50,188 --> 02:21:52,691
THEY TOLD ME
AT THE HOUSE.

2339
02:21:52,691 --> 02:21:54,693
WE'RE RICH.

2340
02:21:55,126 --> 02:21:56,178
OH!

2341
02:21:56,178 --> 02:21:58,180
YOU KNOW,
MORE THAN THAT,

2342
02:21:58,180 --> 02:22:00,182
I HAVE SUCCEEDED.

2343
02:22:00,182 --> 02:22:02,184
I ALWAYS KNEW
YOU WOULD.

2344
02:22:02,184 --> 02:22:04,186
YOU KNOW
SOMETHING ELSE?

2345
02:22:04,186 --> 02:22:06,188
THE KIDS WERE RIGHT.

2346
02:22:06,188 --> 02:22:08,690
THERE'S NOTHING
RIDICULOUS ABOUT
GETTING MARRIED.

2347
02:22:08,690 --> 02:22:10,692
WHOEVER SAID
THERE WAS?

2348
02:22:17,699 --> 02:22:19,701
WELL, MR. POTTS.

2349
02:22:19,701 --> 02:22:21,703
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

2350
02:22:21,703 --> 02:22:24,206
NOW YOU'LL HAVE TO
MARRY ME.

2351
02:22:29,194 --> 02:22:31,196
SO DREAMS
CAN COME TRUE.

2352
02:22:31,196 --> 02:22:33,198
YES, THEY CAN,

2353
02:22:33,198 --> 02:22:36,201
BUT YOU HAVE TO
BE PRACTICAL, TOO.

2354
02:22:36,201 --> 02:22:38,203
YOU HAVE TO FACE FACTS.

2355
02:22:38,203 --> 02:22:41,706
MEN SHOULD SEE THINGS
AS THEY REALLY ARE.

2356
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:43,675
A MAN
WITH RESPONSIBILITIES

2357
02:22:43,675 --> 02:22:46,678
CAN'T HAVE HIS HEAD
IN THE CLOUDS.

2358
02:22:46,678 --> 02:22:50,682
A MAN SHOULD KEEP
HIS FEET ON THE GROUND.

2359
02:22:50,682 --> 02:22:53,184
A MAN SHOULD
HAVE HIS DREAMS

2360
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:56,688
BUT LEARN TO PUT THEM
TO PRACTICAL USE,

2361
02:22:56,688 --> 02:22:58,189
NOT JUST SIT AROUND

2362
02:22:58,189 --> 02:23:01,192
AND THINK ABOUT THEM
ALL THE TIME.

2363
02:23:08,166 --> 02:23:10,635
?? OH, YOU,

2376
02:23:41,082 --> 02:23:43,084
