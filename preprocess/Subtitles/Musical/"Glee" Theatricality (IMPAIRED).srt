00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:16,069
<i>Finn's mom's dating Kurt's dad,

2
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:17,471
<i>Kurt's plan
to get closer to Finn,</i>

3
00:00:18,973 --> 00:00:19,806
<i>When will you learn that
nothing is impossible</i>

4
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:22,776
<i>when it comes to love?
Artie told Tina</i>

5
00:00:22,844 --> 00:00:24,011
<i>what his greatest dream was,

6
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:25,245
<i>that not every dream
is achievable.</i>

7
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:26,313
<i>Is that even a word--
achievable?</i>

8
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:28,882
<i>Achievatate?
Achievalize?</i>

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,417
Okay, you just said, like,
ten offensive things.

10
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:32,619
<i>Jessie pushed Rachel
to find out who her mom was,</i>

11
00:00:32,687 --> 00:00:33,954
<i>and it turns out
it's Shelby Corcoran,</i>

12
00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:35,956
<i>the coach of Vocal Adrenaline.
I want a look that's so optimistic,</i>

13
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:38,492
<i>it could cure cancer.
Geez. And that's</i>

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,476
<i>what you missed on Glee.</i>

15
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:47,868
Am I in trouble?

16
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:50,537
Come on. You've got more
self-esteem than that.

17
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:52,272
I think this might have
something to do with

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,307
your perfect attendance
last semester.

19
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:56,009
No. Miss Cohen-Chang
is in trouble.

20
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:58,478
It has come to my attention
that the look you sport

21
00:00:58,546 --> 00:01:02,215
is what is known as goth.
American teens
are coming down

22
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:04,885
<i>with a serious case
of Twilight fever,</i>

23
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:06,987
transformed from
normal children

24
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:09,723
into vampires
obsessed with the occult.

25
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,526
And only yesterday,
this dark specter
reared its head

26
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:14,728
at McKinley High.

27
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:19,866
This is totally going to get
Robert Pattinson's attention.

28
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:20,901
{hissing}

29
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:22,569
Oh, hey.
{girls roaring}

30
00:01:22,637 --> 00:01:26,106
{all screaming}
Oh, dear God!

31
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:29,176
I don't mean
to state the obvious,

32
00:01:29,243 --> 00:01:31,111
but you do know that vampires
aren't real, right?

33
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:33,347
They don't exist.

34
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:35,682
William, denial will not
make this problem go away!

35
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,851
<i>My parents won't even
let me watch Twilight.</i>

36
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,886
My mom says she thinks Kristin
Stewart seems like a bitch.

37
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:41,788
This is a serious problem!

38
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:43,523
Miss Cohen-Chang,
you've got to find yourself

39
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:46,226
another style of dress!
Hold on a second.

40
00:01:46,294 --> 00:01:47,494
Tina is shy,

41
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:49,329
and one way she's found
to express herself

42
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:50,664
is through
her clothes.

43
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:52,499
High school is an
incredibly important time

44
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:54,935
when kids get to explore
who they are.

45
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:57,604
When I was in high school,
I had a whole year
where I dressed

46
00:01:57,672 --> 00:01:59,339
exactly like Kurt Cobain.
I mean, come on.

47
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:01,341
There has to be someone
who you used to dress like.

48
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,777
Yes. For several years
in my early 20s,

49
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:06,880
I dressed up as Elvis.
But he was a Christian, Will!

50
00:02:06,948 --> 00:02:11,718
And he did not possess the
ability to transform into a bat!

51
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:13,186
{whispers}:
I think he thinks
vampires are real.

52
00:02:13,254 --> 00:02:14,187
I think you're right.

53
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:18,025
Studies have shown that
a strict dress code fosters

54
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:20,360
a safe and stable
learning environment

55
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:23,296
with fewer instances of
gang violence and vampirism.

56
00:02:23,364 --> 00:02:25,866
So, if I see you dressed in
lacy demon clothes again,

57
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,434
Tina Cohen-Chang,
{pounds desk}

58
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:29,403
You will be suspended!

59
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:37,644
<i>Step. Couple more.</i>

60
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:39,379
Is there a car
down here from me?

61
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:41,114
Honey, we're indoors.

62
00:02:41,182 --> 00:02:42,282
Oh.
Okay.

63
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,850
And open your eyes.

64
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:50,924
Sparkling cider?
Yeah.

65
00:02:50,992 --> 00:02:54,795
"Welcome home"?
But who went somewhere?

66
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:58,465
Burt asked us to move in with them.
And this is how you're telling me?

67
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,535
The party is my idea.

68
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:03,670
If you're gonna say something,
say it loud, right?

69
00:03:03,738 --> 00:03:06,173
BURT:
Yeah. It's gonna take some
getting used to, but trust me,

70
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,474
you're gonna
love it, okay?

71
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:09,209
Now you don't have to drag
your tail over here

72
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:11,511
every time you want to watch
something on the old 55-incher.

73
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:13,947
We got a lot of food-- some
ethnic food. It's some ethnicity

74
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:16,183
that's not ours. Tuna cruditÃƒÂ©s.
Tuna cruditÃƒÂ©s. It's not ethnic.

75
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,517
Here you go.

76
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:18,852
CAROLE:
Finn, this house
is twice as big

77
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,153
as ours.
It has two bathrooms.

78
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:21,488
Two and a half.

79
00:03:21,556 --> 00:03:23,990
I don't want an extra bathroom
or a tuna crude.

80
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:25,592
I just want my house back.

81
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,195
I think I know what this
resistance is about.

82
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:29,963
Our room. And I
couldn't agree more.

83
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:33,033
The palate in here is totally
unflattering to your skin tone.

84
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,501
Not everyone can
pull off Dior gray.

85
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:38,238
We need to redecorate.
Wait, we're sharing a room?

86
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:39,873
I'm not cool with that!

87
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:41,007
CAROLE:
Baby, I know
it's weird, okay?

88
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:43,744
But can't be
much of a surprise.

89
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:46,179
And, in time, you're gonna be
as happy as I am.

90
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:47,714
Yeah, look, I'll knock
out a wall upstairs,

91
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:48,849
I'll put an
addition on, okay?

92
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,083
But-but until then,
maybe this will

93
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:51,218
grease the wheels
a bit, huh?

94
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:52,285
Oh.
Hey.

95
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:54,721
Look, that's 300.
Oh, my... Have at it.

96
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:55,622
You redecorate
this place.

97
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,990
Don't worry, roomie.

98
00:03:57,058 --> 00:03:59,459
Mr. Ikea Catalog and I
will have this all figured out.

99
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:00,861
I am going to

100
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:02,562
put together a palate
that expresses

101
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,498
who you are and who
I want you to be.

102
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:07,267
Who you want to be.
Hey, what night's game night?

103
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:09,402
You play Sorry?

104
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,670
You know...
He will now.
{chuckles}

105
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:11,538
I will...
{singsongy}:
Sorry.

106
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:13,840
I will beat you.
It's so weird.

107
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:15,442
This so isn't you.

108
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,344
I feel like
an Asian Branch Davidian.

109
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:19,012
Tina, are there any
other looks you can try?

110
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,614
Biker chick?
Cowgirl?

111
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:22,282
Hood rat.
Computer programmer.

112
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,818
Cross-country skier.
Catholic schoolgirl.

113
00:04:24,886 --> 00:04:27,020
Happy Meal, no onions.
Or a chicken.

114
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:30,690
Look, I appreciate it, guys,
but it just isn't me.

115
00:04:30,758 --> 00:04:32,292
I know who I am, and I'm not

116
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,794
allowed to show it.
It's like communism.

117
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:35,295
Guys, we have
a serious problem.

118
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:36,830
You know how I've been doing

119
00:04:36,898 --> 00:04:38,198
some deep background
on Vocal Adrenaline?

120
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:40,467
Isn't that against the rules?
No, not at all.

121
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:42,002
Or probably. Whatever!

122
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:43,970
Anyway, what I figured out;
I rooted through the Dumpsters

123
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:45,806
behind the Carmel auditorium
and I found

124
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:47,941
18 empty boxes
of Christmas lights.

125
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,009
Oh, no.

126
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:50,610
Which led me
to Joelle Fabrics.

127
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:52,279
I asked them about
red Chantilly lace.

128
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:54,548
They were sold out.
Oh, sweet Jesus.

129
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:56,550
Oh, my.
Wait, what?

130
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:58,285
- They're doing Gaga.
- That's it. It's over.

131
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:00,387
Exactly.
We should have guessed it.

132
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:01,788
They're going for
full-out theatricality.

133
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:03,924
They know it's the easiest way
to beat us. Damn them.

134
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:05,325
What's up with this Gaga dude?

135
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:07,294
He just, like, dresses weird,
right? Like Bowie?

136
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:08,962
{scoffs}
Lady Gaga is a woman.

137
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,330
She's only the
biggest pop act

138
00:05:10,398 --> 00:05:11,898
to come along in decades.
She's boundary-pushing,

139
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:13,366
the most theatrical performer
of our generation.

140
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:14,801
And she changes her look

141
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:16,002
faster than Brit changes
sexual partners.

142
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,937
That's true.

143
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:18,104
ARTIE:
It makes sense that

144
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:19,372
Vocal Adrenaline
would pay homage.

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,874
It's a brilliant move.
She's a perfect fit

146
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:22,742
for them.
Hold on a second.

147
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,644
We might be able to kill
two birds with one stone here.

148
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:26,012
We can help Tina

149
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,247
<i>find a new look
and nd</i>

150
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:28,315
a competitive number
for regionals.

151
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:31,384
This week, your assignment:

152
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:32,986
Gaga.

153
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:34,521
{gasping, murmuring}
RACHEL:
Pens, we need pens.

154
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:36,423
My ideas just come to me.
Uh, my office.

155
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,457
Right there.
I'm brainstorming.
It's coming.

156
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:40,227
And claw, claw,
uh, clap, clap.

157
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:42,429
And five, six,
seven, eight.

158
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:45,232
One, two, three, four...
Think they can see us?

159
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:46,099
{whispering}:
If they catch us,

160
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:47,567
are we gonna have to go to jail?

161
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:49,102
Stealing their ideas
is not a crime.

162
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,037
SHELBY:
...six, seven, eight.
And one, two...

163
00:05:51,105 --> 00:05:52,472
Your shoes are making noise.

164
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,608
...and five, six,
seven, eight.

165
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:57,177
And one, two, three, four, five,
six and seven...

166
00:05:57,245 --> 00:05:59,779
They look amazing.
Claw, claw, uh, clap, clap.

167
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:02,549
And five, six-- uh, uh...
Okay, okay, okay, just...

168
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:03,850
enough.

169
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:05,085
You guys aren't getting it.

170
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:06,987
Your letting the costumes
do all the work.

171
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:09,890
Theatricality isn't about crazy outfits.

172
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:11,725
It's not enough to douse
yourselves with gasoline.

173
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:14,427
You have to light yourselves
on fire to make it work.

174
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:16,796
God, she's good.
But being theatrical

175
00:06:16,864 --> 00:06:20,767
doesn't mean you have to be
a nuclear explosion.

176
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:26,539
It can be like, like a quiet storm.
You just have to radiate emotion,

177
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:29,142
express what's deep inside you.

178
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,946
That's what theatricality
is truly about.

179
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:38,151
Do I have to demonstrate?
"Funny Girl," E flat.

180
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:39,119
# Barbra Streisand's "Funny Girl" #

181
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:41,721
Exactly what I would have done:
Barbra.

182
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:43,924
I could do it in my sleep.

183
00:06:50,164 --> 00:06:53,733

208
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:06,704
Ms. Corcoran?

209
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:18,707
I'm Rachel Berry,
I'm your daughter.

210
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:29,420
Did you ever regret it?
Yes.

211
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:33,858
Then no.
Then so much.

212
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:38,362
W-When did you realize
it was the right time for me to find you?

213
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,363
{chuckles}

214
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:42,934
I saw you sing at sectionals.
You were extraordinary.

215
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,201
You were me.

216
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:46,304
{chuckles}

217
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:49,040
Was it hard for you
to not become a star?

218
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:57,014
To not have your dreams come true?
It felt like a broken promise.

219
00:09:57,082 --> 00:10:01,319
Like the Fisher King's wound--
never heals.

220
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:04,922
Wow.
Genetics really are amazing.

221
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,426
You see the world with the same
fierce theatricality as I do.

222
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:10,895
Even the way we're sitting
right now is so dramatic,

223
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:12,763
and yet we feel so
comfortable with it.

224
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:23,474
I've missed so much.
How do you feel?

225
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:24,809
Thirsty.

226
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:30,414
When I was little and
I used to get sad,

227
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:32,416
my dads would bring me
a glass of water.

228
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:36,854
It got so I couldn't
tell if I was sad

229
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:39,290
or just thirsty.

230
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:50,768
I shouldn't have done this.

231
00:10:55,073 --> 00:10:57,441
This was supposed to feel good.

232
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:59,610
W-We were supposed
to have some kind of

233
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:02,813
slow-motion run
into each other's arms.

234
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:04,181
This is all wrong.

235
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:06,350
Maybe we can just go to dinner
or something

236
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:07,818
just to get over
the initial shock.

237
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:15,493
I'm so sorry, Rachel.

238
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:20,731
Uh... I'll... I'll call you.

239
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:36,180
Oh, hey, Finn, come on in.

240
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:38,215
I'm learning all this amazing
stuff about Lady Gaga.

241
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:40,951
She's got this thing called
the "Haus of Gaga," which is

242
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:43,020
like, this collective of artists
and designers

243
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:44,255
who collaborate on,
on her styles

244
00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:45,456
and stage sets
and her music.

245
00:11:45,524 --> 00:11:47,024
I think it's
an exciting model

246
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:49,527
for what we could be doing
in Glee Club.

247
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:51,529
Yeah, that's kind of what
I wanted to talk to you about.

248
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:53,597
I don't want to do Lady Gaga.

249
00:11:53,665 --> 00:11:56,801
And I suspect that...
with the exception of Kurt...

250
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:58,769
that none of the other guys
are gonna want to do it either.

251
00:11:58,837 --> 00:12:03,274
I just feel like we're always
doing whatever the girls want us to do.

252
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:06,343
Yeah. {Will} Yeah, you're right.

253
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:10,214
Maybe I haven't been listening
to you guys hard enough.

254
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:14,919
So let's find a solution.

255
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:18,656
Well, I, uh, I actually
already have one.

256
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:20,391
You're wrong.

257
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,193
It's a really good name.
It's a rock star name.

258
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,361
You want to name our daughter
"Jack Daniels"?

259
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:25,529
She's a girl!

260
00:12:25,597 --> 00:12:27,398
Okay, fine, whatever.
Jackie Daniels.

261
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:29,834
The name is not the point.
I told you this.

262
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:30,935
I'm giving up the baby

263
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:32,636
so I don't have
to do this with you.

264
00:12:32,704 --> 00:12:34,105
This is good for you.

265
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:37,975
Now you can go off
and be a rock star yourself.

266
00:12:40,612 --> 00:12:42,580
I love wearing
champagne bubbles!

267
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:44,782
I get to express a whole
different side of myself!

268
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,350
Because even though
I'm painfully shy

269
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:48,119
and obsessed with death, I'm
a really effervescent person.

270
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:52,089
Excuse me!
Were you dropped on your heads?!

271
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:54,492
What was that?
I think you heard me.

272
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:57,394
I'm just saying.

273
00:12:57,462 --> 00:12:59,563
Pick on me-- that's fine--
but don't throw around a girl.

274
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:00,931
Well, you know, lately,

275
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,800
we haven't been able
to tell the difference.

276
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:05,903
We're not gaga for Gaga.
You dress all freaky,

277
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:07,505
and then you rub it
in everybody's faces.

278
00:13:07,572 --> 00:13:09,507
I don't want to look
at it all day!

279
00:13:09,574 --> 00:13:12,409
It's weird.
It makes my eyes tired.

280
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:14,378
If you want
to switch it up a bit,

281
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:15,646
just go from Gap
to Banana Republic.

282
00:13:15,714 --> 00:13:18,249
It's called being theatrical.
We're showing off who you are.

283
00:13:18,316 --> 00:13:20,885
It's the same thing you do
when you go to school

284
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:22,219
with your football
uniforms on.

285
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:23,554
You're expressing yourself,
and we have every right

286
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:24,955
to do the same.
Well, you know what?

287
00:13:25,023 --> 00:13:26,557
The next time you want
to express yourself

288
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,793
a little like a circus freak,
don't be shocked when my fist

289
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,595
feels like
expressing itself
against your chin!

290
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:32,663
Okay?

291
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:35,766
Knock that crazy fool
crepe-paper nonsense offa you.

292
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:38,202
Let's go.
Yeah, you don't want
to be late for

293
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,004
your appointment
at Supercuts!

294
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:41,972
Watch your mouth, homo!

295
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,875
And you know what, fancy?
You don't need

296
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:47,578
an appointment
at Supercuts.
They love walk-ins.

297
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:52,516
- {both chortle}
- {school bell rings}

298
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:56,187
Little monsters, take a bow.
{Will laughs, applause}

299
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:59,290
All right! Ladies, Kurt, I am
really, really impressed.

300
00:13:59,357 --> 00:14:02,059
<i>Sientete.
You know, you know
what the best part is?</i>

301
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:04,094
Each one of those costumes
shows off a different aspect

302
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:06,797
of  your personalities.
Wait. Where's Rachel?

303
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:08,265
I mean, I only noticed
because, like,

304
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,633
five minutes
have gone by

305
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,168
without her saying something
totally obnoxious.

306
00:14:11,236 --> 00:14:14,438
Rachel kinda got some
intense news yesterday.

307
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:16,507
We were spying on
Vocal Adrenaline, and...

308
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,542
You guys, that's not fair!
You gotta stop doing that.

309
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:22,980
But, uh, you know,
what, what'd you find out?

310
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:26,951
- Okay, y'all ready?
- Miss Corcoran, their coach?

311
00:14:27,018 --> 00:14:29,753
She's Richel's mom.
Are you serious?

312
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:32,489
Way to bury
the lead, Mercedes.

313

PUCK:
We're screwed.

314
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,293
Rachel's gonna jump ship
over to Vocal Adrenaline.
Never.

315
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:38,395
I really don't want
to talk about it, though.

316
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:39,897
I'm still processing the news.

317
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:42,166
And my dads are moving
my therapist to our spare room

318
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:43,500
later this afternoon.

319
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:46,370
All I can know is that
I'm not going anywhere,

320
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:47,972
and I've chosen
a Lady Gaga look

321
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,406
that expresses
the longing for a childhood

322
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:50,708
I was deprived of.

323
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:53,143
You look terrible.
I look awesome.

324
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:55,179
I think it's
the Kermit-the-Frog look.

325
00:14:55,247 --> 00:15:00,150
KURT: And we have a jumper.
Well, my dads can't sew,

326
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:02,219
so these are
just stapled on.

327
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:03,888
Guys, why don't we worry
about this later,

328
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:05,389
and maybe try to focus
on the song?

329
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:07,258
Couldn't agree more.
Hit it!

You being a jock
and being in this Glee Club

396
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:05,789
does not make you versatile.
It makes you bisexual.

397

And if we have
to kick your ass

<i>{song ends}</i>

<i>{girls cheering}</i>

472
00:21:37,168 --> 00:21:39,536
All right, guys,
very impressive.

473
00:21:39,604 --> 00:21:42,239
Very, very... loud.
{chuckles}

474
00:21:42,307 --> 00:21:44,808
But what, uh, what does
that performance express?

475
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:46,176
And what do those
costumes illustrate?

476
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:48,078
We did our research, Mr. Shue.

477
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:49,546
Yeah, Finn's demon look

478
00:21:49,614 --> 00:21:51,615
is because Gene Simmons liked
comic books as a kid,

479
00:21:51,683 --> 00:21:53,517
and they called Paul Stanley
the "Star Child"

480
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:55,252
because he was a romantic
or something.

481
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,953
But that doesn't
really explain my whore lips.

482
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:58,755
And my Ace Frehley is supposed

483
00:21:58,823 --> 00:22:00,057
to be a spaceman
from another planet.

484
00:22:00,124 --> 00:22:01,525
Mike's iconic catman

485
00:22:01,592 --> 00:22:03,593
is because Peter Criss
claimed to have nine lives.

486
00:22:03,661 --> 00:22:06,363
Yeah, And I'm dressed as the guy
who replaced Artie when he quit.

487
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:09,032
Well, congratulations,
guys. Job well done.

488
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,600
Let's give it up
for the boys!

489
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:12,703
{cheering}

490
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,909
I thought the boys'
KISS number was good,

491
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:21,144
although the lyrics did leave
something to be desired.

492
00:22:21,212 --> 00:22:22,813
And Finn kept sticking
his tongue out

493
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,514
and I couldn't stop
picturing him licking stuff.

494
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:25,649
It was disturbing.

495
00:22:27,118 --> 00:22:28,785
We warned you.

496
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:31,021
Now Gaga's got to go.

497
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:37,828
Could you have a word
with Azimio and Karofsky

498
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:39,963
about harassing me without
damaging my Gaga outfit?

499
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:42,265
Are you serious?

500
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,601
Do you know how difficult
it is with those guys?

501
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:46,570
They already think
we're boyfriends.

502
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:48,338
Let them think
what they want.

503
00:22:48,406 --> 00:22:49,773
They're Neanderthals.

504
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:51,675
In three years, they'll
be cleaning my septic tank.

505
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:53,510
Don't you get it?
It's not just them.

506
00:22:53,578 --> 00:22:55,045
We live in Ohio--

507
00:22:55,113 --> 00:22:58,081
not New York or San Francisco
or some other city

508
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:00,450
where people eat vegetables
that aren't fried.

509
00:23:02,553 --> 00:23:04,321
I don't understand
why you always need

510
00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:05,956
to make such a big spectacle

511
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:07,391
of yourself.

512
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,760
Why can't you just work
harder at blending in?

513
00:23:09,827 --> 00:23:11,862
I'm sure that'd be
easier for you.

514
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:14,064
You know, it would.

515
00:23:21,506 --> 00:23:24,441
You are such a boy.

516
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:26,209
You're going to have
to use a moist towelette

517
00:23:26,277 --> 00:23:27,377
if you want to get
that makeup off.

518
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:30,414
Don't touch me!

519
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:31,915
What is your problem, Finn?

520
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:33,216
It's just a moist towelette!

521
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:38,922
I'm gonna finish
in the laundry room.

522
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:42,225
Grow up, Finn!

523
00:23:49,376 --> 00:23:51,144
I know why you called,
and don't worry about it.

524
00:23:51,211 --> 00:23:52,879
My reconnection with Rachel
is not some kind of plot

525
00:23:52,747 --> 00:23:54,614
to mess with you guys
before regionals.

526
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:56,683
I'm not worried about regionals.

527
00:23:57,752 --> 00:23:58,818
It's Rachel.

528
00:23:58,886 --> 00:24:00,954
She's special.

529
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:02,856
She's got all
of the best of you.

530
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:04,491
She's strong-willed, dramatic,

531
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:06,226
wildly talented.

532
00:24:06,293 --> 00:24:07,560
Go on.

533
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:08,728
But she's not hard like you.

534
00:24:08,796 --> 00:24:10,964
She's fragile.

535
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:12,232
over-emotional.

536
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:13,466
And she's clearly
convinced herself

537
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:14,834
that you are as committed
to this reunion

538
00:24:14,902 --> 00:24:17,070
as she is.

539
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:19,272
And I don't think you are.

540
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,040
You're not
prepared to have

541
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:22,142
a teenage daughter.

542
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:23,710
Are you?

543
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,549
I can't have any more kids.

544
00:24:29,617 --> 00:24:31,885
There were issues

545
00:24:31,952 --> 00:24:33,787
a few years back.

546
00:24:33,854 --> 00:24:36,055
Then some surgery,
and that's that.

547
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:41,828
I really wanted a daughter.

548
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,167
That's why it was
so important to me

549
00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:48,635
to make that bond with her.

550
00:24:50,137 --> 00:24:53,506
But you're right.

551
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:56,643
I wanted my baby back.

552
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:58,545
Rachel's an adult now.

553
00:24:58,613 --> 00:24:59,880
She doesn't need me.

554
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:02,715
Shelby,

555
00:25:02,783 --> 00:25:04,918
I can't tell you what to do...

556
00:25:06,453 --> 00:25:09,255
But if you really love her,

557
00:25:09,323 --> 00:25:10,790
you have to tell her

558
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:12,926
what you just told me.

559
00:25:15,563 --> 00:25:17,463
KURT:
I had to skip school
to finish it,

560
00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:19,399
but I think you're really
going to like it.

561
00:25:22,136 --> 00:25:24,504
Consider it a peace offering
after all the yelling

562
00:25:24,572 --> 00:25:26,739
that we've been doing.

563
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:28,575
<i>I used Marlene Dietrich
and Gary Cooper in Morocco</i>

564
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:30,810
as my inspiration.

565
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:33,046
It's a perfect blend
of the masculine
and the feminine,

566
00:25:33,113 --> 00:25:35,148
the muted and the theatrical.

567
00:25:35,216 --> 00:25:37,684
Are you freaking insane?

568
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:40,520
I can't live here. I'm a dude.

569
00:25:42,723 --> 00:25:44,023
What the hell is that

570
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:45,325
supposed to be?

571
00:25:45,392 --> 00:25:46,693
It's a privacy partition

572
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,995
It's all I could find
on such short notice.

573
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:50,330
Why are you getting
angry about everything?

574
00:25:50,397 --> 00:25:51,531
I worked hard on thi

575
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,700
That's not
a privacy partition!

576
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:55,168
Why is it so
hard for you

577
00:25:55,236 --> 00:25:56,569
to understand?

578
00:25:56,637 --> 00:25:58,438
I don't want to get dressed
in front of you!

579
00:25:58,505 --> 00:25:59,939
Do you know that

580
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:02,508
I put my underwear on
in the shower

581
00:26:02,576 --> 00:26:04,110
before I come out
when you're around?

582
00:26:04,178 --> 00:26:05,945
I just... I don't want
to have to worry

583
00:26:06,013 --> 00:26:07,780
about that kind of stuff
in my own room, man.

584
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:09,782
And what stuff
are you referring to?

585
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,851
You know. You know
what I'm talking about.

586
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,453
Don't play dumb.

587
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,755
Why can't you just accept
that I'm not like you?

588
00:26:15,823 --> 00:26:18,524
I have accepted that.
No, you haven't.

589
00:26:18,592 --> 00:26:21,194
You think I don't see
the way you stare at me?

590
00:26:21,262 --> 00:26:23,029
How flirty you get.

591
00:26:23,097 --> 00:26:24,831
You think I don't know
why you got so excited

592
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:26,366
that we were going to be
moving in together?

593
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:28,468
It's just a room, Finn!

594
00:26:28,535 --> 00:26:30,303
We can redecorate it
if you want to!

595
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:31,938
Okay, good.

596
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:34,641
Well, then the first thing
that needs to go

597
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,276
is that faggy lamp.

598
00:26:36,343 --> 00:26:37,911
And then we need to get rid
of this faggy couch cover...

599
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:39,312
Hey!

600
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,714
What did you
just call him?

601
00:26:41,782 --> 00:26:43,850
Oh, no, no, I didn't
call him anything.

602
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:45,385
I was talking to the blanket.

603
00:26:45,452 --> 00:26:47,520
If you use that word,
you're talking about him.

604
00:26:47,588 --> 00:26:48,855
Relax, Dad. I didn't
take it that way.

605
00:26:48,923 --> 00:26:50,957
Yeah, that's because
you're 16

606
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:52,625
and you still assume
the best in people.

607
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:54,093
You live a few years,

608
00:26:54,161 --> 00:26:55,795
you start seeing the hate
in people's hearts.

609
00:26:56,931 --> 00:26:58,097
Even the best people.

610
00:26:58,165 --> 00:26:59,699
You use the "N" word?

611
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:00,733
Of course not.

612
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:02,568
How about "retard"?

613
00:27:02,636 --> 00:27:05,305
You call that nice girl
in Cheerios! with Kurt,
you call her a retard?

614
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:07,740
Becky-- no. She's my friend.
She's got Down syndrome.

615
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:09,542
I'd never call her that.
That's cruel.

616
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,210
But you think it's okay
to come into my house

617
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:12,578
and say "faggy"?

618
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:15,315
That's not what I meant...
I know what you meant!

619
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:18,584
What, you think I didn't use
that word when I was your age?

620
00:27:18,652 --> 00:27:20,320
You know,
some kid

621
00:27:20,387 --> 00:27:21,921
gets clocked in practice,

622
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:23,790
we'd tell him to stop
being such a fag.

623
00:27:23,857 --> 00:27:25,425
Shake it off.

624
00:27:25,492 --> 00:27:26,859
We meant it exactly

625
00:27:26,927 --> 00:27:29,062
the way you meant it.

626
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:30,863
That being gay is wrong.

627
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:32,298
That it's some kind

628
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:33,666
of punishable offense.

629
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:35,601
I really thought
you were different, Finn.

630
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:40,306
You know, I thought
that being in Glee Club

631
00:27:40,374 --> 00:27:43,042
and being raised
by your mom

632
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,111
meant that you were some,
you know,

633
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,914
new generation of dude
who saw things differently.

634
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:50,216
Who just kind of, you know,
came into the world

635
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:52,885
knowing what has taken me
years of struggling

636
00:27:52,953 --> 00:27:55,021
to figure out.

637
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:57,090
I guess I was wrong.

638
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,594
I'm sorry, Finn, but you
can't... you can't stay here.

639
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:03,963
Dad.

640
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:05,398
I love your mom.

641
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:08,668
And maybe this is
going to cost me her,

642
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:11,104
but my family comes first.

643
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:12,772
I can't have that kind
of poison around.

644
00:28:16,243 --> 00:28:19,278
This is our home, Kurt.

645
00:28:19,346 --> 00:28:21,581
He is my son.

646
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:27,186
Out in the world,
you do what you want,

647
00:28:27,254 --> 00:28:29,522
but not under my roof.

648
00:28:42,136 --> 00:28:45,505
The place looks great.

649
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:09,896
- You should be in orbit.
- My balls keep fallinoff.

650
00:29:09,964 --> 00:29:11,531
Been there.

651
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,467
I want to talk about this.

652
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:16,169
There's not much to say.

653
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:19,539
I feel sorry for you.
I thought you were different.

654
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:23,043
I am different.

655
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:25,178
WILL:
All right, let's
get things started.

656
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:25,646
Mr. Shue.

657
00:29:25,714 --> 00:29:27,315
There's something
I want to say to Quinn.

658
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:30,418
And I want everybody
to hear it.

659
00:29:30,486 --> 00:29:32,286
All right.

660
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,757
At first I didn't really get
this theatrical assignment,

661
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:39,227
being larger than life and
putting it all out there,

662
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:41,329
'cause I'm kind
of like that all the time.

663
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,967
That's how my dad was, too.

664
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,469
He was too busy being all crazy
and rock and roll

665
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,904
to be there for his kid.

666
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:51,405
And you know what?

667
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:53,541
I didn't care that
my dad was a badass.

668
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:56,143
I just wanted him to be there.

669
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,311
And he never was.

670
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,114
And then I learned

671
00:30:00,182 --> 00:30:02,116
all this KISS stuff

672
00:30:02,184 --> 00:30:04,485
and while Jackie Daniels
is a great name for like

673
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:08,222
a powerboat or something,
it's not right for a baby girl.

674
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,424
So if my KISS mates

675
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:13,327
will help me out,
I got a better idea.

676
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,497
Grab a stool, guys.

677
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:24,205

¶¶You say you feel so empty¶¶

688

00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:43,177
¶¶All night.¶¶

700
00:32:58,126 --> 00:33:00,728
I know you're
giving her up,

701
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:04,432
but before you do, I think
you should name her Beth.

702
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:07,468
If you'll let me,

703
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:10,905
I'd really like to be there
when she's born.

704
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:12,606
I'd really like to meet her.

705
00:33:29,912 --> 00:33:33,148
So, how'd your dads come up
with the name "Rachel"?

706
00:33:35,284 --> 00:33:37,252
<i>They were, um,
big Friends fans.</i>

707
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:44,125
I know why you're here...

708
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:45,961
to say good-bye.

709
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:49,698
I really wanted this to work.

710
00:33:53,503 --> 00:33:56,037
Do you know what
really turned me?

711
00:33:56,105 --> 00:33:58,607
That story that you told me
about your dads,

712
00:33:58,674 --> 00:34:00,375
and how they'd bring you water

713
00:34:00,443 --> 00:34:03,745
when you were sad.

714
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:05,847
We're never gonna have
anything like that.

715
00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:09,150
It's too late
for us.

716
00:34:09,218 --> 00:34:11,586
I just think that anything
we share right now

717
00:34:11,654 --> 00:34:13,889
is gonna be confusing for you.

718
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:17,859
I just don't understand.

719
00:34:17,927 --> 00:34:19,327
You're my mom.

720
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:21,897
I feel awful right now,
and I should want

721
00:34:21,964 --> 00:34:24,132
to just fall into your arms
and let you rock me

722
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,069
and tell me everything
is gonna be fine, but...

723
00:34:28,137 --> 00:34:30,639
I just don't feel it.

724
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:37,212
It's because I'm your mother,
but I'm not your mom.

725
00:34:40,816 --> 00:34:44,452
So what? Do we just pretend
we don't know each other now?

726
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:49,024
That seems silly.

727
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:52,861
Let's just be grateful
for one another...

728
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,262
from afar.

729
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,530
For a while.

730
00:34:55,598 --> 00:34:58,300
Don't think for
a second I'm gonna

731
00:34:58,367 --> 00:34:59,668
go soft on you
during regionals.

732

{sniffles}
Bring it. {chuckles}

733
00:35:06,008 --> 00:35:08,143
Can I have a hug good-bye?

734
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:14,049
Sure.

735
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,467
{sniffles}

736
00:35:32,535 --> 00:35:35,203
Can you do me one more favor?

737
00:35:37,974 --> 00:35:40,041
Sometime when you're thirsty...

738
00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:48,717
can you get yourself some water
from this cup?

739
00:35:48,784 --> 00:35:52,988
Gold stars are
kinda my thing.

740
00:35:57,093 --> 00:36:00,595
Of course. {chuckles}

741

Shelby...

742
00:36:06,569 --> 00:36:10,472
before you go, will...

743
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:12,240
will you sing with me?

744
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:15,543
Just one time.

745
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:18,446
It's sort of a fantasy of mine,

746
00:36:18,514 --> 00:36:21,349
and it would really mean
a lot to me.

747
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:24,953
I would be honored.

748

749

He's always just around.

750
00:36:31,127 --> 00:36:33,261
Um, take that.

751
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:34,696
Here you go.

{school bell ringing}
Whoa!

812
00:40:35,371 --> 00:40:37,472
Guys, why are you all
in your theatricality costumes?

813
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:39,908
It's the end of the week.
We were kinda hoping

814
00:40:39,975 --> 00:40:41,576
to learn what the lesson
of the assignment was.

815
00:40:41,644 --> 00:40:44,312
Well, um...

816
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,214
you guys have had some
great numbers this week,

817
00:40:46,282 --> 00:40:48,716
but I'm not totally sure
that I know either.

818
00:40:48,784 --> 00:40:50,051
{all laugh}

819
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:51,686
I do.

820
00:40:51,754 --> 00:40:53,221
I refuse to dress
like somebody I'm not

821
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:54,889
to be somebody I'm not.

822
00:40:54,957 --> 00:40:58,259
And I learned it's good
to be a little theatrical.

823
00:40:59,528 --> 00:41:01,129
{gasps}

824
00:41:01,196 --> 00:41:02,497
So here's what's
going to happen.

825
00:41:02,564 --> 00:41:04,899
My dad-- he's the king
of the vampires.

826
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:08,403
And Asian vampires are the most
vicious of all the vampires.

827
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,438
You're going to let me
wear my lady demon clothes,

828
00:41:10,506 --> 00:41:13,608
or my dad will fly into your
bedroom and bite your face off.

829
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:15,276
He's really pissed.

830
00:41:15,344 --> 00:41:16,377
Is that what you want?

831
00:41:16,445 --> 00:41:18,379
No, I don't want that.
I'm afraid.

832
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:20,515
Good. I'm glad we had this talk.

833
00:41:20,582 --> 00:41:22,383
Now I have to go back
to my coffin

834
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:24,852
because the light is burning
my eyes!

835
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,654
{applause}
There she is.

836
00:41:26,722 --> 00:41:30,024
{all cheering}

837
00:41:30,092 --> 00:41:31,459
Wait. Where's Kurt?

838
00:41:32,594 --> 00:41:33,594
Where's Finn?

839
00:41:33,662 --> 00:41:35,296
Fine.

840
00:41:35,364 --> 00:41:36,698
You want to hit me?

841
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:38,366
You want to beat me up?
Go ahead.

842
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:40,335
But I swear to you
I will never change.

843
00:41:40,402 --> 00:41:42,503
I'm proud to be different.

844
00:41:42,571 --> 00:41:44,505
It's the best thing about me.

845
00:41:44,573 --> 00:41:47,308
So go ahead, hit me.

846
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:48,609
I believe I will.

847
00:41:48,677 --> 00:41:50,211
Sir, would you
like to go first?

848
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:52,480
FINN:
You're not hitting anyone.

849
00:41:55,217 --> 00:41:56,884
Oh, my God.

850
00:41:56,952 --> 00:41:58,586
Is he wearing a red rubber
dress or am I trippin'?

851
00:41:58,654 --> 00:41:59,921
I want to thank you, Kurt.

852
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:01,856
I realize I still have

853
00:42:01,924 --> 00:42:03,858
a lot to learn,

854
00:42:03,926 --> 00:42:05,793
but the reason I'm here
right now...

855
00:42:05,861 --> 00:42:07,195
in a shower curtain,

856
00:42:07,262 --> 00:42:09,497
is... because of you.

857
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:13,234
And I'm not going to let anyone
lay a hand on you.

858
00:42:13,302 --> 00:42:15,236
{chuckles}
Oh, really, dude?

859
00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:17,572
'Cause I'm pretty sure
we can take both of you.

860
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:19,374
PUCK:
Yeah?

861
00:42:19,441 --> 00:42:21,509
But can you take
all of us?
AZIMIO:
Okay.

862
00:42:21,577 --> 00:42:23,277
Okay, I get it.

863
00:42:23,345 --> 00:42:25,179
I took biology.
You know what, Karofsky?

864
00:42:25,247 --> 00:42:26,581
We done disturbed
the freak hive.

865
00:42:26,648 --> 00:42:29,150
The worker freaks is trying
to protect the queen freak.

866
00:42:29,218 --> 00:42:31,419
Next time...

867
00:42:31,487 --> 00:42:33,354
we'll bring some friends, too.

868
00:42:38,193 --> 00:42:40,161
I'm tired of everyone
calling us freaks.

869
00:42:40,229 --> 00:42:42,030
<i>Welllook at us.
We are freaks.</i>

870
00:42:42,097 --> 00:42:43,865
{all laugh}

871
00:42:43,932 --> 00:42:45,900
But we're all freaks
together.

872
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:48,870
And we shouldn't
have to hide it.

873
00:42:48,937 --> 00:42:50,805
{Will clapping}

874
00:42:52,908 --> 00:42:55,009
Nice job, Finn.

875
00:42:55,077 --> 00:42:57,678
I think you just figured out
what the lesson was.

876
00:42:57,746 --> 00:42:59,547
Kinda makes me wish
I had planned it.

877
00:42:59,615 --> 00:43:03,484
But Mercedes is right,
You do all look incredibly insane.

878
00:43:03,552 --> 00:43:05,820
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're so welcome.

879
00:43:05,888 --> 00:43:07,789
WILL:
Anyways, let's get
back to work

880
00:43:07,856 --> 00:43:10,691
before you're all forced
to join the circus.

881
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:12,894
Next stop? Regionals.
