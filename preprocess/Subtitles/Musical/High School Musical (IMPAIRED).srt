00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,960
- You OK?
- Yeah.

159
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,280
- ...and pairs auditions for our two leads.
- Pfft.

160
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,080
Mr. Danforth, this is a place of learning,
not a hockey arena.

161
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,280
There is also a final sign-up for next week's
scholastic decathlon competition.

162
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,320
Chem Club president Taylor McHessey
can answer all of your questions about that.

164
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,000
Ah, the cell phone menace
has returned to our crucible of learning.

165
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,360
- Is it your phone?
- Sharpay and Ryan, cell phones.

166
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,200
- I will see you in detention.
- Ahh!

167
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,160
We have zero tolerance
for cell phones in class,

168
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,160
so we will get to know each other
in detention. Cell phone.

169
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,200
And welcome to East High, Miss Montez.
Mr. Bolton, I see your phone is involved.

170
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,760
- So we will see you in detention as well.
- That's not a possibility, Miss Darbus.

171
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,200
Your Honor, see, 'cause we have
basketball practice, and Troy...

172
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,600
Ah, that will be 15 minutes
for you too, Mr. Danforth. Count 'em.

173
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,080
Could be tough for Chad.
He can't count that high.

Shall the carnage continue?
Holidays are over, people.

176
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,720
Way over!
Now, any more comments, questions?

177
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,520
- Jason.
- How were your holidays, Miss Darbus?

178
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,760
What?

179

<i>(bell rings)</i>

180
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,880
- Sorry, man. See you in detention.
- See you later. It's all good.

181
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,720
Uhh, she's crazy.

182
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,280
Hey!

183
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,720
- I don't...
- Believe it.

184
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,920
- Well, me...
- Either. But how?

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,200
My mom's company transferred her
here to Albuquerque.

186
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,400
I can't believe you live here. I looked
for you at the lodge on New Year's Day.

187
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,080
- We had to leave first thing.
- Why are you whispering?

188
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,000
What? Oh, uh... my friends
know about the snowboarding.

189
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,160
I haven't quite told them
about the singing thing.

190
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,440
- What's up?
- Hey.

191
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,280
- Too much for them to handle?
- No, it was cool.

192
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,120
But, you know, my friends, it's, uh...
It's not what I do.

193
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,040
That was, like, a different person.

194
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,200
So, uh... anyway, welcome to East High.

195
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,760
Now that you've met Miss Darbus,
I bet you just can't wait to sign up for that.

196
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,760
I won't be signing up for anything for a
while. I just wanna get to know the school.

197
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,440
But if you sign up,
I'd consider coming to the show.

198
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,400
- Yeah, yeah. That's completely impossible.
- What's impossible, Troy?

199
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,520
I wouldn't think "impossible"
is even in your vocabulary.

200
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,200
Oh, so nice of you to
show our new classmate around.

201
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,360
Oh, were you going to sign up too?
My brother and I

202
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,000
have starred in all the school's productions
and we really welcome newcomers.

203
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,960
There are a lot of supporting roles.
I'm sure we could find something for you.

204
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,040
No, no, no. I was just looking at
all the bulletin boards.

205
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,360
Lots going on at this school. Wow.

206
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,480
Nice penmanship.

207
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,080
So, Troy. I missed you during vacation.
What'd you do?

208
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,760
You know, um... played basketball,
snowboarding, more basketball.

209
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,000
- When's the big game?
- Two weeks.

210
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,840
You are so dedicated.
Just like me.

211
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,560
I hope you come watch me in the musical.
Promise?

212
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,960
- Toodles!
- Toodles.

213
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,240
Dude, you know that school musical thing?
You get extra credit just for auditioning?

214
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,800
- Who cares?
- It's always good to get extra credit...

215
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,400
...for college...

216
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,760
Think LeBron James or Shaquille O'Neal
auditioned for their school musical?

217
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,680
- Maybe.
- Troy.

218
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,520
The music in those shows isn't hip-hop,
or rock, or anything essential to culture.

219
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,880
It's, like, show music.
It's all costumes and makeup...

220
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,920
- Oh, dude, it's frightening.
- I know. I thought it'd be a good laugh.

221
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,320
- Sharpay's kinda cute, too.
- So is a mountain lion.

222
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,400
But you don't pet it.

223
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,400

- Where did those come from?
- Didn't you put them in my locker?

305
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,000
- Of course not.
- Well, we'd love to have you on our team.

306
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,400
We meet almost every day after school.

307
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,880
Please?

308
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,640
I need to catch up on the curriculum here
before I think about joining any clubs.

309
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,840
Well, what a perfect way to get caught up.
Meeting with the smartest kids in school.

310
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,320
- What a generous offer, Taylor.
- So many new faces in detention today.

311
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,960
I hope you don't make a habit of it,

312
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,320
but the drama club can always use
an extra hand.

313
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,840
And while we are working, let us probe
the mounting evils of cell phones.

314
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,240
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

315
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,280
Come on, guys, huddle up!
We got two weeks to the big game.

316
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,440
Where's Troy and Chad?

317
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,680
Don't make me ask again.

318
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,800
<i>- Where's Troy and Chad?!
- (all) Detention.</i>

319
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,240
<i>(sighs)</i>

320
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,480
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

321
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,920
Perhaps the most heinous example of
cell-phone abuse is ringing in the theater.

322
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,800
What temerity!
The theater is a temple of art.

323
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,800
- A precious cornucopia of creative energy.
- Where's my team, Darbus?

324
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,760
What the heck are those two
doing in a tree?

325
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,680
It's called crime and punishment, Bolton.

326
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,120
Besides, proximity to the arts
is cleansing for the soul.

327
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,080
Can we have a talk, please?

328
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,320
And you two, in the gym, now!

329
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,640
If they have to paint sets for detention,
they could do it tonight, not during practice.

330
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,560
If these were theater performers,
would you seek special treatment?

331
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,000
Darbus, we are days away
from our biggest game of the year.

332
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,400
And we, Bolton, are in the midst of our
auditions for our winter musicale as well!

333
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,560
This school is about more than
just young men in baggy shorts

334
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,800
flinging balls for touchdowns!

335
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,280
Baskets! They shoot baskets.

336
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,760
Stop! Guys, listen,
you've been having this argument

337
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,880
since the day you both started
teaching here.

338
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,160
We are one school, one student body,

339
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,080
one faculty!
Can we not agree on that?

340
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,000
So, Coach, how's the team lookin'?

341
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,160
- Troy got 'em whipped into shape?
- Oh!

342
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,840
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

343
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,160
West High Knights have knocked us out
of the playoffs three years running,

344
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,280
and now we are one game away from
taking that championship back from 'em!

345
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,720
It's time to make our stand.

346
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,040
The team is you.

347
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,400
You are the team.
And this team does not exist

348
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,200
unless each and every one of you
is fully focused on our goal. Am I clear?

349
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,840
- Hey, what team?!
- Wildcats!

350
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,240
- What team?
- Wildcats!

351
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,560
- What team?
- Wildcats!

352
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,560
- Wildcats!
- Get your head in the game!

353
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,320
We've never made it past the first round

354
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,080
of the scholastic decathlon.
You could be our answered prayer.

355
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm focusing on my studies this semester,

356
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,040
and help my mom get the new house
organized. Maybe next year.

357
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,480
- What do you know about Troy Bolton?
- Troy? Hmm.

358
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,040
I'm not an expert
on that particular sub-species,

359
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,040
however, unless you speak cheerleader,

360
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,000
as in, "Oh, my gosh! Isn't Troy Bolton
just the hottie super-bum?"

361
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,520
Oh, he's so beautiful.

362
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,440
- Ha-ha. See what I mean?
- I don't know how to speak cheerleader.

363
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,640
We exist in an alternate
universe to Troy the basketball boy.

364
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,040
Have you tried to get to know him?

365
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,840
Watch how it works tomorrow
when you have lunch with us.

366
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,280
Unless you'd rather sit with the
cheerleaders and discuss firm nail beds.

367
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,480
My nail beds are history.

368
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,120
Sister!

369
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,200
- Still don't understand this detention thing.
- It was my fault.

370
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,960
- Sorry, Dad.
- Cross court.

371
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,960
Darbus will take any opportunity to
bust my chops. That includes yours too.

372
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,480
Hey, Dad?

373
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,040
Did you ever want to try something new,
but were afraid of what your friends think?

374
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,880
Like, going left? You're doing fine.

375
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,800
Well... no.

376
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,240
I mean, what if you wanna
try something really new

377
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,120
and it's a total disaster
and all your friends laugh at you.

378
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,040
Maybe they're not your friends.
That was my whole point about team today.

379
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,400
You gotta look out for each other.
You're the leader.

380
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,840
There's gonna be college scouts
at our game next week.

381
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,160
Know what a scholarship
is worth these days?

382
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,840
- A lot.
- Yeah. Focus, Troy, come on.

383
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,320
Whoo.

384
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,880
Just something for you.

385
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,760
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

386
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,640
I expect we all learned our homeroom
manners yesterday, people, correct?

387
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,960
If not, we have some dressing rooms
that need painting.

388
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,120
Now, a few announcements.

389
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,920
This morning during free period will be
your chance for the musicale auditions,

390
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,320
both single and pairs.

391
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,240
I will be in the theater until noon
for those of you bold enough to extend

392
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,200
the wingspan of your creative spirit.

393
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,560
When's she due back on the mother ship?

394
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,800
Discussing the importance
of Shakespeare...

395
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,880
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

396
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,920
The team's hitting the gym during
free period. What should we run?

397
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,240
I can't make it.
I gotta catch up on some homework.

398
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,040
What? Hello, it's only the second day back.
I'm not even behind on homework yet.

399
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,800
And I've been behind on homework
since preschool.

400
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,800
That's hilarious.
I'll catch you later.

401
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,800
Homework? There's no way.

402
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,000
<i>- How's it going?
- (Troy) Just hanging out?</i>

403
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,960
- Good to see you.
- What's he doing?

404
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,440
How's it going, man?

405
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,240
Short-cut.

406
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,040
I'm late for class.

407
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,600
<i>(boy) That's good, just leave it here.</i>

408
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,160
<i>(overlapping chatter)</i>

409
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,160
This is where the true expression
of the artist is realized.

410
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,120
Where inner truth is revealed
through the actor's journey...

411
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

412
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,200
- Was that a cell phone?
- Is it mine?

413
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,760
- No, ma'am. That was the warning bell.
- Ah!

414
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,200
Those wishing to audition must
understand that time is of the essence.

415
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,360
We have many roles to cast
and final callbacks will be next week.

416
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,800
First, you will sing a few bars and I will
give you a sense of whether or not

417
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,640
the theater is your calling. Better to hear it
from me now than from your friends later.

418
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,320
Our composer, Kelsi Nielson,
will accompany you

419
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,960
and be available for rehearsals
prior to callbacks.

420
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Shall we?

421
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,000
<i>(off-key) # It's hard

What courage to pursue a note that has
not been accessed in the natural world.

443
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,280
Bravo! Brava!

444
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,560
Perhaps the spring musicale.

Hey!

455
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,760
So you decided to sign up for something?

456
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,560
- Uh... No. You?
- No.

457
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,200
Um... why are you hiding behind a mop?

458
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,600
Your friends don't know you're here, right?

459
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,400
Right.

460
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,320
<i>(# plays intro)</i>

461
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,120
Thank you. Next.

462
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,920
Miss Darbus is a little... harsh.

463
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
- The Wildcat superstar's afraid?
- No! I'm not afraid, I...

464
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,760
- I'm just... scared.
- Me too... usually.

465
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,560
And for the lead roles of Minnie and Arnold
we only have one couple signed up.

466
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,400
Sharpay and Ryan,
I think it might be useful for you

467
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,480
to give us a sense of why
we gather in this hallowed hall.

468
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,040
What key?

469
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,240
Oh, we had our rehearsal pianist
do an arrangement.

470
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,960
Oh.

471

I told you not to do the jazz squares.

503
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,120
It's a crowd favorite.
Everybody loves a good jazz square.

<i>(applause)</i>

505
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,440
Well...

506
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,600
Are there any last-minute sign-ups?

507
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,160
Don't be discouraged. The theater club
needs more than singers. It needs fans too.

508
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,200
Buy tickets!

509
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,920
Oh, actually,

510
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,760
if you do the part with that particular
song, I imagined it much slow...

511
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,720
If we do the part?

512
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:35,440
Kelsi, my sawed-off Sondheim,
I've been in 17 school productions.

513
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,760
How many of your
compositions have been selected?

514
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,520
- This would be the first.
- Which tells us what?

515
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,600
- That I need to write you more solos?
- No. It tells us that you do not offer

516
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,800
direction, suggestion or commentary.
And you should be thankful

517
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,600
that me and Ryan can lift
your music out of its obscurity.

518
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,800
- Are we clear?
- Yes, ma'am. I mean, Sharpay.

519
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,600
Nice talking to you.

520
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
Any last-minute sign-ups?

521
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,880
- We should go.
- No? Good. Done.

522
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,120
I'd like to audition, Miss Darbus.

523
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,480
Timeliness means something in the world
of theater, young lady.

524
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,680
The individual auditions are long over
and there are simply no other pairs.

525
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,320
I'll sing with her.

526
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:31,200
Troy Bolton? Where is your sports posse
or whatever it's called?

527
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,640
- Team.
- Ah.

528
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,040
But I'm here alone.
Actually, I'm here to sing with her.

529
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,240
Yes, well, we take these shows very
seriously here at East High.

530
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,160
I called for the pairs audition,
and you didn't respond.

531
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,400
Free period is now over.

532
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,240
- She has an amazing voice.
- Perhaps the next musicale.

533
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,960
So, you're a composer?

534
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,160
You wrote the song
Ryan and Sharpay just sang?

535
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,440
And the entire show?

536
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,000
Well, that's really cool.

537
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,720
I can't wait to hear the rest of the show.

538
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,720
So, why are you so afraid of
Ryan and Sharpay?

539
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,800
- I mean, it is your show.
- It is?

540
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,440
Isn't the composer of a show kind of
like the playmaker in basketball?

541
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,000
Playmaker?

542
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,160
The one who makes everyone else
look good.

543
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,480
Without you there is no show.
You're the playmaker here, Kelsi.

544
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,440
I am?

545
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,440
Do you wanna hear how the duet's
supposed to sound?

546
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,360
# It's hard to believe that I couldn't see

547
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,880
# You were always there beside me

548
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,080
# Thought I was alone with no one to hold

549
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,160
# But you were always right beside me

550
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,480
# This feeling's like no other

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,720
# I want you to know

552
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,480
# That I've never had someone
that knows me like you do

553
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,000
# The way you do

554
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,760
# And I've never had someone
as good for me as you

555
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,040

# So lonely before I finally found

557
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,080
# What I've been looking for

558
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,800
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

559
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,440
Wow. That's nice.

560
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,720
Bolton, Montez - you have a callback.

561
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,160
Kelsi, give them the duet
from the second act.

562
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,240
- Work on it with them.
- All right.

563
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,080
If you guys wanna rehearse, I'm usually
here during free period and after school,

564
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,160
and even sometimes during biology class.
You can come and rehearse anytime.

565
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,800
Or come to my house for breakfast.
I have a piano, we can rehearse there.

566
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,920
After school, before school - whatever
works. After basketball class...

567
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,880
What?

568
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,800
<i>(Sharpay) Callback?! Aah!</i>

569
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,880
"Callback for roles Arnold and Minnie
next Thursday, 3:30pm.

570

Ryan and Sharpay Evans,
Gabriella Montez and Troy Bolton."

571
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,640
Is this some kind of joke?
They didn't even audition!

572
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,440
- Maybe we're being punked?
- What?

573
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,840
Maybe we're being filmed right now.
Maybe we'll get to meet Ashton!

574
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,960
Oh, shut up, Ryan!

575
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,880
What's wrong?

576
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,320
<i>(Chad) What?</i>

577
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,200
Uhh!

578
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,760
How dare she sign up! I picked out
the colors for my dressing room.

579
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,720
She hasn't even asked our permission
to join the drama club.

580
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,760
- Someone's gotta tell her the rules.
- Exactly.

581
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,800
- And what are the rules?
- Ohh!

582
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,880
# You can bet there's nothin' but net
when I am in a zone and on a roll

583
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,520
# But I got a confession,
my own secret obsession

584
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,760
# And it's making me lose control

585
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,440
# Everybody gather 'round

586
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,720
If Troy can tell his
secret, then I can tell mine.

587
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,760
- I bake.
- What?

588
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,000
I love to bake! Strudels, scones,
even apple pandowdy.

589
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,000
# Not another sound

590
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,000
Someday I hope to make
the perfect créme brulée.

591

# No, no, no, no!

# Stick to the stuff you know

593
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,560
# If you wanna be cool
follow one simple rule

594
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,600
# Don't mess with the flow
no, no

595
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,680
# Stick to the status quo

596
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,720
# Look at me and what do you see?
Intelligence beyond compare

597
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,800
# But inside I am stirring,
something strange is occurring

598
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,440
# It's a secret I need to share

599
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,280
# Open up, dig way down deep

600
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:37,600
Hip-hop is my passion.
I love to pop and lock and jam and break!

601
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,840
Is that even legal?

602
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,680
# Not another peep!

603
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,400
It's just dancing.
I think it's cooler than homework.

604
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,680
# No, no, no, no!
No, no, no

# Stick to the stuff you know

606
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,160
# It is better by far
to keep things as they are

607
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,120
# Don't mess with the flow,

# Listen well, I'm ready to tell
about a need that I cannot deny

610
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,440
# Dude, there's no explanation
for this awesome sensation

611
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,640
# But I'm ready to let it fly

612
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,520
# Speak your mind and you'll be heard

613
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,840
If Troy wants to be a singer,
then I'm coming clean.

614
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,240
- I play the cello!
- Awesome! What is it?

615
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,560
- A saw!
- No, dude, it's like, a giant violin!

616
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,320
# Not another word

617
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,120
- Do you have to wear a costume?
- Coat and tie.

618
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,840
# No, no, no, no!
No, no, no

# Everybody quiet!

644
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,000
Why is everybody staring at you?

645
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,560
- Not me, you.
- Because of the callbacks?

646
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,800
I can't have people staring at me.
I can't.

647
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,880
# No! No, no, no

00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,080
I am so sorry.

661
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,640
You do not want to get into that, man.

662
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,280
- Too much drama.
- Yeah.

663
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,720
What is going on here?

664
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,960
Look at this! That Gabriella girl
just dumped her lunch on me!

665
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,320
On purpose! It's all part of their plan to
ruin our musical.

666
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,760
And Troy and his basketball robots
are obviously behind it.

667
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,520
Why do you think he auditioned?

668
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,360
After all the hard work you've
put into this show.

669
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,720
It just doesn't seem right.

670
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,600
- What's up?
- What's up? Oh, let's see...

671
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,840
You missed free-period workout
to audition for a heinous musical.

672
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,280
And now suddenly people are confessing.

673
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,600
Yeah, and Zeke.
Zeke is baking... créme brulée.

674
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,640
What's that?

675
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,960
Oh, a creamy custard
with a caramelized surface.

676
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,640
- It's really satisfying.
- Shut up, Zeke!

677
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,040
Look... do you see
what's happening here, man?

678
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,040
Our team is coming apart
because of your singing thing.

679
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,560
Even the drama geeks and
the brainiacs suddenly think that they can...

680
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,680
...talk to us.

681
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,360
- Look, the skater dudes are mingling.
- Yo!

682
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,040
Suddenly people think that they
can do other stuff.

683
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,360
Stuff that's not their stuff.

684
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,440
You're thinking about show tunes,
when we've got a playoff game next week.

685
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,920
Whoa!

686
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,400
Whoa!

687
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,040
<i>- Ooh!
- (boy) Head's up!</i>

688
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,640
- All right. Cards on the table right now.
- Huh?

689
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,480
You're tweaked because I put your stars
in detention and now you're getting even.

690
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,160
What are you talking about, Darbus?

691
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,760
Your all-star son
turned up at my audition.

692
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,480
Now, I give every student an even chance,

693
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,640
which is a long and honorable
tradition in the theater.

694
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,280
Something that you wouldn't understand.

695
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:53,640
But, if he is planning some sort of practical
joke in my chapel of the arts...

696
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,040
- Troy doesn't even sing.
- Oh, well, you're wrong about that.

697
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:02,760
<i>But I will not allow my Twinkle Town
musicale to be made into farce.</i>

698
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,800
<i>- Twinkle Town?
- See? I knew it!</i>

699
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,280
- Hey...
- I knew it!

700
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,360
Sounds like a winner.
Good luck on Broadway!

701
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,680
Is Sharpay really, really mad at me?
I said I was sorry.

702
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,160
Look, no one has beaten out Sharpay for
a musical since kindergarten.

703
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,120
I wasn't trying to beat anyone out.

704
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,440
We didn't even audition,
we were just singing.

705
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,600
You won't convince Sharpay of that.

706
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,760
If that girl could play both Romeo and
Juliet, her own brother would be aced out.

707
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:37,080
I told you it just happened, but I liked it.

708
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,960
A lot.

709
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,880
Did you ever feel like there's
a whole other person inside you

710
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,400
just looking for a way to come out?

711
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,840
Not really. No.

712
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,200
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

713
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,640
Let's go.

714
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,080
Hey, Sharpay, I thought since Troy Bolton's
gonna be in your show...

715
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,480
Troy Bolton is not in my show.

716
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,440
OK, um... well, I thought maybe
you could watch me play ball sometime.

717
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:10,160
- I'd rather stick pins in my eyes.
- Wouldn't that be awfully uncomfortable?

718
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,920
Evaporate, tall person!

719
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,800
I bake!

720
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,600
If that helps.

721
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:46,600
- Wow! It's like a jungle up here.
- Yeah, just like that cafeteria.

722
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,360
Well, I just humiliated myself into
the next century.

723
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,400
- No! Come on.
- So this is your private hideout?

724
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,840
Yeah. Thanks to the science club. Which
means my buddies don't know it exists.

725
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,760
You pretty much have the school wired,
don't you, Troy?

726
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,120
Seems to me like everyone on campus
wants to be your friend.

727
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,400
Unless we lose.

728
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,720
Well, I'm sure it's tricky
being the coach's son.

729
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,440
Makes me practice a little harder,
I guess.

730
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,480
I don't know what he'll say
about the singing.

731
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,480
- You worried?
- My parents friends are always saying,

732
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:25,360
"Your son's the basketball guy.
You must be so proud."

733
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,120
Sometimes I don't wanna be
the "basketball guy."

734
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,520
I just wanna be a guy. You know?

735
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,760
I saw the way you treated Kelsi at
the audition yesterday.

736
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,480
Do your friends know that guy?

737
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,400
To them, I'm the playmaker dude.

738
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,280
They don't know enough
about you, Troy.

739
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,840
At my other schools I was
the freaky math girl.

740
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,520
It's cool coming here and being...
anyone I wanna be.

741
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,000
When I was singing with you
I just felt like... a girl.

742
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,320
You even look like one, too.

743
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,760
Remember in kindergarten how you'd meet
a kid and know nothing about them,

744
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,320
then ten seconds later you play
like you're best friends

745
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,160
because you didn't have to
be anything but yourself.

746
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,600
- Yeah.
- Singing with you felt like that.

747
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,280
Well, uh... I never thought about singing.
That's for sure.

748
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,320
Till you.

749
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,000
So you really wanna do the callbacks?

750
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,120
Hey, just call me freaky callback boy.

751
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,200
You're a cool guy, Troy.

752
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,320
But not for the reasons your friends think.

753
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,680
And thanks for showing me
your top-secret hiding place.

754
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,080

00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,160
# Flyin'

763
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,280
# There's not a star in heaven that we...

764
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,280
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

765
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:22,320
Let's go, guys! Make it sharp!
To the chest, come on! Pop it!

766
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,880
Come on, guys. Step with it!
Let's go!

767
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,280
Come on, move it! Let's go!

768
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,480
Come on, guys, focus! Focus!
Get your head in the game!

769
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,960
Move it!

770
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,560
- You seen Troy?
- No... Coach.

771
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,320
<i>(blows whistle) Again, let's go!</i>

772
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,960
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

773
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,280
That's it, guys. Let's hit the showers.
Good hustle. Let's see that in the game.

774
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,880
I, uh.. think I'm gonna stay a while.
Work on some free throws.

775
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:17,440
Since you missed practice, I think your
team deserves a little effort from you today.

776
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:30,120
Wow. So this is your real stage.

777
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,440
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.

778
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,680
Or just a smelly gym.

779
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,960
Whoa!

780
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,160
Don't tell me you're good at hoops, too.

781
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,240
You know, I once scored 41 points
at a league championship game.

782
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,360
- No way.
- Mm -hm. And the same day,

783
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,760
I invented the space shuttle
and microwave popcorn.

784
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,960
Oh! Microwave popcorn. Ha-ha. Funny.

785
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,080
- I've been rehearsing with Kelsi.
- Me, too. And, by the way,

786
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,760
I missed practice. So if I get kicked off
the team it'll be on your conscience.

787
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,520
- Hey, I wasn't the one who told you...
- Gabriella, chill.

788
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,040
Hey, that's traveling.
No, that's really bad traveling.

789
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,240
<i>(laughing)</i>

790
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,640
Miss! I'm sorry, this is a closed practice.

791
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,480
- Dad, practice is over.
- Not till the last player leaves.

792
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,760
- Team rule.
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

793
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,000
- Dad, this is Gabriella Montez.
- Ah, your detention buddy.

794
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,480
I'll see you later, Troy.

795
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,640
Nice meeting you, Coach Bolton.

796
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,720
You as well, Miss Montez.

797
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,520
Dad, detention was my fault,
not hers.

798
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,240
You haven't missed practice in three years.
That girl shows up...

799
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,960
That girl is named Gabriella.
She's very nice.

800
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,120
Helping you miss practice doesn't
make her very nice. Not in my book.

801
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,120
- Or your team's.
- Dad, she's not a problem.

802
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,520
- She's just a girl.
- But you're not just a guy, Troy.

803
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,880
You're the team leader.

804
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,480
What you do effects not only this team,
but the entire school.

805
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:09,680
And without you completely focused,
we're not gonna win next week.

806
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,040
The championship games -
they don't come along all the time.

807
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,840
- They're something special.
- Yeah, a lot of things are special, Dad.

808
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,160
But you're a playmaker...
not a singer, right?

809
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,080
Did you ever think maybe I could be both?

810
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,640
- What?
- Let's go.

811
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,680
What spell has this elevated-IQ
temptress girl cast

812
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,840
that suddenly makes you wanna be
in musical?

813
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,760
Look, I just did it. Who cares?

814
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,280
Who cares? How about your most
loyal best friend?

815
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,040
- Quiet in here, Mr. Danforth.
- It's him, Miss Falsaff, not me.

816
00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:00,520
Look, you're a hoops dude,
not a musical singer person.

817
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,760
Have you seen Michael Crawford
on a cereal box?

818
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,320
- Who's Michael Crawford?
- Exactly my point.

819
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,960
He was the Phantom of the Opera
on Broadway.

820
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,480
Now my mom, she's seen
that musical 27 times,

821
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,080
and put Michael Crawford's picture
in our refrigerator.

822
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,640
Yeah, not on it, in it.

823
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,840
So my point is, if you play basketball,
you're gonna end up on the cereal box.

824
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,760
If you're in musicals, you'll
end up in my mom's refrigerator.

825
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,440
Why in her refrigerator?

826
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:31,480
One of her crazy diet ideas. I won't
attempt to understand the female mind.

827
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,720
It's foreign territory.

828
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:42,000
How can you expect the rest of us to be
focused on a game if you're off somewhere

829
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,800
in leotards singing "Twinkle Town"?

830
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,800
No one said anything about leotards.

831
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,040
Not yet, my friend, but just you wait.

832
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,680
Look, we need you, Captain.
Big time.

833
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,560
- Mr. Danforth.
- I tried to tell him, Miss Falsaff.

834
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,040
Really tried.

835
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,920
Something isn't right.

836
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,960
- Hey, look. We need to talk.
- Go.

837
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,440
They must be trying to figure out a way to
make sure Troy and Gabriella beat us out.

838
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,680
The jocks rule most of the school,
but if they get Troy into a musical,

839
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,640
then they've conquered
the entire student body.

840
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,760
And if those science girls get Gabriella
hooked up with Troy Bolton,

841
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,480
the scholastic club goes from drool to cool.

842
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,760
Ryan, we need to save our show from
people who don't know the difference

843
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,400
between a Tony Award and Tony Hawk.

844
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,640
Do you think that'll work?

845
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,120
It's the only way to save Troy and Gabriella
from themselves.

846
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,200
- So we on?
- Yeah.

847
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,920
- Good. So we start tomorrow then.
- OK, the first thing.

848
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,200
- Nice. Let's go.
- Cool.

849
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,640
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

850
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,680
So, my watch is 7:45 Mountain Standard
time. We synched?

851
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,640
- Whatever.
- Then we're on go mode for lunch, 12:05.

852
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,040
<i>Yes, Chad, we're a go.
But we're not Charlie's Angels, OK?</i>

853
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,080
I can dream, can't I?

854
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,680
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

855
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,640
"Spider" Bill Netrine,
class of '72.

856
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,880
He was the MVP in the league
championship game.

857
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:43,400
Sam Nedler, class of '02.
Also known as "Sammy Slamma Jamma."

858
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,040
Captain, MVP of the league
championship team.

859
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,040
The "Thunder Clap," Hap Hadden, '95.

860
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,720
Led the Wildcats to
back-to-back city championships.

861
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,760
- A legend.
- Yes. Legends, one and all.

862
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,080
But do you think that any of these Wildcat
legends became legends

863
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,480
by getting involved in musical auditions
days before the league championships?

864
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,640
- Get your head in the game!
- No.

865
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,400
These Wildcat legends became legends

866
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,720
because they never took
their eye off the prize.

867
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,600
Get your head in the game!

868
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:16,320
Who was the first sophomore ever
to make starting varsity?

869
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,120
- Troy!
- Who voted him team captain this year?

870
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,360
- Us!
- And who is gonna get their butts kicked

871
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,560
in Friday's championship game if Troy's
worried about an audition?

872
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,720
- We are.
- Guys, come on.

873
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,680
There's 12 people on this team,
not just me.

874
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,320
Just 12? Oh, no.

875
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:38,080
I think you're forgetting about one very
important 13th member of our squad.

876
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,280
- My dad.
- Yes, Troy.

877
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,240
Wildcat basketball champion,
class of 1981.

878
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:52,240
Champion, father, and now coach.

879
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,320
It's a winning tradition like no other.

880
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,640
From lowly Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon,
to early warriors, medieval knights.

881
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,840
All leading up to...

882
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,800
...lunkhead basketball man.

883
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,800
Yes, our culture worshiped the aggressor
throughout the ages

884
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,720
and we end up with spoiled, overpaid
bonehead athletes

885
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,560
who contribute little to civilization other
than slam dunks and touchdowns.

886
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,600
That is the inevitable world
of Troy Bolton.

887
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,400
But the path of the mind,
the path we're on,

888
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,160
ours is the path that
has brought us these people:

889
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,280
Eleanor Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo,
Sandra Day O'Connor,

890
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,400
Madame Curie, Jane Goodall,
Oprah Winfrey

891
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,320
and so many others
who the world reveres.

892
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,160
Uh, but, what is...?
I've got Kelsi waiting for me to rehearse.

893
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,200
Gabriella!

894
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,360
Troy Bolton represents one side
of evolution.

895
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,960
And our side, the side of education
and accomplishment

896
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,040
is the future of civilization!

897
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,880
This is the side where you belong.

898
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,000
Guys, if you don't know that I'll put
a 110% of my guts into that game,

899
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,280
then you don't know me.

900
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,160
- But we just thought...
- I'll tell you what I thought.

901
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:12,320
I thought that you're my friends.
Win together, lose together, teammates.

902
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,120
- But suddenly the girl... and the singing.
- Man, I'm for the team!

903
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,240
I've always been for the team.
She's just someone I met.

904
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:24,040
<i>All right the singing thing is nothing.
A way to keep my nerves down.</i>

905
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,880
<i>It means nothing to me.
You're my guys and this is our team.</i>

906
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,840
<i>Gabriella is not important.</i>

907
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:34,840
<i>I'll forget about her, forget the audition
and we'll get that championship.</i>

908
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,160
<i>Everyone happy now?</i>

909
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,160
Behold lunkhead basketball man.

910
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:47,520
So, Gabriella, we'd love to have you
for the scholastic decathlon.

911
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,880
Did you wanna grab some lunch?

912
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,520
Well, we'll be there if you wanna come.

913
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,200
- Wildcats!
- Get your head in the game!

914

# 'Cause now I have to pretend
that I don't really care

# I thought you were my fairy tale

930

# A dream when I'm not sleeping

931

# A wish upon a star that's coming true

932
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:17,000
# But everybody else could tell

933
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,720
# That I confused my feelings with the truth

934
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,240
# When there was me and you

935
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:36,200
# I swore I knew the melody
that I heard you singing

936
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:43,920
# And when you smiled you made me feel
like I could sing along

937
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,480
# But then you went
and changed the words

938
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,520
# Now my heart is empty

939
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:58,320
# I'm only left with used-to-bes
and once upon a song

940
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,120
# Now I know your not a fairy tale

941
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,960
# And dreams were meant for sleeping

942
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:14,400
# And wishes on a star
just don't come true

943
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,680
# 'Cause now even I can tell

944

I wanna talk to you about something.

And here it is: I know what it's like
to carry a load with your friends.

957
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:32,360
I get it. You've got your boys, Troy.
It's OK. So we're good.

958
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,040
Good about what?
I wanna talk about the final callbacks.

959

I don't wanna do the callbacks either.

You've got your team and I've got mine.

I'll do the scholastic decathlon

Oh... wonderful.

978
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,760
We had a team meeting about how
we haven't been acting like a team.

979
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,960
I mean us, not you.

- About the singing thing...
- I don't even wanna talk about it.

981

We just want you to know
that we're gonna be there.

- Cheering for you.
- Huh?

983
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,320
If singing is what you wanna do,

984
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,280
we should boost you up,
not tear you down.

985
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,880
Yeah. Win or lose, we're teammates.

986
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:11,200
That's what we're about. Even if you turn
out to be the worst singer in the world.

987
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,040
Which we don't know, because we
haven't heard you sing.

988
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,520
You're not gonna hear me sing, guys.

989
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,000
Because Gabriella won't even talk to me...

990
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,400
...and I don't know why.

991
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,680
We do.

992
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,600
I baked these fresh today.

993
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,240
You'll probably want to try one
before we tell you the rest.

994
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,680
Gabriella, we were jerks.

995
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,880
No, we were worse than jerks
because we were mean jerks.

996
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,160
We thought Troy
and the whole singing thing was

997
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,840
killing our chances of having you
on the scholastic decathlon team.

998
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,560
I heard what he had to say.
I'm on your team now. Done.

999
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,320
No, not done.

1000
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,520
We knew that Chad could get
Troy to say things

1001
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,560
to make you want to
forget about the callbacks.

1002
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,120
We planned it,
and we're embarrassed and sorry.

1003
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,320
No one forced Troy to say anything.
And you know what? It's OK.

1004
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,280
We should prepare for the decathlon,
it's time to move on.

1005
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,880
No, it's not OK.

1006
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:13,080
The decathlon is whatever, but how you
feel about us, and even more, Troy -

1007
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,800
- that's what really matters.

<i>(mouths) No.</i>

Um... Gabriella is kind of busy with
homework, so now's not a good time.

1014
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:05,800
I made a mistake, Miss Montez, and I
would really like to let Gabriella know that.

1015
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:12,480
- Could you tell her I came by to see her?
- I will... Troy.

1016
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,280
- Good night.

I was sick of my friends riding me,
so I said things to shut them up.

The whole singing thing
is making the school whack.

1026

You said so yourself. Everyone's
treating you differently because of it.

only be the basketball guy.</i>

01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,200

We have to do something.

1071
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,680
OK, our callbacks on Thursday

1072
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,160
and the basketball game
and scholastic decathlon are on Friday.

1073
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,040
Too bad all these events weren't
happening on the same day...

1074
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,480
...at the same time.

1075
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:36,160
That wouldn't work out because then Troy
and Gabriella wouldn't be able to make...

1076
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,680
I'm proud to call you my sister.

1077

about Troy and that Montez girl.</i>

1079
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:52,800
So, if you're telling me as co-presidents of
the drama club that changing the callbacks

1080
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:58,760
would be what's best for our theater
program, I might actually agree with you.

1081
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,000
Is that a yes?

1083

01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,280
# Stomp, stomp, stomp

# Bop bop bop, straight to the top...

1086

<i>(Chad) No problem at all.
It was crazy, man.</i>

1087
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,120
Callbacks the same time as the game?

1088
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,880
- And the scholastic decathlon.
- Why would they do that?

1089
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,680
- I smell a rat named Darbus.
- I think two rats, neither named Darbus.

1090
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,720
Do you know something about this,
small person?

1091
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,840
Miss Darbus thinks
she's protecting the show,

1092
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,040
but Ryan and Sharpay are
only concerned with protecting themselves.

1093
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,120
Do you know what I'll do to
those two show dogs?

1094
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,400
Nothing. We're not gonna do
anything to them.

1095
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,240
Except to sing, maybe.

1096
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,920
Now this is only gonna happen if
we all work together.

1097
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,440
- Now who's in?
- You know I'm in.

- Hey, you had your turn.

1120

You know what I want from you today?

- The championship.
- Well, that'll come or it won't.

What I want is for you to have fun.

I know all about the pressure.
Probably too much of it has come from me.

You give me that, and I will sleep with a
