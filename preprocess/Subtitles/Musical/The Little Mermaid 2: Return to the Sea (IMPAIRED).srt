00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:08,075
But that's not possible.

812
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:11,158
Nobody can remove the trident
from the stand except you, sire.

813
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,663
You or one of your descendants.

814
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,039
Melody.

815
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,918
Who I was supposed to be watching.

816
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:22,548
Go ahead, crack me open.
Make a crab cake out of me, sire.

817
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,804
But how could she have gotten here?

818
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:29,726
Morgana.
If she gets her hands on my trident...

819
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,473
Double the search parties!

820
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,930
I want every creature
in the ocean on patrol!

821
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,897
Yes, sire!

822
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,737
ARIEL: Wait a minute.

823
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,615
I know those two.

824
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,660
It's all my fault.

825
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:54,333
If I had just paid a little more attention

826
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:57,753
instead of blabbering
on and on and on...

827
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,347
...and on and on.

828
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:12,598
From now on, Your Majesty,
nothing gets past

829
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,262
me.

830
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,476
Whoo-hoo!

831
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,898
Yeah!

832
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,319
We did it!

833
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,941
Uh-huh. Uh...

834
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,022
Hmm?

835
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:34,623
All this time Atlantica was never
that far away from home.

836
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:38,123
This is your home?

837
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,412
It used to be.

838
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:43,750
Whoa, what a pad.
Talk about your kerb appeal.

839
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,129
But what's with the wall?

840
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,258
I know good fences make good
neighbours, but isn't that a bit much?

841
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,180
What you tryin' to keep out?

842
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,384
It wasn't built to keep something out.

843
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,223
It was built to keep me in.

844
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,268
Come on. Let's go.

845
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,731
DASH: Whoa-ho-ho!
TIP: Whoo-hoo!

846
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:11,361
TIP: You know, kid, the three of us,
we make a pretty good team.

847
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:15,164
DASH: Once you're a permanent
mermaid, we'll be friends forever.

848
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:20,245
- We'll be inseparable.
- Nothing will ever come between us.

849
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,750
- Shark! Run! Run!
- Shark!

850
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,044
No, wait!

851
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,926
- It's just...
- (LAUGHS)

852
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:30,004
Leavin' so soon, boys?

853
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,761
What can I say?
When you got it, you got it.

854
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,343
Hey! You got it!

855
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,179
Sweetheart, you're my new hero.

856
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,983
Let's go. It's time for some magic.

857
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,526
But... But my friends...

858
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:48,152
Ha! You mean you call those two
yellow-bellied sea slugs your friends?

859
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,115
Come on!

860
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,534
You wanna be a mermaid, or what?

861
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,284
We got the power. We got the power.
(GRUNTING)

862
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,660
We got the power!

863
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,884
(GASPS) So there it is.

864
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:16,768
Swim back as fast as you can and tell
my father. I'll try to find Melody.

865
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:21,894
Oh, but if that old sea witch is in there,
and then there's that mean little shark,

866
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,943
and then those manta rays come, and
then she takes those creepy tentacles

867
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:28,942
so suction cups stick to your face, and...

868
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,565
(SIGHS) Uh-uh.

869
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,946
No way you're going in there alone.

870
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:34,989
But, Flounder, if we both go,

871
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,788
who's going to tell Daddy
where Morgana's lair is?

872
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:41,242
What's all the whispering about?
Is Melody around here?

873
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:44,165
- Did you find her yet? If she's...
- Scuttle!

874
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,212
(WHISPERS) Get down and be quiet.

875
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,419
Wait a minute.

876
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,092
Scuttle can get help.

877
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:56,345
Scuttle, I need you
to pay very close attention.

878
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,226
We're doomed.

879
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,849
Oh, there you are, darling!

880
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,853
Oh, I was so worried about you.

881
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:08,778
And look!
You've brought back my trident.

882
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,072
- Clever girl.
- Give it to her! Give it to her!

883
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,032
Hey!

884
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:17,408
Forgive him, dear.
He's got a little size issue.

885
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,831
Now, if you'll just hand over the...

886
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,625
- Melody, don't! Don't listen to her!
- Mom!

887
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,126
BOTH: You're a mermaid?

888
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,924
Ariel, how nice of you to come.

889
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,548
And you brought Flopper with you.

890
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,254
The name's Flounder.

891
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,010
Grrr!

892
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,808
"Grrr" yourself, pipsqueak.

893
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,848
Get that thing and hit me.

894
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:44,392
One bite, and he's shrimp toast.

895
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,517
Sweetheart, hand me my trident now.

896
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:52,280
All this time, and you never told me?

897
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:56,530
Kept the most important secret in
her whole life from her own daughter.

898
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,111
Please, give it to me, Melody.

899
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,413
No, hand it to me.

900
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,583
- It's for your own good.
- She's lying!

901
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,502
I've given you
what you've always wanted.

902
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:11,128
She's the one who lied to you
all these years.

903
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,176
- I was trying to protect you.
- By fencing me in?

904
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,344
You knew how much I loved the sea.

905
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,305
Why did you keep the truth from me?

906
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:23,011
Melody, listen to me. If there was one
thing in my life that I could do over...

907
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,308
Too late, Mom.

908
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,434
Melody, no!

909
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,525
(CACKLING)

910
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:40,074
All the power of the seven seas
at my command!

911
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,119
Hello! Can we get with the programme?

912
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:47,452
It's still a small world down here!

913
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,418
Mom!

914
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:56,048
Your mommy was only trying
to protect you from <i>moi!</i>

915
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,130
What she did, she did out of... (SNIFFS)

916
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,556
...love.

917
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:05,853
Little Melody's been a very naughty girl,

918
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:09,478
stealing from her own grandfather.

919
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,275
My grandfather?

920
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:18,441
King Triton, ruler of Atlantica,
commander in chief of all of the oceans!

921
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:22,495
Or at least he was,
until a certain little thief came along.

922
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,570
You tricked me.

923
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:26,407
You've got no one to blame but yourself.

924
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,126
Tell me, Melody.

925
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:32,296
Is being a mermaid
everything you dreamed?

926
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,335
Was it worth it?

927
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,882

Oh!

930
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:40,762
- (GROANS)
- Melody!

931
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:48,346
Oh, and by the way,

932
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,932
your time as a mermaid
has just about expired.

933
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,355
Catch you later.

934
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:57,358
I've got bigger fish to fry!

935
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:00,111
Bigger fish! Now, there's an idea!

936

(GRUNTING)

937
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,652
We gotta keep trying.

938
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:09,416
It's no use. It's too thick.

939
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,630
(SOBBING) Oh, Flounder.

940
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,299
I've ruined everything.

941
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:25,261
We're guppies, man. Jellyfish.

944
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,355
Well, at least we're alive.

945
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:39,029
Yeah, if you wanna call this living.

946
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,569
Okay, on the one hand,

947
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,825
we can live a long, healthy life,

948
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:51,826
albeit as disgusting,
pathetic, cowardly...

949
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,378
- Worms.
- That's good. Good.

950
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,421
Cowardly worms.

951
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,921
On the other hand, we could gather
our courage, if we had any,

952
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,670
and storm the fortress and be heroes.

953
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:06,181
Yeah, until they hack us up
into fish bait.

She could be in big trouble.
She may really need our help!

So what's it gonna be?

960
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,156
A lifetime as worms,

961
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,859
or two minutes as heroes?

<i>Wouldn't you think I'm the girl</i>

1134
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:28,124
<i>The girl who has everything</i>

1135
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:33,303
<i>Look at this trove
Treasures untold</i>

1136
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:37,344
<i>How many wonders
can one cavern hold</i>

1137
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,846
<i>Looking around here you'd think</i>

1138
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:44,272
<i>Sure, she's got everything</i>

1139
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:48,519
<i>I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty</i>

1140
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:52,105
<i>I've got who's-it's and what's-it's galore</i>

1141
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:56,405
<i>You want thingamabobs
I've got twenty</i>

1142
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:59,829
<i>But who cares
No big deal</i>

1143
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:03,996
<i>I want more</i>

1144
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:08,629
<i>I want to be where the people are</i>

1145
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:12,801
<i>I want to see
Want to see 'em dancing</i>

1146
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:16,550
<i>Walking around on those
What do you call 'em</i>

1147
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:20,008
<i>Oh, feet</i>

1148
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,521
<i>Flipping your fins
you don't get too far</i>

1149
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:28,358
<i>Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'</i>

1150
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:32,438
<i>Strollin' along down the
What's that word again</i>

1151
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,444
<i>Street</i>

1152
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:37,400
<i>Up where they walk</i>

1153
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,360
<i>Up where they run</i>

1154
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:43,244
<i>Up where they stay
all day in the sun</i>

1155
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,245
<i>Wandering free</i>

1156
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:50,797
<i>Wish I could be part of that world</i>

1157
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:55,089
<i>What would I give if I could live</i>

1158
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:58,968
<i>Out of these waters</i>

1159
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:02,971
<i>What would I pay to spend a day</i>

1160
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:06,680
<i>Warm on the sand</i>

1161
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:10,771
<i>Betcha on land they understand</i>

1162
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,775
<i>Bet they don't
reprimand their daughters</i>

1163
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:17,156
<i>Bright young women</i>

1164
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,733
<i>Sick of swimmin'</i>

1165
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:22,446
<i>Ready to stand</i>

1166
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:27,034
<i>And ready to know
what the people know</i>

1167
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:31,463
<i>Ask them my questions
and get some answers</i>

1168
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:35,755
<i>What's a fire and why does it
What's the word</i>

1169
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,419
<i>Burn</i>

1170
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:42,299
<i>When's it my turn
Wouldn't I love</i>

1171
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:47,558
<i>Love to explore that shore up above</i>

1172
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,895
<i>Out of the sea</i>

1173
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:54,894
<i>Wish I could be</i>

1174
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:59,278
<i>Part of that world</i>
