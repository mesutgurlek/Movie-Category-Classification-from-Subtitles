I would come down the mountain...

167
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:40,781
and climb a tree and look
over into your garden.

168
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:42,789
I'd see the sisters at work,

169
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:45,792
And I'd hear them sing
on their way to vespers...

170
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,795
which brings me to another
transgression, Reverend Mother.

171
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:52,094
I was singing out there today
without permission.

172
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,465
Maria, it is only here
in the abbey...

173
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,766
that we have rules about
postulants singing.

174
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:58,635
I can't seem to stop
singing wherever I am.

175
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,676
And what's worse, I can't
seem to stop saying things--

176
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:03,370
everything and anything
I think and feel.

177
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:05,743
Some people would
call that honesty.

178
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:07,645
But it's terrible,
Reverend Mother.

179
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,617
You know how Sister Berthe
always makes me kiss the floor...

180
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:12,619
after we've had a disagreement?

181
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:16,282
Lately I've taken to kissing
the floor when I see her coming

182
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:18,292
just to save time.

183
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,796
Maria, when you saw us
over the abbey wall

184
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:24,627
and longed to be one of us,

185
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,633
that didn't necessarily mean

186
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:27,725
that you were prepared

187
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:29,133
for the way we live here, did it?

188
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:33,737
No, Mother, but I pray, and I try,

189
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:35,639
and I am learning. I really am.

190
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,734
What is the most important lesson

191
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:37,743
you have learned here, my child?

192
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:40,212
To find out what
is the will of God

193
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:42,181
and to do it
wholeheartedly.

194
00:16:44,352 --> 00:16:46,149
Maria...

195
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:49,156
it seems to be the will of God

196
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:50,418
that you leave us.

197
00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:52,221
- Leave you?
- Only for a while, Maria.

198
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:55,228
Oh, no, please, Don't do that.
Don't send me away.

199
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:57,992
This is where I belong.
It's my home, my family.

200
00:16:58,066 --> 00:16:59,556
It's my life.

201
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:01,534
But are you truly ready for it?

202
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,298
Yes, I am.

203
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:05,464
Perhaps if you go
out into the world

204
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,564
for a time,

205
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:08,074
knowing what we
expect of you,

206
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:10,077
You will have
a chance to find out

207
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:11,373
if you could expect it
of yourself.

208
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:14,040
I know what you expect,
mother, and I can do it.

209
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:14,877
I promise I can.

210
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:15,881
Maria.

211
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:20,786
Yes, Mother...

212
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:25,058
If it is God's will.

213
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:29,187
there is a family near Salzburg

214
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:31,698
that needs a governess
until September.

215
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:32,698
September?

216
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,200
To take care of seven children.

217
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:35,896
Seven children!

218
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,403
Do you like children, Maria?

219
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:39,997
Well, yes, but seven!

220
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:42,407
I will tell Captain von Trapp

221
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:44,342
to expect you tomorrow.

222
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:46,175
Uh, Captain?

223
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:49,648
A retired officer of
the Imperial Navy.

224
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,184
a fine man and a brave one.

225
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:53,345
His wife died several years ago,

226
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:54,752
leaving him alone
with the children.

227
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,814
I understand he's had
a most difficult time

228
00:17:56,891 --> 00:17:59,257
managing to keep
a governess there.

229
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:02,387
Uh, why difficult,
Reverend Mother?

230
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:06,628
The Lord will show you
in his own good time.

231
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:46,168
When The Lord closes a door,

232
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:48,368
somewhere he opens a window.

The last time
he visited the baroness,

- he stayed for a month.
- Oh.

But if you ask me,

the Captain's thinking
very seriously

of marrying the woman
before the summer's over.

a mother again!

now I know why you've sent me here.

664

To help these children prepare
themselves for a new mother.

a happy family in thy sight.

What's his name?

Help her to know
that I'm her friend.

And help her to tell me
what she's been up to.

Are you going to tell on me?

guide her footsteps.

I was out taking a walk,

00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,082
and somebody locked the doors

earlier than usual,

wake everybody up.

You're not going to
tell Father, are you?

How in the world
did you climb up here?

689
00:46:56,908 --> 00:46:58,466
It's how we always
got into this room

to play tricks on the governess.

spiders in her hand.

Liesl, were you out
walking all by yourself?

00:47:18,162 --> 00:47:22,292
You know, if we wash
that dress out tonight,

nobody would
notice it tomorrow.

I didn't need a governess.

01:36:29,861 --> 01:36:30,828
They're extraordinary.

1624
01:36:30,895 --> 01:36:32,988
What they would do
at the festival!

1625
01:36:33,064 --> 01:36:36,227
Oh, young lady, I must
have words with you.

1626
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:39,360
Georg, you're not going
to let this girl get away.

1627
01:36:39,437 --> 01:36:40,768
She has to join the party.

1628
01:36:40,838 --> 01:36:41,827
No, really, I--

1629
01:36:41,906 --> 01:36:44,898
Shh. Stop it.
Georg, please.

1630
01:36:44,976 --> 01:36:46,500
You can if you
want to, fraulein.

1631
01:36:46,577 --> 01:36:48,704
I insist. You will be
my dinner partner.

1632
01:36:48,779 --> 01:36:50,041
This is business.

1633
01:36:50,114 --> 01:36:55,177
Franz, set another place
next to mine for Fraulein Maria.

1634
01:36:55,253 --> 01:36:57,346
Why...whatever you say,
Herr Detweiler.

1635
01:36:57,421 --> 01:36:59,685
Well, it appears
to be all arranged.

1636
01:36:59,757 --> 01:37:01,019
It certainly does.

1637
01:37:01,092 --> 01:37:02,286
I'm not
suitably dressed.

1638
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:04,920
Uh, well, you can change.
We'll wait for you.

1639
01:37:08,299 --> 01:37:11,234
Captain, you must be
very proud of your youngsters.

1640
01:37:11,302 --> 01:37:12,599
I am.
Thank you, baroness.

1641
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:14,604
Is there a more
beautiful expression

1642
01:37:14,672 --> 01:37:17,402
of what is good
in this country of ours

1643
01:37:17,475 --> 01:37:21,206
than the innocent voices
of our children?

1644
01:37:21,279 --> 01:37:23,645
Oh, come, now, baron,
would you have us believe

1645
01:37:23,714 --> 01:37:26,774
that Austria alone holds
a monopoly on virtue?

1646
01:37:26,851 --> 01:37:30,184
Herr Zeller,
some of us prefer

1647
01:37:30,254 --> 01:37:31,812
Austrian voices
raised in song

1648
01:37:31,889 --> 01:37:34,414
to ugly German threats.

1649
01:37:34,492 --> 01:37:39,088
The ostrich buries
his head in the sand

1650
01:37:39,163 --> 01:37:42,257
and sometimes... in the flag.

1651
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:43,857
Perhaps those
who would warn you

1652
01:37:43,935 --> 01:37:45,163
that the Anschluss is coming--

1653
01:37:45,236 --> 01:37:46,897
And it is coming, Captain--

1654
01:37:46,971 --> 01:37:48,598
Perhaps they would
get further with you

1655
01:37:48,673 --> 01:37:50,971
by setting their words to music.

1656
01:37:51,042 --> 01:37:52,703
If the Nazis take over Austria,

1657
01:37:52,777 --> 01:37:54,335
I have no doubt
that you will be

1658
01:37:54,412 --> 01:37:55,811
the entire trumpet section.

1659
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:57,177
You flatter me, Captain.

1660
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:59,739
Oh, how clumsy of me.

1661
01:37:59,817 --> 01:38:01,409
I meant to accuse you.

1662
01:38:09,727 --> 01:38:11,957
It's very kind of you to
offer to help me, baroness.

1663
01:38:12,029 --> 01:38:13,758
I'm delighted, Maria.

1664
01:38:13,831 --> 01:38:16,299
I really don't think
I do have anything

1665
01:38:16,367 --> 01:38:18,801
that would be appropriate.

1666
01:38:18,869 --> 01:38:20,962
Now, where is that
lovely little thing

1667
01:38:21,038 --> 01:38:23,006
you were wearing
the other evening

1668
01:38:23,074 --> 01:38:25,599
when the Captain couldn't
keep his eyes off you?

1669
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:32,808
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?

1670
01:38:32,883 --> 01:38:34,976
Come, my dear, we are women.

1671
01:38:35,052 --> 01:38:38,488
Let's not pretend we don't know
when a man notices us.

1672
01:38:38,556 --> 01:38:39,614
Here we are.

1673
01:38:39,690 --> 01:38:42,659
The Captain notices
everybody and everything.

1674
01:38:42,727 --> 01:38:45,195
There's no need to feel
so defensive, Maria.

1675
01:38:45,262 --> 01:38:47,890
You are quite attractive, you know.

1676
01:38:47,965 --> 01:38:49,523
The Captain would hardly be a man

1677
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,192
if he didn't notice you.

1678
01:38:51,268 --> 01:38:55,068
Baroness, I hope you're joking.

1679
01:38:55,139 --> 01:38:57,198
Not at all.

1680
01:38:57,274 --> 01:38:59,105
But I've never done a thing to--

1681
01:38:59,176 --> 01:39:01,144
But you don't have to, my dear.

1682
01:39:01,212 --> 01:39:03,680
There's nothing more
irresistible to a man

1683
01:39:03,748 --> 01:39:05,375
than a woman
who's in love with him.

1684
01:39:05,449 --> 01:39:08,680
In love with him?

1685
01:39:08,753 --> 01:39:09,981
Of course.

1686
01:39:10,054 --> 01:39:12,022
But what makes it so nice

1687
01:39:12,089 --> 01:39:14,717
is he thinks
he's in love with you.

1688
01:39:17,128 --> 01:39:18,993
But that's not true.

1689
01:39:19,063 --> 01:39:22,931
Surely you've noticed the way
he looks into your eyes.

1690
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,399
And, you know, uh...

1691
01:39:24,468 --> 01:39:28,461
you blushed in his arms
when you were dancing just now.

1692
01:39:28,539 --> 01:39:30,166
Don't take it to heart.

1693
01:39:30,241 --> 01:39:33,301
He'll get over it soon enough,
I should think.

1694
01:39:33,377 --> 01:39:34,639
Men do, you know.

1695
01:39:36,814 --> 01:39:37,838
Then I should go.

1696
01:39:37,915 --> 01:39:40,645
I mustn't stay here.

1697
01:39:50,828 --> 01:39:53,023
Is there something
I can do to help?

1698
01:39:53,097 --> 01:39:54,064
No, nothing.

1699
01:39:56,233 --> 01:39:57,564
Yes.

1700
01:39:57,635 --> 01:40:00,604
Please don't say a word
about this to the Captain.

1701
01:40:00,671 --> 01:40:05,108
No. no,
I wouldn't dream of it.

1702
01:40:11,949 --> 01:40:14,144
Good-bye, Maria.

1703
01:40:14,218 --> 01:40:17,415
I'm sure you'll make
a very fine nun.

1704
01:40:47,518 --> 01:40:49,986
Champagne, darling.

1705
01:40:50,054 --> 01:40:52,420
I feel
like celebrating.

1706
01:40:52,490 --> 01:40:54,390
Cheers.

1707
01:40:58,829 --> 01:41:00,820
You know something?

1708
01:41:00,898 --> 01:41:02,092
Perhaps.

1709
01:41:02,166 --> 01:41:03,565
Then if you're so clever,

1710
01:41:03,634 --> 01:41:05,158
tell me how to get
our little fraulein

1711
01:41:05,236 --> 01:41:07,431
to use her influence
with Georg.

1712
01:41:07,505 --> 01:41:10,338
I want those children
in the festival.

1713
01:41:10,407 --> 01:41:12,875
Elsa, this is important
to Austria.

1714
01:41:12,943 --> 01:41:15,036
It wouldn't do you
any harm, either.

1715
01:41:15,112 --> 01:41:16,739
I've thought of that.

1716
01:41:16,814 --> 01:41:19,374
Well, if it's a matter
of influence,

1717
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:23,079
maybe the one you have
to be talking to is me.

1718
01:42:57,563 --> 01:43:12,467

1719

Isn't this fun?

1735
01:45:11,196 --> 01:45:13,460
Um--

1736
01:45:13,532 --> 01:45:14,464
Four.

1737
01:45:14,533 --> 01:45:15,898
I'm number five.

1738
01:45:15,968 --> 01:45:17,595
Oh, yes.

1739
01:45:17,670 --> 01:45:18,602

Six !

1743
01:45:22,274 --> 01:45:23,206
Ohh!

1744
01:45:24,743 --> 01:45:25,835
Two.

1745
01:45:25,911 --> 01:45:29,745
Baroness Schraeder,
do you mind if we stop now?

1746
01:45:29,815 --> 01:45:30,839
We're tired.

1747
01:45:30,916 --> 01:45:33,111
Oh, whatever
you want, dear.

1748
01:45:33,185 --> 01:45:34,846
We'll do it
again tomorrow.

1749
01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:47,494
The country's
so restful, isn't it?

1750
01:45:47,566 --> 01:45:49,625
Have some lemonade.

1751
01:45:49,702 --> 01:45:52,796
Oh, there must be
an easier way.

1752
01:45:52,871 --> 01:45:55,305
I get a fiendish delight

1753
01:45:55,374 --> 01:45:57,501
thinking of you
as the mother of seven.

1754
01:45:57,576 --> 01:46:00,306
How do you plan to do it?

1755
01:46:00,379 --> 01:46:02,313
Darling, haven't you
ever heard

1756
01:46:02,381 --> 01:46:03,973
of a delightful
little thing

1757
01:46:04,049 --> 01:46:05,983
called
boarding school?

1758
01:46:06,051 --> 01:46:08,417
Baroness Machiavelli.

1759
01:46:08,487 --> 01:46:09,784
Mm-hmm.

1760
01:46:09,855 --> 01:46:12,585
Uncle Max,
where's father?

1761
01:46:12,658 --> 01:46:14,489
I think
he's in the house.

1762
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:17,120
What's the matter
with all you gloomy pusses?

1763
01:46:17,196 --> 01:46:18,493
Nothing.

1764
01:46:18,564 --> 01:46:20,464
I know what we'll do.
Let's have a rehearsal.

1765
01:46:20,532 --> 01:46:21,590
What for?

1766
01:46:21,667 --> 01:46:23,157
Let's make believe we're
standing on the stage

1767
01:46:23,235 --> 01:46:24,327
at the festival.

1768
01:46:24,403 --> 01:46:25,961
I don't feel
like singing.

1769
01:46:26,038 --> 01:46:28,370
Not without
Fraulein Maria.

1770
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:30,931
Liesl, get the guitar.
Come on, Marta.

1771
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:33,103
Everybody into the group.
You know your places.

1772
01:46:33,178 --> 01:46:34,406
Get in your places.
That's right.

1773
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,414
Be cheerful.
Give us the key, Liesl.

1774
01:46:38,917 --> 01:46:41,385
Now, impress me.

1775
01:46:41,453 --> 01:46:42,977
* Ah *

1776
01:46:43,055 --> 01:46:44,022
* Ah *

1777
01:46:44,089 --> 01:46:45,386
* Ah *

1778
01:46:45,457 --> 01:46:47,220
Friedrich, Gretl,
why don't you sing?

1779
01:46:47,292 --> 01:46:49,954
I can't. I've got
a sore finger.

1780
01:46:50,029 --> 01:46:52,122
But you sang
so beautifully

1781
01:46:52,197 --> 01:46:53,960
the night
of the party.

1782
01:46:54,033 --> 01:46:56,627
Come on, all of you.
Try something you know.

Didn't I tell you
what her note said?

1815

Oh, I'm sure I did.

her life at the abbey

too much.

1818

She had to leave us.

there is to it.

to try some of that.

the same thing.

is how God wants you
to spend your love.

my life to God.

02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:19,795
Only until arrangements

2105
02:03:19,872 --> 02:03:21,840
can be made for
another governess.

2106
02:04:17,263 --> 02:04:18,958
There you are!

2107
02:04:32,712 --> 02:04:35,146
I really must
speak to Cook

2108
02:04:35,214 --> 02:04:36,738
about the wiener
schnitzel.

2109
02:04:36,816 --> 02:04:39,444
It is entirely too delicious
for my figure.

2110
02:04:39,518 --> 02:04:41,782
And it makes you
much too quiet

2111
02:04:41,854 --> 02:04:44,084
at the dinner table,

2112
02:04:44,156 --> 02:04:46,090
or was it the wine?

2113
02:04:46,158 --> 02:04:47,557
Oh, undoubtedly
the wine.

2114
02:04:47,627 --> 02:04:51,256
You have no idea what kind
of trouble I'm having

2115
02:04:51,330 --> 02:04:53,594
trying to decide
what to give you

2116
02:04:53,666 --> 02:04:55,429
for a wedding present.

2117
02:04:55,501 --> 02:04:57,093
Oh, I know,
I'm enough,

2118
02:04:57,169 --> 02:04:59,433
but I do want you to have

2119
02:04:59,505 --> 02:05:01,837
some little trifle
for the occasion.

2120
02:05:01,907 --> 02:05:04,569
At first, I thought
of a fountain pen,

2121
02:05:04,644 --> 02:05:06,544
but you've
already got one.

2122
02:05:06,612 --> 02:05:10,343
And then I thought perhaps
a villa in the south of France,

2123
02:05:10,416 --> 02:05:13,010
but they are so difficult
to gift-wrap.

2124
02:05:13,085 --> 02:05:15,610
Georg, how do you feel
about yachts?

2125
02:05:15,688 --> 02:05:18,623
A long, sleek one
for the Mediterranean,

2126
02:05:18,691 --> 02:05:21,922
or a tiny one
for your bathtub, hmm?

2127
02:05:21,994 --> 02:05:23,120
Elsa.

2128
02:05:23,195 --> 02:05:25,755
And where to go
on our honeymoon?

2129
02:05:25,831 --> 02:05:27,628
Now, that is
a real problem.

2130
02:05:27,700 --> 02:05:30,726
I thought a trip around
the world would be lovely.

2131
02:05:30,803 --> 02:05:32,236
Then I said,
''Oh, Elsa,

2132
02:05:32,305 --> 02:05:34,296
there must be someplace
better to go.''

2133
02:05:34,373 --> 02:05:35,670
Don't worry, darling.
I--

2134
02:05:35,741 --> 02:05:37,003
Elsa.

2135
02:05:37,076 --> 02:05:38,668
Yes, Georg?

2136
02:05:38,744 --> 02:05:41,042
It's no use.

2137
02:05:41,113 --> 02:05:44,549
You and I.

2138
02:05:44,617 --> 02:05:48,713
I've been dishonest
to both of us

2139
02:05:48,788 --> 02:05:51,382
and utterly
unfair to you.

2140
02:05:55,294 --> 02:05:58,229
When two people
talk of marriage--

2141
02:05:58,297 --> 02:05:59,457
No, don't.

2142
02:05:59,532 --> 02:06:02,296
Don't say another word,
Georg, please.

2143
02:06:04,403 --> 02:06:06,667
You see, um...

2144
02:06:06,739 --> 02:06:10,175
there are other things
I've been thinking of.

2145
02:06:10,242 --> 02:06:13,769
Fond as I am of you,

2146
02:06:13,846 --> 02:06:16,406
I really don't think
you're the right man for me.

2147
02:06:16,482 --> 02:06:18,677
You're, um--

2148
02:06:18,751 --> 02:06:20,241
You're much too
independent.

2149
02:06:20,319 --> 02:06:25,188
And I--I need someone
who needs me desperately,

2150
02:06:25,257 --> 02:06:28,658
or at least needs
my money desperately.

2151
02:06:30,863 --> 02:06:33,696
I've enjoyed every moment
we've had together.

2152
02:06:33,766 --> 02:06:35,893
I do thank you for that.

2153
02:06:37,236 --> 02:06:41,468
Now, if, um,
if you'll forgive me,

2154
02:06:41,540 --> 02:06:43,804
I'll go inside,
pack my little bags,

2155
02:06:43,876 --> 02:06:46,436
and return to Vienna,
where I belong.

2156
02:06:50,716 --> 02:06:54,152
And somewhere out there
is a young lady

2157
02:06:54,220 --> 02:06:55,653
who I think...

2158
02:06:57,723 --> 02:07:00,018
will never be a nun.

2159
02:07:10,729 --> 02:07:13,323
Auf wiedersehen,
darling.

2160
02:07:39,758 --> 02:07:41,350
Hello.

2161
02:07:46,197 --> 02:07:50,463
I thought I just might
find you here.

2162
02:07:53,705 --> 02:07:56,071
Was there something
you wanted?

2163
02:07:56,141 --> 02:07:57,506
Hmm?

2164
02:07:57,575 --> 02:07:59,509
No, no, no.
Sit down. please.

2165
02:08:00,712 --> 02:08:02,145
Please.

2166
02:08:07,218 --> 02:08:09,152
Uh, may I?

2167
02:08:19,497 --> 02:08:21,658
You know, I was...

2168
02:08:21,733 --> 02:08:23,667
I was thinking

2169
02:08:23,735 --> 02:08:27,171
and I was wondering
two things.

2170
02:08:27,238 --> 02:08:32,175
Why did you
run away to the abbey?

2171
02:08:32,243 --> 02:08:33,676
And...

2172
02:08:33,745 --> 02:08:37,442
what was it
that made you come back?

2173
02:08:37,515 --> 02:08:39,210
Well, I...

2174
02:08:39,284 --> 02:08:41,184
had an obligation
to fulfill,

2175
02:08:41,252 --> 02:08:43,015
and I...

2176
02:08:43,087 --> 02:08:45,021
I came back
to fulfill it.

2177
02:08:45,089 --> 02:08:47,182
Is that all?

2178
02:08:48,693 --> 02:08:50,752
And I missed
the children.

2179
02:08:50,829 --> 02:08:52,126
Yes.

2180
02:08:53,531 --> 02:08:54,998
Only the children?

2181
02:08:55,066 --> 02:08:56,158
No. Yes!

2182
02:08:56,234 --> 02:08:58,634
Isn't it right I should
have missed them?

2183
02:08:58,703 --> 02:09:00,637
Oh, yes!
Yes, of course!

2184
02:09:00,705 --> 02:09:03,640
I was only hoping
that perhaps you...

2185
02:09:03,708 --> 02:09:06,905
Perhaps
you might, uh...

2186
02:09:06,978 --> 02:09:09,003
Yes?

2187
02:09:10,715 --> 02:09:12,148
Well, uh...

2188
02:09:12,217 --> 02:09:16,654
Nothing was the same
when you were away and...

2189
02:09:16,721 --> 02:09:20,885
it'll be all wrong again
after you leave.

2190
02:09:20,959 --> 02:09:23,655
And I just thought
perhaps you might, uh...

2191
02:09:23,728 --> 02:09:25,923
change your mind?

2192
02:09:29,801 --> 02:09:31,428
I'm sure the baroness

2193
02:09:31,502 --> 02:09:34,266
will be able to make
things fine for you.

2194
02:09:34,339 --> 02:09:35,431
Maria,

2195
02:09:36,741 --> 02:09:40,233
there isn't going
to be any baroness.

2196
02:09:40,311 --> 02:09:42,472
There isn't?

2197
02:09:42,547 --> 02:09:44,674
No.

2198
02:09:44,749 --> 02:09:46,683
I don't
understand.

2199
02:09:48,253 --> 02:09:52,690
Well, we've, um, called off
our engagement, you see, and--

2200
02:09:52,757 --> 02:09:54,691
Oh, I'm sorry.

2201
02:09:54,759 --> 02:09:55,726
Yes.

2202
02:09:55,793 --> 02:09:56,782
You are?

2203
02:09:56,861 --> 02:09:58,294
Mm-hmm.

2204
02:09:58,363 --> 02:09:59,295
You did?

2205
02:09:59,364 --> 02:10:00,331
Yes.

2206
02:10:01,699 --> 02:10:05,965
Well, you can't marry
someone when you're...

2207
02:10:08,339 --> 02:10:10,637
in love with
someone else.

2208
02:10:13,544 --> 02:10:15,102
Can you?

2209
02:10:50,214 --> 02:10:52,239
The Reverend Mother
always says,

2210
02:10:52,317 --> 02:10:54,251
''When The Lord
closes a door,

2211
02:10:54,319 --> 02:10:56,446
somewhere
he opens a window.''

2212
02:11:04,028 --> 02:11:07,464
What else does the
Reverend Mother say?

2213
02:11:07,532 --> 02:11:11,468
That you have to look
for your life.

2214
02:11:11,536 --> 02:11:14,471
Is that why
you came back?

2215
02:11:18,543 --> 02:11:21,273
And have you
found it...

2216
02:11:21,346 --> 02:11:22,472
Maria?

2217
02:11:24,549 --> 02:11:26,483
I think I have.

2218
02:11:29,053 --> 02:11:30,918
I know I have.

2219
02:11:33,057 --> 02:11:35,321
I love you.

2220
02:11:44,202 --> 02:11:51,165
* Perhaps I had
a wicked childhood *

2221
02:11:51,242 --> 02:11:58,546
* Perhaps I had
a miserable youth *

2222
02:11:58,616 --> 02:12:04,885
* But somewhere in my wicked,
miserable past *

2223
02:12:04,956 --> 02:12:11,486
* There must have been
a moment of truth *

2224
02:12:11,562 --> 02:12:13,359
* For here you are *

2225
02:12:13,431 --> 02:12:15,194
* Standing there *

2226
02:12:15,266 --> 02:12:19,066
* Loving me *

2227
02:12:19,137 --> 02:12:22,106
* Whether or not *

2228
02:12:22,173 --> 02:12:25,700
* You should *

2229
02:12:25,777 --> 02:12:29,474
* So somewhere
in my youth *

2230
02:12:29,547 --> 02:12:33,347
* Or childhood *

2231
02:12:33,418 --> 02:12:42,224
* I must have done
something good *

2232
02:12:42,293 --> 02:12:46,593
* Nothing comes
from nothing *

2233
02:12:46,664 --> 02:12:51,067
* Nothing ever could *

2234
02:12:51,135 --> 02:12:55,731
* So somewhere
in my youth *

2235
02:12:55,807 --> 02:13:01,507
* Or childhood *

2236
02:13:01,579 --> 02:13:04,605
* I must have done *

2237
02:13:04,682 --> 02:13:08,743
* Something *

2238
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:11,311
* Good **

2239
02:13:11,389 --> 02:13:15,621
Do you know when I first
started loving you?

2240
02:13:15,693 --> 02:13:17,627
That night
at the dinner table

2241
02:13:17,695 --> 02:13:20,289
when you sat on that
ridiculous pine cone.

2242
02:13:20,364 --> 02:13:21,626
[ Laughing ]

2243
02:13:21,699 --> 02:13:23,132
What? [ Laughs ]

2244
02:13:23,201 --> 02:13:28,298
I knew the first time
you blew that silly whistle.

2245
02:13:34,378 --> 02:13:36,642
* For here you are *

2246
02:13:36,714 --> 02:13:38,648
* Standing there *

2247
02:13:38,716 --> 02:13:44,086
* Loving me *

2248
02:13:44,155 --> 02:13:47,420
* Whether or not *

2249
02:13:47,492 --> 02:13:51,087
* You should *

2250
02:13:51,162 --> 02:13:54,996
* So somewhere
in my youth *

2251
02:13:55,066 --> 02:13:58,593
* Or childhood *

2252
02:13:58,669 --> 02:14:01,001
* I must have done *

2253
02:14:01,072 --> 02:14:03,939
* Something *

2254
02:14:04,008 --> 02:14:07,054
* Good *

2255
02:14:07,187 --> 02:14:12,056
* Nothing comes
from nothing *

2256
02:14:12,126 --> 02:14:15,562

2263
02:14:54,101 --> 02:14:55,534
Maria.

2264
02:14:57,104 --> 02:15:00,540
Is there anyone
I should go to

2265
02:15:00,607 --> 02:15:03,542
to ask permission
to marry you?

2266
02:15:05,112 --> 02:15:07,546
Well, why don't

well, it will be
a reflection on Austria.

2425
02:25:22,495 --> 02:25:26,932
Oh, I know. It wouldn't
do me any good, either.

2426
02:25:32,038 --> 02:25:33,528
- Mother?
- Hmm?

2427
02:25:33,606 --> 02:25:36,166
That sounds so nice.
I like calling you Mother.

2428
02:25:36,242 --> 02:25:37,971
I like hearing it.

2429
02:25:38,044 --> 02:25:42,708
- You love Father very much,
I can tell you do.
- Very much.

2430
02:25:42,782 --> 02:25:46,445
Mother, what do you do when you
think you love someone--

2431
02:25:46,519 --> 02:25:49,818
I mean, when you stop
loving someone,

2432
02:25:49,889 --> 02:25:52,323
or he stops loving you?

2433
02:25:53,893 --> 02:25:56,327
Well, you
cry a little.

2434
02:25:56,396 --> 02:25:59,422
And then you wait
for the sun to come out.

2435
02:25:59,499 --> 02:26:00,830
It always does.

2436
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:03,960
There's so many things
I think I should know,

2437
02:26:04,037 --> 02:26:05,937
but I don't.
I really don't.

2438
02:26:06,005 --> 02:26:07,302
How can you?

2439
02:26:07,373 --> 02:26:09,739
Sometimes I feel the world
is coming to an end.

2440
02:26:09,809 --> 02:26:11,902
And then you feel
it's just beginning?

2441
02:26:11,978 --> 02:26:13,070
Yes.

2442
02:26:13,146 --> 02:26:14,545
It was that way
with me, Liesl.

2443
02:26:14,614 --> 02:26:17,674
And for you, it will be
just as wonderful, I promise.

2444
02:26:17,750 --> 02:26:20,218
Do you really
think so?

2445
02:26:20,386 --> 02:26:23,150
* When you're 1 6 *

2446
02:26:23,223 --> 02:26:25,157
* Going on 1 7 *

2447
02:26:25,225 --> 02:26:28,922
* Waiting for life
to start *

2448
02:26:28,995 --> 02:26:31,156

2449
02:26:31,231 --> 02:26:33,461
* Who touches
your mind *

2450
02:26:33,533 --> 02:26:38,163
* Will suddenly
touch your heart *

2451
02:26:38,238 --> 02:26:40,172
* When that happens *

2452
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:42,674
* After it happens *

2453
02:26:42,742 --> 02:26:46,769
* Nothing is quite
the same *

2454
02:26:46,846 --> 02:26:50,782
* Somehow I know
I'll jump up and go *

2455
02:26:50,850 --> 02:26:55,287
* If ever
he calls my name *

2456
02:26:55,355 --> 02:26:59,621
* Gone are your
old ideas of life *

2457
02:26:59,692 --> 02:27:03,958
* The old ideas

2458
02:27:04,030 --> 02:27:05,691
* Lo and behold *

* You may think
this kind of adventure *

2462
02:27:20,213 --> 02:27:24,274
* Never may come
to you *

2463
02:27:24,350 --> 02:27:30,846
* Darling 1 6,
going on 1 7 *

2464
02:27:30,924 --> 02:27:36,692
* Wait a year
or two *

2465
02:27:36,763 --> 02:27:41,723
* I'll wait a year *

2466
02:27:41,801 --> 02:27:50,106
*Just wait a year *

2467
02:27:50,176 --> 02:27:51,768
* Or *

2468
02:27:51,844 --> 02:27:58,773
* Two *

2469
02:28:00,853 --> 02:28:02,150
Liesl.

2470
02:28:18,371 --> 02:28:20,305
What is it?

2471
02:28:20,373 --> 02:28:21,806
Berlin.

2472
02:28:21,874 --> 02:28:25,810
They've offered me
a commission in their navy.

2473
02:28:25,878 --> 02:28:28,210
I've been
requested
to accept immediately

2474
02:28:28,281 --> 02:28:32,217
and report to their naval base
at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

2475
02:28:32,285 --> 02:28:34,549
I knew something
like this would happen,

2476
02:28:34,621 --> 02:28:35,815
but I didn't think
it would be so soon.

2477
02:28:35,888 --> 02:28:40,825
To refuse them would be
fatal for all of us,

2478
02:28:40,893 --> 02:28:45,091
and joining them
would be... unthinkable.

2479
02:28:50,103 --> 02:28:52,765
Get the children
all together.

2480
02:28:52,839 --> 02:28:53,931
Don't say anything

2481
02:28:54,007 --> 02:28:55,941
that's going
to make them worry.

2482
02:28:56,009 --> 02:28:57,909
Just get them ready.

2483
02:28:57,977 --> 02:29:00,241
We've got to get out
of Austria...

2484
02:29:01,948 --> 02:29:03,381
and this house...

2485
02:29:06,152 --> 02:29:07,278
tonight.

2486
02:29:51,397 --> 02:29:53,831
It strains my back,
it breaks my heart

2487
02:29:53,900 --> 02:29:55,390
when I think of
a certain singing group

2488
02:29:55,468 --> 02:29:57,231
that will not appear
at the festival tonight.

2489
02:29:57,303 --> 02:29:58,463
By the time you've
made the announcement,

2490
02:29:58,538 --> 02:29:59,903
we'll be over the border.

2491
02:29:59,972 --> 02:30:02,702
I hope you appreciate
the sacrifice I'm making.

2492
02:30:02,775 --> 02:30:04,174
You have no choice.

2493
02:30:04,243 --> 02:30:07,303
I know. That's why
I'm making it.

2494
02:30:07,380 --> 02:30:10,247
Why doesn't Father
turn the motor on?

2495
02:30:10,316 --> 02:30:12,944
Because he doesn't want
anyone to hear us!

2496
02:30:13,019 --> 02:30:14,281
Shh!

2497
02:30:16,589 --> 02:30:18,489
What will Frau Schmidt
and Franz say

2498
02:30:18,558 --> 02:30:19,855
when they discover
we're gone?

2499
02:30:19,926 --> 02:30:21,393
They'll be able to
answer truthfully.

2500
02:30:21,461 --> 02:30:23,725
They didn't know anything
about it if anyone asks them.

2501
02:30:23,796 --> 02:30:25,730
Will we be coming
back here?

2502
02:30:25,798 --> 02:30:28,130
Someday, Liesl.
I do hope someday.

2503
02:30:28,201 --> 02:30:30,863
Are Father and Uncle Max
going to push the car

2504
02:30:30,937 --> 02:30:32,302
all the way to Switzerland?

2505
02:30:32,372 --> 02:30:33,304
Shh!

2506
02:30:59,332 --> 02:31:01,800
Something wrong
with your car, Captain?

2507
02:31:01,868 --> 02:31:03,358
Yes, as a matter
of fact,

2508
02:31:03,436 --> 02:31:05,370
We couldn't
get it started.

2509
02:31:07,874 --> 02:31:09,307
Kobb.

2510
02:31:11,377 --> 02:31:13,811
Fix Captain
von Trapp's car

2511
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:16,246
so that
it will start.

2512
02:31:23,890 --> 02:31:25,824
[ Car Engine Starts ]

2513
02:31:37,737 --> 02:31:39,204
Excellent, Kobb.

2514
02:31:42,909 --> 02:31:44,376
I've not asked you

2515
02:31:44,444 --> 02:31:47,538
where you and your
family are going.

2516
02:31:47,613 --> 02:31:49,171
Nor have you asked me
why I'm here.

2517
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:50,681
Well, apparently,
we're both suffering

2518
02:31:50,750 --> 02:31:52,877
from a deplorable
lack of curiosity.

2519
02:31:52,952 --> 02:31:57,286
You were sent a telegram,
which you did not answer,

2520
02:31:57,356 --> 02:32:00,450
from the navy
of the Third Reich.

2521
02:32:00,526 --> 02:32:02,517
I was under
the impression,

2522
02:32:02,595 --> 02:32:03,789
Herr Zeller,

2523
02:32:03,863 --> 02:32:06,093
that the contents of
telegrams in Austria

2524
02:32:06,165 --> 02:32:08,292
are private!

2525
02:32:08,367 --> 02:32:11,336
At least
the Austria I know.

2526
02:32:11,404 --> 02:32:13,235
I have my orders.

2527
02:32:13,306 --> 02:32:15,331
And they are to take you
personally

2528
02:32:15,408 --> 02:32:16,340
to Bremerhaven tonight

2529
02:32:16,409 --> 02:32:18,001
where you will accept
your commission.

2530
02:32:19,312 --> 02:32:21,246
I'm afraid that's...

2531
02:32:21,314 --> 02:32:25,751
going to be
quite impossible.

2532
02:32:25,818 --> 02:32:28,719
You see, we, uh...
all of us--

2533
02:32:28,788 --> 02:32:30,847
The entire family
will be...

2534
02:32:30,923 --> 02:32:33,391
singing in
the festival tonight.

2535
02:32:33,459 --> 02:32:35,120
As a matter of fact,

2536
02:32:35,194 --> 02:32:37,560
that's where
we were going now.

2537
02:32:37,630 --> 02:32:39,757
Couldn't possibly
let them down now.

2538
02:32:39,832 --> 02:32:41,959
I just hope
we're not too late.

2539
02:32:42,034 --> 02:32:43,763
Yes.

2540
02:32:43,836 --> 02:32:47,067
And you ask me to believe
that you, Captain von Trapp,

2541
02:32:47,139 --> 02:32:48,629
are singing
in a concert?

2542
02:32:48,708 --> 02:32:50,403
Believe me,
it will be a performance

2543
02:32:50,476 --> 02:32:52,467
beyond anything
even I've dreamt of.

2544
02:32:52,545 --> 02:32:54,740
Like you,
Herr Zeller,

2545
02:32:54,814 --> 02:32:58,215
I, too, am a man
of hidden talents.

2546
02:32:58,284 --> 02:33:01,412
Yes, um... here.

2547
02:33:01,487 --> 02:33:02,931
Program.

2548
02:33:06,601 --> 02:33:09,570
It says here only the names
of the children.

2549
02:33:09,638 --> 02:33:12,937
It says The von Trapp
Family Singers,

2550
02:33:13,008 --> 02:33:15,943
and I'm the head
of the von Trapp family,

2551
02:33:16,011 --> 02:33:17,000
am I not?

2552
02:33:19,180 --> 02:33:23,116
And these, um, travel clothes
that you're all wearing?

2553
02:33:23,184 --> 02:33:24,276
Our costumes,
naturally.

2554
02:33:24,352 --> 02:33:26,820
Herr Zeller,
this night air is not good

2555
02:33:26,888 --> 02:33:28,116
for the children's voices.

2556
02:33:34,229 --> 02:33:37,164
Well, a slight delay
in my orders

2557
02:33:37,232 --> 02:33:39,166
will not be serious.

2558
02:33:39,234 --> 02:33:41,168
Therefore...

2559
02:33:41,236 --> 02:33:43,431
you will sing.

2560
02:33:43,505 --> 02:33:45,496
You will all sing,

2561
02:33:45,573 --> 02:33:49,304
But only because that's
the way I want it to be.

2562
02:33:49,377 --> 02:33:53,313
It will demonstrate that nothing
in Austria has changed.

2563
02:33:53,381 --> 02:33:56,214
And when you
are finished singing,

2564
02:33:56,284 --> 02:34:01,813
you, Captain von Trapp,
will be taken to Bremerhaven.

2565
02:34:01,890 --> 02:34:04,757
Now, if you will all
get into your car,

2566
02:34:04,826 --> 02:34:07,317
we will escort
the von Trapp family singers

2567
02:34:07,395 --> 02:34:08,794
to the festival.

2568
02:34:08,863 --> 02:34:11,889
No escort will be
necessary, Herr Zeller.

2569
02:34:11,966 --> 02:34:12,990
Necessary?

2570
02:34:13,068 --> 02:34:14,592
Apleasure, Captain.

2571
02:34:14,669 --> 02:34:16,796
After all,
we would not want you

2572
02:34:16,871 --> 02:34:19,635
to get lost
in the crowds,

2573
02:34:19,708 --> 02:34:21,232
would we?

2574
02:34:21,309 --> 02:34:23,209
No.

2575
02:34:39,894 --> 02:34:42,089
* Sew, a needle
pulling thread *

2576
02:34:42,163 --> 02:34:43,323
* A needle
pulling thread *

2577
02:34:43,398 --> 02:34:45,161
* La, a note to follow sew *

2578
02:34:45,233 --> 02:34:46,598
* A note to follow sew *

2579
02:34:46,668 --> 02:34:48,932
* Tea, a drink
with jam and bread *

2580
02:34:49,003 --> 02:34:50,470
* A drink with
jam and bread *

2581
02:34:50,538 --> 02:34:52,597
* A drink with

02:50:48,235 --> 02:50:50,703
You don't really
belong to them.

2745
02:50:50,771 --> 02:50:52,534
Stay where you are!

2746
02:50:52,607 --> 02:50:56,202
Come away with us

2747
02:50:56,277 --> 02:50:58,677
before
it's too late.

2748
02:50:58,746 --> 02:51:00,145
Not another step.

2749
02:51:00,214 --> 02:51:01,579
I'll kill you!

2750
02:51:03,217 --> 02:51:05,651
You give that
to me, Rolfe.

2751
02:51:05,720 --> 02:51:07,119
Did you hear me?

2752
02:51:07,188 --> 02:51:09,315
I'll kill you!

2753
02:51:10,758 --> 02:51:12,749
Rolfe

2754
02:51:30,244 --> 02:51:32,712
You'll never
be one of them.

2755
02:51:35,216 --> 02:51:37,343
Lieutenant!

2756
02:51:37,418 --> 02:51:38,646
Lieutenant,
they're here!

2757
02:51:38,719 --> 02:51:40,311
They're here,
Lieutenant!

Reverend Mother.

2762
02:52:24,598 --> 02:52:27,192
I have sinned.

2763
02:52:27,268 --> 02:52:30,704
I, too,
Reverend Mother.

2764
02:52:30,771 --> 02:52:33,706
What is this sin,
my children?

2765
02:53:00,301 --> 02:53:03,566
* A dream that will need *

2766
