of your rafters

161
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:10,201
so I could hang myself?

162
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:11,635
I just did a test run
back in my office,

163
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:13,938
and you know what?
There's asbestos up there,

164
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:15,806
and that can
kill a person.

165
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:18,476
Sue? Sit.

166
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:20,911
Now, I understand
you're upset,

167
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:23,981
but life is beautiful.

168
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:25,249
Are you going to tell me
there hasn't been

169
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:27,518
one moment since
your epic decline

170
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:29,253
that you haven't
felt yourself

171
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:30,688
feel good about something?

172
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:33,390
Well, yes, Will,

173
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,226
as a matter of fact,
there was...

174
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:37,194
there was one moment.

175
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:40,331
I was driving to work
this morning in my LeCar,

176
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:43,901
and Charlene's "I've Never
Been To Me" came on the radio.

177
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,536
And when it got to the chorus,

178
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:48,405
I just opened my mouth and
belted it out with her.

179
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:50,608
And I have to say,
it felt really good.

180
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,676
Sue should join
the Glee Club.

181
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:53,844
I'm sorry?

182
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,479
No, I'd rather be dead.

183
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:57,047
Yes. She should join--
I mean, you can't join,

184
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:58,182
but she can sit in.

185
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,416
Yes. Will.

186
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:02,286
Look, Sue is in a really
bad place right now.

187
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:05,456
And you're always talking about
the healing power of music.

188
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:07,158
There are studies that show
it helps with depression,

189
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:08,559
it elevates mood.

190
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:09,660
I have a pamphlet.

191
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:15,599
Uh... Emma, I don't think
this is a good idea at all.

192
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,468
I agree with
SpongeHair SquareChin.

193
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:19,403
It's a stupid idea.

194
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:20,971
No, no. The football team
did it for a spell,

195
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,073
and that really
brought people together.

196
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:25,609
Will, and this is
a great chance

197
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:26,977
for you to keep
your eye on Sue.

198
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:29,013
You know, make sure
the old gal's okay.

199
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:32,883
Well, you know what, folks?
At this point,

200
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,119
to alleviate
my crippling depression,

201
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:37,354
I'd do anything.

202
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:40,191
[chuckles]

203
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:41,725
This cannot be happening.

204
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:43,360
This seems like a terrible idea.

205
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:46,130
Guys, it's not up
for discussion, okay?

206
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:48,299
Now, it's no secret that Coach
Sylvester has taken her licks...

207
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:49,967
I mean, just wanky.

208
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:52,536
And I believe she could use
a little sympathy from us.

209
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:54,805
Sympathy? From us? Uh-uh.

210
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:56,907
Yeah, all she's ever done
is make our lives miserable.

211
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,676
She got exactly
what she deserved.

212
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:00,811
You're lucky I left my blowgun
at home, Airbags,

213
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,680
'cause I got a clear shot
at your nonnies.

214
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:05,850
WILL: Guys, Coach Sylvester
has had her recent setbacks,

215
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,918
but she is a proven champion.

216
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:09,386
Now, we could do worse

217
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:11,388
than to have that kindf
a winning record in our midst.

218
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:12,489
SUE: Let me break it
down for you.

219
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:15,059
I am no longer a threat
to you people.

220
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:17,695
All right? I'm just hoping that
your singing and dancing around

221
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:20,364
will pull me out of
my doldrums and give me

222
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:22,967
a reason to live.
Is that too much to ask?

223
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:25,202
Guys, it's settled.

224
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,570
Sue's going to be
with us for the week.

225
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:29,673
Now... I received an envelope
in the mail today.

226
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:31,141
[murmuring]

227
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:32,843
We know that we're facing Kurt
and the Warblers at Regionals.

228
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:33,944
Sweet Porcelain.

229
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,546
And it looks like this year,

230
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,514
we face Aural Intensity again.

231
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,583
They cleaned our clock
last year.

232
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:40,818
Seems like
the governing board

233
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:43,621
has assigned a theme
to this year's Regionals,

234
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,022
and part of our score
will be based

235
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,458
upon how well we interpret it.
This year's theme--

236
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:50,628
"Anthem." Now, who can
tell us what an anthem is?

237
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:52,029
The bottom of an ant's pants.

238
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:54,131
So close.
So close. No.

239
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:56,333
An anthem is an epic song,

240
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:58,702
filled with
a groundswell of emotion

241
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,237
that somehow seems
bigger than itself.

242
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:02,673
Even bigger than the person
performing it.
Mr. Shue?

243
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,575
Oh, hey, Sam, I didn't even
notice your new haircut.

244
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:06,944
Yeah. I've been working
on a new image to go

245
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,545
with my new one-man band,
The Justin Bieber Experience.

246
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:10,814
You've got to be kidding me.

247
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:13,150
Dude. That haircut makes
your mouth look even bigger.

248
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:15,085
Let her speak.

249
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:16,720
Look, laugh all you want,
but that kid's an epic talent,

250
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:17,922
and there's a number
I've been working on

251
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:19,456
that I've been wanting
to show off.

252
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:21,358
And I think it
qualifies as an anthem,

253
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:24,094
because it's
just hugely emotional,

254
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:25,763
and sums up
our generation.

255
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,098
All right.
Let's hear it, buddy.

00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:12,993
Are you playing
Angry Birds?

319
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:14,194
Sorry.

320
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:15,996
Want me to show
you my abs?

321
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:17,231
If you want to.

322
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:22,770
Here's what happens
to the female chemistry.

323
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:24,638
They get a huge shot
of endorphins

324
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:26,340
on Valentine's Day,
and everything is heightened

325
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:27,875
and so romantic--
the problem is,

326
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:30,477
days later, when they come down
from their See's candy high,

327
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:32,012
they crash,
and everything else,

328
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,514
by comparison, is humdrum.

329
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,349
We need the sugary sweet jolt
of the Biebes

330
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,750
to get us some action again.

331
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:38,318
Why do you want in, Puckerman?

332
00:12:38,386 --> 00:12:40,287
I'm at the end
of my Lauren Zises rope.

333
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:42,189
I'll try anything to get
into those enormous pants.

334
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:44,124
Uh, what's going on?

335
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:45,192
ARTIE:
We're joining

336
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,727
The Justin Bieber Experience,

337
00:12:46,795 --> 00:12:48,629
if Sam's cool with it.

338
00:12:48,696 --> 00:12:49,997
And if not, we're
starting our own band.

339
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:51,532
Bieber Fever.

340
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:53,467
Wait, you-you guys
do realize that

341
00:12:53,535 --> 00:12:55,569
Justin Bieber sucks, right?

342
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:57,671
Quinn seemed to be
pretty into him when I
was singing in Glee Club.

343
00:12:57,739 --> 00:12:59,173
Right, well,
I'm gonna spend my time

344
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,908
working on songs that aren't
geared toward 12-year-olds.

345
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:02,309
Good.
And then you won't

346
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:03,977
have time to pick up any
other guys' girlfriends.

347
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:05,379
Hey... back off, man.

348
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:06,847
I didn't kiss your girlfriend.

349
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:08,782
She saved my life.

350
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:11,451
MIKE:
So, what do you say?

351
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,787
Are we in?

352
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,856
Fine. But we need
to figure out

353
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:17,257
something to do
with Puckerman's hair.

354
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:19,159
[bell rings]

355
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:21,128
[indistinct chatter]

356
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:25,833
Oh, no.

357
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:32,172
No way.

358
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,241
You're a genius-- they
have changed my life.

359
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:36,643
I didn't know my arms
could be so toasty.

360
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:38,078
You're a hero--
you should win

361
00:13:38,146 --> 00:13:39,279
some kind of award.

362
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:41,448
[whispers]:
What are you doing?

363
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:43,684
I'm so sorry, Rachel,
it just sort of caught on.

364
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:45,786
I see that, okay?
That is not what
we agreed upon!

365
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:47,154
I want my allowance
back right now!

366
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:48,155
It's already gone.

367
00:13:48,223 --> 00:13:49,423
My uncle lost his job,

368
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,191
and his goat was
going hungry, so...

369
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:52,860
I spent it on food
for the goat.

370
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:55,095
I mean, sort of.
The goat just ate the money.

371
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:58,065
Okay, the-the only way
to proceed is for you to come

372
00:13:58,132 --> 00:14:00,467
to school dressed
exactly like me.

373
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,070
What is that
look called?

374
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:04,338
Sexy schoolgirl
librarian chic.

375
00:14:04,405 --> 00:14:05,973
All right, you'd better
get a move on, okay?

376
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,575
Kids 'R' Us closes at
6:00 p.m. sharp. Go, Brittany.

[knocking on door]

389
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:45,646
You wanted to see me?

390
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:47,948
Yes. Mercedes, have a seat.

391
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:53,353
So, I've decided I'm going
to sing a song in Glee Club,

392
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:54,988
and I need your advice.

393
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:57,524
Now, as you may know,
I have a background in music.

394
00:14:57,592 --> 00:15:00,527
For a brief period, I
was a tambourine player
for Wilson-Phillips.

395
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:02,095
What I need to
learn from you

396
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:04,464
is how to be a diva.

397
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:07,434
Oh. Well, you've definitely
come to the right girl.

398
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:09,503
I mean, being a diva
is all about attitude,

399
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,305
something I know
you're not short on.

400
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:13,774
It's all about sassy fingers
and shaking that weave

401
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:17,177
and generally, taking
no nonsense from nobody.

402
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:18,211
Dig it, sister.

403
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,446
<i>Well, I have to say</i>

404
00:15:19,514 --> 00:15:21,682
I'm flattered and shocked
that you came to me.

405
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:24,117
Oh, come, now, "Ra-chelle,"
it doesn't humble me too much

406
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:26,119
to say I simply
need your tutelage.

407
00:15:26,187 --> 00:15:29,156
Well, I'll say this-- being
a diva is all about emotion.

408
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:31,058
In fact, you feel
so much emotion

409
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,759
that it cannot be
physically contained.

410
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:34,461
Sometimes you have
to close your eyes

411
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:36,396
and turn your head and push,

412
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,966
push your feelings away--
they're that big!

413
00:15:40,301 --> 00:15:41,735
Wow.

414
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:44,604
Well, that Mercedes
is wrong about you.

415
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:46,773
What... what
did she say?

416
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:48,976
Oh, I don't remember
the specifics, just
something about

417
00:15:49,043 --> 00:15:51,211
you're not as talented
as you think you are

418
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,813
and all your ideas
are horrible.

419
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,349
I don't know,
something like that.

420
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,817
She said what?

421
00:15:56,884 --> 00:15:58,151
Yep. Quote:

422
00:15:58,219 --> 00:15:59,853
"Not that talented."

423
00:16:02,223 --> 00:16:04,558
There you are.
I heard what you
said about me.

424
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,059
<i>RACHEL:
I heard what you said about me.</i>

425
00:16:06,127 --> 00:16:07,394
Just when I thought
we were friends.

426
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:09,096
I guess that will just
never happen, will it?

427
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:10,364
I guess not.

428
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:12,199
You know, there's only
one "I" in "diva," Rachel,

429
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:14,134
and that "I" is me.

430
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:16,236
Guess we're just gonna
have to settle this
the old-fashioned way.

431
00:16:16,304 --> 00:16:17,504
Diva-off.

432
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:19,373
Tomorrow, Glee Club.
Why not right now?

433
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,074
'Cause I have to go
get my cross-trainers.

434
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:22,542
Want to know why?

435
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,678
I'm gonna be
doing some runs.

436
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:34,399
So... Friday night,

437
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:37,002
I figured we'd check out
the Sullivan rink.

438
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,404
They have ice rink
bumper cars.

439
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:42,541
I told you, I haven't decided
what I'm doing yet.

440
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:52,117
Sweet Jesus, who bought
tickets to crazy town?

441
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:03,195
WILL:
All right, looks like

442
00:17:03,262 --> 00:17:05,397
the guys here are ready
to give us their anthem.

443
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:07,532
Everybody, we are

The Justin Bieber Experience,

445
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:11,670
and we think
this song is an anthem

446
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:13,772
because everything
Bieber does is epic.

447
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,773
Truth.

448
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:16,007
Anyway, this song,

449
00:17:16,075 --> 00:17:17,776
like all the songs I sing,

450
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:19,077
is for my girlfriend Quinn.

451
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:22,080

what'd you think?

516
00:19:49,695 --> 00:19:52,964
Honestly, although
my love would crush him,

517
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:55,767
I'm totally turned on
by the Biebster.

518
00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:58,737
That is, until I remember
that he looks like he's 12;

Sam's an artist, Finn.
An artist?

I guess that's why he's
taking you to Color Me Mine.

to figure out

what I was gonna do
with Sam, and I did.

539
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,750
I choose him.
Because of The Justin
Bieber Experience?

Look, I thought it was
gonna be stupid, too,

but he was so... shameless.

He just got up there
and owned it.

It was sexy.

I'm sorry, Finn.

Sam's an artist,

I'm a little bit nervous about

Or at least as good as Barry.

It's not about sex.

just so that you could
walk down the halls?

00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,333
Totally. Most teachers
think by cutting class,

I finally convinced Mercedes

that in order to do
a proper diva-off,

606
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,741
it has to come from
the Broadway catalogue.

is safe to say
