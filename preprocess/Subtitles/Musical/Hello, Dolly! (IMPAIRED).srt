Mr.Jones, with me,
business is always a pleasure.

You've got more businesses
than a dog has fleas.

As my late husband
Ephraim used to say,

12
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:47,103
if you have to live
from hand to mouth,

13
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:48,974

I make a very good
living!

A living's made
by selling

something everybody
needs at least once a year,

41
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:16,189
and a million is made
by producing something

every single day.

to prevent foolishness.

You'll have to sit still,

If I cut your throat,
it'll be practically unintentional.

69
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:14,212
Ah, 90% of people
are fools,

70
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:16,182

of contamination.

Enough! I'm a busy man
with things to do.

A scraped chin
is the least of them!

Is there something
extra you can do--

79
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:38,702
Something
a little special?

80
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:39,831
What?

81
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,705
Those things you do
to the young fellows.

everything

that's decent
to do to a man.

I don't want you blabbing
this at the barber shop,

89
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:57,656
but I need something
extra today

90
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:59,215
because I'm going
to New York

91
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:03,229
to call on a refined lady--
name of Miss Irene Molloy.

92
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:06,698
Your calling on ladies
is none of my business.

00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:13,506
What have you done
to Ambrose?

97
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:15,303
I had a quiet
little talk with him.

98
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:16,400
You did?

99
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:19,037
Yes. I explained to him
that he's a fool.

100
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,171
Oh, Uncle!

101
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:22,477
Weeping, weeping--
a waste of water.

102
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,144
I've done you a good turn.
'ou'll come thank me when you're 5(

But, Uncle, I love him.

Save your tears
for New York

105

be noticed.

Leave those things
to me.

If I don't
marry Ambrose,

them properly?

We've never
been here alone.

how old are you?

28 3/ 4,
Mr. Vandergelder.

136
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:38,490
Is that all?

137
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,322
That's a foolish
age to be at.

138
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:42,763
I thought
you were 40.

139
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:44,990
No. I'm 28 3/ 4.

140
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:48,967
Man's not worth a cent
until he's 40.

141
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,971
We pay him until then
to make mistakes.

142
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,631
Anyway, you're promoted
to chief clerk.

143
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,504
Chief clerk?

144
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:57,305
What am I now?

145
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,777
You're
an impertinent fool!

146
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:00,780
If you behave yourself,
I'll promote you

147
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:02,475
from impertinent fool
to chief clerk

148
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:03,914
with a raise
in your wages.

149
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:06,418
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Vandergelder.

150
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:07,818
You, Barnaby,

151
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,049

What is it?

156
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:19,732
Does a chief clerk get
one evening off a week?

157
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,462
So that's the way
you thank me, eh?

158
00:14:22,536 --> 00:14:25,266
No, sir! You'll attend
to the store as usual!

159
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:27,102
An evening free.

160
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:28,766
Keep asking
for evenings free,

161
00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:30,776
and you'll find yourself
with your days free.

162
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,072
Remember that.

163
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:33,374
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.

164
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:35,779
Listen I want you to run
the place perfectly

165
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:36,975
in my absence.

166
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:40,179
If I hear of foolishness,
I'll discharge you both.

167
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,654
You might as well know now,
when I return from New York,

168
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:45,157
there'll be some changes
around here.

169
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:46,157
Changes?

170
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:47,750
Yes, you're going
to have a mistress.

171
00:14:47,828 --> 00:14:49,921
I'm too young,
Mr. Vandergelder.

172
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:53,599
Not yours, idiot. Mine.

173
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,658
I mean I'm planning
to get married.

174
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:56,634
Married?

175
00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:57,966
Any objections?

176
00:14:58,038 --> 00:14:59,471
No, but--

177
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,474
Many congratulations,
Mr. Vandergelder,

178
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:03,407
and to the lady, too.

179
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:04,944
That's none
of your business!

180
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:06,206
Any further questions?

181
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,212
No, but--

182
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,213
But why what?

183
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,249
Speak up! What?

184
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:10,214
Why?

185
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,410
Why what, damn it?!

186
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:13,578
Why are you
getting married?

187
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:17,419
Let me tell you
something, son.

188
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:20,949
I've worked hard,
and I've become rich...

189
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:23,428
and friendless and mean.

190
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:28,298
In America, that's about
as far as you can go.

191
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:30,599
[Neigh]

192
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:36,943
It's time to be doing something
a little bit foolish.

193
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:39,713
Besides, I need
a steady housekeeper.

194
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:40,145
Besides, I need
a steady housekeeper.

195
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:19,171
[Neigh]

196
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:40,258
Well, well,
well, well, well.

197
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,819
Good morning,
Mr. Vandergelder,

198
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:45,091
Mr. Hackl,

199
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,632
Mr. Tucker.

200
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,258
Gentlemen.

201
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,462
Good morning Mrs. Levi.

202
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:53,062
Uh, good morning,
Mrs. Levi.

203
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,074
How handsome
you look today.

204
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:57,110
Ooh. You absolutely
take my breath away.

205
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,202
Ermengarde's upstairs
crying her eyes out.

206
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,144
You can take her now,
but blow her nose first.

207
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:04,241
If only Irene Molloy
could see you now.

208
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:06,252
Uh, find someplace else
to loaf!.

209
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,254
And you two get back
to the store!

210
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:10,586
Don't forget to put the lid
on the sheep dip!

211
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:13,785
I don't know what's
come over you lately,

212
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,795
but you seem to grow
younger every day.

213
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,262
If a man eats careful,

214
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:20,266
there's no reason
why he should look old.

215
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:22,768
You never said
a truer word.

216
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:26,438
Even if I never see
40--3 5 again...

217
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:28,267
3 5. Why I can see
at a glance

218
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,274
you'll be stamping
about at 1 00,

219
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:32,276
eating 5 meals a day
just like my uncle,

220
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:33,868
may he rest in peace.

221
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:35,743
Let me see your hand,
Mr. Vandergelder.

222
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:36,746
Oh, show me your hand.

223
00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:37,782
Why?

224
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:40,215
I'm a judge of hands.
I read hands.

225
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,446
I use them
to get things done.

226
00:19:42,521 --> 00:19:44,489
Lord in heaven!
Goodness gracious!

227
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,490
I just can't believe it!

228
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,959
Such a long life line,
from here to here.

229
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:52,462
It runs right off
your hand.

230
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:54,226
They'll have to hit you
with a mallet.

231
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,233
They'll have to stifle
you with a sofa pillow.

232
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:57,791
You will bury us all.

233
00:19:57,869 --> 00:19:59,336
I will?

234
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:00,336
Say...

235
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:01,463
Yes?

236
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,667
You're all spiffed up
today, aren't you?

237
00:20:03,742 --> 00:20:04,800
Yes.

238
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:07,811
And not for the benefit
of this smelly horse.

239
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:09,813
Well, if I had a guess,

240
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:12,475
I'd say you was goin'
somewhere.

241
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:17,821
Remarkable, Mrs. Levi.
How do you do it?

242
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:20,084
2 and 2 is 4,
Mr. Vandergelder.

243
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:23,457
With a head like yours,
you'll be rich someday.

244
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:25,826
That's exactly
what I had in mind.

245
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:27,728
Then I suggest
you pick up Ermengarde,

246
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,529
for which I'm paying you
good money.

247
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:33,332
Speaking of business,
Mr. Vandergelder,

248
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:35,339
I suppose
you've given up

249
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,204
all idea
of getting married.

250
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:38,867
Is that
what you suppose?

251
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:42,107
Then suppose you listen
to this, Mrs. Levi.

252
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,341
I've decided--
I've practically decided

253
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,214
to ask Irene Molloy
to be my wife.

254
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:49,549
You have?

255
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:50,679
Yeah, I have.

256
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:52,724
I'm going to New York
and discuss it with her.

257
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,122
This very afternoon.

258
00:20:56,428 --> 00:20:59,363
Well, that is just
about the best news

259
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:01,365
I have ever heard,
Mr. Vandergelder.

260
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:03,298
Oh, yes, indeed,
marvelous news.

261
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:04,835
Isn't it wonderful,
though?

262
00:21:04,903 --> 00:21:06,234
I'm wracking
my brain here.

263
00:21:06,304 --> 00:21:08,329
I'm trying to think
of something I've heard

264
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:10,068
that has made me
happier,

265
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:11,905
but I just can't
come up with a thing.

266
00:21:11,977 --> 00:21:13,808
It's just so wonderful.
It really is.

267
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:16,109
It's all your fault,
you know.

268
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:19,309
You put me into this
marrying frame of mind

269
00:21:19,384 --> 00:21:20,749
with your introductions
and scheming.

270
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,753
A poor widow must earn
a living.

271
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:24,288
One morning I wake up

272
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:26,847
and suddenly the house
seems like an empty shell...

273
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:28,483
and pretty messy, too.

274
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,654
A man needs someone
to take out the garbage.

275
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,755
And Irene Molloy's
the one to do it.

276
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:34,764
Darling girl.

277
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,494
I think it's
perfectly wonderful

278
00:21:36,568 --> 00:21:37,762
what's gonna happen
in your household,

279
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:39,531
Mr. Vandergelder.

280
00:21:39,604 --> 00:21:42,266
I never did like
the idea of all that--

281
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,308
All that money of yours

282
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:46,276
lying in great piles
in the bank,

283
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:48,312
so useless
and motionless.

284
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,780
As my late husband
Ephraim used to say,

285
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:53,215
''Money should circulate
like rainwater.

286
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:56,277
''It should be flowing
down among the people

287
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:58,788
''through dressmakers,
cabmen, and restaurants.

288
00:21:58,857 --> 00:22:00,324
''Setting up
a business here,

289
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:01,791
furnishing a good time
over there.''

290
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,226
Oh, you and the future
Mrs. Vandergelder

291
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:07,231
will see that all
your hard-earned wealth

292
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:10,234
flows in and around
many peoples' lives--

293
00:22:10,302 --> 00:22:12,236
Just flowing,
pouring out.

294
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:14,272
All right.
Stop saying that!

295
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,432
I wish you happiness
under the sun,

296
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:18,567
and good-bye,
Mr. Vandergelder.

297
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:19,735
Yes, well,
good-bye.

298
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:21,574
And when I get back
to New York,

299
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:23,546
I'll tell the heiress
not to wait.

300
00:22:23,615 --> 00:22:25,014
What did you say?

301
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:28,484
Oh, nothing, nothing.
A word-- <i>heiress.</i>

302
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:30,043
Well,just a minute.

303
00:22:30,122 --> 00:22:33,182
That's kind of unusual,
isn't it, Mrs. Levi?

304
00:22:33,258 --> 00:22:36,056
I haven't been
hunting usual girls

305
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:37,891
to interest you,
Mr. Vandergelder,

306
00:22:37,963 --> 00:22:39,590
but now all that
is too late.

307
00:22:39,664 --> 00:22:41,427
You're engaged
to Irene Molloy.

308
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,626
I'm not engaged.

309
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:45,067
I can't keep disturbing
these fine women

310
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:46,604
unless
you mean business.

311
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:48,195
Who said
I don't mean business?

312
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:50,764
You're playing
a dangerous game.

313
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:51,740
Dangerous?

314
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,902
Of course
it's dangerous.

315
00:22:52,978 --> 00:22:55,446
It's tampering with
a woman's affections,

316
00:22:55,514 --> 00:22:56,913
and the only way
to save yourself

317
00:22:56,982 --> 00:22:58,313
from that charge,
Mr. Vandergelder,

318
00:22:58,383 --> 00:23:01,250
is to get married
to someone soon--

319
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,308
Very soon.

320
00:23:02,387 --> 00:23:03,684
Don't worry.

321
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:04,779
I won't.

322
00:23:04,856 --> 00:23:06,448
I'll meet you in front
of Molloy's hat shop

323
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:07,856
at 2:30 as usual.

324
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:10,394
Never mind. No need to.
You've done your work.

325
00:23:10,462 --> 00:23:12,362
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

326
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,523
I'll be there to ensure
that nothing goes wrong.

327
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,032
Just tend
to Ermengarde

328
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:18,831
or return the fee
I gave you.

329
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:21,702
Speaking of money,
I almost forgot--

330
00:23:21,773 --> 00:23:23,035
How much?

331
00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:24,905
I left all my money
in my other handbag

332
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:27,035
which burned in a fire
at cleaners--50?

333
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:28,044
50?

334
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:30,047
Plenty.
Oh, bless you.

335
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:32,083
And don't worry
your handsome head

336
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,378
about a thing.

337
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:35,385
Just keep
all your thoughts

338
00:23:35,453 --> 00:23:37,546
on that lovely
Irene Molloy.

339
00:23:45,764 --> 00:23:47,322
[BellJingles]

340
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,560
[JingleJingle]

341
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:12,016
[Humming]

342
00:25:31,937 --> 00:25:34,872
If he had any taste
at all,

343
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,569
he'd have the shutters
done over in green.

344
00:25:38,643 --> 00:25:39,905
Mmm...

345
00:25:39,978 --> 00:25:42,037
forest green shutters.

346
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:44,881
What are
you doing?

347
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,680
Get away!
My uncle!

348
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:49,276
He's not here.

349
00:25:49,354 --> 00:25:51,379
Now, quick.
We're running away.

350
00:25:51,456 --> 00:25:53,924
Hurry, before
the train gets here.

351
00:25:53,992 --> 00:25:55,050
Train?

352
00:25:55,126 --> 00:25:57,253
New York. To be married.
We're going to elope.

353
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:59,729
Elope? How can you
use that awful word?

354
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:02,198
Oh, Ermengarde.

355
00:26:02,267 --> 00:26:05,031
My, what a romantic scene.

356
00:26:05,103 --> 00:26:08,095
I want to marry Ambrose
but not elope!

357
00:26:08,173 --> 00:26:09,988
This doesn't concern
Mrs. Levi.

358
00:26:10,122 --> 00:26:12,022
Everything concerns
Dolly Levi.

359
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,182
Don't listen.

360
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:14,748
I know why
you're here.

361
00:26:14,826 --> 00:26:16,259
To help you,

362
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:17,693
and love needs
all the help it can get.

363
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:19,286
Listen, both of you.

364
00:26:19,364 --> 00:26:20,661
There's no time.

365
00:26:20,732 --> 00:26:23,997
I'm feeling an updraft
in my underpants.

366
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:26,333
This is no way
to elope.

367
00:26:26,404 --> 00:26:27,871
If you follow
my suggestions,

368
00:26:27,939 --> 00:26:29,338
Horace Vandergelder will
not only give permission

369
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:31,637
but he'll dance
at your wedding,

370
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,678
and not alone either.

371
00:26:33,745 --> 00:26:35,713
Mr. Kemper,
can you dance?

372
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,678
Dance?

373
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:37,715
Yes, dance.

374
00:26:37,782 --> 00:26:39,511
I'm an artist.
I paint.

375
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:40,881
No problem.

376
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:42,852
''Painters taught
how to dance.''

377
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:45,389
I'll take you
to New York.

378
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:46,856
See? I told you!

379
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:48,859
You will stay
close by.

380
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,861
You'll take her
to dinner

381
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:53,056
at the Harmonia
Gardens restaurant.

382
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:55,224
You'll enter
the polka contest.

383
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,858
Polka contest?

384
00:26:56,935 --> 00:26:58,698
The prize
is a gold cup

385
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,862
and money.

386
00:26:59,938 --> 00:27:02,566
The cups we won,
my husband and I.

387
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:04,006
Now wait a minute.

388
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:06,305
I'm surprised you have
acquaintances like that.

389
00:27:06,378 --> 00:27:09,506
Not acquaintances,
Ermengarde, friends--

390
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:12,812
Dear friends
from days gone by.

391
00:27:12,884 --> 00:27:15,318
My late husband Ephraim
believed in life--

392
00:27:15,387 --> 00:27:17,355
anyplace
you could find it--

393
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:18,855
wherever
there were people,

394
00:27:18,924 --> 00:27:20,323
all kinds of people.

395
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:21,825
And every Friday night,

396
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:24,327
even when times
were bad--

397
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:27,331
Every Friday night,
like clockwork,

398
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:30,334
down those stairs
of the Harmonia Gardens

399
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:32,836
we came,
Ephraim and I.

400
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:37,833
Not acquaintances,
Ermengarde--friends.

401
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:39,638
It's all very well
for you, Mrs. Levi,

402
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:41,178
but you're suggesting--

403
00:27:41,246 --> 00:27:43,214
Do you want
to show Horace

404
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:45,010
that you
mean business?

405
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:47,074
- Yes!
- Yes!

406
00:27:47,152 --> 00:27:48,585
Well, you must go

407
00:27:48,653 --> 00:27:50,177
to the Harmonia
Gardens restaurant.

408
00:27:50,255 --> 00:27:52,348
Say that Mrs. Levi
sent you...

409
00:27:52,424 --> 00:27:53,857
and, yes, well...

410
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:56,393
tell Rudolph that
Dolly's coming back.

411
00:27:56,461 --> 00:27:58,224
Dolly's coming back.

412
00:27:58,296 --> 00:27:59,854
Yes. I want a table
for two

413
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:01,398
and stuffed chicken
for 8:00.

414
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:02,398
Mr. Vandergelder

415
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:04,332
will learn
of your triumph.

416
00:28:04,402 --> 00:28:06,097
Everything will work
out beautifully.

417
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:08,332
But how, Mrs. Levi?

418
00:28:08,406 --> 00:28:10,397
How? Ha ha ha!

419
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:13,137
Ha--Ohh.

420
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:14,769
28 3/ 4 years old

421
00:28:14,846 --> 00:28:17,440
and I still don't
get an evening free!

422
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:20,678
When am I gonna
begin to live?

423
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:26,084
Barnaby, how much
money have you got?

424
00:28:26,157 --> 00:28:27,317
Huh?

425
00:28:27,392 --> 00:28:29,826
That you can get
your hands on?

426
00:28:29,894 --> 00:28:31,657
About $3.00. Why?

427
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,664
Barnaby,
you and I

428
00:28:33,732 --> 00:28:35,666
are going
to New York!

429
00:28:35,734 --> 00:28:37,668
We can't close
the store!

430
00:28:37,736 --> 00:28:38,828
We'll have to,

431
00:28:38,903 --> 00:28:40,837
'cause some rotten cans
of chicken mash

432
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:42,372
are going to explode.

433
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,964
Holy cabooses!
How do you know?

434
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:46,169
'Cause I'm gonna
light candles under them.

435
00:28:46,244 --> 00:28:48,144
They'll make
such a stink

436
00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:51,148
customers won't come in
for 2 4 hours!

437
00:28:51,216 --> 00:28:54,652
We're going to New York,
and we're gonna live!

438
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:57,688
We'll have a good meal,
we're gonna be in danger,

439
00:28:57,756 --> 00:29:00,350
get almost arrested,
and spend all our money!

440
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:02,484
Holy cabooses!

441
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,461
And we are not coming
back to Yonkers

442
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,623
until we've each
kissed a girl.

443
00:29:07,699 --> 00:29:10,634
Cornelius,
you can't do that.

444
00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:13,102
You don't know
any girls.

445
00:29:13,171 --> 00:29:15,605
I'm 28 3/ 4.

446
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:18,142
I've got to begin
sometime.

447
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:19,938
I'm only 1 9 1 /2.

448
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:22,343
With me,
it's not so urgent.

449
00:29:22,414 --> 00:29:25,144
May I make
a suggestion?

450
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:26,444
Mrs. Levi!

451
00:29:26,518 --> 00:29:28,213
I just couldn't
help hearing.

452
00:29:28,286 --> 00:29:29,310
We'll be fired.

453
00:29:29,387 --> 00:29:31,150
We were only talking!

454
00:29:31,222 --> 00:29:33,622
Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker,

455
00:29:33,692 --> 00:29:35,819
there's nothing
that makes me happier

456
00:29:35,894 --> 00:29:37,862
than the thought
of 2 fine young men

457
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:39,328
such as yourselves

458
00:29:39,397 --> 00:29:41,627
enjoying the company
of 2 lovely ladies.

459
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,531
What ladies? Where?

460
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:45,068
In New York,
to which,

461
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:47,161
unless my ears
play tricks,

462
00:29:47,238 --> 00:29:49,138
you are bound.

463
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:50,640
Now, there's
this millinery shop

464
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:52,472
run by
a charming woman.

465
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:54,171
''Irene Molloy.''

466
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:56,679
And her assistant,
Miss Minnie Fay.

467
00:29:56,748 --> 00:29:57,908
Holy cabooses!

468
00:29:57,982 --> 00:30:00,507
And now that you've
noted the address,

469
00:30:00,585 --> 00:30:01,677
I have only this
to say--

470
00:30:01,753 --> 00:30:03,653
2:00
in the afternoon

471
00:30:03,722 --> 00:30:06,156
is the ideal time
for conversation--

472
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:08,192
definitely
no later than 2:30.

473
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:11,160
If you ever say this
was my suggestion,

474
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:12,696
well, I shall
denounce you both

475
00:30:12,764 --> 00:30:14,857
for the terrible
liars you are.

476
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:19,165
Ohhh!

477
00:30:19,237 --> 00:30:21,171
A millinery shop.

478
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:23,173
Women who work.

479
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:24,173
Adventure, Barnaby!

480
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:25,402
I'm scared.

481
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:26,375
Living, Barnaby!

482
00:30:26,444 --> 00:30:27,411
I'm scared.

483
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:29,208
Will you come,
Barnaby?

484
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,180

Do get done
with that, Minnie.

Do get done
with that, Minnie.

The men are eyeing us
for the wrong reason.

A banana a day keeps
the doctor away.

You mean an apple a day.

Who ever heard of a doctor
slipping on apple peel?

How are you,
Miss Molloy?

I'd be positively indecent.

Oh, I certainly am.

that you never
finish your lunch,

finish your sentences.

Am I marrying

Yes, I'm considering it
if he asks me.

523
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:13,315
Oh, I'd rather die
on the rack

524
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:15,317
than ask such
a personal question,

we're on the subject,

why would you? I mean--

00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:19,820
Because he's rich.

It's natural

I mean, what you said
about hating hats.

00:37:47,951 --> 00:37:48,849
Not just hats.

543
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:50,546
Particularly the women
who buy them.

You don't mean that,
Irene Molloy.

Yes, I do, Minnie.
All lady milliners

546
00:37:54,424 --> 00:37:56,358
are suspected
of being wicked women.

Wicked women?

548
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,553
Those dowagers
come in the shop

549
00:37:59,629 --> 00:38:00,561
merely to stare
at me.

Ooh. How dare they?

If they were certain
I was a wicked woman,

552

they wouldn't set foot
in the shop.

Good riddance.

So do I go out
to restaurants?

No. It would be bad
for business.

557

Do I go to balls
or theaters

558
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:16,043
or operas?

No. It would be
bad for business.

The only men
I ever get to meet

are the merchants who come
to sell me things.

I'm sick and tired of being
suspected of being wicked

Why does everybody
have adventures but me?

Adventures?

No gumption.

Either I marry
Horace Vandergelder,

or I'm gonna burn
this shop down

and break out
like a fire engine

some excitement.

To catch a beau,
I suppose.

If you asked me,

with a heavy veil.

down the back

none of it.

Why not?

it's provocative,

that's why not.

Well, who knows
that provocative

isn't just what
I want to be today?

you don't love

I don't love him.

We'll heat them up,
then drop them cold.

this is an adventure?

You don't have
to ask, Barnaby.

When you're in one,
you'll know it.

How much money
have we got left?

Enough for the train,
dinner, and the whale.

When they come out,

we'll pretend
we're rich.

We won't have to
spend anything.

Why don't we say
Mrs. Levi sent us?

No! We're not supposed
to ever say that!

00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,043
Good afternoon,
gentlemen.

647
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:39,280
[Stammers]

648
00:43:39,354 --> 00:43:40,821
Cornelius Hackl
here.

649
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:43,380
Barnaby Tucker here.

650
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:45,892
Irene Molloy here.

651
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:49,260
I'm very happy
to meet you.

652
00:43:50,365 --> 00:43:52,162
Is there anything
I can do for you?

653
00:43:55,604 --> 00:43:56,764
Ooh!

654
00:43:56,838 --> 00:43:58,237
Well, you see,

655
00:43:58,306 --> 00:43:59,739
we're 2
ladies-about-town

656
00:43:59,808 --> 00:44:01,742
lookin' for hats
to Molloy--

657
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,744
We're hats,
and we wondered

658
00:44:03,812 --> 00:44:06,713
if we could buy a lady
or 2 to Molloy with--

659
00:44:06,781 --> 00:44:08,681
We want a hat.

660
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,684
Well, for a lady,
of course.

661
00:44:10,752 --> 00:44:13,516
Everyone said to go
to Miss Molloy's

662
00:44:13,588 --> 00:44:16,284
'cause she's
so pretty--

663
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:19,691
I mean, her hats
are so pretty.

664
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:21,285
And what sort of hat

665
00:44:21,363 --> 00:44:24,389
would Mrs. Hackl
be liking?

666
00:44:24,466 --> 00:44:26,696
Oh, no,
Miss Molloy,

667
00:44:26,768 --> 00:44:28,702
there is
no Mrs. Hackl.

668
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,670
Yes, there is.
Your mother.

669
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:33,173
She didn't mean that,

670
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:34,765
did you, Miss Molloy?

671
00:44:34,843 --> 00:44:38,176
Now, this lady friend
of yours,

672
00:44:38,246 --> 00:44:39,713
couldn't she come in
with you some day

673
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:41,146
and choose the hat
herself?

674
00:44:41,216 --> 00:44:42,183
Impossible.

675
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,684
There is no
lady friend.

676
00:44:44,753 --> 00:44:46,380
I thought you said

677
00:44:46,454 --> 00:44:48,718
you were here
to choose--

678
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,280
I mean
she's Barnaby's.

679
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:52,690
Huh? What?

680
00:44:52,761 --> 00:44:55,195
Yes, but she lives
in Yonkers.

681
00:44:55,263 --> 00:44:57,697
She said to pick out
something

682
00:44:57,766 --> 00:44:59,199
under a dollar.

683
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:00,734
Don't be silly,
Barnaby.

684
00:45:00,802 --> 00:45:02,201
Money's no object with us.
None at all.

685
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,703
[Minnie Coughing]

686
00:45:03,772 --> 00:45:05,967
Oh, my assistant--
Miss Minnie Fay.

687
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:08,475
Mr. Hackl,
Mr. Tucker.

688
00:45:08,543 --> 00:45:10,101
Good afternoon, ma'am.

689
00:45:10,178 --> 00:45:11,645
Afternoon, ma'am.

690
00:45:11,713 --> 00:45:14,238
[Giggling]

691
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,346
Excuse me, Mr. Tucker,

692
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,752
did you say Yonkers?

693
00:45:20,822 --> 00:45:22,551
Yes, ma'am.
We're from Yonkers.

694
00:45:22,624 --> 00:45:26,082
Well, <i>are</i> you?

695
00:45:26,161 --> 00:45:27,287
Yes.

696
00:45:27,362 --> 00:45:29,262
And forgive me
for saying this,

697
00:45:29,331 --> 00:45:32,266
but you should see
Yonkers, Miss Molloy.

698
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:34,768
I mean, perhaps you and
your gentleman friend

699
00:45:34,836 --> 00:45:38,272
here in New York
might like to see it.

700
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,365
It's the most beautiful
town in the world--

701
00:45:40,442 --> 00:45:41,807
That's what they say.

702
00:45:41,876 --> 00:45:44,367
So I've heard,

703
00:45:44,446 --> 00:45:46,914
but I'm afraid I don't have
a gentleman friend here.

704
00:45:46,982 --> 00:45:48,040
You don't?

705
00:45:48,116 --> 00:45:50,277
Barnaby, she doesn't
have a gentleman friend.

706
00:45:50,352 --> 00:45:51,319
Ha ha ha!

707
00:45:51,386 --> 00:45:53,286
Hey, that's too bad.

708
00:45:53,355 --> 00:45:56,290
If you should happen
to have a Sunday free--

709
00:45:56,358 --> 00:45:58,326
You're Catholic,
aren't you?

710
00:45:58,393 --> 00:46:00,293
Don't worry.
I'm willing to change.

711
00:46:00,362 --> 00:46:03,297
If you're free
in the near future,

712
00:46:03,365 --> 00:46:05,333
I'd, well...we'd...

713
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,733
like to show you Yonkers
from top to bottom.

714
00:46:08,803 --> 00:46:10,293
It's very historic.

715
00:46:10,372 --> 00:46:11,532
As a matter of fact,

716
00:46:11,606 --> 00:46:13,267
I might be there
sooner than you think.

717
00:46:13,341 --> 00:46:14,740
This Sunday?

718
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:16,800
You see, I have a friend
who lives in Yonkers.

719
00:46:16,878 --> 00:46:18,903
Perhaps you know him.

720
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,777
I do?

721
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:23,579
Oh, it's always so foolish
to ask in cases like that,

722
00:46:23,652 --> 00:46:24,778
isn't it?

723
00:46:24,853 --> 00:46:26,377
Why should you know him?

724
00:46:26,454 --> 00:46:27,751
It's a Mr. Vandergelder?

725
00:46:27,822 --> 00:46:29,289
Mr. Vandergelder, oh!

726
00:46:29,357 --> 00:46:30,756
Horace Vandergelder?

727
00:46:30,825 --> 00:46:32,725
Of Vandergelder's
Hay and Feed?

728
00:46:32,794 --> 00:46:34,557
Yes, do you know him?

729
00:46:34,629 --> 00:46:36,358
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

730
00:46:36,431 --> 00:46:37,363
- No!
- No!

731
00:46:37,432 --> 00:46:38,399
- No, no!
- No, no!

732
00:46:38,466 --> 00:46:39,626
Mr. Vandergelder's

733
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:42,135
coming to see me
this afternoon.

734
00:46:42,203 --> 00:46:43,261
Coming here?

735
00:46:43,338 --> 00:46:44,396
This afternoon?

736
00:46:44,472 --> 00:46:46,497
Cornelius!
Cornelius, look!

737
00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:49,833
It's wolf-trap!

738
00:46:49,911 --> 00:46:51,003
Look out!

739
00:46:52,881 --> 00:46:54,781
Beggin' your pardon,
Miss Molloy.

740
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:56,373
Gentlemen,
what are you doing?

741
00:46:56,451 --> 00:46:58,146
We'll explain later.
Just help us!

742
00:46:58,219 --> 00:46:59,516
Come out of there
this minute!

743
00:46:59,587 --> 00:47:01,714
We're innocent as can be,
Miss Molloy.

744
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,725
I insist that
you both come out,

745
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:06,727
or I'll be forced--

746
00:47:06,795 --> 00:47:09,229
Mr. Vandergelder,
how nice to see you.

747
00:47:09,297 --> 00:47:10,847
And Dolly Levi.
What a surprise.

748
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:12,846
Irene, my darling,
how well you look.

749
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,850
You must be in love.

750
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,579
Afternoon,
Miss Molloy.

751
00:47:16,653 --> 00:47:19,383
What a pleasure to have you
in New York.

752
00:47:19,456 --> 00:47:22,584
Yes. Yonkers lies up there
decimated today.

753
00:47:22,659 --> 00:47:25,822
We thought we'd pay you
a visit, Irene,

754
00:47:25,895 --> 00:47:27,726
unless it's inconvenient.

755
00:47:27,797 --> 00:47:29,594
Inconvenient?

756
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:32,191
Whatever gave you
that idea?

757
00:47:32,268 --> 00:47:33,599
Mr. Vandergelder thought

758
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,604
he saw 2 customers
in the shop--

759
00:47:35,672 --> 00:47:36,934
2, uh, men.

760
00:47:37,007 --> 00:47:38,167
Men!

761
00:47:38,241 --> 00:47:39,674
Oh ho ho.

762
00:47:39,743 --> 00:47:41,677
In a ladies'
hat shop?

763
00:47:41,745 --> 00:47:43,178
Ha ha ha!

764
00:47:43,246 --> 00:47:44,873
Come on, let's go
into my workroom.

765
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:46,313
I'm so eager for you
to see it.

766
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:48,783
I've already
seen it twice.

767
00:47:48,852 --> 00:47:50,376
But I need
your advice.

768
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:52,011
Advice
from Mr. Vandergelder.

769
00:47:52,088 --> 00:47:54,215
The whole city should
hear this and grow rich.

770
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,349
Advice is cheap,
Miss Molloy.

771
00:47:56,426 --> 00:47:57,859
It's the things that come
gift-wrapped that count.

772
00:47:57,927 --> 00:48:00,191
I have never heard it
put more beautifully.

773
00:48:00,263 --> 00:48:02,197
Thank you,
Mr. Vandergelder.

774
00:48:02,265 --> 00:48:04,130
Chocolate-covered
peanuts, unshelled.

775
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,168
They're
the expensive kind.

776
00:48:06,236 --> 00:48:09,171
Why don't we open them
in the workroom?

777
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:10,297
Miss Molloy,

778
00:48:10,373 --> 00:48:13,501
I have important business
to discuss with you

779
00:48:13,576 --> 00:48:17,637
as soon as Mrs. Levi
says good-bye.

780
00:48:17,714 --> 00:48:19,341
Pay no attention to me.

781
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:21,316
I'm just browsing.

782
00:48:21,384 --> 00:48:22,646
Business,
Mr. Vandergelder?

783
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:23,777
Hay and feed?

784
00:48:23,853 --> 00:48:24,979
Well, not exactly.

785
00:48:25,055 --> 00:48:26,647
A new hat shop
in Yonkers?

786
00:48:26,723 --> 00:48:28,987
I hear it's a very
beautiful city,

787
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:30,253
and quite historic
according--

788
00:48:31,895 --> 00:48:33,988
Yes, go on.

789
00:48:34,064 --> 00:48:37,659
Who's been telling you
about Yonkers, may I ask?

790
00:48:37,734 --> 00:48:39,201
Oh, nobody.
A friend.

791
00:48:39,269 --> 00:48:40,827
What friend?

792
00:48:42,105 --> 00:48:44,266
Well, you see,
he--

793
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,534
He?

794
00:48:45,608 --> 00:48:49,066
Yes, uh...he--

795
00:48:49,145 --> 00:48:50,510
His name,
Miss Molloy.

796
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,672
What?

797
00:48:51,748 --> 00:48:53,215
His name.

798
00:48:53,283 --> 00:48:56,480
Oh, I believe it was--
is Mr. Cornelius Hackl

799
00:48:56,553 --> 00:48:59,147
of Yonkers.

800
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,318
Cornelius Hackl?

801
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:03,188
Yes.
Do you know him?

802
00:49:03,259 --> 00:49:05,159
He's my head clerk.

803
00:49:05,228 --> 00:49:06,286
He is?

804
00:49:06,362 --> 00:49:07,989
He's been in my store
for 1 0 years.

805
00:49:08,064 --> 00:49:09,793
Where would
you have known him?

806
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:10,992
Just one of those
chance meetings,

807
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:12,125
I suppose.

808
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:14,670
Yes, one of those
chance meetings.

809
00:49:14,737 --> 00:49:15,795
Chance meetings?

810
00:49:15,872 --> 00:49:17,897
Cornelius has no right
to chance meetings!

811
00:49:17,974 --> 00:49:20,033
Where was it?

812
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,543
Really!
It's unlike you

813
00:49:21,611 --> 00:49:22,873
to question me
in such a way.

814
00:49:22,946 --> 00:49:24,880
The truth
might as well

815
00:49:24,948 --> 00:49:26,142
come out now.

816
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:27,649
Your head clerk

817
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:29,309
is better known
than you think.

818
00:49:29,385 --> 00:49:30,317
Nonsense.

819
00:49:30,386 --> 00:49:32,650
He's in New York
all the time.

820
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:34,019
Everybody knows
Cornelius Hackl.

821
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,684
He never comes
to New York.

822
00:49:36,759 --> 00:49:39,057
He works all day
in my store.

823
00:49:39,129 --> 00:49:40,460
So you think,
but it's not true.

824
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,794
Dolly Levi,
you are mistaken!

825
00:49:42,866 --> 00:49:43,992
Horace Vandergelder,

826
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:46,035
you keep your nose so deep
in account books,

827
00:49:46,102 --> 00:49:49,333
you don't even
know what goes on.

828
00:49:49,405 --> 00:49:51,999
By day, he's your faithful,
trusted clerk.

829
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:55,841
But by night, oh, by night,
he leads a double life.

830
00:49:55,912 --> 00:49:57,846
Why he's, why he's here--

831
00:49:57,914 --> 00:49:59,848
Umm...at the opera,

832
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:02,680
at the great restaurants,
the fashionable homes.

833
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:04,879
He's even at the Harmonia
Gardens restaurant

834
00:50:04,954 --> 00:50:06,387
2, 3 times a week.

835
00:50:06,456 --> 00:50:07,855
The fact is,

836
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:09,858
he is the wittiest,
gayest, naughtiest,

837
00:50:09,926 --> 00:50:12,827
most delightful man
in New York City.

838
00:50:12,896 --> 00:50:16,593
He's just <i>the</i>--
<i>the</i> famous Cornelius Hackl!

839
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:18,361
It ain't
the same man.

840
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:20,925
If I thought Cornelius
came to New York,

841
00:50:21,004 --> 00:50:22,096
I'd discharge him!

842
00:50:22,172 --> 00:50:24,037
Who took the horses off
ofJenny Lind's carriage

843
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:25,870
and pulled them
through the streets?

844
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:26,931
- Who?
- Cornelius Hackl!

845
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:28,875
Who dressed up as a waiter
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel

846
00:50:29,345 --> 00:50:30,869
and took an oyster
and dropped it right down--

847
00:50:30,947 --> 00:50:32,380
No, it's too wicked.
I can't say it.

848
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:33,938
Say it!

849
00:50:34,017 --> 00:50:35,450
No, but it was
Cornelius Hackl.

850
00:50:35,518 --> 00:50:37,884
It ain't the same man!
Where'd he get the money?

851
00:50:37,954 --> 00:50:40,388
Oh, he's very rich.

852
00:50:40,456 --> 00:50:42,515
Rich?! I keep his money
in my own safe.

853
00:50:42,592 --> 00:50:43,752
He has $1 45.36!

854
00:50:43,826 --> 00:50:46,886
Oh, Mr. Vandergelder,
you are killing me.

855
00:50:46,963 --> 00:50:48,931
He's one
of <i>the</i> Hackls.

856
00:50:48,998 --> 00:50:50,590
They built
the Raritan Canal.

857
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:52,430
Then why would he work
in my store?

858
00:50:52,502 --> 00:50:53,560
I don't wanna hear it.

859
00:50:53,636 --> 00:50:55,069
I'm going home.
I have a headache.

860
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:57,072
It ain't the same man.
You can't escape facts.

861
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,402
I just made him
chief clerk!

862
00:50:58,474 --> 00:51:00,374
If you had any sense,
you'd make him a partner.

863
00:51:00,443 --> 00:51:02,070
Irene, I can see
you're as taken with him

864
00:51:02,145 --> 00:51:03,407
as everybody else is.

865
00:51:03,479 --> 00:51:05,379
But I only met him
once.

866
00:51:05,448 --> 00:51:07,939
Now, don't be thinking
of marrying him.

867
00:51:08,017 --> 00:51:10,417
Dolly, what are
you saying?

868
00:51:10,486 --> 00:51:12,249
Careful. He breaks hearts
like hickory nuts.

869
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:13,254
Horace: Who?

870
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:14,255
Cornelius Hackl.

871
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:15,348
Miss Molloy,

872
00:51:15,425 --> 00:51:17,359
how long has he been
calling on you?

873
00:51:17,427 --> 00:51:18,860
Mr. Vandergelder,
suppose I told you

874
00:51:18,928 --> 00:51:21,396
he has not been
calling on me?

875
00:51:21,464 --> 00:51:23,295
Excuse me.

876
00:51:23,366 --> 00:51:25,527
Not now, Minnie!

877
00:51:31,941 --> 00:51:32,873
Aaah!

878
00:51:32,942 --> 00:51:34,034
Stop singing,
Minnie!

879
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:35,543
There's a man
in there!

880
00:51:35,612 --> 00:51:36,579
That's not amusing,
Minnie.

881
00:51:36,646 --> 00:51:37,544
But there's a man!

882
00:51:37,614 --> 00:51:39,582
We don't wish
to be interrupted.

883
00:51:39,649 --> 00:51:40,911
Go back immediately.

884
00:51:40,984 --> 00:51:43,919
The poor dear is tired
from overwork.

885
00:51:43,987 --> 00:51:46,979
If there's a man in there,
we'll get him out!

886
00:51:47,056 --> 00:51:48,921
Whoever you are,
come on out!

887
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:50,721
Do you realize
what you're saying?

888
00:51:50,793 --> 00:51:51,725
I certainly do!

889
00:51:51,794 --> 00:51:53,728
Before you move
or say another word

890
00:51:53,796 --> 00:51:57,789
that you might
regret, allow me.

891
00:51:57,867 --> 00:51:58,765
Dolly!

892
00:51:58,835 --> 00:52:00,564
Stand back.

893
00:52:06,509 --> 00:52:07,999
There. You see?

894
00:52:08,077 --> 00:52:09,874
So much
for this nonsense

895
00:52:09,946 --> 00:52:11,470
about that
darling girl

896
00:52:11,547 --> 00:52:14,277
hiding a man
in the closet.

897
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,840
We'll forget
you ever said it.

898
00:52:15,918 --> 00:52:16,885
It's forgotten.

899
00:52:16,953 --> 00:52:18,386
Ah-choo!

900
00:52:18,454 --> 00:52:20,046
Because there's
nobody in there.

901
00:52:20,123 --> 00:52:21,055
Ah-choo!

902
00:52:21,124 --> 00:52:23,456
God bless you.

903
00:52:32,969 --> 00:52:34,163
Miss Molloy?

904
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:38,003
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder,
there is a man in there.

905
00:52:38,074 --> 00:52:40,167
I see.

906
00:52:40,243 --> 00:52:43,076
There also happens
to be an explanation,

907
00:52:43,146 --> 00:52:44,579
but for the present

908
00:52:44,647 --> 00:52:47,616
I should just say
good afternoon.

909
00:52:47,684 --> 00:52:49,345
Ah-choo!

910
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:52,149
Ah-choo!

911
00:52:53,156 --> 00:52:54,714
Another?

912
00:52:55,658 --> 00:52:57,182
Another.

913
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,158
Good Lord,

914
00:52:58,227 --> 00:53:00,320
the whole room
is crawling with men.

915
00:53:00,396 --> 00:53:01,863
Irene, darling,
congratulations.

916
00:53:01,931 --> 00:53:05,264
Miss Molloy,
I shan't trouble you again.

917
00:53:05,335 --> 00:53:08,336
And I hope, vice versa.

918
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,205
Horace, where
are you going?

919
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:15,242
To march in
the 1 4th Street parade

920
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,505
with the kind of people
I can trust--

921
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:19,911
7 00 men.

922
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,412
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

923
00:53:39,601 --> 00:53:40,761
Now.

924
00:53:40,835 --> 00:53:42,769
I demand
an explanation!

925
00:53:42,837 --> 00:53:44,771
Have you met
Minnie Fay?

926
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:47,000
Leave, or I'll call
for Officer Gogarty!

927
00:53:47,075 --> 00:53:49,043
There's no fun
in a jailhouse.

928
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,008
Jail?!

929
00:53:50,078 --> 00:53:51,010
Jail!

930
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:52,842
Everybody,
don't talk at once!

931
00:53:52,914 --> 00:53:54,040
Just because you're
rich and famous...

932
00:53:54,115 --> 00:53:55,047
Rich and famous?

933
00:53:55,116 --> 00:53:56,048
Don't deny it.

934
00:53:56,117 --> 00:53:57,015
Doesn't mean

935
00:53:57,085 --> 00:53:58,552
you won't make up
for this trouble.

936
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,552
We'll do anything.

937
00:53:59,621 --> 00:54:00,553
Irene,
Cornelius Hackl.

938
00:54:00,622 --> 00:54:01,782
We've already met.

939
00:54:01,856 --> 00:54:03,118
Jail is
absolutely out.

940
00:54:03,191 --> 00:54:04,988
Cornelius,
explain to her.

941
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:06,219
I'm Cornelius Hackl.

942
00:54:06,294 --> 00:54:07,727
Minnie Fay.

943
00:54:07,795 --> 00:54:10,764
The only way
to make up for it--

944
00:54:10,832 --> 00:54:12,231
Yes, of course--

945
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,461
You can have them
both put away for years

946
00:54:14,536 --> 00:54:16,231
on this charge.
Help, police, help.

947
00:54:16,304 --> 00:54:18,238
Only have dinner
with them first

948
00:54:18,306 --> 00:54:20,740
to show that you tried
to settle amicably.

949
00:54:20,808 --> 00:54:22,503
Dinner first, life
imprisonment later.

950
00:54:22,577 --> 00:54:23,976
It's a lovely day.

951
00:54:24,045 --> 00:54:25,512
It's gonna be
a lovelier evening.

952
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,013
Something could happen

953
00:54:27,081 --> 00:54:28,981
before you send them
to jail.

954
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:30,483
Oh, by all means.

955
00:54:30,552 --> 00:54:32,782
It's what Barnaby
and I had in mind.

956
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:34,515
Minnie, we've been
respectable for years.

957
00:54:34,589 --> 00:54:36,022
Now we're in disgrace.

958
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,490
We might as well
make the most of it.

959
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,050
We'd be delighted
to accept.

960
00:54:40,128 --> 00:54:42,028
It's the only sensible
thing to do.

961
00:54:42,096 --> 00:54:42,994
Cornelius!

962
00:54:43,064 --> 00:54:44,929
Now, I know
a doughnut shop--

963
00:54:44,999 --> 00:54:46,990
Doughnut shop!
Certainly not!

964
00:54:47,068 --> 00:54:49,798
We want a fine dinner
in the fashionable world.

965
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:52,499
And I know
just the place--

966
00:54:52,574 --> 00:54:54,769
The Harmonia Gardens
on 1 4th Street.

967
00:54:54,842 --> 00:54:56,309
Harmonia Gardens!

968
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:57,776
But wait a minute.

969
00:54:57,845 --> 00:54:59,836
The finest food
that money can buy,

970
00:54:59,914 --> 00:55:01,779
and a lovely orchestra.
A polka contest tonight.

971
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:03,339
Dancing!

972
00:55:03,418 --> 00:55:05,215
Just ask
for Rudolph.

973
00:55:05,286 --> 00:55:07,516
Oh, we could never
go there.

974
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:09,716
It sounds marvelous!
Come, Minnie.

975
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:11,258
We'll close the shop,

976
00:55:11,326 --> 00:55:13,123
and take the whole
afternoon off.

977
00:55:13,194 --> 00:55:15,754
Oh, I mean,
we could never.

978
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:16,888
Don't misunderstand.

979
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:18,728
It isn't money,
or anything.

980
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,933
It's the...the...

981
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:23,557
What, Mr. Hackl?

982
00:55:23,635 --> 00:55:24,932
It's the dancing.

983
00:55:25,003 --> 00:55:26,402
You see, I don't know how,

984
00:55:26,471 --> 00:55:28,268
and they have contests
and things like that

985
00:55:28,339 --> 00:55:30,239
at Harmonia
Whatever-it-is.

986
00:55:30,308 --> 00:55:32,071
You said so
yourself.

987
00:55:32,143 --> 00:55:33,542
It would take me
weeks, months,

988
00:55:33,611 --> 00:55:35,772
years to learn.

989
00:55:35,847 --> 00:55:37,815
''Mrs. Dolly Levi.

990
00:55:37,882 --> 00:55:39,941

chief clerks

992
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:43,514
Now, you just put
one arm here

993
00:55:43,588 --> 00:55:44,850
and one arm there.

994
00:55:44,923 --> 00:55:46,254
It's no use.

995
00:55:46,324 --> 00:55:47,723
I have absolutely
no sense of rhythm.

996
00:55:47,792 --> 00:55:49,487
Absolutely no sense
of rhythm

997
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:51,153
is one of the primary
requirements

998
00:55:51,229 --> 00:55:53,220
for learning
by the Levi method.

999
00:55:53,298 --> 00:55:55,266
Just give me 5 minutes
of your time, Mr. Hackl.

1000
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,766
I'll have you dancing
in the streets.

1001
00:55:56,835 --> 00:56:00,100
I think we'll start
with lesson 7.

1002
00:56:00,171 --> 00:56:01,968
Right foot, touch,
left foot, touch,

1003
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,473
under, back around,
touch.

1004
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:05,372
Back through around,
out, over, release,

1005
00:56:05,443 --> 00:56:07,468
unfurl, oh, oh.

1006
00:56:07,545 --> 00:56:10,241
That's wonderful,
Mr. Hackl.

1007
00:56:10,315 --> 00:56:11,805
When I think
of the lucky women

1008
00:56:11,883 --> 00:56:13,714

in your arms--

1009

back to lesson one,

1010

1011

to see the parade.

Oh, Dolly, the world is full
of such wonderful things.

Hurry, before

1062
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,469
Yes, I will.

1065
01:07:11,821 --> 01:07:14,915
Ephraim, let me go.

1066
01:07:16,626 --> 01:07:19,094
It's been long enough,
Ephraim.

1067
01:07:21,097 --> 01:07:24,464
Every night,
just like you'd want me to,

1068
01:07:24,533 --> 01:07:26,967
I've put out the cat,

1069
01:07:27,036 --> 01:07:29,470
made myself
a rum toddy,

1070
01:07:29,538 --> 01:07:32,371
and before I went to bed,
said a little prayer

1071
01:07:32,441 --> 01:07:35,877
thanking God
that I was independent,

1072
01:07:35,945 --> 01:07:41,542
that no one else's life
was mixed up with mine.

1073
01:07:43,586 --> 01:07:46,054
But lately, Ephraim...

1074
01:07:46,989 --> 01:07:49,048
I've begun
to realize that...

1075
01:07:50,493 --> 01:07:53,394
for a long time...

1076
01:07:53,462 --> 01:07:56,397
I have not shed one tear.

1077
01:07:57,667 --> 01:08:00,067
Nor have I been for one...

1078
01:08:00,136 --> 01:08:02,400
moment...

1079
01:08:02,471 --> 01:08:04,564
outrageously happy.

1080
01:08:06,075 --> 01:08:08,009
Now, Horace Vandergelder,

1081
01:08:08,077 --> 01:08:10,045
he's always saying,

1082
01:08:10,112 --> 01:08:12,512
''The world
is full of fools,''

1083
01:08:12,581 --> 01:08:14,412
and in a way,
he's right, isn't he?

1084
01:08:14,483 --> 01:08:17,452
I mean, himself, Cornelius,
Irene, myself.

1085
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,919
But there comes a time

1086
01:08:18,988 --> 01:08:21,422
when you have got
to decide

1087
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:23,890
whether you want to be
a fool among fools...

1088
01:08:23,959 --> 01:08:26,018
or a fool alone.

1089
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:30,399
Well, I have made
that decision, Ephraim,

1090
01:08:30,466 --> 01:08:34,368
but I would feel
so much better about it if--

1091
01:08:34,437 --> 01:08:36,871
If you could just
give me a sign--

1092
01:08:36,939 --> 01:08:39,499
any kind of a sign
that you approve.

1093
01:08:39,575 --> 01:08:41,475
I'm going back, Ephraim.

1094
01:08:41,544 --> 01:08:44,877
I've decided to join
the human race again.

1095
01:08:44,947 --> 01:08:47,381
And, Ephraim...

1096
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:50,385
I want you to give me away.

Very exclusive.

after such
a long absence.

It's too happy
to be true.

That's the message
he told me to you.

If you're gonna spend

a scared rabbit,

maybe I better order
some lettuce.

How can you be
so brave?

It's not fair.

Just try to remember
Mrs. Levi's advice.

I only wanted
to marry you,

I ever been wrong?

1458
01:42:04,752 --> 01:42:06,720
that Mrs. Levi
said about me--

1459
01:42:06,788 --> 01:42:08,688
Oh, yes.

1460
01:42:08,756 --> 01:42:10,724
Well...

1461
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:12,692
they're just not so.

1462
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:14,125
Indeed?

1463
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:18,931
Irene, I'm not rich.

1464
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,524
Not rich?

1465
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:23,968
I'm none of the things
Mrs. Levi said I was.

1466
01:42:24,038 --> 01:42:25,699
And neither is Barnaby.

1467
01:42:25,773 --> 01:42:28,003
We're not sports.
We don't know anybody.

1468
01:42:28,076 --> 01:42:30,010
We never come to New York.

1469
01:42:30,078 --> 01:42:31,477
We never do anything

1470
01:42:31,546 --> 01:42:34,140
except work all day
and clean the store at night.

1471
01:42:34,215 --> 01:42:36,308
And we wanted so much

1472
01:42:36,384 --> 01:42:39,182
to have one day
of adventure,

1473
01:42:39,253 --> 01:42:40,914
that we ran away
from Yonkers

1474
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:43,821
and told a lot of lies.

1475
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:45,324
Well, look at us,

1476
01:42:45,393 --> 01:42:48,487
a pair of penniless
pretenders.

1477
01:42:48,563 --> 01:42:49,495
But, Cornelius,

1478
01:42:49,564 --> 01:42:51,293
I've known that
all along.

1479
01:42:51,366 --> 01:42:52,560
You have?

1480
01:42:52,633 --> 01:42:55,898
Why else would you two
have hidden?

1481
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:58,029
And made us walk
all over New York?

1482
01:42:58,106 --> 01:43:01,803
You're the nicest ladies
a man ever went to jail for.

1483
01:43:01,876 --> 01:43:03,173
Jail?

1484
01:43:03,244 --> 01:43:06,372
We don't have money
for this dinner!

1485
01:43:06,447 --> 01:43:08,347
Of course you don't.

1486
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:09,610
Minnie,

1487
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:12,585
show these 2 sports
what I've got in my purse.

1488
01:43:12,653 --> 01:43:14,883
What a pleasure to know

1489
01:43:14,956 --> 01:43:17,390
that selling
all those silly hats

1490
01:43:17,458 --> 01:43:21,121
can pay for an evening
as delightful as this one.

1491
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:25,393
Oh, I can't help myself!.

1492
01:43:28,703 --> 01:43:29,795
Wow!

1493
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:36,173
Oh! I--hah!

1494
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:40,309
No, no, Minnie,
my white handbag,

1495
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:41,973
not that one.

1496
01:43:43,384 --> 01:43:44,851
My white handbag.

1497
01:43:44,919 --> 01:43:47,319
When we changed
for the evening.

1498
01:43:47,388 --> 01:43:48,821
Oh!

1499
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:50,323
Minnie!

1500
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:52,359
Only my mad money--

1501
01:43:52,427 --> 01:43:55,055
A nickel
for the horse car.

1502
01:43:57,432 --> 01:44:00,492
Would you like
your check now, sir?

1503
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:10,605
Take this away,
my good man.

1504
01:44:10,678 --> 01:44:13,112
Bring us another bottle
of champagne.

1505
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:23,215
What's this?
What are you doing?

1506
01:44:23,291 --> 01:44:24,883
It's 8:00,
Mr. Vandergelder.

1507
01:44:24,959 --> 01:44:26,756
I really
must be going.

1508
01:44:26,828 --> 01:44:28,125
Going?

1509
01:44:28,196 --> 01:44:30,858
You haven't finished
your dinner yet.

1510
01:44:30,932 --> 01:44:32,297
That's
expensive food.

1511
01:44:32,366 --> 01:44:34,334
If I ordered
that every night,

1512
01:44:34,402 --> 01:44:35,994
I'd be
out of business!

1513
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:38,061
I suggest you have
the waiter put it in a bag

1514
01:44:38,139 --> 01:44:41,040
and take it home to Yonkers
to your horses and pigs.

1515
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:43,099
I don't have pigs,
Miss Simple,

1516
01:44:43,177 --> 01:44:44,576
I have chickens.

1517
01:44:44,645 --> 01:44:47,170
I didn't get them
by being wasteful!

1518
01:44:47,248 --> 01:44:50,308
I see no point in this
trivial discussion,

1519
01:44:50,384 --> 01:44:53,080
nor in my remaining
here any longer,

1520
01:44:53,154 --> 01:44:56,612
in as much as it is
quite clear that you are--

1521
01:44:56,691 --> 01:44:58,625
If you forgive
the expression--

1522
01:44:58,693 --> 01:45:00,354
Entirely unsuitable.

1523
01:45:00,428 --> 01:45:01,452
[Drops Silverware]

1524
01:45:01,529 --> 01:45:02,621
Unsuitable?

1525
01:45:02,697 --> 01:45:05,860
I assure you, I'll never
say a word to Mrs. Levi

1526
01:45:05,933 --> 01:45:07,833
about this
unfortunate evening.

1527
01:45:07,902 --> 01:45:11,360
I suggest you do likewise
when she arrives here.

1528
01:45:11,439 --> 01:45:12,963
Wait a minute!

1529
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,565
Did you say
''Arrives here''?

1530
01:45:15,643 --> 01:45:17,668
Yes, she planned
to join us at 8:00.

1531
01:45:17,745 --> 01:45:19,679
You may tell her I left

1532
01:45:19,747 --> 01:45:21,681
because I felt sick
to my stomach.

1533
01:45:21,749 --> 01:45:23,842
It's quite true,
you know.

1534
01:45:23,918 --> 01:45:25,510
Good night.

1535
01:45:29,924 --> 01:45:32,085
Any man who goes
to a big city

1536
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,218
deserves
what happens to him.

1537
01:45:44,405 --> 01:45:46,100
He's all yours, honey.

1538
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:47,572
Good. Mr. Cassidy?

1539
01:45:47,642 --> 01:45:49,075
Yes, Mrs. Levi?

1540
01:45:49,143 --> 01:45:50,940
It's all right now.
You can let me out.

1541
01:45:55,383 --> 01:45:56,975
Whoa!

1542
01:45:58,398 --> 01:46:00,730
Mr. Reisenweber,
come here. Hurry!

1543
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,199
Shh.
How many times

1544
01:46:02,268 --> 01:46:03,860
have I told you
not to shout?

1545
01:46:03,936 --> 01:46:05,267
It's her.
She's outside!

1546
01:46:05,338 --> 01:46:06,236
What's going on?

1547
01:46:06,305 --> 01:46:07,272
Are you sure?

1548
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:09,240
I know that voice.
I heard her.

1549
01:46:09,308 --> 01:46:11,367
In a beautiful carriage
with two horses.

1550
01:46:11,444 --> 01:46:12,911
That's her.
She's come!

1551
01:46:12,979 --> 01:46:14,412
Who? Who's come?

1552
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,607
You wouldn't know her.
Mrs. Levi.

1553
01:46:19,218 --> 01:46:20,617
Is it true?

1554
01:46:20,686 --> 01:46:21,744
Yes. It's Dolly!

1555
01:46:21,821 --> 01:46:23,152
Tell the band
to get ready.

1556
01:46:23,222 --> 01:46:24,416
You saw her?

1557
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:26,424
Yes. She was in
a white carriage

1558
01:46:26,492 --> 01:46:27,925
pulled
by four horses!

1559
01:46:27,994 --> 01:46:30,019
It's like
old times!

1560
01:46:30,129 --> 01:46:31,960
Mr. Reisenweber!

1561
01:46:32,031 --> 01:46:33,430
Rudolph!

1562
01:46:33,499 --> 01:46:36,957
Rudy!

1563
01:46:37,036 --> 01:46:38,594
She is here.

1564
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:30,066
Tell it to me sweet!

1565
01:50:49,889 --> 01:50:52,414
I think you did,
Stanley.

1566
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:31,119
Look who's here.

1567
01:52:33,596 --> 01:52:34,688
Hello, Louis.

1568
01:52:40,437 --> 01:52:42,428
I am so glad
to be back.

1569
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:45,371
Thank you,
Louis.

1570
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:48,702
Does it show?

1571
01:54:20,837 --> 01:54:21,769
- Wow!
- Wow!

1572
01:55:04,147 --> 01:55:06,911
One more time!

1573
01:55:18,962 --> 01:55:21,021
Horace Vandergelder.

1574
01:55:22,932 --> 01:55:25,799
Do we know
each other?

1575
01:55:25,868 --> 01:55:27,267
Much too well.

1576
01:55:27,337 --> 01:55:29,965
Oh, it's you,
Mrs. Levi.

1577
01:55:30,039 --> 01:55:32,473
Yes.

1578
01:55:32,542 --> 01:55:34,874
Well, do you, um...

1579
01:55:34,944 --> 01:55:37,879
do you think
you have the figure

1580
01:55:37,947 --> 01:55:39,881
for that
sort of get-up?

1581
01:55:39,949 --> 01:55:41,883
That's for others to say.

1582
01:55:41,951 --> 01:55:43,350
I borrowed it
from a friend,

1583
01:55:43,419 --> 01:55:45,011
not being one
of those rich ladies

1584
01:55:45,088 --> 01:55:47,079
who have nothing better
to do with their time

1585
01:55:47,156 --> 01:55:48,885
than dilly-dally
with seamstresses.

1586
01:55:48,958 --> 01:55:50,926
Which reminds me,
where is Miss Simple?

1587
01:55:50,994 --> 01:55:52,427
Miss Simple?

1588
01:55:52,495 --> 01:55:53,393
Yes.

1589
01:55:53,463 --> 01:55:55,897
Well, she had to, uh...

1590
01:55:55,965 --> 01:55:58,900
She got called away
by a sick friend.

1591
01:55:58,968 --> 01:56:00,902
Oh, well,
that's Ernestina--

1592
01:56:00,970 --> 01:56:02,904
Always thinking
of other people.

1593
01:56:02,972 --> 01:56:05,907
We'll just have to
make do without her

1594
01:56:05,975 --> 01:56:07,875
for the time being.
Rudolph.

1595
01:56:07,944 --> 01:56:08,911
My dear Mrs. Levi!

1596
01:56:08,978 --> 01:56:10,377
I've saved the best
table for you.

1597
01:56:10,446 --> 01:56:11,640
How I've missed you,
Rudolph!

1598
01:56:11,714 --> 01:56:12,908
This way, please.

1599
01:56:12,982 --> 01:56:14,347
Come along,
Mr. Vandergelder.

1600
01:56:14,417 --> 01:56:15,850
Don't stand here.

1601
01:56:15,918 --> 01:56:18,887
You'll get run over
by a waiter.

1602
01:56:18,955 --> 01:56:20,889
Oh, hello!
How are you?

1603
01:56:20,957 --> 01:56:22,891
Hi! Nice to see you!

1604
01:56:22,959 --> 01:56:24,358
You know
too many people.

1605
01:56:24,427 --> 01:56:25,416
Total strangers.

1606
01:56:25,495 --> 01:56:26,962
Then why
do you greet them?

1607
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:29,362
It feels good to have
so many friends.

1608
01:56:29,432 --> 01:56:31,400
Say hello
for me, too.

1609
01:56:31,467 --> 01:56:32,866
I already did.
Lovely, Rudolph.

1610
01:56:32,935 --> 01:56:34,926
What are we doing
down here?

1611
01:56:35,004 --> 01:56:36,938
There's someone in
the dance competition

1612
01:56:37,006 --> 01:56:38,371
I especially
want you to see.

1613
01:56:38,441 --> 01:56:41,376
Rudolph, this is
Mr. Vandergelder,

1614
01:56:41,444 --> 01:56:43,912
Yonkers' most
influential citizen.

1615
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:45,379
We've already met.

1616
01:56:45,448 --> 01:56:46,813
He insists on
buying the finest.

1617
01:56:46,883 --> 01:56:47,907
I never said
any such thing.

1618
01:56:47,984 --> 01:56:48,882
Unfortunately,

1619
01:56:48,951 --> 01:56:49,918
I'm watching
my waistline.

1620
01:56:49,986 --> 01:56:51,920
Can't eat a thing.

1621
01:56:51,988 --> 01:56:53,387
What's ready
immediately?

1622
01:56:53,456 --> 01:56:54,889
You ordered chicken--

1623
01:56:54,957 --> 01:56:56,925
I couldn't
face a chicken.

1624
01:56:56,993 --> 01:56:58,824
Not after what
I've been through.

1625
01:56:58,895 --> 01:57:00,328
Cancel the chicken.

1626
01:57:00,396 --> 01:57:02,330
And bring a turkey!

1627
01:57:02,398 --> 01:57:04,332
With everything
on the side!

1628
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:06,834
Now, tell me about
you and Ernestina.

1629
01:57:06,903 --> 01:57:09,838
It was short,
but was it sweet?

1630
01:57:09,906 --> 01:57:13,467
I mean,
did it go well?

1631
01:57:13,543 --> 01:57:16,603
You have a habit of asking
highly personal questions.

1632
01:57:16,679 --> 01:57:19,477
If you're thinking
of getting married,

1633
01:57:19,549 --> 01:57:22,484
you must learn to
let women be women.

1634
01:57:22,552 --> 01:57:25,569
Did you like her?
Did she like you?

1635
01:57:25,703 --> 01:57:28,900
Always putting your nose
into other people's affairs!

1636
01:57:28,972 --> 01:57:33,375
Anybody who lived with you
would get as nervous as a cat!

1637
01:57:33,444 --> 01:57:34,433
What?

1638
01:57:34,511 --> 01:57:35,876
Anybody who lived
with you--

1639
01:57:35,946 --> 01:57:38,915
Get that idea
out of your head

1640
01:57:38,982 --> 01:57:39,949
this minute!

1641
01:57:40,017 --> 01:57:41,951
Why, the idea
of you

1642
01:57:42,019 --> 01:57:43,987
even mentioning
such a thing!

1643
01:57:44,054 --> 01:57:47,046
I have no intention
of marrying you!

1644
01:57:47,124 --> 01:57:48,853
I didn't mean that!

1645
01:57:48,926 --> 01:57:50,757
You've been hinting
for some time now,

1646
01:57:50,828 --> 01:57:53,353
so put those ideas
out of your head!

1647
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:55,796
That's not what
I meant at all!

1648
01:57:55,866 --> 01:57:57,094
I should hope not!

1649
01:57:57,167 --> 01:57:58,464
You go your way
and I'll go mine.

1650
01:57:58,535 --> 01:57:59,797
You can't
turn my head

1651
01:57:59,870 --> 01:58:01,269
with chocolate
covered peanuts--

1652
01:58:01,338 --> 01:58:02,305
Unshelled!

1653
01:58:02,372 --> 01:58:03,805
The idea
of you even

1654
01:58:03,874 --> 01:58:05,535
suggesting
such a thing!

1655
01:58:05,609 --> 01:58:06,906
You misunderstood me!

1656
01:58:06,977 --> 01:58:10,037
I certainly hope so.
Let's not discuss it.

1657
01:58:10,114 --> 01:58:11,547
Here's our food.

1658
01:58:11,615 --> 01:58:13,515
I don't feel well.

1659
01:58:13,584 --> 01:58:16,519
Here is a lovely,
lovely wing for you,

1660
01:58:16,587 --> 01:58:19,750
and some dumplings,
lighter than air.

1661
01:58:19,823 --> 01:58:22,257
That's what I need--
some air.

1662
01:58:22,326 --> 01:58:23,918
And some giblets.

1663
01:58:23,994 --> 01:58:26,724
Very tender and
very good for you.

1664
01:58:26,797 --> 01:58:29,197
You go your way,
I'll go mine.

1665
01:58:29,266 --> 01:58:30,665
Have some wine.
You'll feel better.

1666
01:58:30,734 --> 01:58:32,429
Since you brought
this matter up,

1667
01:58:32,503 --> 01:58:34,869
I have one more
thing to say.

1668
01:58:34,938 --> 01:58:37,600
I didn't bring
the matter up!

1669
01:58:37,674 --> 01:58:40,165
True, I like to
manage things,

1670
01:58:40,244 --> 01:58:41,711
but nothing
as disorderly

1671
01:58:41,779 --> 01:58:43,269
as your household,

1672
01:58:43,347 --> 01:58:45,281
as out of control,
as untidy--

1673
01:58:45,349 --> 01:58:47,283
Do that
for yourself.

1674
01:58:47,351 --> 01:58:49,319
It's not
out of control!

1675
01:58:49,386 --> 01:58:51,377
Let's not say
another word about it.

1676
01:58:51,455 --> 01:58:52,854
Have some beets.

1677
01:58:52,923 --> 01:58:55,153
I don't like beets!

1678
01:58:55,225 --> 01:58:57,455
A complaining,
friendless soul like you

1679
01:58:57,528 --> 01:59:00,395
is no sort of
companion for me.

1680
01:59:00,464 --> 01:59:01,590
Stop saying that.

1681
01:59:01,665 --> 01:59:03,189
I'm finished.

1682
01:59:03,267 --> 01:59:05,098
I'm not those things
you said I am!

1683
01:59:05,169 --> 01:59:06,636
Maybe, but you are
the only person

1684
01:59:06,703 --> 01:59:07,897
in the world
that knows it.

1685
01:59:07,971 --> 01:59:08,938
No, Horace,

1686
01:59:09,006 --> 01:59:10,940
I have decided
to enjoy life.

1687
01:59:11,008 --> 01:59:12,908
You can find
some housekeeper

1688
01:59:12,976 --> 01:59:14,170
who'll prepare
three meals

1689
01:59:14,244 --> 01:59:15,233
for a dollar a day.
It can be done

1690
01:59:15,312 --> 01:59:16,609
if you like
cold beans--

1691
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:18,307
I can see you now
spending your last days

1692
01:59:18,382 --> 01:59:19,906
listening
at keyholes,

1693
01:59:19,983 --> 01:59:22,451
for fear somebody's
cheating you.

1694
01:59:22,519 --> 01:59:24,419
Have
some more beets.

1695
01:59:24,488 --> 01:59:25,921
I hate beets!

1696
01:59:25,989 --> 01:59:27,752
That's the difference
between us.

1697
01:59:27,825 --> 01:59:29,850
I've been nagging you
all day long

1698
01:59:29,927 --> 01:59:30,916
to get some spirit
into you.

1699
01:59:30,994 --> 01:59:33,224
You could be
a perfectly charming,

1700
01:59:33,297 --> 01:59:34,958
witty, amiable man
if you wanted to.

1701
01:59:35,032 --> 01:59:37,193
I don't want
to be charming!

1702
01:59:37,267 --> 01:59:39,428
But you are!
Look at you!

1703
01:59:39,503 --> 01:59:40,663
You can't
help yourself.

1704
01:59:40,737 --> 01:59:41,897
''Listening
at keyholes.''

1705
01:59:41,972 --> 01:59:44,736
You have no right
to say such things to me.

1706
01:59:44,808 --> 01:59:46,833
At your age, you ought
to enjoy the truth.

1707
01:59:46,910 --> 01:59:49,708
My age. You're always
talking about my age!

1708
01:59:49,780 --> 01:59:51,372
I don't even know
what your age is,

1709
01:59:51,448 --> 01:59:53,177
but with bad food
and bad temper,

1710
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:54,945
you'll double it
in six months.

1711
01:59:55,018 --> 01:59:57,145
Now sit down,
Horace!

1712
01:59:57,221 --> 01:59:59,382
However, there's
one more thing--

1713
01:59:59,456 --> 02:00:01,924
I don't want to hear it!
You're wasting your time.

1714
02:00:01,992 --> 02:00:04,358
I have no intention
of asking you to marry me!

1715
02:00:04,428 --> 02:00:06,988
Oh, so you want me
to ask you?

1716
02:00:07,064 --> 02:00:09,032
Sorry.
I'm turning you down.

1717
02:00:09,099 --> 02:00:11,431
How can you?
I haven't asked!

1718
02:00:11,501 --> 02:00:15,460
It's no use arguing.
Let me cut your wings.

1719
02:00:15,539 --> 02:00:18,099
I don't want
my wings cut!

1720
02:00:18,175 --> 02:00:19,733
No man does.

1721
02:00:19,810 --> 02:00:21,937
I've got a headache.
I'm leaving.

1722
02:00:22,012 --> 02:00:22,979
You can't.

1723
02:00:23,046 --> 02:00:24,911
The dance competition's
about to begin.

1724
02:00:25,249 --> 02:00:26,944
Ladies and gentlemen,

1725
02:00:27,017 --> 02:00:29,918
if I may have
your attention please!

1726
02:00:29,987 --> 02:00:32,717
It is my pleasure to announce
on behalf of the management

that our dance contest
is about to commence!

1729

tonight's competition are--

Sit down!

If you wish to participate
in this evening's contest,

02:01:14,564 --> 02:01:15,997
come to the dance floor.

1740
02:01:16,066 --> 02:01:18,296
Remember, to the lucky
winning couple

1741
02:01:18,368 --> 02:01:21,269
goes the grand prize
of 50 silver dollars

1742
02:01:21,338 --> 02:01:24,273
or an engagement at
the Harmonia Gardens!

Your check, sir.

1747
02:01:35,852 --> 02:01:37,945
Another bottle
of champagne.

1748

Look at that man,
Horace!

1749
02:02:06,984 --> 02:02:08,952
What grace,
what talent,

1750
02:02:09,019 --> 02:02:10,418
what a magnificent
living

1751
02:02:10,487 --> 02:02:12,318
he could earn
with his feet!

1752
02:02:12,389 --> 02:02:13,481
Horace, look.

1753
02:02:13,557 --> 02:02:15,320
- Where?
- There.

1754
02:02:18,662 --> 02:02:20,095
Wait a minute.

1755
02:02:20,163 --> 02:02:22,063
Oh, isn't he wonderful!

1756
02:02:22,132 --> 02:02:25,033
That's Ambrose Kemper,
the so-called artist.

1757
02:02:25,102 --> 02:02:27,229
Why, so it is.

1758
02:02:27,304 --> 02:02:29,772
No wonder his pictures
are so awful.

1759
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:31,239
He must paint
with his feet.

1760
02:02:31,308 --> 02:02:32,366
He's sure to win
first prize.

1761
02:02:32,442 --> 02:02:33,773
Ermengarde
should see him now,

02:02:33,844 --> 02:02:35,812
dancing with
another girl.

1763
02:02:35,879 --> 02:02:38,109

Look! There's
that Molloy woman

1767
02:02:53,864 --> 02:02:55,422
dancing with a man!

1768
02:02:55,499 --> 02:02:57,524
I think it's a man.

Oh, I agree.

1774
02:03:08,011 --> 02:03:10,241
People like us

a good example.

02:03:27,781 --> 02:03:28,748
Oh.

1779
02:03:28,816 --> 02:03:30,647
Excuse me.

1780
02:03:36,423 --> 02:03:38,550
Ermengarde!

1781
02:03:39,827 --> 02:03:40,885
Uncle.

1782
02:03:40,961 --> 02:03:42,428
My niece!

1783
02:03:42,496 --> 02:03:44,157
Aah!

1784
02:03:45,099 --> 02:03:47,932
You are a disgrace
to Yonkers!

1785
02:03:48,001 --> 02:03:49,400
Stop that!

1786
02:03:51,805 --> 02:03:54,069
Grrr!

1787
02:03:54,141 --> 02:03:55,631
Don't you dare--

1788
02:03:55,709 --> 02:03:57,301
Come here, you!

1789
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:02,048
Mr. Vandergelder,
the contest!

1790
02:04:02,116 --> 02:04:04,482
I'll show you a contest!

1791
02:04:07,321 --> 02:04:09,687
Call the police!

1792
02:04:09,757 --> 02:04:11,782
Call the police!

1793
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:16,122
Uncle Horace,
we can explain!

1794
02:04:16,196 --> 02:04:18,562
Expl--I'll give you...

1795
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:42,921
Cornelius Hackl!
What are you doing here?

1796
02:04:42,990 --> 02:04:44,924
I'm just delivering
some oats.

1797
02:04:44,992 --> 02:04:46,960
Oats? With my
former intended?

1798
02:04:47,027 --> 02:04:47,925
You're discharged!

1799
02:04:47,995 --> 02:04:50,463
You can't fire me!
I quit!

1800
02:04:50,531 --> 02:04:51,930
So do I!

1801
02:04:51,999 --> 02:04:53,933
Barnaby Tucker,
you're discharged!

1802
02:04:54,001 --> 02:04:56,595
You can't fire me!
I quit!

1803
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:08,538
I'm sorry.

1804
02:05:17,524 --> 02:05:18,616
Grrr!

1805
02:05:25,465 --> 02:05:26,557
Oh!

1806
02:05:29,136 --> 02:05:30,899
Horace Vandergelder,

1807
02:05:30,971 --> 02:05:34,566
flat on your back,
you are still charming.

1808
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:37,943
Cornelius.

1809
02:05:38,011 --> 02:05:39,876
Barnaby.

1810
02:05:39,947 --> 02:05:43,439
Perhaps there's a way
I can get Mr. Vandergelder

1811
02:05:43,517 --> 02:05:45,951
to give you back
your jobs.

1812
02:05:46,019 --> 02:05:48,078
What? How?

1813
02:05:49,523 --> 02:05:52,083
I could become his wife.

1814
02:05:55,095 --> 02:05:56,528
No, that's impossible.

1815
02:05:56,597 --> 02:05:57,825
It is?

1816
02:05:57,898 --> 02:05:59,092
Yes.

1817
02:05:59,166 --> 02:06:00,827
But why,
Cornelius?

1818
02:06:00,901 --> 02:06:03,495
Because...
That's why.

1819
02:06:03,570 --> 02:06:05,162
Give me a reason.

1820
02:06:05,239 --> 02:06:06,399
Never mind the reason!

1821
02:06:06,473 --> 02:06:07,405
Shhh!

1822
02:06:07,474 --> 02:06:08,441
And don't tell me
to shush.

1823
02:06:08,508 --> 02:06:09,600
What's going on?

1824
02:06:09,676 --> 02:06:11,507
- Cornelius!
- Irene!

1825
02:06:11,578 --> 02:06:14,775
Hey, you, what's
all this noise?

1826
02:06:14,848 --> 02:06:16,338
What's happening here?

1827
02:06:16,416 --> 02:06:18,441
Now you stay out
of this, Officer!

1828
02:06:18,518 --> 02:06:19,576
Are you all right, miss?

1829
02:06:19,653 --> 02:06:21,018
I'll let you know
in a little while.

1830
02:06:21,088 --> 02:06:23,886
I'm only trying to tell
this lady something.

1831
02:06:23,957 --> 02:06:25,356
It's too late,
and you're too loud,

1832
02:06:25,425 --> 02:06:26,892
you're disturbing
the peace!

1833
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:29,394
No, it's not too late!

1834
02:06:29,463 --> 02:06:31,363
That's why I'm shouting!

1835
02:06:31,431 --> 02:06:34,400
28 years, my whole life,
I never did anything!

1836
02:06:34,468 --> 02:06:36,402
I just worked,
took orders,

1837
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:37,903
never went anywhere.

1838
02:06:37,971 --> 02:06:39,598
Stayed in Yonkers!

1839
02:06:39,673 --> 02:06:40,662
Yonkers?

1840
02:06:40,741 --> 02:06:43,403
And today,
the most important thing

1841
02:06:43,477 --> 02:06:45,911
that can happen to a man

1842
02:06:45,979 --> 02:06:48,914
happened to me
because I left Yonkers

1843
02:06:48,982 --> 02:06:50,882
and came to New York

1844
02:06:50,951 --> 02:06:55,388
and met this lady
this afternoon.

1845
02:06:55,455 --> 02:06:59,186
Mister--Just what
are you talkin' about?

1846
02:06:59,259 --> 02:07:00,385
Officer,

1847
02:07:00,460 --> 02:07:04,920
I'm talking about
none other than love.

1848
02:07:04,998 --> 02:07:05,930
Love?

1849
02:07:05,999 --> 02:07:07,330
Love?

1850
02:07:07,401 --> 02:07:11,337
Are you telling me that
after 28 years in Yonkers

1851
02:07:11,405 --> 02:07:14,863
you've fallen in love
with this lady in one day?

1852
02:07:14,942 --> 02:07:17,376
No, I didn't
fall in love

1853
02:07:17,444 --> 02:07:18,843
in just a day.

1854
02:07:18,912 --> 02:07:21,005
It was much quicker
than that.

1855
02:07:21,081 --> 02:07:23,379
An hour--No, even
that's too long!

1856
02:07:23,450 --> 02:07:24,849
What's less
than a minute?

1857
02:07:24,918 --> 02:07:25,850
A second?

1858
02:07:25,919 --> 02:07:26,851
Less than that.

1859
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:28,353
A moment.

1860
02:07:28,422 --> 02:07:30,856
That's it!
That is it!

1861
02:07:30,924 --> 02:07:34,860
Now all of you,
listen to me...

1862
02:07:34,928 --> 02:07:37,522
please.

1863
02:09:01,381 --> 02:09:04,316
Isn't the world
full of wonderful things?

1864
02:09:04,384 --> 02:09:06,579
I have lost
so many things.

1865
02:09:06,653 --> 02:09:08,587
My job, my future--

1866
02:09:08,655 --> 02:09:11,317
Everything that people
think is important,

1867
02:09:11,391 --> 02:09:12,824
but I don't care!

1868
02:09:12,893 --> 02:09:14,622
Even if I have
to dig ditches

1869
02:09:14,694 --> 02:09:15,900
for the rest of my life,

1870
02:09:16,034 --> 02:09:20,835
I'll be a ditch digger
who once had a wonderful day!

1871
02:09:20,905 --> 02:09:22,805
Mister, do you mind?

1872
02:09:22,874 --> 02:09:24,808
I came in late.

1873
02:09:24,876 --> 02:09:27,674
Right after...

1874
02:11:30,768 --> 02:11:31,666
Tell Rudolph

1875
02:11:31,736 --> 02:11:33,795
not to worry
about the damage.

1876
02:11:33,871 --> 02:11:35,304
Send the bill

1877
02:11:35,373 --> 02:11:37,841
to Vandergelder's
Hay and Feed Store,

1878
02:11:37,909 --> 02:11:39,638
Yonkers, New York.

1879
02:11:39,710 --> 02:11:42,304
There's your life
for you, Horace.

1880
02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:44,848
I don't want
to hear about it!

1881
02:11:44,916 --> 02:11:46,850
Without niece,
bride, clerks.

1882
02:11:46,918 --> 02:11:48,943
I'm tired.
I've got a backache.

1883
02:11:49,020 --> 02:11:50,453
That's about
all you do have.

1884
02:11:50,521 --> 02:11:51,681
I hope you're
satisfied.

1885
02:11:51,756 --> 02:11:52,723
Never mind.

1886
02:11:52,790 --> 02:11:55,350
I guess there's only
one thing more

1887
02:11:55,426 --> 02:11:56,916
for me to say.

1888
02:11:56,994 --> 02:11:59,224
If it's to ask me
to marry you,

1889
02:11:59,297 --> 02:12:00,855
never,
not in a million years!

1890
02:12:00,932 --> 02:12:03,264
It wasn't that
at all, Horace.

1891
02:12:03,334 --> 02:12:05,768
All I wanted
to say was...

1892
02:12:07,838 --> 02:12:08,770
What?

1893
02:12:10,041 --> 02:12:11,099
What are you
talking about?

1894
02:12:19,517 --> 02:12:20,916
Nonsense!

1895
02:12:20,985 --> 02:12:22,816
Don't try to stop me!

1896
02:13:37,862 --> 02:13:41,457
And on those cold
winter nights, Horace...

1897
02:13:45,903 --> 02:13:49,964
you can snuggle up
to your cash register.

1898
02:13:53,377 --> 02:13:56,938
It's a little lumpy,
but it rings.

1899
02:14:26,911 --> 02:14:29,436
[Gasping]

1900
02:14:44,362 --> 02:14:45,829
[JingleJingle]

1901
02:14:45,896 --> 02:14:47,295
[Woof]

1902
02:14:47,365 --> 02:14:49,458
[Woof Woof]

1903
02:14:54,405 --> 02:14:56,305
Quiet!

1904
02:14:56,374 --> 02:14:58,899
Quiet down there,
you little monsters.

1905
02:14:58,976 --> 02:15:01,001
Cornelius! Barnaby!

1906
02:15:02,947 --> 02:15:05,347
Do you hear me down there?

1907
02:15:05,416 --> 02:15:07,350
Ermengarde!

1908
02:15:07,418 --> 02:15:09,852
What the devil is this?

1909
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:13,014
What's this chicken mash
doing all over?

1910
02:15:18,863 --> 02:15:21,491
Cornelius! Barnaby!

1911
02:15:21,565 --> 02:15:25,695
Get up here this minute
and clean up this mess!

1912
02:15:31,976 --> 02:15:33,375
Well, good riddance.

1913
02:15:33,444 --> 02:15:37,380
I didn't need you before,
and I don't need you now!

1914
02:15:37,448 --> 02:15:38,813
Ermengarde!

1915
02:15:38,883 --> 02:15:40,874
I'm ready for
my breakfast!

1916
02:15:40,951 --> 02:15:43,920
I want three eggs
with crisp bacon,

1917
02:15:43,988 --> 02:15:45,922
hot porridge with cream,

1918
02:15:45,990 --> 02:15:47,548
and grits!

1919
02:15:53,497 --> 02:15:55,055
It's not fair.

1920
02:15:56,967 --> 02:15:58,935
It's worse than that.

1921
02:15:59,003 --> 02:16:01,062
It's lonely.

1922
02:16:07,478 --> 02:16:12,916
Not in a million years,
Dolly Levi.

1923
02:16:12,983 --> 02:16:17,579
You go your way,
and I'll go mine.

1924
02:16:22,493 --> 02:16:24,927
Good morning,
Uncle Horace.

1925
02:16:24,995 --> 02:16:26,860
Good morning,
Mr. Vandergelder.

1926
02:16:26,931 --> 02:16:28,956
Come crawling back,
have you?

1927
02:16:29,033 --> 02:16:31,968
I've a good mind
not to take you,

1928
02:16:32,036 --> 02:16:34,197
but being as how
I'm so soft-hearted,

1929
02:16:34,271 --> 02:16:36,034
start cleaning up
this mess!

1930
02:16:36,106 --> 02:16:38,574
We're not coming back
to work for you,

1931
02:16:38,642 --> 02:16:39,810
Mr. Vandergelder.

1932
02:16:39,944 --> 02:16:41,411
Barnaby and I

1933
02:16:41,478 --> 02:16:43,412
are stopping by
for our money.

1934
02:16:43,480 --> 02:16:46,142
We decided to
go into business.

1935
02:16:46,216 --> 02:16:47,649
Business!

1936
02:16:47,718 --> 02:16:49,777
And since we only
know hay and feed,

1937
02:16:49,853 --> 02:16:51,616
we're opening
our own store.

1938
02:16:51,689 --> 02:16:54,351
Mrs. Levi's found
the perfect location.

1939
02:16:54,425 --> 02:16:56,222
Across the street
from you.

1940
02:16:56,293 --> 02:16:57,453
She wouldn't dare!

1941
02:16:57,528 --> 02:17:00,588
Hackl and Tucker,
Incorporated.

1942
02:17:00,664 --> 02:17:02,723
Ha! You'll last a week.

1943
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:04,427
What about my breakfast?

1944
02:17:04,501 --> 02:17:06,992
Uncle Horace...

1945
02:17:07,071 --> 02:17:09,562
I think you'd better
start learning

1946
02:17:09,640 --> 02:17:14,407
how to make it yourself.

1947
02:17:14,478 --> 02:17:16,378
All right,
all right.

1948
02:17:16,447 --> 02:17:17,505
My conscience
is clear.

1949
02:17:17,581 --> 02:17:19,412
A man can only do so
much to keep fools

1950
02:17:19,483 --> 02:17:20,882
from their own
natural folly.

1951
02:17:20,951 --> 02:17:24,478
Why, Horace Vandergelder,
as I live and breathe.

1952
02:17:24,555 --> 02:17:27,183
How well you look today.

1953
02:17:27,257 --> 02:17:29,748
I came by
to return your cane.

1954
02:17:29,827 --> 02:17:32,819
Don't let me interrupt.
What were you doing?

1955
02:17:32,896 --> 02:17:34,864
Getting Cornelius
and Barnaby's money.

1956
02:17:34,932 --> 02:17:37,196
$1 46.3 5.

1957
02:17:37,267 --> 02:17:39,394
Plus $6.1 2 of mine.

1958
02:17:39,470 --> 02:17:41,062
And the money
my mama left me.

1959
02:17:41,138 --> 02:17:44,801
That's right.
$52.48.

1960
02:17:44,875 --> 02:17:46,740
38, idiot!

1961
02:17:46,810 --> 02:17:48,573
48, Uncle.

1962
02:17:49,747 --> 02:17:50,645
I'm positive--

1963
02:17:50,714 --> 02:17:52,614
I know, I know.

1964
02:17:52,683 --> 02:17:55,413
If all you can
think about is money,

1965
02:17:55,486 --> 02:17:58,683
the safe is upstairs!

1966
02:17:58,756 --> 02:18:00,314
Ooh!

1967
02:18:03,260 --> 02:18:05,694
And I have
the combination!

1968
02:18:05,763 --> 02:18:07,253
You stay here.

1969
02:18:07,331 --> 02:18:09,595
If you insist,
Horace.

1970
02:18:27,251 --> 02:18:31,688
Ephraim Levi,
I'm gonna get married again.

1971
02:18:31,755 --> 02:18:35,851
I'm gonna marry
Horace Vandergelder.

1972
02:18:37,795 --> 02:18:40,195
And I'm asking
your permission.

1973
02:18:40,264 --> 02:18:44,701
It won't be a marriage
in the sense that we had one,

1974
02:18:44,768 --> 02:18:47,737
but I shall certainly
make him happy.

1975
02:18:47,805 --> 02:18:50,205
You can be sure of that.

1976
02:18:50,274 --> 02:18:53,243
I am going to marry
Horace Vandergelder

1977
02:18:53,310 --> 02:18:56,245
and send his money
out into the world

1978
02:18:56,313 --> 02:18:59,180
doing all the things
you taught me.

1979
02:18:59,249 --> 02:19:01,149
As you always said, Ephraim,

1980
02:19:01,218 --> 02:19:02,651
money--
pardon the expression--

1981
02:19:02,719 --> 02:19:04,687
is like manure.

1982
02:19:04,755 --> 02:19:08,657
It's not worth a thing
unless it's spread around,

1983
02:19:08,725 --> 02:19:11,159
encouraging
young things to grow.

1984
02:19:11,228 --> 02:19:13,662
Anyhow,
that's the opinion of

1985
02:19:13,730 --> 02:19:16,665
the future
Mrs. Horace Vandergelder.

1986
02:19:16,733 --> 02:19:18,667
And, Ephraim...

1987
02:19:18,735 --> 02:19:21,898
I'm still waiting
for that sign...

1988
02:19:21,972 --> 02:19:23,837
that you approve.

1989
02:19:29,847 --> 02:19:31,314
Mr. Vandergelder--

1990
02:19:31,381 --> 02:19:32,973
Outside, front and back.

1991
02:19:40,691 --> 02:19:45,719
Bossy, scheming,
meddling, irritating,

1992
02:19:45,796 --> 02:19:48,560
inquisitive,
exasperating.

1993
02:19:48,632 --> 02:19:50,623
Horace.

1994
02:19:52,069 --> 02:19:54,469
I know you're no
longer interested,

1995
02:19:54,538 --> 02:19:57,974
but I have found you
the ideal wife.

1996
02:19:58,041 --> 02:20:01,477
Dolly Levi, I don't want you
to find me any ideal wives!

1997
02:20:01,545 --> 02:20:04,275
If I want an ideal wife,
I'll find one of my own,

1998
02:20:04,348 --> 02:20:08,341
and I have found her,
and it's you, damn it!

1999
02:20:08,418 --> 02:20:11,910
I've been a fool and
probably always will be,

2000
02:20:11,989 --> 02:20:13,923
but, Dolly,
forgive me and...

2001
02:20:13,991 --> 02:20:15,856
marry me.

2002
02:20:19,530 --> 02:20:21,430
No, Horace, I...

2003
02:20:21,498 --> 02:20:23,693
I don't dare.

2004
02:20:23,767 --> 02:20:25,928
What do you mean?

2005
02:20:26,003 --> 02:20:28,938
You know
as well as I do

2006
02:20:29,006 --> 02:20:30,940
that you're
the first citizen

2007
02:20:31,008 --> 02:20:31,940
of Yonkers.

2008
02:20:32,009 --> 02:20:34,978
Your wife would have
to be a somebody.

2009
02:20:35,045 --> 02:20:36,945
You are. You are
a wonderful woman!

2010
02:20:37,014 --> 02:20:40,450
Do you really think
I have it in me

2011
02:20:40,517 --> 02:20:43,486
to forego fancy clothes
and expensive jewels,

2012
02:20:43,554 --> 02:20:45,818
and instead be
a benefactress

2013
02:20:45,889 --> 02:20:48,289
to half the town?

2014
02:20:48,358 --> 02:20:50,588
In other words,

2015
02:20:50,661 --> 02:20:52,629
to be a credit to you?

2016
02:20:54,064 --> 02:20:55,964
Dolly, everybody knows

2017
02:20:56,033 --> 02:20:59,901
that you could do
anything you wanted to do.

2018
02:20:59,970 --> 02:21:02,404
By the way,
here's the money

2019
02:21:02,472 --> 02:21:04,406
I borrowed
from you yesterday.

2020
02:21:04,474 --> 02:21:06,237
Keep it.

2021
02:21:09,379 --> 02:21:10,812
Oh, Horace.

2022
02:21:10,881 --> 02:21:12,314
I never thought

2023
02:21:12,382 --> 02:21:17,319
I'd ever hear you
say anything like that.

2024
02:21:17,387 --> 02:21:19,321
It's bad business
letting Cornelius

2025
02:21:19,389 --> 02:21:22,209
open up a store
across the street.

2026
02:21:22,343 --> 02:21:23,708
It was your idea.

2027
02:21:23,777 --> 02:21:24,937
Make him your partner.

2028
02:21:25,012 --> 02:21:27,105
And Barnaby can have
Cornelius' old job.

2029
02:21:27,181 --> 02:21:30,378
We'll all dance at
Ermengarde's wedding.

2030
02:21:30,451 --> 02:21:33,784
You've gone too far!
I'll dance at no wedding!

2031
02:21:33,854 --> 02:21:35,082
Besides, I can't dance!

2032
02:21:35,155 --> 02:21:36,383
It'll take years
to learn.

2033
02:21:36,457 --> 02:21:37,788
All right, I'll dance.

2034
02:21:37,858 --> 02:21:39,792
Excuse me,
Mr. Vandergelder.

2035
02:21:39,860 --> 02:21:40,884
I said outside!

2036
02:21:40,961 --> 02:21:43,293
What is going on
around here?

2037
02:21:43,364 --> 02:21:47,130
I'm having the shutters
done over in forest green.

2038
02:21:48,402 --> 02:21:49,801
Forest green shutters?

2039
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:51,667
The old paint's
still good,

2040
02:21:51,739 --> 02:21:53,798
but that fella's
just set up a business

2041
02:21:53,874 --> 02:21:55,341
and needs
a good start.

2042
02:21:55,409 --> 02:21:58,071
Dolly, I've always felt
that money--

2043
02:21:58,145 --> 02:22:00,773
Pardon the expression--
is like manure.

2044
02:22:00,848 --> 02:22:02,782
It's not worth a thing

2045
02:22:02,850 --> 02:22:04,249
unless its
spread around,

2046
02:22:04,318 --> 02:22:06,752
encouraging
young things to grow.

2047
02:22:06,820 --> 02:22:09,220
Thank you, Ephraim.

2048
02:23:19,026 --> 02:23:21,085
Wonderful woman!
