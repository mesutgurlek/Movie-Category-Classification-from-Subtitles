1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:07,663
(Spike snoring loudly)

2
00:00:07,663 --> 00:00:09,149
(Twilight gasps in excitement)

3
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:12,307
Twilight: (excitedly) Spike! Wake up! Wake up! Wake 
 up! It's Winter Wrap Up Day!
(Spike snores)

4
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:15,093
Spike: (groggily) Huh...huh? Mommy?

5
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:16,672
Twilight: Winter Wrap Up!

6
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:18,669
Spike: You're not Mommy.

7
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:21,687
Twilight: Spike, the first day of spring is tomorrow,

8
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:24,543
so every pony in Ponyville needs to clean up winter.

9
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:25,844
Now help me get ready!

10
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:29,931
Spike: Clean up winter...? Who cleans up winter?

11
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:33,924
Don't they just use magic to change the seasons like they do in Canterlot?

12
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:37,082
Twilight: No, Spike. Ponyville was founded by earth ponies,

13
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:40,658
so for hundreds of years, they've never used magic to clean up winter.

14
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:42,284
It's traditional.

15
00:00:42,284 --> 00:00:43,073
(saddle falls)

16
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:44,373
(Twilight sighs)

17
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:46,184
Spike: It's ridiculous.

18
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:48,089
(derisively) No magic...feh.

19
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:52,802
Twilight: Okay, let's see.

20
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,592
Scarf, check.

21
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:55,403
Saddle, check. Boots, check.

22
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:58,096
Spike refusing to get up and going back to sleep, check.

23
00:00:58,096 --> 00:00:59,768
It's a good thing I'm so organized!

24
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,883
I'm ready!

25
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:02,369
(door slams open)
Bright and early!

26
00:01:05,086 --> 00:01:08,383
(sheepishly) Oh...maybe a little TOO early.

27
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:15,999
(theme song begins) My Little Pony, My Little Pony, ah, ah, ah, ah,

28
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:20,364
(My Little Pony) Twilight: I used to wonder what friendship could be

29
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:24,219
(My Little Pony) Until you all shared its magic with me

30
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,401
Rainbow Dash: Big adventure
Pinkie Pie: Tons of fun

31
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:28,770
Rarity: A beautiful heart
Applejack: Faithful and strong

32
00:01:28,077 --> 00:01:30,813
Fluttershy: Sharing kindness
Twilight: It's an easy feat

33
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:32,996
All: And magic makes it all complete, yeah

34
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:41,054
(My Little Pony) Do you know, you're all my very best friends

35
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,030
Twilight: Those must be the team vests Rarity designed!

36
00:01:50,295 --> 00:01:51,060
Blue for the weather team,

37
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:53,031
green for the plant team,

38
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,080
and tan for the animal team!

39
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,003
I wonder which team vest I'll be wearing.

40
00:01:57,029 --> 00:02:00,093
Spike: (sleepily) I'll take a blue vest, same color as my blanket,

41
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:03,016
which I think I hear calling my name.

44
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:14,010
Mayor: Thank you, everypony, for being here bright and early.

45
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:18,009
We need every single pony's help to wrap up winter, and bring in spring.

46
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:20,083
(ponies cheer)

47
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:24,052
(Twilight grunting in background)
Now, all of you have your 
 vests, and have been assigned to your teams.

48
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:29,044
So let's do even better than last year, and 
 have the quickest Winter Wrap Up ever!

49
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:31,072
(ponies cheer)

50
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,055
Twilight: Oh! This is so exciting!

51
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:40,045
Mayor: All right, everypony. Find your team leader...and LET'S GET GALLOPING!

52
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:44,007
(ponies chatter)
Twilight: Oh gosh, where should I go?

53
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:46,016
I'm not sure where I fit in...

54
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:50,071
What exactly does everypony do?

55
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:56,070
(Winter Wrap Up Song begins)
Rainbow Dash: Three months of winter coolness
And awesome holidays

56
00:02:56,704 --> 00:03:01,063
Pinkie Pie: We've kept our hoofsies warm at home
Time off from work to play

57
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:06,060
Applejack: But the food we've stored is runnin' 
 out
And we can't grow in this cold

58
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:12,054
Rarity: And even though I love my boots
This fashion's getting old

59
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:17,007
Twilight: The time has come to welcome spring
And all things warm and green

60
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:21,057
But it's also time to say goodbye
It's winter we must clean

61
00:03:21,572 --> 00:03:25,073
How can I help? I'm new, you see
What does everypony do?

62
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:31,067
How do I fit in without magic?
I haven't got a clue

63
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:34,069
All: Winter Wrap Up
Winter Wrap Up

64
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:38,059
Let's finish our holiday cheer
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up

65
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:42,068
'Cause tomorrow spring is here,
'Cause tomorrow spring is here

66
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:46,065
Rainbow Dash: Bringing home the southern birds
A pegasus's job begins

67
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:50,088
And clearing all the gloomy skies
To let the sunshine in

68
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:55,015
We move the clouds
And we melt the white snow

69
00:03:55,148 --> 00:04:00,016
When the sun comes up
Its warmth and beauty will glow

70
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:05,046
All: Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up
Let's finish our holiday cheer

00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:15,072
'Cause tomorrow spring is here

74
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:19,086
Rarity: Little critters hibernate
Under the snow and ice

75
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:24,003
Fluttershy: We wake up all the sleepyheads
So quietly and nice

76
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:28,054
Rarity: We help them gather up their food
Fix their homes below

77
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:34,002
Fluttershy: We welcome back the southern birds
So their families can grow

78
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,066
All: (a cappella) Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up
Let's finish our holiday cheer

00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:48,090
'Cause tomorrow spring is here

82
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:53,022
Applejack: (instrumental resumes) No easy task to clear the ground
Plant our tiny seeds

83
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:57,031
With proper care and sunshine
Everyone it feeds

84
00:04:57,308 --> 00:05:01,049
Apples, carrots, celery stalks
Colorful flowers too

85
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:05,095
We must work so very hard
(ponies harmonize) It's just so much to do

86
00:05:05,946 --> 00:05:10,031
All: Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up
Let's finish our holiday cheer

All: 'Cause tomorrow spring is here

90
00:05:20,482 --> 00:05:25,078
(tempo decreases)
Twilight: Now that I know what they 
 all do
I have to find my place

91
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:30,023
And help with all of my heart
Tough tasks ahead I face

92
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:35,085
How will I do without my magic
Help the earth pony way

93
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:40,073
(singing pitch crescendos) I want to belong so I must
Do my best today

94
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:47,000
Do my best today (tempo increases)
All: Winter Wrap Up, 
 Winter Wrap Up
Let's finish our holiday cheer

(song ends)

99
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:12,017
Twilight: Everypony belongs to a team! What should I do?

100
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:13,052
Where should I go?

101
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:16,095
Rainbow Dash: (whooshes past) All right, team, you're cleared for takeoff.

102
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:18,025
(whoosh)

103
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,022
Twilight: Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash: Oh, hey Twilight! What's up?

104
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:22,034
Twilight: What are YOU doing?

105
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:26,019
Rainbow Dash: Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve 
 the birds that have flown south for the winter.

106
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:27,096
Twilight: Oh! Can I help?

107
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,058
How about if I help clear out the clouds?

108
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:31,093
Rainbow Dash: Um... (flaps wings)

109
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:33,046
Twilight: Right...no wings.

110
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:35,018
Rainbow Dash: Sorry, Twilight.

111
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:36,048
(Rainbow Dash takes off, Twilight gasps)

112
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:40,024
Twilight: Great. Now what do we do?

113
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:44,056
Spike: I don't know about you, but I'm gonna be nappin'.

114
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:48,083
(Spike snores)
Twilight: Come on, Spike! This is serious business!

115
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:54,064
(Spike snores loudly)
Winter needs to be wrapped up, 
 and I'm determined to do my part...somehow.

116
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:05,078
Twilight: Rarity, please tell me there's something, ANYTHING I can help you with.

117
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:10,052
Rarity: Well, how would you like to help create Ponyville's FINEST birds' nests?

118
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:11,073
Twilight: Birds' nests?

119
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:16,005
Rarity: Why, yes! When the weather team guides 
 the birds back north for the spring,

120
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:18,037
they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs.

121
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:21,048
Twilight: Wow, Rarity! That one's REALLY beautiful!

122
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:23,085
Rarity: (flattered) Oh, why thank you most sincerely.

123
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:25,071
Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?

124
00:07:25,707 --> 00:07:28,068
Twilight: (eager) Would I?! Yes! Where do I begin?

125
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:33,004
Rarity: Okay, now. Take some of that straw and hay over there,

126
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:34,067
and a little bit of branch.

127
00:07:36,063 --> 00:07:38,059
Now, weave them through there, yes!
(twang)

128
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:42,008
Uh, take some ribbon, yes...ooh, uh uh, not there...(nervous) ooh, yes...

129
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:45,079
Uh, tuck it in over there, uh, but be 
 careful not to...
(Twilight bending and cracking wood)

130
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:48,095
(sweetly) I don't know, I guess that will do...(under breath) Oh dear...

131
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:54,001
Twilight: There! It looks just like...(crestfallen) yours.

132
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:57,017
Twilight: Oh my...
Spike: That nest needs to be condemned.

133
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:59,035
Rarity: (false sincerity) Oh, (giggling) Spi-hi-hi-hike!

134
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:03,062
It's not so bad! Maybe the birds can use it as a...

135
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,079
Spike: (dryly) An outhouse?

136
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:09,048
Rarity: (scoffs) Spike. (comfortingly) It's just a little rough around the edges.

137
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:10,075
Let me lend you a hoof.

138
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:15,035
Let's just unite this ribbon, and let me take 
 out these sticks here, we'll shave this...
(Twilight sighs)

139
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:17,072
(Rarity mumbling to herself)

140
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:18,074
Spike: (whispering) I think we lost her.

141
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:22,027
(Rarity talking to herself)

142
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,029
Pinkie Pie: Helloooooooo Twilight!

143
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:29,038
Pinkie Pie: Wheeeeeeee! (spins
Twilight: Wow, Pinkie Pie! You're quite the skater!

144
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,070
Twilight: Probably the best skater I've ever seen!

145
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:33,037
Pinkie Pie: Thanks, Twilight.

146
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:36,085
I've been doing this since I was an itty-bitty, little-wittle, Twinkie-Pinkie.

147
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:38,099
Just comes natural.

148
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:44,010
Which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer.

149
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:46,005
I cut lines in the lake with my skates.

150
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:50,051
That way, when the rest of the weather team comes here 
 to break the ice, it'll be easy as "Pie."

151
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:51,081
Twilight: How clever.

152
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:55,015
When the thick ice begins to melt, it'll break along the lines.

153
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:57,031
Well, you sure have a lot of work ahead of you.

154
00:08:57,031 --> 00:08:59,026
There's quite a few lakes in Ponyville.

155
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:00,093
Pinkie Pie: (scoffs) Tell me about it.

156
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:03,016
Hey, Twilight! Wanna help me out?

157
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:04,037
Twilight: Would I?!

158
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:08,050
Pinkie Pie: Come on. Put on those skates over 
 there. I bet you'll be a natural, too.

159
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:09,057
Twilight: Okay.

160
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,082
(Twilight's legs wobbling)
Pinkie Pie: WHEEEE!

161
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:15,075
Twilight: (nervously) Uh...maybe on second thought... (thud)
(Pinkie Pie laughing and giggling in background)

162
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:18,067
Spike: What are you talkin' about? You said you wanted to be helpful.

163
00:09:18,672 --> 00:09:19,079
Pinkie Pie: Yippee!

164
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:21,032
Spike: Now get out there!

165
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:24,082
Twilight: (frantic) Oh no! Whooooa, whoa!

166
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:27,031
(Twilight panicking)
Pinkie pie: Twilight! Steer!

167
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:29,063
(Twilight screams)
Pinkie Pie: Oh boy...! (grunts)

168
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:32,009
(both screaming, Spike joins in)
(crash)

169
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:37,016
(eyes pop open in turn)

170
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:38,027
(all shake snow off)

171
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:39,057
(Spike groans, Pinkie Pie trills)

172
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:42,064
Spike: (laughing) You ARE a natural, Twilight!

173
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:44,049
A natural DISASTER!

174
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:46,030
(laughing uncontrollably)

175
00:09:46,304 --> 00:09:49,056
Pinkie Pie: (reassuring) Twilight, you did a GREAT job your first time around!

176
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:54,034
I'm sure my first time was just as 
 wobbly and bobbly and crasheriffic as yours.

177
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:55,064
Twilight: Really?

178
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,031
Pinkie Pie: ...No.

179
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,034
(Spike chuckles)

180
00:09:58,344 --> 00:10:00,005
But did I make you feel better?

181
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:02,033
Twilight: (chuckles weakly) Yeah...I guess...

182
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:06,030
Pinkie Pie: I bet you'll be super awesome at 
 something that keeps your hooves on the ground.

183
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:09,055
I know! Fluttershy could probably use your help with the critters!

184
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:13,082
Twilight: Well, I'm pretty good with little animals. 
 (legs wobbling) Yeah! I'll go help her!

185
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:18,056
Pinkie Pie: Uh, it's, uh...that-a way.
(Twilight screams and crashes)

186
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:20,078
(Spike chuckles)

187
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:29,080
Fluttershy: (echoing) Wake up, little sleepyheads. I hope you 
 had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation,

188
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,046
but it's time to get up now. Spring is coming.

189
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:36,071
(hedgehogs yawn)

190
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:39,078
Twilight: Awww! How cute!

191
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:43,045
Fluttershy: Aren't they? This is my favorite task of the whole season,

192
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:46,019
when I get to see all my little animal friends again.

193
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,088
Spike: Uh, what's "hibernation?"

194
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,048
Fluttershy: It's like a long sleep.

195
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:53,006
Spike: Long sleep?

196
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:57,057
Fluttershy: Yes. (rings bell) Wake up, little porcupines.

197
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:03,018
Animals often hibernate through the winter to save their energy and eat less food.

198
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:06,002
Spike: I definitely like the idea of hibernation...

199
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:08,020
...except for the "eat less food" part.

200
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:12,015
(porcupines yawn)

201
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:13,091
(puncture sounds)

202
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:18,032
Fluttershy: Oh, but just look at all these warrens and dens.

203
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:22,018
I'm worried that I won't be able to 
 wake up every animal before spring comes.

204
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:25,004
Twilight: Well, I'll help, Fluttershy.

205
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:28,094
Fluttershy: You will? Oh, that would be wonderful.

206
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:32,051
Twilight: Okay! Let's start there.

207
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:38,008
Twilight: (rings bell, voice echoes) Hellooooo?

208
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:40,068
Wake up, little friends, wherever you are!

209
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:43,038
Spring is coming. (rings bell)

210
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,012
(gushing) I wonder what cute, little, furry creatures I've awoken.

211
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:50,028
(snakes hiss)

212
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,092
Twilight: (panicked yelp) SNAKES! SNAKES!

213
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:58,022
(Twilight screams)

214
00:11:58,216 --> 00:11:59,014
(Twilight crashes into tree, grunts)

215
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:00,054
(Twilight grunts)

216
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:03,070
(bees buzz, Twilight screams)

217
00:12:03,696 --> 00:12:05,032
(Twilight grunts)

218
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:07,046
Fluttershy: Good morning, friends.

219
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,013
(Twilight groans with echo)

220
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:14,070
Twilight: (groans) All this Winter Wrap Up stuff 
 is a lot harder than it looks...

221
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:16,093
Spike: (pinching nose) Right, because dere's no magic.

222
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:20,004
Why don't you just use magic, Twilight, and get it done the right way?

223
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:23,034
Twilight: No, Spike. I have to do it the traditional way.

224
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:26,040
Ponyville has never needed magic to wrap up winter.

225
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:28,096
Spike: (nasal) Well, dey never had you here before eider.

226
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:31,084
Fink how much quicker dey could wrab up winter with your magic.

227
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,046
Twilight: No, no, NO!

228
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:37,060
I am gonna find some other way to help out if it KILLS me!

229
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:39,087
(soup glops, Twilight grunts)

230
00:12:39,418 --> 00:12:41,017
Applejack: Keep pushin', Caramel!

231
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:43,003
That's it, punkin'.

232
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:46,098
I know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great. YEE-HAW!

233
00:12:46,978 --> 00:12:49,007
Twilight: Hey, Applejack. How's everything going?

234
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,065
Applejack: Oh, just dandy.

235
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:53,043
A little slow startin', but peachy all the same.

236
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:55,052
There's a lotta ground to clear, y'hear.

237
00:12:55,523 --> 00:12:59,070
We can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until 
 we git all this heap a'snow hightailed outta here.

238
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:01,084
Twilight: Well, I'd like to help.

239
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,072
Applejack: (stammering) W-well, I-I dunno, Twilight.

240
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,030
Twilight: (pleading) Just give me a chance!

241
00:13:06,297 --> 00:13:09,050
Applejack: Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but...

242
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:16,061
(plow creaking)

243
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:17,063
(Twilight grunts)

244
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:20,065
(Twilight strains, grunts)

245
00:13:20,647 --> 00:13:22,055
(Twilight pants)

246
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:28,064
Spike: (voice-over) Think of how much quicker they could wrap 
 up winter with your magic... ("your magic" echoes)

247
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:31,084
Twilight: I could use a come-to-life spell...

248
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:36,016
Oh...here goes...

249
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:40,057
(plow creaks and begins moving)

250
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:44,022
(snow bunching on blow)

251
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:49,088
(snow bunching up loudly)

252
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:53,078
Applejack: (suspiciously) Hm...she's awful strong for such a little pony.

253
00:13:58,024 --> 00:14:00,098
Spike: That's my girl! Following my advice!

254
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:03,040
Applejack: And what in tarnation does that mean?!

255
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,097
Twilight: (gasps) Uh-oh. Slow down!

256
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:11,038
SLOW DOWN!

257
00:14:15,377 --> 00:14:16,058
(snow crashes)

258
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:24,076
(snowball rumbling on ground, loud crash)

259
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:27,054
(Spike and Applejack screaming)

260
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:30,005
Applejack: What's goin' on...?! What'd you do...?!

261
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,058
(accusatory) You used magic, didn't you?!

262
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,079
(loud crash)

263
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:40,036
(avalanche)

264
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,052
(rumble)

265
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,032
(avalanche)

266
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:52,062
(three pops)

267
00:14:52,621 --> 00:14:55,059
Applejack: Nuts, Twilight! You used magic!

268
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,015
Spike: (feigning innocence) The NERVE! Can you believe her?!

269
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:02,033
Applejack: That's not how we do it 'round here, Twilight,

270
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:04,074
and especially not on MY farm!

271
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:08,046
Twilight: (choking up) Well, see, I just wanted to...

272
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,022
(Twilight whines and runs off)

273
00:15:15,052 --> 00:15:19,079
(pegasus ponies jumping on snow)

274
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,085
Spike: Come on, Twilight. Come on out.

275
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:27,008
Twilight: (pouting) I'm a winter mess-up.

276
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:29,026
Spike: Well, you're good at a lot of things,

277
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:34,012
just not nest making, ice skating, animal waking, snow clearing...

278
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:38,016
Twilight: (whines, sarcastic) Thanks a lot for making me feel SO much better.

279
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:40,048
Spike: (tactless) That's what I'm here for, sister.

280
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:46,019
Applejack: Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team need to melt the rest 
 of the snow here on the ground and the trees, pronto.

281
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,035
Rainbow Dash: Got it.

282
00:15:47,351 --> 00:15:51,095
Fluttershy: Wait. My poor little animals' homes will get 
 flooded if the snow melts too fast.

283
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:52,069
Rainbow Dash: Got it.

284
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:56,013
Applejack: I'm tellin' ya, Rainbow, ya gotta melt that snow NOW.

285
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:58,091
Fluttershy: No! You simply must wait!

286
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,025
Rainbow Dash: (losing patience) Okay.

287
00:16:00,246 --> 00:16:01,065
Applejack: Go.
Fluttershy: Stop.

288
00:16:01,654 --> 00:16:03,023
Applejack: Go!
Fluttershy: Stop!

289
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,032
Applejack: GO!
Fluttershy: STOP!

290
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:07,069
Rainbow Dash: (groans exasperatedly) Make up your MINDS!

291
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:11,092
Mayor: (annoyed) Oh, what in Equestria are all you arguing about?!

292
00:16:11,918 --> 00:16:15,040
This sort of silliness is why we were late for spring LAST year,

293
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:18,012
and the year before that, and the year before that!

294
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:20,016
Twilight: ...Did she say..."late?!"

295
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:25,022
Mayor: I was hoping my amazingly inspirational speech would 
 urge everyone to do better than last year,

296
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:28,047
but now it looks like we're gonna be later than EVER!

297
00:16:28,473 --> 00:16:30,061
I mean, just look at this CATASTROPHE!

298
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:33,040
The ice scorers made the ice chunks too big to melt,

299
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,023
the nest designer is horrendously behind,

300
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:39,029
we need several hundred and she's only made ONE!

301
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:41,000
(Rarity sobs theatrically)

302
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:44,005
And don't get me started on all the clouds still 
 in the sky, the icicles on the trees...

303
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:47,007
This isn't good. Not at ALL!

304
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:52,001
Applejack: And it's gonna be all-to-pieces disastrous if we can't get our seeds planted.

305
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:56,001
Rainbow Dash: Chillax, Applejack! We're bustin' our chops as fast as we can!

306
00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:00,006
Fluttershy: No! Not fast! We have to wake animals slowly!

307
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,007
Big Macintosh: Uh, AJ?

308
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:06,007
Applejack: Oh, good gravy. Caramel lost the grass seeds again, didn't he?

309
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:08,003
Big Mac: A-yup.

310
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:13,005
Pegasus pony: (grunts) Ditzy Doo accidentally went NORTH to get the SOUTHERN birds!

311
00:17:13,474 --> 00:17:17,006
Rainbow Dash: Oh, that featherbrain! Didn't she learn her 
 lesson last year when she went west?!

312
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:21,006
(ponies argue and complain over each other)

313
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,003
Mayor: Stop this at once!

314
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:24,008
We don't have time to argue!

315
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:28,007
It's almost sundown. Spring is going to be late again.

316
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:31,004
Another year of scandal and shame!

317
00:17:31,353 --> 00:17:34,002
If only we could be more organized...

318
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:38,001
Twilight: Spike! Get my checklist and clipboard! STAT!

319
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:39,003
Spike: (straightens up) Yes, ma'am.

320
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:41,000
(ponies arguing)
Twilight: Stop, everypony.

321
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,005
(ponies arguing)

322
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:45,004
Stop!
(ponies arguing)

323
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,005
(bird chirping, ponies stop arguing)

324
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:49,009
Twilight: (whispering) Sorry.

325
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:53,001
I know you all want to complete your jobs on time,

326
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:55,003
but arguing is no way to go about it.

327
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:59,001
What you need is...organization.

328
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:01,003
And I'm just the pony for the job.

329
00:18:03,559 --> 00:19:08,000
(instrumental version of Winter Wrap Up plays)

330
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,008
(whooshing)
(instrumental version of Winter Wrap Up plays)

331
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:19,009
(wind gathers loudly)
(instrumental version of Winter Wrap Up plays)

332
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:21,002
(whoosh)
(instrumental version of Winter Wrap Up plays)

333
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:24,009
(rising intensity wind)
(instrumental version of Winter Wrap Up plays)

334
00:19:24,852 --> 00:20:12,008
(instrumental version of Winter Wrap Up plays)

335
00:19:25,804 --> 00:19:28,005
(river flowing)

336
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:30,009
(ice chunking and breaking)

337
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:34,003
(plows grinding in dirt, pegasus ponies whoosh)

338
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:37,004
(plows grinding)

339
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:49,005
(cacophony of bird sounds)

340
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:15,007
Mayor: I can't believe it.
(music ends)

341
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:18,003
Spring is here! ON TIME!

342
00:20:18,305 --> 00:20:20,006
And we have you to thank for it.

343
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:24,002
If it weren't for your organizing skills, we would still be arguing.

344
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,005
Big Mac: A-yup.

345
00:20:25,503 --> 00:20:28,003
(ponies laugh)

346
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:29,009
Twilight: It was a team effort.

347
00:20:29,868 --> 00:20:34,000
Mayor: And since you helped every team, we have an official vest for you.

348
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:38,001
We give you the title, "All-Team Organizer!"

349
00:20:39,342 --> 00:20:43,000
Twilight: Gosh, I don't even know what to say! Thank you, everypony!

350
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:49,001
Mayor: And hereby I declare that winter is wrapped up...ON TIME!

351
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:50,006
(ponies cheer)

352
00:20:50,065 --> 00:20:56,004
(Spike snoring)
Applejack: Spike's sure gonna be in for a 
 hog-sized surprise when that last piece o'ice melts!

353
00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:00,008
(Spike snores, ponies laugh)

354
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:02,008
Twilight: (voice-over) "Dear Princess Celestia,

355
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:07,005
Winter Wrap Up was one of the most special things 
 I've ever been a part of here in Ponyville.

356
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:10,007
(Spike sneezes fire)
It helped me to learn that we all have hidden talents,

357
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:14,001
and if we're patient and diligent, we're sure to find them,

358
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,008
and as always, with good friendship and teamwork,

359
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,008
ponies can accomplish anything."

360
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,008
How was that, Spike? ...Spike?

361
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:23,004
(Spike snores)

362
00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:27,002
Twilight: Oh, Spike.
(Spike snores)

363
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:29,005
(Spike snores, Twilight giggles)

364
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:32,009
(ending theme begins) My Little Pony

365
00:21:35,186 --> 00:21:37,000
My Little Pony

366
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:48,002
(instrumental)

367
00:21:48,212 --> 00:21:54,005
My Little Pony, friends
