1
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,422
Where should we go, honey?
Bermuda or California?

2
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,525
Well... uh...

3
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,694
As usual, I'll have to make up
your mind for you.

4
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,995
Oh thanks, Vernon, honey.

5
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,030
Bermuda, tomorrow morning.

6
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,999
- Tomorrow morning?
- Too soon?

7
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:13,300
Not soon enough.

8
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,168
Your cue, Mr. Lowndes.

9
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,437
My cue, Mrs. Lowndes.

10
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,479
Good evening Mr. Hudson.
Hello, Ed.

11
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,054
Mike, hello.
And goodbye.

12
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,424
We're leaving town
in the morning.

13
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,558
Julie can go with my blessing.

14
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,828
Show's been running three
years. She's deserves a rest.

15
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:42,995
- Thanks.
- But you don't.

16
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,698
Where's the new show you've
been promising me?

17
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,735
You haven't written one line
since poor Marty got killed.

18
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,502
Please, don't tell me
what a great writing team

19
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,137
Marty and I were,
and how much I miss him.

20
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:53,374
I miss him more than you do.
He was money in the bank.

21
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:56,710
Yeah, and Julie keeps telling
me what a great husband
Marty was, too.

22
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,578
Pretty tough to follow,
wasn't he?

23
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,525
(APPLAUSE)

24
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,656
Closing night.
They won't go home
until you've given a speech.

25
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:50,757
You do it, Vernon.

26
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,393
Oh no, I'm gonna get the car.

27
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,862
Don't make it a long speech,
honey. We're off salary time.

28
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,737
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

29
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,941
I only wish it were three
years ago and our show was
opening instead of closing.

30
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,277
(APPLAUSE)

31
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,981
I know your applause is meant
not only for me, but for

32
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,419
Mike Hudson, our producer,
and for Vernon Lowndes,

33
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:21,087
Not only a fine dancer
but a fine writer, too.

34
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,191
My only regret is

35
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:27,794
That his collaborator, that
talented young man who also
staged this show

36
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,831
Isn't here to share
this moment.

37
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,799
He lies in a hero's grave,

38
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,134
Far across the sea.

39
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:39,373
Marty Stewart, who gave so
much of himself to the
theater.

40
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,509
No one appreciated his genius
more than I.

41
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,012
I was not only
his leading lady.

42
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:46,847
In those day I was his wife.

43
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,316
So while those of us
who are still alive are

44
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:54,021
Hearing your applause,
and taking our bows,

45
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:58,257
We know in our hearts
it is really his night,
not ours.

46
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,726
(APPLAUSE)

47
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,000
Marty!

48
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,301
Oh!

49
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,405
MAN: House lights!
House lights!

50
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,411
Please everyone, will you
leave the dressing room.
Come on now, please.

51
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,413
I'm sorry, honey,
well, you know how it is.

52
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,183
A guy gets back from overseas,
he just doesn't stop to think.
Will you forgive me?

53
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:02,589
Oh, everything is gonna be
just beautiful as soon as
I get you home.

54
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,157
Home!

55
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,529
Mike, I think we better leave
her alone for a while.

56
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,432
I'll help her get dressed.
Come on, give her a chance
to pull herself together.

57
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,700
Okay, all right.

58
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,602
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Come on, son.

59
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,673
How do you feel?

60
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:21,975
Numb.

61
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,379
It's quite a shock discovering
your husband is still alive.

62
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,316
Who's gonna tell your
other husband?

63
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:33,820
The one who's out in the car?
With the tickets to Bermuda in
his hot little fist?

64
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,255
- I wonder...
- Don't look at me.

65
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,825
Once upon a time,
I fell in love with him.

66
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,160
You married him.

67
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,596
Oh, then you tell Marty.

68
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,932
Oh I couldn't. I don't know if
you know this but...

69
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,101
I was a little starry-eyed
about him, too.

70
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:51,904
All right, I guess it's
my place.

71
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,642
For once I've got to make up
my mind and do something.

72
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,177
I'll tell Vernon,
I'll tell him right now.

73
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,046
I'll...

74
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,113
I'll...

75
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,916
Gwen, won't you tell him.

76
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,987
There's an old saying,
"You made your own bed..."

77
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,615
Vernon.

78
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,718
That was kind of
a long speech.

79
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:39,186
I have something to tell you.

80
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:42,122
Don't. The way I feel, we may
not bother to talk for days.

81
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,692
But it's about my speech.

82
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,194
I know it by heart.

83
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:50,462
"My only regret is that the
talented young man who also
staged the show"

84
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52.464
"Is not here to share
this moment."

85
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,433
- But he is.
- What?

86
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,936
- He just kissed me.
- Who kissed you?

87
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,706
- Marty.
- Marty who?

88
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,207
Marty Stewart.

89
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,343
Darling, look. Marty's dead.

90
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,179
He's been dead for two years.

91
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,282
You'd never know it by the way
he kissed me.

92
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,921
Now look, honey, I know how
sentimental you get
about things.

93
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,189
Remember how that little dog
got run over, and you kept
dreaming he'd come back.

94
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,660
Well, he didn't come back.
And Marty didn't come back.

95
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:22,829
Now, come on, let's get in our
little car and go on to our
little beddie-bye.

96
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,364
I don't know.

97
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,734
Marty wants to come back to
our little beddie-bye, too.

98
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,304
It's not true.

99
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:34,675
- Julie!
- It's true. He's right in
there with Mike.

100
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:37,409
He was marooned on an island
some place all this time.

101
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,613
He wasn't killed.
He wasn't even wounded.

102
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,015
Well, what did he say
when you told him?

103
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,085
- Told him what?
- That you're married
to me, now.

104
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,354
I didn't tell him.

105
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,323
Well, somebody
has to tell him.

106
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,194
Yes, but break it gently.

107
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,462
Gently? Me?

108
00:09:56,528 --> 00:10:00,600
Just say, "Marty, old man.
A funny thing happened to me
while you were dead."

109
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,769
You want me to tell a guy
who's just come back from

110
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,505
Two years on a desert island
that I married his wife?

111
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,675
Wait, you haven't met the new
stage manager yet.

112
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,610
I don't wanna meet anybody
else. There's only one person
I'm interested in meeting.

113
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,278
She sent me to say hello
to everybody in the cast.

114
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,147
Now it's your turn, again.
Hello, Julie.

115
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,917
You haven't say hello
to Vernon.

116
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,889
It's great to be back around
all the old familiar places.

117
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,424
Uh... Marty...

118
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,558
I know, now it's your turn.
Gee, it's good to see you
again, Vernon.

119
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,729
You don't know how much
I thought about you
while I was away.

120
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,631
You two boys can get the old
partnership going,
just like it used to be.

121
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,966
- Come on, we'll get a cab.
- This is my car.

122
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,335
Congratulations.
We'll get a cab.

123
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:38,104
No, no, I'll drive you home.

124
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,840
Okay, if it's not out of
your way.

125
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,241
Believe me, it isn't.

126
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,643
I'll go along, too.
I live in the neighborhood.

127
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,044
So do I.

128
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,479
- Pretty crowded neighborhood.
- You have no idea.

129
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,317
Well, everybody into the car.
Come on Julie,
I got a lot to talk you about.

130
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:55,521
You drive. I'm getting in the
back with Marty.

131
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:57,858
- What for?
- We're collaborators,
aren't we?

132
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, here we are...

133
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,871
Isn't it wonderful? The five
of us back together again?

134
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:17,009
Just like the old days, when
we were starving happily in
Greenwich Village.

135
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,480
Yes, but no matter how
tough things got,
we were always friends.

136
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,716
Ready to sing at the drop
of a hat, weren't we, Marty?

137
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:25,084
- Hmm.
- Maybe somebody ought to
drop a hat.

138
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:31,123
Boom.

139
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,593
Marty, you haven't told us
about your war experiences.

140
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,163
Reconnaissance flight.
Hurricane. Out of gas.
Desert island.

141
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,166
Coconuts and native girls.
And back to the old stand.

142
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,335
You must have hated to leave
those coconuts.

143
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,005
Why were you reported dead?

144
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,275
Another Martin Stewart.
Air Force snafu.

145
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:53,313
Julie, isn't there something
you have to tell Marty?

146
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,614
- Oh, Marty.
- Uh.

147
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,517
There's something you have to
understand.

148
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,289
The War Department
sent me a telegram
saying you'd been killed.

149
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,792
I would have cracked up if it
hadn't been for Vernon.

150
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,360
Well, old Twinkle Toes been
a comfort to you
while I was away?

151
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,763
I've seen a good deal of him.

152
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,532
He's been like
one of the family.

153
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,968
Isn't that right, Julie?

154
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:18,338
Oh, yes, he was
very kind to me during my...

155
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,506
Vernon, I knew you would be a
tower of strength.

156
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,742
- Oh, I did what I could.
- Thanks, pal.

157
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,682
You see months and
months went by and
everyone gave you up for...

158
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,151
Aw, not you, uh-uh.

159
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,455
Marty you've got to
understand...

160
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,357
Julie, you had faith.

161
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,393
I knew you would. A lot of
other girls would have
run off and got married again.

162
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,366
- Marty.
- Huh?

163
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,203
We're home.

164
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:01,781
Ah the same old
apartment house.

165
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,083
You know, I had a crazy idea
not to come
to the theater at all.

166
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:06,353
I was just gonna wait and
break in on you in the
middle of the night.

167
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,420
Wouldn't you have
been surprised?

168
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,122
It would have been about even.

169
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,258
Come on, doll.

170
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,226
Good night, sweetie.
We'll see you soon.
Mike, good night.

171
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,129
Vernon, thanks for the lift.
Thanks for everything you did
for Julie.

172
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,032
The pleasure was all mine.

173
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,168
No, don't get out.
You don't have to see us
to the door.

174
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,235
Now look, Marty, you and I
have to have a little talk.

175
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,372
Well, fine, we'll have lunch.

176
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,640
Not tomorrow.
The first part of the week.
I'll see you then.

177
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,811
Hey, open up.

178
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,048
Julie, I have
a wonderful idea.

179
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,118
Why don't we all go up
and have a drink together and

180
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,786
Celebrate Marty's return?

181
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,090
Fine, I'll park the car
and be right back.

182
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,524
Very funny.

183
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,426
That's a wonderful idea.

184
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,494
You're kidding.

185
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,463
I'll make some scrambled eggs.

186
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,600
I remember Marty used to just
love scrambled eggs at night.

187
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:56,235
- Yes, I'll mix the drinks.
- I'm not thirsty.

188
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,172
Come on, Marty, you can't
brush off old friends.
We'll have a wonderful time.

189
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,142
We may stay up all night.
Laughing and talking.

190
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,610
Great, just great.

191
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,717
Ah, just as I used to dream
about it.

192
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,286
Same old piano.

193
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,225
Oh, Vernon, we wrote some
great shows here.

194
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:22,628
Yup, the windows overlooking
the park.

195
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:23,863
(MARTY LAUGHING)

196
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,399
Oh I forgot, we were gonna
have a drink. Now...

197
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,200
Well, let's see. Where...

198
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,002
- Just raise up on
that knob, there.
- Oh!

199
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:34,074
Oh, huh... you changed things.

200
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:37,877
Chateau Dijon 1937.
You never used to drink wine.

201
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:39,947
She's got a lot of new tastes.

202
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,416
I bought it for her.
That was a fine vintage year.

203
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,953
Oh, well, where did you hide
the whiskey, dear?

204
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,753
I gave most of it
to the janitor.

205
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,423
There may be a bottle
somewhere.

206
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,962
The highball glasses are
in the other cupboard.

207
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,362
The ice?

208
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,531
Right there.
That's a little ice box.

209
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,766
Oh, very clever.
This is new, too.

210
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,603
I bought it for Julie.

211
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,406
You seem to be familiar with
everything in this apartment.

212
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,775
- Everything.
- He's been a tower
of strength.

213
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,180
Oh, you mix them.
Come on, Julie.

214
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,087
Marty, I...

215
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,855
I think Julie has
something to tell you.

216
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,526
There's been a marriage
you ought to know about.

217
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:30,030
- VERNON: Marty, what was it,
water or soda?
- Water for me and Julie.

218
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,598
Not for me,
I wanna keep my head.

219
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,832
What are you gonna do
with your head?

220
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:34,900
- Marty.
- Huh?

221
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,736
I don't know how to
tell you but...

222
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:39,905
Well, you see...

223
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,375
Vernon's married.

224
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,314
Well, what do you know?

225
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,552
The life-long bachelor.
Congratulations, Vernon.
Gwen...

226
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,686
The best, kid.
You finally hooked him, huh?

227
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,756
You two were cozy for
quite a while. I'm glad he
made an honest woman of you.

228
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,960
- I did not marry Gwen.
- I'm free for any offer.

229
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,063
You know, you're lucky you
didn't get him.

230
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,697
Well, anyway, whoever you
married, I give it three weeks
at the most.

231
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,100
I don't give it another night.

232
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,101
We'll drink a toast to the
unlucky bride

233
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,670
And then I'm sure you'll all
have to be running along.

234
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,074
To Mrs. Vernon Lowndes,
whoever she may be.

235
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,109
May all her troubles
be little ones.

236
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,147
I'll drink to that.

237
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,749
Well, so long.
Sorry you have to be leaving.

238
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,919
What's the matter with this
fella. Hasn't he got a home?

239
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,322
- Oh yes, he has.
- Well, tell him to go there.

240
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,659
I haven't been out of this
uniform for three days.
I'm going upstairs.

241
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,661
Hey, Marty, wait!

242
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:36,728
- Good night all.
- Marty, don't!

243
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,831
What am I doing?
Breaking a law or something?

244
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,769
- Not yet.
- Ah come on, honey. Don't
break up the party so early.

245
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,303
It's just like a
class reunion.

246
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,672
The four of us back
together again.

247
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:47,140
Like the old days in
Greenwich Village.

248
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,307
Oh no!

249
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:50,976
Somebody stop him.

250
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,146
You got any idea how?

251
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:56,283
Look, will everybody please
go home except my wife.

252
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,020
(DOOR BUZZER)

253
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,758
- Everything all right?
- Come on in. You're just in
time for the finale.

254
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,494
MARTY: Oh no!

255
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,631
What's this?

256
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,368
- Nobody told him yet?
- Kindly fasten your seat belt.

257
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,838
- Now, Marty...
- On your bed.

258
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,240
Pajama tops. Men's.
Who belongs to them?

259
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,674
Where are the bottoms?

260
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:23,776
I never wear them.

261
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,979
Marty, why did you do that?

262
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,481
Why? What a question.

263
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,351
It's all right,
it's perfectly legal.

264
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,785
Legal? What's happened to
America while I've been away?

265
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,589
- If you'll let me explain...
- Go on, it should be
interesting.

266
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,490
- Well, you see...
- Look, Marty, it's that...

267
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,526
I knew all along
I'd have to tell you.

268
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:42,027
Marty!

269
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,830
You were reported dead.

270
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,797
Julie and Vernon got married.

271
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,138
Happens every day. No need to
let it break up the team.

272
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,106
Now, aren't you sorry you lost
your temper?

273
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,907
Well, you see. Nothing's
wrong. We're married.

274
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,210
Congratulations.

275
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,595
Oh.

276
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:16,663
Have you...

277
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,564
Not yet.

278
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,167
How long is it going to take?

279
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,301
I don't know.

280
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:24,971
A girl who hasn't made up her
has no right coming in here
looking so beautiful.

281
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:26,639
How did the natives go
for that line?

282
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,975
Please.

283
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,876
You see what this all means.

284
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:32,645
If I decide on one of you,

285
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,281
I've got to hurt the other.

286
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,515
And I love you both
too much for that.

287
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,651
Now, wait a minute.
That's silly.

288
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,387
Is it silly to...

289
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,590
Be in love with the man
that I've been married to
for over a year?

290
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:48,026
Someone who's been sweet and
kind and understanding.

291
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,030
And when you came up
on that stage...

292
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,401
I thought my heart would stop.

293
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,669
It was like the first night
you took me home,

294
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,471
And you held out a bag of
peanuts to me and said,

295
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,807
"I wish these were diamonds."

296
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:02,908
Yeah, I stole the line
but I meant it.

297
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,244
Probably stole the peanuts,
too.

298
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,079
- Julie, what are we gonna do?
- We can't go on like this.

299
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,883
Please, you've got to
give me time.

300
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,786
A girl just doesn't flip a
coin about a thing as
important as this.

301
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:18,924
I have to decide which man I
want to spend the rest
of my life with.

302
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,727
And I've got to be sure
I'm right.

303
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:25,130
Good night, darling.

304
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,734
- Oh Julie.
- Good night, darling.

305
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,342
Good night.

306
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:44,916
Got a deck of cards?

307
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:46,819
No.

308
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:53,393
If you don't mind, I think
I'll take a cold shower.

309
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,125
(WHISPERING)
Julie. Julie.

310
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:28,595
Ouch!

311
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,367
What are you doing here?

312
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,937
If I ever heard of a situation
that calls for a chaperon,
this is it.

313
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:41,106
- Where's my wife?
- Downstairs, the maid's room.

314
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:42,809
Oh, by the way.

315
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:45,778
Maid's room is locked.

316
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,181
I might as well have stayed
with those coconuts.

317
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,250
Ouch!

318
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,605
Boy, you must have been dirty.

319
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:14,741
I like long showers.
Any objections?

320
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,375
No.

321
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,847
- Did you have fun, little boy?
- Not a bit.

322
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,854
I think I'll take a shower.

323
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,524
Go ahead.
You won't have any fun either.

324
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:38,431
- Good night.
- Good night.

325
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,011
* Which one?

326
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:55,747
* I think it's time that
I knew which one?

327
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,019
* I wish that character would

328
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:02,755
* Make up her mind

329
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:07,926
* She can't have them both

330
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,862
* That can't be done

331
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,732
* By all that's right

332
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,870
* I'm entitled to one, but

333
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:20,806
* Which one?

334
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:25,043
* Which is the one

335
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:26,745
* For

336
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,680
* Me

337
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,450
You have nothing to worry
about, Mrs. Lowndes.

338
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:06,818
You're in the hands of the
United States Air Force.

339
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:11,156
We recognize our
responsibility for
this situation.

340
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,492
It's wonderful of you to help
me, Colonel Wharton.

341
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,527
It seemed like an impossible
problem.

342
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,565
Well, you know our motto,

343
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,732
"The difficult we do
immediately,"

344
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,936
"The impossible takes
a little longer."

345
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,538
Of course the civil courts are
rather slow moving,

346
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:30,308
But when your case come up,
the Air Force will be
at your side.

347
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,311
And then what?
Who am I married to?

348
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,483
Well, the law is quite
specific on that point.

349
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:40,385
The first spouse is the legal
spouse. The second marriage
null and void.

350
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,955
What if I don't want the
second marriage null and void.

351
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:45,356
Oh? Oh!

352
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,760
Well, there is plenty of
precedent for that, too.

353
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:53,099
Since the second marriage
was entered into
without intent to deceive,

354
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:57,268
The second marriage is legal,
therefore the first marriage
may be annulled.

355
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,472
But the first marriage was
legal, too, wasn't it?

356
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,372
Oh yes, of course.

357
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,710
Then I'm legally married to
Marty, and I'm legally married
to Vernon.

358
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,949
Well, that's an amusing way
of putting it.

359
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:12,018
Of course, you'll have
to decide on one or the other.

360
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:15,321
- Why?
- Why?

361
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:17,856
I should hope because you're
in love with one of them.

362
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,424
Which one is it?

363
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:21,092
I love both of them.

364
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,929
Yes, but one a little more
than the other.

365
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,064
No.

366
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,567
Not even just a little bit?

367
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:28,635
Not even a little bit.

368
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,202
Even Steven.

369
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,170
Pardon me.

370
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,108
You know something.

371
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,343
You've just given me
a wonderful idea.

372
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:40,680
Why, I've got
what every woman wants.

373
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,615
A husband and a lover.

374
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,050
And they're both legal.

375
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:47,053
No, no, no. That's bigamy,
and it's illegal.

376
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,820
Illegal?

377
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,823
Who sent me this telegram?

378
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,026
Well, the... War Department.

379
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:55,393
What does it say?

380
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,564
"Regret to inform you, your
husband, Lieutenant"

381
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,632
"Martin Stewart,
killed in action."

382
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,500
Did I have every right
to marry again after that?

383
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,636
Well, yes, of course, but...

384
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:06,272
Then if anybody is guilty of
bigamy, it's the army.

385
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,973
You made the mistake.

386
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,878
Madam. In 150 years,

387
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:15,614
The United States Army has
made a lot of mistakes.

388
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:19,018
But letting you in this
office was the biggest
mistake of all.

389
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,188
I don't feel that way at all.

390
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,624
Why, you've taken a load
off my mind.

391
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,792
There's nothing wrong in
what I'm doing.

392
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,628
Nothing wrong?

393
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,429
According to your
line of reasoning, a woman
could have three, four, six...

394
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,699
A dozen husbands.

395
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:34,966
A dozen husbands.

396
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,168
COLONEL: There'd be no limit.

397
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,570
JULIE: A dozen husbands.

398
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:39,938
COLONEL: Let me read you
something, if I may...

399
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,006
JULIE: A dozen husbands.

400
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:43,576
A dozen husbands.

Ain't read my sign

* Couldn't you just die?

450
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:16,014
COLONEL: If your argument was
to be taken seriously,

451
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:18,918
It would result in the
ridiculous conclusion

452
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:21,888
That a woman can have as many
husbands as she wants.

453
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,721
Oh, I'm glad you agree
with me.

454
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,790
It would be just wonderful.

455
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:29,460
And if anybody has any
objections, I can send them
right to the US Air Force.

456
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,564
Oh, thank you,
Colonel Wharton. You've been a
wonderful help.

457
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:35,066
And the impossible you have
done immediately.

458
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,140
TV HOST: Now think hard.

459
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,575
You saw their faces in your
newspaper today.

460
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,546
Now, what news story
does this represent?

461
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:50,849
WOMAN: Ah? Would you
repeat the question please?

462
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:52,683
Another one.

463
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,853
We're famous.

464
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:56,923
You saw their faces
in your newspaper today.

465
00:30:56,989 --> 00:31:00,658
Now, what news story
does this represent?

466
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,394
Uh... that's that actress.

467
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,267
And her husband came home
and he was in the army.

468
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,068
Only she had two of them.

469
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,437
TV HOST: Correct.

470
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:14,273
Leave it on. It's better than
looking at you.

471
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,308
TV HOST: Now, soldier, this is
right up your alley.

472
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,446
What do you think of
the situation this represents?

473
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,514
All right, so this guy
goes into the Air Force, see.

474
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,017
- MAN: And he leaves
the wife alone, see.
- WOMAN: Correct.

475
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,255
Well, this other guy,
he's been givin' her
the eye all along, see.

476
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,457
So along comes a telegram
from the War Department

477
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,593
Tellin' her this first guy's
been knocked off,
leavin' the field clear.

478
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,895
Well, telegrams come cheap.

479
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:39,065
TV HOST: What point are you
trying to make, soldier?

480
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,299
MAN: Anybody can swipe a
telegraph blank,

481
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,135
Sign it "War Department" and
slip a kid a couple of bucks
to deliver it.

482
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,472
Ha!

483
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,706
MAN: Then by the time this
poor Joe gets back,
if he ever does get back,

484
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:52,277
The other guy and his wife
are so cozy, he don't
stand a chance, see.

485
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,779
Good, now, if you were Marty,

486
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:57,116
How would you
solve this problem?

487
00:31:57,183 --> 00:32:00,919
Easy. I'd grab the crumb
who stole my wife and
bust him right in the nose.

488
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:06,492
TV HOST: Thank you
Miss Williams and
Sergeant Kowalski.

489
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,093
And I'm sure you've been a
great help

490
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,830
In bringing peace and
happiness to a troubled home.

491
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:12,898
Now...

492
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,448
JULIE: Marty, Vernon.

493
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:36,321
- What happened?
- Where you been all day?

494
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,855
That's her own business.

495
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,159
Where have you been?

496
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:42,028
Well, I talked
to the Air Force

497
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,795
And I was little excited so I
walked around and shopped

498
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,465
A little because that's when
I do my best thinking.

499
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:47,533
What did the Air Force say?

500
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,036
I think we'd all better
sit down.

501
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,938
You can see how foolish it was
for you two to be fighting

502
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,207
Because the Air Force says
I can keep you both.

503
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,776
Our Air Force?

504
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,980
You're joking.
See, she's just joking.

505
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,314
(LAUGHING)

506
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,986
- She isn't.
- Of course I'm not.

507
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:10,056
The Colonel didn't exactly
say that.

508
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,657
But he admitted that I was
legally married
to each of you.

509
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,327
And while I'm making up my
mind, that's how
I'm going to stay.

510
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:20,198
You can see that's the only
sensible thing to do instead
of rushing into things.

511
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,833
If you're not careful,
you think for a minute
that she's talking sense.

512
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,870
I am talking sense.

513
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:27,972
I will not be rushed into
anything so important.

514
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,142
Now, we're going out to dinner
just as we did
when we were married.

515
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:33,978
Wait a minute.

516
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:37,248
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Let me understand this thing.

517
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,051
Exactly who
is going to dinner?

518
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:42,020
You and I, Marty and I.

519
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:44,190
- Two happy couples.
- Uh-huh!

520
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,225
And then we'll go dancing
and have few drinks.

521
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,061
And then we'll all come home.

522
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,329
We'll all come home?

523
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,930
Just like we did
when we were married?

524
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:53,998
That's right.

525
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,069
I'm going upstairs and change.

526
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,039
What do we do now?

527
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,543
Just what she says.

528
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,844
You'll have to let Marty have
one of your dinner jackets.

529
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,012
Oh, naturally.

530
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:09,980
Share and share alike.

531
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,716
And hurry.

532
00:34:13,984 --> 00:34:16,487
Oh, by the way old man.
When I socked you a while ago.

533
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,124
- Yes?
- I meant it.

534
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,190
So did I.

535
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:32,503
I phoned, they didn't answer.
I checked with the desk.
The manager said the

536
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,573
Three of them left together,
hours ago.

537
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,441
The happy triangle
out on the town.

538
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,376
Trying every angle.

539
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,510
I have to run along
in a minute.

540
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,847
Mind eating alone?

541
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:45,383
No, the kid's getting used to
it. I've been well trained.

542
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,420
Did I ever tell you about the
time I fell in love with Sam
the Coconut Man?

543
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,821
Marty?

544
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,990
But you know little Gwen.
A lot of laughs.

545
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,526
Nobody takes me seriously.

546
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,828
I sent Julie a lovely
wedding gift.

547
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,598
And switched to Twinkle Toes.

548
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:01,966
Yes, I made up my mind fast.

549
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:04,236
Big mistake.

550
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:07,705
Should have followed Julie's
example and never made up my
mind about anything.

551
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,842
I drank his awful wine.
I sewed buttons
on his awful vests.

552
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:13,811
And I was beginning
to like it.

553
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,647
Along comes
Little Miss Indecision
and I'm shut out again.

554
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,550
I sent her the same
wedding gift.

555
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,854
You wouldn't wanna maybe do
the town with a guy who

556
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:26,292
Has no intention of getting
married until he's around 70?
Might help you forget things.

557
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,728
I'm having much too good a
time feeling sorry for myself.

558
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:33,732
Don't worry. Julie'll make up
her mind, and there'll be
one left over for you.

559
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,467
We'll get a new show going
and everything will be great.

560
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:37,568
Thank you, Mother Goose.

561
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,107
Night, baby.

562
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:15,806
* There's a someone
I'm longing to see

563
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,611
* I hope that he

564
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,215
* Turns out to be

565
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:29,187
* Someone to watch

566
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:32,991
* Over me

567
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,700
* I'm a little lamb

568
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:45,002
* Who's lost in the wood

569
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:49,540
* I know I could

570
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,510
* Always be good

571
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,946
* To one

572
00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:00,184
* Who'll watch

573
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:02,186
* Over me

574
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:09,361
* Although he may not
Be the man

575
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:11,563
* Some girls think of

576
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,499
* As handsome

577
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,068
* To my heart

578
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:19,271
* He carries

579
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,308
* The key

580
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:29,647
* Won't you tell him please

581
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,851
* To put on some speed

582
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:36,922
* Follow my lead

583
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:40,392
* Oh, how I need

584
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:44,161
* Someone

585
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,598
* To watch

586
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:52,236
* Over me

- Ole!

601
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,511
Ole!

602
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,485
It was wonderful.
Wonderful!

603
00:45:21,551 --> 00:45:25,323
We'll go out every night
together and dance and dance.

604
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,292
My earrings hurt.

605
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,469
Please.

606
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,275
Thank you.
Thank you both.

607
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:49,514
Would you unzip me?

608
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,124
Good night.

609
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:40,630
You still here?

610
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,601
We were under the impression
we were invited.

611
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:46,536
Would you care for the
bathtub first, old boy?

612
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:48,473
- Oh, no after you.
- Oh, thank you.

613
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,542
Go to your room, both of you.

614
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:55,745
Our room? Oh, you mean the
dungeon with the twin beds.

615
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,916
Didn't the Air Force say
we were all married?

616
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:59,951
Well...

617
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:04,221
You know, I'm a little dizzy.

618
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:06,756
But not as dizzy as you think.
Now, get out of here.

619
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,829
Exactly what we intended
to do all along.

620
00:47:11,897 --> 00:47:15,365
Just as soon as you discovered
how ridiculous
your whole idea was.

621
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:18,468
Why!

622
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:25,775
Vernon, Marty!

623
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,546
We are going to the Waldorf.
And when you finally make up
your mind, you can phone us.

624
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,248
No, phone one of us.

00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,443
- Mrs. Lowndes?
- Yes.

627
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:00,244
Colonel Wharton sent his car.

628
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,980
Colonel Wharton?
What for?

629
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,449
- Weren't you informed?
- No.

630
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:06,952
Big meeting this morning,
in the colonel's office.

631
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:09,619
I hadn't heard, but if it's
for the colonel, I'll be down
on the double.

632
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:10,687
I'll wait downstairs.

633
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:27,205
Let me out of here.

634
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:29,306
After Sergeant O'Hallihan went
to the trouble of stealing the
colonel's car?

635
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,175
- Let me out.
- Relax.

636
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,078
It's the only way I could
get to see you alone.

637
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,180
But it's not fair to Vernon.

638
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:38,016
Yeah, that's the best part
of it.

639
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:40,418
- Where are we going?
- Back about six years.

The Village Cellar.

645
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,185
It's been a long time, Marty.

646
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:16,653
Under a new management.

647
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,388
Kind of like what's happened
to us.

648
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:22,527
I know the rental agent.

649
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,241
Oh, no.

650
00:49:37,807 --> 00:49:40,045
I wish I hadn't seen it
like this.

651
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:42,180
Oh, I don't know, Julie.

652
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:44,848
It's all in the way you
look at it.

653
00:49:44,914 --> 00:49:47,451
I'll always remember it the
way it was the first time.

654
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:50,287
MARTY: The first time
I saw you.

655
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:53,457
A warm kind of saloon.

656
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:56,393
Just about what you'd expect
to find in the Village.

657
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,563
Red checked tablecloths.

658
00:49:58,629 --> 00:49:59,997
They didn't show the spots.

659
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:02,332
JULIE: Sawdust on the floor.

660
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,471
You were rehearsing
that afternoon.

661
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,206
MARTY: Gwen was doing a
pirouette.

662
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,478
She ended up in Vernon's arms.

663
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:19,050
JULIE: There was a cloud of
smoke at the piano.

664
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,419
I could hardly see the guy
behind it.

665
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,455
MARTY: I could see you
all right.

666
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,691
You were standing in
the doorway.

667
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:31,329
JULIE: Out of work and
scared stiff.

668
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:33,898
MARTY: I remember you were
staring at me.

669
00:50:33,963 --> 00:50:36,266
JULIE: I wasn't staring
at you.

670
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,835
It was those lovely
hamburgers.

671
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,770
MARTY: There was something
about you.

672
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:42,939
JULIE: I hadn't eaten for
two days.

673
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:46,443
MARTY: That seedy character
you had for an agent
brought you into the place.

674
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,845
We'd been looking all over
town for a girl.

675
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:51,716
And he said you were
something special.

676
00:50:51,781 --> 00:50:55,253
He had no idea how right
he was.

677
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,323
JULIE: I remember, you asked
if I cared to have lunch.

678
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,758
But Mike was putting on the
big act.

679
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:03,060
MARTY: Mike said you just had
lunch at 21
with a big producer.

680
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,696
A likely story.

681
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:08,099
He said you were only
interested in an audition.

682
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,802
You were pressed for time.
Everybody in show business
was after you.

683
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:15,505
Mike went off with Vernon and
Gwen, and there we were.

684
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,241
The two of us.

685
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:20,009
JULIE: You weren't much
impressed with my material.

686
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,880
It looked like I was gonna
get a quick brush.

687
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:26,550
MARTY: You were interrupting
my lunch, and
I had a date uptown.

688
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,918
MARTY: Oh no, "I've been
kissed before."

689
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,256
Every singer in town was
using that.

690
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:34,291
Oh well... and away we go.

691
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:37,827
* I've been kissed before

692
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:40,964
* Arms have held me fast

693
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:44,769
* You can tell by my kiss
You weren't the first

694
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:47,372
* And you won't be the last

695
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,708
MARTY: Oo, waka-doo,
and a roony too-too.

696
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:53,378
I figured it was only
common courtesy
to let you finish.

697
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,813
* I've been kissed before

698
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,184
* Only fools tell when

699
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,586
* I was born to be kissed
To kiss and be kissed

700
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:05,122
* And I...

701
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:14,632
You want another one of those?

702
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:16,833
- No thanks.
- You got enough money
to get home?

703
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,170
I'm not going home.
I came here for an audition.

704
00:52:19,237 --> 00:52:20,638
Well, you're not in any shape.
You're weak.

705
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:23,874
Look, mister, I've waited a
long time for a
break like this.

706
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:26,877
I like hamburgers. And I wanna
be eating them regular.

707
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:28,946
Let's try it again
from the top.

708
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:35,786
Is this all the music
you brought with you?

709
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:37,554
It's 50 cents a copy.

710
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,156
Sorry. Wait a minute.

711
00:52:39,224 --> 00:52:40,890
You have this in your
repertoire?

712
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:43,661
- Sure I know it.
- You know the verse, too?

713
00:52:44,362 --> 00:52:46,029
Hammer away.

714
00:52:46,095 --> 00:52:49,334
Well, maybe, before we get
into it, I could give you
a few pointers.

715
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:52,270
See, we have a strange type of
audience, here in the Village.

716
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:55,306
I mean they're not exactly
music lovers. They're a little
more down to earth.

717
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:56,374

725
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:23,333

726
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,238

00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:28,118
* And I have got a crush

784
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:29,285
* Baby

785
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,720
* Baby

786
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,458
* Baby

787
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:35,960
* On

788
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:47,871
Remember what you said to me?

789
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:51,808
I love you, Marty.
I'll never love anyone else.

790
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:52,876
You mean it?

791
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,813
I'm coming home, Julie.

792
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,016
- Are you gonna tell Vernon,
or should I?
- I'll tell him.

793
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:02,351
- Poor Vernon.
- Poor Vernon.

794
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,164
I guess I already knew it
all the time.

795
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:17,567
Don't act this way,
Vernon, please.

796
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:19,135
How else can I act?

797
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,070
Marty and you gone all day.

798
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,406
Me alone in my hotel room.
Thinking.

799
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:25,775
About what?

800
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:26,843
Julie!

801
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:31,015
About myself.

802
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,883
Maybe if you took something
to get the acid
out of your system.

803
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:37,087
Julie, I...

804
00:57:38,387 --> 00:57:40,457
I wish you every happiness
in the world.

805
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,459
What do you mean?

806
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:46,763
Well, I know my weaknesses.
My faults.

807
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,466
It's not hard to see
I'm just a plain guy.

808
00:57:49,534 --> 00:57:51,701
Why should any woman want me?

809
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,504
- I married you.
- Why?

810
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,073
Well...

811
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,108
How can you ask a thing
like that?

812
00:57:58,175 --> 00:57:59,577
There, you see?

813
00:57:59,644 --> 00:58:01,845
Marty, he's everything
a woman loves.

814
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:05,049
He's handsome, reckless,
unreliable.

815
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:06,516
Selfish.

816
00:58:06,584 --> 00:58:08,352
No, I'm licked, Julie.

817
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:09,418
There's no use fighting.

818
00:58:10,688 --> 00:58:11,688
I'm going away.

819
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:15,292
Well, if that's how you feel?

820
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,327
How I feel has nothing to do
with it.

821
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:19,530
Far be it from me to interfere
with your plans.

822
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:21,031
Go ahead and quit.

823
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:23,534
But what kind of a man gives
up before the fighting starts?

824
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:26,671
I shouldn't give up?

825
00:58:26,737 --> 00:58:29,607
Of course not.
Never take no for an answer.

826
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:31,876
You can't lose if you have
the will to win.

827
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:34,711
Keep fighting until
the last man is down.

828
00:58:34,778 --> 00:58:37,682
- Are there others?
- Others?

829
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:41,951
Don't quit now. Don't hang
your head and run away.
Fight for the woman you love.

830
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:45,454
That's the way.

831
00:58:47,792 --> 00:58:48,793
That's more like it.

832
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:53,429
Darling.

833
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:55,165
- You love me?
- Yes.

834
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,671
- Who's gonna tell Marty?
- Oh.

835
00:59:00,738 --> 00:59:02,438
Break it to him gently.

836
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,043
Julie, I'm coming home.

840
01:04:20,724 --> 01:04:21,725
Anybody home?

841
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:37,840
No use waiting
for Marty and Vernon.

842
01:04:37,908 --> 01:04:40,377
They won't be in any mood
to talk about a show.

843
01:04:40,444 --> 01:04:42,711
I hate to see talent
going to waste, brilliant
writers doing nothing,

844
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:45,814
A dancer like you
wasted in nightclubs.

845
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:49,653
The theater is my whole life,
Gwen. This sort of thing gets
me... here.

846
01:04:49,718 --> 01:04:52,156
Isn't that where you
keep your wallet?

847
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:55,159
Okay, so I like money.
Is that a crime?

848
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,261
The boys have got something
in common, now.
They both hate Julie.

849
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:01,431
They'll kiss me for asking
them to go back to work
together again.

850
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,702
Great. My collaborator,
breaking up my marriage.

851
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:07,938
What about my marriage?

852
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,040
I never wanna see your ugly
face again.

853
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:11,108
Taxi.

854
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:13,777
- Where to?
- Reno!

855
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:20,816
What happened?

856
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:23,287
The next time he's reported
dead, it won't be a mistake.

857
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:25,089
With these two hands.

858
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:26,689
Vernon.

859
01:05:26,755 --> 01:05:28,891
Why don't you use those two
hands on the typewriter?

860
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:31,428
Write a show without him.
That'll kill him
worse than anything.

861
01:05:31,495 --> 01:05:32,695
You're out of your mind.

862
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:34,164
Taxi.

863
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,642
- Twenty-third street theater.
- What do you think
you're doing?

864
01:05:45,709 --> 01:05:48,277
We'll go to my office,
have a few drinks,
sign a few contracts.

865
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:50,813
Before you know it you'll
be collecting five percent of
the gross.

866
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:52,881
Which you won't have to split
with a collaborator.

867
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,020
- Why pick on me?
- Marty's cab left too fast.

868
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:59,556
Don't listen to her.
Don't I know the one
who's the real talent?

869
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:03,660
Look, I wouldn't write a show
for Julie if you hung me up
by my thumbs.

870
01:06:03,727 --> 01:06:05,195
Who mentioned Julie?

871
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:06,729
Did I mention Julie?

872
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:07,797
Did you mention Julie?

873
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:11,168
- Did you mention Julie?
- Huh?

874
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,303
He didn't mention Julie.

875
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,273
All right, make jokes.

876
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,708
What's wrong with writing a
show for Gwen?

877
01:06:18,775 --> 01:06:20,277
Wonderful dancer.
Great personality.

878
01:06:20,344 --> 01:06:24,447
Hey, wait a minute.
Come down to earth.
I'm not ready for that.

879
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:26,350
A show for Gwen?

880
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:30,119
If it's a hit, it'll not only
kill Marty, it'll kill Julie.

881
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,158
You know what makes you
so attractive, Mike?

882
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:37,426
It's that mean,
diabolical mind.

883
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,029
What do you say, Gwen?
Wanna try it?

884
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:40,963
A star, and a show
of your own.

885
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:57,913
Hold it, hold it.

886
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:02,086
That's all for tonight.
Everybody go home. Tuck into
your nice cozy beds and

887
01:07:02,152 --> 01:07:03,687
Think of me sitting up
half the night

888
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:05,655
Trying to figure out what to
do with the second act.

889
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:07,524
Attention, kids.

890
01:07:07,591 --> 01:07:10,094
Everybody see Harry Selby
about the costume call
for the morning.

891
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,097
And please be on time
for the fitting.

892
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:15,031
Report back here
when you're through.

893
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:16,632
It is gorgeous, no?

894
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,667
- Okay, fine. You can go now.
- Merci, monsieur.

895
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:20,270
Thanks a lot.

896
01:07:20,337 --> 01:07:22,339
How about dinner, Gwen?

897
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:25,308
- Why, I'm game for anything.
- There's a steak involved.

898
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:28,278
GWEN: Why, Mike, I'm
flattered. That costs money.

899
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:30,214
- MIKE: Well I figured I'd get
even...
- Say, Gwen.

900
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:33,382
Would you mind putting in a
little overtime?

901
01:07:34,284 --> 01:07:36,385
Sure, if you want me to.

902
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:38,887
- Pick me up at my place
at 9 o'clock.
- Okay.

903
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,865
Why don't we take it from the
promenade section.

904
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:51,135
Okay.

905
01:07:51,201 --> 01:07:52,202
All right.

906
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:53,936
Okay.

907
01:07:57,141 --> 01:07:58,142
Good.

908
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:03,011
Good night, folks.

909
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,080
- Good night.
- Good night, Harry.

910
01:08:08,016 --> 01:08:10,553
That's better.

911
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,788
Wonder if he'll take me to
a place with candlelight?

912
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,924
- Who?
- Mike.

913
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:17,193
Big date, huh?

914
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,264
I think candlelight is
terribly flattering to a girl.

915
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:21,631
Don't you?

916
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,366
Watch your balance.

917
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,234
What kind of champagne
should I order?

918
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:27,671
Depends on
what you're launching.

919
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,408
I wonder if I should wear
my blue dress.

920
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:33,210
Watch your point.

921
01:08:34,178 --> 01:08:35,511
All right. Hup!

(HARP MUSIC)

923
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:41,651
Wait a minute.

924
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:42,719
What's the matter?

925
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:45,020
That felt different, somehow.

926
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:46,855
It's the same way we've
been doing it for two weeks.

927
01:08:48,392 --> 01:08:50,025
I guess I never
noticed before.

928
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:51,093
Well, let's try it again.

929
01:08:54,863 --> 01:08:55,864
All right.

930
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:04,140
It is different.

931
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,045
Maybe I should wear
my pink dress.

932
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:20,589
Black is always good.

933
01:09:34,204 --> 01:09:38,073
Of course, I always say,
when a girls accepts a date
with a fella,

934
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,544
It presents many more problems
to her than it does to him.

935
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:45,181
Why, all he has to do
is see whether he's got
a dark suit,

01:09:46,014 --> 01:09:47,015
A shirt,

937

Maybe a different tie,

938
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,188
And he's ready.

On the other hand,

940

things like

941
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,837
Whether she's gonna
wear a hat, because, you see,

942
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:09,339
Some fellas like hats

943
01:10:09,406 --> 01:10:11,074
And other fellas
don't like hats.

944
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,781
Do you like hats?

945
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:37,334
Maybe I shouldn't
go out with him at all.

946
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:39,336
You see,

947
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:41,069
You might go out with a fella,
but there might be

948
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:43,307
Somebody else you wanted
to go out with

949
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:45,173
And never got around
to mentioning it.

950
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:51,348
And maybe you wanted
to go out with him, too.

951
01:10:51,415 --> 01:10:53,817
But you never got around
to mentioning it either.

952
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:56,820
Even though the two of you
are around each other
all the time,

953
01:10:56,886 --> 01:10:59,889
Taking each other for granted,
so what's a girl gonna do?

954
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,460
They're staying away
like this was Shakespeare.

955
01:13:17,293 --> 01:13:18,462
Mr. Hudson, you've got bust.

956
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:20,997
I've had them before.
I've pulled out of it.

957
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,936
Everybody who goes to a show,
they know what the writers do.

958
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:30,206
They know what the composers
do. They know what the
actors do.

959
01:13:30,273 --> 01:13:32,107
Nobody knows
what the producer does.

960
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,444
Legit, please.

961
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:36,879
I'm gonna let you in
on my little secret.

962
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:39,082
Who's this, Joe?
Mike Hudson.

963
01:13:39,147 --> 01:13:41,283
What is it Mike?
The usual story?

964
01:13:41,349 --> 01:13:43,819
Heavy advance sales for
Mike Hudson show.

965
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:46,855
Huh?

966
01:13:48,256 --> 01:13:49,257
Say, is this Mike Hudson?

967
01:13:50,594 --> 01:13:52,929
What do you mean
you got no second act?

968
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:54,698
The book is weak.

969
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,799
Say, what do you wanna
run down your own show for?

970
01:13:58,034 --> 01:13:59,102
Sure, I'll print it.

971
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,776
REPORTER: Are you sure this is
Mike Hudson?

972
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,343
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

973
01:14:08,411 --> 01:14:10,245
You don't think Gwen Howard
can carry the show.

974
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:11,680
Nobody's buying tickets.

975
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:13,982
You predict everyone
including yourself
will lose their shirts.

976
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:16,619
Of course I'll print it.

977
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:17,720
You think I'm crazy?

978
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:22,290
Mike, confidentially.
Are you...

979
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:24,159
Who, me?

980
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:26,996
What good does that do?

981
01:14:27,063 --> 01:14:30,033
Marty's on a ranch
in Nevada someplace
waiting for his divorce.

982
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:31,800
Julie's in California,
isn't she?

983
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:33,837
These papers have
a wide circulation.

984
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:36,005
Anyway, if they don't,
I'm mailing out copies.

985
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,226
(BUS HORN HONKING)

986
01:15:11,407 --> 01:15:12,508
(NEIGHING)

987
01:15:34,831 --> 01:15:36,600
Maybe it'll look better
when it's typed up.

988
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:38,201
Breaking for lunch,
so let's go.

989
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,502
Okay.

990
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,239
No matter what I do
to that second act,
it comes out the same.

991
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:45,908
- Dull.
- Don't worry, kid, it'll come
to you.

992
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,817
Hi.

993
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:57,419
Just thought I'd drop around,
take in a rehearsal.
Any objections?

994
01:15:57,485 --> 01:15:59,623
I guess you read
our sick notice in Variety?

995
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:01,557
Yeah, well, they're wrong.
I went through this script.

996
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,192
The second act
can be fixed like that.

997
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:04,560
Wait a minute. Where did you
get a copy of the script?

998
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,962
What do you mean?
You mailed it to me.

999
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:09,231
I mail... who mailed it to you?

1000
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:15,138
Twenty-two cents.
That's all it cost, plus tax.

1001
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:22,711
Wanna go to work?

1002
01:16:23,747 --> 01:16:25,815
- Do you?
- Do you?

1003
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:28,151
Ah!

1004
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:35,391
Look, let's go. We've got to
keep alive one of the great
romances of the theater:

1005
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:36,726
Mike and his wallet.

1006
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:39,128
I feel it... here.

1007
01:16:39,863 --> 01:16:40,864
(WHISTLE)

1008
01:16:42,298 --> 01:16:44,432
Everybody back in one hour,
please!

1009
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:47,236
Gwen... Marty's here!

1010
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:49,706
- What?
- Uh-huh!

1011
01:16:49,773 --> 01:16:52,507
- Wonderful. Is it gonna work?
- Like a charm.

1012
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:54,143
- Well, I gotta see him.
- Uh-uh.

1013
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:56,145
They're creating.
Let's go eat.

1014
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:58,513
I will buy you the biggest...

1015
01:16:59,347 --> 01:17:01,483
Any casting today?

1016
01:17:01,549 --> 01:17:03,820
- Julie!
- Baby!

1017
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,091
- Gee, it's good to see you.
- Gwen.

1018
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:09,291
- Hiya, Mike.
- Hi, honey.

1019
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:12,728
Is it true, what
Billboard said about the show?

1020
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:15,198
Pay no attention. They use
very unreliable sources.

1021
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:18,266
It's true.
We're about to hatch a turkey.

1022
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:20,870
Look, I don't wanna push my
way into anything but...

1023
01:17:20,937 --> 01:17:22,404
If I can help.

1024
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:23,906
Julie, will you?

1025
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:25,208
Of course I will.

1026
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:26,509
Well, let's all sit down.

1027
01:17:26,574 --> 01:17:29,544
I just happen to have a
contract right here.

1028
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:32,280
Your old salary, run of the
play, dated yesterday.

1029
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:33,548
What kept you?

1030
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:35,819
Oh, Mike.
It's just like the old days,

1031
01:17:35,885 --> 01:17:37,953
Double-crossed before I start.

1032
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:40,388
I love you, you dirty rat.

1033
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:43,292
Julie, I think I've kind of
double-crossed you, too.

1034
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,661
Vernon and I...

1035
01:17:45,729 --> 01:17:47,831
Well, legally
he was fair game but...

1036
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:50,398
- If you still want...
- Uh-uh.

1037
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:53,202
Once you make up your mind,
don't ever change it.

1038
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:56,372
She's right. I don't want you
on the open market again.

1039
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:58,708
- You're safe, Mike.
- VERNON: Hey, Mike.

1040
01:17:58,775 --> 01:18:00,844
Mike, the second act,
we've got a wonderful idea.

1041
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,978
Mike, this is great.
All you gotta do is...

1042
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,549
- Now Marty, look...
- Mike.

1043
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:09,218
MARTY: What did you come
down for? The wake?

1044
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,387
I heard the show
was in trouble.

1045
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:13,689
So I came down
to offer to help.

1046
01:18:13,757 --> 01:18:14,924
We don't need your help.

1047
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:17,426
Maybe we don't.
But we do.

1048
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:21,197
In that case I'm through.
The only time I wanna see you
again is in a divorce court.

1049
01:18:21,264 --> 01:18:23,066
I'm sorry,
I'm leaving the firm.

1050
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:25,467
Look, I may not like
seeing you any more than
you like seeing me.

1051
01:18:25,533 --> 01:18:27,469
But when a show's in trouble,
you've got to try to help.

1052
01:18:27,535 --> 01:18:29,637
I'd like to help.
But not on those terms.

1053
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,606
That's pretty selfish,
isn't it?

1054
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:35,078
Well, look who's talking
about being selfish.
The original two-for-one girl.

1055
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:37,280
Our friends are in trouble.

1056
01:18:37,346 --> 01:18:40,283
And hot or cold, they've got
to open two weeks from
tonight in New Haven.

1057
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,084
I'm gonna stay with it.

1058
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:43,651
How about you?

1059
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,292
Oh, let's get back
to the typewriter.

1060
01:18:52,796 --> 01:18:56,698
One... two... three... four.
Five... six... seven... eight.

1061
01:18:56,766 --> 01:19:00,369
One... two... three... four.
Five... six... seven... eight.

1062
01:19:00,436 --> 01:19:02,906
One... two... three... four.
Five... six.

1063
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:04,740
Hold it.

1064
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,343
Hold it, look.
Now wait a minute.

1065
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,947
We all know we've only got
four days to go to
dress rehearsal, right?

1066
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:14,150
So let's get with it.

1067
01:19:14,217 --> 01:19:15,951
I know you're a big star,
but you're supposed to

1068
01:19:16,018 --> 01:19:18,386
Bend down all the way
like the rest of the help.

1069
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:20,123
All right, you girls
take five.

1070
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:23,091
Not you.

1071
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:24,692
We're gonna try it again
from the beginning.

1072
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:31,599
And one... two... three... four.
Five... six... seven... eight.

1073
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:35,403
One... two... three... four.
Five... six... seven... eight.

1074
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:39,074
One... two... three... four.
Five... six... seven... eight.

1075
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:42,677
- (TAPING OUT THE BEAT)
- Eight.

1076
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:46,415
One... two... three... four.
Five... six... seven... eight.

1077
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:49,717
One... two... three... four.
Five... six... seven...

1078
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:59,261
Come on, there's no time for
rehearsal. Make it for real.

1079
01:19:59,328 --> 01:20:00,329
For real.

1080
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:07,335
Everybody, half-hour!
Tomorrow night
is at 8 o'clock.

1081
01:20:07,403 --> 01:20:11,539
Remember. Everybody,
tomorrow night is at
8 o'clock.

1082
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:23,085
Don't let him get you down.

1083
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,888
Gwen, I think
I'd better leave the show.

1084
01:20:25,753 --> 01:20:27,390
Bad as that?

1085
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:30,725
I'm in love with a man
I'm legally married to.
Isn't it silly?

1086
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:34,330
If you ask me, I think
he's still in love with you.

1087
01:20:34,397 --> 01:20:36,399
Then why doesn't he says so?

1088
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:38,700
What do you think he's been
doing for the last two weeks?

1089
01:20:38,766 --> 01:20:40,369
Every time he balls you out.

1090
01:20:40,436 --> 01:20:43,106
Every time he treats you
like a dog?

1091
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,508
The mating call
of the lonely male.

1092
01:20:45,573 --> 01:20:48,011
Why doesn't he come right out
and tell me?

1093
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:50,379
That's what you've been
waiting for, isn't it?

1094
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:52,448
That's why you
came back to the show?

1095
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:54,850
But because
he won't do it your way,

1096
01:20:54,918 --> 01:20:57,719
You're gonna run out
on the show the day before
dress rehearsal.

1097
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:01,124
What would you do?

1098
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:04,527
Oh... I'd probably do something
stupid like

1099
01:21:04,592 --> 01:21:06,562
Swallowing my pride and

1100
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:09,331
Crawling to him
on my hands and knees.

1101
01:21:09,398 --> 01:21:11,267
Right out in public.

1102
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,035
But you wouldn't
do anything like that.

1103
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:14,703
It's liable to work.

1104
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:17,373
Wouldn't I?

1105
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,247
One... two... three... go.

1106
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,920
* Oh Matilda, it's so hot

1107
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:08,456
* Sat up till day break

1108
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:11,026
* Couldn't even sleep a wink

1109
01:22:15,863 --> 01:22:18,401
* My mind was wandering

1110
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:21,804
* All I did was... think

1111
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:28,276
* The way I've been treated

1112
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:31,480
* Would drive a gal

1113
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:33,549
* To drink

1114
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:39,354
* How come you do me like you

1115
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,524
* Do... do... do?

1116
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:45,561
* How come you do me
Like you do?

1117
01:22:46,694 --> 01:22:48,097
* Why

1118
01:22:48,164 --> 01:22:52,400
* Try to make me feel so blue?

1119
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,269
* I ain't done nothin'

1120
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,639
* To you

1121
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:02,078
* Do me right or else just
Let me be

1122
01:23:02,145 --> 01:23:04,580
* 'Cause,
lover, I can beat you
Doing anytime

1123
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:06,782
* What you're doing to me

1124
01:23:06,849 --> 01:23:08,117
* So tell me

1125
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:13,056
* How come you do me like you
Do... do... do?

1126
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:15,690
* How come you do me
Like you do?

1127
01:23:33,176 --> 01:23:35,744
* How come you do me like you
Do... do... do?

1128
01:23:35,811 --> 01:23:39,048
* How come you do me
Like you... do?

1129
01:23:39,115 --> 01:23:42,017
* Why try to make me
Feel so blue?

1130
01:23:42,085 --> 01:23:44,986
* I ain't done nothin' to you

1131
01:23:45,054 --> 01:23:47,489
* Do me right or else just
Let me be

1132
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:51,026
* 'Cause I can beat you doing
What you're doing to me

1133
01:23:51,094 --> 01:23:53,928
* How come you do me like you
Do... do... do?

1134
01:23:53,995 --> 01:23:55,798
* How come you do me
Like you do?

1135
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:53,488
* How come you do me

1136
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:55,022
* Like you do?

1137
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,759
* How come you

1138
01:24:56,824 --> 01:24:58,326
* Do?

1139
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:00,061
* Why make me

1140
01:25:00,129 --> 01:25:01,630
* Feel blue?

1141
01:25:01,697 --> 01:25:03,431
* I done nothin' to you

1142
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:08,903
* Do me right or else just
Let me be

1143
01:25:08,971 --> 01:25:14,276
* 'Cause I can beat you doing
What you're doing to me

Do... do... do?

01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:37,499
* How come you do me like you
Do... do... do?

1147
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:39,567
* How come you do me?

1148
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:43,172
* Do me like you do?

1149
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,142
* Like you do?

1150
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:07,630
Watch.

1151
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:24,512
* How come you do me like you

1152
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:26,814

01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:38,493
* Try to make me
Feel so blue?

1157
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:43,899
* I ain't done nothin' to you

1158
01:26:46,802 --> 01:26:49,937
* Do me right or else just

1159
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:52,507

01:27:03,286 --> 01:27:05,019

1164
01:27:11,126 --> 01:27:12,960
(APPLAUSE)

1165
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:28,344
* I've got a

1166
01:27:29,545 --> 01:27:31,614
* Crush on you

1167
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:32,981
* Sweetie pie

1168
01:27:33,048 --> 01:27:35,082
* All the day and night time

1169
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:36,285
* Hear me sigh

1170
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:40,588
* Crush on you

1171
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:42,825
* Sweetie pie

1172
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:44,026
* All the day and night time

1173
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:45,961
* Hear me sigh

1174
01:27:46,028 --> 01:27:49,096
* I never had
the least... notion

1175
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:53,167
* That I could fall with
So much emotion

1176
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:56,472
* Could you coo?
Could you care?

1177
01:27:56,539 --> 01:27:59,641
* For a cottage
We could share?

1178
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:03,244
* The world will pardon my

1179
01:28:04,347 --> 01:28:05,280
* Mush

1180
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,449
* Mush?

1181
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:12,988
* 'Cause I have got a

1182
01:28:13,055 --> 01:28:14,523
* Crush

1183
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:16,024
* Baby

1184
01:28:16,091 --> 01:28:17,425
* Baby

1185
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:19,494
* Baby

1186
01:28:19,561 --> 01:28:22,531
On... you
