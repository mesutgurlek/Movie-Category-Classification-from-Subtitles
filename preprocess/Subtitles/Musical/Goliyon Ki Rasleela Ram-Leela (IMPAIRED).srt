1
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,379
This place is
unbelievable Bhaveshbhai,

2
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:26,782
you won't see such
a place anywhere in India.

3
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,447
The shops are openly selling weapons.

4
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:33,020
As a matter of fact women
and children are also carrying guns.

5
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:35,289
You would've been
shocked to see this sight.

6
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:39,300
I am seeing a market full
of weapons for the first time.

7
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:42,303
Oh Bapu, welcome, welcome.
Please come to my shop!

8
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,203
I assure you, you will not find this
quality of guns anywhere in India.

9
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:46,136
I will call you later.

10
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:49,236
Don't worry about the price
just come, come, come Bapu.

11
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:52,381
Look at this one Bapu, all these
guns have been made here itself.

12
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:55,146
...hand-made... world famous
in the whole of Ranjaar.

13
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:56,979
This is a Russian Kalashnikov right?

14
00:04:57,074 --> 00:04:59,523
This is a Rajanikov Bapu,
not a Kalashnikov.

15
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:02,218
It's not a gun if it
is not made by a Rajadi.

16
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,161
You sell these guns openly...

17
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,162
...aren't you worried
the Police might catch you?

18
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:09,095
Who cares about the Police...

19
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:14,407
Bapu the fact is, guns rule
this land. What choice do we have?

20
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:19,346
There are enemies across the border
and enemies across the street as well.

21
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:20,544
There are enemies over there as well?

22
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:22,411
Yes those bloody Saneras...

23
00:05:22,503 --> 00:05:26,547
Forget about them Bapu,
try the range of this gun.

24
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:29,420
This one goes straight for the enemy.

25
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:33,590
These bloody Rajadis, they
are acting way too smart today...

26
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:37,191
Hey everybody, listen up...

27
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:40,795
These Rajadis are bloody useless...

28
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:44,803
...they should remove their
beards and wear a dress...

29
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,276
Did you see Bapu,
anything we do, they retaliate.

30
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:52,746
Looks like an old grudge.

31
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:55,286
There are only three cuss words...

32
00:05:56,142 --> 00:05:59,593
which we Rajadis know,
Sanera Sanera and Sanera...

33
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:01,588
Son of a gun!

34
00:06:01,882 --> 00:06:04,091
These Rajadis are
way out of line today.

35
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:06,400
Looks like they have
forgotten our last brawl.

36
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,164
These beggars need another
dose of imported bullets.

37
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:15,745
Hey... hey... how dare you
take a piss here you idiot.

38
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:19,076
You better gel out of here
or I will break your head you rascal.

39
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:21,776
It's my terrace I am pissing from,

40
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:25,318
I can't help where it falls what's
your problem you bloody Sanera!

41
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:27,923
You piece of filth, bloody Rajadi!

42
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:29,783
Bapu!

43
00:06:30,282 --> 00:06:32,161
Wait you mongrel! Rajadi!

44
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:35,535
I will wipeout the
entire Rajadi clan today.

45
00:06:44,365 --> 00:06:45,504
Hey!

46
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,625
Hey you... bloody m!

47
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,221
<i>Screams</i>

48
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,720
Brother don't stress.

49
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:30,162
This is an everyday
affair in our neighborhood.

50
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:31,323
What are you talking about...

51
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:32,693
...he just shot at a kid!?

52
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:35,532
That kid is our clan
leader's grandson.

53
00:07:35,658 --> 00:07:38,403
Today the bullets were
rained on Goli(Bullet) as well.

54
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:40,008
You are fortunate as
there will be a huge brawl...

55
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,870
"between the Rajadis and Saneras."

56
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:44,281
- So which one do you want?
- Bloody hell...

57
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:46,843
You hit a customer!

58
00:07:46,938 --> 00:07:49,216
Bloody, slimy Sanera!

59
00:07:58,451 --> 00:08:00,433
It's a brawl!

60
00:08:23,613 --> 00:08:24,718
Bloody Saneras!

61
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:25,886
Meghjibhai...

62
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,221
Meghjibhai,

63
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:30,495
Those bloody dogs fired at Goli. The
situation is getting out of control!

64
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:33,971
Bapu... he shot at
me... that too 4 times.

65
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:35,295
Who?

66
00:08:35,394 --> 00:08:36,669
Bhavani!

67
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:49,754
Come on!

68
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:53,250
Come on!

69
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:58,665
Let's fix them!

70
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:01,030
People are just randomly
firing at each other,

71
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,033
this is absolutely shocking...

72
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:05,775
Bhavesh bhai!

73
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:07,975
Move! Move!

74
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:20,484
Ram!

75
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:21,716
Ram!

76
00:09:21,814 --> 00:09:24,320
Why will Ram be at home at this hour?

77
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:25,863
Kasai Bhabhi,
a melee has broken out...

78
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:27,957
...Meghjibhai has gone
alone to fight the enemy.

79
00:09:28,055 --> 00:09:30,732
Maa, Uncle Ram should
also be with father!

80
00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:33,832
Ram is the only one who
believes in peace and love.

81
00:09:34,062 --> 00:09:36,066
But these people
won't even spare him.

82
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:42,347
You can find Ram at his
usual hangout, Hanuman Lane...

83
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:31,939
"A swing in his walk."

84
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:35,578
"The twinkle in his eyes."

85
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,950
"And his usual mischief."

86
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:42,450
"Watch him win hearts."

87
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:45,783
"A swing in his walk."

88
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,226
"The twinkle in his eyes."

89
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,596
"And his usual mischief."

90
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,063
"Watch him win hearts."

91
00:10:56,157 --> 00:11:00,406
"Watch him walk and protect,
watch his bravery."

92
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:03,445
"Watch it... watch it..."

93
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:02,915
"He has a brave and lovely heart."

94
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:08,247
"He has a brave and lovely heart."

95
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:14,924
"And a sharp tongue.
Watch him throwing tantrums."

96
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:23,549
"Look at everything in depth,
the hearts are united."

97
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:27,876
"He invites enmity with enemy, but
love always flows in his heart."

98
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:30,947
"Watch it... watch it..."

99
00:13:36,242 --> 00:13:40,754
"The sparkle in his soul.
Eyes like darts."

100
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:46,093
"The sparkle in his soul.
Eyes like darts."

101
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:52,840
"Watch him make move,
he'd heal any wound."

102
00:13:53,295 --> 00:14:01,295
"Look at his expressions.
Watch him providing shelter."

103
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:05,724
"Anyone listening to him
will spread sweet notes."

104
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,987
"Watch it... watch it..."

105
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:27,140
Don't spare. C'mon.

106
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:56,408
Out of my way...

107
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:00,078
Out...!

108
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:08,355
Your nephew,
your own blood, has been shot at.

109
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:10,288
While we were fighting
for our dignity there...

110
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:12,298
...this guy was singing
and dancing away to glory...

111
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:14,460
...and this time he has created
a whole new record Baapji,

112
00:15:14,723 --> 00:15:18,903
he let that horrid man Bhavani
escape from right under my nose!

113
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:21,708
He saved the enemy's life.

114
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:23,302
- Poppat, go open the window.
- Yes sir.

115
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:24,879
Look at it this way, Baapji...

116
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:28,044
I saved Meghjibhai from
committing a murder.

117
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:30,117
We have been so
obsessed with killing...

118
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,882
...that we have forgotten
the value of life.

119
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:33,956
And why is everyone blaming me?

120
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:35,989
Why don't you all tell
Goli where to aim his piss.

121
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:36,924
Smart Boy.

122
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:41,969
You forget when you were
his age you killed one of their men?

123
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:43,899
It was an accident...
and I paid for it as well...

124
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:47,573
...you exiled me to Ahmedabad for
12 years to live with Bakula Aunt,

125
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:49,434
that crazy, old hag.

126
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,077
Bloody hell, it's sheer stupidity...

127
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:52,407
...to try and save
someone's life in Ranjaar...

128
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:53,445
Send me back if you wish...

129
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:55,345
Receive your call. It's ringing.

130
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:57,919
Bijal Baby,
I am coming... l am coming...

131
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,156
...right now a little tension,
later I will give you full attention.

132
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:06,825
See Baapji, look at this boy
he runs a video store of porn films,

133
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:09,100
deals in stolen cars...

134
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:10,528
Only girls on his mind...
mornings it's Bijal...

135
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:13,270
"afternoons for Sejal...
and for the night it's Kinjal."

136
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:19,111
With him around who needs an enemy?
The show off carries an empty gun!

137
00:16:19,197 --> 00:16:22,273
All you need is guts
to be a hero Meghjibhai,

138
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:24,784
so what is the point of
a loaded gun when I have guts?

139
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:26,978
Then what is the point
of having you around?

140
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:28,348
This place is only for men.

141
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:32,554
Hey! You can ask any girl in
the entire village about my man-hood.

142
00:16:32,813 --> 00:16:34,226
You will get an awesome report,
Meghjibhai.

143
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:36,456
Bhai... bhai... bhai... bhai...

144
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:38,864
And before I leave let me say this...

145
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:42,071
...we have used words,
we have used bullets...

146
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:44,996
...now is the time
to use our brains...

147
00:16:45,862 --> 00:16:48,175
...let's join hands with the enemy.

148
00:16:53,037 --> 00:16:55,041
Today these guns
have been raised at you,

149
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,488
next time you say this,
they will fire.

150
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:05,989
We might not have
Dhankor's wealth or power.

151
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:09,359
But we have the
courage to destroy her.

152
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:14,340
We take great pride in our clan
and our pride means everything to us.

153
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,210
Even an ocean which was
immersed in pride did not know...

154
00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:19,507
...that one day it will
become a barren desert,

155
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,516
if that ocean could
not sustain its pride...

156
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:24,610
...then what are we
com pared to it, Baapji.

157
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:32,190
Hey Poppat, open the window...

158
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:49,315
Ram has just returned and is already
having differences with his father.

159
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:53,579
I'm glad he is back otherwise
who would have saved him.

160
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:56,054
Mura, the bone is hurting...

161
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,217
Buahujoor,
the gun slipped out of my hand...

162
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,952
otherwise I would've
easily killed 4 or 5 Rajadis.

163
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:03,123
There was a cloudburst
in Uttarakhand...

164
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:06,729
well... well... sad... very sad...

165
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:09,439
My brother took a
bullet in his chest...

166
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:11,339
...are you sure the same
blood runs through your veins?

167
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:13,467
You know my blood is more
volatile than my father's...

168
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:16,446
I swear on you,
I swear on Goddess Am be,

169
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:18,242
I will kill each and every Rajadi.

170
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,751
Brain and brawn should
be used at the right time.

171
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:24,414
What do you think, Vanka?

172
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,956
Yes... yes!

173
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:28,252
What are you sitting here
and nodding your head for?

174
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:30,362
Spit it out, bhai!

175
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:35,699
Yes Hujoor, the court has
issued a notice in your name.

176
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:39,297
It is an enquiry regarding
the 4 murders last month.

177
00:18:39,427 --> 00:18:41,774
Oh! Regarding
the 4 murders last month,

178
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:45,106
what about the 6 which
will happen next month?

179
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:49,718
Forget about the past.

180
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,054
I told you, don't press the bone...

181
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:07,075
Vanka, bring your court here...

182
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:10,070
Dhankor will go nowhere.

183
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:12,076
Yes... of course Hujoor.

184
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:14,737
Ujjwal, where is Kanji?

185
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:17,347
Hujoor, I will call him right away...

186
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:26,157
You have come home after 10 long
days, I am not sparing you tonight.

187
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:27,159
Really?

188
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:29,264
Kanji bhai! Baa is calling you!

189
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,559
I need to go meet Baa, I
haven't met her since I've returned.

190
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,064
A lovely proposal has come for Leela,

191
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:34,364
I need to show the
boy's picture to Baa.

192
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:37,100
Show it to her later, you
have another priority right now...

193
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:38,538
Oh come on,
you will ruin all the photos.

194
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:40,406
Give me just one peek!

195
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:43,337
He must be from Ahmedabad!

196
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:44,607
He is an NRI...

197
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,574
You mean, Leela who is
like a red chilli will get...

198
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:48,551
...a groom who's
like a chocolate cake?

199
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:50,417
He will move in with
us post the wedding...

200
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:51,852
...we won't let him take Leela away.

201
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:53,749
You mean Leela won't
stay with her in-laws?

202
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:56,192
Let me tell you,

203
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:59,797
this kind of possessiveness
for your sister is ridiculous.

204
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,100
I also left my maternal
home post marriage.

205
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:04,429
So am I not possessive
about you as well?

206
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:10,208
Kanjibhai!

207
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:14,317
Attending your Baa and your sister's
whims and fancies all day long...

208
00:20:14,404 --> 00:20:15,645
...how will we ever make babies?

209
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:17,242
Kanji bhai, Baa is calling you!

210
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:20,415
Go and tell Baa,
Kanji will meet her after half...

211
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:23,121
...no, one hour.

212
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:25,892
Ujjwal, why has Kanji not come yet?

213
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:27,223
He is on his way, Hujoor.

214
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:29,434
This year's chilli crop
seems extremely fiery...

215
00:20:29,722 --> 00:20:31,431
Bhavani, taste and tell.

216
00:20:33,092 --> 00:20:33,832
Baa

217
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:37,110
Baa you asked for me?

218
00:20:37,397 --> 00:20:38,137
Pranaam!(Blessings).

219
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:41,478
You have been home for a while and now
you find the time to come and see me?

220
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:42,180
Baa, actually...

221
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:46,416
I know what happens behind
those closed doors all day long...

222
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:49,253
...when will we see the result of it?

223
00:20:49,678 --> 00:20:53,459
Any ways, what about the proposal
which has come for my Leela?

224
00:20:53,582 --> 00:20:57,592
He is an NRI, Baamgood,
simple guy... this is his photo.

225
00:20:57,754 --> 00:21:00,864
Never mind the photo...
call him over for Holi.

226
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:05,330
So Bhavani, what say?

227
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:07,776
Now use this fire...

228
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,649
...against the Rajadis.

229
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:18,119
We've held these Rajadis
on a leash for 25 years,

230
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,286
but now their guns are blaring.

231
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,629
Do me a favor let's play Holi...

232
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:26,861
Go away... Move!

233
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:30,629
Stop it all of you sex-starved
losers... come on... today is Holi!

234
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:34,803
Why wasting time watching porn,
when we can real fun outside!

235
00:21:34,897 --> 00:21:37,403
Oh go away!
The main scene is going on...

236
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,143
Hey Rambhai, Keshav is going
to get married soon, let him watch...

237
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:43,481
...he needs bedroom lessons otherwise
he will be clueless on his first night!

238
00:21:43,573 --> 00:21:46,318
What are friends for? We will
reach in time to do the needful.

239
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:48,655
Rambhai...

240
00:21:49,314 --> 00:21:54,827
Come on... today we will celebrate your
bachelor party in the Sanera Mansion!

241
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,661
What?

242
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:58,739
Obviously... we have already
enjoyed all the Rajadi girls.

243
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:01,240
Are you crazy? Has any
Rajadi ever gone there before?

244
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:04,711
We will go...
trust me the first time is the best.

245
00:22:04,832 --> 00:22:07,179
Celebrate Holi with the enemy?
Rubbish!

246
00:22:07,268 --> 00:22:09,409
If anyone sees us there,
they will shoot us on the spot!

247
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:11,281
We are not afraid, Baapla.

248
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:17,558
You loser! There is only one
kind of gun needed to play Holi...

249
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,218
...and that everyone has, right?

250
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:20,590
Of course!!!

251
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:23,566
Any ways, no one will
recognize us in the chaos...

252
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:26,569
...don't worry... we are safe.
I guarantee it.

253
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:31,374
Come on now... l will pay
for the next two porn films...

254
00:22:33,698 --> 00:22:36,045
...let's go,
I can't control it any more!

255
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:37,544
And see...

256
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:46,388
Watch out all of you Sanera girls,
I am coming!

257
00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:10,423
Happy Holi!

258
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:46,061
You betrayed us to the Rajadis?!

259
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:49,363
You coward! I swear, I will kill you!

260
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:50,561
Baa...

261
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:54,565
Welcome... Please com e. - Hey...

262
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:59,473
Baa, meet Karsanbhai,
our future son-in-law. - Welcome.

263
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:00,604
Good evening, Baa.

264
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:03,446
- God bless... Please take a seat.
- No, I'm fine.

265
00:25:04,606 --> 00:25:07,557
You have come all the way
from London, you must be hungry...

266
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:08,783
No thanks.

267
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:18,059
This is Aandva (testicles
in Gujarati) right?

268
00:25:18,156 --> 00:25:20,104
It's Haandva(a Gujarati delicacy),
not Aandva...

269
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:21,900
Ya... same thing... Aandva!

270
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,803
Haandva... H... H...

271
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:25,772
I craved so much
for this in London...

272
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:29,816
Ever smiling guy.
He is a good catch, Kanji.

273
00:25:30,603 --> 00:25:32,677
By the way Karsanbhai,
what do you do?

274
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:34,413
I am an Archaeologist.

275
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:35,249
Meaning?

276
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:38,586
It means we dig up old
structures and study them...

277
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,452
Really?

278
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,087
Studying, digging, restoring...
You know what I mean...

279
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:45,493
Umm... By the way what
is your family business?

280
00:25:45,688 --> 00:25:47,931
Shooting, smuggling, killing...

281
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:50,097
...you know, what I mean...

282
00:25:51,595 --> 00:25:53,474
Welcome to the family business...

283
00:25:55,499 --> 00:25:57,105
...oh, your hands are shaking?

284
00:25:57,635 --> 00:26:00,551
The day your hands stop shaking,
holding the gun...

285
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:02,811
...would be the correct
day for the wedding, right Kanji?

286
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:03,784
Yes Baa.

287
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:07,191
Karsan bhai, this is the family
you will get married into...

288
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:09,861
...and wishing you a very happy Holi!

289
00:26:09,983 --> 00:26:12,056
Happy Holi!

290
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,064
Greetings!

291
00:26:19,627 --> 00:26:22,304
Stop screwing around!
How much deeper do you want to go?

292
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,744
I will push in till the end,
Baapla...

293
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,212
I think you are trying
to bell the cat!

294
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:29,213
Hey! If you are scared, then leave...

295
00:26:45,824 --> 00:26:46,860
Hey!

296
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,584
Now how many times will
you change your clothes?

297
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:02,917
But I don't want to get married...

298
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,186
Baa has summoned you
so that's it...

299
00:27:07,716 --> 00:27:08,855
God bless you.

300
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:11,057
Karsan, meet my daughter Leela...

301
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:13,292
Hey Ram, let's go!

302
00:27:13,556 --> 00:27:15,936
She is the enemy's daughter!
Oh destiny!

303
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,297
We are star-crossed lovers!

304
00:27:18,562 --> 00:27:22,105
Leela, meet your groom.
Karsan from London...

305
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:24,980
...Kanji has chosen him for you.

306
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:27,048
Happy Holi, Miss Leela...

307
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:31,121
I will be honored
if you agree to marry me.

308
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:32,722
Congratulations!

309
00:27:32,812 --> 00:27:35,091
It's agreed then... touch
the feet and take the blessings now.

310
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:40,391
Touch the feet!

311
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:42,132
Hey...

312
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:46,732
He is such a catch!

313
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,170
Oh, she is so coy!

314
00:27:57,107 --> 00:27:58,246
Happy Holi!

315
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:21,326
"As my heart soars up to join you."

316
00:28:22,603 --> 00:28:27,609
"It leaves this world
behind for you..."

317
00:28:53,706 --> 00:29:01,395
"I've tasted blood."

318
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:09,229
"The sleeping desire in my
veins has now awakened."

319
00:29:10,826 --> 00:29:14,174
"I've tasted blood."

320
00:29:15,831 --> 00:29:20,046
"By touching of lips..."

321
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:25,346
"...from the corner of dreams."

322
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,016
"By touching of lips..."

323
00:29:28,112 --> 00:29:31,187
"...from the corner of dreams."

324
00:29:31,382 --> 00:29:36,394
This bloodlust has brought
us together forever...

325
00:29:37,957 --> 00:29:45,714
"I've tasted blood."

326
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:51,413
"I've tasted blood."

327
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:43,112
"Today this mad one is
roaming here and there..."

328
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:52,955
"Today, the breath is stuck
with him only."

329
00:30:57,215 --> 00:31:02,830
"It used to flow freely.
It used to remain full to brim."

330
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:11,911
"It used to flow freely.
It used to remain full to brim."

331
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:16,077
"I don't know when it
went away taking my life."

332
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:21,656
"Lips, touched lips, touched blood."

333
00:31:23,312 --> 00:31:26,820
"I've tasted blood."

334
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:31,067
"I've tasted blood."

335
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:39,277
"The sleeping desire in my
veins has now awakened."

336
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:43,076
"I've tasted blood."

337
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:53,371
"By touching of lips,
from the corner of dreams."

338
00:31:55,282 --> 00:32:00,362
"By touching of lips,
from the corner of dreams."

339
00:32:01,023 --> 00:32:05,909
"Lips, touched lips,
touched blood."

340
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,209
"I've tasted blood."

341
00:32:12,469 --> 00:32:15,214
"I've tasted blood."

342
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:20,225
"I've tasted blood."

343
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:19,521
Despite all our wealth and clout,

344
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:21,958
those boys managed
to saunter into our house.

345
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,790
How to recognize the enemy in
all that color and chaos, Kanjibhai!

346
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:27,972
Idiot, you don't need to
see the enemy, you sense him.

347
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:31,402
And Vanka,
I heard those Rajadis have hidden...

348
00:33:31,494 --> 00:33:32,974
...a huge stock of
bullets in their home...

349
00:33:33,296 --> 00:33:34,139
Should I be giving you
this information?

350
00:33:34,231 --> 00:33:35,712
I was just about to tell you, but...

351
00:33:35,966 --> 00:33:37,241
But what?

352
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:40,041
We have to clip their wings Vanka.

353
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:42,749
Listen, Radhubhai
has gone on a pilgrimage.

354
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:45,155
And his two sons Ram and
Meghji are completely useless.

355
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:46,384
I agree.

356
00:33:46,478 --> 00:33:49,155
Now do you want me to spell
out what needs to be done next?

357
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:53,665
You know I like the color of money,
so do you want me to spell out...

358
00:33:55,088 --> 00:33:56,569
...what needs to be done next?

359
00:33:57,658 --> 00:34:02,545
Here, as much as you want.

360
00:34:03,265 --> 00:34:05,076
But beware,

361
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:09,349
if I ever see any
Rajadi around my Leela,

362
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:12,784
then you will pay
for it with your blood.

363
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,519
Come on now Ram...

364
00:34:16,713 --> 00:34:19,094
we are fed up...

365
00:34:19,216 --> 00:34:23,692
...we have been waiting for hours
but not a glimpse of that girl.

366
00:34:23,788 --> 00:34:24,631
Let's leave now!

367
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:26,031
Not without seeing her...

368
00:34:26,124 --> 00:34:27,229
I can't control any more,
I am going in!

369
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,863
Don't stop me!
She is all I can think about!

370
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:30,541
Then you need to get your
thoughts out of your pants!

371
00:34:30,596 --> 00:34:33,136
Right now my heart, my thoughts
everything is in my pants!

372
00:34:33,232 --> 00:34:36,045
- But how will you find her room?
- Very simple.

373
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:37,616
Moonlight will stream
out of her windows...

374
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:38,776
"because she is the moon itself!"

375
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:41,043
Hey Romeo, what if it turns
out to be her mother's room?

376
00:34:41,141 --> 00:34:42,144
Then arrange for my funeral!

377
00:34:42,243 --> 00:34:43,484
And what if it's her brother's room?

378
00:34:43,577 --> 00:34:45,217
Then arrange for His funeral!

379
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:47,762
I hope you are aware what will happen
if you enter the wrong room?

380
00:34:47,883 --> 00:34:51,893
But can you imagine what all
can happen if I enter the right room?

381
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:53,761
You will be the death of us.

382
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:23,660
Gosh... it's you?

383
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:25,830
You've come till here?

384
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:27,871
If you want I can come till there...

385
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:30,878
Have you lost your mind, if someone
sees you, you will be in big trouble!

386
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:32,705
I am already in trouble...

387
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:35,284
...you have taken my breath away
and I need it back!

388
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:38,356
So take it and leave, any ways
we don't keep anything of strangers.

389
00:35:38,442 --> 00:35:39,387
Stranger?

390
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:41,488
Have you forgotten how
you colored this stranger?

391
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:43,320
How can I forget that?

392
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,735
Hey there, wait up,
I have come to tell you a secret...

393
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,334
- What?
- Secret!

394
00:36:13,315 --> 00:36:14,317
- Hi!
- Hi!

395
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:16,559
So what's the secret?

396
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:19,762
Listen, get this straight...

397
00:36:19,856 --> 00:36:23,535
...don't fall in love with me
I am a Rajadi, your enemy!

398
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:26,170
Enemy?

399
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:29,677
No wonder our eyes were battling...

400
00:36:30,002 --> 00:36:31,175
Wow!

401
00:36:31,336 --> 00:36:33,546
You are as sexy as
you are dangerous...

402
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:36,953
And you are as dangerous
as you are cocky!

403
00:36:37,209 --> 00:36:38,781
That's why I have an awesome idea...

404
00:36:39,011 --> 00:36:40,013
...let's change our last names!

405
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:41,625
Then I won't be a Rajadi
and you won't be a Sanera...

406
00:36:41,715 --> 00:36:42,751
Simple. Problem solved.

407
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:45,263
Will you eat a rose
if you start calling it rice?

408
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,429
- What's in a name?
- Good point!

409
00:36:49,524 --> 00:36:50,526
Leela!!!

410
00:36:50,591 --> 00:36:51,297
Oh Lord Ram!

411
00:36:51,392 --> 00:36:52,702
How beautiful my name
sounds when you say it!

412
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:53,740
- What?
- Ram!

413
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:55,366
Leela! Ram Leela!

414
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:56,374
Leela...

415
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:58,208
- Wait... I'm coming!
- I am sleeping!

416
00:36:58,801 --> 00:36:59,542
Shut up, I am coming!

417
00:36:59,702 --> 00:37:02,915
- Hey, what are you doing? Go.
- Yes, but Leave me...

418
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:04,486
Where are you going?

419
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:06,047
Hey, Leela...

420
00:37:06,277 --> 00:37:06,880
On my Way!

421
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,323
Why aren't you opening the door?

422
00:37:08,412 --> 00:37:10,656
What is that noise
coming from your room?

423
00:37:10,749 --> 00:37:11,888
A peacock has entered my room!

424
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,399
Forget the peacock,
Baa is calling you downstairs...

425
00:37:14,486 --> 00:37:15,762
You go ahead, I will come in a bit...

426
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:17,061
Come soon!

427
00:37:22,495 --> 00:37:23,908
Now you have reached my bed?

428
00:37:25,332 --> 00:37:27,245
Your bed is as hot as you.

429
00:37:27,334 --> 00:37:29,338
Quite daring you are...
risked your life and came here!

430
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,917
Am I that beautiful?

431
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:34,449
Yes! I will give up my life for
you... take a bullet right here...

432
00:37:34,576 --> 00:37:36,251
...on my chest.

433
00:37:36,344 --> 00:37:38,691
Oh! You have absolutely
no hair on your chest!

434
00:37:38,781 --> 00:37:40,490
Oh! Neither do you...

435
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:42,863
There is a saying around here,

436
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:45,435
a man with a hairless chest
cannot be trusted.

437
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:47,266
Forget about trusting me...
just marry me.

438
00:37:47,424 --> 00:37:49,030
Marry you?

439
00:37:49,593 --> 00:37:50,595
Ok fine.

440
00:37:50,661 --> 00:37:53,042
I have been desperately
waiting for my wedding day.

441
00:37:53,364 --> 00:37:55,312
You agreed so easily!

442
00:37:56,502 --> 00:37:58,883
Haven't I waited
so long for you already?

443
00:38:01,474 --> 00:38:02,681
What...?

444
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:05,716
Come on give me your cell number.

445
00:38:07,781 --> 00:38:09,285
Here... my business card,
freshly printed.

446
00:38:09,683 --> 00:38:11,460
Ram Rajadi. 3G Businessman.

447
00:38:11,552 --> 00:38:12,554
I will call you if I feel like...

448
00:38:12,654 --> 00:38:14,134
And if I feel like,
I will come to meet you.

449
00:38:15,724 --> 00:38:17,330
I forgot to write my
address on it, should I?

450
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:18,370
- Aey!
- Aey!

451
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,337
Aey!

452
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:21,899
Aey...

453
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:23,403
Aey...

454
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:24,812
Aey...

455
00:38:25,035 --> 00:38:26,071
Aey...

456
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:27,546
Aey...

457
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,079
Well, even the peacocks want it now.

458
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:33,151
Want what?

459
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:37,387
What you want...
what I want... to make love...

460
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,827
Peacocks don't do all this...

461
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,899
...they just spread
their wings and dance.

462
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:45,361
Not dance, its romance.

463
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,037
See, just like before doing it,
we spread ourselves...

464
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,538
...they spread their wings...

465
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,674
Leela, what are you up to?

466
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:58,046
Hasn't your peacock left yet?

467
00:38:58,674 --> 00:39:00,883
I am trying to shoo it away.

468
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,354
You better come down fast,

469
00:39:02,444 --> 00:39:05,361
or else Kanjibhai will be here with
his gun to get rid of your peacock!

470
00:39:05,448 --> 00:39:07,863
Okay, listen!

471
00:39:08,585 --> 00:39:10,032
Leave! Go!

472
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:11,700
Leela!

473
00:39:11,755 --> 00:39:13,566
I am coming, bhabhi!

474
00:39:25,704 --> 00:39:26,878
Leela!

475
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:30,453
She is bad news to our romance!
Call me! - Yes! Leave now!

476
00:39:32,813 --> 00:39:33,919
Hey listen...

477
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:36,154
Yes, tell me...

478
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:17,773
Receive your call, it's ringing.

479
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:25,781
Hmm. I was peacefully
asleep in thy heart...

480
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,552
...is it from there
that you pulled out my card?

481
00:40:28,878 --> 00:40:31,886
Grapes are green,
Bananas appear gold,

482
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:34,556
Leela belongs to Ram
the whole world has been told.

483
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:39,166
Through the night, you have
sent 48 such stupid messages.

484
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:40,698
Where the hell are you?

485
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:43,138
After meeting you,
I have only been flying...

486
00:40:43,228 --> 00:40:45,507
...in the barren desert all night,
I kept lying.

487
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:51,151
You're still at it?
Didn't you sleep at all?

488
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:54,219
A knife cuts an apple,
an apple is cut by a knife,

489
00:40:54,474 --> 00:40:56,650
you worry for me like
you're already my wife.

490
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,660
Awesome,
so come over and make my life!

491
00:41:01,582 --> 00:41:04,065
I feel like seeing you.

492
00:41:04,553 --> 00:41:05,760
My Baapji is out of town...

493
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:07,859
...baby, so I will have to
manage the gun shop. You come over.

494
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:13,534
Then I will fly to you like a plane,
for it won't be in vain,

495
00:41:13,663 --> 00:41:15,771
let Baa kill me,
for you I will suffer any pain.

496
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:19,280
Darling, I don't think
you Saneras are daring enough...

497
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,716
...to venture into enemy lane.

498
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,883
Don't you dare me
or I'll pull the trigger.

499
00:41:26,011 --> 00:41:27,252
So go ahead, Pull it!

500
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:50,252
Lady, here's your Happy Ending shop,

501
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:52,913
give me 10 rupees in change...
I don't have any change.

502
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,730
Whoa hottie! It's you?

503
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:07,895
You dared me, right!

504
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,075
See, I am here in the Rajadi side...

505
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,805
...walked out from
right under Baa's nose.

506
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,179
Now go pay the Chhakda
(scooter) driver...

507
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:17,811
Loser!

508
00:42:17,905 --> 00:42:19,818
Hurry up, everyone.

509
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,787
Loser no... your Lover yes!

510
00:42:27,148 --> 00:42:29,757
Hey! You deserve a 100!

511
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,434
Why did you pull down
the shutter during business hours?

512
00:42:41,665 --> 00:42:46,450
I don't care about this business...
this is any ways my brother's shop...

513
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:48,653
I don't like guns, bullets or fights,
I only prefer blouses that are tight.

514
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:52,054
Looks like you are useless...
I'm sure you don't make any money?

515
00:42:52,144 --> 00:42:53,181
Honey I make a lot of money!

516
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:53,985
- Really?
- Yes.

517
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,693
I have a 3G business!

518
00:42:56,182 --> 00:42:57,390
G for Garage of stolen cars,

519
00:42:57,651 --> 00:42:59,326
G for Grade C adult
films' video store...

520
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:03,907
...G for handling the
Girls of this village...

521
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,367
I'm a busy man you see.

522
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:07,972
Hey, busy man...

523
00:43:09,297 --> 00:43:12,042
I have fallen for you, I want you.

524
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:13,971
Hey!

525
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:16,344
Your Baa doesn't own me...

526
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:18,650
...did you ask for my permission?

527
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:19,652
What if I am not interested in you?

528
00:43:19,977 --> 00:43:22,220
I will make you mine...

529
00:43:23,314 --> 00:43:24,989
What about your darling Karsan?

530
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:26,997
Yuck! I will shoo him away...

531
00:43:27,085 --> 00:43:28,657
What if your family objects?

532
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,356
I will convince them...

533
00:43:29,754 --> 00:43:31,326
What if I leave you?

534
00:43:39,332 --> 00:43:40,677
I will kill you.

535
00:44:05,295 --> 00:44:10,752
"A game of bullets and kisses."

536
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:15,448
"As playful as the love
between you and me..."

537
00:44:26,987 --> 00:44:30,495
"A game of bullets and kisses."

538
00:44:32,394 --> 00:44:35,811
"As playful as the love
between you and me..."

539
00:44:37,767 --> 00:44:40,410
"A game of bullets and kisses."

540
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,113
"As playful as the love
between you and me..."

541
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:47,249
"This is... Love at war!"

542
00:44:48,245 --> 00:44:53,428
"This is... Love at war!"

543
00:44:53,518 --> 00:44:58,097
"This is... Love at war!"

544
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:36,814
"You're a fighter
plane but you're my life."

545
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:42,156
"Our bed is a battle field."

546
00:45:42,342 --> 00:45:47,491
"You're a fighter plane
but you're my life."

547
00:45:48,048 --> 00:45:52,524
"Our bed is a battle field."

548
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:58,270
"if you press the trigger,
I'll play kisses."

549
00:45:58,426 --> 00:46:01,343
"if you press the trigger,
I'll play kisses."

550
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:05,007
"This is... Love at war!"

551
00:46:06,503 --> 00:46:11,686
"This is... Love at war!"

552
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:17,024
"This is... Love at war!"

553
00:46:17,282 --> 00:46:22,397
"This is... Love at war!"

554
00:46:22,588 --> 00:46:27,977
"This is... Love at war!"

555
00:46:31,298 --> 00:46:33,372
Smile please, look up a little...

556
00:46:33,467 --> 00:46:34,105
That's it.

557
00:46:34,202 --> 00:46:36,480
Hey bhai, enough now, go away!

558
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:37,372
Thank you.

559
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:42,883
Miss Leela!

560
00:46:42,978 --> 00:46:45,051
Hey! What are you doing here?

561
00:46:45,548 --> 00:46:47,052
I had left you at the temple, right?

562
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,631
What would have I told Baa,
had you got lost?

563
00:46:48,885 --> 00:46:49,887
Nice...

564
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:51,657
What photos are these?

565
00:46:51,922 --> 00:46:54,064
I am clicking pictures
of these villagers for my book.

566
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:56,734
By the way, where can I
find those naked tribal women?

567
00:46:58,296 --> 00:46:59,435
You Rascal!

568
00:46:59,564 --> 00:47:02,742
- I am sorry, Leela. - Scoot!
- Sorry, Leela.

569
00:47:02,968 --> 00:47:04,176
Hey!

570
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:12,615
We have orders...

571
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,454
...to raid this place!

572
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:30,640
Move, get back!

573
00:47:49,655 --> 00:47:53,334
Oh, so you have pickled
the bullets as well?

574
00:47:54,295 --> 00:47:56,140
Turn on that tap...

575
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:59,170
...these buggers might
even be bathing with bullets...

576
00:47:59,401 --> 00:48:01,314
Hey! So what Vanka?

577
00:48:01,636 --> 00:48:05,714
You know very well we
deal in bullets, not in roses!

578
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:10,156
The license is for the shop,
not home.

579
00:48:10,212 --> 00:48:13,162
It's illegal to store
bullets in the house.

580
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,390
Tell you what Vanka,

581
00:48:16,253 --> 00:48:18,361
you've acted really well
as a Police officer,

582
00:48:19,056 --> 00:48:20,332
now keep this payment
for your performance as well.

583
00:48:20,391 --> 00:48:23,170
You've said this today,
don't ever say it again.

584
00:48:23,228 --> 00:48:25,336
I'm an honest man.

585
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:28,176
You will have to come
to the Police station.

586
00:48:28,334 --> 00:48:30,681
Come on Vanka bhai,

587
00:48:32,238 --> 00:48:33,047
before we go to the police station,

588
00:48:33,173 --> 00:48:35,713
why don't you come upstairs and check
the awesome stuff stashed in here.

589
00:48:36,176 --> 00:48:39,093
I guarantee you will be satisfied.

590
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:44,191
What vast difference between
the two brothers... l am coming.

591
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:46,235
With a brother like
him who needs an enemy?

592
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:49,573
You are such an honest man Rambhai,

593
00:48:50,192 --> 00:48:52,197
you willingly shared the information.

594
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:55,105
Oh, I have a very helpful nature,
Vanka bhai.

595
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,542
Leave...- Listen!

596
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:05,654
Hmm... make sure you check
every nook and corner...

597
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:08,592
...not a single bullet
should escape the eye.

598
00:49:08,747 --> 00:49:10,056
Let me go.

599
00:49:10,716 --> 00:49:14,464
This... is a bomb not a
bullet Rambhai... what a film!

600
00:49:14,754 --> 00:49:16,463
Dirty film. Part 2.

601
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:19,800
It is fire on ice.

602
00:49:20,728 --> 00:49:22,903
Fully Fresh! Full raunchy!

603
00:49:23,131 --> 00:49:24,076
My guarantee!

604
00:49:24,399 --> 00:49:27,144
This was the place to raid, Rambhai.

605
00:49:27,235 --> 00:49:28,773
Let's assume that's what happened.

606
00:49:29,405 --> 00:49:32,856
So, can I keep all these DVD's?

607
00:49:33,275 --> 00:49:34,779
So, can I keep all these bullets?

608
00:49:37,314 --> 00:49:43,328
Listen guys, forget the bullets,
and grab these DVD's!

609
00:49:43,654 --> 00:49:45,762
Quite a colorful man you are.

610
00:49:46,491 --> 00:49:48,096
I am so glad your raid was a success.

611
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,266
You have found the ladder to success,

612
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:53,678
now you can even jump
on Hariganga with it.

613
00:49:54,433 --> 00:49:56,540
The truth is Rambhai,
I just don't understand,

614
00:49:56,636 --> 00:49:59,450
had we come to raid or get raided.

615
00:50:01,642 --> 00:50:05,686
That Rajadi Ram ruined the raid
and saved all the bullets.

616
00:50:05,813 --> 00:50:07,795
Now those bastards
are celebrating.

617
00:50:08,716 --> 00:50:10,459
And your bloody Vanka also
turned out to be a turncoat,

618
00:50:11,186 --> 00:50:12,895
he got money from you
and pleasure from them.

619
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,167
Yes, Brother!

620
00:50:19,296 --> 00:50:25,413
God bless me and my brethren!

621
00:50:25,503 --> 00:50:31,688
God bless me and my brethren!

622
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:34,886
Yes, Brother!

623
00:50:47,595 --> 00:50:50,671
Yes, Brother!

624
00:50:53,936 --> 00:50:56,749
May no evil befall upon us ever!

625
00:50:56,872 --> 00:51:03,422
For the evil has been won
over by us once again!

626
00:51:03,514 --> 00:51:05,895
Yes, Brother!

627
00:51:06,617 --> 00:51:12,803
God bless me and my brethren!

628
00:51:12,891 --> 00:51:19,042
God bless me and my brethren!

629
00:51:19,265 --> 00:51:20,473
Yes, Brother!

630
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:24,275
Hmm... you have clicked some
good pictures, Karsan bhai.

631
00:51:24,371 --> 00:51:25,373
Thank you...

632
00:51:25,806 --> 00:51:27,583
You should click my pictures too!

633
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:28,881
Whenever you say, Baa.

634
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,620
Oh, this one is special...

635
00:51:34,283 --> 00:51:36,960
Take a look, Kanji.
Kanji!

636
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:41,506
If you are done counting
Rajadi bullets then look at this.

637
00:51:44,795 --> 00:51:46,572
What were you doing
in the Rajadi area, Leela?

638
00:51:48,732 --> 00:51:50,338
Answer me! Why did you go there?

639
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:54,681
I am asking you something, Leela!

640
00:51:54,773 --> 00:51:57,313
You only asked me to show
the entire village to Karsan...

641
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:01,587
...and he insisted on seeing
the gun market. He took me there.

642
00:52:01,747 --> 00:52:03,023
- But, Miss Leela...
- Shut up!

643
00:52:03,984 --> 00:52:05,363
Or else I will tell everyone...

644
00:52:05,452 --> 00:52:07,297
...you were after
the naked tribal girls.

645
00:52:08,022 --> 00:52:09,628
Pervert!

646
00:52:10,024 --> 00:52:11,596
What a cute couple...

647
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,603
Now we should not delay
the wedding any further...

648
00:52:14,762 --> 00:52:15,970
Start the preparations.

649
00:52:16,297 --> 00:52:18,439
Bhavani, you book the caterers

650
00:52:18,534 --> 00:52:20,607
and that Henna girl from Surat.
And Rasila...

651
00:52:20,803 --> 00:52:21,715
Yes, Baa?

652
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:23,452
Take her latest measurements.

653
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:27,848
Her wedding dress will be
made tomorrow itself. - Okay.

654
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:36,355
Oh, she is so coy.

655
00:52:39,959 --> 00:52:43,809
Leela, why did you walk away?
You are so short tempered.

656
00:52:43,896 --> 00:52:45,879
Did I commit a sin by
going to the Rajadi area?

657
00:52:45,966 --> 00:52:48,848
It is a sin to build a
relationship with the Rajadis.

658
00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:51,986
I know what's going on...
and which Peacock visits your room.

659
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,717
Then go ahead
snitch on me and finish the matter.

660
00:52:55,009 --> 00:52:57,652
No matter what,
Baa will get you married to Karsan.

661
00:52:57,712 --> 00:52:59,318
We have a lot of work,
come on let's take your measurements.

662
00:52:59,414 --> 00:53:01,419
Why give measurements when
I don't want to get married...

663
00:53:03,553 --> 00:53:05,900
Hmm... he is calling right?

664
00:53:06,356 --> 00:53:07,928
Go ahead get us both killed!

665
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:12,400
What is it? Why are you calling me?
Why didn't you come?

666
00:53:12,663 --> 00:53:13,836
Your waist size must be 28, right?

667
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:16,378
No, it might be 24,
but where are you?

668
00:53:16,701 --> 00:53:17,772
And hips? Forty Two?

669
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,352
Forget about the hips!
Why are you taking my measurements?

670
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:22,384
Tell me, is your bosom 36?

671
00:53:22,508 --> 00:53:24,456
Not 36! 136!

672
00:53:26,546 --> 00:53:28,585
136! Wow my large hearted girlfriend!

673
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:30,857
Come here... let me
drown in your bosom.

674
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:33,731
Enough... now stop fooling around,
there is a big problem.

675
00:53:34,522 --> 00:53:35,399
Oh come here...

676
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:36,866
Tell me what has happened?

677
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,705
Listen I think Baa might
be aware of our love story...

678
00:53:41,863 --> 00:53:43,777
...she is preponing my wedding,
something needs to be done.

679
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:45,705
So let's start by
taking your measurements...

680
00:53:46,035 --> 00:53:46,741
...neck...

681
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:48,772
...like a peacock...

682
00:53:49,539 --> 00:53:51,954
...long and beautiful...
and where your neck ends...

683
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:55,550
...your waist starts...
like a deer...

684
00:53:56,213 --> 00:53:57,990
...so slim and appealing.

685
00:53:58,082 --> 00:54:01,158
And your butt is like this garden,

686
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,737
it will remain here long
after I'm married and gone...

687
00:54:08,627 --> 00:54:09,573
Leela?

688
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,737
I'm going to my room. Don't follow me!

689
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:14,941
What don't follow me,
see I have bought an adult film CD.

690
00:54:15,136 --> 00:54:17,449
The title is,
Enemy Desire Pants on Fire.

691
00:54:17,572 --> 00:54:19,076
First let's watch and then copy them.

692
00:54:19,807 --> 00:54:23,156
You keep fooling around, but will you
ever try to understand my situation?

693
00:54:24,112 --> 00:54:27,256
You think I don't understand?

694
00:54:28,084 --> 00:54:29,929
There is only one
solution for our situation.

695
00:54:30,186 --> 00:54:31,758
We will have to elope.

696
00:54:31,955 --> 00:54:33,265
Tomorrow itself.

697
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:36,273
I will come to pick
you up at 8 o'clock.

698
00:54:37,162 --> 00:54:37,663
Promise?

699
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:42,212
I guarantee it. Just be ready with
your deadly figure and fiery trigger!

700
00:54:42,534 --> 00:54:45,815
Yes and I will get
snacks and sweets as well!

701
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,791
Did you call me sweets? - You're my
sweets. I will eat you up!

702
00:55:01,055 --> 00:55:02,502
How are you Rambhai?

703
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:04,162
You look quite in the mood today!

704
00:55:06,461 --> 00:55:08,239
Here he comes.

705
00:55:09,898 --> 00:55:12,006
Lord Cupid is coming.

706
00:55:12,569 --> 00:55:15,051
Now wait and just
listen to his tales...

707
00:55:17,308 --> 00:55:20,521
So Rambhai... how was your night?

708
00:55:20,978 --> 00:55:22,892
Spent the night upright... on a tree.

709
00:55:22,981 --> 00:55:24,724
Actually, he was lying down.

710
00:55:24,817 --> 00:55:26,492
Tell the truth, who is the girl?

711
00:55:26,652 --> 00:55:28,827
Hey, the first name is amazing...

712
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,766
...but her last name is blazing!

713
00:55:30,857 --> 00:55:33,203
Brilliant! bhai...

714
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,836
Make sure you watch
the news tonight...

715
00:55:35,896 --> 00:55:37,707
I am about to change
Ranjaar's history.

716
00:55:38,766 --> 00:55:40,941
Hello, what is going on?

717
00:55:42,037 --> 00:55:44,076
Hey Kanjibhai!

718
00:55:47,276 --> 00:55:50,693
Damn, spoiled the whole mood!

719
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,962
Forget it, Meghjibhai.
It's my job to tame the enemy.

720
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,926
Hasn't Radhu taught you...

721
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,570
...that if you spit on the sky,
you'll dirty your own face?

722
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,904
What do I do? Actually it's
your face... that angers me...

723
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:05,541
So I spat out the rage.

724
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:11,810
After seeing you I realized
Sanera clan has men as well.

725
00:56:12,738 --> 00:56:16,121
Really? Show me one Rajadi man
who has the guts to face me.

726
00:56:16,276 --> 00:56:17,621
Hey get out!

727
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:19,887
That's hardly a challenge for us now
go away... your face is such a turn off.

728
00:56:20,782 --> 00:56:21,989
Hey! You rascal!

729
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,928
Why? Felt bad?

730
00:56:25,053 --> 00:56:26,124
Will you complain to your Baa?

731
00:56:26,288 --> 00:56:27,393
This gun, is my Baa.

732
00:56:27,623 --> 00:56:28,625
Hey, what is the big deal...

733
00:56:28,724 --> 00:56:29,931
Now my gun doesn't
like too much complaining...

734
00:56:30,058 --> 00:56:31,664
...it might get angry
and blow your brains out.

735
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,743
Calm down Meghjibhai!

736
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,675
Why pull out a gun
at the drop of a hat?

737
00:56:35,765 --> 00:56:37,144
I don't like this ok...

738
00:56:38,302 --> 00:56:42,687
Kanjibhai, welcome to Janta Bazar.

739
00:56:42,773 --> 00:56:44,915
Make love not war.

740
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,117
Have juice... Have tea, enjoy.

741
00:56:47,245 --> 00:56:48,749
...just relax...

742
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,689
...and keep your cool... let it go.

743
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:52,957
Why do you fight all the time?

744
00:56:59,026 --> 00:57:00,803
Those who attack from the rear,

745
00:57:00,928 --> 00:57:03,377
don't have the tools
to fire from the front.

746
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,840
Oh, is that why you attacked us from
behind... by arranging that raid?

747
00:57:07,936 --> 00:57:09,042
Meghjibhai!

748
00:57:09,138 --> 00:57:10,140
Hey Kanjibhai...

749
00:57:10,272 --> 00:57:12,778
...raid failed because our police
is busy chasing skirts... not bullets!

750
00:57:12,842 --> 00:57:15,849
I should have killed you
on Holi itself, bloody outlaw.

751
00:57:15,945 --> 00:57:17,688
Don't call me an outlaw,
brother-in-law!

752
00:57:18,615 --> 00:57:20,722
I have a few lines
to say about in-laws...

753
00:57:20,817 --> 00:57:21,956
Go on bhai...!

754
00:57:22,053 --> 00:57:25,162
Whilst you were all busy
with their guns and triggers.

755
00:57:25,389 --> 00:57:28,863
I was enjoying the
enemy's killer figure!!

756
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,306
Wow bhai! Very nice!

757
00:57:41,308 --> 00:57:45,318
Oh you killed me... l am dead...

758
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,826
Enough now, get up.

759
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:50,999
Look at how well the Rajadis shoot!

760
00:57:51,386 --> 00:57:53,334
Come on... take a decent shot!

761
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:08,949
This is called an aim! Sanera aim!
Now, show me.

762
00:58:13,913 --> 00:58:16,020
Rascals!

763
00:58:21,221 --> 00:58:22,861
Carefully, Kanjibhai. Watch out.

764
00:58:25,692 --> 00:58:28,198
This bullet grazed my heart.

765
00:58:29,531 --> 00:58:30,772
Oh no!

766
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:32,976
Come on take one more shot.

767
00:58:33,234 --> 00:58:34,772
Break it, Kanjibhai.

768
00:58:40,877 --> 00:58:42,790
That was brilliant!

769
00:58:48,986 --> 00:58:55,434
Oh, lovely performance Meghjibhai!
Oscar! Oscar!

770
00:59:11,145 --> 00:59:13,992
You should go Kanjibhai... now!

771
01:00:50,594 --> 01:00:55,242
The soul can never be cut
into pieces by any weapon.

772
01:00:55,366 --> 01:00:58,282
Nor can it be burned by fire.

773
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:04,993
Nor moistened by water.

774
01:01:06,045 --> 01:01:13,438
Rasila, make sure no Rajadi
bullet stays in my Kanji's body.

775
01:01:16,725 --> 01:01:18,900
He needs to go away clean.

776
01:02:15,225 --> 01:02:17,640
- How could you shoot?
- Leela, listen to me!

777
01:02:18,029 --> 01:02:18,632
- Please hear me out, Leela!

778
01:02:18,696 --> 01:02:21,043
Ultimately you proved
you are a Rajadi!

779
01:02:21,232 --> 01:02:26,187
Don't touch me Ram,
he was my only brother!

780
01:02:26,305 --> 01:02:27,479
I too had just one brother.

781
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,522
You would've done
the same thing in my place.

782
01:02:29,975 --> 01:02:31,422
I am in your place.

783
01:02:35,382 --> 01:02:36,657
I have wronged you...

784
01:02:38,418 --> 01:02:40,401
punish me or hold my hand.

785
01:02:40,822 --> 01:02:42,497
How do I hold your hand?

786
01:02:43,425 --> 01:02:45,498
I can see my brother's blood on it.

787
01:02:47,763 --> 01:02:50,508
It's over.

788
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,843
How is it over?

789
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,278
How?

790
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,582
Now we are joined, by blood.

791
01:03:02,047 --> 01:03:04,724
Let's leave from here,
else this enmity will engulf us.

792
01:03:06,285 --> 01:03:08,699
Whole world is gunning for me...

793
01:03:08,753 --> 01:03:11,533
...there are a 100 reasons to die,
only 1 to live...

794
01:03:13,193 --> 01:03:14,366
You!

795
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,240
So you have embraced
your brother's killer, Leela?

796
01:03:24,706 --> 01:03:28,157
Shameless, selfish & incorrigible...

797
01:03:30,045 --> 01:03:31,617
But that is how love is, right?

798
01:03:33,884 --> 01:03:39,431
I have lost my love, but this is
your only chance, go with him Leela.

799
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:42,775
But how can I leave Baa
and you in this situation.

800
01:03:42,894 --> 01:03:43,771
It would be wrong.

801
01:03:43,895 --> 01:03:48,280
It might be wrong for the world,
but for me,

802
01:03:48,601 --> 01:03:50,810
your love is the
only right thing Leela.

803
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:54,621
In his anger he chose hatred,
you choose love.

804
01:03:56,242 --> 01:03:57,416
Enough...

805
01:03:58,245 --> 01:04:02,824
"please go away before
I change my mind."

806
01:04:35,388 --> 01:04:37,837
It's Baam again.

807
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:30,762
Everything will be fine...

808
01:05:30,852 --> 01:05:34,703
...now this is our life,
no fear... no revenge.

809
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:36,567
We will live happily...

810
01:05:37,226 --> 01:05:39,732
...give me your word
we will never look back...

811
01:05:41,865 --> 01:05:43,312
...promise me.

812
01:05:49,707 --> 01:05:50,379
Who is it?

813
01:05:50,475 --> 01:05:52,388
Bapu... Towel... soap, hot water.

814
01:05:52,444 --> 01:05:54,323
- Don't need.
- Anything to eat, Bapu?

815
01:05:54,412 --> 01:05:55,757
No nothing, go away.

816
01:05:55,881 --> 01:05:57,726
Ok enjoy your honeymoon, sir.

817
01:06:08,729 --> 01:06:10,733
You are still thinking
of the past, right?

818
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:16,850
I'm thinking this...

819
01:06:17,739 --> 01:06:19,813
...bed might be too hard for you.

820
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:21,951
Then I'll sleep on you.

821
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,288
What are you thinking now?

822
01:06:28,419 --> 01:06:29,991
I am thinking,

823
01:06:30,421 --> 01:06:32,768
will our child be
a Rajadi or a Sanera?

824
01:07:02,558 --> 01:07:03,971
Is it Baa?

825
01:07:05,729 --> 01:07:06,834
You speak to her...
I will get something to eat.

826
01:07:06,963 --> 01:07:08,308
I am coming with you, please.

827
01:07:08,398 --> 01:07:09,708
Leela, there is Police everywhere...

828
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,078
...even Baa's men are looking for us.
It's dangerous outside...

829
01:07:12,337 --> 01:07:14,546
- Please let me...
- I said NO!

830
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:16,748
...you sit here quietly.

831
01:07:28,488 --> 01:07:29,560
What will you eat?

832
01:07:31,492 --> 01:07:32,665
Should I get some snacks?

833
01:07:33,061 --> 01:07:34,541
You eat the snacks...

834
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:38,869
I will eat you.

835
01:08:06,533 --> 01:08:08,481
So Arjun, how is business doing?

836
01:08:08,569 --> 01:08:11,610
All good with God's grace...
hey take your change!

837
01:08:11,706 --> 01:08:13,585
He seems to be new in the city.

838
01:08:18,046 --> 01:08:19,550
How much for this
Sindoor (Vermillion)?

839
01:08:19,648 --> 01:08:22,598
Only 20 rupees. But it will bring you
good luck forever.

840
01:08:23,086 --> 01:08:24,897
In that case take 50 rupees.

841
01:08:25,722 --> 01:08:27,066
What are you doing out here?

842
01:08:27,156 --> 01:08:29,730
I told you Baa's men are looking
for us, why did you step outside?

843
01:08:29,893 --> 01:08:31,738
Look what I bought, Ram.

844
01:08:31,895 --> 01:08:36,474
Some clothes for us,
Sindoor and these rings.

845
01:08:37,936 --> 01:08:39,747
We'll have a simple wedding.

846
01:08:40,572 --> 01:08:41,574
Here...

847
01:08:42,407 --> 01:08:44,617
...wear this ring, our simple
wedding ceremony is done, happy?

848
01:08:44,744 --> 01:08:45,815
Let's go now.

849
01:08:46,579 --> 01:08:49,586
Listen! We will have
to get married properly.

850
01:08:50,516 --> 01:08:52,931
How can we stay in the same
room without getting married?

851
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:58,595
What are you doing, Ram?

852
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:05,943
What are you doing, Ram?

853
01:09:06,001 --> 01:09:07,607
You are worried about your wedding?

854
01:09:08,037 --> 01:09:10,144
Read today's headlines.

855
01:09:10,674 --> 01:09:11,779
Riots have started in Ranjaar,

856
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:13,220
Rajadi houses and shops
have been destroyed...

857
01:09:13,477 --> 01:09:14,890
...things are out of control.

858
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:16,823
But you have nothing
to worry about...

859
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:18,156
...it's only the Rajadis
who are suffering.

860
01:09:18,283 --> 01:09:21,632
I don't differentiate between
Rajadi or Sanera suffering.

861
01:09:21,687 --> 01:09:22,894
If I did,
I wouldn't have run away with you...

862
01:09:22,988 --> 01:09:24,526
...I have also left behind
my Baa. It's not easy for me.

863
01:09:24,623 --> 01:09:27,630
It's not easy for me either,
even I have abandoned my family,

864
01:09:27,727 --> 01:09:28,798
but you only care about yourself.

865
01:09:28,895 --> 01:09:31,139
Why are you talking
about these things...

866
01:09:31,564 --> 01:09:34,013
...when I am trying to forget
everything and keep you happy?

867
01:09:34,635 --> 01:09:35,478
In the whole of Ranjaar,

868
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:36,913
we were the only ones who fell in
love. Now we are the ones fighting.

869
01:09:37,004 --> 01:09:38,713
Because, ultimately there
is enmity in our blood, right?

870
01:09:38,806 --> 01:09:40,048
But you are the ones
who started this enmity.

871
01:09:40,141 --> 01:09:41,486
We didn't!

872
01:09:41,576 --> 01:09:44,150
At every opportunity, you bloody
Sahara's stole from our homes...

873
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:45,590
- ...our businesses, slaughtered us...
- Why will we steal from you?

874
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,184
- ...did not even spare children!
- You Rajadis are nothing before us!

875
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:48,592
- Your Baa is the most...
- Don't talk about children...

876
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,097
- ...notorious criminal in the state!
- ...your uncle kidnapped little babies!

877
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,929
- Murders, extortion, smuggling...
- And you? Thief, cheat...

878
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:52,831
...if so then why did
you come with me?

879
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:53,994
- Filthy Rajadi blood
flows in your veins...

880
01:09:54,057 --> 01:09:56,233
...else you wouldn't have
fired that gun! - Hey!

881
01:10:05,704 --> 01:10:06,843
It's a full moon night...

882
01:10:07,072 --> 01:10:08,610
...best time to get married...

883
01:10:10,676 --> 01:10:13,182
...let's just do it tonight.

884
01:10:28,231 --> 01:10:32,240
Bhavanibhai, the driver
has given this address only.

885
01:10:33,135 --> 01:10:40,289
I give you my word, I will find
Ram Leela before sunrise tomorrow.

886
01:10:41,712 --> 01:10:45,392
Their love story will be over
before 9 am tomorrow morning.

887
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:16,760
"Touch me with your soul."

888
01:11:19,957 --> 01:11:26,814
"Colour me with your passion."

889
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:36,219
"Touch me with your soul."

890
01:11:36,309 --> 01:11:39,623
"Colour me with your passion."

891
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:42,857
"Intoxicate me with..."

892
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:46,163
"...your burning fervour."

893
01:11:59,335 --> 01:12:05,885
"Intoxicate me...
Enlighten me with your love..."

894
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:12,099
"Intoxicate me with
your burning fervour."

895
01:12:12,317 --> 01:12:15,666
"My jewel and wealth is Ram,
I'm his forever."

896
01:12:15,721 --> 01:12:18,899
"He's settled in every
pores of my body."

897
01:12:19,158 --> 01:12:25,172
"My love is clean white,
colour it with seven colours."

898
01:12:25,365 --> 01:12:31,915
"Touch me with your soul.
Colour me with your passion."

899
01:12:32,207 --> 01:12:38,860
"Intoxicate me with your
burning fervour."

900
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:17,244
"The night seems barren
like a black dagger."

901
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:23,282
"The fire of desires that you
experience, I too experience it."

902
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:29,289
"Blow it and I'd burn down in it."

903
01:13:29,407 --> 01:13:33,120
Burn me with yourself.

904
01:13:33,245 --> 01:13:36,856
"Touch me with your soul."

905
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:44,009
"Intoxicate me with your
burning fervour."

906
01:14:24,505 --> 01:14:27,148
Receive your call, it's ringing.

907
01:14:31,178 --> 01:14:33,320
Receive your call, it's ringing.

908
01:14:33,814 --> 01:14:34,316
Hello...

909
01:14:34,382 --> 01:14:36,057
What, Ram... you left
without informing us?

910
01:14:36,151 --> 01:14:37,392
Finally we found you...

911
01:14:37,486 --> 01:14:39,161
We have reached your lodgings...

912
01:14:39,255 --> 01:14:41,237
...are you coming down
or should we come up?

913
01:14:46,329 --> 01:14:47,104
What... what are you doing here?

914
01:14:47,264 --> 01:14:48,573
Have you gone crazy?

915
01:14:48,899 --> 01:14:50,038
Leave right now!

916
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:51,671
Ram, we are all your friends...

917
01:14:51,902 --> 01:14:53,885
...a friend in need is a
friend indeed... Am I correct bhai?

918
01:14:54,005 --> 01:14:55,349
- Yes Ram...
- How did you find me?

919
01:14:55,406 --> 01:14:57,616
Bhai, we would have traced you
to the depths of hell...

920
01:14:58,844 --> 01:15:00,382
...it's all sorted with the police.

921
01:15:00,512 --> 01:15:01,959
Come back to Ranjaar
with us without a worry.

922
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,063
I did not leave to return...

923
01:15:04,384 --> 01:15:07,197
...you can keep your bloodshed,
your guns and bullets and be happy...

924
01:15:07,621 --> 01:15:09,101
We have nothing to
do with Ranjaar any more.

925
01:15:09,189 --> 01:15:10,602
That is quite apparent...

926
01:15:10,891 --> 01:15:14,206
...Meghjibhai's remains have barely
been put to rest and he is...

927
01:15:14,395 --> 01:15:15,535
...already in bed with that wretch.

928
01:15:17,966 --> 01:15:21,382
Her name is Leela and she
is your bhabhi (sister-in-law), OK!

929
01:15:21,704 --> 01:15:23,447
I have married her...

930
01:15:23,706 --> 01:15:25,882
If you ever utter her name
with your filthy mouth...

931
01:15:25,976 --> 01:15:27,149
...I will cut your tongue out!

932
01:15:27,243 --> 01:15:28,952
Ram, leave him. - Leave.

933
01:15:29,646 --> 01:15:30,991
Let's all be sensible here...

934
01:15:31,115 --> 01:15:32,117
He is married now...

935
01:15:32,482 --> 01:15:34,225
...instead of congratulating him
you are fighting with him.

936
01:15:34,318 --> 01:15:36,301
What congratulations?
He married a Sanera.

937
01:15:36,387 --> 01:15:37,959
She is a Rajadi now...

938
01:15:38,056 --> 01:15:39,594
...and also our sister-in-law.

939
01:15:40,392 --> 01:15:41,565
Apologize.

940
01:15:41,727 --> 01:15:43,140
Congratulate and hug him...
come on!

941
01:15:43,262 --> 01:15:45,505
Come on now... Do it!

942
01:15:46,265 --> 01:15:47,244
Sorry, Rambhai.

943
01:15:47,967 --> 01:15:50,918
That is much better. Come,
let's sit and talk for 5 minutes.

944
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:52,076
Forget it... I am not coming.

945
01:15:52,139 --> 01:15:53,278
Come on,
just have a beer with friends...

946
01:15:53,441 --> 01:15:54,580
No I can't...

947
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:55,313
Hey come on,
we have travelled so far.

948
01:15:55,409 --> 01:15:57,413
Can't you spare 5
minutes for your friends?

949
01:15:57,478 --> 01:15:58,423
Please... Let's go!

950
01:15:58,479 --> 01:15:59,356
I'll inform Leela and come...

951
01:15:59,515 --> 01:16:03,160
Don't worry about her...
it's just one beer!

952
01:16:14,665 --> 01:16:17,114
Come on Ram, let's go!

953
01:16:18,603 --> 01:16:25,961
You married first and also celebrated
your honeymoon? Three cheers for Ram!

954
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:30,465
...and another one for Leela bhabhi!
Say cheers!

955
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:32,463
Come on Ram,
let's have one more drink...

956
01:16:32,552 --> 01:16:35,229
No way, guys...
Leela is waiting... l am going.

957
01:16:35,322 --> 01:16:39,035
Sure you can go to Leela bhabhi,
but first tell us something...

958
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:42,576
You left Ranjaar...
you forgot all your friends...

959
01:16:42,665 --> 01:16:45,342
...you even forgot all
the other girls of Ranjaar!

960
01:16:46,502 --> 01:16:49,145
What is so special
about Leela bhabhi?

961
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:54,318
Your bhabhi is one of a kind...

962
01:16:54,812 --> 01:16:56,224
...special edition.

963
01:16:58,082 --> 01:17:00,691
The first time we met,
instead of coloring me...

964
01:17:00,819 --> 01:17:02,231
...she kissed me.

965
01:17:02,654 --> 01:17:05,365
Instead of giving me her heart...
she gave me her life.

966
01:17:07,026 --> 01:17:09,008
There is no one like Leela.

967
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:11,401
See...

968
01:17:11,498 --> 01:17:13,104
...we are talking about her
and she calls.

969
01:17:13,533 --> 01:17:15,516
Special connection!

970
01:17:17,071 --> 01:17:20,419
Hello... Leela baby I love you...

971
01:17:21,609 --> 01:17:24,856
I am coming soon baby...
I will be there in 5 minutes.

972
01:17:25,547 --> 01:17:27,791
When will you talk to us
if you keep talking on the phone?

973
01:17:28,183 --> 01:17:29,186
Forget the phone...

974
01:17:29,285 --> 01:17:31,597
So what were you telling
us about Leela bhabhi?

975
01:17:31,687 --> 01:17:32,793
Continue...

976
01:17:33,122 --> 01:17:35,298
Ranjaar should have
a statue of Leela!

977
01:17:35,392 --> 01:17:37,067
Very good idea!

978
01:17:37,261 --> 01:17:44,414
She is the only Sanera
who has dared to love a Rajadi.

979
01:17:44,569 --> 01:17:45,446
Very true!

980
01:17:46,071 --> 01:17:47,279
I told you...

981
01:17:48,474 --> 01:17:52,392
...there's no one like Leela!

982
01:17:53,313 --> 01:17:57,630
Her brother's blood is on my hands...

983
01:18:00,754 --> 01:18:02,896
...yet she married me.

984
01:18:07,263 --> 01:18:11,910
Because there is no one like Leela...

985
01:18:17,608 --> 01:18:21,355
Well done!

986
01:18:23,648 --> 01:18:29,366
Well done God!

987
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:35,629
You made millions...
but there is no one like Leela...

988
01:18:46,308 --> 01:18:48,221
There is...

989
01:18:56,653 --> 01:19:02,474
There is... no one like Leela!

990
01:19:29,992 --> 01:19:31,529
I don't want to go!

991
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,505
It's Buahuzoor's will...

992
01:19:38,401 --> 01:19:39,575
Ram!

993
01:19:44,876 --> 01:19:45,878
Ram!

994
01:19:54,386 --> 01:19:55,559
Ram!

995
01:20:04,532 --> 01:20:05,375
Move!

996
01:20:06,567 --> 01:20:07,546
Move!

997
01:20:07,735 --> 01:20:08,407
Move!

998
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:10,282
Get out of the way!

999
01:20:23,587 --> 01:20:24,794
Get up!

1000
01:20:37,503 --> 01:20:39,576
Ram!

1001
01:20:48,082 --> 01:20:50,429
Ram!

1002
01:20:57,493 --> 01:21:00,876
Ram!

1003
01:21:06,303 --> 01:21:08,843
Ram!

1004
01:21:10,275 --> 01:21:12,382
Leela!

1005
01:21:12,543 --> 01:21:14,286
What a revenge! Hats off Ram!

1006
01:21:14,379 --> 01:21:15,950
What the hell have
you done you bastards?

1007
01:21:16,048 --> 01:21:19,123
What have we done? The message
was sent to Vanka from your phone.

1008
01:21:19,351 --> 01:21:21,300
I had trusted you all!

1009
01:21:21,388 --> 01:21:25,033
Even we trusted you, Ram! You left
the Rajadis to pay for your sins.

1010
01:21:25,959 --> 01:21:28,499
Leela!

1011
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:42,348
Leela!

1012
01:21:42,578 --> 01:21:44,321
Leela!

1013
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:00,775
Don't let him go!

1014
01:22:21,858 --> 01:22:23,703
Ram!

1015
01:22:46,219 --> 01:22:49,169
Leela!

1016
01:23:21,493 --> 01:23:22,940
Yes Radhubhai.

1017
01:23:23,162 --> 01:23:24,666
We are on our way back.

1018
01:23:25,097 --> 01:23:26,544
We had just stopped at a temple.

1019
01:23:26,966 --> 01:23:28,538
We have created history...

1020
01:23:28,935 --> 01:23:30,313
...by humiliating
the girl in such a way...

1021
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:32,181
...that those Saneras will
never be able to face anyone.

1022
01:23:32,506 --> 01:23:34,647
I had sent a message
to Vanka from Ram's phone.

1023
01:23:34,941 --> 01:23:37,983
Now Leela will believe
that Ram has betrayed her.

1024
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:43,960
Ram!

1025
01:23:44,654 --> 01:23:45,998
What are you doing?

1026
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:48,469
This is misbehaviour. This is wrong.

1027
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:51,971
You will teach me
what is right and wrong?

1028
01:23:52,462 --> 01:23:55,071
You scoundrels have changed the
whole definition of right and wrong.

1029
01:23:55,132 --> 01:23:57,479
Enough of your nonsense,
we are your friends.

1030
01:23:57,535 --> 01:23:59,210
Changed...

1031
01:24:00,472 --> 01:24:03,354
Everything has changed overnight.

1032
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:07,226
The ocean of love... has
changed into a desert of hatred...

1033
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:10,086
I hated enmity... it changed...

1034
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:12,997
I fell in love madly
for the first time...

1035
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,731
...left the whole world
for my love... it all changed.

1036
01:24:20,228 --> 01:24:21,264
Hey Ram, Ram!

1037
01:24:21,329 --> 01:24:23,505
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

1038
01:24:24,499 --> 01:24:28,007
I am checking if the
color of my blood has changed.

1039
01:24:28,538 --> 01:24:31,043
Is it still red...
or has it lost its color?

1040
01:24:31,241 --> 01:24:33,348
Enough Ram! Let's go home now.

1041
01:24:34,344 --> 01:24:41,464
"I've had such an enmity with you."

1042
01:24:43,021 --> 01:24:49,537
"That I haven't remained
like myself any more."

1043
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:57,313
"That I haven't remained
like myself any more."

1044
01:24:57,704 --> 01:25:00,244
"This red love,
this remorse of love."

1045
01:25:00,307 --> 01:25:03,451
Leela, please eat something...

1046
01:25:04,146 --> 01:25:06,459
...you haven't eaten
at all in 3 days.

1047
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:11,728
Enough is enough Leela.
What have you done to yourself?

1048
01:25:13,222 --> 01:25:15,296
You are calling him again, right?

1049
01:25:15,625 --> 01:25:17,607
You have been calling and
messaging him since 2 days...

1050
01:25:17,661 --> 01:25:19,073
...without any response, right?

1051
01:25:19,096 --> 01:25:20,509
There won't be one either.

1052
01:25:20,731 --> 01:25:22,474
Forget the past...

1053
01:25:22,733 --> 01:25:25,273
Baa has any ways called
Karsan's parents from London.

1054
01:25:25,336 --> 01:25:28,412
Grapes are green,
Bananas appear gold...

1055
01:25:28,607 --> 01:25:31,420
...Leela belongs to Ram
the whole world has been told.

1056
01:25:32,144 --> 01:25:33,648
What did you just say?

1057
01:25:34,481 --> 01:25:37,090
Knife falls on an apple
or an apple falls on a knife...

1058
01:25:37,317 --> 01:25:40,268
...please answer the phone,
the one calling is your wife.

1059
01:25:41,089 --> 01:25:42,660
What wife?

1060
01:25:43,457 --> 01:25:45,804
The person whose messages
you are enjoying...

1061
01:25:46,093 --> 01:25:48,098
...is the one who informed Vanka.

1062
01:25:49,097 --> 01:25:52,480
The boy has taken his revenge
Leela, by humiliating Baa and you...

1063
01:25:52,701 --> 01:25:54,775
...now we've become a laughing
stock in the whole of Ranjaar,

1064
01:25:55,205 --> 01:25:58,383
It was my mistake...
that I entrusted you to him.

1065
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:03,663
I entrust Ram with my life.

1066
01:26:03,715 --> 01:26:08,294
The man you place so much faith in,
does not deserve it.

1067
01:26:08,553 --> 01:26:11,401
He proved he is a
Rajadi after all Leela...

1068
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:13,804
what the hell are you doing?

1069
01:26:14,126 --> 01:26:17,634
Naughty granny, handsome grandfather
I have to go to Ram's house...

1070
01:26:17,664 --> 01:26:19,304
...how long will
I stay with my mother.

1071
01:26:19,333 --> 01:26:21,246
What madness is this...

1072
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:24,309
...and why have you put sindoor
(vermillion) like a married woman?

1073
01:26:24,372 --> 01:26:26,354
The peacock is incomplete
without his mate...

1074
01:26:26,574 --> 01:26:28,317
...this sindoor in
Ram's name is my fate.

1075
01:26:28,477 --> 01:26:31,222
Leela, If Baa sees this,
there will be a furor. Wipe it off!

1076
01:26:32,381 --> 01:26:33,554
Leela...

1077
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:39,397
...get this straight,
fire and water cannot co-exist.

1078
01:26:40,658 --> 01:26:44,542
The chant of Ram's
name sets even water afire.

1079
01:27:02,516 --> 01:27:04,293
Since the time she was 3,

1080
01:27:04,418 --> 01:27:06,263
my silly daughter wanted...

1081
01:27:06,353 --> 01:27:10,306
...to get married just for the
beautiful clothes and ornaments.

1082
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:13,574
I have been getting jewelery made
for Leela's wedding since then.

1083
01:27:13,796 --> 01:27:14,901
Yes, Hujoor.

1084
01:27:15,197 --> 01:27:16,370
Very nice.

1085
01:27:16,866 --> 01:27:20,477
Baa,
Leela has refused to eat yet again.

1086
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:23,251
Keep it there, I will eat it.

1087
01:27:23,707 --> 01:27:25,711
She has not eaten
a morsel since 3 days...

1088
01:27:25,743 --> 01:27:27,554
...and all you are concerned
about are the ornaments?

1089
01:27:27,778 --> 01:27:32,232
Rasila, gold looks beautiful
on my Leela, right?

1090
01:27:32,284 --> 01:27:33,889
Nothing looks good
on her any more Baa,

1091
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,629
she has turned her
back on the world for him.

1092
01:27:35,888 --> 01:27:38,565
But you will not understand
their relationship.

1093
01:27:38,758 --> 01:27:40,433
If I didn't understand their love,

1094
01:27:40,593 --> 01:27:44,740
I would have punished
that Rajadi with death...

1095
01:27:44,798 --> 01:27:46,780
What could be a
better punishment...

1096
01:27:47,234 --> 01:27:50,241
...you took away their breath
and asked them to live.

1097
01:27:53,909 --> 01:27:57,656
This will look nice on me
for the wedding day, right?

1098
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:02,263
Yes, yes, Hujoor.

1099
01:28:20,339 --> 01:28:21,945
Ram, that's my boy!

1100
01:28:22,274 --> 01:28:23,949
How well you have avenged us.

1101
01:28:24,278 --> 01:28:26,521
You have cut Dhankor's limbs,

1102
01:28:26,714 --> 01:28:32,363
you have killed her only heir and
have put her family name to shame!

1103
01:28:32,453 --> 01:28:35,336
Bhai... bhai... bhai

1104
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:38,868
From today, Ram takes my place.

1105
01:28:43,799 --> 01:28:50,053
Rambhai... Rambhai...
Rambhai!

1106
01:28:50,308 --> 01:28:52,552
Rambhai! Rambhai!

1107
01:28:57,349 --> 01:29:00,060
With a gun in hand
and hatred in my heart.

1108
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,497
...I rule the world, true that...

1109
01:29:05,492 --> 01:29:07,667
You all had once raised
guns at me in this court,

1110
01:29:07,694 --> 01:29:12,513
now in this very court
put a huge picture of me...

1111
01:29:12,667 --> 01:29:17,519
...as the new Rajadi don Rambhai!

1112
01:29:17,539 --> 01:29:19,851
Rambhai!

1113
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:23,554
Henceforth let's ensure, that
every Holi is coloured in blood!

1114
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,757
Houses burn instead
of lamps on Diwali...

1115
01:29:27,017 --> 01:29:34,911
Now, we live and
we die for... Saneras!

1116
01:29:51,778 --> 01:29:53,453
Kesar bhabhi...

1117
01:29:54,716 --> 01:29:55,991
I look good, right?

1118
01:29:57,586 --> 01:29:58,895
You too...

1119
01:30:03,993 --> 01:30:05,474
Sorry, Kesar bhabhi.

1120
01:30:06,429 --> 01:30:09,744
I won't touch your feet, won't
embrace you, won't wipe your tears.

1121
01:30:09,899 --> 01:30:11,403
I am a Don...

1122
01:30:13,503 --> 01:30:16,420
...and Dons' don't mourn,
they only celebrate.

1123
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:21,747
Celebrate what?
Meghji's death or yours?

1124
01:30:22,415 --> 01:30:24,090
What's the difference,
Kesar bhabhi?

1125
01:30:25,417 --> 01:30:29,028
One body was carried out,
one was carried in.

1126
01:30:29,423 --> 01:30:31,029
You gave up so easily?

1127
01:30:31,658 --> 01:30:34,005
People take on the world
for the ones they love.

1128
01:30:34,094 --> 01:30:37,842
Bhabhi, who do I fight with?
My own family is my enemy.

1129
01:30:40,702 --> 01:30:41,977
Any ways, let me know
if you have any problem,

1130
01:30:42,037 --> 01:30:43,780
I will solve it. I am the Don...

1131
01:30:46,175 --> 01:30:47,679
...are you worried about Goli?

1132
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:51,524
I will never let this happen to him.
I will change his legacy, I swear.

1133
01:30:52,783 --> 01:30:54,127
Anything else... no?

1134
01:30:54,618 --> 01:30:56,031
So leave now.

1135
01:31:08,634 --> 01:31:13,521
We're happy to announce
that we've a guest here.

1136
01:31:13,807 --> 01:31:16,552
Rambhai has become
the new Rajadi Don.

1137
01:31:16,677 --> 01:31:20,754
We have arranged a special
program in his honor.

1138
01:31:20,982 --> 01:31:26,027
And we know exactly
what Rambhai wants.

1139
01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:29,028
"Whether Ram wants Leela."

1140
01:31:29,091 --> 01:31:30,196
"Or Leela loves Ram"

1141
01:31:30,494 --> 01:31:34,571
"What's the world to do with
the love of these two?"

1142
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:39,239
"Whether Ram wants Leela."

1143
01:31:39,504 --> 01:31:40,677
"Or Leela loves Ram"

1144
01:31:40,738 --> 01:31:44,520
"What's the world to do with
the love of these two?"

1145
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:47,560
Their funda is pretty simple, dear,
If you shoot..

1146
01:31:47,613 --> 01:31:51,064
...It's a fight,
and if you wink, it's love..

1147
01:31:51,251 --> 01:31:53,028
"Whether Ram wants Leela."

1148
01:31:53,053 --> 01:31:54,260
"Or Leela loves Ram"

1149
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:58,200
"What's the world to do with the
love of these two?"

1150
01:32:01,095 --> 01:32:07,109
"Keep the gun in your pocket
and keep the trigger in control."

1151
01:32:08,036 --> 01:32:11,887
"Keep the gun in your pocket
and keep the trigger in control."

1152
01:32:11,942 --> 01:32:15,545
"Whether Ram wants Leela
or Leela loves Ram."

1153
01:32:15,546 --> 01:32:17,084
"Whether Ram wants Leela."

1154
01:32:17,147 --> 01:32:18,548
"Or Leela loves Ram"

1155
01:32:18,549 --> 01:32:22,091
"What's the world to do with
the love of these two?"

1156
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:25,728
"The clouds rain with roars.
They crave to see Leela's adorning."

1157
01:32:25,757 --> 01:32:29,071
"Bangles, nose-ring, and waist-band.
Make the queen as beautiful as moon."

1158
01:32:29,128 --> 01:32:31,907
"Ram-Leela are lovebirds."

1159
01:32:31,964 --> 01:32:35,780
"And the Ram-Leela is all passionate."

1160
01:32:35,835 --> 01:32:41,086
"Everyone looks like an enemy
and I see a thief in all."

1161
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:46,027
"Everyone looks like an enemy
and I see a thief in all."

1162
01:32:46,081 --> 01:32:49,259
"There is a peacock sitting
on my balcony."

1163
01:32:49,285 --> 01:32:53,705
"It's a fault of both that
Ram-Leela is infamous."

1164
01:32:55,092 --> 01:32:59,978
"O my Ram, 0 my Ram."

1165
01:33:00,198 --> 01:33:03,273
"O, Leela!"

1166
01:33:03,334 --> 01:33:05,111
"Whether Ram wants Leela."

1167
01:33:05,169 --> 01:33:06,604
"Or Leela loves Ram"

1168
01:33:06,605 --> 01:33:10,113
"What's the world to do
with the love of these two?"

1169
01:33:23,891 --> 01:33:29,644
"There is only one bullet
and only one life."

1170
01:33:30,799 --> 01:33:33,977
"There is only one bullet
and only one life."

1171
01:33:34,003 --> 01:33:37,318
"And on every bullet, it's
written who'd die from it."

1172
01:33:37,341 --> 01:33:41,157
"But they deceive even
the bullet, that's how they work."

1173
01:33:41,211 --> 01:33:44,321
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."

1174
01:33:44,382 --> 01:33:47,856
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."

1175
01:33:47,919 --> 01:33:49,832
"Whether Ram wants Leela."

1176
01:33:49,888 --> 01:33:51,027
"Or Leela loves Ram"

1177
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:54,837
"What's the world to do with
the love of these two?"

1178
01:33:55,327 --> 01:33:59,839
Wow! That's true.

1179
01:34:22,693 --> 01:34:27,705
Hail Lord Rama!

1180
01:34:27,932 --> 01:34:32,751
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."

1181
01:34:32,804 --> 01:34:36,119
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."

1182
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:39,455
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."

1183
01:34:39,713 --> 01:34:42,994
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."

1184
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:46,399
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."

1185
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:49,894
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."

1186
01:34:49,958 --> 01:34:53,239
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."

1187
01:34:53,295 --> 01:34:57,179
"Ram-Leela" Ram-Leela... Ram-Leela."

1188
01:34:57,433 --> 01:35:02,822
C'mon, everyone clap..

1189
01:35:07,946 --> 01:35:12,092
Leela, meet Nattubhai
and Gamaben...

1190
01:35:12,917 --> 01:35:14,455
Ram's parents.

1191
01:35:15,087 --> 01:35:16,932
And this is my daughter, Leela.

1192
01:35:17,757 --> 01:35:19,864
You must've heard a lot about her.

1193
01:35:21,127 --> 01:35:23,440
They are a wonderful family...

1194
01:35:24,164 --> 01:35:28,049
...Karsanbhai the Archaeologer
and father the Astrologer.

1195
01:35:30,137 --> 01:35:32,484
Read my palm... tell me how
many times will I get married?

1196
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:37,784
Nattubhai,
how come you didn't laugh...

1197
01:35:38,214 --> 01:35:40,127
Leela just cracked a joke...

1198
01:35:40,784 --> 01:35:42,823
Our Leela is very sharp.

1199
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:46,332
That's why I had told Karsanbhai...
learn how to hold a gun...

1200
01:35:46,791 --> 01:35:48,362
...to keep his wife in control.

1201
01:35:48,792 --> 01:35:50,296
Yes... Baa.

1202
01:35:50,961 --> 01:35:52,237
Enough of the juice!

1203
01:35:52,296 --> 01:35:54,335
Bhavani, give the rings.

1204
01:35:55,367 --> 01:35:57,815
Let's get them engaged right away.

1205
01:35:58,137 --> 01:35:59,173
All right...

1206
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:01,817
...in that case the honeymoon
will be at a location of my choice.

1207
01:36:03,243 --> 01:36:05,191
At Madhuchanda Lodge, Jagatrana.

1208
01:36:05,378 --> 01:36:08,157
We will get a discount as well,
I have just been there.

1209
01:36:11,485 --> 01:36:13,364
Oh! How come you stood up,
son-in-law?

1210
01:36:14,323 --> 01:36:16,828
See everything else is fine,
Nattubhai...

1211
01:36:16,858 --> 01:36:19,900
...but he is not
as tall as our Leela.

1212
01:36:21,163 --> 01:36:24,843
We will have to add
heels to his wedding shoes.

1213
01:36:25,401 --> 01:36:28,044
Baa, why this urgency
for the wedding?

1214
01:36:28,872 --> 01:36:30,012
Even the mourning period for
Kanjibhai is not yet over...

1215
01:36:30,074 --> 01:36:32,352
I am fulfilling
Kanji's wish itself.

1216
01:36:34,412 --> 01:36:37,055
Karsanbhai, put the ring on!

1217
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:39,863
This ring will not come off.

1218
01:36:40,118 --> 01:36:43,126
Bhavani give the diamond.

1219
01:36:45,257 --> 01:36:46,567
"This ring will stay
on my finger forever"

1220
01:36:46,859 --> 01:36:48,067
...and so will the
Rajadi in my heart.

1221
01:36:50,931 --> 01:36:54,382
I can snatch away a Lion's kill,

1222
01:36:56,204 --> 01:36:58,152
what is this ring on your finger?

1223
01:36:59,441 --> 01:37:00,888
Go ahead, try.

1224
01:37:05,281 --> 01:37:07,229
You are my pride,

1225
01:37:08,584 --> 01:37:10,327
my prestige,

1226
01:37:13,057 --> 01:37:14,560
if it was someone else..

1227
01:37:14,591 --> 01:37:16,300
Baa please!

1228
01:37:17,462 --> 01:37:19,068
I would have chopped
their head off.

1229
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:55,976
This is my ace against your queen.

1230
01:37:56,039 --> 01:37:57,179
Forget about my queen,

1231
01:37:57,275 --> 01:38:01,227
Rambhai humiliated Dhankor so badly
that she cut her own daughter's finger.

1232
01:38:01,279 --> 01:38:02,351
What?

1233
01:38:02,447 --> 01:38:03,483
Is it true?

1234
01:38:03,549 --> 01:38:06,328
Wow! Leela Bhabhi
lived through the pain!

1235
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:08,966
The game has changed. -How?

1236
01:38:09,021 --> 01:38:11,300
Ram has a full house
and Leela Bhabhi has lost one.

1237
01:38:11,357 --> 01:38:13,339
That's right. - Yes.

1238
01:38:13,394 --> 01:38:17,973
Here is my 100 bucks in the name
of Leela bhabhi's ring ceremony!

1239
01:38:19,967 --> 01:38:27,190
My heart crossed swords with yours,
In a feud as flawed as love.

1240
01:38:28,511 --> 01:38:36,337
A love that changed my very name...

1241
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:41,702
My name is love,

1242
01:38:43,161 --> 01:38:46,271
Your name is love,

1243
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,710
My name is love,

1244
01:38:50,003 --> 01:38:52,110
Your name is love,

1245
01:38:52,171 --> 01:38:54,279
My name is love,

1246
01:38:54,341 --> 01:38:56,448
Your name is love,

1247
01:38:56,611 --> 01:39:01,429
My name is love,

1248
01:39:01,515 --> 01:39:03,360
My love is red.

1249
01:39:03,419 --> 01:39:10,436
The red of remorse,
Of rivalry and regret.

1250
01:39:10,527 --> 01:39:14,604
"This red love, this remorse of love."

1251
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:19,482
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."

1252
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:23,718
"This red love, this remorse of love."

1253
01:39:23,775 --> 01:39:28,560
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."

1254
01:39:28,614 --> 01:39:33,051
"This red love, this remorse of love."

1255
01:39:33,052 --> 01:39:34,499
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."

1256
01:39:34,555 --> 01:39:39,168
Rasila, take these clothes
and ornaments, they are for Leela.

1257
01:39:39,327 --> 01:39:41,674
Get her dressed
and bring her down.- Yes, Baa.

1258
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:43,574
- So well everything is going...
- Dhankor Baa...

1259
01:39:43,598 --> 01:39:45,273
We are thinking of delaying...

1260
01:39:45,333 --> 01:39:47,748
...the wedding by a few days,
let's all lake it a little slow...

1261
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:53,591
Oh Nattubhai, what slow, the
groom is already coloured yellow.

1262
01:39:59,684 --> 01:40:03,261
All the other women have completed the
ritual, now it's your turn Buahujoor.

1263
01:40:04,355 --> 01:40:09,106
From London comes the groom's
family, riding haughty and high,

1264
01:40:09,195 --> 01:40:13,671
We won't let them go,
stay here or die!

1265
01:40:18,705 --> 01:40:21,484
Dhankor Baa, please let us go...

1266
01:40:21,708 --> 01:40:25,285
...you can't build this
relationship at gun point.

1267
01:40:25,447 --> 01:40:28,226
At least return
Karsan's passport Baa.

1268
01:40:28,516 --> 01:40:32,298
This is plain torture.

1269
01:40:32,455 --> 01:40:36,305
Plane... oh yeah, we shall book
your plane tickets tomorrow.

1270
01:40:40,130 --> 01:40:42,510
Enough! Dhankor Baa. Enough.

1271
01:40:43,467 --> 01:40:48,685
Wow! You are holding a gun,
the boy is ready for the wedding.

1272
01:40:49,708 --> 01:40:54,492
Our bespectacled groom,
we thought was a little shy,

1273
01:40:54,748 --> 01:40:58,894
but look he's holding
a gun... oh my my!

1274
01:41:03,657 --> 01:41:05,400
Hey Leela, see what I've brought.

1275
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:08,170
Baa got such beautiful ornaments
and clothes made for you.

1276
01:41:08,362 --> 01:41:11,609
Your wedding is set for this
Thursday and so much to be done!

1277
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:14,510
Get ready soon and come down,
guests have started arriving...

1278
01:41:14,837 --> 01:41:18,220
Marriage is so amazing,
Rasila bhabhi.

1279
01:41:18,508 --> 01:41:20,251
You should also get married again.

1280
01:41:21,878 --> 01:41:23,223
Have you lost your mind?

1281
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,182
If you can't get married again,
then how can I?

1282
01:41:25,183 --> 01:41:26,595
My husband is still alive.

1283
01:41:28,386 --> 01:41:30,197
Baa can get me married
to anyone she wants...

1284
01:41:30,222 --> 01:41:32,226
but I will consummate
my marriage only with Ram.

1285
01:41:32,590 --> 01:41:33,627
Shameless!

1286
01:41:33,693 --> 01:41:36,199
Shameless, incorrigible, selfish...

1287
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:39,370
...but that is how love is.

1288
01:41:40,901 --> 01:41:43,544
Now don't look so shocked,
go and tell him,

1289
01:41:43,604 --> 01:41:45,244
I will wait for him
near the dry well tonight.

1290
01:41:45,306 --> 01:41:46,787
You want me to go
to Ram's area?

1291
01:41:46,874 --> 01:41:49,323
And ask my husband's
murderer to sleep with you?

1292
01:41:49,377 --> 01:41:51,325
You do care for me, right?

1293
01:41:51,446 --> 01:41:53,656
He is now the Don of the Rajadis...

1294
01:41:53,883 --> 01:41:56,833
...revenge, hatred, guns and bullets.
That's what he lives for now.

1295
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:59,567
Neither will he answer your calls,
nor will he meet me,

1296
01:41:59,889 --> 01:42:02,429
you very well know what
answer I will come back with.

1297
01:42:02,625 --> 01:42:03,627
This relationship is over now.

1298
01:42:03,726 --> 01:42:07,269
My first night will be with
Ram or this will be my last night.

1299
01:42:14,406 --> 01:42:19,623
Few songs were demanded
from me to sing.

1300
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:21,592
I'll sing a couple of lines.

1301
01:42:21,648 --> 01:42:25,259
From the movie, 'I've seen the
country as well as the foreign land.'

1302
01:42:30,758 --> 01:42:32,637
Where is Rambhai's shop?

1303
01:42:32,694 --> 01:42:34,004
This... is the one.

1304
01:42:34,429 --> 01:42:36,537
- Is he inside?
- Should be...

1305
01:42:56,522 --> 01:42:59,905
Oh Rasila bhabhi? What
are you doing in our Video store?

1306
01:43:00,860 --> 01:43:02,637
Welcome, please come in...

1307
01:43:03,996 --> 01:43:07,470
I am shocked to see you here...

1308
01:43:08,802 --> 01:43:10,806
Are you also interested
in "action" films?

1309
01:43:11,038 --> 01:43:12,485
We are watching one right now,

1310
01:43:12,506 --> 01:43:14,853
come join us, please
sit... enjoy yourself...

1311
01:43:15,343 --> 01:43:16,756
I need to meet Ram.

1312
01:43:17,379 --> 01:43:20,329
Not Ram, call him Rambhai.

1313
01:43:22,652 --> 01:43:23,997
I need to meet Rambhai.

1314
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:27,004
Say "please"...l
need to meet Rambhai.

1315
01:43:28,058 --> 01:43:30,439
Please, I need to meet Rambhai.

1316
01:43:32,764 --> 01:43:34,335
You had your fun?

1317
01:43:34,432 --> 01:43:36,914
Now call Ram... I have
an important message for him.

1318
01:43:37,002 --> 01:43:38,711
But Rambhai is not here.

1319
01:43:38,838 --> 01:43:41,013
I know he is inside, I will
go and look for him myself...

1320
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,023
Rambhai is the new
Don of the Rajadis.

1321
01:43:43,043 --> 01:43:44,854
Did you take an appointment
to see him, Rasilaji?

1322
01:43:45,345 --> 01:43:47,350
No? So you can't meet him.

1323
01:43:47,414 --> 01:43:49,726
Listen, I have to deliver
an important message to him.

1324
01:43:49,849 --> 01:43:51,353
It is for his own good.

1325
01:43:51,418 --> 01:43:52,524
Isn't it wonderful...

1326
01:43:52,587 --> 01:43:54,591
First Dhankor did
"good" to Rajadis...

1327
01:43:54,722 --> 01:43:56,898
...and now Rasilaji
has come as our saviour.

1328
01:43:56,958 --> 01:43:59,805
Give us a chance,
we can also do some "good",..

1329
01:43:59,862 --> 01:44:01,775
...since Saneras have no men left.

1330
01:44:03,532 --> 01:44:04,979
Bastard...

1331
01:44:08,405 --> 01:44:09,476
Go away!

1332
01:44:09,539 --> 01:44:11,544
Rambhai is not here...

1333
01:44:11,975 --> 01:44:14,481
...whatever you want to say,
say it in my ears.

1334
01:44:14,612 --> 01:44:16,389
You disgusting animal!

1335
01:44:17,048 --> 01:44:20,124
Leave me!

1336
01:44:20,386 --> 01:44:25,637
Sanera women, sharp and cheeky.
Oh Look...

1337
01:44:28,762 --> 01:44:30,071
...your blouse is all wet.

1338
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:32,079
Let me help you dry it.

1339
01:44:32,098 --> 01:44:35,744
Leave me.

1340
01:44:36,804 --> 01:44:38,752
Take it.. - Leave.. leave me.

1341
01:44:45,948 --> 01:44:48,831
Hey, leave her.

1342
01:44:49,019 --> 01:44:52,630
Leave her alone.
Stop, have you all lost it?

1343
01:44:52,990 --> 01:44:54,938
You want revenge
from a helpless woman?

1344
01:44:55,159 --> 01:44:58,770
If Rambhai hears of this,
he will kill every one of you.

1345
01:44:59,831 --> 01:45:01,779
My husband was right...

1346
01:45:02,134 --> 01:45:04,777
There are no men in the Rajadis.

1347
01:45:05,437 --> 01:45:07,681
- Want to see my manhood?
- Hey!

1348
01:45:09,141 --> 01:45:12,183
If you even try to touch me
this time... I will rip you apart.

1349
01:45:13,614 --> 01:45:15,618
Now, go and tell your Rambhai...

1350
01:45:15,683 --> 01:45:19,066
Leela will never be his.
This is my promise.

1351
01:45:48,554 --> 01:45:50,536
Rasila bhabhi, what did Ram say?

1352
01:45:51,991 --> 01:45:53,495
Tell me...

1353
01:45:54,027 --> 01:45:55,667
...what happened bhabhi?

1354
01:45:56,596 --> 01:45:58,772
Please, what was his answer?

1355
01:46:06,508 --> 01:46:08,615
This is what those Rajadis did.

1356
01:47:53,332 --> 01:47:54,334
Hey look there...

1357
01:47:54,634 --> 01:47:55,670
"stop!"

1358
01:48:35,948 --> 01:48:39,263
Run away!

1359
01:48:41,888 --> 01:48:44,097
Ah... here is her shawl...
the wretch must be around!

1360
01:48:47,696 --> 01:48:52,309
You bloody Kesar I won't spare you!

1361
01:49:08,419 --> 01:49:10,059
Let's go!

1362
01:49:21,801 --> 01:49:25,252
Now its war in Ranjaar!

1363
01:49:25,472 --> 01:49:29,755
We will teach them a lesson
for trying to touch our women.

1364
01:49:32,313 --> 01:49:35,764
Veer, Mandar,
Velji, Pranjeevan, come here.

1365
01:49:36,986 --> 01:49:41,303
Our revenge will start right here,
right now!

1366
01:49:41,357 --> 01:49:43,430
Yes, brother!

1367
01:49:43,459 --> 01:49:46,876
The first bullet,
will be fired on them.

1368
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:53,276
"If we can't punish these bastards"

1369
01:49:53,338 --> 01:49:58,190
"these rapists, then
throw away your guns!"

1370
01:49:58,277 --> 01:50:00,123
You avenged your brother's
death right away...

1371
01:50:00,146 --> 01:50:03,791
...today when it's about our women,
you are giving us a lecture?

1372
01:50:04,117 --> 01:50:05,826
What revenge are you
talking about Rambhai?

1373
01:50:05,953 --> 01:50:09,200
You want us to abandon our guns?
so here!

1374
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:13,241
I asked you to abandon your guns...
not your manhood.

1375
01:50:13,495 --> 01:50:16,377
Will the Saneras stop
even if we abandon our weapons?

1376
01:50:16,532 --> 01:50:19,539
I can see,
the end is near for the Rajadis.

1377
01:50:20,369 --> 01:50:23,080
How could Radhubhai
crown you as our Don?

1378
01:51:08,425 --> 01:51:10,134
Hey, stop!

1379
01:52:46,973 --> 01:52:50,983
You BastardmBuahujoor...
kill him right now...

1380
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:04,497
This tone has to change.
Our guns are done talking...

1381
01:53:04,526 --> 01:53:07,169
...now the time has
come for us to talk.

1382
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:15,551
Oh Rambhai, we could've discussed
this over the phone as well.

1383
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:19,053
Why did you take the
trouble to come here?

1384
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:25,524
My mobile number is 9285000011...

1385
01:53:27,386 --> 01:53:32,535
any ways its Navratri, you're fortunate
to witness the Goddess herself.

1386
01:53:34,394 --> 01:53:35,533
Take prasaad (offering to God).

1387
01:53:35,562 --> 01:53:41,713
Pride against pride,
an eye for an eye, enough of this.

1388
01:53:44,039 --> 01:53:46,420
I am standing right here,
unarmed, kill me...

1389
01:53:46,475 --> 01:53:48,548
...if that's what
brings your son back.

1390
01:53:50,213 --> 01:53:54,394
And one last thing, we Rajadis respect
and protect our women with our lives.

1391
01:53:55,551 --> 01:54:00,233
And if you doubt that, try
building a relationship with us.

1392
01:54:07,266 --> 01:54:08,770
Long live Lord Ram!

1393
01:54:34,764 --> 01:54:36,507
Goli, see who's calling?

1394
01:54:36,666 --> 01:54:43,489
Uncle, unknown number... 9285000011

1395
01:54:49,348 --> 01:54:50,350
say...

1396
01:54:50,449 --> 01:54:53,296
Rambhai, you recognized my number?

1397
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:58,641
A real man's voice echoed
in this mansion after long.

1398
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:02,309
You were right,
let's build a relationship.

1399
01:55:02,696 --> 01:55:05,145
And hey Leela, where are you going!

1400
01:55:05,634 --> 01:55:07,137
She was sitting right here,

1401
01:55:07,168 --> 01:55:10,153
but at the mention of your name,
she blushed and ran away.

1402
01:55:12,642 --> 01:55:15,216
Tomorrow is the first night
of Navratri celebrations,

1403
01:55:15,478 --> 01:55:17,654
You must come.

1404
01:55:19,148 --> 01:55:25,698
My official invitation,
Must be at your doorstep by now.

1405
01:55:46,214 --> 01:55:48,389
I hope you appreciate
my offering Rambhai.

1406
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:53,635
Actually, these Peacocks were
making too much noise around here.

1407
01:55:54,423 --> 01:55:57,465
We are enemies no more...

1408
01:55:59,196 --> 01:56:00,871
...so I hope you will be
there tomorrow night?

1409
01:56:00,931 --> 01:56:02,935
Baa,
if the invitation is so fancy,

1410
01:56:03,199 --> 01:56:05,443
then your hospitality will
be worth experiencing.

1411
01:56:05,904 --> 01:56:07,578
I will be there.

1412
01:56:07,905 --> 01:56:09,386
Get ready.

1413
01:56:09,475 --> 01:56:10,716
Thank you...

1414
01:56:10,908 --> 01:56:13,893
Alright then, see you tomorrow...

1415
01:56:13,946 --> 01:56:15,621
Rest in Peace...

1416
01:56:17,283 --> 01:56:20,632
oh I mean may your day be peaceful.

1417
01:56:25,425 --> 01:56:29,742
If he is a lover,
then I am a killer.

1418
01:56:35,904 --> 01:56:39,914
For the first time in Ranjaar, a
man has fought for a woman's honor.

1419
01:56:40,477 --> 01:56:43,256
Be it Rajadi or Sanera...

1420
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:45,759
For us you are our Don Rambhai.

1421
01:56:46,450 --> 01:56:49,765
This turban is for
every woman's pride.

1422
01:56:49,820 --> 01:56:53,432
Rambhai...

1423
01:56:53,459 --> 01:56:55,999
bhai... bhai...

1424
01:57:17,352 --> 01:57:21,328
As I await for my true love,

1425
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:23,394
I dance without shackles...

1426
01:57:23,459 --> 01:57:29,748
My pulse races to
the beat of every drum,

1427
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:36,817
And I wait for you to come
and change the rhythm of the life.

1428
01:57:37,309 --> 01:57:42,526
"Hey, drums beat. Come fast.
Open the shackles of my feet."

1429
01:57:42,583 --> 01:57:46,729
"Drums beat."

1430
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:48,825
"Drums beat with the kettle-drums
with huge sounds."

1431
01:57:48,889 --> 01:57:51,532
"Drums beat."

1432
01:57:51,826 --> 01:57:56,372
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."

1433
01:58:11,715 --> 01:58:15,429
"There is knocking on the door."

1434
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:17,524
"But he hasn't yet come."

1435
01:58:17,589 --> 01:58:20,699
"Since then, yeah, since then
I've been waiting.."

1436
01:58:20,759 --> 01:58:24,438
"Now open your arms and come."

1437
01:58:24,964 --> 01:58:28,039
"My heart roams here and there in joy,
getting all restless."

1438
01:58:28,101 --> 01:58:30,370
"The words of my beloved
speak out loud."

1439
01:58:30,371 --> 01:58:32,877
"Drums beat."

1440
01:58:33,107 --> 01:58:36,615
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."

1441
01:58:36,711 --> 01:58:40,823
"Drums beat."

1442
01:58:40,882 --> 01:58:43,661
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."

1443
01:58:44,053 --> 01:58:47,128
"Hey, drums beat. Come fast."

1444
01:58:47,391 --> 01:58:49,395
"Open the shackles of my feet."

1445
01:58:49,459 --> 01:58:53,571
"Drums beat."

1446
01:58:53,631 --> 01:58:55,738
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."

1447
01:58:55,766 --> 01:58:59,913
"Drums beat."

1448
01:58:59,938 --> 01:59:03,082
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."

1449
01:59:15,089 --> 01:59:18,425
"This green lemon-tree.-"

1450
01:59:18,426 --> 01:59:21,501
"..and green betel-tree."

1451
01:59:21,596 --> 01:59:24,638
"O Lord, don't refuse.."

1452
01:59:24,701 --> 01:59:27,685
"Please have a little stay
at my house."

1453
01:59:27,770 --> 01:59:30,948
"I'll not stay."

1454
01:59:31,007 --> 01:59:33,958
"As Goddess Sita is
waiting at my home."

1455
01:59:34,111 --> 01:59:37,460
"Sita, Alone there.."

1456
01:59:37,516 --> 01:59:40,967
"..waits for Ram and Lakshman."

1457
01:59:41,486 --> 01:59:44,562
"Every moment passes in agony."

1458
01:59:44,623 --> 01:59:46,662
"Now come and dance with me."

1459
01:59:46,725 --> 01:59:49,835
"Why do you shiver so much."

1460
01:59:49,896 --> 01:59:53,575
"Now don't be afraid of your heart."

1461
01:59:54,034 --> 01:59:56,517
"Peacocks now speak in the gardens."

1462
01:59:56,571 --> 01:59:59,487
"And the geography of
my heart has changed."

1463
01:59:59,507 --> 02:00:03,654
"Drums beat."

1464
02:00:03,712 --> 02:00:05,991
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."

1465
02:00:06,048 --> 02:00:10,000
"Drums beat."

1466
02:00:10,019 --> 02:00:12,833
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."

1467
02:00:13,156 --> 02:00:18,544
"Hey, drums beat. Come fast.
Open the shackles of my feet."

1468
02:00:18,595 --> 02:00:22,707
"Drums beat."

1469
02:00:22,768 --> 02:00:24,842
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."

1470
02:00:24,904 --> 02:00:29,015
"Drums beat."

1471
02:00:29,075 --> 02:00:31,182
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."

1472
02:00:31,211 --> 02:00:35,528
"Drums beat."

1473
02:00:35,549 --> 02:00:37,622
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."

1474
02:00:37,684 --> 02:00:41,762
"Drums beat."

1475
02:00:41,856 --> 02:00:43,896
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."

1476
02:00:43,959 --> 02:00:48,071
"Drums beat."

1477
02:00:48,130 --> 02:00:50,237
"Drums beat with the kettledrums
with huge sounds."

1478
02:00:50,533 --> 02:00:56,719
"Drums beat."

1479
02:00:56,974 --> 02:01:00,049
"This green lemon-tree.-"

1480
02:01:00,077 --> 02:01:03,119
"..and green betel-tree."

1481
02:01:03,214 --> 02:01:06,222
"O Lord, don't refuse.."

1482
02:01:06,252 --> 02:01:09,065
"Please have a little stay
at my house."

1483
02:01:09,088 --> 02:01:12,232
"I'll not stay."

1484
02:01:12,259 --> 02:01:15,106
"As Goddess Sita is
waiting at my home."

1485
02:01:15,162 --> 02:01:18,169
"Sita, alone there.."

1486
02:01:18,231 --> 02:01:21,307
"..waits for Ram and Lakshman."

1487
02:01:45,998 --> 02:01:49,882
After what happened to Baa, it is
hard to trust anyone, Bhavani bhai.

1488
02:01:50,168 --> 02:01:52,880
Thankfully, by God's grace,
Buahujoor is alive.

1489
02:01:53,105 --> 02:01:55,314
But the wound is deep,
her condition is still critical.

1490
02:01:55,608 --> 02:01:56,952
Now just wait and
watch Rasila bhabhi,

1491
02:01:56,976 --> 02:01:58,719
I will not spare that Ram
and those wretched Rajadis.

1492
02:01:58,778 --> 02:02:01,956
Bhavani bhai, it is not
the time to discuss these things.

1493
02:02:02,116 --> 02:02:04,065
This is the time
indeed Rasila bhabhi,

1494
02:02:04,118 --> 02:02:07,295
Now the silent film is over
and the action shall begin.

1495
02:02:07,789 --> 02:02:09,293
Henceforth I will
be calling the shots...

1496
02:02:09,324 --> 02:02:11,306
...and my decision
is blood for blood.

1497
02:02:13,663 --> 02:02:17,376
Not blood for blood Bhavani bhai,
blood in the place of blood.

1498
02:02:17,801 --> 02:02:20,079
"Leela will take Baa's place"

1499
02:02:20,137 --> 02:02:23,851
...that's mine and the
entire Sanera clan's decision.

1500
02:02:23,908 --> 02:02:25,047
You may confirm if you want.

1501
02:02:25,142 --> 02:02:27,215
What the hell does Leelaben
know about our business?

1502
02:02:27,846 --> 02:02:30,261
I have learnt from Buahujoor
since I was 5 years old,

1503
02:02:30,315 --> 02:02:32,092
this business is my entire life.

1504
02:02:32,151 --> 02:02:34,259
You've been learning
since you were 5,

1505
02:02:34,387 --> 02:02:36,027
she has learned in the womb.

1506
02:02:36,256 --> 02:02:38,657
Even Abhimanyu(a famed warrior) had
learned in the womb Rasila bhabhi,

1507
02:02:38,658 --> 02:02:39,899
yet he could not brave
the conspiracies of war.

1508
02:02:39,993 --> 02:02:43,069
It's time to change Baa's
dressing... go call the Doctor.

1509
02:02:55,678 --> 02:02:58,025
Who gave you the right
to decide for me?

1510
02:02:59,682 --> 02:03:01,186
You know how much
I hate all this...

1511
02:03:01,252 --> 02:03:03,701
...this business, this bloodshed.
And yet you are forcing me into this.

1512
02:03:03,754 --> 02:03:06,704
This is your legacy Leela
and you cannot change it.

1513
02:03:07,092 --> 02:03:08,401
Use your mind,

1514
02:03:08,692 --> 02:03:12,770
If Bhavani takes over
he will destroy Ranjaar.

1515
02:03:14,033 --> 02:03:15,377
Now it's your call.

1516
02:03:39,963 --> 02:03:42,446
You should've completed
thejob Radhubhai.

1517
02:03:42,766 --> 02:03:45,750
A wounded Tigress
is always more dangerous.

1518
02:03:45,937 --> 02:03:48,317
Pujalal just as you are flying
a kite... in a sky without breeze,

1519
02:03:48,406 --> 02:03:52,256
our enemy was shot at,
without us even firing.

1520
02:03:52,745 --> 02:03:55,091
If we all start cutting
each other's kites the way you do,

1521
02:03:55,246 --> 02:03:58,755
then our underworld
will be doomed. Am I correct?

1522
02:03:58,919 --> 02:03:59,921
But what is the proof...

1523
02:03:59,986 --> 02:04:02,161
...that the Rajadis
have shot Dhankor.

1524
02:04:02,289 --> 02:04:04,430
When a snake is wounded,

1525
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:07,999
only a mongoose is to blame
Radhubhai. Isn't it Rambhai?

1526
02:04:08,763 --> 02:04:12,841
We have decided, a compromise
is the only option for you.

1527
02:04:13,101 --> 02:04:14,446
Don't worry,

1528
02:04:15,003 --> 02:04:16,450
meeting has already been fixed...

1529
02:04:16,505 --> 02:04:19,318
...at Dhankor's house to be
presided over by the village head.

1530
02:04:19,375 --> 02:04:22,451
If compromise is inevitable,
then bring Dhankor here,

1531
02:04:22,878 --> 02:04:25,863
if she apologizes, then so will we.

1532
02:04:25,982 --> 02:04:27,361
I will go there...

1533
02:04:31,022 --> 02:04:32,799
...tomorrow evening at 6,
confirmed.

1534
02:04:32,957 --> 02:04:34,233
Ram...

1535
02:04:34,993 --> 02:04:36,200
Come on Baapji...

1536
02:04:39,965 --> 02:04:41,310
I am the Don.

1537
02:04:56,251 --> 02:04:58,427
How is Dhankor feeling now,
Bhavani?

1538
02:04:58,854 --> 02:05:00,858
If she's better,
can we go and speak to her?

1539
02:05:00,923 --> 02:05:04,340
That's not required Sir,
Hujoor is coming here.

1540
02:05:04,494 --> 02:05:07,535
Look everyone,
how strong Dhankor is...

1541
02:05:07,831 --> 02:05:09,209
...she is up and
about within 2 days.

1542
02:05:09,266 --> 02:05:11,340
Really impressive...

1543
02:05:31,192 --> 02:05:32,901
Hey Bhavani bhai,
this is ridiculous.

1544
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:36,538
Now we have to discuss
business with a kid?

1545
02:05:36,965 --> 02:05:39,448
Are there no men
left in this house?

1546
02:05:39,568 --> 02:05:42,416
This business was never
dependent on any man, Pujalal.

1547
02:05:43,973 --> 02:05:46,547
All their cargo comes via
our Mundhra ships, right Ujjwal?

1548
02:05:46,877 --> 02:05:47,876
Yes hujoor.

1549
02:05:47,877 --> 02:05:49,415
Starting tomorrow,
let them find another way.

1550
02:05:49,547 --> 02:05:50,994
As you say, Hujoor.

1551
02:05:56,053 --> 02:05:58,901
Is Dhankor feeling
better now, dear?

1552
02:05:59,257 --> 02:06:01,170
Yes, with Goddess Am he's blessings.

1553
02:06:01,894 --> 02:06:03,398
Now I am handling everything.

1554
02:06:03,562 --> 02:06:06,604
So I stay very busy. You must be
very busy too, with the elections.

1555
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:09,144
Yes the elections
are approaching my dear,

1556
02:06:09,503 --> 02:06:12,112
but nothing will be possible
without your support.

1557
02:06:12,573 --> 02:06:13,907
And we will get your
support only when...

1558
02:06:13,908 --> 02:06:15,651
Baa has been wounded deeply, sir.

1559
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:21,923
And at her age, it takes
time for the wounds to heal.

1560
02:06:22,418 --> 02:06:26,029
That is exactly why we wanted
you all to talk face to face.

1561
02:06:26,155 --> 02:06:27,465
Face to face?

1562
02:06:28,458 --> 02:06:31,203
These Rajadis should
be sitting behind.

1563
02:06:32,028 --> 02:06:34,204
So they can easily
stab us in the back.

1564
02:06:34,932 --> 02:06:39,477
See the thing is, Saneras and Rajadis
have been enemies for over 500 years,

1565
02:06:40,105 --> 02:06:42,053
and because of this enmity,

1566
02:06:42,474 --> 02:06:45,618
business is hampered,
too much blood has been shed...

1567
02:06:45,644 --> 02:06:47,489
...we are losing both,
money and lives.

1568
02:06:47,647 --> 02:06:50,962
That is why we want
both of you to unite.

1569
02:06:52,118 --> 02:06:54,226
At least someone wants us to unite.

1570
02:06:54,288 --> 02:06:56,031
I can't let that happen Sir,

1571
02:06:57,992 --> 02:06:59,234
they killed my brother.

1572
02:06:59,294 --> 02:07:00,569
Even my brother was killed, Sir.

1573
02:07:00,628 --> 02:07:02,337
They tried to rape
my sister-in-law!

1574
02:07:02,397 --> 02:07:03,399
They tried the same on our women!

1575
02:07:03,466 --> 02:07:06,075
- They shot my mother!
- They took away my wife!

1576
02:07:06,135 --> 02:07:08,584
If you avenged everything else,
then why not this?

1577
02:07:09,972 --> 02:07:12,717
Guns were fired in name of
compromise, why not avenge that?

1578
02:07:14,177 --> 02:07:16,660
Avenge broken promises, avenge
running away from responsibilities!

1579
02:07:16,681 --> 02:07:19,324
Whole world ridiculed us,
why not avenge that?

1580
02:07:27,559 --> 02:07:30,237
Any ways, not everyone is
capable of loving their enemy.

1581
02:07:33,499 --> 02:07:35,174
Alright Sir, consider
this over from my end as well.

1582
02:07:35,235 --> 02:07:36,614
Here is your compromise.

1583
02:07:39,006 --> 02:07:40,544
Henceforth,
there will be no relationship...

1584
02:07:40,609 --> 02:07:43,023
"between any Sanera and Rajadi."

1585
02:07:45,214 --> 02:07:47,697
Starting today,
our paths will never cross.

1586
02:07:49,419 --> 02:07:50,728
As far as business goes...

1587
02:07:51,288 --> 02:07:52,701
...you will manage
the tobacco business...

1588
02:07:53,023 --> 02:07:54,264
...and we will handle
the arms smuggling.

1589
02:07:54,424 --> 02:07:56,201
Hey! Popat make a note...

1590
02:07:56,460 --> 02:08:00,538
...we will stay intoxicated, as we
have handed over our senses to them.

1591
02:08:00,731 --> 02:08:02,610
The sea route will be ours...

1592
02:08:02,700 --> 02:08:04,045
...roads will be yours.

1593
02:08:04,069 --> 02:08:05,208
That's appropriate.

1594
02:08:05,638 --> 02:08:08,086
Popat, get ready
for a bland life...

1595
02:08:08,140 --> 02:08:11,215
...for the seas and
salt belong to them now.

1596
02:08:11,477 --> 02:08:15,430
There will be no exchange
of bullets, food grains or girls.

1597
02:08:15,549 --> 02:08:19,434
Write...
starting today we won't shoot,

1598
02:08:19,754 --> 02:08:23,171
won't eat, won't even get married.

1599
02:08:26,060 --> 02:08:28,634
"Since we have sorted everything...
let's embrace once and seal the deal"

1600
02:08:28,730 --> 02:08:30,268
These people have
stabbed us in the back,

1601
02:08:30,332 --> 02:08:31,745
- now they want to embrace?
- Bhavani.

1602
02:08:32,067 --> 02:08:34,482
These Rajadis have
tried to kill Buahujoor!

1603
02:08:34,771 --> 02:08:36,252
"If we give them any more chances"

1604
02:08:36,306 --> 02:08:38,516
"these rascals will
enter our house and..."

1605
02:08:38,576 --> 02:08:40,080
...spit on us!

1606
02:08:42,413 --> 02:08:43,655
Bring over the spittoon...

1607
02:08:45,784 --> 02:08:47,527
The spittoon.

1608
02:08:50,189 --> 02:08:51,499
Here...

1609
02:08:54,593 --> 02:08:55,596
We have carted around
dead bodies for long..

1610
02:08:55,629 --> 02:08:58,374
...It's time now to focus
on business. - What is it huzoor.

1611
02:08:59,133 --> 02:09:00,613
Don't you feel comfortable
on this seat...

1612
02:09:00,667 --> 02:09:02,114
...is that why you are
scared to take revenge?

1613
02:09:02,136 --> 02:09:03,515
Hey!

1614
02:09:04,138 --> 02:09:07,453
If she were a coward,
she would've attacked from behind...

1615
02:09:08,510 --> 02:09:10,857
...not loved openly.

1616
02:09:13,717 --> 02:09:16,165
Ok Sir, the decision is final.

1617
02:09:18,855 --> 02:09:20,804
Now let's be enemies...

1618
02:09:24,128 --> 02:09:25,130
...in love.

1619
02:09:25,163 --> 02:09:27,202
Bhai... bhai...
bhai... bhai...

1620
02:09:29,468 --> 02:09:32,145
Relax losers... it's
just my cellphone!

1621
02:09:34,474 --> 02:09:36,319
Hujoor, one photo please...

1622
02:09:37,477 --> 02:09:38,753
Hey Popat...

1623
02:09:39,179 --> 02:09:40,854
...this should be
on Twitter by tonight...

1624
02:09:41,147 --> 02:09:42,890
...and in the papers
by tomorrow morning.

1625
02:09:44,218 --> 02:09:47,499
Ram-Leela unite...

1626
02:09:50,725 --> 02:09:52,571
Rambhai...

1627
02:09:52,661 --> 02:09:54,267
Rambhai...

1628
02:09:55,498 --> 02:09:57,879
Come on Popat! Let's leave...

1629
02:10:11,717 --> 02:10:13,926
Gujarat's Home
Minister has spent...

1630
02:10:14,187 --> 02:10:15,896
...more than 8 crores on his...

1631
02:10:16,188 --> 02:10:18,762
...daughter's wedding, the social
workers are protesting against that.

1632
02:10:20,361 --> 02:10:22,468
Tomorrow is the
last day of Ramleela.

1633
02:10:27,368 --> 02:10:29,874
Police on high alert...

1634
02:10:31,807 --> 02:10:34,484
This year the Goddess' sacrament
will be distributed by you...

1635
02:10:34,710 --> 02:10:35,918
I will take you there.

1636
02:10:36,211 --> 02:10:37,419
How are you... Buahujoor.

1637
02:10:40,885 --> 02:10:43,231
- These are some important documents...
- I am sitting with Baa right now.

1638
02:10:43,286 --> 02:10:47,740
It's urgent... this is the agreement
made with the Rajadis yesterday...

1639
02:10:47,892 --> 02:10:49,395
Please go through them once...

1640
02:10:50,795 --> 02:10:52,743
You have read it right?

1641
02:10:56,301 --> 02:10:58,511
Don't worry Baa,
everything is running smoothly.

1642
02:11:00,239 --> 02:11:02,312
We have doubled
the extortion rates,

1643
02:11:02,609 --> 02:11:05,684
all the murder charges
in your name have been settled.

1644
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:09,257
We are filing our tender
for Ahmedabad highway.

1645
02:11:09,851 --> 02:11:13,428
That contract has
to be ours Bhavanibhai...- Yes.

1646
02:11:13,789 --> 02:11:15,828
Even Pankaj bhai has been sorted...

1647
02:11:17,627 --> 02:11:20,304
No problem at all, you go
ahead and sign. We will manage...

1648
02:11:26,770 --> 02:11:29,013
Some people are waiting
for you in the hall...

1649
02:11:33,779 --> 02:11:35,886
It's amazing how you
have been managing all this.

1650
02:11:47,828 --> 02:11:49,673
It doesn't hurt any more, Baa.

1651
02:12:04,548 --> 02:12:06,826
Your order has arrived Radhubhai.

1652
02:12:06,983 --> 02:12:12,668
It's the latest stock, even Sahara's
don't have it. It's special.

1653
02:12:12,823 --> 02:12:14,325
How is this special Panna bhai?

1654
02:12:14,326 --> 02:12:15,830
These guns don't take lives, is it?

1655
02:12:15,994 --> 02:12:17,566
Get this placed in the store room.

1656
02:12:17,663 --> 02:12:20,078
Ram this is not the
time to store these guns.

1657
02:12:20,866 --> 02:12:22,678
It's time to pick them up.

1658
02:12:22,836 --> 02:12:26,413
Ever since you took over, our guns and
ammunition business has fallen flat.

1659
02:12:26,539 --> 02:12:28,020
That cunning girl...

1660
02:12:28,042 --> 02:12:29,580
...has allotted all
the failing businesses to us.

1661
02:12:29,910 --> 02:12:31,858
And has taken over all
the big contracts herself.

1662
02:12:31,946 --> 02:12:36,628
I must say Baapji, you are very lucky
to have such a smart daughter-in-law.

1663
02:12:37,386 --> 02:12:40,461
You think she will
be able to forget all this?

1664
02:12:40,522 --> 02:12:43,564
Im possible!
How can she ever forget me?

1665
02:12:43,893 --> 02:12:45,738
She will definitely
take her revenge.

1666
02:12:45,795 --> 02:12:47,640
Even though someone
else may have shot Dhankor.

1667
02:12:47,698 --> 02:12:50,705
What's shooting and killing father?

1668
02:12:50,867 --> 02:12:53,909
With a single arrow passing
through both our hearts,

1669
02:12:54,472 --> 02:12:59,052
she and I still go on living...

1670
02:12:59,979 --> 02:13:02,394
Hey, see!

1671
02:13:02,715 --> 02:13:06,725
Ram Leela's photo! Directly
from Twitter to the front page...

1672
02:13:07,486 --> 02:13:09,126
Frame this photo and hang it.

1673
02:13:09,390 --> 02:13:11,668
There should be at least one
photo of the married couple, right?

1674
02:13:11,725 --> 02:13:14,106
- Ram!
- To celebrate our wedding,

1675
02:13:14,394 --> 02:13:17,937
this time Rajadis will burn Havana's
(Symbol of Evil) effigy in Ranjaar!

1676
02:13:29,980 --> 02:13:33,932
Ujjwal, this year Ravana looks
a lot like that Rajadi Don, right?

1677
02:13:41,626 --> 02:13:43,608
That Ram along with his Rajadis...

1678
02:13:43,662 --> 02:13:46,043
...is eagerly looking forward
to burn the effigy, Bhavani bhai.

1679
02:13:46,165 --> 02:13:49,947
That will happen only if
they manage to reach here, right?

1680
02:13:50,437 --> 02:13:55,620
Leelaben has made a huge mistake by
signing the orders without reading.

1681
02:13:56,444 --> 02:13:59,452
Now no Rajadi will be spared.

1682
02:14:00,114 --> 02:14:02,529
That's a brilliant
plan Bhavani bhai...

1683
02:14:03,451 --> 02:14:05,456
...now that seat will be yours.

1684
02:14:05,721 --> 02:14:08,204
The seat is guaranteed Ujjwal.

1685
02:14:09,025 --> 02:14:12,909
I spent my entire
bloody life for it...

1686
02:14:13,464 --> 02:14:16,539
I shot my own Buahujoor for it...

1687
02:14:16,634 --> 02:14:19,982
How can I let Leela use
this seat to further her romance?

1688
02:14:21,139 --> 02:14:25,182
Now I will put an end to
this love story once and for all.

1689
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:34,703
Hello everyone,
hello brothers and their sisters...

1690
02:14:35,522 --> 02:14:39,908
For the evil Ravana of Ranjaar...

1691
02:14:39,995 --> 02:14:45,110
...it's the doom day, in the barren
desert flowers would bloom today.

1692
02:14:48,505 --> 02:14:53,550
Welcome to the last day
of Ram-Leela (The festive play).

1693
02:15:02,521 --> 02:15:08,809
Look at how Ramji walks.
Look at the audacity in his eyes.

1694
02:15:09,695 --> 02:15:17,695
Look at how Ramji walks.
Look at the audacity in his eyes.

1695
02:15:18,539 --> 02:15:22,720
Here goes Lord Ram...
carrying his bow and arrow...

1696
02:15:22,777 --> 02:15:24,885
On one side is army of evil...

1697
02:15:24,947 --> 02:15:30,232
on the other side is goodness
of Lord Hanumaan(Monkey God)...

1698
02:15:30,286 --> 02:15:33,737
Long live Lord Ram!

1699
02:15:47,939 --> 02:15:52,154
Let goodness prevail!

1700
02:15:52,245 --> 02:15:57,030
Lord Ram returns home today, we
rejoice, a thousand lamps we light,

1701
02:15:57,083 --> 02:16:02,699
"O beloved!"

1702
02:16:06,661 --> 02:16:09,839
"O beloved!"

1703
02:16:16,206 --> 02:16:18,017
The war will start now.

1704
02:16:18,174 --> 02:16:22,286
On the day of festival,
Leela has killed innocent Rajadis.

1705
02:16:22,614 --> 02:16:23,958
She hasn't even spared women.

1706
02:16:24,849 --> 02:16:26,353
Read her orders.

1707
02:16:26,818 --> 02:16:28,630
Orders to kill the Rajadis...

1708
02:16:28,787 --> 02:16:30,165
...orders to kill us!

1709
02:16:30,989 --> 02:16:36,069
Hey Manga, let Ram know that his wife
shall die at the hand of Rajadis.

1710
02:16:36,129 --> 02:16:39,046
- Please Radhubhai, have some
faith in law. - Enough!

1711
02:16:39,133 --> 02:16:43,142
It's time for us
to take the law in our own hands!

1712
02:17:06,664 --> 02:17:10,411
For Lord Ram every
moment without Sita,

1713
02:17:10,936 --> 02:17:14,683
was a moment full of poison.

1714
02:17:15,207 --> 02:17:20,856
As Ram and Sita unite today,
let the lamps burn.

1715
02:17:25,386 --> 02:17:29,430
It's time to burn the evil,

1716
02:17:30,025 --> 02:17:32,064
It's time for Ranjaar
to give up arms!

1717
02:17:32,127 --> 02:17:36,809
Long live Lord Ram!

1718
02:18:08,069 --> 02:18:09,413
You may sit.

1719
02:18:11,940 --> 02:18:12,942
Hujoor, these people have come
all the way from Ahmedabad...

1720
02:18:13,008 --> 02:18:14,079
...to discuss an urgent matter.

1721
02:18:14,109 --> 02:18:15,418
"It is time for the
religious rituals to begin"

1722
02:18:15,443 --> 02:18:17,186
"cancel all the
meetings after this."

1723
02:18:17,346 --> 02:18:18,758
Ok Hujoor...

1724
02:18:18,914 --> 02:18:21,420
Oh, you still haven't gone home?

1725
02:18:22,451 --> 02:18:24,091
Haven't you returned
his passport yet, Ujjwal?

1726
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:26,034
I got my passport Leelaji.

1727
02:18:26,323 --> 02:18:28,202
Thanks to you,
I can finally go home.

1728
02:18:28,258 --> 02:18:29,762
Thank you so much.

1729
02:18:30,828 --> 02:18:32,936
I will never be able to forget you.

1730
02:18:33,999 --> 02:18:35,274
Me too.

1731
02:18:39,371 --> 02:18:40,442
Where is Bhavani?

1732
02:18:40,472 --> 02:18:42,785
Bhavanibhai has gone
to finish your work, Hujoor.

1733
02:18:42,842 --> 02:18:44,950
- Regarding the orders you had passed.
- What orders?

1734
02:18:45,145 --> 02:18:47,286
The orders you signed
the other day...

1735
02:18:47,314 --> 02:18:50,458
I must say Hujoor,
what brilliant orders.

1736
02:18:50,818 --> 02:18:54,065
You managed to do what
no other Don has ever done before.

1737
02:18:54,189 --> 02:18:57,003
This is the best
Dassera for Saneras.

1738
02:18:57,059 --> 02:18:59,405
But what have I done?

1739
02:18:59,461 --> 02:19:01,033
The ultimate coup!

1740
02:19:01,964 --> 02:19:03,468
Rajadi's were on their
way to burn the Ravana's effigy,

1741
02:19:03,533 --> 02:19:05,914
but you went ahead
and got their Ram killed!

1742
02:19:09,974 --> 02:19:12,013
- What did you say?
- Yes Hujoor...

1743
02:19:12,076 --> 02:19:15,323
Yes Hujoor... That Rajadi Rambhai
has been killed on his own chariot.

1744
02:19:15,913 --> 02:19:17,827
"Some Astrologer had predicted,"

1745
02:19:17,849 --> 02:19:20,263
"that this year Ravana
won't burn in Ranjaar."

1746
02:19:20,519 --> 02:19:24,198
Now see Ravana
will burn at the hands of Saneras.

1747
02:19:26,259 --> 02:19:28,208
You are a Goddess for us, Hujoor.

1748
02:19:28,262 --> 02:19:32,112
Long live Hujoor!

1749
02:19:33,568 --> 02:19:39,024
Long live Hujoor!

1750
02:19:39,074 --> 02:19:44,291
Long live Hujoor!

1751
02:19:44,847 --> 02:19:48,298
Long live Hujoor!

1752
02:19:58,096 --> 02:20:01,206
Hail Goddess Am be!

1753
02:20:02,301 --> 02:20:05,252
Hail Goddess Am be!

1754
02:20:06,472 --> 02:20:09,548
Hail Goddess Am be!

1755
02:20:09,877 --> 02:20:11,586
Go ahead... immerse the idol.

1756
02:20:12,546 --> 02:20:14,289
Tell me sarpanch (chief)...

1757
02:20:15,049 --> 02:20:17,555
Looks like the Rajadis are being
immersed this year in their own blood.

1758
02:20:19,221 --> 02:20:21,898
Ranjaar's Dassera has been
colored red this time.

1759
02:20:22,057 --> 02:20:24,165
Don't speak in riddles...

1760
02:20:24,993 --> 02:20:28,444
Ujjwal, what is he trying to say?

1761
02:20:28,932 --> 02:20:31,575
What will he tell you?
I will explain.

1762
02:20:32,003 --> 02:20:34,919
The truth Dhankor, is that
the Rajadis are being murdered..

1763
02:20:34,939 --> 02:20:37,080
...In each and every
corner of this village.

1764
02:20:37,408 --> 02:20:41,486
Ram Leela had made an agreement,
but you did not honor it.

1765
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:45,031
I did not expect
this of the Saneras.

1766
02:20:45,350 --> 02:20:49,633
If only hatred was taught... then
how did Ram Leela fall in love?

1767
02:20:50,424 --> 02:20:51,996
Rajadi woman!

1768
02:20:54,928 --> 02:20:56,466
That's right.

1769
02:20:57,598 --> 02:20:59,945
Meghji's widow, Kesar.

1770
02:21:01,168 --> 02:21:03,515
You succeeded in wiping off Rajadis
from face of Ranjaar.

1771
02:21:07,444 --> 02:21:10,121
This is my son,
Rajadi's last living heir.

1772
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:12,225
Kill him as well.

1773
02:21:13,283 --> 02:21:15,459
Then there will
be no love and no war.

1774
02:21:19,023 --> 02:21:20,196
Maa!

1775
02:21:25,531 --> 02:21:31,317
Ranjaar's women waste their time
giving birth to boys, raising them.

1776
02:21:32,138 --> 02:21:35,385
It only takes a single bullet
of your enmity to take their lives.

1777
02:21:45,153 --> 02:21:46,999
She is right Baa...

1778
02:21:47,156 --> 02:21:49,399
...with every bullet
fired not only a son...

1779
02:21:49,525 --> 02:21:51,599
...but even a mother dies.

1780
02:21:52,995 --> 02:21:56,173
I am thankful to Goddess Ambe
for not giving me a child.

1781
02:22:14,521 --> 02:22:17,095
You look shocked to see me alive.

1782
02:22:23,431 --> 02:22:26,381
You coolly signed those orders...

1783
02:22:29,038 --> 02:22:31,715
Ram, Ram, Ram! So many
Rajadis have been murdered...

1784
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:33,620
...now they are coming to kill you.

1785
02:22:35,244 --> 02:22:36,657
So have you come to save me?

1786
02:22:38,049 --> 02:22:39,324
No I have come to kill you.

1787
02:22:40,283 --> 02:22:44,065
You turned out to be as wretched as
you are beautiful.

1788
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:46,738
Even you think that
I passed those orders?

1789
02:22:46,758 --> 02:22:48,569
No..

1790
02:22:49,228 --> 02:22:51,176
In that case how am I wretched?

1791
02:22:52,297 --> 02:22:54,610
Because you fell
in love with a Rajadi.

1792
02:22:55,268 --> 02:22:59,345
A love story should not be so toxic
that innocent people die.

1793
02:23:01,175 --> 02:23:03,419
Now you look like
the Leela I fell for.

1794
02:23:06,415 --> 02:23:08,590
Now you also look like
the Ram I fell in love with.

1795
02:23:09,819 --> 02:23:11,801
Listen,
I have to tell you a secret.

1796
02:23:12,087 --> 02:23:13,432
What secret?

1797
02:23:13,490 --> 02:23:17,169
For the first time ever...
my gun is loaded.

1798
02:23:18,596 --> 02:23:20,099
You naughty Peacock!

1799
02:23:20,164 --> 02:23:23,444
Hey 136...I will change
my mind if you come so close.

1800
02:23:24,536 --> 02:23:26,779
When we should've
made love... we didn't.

1801
02:23:27,172 --> 02:23:28,675
Now, even that Peahen is pregnant,
but look at us...

1802
02:23:29,775 --> 02:23:32,782
...didn't get it from the only one
I have ever loved.

1803
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:36,489
I didn't get it from anyone.

1804
02:23:38,452 --> 02:23:40,661
How I always thought I would
get you the "morning after" pill...

1805
02:23:42,123 --> 02:23:44,629
...and how it's come
to evening bullets now.

1806
02:23:44,659 --> 02:23:45,730
I wanted us to have 18 kids.

1807
02:23:45,793 --> 02:23:49,644
That's funny, didn't take the exams
and yet want the results!

1808
02:23:56,138 --> 02:23:57,710
Come on...

1809
02:23:58,342 --> 02:24:01,485
...time is running out, our 'marriage'
convoy has reached Patel wadi.

1810
02:24:03,146 --> 02:24:05,151
We cannot die at their hands.

1811
02:24:05,250 --> 02:24:08,701
You own my life and I own yours.

1812
02:24:09,654 --> 02:24:12,661
With us gone,
the enmity in Ranjaar will be over.

1813
02:24:14,827 --> 02:24:18,176
Now you decide, who kills you...
the enemy or the lover?

1814
02:24:22,703 --> 02:24:24,343
What is your size?

1815
02:24:27,241 --> 02:24:30,454
Shirt is large,
for the pants it's extra large.

1816
02:24:31,579 --> 02:24:33,528
But why are you asking
for my measurements now?

1817
02:24:35,284 --> 02:24:37,266
Don't you want an outfit,
for the last rites?

1818
02:24:59,813 --> 02:25:02,889
Take this gun.

1819
02:25:06,286 --> 02:25:07,733
Don't you want revenge?

1820
02:25:08,289 --> 02:25:11,239
Uncle Ram says
if we forego revenge,

1821
02:25:11,426 --> 02:25:13,409
then the barren desert
shall bear flowers.

1822
02:25:19,969 --> 02:25:24,424
You address Kesar as Maa?

1823
02:25:28,645 --> 02:25:33,931
Everyone here calls me Baa.

1824
02:26:09,293 --> 02:26:11,468
Not this time, Buahujoor,

1825
02:26:11,795 --> 02:26:15,714
It's taken a lot of effort to
wipe out the Rajadis from Ranjaar.

1826
02:26:16,302 --> 02:26:18,876
I will not let this
opportunity slip away.

1827
02:26:21,641 --> 02:26:27,496
Hey Rajadi, it's a full moon night...
perfect time... let's do it tonight.

1828
02:26:28,316 --> 02:26:29,489
Last time we tried
doing it remember..

1829
02:26:29,550 --> 02:26:30,757
"They scared the life
out of us by pelting stones..."

1830
02:26:30,818 --> 02:26:33,496
...this time,
they will fire bullets.

1831
02:26:41,830 --> 02:26:43,436
Any last wish?

1832
02:27:27,050 --> 02:27:32,061
Sarpanch please send a message
to the Rajadis...

1833
02:27:33,424 --> 02:27:39,575
The Saneras and Rajadis will
celebrate Dassera together this time.

1834
02:27:39,965 --> 02:27:42,106
Bhai, bhai, bhai.

1835
02:27:43,569 --> 02:27:46,850
Rasila, start the preparations...

1836
02:27:48,609 --> 02:27:52,755
...today we will
send off Leela with Ram.

1837
02:27:54,148 --> 02:27:57,964
Hail Goddess Am be!

1838
02:27:59,921 --> 02:28:03,771
Do you hear the firing downstairs?

1839
02:28:03,926 --> 02:28:05,931
Your in-laws have arrived.

1840
02:28:08,698 --> 02:28:11,773
Show me, how good your aim is?

1841
02:28:14,872 --> 02:28:16,615
Your bullet should pierce my heart.

1842
02:28:18,777 --> 02:28:20,884
Just like the first time.

1843
02:28:29,156 --> 02:28:33,040
On the count of three...

1844
02:28:37,832 --> 02:28:39,141
1..

1845
02:28:46,141 --> 02:28:47,588
2..

1846
02:28:47,643 --> 02:28:49,022
Leela!!

1847
02:28:49,712 --> 02:28:51,489
The bad news is here.

1848
02:28:51,681 --> 02:28:54,597
Leela, Baa is calling
you downstairs, come quickly!

1849
02:28:54,884 --> 02:28:56,058
Listen...

1850
02:28:57,755 --> 02:28:58,996
Tell me...

1851
02:29:11,037 --> 02:29:12,746
Leela!

1852
02:29:21,750 --> 02:29:23,253
Leela!

1853
02:30:19,817 --> 02:30:23,964
That Dassera,
first time in 500 years

1854
02:30:24,322 --> 02:30:27,796
Rajadis and Saneras burnt the
effigy of evil Ravana, together.

1855
02:30:29,661 --> 02:30:33,944
Leela and Ram departed
amidst grand fanfare.

1856
02:30:34,934 --> 02:30:36,601
That last gunshot fired..

1857
02:30:36,602 --> 02:30:38,106
...by Ram Leela in name
of love still echoes...

1858
02:30:38,606 --> 02:30:42,319
and never has there been
a gun fired since in Ranjaar.

1859
02:30:42,943 --> 02:30:48,627
No longer are houses burned,
only lamps are lit.

1860
02:30:49,284 --> 02:30:52,997
If anger and revenge can turn
an ocean into a barren desert...

1861
02:30:53,856 --> 02:30:58,641
...then true love can also
make flowers bloom here.

1862
02:31:05,036 --> 02:31:09,387
"This red love, this remorse of love."

1863
02:31:09,641 --> 02:31:13,924
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."

1864
02:31:14,313 --> 02:31:18,391
"This red love, this remorse of love."

1865
02:31:18,651 --> 02:31:23,105
"This defect that love is,
this enmity of love."

1866
02:31:23,724 --> 02:31:26,868
"Love, love, love.."

1867
02:31:27,161 --> 02:31:34,109
"I have had such an enmity with you."

1868
02:31:36,105 --> 02:31:43,430
"I have had such an enmity with you."

1869
02:31:44,881 --> 02:31:51,865
"That I haven't remained
