Hold that. That's good.

1090
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,279
I know you couldn't care less
about the money.

1091
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:50,199
- Hmm?
- What do you think about this, Lucas?

1092
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,402
Is it any better?

1093
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,879
No. No, no.
It needs to be more... shadowy.

1094
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,999
We talked about this, Jules.

1095
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,239
It's a seduction scene.

1096
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:05,091
Take the shadow lights to half.

1097
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:09,999
How much, uh... is Joe getting?

1098
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,239
Five percent of the gross
until payoff.

1099
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,799
Then he goes to six percent. Twenty
percent of subsidiary rights...

1100
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,083
- including a movie sale.
- (JULES) Thanks. That's good.

of course my schedule's
impossible, but, uh...

1103
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,319
you know how I feel
about you, Jonesy.

1104
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,399
You've been like a father to me.

1105
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,967
And you a son to me.

1106
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,999
(JOE) I always look for
the worst in people.

1107
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,919
A piece of you in them?

1108
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,479
Yeah. A piece of me.

1109
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,599
And generally, I find it.

1110
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,439
Well, it may take you years,
but you'll find it.

Oh, you're cute. You are cute.

1112
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,599
It's looking better.

1113
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,759
I think we'll move you upstairs
to a private room.

1114
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,959
Oh, yeah.

1115
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,559
But you better rest. If you
don't, you're in for trouble.

1116
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,799
Oh, I will, Doctor.

1117
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,971

Mr. Gideon, what are you doing?

Oh, this?
I was just getting rid of it.

1122
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,279
I caught someone smoking and told
him a man in my condition...

1123
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,479
shouldn't even be around smoke.

I'm telling you, Gideon,
I got real insight into you.

1126
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,039
There's a deep-rooted fear
of being conventional.

1127
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,083
Right.

1128

Your blood pressure
is higher than we hoped.

1129

haven't improved one bit.

it's hard to expect us to.

I'll leave these menus with you.

1133
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:51,279
Please check off what you want
for the coming weeks, okay?

1134
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,399
Monday, I'll have roast beef. Tuesday,
chicken. Wednesday, steak.

1135

Joe, what does it mean?

1144
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,959
It means she's inherited
her mother's determination.

You're wonderful, wonderful.
The word "superstar"...

1151
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,599
is greatly overused
in this business.

1152
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,359
- Mm.
- But for my next guest...

1153
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:59,079
the word "superstar"
is totally inadequate.

Dr. Ballinger told me

Everything he does seems to be
a denial of his condition.

1188
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:02,879
Dr. Ballinger, every time I've
seen him, I get the impression...

1189
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,999
that he doesn't care
whether he lives or dies.

1190
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,959
Yes, I know.
But I think he cares a lot.

This broke every first-day record.
It's a blockbuster. A blockbuster.

1197
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,359
I mean a blockbuster!

1198
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,279
And those guys in California...

1199
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,439
You wouldn't believe

"Congratulations," they say.
"We're glad you took your time.

It was worth it.

1202

is up there on the screen."

1203
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,879
I'm telling you, they're talking about
a $ 3 1/2 million advertising budget.

Three and a half million dollars!

I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Do you believe that?

1206
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,679
Three and a half million dollars!

1207
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:00,039
This picture is going
right through the roof.

1208
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,279
Right through...

1209
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,959
the roof!

1210
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,279
Look at those reviews.
See? We did it.

1211
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,359
Joe, we did it!

1212
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,479
Where are the bad ones?

1213
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,839
There are no bad ones.

1214

Josh.

1215
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:19,959
There were a couple that quibbled
a little. I left them at the office.

1216
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:23,879
I want you to do me a favor:
Don't show them to me.

1217
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,559
Never.

1218
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,319
- How were the television reviews?
- I think we got Leslie Perry.

1219
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,799
At the screening,
she told me she loved it.

1220
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,479

1221

with Fifty Beautiful Girls, Fifty...

1222
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:40,039
when he won every possible award...

1223
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:43,759
it would be nice to report that
Mr. Gideon's latest effort...

1224
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,999
The Stand-up, starring
Davis Newman...

1225
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,799
was a better film.

1226
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:52,039
- Oh, boy. Here it comes.
- The Stand-up, however,
does not quite stand up.

1227
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:55,359
- Joey, turn it off, please.
- Leaning toward the frenetic, Gideon falls...

1228
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,879
into his characteristic weakness
of trying too hard...

1229
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:00,359
- to please, to entertain.
- I'm gonna turn that off.

1230
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,119
- Josh, no. I want to hear it.
- Slickness obscures reality.

1231
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,279
- The old razzle-dazzle obliterates drama.
- (JOSH) What the hell does she know?

1232
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,719
She never gave anything
a good review.

1233
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:12,879
That woman is totally unqualified
to criticize anything.

1234
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,199
She doesn't know
a goddamn thing about film.

1235
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,879
- Or anything.
- She's not even reviewing a film.

1236
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,039
She's telling you
how clever she is!

1237
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:23,839
where the has-been comic, played
impeccably by Davis Newman...

1238
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,239
demonstrates
his former brilliance...

1239
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,679
in a monologue where clearly...

1240
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:32,239
director Gideon gave
Mr. Newman free rein.

1241
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,799
Rising above
rather commonplace material...

1242
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,439
- the actor creates a classic comic aura...
- I don't care what she says.

1243
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,759
I guarantee this picture will do
30 million domestic, at least.

- One of you better get somebody.
- (KATIE) What?

1245
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,159
I think I'm in trouble.

- (JOSH) I'll get somebody.
- ...chopping offends of scenes

1247
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,759

with bewilderment...

1248
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,999
and a four-aspirin headache.

1356
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,289
And change.

1357
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,719
(JONESY) Let me try to understand.

1358
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:22,799
Of that figure,
how much do we recoup?

1359
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,399
I'm confused too. Do we get
all of that or part or what?

1360
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,279
Simply, here are the options. One:

1361
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,199
If Mr. Gideon recovers...

1362
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,559
and you resume production
within the 180 days...

1363
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,399
we are not liable for any of it.

1364
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,799
Two: If Mr. Gideon should die...

1365
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:41,959
and you resume production with another
director within the 180 days...

1366
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:45,119
we are still not liable.

1367
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,959
Three, however:

1368
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,079
If Mr. Gideon should expire
before February 1...

1369
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,759
and you abandon production...

1370
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,119
we are liable
for the full million dollars.

1371
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,519
This means, gentlemen...

1372
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:01,041
you could make a profit of...

1373
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:07,887
$519,500.

1374
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:11,599
You could be
the first show on Broadway...

1375
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,043
to make a profit
without really opening.

1376
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,889
Well...

1377
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,051
it's all very clear to me.

1378
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:36,199
(COMEDIAN) There's all this
bullshit about death with dignity.

1379
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,439
You know what death
with dignity is, man?
