- You disrupted your sisters.
- Well, they laughed.

161

- Well, I didn't.
- Daddy, why can't...

162
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,720
Is it too much to ask that you
simply walk with your family?

163
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:36,022
- That's all we ever do.
- Ariel...

164
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,461
- Can't we do something different?
- Enough!

165
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,767
You have to learn to respect

Well, then you'd better get started,

Oh, dear.

If I have to watch over these

- I'm gonna beach myself!
- Mm-hmm.

178

You should've heard that little
clawboy Sebastian today. "You're late."

[gibbering] If Triton wasn't looking,

I would have squashed
that crustacean into a crab cake!

- Dip.

- Yes. Twice.

Ooh! That Sebastian!

- Never heard that one.

How did that little invertebrate
get to be chief of staff?

188

- Chutzpah?
- I want that job.

189

I deserve that job!

a while and the girls are miserable?

00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,519
- Really?
- Yeah. That is two hours past curfew.

470
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:09,065
- Oh.
- Ooh, was it a boy?

471
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:12,534
- If it's a boy, I'm gonna die.
- Ugh... Drama.

472
00:31:12,603 --> 00:31:14,798
I mean, I'm happy for you, Ariel.

473
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:18,035
It's just that I'm two years
older than you,

474
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:21,169
and the only one I've come
even close to kissing is Stevie.

475
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:24,271
- Ew! Squid-Lips Stevie?
- It was on a dare.

476
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:28,011
- Whatever.
- Girls, let's stick to the subject.

477
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:31,218
Well, it wasn't a boy, OK?

478
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:35,487
I was just helping a friend.
Out past the kelp forest.

479
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,961
Ooh! Past the kelp forest.
It wasn't a boy.

480
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,397
- It was a bad boy.
- [gasping]

481
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,901
- Oh, Ariel.
- Simmer down there, sister.

482
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:48,097
- So you were just helping a friend?
- Um... Yep.

483
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,572
Then, where'd you get... this!

484
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:52,700
[all gasp]

485
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:55,439
[Attina] Can you imagine
what'd happen if Dad found it?

486
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,606
- He's never here.
- Don't get cute with me.

487
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,707
This is serious. Where were you?

488
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:10,627
I was just... listening to music
in an underground club.

489
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,788
OK, where were you really?

490
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,191
- [gasping] Listening to music?
- No way.

491
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,033
- What was it like?
- Come on. Spill it.

492
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,006
[laughs] Oh, it was amazing.

493
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:27,533
The energy, the dancing, the music...

494
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,809
Just makes you feel like...

495
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,907
Like what?

496
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,876
Like when Mom was here.

497
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:38,421
[murmuring]

498
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,694
Ariel, I wanna hear it, too.

499
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,355
- You do?
- Me, too.

500
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:49,592
- OK. Me, too.
- Me, too! Me, too!

501
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,794
- Not without me.
- Yeah. Everybody does.

502
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,429
Please, Ariel. Please?

503
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:57,030
- Well...
- Oh!

504
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,743
- We'll go tonight.
- I'm so excited!

505
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,335
- Music!
- What should I wear?

506
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,243
So you think there'll be boys?

507
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,714
- One way to find out.
- This is not happening!

508
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,650
You go again and I...

509
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:11,517
- Oh, lighten up.
- Come on.

510
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:14,418
[all] Mmm?

511
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,989
- OK.
- [all cheering]

512
00:33:18,095 --> 00:33:20,120
Come on, girls. Uppy-up.

513
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,404
- Morning.
- They're early.

514
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:33,534
Yes. But why?

515
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,875
Get your sea kelp. Salty or extra salty.

516
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:44,217
Hey, Ray-Ray. You gonna
rock the house tonight?

517
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,756
Well, wouldn't be here
just for the halibut.

518
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,951
- Oh, Ray-Ray.
- This is so exciting!

519
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:51,551
Hey, you're in my personal space.

520
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,427
- Stop pushing me.
- OK, bossy. Whatever.

- I know! Isn't it fantastic?

523
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:09,305
- And we're here together!
- Yeah!

524
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,314
Boys, here I come!

00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:18,116
Wow. This really is... fantastic.

527
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:21,989
- Yeah. I'm scared!
- Me, too.

528
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:24,391
- I thought I was the only one.
- No, no, no, no...

529
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:27,829
[Swifty] Ladies and gentlemen,
The Catfish Club is proud to present...

530
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,957
Let's just go!

...the original rock lobster.

- [both] Sebastian?

536
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,339
- Way to go, Sebastian!
- I love you, Sebastian.

537
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,941
- Hi!
- Whoo!

538
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,014
OK. Where are the boys?

539
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,755
Are you a boy? Good enough.

540
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:57,953
Whoa! I'm Adella.

541
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,123
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me!

542
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,732
- Would you like to dance?
- No, thanks.

543
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,685
- Let's dance.
- No, thanks.

544
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,859
Would ya like to dance?

545
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,458
[growls] I can't dance, OK?

546
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,504
I'm a mermaid with no grace.

547
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,165
I look like a spastic piece of kelp.

548
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:44,863
Let's go.

549
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,376
Seriously. No, I mean it.
You guys, I can't...

550
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,710
Come on.

551
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,045
- That's it!
- You've got it!

552
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,781
She really can't dance.

553
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:10,761
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah!

554
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,668
There ain't no problem with that.
Ah-cha, cha, cha.

555
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:14,762
Thank you.

556
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,833
You were right, Ariel.
Mom would've loved this.

557
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,468
- Yeah.
- [both] Thanks!

558
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:23,843
- You're the best.
- Really.

Ha!

We be jammin', mon.

564
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,286
That's right!

565
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,889
- Good night, Ariel.
- Good night, Andrina.

566

Zap-it-y-do-dah, zow!

- Sweet dreams, Ariel.

00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,699
- You, too, Alana.
- Good night, Adella.

569
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,638
I still didn't get to kiss a boy.

570
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:27,700

- Night.

Good night, Attina.

Your Highness.

574
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,450
We need to talk.

This is how you watch over
my daughter?

00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,901
- Sire, I...
- I trusted you.

583
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,635
Sire.

584
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,677
Guards! Lock him away.

585
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,715
- What? No!
- Lock them all away!

586
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:42,775
- But, Your Majesty, please!
- Come on. Let's move it.

587
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,988
- I'm with the band.
- Sure you are, kid.

588
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:51,687
Marina, you will take over
Sebastian's duties immediately.

589
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,192
As you wish.

590
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:59,394
- Attina, take your sisters home.
- Yes, sir.

591
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:04,236
- Father, you can't do this!
- It's already done!

592
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,181
Aah!

593
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:34,026
- You are all confined to the palace.
- Yes, Father.

594
00:39:34,104 --> 00:39:35,901
Why don't you just lock us in jail?

595
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:39,238
Ariel, you are confined to the palace

596
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,437
until you understand what you've done.

597
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,072
What did we do? Tell me, Daddy...

598
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:47,015
- Ariel, leave it alone.
- No.

599
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,918
We haven't done anything wrong.
All we did was listen to music.

600
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:55,823
- Which you know is forbidden!
- But why? Why can't we have music?

601
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,256
- This discussion is over.
- Just tell me!

602

I do not have to explain myself to you.

603

I don't understand. We love music.

604
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,402
I will not have music in my kingdom!

605

I may not remember much
about my mother,

but I know she wouldn't have
wanted this.

What?

611
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,929
It's over, Ariel.

612
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,934
But... we were finally happy.

613
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,395
Look around, Ariel.

- I don't know, but she scares me.

Whee!

618
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,589
Uh! Don't touch me.

619
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,629
Benjamin, tear out those puny windows.

620
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,029
- Rip down those narrow walls.
- Oh, no.

621
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,296
This is just the beginning.
I want a balcony

622
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,929
so I can wave down
to the adoring crowds.

623
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,701
But high enough so they
can't see disdain on my face.

624
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:54,107
Can you taste it, Benjamin?
The sweet taste of power!

625
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,443

- Ariel's missing.
- What?

777
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,287
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just... did.

778
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,661
We can't find her!
We've looked everywhere!

779
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:47,027
Don't worry. I'll find her.

780
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,365
Get me Sebastian!

781
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:52,033
What, what! No, no, no!
No, I'm in charge here! Well...

782
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,973
Sebastian's gone, too.

783
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:57,036
Guards! Search the palace.

784
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,206
Search every inch of Atlantica!

785
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:01,308
Find my daughter!

786
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:03,944
Your Majesty. Whoo-hoo!

787
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,011
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

[growls]

789
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,127
Sebastian.

790
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:22,737
- Are we there yet?
- No.

791
00:52:24,874 --> 00:52:26,535
- Are we there yet?
- No.

792
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,534
- Are we there yet?
- No.

- Are we there yet?
- No.

794
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,348
- Are we there yet?
- Yes. This is it.

795
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,980
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

796
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,419
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

797
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,717
- Are you s?
- Yes!

798
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:43,657
Oh, man. We can't live here!

799
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:47,959
Yeah, this place is all "Oom-pa-pa."
We need some... [drumbeats]

800
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:49,794
Nonsense. It's perfect.

801
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:53,199
Just listen to them acoustics:
<i># Do, re, me, fa, so, la, ti, do</i>

802
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:55,703
<i>[echoing] # Do, Do, Do...</i>

803
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:57,635
Solid.

804
00:52:59,909 --> 00:53:02,377
Well, it beats the dungeon.

805
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,437
But not by much.

806
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,983
It'll do for the time being. Excuse me.

807
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,250
Ooh...

808
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:20,495
- [sputtering]
- Sebastian, be honest. Are we lost?

809
00:53:20,563 --> 00:53:22,656
No, this is fine.

810
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:25,360
There's more to this place
than meets the eye.

811
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,077
[Flounder scatting]

812
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:38,342

- [Marina] Give me the key!
- [Benjamin] I said no.

815
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:47,154
Look, I haven't worked my tail off
for the last 12 hours

816
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:50,624
- just to have it snatched away.
- How about a nice relaxing bath?

817
00:53:50,693 --> 00:53:53,161
- Benjamin.
- Kelp wrap? Lomi lomi rub?

818
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,560
Give me the key!

819
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,929
You said never give it to you
in a fit of rage!

820
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,467
- I'm perfectly calm!
- Doesn't sound it.

821
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:02,232
- Give! Give!
- Oh!

822
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,500
- Mm-mmm.
- Give!

823
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,542

- Really? Where?

824
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:10,306
- Oh!

825
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,372
Ooh, yum-yums!

826
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,115
Come to Mommy.

OK, I'm not gonna watch this part.
[shuddering]

830
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:29,890
My, my, are you hungry? Ooh...

831
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:34,527
- Who wants crab cakes?
- What are you going to do?

832
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,596
Whatever it takes
to get rid of Sebastian!

833
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:40,871
- But what about Ariel?
- Ariel? Ariel?

834
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,139
You're right. She'll tattle.

835
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:45,873
- I'll have to get rid of her, too.
- What?

836
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:50,283
- That's brilliant, Benjamin, brilliant!
- OK, that wasn't what I meant.

837
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:53,550
I never liked her anyway.
I'll make it look like an accident.

838
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,683
That's it! An accidental
underwater ambush

839
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,785
by a team of the cutest
wittle yum-yums ever.

840
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,128
- You've lost your mind.
- Sic 'em, boys!

841
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,134
Ooh, what hath we wrought?

Oh, swim, you pretties.

Swim, you pretties. Faster! Swim.

- Sebastian.
- Five more minutes, Mommy.

00:55:49,812 --> 00:55:52,679
Sebastian, did you hear that?

849
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,081
Leave me alone. Sleeping.

850
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:59,417
But there's something out there.
Come on, help me find it.

851
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,252
I'm tired. You go check it out.

<i>[Athena's Song</i> plays]

856
00:57:15,898 --> 00:57:18,366
[Sebastian] It was an
anniversary present.

857
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:23,595
Your father had the music box
made for your mother.

858
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:26,267
Athena was more than his queen,
you know.

859
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,507
She was his best friend.

860

<i>[Ariel] The family together.</i>

[all laughing]

864
00:58:11,954 --> 00:58:16,550
When your mother died,
the whole kingdom was heartbroken.

865
00:58:17,226 --> 00:58:20,889
The heart that never healed
was your father's.

866
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,773
It's so sad.

867
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:36,175
He's forgotten
what it feels like to be happy.

868
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:43,447
I... I have to bring this back to him.

869
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,712
If you insist.

870
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:50,422
This is why we came here, isn't it?

871
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:56,126
Whoa, whoa, let me get this straight.
You led us out here...

872
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,791
To the armpit of nowhere, man.

873
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:00,392
In the hope that Red
might find the music box.

874
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,665
And now you wanna go back
to the palace...

875
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:06,869
- To return the music box to the king...
- On the chance that maybe it'll...

876
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:10,276
Remind him to remember
how to be happy...

877
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:13,110
And then he'll bring music back?

878
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:15,047
That about sums it up.

879
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:18,610
Couldn't we just strap it to a dolphin?
He'd get it eventually.

Listen, the band talked it over, and...

882
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:31,825
We just can't take that chance.

883
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:32,993
- What?
- Huh?

884
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:37,267
It's OK. Maybe someday
it'll be different.

885
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:40,174
You'll come home
and play music all you want.

886
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:43,611
Sure, Red. Someday.

887

Guys! We can't just let them
go back alone.

890
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:59,256
- Drop it, small fry.
- But we took an oath!

891
00:59:59,328 --> 01:00:03,059
To jump, jive, wail, groove,
rock steady, and at all times

892
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:05,692
lend a helping hand
to your fellow music lovers!

893

The Catfish Club is history.
That oath don't mean a thing.

894
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,809
Well, it still means something to me.

Hey, Ariel! Wait up! Ariel!

896
