Graduation is just
a few days away.

There's nothing left
to prepare for.

31
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:06,844
Our work here is done,

32
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:08,846
so there's only one thing
left to do:

33
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:09,931
Say goodbye.

34
00:01:09,998 --> 00:01:12,016
Underclassmen, pick some songs

35
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:13,301
to say goodbye to the seniors;

seniors, pick a song to say
goodbye to us.

37
00:01:15,837 --> 00:01:17,522
A part of me wants
to lock these doors

38
00:01:17,606 --> 00:01:19,190
and stay in here with
everyone forever.

39
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:20,675
We can use the wastebasket
for the toilet,

40
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:22,393
and then we could eat
Joe for the food,

41
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:23,278
since she's been here
the shortest,

42
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:24,812
so we know her
the least.

43

you're about to rap.

<i>Just get me something from Tom
Ford's Vanities in Vanity Fair.</i>

Good to know.

101
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:30,665
So... somewhere around
your seventh birthday,

102
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:32,800
I lost you.

103
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:34,669
Before that,
you were a normal kid.

104
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,471
I mean, a kid who
liked to dust, but...

105
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:38,806
You know, I read you to bed,

106
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:42,209
I put cartoons on TV
when you were bored.

107
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,811
I taught you how
to ride a bike...

108
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,879
the normal stuff.

109
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,232
And then you turned
seven or eight,

110
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:51,185
and you start to become this.

111
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:54,572
And, uh, it was like I was
living with an alien.

112
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:57,825
I mean, I tried to keep up,
but, uh, you know,

113
00:04:57,893 --> 00:04:59,410
once your mom passed, I...
I really...

114
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:00,745
I didn't stand a chance.

115
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:02,246
You did good, Dad.

116
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:05,666
I am proud of what you and I
did together.

117
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:06,667

118

Do you remember when it started?

119
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,121
When we turned a corner

120
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:12,373
and started walking
towards each other,

121
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:14,008
rather than in opposite
directions?

122
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:15,259
Tell me.

123
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:16,544
Aw, screw that,
I'm gonna show you.

124

It was in the basement
of our old house.

125
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,633
You were wearing
a unitard.

126
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:25,186
Oh, God, Dad, please
don't do this--

127

Oh, you didn't have to
get me a gift, silly.

160
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:37,124
Um... we've been putting
this off for far too long,

161
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:39,493
but don't you think we
should have the talk?

162
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:40,962
Can't we just have two
final days of denial?

163
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:42,630
No, no, we cannot.

164
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:44,098
This is happening
right now, Kurt.

165
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:45,716
It's not some far-off
thing in the future.

166
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:48,669
You're graduating,
I'm not.

167
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,006
You know how hard long-distance
relationships can be.

168
00:06:52,074 --> 00:06:53,674
<i>We both saw The Notebook.</i>

169
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:56,343
Do you want to know how
I picture the end of my life?

170
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:59,563
<i>Just like in The Notebook,
I'm sitting in a nursing home,</i>

171
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:02,149
talking endlessly about
my high school sweetheart--

172
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,567
my first love--

173
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:05,703
going on and on about
every little detail,

174
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:07,071
as if they matter.

175
00:07:07,155 --> 00:07:10,708
Only, in my version,
he's there with me,

176
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:12,660
telling me to shut up
so he can finish watching

177
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:15,212
the American Cinematheque
salute to J-Lo.

178
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:18,082
So... we're going
to be all right?

179
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,700
Yes, we're gonna
be all right.

180
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:22,253
I told you I'm never
saying goodbye to you.

181
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:25,089
We'll figure out this
whole long-distance
relationship thing.

182
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:27,174
I promise.

183
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:29,093
Okay.

184
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:32,430
So have you decided how you're

185
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:33,881
going to say goodbye
to everyone else?

186
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:36,100
(school bell rings)

187
00:07:36,184 --> 00:07:39,553
I wanted to dedicate my
goodbye song to all of you,

188
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:42,289
but I wanted to mostly
thank the men in the room

189
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:44,575
who have truly inspired me

190
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,911
and never saw me for the things
that made us different.

191
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:50,364
You only saw me for the ways
that we're the same.

192
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:52,283
Because, in this room...

193
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:55,503
it doesn't matter
if you're gay or straight...

194
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,555
what matters
is that we're friends.

(school bell rings)

229
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:09,136
Hey.

230
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:10,254
Oh, thank goodness
you guys are here.

231
00:10:10,338 --> 00:10:12,006
Okay, so I called
Pace and NYADA

232
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:14,592
and they sent out out
acceptance letters this week.

233
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:16,477
Oh, my God,
that's so exciting.

234
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:18,429
And, like,
totally terrifying.

235
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:19,480
We need to make a pact.

236
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:20,481
When we get our letters,

237
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:21,398
we open them together,

238
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:22,817
in the choir room.

239
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:25,186
These letters, you know,
they're, like our future

240
00:10:25,237 --> 00:10:26,487
so I want to open mine

241
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:28,022
with my two most
important people.

242
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:29,690
Deal?
Deal.

243
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:31,158
Deal.

244
00:10:31,226 --> 00:10:32,059
Pinkie swear?

245
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,776
Yeah.

246
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:33,727
All right.

247
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:35,767
+

248
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:39,278
(school bell rings)

249
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:42,814
What is this crap?
Oh, didn't you hear?

250
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:44,416
Mercedes got a
recording contract.

251
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:45,701
She's moving to Hollywood
and she's going to be

252
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:47,002
a superstar by Christmas,
guaranteed.

253
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:48,170
MERCEDES:
He's exaggerating.

254
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:49,788
You remember that video that

255
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,090
he posted of me on YouTube,
singing "Disco Inferno"?

256
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:53,125
Well, this music producer
in L.A. saw it

257
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:54,326
and he wants to sign her.

258
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:56,211
As a backup singer
on an indie label.

259
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,097
I'm going to be taking
extension classes at UCLA.

260
00:10:59,165 --> 00:11:02,134
If this was happening
to anyone else, I would be

261
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:03,302
extremely jealous.

262
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:05,637
This is really cool.

263
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:07,606
Congratulations.
Thank you.

264
00:11:07,673 --> 00:11:08,974
(grunts)

265
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:10,675
And I couldn't have done it
without you.

266
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:13,695
Oh, did you hear
about Mike?

267
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,231
I was all set to go
to Alvin Ailey,

268
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:19,201
and then Joffrey in Chicago
offered me a scholarship.

269
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:21,453
Oh, Mike, that's amazing.

270
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,355
Congratulations.

271
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:25,523
You must be so excited
to ditch that Cheerios! uniform

272
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:27,292
and put on the one
for University of Louisville.

273
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,578
Yeah, I... I can't wait.

274
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:31,747
<i>SANTANA:
This is embarrassing.</i>

275
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:35,801
<i>I'm a star, so what am I doing
heading to Kentucky?</i>

all I could
think of was,

282
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,099
I should have known.

283
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:53,151
When she was eight,
she went trick-or-treating

284
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:55,053
<i>as Uncle Jesse on Full House.</i>

285
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:57,689
Spent two years
growing out that hair.

286
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,224
"Business in the front..."

287
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:01,226
BOTH:
"Party in the back."
Ew.

288
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:03,028
So, you just really didn't care?

289
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:04,579
I care that my baby's happy.

290
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:06,865
<i>I wish abuela
felt the same.
I know.</i>

291
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,066
<i>It sucks, mija.</i>

292
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:09,334
But you don't want a
person in your life

293
00:12:09,402 --> 00:12:10,419
that doesn't support
your dreams.

294
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:13,789
I don't want to go
to that cheerleading program

295
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:15,123
at the University of Louisville.

296
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,508
I want to go to New York.

297
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:18,126
Go to college, Santana.

298
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:20,128
Do what I never
got the chance to do.

299
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:22,130
New York will
still be there

300
00:12:22,215 --> 00:12:24,049
after you've earned
your college degree.

301
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,302
Brittany, I understand you
got into Purdue University?

302
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:29,054
Not the university;
the poultry farm.

303
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:30,973
Plucker is a steady profession.

304
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:33,025
But I can't go to either
'cause I'm not graduating.

305
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:34,142
What?
Yeah.

306
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:35,477
I was kind of glad

307
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:37,112
when I found out
that I was flunking

308
00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:38,263
because it'll give me a chance

309
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:39,597
to do my senior year
all over again.

310
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:41,650
And way better. I'll show up
to my classes this time.

311
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:43,785
Plus, I'll get to be a two-term
senior class president.

312
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,437
Why are you pretending
that this is okay?

313
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,155
And why didn't you tell me?

314
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,157
What did you think
was going to happen to me?

315
00:12:49,242 --> 00:12:51,710
I have a 0.0
grade point average.

316
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:53,945
Well, maybe if Brittany's
staying in Lima,

And now the seniors of McKinley
High School, class of 2012,

319
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:05,390
are going to sing for you.

320
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,759
This is your glee club.
Take care of it.

321
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,311
It'll take care of you.

322

374
00:15:36,576 --> 00:15:38,410
I don't know. I mean, when
you're looking at both of them,

375
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:40,278
it's really hard to not just
want to go with the Chiavari.

376
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:42,831
There's $20 difference
between each of those chairs.

377
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:45,133
That's, like, hundreds
of dollars or something.

378
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:46,668
We can't afford that.

379
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:49,387
Look, I compromised on the food,
I compromised on the location,

380
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:50,722
I compromised
on the flowers.

381
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:52,307
Does my butt
really have to compromise

382
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:53,625
on what it sits on?

383
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:54,959
Maybe what you're
really upset about

384
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,228
is that you're compromising
on your husband.

385
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:57,512
Please, that
is the one thing

386
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:58,847
that I don't have
any doubts about.

387
00:15:58,931 --> 00:16:00,515
Really?

388
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,517
'Cause you've been kind of
giving me a weird vibe lately.

389
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:04,519
No.

390
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:07,822
You're just projecting,
all right?

391
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:09,307
You're nervous about
finding out about school,

392
00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:10,642
and you're
putting it on me.

393
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:12,477
Besides, when
did you become

394
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:14,246
the one that I
was settling for?

395
00:16:14,313 --> 00:16:18,033
Look, I don't care who
gets in where, all right?

396
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:21,169
I'm marrying you, and
nothing makes me happier.

397
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:25,006
Even if we have to sit in
these ugly fold-out chairs.

398
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,825
Okay?

00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:29,327

You're Finn Hudson, and
you want to be an actor.

419
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:12,013
I was very moved

420
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,598
by your letter
and application, Finn.

421
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,516
You're no doubt aware
that you would be

422
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,269
an exceptional case,
should we accept you.

Yes.

Hey. Just finishing up.

Lay it on me.

00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,170
"Dear Finn, great knowing you.

432
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,822
Will Schuester."
Are you kidding me?

433
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:40,041
I'm, like, the best
man at your wedding.
It's not that bad.

434
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,326
And you can't dictate
what I write in your yearbook.

435
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:44,095
Yes, I can. I want a
little emotion in there.

436
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:45,380
Some "son I never had"

437
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,547
or "little brother" garbage
or something.

438

Look, I-I wanted to. I...

439
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,051
I started ten times,
and I couldn't get

two words out
without falling apart.

441
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,555
Well, I don't need a bunch
of "blah, blah" in a book

442
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,840
to remember you anyway.

Finn, wait.

444
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:06,634
I-I need to tell you something.

445
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,569
Something I would rather
not have

446
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:09,954
written down anywhere.

447
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,289
Please, have a seat.

448
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,791
Um, when I first

449
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,244
took over the glee club,
we needed a male lead.

450

Yeah, you
were really good.

455
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,091
So I planted the pot
in your locker

456
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,809
and blackmailed you
into joining the glee club.

457
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,094
It was wrong.

I'm very sorry, Finn.

461

But I-I wanted you
to know the truth

462
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:44,555
before you left, so...

463
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,727
You are so much cooler
than I ever thought you were.

You know, you can have
that thing if you want.

00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,436
writing that letter to the Army,

475
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:17,772
or I could have wrote 50 letters
to the Army,

476
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,208
or I could have started
one of those

477
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:22,543
letter-writing campaigns,
like... like they had

478
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:24,312
<i>for Friday Night Lights
or something.</i>

479
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,847
You did everything
you could do.

480
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,749
Your dad made his choices,
and the Army has rules,

481
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:29,550
and there's nothing
you could have done

482
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:30,985
about either one
of those things.

483
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,121
I can't help feeling
like something's not right.

484
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:34,489
I did a lot
of reseah,

485
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:36,224
trying to get that
honorable discharge status,

486
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,859
and-and he did a lot

487
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,527
of really great things
in Kuwait, you know?

488
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,430
He pulled two soldiers
out of a burning truck.

489
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:43,831
He saved their lives.

490
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:45,233
They have kids now my age.

491
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,601
He's a hero.

492
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:48,903
And how is becoming an actor...

493
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:51,506
how is that redemption
for a man who did all that?

494
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,978
(sighs)

495
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:03,384
Everything seems
like it's fallen into place.

496
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,286
Everything but him.

497
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:08,122
Okay, seniors, the underclassmen

498
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,690
have something
they'd like to say to you.

499
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:11,459
Come on.

500
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:14,896
ARTIE: With all
the dedications

501
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,431
being thrown
around McKinley this week,

502
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:18,616
there was one that we wanted
to make sure didn't get missed.

503
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:19,834
Finn.

504
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,987
Right now, you're something
I never thought possible

505
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:24,288
when I first rolled
down these halls.

506
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:26,490
You're my friend-- our friend.

507
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:29,260
Even before Glee Club was
kind of cool, you had our backs.

508
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:30,495
You were on the
football team.

509
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,712
You were one
of the most

510
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,164
popular kids in school.

511
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:34,732
You had a lot to lose,

512
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,851
and people forget the
sacrifices you made.

513
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,019
We wanted to thank you.

Come on!

(bell ringing)

564
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:11,786
This freshman
just gave me a hug

565
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:13,255
and told me to never change.

566
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:14,789
Poor thing is too young
to realize

567
00:23:14,874 --> 00:23:16,124
that change can be so good.

568
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:17,459
Think...

569
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:18,927
if we hadn't changed,

570
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:20,262
we would have never been
friends.

571
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:22,380
Still so weird having you
call me a friend.

572
00:23:25,852 --> 00:23:27,352
There.
What's this?

573
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,771
A Metro North pass
from New York to New Haven.

574
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:31,940
I got one for me
into New York.

575
00:23:32,024 --> 00:23:33,942
Everybody keeps talking
about staying in touch,

576
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:36,228
and I want to make sure
that we do.

577
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,429
Thank you.

578
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:40,649
Thank you.
It's so sweet.

579
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:43,652
Although I'm still
not 100% sure

580
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:45,287
that I'm for
teen weddings,

581
00:23:45,371 --> 00:23:47,939
I'm really happy that you
and Finn are together.

582
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,607
You guys were meant to be.

583
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:50,876
Yeah.

584
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:52,160
Thank you.

585
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:53,795
You know, it's weird
'cause that's how

586
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,380
I always felt
about you and Puck.

587
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:57,299
Ancient history.

588
00:23:57,383 --> 00:23:59,501
But you know what I mean.
When you two were together,

589
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:02,053
he was really at his best.

590
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:03,454
Indian Ocean, show me.

591
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:05,590
It's no use. My brain is like a
Roach Motel,

592
00:24:05,641 --> 00:24:07,392
once the info checks in,
it never checks out.

593
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:08,760
I'm out of here.

594
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:10,562
Don't worry. You still get
your Brownie patch

595
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:12,063
for trying to help a loser
learn something.

596
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:14,733
I'm not here for a patch.
I'm here because I love you.

597
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,685
You're my first.

598
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:21,439
I kind of screwed up
that experience, huh?

599
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,691
No regrets.

600
00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:26,828
Cool. 'Cause I always felt
kind of bad about it.

601
00:24:26,913 --> 00:24:28,313
Feel bad about
a lot of things,

602
00:24:28,364 --> 00:24:30,198
but I was an ass for most
of high school.

603
00:24:30,283 --> 00:24:31,700
I really care about you, Puck.

604
00:24:31,784 --> 00:24:33,785
You know what? I know that after
Beth was born,

605
00:24:33,836 --> 00:24:35,287
we weren't really close.

606
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:37,672
But when two people go though
what we've been through,

607
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:39,090
you're bonded for life.

608
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:41,710
If you ever need me,
you know where to find me...

609
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:43,161
right here in Lima...

610
00:24:43,212 --> 00:24:44,662
repeating my senior
year forever.

611
00:24:44,714 --> 00:24:47,165
I would have never given
my virginity to this guy.

612
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:49,884
The Puck I fell in love
with had swagger.

613
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:51,970
And you know what questions
Miss Duesenberry's
gonna ask you,

614
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:53,855
so you just need
to get your confidence back

615
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,607
so you can get all
that stuff out

616
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:56,775
of the Roach Motel.

617
00:24:56,842 --> 00:24:57,842
And how am I supposed
to do that?

618
00:24:57,893 --> 00:24:59,361
Like this.

619
00:24:59,445 --> 00:25:01,029
No, no, wait.

620
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:02,731
I'm not worth it.

621
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,482
Save it for some
Yale guy

622
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:05,784
who deserves your help.

623
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:07,485
There's nobody that deserves
it more.

624
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:08,519
You just have
to remember

625
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:09,988
the guy you were
when we first met.

626
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:12,324
You're the guy who caught
the winning touchdown

627
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:15,026
the only game
the football team
won sophomore year.

628
00:25:15,077 --> 00:25:16,411
You're the guy
that ate

629
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:18,029
that shaker of pepper
on a dare.

630
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,364
Didn't even puke.

631
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:21,049
Will you let me kiss you?

632
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:24,169
I guess I'd be kind of rude

which means one
of two things:

00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:09,180
either you just returned
from the peroxide factory

652

who the celebrity father
of my unborn child is,

I'm afraid you're going

You and I are never gonna like
each other, Sue Sylvester,

669

but you and I, we got
something in common.

670
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:50,055
We both hate the fact
that this school has

671
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:52,507
an idiot for a principal.

672
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:56,644
That's why I propose we join
forces and take him down.

673
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:59,597
Well, you think that over, Sue
Sylvester, while you nurse your

thousand-year-old
vampire baby.

675
00:27:00,683 --> 00:27:02,150
You just be sure
to bottle-feed it

676
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:04,436
because that baby's gonna use
those sharp-ass teeth

677
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:07,505
to bite holes in those
saggy old boobs.

678
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:12,977
Hey, Coach.

679
00:27:13,028 --> 00:27:15,480
It's my Cheerios! uniform,
dry-cleaned and pressed.

680
00:27:15,531 --> 00:27:18,316
You were kind enough
to let me wear it again,

681
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:20,085
and I figured it was only right
to return it

682
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:21,252
in case you wanted
to pass it on.

683
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,370

Sit.

688
00:27:31,764 --> 00:27:34,549
You know, when I first
laid eyes on you, Q,

689
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:38,169
I thought you reminded me
of a young Sue Sylvester,

690
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,505
but looking at this
amazing woman

691
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:42,507
sitting across
from me right now,

692
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:44,759
I realize I was wrong.

693
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:45,794
You're nothing
like me.

694
00:27:45,861 --> 00:27:46,945
You're better.

695
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:49,481
Sure, I'm as smart
as you are

696
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:52,066
and every bit as pretty,

697
00:27:52,151 --> 00:27:54,219
but somehow you're slightly
less evil.

698
00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:57,822
And I admire that.

699
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,959
I admire you, Quinn Fabray.

700
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:02,544
I admire your perseverance.

701
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,717
You're gonna go so far, kiddo.

702
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:11,236
And I'm gonna have
the best time

703
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:12,504
watching you do it.

704
00:28:12,555 --> 00:28:14,005
And I'm gonna get to say,

"Hey, I remember her
from way back when."

706
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:18,593
Way back when she was
getting Ryan Seacrest tattoos

707
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:22,564
and lying about who
the father of her
unborn child was.

I don't see how
that's possible,

00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,808

00:33:03,472 --> 00:33:05,306
Kurt, I'm so sorry.

796
00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:09,944

826
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,054
Hi.

827
00:36:05,138 --> 00:36:06,205
Hi.
(chuckles)

828
00:36:06,256 --> 00:36:08,507
Okay, so you have
my dress and my shoes,

829
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:11,060
and I have my makeup
and my epic love for you.

830
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:13,712
Let's get married.
Okay.

831
00:36:15,983 --> 00:36:17,850
<i>RACHEL:
My dads are still being</i>

832
00:36:17,901 --> 00:36:19,218
kind of weird
about the wedding.

833
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:21,520
I brought it up last night
and they were really quiet,

834
00:36:21,572 --> 00:36:22,721
but it's fine.

835
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:24,723
Are you sure that we're
going the right way?

836
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,082
We're here.

837
00:36:34,585 --> 00:36:36,252
Are you joking?

838
00:36:36,336 --> 00:36:38,004
'Cause it's not funny.
We're gonna be late.

839
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,956
You're on the
4:25 to New York.

840
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,291
Your dads are gonna meet you
there and they're gonna,

841
00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:45,611
they're gonna help you look
at dorms at the new school.

842
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:47,546
You're gonna spend four
years of your life there

843
00:36:47,598 --> 00:36:50,132
and you've never even set
foot in the place, so...

844
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:53,970
But I... I have all year
to go and look at it.

845
00:36:54,054 --> 00:36:55,554
You're gonna go
there in the fall.

846
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:56,555
All right? You're
not deferring.

847
00:36:58,692 --> 00:36:59,809
We're not
getting married.

848
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:01,777
You don't want to marry me?

849
00:37:01,862 --> 00:37:04,780
I want to marry you so badly
I can't go through with it.

850
00:37:04,865 --> 00:37:07,533
Yeah, but the thought
of you being stuck here

851
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,702
for another year because
of me, it makes me sick.

852
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,104
Then come with me. Okay?

853
00:37:12,155 --> 00:37:13,739
We can get married
in New York

854
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,908
and live in a little
shoebox apartment together.

855
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:16,909
It'll be romantic.

856
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,827
Do you love me?

857
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:19,412
Of course I do.

858
00:37:19,463 --> 00:37:20,630
Then tell me the
truth and not just

859
00:37:20,714 --> 00:37:21,914
something you think
I want to hear.

860
00:37:21,965 --> 00:37:24,417
Are you 100% sure
you want to marry me?

861
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:27,586
N-No-no one is
100% sure of anything.

862
00:37:27,638 --> 00:37:29,689
I am.

863
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:32,925
I am that sure you're
something special.

864
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:35,061
That this is just the
beginning for you.

865
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,929
Okay? Th-That you're
gonna do amazing things.

866
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,314
But to get there,

867
00:37:38,398 --> 00:37:39,899
you got to have these
experiences on your own...

868
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,851
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Listen to me.

869
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:43,486
You got to have these
experiences on your own.
Wait a minute.

870
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,654
I can't have to be
there with you.

871
00:37:44,738 --> 00:37:46,572
Wait a minute.
Are you breaking up with me?

872
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,773
I'm setting you free.

873
00:37:47,824 --> 00:37:49,075
Oh, my God.

874
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:52,144
Look, d-do you know how
hard this is for me?

875
00:37:52,195 --> 00:37:53,412
How many times I've
cried about this?

876
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,747
No, I'm not going.

877
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,615
I'm not going,
not without you.

878
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,084
You don't have a choice;
I can't come with you.

879
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,618
Well, then I'll stay here!

880
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,420
I'll go wherever it is
that you're going!

881
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,955
Fort Benning, Georgia?

882
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:09,545
Look, I-I need a chance to try
and redeem my father, okay?

883
00:38:09,629 --> 00:38:10,846
I-I...
Oh, my God!

884
00:38:10,931 --> 00:38:12,715
Oh, my God,
wait a minute.

885
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:14,717
You're joining the Army?

886
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:16,185
Are you insane?

887
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:18,888
(sobbing): I can't believe that
this is happening right now.

888
00:38:18,972 --> 00:38:21,390
It's also one of the places I
knew you couldn't follow me.

889
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:23,976
Look, you're-you're
gonna get on that train.

890
00:38:24,027 --> 00:38:25,111
Okay?

891
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,346
And you're gonna
go to New York,

892
00:38:27,397 --> 00:38:29,532
and you're
gonna be a star.

893
00:38:29,616 --> 00:38:30,616
Without me.

894
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,017
That's how much
I love you.

895
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:33,786
(sniffles)

896
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,572
You know what
we're gonna do?

897
00:38:36,656 --> 00:38:37,823
Surrender.

898
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:41,293
I know how hard
that is for you

899
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,546
because of how hard
you hold on to stuff.

900
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,582
But-but we're just gonna,
we're gonna sit here

901
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:48,384
and we're just
gonna let go.

902
00:38:48,468 --> 00:38:50,803
Okay, and-and let the
universe do it's thing.

903
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,390
And if we're meant
to be together,

904
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:55,925
then we're gonna
be together.

905
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:58,210
W-Whether it's in a little
shoebox apartment in New York

906
00:38:58,261 --> 00:39:00,730
or on the other
side of the world.

907
00:39:00,814 --> 00:39:02,515
Okay?

908
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:03,649
(sobbing)

909
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,934
Will you do
that with me?

910
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:05,884
Will you surrender?

911
00:39:16,196 --> 00:39:18,614
I love you so much.

912
00:39:18,698 --> 00:39:19,949
I love you.
