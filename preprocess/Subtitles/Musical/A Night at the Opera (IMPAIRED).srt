You hear that? Someday, Riccardo,
you're gonna be where Lassparri is.

153
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,473
When you were six years old,
you sing better than Lassparri.

154
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,790
Maybe I was better at six than I am now.

155
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,757
You make me sick. You crazy.

156
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,434
You sing better than he ever could sing
and you know it.

157
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,273
I know it and you know it,
but the public doesn't know it.

158
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,430
-All right. We tell the public.
-How?

159
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,192
What you need is a manager.

160
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,238
A wise guy, somebody who's very smart.

161
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,553
-I know just the man for you.
-You do? Who is it?

162
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,675
Me!

163
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,078
-But you wouldn't make any money at it.
-I'll break even.

Just as long as I no lose nothing.

-ls the opera over yet?
-Not yet, signore, in a few minutes.

166
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,077
I told you to slow that nag down.

167
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,310
On account of you,
I nearly heard the opera.

168
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,915
Once around the park, and drive slowly.
And none of your back talk.

You're still crazy about her?

And she's crazy about you, too?

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,434
Even if she was,
I couldn't ask her to marry me.

173
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,478
Don't worry.
The manager, he'll fix everything.

174
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,398
Anyhow, we're together again...

-you and me, just like old times.
-Yeah, like old times.

Mrs. Claypool...

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,119
Mr. Driftwood seems hardly the person
to handle your business affairs.

180
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,033
-I'm beginning to think the same thing.
-Bravo!

181
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,270
I made it.
How soon does the curtain go up?

182
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,113
The curtain, Mr. Driftwood,
will go up again next season.

183
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,079
-You've missed the entire opera.
-I only missed it by a few minutes.

184
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,839
I can go then?

185
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,708
Was I right? Isn't Lassparri
the greatest tenor that ever lived?

186
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,598
He's superb.
But what would you have to pay him?

187
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,954
What's the difference?

188
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,679
He must sail with us tomorrow
no matter what we pay.

189
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,479
-He would be worth $1,000 a night.
-How much?

190
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,955
-What does he do?
-What does he do, he sings.

191
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,793
You're willing to pay him
$1,000 a night just for singing?

192
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,350
You can get a phonograph record
of Minnie the Moocher for 75 cents.

193
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,908
For $1.25, you can get Minnie.

If you'll excuse me, Mrs. Claypool...

195
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,038
I think I had better arrange
to see Lassparri immediately.

196
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,873
-You are agreed, $1,000 a night?
-Just as you think.

197
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,599
$1,000. There must be some way
I can get a piece of this.

198
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,150
Wait. Why don't I sign Lassparri?
I represent Mrs. Claypool.

199
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,515
But I represent
the New York Opera Company.

How would you like
to have supper with us?

I'm terribly sorry, Signor Lassparri,
I already have an engagement.

I see.

That's too bad, because I have an idea...

210
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,273
he's going to invite me
to sing in New York.

211
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,314
And he may permit me
to select my leading lady.

you can't break your appointment?

-He sends $5 home to his mother.
-That leaves $3.

Like a prince.

261
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,031
Of course, he won't be able to eat,
but he can live like a prince.

262
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,396
However, out of that $3,
he'll have to pay an income tax.

263
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,275
Yes, there's a federal tax, a state tax,
and a city tax...

a street tax, and a sewer tax.

How much does this come to?

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,318

he can break even.

and you sign at the bottom.

-Sure, those five kids up in Canada.

-I haven't said anything worth hearing.

That's why I didn't hear anything.

-I can read, but I can't see it.

Here we are. Now I've got it.

287
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,392
Pay particular attention to this first clause
because it's most important.

288
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,950
It says, "The party of the first part
shall be known in this contract...

or just the porthole?

-I'm sure you'll find it cozy, sir.
-Cozy is hardly the word.

Anything else, sir?

455
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,314
Yes. Tomorrow you can take the trunk out
and I'll go in.

-Hello.

00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,191
This makes it a perfect voyage.

460
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,636
-I'm sorry. I thought this was my trunk.
-lt is your trunk.

461
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,233
I don't remember packing you boys.

Remember Riccardo Baroni,
the greatest tenor in the world?

You nearly signed him up once.

464
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,835
Sure. I just delivered a letter for you.
How are you?

465
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,514
-Good. Just a little cramped.
-We're still in the harbor.

466
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,512
As soon as we get out in the ocean,
there'll be plenty of room.

467
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,273
-lsn't that my shirt?
-I don't know. I found it in the trunk.

468
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,749
Then it couldn't be mine.
It's nice seeing you again.

469
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,195
But I was expecting my other suit.
Did you see it?

470
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,510
Yeah. Took up too much room,
so we sold it.

471
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,830
-Did you get anything for it?
-$1.40.

472
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,993
That's my suit, all right. Say, it's lucky
I left another shirt in this drawer.

as I've ever seen.

I wish you fellows
would explain this thing to me.

480

It's very simple.
You see, Riccardo, he's in love with Rosa.

481

We want to go to New York, too.

482

But we got no money,
so we hide in the trunk.

Without money,
what'll you do in New York?

484
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,910
I can sing. There must be
some place for me to work.

485
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,275
Besides, I can be near Rosa.
That's the main thing.

You won't give us away, will you?

487
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,270
No, but you fellows
have got to get out of here.

488

in a few minutes...

if you had him stuffed?

-He's no olive.
-I'll go and get the steward.

or am I in the trunk?

Mr. Claypool went to his reward
three years ago.

605
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,275
-And left you all alone.
-All alone.

606

Gottlieb, you're just wasting your time.

609
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,592
If Mrs. Claypool wants to marry
a fortune hunter, she's got me.

610
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,829
Fortune hunter?

611
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,275
In fact, you can't call me a fortune hunter.

612
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,432
Because when I proposed to her,
I thought she only had $7 million.

613
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,478
But the extra million never interfered
with my feelings for her.

614
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,152
If you had any real feeling for me...

615
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,993
you'd stop associating
with the riffraff I've seen you with.

616
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,149
You mean Gottlieb?

617
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,630
I mean those two uncouth men
I saw you around the opera house with.

618
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,870
I'm grateful they're not on board the boat.

-Why, have they slipped off?
-Sit down.

Come on, we find something to eat.

621
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,714
You think it's safe?
If they catch us, they'll deport us.

622
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,268
What will we lose?
If we're deported, they'll feed us.

623

that I'm the world's greatest singer?

-But I love to hear you sing, Rodolfo.
-No.

626
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,591
Let me put it this way. I love you.

627
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,671
I adore you. I would die for you.

628

it means he loves you.

631
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,913
Personally, I don't believe
either statement.

The only tenor I could ever stand
was a fellow by the name...

635
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,552
of Riccardo Baroni.

-Ever hear of him?
-Riccardo.

637

I wonder where he is right now.

638
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,198
Probably roaming
over the countryside someplace.

639
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,717
Riccardo always loved the open.
He never could stand being cooped up.

640

He still doesn't like it.

maybe 3 feet...

we run out of gasoline again.

Now we're getting somewhere.

1070
01:18:58,987 --> 01:19:01,217
I will not sing unless

Herr Gottlieb! Lassparri, he's disappeared.

What?

-You are Baroni.
-That's who I am.

-What?
-I want you to sing.

01:22:30,347 --> 01:22:33,066
But I have no reputation, Mr. Gottlieb.

1087
01:22:33,147 --> 01:22:36,025
Besides, I couldn't sing
with a strange Leonora.

1088
01:22:36,107 --> 01:22:38,496
I've been rehearsing with Miss Castaldi.

-That's it exactly.
