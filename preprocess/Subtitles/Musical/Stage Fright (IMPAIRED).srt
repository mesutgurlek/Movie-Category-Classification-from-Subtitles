himself as Alfonso.

Uh, for those of you wondering,
yes, I will be playing Alfonso.

183
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,736
- Yep.
- It's probably 'cause he
wants you to play Opera Ghost.

184
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,739
- Or 'cause he wants
to make out with me again.
- ...which is the very essence

Congrats.

Thanks.

313
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:34,465
So, I guess now you owe me one.

314
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:37,902
Yeah.

315
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:39,403
Yeah.

316
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:41,772
<i>Welcome to</i>

Limelight!
(APPLAUSE)

318
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,877
For those of you who are new,

319
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,213
I'm your stage manager,
David Martin.

320
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,316
I'm here to make sure that
the show goes on no matter what,

321
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:53,751
and I will do

322
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:56,053
whatever it takes.

323
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,289
Well, except go on stage -
I don't do that.

324
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,692
Hello, stage fright.
(LAUGHING)

325
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:06,130
But backstage, make no mistake: I run
the space and you will feel my wrath.

326
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,132
J/K, I love you guys.

327
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:11,268
- Oh, my god!
- But there is a process,

328
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,238
and without further ado,
Herr Director.

329
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
(APPLAUSE)
Woo!

330
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,576
Woo!

331
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:21,345
What is at the heart of<i> Haunting?</i>

332
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:27,184
- A love thtory about...
- It's about covering.

333
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:30,554
Covering up who you really are.

334
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:33,257
And isn't that the scariest

335
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,527
thing of all? That's why I'm
going to reinvent this entire

336
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:38,963
production and cover it

337
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,699
with a postmodern face.
Now, who can tell me...

338
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:45,235
what Japanese tradition
involves covering...

339
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:48,472
your face all in white?

340
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:51,976
Bukkake.

341
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:53,777
Kabuki?

342
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:59,216
And that is why my version
of Opera Ghost will wear

343
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,218
not just any mask,

344
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,253
but a kabuki mask.

345
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,155
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

346
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,491
the new face of<i> Opera Ghost.</i>
Whitney?

347

(APPLAUSE)

348
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:25,142
OK, everybody. That's it.
Remember: off-book by Thursday.

349
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,511
Camilla, do you have a second?

350
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:29,580
I want to show you something.

351
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,473
Have a seat.

352
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:59,943
That was some performance
yesterday.

353
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,847
I'm just curious...

354
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,251
do you already know
who's gonna do which show?

355
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:09,253
The Broadway agents come on...

356
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,555
opening night, right?

357
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,059
Tension.

358
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,464
And release.

What?

361
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:40,384
Nothing.

362
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,822
Well, we have to kiss
in the show, right?

363
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:46,924
Yeah.

364
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:51,195
I don't want to take away
from the magic of the moment.

365
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,542
So, are you gonna tell me
who gets to go up opening night?

366
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:08,679
I'm just curious about the process.

didn't have what it takes to be the lead.

if I go back to my bunk now?

singing her songs,

535

"Maybe this is what I'm
supposed to do".

hadn't been killed that night,

this whole thing is not for me.

595
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:14,423

He did.

599
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:23,032
he'd seen you transform
on that stage

600

if you go in

614
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:16,018

you probably felt OK.

That's why

634
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:26,956
theatre has been around so long.

635
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:31,560
That's why we need musical songs.

Come on.

all the way to the curtain call,
got it?

699

00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:18,580
Joel?

703
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:26,422

how to be your best, so:

throat coat. Performers' secret.

705
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:32,361
Before all your big solos,
for sure.

706
00:55:32,363 --> 00:55:36,832
Honey. Just eat
the whole thing. Mmm.

707
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:39,902
Hey! You can't do the show tonight.

708
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:43,005
Get out, Joel, we're warming up.

to listen to me OK?

711
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:50,179
There is a killer at this camp.

712
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:54,416
- Zeeeaaaayyyyy, ahhhh...
- Would you shut up?!

713

You're not listening.

Artie was killed.

Get out, Joel.

716
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:05,327
Warming up is, like,
really important!

717
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:14,670
Now, my vocal coach taught me
this trick.

718
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:16,805
You steam up the whole room,

719
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:20,809
and then you can come in here at
any point in the show and just,
like, moisten your vocal cords.

Is anyone using these things?

It's good as new. OK,

727
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:47,603
you can't be here during the show.

728
00:56:47,605 --> 00:56:49,605
I have a quick-change
and I need this area clear.

729
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:55,544
So, just do your janitor thing
somewhere else, all right?

730
00:56:55,546 --> 00:56:57,613
OK, you're being really creepy.

731
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:32,247
So... haven't heard
from you in a while.

732
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:34,316
What's been happening at camp
this summer?
