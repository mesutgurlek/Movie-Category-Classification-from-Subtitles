00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:56,605
-[ Ophelia ] Good night, Charlie.
- Uh, good night.

465
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,869
- You know, Ophelia, you look so sweet.
- Ah, what'd you say ?

466
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:02,103
- I say, I think you look so sweet.
- Yes ?

467
00:40:02,178 --> 00:40:05,443
- I'm going to kiss you good night.
- Oh, help, help, help !

468
00:40:05,515 --> 00:40:07,506
Help, he--

469
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:10,279
[ Giggles ]
Isn't that a wonderful trick ?

470
00:40:10,353 --> 00:40:13,982
Yes, it is. Yes. I wish I could
enjoy my first childhood...

471
00:40:14,056 --> 00:40:16,786
as much as he does his second.
[ Laughs ]

472
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:20,886
Now, Luana, how would you like another
piece of cake or some ice cream ?

473
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:23,989
- No, thank you. I'm full up.
- Some candy ?

474
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:28,435
- Care for a cigar ?
- Me ? [ Laughs ]

475
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:30,472
How about you,
Mortimer ?

476
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,976
- Mortimer?
- Uh... I don't smoke.

477
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:36,876
I don't mean that.
Well, what shall we do now ?

478
00:40:36,946 --> 00:40:39,779
- Any suggestions ?
- How would you like to go down
to the city dump...

479
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:42,283
- and watch me slug rats ?
- Certainly not.

480
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:44,785
- No ?
- How would you like to
hear me tell a story ?

481
00:40:44,854 --> 00:40:47,414
Oh, I'd love it.
Wouldn't you, Charlie ?

482
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:51,620
Well, I, uh...
y-y-yeah... no.

483
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:53,719
This is a story that
everyone should know.

484
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:56,993
Yes, but not everyone should tell it.
And you know who.

485
00:40:57,066 --> 00:41:00,092
Well, I'm going to tell it anyway.
Now, many, many years ago--

486
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:02,103
I think I'll run out
and wind a sundial.

487
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:04,139
- You'll stay right here.
- Yes, sir.

488
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:07,142
[ Bergen ] Once upon a time,
long, long ago--

489
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:10,008
Funny, nothing ever
happens nowadays.

490
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,309
There was a place
called Happy Valley.

491
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:14,315
Now, it was called
Happy Valley...

492
00:41:14,383 --> 00:41:18,046
because everyone
who lived there was happy.

493
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,853
- No ! Well, there's a hunk
of logic for you.
- Are you listening, Mortimer ?

494
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:27,294
- Uh, Happy Valley ?
- That's right,yes.

495
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:31,231
Now just try and imagine it. Can't
you just close your eyes and see it ?

496
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,736
Well, I can't see very good
with my eyes closed.

497
00:41:34,804 --> 00:41:36,738
My eyelids
get in the way.

498
00:41:36,806 --> 00:41:40,333
- You create a picture
in your mind's eye.
- Oh.

499
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:44,709
- That's not easy for him.
His mind gets in the way.
- [ Laughs ]

500
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,340
- Now try and paint a mental picture.
- Yeah.

501
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:50,283
I-- I painted a barn
once, I did.

502
00:41:50,353 --> 00:41:52,287
- Well, that's very interesting.
- Yeah.

503
00:41:52,355 --> 00:41:56,018
- It was-- It was a red barn.
It was. Yeah.
- Well, forget the barn.

504
00:41:56,092 --> 00:41:58,287
- Yeah.
- And try and picture Happy Valley.

505
00:41:58,361 --> 00:42:00,989
- Well, I'll-- I'll work on it.
- That's the spirit.

506
00:42:01,063 --> 00:42:03,258
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll work on it.

507
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:05,698
Let's see, uh--
Let's see, now.

508
00:42:05,768 --> 00:42:09,602
It's, uh-- Oh, let's say
it's about, uh--

509
00:42:09,672 --> 00:42:11,606
Uh, what was
the question ?

510
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:14,336
-Happy Valley.
-Oh, yeah ! Yeah. That's right. Yeah.

511
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,243
- Let's see, uh--
- Think hard !

512
00:42:17,313 --> 00:42:20,077
Yeah.
[ Grunts ]

513
00:42:20,149 --> 00:42:22,947

Oh, I'm tired.
All that work for nothin'.

516
00:42:30,826 --> 00:42:33,488
- Can I try ?
-[ Bergen ] Certainly.

517
00:42:34,997 --> 00:42:38,626
Yes. I think I can
see it, Mr. Bergen.

518
00:42:38,701 --> 00:42:40,965
It's beautiful.

519
00:42:41,037 --> 00:42:44,006
[ Bergen ] Yes, it was one of
nature's garden spots,

520
00:42:44,073 --> 00:42:47,201
nestled among the green,
rolling hills.

521
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:50,109
Can't you see the lovely brook
as it flows through the valley?

522
00:42:50,179 --> 00:42:52,704
[ Mortimer ] Mmm. Yeah,yeah,yeah.

523
00:42:52,782 --> 00:42:56,218
[ Bergen ] The winding roads,
lined with stately trees.

524
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:58,219
[ Mortimer ] Trees. Yeah.

525
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:01,654
[ Bergen ] Lush fields and prosperous
farms dot the landscape.

526
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:03,658
[ Mortimer ] L-Landscape. Yeah.

527
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:06,058
[ Bergen ] And high on a hilltop
overlooking the valley,

528
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:09,359
-shining like a jewel, stands--
-[ Mortimer ] My red barn.

529
00:43:09,432 --> 00:43:11,900
[ Bergen ] No, no.
It was something much nicer.

530
00:43:11,968 --> 00:43:15,335
- It was a majestic castle!
-[ Luana ] Oh, that's pretty.

531
00:43:15,671 --> 00:43:18,731
[ Bergen ] And something very precious
is kept within these castle walls.

- * My *
-[ Luana ] What is it ?

533
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,439

singing harp. Listen.

[ All Laughing ]

560
00:44:36,919 --> 00:44:39,114
[ Bergen ] Yes, the voice
of this golden harp...

561
00:44:39,188 --> 00:44:42,453
cast a magic spell ofjoy
and prosperity over the valley.

562
00:44:42,525 --> 00:44:46,052
- But it was too good to last...
-[ Charlie ] I knew
there was a catch in it.

563
00:44:46,128 --> 00:44:48,323
- for one day--
-[ Charlie ] They built a schoolhouse.

564
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:52,483
[ Bergen ] No, no. One day a
mysterious shadow crept over the valley.

565
00:44:53,684 --> 00:44:56,084
And then something dreadful
happened!

566
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:59,088
[ Thunder Rolling, Lightning Crashing ]

567
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:03,487
Aaaaaah !

568
00:45:03,561 --> 00:45:05,529
[ Luana ] What happened?

569
00:45:05,596 --> 00:45:09,464
[ Bergen ] When the shadow lifted,
the golden harp was gone.

570
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:13,333
No longer was the valley happy,
for without the magic of the harp,

571
00:45:13,404 --> 00:45:17,670
all was misery,
misery, misery.

572
00:45:17,742 --> 00:45:19,903
[ Charlie ] Just like the eighth grade.

573
00:45:19,977 --> 00:45:21,945
[ Bergen ] Desolation
spread over the land.

574
00:45:22,012 --> 00:45:24,207
Everything was drying up.

-[ Mortimer ] Dry rot.
-[ Charlie ] Yes, isn't it ?

00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:28,618
-[ Bergen ] Charlie.
-[ Charlie ] Yes, sir.

577
00:45:28,686 --> 00:45:32,178
[ Bergen ] The fields of golden corn
turned to dust.

[ Charlie ] Kerplop.

579
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:37,250
[ Bergen ] The laughing brook
flowed no more.

580
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:44,559
To think that this
was once Happy Valley!

581
00:45:44,635 --> 00:45:46,569
[ Charlie ] Now it's Gruesome Gulch.

582
00:45:46,637 --> 00:45:49,606
[ Bergen ] Days pass, weeks pass.

583
00:45:49,673 --> 00:45:52,369
[ Charlie ] I pass. New deal.

584
00:45:52,443 --> 00:45:55,173
[ Luana ] What happened
to all the people ?

585
00:45:55,246 --> 00:45:57,646
[ Bergen ] Well, suppose we look in
on these humble peasants.

586
00:45:57,715 --> 00:46:00,980
-[ Mortimer ] Is that a peasant ?
-[ Charlie ] That's a cow, stupid.

587
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:03,178
[ Luana ] Well, at least they had milk.

588
00:46:03,254 --> 00:46:05,779
[ Bergen ] Well, she used to be
a good milker. But now--

589
00:46:05,856 --> 00:46:08,689
[ Charlie ] She's an udder failure.

590
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:12,320
[ Bergen ] She was the bosom friend
of a once-proud family.

00:46:12,396 --> 00:46:14,887
[ Charlie ] Well, they're certainly
out of the high rent district.

[ Hinge Squeaking ]

593

00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:24,000
three poor farmers, gripped
by the pangs of starvation.

595

Still alive, still breathing,

596
00:46:26,744 --> 00:46:29,338
sharing a pitiful crust
between them.

597
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:32,678
Share and share alike.

598
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:37,016
Sharing and staring.
Staring and sharing.

599
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:39,351
[ Charlie ] Uh,just tell it,
don't ham it.

600
00:46:39,423 --> 00:46:41,721
[ Bergen ] But are
their spirits broken ?

601
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:43,783
Have they lost hope ?

602
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:48,696
Yes. Men facing famine,
naught left but beans.

603
00:46:48,766 --> 00:46:51,963
[ Charlie ] Ahem. Bean,you mean.

604
00:46:52,036 --> 00:46:54,732
[ Bergen ] If it were one man
and three beans--

605
00:46:54,805 --> 00:46:59,003
But, no. One bean
and three men.

606
00:46:59,076 --> 00:47:01,977
[ Charlie ] Well, at least
there are no bones in it.

607
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:04,478
[ Bergen ] Just look at that
miserable creature,

608
00:47:04,548 --> 00:47:07,244
doggedly struggling
to maintain life,

609
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:10,947
a gaunt, lean bag
of bones and feathers.

610
00:47:11,021 --> 00:47:14,286
Truly a picture
of despair.

611
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:17,555
But Donald
doesn't whimper.

612
00:47:17,628 --> 00:47:20,620
- Donald doesn't give up.
- Shut up !

00:47:20,698 --> 00:47:23,166
I can't stand it !
[ Squawking ]

00:47:25,736 --> 00:47:27,670
[ Mickey Shouting ]

615
00:47:27,738 --> 00:47:30,798
[ Goofy ] Easy, Donald. Easy!

[ All Shouting At Once ]

617
00:47:34,345 --> 00:47:37,143
There. There, now.
There. Easy, Donald.

618
00:47:37,214 --> 00:47:39,580
I-- I'll be all right.

619
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,448
Yeah. I'll be all right.
[ Panting ]

620
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:44,578
I'll be all right.

621
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:53,959
[ Bergen ] He says he's all right,
but I wonder.

622
00:47:54,031 --> 00:47:56,431
He's suffered too much.

623
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,799
What diabolical thought
is being hatched in the fevered brain...

624
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,430
of this poor, demented duck ?

625
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:07,436
Donald !
No ! No !

626
00:48:09,513 --> 00:48:11,981
Nice bossy, bossy.

627
00:48:12,049 --> 00:48:14,244
[ Laughs ]

628
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:17,913
- Nice old cowsy wowsy.
- Donald !

- [ Mickey ] Donald! No, Donald!
- [ Mooing ]

631
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:29,230
[ Squawking ]
Give it here ! Let me--

632
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,234
[ Donald Choking ]

633
00:48:31,302 --> 00:48:35,796
[ Muttering, Panting ]
I just gotta eat.

634
00:48:35,873 --> 00:48:37,807
I'm so... hungry.

635
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:39,900
[ Bergen ] The little fellow
was completely out of his head.

636
00:48:39,977 --> 00:48:42,411
-Cut it out, will ya ? I get the idea !
-He was a pitiful sight.

637
00:48:42,479 --> 00:48:45,004
- Weeks without food.
- [ Choking, Moaning ]

638
00:48:45,082 --> 00:48:47,312
- Poor Donald.
- Yeah, poor me !

639
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:49,545
It was all they could
do to restrain him.

640
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,487
- You see, he had just about reached
the end of his rope.
- Yeah.

641
00:48:52,556 --> 00:48:55,389
Oh, it was a sorry
predicament indeed.

642
00:48:55,459 --> 00:48:57,950
What to do ?
What to do ?

643
00:48:58,028 --> 00:49:01,293
Well, Donald may be nuts,
but he's got the right idea.

644
00:49:01,365 --> 00:49:05,859
- Kill the cow.
- Oh, no, Charlie !
The cow was their best friend.

645
00:49:05,936 --> 00:49:09,428
Well, a friend in need
is a friend indeed.

646
00:49:09,506 --> 00:49:12,031
- So what ?
- So, they need some steak.

647
00:49:12,109 --> 00:49:15,078
No ! If you're
gonna kill the cow,

648
00:49:15,145 --> 00:49:18,410
I don't wanna hear
the rest of the story.

649

Well, she wouldn't
have to know.

650
00:49:20,651 --> 00:49:22,585
They could sneak up on her
and surprise her.

651
00:49:22,653 --> 00:49:26,248
- Yeah, that's what we'll do.
We'll kill the cow.
- Oh, no, Charlie. You mustn't.

652
00:49:26,323 --> 00:49:28,723
We'll get a stranglehold
on her while she's asleep.

653
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:33,354
- a-a-and then push her off the cliff.
- Oh, no !

654
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,830
I ain't a-gonna listen
to the story.

655
00:49:35,899 --> 00:49:39,027
[ Charlie ] Well, it'll be your fault
if they starve to death.

656
00:49:39,103 --> 00:49:42,197
- [ Luana ]
Why don't they sell the cow?
- That's just what they did.

657
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:45,708
Well, why didn't you say so in the first
place, and save a lot of time ?

658
00:49:45,776 --> 00:49:49,143
I could save a lot of time by not
telling the story at all !

659
00:49:49,213 --> 00:49:52,148
Your idea is not
without merit.

660
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:55,551
Well, back to the scene
of desolation.

661
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,712
Things are beginning
to look much brighter now,

662
00:49:57,788 --> 00:50:01,815
because as Mickey goes
to the village to sell the cow,
the thought of prosperity...

663
00:50:01,892 --> 00:50:04,690
brings new hope
to the famished farmers.

664
00:50:04,762 --> 00:50:08,254
Even Donald has fully recovered,
for soon their long-empty plates...

665
00:50:08,332 --> 00:50:10,266
will overflow with food.

- Beans !
- What d'you mean, beans ?

677
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,964
Yeah, fellows. I sold the cow
for some magic beans !

678
00:50:46,036 --> 00:50:50,370
Beans !
[ Squawking ]

679
00:50:50,441 --> 00:50:52,466
[ Mickey ] But Donald!

680
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:56,138
These are not ordinary beans!
They're magic beans!

681
00:50:56,213 --> 00:51:00,149
If you plant these beans
in the light of a full moon,
do you know what'll happen ?

682
00:51:00,217 --> 00:51:03,380
Yes ! We get more beans !
[ Squawking ]

683
00:51:03,454 --> 00:51:07,515
- No, no, Donald !
- [ Donald ] Magic beans! Phooey!

684
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:10,726
[ Bergen ] Poor Mickey,

685
00:51:10,794 --> 00:51:13,820
cheated into trading his cow
for a handful of beans.

686
00:51:13,897 --> 00:51:16,627
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
What a mean trick!

687
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,033
Swindling an innocent farmer
out of all he owned...

688
00:51:20,104 --> 00:51:23,870
and lying to him, telling him
that the beans were magic.

689
00:51:25,008 --> 00:51:27,875
Planted in the light
of a full moon!

690
00:51:27,945 --> 00:51:31,472
What a shame to deceive
a simple little peasant.

691
00:51:31,548 --> 00:51:33,982
Magic beans, indeed!

692
00:51:34,051 --> 00:51:36,611
- Light of a full moon.
-[ Charlie ] Bergen ? Oh, Bergen!

693
00:51:36,687 --> 00:51:39,178
-[ Bergen ] What ?
-[ Luana ] There's something moving.

694
00:51:39,256 --> 00:51:43,386
[ Bergen ] Why,yes. Well, maybe
there is some magic in them !

695
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,520
All right, now let's all keep quiet
and see what happens.

696
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,317
[ Snoring ]

697
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:18,302
[ Snoring ]

698
00:52:24,876 --> 00:52:26,810
Mmm.

699
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,853
[ Giggles ]

700
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:03,406
[ Bergen ] And all
through the night, it grew,

701
00:54:03,475 --> 00:54:05,568
onward and upward.

702
00:54:05,644 --> 00:54:08,442
[ Charlie ] That thing
is a menace to aviation.

703
00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:12,683
[ Bergen ] And so,
with the coming of dawn,

704
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:16,118
we find the bewildered farmers
staring at a mammoth castle,

705
00:54:16,188 --> 00:54:18,122
miles above the earth.

706
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:21,819
Their curiosity was aroused,:
nothing could hold them back.

707
00:54:21,893 --> 00:54:24,953
Who lives there ?
Man or monster?

708
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:27,965
Friend or foe ?
Aprincess or a dragon ?

709
00:54:28,033 --> 00:54:29,967
[ Mortimer ] Well, search me.

710
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:33,095
[ Bergen ] What drew them toward
this place of mystery?

711
00:54:33,171 --> 00:54:35,298
Hunger? Desperation ?

712
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:37,842
Or perhaps it was
love of adventure.

713
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:41,208
What a fantastic experience,:
perhaps mortal man...

714
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:44,510
has never before set foot
on this strange land.

715
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:48,781
-[ Charlie ] Well, somebody did.
-[ Mortimer ] Oh, gosh!
Who made them ?

716
00:54:48,854 --> 00:54:51,880
[ Charlie ] Well, it wasn't Cinderella.

717
00:54:51,957 --> 00:54:55,723
[ Bergen ] Soon they reached
the moat surrounding the castle.

718
00:54:55,794 --> 00:55:00,731
But this didn't stop them. On they went,
as if drawn by some irresistible force.

719
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:04,326
And then, suddenly, without warning,
out of the sky above--

720
00:55:04,403 --> 00:55:06,462
- [ Dragonflies Droning ]
-[ Luana ] Ooh, dragonflies!

721
00:55:06,538 --> 00:55:10,736
[ Charlie ] Yeah. A-flyin'front
and draggin'behind.

722
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:15,178
- Gee, what whoppers !
- Yeah. Bombers !

724
00:55:30,262 --> 00:55:34,028
Come back and fight !

725
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,215

726
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:58,214
[ All Screaming ]

727
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,698
[ Bergen ] Finally,
they reached the castle.

728
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,034
[ Charlie ] The hard way.

729
00:56:14,773 --> 00:56:17,207
[ Bergen ] This was the biggest
adventure of their lives.

730
00:56:17,275 --> 00:56:21,075
Forgotten was their hunger,:
forgotten was their fear.

731
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:24,172
It took courage to scale
these massive steps,

732
00:56:24,249 --> 00:56:27,082
to make this journey
into the unknown.

733
00:56:27,152 --> 00:56:30,246
But these stouthearted lads
never faltered.

734
00:56:30,322 --> 00:56:32,722
Three minds with
but a single thought.:

735
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:36,454
What mystery lurked within those
cold, forbidding walls ?

736
00:56:36,528 --> 00:56:39,964
What strange spell hovered
over this gloomy place ?

737
00:56:42,934 --> 00:56:44,868
Will no one answer?

738
00:56:44,936 --> 00:56:48,064
Are they walking into a trap ?
Do they go in ?

739
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:51,370
[ Charlie ] You know,you could
stand some rehearsal on this story.

740
00:56:51,443 --> 00:56:55,072
[ Bergen ] Inside, the tremendous hall
was as silent as a tomb.

741
00:56:55,146 --> 00:56:57,944
Not a sign of life
anywhere.

742
00:56:58,016 --> 00:56:59,950
[ Charlie ] Caught with his pants--

743
00:57:00,018 --> 00:57:01,952
-[ Bergen ] Charlie!
-[ Charlie ] Caught with his pants--

744
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,750
-[ Bergen ] Charlie!
-[ Charlie ]
Well, his slip was showing.

745
00:57:04,823 --> 00:57:06,757
[ Bergen ] They gazed
in speechless wonder,

746
00:57:06,825 --> 00:57:08,759
almost afraid to breathe.

747
00:57:08,827 --> 00:57:11,295
Suddenly they looked up.
What was it ?

748
00:57:11,363 --> 00:57:14,264
[ Donald ] Food!
Yum,yum,yum,yum ! Let me at it!

00:58:32,844 --> 00:58:35,369
Oh ! Who's there ?

- [ Mickey ] That's the harp!
- [ Donald ] Boy, oh, boy!

- Bigger than 40 men.
- Oh, no !

00:58:53,031 --> 00:58:57,229
An ogre who had the power to turn
himself into anything, man or beast.

757
00:58:57,302 --> 00:58:59,236
That calls
for a drink.

[ Hiccups ]

759
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:06,473
It was this heartless monster that
swooped down under cover of darkness,

01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:21,594
- Here he comes with the key !
- Let me have it, Mickey !

917
01:08:21,662 --> 01:08:24,256
[ Snoring Continues ]

918
01:08:24,332 --> 01:08:27,324
[ Bergen ] Well, it looks like
success at last.

919
01:08:27,401 --> 01:08:29,926
Free from the clutches
of that terrible monster.

920
01:08:30,004 --> 01:08:34,464
And now to find the beanstalk, climb
down and return home in triumph,

921
01:08:34,542 --> 01:08:36,942
with a big surprise
for Happy Valley.

922
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:39,946
But wait. Mickey's
going to make doubly sure.

923
01:08:40,014 --> 01:08:42,608
He's taking no chances.

924
01:08:42,683 --> 01:08:46,119
Just in case the giant
might wake up.

925
01:08:47,421 --> 01:08:49,548
[ Luana ] Oh!

926
01:08:49,624 --> 01:08:52,024
[ Charlie ] Ha. Should have
left well enough alone.

927
01:08:58,866 --> 01:09:01,198
Come back here!
Come back here!

928
01:09:31,465 --> 01:09:33,399
[ Whistles ]

929
01:09:57,925 --> 01:10:00,416
[ Squawking ]

930
01:10:05,666 --> 01:10:07,930
[ Bergen ] And there goes the giant!

931
01:10:08,002 --> 01:10:09,765
[ Yelping ]

932
01:10:09,837 --> 01:10:13,398
He's helpless now,
tumbling over and over and over,

933
01:10:13,474 --> 01:10:17,433
down, down, down, down.

934
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:19,445
[ Crash ]

935
01:10:19,513 --> 01:10:23,279
And so with the passing
of the wicked giant,

936
01:10:23,351 --> 01:10:27,515
Happy Valley echoed once again
with song and laughter.

937
01:10:27,588 --> 01:10:29,715
For with the return
of the magic harp,

938
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:32,520
peace and prosperity
reigned throughout the land.

939
01:10:32,593 --> 01:10:35,061
- And the people of the valley--
- We know.

940
01:10:35,129 --> 01:10:37,529
[ Together] Lived happily ever after.

941
01:10:37,598 --> 01:10:41,591
You're a wonderful storyteller,
Mr. Bergen. Isn't he, Charlie ?

942
01:10:41,669 --> 01:10:43,830
Simply thrilling.

943
01:10:43,904 --> 01:10:48,466
You're even better
than the old-fashioned sleeping pill.

944
01:10:48,542 --> 01:10:51,375
- [ Mortimer Sobbing ]
- [ Bergen ] What's the matter,
Mortimer?

945
01:10:51,445 --> 01:10:56,348
Oh, the poor giant got killed,
that he did. [ Crying ]

946
01:10:56,417 --> 01:11:00,217
- I don't like them sad endings.
- Oh, now, you don't understand.

947
01:11:00,287 --> 01:11:03,051
W-Willie was a nice
giant, he was.

948
01:11:03,124 --> 01:11:06,958
He just got too big
for his britches.

949
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:11,362
- But you don't understand.
- No, don't touch me.

950
01:11:11,432 --> 01:11:13,957
[ Sobbing ]
I'll be all right.

951
01:11:14,035 --> 01:11:16,560
[ Blows Nose ]
Oh, excuse me.

952
01:11:16,637 --> 01:11:20,539
What I'm trying to explain,
Mortimer, is that Willie
the Giant didn't actually exist.

953
01:11:20,608 --> 01:11:23,975
- No ?
- No. He's a metaphysical phenomenon...

954
01:11:24,045 --> 01:11:28,709
of your subconscious mind, a
phantasmagoria of your mental faculties.

955
01:11:28,783 --> 01:11:33,152
- Yeah ?
- In other words,just a figment
of your imagination.

956
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:35,154
- No !
- Yes.

957
01:11:35,222 --> 01:11:39,659
- So there's nothing to be upset about.
-[ Creaking ]

958
01:11:42,163 --> 01:11:44,996
Hey ! Has anybody
seen anything...

959
01:11:45,066 --> 01:11:48,092
of a teensy-weensy
little mouse ?

960
01:11:48,169 --> 01:11:51,297
No. I-I-I, uh--

961
01:11:51,372 --> 01:11:53,806
-[ Thud ]
-[ Luana ] Oh, Mr. Bergen!

962
01:11:53,874 --> 01:11:57,503
Bergen, speak to me.
Speak to me.

963
01:11:57,578 --> 01:12:01,036
What's the matter with him ?
Somethin' he ate ?

964
01:12:01,115 --> 01:12:04,676
Uh, no. It's, uh--
It's a fig, uh, fig--

965
01:12:04,752 --> 01:12:07,516
fig-a-mentation
of his imagination.

966
01:12:07,588 --> 01:12:10,182
- No !
-[ Mortimer ] Yeah.

967
01:12:10,257 --> 01:12:13,522
Well, uh,
good night, Willie.

968
01:12:13,594 --> 01:12:16,529
Uh, don't slam
the roof.

969
01:12:16,597 --> 01:12:17,825
You might wake
Mr. Bergen.

970
01:12:17,898 --> 01:12:19,832
[ Laughs ]

971
01:12:26,774 --> 01:12:29,971
*Now some folks
don't believe in giants *
