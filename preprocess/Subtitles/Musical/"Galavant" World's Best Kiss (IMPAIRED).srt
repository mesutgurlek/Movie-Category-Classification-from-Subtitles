496
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:14,451
What are you gonna do now?

497
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:15,919
Uh, it's been a tough year.

498
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,221
I lost my wife, my best friend,

499
00:20:18,222 --> 00:20:19,956
my brother tried to kill me.

500
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:22,092
I really just want to curl up in my room

501
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:24,628
and eat like 1,000 pounds of cake

502
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:27,130
and just let my people adore me.

503
00:20:27,131 --> 00:20:28,298
You?

504
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:31,735
I am going to raise an army
and rescue Isabella.

505
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:33,437
[Chuckling] Right, right, right.
I knew that.

506
00:20:33,438 --> 00:20:34,538
You know, tell you what.

507
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,940
I'm going to give you whatever you need...

508
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:41,645
My army, my fastest ships, sharpest horses.

509
00:20:41,646 --> 00:20:44,548
My... I'm sorry.

510
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:49,752
I swear to god my castle was...Right here.

511
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:03,215
Well, that's not good.

512
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:05,216
