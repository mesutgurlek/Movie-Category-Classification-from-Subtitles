Some say that as we grow up,
we become different people...

2
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,939
at different ages,
but l don't believe this.

3
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:31,219
l thinkwe remain the same
throughout,

4
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,480
merely passing in these years
from one room to another...

5
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:38,480
but always in the same house.

6
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,340
lfwe unlockthe rooms
ofthe far past,

7
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,579
we can look in and see ourselves
beginning to become you and me.

-Thankyou.

61
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,539
There's times l think
it's a mistake...

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,030
to have a dog for a nurse.

63
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,580
Oh, George. Nana's a treasure.

64
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,620
No doubt. But l sometimes have
a sorrt offeeling...

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,500
that she looks upon the children
as her puppies.

66
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:22,310
George,we must keep Nana.

67

George.

72
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,149
Tonight l saw a face
at the window.

73
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,259
Face at the window
two floors up?

74
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:40,339
lt was a face of a little boy.
He was tying to get in.

75
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:42,459
Oh, it's impossible.

76
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,620
That's not the first time
l've seen that boy.

77
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:47,250
-Oh?
-The first time was a week ago.

78
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,860
l remember because it was
Nana's night off.

79
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:53,800
l was sitting there by the fire,
and suddenly l felt a draft...

80
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,060
as though the windowwere open.
l looked...

81
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:00,680
and l sawthat boy in the room.

82
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:02,740
l screamed.

83
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:06,079
Just then, Nana came back
and sprang at him at once.

84
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,959
The boy leapt at the window.
Nana closed it quickly.

85
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,949
-lt was too late to catch him.
-l thought so.

86
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:16,480
But wait! He escaped, but his
shadow hadn't time to get out.

87
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,540
l hid it.

88
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:20,600
l rolled it up.

89
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,750
-And here it is.
-Aha!

90
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,430
Well, l don't think
it's anyone we know,

91
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:29,069
though he does look a scoundrel.

92
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,860
You know, l think he comes back
tying to get his shadow.

93
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,740
-l daresay.
-But wait!

94

l haven't told you all.

95
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,949
The boy was not quite alone.

96
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,899
He was accompanied by...

97

howto describe it.

98

beyond the moon

325
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,630
Or right there where you stand

326
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,890
Just keep an open mind

327
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,230
And then suddenly you'll find

328
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,630
Never Never Land

329
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,210
You'll have a treasure
ifyou stay there

330
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:59,990
More precious farthan gold

331
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:06,069
For once you have found
yourway there

332
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:15,259
You can never, never grow old

333
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:20,519
And that's my home
where dreams are born

334
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,970
And time is never planned

335
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:28,940
Just think of lovely things

336
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:33,759
And your hearrt will fly on wings

337
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,069
Forever

338
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:48,089
ln Never Never Land

339
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,690
Peter,what does it look like?

340
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,210
lt's an island,Wendy.

341
00:21:58,299 --> 00:21:59,589
A large one?

342
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,990
No. Quite small...

343
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:04,799
and nicely crammed...

344
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:09,650
with hardly any space between
one adventure and another.

345
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,490
Oh, it sounds lovely.

346
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:14,799
Who else lives there, Peter?

347
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,150
The Lost Boys.

348
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,789
Who are they?

349
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:22,819
They're the children who fall
out oftheir carriages...

350
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,880
when the nurse is looking
the otherway.

351
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,089
lfthey're not claimed
in 7 days,

352
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:30,269
they're sent far away
to Never Land.

353
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:33,299
l'm captain!

354
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,150
What fun it must be!

355
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:36,880
Yes...

356
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,470
But we're rather lonely.

357
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,119
Peter,why did you come
to our nursey window?

358
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:49,049
To hearthe stories.

359
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,150
None of us know any stories.

360
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,329
How perrfecctly awwful.

361
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:56,630
Wendy...

362
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,599
Your motherwas telling you
such a lovely stoy.

363
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:04,180
Oh? Which stoy is it?

364
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,460
lt was about the prince.

365
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,079
And he couldn't find the lady
who wore the glass slipper.

366
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:15,200
Oh. That's ''Cinderella.''

367
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:17,720
He found her.

368
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,170
And they lived
happily ever after.

369
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:22,880
l'm glad!

370
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:24,079
Where are you going?

371
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,650
-To tell the other boys!
-Oh, please don't go!

372

And you could tuck us in at
night and make pockets for us.

380
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:54,250
None of us has any pockets.

381
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,740
Would you teach John and Michael
