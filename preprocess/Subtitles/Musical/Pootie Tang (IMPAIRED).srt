We have with us today a man who
is so much a part of the culture...

2
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,689

an introduction.

it was the year 2001.

21
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:36,530
It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times.

22
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:40,168
The big city was thriving,
but the inner city was dying.

23
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,336
Who was killing it?

24
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,274
This man. Dick lecter.

The head
of corporate america.

But the people had hope...

27
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,614
Because they knew that there was
one man who could fight the power.

28
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,650
One man who could stop
the madness.

29
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,720
One man who could beat
dick lecter like the l.A.P.D.

And that man-- That man

[Narrator] pootie tang was born in a
small town outside of gary, indiana.

134
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:21,034
And that town
was called chicago.

135
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,703
As he grew,

136
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:26,874
Everyone noticed something different
about the way pootie would talk.

137
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:30,878
It baffled everyone--
Doctors, scientists.

138
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,780
Let me break it down
to you like this.

139
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:37,017
Pootie tang is, was
and will always be...

140
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,053
Too cool for words.

141
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:45,759
[Kid] hi, pootie!
Pootie tang was the most popular kid in town.

142
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:48,028
We didn't always know
what he was saying,

143
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,130
But we always knew
what he meant.

144
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,934
Like i knew i was his best friend.
That's me. Trust me.

145
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:57,037
Yeah, he had
a special effect on people,

146
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,039
Especially on the ladies.

147
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,775
Not girls.
Grown-Ass women.

148
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:08,882
Hiya, pootie tang. I'm a tine cappy,
my damie. Wa-Da-Tah.

149
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,819
All right, pootie tang.
But for some of the ladies,

150
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:15,088
Pootie was just
too hot to handle.

151
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,057
Damn you, pootie tang!

152

I can't take
no more of this!

00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:25,899
Oh, i've had it with you!
You hear me talkin' to you with your nappy head!

155
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,769
This is it!
I'm finished with you!

156
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,672
Get out of my life,
pootie tang!

157
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,374
You think i'm jokin'?
Take your shit!

158
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:41,682
Take your shit and get out,
pootie tang! I'm sick of you!

159
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:45,686
Pootie--
Pootie, don't go.

160
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:51,925
* Just because you bought her
a brand-New car *

161
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,696
* and you got to live
and eat in a mansion *

162
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,965
* like a movie star *

163
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,967
Pootie tang
was an only child.

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,704
His father, daddy tang,
worked hard to raise pootie right.

165
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,707
He had this belt.
He was so fast with that belt...

166
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:12,312
That before pootie could do wrong,
daddy tang would set him right.

167
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:16,249
Don't you grab them peas
without askin' your mama, boy.

168
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,986
May i dane on the cherries,
mama di?

169
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,255
Yes, you may, pootie tang.

170
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,857
Now, that's better.

171
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:29,029
You got to have respect
to get respect, pootie tang.

172
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,866
So, do you have any girlfriends at school, pootie?

173
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,904
Aw, mama di. There's a sine
tippi in a classi-Ti.

174
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,006
She's a cole toni.

175
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,009
Don't you talk dirty
to your mama, boy.

176
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,745
Always got your head
in them girls.

177
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,880
You need to have
your head in the books.

178
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:48,682
Leave the ladies alone.

179
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,918
[Narrator]
and that's the way it was.

180
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,020
Daddy tang and his belt
was always there,

181
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,757
Teaching pootie the difference
between good and bad.

182
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:03,163
Now, when i say he was always there,
i mean he was always there.

183
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:08,335
Hey, pootie, let's
steal some apples.

184
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,778
When pootie was only six,
his mother died,

185
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,113
Leaving him
and his father alone.

186
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:23,216
- Pootie was very sad.
- I know, son.

187
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,419
But his father was a comfort to him.
[Slurping]

188
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,757
Don't slurp your soup
in here, boy.

189
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,427
Two weeks later,
another terrible tragedy.

190
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:39,132
His father was fatally injured at the steel mill.

191
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,036
What the fu--

192
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,505
Gorilla!
Gorilla!

193
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,274
It was incredible.

194
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:51,812
Only the third time a man had been
mauled by a gorilla at that steel mill.

195
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,281
Gorilla! Oh!

196
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:59,920
On his deathbed,
daddy tang had pootie make a solemn promise.

197
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,488
Pootie,

198
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:05,092
I know
i brought you up tough,

199
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,160
But that's
'cause i love you.

200
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:11,098
It's tough
out there, pootie.

201
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:15,836
You got drugs,
crime, gorillas.

202
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,471
Yeah.

203
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,909
I ain't gonna
be here much longer,

204
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,778
So i'm gonna
give you this.

205
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,315
Pootie,
that's my belt.

206
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:32,119
As long as you got it
right on your side,

207
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:38,191
You could whoop anyone's ass with just that belt.

208
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,262
I know
you love the ladies,

209
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:46,533
And lord knows
the ladies love you.

210
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:50,938
Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt.

211
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,306
[Weak coughing]

212
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,376
[Narrator] those were daddy tang's last words:

213
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:01,982
"Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt."

214
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:05,853
But there was something
else about the ladies...

215
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:11,024
That daddy tang forgot
to tell little pootie.

216
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,561
- Pootie tang turned out just fine.
- [Crowd] pootie tang!

217
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,064
Daddy tang
would have been proud.

218
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:21,134
Yeah, pootie had it all--
Hit records, movies,

219
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,904
Magazine covers,
fancy cars,

220
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,907
Famous friends, beautiful
custom-Made clothes...

221
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,844
And ladies, ladies, ladies.

222
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:35,315
Through it all, i was right there by his side.
That's me. Trucky.

223
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:36,917
And that's my man,
pootie tang.

224
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,319
Pootie tang.
Pootie tang!

225
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,222
Big-Time celebrity,
ass-Kickin' crime fighter...

226
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,891
And role model
to the children.

227
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:48,428
[Announcer] pootie tang has a
message for the children of america,

228
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:54,101
So you better
wapatah to the bammies 'cause:

229
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:59,506
Pootie says cigarettes and fast-Food
burgers are bad like netatai.

230
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:05,245
And don't drink malt liquor 'cause
you don't need to 'cause you're okay.

231
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,082
Sa da tay. Also, eat
all your vegetables...

232
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:14,154
And don't bang the dillies.

233
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,468
[Trucky] that's frank,
dick lecter's right-Hand man.

234
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,271
So what do we care?

235
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:34,041
We care because
he's making these.

236
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:40,013
People have been making p.S.A.'S for years.
Hasn't made a difference.

237
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:43,650
Eddie, uh, hit me
with those figures.

238
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,954
Uh, since the inception of
pootie tang's p.S.A. Campaign,

239
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:50,457
Sales of lecter burgers
are down 30 percent,

240
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,260
Lecter cigarettes
down 20 percent...

241
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,262
And lecter whiskey,

242
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,696
Almost out of business.

243
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,500
For the first time,
somebody's getting to these kids, and it's killing us.

244
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,435
It's killing us.

245
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,973
It's killing us.

246
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:09,442
[Rings]

247
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,283
Hello, mr. Lecter.

248
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:20,653
Frank, i have a job for you.
Yes, sir.

249
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,423
I tell you, man,

We make up pootie's crew.

251
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:31,731
Pootie tang will draw you a picture
of how he's gonna kick your ass...

252
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,467
Then mail it to you
ten days in advance.

253
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,469
The picture
gets there, right?

254
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,438
You go,
"what the hell is this?"

255
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:42,009
Then pootie tang knocks on your door,
promptly kicks your ass,

256
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,977
And you still won't know
what happened to you.

257
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:47,314
You got that right.
He is a kick-Ass artiste. Yes.

He like the da vinci of ass-Kicking.

259
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:53,653
That sounds kind of good. Pootie tang,

260
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,189
Aw, man, pootie tang

00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:02,062
That's right. You got right here,

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:23,270
And kids love you.
We just wanna put that together.

305
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,438
Nah, di.

306
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,607
That's a canapan
to the semachai.

307
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,143
I didn't even tell you
how much it pays, pootie.

308
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:33,213
Twenty million dollars to sign with us for just one year.

309
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:36,483
Oh, what do you say,
pootie?

310
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:40,353
I got to say the nay-No,
my brother. Wa-Da-Tah.

311
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:45,225
Wa-Da-Tah?
How do you say the nay-No to 20 million? Why?

312
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:48,728
Maybe pootie don't wanna sign
because he knows you're full of it.

313
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:53,466
Yeah. First of all,
he knows that cereal's full of sugar.

314
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,536
And number two,
that's not all that you guys sell.

315
00:18:56,569 --> 00:19:01,908
You sell cigarettes, whiskey,
bad time burgers, switchblades.

316
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:06,746
And it also says right here that you will
no longer have pootie doing p.S.A.'S...

317
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,716
Telling the kids to eat
healthy and to be smart.

318
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,718
Well, sure, exclusivity
goes without saying.

319
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:15,888
I'm sure your ugly intentions go without saying.

320
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:18,558
Take a walk,
money man.

321
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:26,733
See, my damie,
pootie tang don't wa-Da-Tah to the shama cow...

322
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:30,737
'Cause that's a cama
cama leepa-Chaiii, dig?

323
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:35,708
Hey, tang, to you, they're children.
To me, they're dollar signs.

324
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,212
Doh!

325
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,248
- Ooh!
- Cover your grill.

326
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,515
Sa da tay!

327
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,419
Pootie!
Pootie tang!

328
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,756
Aw, man!

329
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,525
You funny, man.
You are a funny man.

330
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,993
You's a wild boy.

331
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,729
[Trucky] pootie smacked the taste out of frank's mouth.

332
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:59,566
Oh, man, that
was funny to us. Ha-Ha!

333
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,737
But there was one man
who was not laughing at all.

334
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:08,941
Pootie tang goes out there
and makes everybody love him.

335
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:12,845
He tells them
not to buy my products.

336
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,815
He steals from me.

337
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,750
And what do i do?

338
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:23,323
I say take my money. Here.
Take it. Fine. Huh?

339
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,857
And he says no.

340
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,560
[Trucky] i guess you're wondering,
who is this bitch here?

341
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,730
That's ireenie,
dick lecter's main squeeze...

342
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,633
And the most dangerous
woman on the planet.

343
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:37,270
Now, she don't look it,
but she can bring any man down.

344
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:40,773
I know what makes
pootie tang...

345
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:46,446
Tick, tock, tick.

00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:19,278
Lepatime.

352
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,883
What's he got
on his mind?

353
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,753
We're starting
from scratch, i guess.

354
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,655
Pootie knows
what pootie do.

355
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:31,591
This is gonna be good.

356
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:36,696
Okay, pootie,
i'll play back the levels the way you set them.

357
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:40,500
No instruments, no vocals,
no levels, everything silent.

358
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,002
Set it on me. Bleed.

359
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:08,395
Pootie don't need no words.
Don't even need no music.

360
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:13,466
Whoa!

Nice job, ireenie.

616
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,778
You're a damn genius, baby.
Uh-Huh.

617
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:42,781
"I, pootie tang, do surrender
to lecter corp...

618
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:46,051
All the rights to
my image and likeness."

619
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,986
No.
Oh, yes, yes.

620
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,422
"I will wholeheartedly endorse all lecter corp.
Products...

621
00:39:50,456 --> 00:39:52,791
"And will do my best to convince
the children of the world...

622
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:55,126
"That the above mentioned
are all clean, safe...

623
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,829
And should be bought
and used by all of them."

624
00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:01,199
No, not
the tippi tais, no.

625
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,903
No, no. You are part of the corporation,
just like us.

626
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:08,006
Thought you could stay
out of it, huh?

627
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,744
Welcome aboard,
pootie tang.

628
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:15,080
Are you looking
for something, my friend?

629
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:19,751
Are you?
I've got it all now.

630
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:23,555
Shocking news today as beloved
pootie tang has agreed to endorse...

631
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:26,825
Several controversial
products for lecter corp.,

632
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,794
The infamous
giant corporation.

633
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:31,697
Yo, fellas,
somethin' on the tv about pootie tang.

634
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,799
Even my kids, man, looked up to him.
You know what i mean?

635
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:37,936
They don't even look at dad
like they look at him.

636
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,772
But now since he crossed,
man, my little--

637
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:42,808
My little man came up to me the other day and was like,

638
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:44,776
"Man, how could he do
that bullshit, man?

639
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,045
[Beep] that [beep]" i'm lookin' at him like, "whoa."

640
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:51,517
[Speaking spanish]

641
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,687
[Continues in spanish]

642
00:40:56,722 --> 00:41:01,026
Pootie tang has made my children cry.
I'll not support him anymore.

643
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:04,029
Lecter corp.
Effectively owns the name pootie tang,

644
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:07,833
His image and all copyrights
that go along with it.

645
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:09,234
Mr. Lecter!
Mr. Lecter!

646
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:12,971
Mr. Tang has agreed to do several
commercials endorsing our sneakers,

647
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:16,642
Food products and cigarettes, whiskey,
mace, switchblades, rat poison.

648
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,510
[Woman] mr. Lecter,
can we have a statement--

649
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:21,046
* why you sell out,
pootie **

650
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,183
Pootie?
Oh, no!

651
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,152
You know, biggie shorty,
i got to say,

652
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:30,722
I always had a high opinion of pootie tang.

653
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:33,592
But the way things are going now,
not only has he sold out,

654
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,594
He's scraping
the bottom of the barrel.

655
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:39,130
Pootie tang was drugged
by that crazy-Ass ireenie.

656
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,733
- Haven't you been watchin' the movie?
- And that's what disturbs me.

657
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:45,136
He's out there telling kids not to go to school,

658
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,938
To eat fast food,
to do drugs.

659
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:50,776
This is not the pootie tang i thought
i knew and i used to admire.

660
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:54,613
- Pootie tang-- He would never tell kids like that.
- You're in denial.

661
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:56,848
He's out there doing dirt to his own reputation.
Look.

662
00:41:56,882 --> 00:42:00,619
- You don't know pootie tang.
- I don't know pootie tang?

663
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:02,654
Believe me,
i know pootie tang,

664
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:04,756
And this is not the pootie tang i thought i knew.

665
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:08,093
You know what? I thought a man of
your stature would have better sense...

666
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:11,296
Than to fall
for no mess like that.

667
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:14,900
[Sighs] look,
this thing has all fallen apart.

668
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:18,737
The man used to be admired
by people of all walks of life.

669
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,606
And you know what?

670
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,810
If the world is gonna fall for this
mess about my pootie tang,

671
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:26,978
Then maybe the world
don't deserve pootie tang.

672
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:30,816
What do you think pootie tang
needs at this point in his life?

673
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:33,218
He just needs some
of my good lovin'...

674
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,021
And he will be all right.

675
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,189
- You watch.
- I hope you're right.

676
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,726
- I know i'm right.
- Yeah, we'll see.

677
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:42,794
Yeah, we'll see.
That's right.

678
00:42:42,828 --> 00:42:45,697
Watch.
I will.

679
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:50,969
* You used to be a hero

680
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:56,074
* now you're just
a big, fat zero **

681
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:58,977
[Trucky]
pootie tang was messed up.

682
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,813
Punk bitch.
Sellout.

683
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:05,684
[Trucky] look at him.
Damn, pootie! Get a job, you bum.

684
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:10,155
Get it together, man.
Pootie looked like who did it and ran.

685
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:12,991
Pootie turned to the only woman who could help him.

686
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:16,962
Biggie shorty.
* Biggie shorty

687
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:22,300
* biggie, baby *

688
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:26,672
Pootie!

689
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:30,709
Aw, pootie.

690
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:33,879
Poor pootie tang.
Tippi tai.

691
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:38,116
That's all right.
Mama's got you.

692
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:41,319
That's all right.

693
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,123
Biggie shorty's
gonna take care of you.

694
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,192
Don't you worry.

695
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:50,729
Gonna have sex
with you too, you know.

696
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:53,364
Finally.

697
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,340
Are you sure you
gotta go, pootie?

698
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,309
Yeah.

699
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:06,845
[Sucks teeth]
that's a damn shame.

700
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:10,015
You were the best piece
of man i ever had.

701
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:13,018
You know,
you could just stay here and live between my bosoms...

702
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:16,855
For the rest
of your life.

703
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:20,759
Pootie gotta flittie tai,
biggie shorty.

704
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:23,394
Man's gotta do, i suppose.

705
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:27,365
I guess as long as you gone they can't
make you do no more commercials.

706
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,936
But where you gonna go?

707
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:35,841
I tell you what.
I got a little farmhouse outside of greenville.

708
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:38,944
It was my mama's. It ain't much,
but nobody's livin' there.

709
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:43,782
You go out there,
find yourself, blah, blah, blah.

710
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:46,351
But then you come
back to me, okay?

711
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:48,253
That's a fine tine, baby.

712
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:55,060
Now, give me some of that bony ass
one more time before you hit the road.

713
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:05,771
Man, i hates prison.
Prison sucks.

714
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:08,907
I reckon
it's supposed to.

715
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:12,477
You got somethin'
for me?

716
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:19,918
Oh! Oh!
Uh-Huh. Uh-Huh.

717
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:21,820
Mm-Hmm.
Oh!

718
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:25,991
Oh, this some fine dirt.
This is some good dirt.

719
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:28,426
Oh!
You know i'm gonna hook you up.

720
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,428
Man, i hate
these bastards.

721
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,163
They make me shower
every day.

722
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:38,336
They never let me get dirty.
I need to be dirty. I'm dirty dee, damn it!

723
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:40,305
Dirty dee.
Huh?

724
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:45,243
You gonna be dirty
again soon. I promise.

725
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:47,378
It's that pootie tang.

726
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,981
It's that pootie tang.
He got to be stopped.

727
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:54,519
I'm the one that's got to stop him.
Pootie goddamn tang!

728
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:59,357
* You gonna, you gotta
you gonna, you gotta **

729
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:02,460
Thank you.
[Trucky] pootie! Pootie!

730
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:04,062
Pootie! Pootie!

731
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,432
[Trucky] pootie was headed to the farm.
I wanted to go with him.

732
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:10,869
I wanna go with you, brother.
'Cause everything that happened was all my fault.

733
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:14,005
Pootie, everything that happened, man,
it's all my fault.

734
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:17,809
I told that bitch all about him.
I told this bitch all these things about you, man.

735
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:20,578
She just used it against him.
And she just used it against you.

736
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:24,015
I was sorry. I'm sorry, man.
I'm so sorry.

737
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:25,616
It was killing me.
It was killing me.

738
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:30,255
Only did it for the ass.
Only did it for her ass, you understand.

739
00:46:30,856 --> 00:46:33,024
That deri-Teri was
all the dinie, huh?

740
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:35,961
I felt like he saved my life.
Pootie, man, i just feel like...

741
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:37,829
You saved my life.

742
00:46:37,863 --> 00:46:40,298
And i messed his all up.
Now i messed yours all up.

743
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:45,036
I wanted him to forgive me.
Can you ever forgive me, man?

744
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:48,139
Aw, trucky.

745
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:51,076
You my main damie, man.

746
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,180
Ain't no bad tammie
between us.

747
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:58,016
I wondered if he meant it.
You mean it?

748
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:01,920
I'm a baino denny.
I wanted to go to the farm with him.

749
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:04,522
Can i go to the farm
with you, brother?

750
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,324
Wa-Da-Tah!

751
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:09,094
All right!
Me and pootie going to the farm!

752
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:12,397
Whoo! You know,
i'm lookin' forward to this farm life.

753
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,300
Enough of the city
for me. Whoo!

754
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:19,871
Yeah, this is just
what we need, pootie.

755
00:47:19,905 --> 00:47:24,075
Live off the fat
of the land, work hard.

756
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:27,879
Farming, farming, farming.
I can't wait, man.

757
00:47:27,913 --> 00:47:29,614
I cannot wait.

758
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:33,084
We're gonna milk that cow.
Ooh-Whoo!

759
00:47:33,118 --> 00:47:35,086
Get all that milk.

760
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,888
Two percent fat free.

761
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:41,226
Skim milk. All that, man.
Chocolate milk.

762
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:45,230
I don't need
no television, cappuccino,

763
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:47,365
Partying all night long.

764
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:50,969
I'm want some blisters on my hands,

This is not the thing, man.
This ain't cool, man.

this dog following me around?

Whose dog is that?
You don't know who dog that is.

That could be anybody's dog.

Outback, my ass.
I need conveniences, man.

788
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:12,183
On the other hand,
pootie was lovin' every minute of it.

789
00:49:12,217 --> 00:49:16,054
He was rejuvenated.
You hear that? Rejuvenated.

790
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:18,223
He was "juvenated" before,
lost it...

791
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:21,659

about pootie tang.

826
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:24,115
You mean public enemy number one in my world.

[All laughing]

828
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:28,686
Huh? Right?

829
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,788
We learned that anything
can be addictive.

830
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:35,726
We took our burgers and
pumped them so full of m.S.D...

831
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,730
That people can't even
taste real food anymore.

832
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:43,601
Today american kids don't eat
'cause they're hungry.

833
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:49,574
They eat 'cause they just gotta
have another lecter burger.

834
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,609
You see,
i own pootie's name.

835
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:55,280
He's mine.
I don't need him to sell my products anymore...

836
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:58,483
Because i've got thousands of them all over the country.

837
00:51:58,516 --> 00:52:04,555
I'm just gonna give them the
clothes and this training tape.

838
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:07,392
And remember, when making
a public appearance,

839
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:12,363
Pootie tang always
struts like this.

840
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:22,273
Next week we're opening a brand-New
nationwide chain of burger stands.

841
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:27,312
Pootie's
bad time burgers.

842
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:30,215
As a matter of fact,
the only thing that could mess up our little party...

843
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:33,418
Is if the real pootie
showed up.

844
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:36,354
But that ain't
good enough.

845
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:39,557
I want him dead.
[Dirty dee] yeah.

846
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:44,262
I'd like to put that bitch in the ground myself,
but i ain't magical.

847
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:46,231
I been tryin' to get
that pootie for years.

848
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:50,268
He done jailed or offed all my boys.
All i got left is froggy.

849
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:53,338
Nobody know
where pootie's at.

850
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:55,973
I know where he's at.

851
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,942
I got people
everywhere, baby.

852
00:52:57,975 --> 00:53:01,679
Nobody can hide
from corporate america.

853
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:04,882
And as far
as how to beat him,

854
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:09,920
Maybe this will help.

855
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,592
[Stacy]
hello?

856
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:17,562

D-D-Do you want
the pie?

I-I-I know
i'm not pretty or--

Or sexy.
Y-Y-You--

868
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:15,653
You probably like a...
sexy girl, right?

869
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:32,803
Baby,

870
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:38,008
I'm gonna sine your pitty
on the runny kine.

[Moaning, grunting]

873
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,491
Now, see, that's what makes
pootie tang a real hero.

874
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:56,327
He can't stand by and see
a woman not lovin' herself.

875
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:58,529
He's gonna put
the love in her.

876
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:01,866
Now, me, i say just
give her a compliment.

877
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:05,002
Hey, i like your shoes.
Have you been workin' out?

878
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,838
Girl, what you doin'
with your hair?

879
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:10,741
But i tell you what,

880
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:15,980
I'm only gonna buy this hero shit but so many times.

881
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:19,684
[Trucky] back in the big city,
all hell was breaking loose.

882
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:22,119
I'm talking about
drug dealin', drug usin',

883

Booty shakin',
too much damn tv,

Drinkin', people eating too much,
gettin' all fat and sloppy,

885

Fightin', kids out of school,
ain't nobody readin',

886

People actin'
a straight damn fool.

887
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:36,901
And corporate america
was just loving it.

888
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:39,604
Look at them.
It's a party now.

889
00:55:39,637 --> 00:55:43,140
Since he left, it just changed.
Everything just went bonkers.

890
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,976
Everybody lost their mind
and what not.

891
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,745
Pootie tang,
you shouldn't do this.

892
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:51,416
You should come back to the city,
where you belong.

893
00:55:55,486 --> 00:55:57,855
[Trucky] back on the farm,
the worst happened.

894
00:55:57,888 --> 00:56:00,525
Pootie tang's cornstalk died.

895
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:02,527
And for the third time
in his life,

896
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,730
Pootie lost the only thing
that was important to him.

897
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:10,535
First his family, then his belt,
and now his corn died.

898
00:56:10,568 --> 00:56:13,037
Farm life was
driving pootie crazy.

899
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:15,640
He must have lost his damn mind.
Look at him.

900
00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:18,776
Down on his knees,
crying over a piece of corn.

901
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:22,713
Not even popcorn.
Regular damn corn.

902
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:24,749
Pootie tang had lost all hope,

903
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:28,653
And it was gonna take
a miracle to bring him back.

904
00:56:29,654 --> 00:56:32,790
[Daddy tang]
pootie.

905
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:35,826

Daddy?
You damn right i'm your daddy.

909
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,634
Pootie, what you doin' runnin' away from your problems?

910
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:18,669
- Did i teach you like that?

Hey, don't you
mumble, boy!

[Cowbells ringing]

Mama di.

00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:28,813
Pootie, you're a good man.
I'm proud of you.

915
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:33,784
You have so much love in you,
and you can give it like a gift.

916
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:37,822
Your father was wrong to tell
you to guard it like a secret.

917
00:57:37,855 --> 00:57:41,258
- W-W-What was that?
- Shut your mouth!

- Woman!
