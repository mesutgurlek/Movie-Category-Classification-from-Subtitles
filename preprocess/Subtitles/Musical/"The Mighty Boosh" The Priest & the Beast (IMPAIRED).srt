looped it back, mixed it
with the sound of this crab committing suicide

and let it stew in its own reverb
for about three hours,

00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,113
NABOO: And that's the end.

459
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,272
-That's the end?
-And the lesson is

460
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,358
you can only find The New Sound
at the end of a long journey.

461
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,268
How does that help us, you berk?
We've got to meet the record label in 1 0 minutes.

462
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,472
-Good point.
-You'd better get some magic potions out, Mowgli,

463
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,909
-or we're going to hurt you.
-All right, calm down.

464
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,908
This is liquid music,
it will turn you into musical geniuses.

465
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,600
-What is this?
-It's the tears of Mozart.

466
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,510
Mixed with the urine of Mark Knopfler.

467
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,676
-How long does it last?
-Three hours. Quick, run.

468
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,950
Play like you've never played before.

469
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,150
You are truly wise, Naboo.

470
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,636
Do you think with magic potion
they will get record deal?

471
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,909
-I doubt it, that was just Lucozade.
-Oh.

472
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,470
Come on, mind your feet. Mind your feet.

473
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,275
Thank you.

474
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,508
-No, it couldn't be.
-I think it was.

475
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,237
What did I tell you before, huh?
What goes around comes around.
