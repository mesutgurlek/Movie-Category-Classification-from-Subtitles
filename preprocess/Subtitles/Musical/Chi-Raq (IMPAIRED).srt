- Chi-Raq?
- What?

319
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,807
That's what they call him.

320
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,050
Wait a minute now. Hold on.

321
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,570
They call him Chi-Raq?

322
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,007
Yes, ma'am.

323
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,642
Lord, have mercy.

324
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,120
Well, he's a rapper.

325
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,245
I mean, he's gonna be big time famous.

326
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,646
You really never heard of him?

327
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,849
I heard he was the leader
in this gang mess, girl.

328
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,566
Oh, Miss Helen,
they don't say "gang" anymore.

329
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,201
They say organization.

330
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,890
What is his real name?

331
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,371
His government name?

332
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,361
Nah.

333
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,841
Demetrius.

334
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,446
Demetrius DuPree.

335
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,808
Demetrius DuPree.

336
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,041
His father?

337
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,001
All Chi's told me
is that he died in prison.

338
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,248
He's got a good heart
deep down inside.

339
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,281
I love him.

340
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,762
- I can change Chi.
- Darling.

341
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,890
People change
when they decide to change.

342
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,770
You make it sound so easy.

343
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,850
All you can do
is create an environment for change.

344
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,730
Like an alcoholic,
you take away his booze.

345
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,326
You just try taking away their guns.

346
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,801
All right.
Well, what else do they love?

347
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,928
- Getting turned up, making money.
- What else?

348
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,810
[CHUCKLING] Yeah, Well.

349
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,041

That ain't the thing, Rasheeda.

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,641
- I'm on fire.
- Burn, baby, burn.

371
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,371
We agreed to hook up, make this plan.

- Damn right, it was today.

00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,082
Y'know I was waitin'
for a line from Jackson.

He's in Afghan, seein' action.

Waitin' for his call,
I went to the mall.

Lil' Man wanted some Cap'n Crunch.

or maybe lunch.

- Check your girl.
- Check her.

402

Check the ignorance.

00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,160
And I know you know Kenya, the rapper.

God Forbid, Cyclops find you
Spartan chicks up in here.

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,731
Everybody in here got a man
in orange and purple colors.

410
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,768
Bangin' and slangin',
fighting for a flag,

411
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,962
risking that long zip
of the cadaver bag.

412

- That's how we live.
- That's how we die.

You want to loose your man
to a drive-by?

414
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,762
In a pinebox before he's 25.

415
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,366
- I lost my cousin.
- And I lost my little brother.

416
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,721
I lost my nephew.

417
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,604
My uncle got killed two weeks ago.

418
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,326
And like always, nobody saw nothin'.

419
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,686
All to the bang, bang.

420
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,250
Bang, bang.

421
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,766
We've all lost people, too.
Many a sister and brother.

422
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,320
Now, I'd like to see
Cyclops and Chi put down that mess

423
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,244
between the Trojan and the Greeks,
but that day looks bleak.

424
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,125
What if we could devise a method
to end the bloodshed?

425
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,203
Yo count on me. You need money?

426
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,443
I'll pawn all the gold around my neck,
den git turned up 'till I'm a wreck!

427
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,602
I'm ready to split myself
up the middle, to give you half.

428
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,682
I'm down for the cause but how?

429
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,725
We force our men to negotiate peace

430
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,731
by exercising cocksure self control

431
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,770
and total abstinence
from knockin' the boots.

432
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,491
I never did like you Trojan
chicken heads any-goddamn-way so...

433
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,608
- Oh, hell, no.
- You got to get out of here.

434
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,762
- Y'all kickin' us out?
- Yeah, out of here.

435
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,490
- Shoot 'em up.
- Bang, bang.

436
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,329
Please, please, just sit down.

437
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,283
We ain't gonna be dat long,
Rasheeda, shut up!

438
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,525
- Give me one more minute.
- Hey, I got my son with me,

439
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,601
<i>I</i> got to go.

440
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,331
Marcy, this has to do with your son.

441
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,530
Just a minute ago, you were ready
to split yourself up the middle.

442
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,008
Go ahead so that
you Spartans can get out of here.

443
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,288
I just saw a mother weepin'
in the streets.

444
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,488
Her baby's blood spilt.

445
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,286
Man, you really think
somethin' like that could bring peace?

446
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,449
Y'all know the power we have over them
withholding with just a day.

447
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,084
A week? Imagine a month.

448
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,890
A year.

449
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,966
They are gonna bring the peace.

450
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,243
Suppose, suppose
that the men just dump us.

451
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,687
If we all hold out,
who can they go to?

452
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,120
The thots!

453
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,600
Dem hoes o'er there.

454
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,842
Well, we will enlist them too.

455
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,327
We want our men alive,
we want our babies to thrive,

456
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,170
we gonna have to organize.

457
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,681
Repeat after me.

458
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:26,008
I will deny all rights of access
or entrance...

459
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,967
I will deny all rights

460
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,330
of access or entrance...

461
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,367
from every husband, lover,
or male acquaintance...

462
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,324
from every husband, lover,
or male acquaintance...

463
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,962
who comes to my direction,
in-erection...

464
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,883
who comes to my direction,
in-erection...

465
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,884
Come on, say it.

466
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,608
Girl, can't cheat us.

467
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,968
I can't do this. No.

468
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,250
If he should force me to lay
on that conjugal couch...

469
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,721
if he should force me to lay
on that conjugal couch...

470
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:17,251
I will refuse his strokin',
not give up that nappy pouch.

471
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,407
I will refuse his stroke,
not give up that nappy pouch.

472
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,922
- No peace...
- No pussy.

473
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,291
The red wine has been drunk,
the plan has now struck.

The Underground Economy exists

629
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,605
because banks and lending institutions

00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,085
[APPLAUSE]

633
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,768
Their children,
however admire the thug life.

634
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,681
But they do so from the safety
of suburban Chicago!

635
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,844
Kenilworth, Wilmette, Highland Park.

636
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,164
No, this gun wouldn't
be caught dead there!

637
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,446
This gun is the principal player
in a reality TV urban murder show,

638
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,081
that can be seen every night
at five and ten.

639
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,926
Every channel! On any news show
you want to watch!

640
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,844
And that's when this gun...

641
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,250
Met our child Patti.

642
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,206
Patti.

643
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,970
Patti is gone

644
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,202
because our politicians
are in the pocket

645
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,881
of the National Rifle Association.

646
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,168
And have become their mouthpieces
or silent co-conspirators.

647
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,129
[APPLAUSE]

648
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,284
Patti is gone

649
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,001
because of an economy
that has abandoned the poor.

650
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,168
Downtown they say unemployment
is at 5.7%...

651
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,647
How's that sound?

652
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,488
Right here in Auburn-Gresham,
unemployment is 21%.

653
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,883
And that doesn't even count people
who have given up hope

654
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,963
and stopped looking for work.

655
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,525
The per capita income is $12,000.

656
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,327
42% of us live below the poverty line.

657
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,645
30% don't have a high school diploma.

658
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,690
- What America are they living in?
- Yes!

659
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,970
We go from third rate schools,

660
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,801
to first class, high tech prison!

661
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:24,409
Mass incarceration,
is the new Jim Crowe.

662
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,722
[APPLAUSE]

663
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,764
Our Patti is gone

664
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,206
because gang members
are more concerned

665
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,881
with popping pills
and popping bottles.

666
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,611
More concerned with what's on YouTube!

667
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,801
More concerned with ego!

668
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,249
Street cred and greed
than a human life.

669
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,768
Patti is gone because guns have become
a part of America's wardrobe,

670
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,926
where it's easier to get a gun
than a computer.

671
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,003
Sirens and gunshots

672
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,124
are our soundtrack.

673
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,402
Yellow police tape, teddy bears,
T-shirts, balloons,

674
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,882
these are the national memorials
of our neighborhoods.

675
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,250
And it doesn't look good.

676
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,240
MAN: Take your time.

677
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,285
[APPLAUSE]

678
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,081
It didn't look good.

679
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,090
When the sky turned dark.

680
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,129
And the sun refused to shine.

681
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,168
And the earth began to quake.

682
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,810
And they laid Jesus' lifeless body
at the arms of Mother Mary!

683
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,286
And I don't need to go back
to Biblical times.

684
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,567
It didn't look good
in a Birmingham church

685
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,570
when four little girls
were blown apart by hate!

686
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,727
It didn't look good,

687
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,485
when Medgar was laying
bleeding to death in his driveway.

688
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,241
It didn't look good, when Malcolm
was shot down on the Audubon stage.

689
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,687
And didn't look good,
when Martin Luther King

690
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,402
stood on the balcony of
the Lorraine Motel outside Room 306,

691
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,530
and at 6:03 was taken from us.

692
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,883
And no, it doesn't look good...

693
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,482
Not when Patti was lost
on a busy street,

694
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,608
with folks going to work and school,

695
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,523
with cars passing by.

696
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,931
How is it possible that not one
witness has come forward?

697
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,923
- Not one!
- How is it possible

698
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,642
that no one has the courage
and the conscience to speak up

699
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,446
- for this family!
- Somebody knows.

700
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:03,009
WOMAN: Somebody knows.

701
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,882
Cynics say,
"Well if I snitch I'll be killed too."

702
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,486
First of all,
when a murderer walks free,

703
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,403
we are all in danger.

704
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,482
But if multiple folks come forward,

705
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,921
multiple folks who
witnessed these murders

706
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,849
there is no one target.

707
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,322
What makes someone
a target is not the shooter.

708
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,482
What makes someone
a target is the community

709
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,688
that surrenders to fear.

710
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,090
And becomes silent!

711
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,929
That's why we at St. Sabina

712
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,525
must put out a $5,000 reward
for information

713
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,769
leading to the arrest
of Patti's killer.

714
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,081
Or any killer!

715
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,369
Because we need to say loud and clear,

716
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,363
you cannot murder our children!

717
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,206
You cannot murder our children
then go back to the crib.

718
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,011
Turn on Sportscenter,
eat a Whopper and fries

719
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,525
and act like nothing ever happened!

720
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:06,802
We will not allow this
self-inflicted genocide to continue.

721
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,406
This is a disgrace!

722
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,126
Patti lives!

723
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,846
And Patti will have justice!

724
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,281
- Do you have faith?
- Yes!

725
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,567
- Do you want justice?
- Yes!

00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,689
- Are you willing to get up and walk?
- Yes!
