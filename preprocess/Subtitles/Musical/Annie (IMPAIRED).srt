- I'm Grace Farrow. The City
Board of Orphans said...

349
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:15,628
Look, it was all a mistake. Somehow,
Annie got in the laundry basket.

350
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,965
Well, one thing led to another,
and I had to call the cops.
Please don't fire me!

Miss Hannigan,
I do not peddle anything.

I'm personal secretary

The Board of Orphans
sent me here...

00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,462
to extend Mr. Warbucks'
personal invitation to an orphan...

An orphan <i>child.</i>
Perhaps a child like this one.

363
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,702
Great idea. I'm a child,
and I'm an orphan.

A liar!
Annie ain't no orphan.

365
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,574
She's my little girl,
and she's nothing but trouble.

366
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,708
That seems hard to believe.

367

Look, you can have any orphan
in the joint, only you can't have Annie.

should know.

Coat? Why would
a kid need a coat?

Now tell me, what would you like
to do first?

Then come to my club
for dinner and cigars.

well, from that day on,

- Exactly.

your girlfriend there opened her trap.

about the kid.

Annie... Once we got the kid,
what do we do with her?

01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,861
I make her disappear.

Oh. Well, I'm sure

via special messenger from the F.B.I.

Wonderful.

L-I'll take care of everything!

Mr. Warbucks,
the house is ready.

You've <i>really</i> outdone
yourself this time.

Are you ready?

919
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:51,511

Just look at this joint!

- You know what, Annie?
- What?

921
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,392
I think I'm the luckiest man

- Who are you?
- We're your mommy and daddy.

- [Barking]
- Mind your manners.

We're Ralph

- Oh, she's a regular doll.

Drake, please.

987
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:32,096
Perhaps we should
discuss this privately.

988
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:37,907
- Well, we was kids and poor, sick...
- And dumb to leave you.

989
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:39,947
But we had no choice.

990
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:44,951
You see, a nice man in Canada
offered us a job on a farm.

991
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:46,953
- No babies allowed.
- No.

992
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:50,991
So, we had to leave ya
for a little while.

993
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:54,494
Eleven years is more
than a little while.

994
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:58,464
Mr. And Mrs. Mudge, yours is
a touching story, but...

995
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:02,298
But l-l-I suppose
you'd like to see some I.D.

996
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:06,135
<i>Well, here's</i>
<i>our driver's licenses...</i>

997
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:10,007
and, um, Annie's
birth certificate.

998
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:20,321
<i>It appears to</i> b<i>e in order.</i>

999
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:23,983
- That's my birthday.
- Those are the dates in Annie's note.

1000
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:27,687
Yes, but I'm still not sure.

1001
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:33,991
Finally, we saved up enough money
to come looking for our little girl.

1002
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:37,765
<i>We got into town, and we went straight</i>
<i>to where we left our little</i> b<i>a</i>b<i>y.</i>

1003
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:40,501
And the very nice...
and very attractive...

1004
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:43,476
lady at the orphanage said
we'd find Annie here.

1005
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,972
- I still can't believe
we found our baby.
- Me neither.

[Both Sobbing]

1007
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:54,680
Mr. And Mrs. Mudge,
there is one more thing.

1008
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:59,989
Oh! You know, with all the thievin'
that goes on in orphanages,

1009
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:03,690
I bet you don't have what
we left with you all those years ago.

1010
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:09,703
You wouldn't happen to have
the other half of this?

1011
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:11,705
Would you?

1012
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:17,711
- [Gasping]
<i>- Look, Ralphie!</i>
- The locket.

1013
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:19,713
<i>She's wearin'it!</i>

1014
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:23,717
Perfect fit, so if you just get
Annie's things, we'll be on our way.

1015
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:25,753
Mr. Mudge.

1016
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:29,483
- What about the money?
- Oh, of course.

1017
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:32,389
You'll be wanting something
for having taken care of her.

1018
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,826
<i>Well, we ain't got much,</i>

but... here.

1020
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:42,160
You didn't know that Mr. Warbucks
was offering a $50,000 reward...

1021
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:45,672

- He is?

1022
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:48,572
Well, we sure don't want
no money.

1023

- No, no, no, no.
- J<i>ust... We want our little girl.</i>

Come on, Pa.

1025
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,619
On the other hand,

1026
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:07,127
with $50,000,

1027
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:10,426
we could afford
to bring Annie up right.

1028
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:13,797
- Uh-huh.
- [Stammering] In what form
might this money be?

1029
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,802
Certified check.

1030
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,874
You can pick it up
tomorrow with Annie.

Oh, yes, please.

1035
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:35,819
We've lived without her
for 11 years.

1036
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,654
I guess one more night
won't hurt.

Come, Shirley.

1038
