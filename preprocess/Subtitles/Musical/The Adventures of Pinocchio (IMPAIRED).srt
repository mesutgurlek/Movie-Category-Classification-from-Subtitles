1
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,326  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Long, long ago,
in a faraway land

2
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:49,090  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a young woodcarver took
secretly to the forest.

3
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:54,259  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
His name was Geppetto,
and he was shy and quiet.

4
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:56,803  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, and very much in love.

5
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l carve this heart
for dear Leona...

6
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:02,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
while in this
peaceful meadow.

7
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:04,845  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
With dreams and hope...

8
00:01:05,014 --> 00:01:07,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
my love endures.

9
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Forever yours, Geppetto.

10
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:15,288  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sooner or later, though,
when the heart is full...

11
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and the heavens are listening,

12
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:21,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
magic... is bound to happen.

13
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Legendas : Jdacd's

14
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:49,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
For many years after,
Geppetto kept to his chores,

15
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:52,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and the forest
kept Geppetto's secret.

16
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:57,088  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But the forest knew one thing
that Geppetto did not:

17
00:01:57,267 --> 00:02:00,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that miracles
don't grow on trees.

18
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:03,766  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Miracles are made
in the heart

19
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:24,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A log underneath the wheel.

20
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:27,654  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, l got to take you home.

21
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:30,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A very good one, too.

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,628  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right.

23
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,100  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here we go.

24
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,178  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ My wife's the blushing,
blooming rose of dawning

25
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:45,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Without the sting

26
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,339  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Morning, Luigi

27
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:49,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Put a sock in it, Luigi!

28
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:51,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Welcome, welcome

29
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:53,046  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Blessed morning sun

30
00:02:53,223 --> 00:02:54,451  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Welcome, welcome

31
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:55,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ New day just begun

00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:56,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Buon giorno, life

@ Buon giorno, wife

36
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:02,861  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ That's my little song

37
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:05,227  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Good day,

38
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:06,891  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Housework, homework

39
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,731  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Off to work we go

40
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:10,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Buying, selling

41
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,605  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Making money so that we can eat

42
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,742  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ And we can drink

43
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,970  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ and we can have a little fun

44
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:18,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ l've sung my little song

45
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ And now my little song is done

46
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:25,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Buon giorno, Life,

47
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:28,619  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Buon giorno, wife,
my little one

48
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ That's my little song

49
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,452  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Good day,
buon giorno, everyone

50
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:36,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watch this

51
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:41,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oops, looks like you've
dropped your wood,

52
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:42,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Signor Puppetmaker.

53
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maybe l should be
morecareful next time

54
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's go boys.

55
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,707  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, last one to the bridge
gets dunked.

56
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:59,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yoo hoo, everybody.

57
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:00,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm home.

58
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:04,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, don't say hello.

59
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:08,628  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello, little one.

60
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:10,129  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How was your day?

61
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,097  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ah, that's nice. Me...

62
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:14,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l got lost in the forest.

63
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:18,935  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Used to be a time
when west was west.

64
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:20,769  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you two fighting again?

65
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:23,606  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's the problem this time?

66
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,408  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He said l have a funny nose.

67
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:28,641  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l said you have a funny toes.

68
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:29,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Funny nose.

69
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:31,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Funny toes.

70
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:34,049  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now stop it. l'm tired of
hearing you two argue.

71
00:04:34,223 --> 00:04:35,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop it!

72
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know what happens
to bad little boys who fight?

73
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:43,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They go to bed
without being sandpapered.

74
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:47,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's chilly.

75
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:56,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There.

76
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:58,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's going to be a chilly night.

77
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:15,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This log has a will of it's own.

78
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,131  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's see if we can find
a face to match.

79
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,621  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Our heart.

80
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:49,287  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Anyone who wants a new brother,
say so now.

81
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:53,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, all right,
don't everybody talk at once.

82
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:59,132  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm going to make
the most perfect nose.

83
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:06,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A world of wisdom
could be told in a nose.

84
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:58,659  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Open wide.
Give me a big smile.

85
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nina, go find yourself a mouse.

86
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:47,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Blue eyes, just like your papa.

87
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bellissimo.

88
00:07:58,294 --> 00:08:01,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now would you like your papa
to show you how to walk?

89
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes?

90
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,666  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Very nice.
What a smart little boy you are.

91
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me, coming through!

92
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:13,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now say hello
to your brothers and sisters.

93
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Say hello.

94
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:17,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They'll keep you company
while l'm at work.

95
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:21,574  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now what shall we call you,
dear child, hmm?

96
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,776  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're made of pine.

97
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:25,784  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's a start.

98
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:30,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You have beautiful eyes.

99
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,495  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Occhi magnifico.

100
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:37,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll call you...

101
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:41,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio!

102
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio.

103
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:52,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Better to have puppets...

104
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:57,249  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
than noisy little boys
running around.

105
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:04,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, my back is...

106
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm not as young
as l used to be.

107
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:17,528  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nina, leave that puppet alone!

108
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,895  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Behave yourself!

109
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:45,854  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me,
coming through.

110
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ah, get the soap.

111
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:25,066  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you.
Now get me the scrub brush.

112
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:26,861  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scwub-bwsh.

113
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:41,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's happened.

114
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,342  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've finally lost my mind.

115
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,987  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mind...

116
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:49,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's impossible!

117
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:53,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can't be real!

118
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:54,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Real.

119
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But you're a puppet!

120
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:00,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pup-peh...

121
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:03,062  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pa-pa!

122
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:06,265  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, l'm not your papa!

123
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:11,540  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait, Pinocchio.

124
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:12,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop!

125
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:19,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come down right now!

126
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:21,178  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are you doing?

127
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come down this instant,
young... man.

128
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:27,059  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come down here!

129
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:28,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm not going to go
chasing after you.

130
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Luigi, please, put a sock in it!

131
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:45,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio, hold on, l'll save you!

132
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,292  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No!

133
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:30,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take off my underwear right now!

134
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:36,221  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio, listen to me.

135
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:37,650  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio?

136
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:39,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Right. Listen to me.

137
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:40,727  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Papa.

138
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:42,420  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, l--No, that's not--

139
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, yes,
in a manner of speaking.

140
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,329  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, l'm not your papa.

141
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,131  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Papa, papa, papa...

142
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You are a puppet.
You're not a real boy.

143
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:51,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Real boy.

144
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,707  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No! And be glad for it.

145
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,935  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf you were a real boy,

146
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:59,171  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
you'd have to have doctor
istead of--

147
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:01,578  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sit still!

148
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look at this mess! l'll have
to wash all over again.

149
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:06,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ciao, Geppetto.

150
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:09,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Quite a new puppet.

151
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's amazing.

152
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He still needs work.

153
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,058  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So do you. Look at you,
you were up all night again.

154
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- l slept a little.
- You were up all night.

155
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:22,261  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l made these
for Lorenzini's puppets,

156
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:24,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but l think he needs them more.

157
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:25,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you.

158
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're welcome.

159
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,807  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wouldn't want
his head to fry, either.

160
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:30,809  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you.

161
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,208  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're welcome.

162
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:34,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bet your house
is full of sawdust.

163
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,542  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'll come by and sweep it up.

164
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:37,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Leona, l'm not a child.

165
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The Little one,
does he have a name?

166
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:40,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio.

167
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:43,221  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Enchanted.

168
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:44,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Leona

169
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Leona...

170
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:55,103  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You even gave him your heart.

171
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Our heart

172
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:58,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What did you say?

173
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:01,007  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nothing.

174
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:02,734  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come, Pinocchio.

175
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:05,379  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come, Pinocchio.
Come, Papa.

176
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:11,976  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Seems a little stiff, Leona.

177
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:14,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just like his father.

178
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:23,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marco, look!

179
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,491  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look here.

180
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,862  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wow! Look at that.

181
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:39,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wow!

182
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:01,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop it!

183
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are you doing?

184
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,426  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's your color.

185
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:27,528  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Did l ask for a scarf?
- No.

186
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:29,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then get rid of it.

187
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:31,022  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'll take that one.

188
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:36,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's magnificent, Geppetto!

189
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:39,003  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you see what l see?

190
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,065  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes!

191
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:43,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What?

192
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:46,007  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He is more than--
he's just--

193
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:47,341  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
he's...

194
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:48,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, l--well...

195
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:50,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How did you do this?

196
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:51,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't know.

197
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:52,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where are the strings? l--

198
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:53,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't know.

199
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:54,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't know.

200
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:58,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't know.
Tino, am l going crazy?

201
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:00,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l have no idea
how this happened.

202
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:02,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They're going to
burn me at the stake!

203
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:06,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, no,
they've stopped burning people.

204
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:08,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They might hang you, though.

205
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,807  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me, coming through.

206
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:14,465  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then you'll know where
the strings are.

207
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,825  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you real boy?

208
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:33,427  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes. Are you?

209
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:35,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes

210
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:05,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello

211
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,893  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello

212
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:11,965  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, my, what an intriguing
little item you are.

213
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:13,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
May l?

214
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:19,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Empty as a witch's dowry.

215
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:24,339  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, and look how smoothly
his arms move.

216
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:26,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Volpe, Felinet...

217
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me, but haven't you two
got a pushcart to rob?

218
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:34,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We've already done that.

219
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:36,947  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come, Pinocchio.

220
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:41,061  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, but, Geppetto, darling,
we were just playing with him.

221
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,424  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He'll play with
his own sort, thank you.

222
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And what sort would that be?

223
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:50,296  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio, don't
wander away like that.

224
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:52,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't want you to do that.

225
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:56,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't get it.
ls he a boy or a puppet?

226
00:19:56,545 --> 00:20:00,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's a puppet, furface,
and he's worth a fortune.

227
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:03,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And l know exactly
where to cash him in.

228
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:06,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't worry, son,
l'll get your ball back.

229
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:13,289  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take my kid's ball, would you?

230
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:40,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen closely.

231
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:43,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Next week's puppet show...

232
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:45,624  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
must be the most
spectacular ever.

233
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:49,059  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Every single boy
must be in attendance.

234
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:51,859  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lorenzini, darling.

235
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:54,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Felinet, looking for employment?

236
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:57,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l see my timing is purr-fect!

237
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What l've seen
will assure you...

238
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
more curtain calls
than Rome has rats.

239
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do tell.

240
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:08,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There, there. That's better.

241
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:11,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's didn't hurt, did it?

242
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:13,211  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No. Didn't hurt.

243
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What does he want?

244
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:25,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Open up.

245
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No good can come of this.

246
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Be very quiet.
Stay here and be quiet

247
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:35,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't even breathe.

248
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:36,608  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you understand?

249
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:37,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Open up!

250
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:41,179  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Signor Lorenzini, uh...

251
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Geppetto, my friend.

252
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:47,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To want do l owe this honor?

253
00:21:47,522 --> 00:21:51,049  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The honor is mine
to call a gain on the man...

254
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,818  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
with the magical hands.

255
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:54,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l bring good news, Geppetto.

256
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:58,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l am mounting my grandest
production ever,

257
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:03,700  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and l want to purchase
your newest creation...

258
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:07,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
whatever that might be.

259
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:16,182  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've been spending a great deal
of time in the forest lately.

260
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:20,651  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l will carve you something very
special the first chance l get.

261
00:22:22,357 --> 00:22:26,817  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l was looking
for something with,

262
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:30,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
shall we say, thinner strings.

263
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:32,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thinner strings?

264
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:35,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why-- why didn't
you say so? Come.

265
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:38,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've gotjust the thing.

266
00:22:38,206 --> 00:22:41,369  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
These wonderful pieces
are made of cherry wood,

267
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:45,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and they are on sale
this week only.

268
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:47,905  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't toy with me.

269
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,416  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l didn't buy those puppets
from you two years ago,

270
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:54,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and l'm not going to
buy them today,

271
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:57,821  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
so show me your best...

272
00:22:57,993 --> 00:23:00,052  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and show me now.

273
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:11,098  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me. Coming through.

274
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lncredibile.

275
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:17,978  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He is perfect.

276
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:21,647  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stay.

277
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,308  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Boys do little bugs.
- Bugs

278
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,810  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't they?
They like to tease them...

279
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and twist them and--

280
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please, Lorenzini.

281
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:37,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Name your price.

282
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's not for sale.

283
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:42,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Geppetto, everything is for sale.
- Stay, Stay!

284
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:45,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not him.
Not at any price.

285
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:46,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stay, bug.

286
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:11,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can have the emperor
and his daughter, and that's it.

287
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:17,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You are making a big mistake,
Geppetto.

288
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,175  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's my last offer.
Take it or leave it.

289
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:28,744  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Very well.

290
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:37,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l will take these lovely puppets
off your hands.

291
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:41,857  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm just burning with ideas.

292
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you.
Good afternoon, Geppetto.

293
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio.

294
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,502  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio

295
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:08,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lnfantino is a creep.

296
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:13,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, fatty!

297
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,966  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're late, dimwit.

298
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:40,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio, show
yourself right now...

299
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:43,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
because l'm noot leaving this
house to look for you again.

300
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:46,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Would someone please
like to tell us...

301
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:50,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
of a characteristic
which separates humans...

302
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:52,496  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
from the rest of
the animal kingdom?

303
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,259  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cages.

304
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:56,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Humans cry tears, professore.

305
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:59,066  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ah, tears.

306
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:02,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Expressions of the soul.

307
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:05,971  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do any other creatures look
so deeply within themselves?

308
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,146  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, professore. Only humans.

309
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,948  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We must always decide
what is right and wrong.

310
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:16,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excellent.

311
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:28,265  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Woody.

312
00:26:28,436 --> 00:26:29,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You ever get termites?

313
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:32,699  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are termites?

314
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:34,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They're bugs.

315
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:36,700  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l like bugs.

316
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:39,244  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not these kind, you don't.

317
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:42,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They eat wood like you.

318
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:50,853  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, lay off my friend, Woody.

319
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lay off my friend, Woody.

320
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:57,490  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is going on
in my classroom?

321
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:03,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The new kid punched Lampwick,
professore.

322
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:16,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ls that true?

323
00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:22,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No

324
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, how'd you do that?

325
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Silence.

326
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:37,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now, you're not lying to me
by any slim chance, are you?

327
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,181  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There are two kinds of lies--

328
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:56,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lies that have short legs
and lies that have a long nose,

329
00:27:56,591 --> 00:28:00,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and yours are clearly the kind
that have long nose.

330
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:05,490  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now, l will give you one
last chance to redeem yourself.

331
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:10,502  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf you didn't punch Lampwick,
how did he end up on the floor?

332
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,308  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nobody punched Lampwick.

333
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:19,538  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lampwick punched himself.

334
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:25,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l--l mean, a man climed
in the window and punched him.

335
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And Lampwick tried
to kick him back,

336
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:30,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but he missed and fell
on the floor, and--

337
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Silence.

338
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:42,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lnfantino!

339
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Silence!

340
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:59,980  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lnfantino, go on, go on.

341
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Handkerchief. Go on, quickly.

342
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Run, run, run, run, run!

343
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:33,648  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Right, l did punch Lampwick,
professore,

344
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:36,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and l'm sorry

345
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:39,688  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, it's too late
for that now.

346
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,125  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf there's one thing
l will not tolerate...

347
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:44,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in my classroom, it's a liar.

348
00:29:45,733 --> 00:29:47,098  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Out.

349
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:55,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And...

350
00:29:55,243 --> 00:29:57,177  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm sorry that
l kicked him, too.

351
00:29:57,345 --> 00:29:59,176  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Out.

352
00:30:04,452 --> 00:30:08,582  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And l'm even more sorry
that l told a lie.

353
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:10,747  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Out, out, l said.

354
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:14,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But l want to stay and learn.

355
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:18,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now, class, we will review
what we have learned today.

356
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:32,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf anything happened to him,

357
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
he's going to be
in big trouble.

358
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:37,249  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf l don't find him, l'm never
talking to him again.

359
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio!

360
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:22,624  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's finished.
lsn't it beautiful?

361
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everything you bake
is beautiful, dear.

362
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:27,667  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know, l sold it to
the magistrate by the pound,

363
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:30,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and the best part is,
l cheated on the weight.

364
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're very good at that, dear.

365
00:31:38,446 --> 00:31:43,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt reminds me of the cake
that we had on our wedding day.

366
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:00,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't eat that.

367
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- l'm not eating anything.
- Not you!

368
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:04,504  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look!

369
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mmm, more?

370
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:11,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'll give you more.

371
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:14,370  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're a bad boy, huh?

372
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:16,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Real bad boy.

373
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:24,925  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Little mischief maker.

374
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:50,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your father's going to
pay for this!

375
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:01,985  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Got him.

376
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:06,933  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Even better.

377
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,442  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio.

378
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:27,585  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Papa, want some?

379
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,451  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Geppetto, he's yours?

380
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arrest him.

381
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,927  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arrest both of them.

382
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,084  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're under arrest, signore.

383
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait.

384
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Papa.

385
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:39,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on. you, too, little one.

386
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,603  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, stop him!

387
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,534  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There goes our commission.

388
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:47,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Au contraire.

389
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,969  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l have a feeling ourjob
just got easier.

390
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, now.

391
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:17,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's past your bedtime.
lnto bed.

392
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:18,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good night, son.

393
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:23,841  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l love you, Papa.

394
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:29,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l love you, Papa.

395
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:36,908  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l can't do anything right.

396
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:38,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The human dilemma.

397
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:40,177  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who said that?

398
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:41,446  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Or is it the puppet dilemma?

399
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:43,817  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've still got cake
on your face.

400
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,092  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What?

401
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:51,424  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Say, do you always
squish someone...

402
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,533  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
before being
formally introduced?

403
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:57,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are--are you a termite?

404
00:35:57,338 --> 00:35:59,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, please!

405
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:01,300  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So you're not going to eat me.

406
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:03,500  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thanks for the offer,
but li'm on a low-wood diet.

407
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:06,303  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me introduce myself.

408
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The name is...
Pugnacio Elecuzio P. Elegante.

409
00:36:13,788 --> 00:36:14,982  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give me a ''P,'' an ''E,''

410
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:16,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a ''P,'' an ''E.''

411
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:20,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Put'em all together
and call me...

412
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:22,621  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pepe.

413
00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:25,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Pepe?
- You don't like it?

414
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:27,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- lt's OK.
- l'm very sensitive, you know.

415
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:29,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No. lt's--it's fine.

416
00:36:29,503 --> 00:36:31,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We can't all
be called Pinocchio.

417
00:36:32,173 --> 00:36:33,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now listen to me.

418
00:36:33,374 --> 00:36:36,969  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm here because you are
one tumult little puppet.

419
00:36:37,144 --> 00:36:40,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your papa's in jail,
you're all alone,

420
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,146  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
you trounced me
in the alley,

421
00:36:42,316 --> 00:36:46,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and l'm here to see that we get
our friendship back on track...

422
00:36:46,354 --> 00:36:47,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
right this very second!

423
00:36:49,323 --> 00:36:51,484  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sorry.
Didn't meant to holler,

424
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:53,058  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but insects are people,
too, you know?

425
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:57,493  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And l'm a lot more than your
standard garden-variety cricket.

426
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:59,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm a teller of truths.

427
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:02,965  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'll be your best friend,
pine cone.

428
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,695  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'll open your eyes.

429
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:07,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm not a pine cone.
l'm a boy.

430
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:09,907  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not yet, but it's
a top-notch goal...

431
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:12,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for such a cute little puppet,

432
00:37:12,613 --> 00:37:14,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
which is why it's time
to get to work.

433
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:17,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You ca become a real boy
one you get the tools.

434
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:20,779  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'll advise you
and be your regal guardian,

435
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:22,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but you've got to do
the hard work.

436
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,021  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You, my little sapling,

437
00:37:24,191 --> 00:37:26,022  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
will have to shed something blood,
sweat, and tree bark.

438
00:37:26,193 --> 00:37:28,252  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Total eclipse.

439
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:32,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Visitors. How wonderful.

440
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:35,736  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get the door, and be polite,
and smile, now.

441
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:38,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Show those pearly whites.

442
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, stop.

443
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,207  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Let me go.
- Come on. We've got you now.

444
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Court is now in session.

445
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:07,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Case number 491, your honor.

446
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:14,202  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The People versus Luca Antonio
Renaldo Geppetto Baldini.

447
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,139  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My papa.

448
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:19,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt will be all right, Pinocchio.

449
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:22,410  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There he is, your honor,
the little mutilator.

450
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:24,141  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He ruined my cannolis.

451
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:25,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He ruined my fruit tarts.

452
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,844  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Silence, woman.

453
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:29,546  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He even ruined my grandmother's
torta della nonna...

454
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,988  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
with the pinoli
and the chocolate--

455
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:32,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you done?

456
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,424  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, l am not done. l would--

457
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:37,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Arrest her!

458
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:38,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now l'm done.

459
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,762  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now...

460
00:38:44,939 --> 00:38:46,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Since you, Geppetto,

461
00:38:46,974 --> 00:38:51,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
are responsible
for this, uh, puppet,

462
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:53,546  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
how do you plead?

463
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:55,579  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Guilty, sir.

464
00:38:57,852 --> 00:39:02,619  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You will pay 20,000 lira
to the bakers...

465
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and 10,000 to the court.

466
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:05,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l--l don't have it.

467
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,723  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That--that's
three years' wages.

468
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:11,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf you cannot pay, then you
will go to debtors prison.

469
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:14,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Three years locked away.

470
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your honor.

471
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:24,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l propose the court
allow me to pay the fines...

472
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:28,345  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for this poor,
impoverished peasant.

473
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:31,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is most generous
of you, Signore Lorenzini.

474
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:33,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Kindness is my weakness.

475
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:38,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Of course, no good deed
should go without obligation,

476
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:42,785  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
so all l ask is to keep
Pinocchio in return.

477
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:46,057  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lorenzini, please,
take any other puppet.

478
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:49,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l will work for you day
and night the rest of my life.

479
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:56,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Geppetto, is itjust
money for you?

480
00:39:57,044 --> 00:39:58,773  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio needs a home.

481
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:01,813  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All you can offer him...

482
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:05,782  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
is table scarps
and cold winter nights,

483
00:40:05,953 --> 00:40:08,854  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but with me,
he will have a family.

484
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:12,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's a family, Papa?

485
00:40:12,293 --> 00:40:16,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My goodness,
such a heartbreaking question,

486
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:19,692  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
one no one should
ever have to ask.

487
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:23,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio, l can
give you a life...

488
00:40:23,737 --> 00:40:27,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
other little boys
only dream of.

489
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:30,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is your decision, Geppetto?

490
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:50,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen to me.

491
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:55,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're going to go
with that man now.

492
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:58,899  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But l want to be with you.

493
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:00,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l know,

494
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:04,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but you see--you see,
there--there's no other choice.

495
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're my papa.

496
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,545  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l can't be your papa.

497
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,344  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're made of wood.

498
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:13,453  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're not flesh.
You're not a real boy.

499
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:16,651  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now go, for everyone's good!

500
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:26,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's go.

501
00:41:27,101 --> 00:41:28,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Son.

502
00:41:50,558 --> 00:41:52,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good boy.

503
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,537  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l love you, Papa.

504
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:23,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm sorry.

505
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why does everything good
get thrown to the beasts?

506
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ No to tyranny

507
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,135  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ He shall not have his pleasure

508
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:45,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ for goodness shall prevail

509
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:53,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

little pieces of gold.

510
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:02,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, Woody!

511
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ All the world is waiting

512

513
00:43:06,734 --> 00:43:08,292  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ No time for hesitating

517
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:15,970  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ lt's my call, that's my cue

00:43:16,143 --> 00:43:18,134  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ lt's everything or nothing

519
00:43:18,312 --> 00:43:20,803  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

524
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Puny peasants!

529
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, you up there

543
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:53,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

544
00:44:53,474 --> 00:44:56,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now this is all yours,
Pinocchio.

545
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:59,173  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

Get ready for the next scene.

550
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,522  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Champagne.

551
00:45:10,691 --> 00:45:13,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
OK, kiddo, now we're
in the swing of things.

552
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lesson number one--
beware of temptation.

553
00:45:16,397 --> 00:45:18,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Applause may be good
for the moment,

554
00:45:18,732 --> 00:45:20,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but love is everlasting.

555
00:45:20,534 --> 00:45:23,128  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l do have love.
Lorenzini loves me.

556
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,771  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's not love.
He's fooling you.

557
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:27,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's got evil plans
in the works,

558
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and he's using you
to make them come true.

559
00:45:29,843 --> 00:45:32,607  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why do you have to
make everything so hard?

560
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,179  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No pain, no gain.

561
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They love us.

562
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,620  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To success.

563
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:47,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait till they see
what l've got for them next.

564
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:55,966  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio, you're on.

565
00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:05,102  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ What are we made of?

566
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:08,942  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Can we know what we will be?

567
00:46:09,116 --> 00:46:11,744  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Whar are the chances

568
00:46:11,919 --> 00:46:15,650  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ l can find the better path

569
00:46:15,823 --> 00:46:17,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ The better life

570
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:20,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ The better me?

571
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:24,287  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ What are we made of?

572
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:27,127  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ lf you think you know the answer

573
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:30,896  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Turn arround

574
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:34,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Think again

575
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,340  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Carabonza!

576
00:46:37,511 --> 00:46:39,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ The fire-breathing monster

577
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,208  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Alas, we are undone

578
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,247  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stand by for fireworks.

579
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:10,906  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here's your proof, Pinocchio.

580
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:14,138  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is how much
Lorenzini loves you.

581
00:47:14,314 --> 00:47:16,305  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can save the others,
if you want.

582
00:47:21,388 --> 00:47:23,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is your chance, Pinocchio.

583
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:25,055  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can do what's right.

584
00:47:25,225 --> 00:47:27,489  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Those puppets are
your brothers and sisters.

585
00:47:27,661 --> 00:47:29,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop it.

586
00:47:29,563 --> 00:47:30,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Brilliant acting, Pinocchio.

587
00:47:30,964 --> 00:47:33,899  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Geppetto made them.
l won't let them burn.

588
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:34,965  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good work!

589
00:47:35,135 --> 00:47:37,660  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- No.
- Yes.

590
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ls it hot in here,
or is it me? Ciao!

591
00:48:18,278 --> 00:48:21,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come here, you little--

592
00:48:36,964 --> 00:48:38,022  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There.

593
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:40,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get him.

594
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:41,531  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Signor Lorenzini,

595
00:48:41,702 --> 00:48:44,136  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm sorry things
didn't quite work out.

596
00:48:44,304 --> 00:48:46,738  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't know. l think things
turned out rather well.

597
00:48:46,907 --> 00:48:49,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l guess you'll pay us
our commission now, huh?

598
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,167  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pay you?

599
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l will kill you if you don't
bring me that puppet.

600
00:48:59,486 --> 00:49:01,977  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l thought you were burned.

601
00:49:05,392 --> 00:49:06,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where's my Pinocchio?

602
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:20,329  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There he is! On the bridge!

603
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:23,933  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Grab him!

604
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:32,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ What are we made of?

605
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:35,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Just for this moment

606
00:49:35,322 --> 00:49:38,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Take your life
into your hands

607
00:49:39,092 --> 00:49:43,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ You'll decide
what you are made of

608
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:47,329  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ What it is that l can be

609
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:50,299  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Turn arround

610
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:53,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Think again

611
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio?

612
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, Leona

613
00:50:17,864 --> 00:50:19,058  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've been all over town.

614
00:50:19,232 --> 00:50:21,132  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So have l.
l hope you had more luck.

615
00:50:21,301 --> 00:50:22,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l asked Carmella
if she'd seen Pinocchio.

616
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:24,300  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She said no.

617
00:50:24,471 --> 00:50:25,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But then l went to see Tino.

618
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:26,898  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He said no.

619
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:28,701  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But then l went to see
Maria, the witch--

620
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:30,502  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the one who hasn't
spoken in years.

621
00:50:30,677 --> 00:50:32,907  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

622
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But... she gave me this.

623
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:37,407  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A stick?

624
00:50:37,584 --> 00:50:39,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's it mean?

625
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,844  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Think about it.

626
00:50:41,021 --> 00:50:43,251  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio probably feels like
he can't come home,

627
00:50:43,423 --> 00:50:45,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
like he'd only be
in trouble if he does.

628
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes...

629
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:50,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where would you go
if you felt that way?

630
00:50:50,497 --> 00:50:52,863  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l... don't know.

631
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:56,499  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Someplace safe.

632
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,501  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And where would that be,

633
00:50:58,672 --> 00:51:01,004  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
given the fact that
you're made out of wood?

634
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The forest.

635
00:51:05,245 --> 00:51:07,338  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you, Maria.

636
00:51:07,514 --> 00:51:09,846  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

637
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:24,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Smell that pine.

638
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:26,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know, they ought
to bottle that scent...

639
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,465  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
so you can spray it
arround your house.

640
00:51:28,635 --> 00:51:32,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Have l told you what an honor
it is to be your cricket?

641
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:35,299  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You were brilliant last night.

642
00:51:35,475 --> 00:51:37,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You stayed cool
when things got hot.

643
00:51:38,044 --> 00:51:41,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You did the right thing,
and you deserve to be proud.

644
00:51:41,248 --> 00:51:42,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is where l belong.

645
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:46,177  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know, l prefer
the beach myself,

646
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but property there
is so expensive.

647
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,891  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've gone back to your roots.

648
00:51:58,064 --> 00:52:00,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l know you feel lost, Pinocchio.

649
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:05,327  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Believe me, it's only natural,
but you can't stay here.

650
00:52:05,505 --> 00:52:06,904  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go away, please.

651
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:09,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l fell happy here.

652
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:11,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can't sleep
your problems away.

653
00:52:11,812 --> 00:52:13,336  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've got to get back
to your papa.

654
00:52:13,513 --> 00:52:14,502  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bye.

655
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:17,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We've got to roll.
Let's make tracks. Let's go!

656
00:52:17,317 --> 00:52:20,809  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Follow me! Off we go!

657
00:52:20,987 --> 00:52:22,579  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Run. Run. Run.

658
00:52:29,462 --> 00:52:30,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pepe?

659
00:52:42,175 --> 00:52:44,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where are you when l need you?

660
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Quit it!

661
00:52:56,323 --> 00:52:58,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Peck on someone your own size.

662
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:00,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''Let's get into
the puppet business,'' you said.

663
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:02,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- l never--
- Shut up!

664
00:53:02,529 --> 00:53:04,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- ''We'll be rich,'' you said.
- l didn't...

665
00:53:04,564 --> 00:53:07,465  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shut up. ''He's worth
a fortune,'' you said.

666
00:53:07,634 --> 00:53:09,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why do l always listen to you?

667
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:11,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get off!

668
00:53:12,138 --> 00:53:13,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go away.

669
00:53:13,373 --> 00:53:14,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who do you suppose
that might be?

670
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:16,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you serious?

671
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go away.

672
00:53:18,678 --> 00:53:19,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio!

673
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,456  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Out of my way.

674
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,102  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's put Lorenzini off
forjust a few more minutes.

675
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:32,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, l know you.

676
00:54:32,218 --> 00:54:33,947  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're friends with Lorenzini.

677
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,781  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're finished with him now.

678
00:54:35,956 --> 00:54:37,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- We're repugnant.
- Repentant.

679
00:54:38,091 --> 00:54:39,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, that, too.

680
00:54:40,994 --> 00:54:44,327  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And we're here to
ask for forgiveness.

681
00:54:44,497 --> 00:54:45,930  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's forgiveness?

682
00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:48,659  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Forgiveness means that when
you did something really wrong,

683
00:54:48,835 --> 00:54:51,167  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
you want somebody to tell you...

684
00:54:51,338 --> 00:54:52,532  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that it wasn't
really, really wrong,

685
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,368  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
when you know what you did
was wrong because you did it!

686
00:54:57,911 --> 00:55:00,573  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please forgive me
for being a puppet,

687
00:55:00,747 --> 00:55:04,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
instead of a real boy
for my papa.

688
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l miss my daddy, too.

689
00:55:08,688 --> 00:55:10,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know,
it is possible...

690
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:13,181  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for you to become a real boy.

691
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,089  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How?

692
00:55:15,261 --> 00:55:16,888  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All you need is a miracle.

693
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's a miracle?

694
00:55:18,431 --> 00:55:20,262  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A miracle is--

695
00:55:20,433 --> 00:55:22,401  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Miracles make your dreams
come true,

696
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,366  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and you could buy one...

697
00:55:24,537 --> 00:55:25,970  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
with enough of these.

698
00:55:26,139 --> 00:55:29,267  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look... l have four more.

699
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Very good.

700
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will you people be quiet!

701
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Unfortunately,
you're just a little short.

702
00:55:42,122 --> 00:55:45,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But you might have enough if...

703
00:55:45,492 --> 00:55:47,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf what?

704
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:50,291  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf you planted them
and let them grow.

705
00:55:50,463 --> 00:55:52,090  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where?

706
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why, in the field of miracles,
of course.

707
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:59,098  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The field of miracles.

708
00:56:01,007 --> 00:56:02,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Faster.

709
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:04,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Found the perfect spot.

710
00:56:04,811 --> 00:56:06,540  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop. That's deep enough.

711
00:56:06,713 --> 00:56:09,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now cover the hole
and let it cook.

712
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,146  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
For one hour.

713
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:11,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Exactly.

714
00:56:14,054 --> 00:56:15,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just keep going this way.

715
00:56:15,688 --> 00:56:17,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Leona, please, don't tell me
about the forest.

716
00:56:17,757 --> 00:56:19,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've been coming out here with
my brother, Enzio--

717
00:56:19,926 --> 00:56:21,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
may he rest in peace--
since l was a little boy.

718
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop.

719
00:56:31,671 --> 00:56:34,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was here.
Maybe he's not far off.

720
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:42,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now you stand here
and watch that clock.

721
00:56:42,415 --> 00:56:44,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The big hand will go
all the way around...

722
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:48,181  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and come back to the top,
and that's an hour.

723
00:56:48,354 --> 00:56:49,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Got it?

724
00:56:51,357 --> 00:56:52,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Got it.

725
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:31,892  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Our souls are like
a cup of cappuccino

726
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:33,623  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Strong and dark

727
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
@ Strong and dark

728
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Out of the woods, huh?
What are you doing now?

729
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watching the clock.

730
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why?

731
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,504  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So l can buy a miracle.

732
00:57:42,675 --> 00:57:44,643  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Any particular brand?

733
00:57:44,811 --> 00:57:47,541  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Real Boy brand.
Here's how it works--

734
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:50,444  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You dig a hole, you plant
your gold, you let it cook--

735
00:57:50,617 --> 00:57:53,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The first lesson about trust
is learning whom to trust.

736
00:57:53,286 --> 00:57:55,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Didn't this gold deal
seem a little shaky?

737
00:57:55,488 --> 00:57:56,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't know.

738
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,084  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A little.

739
00:57:58,258 --> 00:58:01,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And let me guess...
you ignored your instincts.

740
00:58:01,861 --> 00:58:03,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Didn't you?
- Maybe.

741
00:58:03,963 --> 00:58:08,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You just don't give maybe to the
president of the Cricket Union.

742
00:58:08,368 --> 00:58:11,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now, let's say we regroup
and talk about your papa.

743
00:58:11,804 --> 00:58:14,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Or l'll be falling down
on the job.

744
00:58:15,341 --> 00:58:18,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look, my papa wants me
to be a real boy.

745
00:58:18,978 --> 00:58:21,538  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm staying right here
and waiting for my miracle.

746
00:58:21,714 --> 00:58:25,582  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your papa want you,
no matter what you're made of.

747
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Be a loving son,

748
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,813  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and the real boy stuff
will take care of itself.

749
00:58:29,989 --> 00:58:32,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So remember,
you heard it here first.

750
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,622  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Miracles don't grow on trees.

751
00:58:35,795 --> 00:58:38,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Miracles are made in the heart.

752
00:59:02,222 --> 00:59:04,087  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stupid me!

753
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:07,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Miracles don't grow on trees.
Miracles don't grow on trees.

754
00:59:34,587 --> 00:59:36,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Woody!

755
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop!

756
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,585  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on. Come with us.

757
00:59:41,761 --> 00:59:43,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're going to
the greatest place.

758
00:59:43,563 --> 00:59:44,860  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's great. There's no school.

759
00:59:45,031 --> 00:59:46,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No rules.
You can do whatever you want.

760
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,059  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And it's just for boys.

761
00:59:49,235 --> 00:59:50,532  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just for boys?

762
00:59:50,703 --> 00:59:52,295  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yep. Real boys.

763
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look. Look. There he is.

764
01:00:14,661 --> 01:00:16,492  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where? l don't see him.

765
01:00:16,663 --> 01:00:17,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm sure.

766
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

Come on. Go.

876
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:32,170  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Run!

877
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,222  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get him!

878
01:10:56,635 --> 01:10:59,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l will break you
into firewood...

879
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:01,939  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
puppet!

880
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:05,442  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come here. Over here.

881
01:11:05,611 --> 01:11:09,172  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, this is all wrong.
You got to believe me.

882
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:10,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look, they're
trying to trick you.

883
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:12,881  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They wants us
to behave badly.

884
01:11:13,052 --> 01:11:14,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't go on the ride. Please!

885
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:16,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We've been acting
like jackasses,

886
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:18,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
so that's what we turn into.

887
01:11:18,724 --> 01:11:20,021  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, well, well...

888
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:25,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here l provide you with the most
wonderful place to frolic,

889
01:11:25,564 --> 01:11:28,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and this is the thanks l get?

890
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You steal my donkeys?

891
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:33,097  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They're not your donkeys.

892
01:11:33,272 --> 01:11:35,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This one's Lampwick.

893
01:11:40,112 --> 01:11:43,047  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio, a good boy does not
go around spreading lies.

894
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:45,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's not a lie.

895
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:47,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My nose grows when l lie.

896
01:11:47,653 --> 01:11:50,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, boys. Take the ride.

897
01:11:50,756 --> 01:11:52,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Drink the water.

898
01:11:52,758 --> 01:11:53,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, don't!

899
01:11:55,627 --> 01:11:57,288  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Be yourselves!

900
01:11:57,463 --> 01:11:59,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lampwick...

901
01:12:01,266 --> 01:12:02,494  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go on.

902
01:12:25,024 --> 01:12:26,491  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's turning into a monster.

903
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:30,055  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look at his face.

904
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:31,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lorenzini's turned
into a monster.

905
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:41,296  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lorenzini was a monster.

906
01:12:41,473 --> 01:12:44,704  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was a monster
and got what he deserved.

907
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:53,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Jackasses!

908
01:12:56,822 --> 01:12:58,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm going home.

909
01:13:00,325 --> 01:13:02,020  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thanks, Pinocchio.

910
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Home home home home!

911
01:13:20,212 --> 01:13:23,739  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't care if l never
become a real boy anymore.

912
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:26,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l just want
to get home to my papa.

913
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:29,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There you are.

914
01:13:33,559 --> 01:13:36,619  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l knew you didn't go out to sea.

915
01:13:36,795 --> 01:13:37,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where have you been?

916
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We were so worried,
and look at you.

917
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:41,825  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Have you eaten?

918
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,900  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're so skinny.

919
01:13:44,069 --> 01:13:45,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where is my papa?

920
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:52,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's out there somewhere,
looking for you.

921
01:13:55,481 --> 01:13:56,607  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait, Pinocchio!

922
01:13:56,782 --> 01:13:58,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's too dangerous.

923
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:08,686  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf you think
l'm going to wait...

924
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,260  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for both of you--

925
01:14:10,429 --> 01:14:12,624  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't even know how to swim.

926
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm not scared.

927
01:14:48,934 --> 01:14:50,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm not scared.

928
01:15:51,129 --> 01:15:54,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l smell seaweed.
Are--are we at the beach?

929
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:57,465  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pepe, l thought you left me.

930
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ahoy, captain.
Where are we now?

931
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:02,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Boy, you sure get
into a let of trouble.

932
01:16:02,574 --> 01:16:04,974  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know,
it smells an awful lot...

933
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:06,974  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
like rotten
chili peppers in here.

934
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:10,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lorenzini, he must be
the sea monster.

935
01:16:10,449 --> 01:16:11,381  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
OK. Fine. Enjoy yourself.

936
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:13,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm playing
cricket this afternoon.

937
01:16:14,119 --> 01:16:15,984  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, l'm a clamophobic.

938
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,451  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Quiet.

939
01:16:17,623 --> 01:16:19,147  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're in this together, now.

940
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:21,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But--but--but l'm
afraid of the dark.

941
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:23,893  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Papa!

942
01:16:24,062 --> 01:16:26,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, sure, like he's
just around the corner.

943
01:16:26,732 --> 01:16:27,664  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He might be.

944
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:30,893  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, you two had plans
to meet here for dinner?

945
01:16:31,069 --> 01:16:33,094  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Quiet.
- Sorry.

946
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:45,005  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me.

947
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Coming through.

948
01:16:55,727 --> 01:16:58,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf only it were true.

949
01:17:20,018 --> 01:17:21,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where were you?

950
01:17:30,996 --> 01:17:33,988  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's try to find
a way out of here.

951
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:35,258  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come.

952
01:17:35,434 --> 01:17:38,562  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt smells like
rotten chili peppers in here.

953
01:17:49,781 --> 01:17:51,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The throat.

954
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:54,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
hold on.
Pinocchio, hold on.

955
01:18:03,995 --> 01:18:05,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go, Pinocchio.

956
01:18:05,731 --> 01:18:07,062  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not without you.

957
01:18:07,232 --> 01:18:08,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go, l said.

958
01:18:08,567 --> 01:18:09,659  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No. Push it open.

959
01:18:09,835 --> 01:18:11,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l can't get through there.

960
01:18:11,503 --> 01:18:13,130  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now, do as l say!

961
01:18:30,255 --> 01:18:31,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l hate you, Papa.

962
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:34,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What?

963
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:37,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l never, ever missed you.

964
01:18:38,864 --> 01:18:39,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's a lie.

965
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:47,533  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l wish l never found you.

966
01:18:50,242 --> 01:18:51,539  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l never wanted to be your son.

967
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:53,701  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l want to stay a puppet.

968
01:18:53,879 --> 01:18:56,575  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lies, all lies.

969
01:19:48,099 --> 01:19:50,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don'tjudge my cooking
by this, OK?

970
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:13,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you OK, Papa?

971
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:20,220  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wake up.

972
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:38,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Forgive me, Pinocchio...

973
01:20:38,884 --> 01:20:41,978  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for doubting my heart
and letting you go.

974
01:20:44,789 --> 01:20:47,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm sorry, too, Papa.

975
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm sorry for not...

976
01:20:52,297 --> 01:20:54,424  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for not being a rea boy.

977
01:20:57,335 --> 01:21:00,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But you're real to me,
my son.

978
01:21:00,739 --> 01:21:02,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Real to me.

979
01:21:04,309 --> 01:21:05,776  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, l love you.

980
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:08,939  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l love you, too, Papa.

981
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:33,854  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm a boy.

982
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:35,932  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tell me it's true.

983
01:22:37,469 --> 01:22:39,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Miracles are made
in the heart, Papa.

984
01:22:45,977 --> 01:22:50,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yoo-hoo, hello.
l'm in the dark in here.

985
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:53,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What am l missing?
Have the pilgrims landed?

986
01:23:04,262 --> 01:23:06,321  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't even want
to know what happened.

987
01:23:06,498 --> 01:23:08,329  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Keep it to youself.

988
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nice to know you, junior.

989
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:11,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lots of luck.

990
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:14,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You look good in the flesh,
a real doll--uh, boy,

991
01:23:14,773 --> 01:23:16,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but l got to go. Ciao.

992
01:23:16,174 --> 01:23:17,368  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're leaving again?

993
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:19,339  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm just starting
to have a good time.

994
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:20,535  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Leaving?

995
01:23:20,712 --> 01:23:23,044  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That would make me
a hypo-cricket.

996
01:23:23,214 --> 01:23:25,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Union rules--
l'm with you forever.

997
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l just got to get some sleep.

998
01:23:32,457 --> 01:23:34,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Papa! Pap, stop the cart.

999
01:23:34,793 --> 01:23:36,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What?
- Please stop the cart.

1000
01:23:36,528 --> 01:23:37,859  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's just
one more little thing...

1001
01:23:38,029 --> 01:23:39,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l need to take care of.
lt'll only take a minute.

1002
01:23:44,536 --> 01:23:46,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm not going
to sleep in no barn.

1003
01:23:46,538 --> 01:23:48,005  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fine, then sleep
in the doghouse.

1004
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello.

1005
01:23:52,544 --> 01:23:55,308  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't you answer back
when a person greets you?

1006
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello.

1007
01:23:56,481 --> 01:23:58,210  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Haven't l seen you
somewhere before?

1008
01:23:58,383 --> 01:24:02,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No. Believe me,
l just got here.

1009
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That sure isn't very much gold
you've got there.

1010
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:08,221  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me, sonny. We're rich.

1011
01:24:08,393 --> 01:24:09,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's not rich.

1012
01:24:10,061 --> 01:24:11,653  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is rich.

1013
01:24:13,765 --> 01:24:15,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's nothing but a rock.

1014
01:24:15,834 --> 01:24:19,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, but if you take this road
five miles, there's a valley.

1015
01:24:19,571 --> 01:24:20,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've been there.

1016
01:24:20,739 --> 01:24:23,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Drinking the water
turns bad boys into donkeys.

1017
01:24:23,408 --> 01:24:24,466  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out of here.

1018
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:27,042  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fine, then l won't
tell you about the gold.

1019
01:24:27,212 --> 01:24:28,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gold?

1020
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:29,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Keep this to yourselves.

1021
01:24:30,081 --> 01:24:31,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf you drink the water
while holding onto a rock...

1022
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:32,580  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah?

1023
01:24:32,751 --> 01:24:33,775  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt turns into gold.

1024
01:24:33,952 --> 01:24:35,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gold?

1025
01:24:36,087 --> 01:24:37,384  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Would l lie?

1026
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:40,416  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bye.

1027
01:24:44,629 --> 01:24:46,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
See you later, Papa.

1028
01:24:46,197 --> 01:24:47,721  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio,
where are you going?

1029
01:24:47,899 --> 01:24:49,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To play with Lampwick.

1030
01:24:49,601 --> 01:24:51,967  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Did you do your studies
and all of your chores?

1031
01:24:52,137 --> 01:24:53,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, Papa.

1032
01:24:53,571 --> 01:24:56,267  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sometimes l wish
that nose still grew.

1033
01:24:56,441 --> 01:24:57,567  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lampwick.

1034
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:02,904  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, Woody, let's go.

1035
01:25:04,883 --> 01:25:06,248  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Careful!

1036
01:25:08,153 --> 01:25:09,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're--we're very sorry, sir.

1037
01:25:09,888 --> 01:25:11,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah. Let us pick these up.

1038
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:15,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Donn't you just hate that kid?
- Not as much as l hate you.

1039
01:25:17,462 --> 01:25:18,451  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Papa, Papa,

1040
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:20,427  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've got a great idea.

1041
01:25:20,598 --> 01:25:23,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How about carving me
a girlfriend?

1042
01:25:23,835 --> 01:25:25,735  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've been a boy two minutes,

1043
01:25:25,904 --> 01:25:27,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
already you're
thinking about girls?

1044
01:25:27,739 --> 01:25:30,970  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Am l going
to have trouble with you!

1045
01:25:36,414 --> 01:25:38,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And there you have it.

1046
01:25:38,283 --> 01:25:42,447  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Geppetto and Leona
lived happily ever after.

1047
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:44,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Luigi ate a lot of socks,

1048
01:25:44,856 --> 01:25:47,450  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and all the donkeys
turned back into boys.

1049
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:49,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt took some hard work.

1050
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:52,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They had to do many good deeds
to earn the privilege.

1051
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:55,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As for me,
l took a house on Lake Como...

1052
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:57,899  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and played canasta
with a couple of locusts.

1053
01:25:58,069 --> 01:25:59,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So, ciao, my little saplings.
Arrivederci!

1054
01:26:00,104 --> 01:26:02,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And when you need me,
give me a holler.

1055
01:26:03,074 --> 01:26:06,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll see if we can
arrange something.
