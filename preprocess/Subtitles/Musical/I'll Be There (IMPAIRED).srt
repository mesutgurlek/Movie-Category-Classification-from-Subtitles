Why did you tell her
that he didn't know about her?

319

00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,675
- Yes way.
- Oh, Jesus.

458
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,159
No, his mother
had a better excuse.

459
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,552
What...

460
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,392
Oh, wow.

461
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,074
That's roughly what I said.

462
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,357
Must be alike then.

463
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,437
[Chuckles]
Look, I'm sorry.

464
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,556
L-I don't really know what to say.

465
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,792
Do you, um, got any other kids?

466
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,519
Uh, no.

467
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,354
- You?
- I'm 16.

468
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,310
Oh, God, I can't take this.

469
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,356
<i>I should be inside.</i>

470
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,995
- I'm going in.
- Hey, you promised not to interfere.

471
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,072
- She's my kid.
- Yeah, she's his too.

472
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,116
Oh, God, this is so Greek.

473
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,154
So, uh, what are you up to? School?

474
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,755
Yeah. I'm gettin' ready to leave.

475
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,394
What about a dad?
Do you... I mean, that guy...

476
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,311
is he like your dad?

477
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,757
No. He's Mum's business partner.
He's gay.

Where's Paul Kerr?

480
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,915
Who are you, his sister?
His long-lost cousin?

481
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,229
I'm Dorise LeFanu.
His wife.

Forget Greek.
This is Jerry Springer.

483
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,029
Mum wants me to go
into the family business.

484
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,076
What's the family business?

485
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,516
Hairdressing.

486
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,189
Why did you try to kill yourself?

487
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,111
I didn't.
It was an accident.

488
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,156
Just nobody in here believes me.
They've sectioned me.

489
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,031
Darling! Ohh!

490
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,793
Oh, I'm sorry I took so long.
Did they hurt you?

491
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,472
Are you all right?

492
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,518
Don't worry, Mr Kerr.
We'll have you out of here in a jiffy.

493
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,672
- Mary?
- Oh!

494
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,990
It's his pet name for me.

495

It'll be okay.

497
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,276

498
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,750
<i>Impersonating a loony's wife
to help spring him from hospital.</i>

499
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,434
- Yes, I suspect that's highly illegal.
- Oh!

500
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,233
So we could have you arrested
for not arresting us.

501
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,471
- Don't start.
- Nobody will ever know.

502
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,438
<i>- Why did you do this?
- [Mary] What's that, then?</i>

503
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,909
You know.
Dress up with the...

504
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,275
and everything to get me
out of the hospital.

505
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,796
<i>You are valued as
part of our community.</i>

506
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,996
- Yeah, right.
- So don't go killing yourself again.

507
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,232
- Mmm! Apart from anything else,
it's against the law.
- It's illegal, see?

508
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,118
No, I won't.

509
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,078
Too many interesting
things happenin'.

510
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,230
Maybe later.

511

<i>Give me another whisky.</i>

512
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,237
What the hell is going on?

513
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,437
Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.
You'll wake Vince.

514
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,192
[Snoring]

515
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,191
If he doesn't get his nap,
he goes mental.

516
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,829
Never mind about that.
You can't light a fire in my driveway!

517
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,434
Well, you can't eat raw chicken.

518
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,796
It's only a little fire.
I'll make sure they clean it up.

519
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,914
I thought you were off playing
a gig in Uttoxeter tonight.

520
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,431
It was cancelled.
They put in a new karaoke machine.

521
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,831
Humph.

522
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,677
How did it feel...

523
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,876
meeting your dad
for the first time?

524
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,356
I didn't really feel anything.
No real connection.

525
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,556
I don't suppose we've got
a lot in common.

526
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,632
- Music.
- We didn't talk about music.

527
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,631
I was in there for five minutes.

528
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,029
You don't have to talk.

529
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:58,797
If you want to know what
a musician's about, listen to him play.

530
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,553
If you want to know

531
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,835
listen to his music.

532
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,308
What if I want him
to know about me?

- That sounds like a cop-out.

Hey, I didn't cop out.
He did.

You're a romantic, Olivia.

599

611
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,272
Looks like a gay sheep.

[Trilling]

613
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,831
Why Loch Ness?

614
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,911
I like it. It's quiet.

615
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,070
<i>You don't like quiet.
You're a drummer.</i>

616
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,789
You like big, noisy stages,
shrill women and loud pubs.

617
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,632
You're Australian, for God's sake.

618
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,917
All of that is true, mate, but I got
a bit tired of it. You know what I mean?

619
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,309
Being a rock star is all right
for a man in his 20s and 30s...

620
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,075
but I'm 43 years old.

621
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,549
I'd feel faintly ridiculous
being part of that world now.

622
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,875
Never thought I'd see the day.

623
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,350
Well, all right,
then why'd you move down here?

624
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,637
What's the best gig
we ever played?

625
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,234
Giants Stadium,
New York, 1989.

626
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,675
No, no.
Apart from that.

627
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,194
Ooh.

628
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,431
<i>- Harpoon Louie's.
- Harpoon Louie's. Yeah, in Cardiff.</i>

629
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,195
<i>- 1987. It's a 20-minute
bike ride from here.
- Yeah.</i>

630
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,159
So what? You're not gonna
play there again, are you?

631
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,516
Yeah. I don't even think
it's there any more.

632
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,388
I've always liked this place. I like this
part of the world, and I like it here.

633
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,550
I get peace to write music.

634
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,676
Peace to isolate, more like.
Nobody to bug you...

635
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,433
as you slowly
drink yourself to death.

636
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,353
Absolutely right, my good
Australian friend. Cheers.

637
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,752
I don't touch it any more, mate.
Been sober eight years.

638
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,599
Oh, no.

639
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,511
You're not one of them, are you?

640
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,989
- What, a poof?
- You know what.

641
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:23,119
A.A., 12 steps,
and banging a tambourine for Jesus.

642
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,475
Yeah. I'm A.A. All right, mate.

643
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,710
Don't have much to do
with Jesus, as a rule.

644
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,837
You haven't come here to convert me
to some born-again cult, have you?

645
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,356
You believe what you like, mate.
I'm here to help you get off the booze.

646
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,034
<i>- I don't wanna get off the booze.
- 'Course you do.</i>

647
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,116
That's why you drove your bike
through a window.

648
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,509
Oh, and by the way...

649
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:48,278
I oughta kick your ass for
killing an innocent motorcycle.

650
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,710
All right, look.

651
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,598
I'm not stoppin'.
I'm havin' one later, okay?

652
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,189
That's the ticket.
One day at a time.

653
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,589

Kum-ba-ya to you too.</i>

Those who do not recover
are people who cannot...

660
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,438
or will not completely give themselves
to this simple programme...

Yeah? Well, maybe it's time
you started the amends process, mate.

Hey, I got her pregnant and left her

How do you make amends
