MAN:
Maestro...

164
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,592
...would you like to select the bulls
for shipment to MeXico City?

165
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,602
Yes. Of course.

166
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:16,907
The bull is a little tired, huh?

Mario?

169
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:21,602
- I can't.
- Why not?

170
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,268
- Mother is out there.
- No, she isn't.

171
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,676
I just came through.

172
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:28,744
All right.

173
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:43,888
Mario.

174
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,890
Is that your lesson?

175
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:47,592
No, Mother. I'm sorry.

176
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,830
- What is it, then?
MARIA: It's entirely his own invention.

177
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:54,942
It comes into his ears in the field.
It comes out of his fingers on the piano.

178
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,069
It's as beautiful as a hundred butterflies.

179
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,781

What is it, Mario?

00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:12,882
MARIO: It disappeared.
Somebody has taken it.

188
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,114
- What?
- My music, the rhapsody, gone.

189
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,382
That's impossible, dear.

190
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,549
Well, then, where is it?

191
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:22,362
- In your room?
- I never kept it anywhere but here.

192
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:24,123
Do you know when you had it last?

193
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:26,631
Last Sunday, when Pepe was down
to see Maria.

194
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:29,396
She insisted that I play it for him.
All of it.

195
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,768
Then I put it back in the chest,
where it's always been, and now l...

- Hello, everybody.
MARIA: Hello, Daddy.

- Of course. Ah, ah, ah.

Hello, <i>mamacita.</i>

- Big news for you, Mario.
- Oh, really?

204
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,727
- Is it very beautiful, Father?
- Magnificent.

205

You know, Mario, it is eXactly my size.

MARIA: Your size?
MRS. MORALES: What are you talking about?

207

Mario's bullfighting costume, of course.

Uh, Father, Maria means the party dress
for her birthday.

210
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:16,382
Oh, that's all right, Mario.
The younger always comes first.

211
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:18,611
Younger? You are twins.

212
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,482
I'm older by 15 minutes.

213
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:22,317
- Fifteen minutes.
MRS. MORALES: Antonio...

214
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,652
...did you or did you not get the dress?
- Yes.

215
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:26,920
Of course.

216
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:28,996
It's a good moment
for your career, Mario.

217
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:33,658
You see, your measurements are eXactly
as mine were when I was your age.

218
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:35,827
We'll show them something tomorrow.

Antonio, I know Mario must fight
in this eXhibition tomorrow.

222
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:46,981
Of course. How else will Barrios know
he's good enough for MeXico City?

223
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,709
- Barrios?
- Is he really coming to see me fight?

224
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,648
- Certainly.
- Tomorrow's his birthday.

225
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,754
Now, Mother, don't worry.

226
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:57,119
Morales men,
they know how to handle bulls.

227
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:58,691
Have you picked your bull yet?

228
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:01,023
I was just about to leave when...

229
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,026
We're going now.

230
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,499
Are you ready, Maria?

231
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,830
I'll get my hat.

232
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:12,040
MARIO:
I'll be waiting.

233
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:19,704
That's quite a boy I've got there.

234
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:24,842
I wonder if you've ever forgiven me
for the fact that your first child was a girl.

235
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,989
Well, it was a shock.

236
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:30,018
But you made everything all right.

237
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,217
And immediately. Ha, ha.

238
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:34,889
You always make everything all right.

239
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:38,123
MARIA:
Mario, no, no! Please, Mario, no!

240
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,461
Tell me, where is my music? Where is it?

241
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:41,933
- I'll tell you.
- You promise?

242
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:44,004
- Yes, I promise.
- All right, where is it?

243
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:45,504
Mario.

- Oh!

(LAUGHING)

249
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:26,807
Miguel, what are you trying to do
to that bull?

250
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,551
What is the bull trying to do to Miguel?

251
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:33,313
- Ha, ha. I like that one.
- You do? That's good enough for me.

252
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:36,252
Maria's right. With him,
you'll put on a good show tomorrow.

253
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,017
He'll charge straight, you'll see.

254
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:42,960
He's got strong legs, good shoulders,
and his eyes are on fire. That's a true bull.

255
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:45,827
Isn't it wonderful
how much Chato knows about a bull?

256
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,798
How do you account for it, Maria?

257
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,232
Well, that's simple, Mario.

258
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:51,269
All you have to do is think like a bull.

259
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,806
Well, I'll see you later, Chato.

260
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:58,938
- You'll be over later, Maria?
- Yes.

261
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,508
(MARIO WHISTLES)

262
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:35,843
I'll be right back, Papa.

263
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:46,251
Now, suppose you tell me:

264
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,157
- Where have you been?
- Out of my mind.

265
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,696
Now you tell me:
Which way does the world go round?

266
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:52,060
This way or that way?

267
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,293
- Why?
- You're wrong. Today, it goes this way.

268
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:57,927
- And this way. And this way. Ha, ha.
- Oh, please, Mario.

269
00:20:58,206 --> 00:20:59,264
Now will you tell me?

270
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,409
When Pepe gets here,
we'll know everything.

271
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:03,476
And who did it? Who thought of it?

272
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:05,169
Maria. I'm telling you, she's...

273
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,714
- Oh, Mario, you're not telling me anything.
- Oh, she's so smart.

274
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:10,476
If it weren't for her, l...

275
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:13,519
Conchita, if I ever amount to anything
in this world...

276
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,919
...you know who'll be responsible.
- Maria.

277
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:17,581
Oh, Conchita, I'm not...

278
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,852
I know, darling, she's your twin.

279
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,120
But what happened?

280
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:24,754
Well, l... My music manuscripts disappeared.
Now, wait a minute.

281
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,195
I looked all over for them.

282
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,563
And when I was about to go crazy...

283
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:32,764
...I suddenly see Maria
smiling like a porcelain cat.

284
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:34,905
Do you know who has the music now?

285
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:36,510
No.

286
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,513
- MaXimino Contreras.
- The symphony conductor.

287
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:41,308
- That's right.
- Oh, Mario.

288
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:45,510
I wouldn't have the nerve to send my music
to a man like that. I couldn't.

289
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:49,817
But Maria, well, she just gave it to Pepe,
who's a friend of Contreras...

290
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:52,927
...and forced Pepe
to make Contreras play it.

291
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:56,087
- And I am scared to death.
- Oh, but it's good, Mario.

292
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:57,424
It's beautiful.

293
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,964
He's sure to like it.

294
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:01,898
Oh, I don't know. I can't believe it.

295
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:05,838
But if he does like it...

296
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:08,238
I mean, if Maria is right...

297
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,170
Conchita...

298
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:13,075
...you know that's what I live for.

299
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:17,910
That and this.

300
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,949
It's wrong. All wrong.

301
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:28,528
- Have you done something wrong again?
- No, I didn't.

302
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:32,565
And it is not necessary for me to think
like a bull to know where Mario went.

303
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:35,294
Oh, you're beginning to cackle
like an old hen.

304
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,836
Oh, I'm a hen now. Oh, right.

305
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:39,439
But let me tell you something.

306
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,168
You cannot fight a bull without rest.
You just can't.

307
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:46,041
Tomorrow is his birthday. His friends
wanna give him a little party, that's all.

308
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:47,806
A little party, how sweet.

309
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:50,918
Tonight, they give him a party.
Tomorrow, he gives them a party.

310
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:52,348
You know as well as I do...

311
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:55,752
...when he gets together
with those musicians, he stays out all night.

312
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:59,325
- He'll be all right tomorrow.
- Don't always defend him. It's all wrong.

313
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:02,691
With Señor Barrios coming all the way
from MeXico City to watch him.

314
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:05,230
It's a very important day, and...

315
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:08,301
No, I'm sorry.
This time, I will have to tell your father.

316
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,562
Oh, no, you won't.

- Why won't I?
- You know why.

318
00:23:11,406 --> 00:23:14,466
- Why?
- Because you never have and you never will.

319
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,873

Thank you, old goat.

Now I'm a goat.

334
00:24:35,624 --> 00:24:36,921
Hey, Maria.

335
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:39,822
All right, darling. Just a moment.

336
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,044
Ah, Pepe, I'm so glad to see you.

337
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,121
All day long, just one thought
has been running around my head:

338
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,019
When will Pepe get here? When?

339
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:13,093
Music, music to my ears.
Now let me tell you the big news.

340
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,819
- About Mario?
- No, about us.

341
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:17,658
You did take Mario's music
to Señor Contreras, didn't you?

342
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:21,563
- Yes, I did, but something came up...
- You don't think Mario's music is important?

343
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:23,966
- Did Contreras play it?
- Will you let me...?

344
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:27,131
Contreras must be a fool
if he doesn't like my brother's music.

345
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:30,369
Instead of conducting an orchestra,
he ought to be on the street...

346
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:33,742
...blowing a tin horn...
- Will you let me tell you what he said?

347
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:36,406
That's what I'm waiting for, darling.
What did he say?

348
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:37,609
Nothing.

349
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,550
Nothing? How could he possibly
say nothing?

350
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:43,850
- Play that music once, and...
- He played it more than once.

351
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:46,926
He played it over and over.
He got so eXcited he couldn't talk.

352
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:49,620
- Now, will you let me tell you...?
- I knew he'd love it.

353
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,858
Oh, that's wonderful.
He's gonna play it with his orchestra.

354
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:55,332
- He is, isn't it, Pepe?
- I don't know.

355
00:25:55,503 --> 00:25:58,165
He's coming tomorrow.
He's coming to see Mario personally.

356
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,776
Here? Oh, Pepe,
thank you for doing this for Mario.

357
00:26:01,943 --> 00:26:04,969
He'll be so happy. Oh, this is wonderful.

358
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,340
Now, will you...

359
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:10,177
...let me tell you something about us?
- Don't say a word to Mario. Not a word.

360
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:12,513
- What now?
- Well, don't you see?

361
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:16,350
Mario won't know anything about it.
Tomorrow will be like any other birthday.

362
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:18,788
And then, suddenly, someone comes to him
and says:

363
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,520
"Mario, there's a gentleman
to see you from MeXico City.

364
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:24,722
A Señor MaXimino Contreras,
about the music you sent him."

365
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:27,459
Oh, it will be the greatest moment
in Mario's life.

366
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:29,263
And in yours.

367
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:31,564
Yes, darling, it will.

368
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:33,204
Everything is Mario.

369
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,707
Mario and his music.
Mario and his bullfighting.

370
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:38,869
- Mario this. Mario...
- Darling, it's only natural. He's my twin.

371
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:41,481
I know that, but I'm marrying you.

372
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,049
All of you, but only you.

373
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:44,913
I like Mario. He's a wonderful guy.

374
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:48,021
He'll be the best brother-in-law
I ever had in my life.

375
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,453
But there's one thing
I want you to understand.

376
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:53,753
After we married, you're not gonna take
an aspirin every time he has a headache.

379
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:01,298
All right, now about us.

380
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:04,597
I received an offer
from the Institute of Research of New York.

381
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:08,231
- We're gonna have to live there for a year.
- Darling, that's wonderful.

382
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,672
But there's something else.

383
00:27:09,844 --> 00:27:11,436
I don't know when I have to leave.

384
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:13,877
We may not be able to wait months
to get married.

385
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,880
- It might be three weeks.
- Three weeks?

386
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,349
Maybe less time.
It depends on when they need me.

387
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,717
Well, darling, that sounds grand,
New York for a whole year, but...

388
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,949
Well, suppose Mario needs a...

389
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,253
Oh. Mario again.

390
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:29,657
What, darling?

391
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,390
The only time you seem to be happy
is when you're doing something for Mario.

392
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,503
Pepe, wait a moment. I'm sorry.

393
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:38,398
All right.

394
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,970
Will you leave on short notice
if we have to?

395
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:43,235
Any time you say.

396
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:51,175

397
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:53,048
- It's good to see you.
- Thank you.

398

- Hello, maestro, you're looking well.

404
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:15,409
Oh. The last time I saw you, Pepe,
you were terribly eXcited.

405
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:18,375
You were looking
for a very important bug.

406
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:21,947
- Well, have you found it?
- Not yet.

Why not?

408
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,113
Well, for one thing,
we don't know what it looks like.

409

But even if he did find it,
he wouldn't know what it looks like.

Yes, he wants you to be very proud
of him tomorrow.

to be proud of him tomorrow...

Do you remember the night
of Mario's birthday party?

747

would take Mario's music away from him...

748

...it would break his heart.

And yet you deliberately destroyed
the thing he loved.

752

761
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,842
...I was very happy, Antonio.

he wanted to.

763
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,147
For himself...

764
01:00:36,316 --> 01:00:39,547
...not to satisfy your pride.

765
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:42,249
That's very strange.

In 20 years...

767
01:00:44,257 --> 01:00:46,919
...in all the time I trained him...

768
01:00:47,293 --> 01:00:48,555
...you haven't said a word.

769
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,525
No, Antonio.

770
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,426
I didn't say anything
when you were fighting either.

771
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,466
But I lived only when you did not fight.

772
01:00:56,636 --> 01:00:58,661
Then in fear.

773
01:00:58,971 --> 01:01:01,940
Fear of what would happen
when you fought again.

774
01:01:02,642 --> 01:01:04,667
When, finally, you were hurt...

775
01:01:04,844 --> 01:01:07,938
...all of MeXico, yes, all of Spain, even...

776

...wept.

777
01:01:10,516 --> 01:01:12,677
I wept too.

778

Mine were tears of relief...

779
01:01:16,723 --> 01:01:19,055
...you'd never fight again.

780
01:01:20,554 --> 01:01:23,455
And now Mario will never fight again.

781
01:01:24,391 --> 01:01:27,519
And for that, I am very thankful.

782

in my room when he comes home.

MORALES: He'll be back.

791
01:02:07,968 --> 01:02:10,300
The moment he's hungry, he'll be home.
Don't worry.

792
01:02:10,471 --> 01:02:11,495
No, father.

793
01:02:11,672 --> 01:02:13,765
I'm going to find him somehow.

794
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:15,875
I forbid you.

795
01:02:16,043 --> 01:02:19,809
Maria, do you understand
that you are to stay home?

796
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,538
I'll go with you, Maria.

797
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:24,678
Do you understand?

798
01:02:24,852 --> 01:02:27,343
You are not to leave.

799
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:36,962
Whenever you want to start, Maria,
I'm ready.

800
01:02:37,131 --> 01:02:38,996
Well, wait a minute.
Where are you going?

801
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:42,829
Start where? If Mario wanted to be here,
you wouldn't have to look for him.

802
01:02:43,003 --> 01:02:45,437
If he insists on staying away,
you'll never find him.

803
01:02:45,606 --> 01:02:48,507
A needle in a haystack
is not hard to find...

804
01:02:48,676 --> 01:02:50,075
...if you have a magnet.

805
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:52,178
They can't call Mario a coward.

806
01:02:52,346 --> 01:02:55,406
- I'm gonna demand they print the truth.
- They don't know the truth.

807
01:02:55,582 --> 01:02:57,777
They would question your father.

808
01:02:57,951 --> 01:02:59,111
I don't care.

809
01:02:59,286 --> 01:03:00,981
They've got to take it back.

810
01:03:01,155 --> 01:03:03,919
A Morales is not a coward.

811
01:03:07,328 --> 01:03:08,556
I'll prove it to them.

812
01:03:08,729 --> 01:03:10,492
PEPE: Maria.
- Yes, I'll prove it to them.

813
01:03:10,664 --> 01:03:13,098
I'll go see Barrios.
He'll give me a chance to fight.

814
01:03:13,534 --> 01:03:14,660
- You will not.
MARIA: Why not?

815
01:03:14,835 --> 01:03:16,962
Why not? What about us?

816
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:20,470
You think that would bring Mario home?

817
01:03:20,641 --> 01:03:22,939
- Maybe.
- No, just the opposite.

818
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:25,874
If you fight, it doesn't prove
your brother is not a coward.

819
01:03:26,046 --> 01:03:27,536
You'd only make it worse.

820
01:03:27,715 --> 01:03:30,946
It would seem you were doing something
your brother was afraid to do.

821
01:03:31,118 --> 01:03:34,087
It would be a disgrace for Mario.
He'd never be able to return.

822
01:03:34,722 --> 01:03:36,986
Can't you see
I'm telling you the truth, darling?

823
01:03:38,225 --> 01:03:40,090
We'll find Mario. I promise you.

824
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:44,026
That's right. It is not the name of Morales
that has to be cleared.

825
01:03:44,198 --> 01:03:46,393
It's Mario's.

826
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:48,728
Only he can do it.

827
01:03:49,336 --> 01:03:50,928
Yes.

828
01:03:51,105 --> 01:03:53,130
Only Mario.

829
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:06,442
No, no, not the good ones.
Give me the bad ones.

830
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,646
I understand.
Everybody buys the bad ones.

831
01:04:09,823 --> 01:04:12,519
Mario Morales. I can't wait.

832
01:04:12,693 --> 01:04:14,593
The promoter had better lock the gate.

833
01:04:14,762 --> 01:04:18,425
Yeah. Maybe Morales
will jump over the wall today.

834
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:21,597
Your public seems to be
a little temperamental.

835
01:04:21,769 --> 01:04:24,863
Oh, don't worry.
They're just in a playful mood.

836
01:04:25,038 --> 01:04:26,869
Yes, I see.

837
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:30,601
I wouldn't want to see damage done
to your magnificent establishment.

838
01:04:30,778 --> 01:04:33,747
So say, perhaps, we would call off
this engagement.

839
01:04:33,914 --> 01:04:35,313
Are you crazy?

840
01:04:35,482 --> 01:04:38,679
Call off the most profitable day
I have had in five years?

841
01:04:38,852 --> 01:04:40,717
- Yes.
- Come, old man. Get your man ready.

842
01:04:40,888 --> 01:04:43,083
Yes, I think, uh...

843
01:04:50,297 --> 01:04:51,992
There.

844
01:04:58,205 --> 01:05:00,173
Please, Maria, don't go through with this.

845
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,001
We can find him some other way.

846
01:05:02,176 --> 01:05:03,905
We could advertise in the newspapers.

847
01:05:04,077 --> 01:05:07,478
There's one way to find Mario.
When he reads the papers and finds out...

848
01:05:07,648 --> 01:05:11,015
...somebody is fighting under his name...
- I know, but it's so dangerous.

849
01:05:11,185 --> 01:05:14,643
- Lf anything should happen to you...
- Will you please stop saying that?

850
01:05:14,822 --> 01:05:16,187

Oh, no, not so big.

854
01:05:31,305 --> 01:05:34,274
You know, Maria,
I've had the most wonderful idea.

855
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:37,274
- What?
- In Monterrey, I have many relatives.

856
01:05:37,444 --> 01:05:42,245
If we went there right away, we could
get them to start looking all over for Mario.

857
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:47,082
If you're in a hurry to see your relatives,
you can leave right now.

858
01:05:47,488 --> 01:05:51,049
I made a mistake. I should never
have let you talk me into this.

859
01:05:51,225 --> 01:05:52,385
It's crazy.

860
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,687
If anything happens,
how could I ever answer for this?

861
01:05:55,863 --> 01:05:59,594
Not only to your father, but to myself.

862

to bring Mario back. This way.

It's my responsibility.

865
01:06:10,444 --> 01:06:13,106
It isn't fair to ask you to share it.

866
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,611
What?

867
01:06:14,781 --> 01:06:17,181
To let you go down there alone?

868

Come.

869
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:21,648
It's bad luck to be late.

870
01:06:29,229 --> 01:06:31,129
I'll wait outside.

871
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,511

You know, Chato,
there's one thing worrying me.

What's that?

Before it's too late. Please.

They don't need to worry.

01:07:57,184 --> 01:07:59,448
The only way I'll go out
is to be carried out.

not because he thought you were right.

01:15:45,085 --> 01:15:46,177
I'm not hungry.

949
01:15:46,352 --> 01:15:48,877
The bus ride bumped his stomach. Ha, ha.

950
01:15:50,457 --> 01:15:53,017
Is that music coming all the way
from the United States?

951
01:15:53,193 --> 01:15:54,251
Oh, no, señor.

952
01:15:54,427 --> 01:15:56,793
That is our symphony orchestra
in MeXico City.

953
01:15:57,363 --> 01:15:59,831
With Maestro
MaXimino Contreras conducting.

954
01:15:59,999 --> 01:16:01,432
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

955
01:16:03,103 --> 01:16:06,231
I'm afraid, uh, Pancho isn't very fond
of music.

956
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:09,704
And I am afraid you have
the wrong impression of my country.

957
01:16:09,876 --> 01:16:12,174
Not everyone in MeXico
appreciates music.

958
01:16:12,345 --> 01:16:13,642
Many prefer bullfighting.

959
01:16:13,813 --> 01:16:16,043
MAN (ON RADIO):
<i>The final selection of today's concert...</i>

960
01:16:16,216 --> 01:16:17,513
<i>... will be "Fantasia Mexicana"...</i>

961
01:16:17,684 --> 01:16:21,211
<i>... the work of a young Mexican composer,</i>
<i>Mario Morales.</i>

962
01:16:21,387 --> 01:16:24,982
<i>It is being introduced today</i>
<i>for the first time to the people of Mexico...</i>

963
01:16:25,158 --> 01:16:28,491
<i>... by Maestro Maximino Contreras.</i>

(CROWD CHEERING)

967
01:21:32,465 --> 01:21:33,591
Wait a minute, Pancho.

968
01:21:33,766 --> 01:21:36,234
The radio said it was being played
for the first time.

969
01:21:36,402 --> 01:21:39,428
- Now, you told me...
- Don't get the wrong impression, señor.

970
01:21:39,605 --> 01:21:42,165
Not everyone in MeXico
lives only for bullfighting.

971
01:21:42,341 --> 01:21:44,832
- Just as many prefer music.
- Hmm?

972
01:21:45,178 --> 01:21:47,476
Wait! Wait!

973
01:21:54,454 --> 01:21:56,285
No, no, señor. You must not enter.

974
01:21:56,456 --> 01:21:59,152
He is busy. He will see no one.

975
01:21:59,325 --> 01:22:01,555
(PLAYING PIANO THEN STOPS)

976
01:22:03,196 --> 01:22:04,424
Mario!

977
01:22:04,897 --> 01:22:07,593
I'm sorry, señor.
He would not give his name.

978
01:22:07,767 --> 01:22:10,065
You may go.
Mario, so you heard it, huh?

979
01:22:10,236 --> 01:22:11,294
Yes.

980
01:22:11,471 --> 01:22:13,803
Oh, I knew it.
I knew it was the only way.

981
01:22:13,973 --> 01:22:15,804
I had to come, maestro, to thank you.

982
01:22:15,975 --> 01:22:17,909
It was... Well, I have no words.

983
01:22:18,077 --> 01:22:21,171
It didn't sound like my music at all.
It was so big.

984
01:22:21,347 --> 01:22:22,814
Oh, of course it was.

985
01:22:22,982 --> 01:22:26,008
Mario, when your sister told me
that she had a way to find you...

986
01:22:26,185 --> 01:22:29,348
...I said to myself, there is only one way
to bring him back.

987
01:22:29,522 --> 01:22:30,921
And it worked.

988
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:33,058
Now, my boy,
we'll get down to business.

989
01:22:33,226 --> 01:22:34,591
To study music.

990
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:37,320
- Of course, no more bullfighting.
- No.

991
01:22:37,497 --> 01:22:39,055
No, I'm all through with that.

992
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:42,668
Fine. You know, my boy,
it was very foolish of you.

993
01:22:42,835 --> 01:22:44,666
- You don't understand...
- No, no, please.

994
01:22:44,837 --> 01:22:46,498
You have nothing to eXplain.

995
01:22:46,672 --> 01:22:49,004
I know it was your father.
Anyway, it was foolish.

996
01:22:49,175 --> 01:22:51,666
Why risk your life
just to prove to some people...

997
01:22:51,844 --> 01:22:54,438
...who read the sporting news
that you are not a coward?

998
01:22:54,614 --> 01:22:56,241
It's ridiculous.

999
01:22:56,415 --> 01:22:59,282
Of course, now, after you had
your big success at La Scala...

1000
01:22:59,452 --> 01:23:02,580
...and you're a hero in your father's eyes,
everybody's happy.

1001
01:23:02,755 --> 01:23:05,918
Don't eXplain to me
and don't argue with me.

1002
01:23:06,092 --> 01:23:08,617
This foolishness is over once and forever.

1003
01:23:08,794 --> 01:23:11,160
You must not risk your life again.

1004
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:13,457
Uh, and I insist
that you cancel your engagement...

1005
01:23:13,633 --> 01:23:15,123
...you have to fight at Puebla.

1006
01:23:15,868 --> 01:23:18,962
I don't know what you're talking about,
Señor Contreras.

1007
01:23:19,138 --> 01:23:20,765
I didn't fight in La Scala.

1008
01:23:21,207 --> 01:23:23,141
And I am not fighting in Puebla.

1009
01:23:23,309 --> 01:23:24,537
I'm not.

1010
01:23:24,710 --> 01:23:25,768
Now, wait, my boy.

1011
01:23:25,945 --> 01:23:29,381
We can't get along unless we are
really frank and honest to each other.

1012
01:23:29,549 --> 01:23:31,517
Come. I'll show you.

1013
01:23:36,122 --> 01:23:37,282
Oh, here.

1014
01:23:37,456 --> 01:23:38,855
Here.

1015
01:23:42,061 --> 01:23:44,427
- EXcuse me.
- Where do you think you are going?

1016
01:23:44,597 --> 01:23:45,791
Well, it's obvious, señor.

1017
01:23:45,965 --> 01:23:48,798
If someone is using my name,
I have the right to...

1018
01:23:51,137 --> 01:23:54,504
Did you say my sister told you
she had a plan to find me?

1019
01:23:54,674 --> 01:23:55,834
Yes.

1020
01:23:56,008 --> 01:23:57,999
- I must go.
- Wait! Mario...

1021
01:23:58,177 --> 01:23:59,405
Oh, he runs away again.

1022
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:02,275
Oh, I'll chase this boy
to my appointments.

1023
01:24:02,448 --> 01:24:04,541
Mario, wait!

1024
01:24:04,817 --> 01:24:07,308
No. Maria, please.

1025
01:24:07,486 --> 01:24:09,113
Please stop being so nervous.

1026
01:24:09,288 --> 01:24:10,915
MARIA:
I can't understand it.

1027
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:13,684
Mario's name has been in every newspaper
for two weeks.

1028
01:24:13,859 --> 01:24:15,884
Today's fight has been announced
all over.

1029
01:24:16,062 --> 01:24:17,893
- He must have seen it.
- He'll be here.

1030
01:24:18,064 --> 01:24:20,498
He'll be here. Don't worry, please.

1031
01:24:20,666 --> 01:24:21,690
Sit down.

1032
01:24:21,867 --> 01:24:23,164
(PHONE RINGS)

1033
01:24:23,336 --> 01:24:25,804
- It's Mario. Mario.
- Mario.

1034
01:24:26,706 --> 01:24:29,607
Darling. Where are you?

1035
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:32,468
Pepe.

1036
01:24:32,645 --> 01:24:34,078
Where are you?

1037
01:24:34,246 --> 01:24:36,510
Where do you think?
I'm downstairs in the lobby.

1038
01:24:36,682 --> 01:24:38,240
How did you know I was here?

1039
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:42,080
Darling, all I had to do was find out
where Mario is staying and I'd find you.

1040
01:24:42,955 --> 01:24:46,118
Oh, no, no, Pepe,
you can't come up here.

1041
01:24:46,325 --> 01:24:48,691
Mario is not feeling well.

1042
01:24:48,861 --> 01:24:50,726
Mario isn't feeling very well, Pepe.

1043
01:24:50,896 --> 01:24:53,626
He's very nervous.

1044
01:24:53,799 --> 01:24:55,960
He's not seeing anybody.

1045
01:24:56,135 --> 01:24:59,298
No, no, he's just tired.

1046
01:24:59,639 --> 01:25:01,504
Darling, I'll come right down.

1047
01:25:01,674 --> 01:25:03,574
Yes, yes, I promise. Right away.

1048
01:25:03,743 --> 01:25:05,540
No, you can't. I won't allow you.

1049
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:07,576
Chato, I have to. He can't come up here.

1050
01:25:07,747 --> 01:25:09,578
You've got to get dressed, Maria.

1051
01:25:09,749 --> 01:25:12,183
- What are you going to tell him?
- I don't know.

1052
01:25:12,351 --> 01:25:16,151
- Nothing. Nothing.
CHATO: Good. I'll tell it to him with you.

1053
01:25:24,897 --> 01:25:27,627
Darling. Ha, ha.

1054
01:25:29,468 --> 01:25:32,369
What happened to you?
I could've lost my mind waiting for you.

1055
01:25:32,538 --> 01:25:36,030
- Darling, I'm so sorry. You see, it was...
- All right, you found her now.

1056
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:38,005
Kiss her and say goodbye.

1057
01:25:38,177 --> 01:25:39,576
Mario needs her.

1058
01:25:39,745 --> 01:25:40,973
He's very nervous.

1059
01:25:41,147 --> 01:25:43,081
I'm nervous too.

1060
01:25:43,249 --> 01:25:44,273
- Guess what.
- What?

1061
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:48,216
I received my appointment with the Institute
of Research, New York. It's ours.

1062
01:25:48,387 --> 01:25:50,651
Look. Telegrams,
documents, airplane tickets.

1063
01:25:50,823 --> 01:25:53,189
We leave tomorrow morning at 6:00.

1064
01:25:53,993 --> 01:25:57,292
- Oh, no, Pepe. We can't.
- No.

1065
01:25:58,230 --> 01:25:59,492
Why not?

1066
01:26:00,433 --> 01:26:03,095
Well, to begin with,
we're not even married.

1067
01:26:03,269 --> 01:26:04,759
Yes.

1068
01:26:06,072 --> 01:26:08,267
That's why I came.
I've got that arranged too.

1069
01:26:08,441 --> 01:26:10,432
- Come on.
- No.

1070
01:26:11,610 --> 01:26:13,407
- Did you say something?
- Who? L...

1071
01:26:13,579 --> 01:26:14,978
Did I say something?

1072
01:26:15,147 --> 01:26:16,171
No.

1073
01:26:16,348 --> 01:26:18,213
Darling, I know that I promised, but l...

1074
01:26:18,384 --> 01:26:21,615
I tell you,
Mario is more nervous than ever.

1075
01:26:21,787 --> 01:26:24,255
He wouldn't fight if she wouldn't...

1076
01:26:27,426 --> 01:26:29,485
I knew the test
would come one day, Maria...

1077
01:26:29,662 --> 01:26:31,653
...somehow or another.

1078
01:26:32,198 --> 01:26:33,825
After everything we'd planned...

1079
01:26:33,999 --> 01:26:35,933
...for a lifetime.

1080
01:26:36,235 --> 01:26:39,636
Against one afternoon
of watching your brother fight a bull.

1081
01:26:47,012 --> 01:26:49,344
You say you have everything arranged?

1082
01:26:49,515 --> 01:26:50,880
PEPE:
Yes, darling.

1083
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:52,642
Everything.

1084
01:26:52,852 --> 01:26:54,820
All right, darling.

1085
01:26:56,021 --> 01:26:58,148
There's just one thing, Pepe.

1086
01:26:58,324 --> 01:27:01,418
You've got to get me back here
by 3:00.

1087
01:27:01,727 --> 01:27:02,989
What for?

1088
01:27:03,162 --> 01:27:04,857
You've got to, Pepe.

1089
01:27:05,297 --> 01:27:06,992
PEPE:
To see your brother?

1090
01:27:07,566 --> 01:27:09,864
Whose honeymoon is this gonna be?

1091
01:27:10,035 --> 01:27:11,866
Will you, Pepe?

1092
01:27:13,439 --> 01:27:14,997
All right.

1093
01:27:16,075 --> 01:27:19,374
- Tell Mario I'll be back at 3:00.
- Yes.

1094
01:27:19,545 --> 01:27:21,012
Come on.

1095
01:27:42,701 --> 01:27:43,998
Chato, I want you to meet...

1096
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:48,266
...Señora Maria Morales Jose Fernandez
Hector Sanchez Tello Giermillo Ortego.

1097
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,305
Yes, yes, yes. Now hurry, hurry.

1098
01:27:50,476 --> 01:27:52,671
Mario is very nervous.

1099
01:27:52,845 --> 01:27:54,039
You won't be able to stay.

1100
01:27:54,213 --> 01:27:55,771
Just pack your things.

1101
01:27:55,948 --> 01:27:58,781
MARIA: Yes, darling, I know.
PEPE: Hurry.

1102
01:27:59,218 --> 01:28:01,778
Uh, Pepe, you wait for her here.

1103
01:28:01,954 --> 01:28:04,616
- But I wanna see Mario.
- No.

1104
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:06,621
If anything should happen, don't worry.

1105
01:28:06,792 --> 01:28:09,226
- Maria will meet you at the entrance.
- What entrance?

1106
01:28:09,395 --> 01:28:13,024
In case you miss her at the entrance,
she will meet you at this seat.

1107
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:14,496
Wait, why should I miss her?

1108
01:28:14,667 --> 01:28:18,694
- I don't wanna see the bullfight.
- Don't worry. From that seat, you won't.

1109
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:26,573
The number of my son's suite.

1110
01:28:26,745 --> 01:28:28,269
Your son?

1111
01:28:28,447 --> 01:28:30,938
Mario Morales, the torero.

1112
01:28:31,183 --> 01:28:32,707
Don Antonio.

1113
01:28:32,885 --> 01:28:34,318
I beg your pardon, señor.

1114
01:28:34,486 --> 01:28:37,011
- Suite 401403.
- Thank you.

1115
01:28:37,189 --> 01:28:38,486
For nothing, señor.

1116
01:28:43,462 --> 01:28:45,054
Pepe.

1117
01:28:45,431 --> 01:28:49,060
- Oh, hello, maestro.
- Why are you not upstairs with Mario?

1118
01:28:49,235 --> 01:28:50,634
He won't see me.

1119
01:28:50,803 --> 01:28:52,430
He won't see anybody eXcept Maria.

1120
01:28:52,605 --> 01:28:56,200
- Why not?
- I don't know. He says he's nervous.

1121
01:28:56,508 --> 01:28:58,373
We'll fiX that.

1122
01:28:58,544 --> 01:29:01,809
You know, Pepe, Mario and I,
we had a little misunderstanding.

1123
01:29:01,981 --> 01:29:04,973
But he's young.
He would not come to me...

1124
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:08,347
...so I'll go to him.

1125
01:29:13,025 --> 01:29:14,856
MAN 1: Señor Morales.
MAN 2: Señor Morales.

1126
01:29:15,027 --> 01:29:18,155
- We need your help.
- Please help us to get some pictures.

1127
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:21,527
- Would you help us get some pictures?
- We've been here for two hours.

1128
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:22,724
Leave it to me.

1129
01:29:22,902 --> 01:29:27,339
Just give me a few minutes with my son,
alone, and it'll be all right.

1130
01:29:28,274 --> 01:29:29,605
(KNOCKING)

1131
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:35,944
- So.
- Maestro, I, uh...

1132
01:29:36,115 --> 01:29:37,605
Please tell my son I'm here.

1133
01:29:37,783 --> 01:29:40,650
- Tell him we're here a long time.
- Yeah.

1134
01:29:40,819 --> 01:29:43,788
Yes, yes. Just a moment, please.

1135
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,752
- What's happened now?
- Your father and Pepe are outside.

1136
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:53,956
Hurry, Conchita.
We've gotta get out of here.

1137
01:29:54,133 --> 01:29:56,033
Where's Mario? Why didn't he come?

1138
01:29:56,201 --> 01:29:59,568
Did you hear what I said?
Your father and Pepe are outside that door.

1139
01:29:59,738 --> 01:30:01,933
If your father finds out, he'll kill me.

1140
01:30:02,107 --> 01:30:03,734
If he doesn't, Pepe will.

1141
01:30:03,909 --> 01:30:05,035
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1142
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:07,906
MORALES:
Chato. Mario.

1143
01:30:08,547 --> 01:30:10,708
Quick. Quick.

1144
01:30:11,016 --> 01:30:12,449
Hurry.

1145
01:30:16,455 --> 01:30:19,686
It's crazy.
It's been crazy from the beginning.

1146
01:30:21,427 --> 01:30:23,520
I've had enough of this nonsense, Chato.

1147
01:30:23,696 --> 01:30:26,665
- Get out of the way.
- No. If you please, just a few minutes.

1148
01:30:26,832 --> 01:30:28,322
Oh, he's so nervous.

1149
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,730
Everybody's nervous before a fight.

1150
01:30:30,903 --> 01:30:32,928
- Step aside.
- No, no, please, not yet.

1151
01:30:33,105 --> 01:30:35,005
- We gotta have pictures.
- Who does he think he is?

1152
01:30:35,174 --> 01:30:37,074
Please, gentlemen. Please be patient.

1153
01:30:37,242 --> 01:30:39,301
I'll see if he's, uh...

1154
01:30:39,478 --> 01:30:41,810
I'll see if he's still praying.

1155
01:30:44,049 --> 01:30:46,574
You would think
that he was the boy's father.

1156
01:30:46,752 --> 01:30:48,413
Wait until I get him home.

1157
01:30:48,587 --> 01:30:51,454
- About 4:00.
- The fight will be starting soon.

1158
01:30:51,623 --> 01:30:54,285
Maybe he isn't
going to fight today either.

1159
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:55,757
What do you think, maestro?

1160
01:30:55,928 --> 01:30:57,259
Oh, this is too much.

1161
01:30:57,429 --> 01:31:00,330
Chato. Mario. Open the door.

1162
01:31:00,499 --> 01:31:02,228
You hear me?

1163
01:31:15,581 --> 01:31:17,446
But it's impossible. L...

1164
01:31:17,616 --> 01:31:19,345
I didn't...

1165
01:31:19,718 --> 01:31:22,983
All I wanted is to give him my sword.

1166
01:31:23,155 --> 01:31:24,486
(PLAYING TRUMPET)

1167
01:31:35,067 --> 01:31:37,797
- Lf Mario doesn't come out...
- Please. We'll find Mario.

1168
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:40,837
You stop looking around
while you're working the bull.

1169
01:31:47,913 --> 01:31:50,211
Watch the bull, please.

1170
01:31:55,087 --> 01:31:57,146
All right. Go now.

1171
01:32:03,929 --> 01:32:05,294
(CROWD CHEERING)

1172
01:32:33,792 --> 01:32:34,952
She must be inside.

1173
01:32:35,127 --> 01:32:37,925
Well, go in there and find her. Go ahead.

1174
01:32:38,097 --> 01:32:40,463
You're making me nervous.

1175
01:32:53,011 --> 01:32:55,206
Mario, wait!

1176
01:33:03,255 --> 01:33:04,688
- Ticket?
CONTRERAS: I don't have any.

1177
01:33:04,857 --> 01:33:06,950
Ticket over there, please.

1178
01:33:07,726 --> 01:33:11,162
- Oh, no, my friend.
- I don't consider myself your friend.

1179
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:13,560
And then, please,
would you kindly step aside?

1180
01:33:13,732 --> 01:33:18,328
Go back to scraping on your fiddle.
You will not interfere with my son again.

1181
01:33:18,504 --> 01:33:21,098
Step aside, please.
Let the gentlemen buy his ticket.

1182
01:33:21,273 --> 01:33:22,740
You are mistaken on two counts.

1183
01:33:22,908 --> 01:33:25,934
He's not a gentleman
and he's not going to buy a ticket.

1184
01:33:26,111 --> 01:33:29,080
Señor, will you kindly
have this person removed?

1185
01:33:29,248 --> 01:33:30,374
Call the police.

1186
01:33:30,549 --> 01:33:33,109
CONTRERAS: See to my rights.
- What seems to be the trouble?

1187
01:33:33,285 --> 01:33:35,446
- Look, l...
- I'll do the eXplaining.

1188
01:33:35,621 --> 01:33:36,849
I am Don Antonio Morales.

1189
01:33:37,022 --> 01:33:39,650
Don Antonio.

1190
01:33:39,825 --> 01:33:41,656
Is this criminal annoying you, maestro?

1191
01:33:41,827 --> 01:33:45,024
Criminal? I am MaXimino Contreras
of the National Symphony Orchestra.

1192
01:33:45,197 --> 01:33:48,963
Maestro. Is this broken-down bullfighter
annoying you?

1193
01:33:49,134 --> 01:33:52,194
No. You'll address the greatest matador
of all times with respect.

1194
01:33:52,371 --> 01:33:55,602
You will address the greatest musician
in MeXico with reverence.

1195
01:33:55,774 --> 01:33:59,005
- He wants to stop my son from fighting.
- We won't let him.

1196
01:33:59,178 --> 01:34:01,476
It's against the law
to prevent a man from buying a ticket.

1197
01:34:01,647 --> 01:34:03,638
It's against the law
to interfere with a bullfight.

1198
01:34:03,815 --> 01:34:05,715
You can't prove
that he intends to interfere.

1199
01:34:05,884 --> 01:34:07,511
All right.
We'll go see the captain.

1200
01:34:07,686 --> 01:34:08,880
- He'll settle this.
- Good.

1201
01:34:09,054 --> 01:34:10,646
But I have to get in, please.

1202
01:34:10,822 --> 01:34:13,416
Yes. Yes. Let's see the captain.
He'll settle this.

1203
01:34:13,592 --> 01:34:15,389
- Come, señores.
- Good.

1204
01:34:22,668 --> 01:34:24,397
Mario.

1205
01:35:29,901 --> 01:35:31,960
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

1206
01:35:39,411 --> 01:35:41,845
- Mario.
- Look out, Maria!

1207
01:35:42,014 --> 01:35:43,072
(WOMEN SCREAMING)

1208
01:36:04,169 --> 01:36:07,866
MARIA: I'm fine. Put me down, I'm fine.
- Yes, dear.

1209
01:36:08,307 --> 01:36:10,366
Are you all right?
You're not hurt, are you?

1210
01:36:10,542 --> 01:36:13,033
Oh, Mario. Oh, I knew I'd find you.

1211
01:36:13,211 --> 01:36:14,803
(CROWD CHEERING)

1212
01:36:33,732 --> 01:36:35,632
Maria.

1213
01:36:36,835 --> 01:36:38,860
Hello, Pepe.

1214
01:36:40,439 --> 01:36:42,634
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

1215
01:36:42,808 --> 01:36:45,971
Later. Later, Pepe.
Not in front of Mother, please.

1216
01:36:46,144 --> 01:36:47,270
- Pepe.
- Congratulations.

1217
01:36:47,446 --> 01:36:50,142
I'm so glad. I know you'll be very happy.

1218
01:36:50,315 --> 01:36:52,340
Where's Don Antonio?

1219
01:36:53,085 --> 01:36:56,077
Maria said she left him with you.
Didn't he come home with you?

1220
01:36:56,254 --> 01:36:57,380
We got separated.

1221
01:36:57,556 --> 01:36:58,682
Isn't he here yet?

1222
01:36:58,857 --> 01:37:00,449
I can't understand it.

1223
01:37:00,625 --> 01:37:02,991
He invited all these people
for a fiesta for you.

1224
01:37:03,161 --> 01:37:06,358
He'll be here any minute. Come on,
Mother, let's dance, huh? Come on.

1225
01:37:07,933 --> 01:37:10,197
Where is Father, Pepe?

1226
01:37:10,369 --> 01:37:13,634
He's probably having Barrios arrested
for letting you get in that ring.

1227
01:37:13,805 --> 01:37:16,740
- Where's Chato?
- I passed Chato at the gate, waiting for him.

1228
01:37:19,077 --> 01:37:21,341
Maestro, Don Antonio.

1229
01:37:21,813 --> 01:37:24,043
Is there something
I can do for you, señor?

1230
01:37:24,216 --> 01:37:25,649
Yes. Step aside, please.

1231
01:37:25,817 --> 01:37:28,377
We don't like to run over little animals
on the highway.

1232
01:37:28,553 --> 01:37:29,952
Go on.

1233
01:37:35,527 --> 01:37:37,119
CHATO:
Maestro.

1234
01:37:37,996 --> 01:37:40,430
Maestro, we're glad you're home.
We've been worried.

1235
01:37:40,599 --> 01:37:44,262
Chato, you are as trustworthy
as a scorpion.

1236
01:37:44,436 --> 01:37:48,270
It's a lucky thing for you
that everything went so well for me.

1237
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,169
I can almost forgive you.

1238
01:37:50,342 --> 01:37:52,037
Yes, life is good.

1239
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:54,701
Good? What is good, Maestro?

1240
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,144
Who made it possible
for Mario to fight the bull?

1241
01:37:57,315 --> 01:37:59,681
You? No, I did it.

1242
01:37:59,851 --> 01:38:01,716
- You, maestro?
- Of course.

1243
01:38:01,887 --> 01:38:05,948
That crazy man, Contreras, showed up
outside of the bullring again today.

1244
01:38:06,124 --> 01:38:10,117
Well, I stopped him. I refused
to let him go in and create a disturbance.

1245
01:38:10,295 --> 01:38:12,559
By the time we were through
with eXplanations...

1246
01:38:12,731 --> 01:38:15,962
...at the office of the police captain,
the fights were over.

1247
01:38:16,134 --> 01:38:18,034
Oh, then, you didn't see the fight?

1248
01:38:18,203 --> 01:38:21,570
- No. Come inside and let me know about it.
- No, maestro. Please listen.

1249
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:22,764
Listen to what?

1250
01:38:22,941 --> 01:38:24,875
So far we have told your wife nothing.

1251
01:38:25,043 --> 01:38:26,271
Nothing about what?

1252
01:38:26,445 --> 01:38:29,437
Maestro, you'll never know
how close Mario was to the end.

1253
01:38:29,614 --> 01:38:33,209
He was going beautifully when,
suddenly... You know his fault.

1254
01:38:33,385 --> 01:38:34,716
- He lost his concentration.

1255
01:38:34,886 --> 01:38:37,719
The bull swung
and threw Mario to the ground.

1256
01:38:37,889 --> 01:38:41,484
He was stunned.
The bull turned, saw him lying helpless.

1257
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:42,991
He lowered his head.

1258
01:38:43,161 --> 01:38:45,857
Oh, the horns were within an inch
of Mario's body.

1259
01:38:46,031 --> 01:38:49,831
Then, all of a sudden, from nowhere,
a young man appeared.

1260
01:38:50,001 --> 01:38:53,903
He stepped over Mario's body
and used his own coat as a cape.

1261
01:38:54,072 --> 01:38:57,974
Oh, maestro, if that boy
had been one second later...

1262
01:38:58,143 --> 01:39:01,271
...you'd never have been able
to come home and face your wife.

1263
01:39:01,446 --> 01:39:03,607
- It was that close?
- No, maestro...

1264
01:39:03,782 --> 01:39:05,545
...it was closer.

1265
01:39:05,884 --> 01:39:07,408
No concentration.

1266
01:39:17,329 --> 01:39:18,557
What is it, Maria?

1267
01:39:18,730 --> 01:39:20,027
It's Father.

1268
01:39:20,465 --> 01:39:22,228
Antonio.

1269
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,664
- We were worried.
- I'm sorry, querida.

1270
01:39:24,836 --> 01:39:26,599
- Has Mario come home?
- Yes, of course.

1271
01:39:26,771 --> 01:39:28,432
Where is he?

1272
01:39:29,341 --> 01:39:30,865
(BOTH SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

1273
01:39:37,115 --> 01:39:38,810
Antonio.

1274
01:39:38,984 --> 01:39:40,417
You know Señor Contreras.

1275
01:39:40,952 --> 01:39:42,214
Don Antonio.

1276
01:39:43,922 --> 01:39:46,083
Señor Contreras.

1277
01:39:55,734 --> 01:39:57,326
Mario.

1278
01:39:59,571 --> 01:40:00,663
Yes, Father?

1279
01:40:00,839 --> 01:40:02,932
You fought well.

1280
01:40:03,108 --> 01:40:04,370
L...

1281
01:40:06,077 --> 01:40:09,478
- You saw me?
- Of course, why not?

1282
01:40:10,782 --> 01:40:14,149
You know, Mario,
you eXecuted the veronicas quite well.

1283
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:16,082
Slowly, with good form.

1284
01:40:16,254 --> 01:40:17,915
Also the <i>chicuelinas.</i>

1285
01:40:18,089 --> 01:40:20,148
In fact...

1286
01:40:20,325 --> 01:40:23,158
...I have no criticism
on the way you handled the cape...

1287
01:40:23,328 --> 01:40:28,766
...but one thing
you have never learned: Concentration.

1288
01:40:28,934 --> 01:40:31,266
I'm afraid I was wrong.

1289
01:40:31,436 --> 01:40:33,631
Fighting bulls is not for him.

1290
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:38,409
Perhaps he'll have better luck
with his concentration...

1291
01:40:38,577 --> 01:40:42,013
...when he studies music
with Señor Contreras.

1292
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:47,441
Thank you, Father, for...

1293
01:40:47,619 --> 01:40:48,677
For everything.

1294
01:40:49,721 --> 01:40:51,348
That's all right, my boy.

1295
01:40:52,257 --> 01:40:56,717
Maestro, I take back everything
I've said about you.

1296
01:40:56,895 --> 01:41:00,490
Yes, even what I was thinking about you.

1297
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:02,325
Well...

1298
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,161
...Mario, Maria, dance.

1299
01:41:04,336 --> 01:41:05,803
I ordered this fiesta for you.

1300
01:41:05,971 --> 01:41:08,132
Go on, enjoy yourselves.

1301
01:41:11,643 --> 01:41:13,838
You did well, maestro.

1302
01:41:14,012 --> 01:41:15,240
Very well.

1303
01:41:15,413 --> 01:41:17,347
Well, why not?

1304
01:41:18,149 --> 01:41:20,276
(BAND PLAYING
"MEXICAN HAT DANCE")

1305
01:41:39,104 --> 01:41:42,130
If Mario was knocked down,
why is Maria limping?

1306
01:41:42,307 --> 01:41:43,535
Uh...

1307
01:41:44,075 --> 01:41:47,238
Twins, maestro, twins.

1308
01:41:52,784 --> 01:41:54,411
Chato!

1309
01:41:57,756 --> 01:41:59,553
Come back here!
