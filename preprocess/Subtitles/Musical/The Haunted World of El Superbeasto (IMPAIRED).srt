1

How do you do?

2
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:25,525
Mr. Rob Zombie feels it would
be a little unkind

3
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,903
to present this picture without
just a word of friendly warning.

4
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:33,449
We are about to unfold
the story of El Superbeasto,

5
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,243
a man of action.

6
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,913
It is one of the strangest
tales ever told.

7
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,749
I think it will thrill you.

8
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,960
It may shock you.

9
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,921
It might even horrify you.

10
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:51,217
So if any of you feel that you
do not care to subject your nerves

11
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,760
to such a strain,

12
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,847
now's your chance to, uh--

13
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,683
Well, we warned you.

14
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,847
All right now, bitches, listen up.

15
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:23,518
The director's on the set.
The director is on the set!

16
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:27,271
Howdy-doodly-doo, ladies?
Gather round, gather round.

17

Big Time Movie Casting
is now in session.

18
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:34,904
I've got a very special porno--
I mean art film-- to shoot today.

19
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,782
[chuckles]
So, time to get a-crack-a-lackin'.

20
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,952
You heard him.
Get your asses a-crack-a-lackin'!

21
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:44,580
Now just to let you know, I'm not
one of those shallow Hollywood types

22
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,207
that casts based on looks.

23
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,875
I'm all about pure talent.

24
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,919
I want the audience to believe
in the characters,

25
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,921
to experience the emotions,

26
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,632
breathe in the spicy meatball man,

27
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,925
as they breathe life itself.

28
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,010
All right, Granny,

29
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,930
tell me a little about
why I should ignore the fact

30
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,015
that you're, like,
a thousand years old.

31
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,770
In 1910, I attended the
Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts

32
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,941
- on full scholarship, winning the...

33

36
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,284
I know it!
[giggles]

37
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,368
Perfect perfect!

38
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,412
You're hired. Next.

39
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,915
I dig into the inner texture
of the soul of the character

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,376
- and reflect society's issues with women...
- [snoring]

41
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,753
- ...and their hatred of the vagina.
- Next!

42
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,130
- Let me tell you--
- No.

43
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,965
- I'd really like to--
- Next!

44
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,967
- People make me nauseous.
- No way!

45
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,468
- Hello!
- Nope.

46
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,053
- Who do I have to fuck--
- No.

47
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,889

- Ugh!

48
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,599
- I'm ready for my-- whoa!
- Next!

49
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,184
Well, hello, honeypants.

50
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,187
[giggles]
I think a good tan is as important

51
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,522
as a good script, you know?

52
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:54,233
Also, I can't really read so good,

53
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,153
but I can do 300 crunches
without stopping.

54
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,530
Words are so overrated.

55
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:03,284
But on the other hand, tight abs--
so underrated.

56

Oh, oh my God.

Okay, and we're still rolling, mate.

Get a load of this, ladies.

I'm awesome!
I'm awesome! I'm awesome!

790
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,414
Let's not go through all that again.

791
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,333
Just hand Velvet over
like a good little nerd

00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,168
and I can get busy
tapping that ass.

793
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,170
All right, listen up,
you dumb jock.

794
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,922
Velvet von Black is mine!

795
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:28,550
At midnight she will be
my unholy bride and all mine!

796
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,844
Mine! Mine mine mine mine mine!

00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,309
I gotta take this.

- Yello?
- [high-pitched voice]

801
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,187
Talk to me, baby.

802
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,396
Give me some good news.

803
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,816
Oh, really?

804
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,194
Krongarr, discipline him!

805
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,320
Yes, master, yes!

806

That's right, bitch!

Ouch!

810
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:11,051
There you are. Yo, go pass me
some more of that Champagney shit.

811
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,762
Oh, God.
Hold still.

812
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:16,181
Hey hey, easy with
that brush, you creep!

813
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:17,224
I'm tender-headed!

814
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,227
Believe me, I don't want to
do this any more than you do.

815
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,604
Don't front. You know you
staring at my Wonder Twins.

816
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,357
You want your monkey juice
on these shits, don't you?

817
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,859
No, put the twins to bed.

818
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:29,611
I would rather shuck out my eyes
with a rusty clam knife.

819
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:30,779
Mmm-hmm.

820
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,406

Hey hey hey, you're dirtying
my bathwater, monkey.

Whoa. Oh.

824

Agh!
Oh, the stench!

827
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,174
It's like bilge water
from the River Thames!

828
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,968
Now why'd you stop?
I'm the one who tells you when.

829
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,262
- Shit!
- It was a mistake, I assure you,

830
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,764
like casting George Lazenby
as 007.

831
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:02,269
Mistake, my ass. You know, once
you go black you never go back.

832
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,687
That's von Black, bitch.

833
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:08,025
I need some mouthwash
and a mind eraser immediately!

834

Why? Why? Why?

835

Why? Why?
Why?

Male voice:
Hey, brother, snap out of it!

That's just perfect.

838
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,707
All right, who said it?

839
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,293
Who dared interrupt
my big moment?

840
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,003
Well, that would
be me, brother,

841
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,298
the toughest mat-grappler
this side of your mama's panties--

842
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:35,302
El Gato!

843
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,845
Who really gives a shit?

844
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,931
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm busy.

845
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,933
- Director: Okay, bring it up.
- Camera assistant: How's that?

846
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,184
- Up a bit, yeah.
- That good?

847
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,561
- Okay, that's it.
- Scene 67, take 2.

848
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:48,690
Um-- damn it.

849
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:51,318
[sighs]
See, this is what happens.

850
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,903
Line, please.

851
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:57,115
- Woman: "Why?"
- Oh, right.

852
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,079
Why? Why? Why?

853
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:06,708
Why? Why?
Why?

854
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,086
I can't believe you're here.
My idol,

855
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:12,339
locked in chains like
a towelhead at Guantanamo.

856
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,759
Yeah, well, this is
a temporary setback, see?

857
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,095
You remember when
I was pitted against

858
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,347
the Raging Earth's Crust
at the Razzledome?

859
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,640
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

860
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,558
He was squeezing my head

861
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:24,977
- like I was a tit--
- Do you mind?

862
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,355
I'm trying to formulate
an exciting plan of action.

863
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,357
Then he yanked my balls off.

864
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,360
That's great.
Your family must be very proud.

865
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,988
I bet they gave you a party cake
and everything.

866
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,865
Oh, no. Can't have any cake.
I'm a diabetic.

867
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:42,369
But I did get a new set of
pendulous balls grafted on.

868
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,996
- See?
- Hmm.

869
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,332
Could this get any more repulsive?

870
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:51,003
Oh, sweet buns--
firm, yet squishy.

871
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,462
Oh, I love 'em.

872
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:56,008
Beasto's Hot Wheel's

00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,968
[laughs]

874
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,513
I dig the new cycle, Murray.

875
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,641
But if I didn't know better,
I'd say the design was a bit,

876
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:07,394
shall we say, kinky.

877
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:11,398
Kinky? Um, uh, no,
it was, uh-- I mean--

878
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,650
I meticulously calculated
the wind velocity

879
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,111
and that was the most
aerodynamically sound...

880
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,404
Time to change, Murray.

881
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,407
If somebody caught me wearing the
same outfit in two different adventures,

882
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,785
I think it would
simpwy bwake my wittle heart.

883
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,412
Oh, I understand
how the heart can ache--

884
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,123
sometimes achy-break.

885
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,916
Suzi, oh, please--

886
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,461
Wow, Murray, you're a riot.

887
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,505
Let me tell you-- count yourself
lucky you don't have a heart.

888
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,675
You never have to feel the rush
of hot blood racing through your veins,

889
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,427
pumping life into vital organs,

890
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:44,264
throbbing, pulsating,

891
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,768
swelling, pumping.

892
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,937
[Murray laughs]

893
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,230
- Agh!
- Cool it, hot stuff.

894
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,816
- Oh, God!
- I'll tell you when we need the big guns.

895
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,610
[both gasp]

896
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,487
[muffled groan]

897
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:03,033
Murray, I think we've got company.

898
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,159
[whimpers]

899
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,577
There they are!

Love is a battlefield.

902
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:15,128
Ah, the wisdom of Benatar.

903
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,047
Witness the carnage, Otto.

904
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:22,886
Welcome to
the Hall of Frozen Ex-wives! [echoes]

905
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,140
22 failed marriages.

906
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:30,060
Where did I go wrong?

907
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,813
Take Deirdre.
We met in pre-med.

908
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,023
Oh, how I adored her.

909
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:36,525
Oh, she was beneath you, sir--

910
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,486
and beneath every man on the
Manchester United Football Club.

911
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,364
Oh? And what would
you know about it, monkey?

912
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,574
Anyway, she was boring.

913
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:48,662
Ah, my second marriage, to Lilith,
was a debaucherous downward spiral.

914
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:49,704
Mmm!

915
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:52,082
Ah, Shirley.
She was cute--

916
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,626
couple of father issues, though.
Hmm.

917
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,294
Oh, Maria.

918
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,505
Philosophical differences.
Mmm.

919
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,174
Impala-- she wouldn't
let me get too close to her.

920
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,427
Sarah--
she ran hot and cold.

921
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,429
Sex was mechanical!

922
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,513
Too clingy.

923
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,848
Too bossy.
Slurped her soup.

924
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,015
Oh! My dry cleaning.

925
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,308
Nope.
Wrong.

926
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,810
No no no no no.

927
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:12,853
Nose!

928
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,522
Ball busters on parade, brother!

929
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,691
22 wives, Otto,

930
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,068
all of them abysmal catastrophes!

931
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:21,736
A total waste of time!

932
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,865
Oh, but how I love the ladies!

933
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,159
Nothing will stop me now!

934
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:29,953

- What was that?
- I'll tell you what it was,

937
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,501
if you ask me. But quite honestly,
you've been difficult to talk to.

938
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:40,005
Oh, shit.
I think that was a rat.

939
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:43,925
Well, then-- there are only two things
in this world that I'm afraid of:

940
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,387
my Uncle Carl in a thong,
and rats!

941
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,139
Well, I got bad news for you, son.

942
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,348
And worse news.

943
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,517
Uh, what's the bad news?

944
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:55,687
Hey, Beasto, you want to
play "My Bad Little Pony"?

945
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,606
Uncle Carl!

946
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,484
Jesus, Mary, and Seacrest!

947
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,735
What's the worse news?

948
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,153
Hey, check this out.

949
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,656
B- b-b-b-b-b!

950
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,579
[farts]
Oh, moist.

951
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,997
That's a new one.

952
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,582
People'd pay money to see that.

953
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,293
I can't take it.
I'm not supposed to die like this.

954
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,003
I'm a celebrity, damn it!

955
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:24,674
Wachowski, get ready for
the wedgie of your life!

956
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,598
Whoo! Attaboy!

957
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:46,029
[cackling]

958
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,574
My pretty Miss X.
[laughs]

959
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:52,619
You thought you'd seen
the last of us, didn't you?

960
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,913
Yeah, well, I was kinda hoping,
you know.

961
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,624
I did change my outfit and all.
Do you like it?

962
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,418
[wolf whistles]

963
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,128
Zombies:
It looks like it was painted on.

964
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:06,925
- She's much hotter than Eva Braun.
- Come to Papa!

965
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,386
- Now you're cooking with gas!
- [sizzles]

966
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,971
Ooh, sexy Mama!

967
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,639
Silence, Grossberger!

968
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,475
Very clever, Miss X,

969
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,355
but you are not familiar
with the Nazi Curse, are you?

970
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,066
Hmm, which one?
Let me see.

971
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,734
There's "Fuck Nazis,"

972
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:25,986
"God Damn Nazis,"

973
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,112
"Nazi Assholes,"

974
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:28,280
"Nazi Pricks,"

975
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:29,447
"Nazi Douche Bags,"

976
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:30,657
"Nazi Jerk Offs"--

977
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,659
the list just goes on and on.

978
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,121
Ha ha ha.
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

979
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:39,666
No, my pretty.
The Nazi Curse proclaims

980
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,919
that the one who vanquishes
the soul of the Fuhrer

981
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,880
will suffer the second coming
of the Third Reich!

982
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:49,175
Arise, soldiers of the Third Reich!

983
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,761
[cackling]

984
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,683
Nobody's laughing now!

985
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,102
Well, I am, but it's
all about context, you see.

986
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,353
[laughs]

987
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,896
Correct me if I'm wrong here,

988
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,982
but wouldn't the second coming
of the Third Reich

989
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,318
actually be the first coming
of the Fourth Reich?

990
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,821
What did you say?

991
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,698
Since this is the new one
after number three,

992
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,701
wouldn't this technically
be number four, dipshit?

993
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:18,330
That's right. You go, girl.
You know what you're talking about.

994
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,207
Technically she is correct.

995
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,917
Wilhelm, would you do me a favor?

996
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,711
- Yeah.
- Shut up!

997
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,254
- Aw, forget it.
- [zombies grumbling]

998
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,715
Wait wait, my brothers.
No no no!

999
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,300
Do over! Do over!

1000
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:34,304
Arise, soldiers of either the
Fourth or the Third Reich,

1001
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:37,140
you know, depending on
how you choose to count it.

1002
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,683
[laughs maniacally]

1003
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:41,519
Who's your daddy now?
That's right. Me!

1004
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:44,564
Murray, prepare
for Ass Kicking 101!

1005
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:45,815
Let's get it done!

1006
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,738
So, Dr. Satan, huh?
What the fuck?

1007
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,740
You a doctor, like a PhD and shit?

1008
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:58,536
Ah, Velvet, you are the most
delightful and bewitching woman

1009
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,914
I have ever met.
[coughs]

1010
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,624
That's 'cause I'm a fuckin' lady.
Mmm.

1011
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:06,961
Hmm. I don't want
to seem too forward, Velvet,

1012
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,714
but the truth is I've grown
quite smitten with you.

1013
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:10,757
Oh, God.

1014
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,759
[burps]
Yeah, me too.

1015
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,761
You got some nice digs, though.
I ain't gonna front.

1016
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,930
When Tananeesha and
Roqwana come through,

1017
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,598
ooh, it's gonna be on!

1018
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:19,766
Them bitches gonna be jealous.

1019
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,976
Velvet, I'm going to cut to the chase.

1020
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,938
50% of everything
you see here is yours

1021
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,357
if you will be my bride.

1022
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,402
Oh, Satan, you're
the motherfuckin' man!

1023
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:32,696
And now, my dear--

1024
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,532
[sawing]

1025
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,117
And now--

1026
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,160
- [sawing]
- Otto!

1027
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,370
Where the fuck is the ring?

1028
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:44,290
How fast do you think I can
saw the finger off a corpse?

1029
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,796
Hmm, so, this is awkward.

1030
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,631
- [chainsaw]
- Mmm-hmm.

1031

[clears throat]

1032
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:59,222
[bone snaps]

1033
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,227
Be my number 23.

1034
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,812
Da-a-amn!

1035
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,605
Now that's what
I'm talking about!

1036
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,898
That shit's tight!

1037
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,692
Alright, I'm down.

1038
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:11,818
Let's turn this mother out!

1039
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,820
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

1040
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:18,950
We are gonna have
the best Polish wedding ever!

1041
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,828
[laughs maniacally]

1042
00:51:21,907 --> 00:51:24,831
You gotta understand--
it's not an exercise program,

1043
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,166
it's a lifestyle.

1044
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,042
Look at me. I don't eat carbs.

1045
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,836
I don't eat 'em after 8:00.

1046
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,920
I just don't do it.

1047
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,425
[groans]

[growls]

1049
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:47,645
You know what we are,
don't you?

1050
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:48,855
I'll tell ya--
we're doomed!

1051
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,858
Not so fast, my big-balled friend.

1052
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,695
I didn't come this far to go down
like a Filipino transvestite

1053
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,905
during Fleet Week.

1054
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,164
Uh, music.

1055
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:11,336

1058
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,192
Whoo, that was a lot of fun.

1059
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,653
I haven't kicked ass
like that in a long time.

1060
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,488
Wait, I hear something.

1061
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,866
Is that Bodislav Bodinsky
the polka king?

1062
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:43,493
Outrageous!

1063
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,036
Let's go!

1064
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,540
Oh, sure, use a man's balls
to beat the hell out of something

1065
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:49,749
and then don't wait for him!

- Kraut bogey, 5:00!
- [screams]

When I woke up this morning
I was in such a good mood.

1068
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,886
Mind if I borrow these
for a moment?

1069
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,266
Time to take over, big boy.

1070
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,684
I'm going in.

1071
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:10,019
Going in?
Fucking awesome!

1072
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:16,401
Damn iit, Otto, this is my special day
and those two are going to ruin it!

1073
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:17,819
Now, hold still.

1074
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,613
I don't think you're
taking this problem seriously.

1075
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:23,616
Not taking it seriously?

1076
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:27,495
Whose idea was it for the giant
cascading waterfall of shrimp, hmm?

1077
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:29,998
You.

1078
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:32,959
And who was going
to surprise you

1079
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,086
with a life-size ice sculpture

1080
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:39,299
of His Supreme Evilness
Dr. Satan in all his glory?

1081
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,968
- You didn't.
- I did.

1082
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,931
Well, that's fine and dandy,

1083
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:48,600
but did you ever stop
for one second

1084
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:51,519
and think that if you weren't
acting like a giant Froot Loop

1085
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:53,938
parading around
knee-deep in doilies,

1086
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:55,982
then you would have noticed
that there were two superheroes

1087
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,776
about to throw a
goddamn monkey wrench

1088
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:02,906
in my master plan,
you stupid monkey!

1089
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,617
- [gasps]
- Fuck you and your shrimp boat.

1090
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,076
I'm doing this my way.

1091
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,996
Oh! I meant to do that.

1092
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,248
Mark my words, Steven.

1093
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:15,126
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Oh!
