Will you stop your daydreaming,
Tommy Stubbins?

8
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,776
- Hello, Matt.
- Come and help me select
a suitable dinner...

9
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,345
- for me clients here.
- Can I push the barrow?

10
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,325
Well, it's not gonna
push itself now, is it?

11
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,884
It's against my religion to do anything
violent till the end of the day.

12
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,896
God bless all Irishmen.

- [Cat Meows]
- You know what I was thinking, Matt?

14
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,635
- No, what was that?
Not for you, me darling.
- [Cat Meows]

15
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,467
It'll make your fur fall out.

16
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,133
I was thinking
that if you sold your fish barrow,

17
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,142
and I sold my grandfather's watch,

18
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,144
we could buy a boat and go to China.

19
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,807
Oh. Oh, you're the middle
and two ends of a fine fellow, Tom.

20
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,908
It's a beautiful proposition,
but don't you see the problem?

21
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:56,113
- What's that?
- Well, do you speak Chinese?

22
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,784
- No.
- Then, if you sell
your grandfather's watch,

23
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,850
and we go to China,

24
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,294
how are you goin' to tell the time?

25
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,198
- I never thought of that.
- Ah, well, you see,
you have to plan ahead.

26
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,201
It's very important.

27
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,204
I mean, the whole secret
of my success with the fish barrow...

28
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,502
was years of planning ahead.

29
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,509
Thank you, Charlie.

30
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:21,240
May the 17 holy men of Donnybrook
reward you in heaven.

31
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,475
- I'd sooner you rewarded me down here.
- [Duck Quacks]

32
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,313
- Who's this then?
- Wild duck off the marshes.

33
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,651
- Is that a fact?
- Flew straight into the mast,
cross-eyed fool.

34
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,520
Can you imagine that now?
He was probably under the influence.

35
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,060
[Chuckles]
He looks Irish to me.

36
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,892
Don't worry.
I'll fix him up.

37
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,898
Bring him back.
That's my dinner.

38
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,900
Now don't ask me
to do that, Charlie.

39
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,902
As Secretary for the Preservation
of Irish Ducks,

40
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,837
it's more than me job is worth.

[Cats Meowing]

42
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,842
You never told me
you were secretary of Irish ducks.

43
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,038
Oh, well, now I don't
talk about it much.

44
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,082
- I'm a very modest fella.
- What are we going to do with it then?

45
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,084
Well, now, as soon as
I finish me deliveries,

46
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,017
we'll take him over
to John Dolittle.

47
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,021
- Here.
- Who's John Dolittle?

48

Eat hearty, me lovelies.

49
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,627
- And heaven bless
all Catholic pussycats.
- Who is John Dolittle?

50
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,129
John Dolittle is the greatest
animal doctor in the world today...

51
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:15,632
and a close personal friend
of Matthew Mugg.

52
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,634
He lives right here
in Puddleby, he does.

53
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:20,296
- Out on the Oxenthorpe Road.
- What does he do?

54
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:25,002
He's a genius. That's what he does.
He can talk to animals.

55
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:27,340
- Talk to them?
- Speaks their language, he does.

56
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,346
Just like you and me's chatting now.

57
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:32,440
He'll have a word with
that little fellow in wild duck talk...

58
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:34,451
and put him straight in no time.

59
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,453
Oh, the darlin' man.

60
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:40,287
He'd think nothin' of travelin' halfway
round the world to cure a sick sparrow.

61
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:43,418
Only last week,
he went all the way to Africa.

62
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:46,396
[Chuckles]
Ask me why.

63
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:49,558
- Why?
- Why? I'll tell you.

64
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:52,660
To look after a crocodile
with toothache.

65
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:55,797
He's altogether a marvelous man.

66
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:00,839
And he understands the Irish.

67
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:03,847

is making another one [music]

the sun is made of cheddar cheese [music]

[Music] The doctor even knows
the reason why [music]

85
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,669
[Music] The facts are these
Try if you please [music]

Of course you would.

89
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,773
[Music] Maybe what the doctor tells me [music]

90

[Music] If you remain out in the rain [music]

You wanna watch out for her, Tom.

Oh, I'm terrible sorry. I must have
frightened them out of their lives.

151
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:42,686
Matthew, you're soaking wet.

152
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:45,154
You're a little
on the damp side yourself, sir.

153
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:47,157
Oh, it's these fish languages.

154
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,955
They really only work underwater.

155
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:52,019
It's fascinating.

156
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:56,226
The basic system is
mouth movements and bubble signals.

157
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,234
At the moment,
I can only make big bubbles,

158
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:00,167
and they keep
telling me I'm shouting.

159
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:02,172
Beggin' me ignorance, sir,

160
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,698
but what can you hope to get out
of a conversation with a goldfish?

161
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,711
Matthew, I'll show you.

162
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,713
[Animals Chittering, Grunting]

163
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:15,613
The legendary great pink sea snail.

164
00:14:15,686 --> 00:14:18,120
For hundreds of years, sailors
have claimed that they've seen it.

165
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:21,454
Oh, poor devils.
It's that rotten stock they drink.

166
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:26,188
But, uh, what has this
got to do with goldfish?

167
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:28,664
I don't believe it's legendary.
I believe it actually exists.

168
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,667
What's that got to do
with goldfish?

169
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:32,669
Well, I'm planning
a voyage to find it.

170
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:34,671
That is, if I can get
enough money together.

171
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:36,798
Oh, may the saints
reward you, sir.

172
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:38,808
But, uh, what's that
got to do with the...

173
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:41,709
Well, if I find it, Matthew,
I'm going to want to talk to it.

174
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:44,407
Therefore, I have to acquire
a knowledge of ancient shellfish,

175
00:14:44,482 --> 00:14:46,450
which is extremely complicated.

176
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:48,542
So, I'm starting
with basic fish languages,

177
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:51,349
like halibut, mackerel and goldfish.

178
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:55,119
Ah, there, you see? I knew it
had something to do with goldfish.

179
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:59,656
Now, about your last voyage, Doctor.

180
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,790
Did, uh, did you find
the crocodile with a toothache?

181
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:06,098
Crocodile?
Oh, yes, in the Congo, yes.

182
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,297
I got back on Saturday.

183
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:12,832
- Look.
- [Gasps] Isn't that a beauty now?

184
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,878
Make a marvelous bottle opener.

185
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:17,506
Look at that, Tom.
Oh, forgive me, Doctor.

186
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:21,541
- This is me ol' pal, Tommy Stubbins.
- How do you do, sir?

187
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:24,782
- He's brought a patient for you.
- It's a duck, sir.

188
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:27,586
- It's a drake.
- [Quacking]

189
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:29,592
You're sopping wet too.

190
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,855
- Yes, sir, it's raining.
- [Duck Quacks]

191
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:35,956
- [Dolittle Quacks]
- [Duck Quacks]

192
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:37,967
He's hurt his wing, sir.

193
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:39,969
- Yes, so he's been telling me.
- [Quacking]

194
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:42,835
Oh, quack, quack.
Oh, poor chap, yes.

195
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,841
[Laughs]
Sorry.

196
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:48,868
- [Quacking]
- Quack, quack.

197
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:51,414
He had a row with his wife
and wasn't looking where he was going.

198
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:53,416
He told you all that?

199
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:55,611
They're very neurotic creatures.

200
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:57,654
[Duck Quacks]

201
00:15:57,722 --> 00:15:59,656
You'll be all right by the morning.

202
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:04,390
Yes, I'll get word to your wife.

203
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:06,521
Quack, quack, quack.

204
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:11,094
Now, while our friend's
convalescing,

205
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:13,228
I'll try and find you
something dry to wear.

206
00:16:13,304 --> 00:16:15,295
Then, we all can have
some food together.

207
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:18,069
- Polynesia, two more for dinner.
- Yes, Doctor.

208
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:21,043
Oh, and, Matthew, hold on
to that crocodile's tooth.

209
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:23,307
Must be a bottle somewhere
you can open with it.

210
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:28,445
[Pig Squealing]

211
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:49,672
- [Pig Squealing]
- [Chittering]

212
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,638
- Gub-Gub.
- [Squealing]

213
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:58,273
Will you please stop making
that infernal noise?

214
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,374
A few pork sausages
and a bit of bacon.

215
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:04,319
The way you're carrying on, you'd think
we were cooking your entire family.

216
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:06,822
Chee-Chee, make him behave.

217
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:09,325
- [Screeches]
- [Squealing]

218
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:15,155
But you can hardly blame him
for being a bit upset, Doctor.

219
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:19,033
I'd be upset meself if you
started frying Irishmen.

220
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,128
You know the problem
as well as I do, Matthew.

221
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:24,231
I've nearly 600 mouths to feed,
including the mice.

222
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:26,469
- Six hundred!
- Yes. So if the butcher...

223
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:28,603
gives me a string of sausages
now and then, I take it,

224
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,909
whether it upsets Gub-Gub or not.

225
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:33,041
Anyway, he eats more
than any of us.

226
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:35,051
Sure you won't be
having anything?

227
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,644
- Quite sure. Thank you, Matthew.
- Aren't you hungry, Doctor?

228
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:39,656
Yes, but I follow
a very special diet, Stubbins.

229
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:43,387
- It's highly nutritious and very good.
- Oh, I see.

230
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:46,589
The doctor's in rather
an awkward position, you see, Tom.

231
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:48,632
- Aren't you, Doctor?
- What do you mean, Matt?

232
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:52,100
You understand, Stubbins,
he means meat.

233
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:55,002
It upsets the animals
if I, uh...

234
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:57,404
- Oh, of course.
- So I don't.

235
00:17:57,475 --> 00:18:02,310
As a matter of principle,
one should always try to avoid
eating one's friends.

236
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,811
[Music] The day that I became
a veterinarian [music]

237
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:09,080
[Music] I had a sudden
overwhelming wish [music]

238
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:12,054
[Music] To be a pure
and simple vegetarian [music]

239
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:15,149
[Music] And give up eating
all that meat and fish [music]

240
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:18,889
- I think that's marvelous.
- Meat is very unhealthy for you.

241
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:22,330
[Music] So now I live
on healthy food instead [music]

242
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,301
[Music] Like apple cores
and parsnip juice [music]

243
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:28,133
[Music] And chunks of plain
brown bread [music]

244
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:30,332
[Moos]

245
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:32,501
All right, all right.
I'm coming.

246
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,076
[Music] When I see my fellowman
consuming sirloin steak [music]

247
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:44,315
[Music] And I find myself enjoying
tea and Dundee cake [music]

248
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:48,051
[Music] There is really only
one conclusion I can make [music]

249
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,253
[Music] I'm a devoted vegetarian [music]

250
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:53,263
No, no, no, no,
you've had yours.

251
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:55,265
[Baaing]

252
00:18:57,101 --> 00:19:01,265
[Music] When my host at dinner
offers succulent roast beef [music]

253
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:05,241
[Music] Proudly I refuse it
People stare in disbelief [music]

254
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:08,836
[Music] Lost in admiration
as I nibble on a leaf [music]

255
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:12,508
[Music] A very noted vegetarian [music]

256
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:16,519
I wouldn't even eat horseradish,
in case I upset the horses.

257
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:20,387
[Music] I stay away
from deviled ham on principle [music]

258
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:24,087
[Music] I wouldn't eat roast duckling
if I could [music]

259
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:27,858
[Music] Willpower has made me invincible [music]

260
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:31,026
[Music] My word
Those sausages look good [music]

261
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:33,627
[Sizzling]

262
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:38,272
Where's my dinner gone?

263
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:40,333
They've done it again.

264
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:43,744
Come on. Own up. Who's got it
this time? Who's got my dinner?

265
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:47,847
It's bad enough to have to eat
this muck in the first place.

266
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:50,045
Just 'cause I eat this
instead of eating them,

267
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:52,055
they think they can
take advantage of me.

268
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:54,057
You've no idea what I put up with
on their account.

269
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:58,027
[Music] I eat every flowering shrub
there is except for gorse [music]

270
00:19:58,095 --> 00:20:01,997
[Music] Sometimes I get luxuries
like beetroot leaves, of course [music]

271
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:06,059
[Music] My life's much the same
as that of any English horse [music]

272
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:10,039
[Music] Why should I be a vegetarian [music]

273
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:13,804
[Music] Turnip pie and peanuts
That's the sort of filth I eat [music]

274
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:17,507
[Music] Any sort of rubbish
that is wholesome and discreet [music]

275
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:21,073
[Music] Why don't I admit
that my hypocrisy's complete [music]

276
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:24,485
[Music] If I should live
to be a centenarian [music]

277
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:28,252
[Music] Become our most adored
humanitarian [music]

278
00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:31,556
[Music] I'll never make
a decent vegetarian [music]

279
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:33,563
[Music] I'm a cheat, I love meat [music]

280
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:35,565
[Music] I'm a cheat, yes, I am [music]

281
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,794
[Music] I love red-blooded
juicy chunks of meat [music]

282
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:39,802
[Music] Legs of lamb, sides of beef [music]

283
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,464
[Music] And chops and steaks
and veal and pork, of course [music]

284
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,906
- [Music] My favorite meal [music]
- [Squealing]

285
00:20:46,877 --> 00:20:51,780
[Music] And then I hear
poor Gub-Gub squeal [music]

286
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:55,649
[Music] Oh, me, oh, my [music]

287
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:59,018
[Music] A reluctant but sincere [music]

288
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:02,081
[Music] Vegetarian [music]

289
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,423
[Music] Am I [music]

290
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,157
So, you see, Stubbins,
being an animal doctor has its problems.

291
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:12,828
For one thing, you don't get paid
anything, at least not in money.

292
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:15,133
You get bones
or nuts or worms...

293
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:18,198
or whatever the particular
animal's currency happens to be.

294
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:21,642
And secondly, most of the animals who
come here as patients like it so much,

295
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:23,680
they stay here permanently.

296
00:21:23,747 --> 00:21:26,682
It's hardly what you'd call
a profit-making enterprise.

297
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,843
But who looks after
the animals?

298
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,853
They look after themselves,
for the most part.

299
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:33,481
Animals are much better
at that than human beings.

300
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:35,491
And how did you become a veteran?

301
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,357
[Chuckles] No, Stubbins,
the word is "veterinarian."

302
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:40,920
But say "animal doctor."
It's less pretentious.

303
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:43,262
It all happened
rather suddenly, actually.

304
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:45,825
My entire life changed in one day,
didn't it, Matthew?

305
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:49,600
[Chuckles]
Oh, it was altogether marvelous.

306
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:52,608
It was my sister, Sarah,
who started it all.

307
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:54,610
Sarah.

308
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:08,548
- [Clucking]
- [Gasping]

309
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:12,495
- [Quacks]
- Oh!

310
00:22:13,797 --> 00:22:16,163
[Whimpering]

311
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:19,999
Did you know that an ant has
more intelligence than a hippopotamus?

312
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,402
And that a grasshopper...
in relation to his size...

313
00:22:22,473 --> 00:22:26,170
has more power in his hind legs
than a kangaroo?

314
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:28,234
Absolutely fascinating.

315
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:32,112
There's no doubt about it. Animals
are much more interesting than people.

316
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:36,050
Good heavens, Sarah.
What on Earth are you doing down there?

317
00:22:37,621 --> 00:22:40,784
There are pigeons
in the linen cupboard.

318
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:43,793
- Oh, yes, I thought
it would be warmer for them.
- You knew?

319
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:46,762
Yes, I put them there. It gets
so terribly chilly on the roof at night.

320
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,628
And two tortoises
in the guest room.

321
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,260
That's where they are.
I wondered where they got to.

322
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:55,328
- And white mice
in your chest of drawers.
- That's right.

323
00:22:55,406 --> 00:22:58,398
And the grass snakes are
in the roll top desk under the envelopes.

324
00:22:58,475 --> 00:23:00,409
Grass snakes?

325
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:03,071
John Dolittle, if those animals
aren't out of this house by tonight...

326
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:06,275
- [Bell Rings]
- Oh, dear!

327
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,411
- [Bell Ringing]
- Nine o'clock precisely.

328
00:23:10,487 --> 00:23:12,421
That will be Lady Petherington.

329
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:14,423
I wonder what she's found wrong
with herself today.

330
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:16,425
All right, Sarah.
Show her in, please.

331
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:21,696
I mean it, John.
I shall leave.

332
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:25,929
Those animals,
they're destroying your practice.

333
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:28,437
You won't have
a decent patient left soon.

334
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:30,439
Not unless you answer the door.

335
00:23:30,507 --> 00:23:35,206
I don't understand the things that go on
around this house with those animals.

336
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,975
And we'll probably never see
the vicar's wife again...

337
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:41,074
after giving her that glass of milk
with a frog in it.

338
00:23:41,151 --> 00:23:43,085
- [Bell Rings]
- [Sniffles]

339
00:23:43,153 --> 00:23:46,122
I really don't know
what you expect me to do.

340
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:50,860
Oh, good morning,
Lady Petherington.

341
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:52,862
Are we feeling better today?

342
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:57,867
We're no better for being left to freeze
to death on Doctor's front doorsteps.

343
00:23:57,935 --> 00:24:00,028
Oh.

344
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:04,734
Dr. Dolittle,
oh, it's my nerves.

345
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:07,470
You must do something
for them instantly.

346
00:24:07,544 --> 00:24:09,739
Oh, you'll never guess
what happened.

347
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:12,247
It's quite the worst
experience of my life.

348
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,250
Uh, won't you come in,
Lady Petherington?

349
00:24:14,318 --> 00:24:16,684
I was giving
this dinner party last night...

350
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:18,881
up at the Grange
for the Duke of St. Albans.

351
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:23,950
Fifty guests. The most
embarrassing moment of my entire life.

352
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:26,496
A mouse ran across the table.

353
00:24:26,563 --> 00:24:28,793
Oh, I thought I'd die.

354
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:32,802
I may still.
Can you imagine? A mouse.

355
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,338
Do you know who was there, hmm?

356
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:37,340
Well, of course, everybody.

357
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:39,467
The humiliation.

358
00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:42,569
Crown Prince Angelicus
of Brandenberg.

359
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:45,979
He's so well-bred,
he doesn't even know what a mouse is.

360
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,484
Fainted dead away.

361
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:50,577
I haven't slept all night.

362
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:52,918
Of course, I discharged
my entire staff,

363
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,924
especially the gardeners.

364
00:24:54,992 --> 00:24:57,984
I'll be struck
from the social directory.

365
00:24:58,062 --> 00:25:00,690
A mouse. Hmph.

366
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:04,225
[Doorbell Ringing]

367
00:25:06,336 --> 00:25:10,136
- Vicar, what a surprise!
- [Sneezes] Bless me.

368
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:12,732
How is your frog?
I mean, your wife.

369
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:16,302
Oh, the less said about her the better.
I mean, that incident.

370
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,283
Most unfor... for... for... fortunate.

371
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:23,876
[Sneezes]
Bless me.

372
00:25:23,954 --> 00:25:26,184
Miss Dolittle, it's my hay fever.

373
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:28,986
The Bishop of Glastonbury
is attending my sermon this evening,

374
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:31,459
- and it's most important,
you understand.
- Of course.

375
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:33,826
- But my hay... hay... [Sneezes]
- [Lady Petherington Screams]

376
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:38,524
Oh! Oh! Oh!

377
00:25:38,602 --> 00:25:40,797
But... But... Oh!

378
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,968
[Muttering]

379
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:48,773
[Screams]
Oh, my foot, my foot!

380
00:25:48,846 --> 00:25:51,906
- Oh!
- Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!

381
00:25:51,982 --> 00:25:53,916
Where in the heavens does
that woman think she's going?

382
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:57,112
- Get out of my way, Vicar!
- [Sneezes]

383
00:25:57,187 --> 00:25:59,121
- Oh!
- [Animal Shrieks]

384
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,320
- [Sneezes]
- Ow!

385
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:07,591
- Oh!
- [Screams]

386
00:26:07,664 --> 00:26:09,632
- Oh!
- [Barks]

387
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:13,669
- [Cat Screeches]
- [Barking]

388
00:26:13,737 --> 00:26:15,796
Ow!

389
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:18,467
[Yelling, Screaming Continue]

390
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:22,706
Oh, let me out of this madhouse!

391
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,340
- Oh! Oh!
- Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!

392
00:26:25,415 --> 00:26:28,350
[Sneezing]

393
00:26:28,418 --> 00:26:32,320
- Ow!
- [Glass Breaks]

394
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:34,323
[Sobbing]

395
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:46,202
[Grunts]

396
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,973
John!

397
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:53,475
Yes, Sarah?

398
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:57,446
I shall give you just five minutes
to make up your mind.

399
00:26:57,514 --> 00:27:00,915
Either you get rid of every
hideous bird, beast and reptile...

400
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:03,748
in this ridiculous
menagerie immediately,

401
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:06,415
- or I am leaving... today!
- But...

402
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,688
- Five minutes.
- Sarah, I can't just...

403
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:12,695
Oh, yes, you can just.

404
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:17,796
[Sighs]

405
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:19,961
I don't think five minutes
is very long.

406
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,674
[Sighs]

407
00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:34,450
Anybody home?

408
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:36,452
Oh, come in, Matthew.

409
00:27:38,255 --> 00:27:41,019
Well, l-I didn't know
you was having a party.

410
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:43,025
[Chuckles]

411
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:48,526
What are we celebrating?

412
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:52,933
You know, Matthew,
today I made a great discovery.

413
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:57,599
Oh? What was that then?

414
00:27:57,674 --> 00:27:59,801
I'm a terrible doctor.

415
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:02,846
I'm probably
the worst doctor in the world.

416
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:06,542
Good for you.
I like a man who knows his worth.

417
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:11,316
I have absolutely no interest in
the health and welfare of my patients.

418
00:28:11,388 --> 00:28:13,754
I can't begin
to communicate with them.

419
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:15,883
I don't even want
to communicate with them.

420
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:19,759
I've come to the conclusion that, with
the possible exception of yourself,

421
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,958
I have nothing in common
with the human race.

422
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:26,002
You know, the trouble with you,
John Dolittle,

423
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:28,731
is you prefer animals to people.

424
00:28:28,805 --> 00:28:32,206
But animals are
so much more fun than people.

425
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:35,040
[Polynesia]
Then be an animal doctor. [Squawks]

426
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:42,811
- What was that?
- I said, "Be an animal doctor."

427
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:45,446
Animal doctor?

428
00:28:45,522 --> 00:28:48,753
You know more about animals
than anybody I've ever met.

429
00:28:48,825 --> 00:28:52,556
I could get every sick animal
within miles to come to you.

430
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:55,462
Aye, so could I.

431
00:28:55,532 --> 00:28:57,625
At least all the dogs and cats.

432
00:28:57,701 --> 00:29:01,330
All the rich ones, that is.
The Pekes and the poodles.

433
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:03,464
I could slip a little something
into their meat.

434
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,135
Shh, Matthew.
What do you mean?

435
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,169
I mean, there isn't one good
animal doctor in the west of England.

436
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:13,648
Farmer Green's cow was saying
only the other day...

437
00:29:13,717 --> 00:29:18,279
she just will not have another calf
until she gets a decent doctor.

438
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:20,516
You mean, you spoke to her?

439
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,524
At the Animals' Welfare League.

440
00:29:22,592 --> 00:29:25,186
We meet every Wednesday.
She's chair-cow.

441
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:29,358
You mean, animals actually
talk to one another?

442
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:32,300
Well, of course, we can.
Do you think we're all dumb?

443
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:35,861
L... No, no.
I knew parrots could talk.

444
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:39,375
Parrots are the finest linguists
in the animal kingdom.

445
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:43,607
I speak over 2,000 languages,
including dodo and unicorn.

446
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,480
- Unicorn?
- I have a classical education.

447
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:51,351
Polynesia, could I learn
to talk to animals?

448
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:54,652
I don't see why not.
You're quite intelligent.

449
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:56,659
Oh, thank you.

450
00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:00,860
If I succeeded, I could become...

451
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:03,900
the greatest animal doctor
in the world.

452
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:06,993
Oh, no question.
Mind you, it isn't easy.

453
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,038
I'm the only parrot
in the world...

454
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:12,598
who actually understands
what she's talking about. [Squawks]

455
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:15,201
Well, if you can do it,
I don't see why I shouldn't.

456
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:17,269
I like your attitude.

457
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:19,850
Why have I never thought
of this before?

458
00:30:19,983 --> 00:30:23,282
Polynesia, I want you
to teach me everything you know.

459
00:30:23,353 --> 00:30:25,719
What, 2,000 languages?

460
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:28,189
Certainly. We'll start
at 8:00 tomorrow morning.

461
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:30,692
But it took me
over a hundred years.

462
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,593
Then we'll start at 7:00.
There's not a moment to lose.

463
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:36,154
Matthew, think
what it would mean...

464

[music] If I could talk
to the animals [music]

465

506
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:15,355
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me, Polynesia.

507
00:33:15,425 --> 00:33:17,359
I can't wait to start.

[Pig Snorts]

509
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:25,329
Just the very thing.

510
00:33:25,402 --> 00:33:27,336
For instance, Polynesia,
how would I say...

511
00:33:27,404 --> 00:33:29,338
"good morning"
to our friend there?

512
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:31,340
In pig talk, I mean.

513
00:33:31,408 --> 00:33:33,774
That's simple.
[Snorts]

514
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:38,743
- Was that it?
- Why, yes.

515
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:42,410
It's remarkable.
What was all the leg-shaking business?

516
00:33:42,485 --> 00:33:44,476
That's part of "good morning."

517
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:47,887
Most animal languages are
a mixture of sounds and movements.

518
00:33:47,957 --> 00:33:50,221
A short snort means "good."

519
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:52,386
Shaking the leg means "morning."

520
00:33:52,462 --> 00:33:55,124
And you... And you
just put the two together?

521
00:33:55,198 --> 00:33:57,894
That's right.
[Squawks]

Didn't answer me.

524
00:34:12,515 --> 00:34:15,951
No, that's your right leg.
That means "good night."

525
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:19,477
Oh.
[Snorts]

Did you see that? She answered.

All I went was...
[Snorts]

604
00:39:00,002 --> 00:39:03,631
These field mice are always getting
caught in General Bellowes' pantry...

605
00:39:03,706 --> 00:39:05,640
up at the Grange.

606
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:09,109
Being a military man, he has
a regular defense system of mousetraps,

607
00:39:09,178 --> 00:39:12,011
and they're all having
very narrow escapes, like this one.

608
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:14,447
[Squeaking]

609
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:17,077
There we are.
That should do it. Good as new.

610
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:20,852
- There.
- [Squeaking]

611
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:23,915
[Squeaking]
No, no, no charge.

612
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:27,394
But, uh, keep away
from General Bellowes' pantry.

613
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:30,523
- Next.
- [Yips]

614
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,468
[Yips] Good morning, Sheila.
On the desk, please, Stubbins.

615
00:39:34,537 --> 00:39:36,471
Yes, sir.

616
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:43,411
[Yipping]

617
00:39:47,683 --> 00:39:49,617
[Yipping]

618
00:39:49,685 --> 00:39:52,950
[Yipping]

619
00:39:53,022 --> 00:39:55,582
- Oh, I see.
- What's the matter?

620
00:39:55,658 --> 00:39:57,785
Apparently one of her children
have got flat feet.

621
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,626
This one? Yes.
Very dangerous in hunting season.

622
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:05,360
Can't run fast enough.
I'll work out some form of exercise.

623
00:40:05,435 --> 00:40:07,767
[Yipping]

624
00:40:07,837 --> 00:40:10,635
Bum-bum. Bum-bum.

625
00:40:10,706 --> 00:40:12,674
Bum-bum. Something like that.

626
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:15,870
Anyhow, we'd better see
our other patients first.

627
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:17,970
I can get on with this later.

628
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:21,448
[Barking]

629
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:23,451
Good boy, Jip.

630
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:27,455
[Squawks]
Uh-oh.

631
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:34,920
Ah, Toggle.

632
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:38,266

00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,200
Oh, yes, of course.

635
00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:46,070
Toggle's getting a bit
shortsighted in his old age.

636
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:52,377
There now.
We'll just, uh, test these.

637
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,716
Now, I'm sure this will be better
than the last time.

Good Lord. That's excellent.

644
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:30,811
Polynesia, remember
Toggle owes me a free ride...

645
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:32,980
next time I have to go
to Plymouth or Penzance.

646
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:34,989
Yes, Doctor.

647
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:38,220
[Man] What the devil! Emma, I'll
murder him if I lay my hands on him!

648
00:41:38,294 --> 00:41:40,728
- That's Bellowes' voice.
- Damn it! What's the matter?

649
00:41:40,796 --> 00:41:43,321
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

650
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:45,959
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

651
00:41:47,904 --> 00:41:50,168
There he is.
We've caught him red-handed.

652
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,173
- Emma, you're a witness.
- A witness to what?

653
00:41:52,241 --> 00:41:54,175
The most flagrant display
of organized animal stealing...

654
00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:56,177
in the history
of Puddleby crime.

655
00:41:56,245 --> 00:42:00,944
Organized? I beg...
I am a doctor, sir.

656
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:05,750
You are a horse thief, sir.
That is my plow horse.

657
00:42:05,821 --> 00:42:07,755
It's no good
your trying to disguise him.

658
00:42:07,823 --> 00:42:10,314
He's wearing glasses
because he's shortsighted.

659
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:13,055
I'd recognize him anywhere.

660
00:42:13,129 --> 00:42:16,860
Take them off. At once, sir.

661
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:20,664
Shortsighted. That won't sound very
convincing in front of the magistrate.

662
00:42:20,736 --> 00:42:22,897
- Magistrate?
- I'm prosecuting,

663
00:42:22,972 --> 00:42:25,202
and I don't fancy
your chances in court.

664
00:42:25,274 --> 00:42:28,402
I'm the magistrate,
and if I weren't late for my foxhunt,

665
00:42:28,477 --> 00:42:31,742
- I'd report you for cruelty to animals.
- [Foxes Yipping]

666
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,254
Don't you dare lay a finger on her.

667
00:42:39,322 --> 00:42:41,256
- She's one of my patients.
- One of your what?

668
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:44,122
She's been chased by your wretched
foxhounds three times in two weeks.

669
00:42:44,193 --> 00:42:46,058
You've already murdered her husband.

670
00:42:46,128 --> 00:42:49,427
If anything happened to her,
these babies are going to be orphans.

671
00:42:49,498 --> 00:42:51,625
It's all right, Sheila.
I won't let him hurt you.

672
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:54,465
I've never heard... Sheila?

673
00:42:54,537 --> 00:42:57,267
Just the sight of you is enough
to give her a heart attack.

674
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,604
Look at her.
She's a complete nervous wreck.

675
00:42:59,675 --> 00:43:02,235
She'll be more than that
by the time I'm finished with her!

676
00:43:02,311 --> 00:43:04,302
[Shrieking]

677
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,847
- You'll never catch her.
- Tallyho!

678
00:43:09,885 --> 00:43:13,252
[Barking]

679
00:43:13,322 --> 00:43:16,655
There are times when the English
are rather tiresome.

680
00:43:16,726 --> 00:43:18,660
[Dogs Barking]

681
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:24,658
- Bellowes, no!
- [Barking]

682
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:28,602
[Bellowes]
Out of my way! [Shouting]

683
00:43:30,072 --> 00:43:33,371
- Out of my way! Out of my way!
- Oh, well.

684
00:43:33,442 --> 00:43:37,344
[Dogs Yelping]

685
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:39,347
"Never catch her," eh?

686
00:43:39,415 --> 00:43:42,316
What do you think this is?

687
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:46,350
- [Whinnying]
- My horse!

688
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:49,118
[Barking]

689
00:43:59,368 --> 00:44:01,859
- Where did they come from?
- North America.

690
00:44:01,937 --> 00:44:04,405
We formed an Anglo-American
Fox Protection Society.

691
00:44:04,473 --> 00:44:06,407
Purely volunteer, of course.

692
00:44:06,475 --> 00:44:09,740
[Yipping]

693
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:14,008
Fox Protection Society?

694
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:17,109
Yes. During the hunting season,
a skunk will always run with a fox.

695
00:44:17,186 --> 00:44:19,245
The idea is to put
the hounds off the scent.

696
00:44:19,321 --> 00:44:21,255
I never dreamt
it would work so well.

697
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:24,019
- How dare you!
- I beg your pardon?

698
00:44:24,093 --> 00:44:26,027
- General Bellowes...
- He certainly does.

699
00:44:26,095 --> 00:44:28,529
- Is my uncle.
- I'm sorry.

700
00:44:28,597 --> 00:44:30,895
- Is that an apology?
- I'm sorry he's your uncle.

701
00:44:30,966 --> 00:44:32,900
And I'm sorry I'm his niece.

702
00:44:32,968 --> 00:44:35,061
- It must be terrible.
- What do you mean?

703
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:37,071
Having a name like Bellowes.

704
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:40,540
- My name is Emma Fairfax.
- Oh, that's a bit better.

705
00:44:40,609 --> 00:44:44,045
What I meant was that if I were
his nephew instead of his niece...

706
00:44:44,113 --> 00:44:46,741
If you were his nephew,
you'd hardly be called Emma Fairfax.

707
00:44:46,816 --> 00:44:49,341
- If I were a man...
- Fred Fairfax?

708
00:44:49,418 --> 00:44:51,511
I have never
in my entire experience...

709
00:44:51,587 --> 00:44:55,182
known anyone treat people
as appallingly as you do.

710
00:44:55,257 --> 00:44:57,589
I don't treat people, madam.
I treat animals.

711
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,594
You treat people like animals too.

712
00:44:59,662 --> 00:45:01,892
And I have nothing but contempt
for people whose idea of pleasure...

713
00:45:01,964 --> 00:45:05,365
is to take a defenseless animal and make
a social event out of a ritual killing.

714
00:45:05,434 --> 00:45:08,130
- That's it, John Dolittle. You tell her.
- Matthew, I am telling her.

715
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:10,172
- You make it sound...
- Furthermore...

716
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:13,606
- Don't keep interrupting me!
- I'm sorry. What did you wish to say?

717
00:45:13,676 --> 00:45:15,735
Oh, I've forgotten!

718
00:45:15,811 --> 00:45:17,870
Very well. Furthermore, I would deem it
a favor if in the future...

719
00:45:17,947 --> 00:45:19,881
you and your
bloodthirsty relatives...

720
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:21,883
would avoid coming here
and upsetting the animals.

721
00:45:21,951 --> 00:45:25,250
In any case, I find it hard
to believe that a grown man...

722
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:29,121
can waste his entire life
playing with animals in the first place.

723
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:31,250
And I, madam, find it
equally hard to believe...

724
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:34,558
that a grown woman could spend her
entire life doing absolutely nothing.

725
00:45:39,468 --> 00:45:42,301
You got to admit that
for someone called Fred,

726
00:45:42,371 --> 00:45:44,741
she's a fair-looking fellow.

727
00:45:51,848 --> 00:45:54,282
[Music] If I were a man [music]

728
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:57,183
[Music] I'd scratch his eyes out [music]

729
00:45:57,253 --> 00:46:00,017
[Music] I'd tear his hair out
by the roots [music]

730
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:03,081
[Music] And kick his shins in
with my boots [music]

731
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:06,492
[Music] And I would bite his hand
as only I can [music]

732
00:46:06,562 --> 00:46:10,589
[Music] If only I could be a man [music]

733
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:15,427
[Music] A great man would not hesitate [music]

734
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:18,440
[Music] To put Dr. Dolittle to death [music]

735
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:21,272
[Music] Attila the Hun
To name only one [music]

736
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:25,337
[Music] Would chuckle at his dying breath [music]

737
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:30,517
[Music] It seems a man can be
as rude as he likes [music]

738
00:46:30,586 --> 00:46:32,986
[Music] Crude as he likes
Lewd as he likes too [music]

739
00:46:36,592 --> 00:46:40,187
[Music] But a girl must be
discreet as she can [music]

740
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:45,166
[Music] Sweet as she can
Neat as she can too [music]

741
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:56,200
[Music] But that's not the life [music]

742
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:58,907
[Music] That I want to lead [music]

743
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:03,850
[Music] Normal and formal
as homespun tweed [music]

744
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,220
[Music] I need the freedom to go [music]

745
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:10,782
[Music] Where I please [music]

746
00:47:12,028 --> 00:47:14,155
[Music] But where [music]

747
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:16,221
[Music] Do I please [music]

748
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:19,496
[Music] I don't know [music]

749
00:47:19,569 --> 00:47:23,369
[Music] That's the trouble [music]

750
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:29,344
[Music] I don't know [music]

751
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:36,878
[Music] Here I stand
at the crossroads of life [music]

752
00:47:36,953 --> 00:47:39,421
[Music] Childhood behind me [music]

753
00:47:39,488 --> 00:47:42,423
[Music] The future to come [music]

754
00:47:44,594 --> 00:47:47,586
[Music] And alone [music]

755
00:47:51,234 --> 00:47:57,571
[Music] Nothing planned
at the crossroads of life [music]

756
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,904
[Music] But life will find me [music]

757
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:02,968
[Music] More grateful than some [music]

758
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:10,152
[Music] It has known [music]

759
00:48:12,054 --> 00:48:14,921
[Music] Grateful to see [music]

760
00:48:14,991 --> 00:48:20,019
[Music] All the wonderful things I see [music]

761
00:48:20,096 --> 00:48:22,792
[Music] Grateful to be [music]

762
00:48:22,865 --> 00:48:28,303
[Music] What life expects me to be [music]

763
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:36,377
[Music] So I stand
at the crossroads of life [music]

764
00:48:36,445 --> 00:48:38,879
[Music] This way or that way [music]

765
00:48:38,948 --> 00:48:43,180
[Music] Well, which shall I go [music]

766
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:50,521
[Music] Towards the left
or the right [music]

767
00:48:50,593 --> 00:48:54,689
[Music] Towards the day
or the night [music]

768
00:48:54,764 --> 00:49:01,067
[Music] Towards the dark
or the light [music]

769
00:49:01,137 --> 00:49:06,632
[Music] Only my heart can know [music]

770
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:13,148
[Music] Only my heart [music]

771
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:21,249
[Music] Can know [music]

772
00:49:29,298 --> 00:49:32,756
[Trilling]

773
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:42,802
- What is it?
- Ha. I don't know, Doctor.
It just arrived for ya.

774
00:49:42,878 --> 00:49:45,346
- It's making funny noises.
- [Trilling]

775
00:49:45,414 --> 00:49:48,349
- Extraordinary-looking thing.
- It's from Tibet.

776
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:50,783
It's probably that pink sea snail
you was lookin' for.

777
00:49:50,853 --> 00:49:52,821
No, it's not big enough for that.

778
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:54,822
What do you suppose it is?

779
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,824
Well, we could always
open it and find out.

780
00:49:56,892 --> 00:49:58,826
Oh, yes. What a good idea.

781
00:50:02,465 --> 00:50:05,400
Ah. Oh, look, it's a llama.

782
00:50:05,468 --> 00:50:07,402
- Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
- [Grunts]

783
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:11,930
I think he's nervous. Open up the
other end and give him a push, Matthew.

784
00:50:13,342 --> 00:50:16,743
- Here.
- [Trilling]

785
00:50:16,812 --> 00:50:19,576
There's another one at this end.
There's two of them.

786
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:22,845
Two llamas? How thoughtful of somebody.
People are awfully nice.

787
00:50:22,918 --> 00:50:25,614
- What are you going to do with them?
- We could make ourselves...

788
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:27,849
a couple of nice overcoats
for a start.

789
00:50:27,923 --> 00:50:30,892
[Trills]
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.

790
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,121
[Matthew]
This way, lad. Come on. Come on.

791
00:50:33,195 --> 00:50:36,528
That's a good fella.
[Chuckles]

792
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:40,228
I don't believe it. It can't be.

793
00:50:41,937 --> 00:50:44,462
- It is! It is!
- What? What? What?

794
00:50:47,943 --> 00:50:49,877
It's a pushmi-pullyu.

795
00:50:49,945 --> 00:50:52,846
- Look.
- Holy O'Reilly. Forgive me.

796
00:50:52,915 --> 00:50:54,849
I'll never touch another drop.

797
00:50:54,917 --> 00:50:57,010
Stubbins, pat the other end.
They're very timid.

798
00:50:57,086 --> 00:50:59,884
This is without doubt the first one
that's ever been captured.

799
00:50:59,955 --> 00:51:02,719
If I had a head at each end,
I'd take a bit of catchin' too.

800
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:05,226
[Trilling]

801
00:51:07,997 --> 00:51:10,625
- What's he saying, Doctor?
- It's rather difficult to understand.

802
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:13,293
It's a camel dialect
with rather a thick accent.

803
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:16,167
[Trilling]

804
00:51:16,238 --> 00:51:20,231
- A message? Oh, a message for me.
- Is this it?

805
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:22,800
Ah, yes, it's from Long Arrow.
I should have guessed.

806
00:51:22,878 --> 00:51:24,812
Who's he when he's at home?

807
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,178
The greatest naturalist in the world
and a very old friend.

808
00:51:27,249 --> 00:51:29,308
- He's a Red Indian gentleman.
- With a name like Long Arrow,

809
00:51:29,385 --> 00:51:31,319
I didn't think he was Irish.

810
00:51:31,387 --> 00:51:33,321
- What's all them drawings, Doctor?
- Picture writing.

811
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:35,323
It's the only way
we can communicate.

812
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:38,383
You see, this means
the pushmi-pullyu is a gift.

813
00:51:38,461 --> 00:51:41,624
The open hand, you see?
For me. That's me.

814
00:51:41,697 --> 00:51:44,461
From his friend, Long Arrow.

815
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:46,558
To make money to take a ship...

816
00:51:46,635 --> 00:51:49,695
to search for great pink sea snail.

817
00:51:49,772 --> 00:51:53,264
Signed Long Arrow.

818
00:51:53,342 --> 00:51:55,276
Oh, that's marvelous.

819
00:51:55,344 --> 00:51:59,041
But tell me, Doctor, how do you
make money with a pushmi-pullyu?

820
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:02,983
I thought it was obvious. Stubbins,
what would you do if you had two heads?

821
00:52:03,052 --> 00:52:05,646
- I'd join a circus, sir.
- Exactly.

822
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,823
Excuse me. I'm looking
for the proprietor.

823
00:52:12,895 --> 00:52:14,829
You've found him. Albert Blossom.

824
00:52:14,897 --> 00:52:18,128
- Splendid. How do you do?
My name's Dolittle.
- I'm not interested.

825
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,465
- I thought you might like
to see a rather unusual...
- No, I wouldn't.

826
00:52:21,537 --> 00:52:23,767
It's probably something
you haven't seen before.

827
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,898
I've seen everything before.

828
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:28,967
- Then you aren't interested?
- That's right. I'm not interested.

829
00:52:29,044 --> 00:52:30,978
Come along, Matthew.

830
00:52:33,082 --> 00:52:37,451
- Sorry to have troubled you. Good day.
- Good day.

831
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,754
- It's a trick.
- No, it's no trick.

832
00:52:43,826 --> 00:52:47,762
Why... But... I've never
seen anything like it.

833
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:50,594
- Neither has anybody else.
- Hey, whoa! I say, come here!
Just a minute.

834
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:55,069
Hey, hey! I mean,
l-I've never seen anything like it.

835
00:52:55,137 --> 00:52:57,662
[Music] I mean, I've seen the world
I've been around [music]

836
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,208
[Music] I can tell you stories
that would quite astound you [music]

837
00:53:00,276 --> 00:53:02,210
[Music] I'm not a fool
I went to school [music]

838
00:53:02,278 --> 00:53:04,212
[Music] I've been from
Liverpool to Istanbul [music]

839
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,840
[Music] Istanbul, I'm no fool [music]

840
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:10,613
[Music] And anyone will tell you that
I'm sharper than a knife [music]

841
00:53:10,686 --> 00:53:14,019
[Music] But I've never seen anything
like it in my life [music]

842
00:53:14,089 --> 00:53:16,023
- It's a pushmi-pullyu.
- Is it?

843
00:53:16,091 --> 00:53:19,720
[Music] Well, I've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it [music]

844
00:53:19,795 --> 00:53:22,662
[Music] I've never seen anything
like it in my life [music]

845
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:26,531
- It's the rarest animal on Earth.
- It certainly is!

846
00:53:26,602 --> 00:53:28,536
Hey, hold up a moment. Hey!

847
00:53:28,604 --> 00:53:30,970
[Music] I mean, I know the game
I've seen them all [music]

848
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,201
[Music] I could tell you stories that
would quite enthrall you [music]

849
00:53:33,275 --> 00:53:35,300
[Music] I know me job
Pleasin' the mob [music]

850
00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:37,641
[Music] I give 'em what they want
for just two bob [music]

851
00:53:37,713 --> 00:53:39,772
[Music]Just two bob
Well, that's my job [music]

852
00:53:39,848 --> 00:53:44,342
[Music] But this is so fantastic
I can't wait to tell the wife [music]

853
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,253
[Music] Gertie, you've never seen
anything like it in your life [music]

854
00:53:47,323 --> 00:53:49,257
Come on out!

855
00:53:49,325 --> 00:53:52,988
[Music] You've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it [music]

856
00:53:53,062 --> 00:53:56,361
[Music] You've never seen anything
like it in your life [music]

857
00:53:56,432 --> 00:53:59,526
It's a bicranium, madam.

858
00:53:59,602 --> 00:54:03,800
Arthur! Charlie! Joe!

859
00:54:03,872 --> 00:54:05,806
Come and have a look at this!

860
00:54:05,874 --> 00:54:08,342
Beverly, get Joe!

861
00:54:13,115 --> 00:54:17,381
[Music] I thought I'd seen
every wonder in the world [music]

862
00:54:17,453 --> 00:54:21,583
[Music] I've seen the Colosseum
in Rome and the Acropolis [music]

863
00:54:21,657 --> 00:54:26,287
[Music] I've made the biggest blunder
in the world [music]

864
00:54:26,362 --> 00:54:31,197
- [Music] 'Cause I've never seen
anything quite like this [music]
- [Shrieks]

865
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:33,758
Now look what you've done!
You've frightened him!

866
00:54:33,836 --> 00:54:35,895
Hey, come back! Come back!

867
00:54:42,878 --> 00:54:45,039
[Music] I'm down to earth
I'll tell you straight [music]

868
00:54:45,114 --> 00:54:47,207
[Music] I could tell you stories
that would fascinate you [music]

869
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:49,217
[Music] I know the trade
I know the tricks [music]

870
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:51,253
[Music] I once bought an elephant
for two pound six [music]

871
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,413
[Music] Two pound six
Taught it tricks [music]

872
00:54:53,489 --> 00:54:57,789
- [Music] But for your pushmi-pullyu
I'd pay three pounds [music]
- [Crowd Gasps]

873
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,624
- Four pounds!
- [Gasps]

874
00:55:00,696 --> 00:55:02,630
Five!

875
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:06,725
[Music] 'Cause I've never seen anything
like it that's alive [music]

876
00:55:06,802 --> 00:55:09,828
I tell you what.
I'd even pay for it in cash.

877
00:55:09,905 --> 00:55:13,341
Five? That wasn't exactly
what we had in mind.

878
00:55:13,409 --> 00:55:17,607
[Music] Because, you see, pushmi-pullyus
are remarkable creatures [music]

879
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,240
[Music] Of all God's animals
they're the cleverest [music]

880
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:23,774
[Music] They develop these remarkable features
running up and down Mount Everest [music]

881
00:55:23,852 --> 00:55:26,582
- No!
- Yes! Absolutely true.

882
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:29,317
Runnin' up and down
Mount Everest?

883
00:55:29,391 --> 00:55:31,484
Exactly. You see...

884
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,087
[music] Running up and down the mountain
gives them very nimble feet [music]

885
00:55:35,164 --> 00:55:37,598
[Music] Put them on the right rope
They could walk a tightrope [music]

886
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:39,634
[Music] That should give the audience
a rare old treat [music]

887
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:43,194
[Music] And this extreme agility
begets a rare ability [music]

888
00:55:43,272 --> 00:55:46,799
[Music] Shared only with
the mountain goats of France [music]

889
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:50,868
- [Music] The pushmi-pullyu loves to dance [music]
- [Gasping]

890
00:55:52,548 --> 00:55:57,315
- [Trills]
- [Both Trilling]

891
00:56:26,415 --> 00:56:29,646
I'll give you
anything you want.

892
00:56:29,718 --> 00:56:32,209
- The terms are quite simple.
- Anything you want!

893
00:56:32,287 --> 00:56:34,221
- Four-week engagement.
- Right!

894
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:36,416
- Share all profits equally.
- Right.

895
00:56:36,492 --> 00:56:38,790
Two performances a day.

896
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:42,092
Oh, uh, no, uh,
four performances a day.

897
00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:44,098
Just a minute.

898
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:47,897
- [Trilling]
- [Trills]

899
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,336
- [Trilling]
- [Trills]

900
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:52,840
We have a problem.

901
00:56:52,908 --> 00:56:56,503
[Trilling Continues]

902
00:56:56,578 --> 00:56:58,671
Well, what do they want?

903
00:56:58,747 --> 00:57:01,648
Three shows a day.

904
00:57:01,717 --> 00:57:03,947
And four on Saturday?

905
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:06,351
[Trilling]

906
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,617
- [Both Trilling]
- They agree.

907
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,248
Done!

908
00:57:31,914 --> 00:57:34,508
[Music] La, la-la, la [music]

909
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:36,278
[Music] La, la, la, la, la [music]

910
00:57:51,533 --> 00:57:54,730
- My dear Dolittle!
- Oh, I'm awfully sorry.

911
00:58:20,195 --> 00:58:22,663
You've never seen
anything like it!

912
00:58:22,731 --> 00:58:24,665
I've never seen
anything like it.

913
00:58:32,207 --> 00:58:35,301
Dolittle, me.

914
00:58:38,213 --> 00:58:39,544
Thank you.

915
00:58:42,084 --> 00:58:46,350
[music][Orchestral]

916
00:58:52,794 --> 00:58:54,728
- Me.
- No, Dolittle. [Squawks]

917
00:58:54,796 --> 00:58:56,730
[Laughs]

918
00:59:49,217 --> 00:59:52,050
[Music] I mean, you're not a fool [music]

919
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,611
[Music] Neither am I [music]

920
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:59,855
[Music] I could tell you stories
that would stultify you [music]

921
00:59:59,928 --> 01:00:04,228
[Music] Open your eyes
What do you see [music]

922
01:00:04,299 --> 01:00:09,635
[Music] This thing's a miracle
for you and me [music]

923
01:00:09,705 --> 01:00:12,902
[Music] Guarantee [music]

924
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:15,910
[Music] I agree [music]

925
01:00:15,978 --> 01:00:20,506
[Music] Within a meager month
I've seen my wildest dreams come true [music]

926
01:00:20,582 --> 01:00:24,712
[Music] 'Cause I've never seen anything
like it nor have you [music]

927
01:00:24,786 --> 01:00:29,158
[Music] Oh, I've never seen anything like it
Never seen anything like it [music]

928
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:31,156
[Music] I've never seen
anything like it [music]

929
01:00:31,226 --> 01:00:35,595
[Music] In all my [music]

930
01:00:35,664 --> 01:00:37,757
[Music] Life [music]

931
01:00:47,209 --> 01:00:50,076
[Man]
What's the matter with you, Sophie?

932
01:00:50,145 --> 01:00:53,876
Come on, Sophie. Catch it.

933
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:57,885
- [Moaning]
- Try again, Sophie.

934
01:01:01,223 --> 01:01:03,555
Come on, Sophie.

935
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:05,923
- That's yours.
- Oh, thanks.

936
01:01:05,994 --> 01:01:09,327
Right, well,
I'm off to the bank.

937
01:01:09,398 --> 01:01:13,664
Ah, here we are now. "Seals are
notoriously sentimental creatures.

938
01:01:13,735 --> 01:01:16,863
Prolonged separation from
those they love can result...

939
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:19,874
in complete lack of interest
in their usual activities."

940
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:22,877
That would explain why Sophie
keeps dropping things in her act.

941
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:26,381
It isn't like her.
I'm sure she's pining for some reason.

942
01:01:26,448 --> 01:01:29,611
I must go and have a chat with her.
This fellow obviously knows
what he's talking about.

943
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:33,451
- Who wrote the book, Doctor?
- Uh, oh, I did.

944
01:01:33,522 --> 01:01:35,581
- Hmm.
- [Woman]Just a moment!

945
01:01:35,657 --> 01:01:37,750
I have something to say to you,

946
01:01:37,826 --> 01:01:40,920
- Mr. Dolittle.
- Doctor.

947
01:01:40,996 --> 01:01:43,021
Doctor?

948
01:01:43,098 --> 01:01:48,035
I've heard of some hypocrites
in my time, but you are contemptible!

949
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:52,335
All that sanctimonious claptrap
about protecting defenseless creatures,

950
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:56,343
and here you are an animal trainer
in a cheap circus!

951
01:01:56,411 --> 01:01:58,902
Exhibiting freaks!

952
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,046
Come, lad. Why don't you go
and make some cocoa?

953
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,454
- I don't want any cocoa, do you?
- I'd love some, lad. Yes. Off you go.

954
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:11,459
Hello, Fred.

955
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:14,860
He is... He's very rude.

956
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:19,264
Who, the doctor?
Oh, no, not at all. He's a darlin' man.

957
01:02:19,334 --> 01:02:21,962
Did you hear what
he said about my uncle?

958
01:02:22,037 --> 01:02:26,940
Oh, that, yeah, well,
he's a darlin' man, but he's very rude.

959
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:31,776
Of course, I wouldn't mind so much
except everything he said was true.

960
01:02:31,847 --> 01:02:35,180
You should never believe anybody
who goes around tellin' the truth.

961
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,218
- They're not to be trusted.
- [Trilling]

962
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:42,815
- [Trills]
- Ya have to do it both ends.
Otherwise it gets jealous.

963
01:02:42,891 --> 01:02:46,554
He was too ashamed to say
anything just now, of course.

964
01:02:46,628 --> 01:02:49,688
- Too nice.
- Nice?

965
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:52,893
He's the kindest man
on God's Earth, Fred.

966
01:02:52,968 --> 01:02:57,098
He understands animals better than you
and me will ever understand anythin'.

967
01:02:57,172 --> 01:03:00,403
Well, I certainly
don't understand him.

968
01:03:00,475 --> 01:03:04,343
Ah, sure, now.
He's one of the beautiful people.

969
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:07,780
And I'm sure now
he's one of the horrible people.

970
01:03:07,849 --> 01:03:10,044
You're wrong, sweetheart.

971
01:03:10,252 --> 01:03:13,380
[Music] I can't explain
what it is that he is [music]

972
01:03:13,455 --> 01:03:18,119
[Music] But he is what he is
for a very good reason [music]

973
01:03:18,193 --> 01:03:21,685
[Music] I can't explain why he does
what he does [music]

974
01:03:21,763 --> 01:03:26,291
[Music] But he does what he does
'cause his heart is pure [music]

975
01:03:26,368 --> 01:03:29,132
[Music] Of that much [music]
[Chuckles]

976
01:03:29,204 --> 01:03:32,503
[Music] I am sure [music]

977
01:03:32,574 --> 01:03:36,510
[Music] I'm sure as I told
young Tom the other day [music]

978
01:03:36,578 --> 01:03:39,945
[Music] He lives in
a world of fantasy [music]

979
01:03:40,015 --> 01:03:44,884
[Music] And that is a world
I plan to see, fantasy [music]

980
01:03:46,054 --> 01:03:50,354
[Music] Can't you see [music]

981
01:03:50,425 --> 01:03:55,192
[Music] The world is full
of beautiful things [music]

982
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:59,200
[Music] Butterfly wings
Fairy tale kings [music]

983
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:02,931
[Music] And each new day
undoubtedly brings [music]

984
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:06,873
[Music] Still more beautiful things [music]

985
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:13,047
[Music] The world abounds
with many delights [music]

986
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:16,607
[Music] Magical sights
Fanciful flights [music]

987
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:20,587
[Music] And those who dream
on beautiful nights [music]

988
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:23,989
[Music] Dream of beautiful things [music]

989
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:29,894
[Music] Beautiful days
for sunshine lazin' [music]

990
01:04:29,965 --> 01:04:33,526
[Music] Beautiful skies and shores [music]

991
01:04:33,602 --> 01:04:37,504
[Music] Beautiful days
when I can gaze [music]

992
01:04:37,572 --> 01:04:40,405
[Music] In beautiful eyes [music]

993
01:04:40,475 --> 01:04:43,740
[Chuckles]
[Music] Like yours [music]

994
01:05:13,241 --> 01:05:18,770
[Music] Our lives tick by
like a pendulum swings [music]

995
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:22,806
[Music] Poor little things
Puppets on strings [music]

996
01:05:22,884 --> 01:05:25,216
[Music] But life is full [music]

997
01:05:25,287 --> 01:05:30,088
[Music] Of beautiful things [music]

998
01:05:30,158 --> 01:05:32,683
[Music] Beautiful people [music]

999
01:05:32,761 --> 01:05:35,491
[Music] Too [music]

1000
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:40,433
[Music] Beautiful people [music]

1001
01:05:40,502 --> 01:05:43,164
[Music] Like [music]

1002
01:05:43,238 --> 01:05:54,046
[Music] You [music]

1003
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:04,886
- [Moaning]
- I see. I see.

1004
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,895
[Moaning Continues]

1005
01:06:07,963 --> 01:06:10,727
I'm sorry. Hmm.

1006
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:13,097
Ah, cocoa.
Come in, gentlemen.

1007
01:06:13,168 --> 01:06:15,966
You know Sophie, don't you?
Oh, yes, of course you do.

1008
01:06:16,037 --> 01:06:18,369
It seems we have
a problem on our hands.

1009
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,874
Sophie's just been telling me
how much she misses her husband.

1010
01:06:20,942 --> 01:06:24,139
That's why she couldn't concentrate
on her performance, just as I thought.

1011
01:06:24,212 --> 01:06:27,306
- Where is her husband?
- The North Pole. That's the problem.

1012
01:06:27,382 --> 01:06:30,180
They were on their way there
when Sophie was captured.

1013
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:33,983
If she doesn't get back to him,
she feels she's going to go
completely to pieces.

1014
01:06:34,055 --> 01:06:36,751
What do you want us to do?
Go to the North Pole?

1015
01:06:36,825 --> 01:06:39,293
Unfortunately, there isn't time,
but it's very pleasant up there.

1016
01:06:39,361 --> 01:06:41,556
But the North Pole
hasn't been discovered yet.

1017
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:45,623
Not officially.
I'd never say anything about it.
I promised the polar bears I wouldn't.

1018
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,895
Anyway, that's beside the point.

1019
01:06:47,969 --> 01:06:50,904
What we've got to do is
to get Sophie back to her husband.

1020
01:06:50,972 --> 01:06:53,634
Now, if I could get her
to the Bristol Channel,

1021
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:56,006
she could swim it
in about a week.

1022
01:06:56,077 --> 01:07:01,606
You go along there,
around that bit, then straight on
and then slightly to the left.

1023
01:07:01,683 --> 01:07:05,915
Oh, that's great, but how does
she get to the Bristol Channel?

1024
01:07:05,987 --> 01:07:10,720
- Well, she'd have to escape.
- Escape? A seal?

1025
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:14,785
I can hardly go to Blossom
and say she wanted to go to
the North Pole to see her husband.

1026
01:07:14,863 --> 01:07:16,854
He wouldn't believe a word.

1027
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:19,366
- You know something?
- What?

1028
01:07:19,434 --> 01:07:23,234
- She's gonna have to escape.
- Tonight.

1029
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:08,174
[Moaning]

1030
01:08:10,185 --> 01:08:12,119
[Horn Blowing]

1031
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:19,985
[Horn Blowing]

1032
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:39,213
- [Barks]
- Shh. Shh.

1033
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:26,394
[Sophie Moans]

1034
01:09:26,461 --> 01:09:31,592
- Is everything all right, sir?
- It's my grandmother.
She's not very well.

1035
01:09:31,666 --> 01:09:34,100
I'm taking her to Bristol.

1036
01:09:35,737 --> 01:09:38,501
- Can you smell fish?
- Fish?

1037
01:09:38,573 --> 01:09:43,169
It's Granny.
She's on a special diet.

1038
01:09:43,244 --> 01:09:45,712
Very wise, sir.

1039
01:10:13,141 --> 01:10:16,770
[Moans, Burps]

1040
01:10:24,953 --> 01:10:27,012
[Burps]

1041
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:45,269
Are you all right, dear?
Enjoying the trip?

1042
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:48,036
- [Exhales]
- Oh, that's good.

1043
01:11:04,092 --> 01:11:07,027
Whoa! Whoa!

1044
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:11,632
[Man] What's the delay?
What's going on there?

1045
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:15,500
Jack Fitch, the highwayman,
has been seen on this road.
We have to search all coaches.

1046
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:18,835
Help yourself.
You'll find no surprise in here.

1047
01:11:26,648 --> 01:11:28,582
[Horse Nickers]

1048
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:40,753
All right, driver.

1049
01:11:42,664 --> 01:11:44,495
[Driver]
All right, get up.

1050
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,830
All right, go on.

01:12:32,847 --> 01:12:35,247
Come back here, Nelly!
Nelly, come back here!

1054
01:12:35,316 --> 01:12:38,376
Where are you going?
Where are you going, Nelly?

1055
01:12:38,453 --> 01:12:40,978
Come on back!
Come back here, I tell ya!

1056

[Sophie Grunting]

1058
01:13:06,948 --> 01:13:11,885
Well, here we are. Sorry it was
such an uncomfortable journey,

1059
01:13:11,953 --> 01:13:14,888
but it was really the only way.

1060
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:24,891
There, there, there, Sophie.

1061
01:13:24,966 --> 01:13:29,369
Don't get upset.
I can't bear females who cry.

1062
01:13:29,437 --> 01:13:32,429
- [Cries]
- Shh. Don't look at me
like that, Sophie,

1063
01:13:32,507 --> 01:13:34,805
or I'll get upset too.

1064
01:13:34,876 --> 01:13:39,006
Dear Sophie, you understand
so much, don't you?

1065

[Music] When I look in your eyes [music]

1066
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:46,384
[Music] I see the wisdom of the world
in your eyes [music]

1067
01:13:46,454 --> 01:13:51,756
[Music] I see the sadness
of a thousand good-byes [music]

- [Moans]
- [Music] When I look in your eyes [music]
Shh, shh.

1069
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:01,900
[Music] And it is no surprise [music]

1070
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:06,737
[Music] To see the softness
of the moon in your eyes [music]

1071
01:14:06,808 --> 01:14:10,972
[Music] The gentle sparkle of
the stars in the skies [music]

[Music] In your eyes I see
the deepness of the sea [music]

- [Grunting]
- [Music]I see the deepness [music]

1076

I feel you feel for me [music]

[Music] Autumn comes, summer dies [music]

1079
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:49,775
[Music] I see the passing
of the years in your eyes [music]

1080
01:14:49,851 --> 01:14:53,981
[Music] And when we part, there will
be no tears, no good-byes [music]

1081
01:14:54,055 --> 01:14:58,685
- [Moans]
- [Music] I'll just look into your eyes [music]

01:15:00,161 --> 01:15:02,721
[Moaning]

1083
01:15:02,797 --> 01:15:06,597
[Music] Dear Sophie
Those eyes so wise [music]

1084
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:09,501
[Music] So warm, so real [music]

1085
01:15:10,972 --> 01:15:14,032
[Music] Isn't it a pity
you're a seal [music]

1086
01:15:14,108 --> 01:15:15,803
[Moans]

1087
01:15:25,253 --> 01:15:28,620
[Sophie Barking]

1088
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,658
[Barking]

1089
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,491
Well, she's on her way.

1090
01:15:37,565 --> 01:15:42,696
- What did you throw her in for?
- She wanted to go back to her husband.

1091
01:15:46,939 --> 01:15:48,804
No, you don't understand at all.

1092
01:15:48,874 --> 01:15:51,638
She wasn't a woman. She was a seal.

1093
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:54,201
- A seal?
- Yes.

1094
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,805
Dressed in a bonnet and shawl?

1095
01:15:56,882 --> 01:16:01,615
That's right. Yes. I'd sort of borrowed
it from this lady in the tavern.

1096
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:04,349
The bonnet had
a little brown ribbon through...

1097
01:16:04,423 --> 01:16:06,584
Never mind about
the brown ribbons.

1098
01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:09,753
You then took the seal
to Bristol in a stagecoach...

1099
01:16:09,829 --> 01:16:13,856
and upon arrival promptly
threw her over a cliff.

1100
01:16:13,933 --> 01:16:15,867
Exactly.

1101
01:16:15,935 --> 01:16:18,369
May one ask why?

1102
01:16:18,437 --> 01:16:23,272
Uh, certainly. Um, she wanted to go
to the North Pole to see her husband.

1103
01:16:23,342 --> 01:16:27,369
[Crowd Laughing]

1104
01:16:31,517 --> 01:16:34,145
- Her husband?
- Yes.

1105
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:37,280
What makes you think this seal
wanted to go to the North Pole?

1106
01:16:37,356 --> 01:16:40,553
- Well, she told me.
- She told you?

1107
01:16:40,626 --> 01:16:42,924
Yes, we discussed it
in great detail.

1108
01:16:42,995 --> 01:16:46,431
- [Scattered Laughing]
- Are you in the habit
of talking to animals?

1109
01:16:46,498 --> 01:16:49,126
Yes, I am.
I do it all the time.

1110
01:16:49,201 --> 01:16:53,467
- [Laughing]
- I thought perhaps you did.

1111
01:16:53,539 --> 01:16:55,700
[Laughing Continues]

1112
01:16:55,774 --> 01:17:00,370
With all due respect to
Your Worship, I think I detect
a note of skepticism in the court.

1113
01:17:00,446 --> 01:17:02,744
I would, therefore,
like an opportunity...

1114
01:17:02,815 --> 01:17:05,909
to prove the point by talking
to any animal you care to nominate.

1115
01:17:05,985 --> 01:17:09,216
[Crowd Murmuring]

1116
01:17:13,626 --> 01:17:17,653
Very well then.
My dog Rufus is outside. Bring him in!

01:17:45,858 --> 01:17:48,326
Oh, thank you very much.

1124
01:17:48,394 --> 01:17:51,591
Yes, Rufus will be only too happy
to answer any questions you care to ask.

1125
01:17:51,664 --> 01:17:53,598
[Crowd Murmuring]

1126
01:17:57,403 --> 01:18:01,305
Oh, I think we can dispense
with that formality.

1127
01:18:01,373 --> 01:18:04,137
Uh, ask him what I had
for dinner last night.

1128
01:18:04,209 --> 01:18:08,441
Very well.
[Barking]

1129
01:18:11,016 --> 01:18:12,950
Did he?

1130
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,818
Well, really? Did he?

1131
01:18:16,889 --> 01:18:19,517
- [Barking Continues]
- [Chuckling] Good Lord. Well, well.

1132
01:18:19,591 --> 01:18:21,559
- [Barking Continues]
- Did he really?

1133
01:18:21,627 --> 01:18:23,561
Well, well, well.
[Laughing]

1134
01:18:23,629 --> 01:18:25,961
- [Rufus Barks]
- What did he say?

1135
01:18:26,031 --> 01:18:30,161
I'm grateful that Your Worship
acknowledges the fact
that the dog was talking.

1136
01:18:30,235 --> 01:18:31,827
[Scattered Laughing]

1137
01:18:31,904 --> 01:18:35,396
For dinner last night,
Your Lordship enjoyed the following:

1138
01:18:35,474 --> 01:18:39,501
Two helpings of boiled trout,
four helpings of roast pheasant,

1139
01:18:39,578 --> 01:18:42,513
- roast potatoes,
brussels sprouts and gravy,
- [Crowd Exclaims]

1140
01:18:42,581 --> 01:18:46,745
Followed by six large portions
of blackberry pie with whipped cream.

1141
01:18:46,819 --> 01:18:51,654
- [Crowd Exclaims]
- It's not true! I only had
five helpings of blackberry pie!

1142
01:18:54,626 --> 01:18:57,686
Your Lordship also drank
a great deal of wine and brandy...

1143
01:18:57,763 --> 01:19:02,598
and later in the evening sang
noisy songs with your friends
about a woman from Swansea...

1144
01:19:02,668 --> 01:19:05,831
- That's enough!
- [Crowd Murmurs]

1145
01:19:07,306 --> 01:19:09,365
The court is adjourned
until tomorrow morning,

1146
01:19:09,441 --> 01:19:14,276
pending inquiries about
the bonnet and shawl stolen
from the tavern in question.

1147
01:19:18,417 --> 01:19:23,252
[Barks]
Hmm. Thank you.

1148
01:19:23,322 --> 01:19:25,916
[Barks]

1149
01:19:34,466 --> 01:19:39,699
Well, by my calculation, the trial
will be over by 11:00 tomorrow morning.

1150
01:19:39,772 --> 01:19:42,297
Polynesia, how much did
we earn from the circus?

1151
01:19:42,374 --> 01:19:46,470
[Squawks] 206 pounds,
seven and fourpence, halfpenny.

1152
01:19:46,545 --> 01:19:48,570
Ah, it's more than enough.

1153
01:19:48,647 --> 01:19:51,741
I see no reason why we shouldn't set out
to find the pink sea snail right away.

1154
01:19:51,817 --> 01:19:54,047
Matthew, go to the house
and pick up my clothes.

1155
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:56,053
Have the boat
ready to sail by 12:00.

1156
01:19:56,121 --> 01:19:59,249
We'll catch the noontide
or whatever it's called.

1157
01:19:59,324 --> 01:20:03,124
We haven't got a crew,
so we'll have to make due with you
and Stubbins and the animals.

1158
01:20:03,195 --> 01:20:05,129
I can come too?

1159
01:20:05,197 --> 01:20:07,324
If your parents say so
and you know how to tie a knot.

1160
01:20:07,399 --> 01:20:10,163
Hear that? We're going to help
the doctor find the pink sea snail.

1161
01:20:10,235 --> 01:20:14,569
I should wait until you see
his boat before you get too excited.

1162
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:17,438
It isn't by chance
it's called the Flounder.

1163
01:20:17,509 --> 01:20:20,273
No sailor in his right mind
would touch it.

1164
01:20:20,345 --> 01:20:23,280
I'm not asking a sailor
in his right mind. I was asking you.

1165
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:26,915
What do you say?

1166
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,589
I say that for a man who's
about to be hanged for murder...

1167
01:20:31,657 --> 01:20:36,594
to be gettin' ready to go on a pleasure
cruise shows a very nice outlook.

1168
01:20:36,662 --> 01:20:38,994
[Door Opens]

1169
01:20:41,433 --> 01:20:46,132
- Fred!
- To what do we owe this, uh, pleasure?

1170
01:20:46,205 --> 01:20:48,264
- I've brought dinner.
- Dinner?

1171
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:52,299
- Yes, for Matthew and Tommy.
- Oh.

1172
01:20:52,377 --> 01:20:54,436
Set it down there, Hubert.

1173
01:20:54,513 --> 01:20:59,143
Steak and kidney pie
and oxtail and roast beef.

1174
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:04,683
- Would you like some?
- Uh, no.

1175
01:21:04,756 --> 01:21:08,817
Oh, come on, Doctor.
Ya haven't had a bite all day.

1176
01:21:08,894 --> 01:21:13,024
- No, thank you.
- He's a vegetarian.

1177
01:21:13,098 --> 01:21:15,328
Oh, no!

1178
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,597
It, uh, seems
a pity to waste it.

1179
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:21,833
It's all right, Matthew.
Um, carry on.

1180
01:21:21,907 --> 01:21:25,240
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Come on, Tom.

1181
01:21:26,445 --> 01:21:28,413
Doctor?

1182
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:35,647
Um, Rufus was right.

1183
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:42,990
He did have six helpings
of blackberry pie.

1184
01:21:44,296 --> 01:21:47,857
- Thank you.
- [Chittering]

1185
01:21:47,933 --> 01:21:50,834
Oh, thank you, Chee-Chee.

- [Both Laughing]
- [Chee-Chee Chittering]

1187
01:21:56,742 --> 01:21:59,905
It seems that a bonnet and shawl
were, in fact, removed...

1188
01:21:59,978 --> 01:22:02,538
from the tavern in question
on the day in question.

1189
01:22:02,614 --> 01:22:06,983
The lady who owns them,
for reasons best known to herself,
has no wish to prosecute.

1190
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:10,886
You are, therefore, acquitted
of the charge of murder.

[Tolling Continues]

1193
01:22:17,329 --> 01:22:20,856
Thank you very much.

1194
01:22:20,933 --> 01:22:23,094
However,

1195
01:22:24,937 --> 01:22:27,929
your performance in this courtroom
in the past two days...

1196
01:22:28,006 --> 01:22:31,169
has left little doubt in the minds of my
distinguished colleagues and myself...

1197
01:22:31,243 --> 01:22:35,839
that your lunatic activities
with animals infringe
upon the public safety...

1198
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:38,747
and are not to be tolerated.

1199
01:22:38,817 --> 01:22:43,948
Happily, Her Majesty's farseeing
benevolence provides a sanctuary
for sad people like you...

1200
01:22:44,022 --> 01:22:48,618
who think they can talk to animals and
want to treat them like human beings.

1201
01:22:48,694 --> 01:22:51,094
Therefore, it is
the judgment of this court...

1202
01:22:51,163 --> 01:22:55,259
that you be committed indefinitely
to an asylum for the insane.

1203
01:23:02,274 --> 01:23:04,572
Have you anything to say?

1204
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:11,848
[Music] I do not understand
the human race [music]

1205
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:14,750
[Music] It has so little love
for creatures [music]

1206
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:17,050
[Music] With a different face [music]

1207
01:23:17,122 --> 01:23:21,923
[Music] Treating animals like people
is no madness or disgrace [music]

1208
01:23:21,994 --> 01:23:25,930
[Music] I do not understand
the human race [music]

1209
01:23:25,998 --> 01:23:31,265
[Music] I wonder why do we treat
animals like animals [music]

1210
01:23:31,336 --> 01:23:34,499
[Music] Animals treat us so very well [music]

1211
01:23:34,573 --> 01:23:37,872
[Music] The devoted way they serve us
and protect us when we're nervous [music]

1212
01:23:37,943 --> 01:23:40,377
[Music] Oh, they really don't deserve us [music]

1213
01:23:40,445 --> 01:23:43,573
[Music] All we give them is hell [music]

1214
01:23:43,649 --> 01:23:46,140
[Music] Tell me how else
man repays them [music]

1215
01:23:46,218 --> 01:23:48,618
[Music] Do we ever think to
praise them, no, we don't [music]

1216
01:23:48,687 --> 01:23:51,520
[Music] And this dismays them
You can tell [music]

1217
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:55,526
[Music] We are riddled with ingratitude
We give no love or latitude [music]

1218
01:23:55,594 --> 01:23:59,963
[Music] In every way our attitude is
well, like animals [music]

1219
01:24:00,032 --> 01:24:05,163
No, no. That's not
what I mean. I mean...

1220
01:24:05,237 --> 01:24:08,729
[music] Why do we treat animals
like animals [music]

1221
01:24:08,807 --> 01:24:12,004
[Music] How can people
be so inhumane [music]

1222
01:24:12,077 --> 01:24:14,045
[Music] Cows and chickens
work to feed us [music]

1223
01:24:14,112 --> 01:24:16,410
[Music] Dogs and horses
show they need us [music]

1224
01:24:16,481 --> 01:24:21,350
[Music] And though cats don't always heed us
their affection is plain [music]

1225
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:24,821
[Music] What do we do, we neglect them
We do nothing to protect them [music]

1226
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:28,656
[Music] We reject them
Don't expect them to complain [music]

1227
01:24:28,727 --> 01:24:32,163
[Music] We ignore them or we beat them
When we're hungry then we eat them [music]

1228
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:35,199
[Music] It's appalling how
we treat them, it's insane [music]

1229
01:24:35,267 --> 01:24:37,758
[Music] Like animals [music]

1230
01:24:40,339 --> 01:24:44,935
[Music] We humiliate and murder
and confine them [music]

1231
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:48,036
[Music] We create their wretched status [music]

1232
01:24:48,113 --> 01:24:52,106
[Music] Then we use it to malign them [music]

1233
01:24:52,184 --> 01:24:56,644
[Music] I mean, why should we say
Treat him like a dog [music]

1234
01:24:56,722 --> 01:25:00,249
[Music] Why should we say
Working like a horse [music]

1235
01:25:00,325 --> 01:25:02,691
[Music] Why should we say
Eating like a hog [music]

1236
01:25:02,761 --> 01:25:05,559
[Music] When what we mean is
Eating like a man [music]

1237
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:09,293
[Music]Don't we, of course [music]

1238
01:25:09,368 --> 01:25:13,896
[Music] A man of ill repute
is called a weasel or a rat [music]

1239
01:25:13,972 --> 01:25:17,840
[Music] A woman you dislike
becomes a vixen or a cat [music]

1240
01:25:17,909 --> 01:25:21,640
[Music] A family that is blessed with
healthy reproductive habits [music]

1241
01:25:21,713 --> 01:25:26,616
[Music] Occasions the remark, well, you know
them, they breed like rabbits [music]

1242
01:25:26,685 --> 01:25:29,347
[Music] He's as stubborn as a mule
He's as stupid as an ox [music]

1243
01:25:29,421 --> 01:25:32,447
[Music] He's as slimy as a snake
He's as crafty as a fox [music]

1244
01:25:33,892 --> 01:25:37,384
[Music] Remarks like that
really get my goat [music]

1245
01:25:37,462 --> 01:25:42,161
[Music] Why don't we say
Noble as a frog [music]

1246
01:25:42,234 --> 01:25:45,863
[Music] Or why can't we say
Wealthy as a hen [music]

1247
01:25:47,706 --> 01:25:49,936
[Music] True, we say
Devoted as a dog [music]

1248
01:25:50,008 --> 01:25:53,341
[Music] What we should say is
Chic as a giraffe [music]

1249
01:25:53,412 --> 01:25:57,109
[Music] Pretty as a pig, eh
That will be the big day, won't it [music]

1250
01:25:57,182 --> 01:26:00,811
[Music] But when, but when [music]

1251
01:26:00,886 --> 01:26:05,914
[Music] But when, when will we stop
treating them like animals [music]

1252
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:08,482
[Music] Is the human race
entirely mad [music]

1253
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,826
[Music] Women see a baby goatskin
or a lambskin or a stoatskin [music]

1254
01:26:12,898 --> 01:26:16,561
[Music]And to them it's just a coatskin
Oh, it's terribly sad [music]

1255
01:26:18,336 --> 01:26:21,965
[Music] When you dress in suede or leather
or some fancy fur or feather [music]

1256
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,770
[Music] Do you stop and wonder
whether for a fad [music]

1257
01:26:24,843 --> 01:26:28,574
[Music] You have killed
some beast or other [music]

1258
01:26:28,647 --> 01:26:32,378
[Music] That you're wearing
someone's brother [music]

1259
01:26:32,451 --> 01:26:37,013
[Music] Or perhaps it's someone's mother
in which you're clad [music]

1260
01:26:37,088 --> 01:26:39,386
[Music] Like animals [music]

1261
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:41,858
[Music] Like animals [music]

1262
01:26:41,927 --> 01:26:44,088
[Music] Like animals [music]

1263
01:26:49,067 --> 01:26:51,729
[Music] Well, it's true [music]

1264
01:26:51,803 --> 01:26:55,705
[Music] We do not live in a zoo [music]

1265
01:26:55,774 --> 01:26:59,710
[Music] But man is an animal too [music]

1266
01:27:00,879 --> 01:27:03,575
[Music] So why can't you [music]

1267
01:27:03,648 --> 01:27:05,946
[Music] Like me [music]

1268
01:27:06,017 --> 01:27:09,214
[Music] Like animals [music]

1269
01:27:10,655 --> 01:27:12,850
[Music] Animals [music]

1270
01:28:08,513 --> 01:28:13,473
[music][Orchestral]

1271
01:30:19,043 --> 01:30:22,274
Now, the prison faces the road here.

1272
01:30:22,347 --> 01:30:26,875
So what we do is we tie the ropes from
the bars of the cell to the elephant,

1273
01:30:26,951 --> 01:30:29,146
and he pulls the whole wall off.

1274
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:31,484
How can you go on the voyage
if the doctor's still in prison?

1275
01:30:31,556 --> 01:30:35,253
We can't. That's why Matthew's got
this marvelous plan to get him out.

1276
01:30:35,326 --> 01:30:37,920
Then this second elephant...
he's bigger than the first elephant...

1277
01:30:37,996 --> 01:30:41,955
All the doctor has to do is step through
the hole in the wall onto his back.

1278
01:30:42,033 --> 01:30:45,469
- You'll never get away with this.
- Listen, here's the clever part.

1279
01:30:45,537 --> 01:30:49,769
He slides down the elephant's trunk onto
a waitin' rhinoceros and away they go!

1280
01:30:49,841 --> 01:30:52,275
Just the three of you
are going off on this boat?

1281
01:30:52,343 --> 01:30:55,107
Oh, no. Chee-Chee, Polynesia
and Jip are coming too.

1282
01:30:55,179 --> 01:30:58,148
Then there's these six tigers,
you see, to stop anyone followin'.

1283
01:30:58,216 --> 01:31:00,150
To look for a pink sea snail?

1284
01:31:00,218 --> 01:31:03,016
They'll be standing on
the other side of the road
while I'm settin' off the dynamite.

1285
01:31:03,087 --> 01:31:05,817
- Dynamite? [Squawks]
- Oh, sure.

1286
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:10,725
If we blow up the road,
they'll have to go all the way
around the town to get to the harbor,

1287
01:31:10,795 --> 01:31:13,662
which gives me time
to nip back here...

1288
01:31:13,731 --> 01:31:17,258
and blow up the bridge while
you're gettin' on the boat.

1289
01:31:17,335 --> 01:31:21,203
That's the beauty of this whole plan...
its simplicity.

1290
01:31:21,272 --> 01:31:24,673
- Are they really going to
keep the doctor in prison?
- Oh, no, no.

1291
01:31:24,742 --> 01:31:27,609
They're moving him across
to the loony bin at 12:00.

1292
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:29,613
- [Squawks] Today?
- Aye.

1293
01:31:29,681 --> 01:31:32,445
I've also an idea.
You get the boat ready.

1294
01:31:32,517 --> 01:31:35,816
Leave the doctor to me.
We sail at 12:00. Avast now.

1295
01:31:35,887 --> 01:31:39,323
- [Squawks]
- Aye, aye, sir.

1296
01:31:39,390 --> 01:31:43,986
We're a fine bunch,
takin' orders from a parrot.

1297
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:58,206
Matthew, how did you enjoy
the food I brought you
in the prison the other night?

1298
01:31:58,276 --> 01:32:01,074
'Twas the best meal
I ever had in me life.

1299
01:32:01,145 --> 01:32:04,478
They say that prison food is terrible.
I won't hear a word against it.

1300
01:32:04,549 --> 01:32:06,483
I was thinking.

1301
01:32:06,551 --> 01:32:10,920
Wouldn't it be nice if you were to have
those kind of meals on your voyage?

1302
01:32:10,989 --> 01:32:12,923
Oh, true now.
It would be marvelous.

1303
01:32:12,991 --> 01:32:17,724
The only way we could do that
is if you was to...

1304
01:32:17,795 --> 01:32:20,764
If we was to, uh...

1305
01:32:24,002 --> 01:32:26,971
Ah!
[Laughs]

1306
01:32:30,241 --> 01:32:32,835
I'll tell you one thing, Fred.

1307
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:35,708
I only hope there's
no stowaways on that boat.

1308
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:40,513
Because if there was,
I wouldn't know where to look for them.

1309
01:32:40,585 --> 01:32:45,852
Anyway, once we're out at sea
with an escaped convict,
there's no turnin' back.

1310
01:32:45,923 --> 01:32:48,391
Oh, Matthew!

1311
01:32:48,459 --> 01:32:50,927
I love you!

1312
01:32:59,971 --> 01:33:02,565
[Music] Who would have thought
that one little kiss [music]

1313
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:07,577
[Music] Soft and sweet from
the lips of a lovely girl [music]

1314
01:33:07,645 --> 01:33:12,412
[Music] Would to change my life [music]

1315
01:33:12,483 --> 01:33:16,715
[Music] But by my life [music]

1316
01:33:16,788 --> 01:33:21,418
[Music] It will [music]

1317
01:33:22,994 --> 01:33:28,455
[Music] After today nothing
will be the same again [music]

1318
01:33:28,533 --> 01:33:34,165
[Music] After today I'll make
my claim to fame and then [music]

1319
01:33:34,238 --> 01:33:37,537
[Music] The grass will be greener [music]

1320
01:33:37,608 --> 01:33:40,441
[Music] And the air will be cleaner [music]

1321
01:33:40,511 --> 01:33:43,776
[Music] And my life be serener [music]

1322
01:33:43,848 --> 01:33:47,045
[Music] Than heaven knows when [music]

1323
01:33:47,118 --> 01:33:50,087
[Music] Heaven knows when [music]

1324
01:33:50,154 --> 01:33:55,592
[Music] After today I shall have
bid my fears good-bye [music]

1325
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:59,960
[Music] After today I shall
have no more tears [music]

1326
01:34:00,031 --> 01:34:02,192
[Music] To cry [music]

1327
01:34:02,266 --> 01:34:07,966
[Music] I'll learn to live
with laughter to stay [music]

1328
01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:10,906
[Music] After [music]

1329
01:34:10,975 --> 01:34:13,443
[Music] Today [music]

1330
01:34:15,646 --> 01:34:20,948
[Music] After today nothing
will be the way it was [music]

1331
01:34:21,018 --> 01:34:26,320
[Music] After today I'll say
Oh, what a day it was [music]

1332
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:29,154
[Music] My heart will be lighter [music]

1333
01:34:29,227 --> 01:34:31,957
[Music] And my smile
will be brighter [music]

1334
01:34:32,029 --> 01:34:35,021
[Music] And I'll be
twice the fighter [music]

1335
01:34:35,099 --> 01:34:38,262
[Music] That ever I was [music]

1336
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:41,134
[Music] Clever because [music]

1337
01:34:41,205 --> 01:34:46,643
[Music] After today I shall have
bid my fears farewell [music]

1338
01:34:46,711 --> 01:34:50,670
[Music] After today I shall
have no more tears [music]

1339
01:34:50,748 --> 01:34:52,807
[Music] To quell [music]

1340
01:34:52,884 --> 01:34:56,684
[Music] I'll learn to live
with laughter [music]

1341
01:34:56,754 --> 01:34:58,745
[Music] To stay [music]

1342
01:34:58,823 --> 01:35:03,157
[Music] After the tears
comes the laughter [music]

1343
01:35:03,227 --> 01:35:11,396
[Music] After today [music]

1344
01:35:13,471 --> 01:35:15,905
- [Horse Whinnies]
- [Bell Tolling]

1345
01:35:15,973 --> 01:35:19,306
[Tolling Continues]

1346
01:35:49,607 --> 01:35:51,575
[Squawks]

1347
01:35:53,311 --> 01:35:55,142
[Squawking]

1348
01:35:57,782 --> 01:35:59,773
[Horse Nickers]

1349
01:36:07,124 --> 01:36:09,058
[Horse Whinnies]

1350
01:36:12,330 --> 01:36:15,128
[Polynesia Squawks]
Chee-Chee.

1351
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,224
[Squawking]

1352
01:36:17,301 --> 01:36:20,566
- [Whinnies]
- [Whinnying]

1353
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:27,474
[Whinnies]
Run! Run! [Whinnies]

1354
01:36:27,545 --> 01:36:29,069
Stop!

1355
01:36:29,146 --> 01:36:33,014
Don't follow the doctor!
[Whinnies]

1356
01:36:33,084 --> 01:36:37,282
[Polynesia]
Don't obey! Don't obey!

1357
01:36:37,355 --> 01:36:41,189
- Right!
- [Whinnying]

1358
01:36:41,259 --> 01:36:44,353
[Whinnies]

1359
01:36:47,064 --> 01:36:51,501
Come on! This way!
Don't sit down!

1360
01:36:51,569 --> 01:36:54,265
- Get up!
- After them!

1361
01:36:54,338 --> 01:36:56,431
- [Barks]
- Go after him!

1362
01:36:56,507 --> 01:37:00,443
- [Barking]
- This way. Come on. After him. This way.

1363
01:37:00,511 --> 01:37:04,470
- This way! No, this way!
- Ta-ta.

1364
01:37:04,548 --> 01:37:07,779
- Stop them!
- Stop them! Stop them!

1365
01:37:37,448 --> 01:37:40,315
It's all right, Doctor.
You can come out now.

1366
01:37:40,384 --> 01:37:43,683
- There's not a policeman in sight.
- Oh, thank you, Matthew.

1367
01:37:43,754 --> 01:37:47,588
Makes a very good little reading room,
this. I must use it more often.

1368
01:37:49,493 --> 01:37:52,428
Now, let's see where we are.

1369
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:58,691
[Barking]

1370
01:37:58,769 --> 01:38:01,567
- [Barking]
- Ah, I see.

1371
01:38:01,639 --> 01:38:05,234
He says there's a faint smell of garlic
coming from the southeast.

1372
01:38:05,309 --> 01:38:09,905
- What does that mean?
- It means we're about ten miles
off the coast of France.

1373
01:38:09,981 --> 01:38:13,917
I've got about the best navigational
system on the high seas today.

1374
01:38:13,985 --> 01:38:16,476
Jip's got this
incredible sense of smell,

1375
01:38:16,554 --> 01:38:19,717
and Polynesia gets
marvelous weather reports
from the passing birds and fishes.

1376
01:38:19,790 --> 01:38:23,317
- Everything all right at the house?
- Yes, Doctor.

1377
01:38:23,394 --> 01:38:27,330
Good. Keep an eye on everything and
don't bump into anything like Ireland.

1378
01:38:27,398 --> 01:38:29,332
Aye, aye, Doctor.

1379
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,527
- A very well organized escape.
Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1380
01:38:31,602 --> 01:38:33,866
I doubt if there's a ship afloat
with flowers like these.

1381
01:38:33,938 --> 01:38:36,338
Look at these geraniums.
Absolutely glorious.

1382
01:38:36,407 --> 01:38:39,137
Have you seen my azaleas
on the starboard side?

1383
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:42,577
- No, sir, I can't say as I have.
- They're doing wonderfully.

1384
01:38:42,646 --> 01:38:45,740
How are you enjoying life
on the rolling deep?

1385
01:38:45,816 --> 01:38:49,411
If the good Lord meant us to take
to water, He'd have given us flippers.

1386
01:38:49,487 --> 01:38:51,421
- [Chuckles]
- [Hooting]

1387
01:38:51,489 --> 01:38:54,049
No, Stubbins,
move your mouth about more.

1388
01:38:54,125 --> 01:38:57,583
You must reread my essay
on basic chimpanzee, page one.

1389
01:38:57,661 --> 01:39:01,529
I must cut these roses back.
There's so much to do on a ship.

1390
01:39:01,599 --> 01:39:05,035
- [Boiling]
- What a marvelous smell, Matthew.

1391
01:39:05,102 --> 01:39:07,900
What have you been cooking?
I'm absolutely starving.

1392
01:39:07,972 --> 01:39:10,770
[Emma]
Will this do?

1393
01:39:17,381 --> 01:39:20,282
Do come on while it's still hot.

1394
01:39:27,091 --> 01:39:29,286
What are you doing here?

1395
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:33,524
I thought someone capable ought
to look after Tommy on the voyage.

1396
01:39:33,597 --> 01:39:36,498
Stubbins is perfectly capable
of looking after himself.

1397
01:39:36,567 --> 01:39:39,661
I must turn the ship around
and go straight back to Puddleby...

1398
01:39:39,737 --> 01:39:42,831
uh, well, immediately after lunch.

1399
01:39:45,242 --> 01:39:50,077
They'll, uh... They'll put ya
inside if you go back, Doctor.

1400
01:39:50,147 --> 01:39:52,638
Oh, yes, that is a point.

1401
01:39:52,716 --> 01:39:55,378
What are we going to do
with her if she stays?

1402
01:39:55,453 --> 01:39:57,580
You make me
sound like a stray cat.

1403
01:39:57,655 --> 01:39:59,520
A cat would be most welcome.

1404
01:40:01,792 --> 01:40:04,454
Don't worry. It's vegetarian.

1405
01:40:04,528 --> 01:40:07,725
- It's delicious.
- It's marvelous.

1406
01:40:07,798 --> 01:40:09,732
[Chuckles]

1407
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,927
Mmm. What is it?

1408
01:40:12,002 --> 01:40:15,403
- Algue marine en croute.
- Oh, yes.

1409
01:40:15,473 --> 01:40:18,237
- What's that in English?
- Seaweed pie.

1410
01:40:19,777 --> 01:40:21,938
Mmm! It's really rather good.

1411
01:40:26,150 --> 01:40:30,177
- Well, where are we going?
- To hunt for the great pink sea snail.

1412
01:40:30,254 --> 01:40:32,245
And where do you
expect to find it?

1413
01:40:32,323 --> 01:40:34,689
I haven't the faintest idea.

1414
01:40:34,758 --> 01:40:38,023
But as one place is as good as another,
it's high time we decided.

1415
01:40:38,095 --> 01:40:41,622
- Otherwise, when we get there,
we won't know we've arrived.
- Good thinking.

1416
01:40:41,699 --> 01:40:45,931
- Thank you.
- Are your voyages always
as well planned as this?

1417
01:40:46,003 --> 01:40:50,463
When possible. Unfortunately,
one doesn't always have time
to go into minute details.

1418
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:53,442
- Such as knowing where you're going?
- That sort of thing.

1419
01:40:53,511 --> 01:40:56,378
But then how do you decide?

1420
01:40:56,447 --> 01:40:59,746
We play a little game I invented.

1421
01:40:59,817 --> 01:41:03,617
One of us opens the atlas at random,
sticks a pin in the open page.

1422
01:41:03,687 --> 01:41:05,712
Wherever it lands,
that's where we go.

1423
01:41:05,789 --> 01:41:08,314
- You can't be serious.
- I'm very serious.

1424
01:41:08,392 --> 01:41:12,328
That is the most ridiculous thing
I have ever heard of.

1425
01:41:12,396 --> 01:41:15,331
You could end up in
all sorts of terrible places.

1426
01:41:15,399 --> 01:41:17,333
That's absolutely true.

1427
01:41:17,401 --> 01:41:20,529
I remember going to the Sahara Desert
four times in succession...

1428
01:41:20,604 --> 01:41:24,540
before I realized Chee-Chee
had stuck down all the other pages
of the atlas with jam.

1429
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:26,769
Marvelous trips. Lots of sand.

1430
01:41:26,844 --> 01:41:29,642
But that is exactly what I mean.

1431
01:41:29,713 --> 01:41:33,850
It's all right now. I cleaned
all the jam off. Little bit there.

1432
01:41:35,818 --> 01:41:41,381
How you can sit there and say what
you're saying I just don't know.

1433
01:41:41,457 --> 01:41:47,089
I must admit the Sahara is one place
I'm praying we just won't go.

1434
01:41:48,364 --> 01:41:52,300
You know, that's absolutely
typical of a woman.

1435
01:41:52,368 --> 01:41:58,034
[Music] There are so many fabulous
faraway places to see [music]

1436
01:41:58,107 --> 01:42:00,507
She makes one seaweed pie
and goes mad.

1437
01:42:00,576 --> 01:42:05,172
[Music] Such as Mexico, Sweden
Hawaii, Japan and Capri [music]

1438
01:42:05,248 --> 01:42:06,977
Who does she think she is?

1439
01:42:07,049 --> 01:42:10,917
[Music] There's so many exciting
and wonderful places [music]

1440
01:42:10,987 --> 01:42:14,184
[Music] Much more inviting
than desert oases [music]

1441
01:42:14,257 --> 01:42:17,226
[Music] Pleasant as home is
it isn't what Rome is [music]

1442
01:42:17,293 --> 01:42:20,126
[Music] So why stay there [music]

1443
01:42:20,196 --> 01:42:24,826
[Music] When there are so many fabulous
faraway places to see [music]

1444
01:42:24,901 --> 01:42:27,369
As though the seaweed pie
was all that marvelous.

1445
01:42:27,436 --> 01:42:29,836
[Music] Why should Spain
and Tahiti and Rio [music]

1446
01:42:29,906 --> 01:42:33,899
- [Music]Just be only names to you and me [music]
- Is there any more?

1447
01:42:33,976 --> 01:42:37,810
[Music] I feel certain there are people
we'd be glad to know there [music]

1448
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:41,213
[Music] So tell me why don't
we get up and go there [music]

1449
01:42:41,284 --> 01:42:47,689
[Music] Go to those fabulous places
where we long to be [music]

1450
01:42:47,757 --> 01:42:51,420
[Music] Go to Bangkok and Hong Kong
and Paris and Venice [music]

1451
01:42:51,494 --> 01:42:54,759
[Music] Tokyo and Cairo
and Lisbon and London [music]

1452
01:42:54,830 --> 01:42:58,823
[Music] Wonderful, fabulous places [music]

1453
01:42:58,901 --> 01:43:03,361
[Music] We're longing to see [music]

1454
01:43:08,444 --> 01:43:11,277
[Music] When I think of
the warm Caribbean [music]

1455
01:43:11,347 --> 01:43:15,181
[Music] I see a new world
for you and me [music]

1456
01:43:15,251 --> 01:43:18,846
[Music] I'd give anything just to
have one single day there [music]

1457
01:43:18,921 --> 01:43:21,981
[Music] Once we get there
I know that we'll stay there [music]

1458
01:43:22,058 --> 01:43:27,462
[Music] Stay in those fabulous places
where we long to be [music]

1459
01:43:27,530 --> 01:43:29,623
- [Music] Such as Siam [music]

1463
01:43:36,939 --> 01:43:38,873
- Ole! Ole! Ole!
- El toro!

1464
01:43:38,941 --> 01:43:41,432
- Ha, ha!
- Ole! Ole! Ole!

1465
01:43:44,513 --> 01:43:47,846
[Music] Show me those fabulous places [music]

1466
01:43:47,917 --> 01:43:51,114
[Music] I'm longing to see [music]

1467
01:43:51,187 --> 01:43:55,214
My dear Miss Fairfax, you seem
to have entirely missed the point.

1468
01:43:55,291 --> 01:43:58,886
[Music] I'm aware there are fabulous places
wherever we sail [music]

1469
01:43:58,961 --> 01:44:00,929
- Will we see them?
- We will.

1470
01:44:00,997 --> 01:44:05,127
[Music] But the point of the journey
is science and finding the snail [music]

1471
01:44:05,201 --> 01:44:07,829
[Music] An incomparable thrill [music]

1472
01:44:07,903 --> 01:44:10,667
[Music] We shall question the sharks
off the coast of Tobago [music]

1473
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:13,231
[Music] Interview swamp life
in Tierra del Fuego [music]

1474
01:44:13,309 --> 01:44:18,941
- [Music] That sounds horrendous [music]
- [Music] No, no, it's tremendous
and well worthwhile [music]

1475
01:44:19,015 --> 01:44:22,917
[Music] We'll make detailed inquiries
of every crustacean we meet [music]

1476
01:44:22,985 --> 01:44:25,476
- Crustacean?
- [Music] Shellfish, they're sweet [music]

1477
01:44:25,554 --> 01:44:27,988
[Music] We will sail
to the ends of the earth [music]

1478
01:44:28,057 --> 01:44:31,458
[Music] Till our search for the snail
is quite complete [music]

1479
01:44:31,527 --> 01:44:34,826
[Music] We'll interrogate beetles
and bugs in Nigeria [music]

1480
01:44:34,897 --> 01:44:37,661
[Music] And if we have to
spend weeks in Siberia [music]

1481
01:44:37,733 --> 01:44:40,930
[Music] Eighty below but a place
that we all ought to see [music]

1482
01:44:41,003 --> 01:44:43,836
[Music] But I haven't brought
the right clothes for Siberia [music]

1483
01:44:43,906 --> 01:44:46,807
[Music] Those are the fabulous places
you'll visit with me [music]

1484
01:44:46,876 --> 01:44:48,844
Sounds as if we're in
for a good time.

1485
01:44:48,911 --> 01:44:52,278
[Music] Well, Siberia is one place
you'll never see me go [music]

1486
01:44:52,348 --> 01:44:55,010
[Music] Stick in the pin
Where the pins goes, then we go [music]

1487
01:44:55,084 --> 01:44:57,848
- Ireland!
- Romania!
- No, Ruritania!

1488
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:00,718
[Music] We'll chase that sea snail
from here to Tasmania [music]

1489
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:04,055
[Music] Show me those fabulous places [music]

1490
01:45:04,126 --> 01:45:06,896
[Music]I'm longing to [music]

1491
01:45:06,896 --> 01:45:07,954
[Music]I'm longing to [music]

1492
01:45:08,030 --> 01:45:12,592
[Music] See [music]

1493
01:45:16,071 --> 01:45:19,006
It doesn't count.
You landed in the sea.

1494
01:45:19,074 --> 01:45:21,838
No, she hasn't. Look. There.

1495
01:45:25,647 --> 01:45:28,616
Well, that doesn't
look very interesting.

1496
01:45:28,684 --> 01:45:32,848
- What is it?
- "Sea Star Island.

1497
01:45:32,921 --> 01:45:35,446
Last reported position."

1498
01:45:35,524 --> 01:45:39,961
Last reported position?
What can that mean?

1499
01:45:40,028 --> 01:45:45,489
The Sea Star Island. That's faintly
familiar. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1500
01:45:45,567 --> 01:45:48,798
"Seashore, sea slug, sea snail.

1501
01:45:48,871 --> 01:45:51,669
Sea Star Island."
[Mutters]

1502
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:55,267
It's that floating island.
It moves all over the world like a ship.

1503
01:45:55,344 --> 01:45:57,278
It's a freak of nature.

1504
01:45:57,346 --> 01:46:02,283
This time of year it's sometimes
sighted off the coast of Africa.

1505
01:46:02,351 --> 01:46:07,118
How terribly exciting.
I think you have chosen rather well.

1506
01:46:07,189 --> 01:46:09,680
I don't think
it's exciting at all.

1507
01:46:09,758 --> 01:46:13,353
Couldn't we go to...
Couldn't we go to Monte Carlo?

1508
01:46:13,428 --> 01:46:18,365
Miss Fairfax, this is a serious
zoogeographical expedition.

1509
01:46:18,433 --> 01:46:21,300
It's not a pleasure cruise
for your personal benefit.

1510
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:24,931
I promise to ask for
no special privileges.

1511
01:46:25,007 --> 01:46:27,475
I promise to grant none.
A ship is no place for a woman.

1512
01:46:27,543 --> 01:46:30,876
The simple answer then
is to treat me like a man.

1513
01:46:30,946 --> 01:46:32,937
I intend to.

1514
01:46:43,492 --> 01:46:45,892
Well, good-bye.

1515
01:48:45,247 --> 01:48:48,444
[Mutters]
Twelve.

1516
01:48:48,517 --> 01:48:52,283
Uh-huh. How is the score, Stubbins?
And the arithmetic?

1517
01:48:52,354 --> 01:48:54,288
You're winning, sir, I think.

1518
01:48:56,925 --> 01:49:00,520
Ah, well, that's the first sure sign
we've been at sea too long.

1519
01:49:00,595 --> 01:49:03,120
Polynesia spoke to some swallows.

1520
01:49:03,198 --> 01:49:06,599
They said there's a terrific storm
up ahead. Isn't that marvelous?

1521
01:49:06,668 --> 01:49:10,126
No, it isn't.
Can't we drive round it?

1522
01:49:10,205 --> 01:49:13,902
I shouldn't think so.
The latest long-range fish forecast
wasn't too encouraging.

1523
01:49:13,975 --> 01:49:16,205
Jip said he could smell thunder.

1524
01:49:16,278 --> 01:49:19,179
- I didn't know thunder had a smell.
- It does if you're a dog.

1525
01:49:19,247 --> 01:49:23,343
Uh, 82. Mind you,
Jip does tend to exaggerate.

1526
01:49:23,418 --> 01:49:28,117
If you ask me, bein' at sea is
very much the same as bein' in prison,

1527
01:49:28,190 --> 01:49:31,751
except at sea ya stand
a better chance of drownin'.

1528
01:49:31,827 --> 01:49:35,285
That reminds me. One of the ship's rats
came to see me this afternoon.

1529
01:49:35,363 --> 01:49:38,890
Said he had
a distinct tingle in his tail,
a sure sign the ship was going down.

1530
01:49:38,967 --> 01:49:42,926
So his lot are preparing to leave,
according to rat tradition.

1531
01:49:43,004 --> 01:49:44,995
He highly recommended
we should do the same.

1532
01:49:45,073 --> 01:49:46,597
There's nowhere we can go.

1533
01:49:46,675 --> 01:49:50,634
- Exactly. That's what I told the rat.
- Two.

1534
01:49:50,712 --> 01:49:54,910
- [Wind Howling]
- [Thunderclap]

1535
01:49:54,983 --> 01:49:59,249
- What was that?
- A bit of lightning. That's all.

1536
01:49:59,321 --> 01:50:02,256
When you finish clearing up, you better
batten down the hatches and stay below.

1537
01:50:02,324 --> 01:50:05,191
Women are always
scared stiff of storms.

1538
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:09,321
Well, I'm not.
I'm a man, remember?

1539
01:50:09,397 --> 01:50:13,356
[Thunderclap]

1540
01:50:19,441 --> 01:50:22,672
I dread to think what this
is going to do to my azaleas.

1541
01:50:41,463 --> 01:50:43,556
August 10.

1542
01:50:43,632 --> 01:50:47,659
Signs of inclement weather.

1543
01:50:50,205 --> 01:50:54,301
Crew's morale remains high.

1544
01:50:54,376 --> 01:50:56,708
[Thunderclap]

1545
01:50:59,014 --> 01:51:02,415
[Chittering]

1546
01:51:11,293 --> 01:51:14,126
[Squawks]
Steady as she goes.

1547
01:51:14,196 --> 01:51:17,256
[Squawking]

1548
01:51:17,332 --> 01:51:21,393
[Whimpering]

1549
01:51:48,196 --> 01:51:51,427
[Animal Vocalizing]

1550
01:51:51,499 --> 01:51:55,993
[Clicking]

1551
01:52:12,654 --> 01:52:14,588
[Clicks]

1552
01:52:17,659 --> 01:52:21,288
Thank you.
Thank you very much, indeed.

1553
01:52:23,765 --> 01:52:27,633
- Any sign of her, Polynesia?
- Not yet.

1554
01:52:36,077 --> 01:52:39,444
Ah, good morning, Stubbins.
Beautiful day.

1555
01:52:39,514 --> 01:52:43,109
Yes, sir, good morning.
What happened to the ship?

1556
01:52:43,184 --> 01:52:48,121
Very good question.
If we ever find enough bits,
we'll put them together and find out.

1557
01:52:48,189 --> 01:52:50,487
[Chee-Chee Chittering]

1558
01:52:50,558 --> 01:52:55,222
Come on, Matthew.
Rise and shine.

1559
01:52:55,297 --> 01:53:00,030
[Groans] I told ya Flounder
was a terrible name for a boat.

1560
01:53:00,101 --> 01:53:03,070
Nonsense. The flounder's
a most reliable little fish.

1561
01:53:03,138 --> 01:53:05,299
It's survived the sea
for thousands of years.

1562
01:53:05,373 --> 01:53:07,807
Aye, below the surface.

1563
01:53:07,876 --> 01:53:10,367
Anyway, we're all safe.
That's the main thing.

1564
01:53:10,445 --> 01:53:14,609
- At least, we will be as soon
as we find Miss Fairfax.
- Poor Fred.

1565
01:53:14,683 --> 01:53:18,119
I said all along a ship
was no place for a woman.

1566
01:53:18,186 --> 01:53:21,451
Heaven knows I did my best to make
the voyage pleasant for her.

1567
01:53:21,523 --> 01:53:23,855
You can't spend your life
running after a woman,

1568
01:53:23,925 --> 01:53:27,258
waiting on her hand and foot
when there's important work to be done.

1569
01:53:27,329 --> 01:53:30,196
I think under the circumstances
I treated her very well.

1570
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:34,898
Probably too well.

1571
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:37,200
Spoiled her, in fact.

1572
01:53:37,272 --> 01:53:39,672
And I tied her
very securely to that raft.

1573
01:53:41,443 --> 01:53:45,038
I hope she's all right.
That's all.

1574
01:53:47,716 --> 01:53:52,551
- We'll make a full-scale search
as soon as we get ashore.
- Ashore?

1575
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:55,612
Sea Star Island.
That's where we're going, isn't it?

1576
01:53:55,690 --> 01:53:59,182
Apart from the fact
that we're shipwrecked,
that we have no means of gettin' there,

1577
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:01,524
and that we don't know
where it is anyway, yes.

1578
01:54:01,596 --> 01:54:04,121
You mustn't worry about things
like that, Matthew.

1579
01:54:04,199 --> 01:54:08,829
By my calculations, we were sort of
coming down in this direction like this,

1580
01:54:08,903 --> 01:54:12,532
and the floating island was sort of
coming down in that direction like that.

1581
01:54:12,607 --> 01:54:16,065
Then we sort of somehow or other
sort of more or less meet...

1582
01:54:16,144 --> 01:54:18,442
somewhere round about here.

1583
01:54:19,514 --> 01:54:21,505
Is that a fact?

1584
01:54:21,583 --> 01:54:24,677
Ah! There it is now.

1585
01:54:31,159 --> 01:54:35,357
Well, shall we go ashore?
[Toots]

1586
01:54:41,236 --> 01:54:43,227
[Dolittle]
Giddyap.

1587
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:58,378
I must remember to get meself
one of those.

1588
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:27,805
Hmph. Any sign of Fred?

1589
01:55:27,882 --> 01:55:30,817
Not yet. I only hope
she caught the island.

1590
01:55:30,885 --> 01:55:33,479
It won't be passing here
again for months.

1591
01:55:33,555 --> 01:55:36,080
You and Stubbins search the beaches.
I'll go inland.

1592
01:55:36,157 --> 01:55:40,753
- Meet back here in two or three hours.
- Yeah. Tommy?

1593
01:55:46,501 --> 01:55:50,528
Polynesia, I want every living creature
on this island looking for that girl.

1594
01:55:50,605 --> 01:55:52,539
Yes, Doctor.

1595
01:55:52,607 --> 01:55:55,667
- Every bird that can fly I want
airborne until she's found.
- Yes, Doctor.

1596
01:55:55,743 --> 01:55:58,473
She can't be at sea.
We'd have heard from the fish by now.

1597
01:55:58,546 --> 01:56:01,515
- You sure she'll be
all right, Polynesia?
- Yes, Doctor.

1598
01:56:01,583 --> 01:56:03,881
She's standing
right behind you.

1599
01:56:03,952 --> 01:56:05,886
Good morning.

1600
01:56:05,954 --> 01:56:08,946
Oh, good morning.

1601
01:56:09,023 --> 01:56:13,483
Um, afraid we had
a bit of a storm last night.

1602
01:56:15,930 --> 01:56:18,763
Thank you for telling me.

1603
01:56:18,833 --> 01:56:22,462
Pity you got lost. You could have
given us a hand getting these ashore.

1604
01:56:22,537 --> 01:56:25,870
I'm sorry. I was fully occupied
getting myself ashore.

1605
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:30,570
No mind. We managed. Some of these books
are very heavy though.

1606
01:56:30,645 --> 01:56:33,773
Saved all your books, I see.

1607
01:56:33,848 --> 01:56:37,340
- Yes, most fortunate.
- You lost all my dresses.

1608
01:56:37,418 --> 01:56:41,184
Yes, most unfortunate. I saw your trunk
floating amongst the wreckage.

1609
01:56:41,256 --> 01:56:44,089
However, the outfit you're
wearing this morning...

1610
01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:47,151
is the nicest thing I've seen you in
since you left England.

1611
01:56:47,228 --> 01:56:49,560
This is my underwear.

1612
01:56:49,631 --> 01:56:52,566
Oh. Anyway, it suits you.

1613
01:56:52,634 --> 01:56:55,660
I'm terribly glad to see you.

1614
01:56:58,072 --> 01:57:00,006
Are you?

1615
01:57:00,074 --> 01:57:03,976
Uh, well, we got
a tremendous lot to do.

1616
01:57:04,045 --> 01:57:07,548
We've got to unload the raft,
find food and build whatever
it is one has to build.

1617
01:57:07,681 --> 01:57:09,945
- What are you trying to say?
- Hmm?

1618
01:57:10,017 --> 01:57:12,281
Why don't you say what you mean?

1619
01:57:12,352 --> 01:57:14,843
What do you mean, say what I mean?

1620
01:57:14,922 --> 01:57:17,413
[Music] For a month or more
I have listened and dreamed [music]

1621
01:57:17,491 --> 01:57:22,190
[Music] While the moon has glistened
and a million stars have gleamed [music]

1622
01:57:22,262 --> 01:57:25,060
- [Music] Waiting [music]
- Waiting?

1623
01:57:25,132 --> 01:57:27,100
- [Music] Waiting [music]
- What for?

1624
01:57:27,167 --> 01:57:30,432
What for? [music] For a man
I know who is clever and kind [music]

1625
01:57:30,504 --> 01:57:35,567
[Music] But a man who never ever
seems to know his mind [music]

1626
01:57:35,642 --> 01:57:37,701
[Music] Waiting [music]

1627
01:57:38,779 --> 01:57:41,748
[Music] Waiting [music]

1628
01:57:41,815 --> 01:57:46,184
[Music] Waiting for you to say
you like me [music]

1629
01:57:46,253 --> 01:57:50,155
[Music] Or hate me or miss me
or kiss me or something [music]

1630
01:57:50,223 --> 01:57:54,626
[Music] But nothing
Nothing do you say [music]

1631
01:57:54,695 --> 01:57:57,721
[Music] At all [music]

1632
01:57:57,798 --> 01:58:02,861
[Music] Little wonder I feel
sorely neglected [music]

1633
01:58:02,936 --> 01:58:08,306
[Music] Unwanted, rejected and small [music]

1634
01:58:08,375 --> 01:58:13,608
[Music] Little more than two feet tall [music]

1635
01:58:15,215 --> 01:58:18,480
[Music] Lucky to be here [music]

1636
01:58:18,552 --> 01:58:21,419
[Music] At all [music]

1637
01:58:22,656 --> 01:58:24,590
Emma?

1638
01:58:27,828 --> 01:58:30,626
I think I... like you.

1639
01:58:32,199 --> 01:58:35,293
Yes, I think I do.

1640
01:58:36,970 --> 01:58:39,962
I think I like you.

1641
01:58:41,041 --> 01:58:43,532
[Music] I'm almost sure that I do [music]

1642
01:58:45,178 --> 01:58:48,341
[Music] I think I like
the way you look [music]

1643
01:58:48,415 --> 01:58:51,680
[Music] The way your eyes
reveal your mind [music]

1644
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:58,248
[Music] Like a precious book
that's hard to find [music]

1645
01:59:02,729 --> 01:59:07,257
[Music] I think I'm learning
something strange and new [music]

1646
01:59:08,368 --> 01:59:11,735
[Music] But it's well worth learning [music]

1647
01:59:11,805 --> 01:59:16,071
[Music] Because I'm learning about you [music]

1648
01:59:16,143 --> 01:59:18,236
[Music] Like dawning sunshine [music]

1649
01:59:18,311 --> 01:59:22,475
[Music] When a new day is due [music]

1650
01:59:22,549 --> 01:59:25,313
[Music] I think I like you [music]

1651
01:59:28,055 --> 01:59:31,684
[Music] And I think you like me too [music]

1652
01:59:31,758 --> 01:59:34,226
Do you?

1653
01:59:34,294 --> 01:59:36,262
Do you?

1654
01:59:36,329 --> 01:59:38,263
Do you?

1655
01:59:54,648 --> 01:59:58,379
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

1656
02:00:08,595 --> 02:00:10,529
[Bird Calling]

1657
02:00:10,597 --> 02:00:14,590
Good heavens. I do believe that's
a great crested oriental moonbird.

1658
02:00:14,668 --> 02:00:17,432
[Calling]

1659
02:00:17,504 --> 02:00:19,768
It's terribly rare.
I'm so glad we came.

1660
02:00:30,717 --> 02:00:33,584
Great crested oriental moonbird.

1661
02:00:33,653 --> 02:00:36,053
What a bit of luck.

1662
02:00:47,067 --> 02:00:49,865
Ah, that's better.

1663
02:00:49,936 --> 02:00:53,702
- [Jip Whimpering]
- Thank you very much. [Squeaking]

1664
02:00:53,774 --> 02:00:55,708
Bye-bye.

1665
02:01:01,081 --> 02:01:03,811
The locals aren't
a very friendly lot, are they?

1666
02:01:03,884 --> 02:01:07,115
I bet you anything you like
they're going to kill us.

1667
02:01:07,187 --> 02:01:11,817
Whoever said children had beautiful
minds had obviously never met you.

1668
02:01:11,892 --> 02:01:15,726
Bein' in prison is much
the same as bein' on a boat,

1669
02:01:15,796 --> 02:01:17,923
except in prison
there's less chance of drownin'.

1670
02:01:17,998 --> 02:01:19,932
And less chance of our
getting back to Puddleby.

1671
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,696
I must have a serious talk
to whoever runs this place.

1672
02:01:22,769 --> 02:01:25,431
I promised to get Stubbins home
in time to go to school.

1673
02:01:25,505 --> 02:01:29,441
I'm sure if you tell them that
we'll be out of here in no time.

1674
02:01:29,509 --> 02:01:34,845
Give me a leg up.
I want to see what's going on out there.

1675
02:01:34,915 --> 02:01:37,042
[Grunts]

1676
02:01:37,117 --> 02:01:40,143
[People Chattering]

1677
02:01:47,627 --> 02:01:50,494
Good heavens.
[Grunts]

1678
02:01:50,564 --> 02:01:53,032
All right, Matthew. Down.

1679
02:01:53,099 --> 02:01:56,125
- Why is it so cold?
- It's like being back in England.

1680
02:01:56,203 --> 02:01:58,967
There's a bit of frost. That's all.
It's quite clear what happened.

1681
02:01:59,039 --> 02:02:02,475
The storm that sank
the Flounder must have blown
the island off its usual course.

1682
02:02:02,542 --> 02:02:04,476
We're drifting too far north.

1683
02:02:04,544 --> 02:02:07,536
If we don't do something about it,
that marvelous vegetation
is going to die of frostbite.

1684
02:02:07,614 --> 02:02:09,548
To say nothin'
of our dear selves.

1685
02:02:18,558 --> 02:02:21,550
This is obviously
the gentleman to talk to.

1686
02:02:23,697 --> 02:02:26,097
Good morning.

1687
02:02:26,166 --> 02:02:30,762
Me Dr. Dolittle.
Search for great pink sea snail.

1688
02:02:30,837 --> 02:02:34,500
Small boy late for school.
Here very cold.

1689
02:02:34,574 --> 02:02:38,374
They all go home
Puddleby, yes?

1690
02:02:41,147 --> 02:02:43,081
What a funny accent.

1691
02:02:43,149 --> 02:02:45,083
Oh, I beg your pardon.

1692
02:02:45,151 --> 02:02:47,676
Actually, that's what
I came to see you about.

1693
02:02:55,295 --> 02:02:59,095
My name is William Shakespeare,
the Tenth. You may call me Willie.

1694
02:02:59,165 --> 02:03:01,429
Come with me, please.

1695
02:03:10,377 --> 02:03:13,073
Thank you.

1696
02:03:17,050 --> 02:03:19,143
We've had lots of
shipwrecks, of course.

1697
02:03:19,219 --> 02:03:23,451
Being a floating island does tend to
make us a bit of a danger to shipping.

1698
02:03:23,523 --> 02:03:25,991
We've bumped into lots
of things over the years.

1699
02:03:26,059 --> 02:03:29,290
But on the credit side, it enabled us
to build a marvelous museum...

1700
02:03:29,362 --> 02:03:34,197
and public library... books and
art treasures from all over the place.

1701
02:03:34,267 --> 02:03:37,430
Everybody on the island
speaks nine or ten languages.

1702
02:03:37,504 --> 02:03:40,667
We even name our children
after our favorite authors.

1703
02:03:40,740 --> 02:03:43,334
That's why my name
is William Shakespeare.

1704
02:03:43,410 --> 02:03:45,469
Do forgive this paraphernalia.

1705
02:03:45,545 --> 02:03:49,743
We're rehearsing now
The Merchant Of Venice
for our Shakespeare drama festival.

1706
02:03:49,816 --> 02:03:53,217
- Do sit down. Milk or lemon?
- Milk, please.

1707
02:03:53,286 --> 02:03:55,220
Must be a near perfect civilization.

1708
02:03:55,288 --> 02:03:57,722
Then what are we doin' in prison?

1709
02:03:57,791 --> 02:04:00,624
Purely a precaution, old boy,
a sort of quarantine.

1710
02:04:00,694 --> 02:04:03,754
Most of the white men who have
come here in the past...

1711
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:07,231
usually started killing people
before they've been introduced.

1712
02:04:07,300 --> 02:04:11,168
- Extraordinary. Help yourself to sugar.
- Thank you.

1713
02:04:11,237 --> 02:04:15,367
But they never stay long.
They can't stand the peace and quiet.

1714
02:04:15,442 --> 02:04:19,879
I love peace and quiet,
but unfortunately we won't
be able to stay long either.

1715
02:04:19,946 --> 02:04:22,881
We've got to continue our hunt
for the great pink sea snail.

1716
02:04:22,949 --> 02:04:25,611
You haven't by any chance heard
of it being in the vicinity?

1717
02:04:25,685 --> 02:04:28,984
At the moment you have a bigger problem
than looking for snails.

1718
02:04:29,055 --> 02:04:31,853
According to
popular superstition,

1719
02:04:31,925 --> 02:04:36,794
newcomers to the island
are responsible for all our misfortunes.

1720
02:04:36,863 --> 02:04:40,799
So the elders of the village
are blaming you for this frost.

1721
02:04:40,867 --> 02:04:44,496
I don't know what we can do
about that. Perhaps there
is something I can think of.

1722
02:04:44,571 --> 02:04:47,369
I do hope so for your sake.

1723
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:50,898
You see, it's written here
in the law book.

1724
02:04:50,977 --> 02:04:54,640
"He who brings sunshine
to the coldness of our days...

1725
02:04:54,714 --> 02:04:58,172
shall bask in the splendor
of a thousand summers."

1726
02:04:58,251 --> 02:05:00,742
- That's very nice.
- Yeah.

1727
02:05:00,820 --> 02:05:03,983
Yes, but it goes on.

1728
02:05:04,057 --> 02:05:07,652
"He who brings winter
into the summer of our lives...

1729
02:05:07,727 --> 02:05:11,094
shall die the death
of a thousand screams."

1730
02:05:11,164 --> 02:05:14,327
- Oh.
- I prefer the first one.

1731
02:05:14,401 --> 02:05:16,562
Yes, so did I.

1732
02:05:16,669 --> 02:05:20,161
The elders are also blaming you
for what's happened to the animals.

1733
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:22,174
What has happened
to the animals?

1734
02:05:22,242 --> 02:05:26,508
They've all caught colds.
They're coughing and sneezing
all over the place.

1735
02:05:26,579 --> 02:05:30,481
I must do something about this
immediately. Come along, Polynesia.

1736
02:05:30,550 --> 02:05:32,518
We've got work to do.

1737
02:05:33,586 --> 02:05:35,679
- [Squawking]
- [Sneezes]

1738
02:05:35,755 --> 02:05:38,053
- Bless you.
- [Sneezes]

1739
02:05:38,124 --> 02:05:40,217
Gesundheit.
[Squawks]

1740
02:05:43,730 --> 02:05:46,028
Ha.

1741
02:05:46,099 --> 02:05:48,431
- [Animal Sneezes]
- [Polynesia] Bless you.

1742
02:05:48,501 --> 02:05:52,437
Here you are, Tommy. Another little
baby lion for you to take care of.

1743
02:05:52,505 --> 02:05:55,099
- Yes, sir.
- [Sneezes]

1744
02:05:55,175 --> 02:05:57,109
[Polynesia]
Bless you.

1745
02:05:57,177 --> 02:05:59,771
That inhalant seems
to be working very well.

1746
02:05:59,846 --> 02:06:04,749
- [Elephant Moans, Sneezes]
- [Polynesia] Bless you.

1747
02:06:04,818 --> 02:06:08,686
I was hoping this
mustard bath would work.

1748
02:06:08,755 --> 02:06:12,748
- Still very hot.
- [Trumpets]

1749
02:06:13,927 --> 02:06:16,725
How soon will
my cough mixture be ready?

1750
02:06:16,796 --> 02:06:20,493
- Five minutes. Smell.
- Mmm!

1751
02:06:20,567 --> 02:06:23,434
I'd give it to the baby elephant
first, if I were you.

1752
02:06:23,503 --> 02:06:25,869
- Why?
- She's got a terrible cold.

1753
02:06:25,939 --> 02:06:28,373
I want to control it
before she gives it to the family.

1754
02:06:28,441 --> 02:06:31,001
When a herd of elephants start sneezing,
it's like a hurricane.

1755
02:06:31,077 --> 02:06:36,749
Might drive the island even further
off course. Thank you very much.

1756
02:06:36,882 --> 02:06:38,645
- [Elephant Moans, Sneezes]
- [Polynesia] Gesundheit.

1757
02:06:38,717 --> 02:06:43,654
If we was to point them
in the right direction, perhaps
they could blow us back on course.

1758
02:06:43,722 --> 02:06:46,657
Pretty good theory,
but terribly difficult to organize.

1759
02:06:46,725 --> 02:06:49,626
If elephants could swim,
one good shove...

1760
02:06:49,695 --> 02:06:53,563
and we'd be back in a southerly current
before we could...

1761
02:06:55,134 --> 02:06:57,398
Why didn't I think of that before?

1762
02:06:57,469 --> 02:07:00,961
- They can swim.
- What, elephants?

1763
02:07:01,039 --> 02:07:05,669
No, no, no, Matthew. Tommy, what's
as big as an elephant that can swim?

1764
02:07:05,744 --> 02:07:08,042
A whale, sir.

1765
02:07:08,113 --> 02:07:10,775
Exactly.

1766
02:07:10,849 --> 02:07:14,114
Emma, get on
with the cough mixture.

1767
02:07:14,186 --> 02:07:16,677
- [Horse Whinnies, Sneezes]
- [Polynesia] Bless you.

1768
02:07:16,755 --> 02:07:19,519
Now, how do you get
in touch with a whale?

1769
02:07:20,826 --> 02:07:23,989
- [Grunting]
- I'll talk to him immediately.

1770
02:07:24,062 --> 02:07:26,656
Splendid.

1771
02:07:26,732 --> 02:07:31,169
Good morning. Marvelous,
if the giraffe doesn't mind.

1772
02:07:31,236 --> 02:07:35,138
- [Screeching]
- Extremely kind of you.
I do appreciate it.

1773
02:07:37,776 --> 02:07:39,141
- [Sneezes]
- Bless you.

1774
02:07:39,211 --> 02:07:42,840
You'll explain? Good.

1775
02:07:54,693 --> 02:07:56,854
Here he comes.

1776
02:07:56,929 --> 02:08:02,265
It was very decent of that turtle
to put us in touch with him.

1777
02:08:02,334 --> 02:08:04,495
[Willie]
My word! He's a big fellow.

1778
02:08:06,171 --> 02:08:10,938
Now, if he gave a shove below us,
that should just about do the trick.

1779
02:08:22,821 --> 02:08:25,255
[Whale Lows]

1780
02:08:28,927 --> 02:08:31,361
Good morning.

1781
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:34,092
[Wails]

1782
02:08:34,166 --> 02:08:39,627
One... shove... here.

1783
02:08:39,705 --> 02:08:44,301
[Lowing]

1784
02:08:44,376 --> 02:08:48,005
We really must learn to speak
a few words of whale.

1785
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:51,140
Apparently they're very nice,
but nobody ever talks to them.

1786
02:08:54,052 --> 02:08:57,920
[Squawking]

1787
02:09:12,371 --> 02:09:14,931
[Rumbling]

1788
02:09:15,007 --> 02:09:16,941
Look!

1789
02:09:21,513 --> 02:09:23,674
Why is it doing that?

1790
02:09:23,749 --> 02:09:26,240
The island is bound to roll
a bit after that shove.

1791
02:09:26,318 --> 02:09:28,309
It set that balancing rock
in motion.

1792
02:09:33,592 --> 02:09:37,756
- It'll soon calm down.
- That would be highly desirable.

1793
02:09:37,829 --> 02:09:41,060
It says here in the law book,

1794
02:09:41,133 --> 02:09:44,864
"He who causes the great rock
to fall into the hot mountain...

1795
02:09:44,937 --> 02:09:48,805
shall die the death
of 10,000 screams."

1796
02:09:48,874 --> 02:09:50,808
[Rumbling]

1797
02:09:54,046 --> 02:09:55,980
[Rock Crashing]

1798
02:09:58,317 --> 02:10:03,345
- Uh, how many screams did you say?
- 10,000.

1799
02:10:03,422 --> 02:10:07,950
I shouldn't have thought
it was worth more than five.

1800
02:10:18,804 --> 02:10:22,934
- I cannot tell you
how upset I am about this.
- You're upset?

1801
02:10:23,008 --> 02:10:24,942
We realize it isn't your fault.

1802
02:10:25,010 --> 02:10:29,344
I've been through the law book
from cover to cover.
There is nothing I can do.

1803
02:10:29,414 --> 02:10:34,317
- This is the tradition.
- Oh, well, we hate to break a tradition.

1804
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:53,328
I once heard a story about
a tribe that burned people alive,
then et them for dinner.

1805
02:10:53,405 --> 02:10:55,999
I bet that's what
they're going to do to us.

1806
02:10:56,074 --> 02:11:00,773
Will you please put a curb
on your lurid imagination?

1807
02:11:00,846 --> 02:11:03,041
I'm sorry about this, Emma.

1808
02:11:03,115 --> 02:11:05,777
It hasn't been very relaxing
the last few days, has it?

1809
02:11:29,207 --> 02:11:32,199
[Whimpering, Hooting, Squawking]

1810
02:12:15,821 --> 02:12:19,484
I think we've bumped
into something.

1811
02:12:33,605 --> 02:12:35,266
Stop!

1812
02:12:37,542 --> 02:12:39,703
Release them!

1813
02:12:39,778 --> 02:12:42,440
[Crowd Murmuring]

1814
02:12:42,514 --> 02:12:45,039
Holy Pat.
What did we do now?

1815
02:12:46,585 --> 02:12:50,681
We've collided with the mainland.
The two pieces fit perfectly.

1816
02:12:50,755 --> 02:12:52,916
- How extraordinary.
- Not really.

1817
02:12:52,991 --> 02:12:55,516
The oldest legend of the island
has always maintained...

1818
02:12:55,594 --> 02:12:59,496
that we are a bit of Africa
that has been missing for 5,000 years.

1819
02:12:59,564 --> 02:13:01,691
Is there a reward
for finding it?

1820
02:13:01,766 --> 02:13:05,031
Oh, indeed, yes.

1821
02:13:05,103 --> 02:13:08,630
"He who brings back
the lost island from the sea...

1822
02:13:08,707 --> 02:13:12,336
shall live as a god
for a thousand moons."

1823
02:13:12,410 --> 02:13:14,970
- [Applause]
- Thank you. Thank you.

1824
02:13:15,046 --> 02:13:18,641
That's very pleasant,
but if you will excuse me,
I must get back to the hospital,

1825
02:13:18,717 --> 02:13:23,017
in case the elephant sneezes
and blows all the other patients away.

1826
02:13:23,088 --> 02:13:26,489
- [Animal Moaning]
- What will you do when
the animals are all well again?

1827
02:13:26,558 --> 02:13:31,996
I have one great ambition.
I came to find a great pink sea snail.
I intend to find it.

1828
02:13:32,063 --> 02:13:34,691
The great pink sea snail
is more than mythical.

1829
02:13:34,766 --> 02:13:36,700
I always thought that,
too, Willie.

1830
02:13:41,373 --> 02:13:43,466
No, no. You can see
the animals as they come out.

1831
02:13:43,542 --> 02:13:45,476
- Guard the gate, Matthew.
- [Children] Oh!

1832
02:13:45,544 --> 02:13:49,640
Come on. Come on.
[Clears Throat]

1833
02:13:49,714 --> 02:13:54,481
- Why does he have the animals in there?
- All right, all right.

1834
02:13:54,553 --> 02:13:57,386
I'll tell ya.

1835
02:13:57,455 --> 02:14:02,654
Behind these gates is the most
wonderful place in all the world.

1836
02:14:02,727 --> 02:14:05,423
- Can we see it?

- Yes, I see.
Well, just a minute. Amazing!
- What is?

1897
02:18:32,730 --> 02:18:36,666
We've been searching
for weeks for the great snail.
He's been with us all the time.

1898
02:18:36,734 --> 02:18:39,362
Lives in an underground cave
and moves about with the island.

1899
02:18:39,437 --> 02:18:42,873
I was quite right. He's got a shocking
cold. I told him I was a doctor,

1900
02:18:42,941 --> 02:18:46,069
and if he'd come on the beach,
I'd mix him a batch of my special tonic.

1901
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:49,341
It'll need to be
rather large, won't it?

- What is it?
- He's purring.

1905
02:19:07,832 --> 02:19:13,099
Thrilled with his medicine. Feels much
more relaxed, almost like a new snail.

1906
02:19:13,171 --> 02:19:16,140
- Wanted to know if there's
anything he can do for us.
- Is there?

1907
02:19:16,207 --> 02:19:19,699
Yes, he can take you all
safely back to Puddleby.

1908
02:19:21,246 --> 02:19:24,579
Oh, well. Well, that's
a bit of an imposition.

1909
02:19:24,649 --> 02:19:28,415
Puddleby's a long way away. All you did
was give him a little medicine.

1910
02:19:28,486 --> 02:19:32,354
He's 2,000 years old.
He's lonely. It'll be company for him.

1911
02:19:32,423 --> 02:19:35,756
He'd been planning
to visit his cousin in Scotland
for 300 years and put it off.

1912
02:19:35,827 --> 02:19:37,761
Be a great opportunity for him.

1913
02:19:37,829 --> 02:19:40,423
- His cousin in Scotland?
- You've heard of the Loch Ness monster?

02:19:40,498 --> 02:19:42,432
- Yes.
- Well, it's a cousin.

But it's bad enough on top.
We'd all drown, Doctor.

1917
02:19:48,506 --> 02:19:51,031
No, the shell is
completely watertight.

1918
02:19:51,109 --> 02:19:53,373
It'll be like traveling
in a big pink bubble.

1919
02:19:53,444 --> 02:19:58,381
Yes, he says he can get you back
to Puddleby by two weeks from Tuesday.

02:20:13,298 --> 02:20:16,734
This must be the only snail
in the world with four bedrooms.

1921
02:20:16,801 --> 02:20:18,735
Oh, and, Polynesia,

1922
02:20:18,803 --> 02:20:24,173
don't forget to remind
the snail to surface twice a day
for his cough mixture.

1923
02:20:24,242 --> 02:20:27,370
It will fix up his cold, and stretch
your legs and get some sea air.

1924
02:20:27,445 --> 02:20:29,743
- [Squawks] Yes, Doctor.
- Oh, good.

1925
02:20:29,814 --> 02:20:32,544
I'd hate to miss my turn on deck.

1926
02:20:32,617 --> 02:20:36,610
And, Chee-Chee, don't eat all
the bananas. Leave some for the others.

1927
02:20:36,688 --> 02:20:41,455
- [Moans]
- Shh, shh. Don't be sad.

1928
02:20:41,526 --> 02:20:43,460
[Matthew]
That's all, sir.

1929
02:20:43,528 --> 02:20:46,292
Good-bye, Stubbins.
Go up to the house whenever you like.

1930
02:20:46,364 --> 02:20:50,198
Yes, sir. And, Doctor,
come home soon, sir.

1931
02:20:51,569 --> 02:20:53,503
Well...

1932
02:21:00,178 --> 02:21:05,445
Well, I'll, uh... I'll send your other
high hat back from Puddleby, Doctor.

1933
02:21:05,516 --> 02:21:08,485
The snail can bring it
back with him.

1934
02:21:08,553 --> 02:21:10,987
Yours is looking
a little grubby now.

1935
02:21:11,055 --> 02:21:13,853
You'll probably find it
a bit difficult to get one here.

1936
02:21:13,925 --> 02:21:17,019
Yes, uh, probably.

1937
02:21:18,196 --> 02:21:20,357
Well, thank you, Matthew.

1938
02:21:21,432 --> 02:21:23,593
Well, uh, good-bye.

1939
02:21:23,668 --> 02:21:25,863
- [Polynesia Crying]
- Bye.

1940
02:21:25,937 --> 02:21:28,507
[Crying]

1941
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:31,438
Uh, give my love
to everyone at home,

1942
02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:34,377
to Gub-Gub and Dab-Dab
and everyone.

1943
02:21:34,446 --> 02:21:36,937
Good-bye, John Dolittle.

1944
02:21:38,016 --> 02:21:40,450
Take care!

1945
02:21:45,223 --> 02:21:49,887
Well, Tom, I still wish
he was comin' with us.

1946
02:21:49,961 --> 02:21:54,227
I've never driven
one of these things before.

1947
02:21:56,768 --> 02:21:58,702
[Children Laughing]

1948
02:22:03,808 --> 02:22:06,675
Sure you won't change your mind
and come with us?

1949
02:22:06,745 --> 02:22:11,842
I can't, Emma. Your uncle will put me
away the moment I set foot in Puddleby.

1950
02:22:11,917 --> 02:22:13,908
But you have
to come back one day.

1951
02:22:13,985 --> 02:22:17,546
I hope so. A lot
of animals depend on me.

1952
02:22:17,622 --> 02:22:20,682
One or two people too.

1953
02:22:23,495 --> 02:22:28,159
Puddleby's going to seem
very dull after all this excitement.

1954
02:22:28,233 --> 02:22:30,861
I mean, what are you
going to do here?

1955
02:22:30,936 --> 02:22:34,428
I think I'll start
planning my next voyage.

1956
02:22:34,506 --> 02:22:37,566
Where are you going
this time? The moon?

1957
02:22:37,642 --> 02:22:40,634
- Very probably, yes.
- You're not serious.

1958
02:22:40,712 --> 02:22:42,771
- Oh, yes.
- How?

1959
02:22:42,847 --> 02:22:46,146
On the giant lunar moth.
Magnificent creature.

1960
02:22:46,217 --> 02:22:48,151
Flies backwards and forwards
between the earth and the moon.

1961
02:22:48,219 --> 02:22:50,813
When it reaches one,
it's attracted by the light
of the other and flies back again.

1962
02:22:50,889 --> 02:22:52,823
Willie tells me
there's one on the island.

1963
02:22:52,891 --> 02:22:55,689
My idea is to build some sort
of saddle arrangement,

1964
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:58,456
- very secure,
so I don't fall off halfway.
- Can I come?

1965
02:23:00,031 --> 02:23:01,965
Hmm?

1966
02:23:02,033 --> 02:23:04,558
Can I come with you?

1967
02:23:06,371 --> 02:23:09,932
Emma, I'm afraid...

1968
02:23:10,008 --> 02:23:14,001
I'm not very good with people.

1969
02:23:14,079 --> 02:23:18,709
L... I'm all right
with animals, but people...

1970
02:23:18,783 --> 02:23:21,980
[Sighs]
I'm not very good with.

1971
02:23:22,053 --> 02:23:24,681
I never have been.
I don't know why.

1972
02:23:32,330 --> 02:23:34,924
I'll write to you.

1973
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:40,336
I'll organize an air postal service
with the seagulls.

1974
02:23:46,845 --> 02:23:48,813
I'll miss you, John Dolittle.

1975
02:24:47,338 --> 02:24:51,775
- [Crying]
- [Whimpering]

1976
02:24:53,945 --> 02:24:58,848
- [Polynesia Crying]
- [Crying]

1977
02:25:13,965 --> 02:25:17,492
Well, I'll tell you one thing, Tom.

1978
02:25:17,569 --> 02:25:21,369
If we ever drown in this thing,
it'll be in a flood of tears.

1979
02:25:41,126 --> 02:25:45,495
[Barking]

1980
02:25:47,766 --> 02:25:50,394
[Seal Barking]

1981
02:25:53,605 --> 02:25:56,870
Sophie. What are you doing here?

1982
02:25:56,941 --> 02:26:00,775
[Sophie Barks]

1983
02:26:02,013 --> 02:26:06,950
No. Oh, how do you do, sir?

1984
02:26:07,018 --> 02:26:10,283
Really? Good Lord.

1985
02:26:10,355 --> 02:26:14,485
Sophie, that's marvelous news.
Thank you very much, indeed.

1986
02:26:14,559 --> 02:26:19,428
[Seals Chattering]

1987
02:26:19,497 --> 02:26:21,761
Good-bye, Sophie.
Thank you. Thank you!

1988
02:26:21,833 --> 02:26:24,495
[Barks]

1989
02:26:24,569 --> 02:26:29,734
"Good night, sweet Prince, and flights
of angels sing thee to thy rest."

1990
02:26:29,808 --> 02:26:32,971
Willie! Willie!
Wonderful news.

1991
02:26:33,044 --> 02:26:36,241
Sophie, the seal,
and her husband have come to tell me...

1992
02:26:36,314 --> 02:26:38,509
all the animals in England
are on strike.

1993
02:26:38,583 --> 02:26:40,983
They refuse to do any work
until I'm reprieved.

1994
02:26:41,052 --> 02:26:44,544
- You can go home?
- Yes. The local magistrate
is begging me to go back.

1995
02:26:44,622 --> 02:26:46,954
The whole country's paralyzed
without the animals.

1996
02:26:47,025 --> 02:26:49,994
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

1997
02:26:50,061 --> 02:26:53,690
I think that tree
is about the right size.

1998
02:26:53,765 --> 02:26:57,132
It's a 60-foot overall wingspan.

1999
02:26:57,202 --> 02:27:01,229
- But you've missed the snail.
- I've got a better idea.
I'm going to fly home.

2000
02:27:01,306 --> 02:27:05,037
Can you imagine their faces
when they see me on the quayside
waiting for them in Puddleby?

2001
02:27:05,109 --> 02:27:09,239
- Fly home?
- Since you say there's one
on the island, on the lunar moth.

2002
02:27:09,314 --> 02:27:12,750
- Help me make a model so I can
gauge where to put the saddle.
- Certainly.

2003
02:27:12,817 --> 02:27:15,547
I've got to allow for
a very steep rate of climb.

2004
02:27:15,620 --> 02:27:19,249
Now, you see,
you'll be the wings.

2005
02:27:19,324 --> 02:27:22,316
All of you. That's it.

2006
02:27:22,393 --> 02:27:25,055
Just sit down inside
those lines I've just drawn.

2007
02:27:25,129 --> 02:27:28,064
Everybody. That's the idea.

2008
02:27:28,132 --> 02:27:32,262
Good. Yes, I think
it's going to work splendidly.

2009
02:27:32,337 --> 02:27:36,569
As soon as I've built this saddle, we'll
go and have a chat with the lunar moth.

2010
02:27:36,641 --> 02:27:40,202
I only hope he understands
common house moth. That's all I speak.

2011
02:27:40,278 --> 02:27:43,179
Then as soon as the moon comes up,
we'll be off to Puddleby.

2012
02:27:43,248 --> 02:27:45,216
Wonderful night for flying.

2013
02:27:45,283 --> 02:27:48,252
By my calculations I should
be home in time for breakfast.

2014
02:27:49,854 --> 02:27:50,889
[Choir]
[Music]My friend the doctor says [music]

2015
02:27:50,889 --> 02:27:52,652
[Choir]
[Music]My friend the doctor says [music]

2016
02:27:52,724 --> 02:27:54,692
[Music] The stars are made
of lemon drops [music]

2017
02:27:54,759 --> 02:27:58,559
[Music] The bigger ones
are lollipops and ice [music]

2018
02:27:58,630 --> 02:28:00,621
[Music] The clouds have shops
up on the tops [music]

2019
02:28:00,698 --> 02:28:02,791
[Music] That sell you sweets
and soda pops [music]

2020
02:28:02,867 --> 02:28:06,803
[Music] What do they call the place
Isn't it paradise [music]

2021
02:28:06,871 --> 02:28:10,739
[Music]Maybe what the doctor tells me [music]

2022
02:28:10,808 --> 02:28:14,539
[Music]Isn't altogether true [music]

2023
02:28:14,612 --> 02:28:18,810
[Music]But I know every tale he tells me [music]

2024
02:28:18,883 --> 02:28:22,683
[Music]I don't know any better ones
Do you [music]

2025
02:28:22,754 --> 02:28:26,747
[Music]My friend the doctor says
the world is full of fantasy [music]

2026
02:28:26,824 --> 02:28:30,225
[Music]And who are you and I
to disagree [music]

2027
02:28:30,295 --> 02:28:32,661
[Music]Let's hope and pray
that is the way [music]

2028
02:28:32,730 --> 02:28:34,925
[Music] The life we love
will always stay [music]

2029
02:28:34,999 --> 02:28:38,264
[Music]For my friend the doctor [music]

2030
02:28:38,336 --> 02:28:42,966
[Music]And me [music]
