[Hank] You know, Frannie,
I think a vacation adventure...

184
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,966
would be a very good idea
for us.

185
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,232
Actually, this is a pretty solid house,
isn't it?

186
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,402
I mean, this is a good house.

187
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,809
- Well, this house could be made...
- You know, in Bora-Bora, there's no...

188
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,814
- Sorry. Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:49,047
- No. You go.
- Well, you see, that's the thing.

190
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,520
- Mm-hmm.
- This could be a good investment.

191
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,024
Mm-hmm.

192
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,789
I know. If we could afford it.

00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:02,231
What do you mean?
We bought it. It's ours.

Our money? You spent our money
without asking me?

When I first met you, Hank,
I thought,

this is not the guy for me.

206
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:54,714
No way. You didn't look like him.
You didn't talk like him.

207
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,584
You weren't him.

00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,575
And then I started to love you.
'Cause you were nice.

212
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,310
- Nice?
- Yeah. You were nice.

213
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:26,782
You were really nice.

214
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:31,151
I thought maybe you'd change a little,
and I would change a little.

215
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:35,215
We'd both get together,
and everything would be all right.

216

But you haven't changed.

217
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,333
And you're not even nice anymore.

What about you, Frannie?

219
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,665
You know, you used to
shave your legs all the time.

00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,267
Now you don't shave them for weeks.

221
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:58,214
You were very appetizing.
But now...

[Scoffs] What do you mean, "now"?
What about yourself?

00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,051
You used
to have a pretty good build, you know?

224
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,594
You did. Now you're starting
to look like... an egg.

- Egg?
- Yes, an egg.

226
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,097
Hey, if I was putting on a few pounds,
you could have said somethin'.

227
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,999
Why didn't you say somethin'?

228
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,868
Because, frankly, you never listen
to anything I say anyway.

229
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,101
That's because
you've got nothin' to say.

Oh, yes, I have something to say.
I have lots to say.

I have lots to say.
I've got plenty to say.

That's great. You're really
saying something now. Terrific.

You're always talking about paradise,

it's still gonna be you and
all your shit walking along the beach.

Yeah? Not all my shit.
Because you'll still be here.

This time it is really over.

it was over last New Year's Eve...

when I didn't want to
kiss you at midnight.

I wanted to kiss what's-her-name,

- Moe?
- Yes, Moe. Your best friend, Moe.

253
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,768
He followed me into the bathroom.
He had my blouse half off. He had
his tongue down my throat.

254
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,780
- And I was enjoying it.
- You kissed Moe?

255
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,009
- Don't you come near me. Stay away.
Don't you touch me.

You called that tall blond
the next day too, didn't you?

that you're just after me for my body?

ask you that a long time.

you were after me for my body.

- What?

- Did I ever what?

281
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,588
What happened with you and Frannie
last New Year's Eve?

282
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,586
New Year's Eve? Jesus.
I don't remember that.

283
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,132
She said you were kissing her
in the bathroom.

284
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,499
Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, uh...

285
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:42,700
No. Nothing happened. It was just
a New Year's kiss. You know.

286
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,708
- New Year's kiss?
- Yeah. I mean, it was New Year's Eve.

287
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,210
Everybody was kissing everybody.
You even tried to kiss me.

288
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,304
- She said you had her blouse off.
- She said that?

289
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:54,181
- Yeah.
- I don't remember nobody...

290
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,481
I don't remember her blouse being off.

291
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:00,615
Did you unbutton her blouse,
or did she take it off?

292
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,626
- She didn't take her blouse off.
- She didn't?

293
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:07,597
- No, uh, I don't remember.
- You're my best friend.

294
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,668
If I can't trust you,
who am I gonna trust?

295
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,838
Look, nothing happened
on New Year's Eve, okay?

296
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,909
- Let's leave it at that.
- Yeah, I bet nothing happened.

297
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,501
Wait a minute.
What's wrong with you?

298
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,708
Nothing happened in the bathroom.
Everybody was drinking, having a good...

299
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:28,752
I don't believe you, you know that?
I think you're a snake.

300
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,788
Don't call me no snake, man.

301
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,858
If you want to start calling names,
what aboutJan Morehouse?

302
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,757
- Jan Morehouse?
- I never did bring that up to you.

303
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,092
- That was different.
- What was different about it?

304
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,665
- You didn't love her.
- Hey, don't tell me who I love.

305
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:46,101
She was just a good-time girl.
Besides, I didn't want to hurt ya.

306
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,662
Didn't want to hurt me?
So both of you hurt me in my bed...

307
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,141
while I'm out getting pizza
like an idiot?

I had written those poems.

Unfortunately, yes.

She's with that guy,
isn't she?

916

Love is for suckers.

the same things you want.

Well, what would we do, Ray?

921
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:17,795
- We would follow our hearts.
- Where to?

922
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,801
- Wherever they take us.
- Really?

923
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:24,805
Sure. We could go
to the airport, take a plane...

924
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:28,934
- and wake up in Paris or Rome,

the South Pacific, hmm?

926
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:32,946
- We couldn't do that.
- Why not?

927
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:35,016
- Not really.
- What do you mean we couldn't do it?

928

What's stopping us?
You got the travel agency. I got money.

- Yeah.
- On top of each other.

You're beautiful.

I'll be right back, okay?

# Oh, baby #

1205
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:26,176
# This one's from the heart #

1206
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:54,040
#Maybe I'll go down
to the corner #

1207
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:57,515
#And get a racing form #

1208
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:03,647
#But I should probably wait here #

1209
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:06,727
#By the phone #

1210
01:36:09,663 --> 01:36:12,894
# The brakes need adjustment #

1211
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,026
# On the convertible #

1212
01:36:19,974 --> 01:36:22,442
# Oh, baby #

1213
01:36:22,543 --> 01:36:25,068
# This one's from the heart #

1214
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:31,410
# The wind is climbin'#

1215
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:34,545
# The avocado tree #

1216
01:36:37,825 --> 01:36:40,658
#Rubbin'its back #

1217
01:36:40,761 --> 01:36:43,958
#Against the wall #

1218
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:53,062
#I pour myself a double sympathy #

1219
01:36:57,178 --> 01:36:59,169
# Oh, baby #

1220
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,681
# This one's from the heart #

1221
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:32,677
#And blonds, brunettes
and redheads #

1222
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:35,806
#Put their hammer down #

1223
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:41,848
# To pound a cold chisel
through my heart #

1224
01:37:46,093 --> 01:37:48,687
#But they were nothin'#

1225
01:37:48,796 --> 01:37:52,027
#But apostrophes #

1226
01:37:55,936 --> 01:37:58,268
# Oh, baby #

1227
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:02,274
# This one's from the heart ##
