I must inject one sad note
into these proceedings.

618
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:33,763
The sudden and strange disappearance
of a man, a coworker...

619
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:38,184
who truly could be called
a cornerstone of this building:

620
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:42,981
Sheriff Octavius Glick.
How I wish he were present today.

621
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,400
Present? He's leaning on him.

622
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:51,114
I trust he's out of town on business
and isn't the victim of foul play.

623
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,867
That was no foul.
That was a solid hit.

624
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,790
I know you will join me in
dedicating this great new building...

625
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:04,293
to Sheriff Glick,
a man of principle...

626
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,840
a man of determination,
a man who would not bend.

Robbo. Listen, come here.

but I don't hear thanks.

the hots for tough guys.

- Nah. Not especially.

644

my invitation for dinner tonight?

That's what my boys want to know.

For which, by the way, I thank you.

I told you once, that's not my racket.
I had nothing to do with it.

it's discouraging.

ROBBO:
Yeah?

ROBBO: Who?

775
00:59:39,702 --> 00:59:41,537
Allen A. Dale.

This unheralded intrusion
into your presence...

You're popular, Mr. Robbo.

You like this character, huh?

810
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:36,985
He was the most beloved rogue
in literature.

811
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,655
Brave, handsome, compassionate.

812

- Even your looks.

- Give this kid a drink.
- No, it's forbidden, you see.

I've been warned

817

No, no, not an orphan.

I learned to skip before I could walk.

I was up for adoption

Terribly discouraging.

older than his father?

secretarial work at the home.

1077
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:03,568

- Oh, yeah</i>

1078
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:06,112
<i>I'll</i> testify. I want to testify.

1079
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,031
ALLEN:
Then cleanse yourself, my child.

1080
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:11,993
I know this poor, unfortunate soul...

1081
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:15,162
and the fight
she's waging against sin.

1082
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:19,041
That devil hooch has turned her
into an unsightly person.

1083
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:24,046
- Give us your testimony, my child.
- Well, it all began with Daddy.

1084
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,090
GROUP: Yes?

1085
01:21:26,257 --> 01:21:29,552
There's a gambling layout here
and we'll find it.

1086
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:31,095
GROUP: Yeah!

1087
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:33,431
WOMAN: Do you know how
old he was when he died?

1088
01:21:33,598 --> 01:21:35,182
GROUP: No.

1089
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:36,851
He was 25.

1090
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:38,769
GROUP: No!

1091
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,732
That's why I've got to come clean.

1092
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:46,402
GROUP: Why?
- Because I'm already 17.

1093
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:48,738
<i>- Who's to blame?
- Who's to blame?</i>

1094
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:50,615
<i>- What his name?
- We know his name</i>

1095
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:54,577

I want to testify!
You've got to let me testify.

1104
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:26,275
Come forward, dear brother.
Come forward.

1105
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:29,195
You see here a man who
just last year...

1106
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:33,574
was the United States Olympic
heavyweight wrestling champion.

1107
01:22:33,783 --> 01:22:37,787
A shadow of his former self,
wasted in health, ravaged by sin.

1108
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:40,081
Give us your testimony, brother.

1109
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,416
I was cruel.

1110
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:46,837
- I was mean.
GROUP: He was mean.

1111
01:22:47,046 --> 01:22:48,422
I was a...

1112
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:50,216
pickpocket.

1113
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:53,469
GROUP: Oh, no, not a pickpocket!

1114
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:55,304
Then, sin got me in...

1115
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:57,848
- Gin.
- A little bit of that too.

1116
01:22:58,057 --> 01:23:02,436
Sin and gin got me in its clutches.
That's why I need forgiving.

1117
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:03,729
GROUP: Why?

1118
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:06,691
Now my hand shakes so much,
I can't even make a living.

1119
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:08,985
<i>- That's a shame
- What a shame</i>

1120
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:11,028
<i>- Who's to blame?
- Who's to blame?</i>

1121
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:14,949
<i>- His name is Mister Booze
- Mister Booze</i>

1122
01:23:15,116 --> 01:23:18,703
<i>- Mister B double-O Z E
- You must refuse</i>

1123
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:22,331
How do you believe this?
I tell you, it walked away?

1124
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,333
Knock down the walls...

1125
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:28,170
- It's a revival meeting.
- It ain't a revival meeting.

1126
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:30,881
Every crapshooter in town's here.

1127
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:33,759
There's a joint here. We'll find it.

1128
01:23:33,968 --> 01:23:36,512
<i>- Testify, testify, testify
- Oh, yeah</i>

1129
01:23:37,013 --> 01:23:39,598
- I want to testify.
- You don't have to...

1130
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:41,851
- I want to.
- You don't have to...

1131
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:45,354
- Oh, let him testify.
- Very well.

1132
01:23:45,563 --> 01:23:50,026
Then let us lead you on the path
of righteousness. Not long ago...

1133
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:54,363
he was the foremost brain surgeon
in this grand and glorious country.

1134
01:23:54,572 --> 01:23:56,782
Success was smiling upon him.

1135
01:23:56,991 --> 01:24:00,703
Go ahead, tell us your story,
oh, downtrodden one.

1136
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:07,877
I used spirits for medicinal
purposes only.

1137
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:09,086
GROUP: Yeah?

1138
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:13,007
I manufactured it for medicinal
purposes only.

1139
01:24:13,174 --> 01:24:14,884
GROUP: Yeah?

1140
01:24:15,051 --> 01:24:17,887
Then I drank what I manufactured...

1141
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:22,266
and drank myself out of business
for medicinal purposes only.

1142
01:24:22,475 --> 01:24:24,727
GROUP: That's right!

1143
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:28,189
<i>Alcohol makes a big man small
And can lead to life of crime</i>

And you cash in before your time.</i>

1145
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:36,155
<i>Bootleg gin puts you in a spin

01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:43,245
<i>Oh, Mister Booze, Mister Booze</i>

1148
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:46,916
<i>Mister B double-O Z E

- I give up. I'm pulling my men.
- You can't.

1150
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:54,632
If I don't pull them,
I won't have any.

1151
01:24:54,799 --> 01:24:58,552
<i>Don't mess with Mister Booze
Don't mess with Mister Booze</i>

1152
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,638
We're leaving.

1153
01:25:00,805 --> 01:25:03,140
<i>Don't mess with Mister Booze</i>

1156
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:13,901
<i>And you're gonna lose with Mister Booze</i>

1157
01:25:14,068 --> 01:25:16,112
Peace be with you, brother.

1158
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:19,698
You, brother, you can drop dead.

1159
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:22,159
Peace, all you fine gentlemen.

1160
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:25,746
<i>- Don't mess with Mister Booze
- Oh, yeah</i>

1161
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:29,375
<i>- Don't mess with Mister Booze
- Oh, what he say now</i>

1162
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:36,549
<i>Don't mess with Mister Booze</i>

1163
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:21,260
Now Robbo's a national personality.
People love him.

1164
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:24,722
They spend money in his joint
while we're dying.

1165
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:28,267
My old man's getting
free soup every day.

1166
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:30,603
Not important. Forget about it.

1167
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:33,772
I think he's a threat
to the younger generation.

1168
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:38,444
I caught a kid stealing my tires,
he pulls a bow and arrow on me.

1169
01:26:38,611 --> 01:26:41,238
My old man gets free soup every day...

1170
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:43,449
Forget about that soup already!

1171
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:46,660
If you're so impressed,
go join his merry men.

1172
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:51,540
Stick a feather in your ear, walk
around in green drag, you'll be happy.

1173
01:26:51,749 --> 01:26:56,253
What's the matter? You can't see
what he's doing in your heads?

1174
01:26:56,462 --> 01:26:58,422
I gotta explain that to you.

1175
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:03,010
This man's organizing himself the
biggest bodyguard there ever was:

1176
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:04,803
The people of Chicago.

1177
01:27:05,012 --> 01:27:09,183
He's in so thick with them, you
can't touch him with a flagpole.

1178
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:12,228
Now once and for all,
this man's gotta go.

1179
01:27:12,686 --> 01:27:15,856
We can't have any violence,
I warn you.

1180
01:27:16,065 --> 01:27:19,151
Forget the warnings. Just sit down.

1181
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:24,657
My friend is working on
a cornerstone for a synagogue.

1182
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:28,118
- No.
- Even if we get Robbo to convert?

1183
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:30,579
Disappearing is the same as hitting.

1184
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:32,456
[COUGHS]

1185
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:36,085
- Open a window.
- I got an idea.

1186
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:38,921
Somebody open a window anyway.

1187
01:27:39,129 --> 01:27:44,343
Before we offed the sheriff,
I took some things from him.

1188
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:49,181
His badge, his gun, his wallet
with his driver's license.

1189
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:51,809
GUY:
Keep talking, Vermin.

1190
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:54,270
Maybe we could use the stuff.

1191
01:27:54,687 --> 01:27:56,939
We could put it in a certain place.

1192
01:27:58,357 --> 01:28:03,696
I like what you're saying.
Keep talking. Just keep talking.

1193
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:07,032
I don't have
experience in this area.

1194
01:28:07,241 --> 01:28:09,618
But I think I can handle it.

1195
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:20,879
MAN: Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

1196
01:28:21,088 --> 01:28:23,132
GUY: I do.
- Take the stand.

1197
01:28:28,429 --> 01:28:32,224
Mr. Gisborne, tell the court
of a conversation...

1198
01:28:32,433 --> 01:28:37,062
between you and the defendant
after Big Jim's murder.

1199
01:28:37,271 --> 01:28:40,566
<i>I'll</i> tell you that story now.

1200
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:44,403
I was in the hotel
with some friends...

1201
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:48,157
we meet to play mahjong.

1202
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:52,786
It's 12:30, Robbo comes in.
He don't knock, nothing.

1203
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:56,874
He barges right in,
and he declares himself.

1204
01:28:57,082 --> 01:29:02,129
He says this, <i>I'll</i> never forget it,
now that Big Jim...

1205
01:29:02,338 --> 01:29:04,006
has gone to meet his maker...

1206
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:09,094
he's decided... He means
that the man was dead.

1207
01:29:09,303 --> 01:29:11,513
I want you to understand.

1208
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:13,640
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1209
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:17,644
Now he says Big Jim is dead,
he's the new boss...

1210
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:22,858
and everybody has to pay him
a 50-percent service charge...

1211
01:29:23,067 --> 01:29:24,943
that's for protection.

1212
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:28,113
Tell me, Mr. Gisborne...

1213
01:29:28,322 --> 01:29:31,450
what was your reaction?

1214
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:36,872
Stunned. I was stunned.
In other words, I couldn't talk.

1215
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:41,293
Finally, I regained my composure,
and I said to him:

1216
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:45,297
"Robbo. Why do we need
a new boss for?

1217
01:29:45,506 --> 01:29:48,842
We've got an honest man,
Sheriff Glick."

1218
01:29:49,635 --> 01:29:51,845
What did he say to that?

1219
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:53,722
You want the exact words?

1220
01:29:53,931 --> 01:29:55,641
The exact words.

1221
01:29:55,808 --> 01:30:01,063
Here's what he said.
"Don't worry about Sheriff Glick...

1222
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:04,316
because I'm going
to fix his wagon."

1223
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:07,277
Next thing I know,
the wagon is fixed.

1224

He did not. But <i>I'll</i> tell you this.

- One, in particular.

Robbo said something

if he wanted protection.

He threatened him.
The sheriff was in fear of his life.
