1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:01,403
<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on Glee.</i>

2
00:00:01,425 --> 00:00:03,446
<i>It's springtime in the longest</i>
<i>year ever at McKinley</i>

3
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:04,606
<i>And it's almost time</i>
<i>for graduation.</i>

4
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,283
<i>Sue's principal</i>
<i>and Becky's her Beckretary,</i>

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,281
<i>Get out, bitch!</i>

6
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:08,386
<i>Which is good</i>
<i>because Becky made it clear</i>

7
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:09,791
<i>She doesn't ever want</i>
<i>to leave McKinley.</i>

8
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,993
<i>Jake cheated on Marley</i>
<i>with demon hellspawn Bree</i>

9
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,451
<i>And he, like,</i>
<i>didn't even say "I'm sorry"</i>

10
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:14,776
<i>Which totally hit Marley</i>
<i>like a ton of bricks</i>

11
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:15,899
<i>That she broke through</i>
<i>with a wrecking ball.</i>

12
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:16,597
<i>Say what?</i>

13
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:18,497
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

14
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:33,490
Hey, Sue, you mind telling me
what's going on around here?

15
00:00:33,523 --> 00:00:34,818
Why, it is the First Annual

16
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,490
McKinley High Career Fair.

17
00:00:36,523 --> 00:00:39,201
Where students come to expose
themselves to the job market

18
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:41,948
and its entry-level
corporate recruiters.

19
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:45,060
Who we hope, in turn,
do not, (chuckles)

20
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:46,969
well, expose themselves
to our students.

21
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:48,461
But Sue, these jobs
are-are terrible.

22
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:49,767
It' not the '90s
anymore, William.

23
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:52,618
When any high-school
dropout could stumble his way

24
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:55,515
into a six-figure salary
as COO of a dotcom startup.

25
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:58,658
Upon graduation,
our students will be entering

26
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,735
the most competitive job market
in recent history.

27
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:02,547
But Sue, the thing
that disturbs me

28
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,042
is I don't see a booth
theater or music or dance.

29
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:07,441
There is nothing here

30
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:08,841
representing a career
in the arts!

31
00:01:08,874 --> 00:01:10,105
Well, that's because there's
no such thing

32
00:01:10,146 --> 00:01:11,381
as a career in the arts.

33
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:14,157
William, I will not encourage
members of this student body

34
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,589
to further endanger their
already uncertain futures

35
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:20,503
in the unrealistic and
narcissistic pursuit of stardom

36
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:22,577
when the very best
they're likely to achieve

37
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,178
is coaching a
high school Glee Club

38
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,877
and marrying a redheaded
googly-eyed homo afarensis

39
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,283
with early-onset-dressing-
like-an-old lady disorder.

40
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:31,816
Not gonna do it.
However, if you would like

41
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:34,317
to set up a stool in between
Salad Artistry

42
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:38,108
and... Fecal Sculpture,

43
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,980
well, you're more than welcome

44
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:41,420
to regale passersby

45
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:43,953
with your inspiring story of how
you dreamt of Broadway stardom

46
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:45,955
and ended up rapping
for high schoolers

47
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:46,957
with a head of hair
that looks just

48
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,267
like Olympia Dukakis's merkin.

49

50
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:55,839
Hey, guys, in spite
of the complete lack

51
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:57,607
of representation
at the Career Fair,

52
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,744
I know that a lot of you
are thinking

53
00:01:58,777 --> 00:02:00,275
about a career in the arts.

54
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:01,885
Well, it's no secret that
Sue Sylvester doesn't believe

55
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:04,298
that an artistic career
is a very practical idea.

56
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:06,565
And, for once,
I have to admit she's right.

57
00:02:06,598 --> 00:02:08,093
It's completely impractical.

58
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,933
You know, anyone pursuing
the arts needs to go in

59
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:11,736
with their eyes wide open.
We're talking

60
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:14,781
zero job security
and impossible odds. But...

61
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:17,612
I've always believed that you
<i>have</i> to pursue what you love.

62
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:18,781
And that's why
this week's assignment

63
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:20,455
is about a goofy-looking
kid who struggled

64
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,321
for years in the music business.

65
00:02:22,354 --> 00:02:24,120
Finally.
It's Marilyn Manson Week.

66
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:25,128
Close.

67
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:26,823
Billy Joel.

68
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,960
- Who?
- Oh, just a musical genius

69
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:31,365
who's sold over 150 million
records worldwide.

70
00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:32,775
WILL:
That's right.

71
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:34,909
Billy had to fight every step
of the way in his career.

72
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:36,509
He had countless failures
and disappointments:

73
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:38,006
writing songs
that nobody wanted,

74
00:02:38,047 --> 00:02:40,420
playing piano in seedy bars
just to pay the rent,

75
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:43,419
being told he'd never make it
because he didn't look "right."

76
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:46,258
Translation: too Jewish.

77
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,994
But he ignored
the haters and he kept

78
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:50,164
pursuing his dream,
becoming the third

79
00:02:50,197 --> 00:02:52,634
best-selling solo artist
of all time.

80
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:53,772
I mean, he is
a true inspiration

81
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:55,610
to anyone pursuing
a career in the arts,

82
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,042
like our very own.

83
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,545
Mr. Blaine Anderson
and Mr. Sam Evans.

84
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:00,978
(cheering and applause) That's right!
All right,

85
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:02,613
as some of you may or may not
know, this week is my big.

86
00:03:02,654 --> 00:03:04,391
NYADA audition.
I know.

87
00:03:04,423 --> 00:03:05,958
It's terrifying.
So I'm leaving today

88
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:08,020
to maybe get some last-minute
tips from Kurt and Rachel.

89
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:09,755
And I'm going with him
because I have an interview

90
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:12,289
with the theater department
at Hunter College.

91
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:13,457
They saw and they loved

92
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,332
my "Tornado of Talent"
impressions reel.

93
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:17,599
And I'm up
for this awesome scholarship,

94
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,136
the Channing Tatum
Former Male Stripper Grant.

95
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,472
But we spoke to Mr. Shue

96
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,609
and, because we have to miss
this week's lesson,

97
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:25,682
he thought the least
we could do is maybe...

98
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:29,552
Kick it off with our very own
take on a classic BJ.

99
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:30,489
Billy... Billy Joel.

100
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:31,826
Hit it.

101
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:35,025

00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:43,822
Hi! Wha... Oh, hi! Oh, my God!
What's going on?

143
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:46,420
Hi! I can't believe you guys are here.
What? You guys are...

144
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:48,291
Oh, my God. You guys are...
Oh, wow! Hi! Mwah.

145
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:51,825
Oh, my God. You guys...
(school bell rings)

146
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:00,234
Hey, Becky.

147
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:02,338
Hi, hot stuff.
Want to suck face

148
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,430
and look at my boobs?

149
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:06,439
No. Um, can I ask you something?

150
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:08,335
What do you plan on doing
after you graduate?

151
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:09,840
Why? What are you gonna do?

152
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:11,712
Film school. I'm going
to college in New York.

153
00:06:11,745 --> 00:06:13,578
Ew. Lame.

154
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:16,388
College is for suckers.

155
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:18,723
I know college might not be
for everybody, but...

156
00:06:18,756 --> 00:06:20,557
you know, Becky,
when I was looking at schools

157
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:21,891
that were good for people
with disabilities,

158
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,061
I learned that a lot of them

159
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:24,861
have programs for
mentally handicapable students.

160
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:27,197
And I'd be happy to help you
do some research.

161
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,668
SUE:
Oh, that won't be necessary.

162
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:32,066
Hey, Becky, will you excuse us

163
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:34,234
for just a sec?
Sure thing, Coach.

164
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:36,905
(quietly):
What exactly are you doing?

165
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,040
I-I just want to make sure
that Becky was aware

166
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:40,302
of what all her options are.

167
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:41,905
She could go to college
and get a job...

168
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:43,916
Well, she has a job.
She's my Beckretary.

169
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:45,654
And here
she will remain indefinitely

170
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:47,517
in a safe and stable
environment,

171
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,683
working alongside someone
who cares very deeply

172
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,352
for her.
I was trying to help.

173
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:53,753
Well, if you really want
to help, Muppet Stephen Hawking,

174
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:55,587
you'll stop inserting yourself
into situations

175
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:56,757
you know nothing about.

176
00:06:57,864 --> 00:06:59,863
(school bell rings)

177
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:04,531
(sighs)

178
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:10,114
I'm sorry.

179
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:11,580
For breaking into my locker?

180
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:13,715
For breaking your trust.
(groans)

181
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:15,186
Marley, wait.

182
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:16,952
Look,

183
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:19,120
I screwed up.
I made a stupid mistake,

184
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:20,623
and I want to make it up
to you.

185
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,087
Please just let me say
I'm sorry.

186
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,254
You shouldn't have to.
You are who you are,

187
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:26,461
and I knew who you were
when I got into this.

188
00:07:26,494 --> 00:07:28,460
It was stupid of me
to try to change you.

189
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:30,060
I did change.
I'm not that guy anymore.

190
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:31,060
You are.

191
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:32,332
You'll always be that guy.

192
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,737
Can I get you guys a refill?
Why are you still working?

193
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,402
Aren't you rehearsing,
like, 24/7?

194
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:46,443
Fanny Brice was a working girl.
My director and I think

195
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:48,443
it's really important
to keep the character

196
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:51,253
as alive and authentic
as possible.

197
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:54,222
So, did you boys like those
historical sites I recommended?

198
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:55,558
Um, we checked out
that deconstructed bathhouse

199
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:56,759
on St. Mark's

200
00:07:56,796 --> 00:07:58,127
where Tennessee Williams
got in that fistfight

201
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,294
- with Tallulah Bankhead.
- Oh, yeah.

202
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:00,390
- That was awesome.
- Cool.

203
00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:02,724
Uh, but it was mostly
campus visits.

204
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:04,491
Um, NYU, Columbia...

205
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:05,699
Why? You're going to NYADA.

206
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:07,196
I-I need safety schools, Kurt.

207
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:08,869
I haven't gotten in yet.
But you will

208
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:10,334
as soon as you audition.

209
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:11,734
The way I've talked you up
to Carmen Tibideaux,

210
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,741
she's gonna offer you

211
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:14,507
a spot on the spot.

212
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,305
Which reminds me,

213
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:17,610
are you up
for a little trial run?

214
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:18,939
I don't want to send you
into the lions' den

215
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,349
under-rehearsed. Come on.

216
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:22,614
Yes. Yes.

217
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:24,118
Come on. Don't worry.

218
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:25,581
The piano awaits.

219
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:27,747
Uh, hello, everyone.

220
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:29,355
Welcome to the Spotlight Diner

221
00:08:29,388 --> 00:08:32,861
and to a very special
performance.

222
00:08:32,894 --> 00:08:34,660
Seriously? You all need
to be stopped.

223
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:36,459
That's enough. (Bell dings) Now,

224
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:39,901
you may not know the name Blaine
Anderson yet, but you will

225
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:42,304
soon when it's lit up
all over Broadway.

226
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:45,639
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
Blaine Anderson.

227
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:48,710
(applause)

228
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:51,448
(playing piano)
Thank you, Kurt.

229
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,280
Thank you, everyone.

230
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:56,288
Sing along if you know it.

00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:00,661
Hey, Becky?

272
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,904
What do you want, a
threesome with Kitty?

273
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:04,167
Um... no.

274
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,197
I was doing some research

275
00:11:06,238 --> 00:11:08,573
about those college programs
I mentioned, and,

276
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:10,101
well, there are lots.

277
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:11,837
Like, over 200,
all over the country.

278
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:13,444
Some of them even
have cheerleading.

279
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:15,476
I can do cheerleading
in college?

280
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,243
You can do anything
you want, Becky.

281
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,779
And I want you to know
that you have choices,

282
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:19,947
and I'm not gonna
give up on you.

283
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,083
I know I have choices.

284

My choices is none
of your business,

285
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:26,327
Artie! I don't want

286
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,591
to go to college, and I don't
want your stupid pamphlets!

Me? Nothing.

291
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:40,135
Well, there has to be something,
because I can't figure out

292
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:41,334
why anybody would screw up
the best thing

293
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,470
in their life the way
you just did.

Marley said it herself.

295
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,740
People know who I am,
and they know what I do.

296
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:49,908
You get involved at your own risk.
Hey!

297
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:51,612
I can't believe
you could be so stupid.

298
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,244
What do you want from me, Ryder?

299
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:54,525
We spend every day in that room

300
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:55,918
telling each other to
embrace who we are.

301
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:58,457
Do you want me
to be different? To not be me?

gonna happen.

I see your grades have improved

334
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:14,059
over the past couple
of semesters.

335
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,239
Yeah, I kind of had an, um...
a breakthrough a few months ago,

336
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:21,513
'cause I'm-I'm not, like, a...
a good student, but I realize

337
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:23,812
that what I'm really good at
is impressions,

338
00:14:23,852 --> 00:14:25,886
so, I started
to do this impression

339
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,495
of a good high school student,
and it... it's kind of working.

340
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:32,594
Okay.

341
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:35,165
Tell me why
you want to go to Hunter.

342
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:37,144
Um, I-I don't know
that much about it,

343
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,110
except that there... well,
there's more women than guys,

344
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:40,706
and that's...
that's great for me,

345
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,736
because I'm totally
into feminist issues.

346
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:44,705
Like, just because
women don't make

347
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:47,211
as much as guys do
to do the same job,

348
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:48,615
it's totally not cool

349
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:50,720
that they aren't given
the same amount of respect.

350
00:14:50,753 --> 00:14:52,224
And, like, why can't...?

351
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:55,023
Well, why can guys go shirtless
at the beach, but chicks can't?

352
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:56,759
Oh.

353
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,464
Sorry. Uh... <i>girls</i> can't.

354
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,861
I guess even I have a lot
to learn still.

355
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:04,902
I'm also super jazzed

Yeah.

I mean, I don't...
I don't hate it.

374
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm just...
I'm not good at it.

I was a kid I've seen
these United Negro College Fund

377
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,811
commercials, and it's, like,
if you don't go to college,

378
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,082
you're letting
your whole family down,

379
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:47,346
or you're destined for a life

380
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,650
of eating out
of Dumpsters or something.

381
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:50,885
I don't know. So...
please don't judge me.

382
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,326
Look, in life, it's not about
knowing what you want.

383
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,623
It's about knowing what
you can cross off your list

384
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:54,758
that you don't want.

385
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,293
But I do know what I want to do.

386
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:58,724
I mean, it's been my dream
since I was a kid.

my way of telling you that

447
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:30,002
you need to be honest with me,
and honest with yourself.

448
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,941
I think you want to go
to college, but you're scared.

449
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:36,076
And that's okay.
I'm scared, too.

450
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,475
I'm terrified
of the whole thing.

451
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:39,211
But the only way for us to grow

452
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,348
is to face our fears
and move forward.

453
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:45,086
Am I right?
Do you want to go to college?

454
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,251
What if I go, and
everybody makes fun of me again?

455
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:50,983
What if everybody
calls me stupid

456
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:52,455
like they always used to?

457
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:53,729
They won't, because you'll have

458
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:55,027
all these awesome professors

459
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,462
and counselors and new friends
that'll have your back.

460
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:58,862
And all your old friends will

461
00:19:58,903 --> 00:20:00,397
have your back, too.
Like me.

462
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,163
Are you really my friend?

463
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:04,972
Always.

just hurt and angry

467
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,514
and embarrassed, because
he turned out to be exactly

468
00:20:21,547 --> 00:20:24,006
what everyone said he was.

469
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:26,730
And then, I was, like,
"Okay, fine, it's over."

470
00:20:26,771 --> 00:20:29,540
But then, he's putting
flowers in my locker,

471
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:31,340
and then, he's
singing "My Life"

472
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:33,244
in Glee Club, like
he's the victim.

473
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:35,613
Mm. It's just all so schizo.

474
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:37,878
And the worst part is,
I still miss him.

475
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,454
Oh, of course you do.

476
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:41,486
And I hate it so much!

477
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,885
Yeah.
(sighs)

478
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:45,895
Oh.

479
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:47,560
I'm just glad we
didn't end up...

480
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:49,866
Doin' the humpty-hump?

481
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:51,667
- Ooh.
- Mom.

482
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,336
(laughs) Mom!

483
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:56,233
(laughing): Oh, my God,
I'm scarred for life.

484
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:57,441
Oh, Marley.

485
00:20:57,474 --> 00:20:59,274
(laughing)

486
00:20:59,307 --> 00:21:00,907
You know, when I was your age,

487
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:02,646
I was... I was like
a bad-boy magnet.

488
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,519
Ooh! How do you think
I met your dad?

489
00:21:04,552 --> 00:21:05,686
Mm.

490
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:08,758
So, I know why you loved Jake.

491
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,925
You know, but I am glad
that you waited

492
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:13,122
and dodged that bullet.

493
00:21:15,227 --> 00:21:17,626
You know, your first time
is something

494
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:19,396
that you can never
get back, honey.

495
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,172
You need to hold out
for a good guy this time.

496
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:27,838
You know, not just one
you have feelings for, but

497
00:21:27,878 --> 00:21:29,743
someone you can trust.

498
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:32,016
You know?

499
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:33,648
Mmm.

500
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:36,154
Okay, Sam Evans,
this is Barbara Brownfield.

501
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:38,187
She's our amazing photographer
at <i>Funny Girl.</i>

502
00:21:38,221 --> 00:21:39,628
This is Sam Evans,

503
00:21:39,661 --> 00:21:42,320
my insanely handsome
soon-to-be-supermodel friend.

504
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,189
I'm not gonna lie. I'm really,
really, really nervous. Uh,

505
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,725
I've been pitting out all
my T-shirts. Um, it's just like

506
00:21:47,758 --> 00:21:49,431
my entire future is
in your hands.

507
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:52,032
You know, just try to hide
all my bad angles.

508
00:21:52,065 --> 00:21:53,302
What bad angles?

509
00:21:53,335 --> 00:21:55,037
(laughs)

510
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:56,005
Excellent.

511
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:57,470
I love what you're doing. Yep.

512
00:21:57,503 --> 00:21:58,838
(quietly):
I'm feeling it.

513
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:00,805
(shutter clicking) We got it.

514
00:22:00,838 --> 00:22:02,045
Great.

515
00:22:02,078 --> 00:22:03,340
You're waiting for the bus.

516
00:22:03,373 --> 00:22:05,338
Look for the bus.
Oh, I love that.

517
00:22:05,379 --> 00:22:07,808
Hey, want a piece of this?
Come on. How about

518
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:10,373
you're so hot that you had
to take some clothes off?

519
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:11,844
Okay, strip it off.

520
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:12,843
Come on, Sam.

521
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:14,348
Yes!

522
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:16,247
Okay, let me just put

523
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,056
a little bit of
this oil on you.

524
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:19,520
Looking great.

525
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:22,393
Okay.

526
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:24,329
BARBARA:
Flex, like... (grunts)

527
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:25,561
Excellent.

528
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,032
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

529
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:28,528
BARBARA:
There you go.

530
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:30,568
Super. Thank you.

531
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:31,936
<i>We got it.</i>

532
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:35,439
Artie Abrams...

533
00:22:35,472 --> 00:22:37,574
(over speaker):
wheel your butt

534
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,145
into my office, now.

535
00:22:40,178 --> 00:22:42,442
♪

536
00:22:56,464 --> 00:22:59,433
I went to my pharmacy
and took the liberty

537
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:02,445
of purchasing you a good
old-fashioned ear douche,

538
00:23:02,478 --> 00:23:05,045
because you obviously
didn't hear me

539
00:23:05,078 --> 00:23:07,211
when I distinctly told you,

540
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:10,516
with perfect diction
and great clarity,

541
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:12,854
to stop meddling in the affairs

542
00:23:12,887 --> 00:23:15,898
of one Becky Jackson.

543
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:18,636
(pants)

544
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:20,437
Principal Sylvester,
Becky told me herself

545
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,006
she wants to go to college,

546
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,942
and there's no reason
why she can't.

547
00:23:23,976 --> 00:23:25,511
How dare you lecture me.

548
00:23:25,544 --> 00:23:26,975
You don't think I know that?

549
00:23:27,016 --> 00:23:29,648
You don't think I've contacted
each and every school

550
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:32,252
and quizzed them endlessly
about their programs?

551
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:34,095
Then why aren't you helping her?

552
00:23:34,128 --> 00:23:36,560
Because she's not ready.
Or maybe you're not ready.

553
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:39,462
I know you love Becky like a daughter,
and you want to protect her,

554
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:41,566
and I get it, because of
everything you've been through.

555
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,303
But you have to let her go.

556
00:23:43,336 --> 00:23:45,871
There's a really good program
for students with Down syndrome

557
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:48,442
at the University of Cincinnati,
and I'm gonna take her there

558
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:51,050
for a tour. Her parents
already gave me permission.

559
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,714
It's only two hours from here, and
it'd be really easy to visit.

560
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:56,618
Mr. Abrams.

561
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,324
Ask tough questions.

562
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,662
Is there Wi-Fi
on campus?

563
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:05,670
Do all freshman gain 20 pounds
from cafeteria food?

564
00:24:05,703 --> 00:24:08,040
I want a full report
when you come back.

565
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,937
(school bell ringing)

566
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:12,980
Go out with me.

567
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:14,814
Ryder... no.

568
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:17,085
Look, I'm single, you're
newly single... why not?

569
00:24:17,118 --> 00:24:19,317
I have good family values.
I-I-I go to church.

570
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,189
I've never been arrested.
I'm not ugly.

571
00:24:21,222 --> 00:24:23,693
Now that I can read,
I get good grades, and...

572
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:25,957
I've always thought you
were the most amazing girl

573
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,597
in the history of the world.

574
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,429
That's...

575
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:31,429
really sweet.

576
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,405
I just don't think
I want to date anyone right now.

577
00:24:34,438 --> 00:24:36,302
What happened with Jake
was really painful,

578
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:39,172
and I need
a little break from men.

579
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:42,244
(sighs) Look, I'm a really,
really good guy, Marley.

580
00:24:42,277 --> 00:24:43,675
I would never hurt you.

581
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:46,413
All I need is a chance,
and I swear I would

582
00:24:46,446 --> 00:24:49,549
never, ever do to
you what he did.

583
00:24:49,582 --> 00:24:51,757

Marley, will you go out with me?

615
00:27:00,127 --> 00:27:02,093
(sighs)

616
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:03,557
Yes.

617
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:16,262
Carmen Tibideaux is a classicist,
so for your audition,

618
00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:18,263
let's try to avoid
shocking patterns,

619
00:27:18,296 --> 00:27:19,936
and anything that says,
"Look at me,

620
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:22,643
I'm the center of attention, and
this primary color proves it."

621
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:24,538
Uh, Kurt... wait.

622
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:25,576
Just stop.

623
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:27,377
I have to tell you something.

624
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,975
Oh, no.
You've got that look.

625
00:27:30,008 --> 00:27:32,246
That look I saw
the night after callbacks.

626
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,510
If you cheated on me again,

627
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,478
I will not accept
sex addiction as an excuse.

628
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,255
I... don't want to
audition for NYADA.

629
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:42,255
- Well, you can't get in on reputation alone.
- No, NYADA is

630
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:44,768
just a performing arts school...
that's all you can study there.

631
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:46,628
I have other passions,
other... interests

632
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:48,492
I might want to
explore in college.

633
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:50,661
- For instance? - I don't know.
You know how much

634
00:27:50,694 --> 00:27:53,429
I love kids, and I'd love to be
a teacher like Mr. Shue, or...

635
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,733
or premed or something.

636
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:57,069
Of course. How could I forget
the numerous conversations

637
00:27:57,102 --> 00:27:59,942
- we've had about you wanting
to be a doctor. - My passion

638
00:27:59,975 --> 00:28:01,975
for medicine has always
been my secret shame.

639
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:04,513
My first guy crush
was... George Clooney,

640
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:06,756
aka Dr. Ross, on <i>ER.</i>

641
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:09,450
And it's no secret what my
favorite Milton Bradley game is.

642
00:28:09,491 --> 00:28:11,922
Here goes his funny bone.

643
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:14,090
(buzz) (quietly): Dang.

644
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:17,329
It's a great relief to be
able to tell you this now.

645
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,996
I'm just glad I did it
before my audition.

646
00:28:20,037 --> 00:28:21,237
What?

647
00:28:22,374 --> 00:28:24,404
We're getting married.

648
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:25,404
I know you,

649
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,837
and I get it, and this is

650
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:30,475
a sweet side of you that
I don't get to see very often.

651
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,544
You're scared.

652
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,943
Of what? Look, when
I first moved here,

653
00:28:34,977 --> 00:28:37,312
I-I honestly felt like
I was Crocodile Dundee.

654
00:28:37,345 --> 00:28:39,816
Right, the city's huge,
the buildings are huge.

655
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:42,050
And everywhere you look, it's, like,
there's all these beautiful people

656
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:44,051
who seem to have just come
from some secret meeting

657
00:28:44,061 --> 00:28:46,325
where they teach you how
to make it in the big city.

658
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:49,027
What if I don't get in?
<i>You</i> didn't.

659
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,830
You will. And if you
don't, it won't matter.

660
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:54,706
You're a performer; you're
gonna find the spotlight.

661
00:28:54,739 --> 00:28:56,677
And you can't shy away
from your greatness

662
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,581
just because you're afraid
you're not great enough.

663
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:00,887
You have a gift,
and it wouldn't be right

664
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,825
to let you hide that away.

665
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:05,196
Thanks for knowing me.

666
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:06,935
I love you.

667
00:29:06,968 --> 00:29:09,272
I love you, too.

668
00:29:10,737 --> 00:29:13,345
And we're in this together.

669
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,612
I can't stop you
from failing, but...

670
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:19,055
I can promise to make it
safe if you do.

671
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:21,024
And I think Santana
should do your makeup.

672
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:28,402
WOMAN:
Becky, our goal here

673
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,802
at the University of Cincinnati

674
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,202
is to make college life

675
00:29:31,235 --> 00:29:33,735
as inclusive as possible.

676
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:37,608
This is one of our
independent living classes.

677
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:39,943
Students are working
on bill paying

678
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:42,573
and budgeting their money.

679
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:44,709
Everybody, this
is Becky Jackson.

680
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,107
She's thinking of coming here.

681
00:29:46,148 --> 00:29:48,745
BOY:
Don't. This place sucks.

682
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:51,482
Just kidding.
I love it here.

683
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:53,685
(laughter) Whoo!

684
00:29:55,487 --> 00:29:56,826
Is that your boyfriend?

685
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:59,930
Artie? Hell, no.
He's got herpes.

686
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:00,802
Ew.

687
00:30:00,835 --> 00:30:02,067
Just for the record,

688
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,902
I don't have herpes.

689
00:30:03,943 --> 00:30:05,745
Becky, I think

690
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:07,849
you're very funny,
and very pretty.

691
00:30:07,882 --> 00:30:10,016
Tell me something I <i>don't</i> know.

692
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:11,310
Oh, snap.

693
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,445
(laughter)

694
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,146
TEACHER:
Becky, would you like

695
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,980
to stay and watch the class for a while?
BOY: Yeah.

696
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:20,418
You can sit next to me.

697
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:23,091
Okay.

698
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:24,956
Whatever.

699
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,683
So, how is your name
pronounced again?

700
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:41,979
Because I heard
it was "Bee-shay,"

701
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,755
but now that
I see it spelled out,

702
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:45,355
it looks like it should be
"Bitch-ette."

703
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:46,754
Like a little mini bitch.

704
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:48,690
Is that what your name
means in French,

705
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:49,891
or Italian,

706
00:30:49,924 --> 00:30:51,124
whatever it is?

707
00:30:51,157 --> 00:30:52,893
I'm... I tend to talk too much.

708
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,100
I'm used to dealing with boys
far prettier

709
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:56,963
and considerably stupider
than you.

710
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:58,803
Oh, cool. Look, I
agreed to meet with you

711
00:30:58,836 --> 00:31:00,235
because I trust Barb
Brownfield's eye.

712
00:31:00,268 --> 00:31:03,911
And I must admit,
I do respond to your look.

713
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:07,680
Your Midwestern eyes
have the vacant stare

714
00:31:07,713 --> 00:31:08,953
of a cow's.

715
00:31:08,986 --> 00:31:11,128
I don't have any of those
on my roster.

716
00:31:11,156 --> 00:31:12,821
And you have a unique mouth.

717
00:31:12,861 --> 00:31:14,156
It's, like, your lips,

718
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:17,088
they're kind of like...

719
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:18,159
Trouty.

720
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:19,526
Yes! That's it.

721
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,861
Trouty mouth.

722
00:31:20,894 --> 00:31:22,664
Can I have, uh, one of these...

723
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:23,832
No.

724
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:25,464
So, this is how this works.

725
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:26,697
These pictures...

726
00:31:26,738 --> 00:31:28,370
- Mm-hmm.
- They're nice.

727
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:29,772
But you need better.

728
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,844
And you are gonna pay
for those yourself.

729
00:31:31,877 --> 00:31:33,507
Wait, so are you saying
you're gonna

730
00:31:33,548 --> 00:31:35,274
sign me? Because
if you do, I swear,

731
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:36,944
I won't let you down.
I have been working, like,

732
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:40,248
- my entire life on different poses...
- Oh, slow down, Midnight Cowboy.

733
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:42,553
Look, this is how
male modeling works.

734
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:44,154
Most of what you'll get
will be runway,

735
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:45,707
and you're not
gonna get paid for that,

736
00:31:45,725 --> 00:31:47,628
but hopefully, they'll let you
keep some of the clothes.

737
00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:50,693
Now, <i>if</i> you book
print work, chances are

738
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:52,765
you'll be a shirtless pawn,
there to enhance

739
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,468
the <i>real</i> gem of the shoot...
the girl.

740
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:57,207
You'll be paid enough
to live in the city,

741
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,472
with roommates.

742
00:31:58,505 --> 00:31:59,639
This is not glamorous.

743
00:31:59,672 --> 00:32:01,574
This is not
what you think it is.

744
00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:03,078
You are one of

745
00:32:03,111 --> 00:32:05,310
10,000 beautiful boys
here in New York City,

746
00:32:05,343 --> 00:32:07,214
and the word that you will hear

747
00:32:07,247 --> 00:32:09,551
more than any other
during your brief

748
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:10,921
career...

749
00:32:10,954 --> 00:32:13,628
will be... "no."

750
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:15,325
Well, you know, like,
dreams aren't easy,

751
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:18,228
and, I mean, I come from a place
where even the idea of sitting

752
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,930
in this room with you
would seem impossible.

753
00:32:20,963 --> 00:32:22,836
I mean, I know who I am, and...

754
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:24,710
I know where I'm
headed in life.

755
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,974
I can take a few no's
along the way.

756
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:28,907
I do like you, Trouty Mouth.

757
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,180
(giggles)
Well, this is awesome.

758
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:31,812
Okay, this is so awesome.
I'll get those,

759
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:34,681
- uh, pictures taken right away.
- Uh, no, no, no, you won't.

760
00:32:34,714 --> 00:32:36,482
You're gonna have to
wait at least a week.

761
00:32:36,515 --> 00:32:38,749
- You got to lose ten pounds.
- Well, ten pounds doesn't really

762
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,990
seem healthy to me...
you think I'm... fat?

763
00:32:41,023 --> 00:32:42,021
Not for Kansas.

764
00:32:42,055 --> 00:32:43,859
- Ohio.
- Look, you are

765
00:32:43,892 --> 00:32:45,825
in the big time now, cowboy.

766
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:49,027
The camera likes... starvation.

767
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:54,266
We don't have room for this.

768
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,874
Uh, yes, we do. Right there.

769
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,074
Okay, seriously,
I'm not gonna be able to survive

770
00:32:58,107 --> 00:32:59,808
if you and your Hag
Berry are gonna be

771
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:02,272
tickling those ivories,
belting out gay hits

772
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,441
from <i>Rent</i> and <i>Showboat</i> all day.

773
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,114
It's a thank you

774
00:33:05,147 --> 00:33:07,715
for allowing me and Sam
to stay here.

775
00:33:07,748 --> 00:33:10,321
- Hey, you guys, I have some bread
here if you want. - No can do.

776
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:14,258
No, right now I'm just on this
Mentos and flavored air diet.

777
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:17,095
Sam, that's ridiculous. You
don't need to lose ten pounds.

778
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,399
Yeah, Sam, we all agree.

779
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:20,270
You don't need to be prison-camp
skinny to be a model.

780
00:33:20,303 --> 00:33:22,733
- I think you should find
another agency. - No,

781
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:24,867
House of Bichette is, like,
the best agency in town.

782
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,202
You know what I think?
I think that this argument

783
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:29,445
would be best made in a song.

784
00:33:29,478 --> 00:33:31,014
Yes. SANTANA: Oh, no.

785
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:32,614
No, no, no, no, no.

786
00:33:32,647 --> 00:33:34,413
Do you see this?
This is what's going

787
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,443
to happen from every argument

788
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:38,114
or discussion or meal
from now on.

789
00:33:38,147 --> 00:33:40,147
It's gonna end
in a freaking sing-along.

790
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:42,487
It's bad enough we need
to be singing waiters, okay?

791
00:33:42,528 --> 00:33:44,689
I can't have this in my home.
I need my peaceful place.

792
00:33:44,695 --> 00:33:46,659
You don't have to sing, Santana. (Billy
Joel's "Just the Way You Are" begins)

793
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,196

Good night, Coach.

837
00:36:34,705 --> 00:36:36,177
That's it?

838
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,680
Don't let the bed bugs bite?

839
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:41,280
You've been sitting out there
all day long

840
00:36:41,313 --> 00:36:42,745
with little dream bubbles

841
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:44,652
floating over your head

842
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:45,925
and not once
have you come in here

843
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:48,423
to tell me how your trip
to college went.

844
00:36:48,463 --> 00:36:51,358
I don't want to hurt
your feelings, Coach.

845
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:52,526
I don't have

846
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:54,029
any feelings, Becky.

847
00:36:54,062 --> 00:36:55,533
It was okay, I guess.

848
00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:57,531
I don't have to take math.

849
00:36:57,564 --> 00:36:59,699
Someone takes notes for me.

850
00:36:59,732 --> 00:37:01,937
I can learn photography.

851
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,936
Well, that sounds better
than okay to me.

852
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:05,472
To tell you the truth,

853
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:07,411
it was awesome.

854
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:10,782
(clicks tongue) Are you sure
you're ready for this, honey?

855
00:37:10,815 --> 00:37:12,980
I never thought to say this.

856
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:17,249
I've outgrown
these... high school bitches.

857
00:37:17,282 --> 00:37:19,052
Mmm.

858
00:37:19,085 --> 00:37:21,727
You're not sad, are you, Coach?

859
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,728
I'm sad to be losing
the best damn secretary

860
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:26,797
since the pre-collagen injected
Melanie Griffith

861
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,627
in <i>Working Girl.</i>

862
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,035
(sighs)

863
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:32,269
But I'm more proud
than I am sad.

864
00:37:32,302 --> 00:37:34,239
Think I can help you

865
00:37:34,272 --> 00:37:36,072
write your application essay?

866
00:37:36,113 --> 00:37:37,776
Sure, Coach.

867
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:39,941
Let's see what you got there.

868
00:37:39,975 --> 00:37:42,614
(sighs)

869
00:37:42,647 --> 00:37:45,119
Okay, well, you can't say that.

870
00:37:45,152 --> 00:37:46,456
And you can't say that.

871
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:48,457
I can't say "crap" or "douche"?

872
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,486
Even if you're talking
about Graydon Carter.

873
00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:56,626
(school bell rings)
(clears throat)

874
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,232
Check your Instagram.

875
00:37:58,265 --> 00:38:00,262
O... kay.

876
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:08,307
(chuckles)

877
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,840
When did you do all that?

878
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:11,777
Uh, last night.
After I dropped you off.

879
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,513
I kind of couldn't stop
thinking about you.

880
00:38:13,546 --> 00:38:14,977
Oh...

881
00:38:15,018 --> 00:38:16,849
Look, I don't want to freak
you out and move too fast

882
00:38:16,882 --> 00:38:18,783
or anything, but I'd
love to do it again.

883
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:20,046
Like, maybe tonight?

884
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:24,052
So, you guys are, like,
really a thing now?

885
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:25,253
Yeah?

886
00:38:25,285 --> 00:38:27,691
It's, uh, none
of your business anymore.

887
00:38:31,423 --> 00:38:32,287
Cool.

888
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,856
Well,

889
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:35,625
congratulations.

890
00:38:35,658 --> 00:38:36,866
Duty calls.

891
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,802
Okay, if I'm going
to be honest here,

892
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:43,305
just because we go out once
doesn't mean that we're...

893
00:38:43,339 --> 00:38:44,907
going out.

894
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,372
Oh.

895
00:38:46,405 --> 00:38:48,076
I still just need time for me.

896
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:49,446
Sure.

897
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,208
Are we done, Coach?

898
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,848
Oh, not quite yet, Becky.

899
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:57,785
We're gonna drench this
whole thing in glitter and hoist

900
00:38:57,818 --> 00:38:59,354
three dozen rainbow flags.

901
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:01,290
Got it, Coach. Go Bearcats!

902
00:39:01,323 --> 00:39:02,687
Go Bearcats.

903
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,422
So you finally came around.

904
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:05,916
What made you see the light?

905
00:39:05,957 --> 00:39:08,086
Well, Butt Chin, in the words
of Civil Rights leader.

906
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:10,560
Genghis Khan,
everyone deserves a shot

907
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:13,159
at their dreams, and
I suppose that includes

908
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,333
your hopelessly
misguided teen hobgoblins.

909
00:39:16,366 --> 00:39:19,034
Now, don't forget to remind them
about the myriad

910
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:22,373
of show business legends born
and bred right here in Lima.

911
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:24,110
And that would be
a total of one,

912
00:39:24,143 --> 00:39:26,037
Ms. Phyllis Diller.

913
00:39:26,078 --> 00:39:29,075
You know, in a few decades,
when the New Directions are all

914
00:39:29,108 --> 00:39:31,275
on unemployment
and sexually pleasing

915
00:39:31,308 --> 00:39:34,014
some horny old casting assistant
just so they can be extras

916
00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:36,150
on season 33
of <i>The Bachelorette,</i>

917
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:39,484
they'll look back on this
time and remember you fondly.

918
00:39:39,517 --> 00:39:40,853
TINA: That's not
true, Sue Sylvester!

919
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:42,357
One day, we're gonna be
big, big stars.

920
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:45,029
SUE: Well, of course
you are, my dear.

921
00:39:45,062 --> 00:39:46,029
Isn't that right, William?

922
00:39:46,062 --> 00:39:46,997
Blam!

923
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,534
They're back! ARTIE: Yo, dawgs,

924
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:50,030
tell us everything. SAM: Fact:

925
00:39:50,063 --> 00:39:51,535
Blaine thought he wanted
to be a doctor for a minute

926
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:53,010
and then Kurt talked him
out of it

927
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:54,844
and then he went to NYADA and
he crushed his NYADA audition.

928
00:39:54,877 --> 00:39:56,012
Sam, that was my news.

929
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:57,412
Oh, and, uh, Mr. Shue,
did you know

930
00:39:57,445 --> 00:39:59,148
that Billy Joel never went
to college?

931
00:39:59,181 --> 00:40:01,250
Fact: he didn't, and I
think you forgot to tell us

932
00:40:01,283 --> 00:40:03,419
about that. So I'm gonna
skip college, too,

933
00:40:03,452 --> 00:40:05,958
- and become a male model.
- Impossible. You're too fat.

934
00:40:05,991 --> 00:40:08,023
No, I'm not. And I don't care
what you or Ms. Bichette

935
00:40:08,063 --> 00:40:09,263
or anyone says.

936
00:40:09,296 --> 00:40:11,296
I like me just the way I am,
and I'm not gonna

937
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:12,867
- change for anyone.
- Well, that is

938
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,804
just the screw-you spirit
employers love.

939
00:40:15,837 --> 00:40:18,972
Honest to God,
I cannot imagine what goes on

940
00:40:19,013 --> 00:40:21,983
in your lumpish,
sexually ambiguous heads.

941
