Not really. No.

Before we go again...

550
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:52,011
girls, when I met you,

551
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:54,298
you were doing your whole
country and western thing

552
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:56,135
and that's fine - we all make
mistakes.

553
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,459
But here's where we learn
from that mistake.

554
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:03,338
Country and western music is
about loss.

555
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:06,302
Soul music is also about loss.

556
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:09,170
But the difference is,
in country and western music,

557
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:13,422
they've lost, they've given up and they're
just at home whining about it.

558
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,169
In soul music,

559
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:16,760
they're struggling to get it back

560
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:18,343
and they haven't given up,

561
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,881
so every note
that passes through your lips

562
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,549
should have the tone of a woman
who's grasping and fighting

563
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:26,295
and desperate to retrieve
what's been taken from her.

564
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:28,260
You understand?

565
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:31,675
Now, what it is that you're
searching for, that's up to you.

I'm just here to get you there,

1108
01:01:57,208 --> 01:02:00,007
<i>- Run!
- ( SCREAMING)</i>

1109
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:01,342
GO, go!

1110
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:03,927
- Come on! Now!
- Get the kids away!

1111
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,094
Mum and Dad screaming at us.

1112
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:10,677
"Kids, get across the river!“"

1113
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:14,302
I don't get it. What did they want'?

1114
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:16,294
The children.

1115
01:02:17,417 --> 01:02:20,751
It's my responsibility, Dave,
to look after the little ones

1116
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:22,218
because I'm the oldest.

1117
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:23,710
Hurry UP!

1118
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,677
I'm not to let them out of my sight,
especially not Kay.

1119
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:28,009
Why Kay'?

1120
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,798
If you're fair like Kay,

1121
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:33,386
them fellas reckon
she could pass for white.

1122
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,797
- Get out of the way!
- Leave them kids alone!

1123
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,419
Take her from her family,

1124
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:38,965
put her in an institution,
teach her white ways.

1125
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:42,344
Pretty soon, there'll be no
black fellas left to worry about.

1126
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,256
- (COUGHS)
- Kay.

1127
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:46,969
And then, um, Kay got sick.

1128
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,797
I mean real sick.

1129
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:56,131
We're scared it's pneumonia
so we take her to town, to hospital...

1130
01:02:58,583 --> 01:03:03,293
and... and that's when we find out
them government fellas have been back.

1131
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:04,760
Where's Kay'?

1132
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:07,094
They've taken Kay from the hospital bed.

1133
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:10,052
You've got to speak to me!
Say something to me!

1134
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:12,010
Where's my baby little girl?

1135
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:14,924
Where's Kay gone? Kay!

1136
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:17,761
Where are you, baby girl?

1137
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:20,835
- Speak to me!
- GAIL: "Kay."

1138
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:22,505
Say something to me!

1139
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:23,626
GAIL: "Where are you, Kay?"

1140
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,377
No, I won't stop!

1141
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,877
GAIL: "Where's my girl?"

1142
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,718
Where's Kay gone?!

1143
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:33,132
You know, we didn't see Kay
till her mum died.

1144
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,548
They let her come home for the
funeral.

1145
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:38,385
And all she could say
in all that time...

1146
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,753
If you people worked
as much as you fished,

1147
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:43,219
you'd be really rich, you know?

1148
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:47,588
And I've never been able to forgive
her, or myself.

1149
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:00,343
We should dance.

1150
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:03,419
What?

1151
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,760
It's a good time to dance.

1152
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:08,798
Uh, nuh.

1153
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:10,169
Come on.

1154
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:11,509
I'll show you how to
shake your moom.

1155
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:14,465
Yeah-no, I've seen you shake your
moom. It's not pretty.

1156
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:15,459
(CHUCKLES)

1157
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:19,087
I'm gonna teach you
the Lovelace Lanky Leg Shuffle.

1158
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,255
No.

1159
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:21,592
If I start dancing like you,

1160
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:23,426
the brothers there
might think I'm a gubba.

1161
01:04:23,542 --> 01:04:26,091
Oh, I see. You're saying because
I'm white, I can't dance. Is that it'?

1162
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:28,836
- Yep.
- Well, that's just racist.

1163
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:30,585
You're a racist.

1164
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:32,176
You should know better.

1165
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:35,468
Come on.

1166
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,752
Just watch and learn.
Don't be afraid.

1167
01:04:40,417 --> 01:04:41,885
It's all about the shoulders.

1168
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:47,005
They don't belong to me,
they belong to the music in my head.

1169
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:50,127
(BOTH LAUGH)

1170
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,672
<i>- Nuh.
- Deadly.</i>

1171
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:55,672
When we use that word, 'deadly',
it usually means something's good.

1172
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,044
Ooh.

1173
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:04,968
You know, Gail,
there's a funny thing about you.

1174
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,381
Everybody thinks
that you're just this...

1175
01:05:08,542 --> 01:05:10,920
this mouth on legs...

1176
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:14,751
this defensive,
argumentative old witch.

1177
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:16,468
Stick with me.

1178
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:21,419
There's a reason
that you're this... terrible mouth,

1179
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,920
and it's very simple.

1180
01:05:27,042 --> 01:05:28,589
You're mama bear...

1181
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:32,510
and they're your little baby cubs.

1182
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:43,302
- You been drinking?
- (LAUGHS)

1183
01:05:43,417 --> 01:05:45,010
No.

1184
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:48,925
Oh.

1185
01:05:49,042 --> 01:05:51,386
Come on, then,
you silver-tongued wannabe.

1186
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,210
I'll dance with ya.

1187
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:01,089
Let me lead.

1188
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:02,926
For once.

1189
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:16,918

Huh?

01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,127
Me and the guys
will be leaving you folks today.

1234
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,672
I just have to say
it's been a real pleasure.

1235
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:55,544
What? You're leaving us here'?
On our own'?

1236
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:58,841
- Not if I had my way, ma'am.
- How do we get to our next gig'?

1237
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:00,505
I...

1238
01:09:03,042 --> 01:09:04,385
Sorry, ma'am. I thought you knew.

1239
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,594
The military's approved the use
of a vehicle for you.

1240
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:10,960
In that?

1241
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,801
What about the band?

1242
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:16,378
Ma'am, I understand your band
is being pulled out also.

1243
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:21,630
Dave?

1244
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:30,508
Myron, hi. Listen, it's Dave.
What's happening, bro?

1245
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,753
They've taken away our military
escort and our backing band.

1246
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:34,343
I can't accept that.

1247
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:36,210
Dave, we've already talked about this.

1248
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:38,301
Wait. When?

1249
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:40,795
Last week on the phone.

1250
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:43,966
Don't screw this up on me!
Do you hear me?

1251
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:46,177
Now, a colleague of mine,
Lou McGary,

1252
01:09:46,292 --> 01:09:47,544
is touring from the States.

1253
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:50,716
Some big names.
He wants to hear Julie sing.

1254
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:53,131
Man, I think we got us a star
in the making here.

1255
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:55,127
- What's so special about Julie?
- Shh!

1256
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:56,752
You need to get yourselves
to Nha Trang.

1257
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:58,718
I'm gonna get Lou on a military
flight.

1258
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:00,710
We got to get Julie
in front of this guy.

1259
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:04,463
Myron, explain to me how we're gonna
gig without Hendo and the band.

1260
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,005
- Where's Hendo and the band'?
- Shh!

1261
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:08,548
Man, forget about them, man.
They're out of the picture.

1262
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:11,750
We got a 10-piece in Nha Trang
that's nothing but class, baby.

1263
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:13,969
No, wait, wait... Myron, wait.

1264
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:16,632
If you want the breaks,

I wanted in my life.

with, and often against.

I knew it.

because I couldn't tell you.

All I know is,

1430
