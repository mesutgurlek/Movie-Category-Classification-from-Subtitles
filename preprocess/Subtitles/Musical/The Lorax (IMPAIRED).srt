Did you chop down this tree?

Uh... No.

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,606
I think he did it.

you just didn't see me

magically appear
out of that stump?

With all the lightning
and thunder and stuff.

345

You didn't see any of that?

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,765
No, but that sounds amazing.
Can I see some of that?

347
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,720
Uh, yeah, I could show you.
But that's not how it works.

Okay. Um...

Didn't really happen.

Oh, I know what you want!

What? No!

364

I would never hit this little guy.
You, on the other hand,

I would gladly pound you

and your mustache
into the ground!

to his warning.

become interested in trees.

Teddy, there's not much
that goes on in Thneedville

that I don't know about.

459
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,486
Here's the deal, I make a living
selling fresh air to people.

460
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,086
Trees?
They make it for free.

461
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,891
So, when I hear
people talking about them,

462
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,328
I consider it kind of
a threat to my business.

463
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,088
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

464
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,123
You listen to me, boy.

465
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,642
Don't go poking around in
things you don't understand

466
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,802
or I'll be your
worst nightmare.

on a spider's body!

Yeah, um...

469
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,843
Okay, my mom is expecting me.
So, I'm just going to...

470
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,565
Of course, of course. Now, go
back to your family game time.

Please. I have
eyes everywhere.

474
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,961
Huh!

475
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,407
You got a beautiful
town here, Ted.

476
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,848
Lots of fun stuff to occupy
your short attention span.

477
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,003
Why, I can't
think of any reason

478
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,688
you would ever want to
go outside of town again.

479
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,807
Ever.

480
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,290

Look out!

484
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,122
Hey, man? You know, you need
to change that door bell.

485
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,842
Oh, you missed me.
What?

486
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,131
You're already back. Clearly,
you missed me a little. Right?

487
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,007
No, I didn't. I'm just here
to hear the end of the story.

488
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,730
Why are you so interested

00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,211
Why aren't you like other kids,

490
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,521
break dancing and
wearing bell-bottoms,

491
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,682
and playing the Donkey Kongs?

492
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,367
(LAUGHS) Yeah, right, right.
I don't know.

493
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,925
Uh, I just thought it would be kind
of cool to have one, you know?

494
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,246
Huh?

495
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,810
It's a girl, isn't it?

496
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,724
What? No!

497
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,611
Really? Because when a guy
does something stupid once,

498
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,250
well, that's because
he's a guy.

499
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,766
But if he does
the same stupid thing twice,

500
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,491
it's usually to
impress some girl.

501

Hey, she is not some girl!

974
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,442
What are you doing?
Meet me at my house.

975
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,726
Wait, but...

976
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,325
My house, okay?

977
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,724
Got to plant the seed.

978
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,246
Okay, we're going
to need water.

979
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,285
And uh, something to dig with.

980
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,244
Um, what do I have...
Ted?

981
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,443
Mom, I'm busy, Mom.

982
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,285
Theodore Wiggins,
get down here right now,

983
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,283
and I am not kidding with you!

984
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,648
Ted, I would like
you to meet Mr. O'Hare,

985
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,087
the most powerful man in town.

986
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,361
(LAUGHS)

987
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,885
There he is!

988
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,326
Hello, Ted.

989
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,169
Uh...

990
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,891
Hi. Isn't he clever, Mr. O'Hare?

991
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,602
He knows his own
name and everything.

992
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,329
You know what I would love
right now, Mrs. Wiggins?

993
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,323
A delicious cookie.

994
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,561
(LAUGHS)

995
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,081
Wonderful.

996
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,083
Teddy and I'll
stay here and talk.

997
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,766
Sure, why don't you go
ahead and adopt him?

998
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,722
I'm just kidding. That was a joke.
I was just joking.

999
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,171
I'll get your cookie.

1000
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,647
(LAUGHS)

1001
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,444
I know you have it, Ted.

1002
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,648
So, let's put an end
to this nonsense, shall we?

1003
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,286
Hand it over.

1004
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,561
I'm sorry...

1005
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,769
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1006
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,564
Really? Well, then...

1007
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,087
I guess you wouldn't mind
us checking your room.

1008
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,247
No, no, no!

1009
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,004
Morty! McGurk!
Find the seed!

1010
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,320
No, you can't go up there!

1011
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,925
Guys, this is
ridiculous. Stop!

1012
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,807
Hey!

1013
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,725
No, you can't come in my room!

1014
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,087
Find it!

1015
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,286
(SCREAMING)

1016
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,046
Find it!

1017
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,126
What is going on here?

1018
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,762
This doesn't involve you!
Get back downstairs!

1019
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,126
Excuse me, down there!

1020
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,407
I don't care who you are,
you little crazy baby-man!

1021
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,609
Get out of my house now.
This is outrageous.

1022
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,047
Fine. Sorry.

1023
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,204
Must have been a misunderstanding.
We'll be leaving now.

1024
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,966
And my apologies, Ted.

1025
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,806
You be safe.

1026
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,771
Mind telling me
what's going on here?

1027
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,524
The seed! Where is it?

1028
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,681
Seed?

1029
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,047
Where's Grammy?

1030
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:40,961
It's alive!

1031
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,490
I remember you.

1032
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,084
Ted, what...

1033
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,841
Audrey!

1034
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,202
Hey, did you want to...
Well, okay!

1035
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,083
Ted, what is this about?

1036
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,209
It's about this.

1037
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,961
Wait, wait, wait.

1038
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,726
Is that... Yes. The
last Truff ula seed.

1039
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,803
And you're going to help me plant
it right in the middle of town

1040
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,609
where everyone can see it.

1041
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,570
I could just
kiss you right now!

1042
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,447
We don't have time for that.

1043
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,529
I don't know,
we have a little time.

1044
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,526
But, you know what, let's just go.
Let's go Forget about it.

1045
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,810
Maniac!
Hey!

1046
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,087
Ah!

1047
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,161
Here it comes!

1048
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,687
(SCREAMS)

1049
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,961
I'm going for it.

1050
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,041
(SCREAMS)

1051
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,651
Oh, hello!

1052
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,926
(LAUGHING)

1053
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,288
Ted, big scary blimp coming.

1054
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,241
(EVIL LAUGH)

1055
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,527
Whoa!

1056
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,122
<i>You won't get away
with this, boy!</i>

1057
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,647
Bam!

1058
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,409
<i>Go faster, you idiot!</i>

1059
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,447
Yeah!

1060
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,564
Step on it, Ted!

1061
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,286
Whoa!

1062
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,884
You're fired!

1063
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,006
Whoa! Ted, look out!

1064
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,370
Nobody beats Aloysius O...
Ted...

1065
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,364
(MUZAK PLAYING)

1066
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,771
This is not good.

1067
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,729
How's it doing?

1068
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,487
Whoa-ho-ho!

1069
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,961
(LAUGHS)

1070
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,041
Loser!

1071
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,043
Oh, really?

1072
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,090
Oh, no. The seed!

1073
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,411
Get that seed!

1074
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,489
Hang on! Here we go!

1075
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,607
(SCREAMS)

1076
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,487
Grammy!

1077
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,840
Seriously, how cool
is your grandma?

1078
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,647
(GROANS)

1079
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,007
No!

1080
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,487
Come on!

1081
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,281
Yeah, that's right.

1082
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,807
There it is!

1083
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,849
Hey! Watch the road,
you meathead!

1084
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,041
Ah!

1085
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,841
Hey, ow, ow!

1086
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,761
Oh, come on!

1087
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,401
What the...

1088
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,087
Get it unstuck, get it unstuck!

1089
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,764
Bring it on, Teddy!

1090
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,444
You don't have the guts!

1091
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,167
Ted!

1092
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,765
Grammy!

1093
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,041
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!

1094
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,767
Hey, hey, hey!

1095
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,365
Hey! It's Mr. O...

1096
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,130
Take that, shorty!

1097
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,247
(LAUGHS)

1098
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,128
Okay, we have to get
this in the ground.

1099
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,806
But where?
There's no dirt anywhere.

1100
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,769
No, Grammy...

1101
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,281
MAN: Hey, get out of there!

1102
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,047
Ah!

1103
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,727
Hey!

1104
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,809
What?

1105
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,566
See, what did
I tell you? Easy. Huh?

1106
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,321
Hey, they broke O'Hare's head!

1107
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,528
WOMAN: What do you think
you're doing, kid?

1108
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,001
Um, I'm looking for
a place to plant a tree.

1109
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,207
A real one.

1110
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,645
Why would we need a tree?

1111
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,688
Exactly.

1112
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,805
Oh, man.

1113
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,407
Folks...

1114
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,567
The last thing you
want around here is trees.

1115
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,245
They're filthy!

1116
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:14,169
Spewing that sticky, nasty
sap all over the place.

1117
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:19,000
They bring poisonous ants
and stinging bees.

1118
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,650
Hey!
Ouch.

1119
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,165
Think about the kids.

1120
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,640
And, I just thought,
you know, they make leaves!

1121
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,926
You know that, right?

1122
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,843
Then these leaves,
they just fall.

1123
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,684
They just fall
wherever they want!

1124
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,807
(EXCLAIMING)

1125
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,008
Come on! We know why you're
really against trees.

1126
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,282
Because they produce fresh air.

1127
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,566
For free!

1128
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,210
Oh!

1129
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,887
I am wounded!
You have lied!

1130
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,482
It is not a lie!
It's called photosynthesis.

1131
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,688
Come on.
She's making that up!

1132
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,491
That's a
made-up word, people!

1133
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:56,281
Thneedville is perfect
just the way it is.

1134
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,363
We don't need trees!

1135
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,803
That boy has a seed.

1136
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,686
We need to stop him!
Who's with me? Come on!

1137
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,040
O'Hare is right!

1138
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,328
Seeds will ruin us all!
Stop it!

1139
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,926
Last chance, kid.
Hand it over!

1140
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,640
Where do you think
you're going?

1141
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,211
Come on, let's go!

1142
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,328
Get in, get in!

1143
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,320
Hey!

1144
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,204
Stop that maniac!

1145
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,645
Excuse me, excuse me.
Watch out!

1146
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,291
Ted, you're going
to hit the wall!

1147
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,249
Yeah. I know.

1148
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,361
Wow. Did you see that?

1149
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,327
Who does this kid
think he is, huh?

1150
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,564
I am Ted Wiggins.

1151
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,402
And I speak for the trees.

1152
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,523
And the fact is, things aren't
perfect here in Thneedville.

1153
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,125
And they're only
going to get worse,

1154
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,441
unless we do
something about it,

1155
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,082
unless we change our ways.

1156
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,409
And we can start
by planting this!

1157
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:24,766
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

1158
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,844
Okay. Come on, now.
Everything is fine.

1159
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,721
Right?

1160
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,441
I say we tell this kid
what we think about that seed!

1161
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,884
People, come on!

1162
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,528
You! Get out there right now

1163
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,366
and get these people on my
side, or else you're fired!

1164
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,091
Go on, tell them
what you think.

1165
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,442
(SINGING) <i>You don't know me,
but my name's Cy</i>

1166
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:10,210
<i>I'm just
the O'Hare delivery guy</i>

1167
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:14,410
<i>But it seems like
trees might be worth a try</i>

1168
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,928
<i>So I say let it grow</i>

1169
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,166
<i>My name is Dan</i>

1170
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,401
<i>And my name's Rose</i>

1171
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,086
<i>Our son Wesley kind of glows</i>

1172
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,005
<i>And that's not good,
so we suppose</i>

1173
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,764
<i>We should let it grow</i>

1174
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,207
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1175
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,090
<i>You can't reap
what you don't sow</i>

1176
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,402
<i>Plant a seed inside the Earth</i>

1177
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,842
<i>Just one way to know its worth</i>

1178
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,366
<i>Let's celebrate
the world's rebirth</i>

1179

<i>We say let it grow</i>

1180

<i>My name's Marie,
and I am three!</i>

1181
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,730
<i>I would really
like to see a tree</i>

1182
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,770
<i>I say let it grow</i>

1183
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,083
<i>I'm Grammy Norma I'm old,
and I've got gray hair</i>

1184
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,529
<i>But I remember when
trees were everywhere</i>

1185
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,080
<i>And no one had to pay for air</i>

1186
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,844
<i>So I say let it grow</i>

1187
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,161
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1188
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:11,364
<i>Like it did so long ago</i>

1189
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,602
<i>It is just one tiny seed</i>

1190
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,007
<i>But it's all we really need</i>

1191
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,651
<i>It's time to change
the life we lead</i>

1192
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,404
<i>Time to let it grow</i>

1193
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,689
<i>My name's O'Hare,
I'm one of you</i>

1194
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:28,482
<i>I live here in Thneedville, too</i>

1195
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,962
<i>The things you say
just might be true</i>

1196
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:35,283
<i>It could be time to start anew</i>

1197
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:40,241
<i>And maybe change
my point of view</i>

1198
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,645
Nah! I say let it die!

1199
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,723
<i>Let it die, let it die</i>

1200
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,564
<i>Let it shrivel up and...</i>

1201
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,324
Come on, who's with me?

1202
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,046
Nobody.

1203
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,325
<i>You greedy dirt-bag!</i>

1204
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,841
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1205
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,810
<i>Let the love inside you show</i>

1206

flowered and treed</i>

By the way, nice mustache.
