Thank you for telling us.

- Shall I pack?
- No.

- But, Alfred...
- We are missionaries.

Providence sent us here to fight evil,
not flee from it.

Will you allow me to take
little Ching-Ching out of harm's way?

Barbara will remain here with us.

We perish, we swoon.

159

Yes, master. Black Label all round?

160
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,482
- Right.
- Not for me.

161
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,802
Do these old ears hear right?

162
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,282
Could it be Thomas, the pride of the Randalls,
has refused a drink?

163
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,488
- Right.
- My boy, are you ill?

164
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,451
Uh-uh. In fact, Colonel,
I am still under the spell of a good woman.

You come back here this very minute.

Mr Wu! Mr Wu!

169
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,531
Now, where did you find this good woman?
I didn't know there were any more left.

170
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,922
Come on outside. I'll introduce you,
but remember, I saw her first.

171
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,484
- What about us? Can't we go too?
- Sure, come on. It'll do you good.

172
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,649
Now, none of your Rabelaisian lip.
This girl has led a very sheltered life.

173
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,089
As if I ever said anything that would raise
a faint blush on the cheek of...

174
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,642
Looks like she stood you up.
Nice goings-on, I must say.

175
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,768
Here she is. Hey.

176
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,684
Why don't you go all the way in?
Maybe she's down the cellar.

177
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,843
- That's funny.
- At least she left you the car.

178
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,242
- Sometimes they don't even do that.
- She must be someplace.

179
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,963
- Come on, let's go on in.
- When you find her, yell. We'll be at the bar.

180
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,443
Now, let her go, lad. Better fish in the sea.

181
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,525
You know, this reminds me
of an experience I had in Kansas City.

182
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,650
I met this little lady.
Very fine and very demure.

183
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,200
Mr Wu, you oughta be ashamed.

186
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,370
- Just like a lullaby, eh, Colonel?
- Hmm.

187
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,363
A Chinese lullaby.

188
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,726
- Oh, there you are, Mr Randall, sir.
- Little Lord Fauntleroy.

189
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,441
- Go away. I don't want to talk to you.
- Your car. We must get it aboard.

190
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,923
- The captain's holding up the boat, sir.
- All on account of you, Atkins.

191
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,606
You're a heedless, thoughtless butterfly.

192
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,684
No consideration for others. No...

193
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,206
I thought so.
Colonel, this man's been drinking.

194
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,567
Please, sir, we must hurry, sir. Now, please.

195
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,563
See here.

196
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,440
- Steady, Atkins, steady.
- Now, Tommy, we mustn't be too harsh.

197
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,286
I used to have an uncle that drank.
It's a madness in the blood.

198
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,442
Please, sir, I can walk for myself, sir.

199
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,206
You'll be all right,
but you mustn't shout like that.

200
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,001
We'll get you back on the boat
safe and sound.

201
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,771
It's quite all right.
I can really get there myself.

202
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,491
- It's quite all right.
- Get in there.

203
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,124
- Get in, Tommy, and hold him there.
- No, sir, I'm not drunk, I assure you.

204
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,283
- Are you sober enough to drive?
- Look out.

Steward! Steward!

214
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,286
We found a stowaway in the hold,
but he got away.

215
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,408
Very well.

216
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,769
Jenkins, spread a general alarm.
We seem to have stowaways aboard.

217
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,320
At once, sir.

- Right there, steward.
- Yes, missy.

221
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,125
You were told to watch for stowaways
before we sailed.

222
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,682
- I did, sir.
- Well, if we find one, you'll be out of a job.

223
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,641
You can come back for these things
in half an hour, steward.

224
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,848
And, mind you, he was only 12.

225
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,403
Richard spoke up as quick as a flash,
and what do you think he said, Susan?

226
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,608
"You may use my bicycle, Geraldine."

227
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,288
"I love sport, but I love
the principles of manhood more."

228
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,967
- I'm afraid I'm boring you.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs Hope.

229
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,251
- Richard told me that story three times.
- I tell it not because Richard is my son.

230
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,087
I tell it merely because I believe that you,
as his future wife, might be interested.

231
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,128
Apparently, I was mistaken.

232
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,330
Mark my words, Susan, the time will come
when you'll be just as devoted to Richard...

233
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,562
But I am devoted to him. Only...

234
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,884
Only you have a peculiar way
of demonstrating your devotion.

235
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,729

241
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,168
- The stowaway.
- He growled at me.

- She's frightened us.

246
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,601
- What's your name?
- In Chinese or American?

247
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,920
What?

248
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,562
In American it's Barbara Stewart.
But in Chinese it's Ching-Ching.

249
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,371
- What are you doing here?
- Hiding.

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,841
Hiding? Why?

251
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,651
The man said I was a stowaway.

252
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:46,251
- Well, are you?
- I... I guess so. What's a stowaway?

253
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,564
- How did you ever get on this ship, anyway?
- I don't know.

I never heard of such a thing in all my life.
I can't understand it.

00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,130
- Neither can I.
- Oh, please don't be impertinent.

256
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,046
- She didn't mean to be. Did you, dear?
- No, I didn't.

257
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,327
- What's all this?
- We found the stowaway.

258
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,164
- Where is he?
- It's a she, sir.

259

It's this child here.

What, you?

261
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,285
I guess so.

262
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,522
She doesn't even know how she got aboard.

263

- I'll look after her.

- Susan, don't be absurd.
- She won't be any trouble.

265
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,000
Fine, Miss Parker. Bring her to my quarters
after lunch and we'll have a talk with her.

266
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,845
- You can return to your post now, Jenkins.
- Aye, sir.

267
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,491

Don't you worry, I'll take care of it.

I've never had a dress as nice as this.

275

The ship's store is full of them.

All you have to do is get this one dirty
and we'll find you another one.

Do you think your mother
will like me better now I look beautiful?

278
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,371
- Mrs Hope isn't my mother.
- No?

Well, that is, not yet.

It's time we turned the child

After all, charity has its limits.

283
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,883
What did you mean when you said you didn't
know how you got on this ship? You must.

284
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,042
But I don't, honestly.

285
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,250
The last thing I remember
is that I fell asleep in Uncle Tommy's car.

I might've known you were his niece.

- I'll take you to him, Ching-Ching.

292
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,882
Considering his reputation,
you'd better turn her over to the captain.

00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,962
Very well.

294
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,851
Well, it seems odd, but with Mr Randall,
nothing surprises me.

- Mr Randall's still asleep, sir.

297
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,691
- Well, it's about time he got up.
- Mr Randall never gets up until two, sir.

298

<i>(laughs)</i> I'm sorry, but this is important,
so you'd better call him.

- Tell him a pretty lady wants to see him.

- There's a young lady to see you.

306
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,290
I think it's rather urgent.

307
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,489
- That's bad.
- She's very beautiful, sir.

308
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,244
Oh?

309
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,324
- Well, that's not so bad.
- She has a child with her, sir.

310
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,323
Oh, that is bad.

311
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,563
She also has the captain with her.
He insists on seeing you.

312
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,642
That's very bad.

313
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,210
Here you are, sir.

314
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,851
- What's that?
- Your chequebook, sir.

315
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,922
Oh...

316
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,564
I don't know what your game is,
but I never saw you before.

317
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,610
I have witnesses to my whereabouts
for the past 27 years.

318
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,445
- Mr Randall!
- Uncle Tommy!

319
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,004
Ching-Ching. What on earth...? Please forgive
me, I'm awfully sorry. I'm not quite awake yet.

320
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,923
What are you doing on this boat?

321
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,651
I'm a stowaway, but I didn't mean to be.

322
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,645
- I waited in your automobile like you said.
- But I went out and looked for you.

323
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,326
Well, you see, after a while, it started to rain.

324
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,131
So I got in the back
and pulled the cover down.

325
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,248
Oh, you poor kid.

326
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,081
- I'm awfully sorry.
- But I like being a stowaway, Uncle Tommy.

327
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,084
This is Susan Parker, my best friend.

328
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,527
He's my best friend too.

329
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,171
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

330
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,007
- Don't you think she's stravagant?
- She's magnificent.

331
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,889
Oh, thank you.

332
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,124
- Charming little niece you have, Mr Randall.
- I'm not really his niece, Susan.

333
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,248
- He's just pretending.
- Why...?

334
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,369
- But aren't you the child's uncle?
- No.

335
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,647
We met in Shanghai yesterday.

336
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,122
- Oh, Ching-Ching, you told me...
- I didn't mean to tell a fib.

337
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,602
I was just scared, and I knew
Uncle Tommy would help me.

338
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,366
You know I will. I'm sorry, Captain,
to have caused all this trouble.

339
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,411
I'll accept full responsibility.
I'll be only too glad to pay for her passage.

340
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,847
I'll have to communicate with her people.

341
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,244
From what she tells me, she has no people.
In fact, she has all the earmarks of a waif.

342
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,688
But she must have someone.
She didn't live in China by herself.

343
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,969
I lived with the Kruikshanks,
but they won't care if I stay here.

344
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,045
- Who are the Kruikshanks, dear?
- They're missionaries in Sanchow.

345
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,841
Make a note of that name and get in touch
through the American consul.

346
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,208
In the meantime, I'll look after her.
This time, I really mean it.

347
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,887
I'm inclined to think that Miss Parker
is better company for the child.

348
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,691
Oh, he's good company too.

349
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,047
Maybe you had better go with Miss Parker.

350
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,806
You can call her Susan like I do.
Can't he, Susan?

351
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,121
Well, I suppose so.

352
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,202
I'll see you later, then, Ching-Ching.

353
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,205
- And I hope you too... Susan.
- Thank you.

354
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,523
- Bye, Uncle Tommy.
- Goodbye, darling.

355
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,001

- Understand what, sir?

360
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,689
Your gross neglect of your duties.

361
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,288
The most beautiful girl in the world
is on this ship and you never told me.

362
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,651
Begging your pardon, sir,
but you don't usually have to be told.

363
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,082
- Who is she?
- You met her mother on Monday night.

364
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,242
- I did?
- Unhappily, sir.

365

I...

366
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,281
- I didn't...?
- You did, sir.

367
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,724
Let me have it, Atkins.

368
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,929
You emptied a bottle of champagne
in her lap, sir.

Ding, ding!

373
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,444
Now, now, come, come, Atkins.
You can do better than that.

374
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,081
- You're not even trying.
- I thought it was rather good, sir.

375
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,085
Perhaps you can suggest something else
that I can imitate better.

376
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,162
Well, let me see...

377
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,647
- Sleepy?
- Mm-hm.

378
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,481
It's not ten yet. You'll never be popular
if you fold up right after dinner.

379
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,564
Begging your pardon, sir,

380
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,447
but I think it's customary
for little children to retire rather early.

381
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,922
- Is it really your bedtime, Ching-Ching?
- Mm-hm.

- Atkins, prepare Miss Ching-Ching for bed.
- Me, sir?

- I don't know anything about children.
- I've never...

- Sir, this is very awkward.

Please, Uncle Tommy, I can undress myself.
I always do.

Atkins, a lullaby for Miss Ching-Ching.

- A lullaby.

- Sir, I can't sing a lullaby.

Can't do imitations or sing.

two years ago and he's worked very hard.

456
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:06,371
You mean to say you've been engaged for two
years and you haven't seen him in that time?

457
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,603
You Latins.
What a hot-blooded race you are!

458
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,561
Well, Richard isn't quite like that. We've
known each other since we were children.

459
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,883
Oh, I see.
Well, I must say, it all sounds very lyrical.

460
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,170
- Well, it may not be exactly lyrical.
- Me, of course, I've never been engaged.

461
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,402
Not definitely, that is.

462
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,290
- But if I were to be...
- Not definitely is right.

463
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,727
I seem to recall something
in the newspapers:

464
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,804
"Millionaire playboy
sued for breach of promise."

465
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,362
I practically won that suit.
She only got $10,000.

466
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,807
Poor kid, she'd been counting on 50.

467
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,601
$10,000?
That's more than Richard earns in a year.

468
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,971
Well, you shouldn't be so narrow. After all,
I can't help it if I've been cursed with wealth.

469
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,681
Not that it isn't as nice a curse
as anyone could ask for.

470
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,491
- Have you ever worked for a living?
- Pardon?

471
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,006
You know, work. Like most people do.

472
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,129
Oh, work. Of course. I've worked my father...

473
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,885
Why should I take a job
from someone else who needs it?

474
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,965
I sacrifice myself
for the good of humanity. See?

475
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,327
Do you know what you are?

476
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,085
No, but I have a feeling
that you're about to tell me.

477
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,610
A museum piece. You should be in a glass
case in an exhibit of the terrible Twenties,

478
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,242
cocktail shaker in your hand, shirt scrawled
with chorus girls' telephone numbers,

479
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,290
and a label - "Playboy BC, Before The Crash,

480
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,603
former habitat, Broadway, now extinct."

481
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,125
Hmm...

482
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,010
You don't exactly pull your punches, do you?

483
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,405
Would it please you to know that I feel
about that high and six years old?

484
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,962
You should grow up.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

485
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,691
Oh, but forget it. At least forget it for now.

486
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,967
I'm really not a reformer always.

487
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,841
Anyway, beneath that too-smooth exterior
beats a heart of gold... I think.

488
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,209
- It's beating awfully fast right now.

Where's Susan? She's not ill, is she?

No, Richard, she's not ill.

Why did you send for me?
After all, it's not exactly an inexpensive trip.

was more than I could cope with alone.

What do you mean?
Heavens, Mother, don't build it up.

Did you ever hear
of a man named Tommy Randall?

541
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,601
Randall? The name's familiar.

542
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,843
- It should be. It's in the papers enough.
- What about him?

543
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,481
- He's on this boat.
- What's that got to do with Susan?

544
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,770
Richard, your mother's a woman of
the world. You realise that. She can tell...

545
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,401
She can tell what?
Heavens, Mother, we're not getting anyplace.

546
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,484
I'm not saying there's been
anything wrong between them.

547
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,608
So that's it?

548
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,844
I've flown here just to be told Susan
is having a harmless little ship flirtation?

549
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,400
It may be harmless, and it may not.

550
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,087
After all, Richard,
Susan's a very headstrong young woman.

551
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,811
Well, marriage will straighten her out.

552

Still, he might've meant it
as a wedding present.

Well, it's about time we declared an armistice.

751
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,402
I've been feeling terrible, Susan.

752
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,168
Well, this is very pretty,
but of course I can't accept it.

753
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,406
Take back your baubles, is that it?

754
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,882
Listen, Susan, I think you're being very...

755
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,531
What, is it as bad as all that?

756
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:40,288
- Don't you like me any more?
- That has nothing to do with it.

757
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,886
Well, don't you?

758
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,088
Not particularly.

759
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:10,161
You know what you tell me:
keep your chin up and you'll be OK.

760
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,047
As Sun Lo says, the strongest man
in the world cannot lift a heavy heart.

761
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,646
Why is your heart heavy?

762
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,688
You know that Mr Hope?

763
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,081
Well, Susan's gonna marry him.

764
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,400
Oh!

765
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,007
She'll have Mrs Hope for a mother-in-law.
It'll serve her right, too.

766
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:32,688
Oh, no! Nobody should have
Mrs Hope for a mother-in-law.

767
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,688
Ah, there you are, young lady.

768
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,731
Just the one I want to see.
I've got a surprise for you.

769
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,368
As an unshelled nut is to a squirrel,
so is a surprise to him who receives it.

770
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,967
Righto, darling.
You're going to leave the ship at Singapore.

771
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,041
What?

772
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,566
Now, you run down below
and start to get ready.

773
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,120
Then when you come back,
I'll tell you the rest.

774
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,125
You oughta give Uncle Tommy a surprise too,
just to make him feel better.

775
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,841
- He's been in the... What was it?
- Doghouse.

776
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,968
With Mr Wu.

777
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,006
- What is all this?
- I just received this wireless from Shanghai.

778
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,641
- What will the consul do with her?
- There's a home for girls in Shanghai.

779
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,769
- He'll probably see she's placed in it.
- Home for girls?

780
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:27,209
You mean grey uniforms and pigtails?
Ching-Ching was never meant for that.

781
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,810
I know, old man, but I'm afraid
it's about all that can be done for her.

782
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,882
Captain, wait a minute.

783
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,209
This may sound crazy,
but why can't I adopt her?

784
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,602
Now, see here, son.
You're a bachelor. And quite a bachelor.

785
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,047
No court would turn a child over to you.

786
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,363
- It would be different if I were married?
- Well, naturally.

787
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,528
- It's a horrible step.
- I don't think you need worry, old man.

788
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,364
You haven't got time now.

789
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,325
- Excuse me. Have you seen Ching-Ching?
- Yes.

790
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,370
- Do you know where she is?
- Yes.

791
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,966
Well, would you mind telling me?

792
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,850
Below, getting ready
to leave the ship at the next stop.

793
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,082
They're putting her in a home for girls.

794
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,528
She'll be marching in lockstep
and eating gruel within a week.

795
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,967
- I hope you like it.
- Oh, Tommy.

796
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,601
- Tears won't help.
- But surely something can be done.

797
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,331
This can't happen to Ching-Ching.

798
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,402
I don't know.

799
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,525
Wait a minute.
You're gonna marry old sourpuss, aren't you?

800
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,921
- I beg your pardon?
- Sorry, no of fence meant.

801
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,049
Look, I tried to adopt Ching-Ching,
but I'm unmarried.

802
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,441
- You're getting married.
- Richard might...

803
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,002
- You don't want her to go to an institution?
- Of course not.

804
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:55,130
Then listen.
I've gone completely soft about that kid.

805
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,282
Incredible, I know, but true.

806
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,807
Adopt her. Let me pay for her upbringing
until I can take her myself.

807
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,282
That'll be as quick as I can get to the States
and come back with a wife.

808
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,364
Will you do it? It wouldn't be for long.

809
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,764
You may not believe it, but there are quite
a few girls back home willing to marry me.

810
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,683
At least there used to be.

811
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,366
It's not for me, it's for Ching-Ching.

812
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,489
- I'll do it.
- I knew you would.

813
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,282
May I speak to you, Susan?

814
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,045
- Pardon me.
- Certainly.

815
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:30,047
Susan, I'm awfully sorry if I annoyed you
in speaking of that bracelet as I did.

816
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:34,409
Imagine my becoming so upset
over a mere trinket. Absurd, isn't it?

817
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,881
Oh, I was a little upset myself. I'm sorry.

818
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,725
There, that's better. Everything's all right now.

819
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:45,125
Here we are, the three happy Hopes.
One, two, three, and away we go.

820
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,601
Mother was a little weepy
when you stalked out.

821
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,048
Somehow she got the idea
you'd prefer her not to live with us.

822
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,329
- Why, whatever could've given her that idea?
- I don't know.

823
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,882
But I told her we couldn't get along
without her. Didn't I, Mother?

824
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,646
- Well, I don't suppose we could.
- That's awfully sweet of you, Susan.

825
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,691
Heaven protect us all from interfering
mothers-in-law is what I always say.

826
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,560
Goodness. I was married myself once
and I know what I'm talking about.

827
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:15,363
Not that Mr Hope's mother didn't mean well,
but then, you know... young love.

828
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,442
We do know, don't we?

829
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,409
- Richard.
- Yes?

830
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,050
Just one thing.

831
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:27,602
Well, I want to adopt little Ching-Ching
as soon as we're married.

832
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,762
Whoever heard of such a thing?

833
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,207
If I don't, they'll put her in an institution.

834
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,523
- That's what institutions are for.
- Oh, Richard, please.

835
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:39,605
I'm sure Richard doesn't want to start
his married life with a ready-made family.

836
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,160
Especially with a child called Ching-Ching.

837
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,891
It won't be for long,
just until Mr Randall gets back.

838
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,568
- Randall? What's he got to do with it?
- Well... You see, it's a favour to him.

839
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,529
He wants to adopt her as soon as he can.

840
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,809
When he gets back to the States,
he'll arrange to take her.

841
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,963
- Why should I do Mr Randall a favour?
- Why indeed?

842
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:01,328
It isn't for him, it's for the little girl.
Think of her future.

843
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,210
Don't meddle
with other people's destinies, my dear.

844
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,330
Forget this child. She got along before she
met you and she will after she leaves you.

845
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,846
Dismiss her from your mind completely.

846
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,447
Please, don't you think Richard and I
should settle this by ourselves?

847
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,249
After all, it concerns us.

848
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,403
Anything that concerns Richard concerns me.

849
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,642
I think Mother's right, Susan.

850
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,210
- You do?
- Yes.

851
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,763
- Your mother's right and I'm wrong?
- Well, yes. That is, I think you're mistaken.

852
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,128
So do I. I've been mistaken about you and me.

853
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,885
- Now, Susan...
- Listen, marriage is for two people.

854
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,440
I'm breaking our engagement.

855
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,211
Richard, she'll come back.
Meanwhile you wait.

856
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,851
The man should always wait,
otherwise he's weak.

857
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,121
Ching-Ching! Ching-Ching!

858
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,170
Goodbye, Uncle Tommy.
The captain says I have to go.

859
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,765
No, you don't.

860
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,845
Didn't you say she could be adopted by
someone who's married? She's going to be.

861
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,321
- Here she is now.
- Oh, darling.

862
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,165
- Don't I have to go ashore?
- Not now. Tell her, Susan.

863
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:12,131
- Miss Parker's going to adopt Ching-Ching.
- I'm not going to be married.

864
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:17,286
- What? Oh, but you said...
- I think we'd better go now, darling.

865
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,687
Just a minute.

866
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,560
This isn't really goodbye.
I'll come back for you real soon.

867
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,530
And in the meantime, you won't cry, will you?

868
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,683
No, Uncle Tommy, but remember,

869
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:36,290
one... one minute of waiting
is a century to the hopeful.

870
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,806
I'll remember, Ching-Ching.

871
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,882
Goodbye, sweetie.

872
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:50,802
If you ever come back again, you won't
forget to come and see me, will you?

873
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,851
- I'll be in the orphan asylum in Shanghai.
- Oh, sure, we'll look you up.

874
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,400
- Won't we?
- Of course we will.

875
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,004
Maybe we'll have some more fun
like we had.

876
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,162
We might even go back to jail again.

877
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,322
<i>(Tommy)</i> Yes, we might.

878
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,847
Well, I think I'd better run along now.

879
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,400
Before I really cry. Goodbye.

880
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,964
We can't let this happen to her.

881
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,726
Look, Susan, I've got an idea.
Please don't say no till you hear me out.

882
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,691
I know exactly what you think of me,
but that isn't important now.

883
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,321
Marry me. Don't misunderstand me.
You wouldn't have to put up with me.

884
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,323
It'd just be a marriage in name only.

885
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,449
Soon as we dock in San Francisco,
go to Reno and get a divorce.

886
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,205
My lawyers will take care of everything.

887
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,524
I wish you would. For Ching-Ching.
It's the only way.

888
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:52,844
- You'd really do that for her?
- I'd do anything in the world for her.

889
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,321
- So would I.
- Then you will?

890
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,164
Yes.

891
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,527
Hey, bring her back.

892
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,127
- What's that?
- We're getting married. We want to adopt her.

893
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,524
Come on, Ching-Ching, darling.
We're going back aboard ship again.

894
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,886
For as much
as Susan Parker and Thomas Randall

895
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,088
have consented together in holy wedlock,

896
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,766
and have witnessed the same
before this company,

897
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,844
and have given and pledged
their troth, each to the other,

898
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,608
and have declared the same by giving
and receiving a ring and joining hands,

899
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,331
I pronounce that they are man and wife.

900
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,528
Amen.

901
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,729
- All happiness, my dear. Good luck, my boy.
- Thank you.

902
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:38,840
Twice blessed is he who loves both bride
and groom, for their happiness is his.

903
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,403
Congratulations, Mr Randall.
Much joy to you, Mrs Randall.

904
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:48,246
- Thank you.
- A sailor's knot is as good as City Hall's.

905
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,005
There'll be some formalities about the child.

906
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,321
I'll have my lawyer take care of that.

907
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,327
- Susan, why did you do this?
- Young man, you're talking to my wife.

908
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,011
- Richard, dear!
- And you told me to wait.

909
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:07,921
- Are you really and truly my parents now?
- We're the best you've got, darling.

910
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,688
Sun Lo says a child without parents
is like a ship without a rudder.

911
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,286
Sun Lo ever say anything
about going to sleep?

912
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,044
Oh, yes.

913
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,841
He said sleep without dreams
is given to children for their innocence

914
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,922
and old men for their wisdom.

915
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,606
Well, off you go, then.

916
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,604
I'm almost too excited to sleep, but I'll try.

917
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,765
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Aunt Susan, Uncle Tommy.

918
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,684
Good night, darling,
but I'm not your uncle any more.

919
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,128
- What are you, then?
- Can't you guess?

920
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,771
I know. You're my father now.

921
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,650
- Night, Dad.
- Good night, honey.

922
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,607
- Good night.
- Good night.

923
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,882
Well, here you are.

924
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,928
Did the stewardess move your things?

925
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,731
She said Mrs Hope almost bit her.

926
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,211
- I...
- I...

927
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,282
- Go ahead.
- No, you.

928
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,807
Well, I was just going to say
if there was anything you wanted me to do

929
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,363
to lend credibility to the situation,
I'll be glad to do it, you know.

930
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,570
- People will talk whatever we do.
- Sure, of course.

931
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:26,120
Well, I guess I'll be off.

932
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,888
I don't know how to thank you.

933
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,770
I'll try to make things
as easy for you as possible.

934
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:37,084
I'm cabling my lawyers tonight. You can go
direct to Reno as soon as the boat docks.

935
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,766
- Everything's arranged.
- Very thoughtful.

936
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,810
Not at all. You'll like Reno.
It's a fascinating place.

937
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,326
Lots of fresh air and horseback riding.

938
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,448
Full of nice, emotional people.

939
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,010
Oh...

940
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,562
- This is the address you go to.
- Thank you.

941
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,370
You're really wonderful.
I suppose you know that.

942
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:02,684
Well, at the moment,
I don't feel very wonderful.

943
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:06,321
Well, if you must know,
I don't feel so good myself.

944
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,802
- Good night, Susan.
- Good night, Tommy.

945
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,361
I...

946
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:42,169
Begging your pardon, sir, where shall I
lay out your pyjamas this evening?

947
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:48,247
- Where you laid them last night.
- Oh, dear. I'm so sorry, sir.

948
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,684
<i>(knocking)</i>

949
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,251
Come in.

950
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,120
Susan, why didn't you warn me
you were going to do this?

951
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:12,444
Well, I... I didn't have time,
and besides... <i>(laughs)</i> it's too late now.

952
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:17,526
- Well, it's hardly funny, is it?
- Not to me.

953
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,446
Well, tell me one thing.
You don't love him, do you?

954
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,364
Do you?

955
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,449
No, I don't, but even if I did
it wouldn't make any difference.

956
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,605
Yes, it would. Listen, darling,
I've been a worm, I know that now.

957
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,286
But I've had an understanding with Mother.

958
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,207
You can have your way from now on, always,
if you'll tell me there's a chance.

959
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,602
Oh, no, Richard.
It wouldn't work. You know it wouldn't.

960
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,763
You can be nice. You're nice now, but...

961
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,367
- Please, Susan.
- No, really, I'm too confused to talk about it.

962
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,488
I'm even too upset to think about it.

963
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,769
I'll follow you.
I'll follow you until you say yes.

964
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,844
No, Richard, I'd rather you didn't.

965
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,242
You'd better lock this.

01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,129
- Is this Mrs Randall?
- Yes.

985
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,567
You mustn't be nervous
when your case is called.

986
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:13,486
I've placed you at the beginning
of today's calendar. Meanwhile, wait here.

987
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,369
That's awfully kind of you, Judge.

988
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,808
This is my first divorce,
and I'm a little jittery.

989
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,963
It is a little strange at first,
but they all get used to it.

990
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,805
- You know, like influenza.
- <i>(knocking)</i>

991
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,008
Come.

992
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,082
Right in here, please.

993
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,924
- Susan!
- Darling, I'm so glad to see you.

994
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,767
Oh, this is a surprise.
But I don't understand.

995
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,162
Well, you see, I thought
I might want another divorce sometime.

996
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:47,687
I was sort of curious
to see how they made them.

997
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,125
<i>(clears throat)</i>

998
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,727
- Judge Booth, this is Mr Randall.
- The husband, I presume?

999
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,041
Yes. This is my daughter.

1000
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,566
- <i>Your</i> daughter?
- Adopted.

1001
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,530
- How are you, young lady?
- Fine, thank you.

1002
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,082
To greet one you love
is better for the health than medicine.

1003
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:07,687
Well, I declare.
That sounds like a Chinese proverb.

1004
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,842
Judge, you haven't heard anything yet.

1005
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,720
Well, well, well.
Come over here and talk to me.

1006
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:22,687
I... I tried to stay away, but I found I couldn't.
I had to see you again.

1007
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,410
Suppose you and I have our talk
in the other room.

1008
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,526
Uh...

1009
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:34,571
- Will you excuse us for a few moments?
- Oh, but would it be proper?

1010
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:40,522
- I mean, our being left alone together now.
- Oh, it's quite customary.

1011
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,961
- You're looking very well.
- I haven't had a drink in six weeks.

1012
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,283
- That's wonderful.
- No, it isn't, it's terrible.

1013
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:56,763
Still, I'll get along, and it does show
what the influence of a good woman can do.

1014
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:00,128
- Oh, really? Who is she?
- Ching-Ching.

1015
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:05,241
I told you I'd do anything in the world for her.

1016
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,607
You've proven that.

1017
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:11,526
Honestly, you wouldn't know me.
I'm a changed man.

1018
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,285
I may not be any better,
but at least I'm different.

1019
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,203
I'm so glad.

1020
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,766
You know, you were right about Reno.
It's a fascinating place.

1021
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,286
- So charming and...
- Susan. Darling.

1022
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,250
- Oh, Tommy, please.
- Do we have to go through with this?

1023
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:38,090
Richard is waiting in the courtroom to marry
me. He's gonna take me back to the Orient.

1024
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,162
Oh...

1025
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,242
I see.

1026
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,922
Well, I guess that's that, isn't it?

1027
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,207
I'm sorry.

1028
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,282
Sorrier than I can say.

1029
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,243
Everyone rise.
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!

1030
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,961
The District Court of Washoe,
State of Nevada, is now in session.

1031
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:18,602
The Honourable JG Booth, judge presiding.
Be seated, please.

1032
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,445
Case of Randall versus Randall.

1033
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,603
- Any witnesses for plaintiff?
- The case is uncontested.

1034
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,684
In that case, the court would like
to call a witness of its own.

1035
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,603
But the case is uncontested.

1036
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:36,050
I said the court will call a witness of its own.
Miss Barbara Randall.

1037
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,803
We don't want her mixed up in this.

1038
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,771
The witness will take the stand.
The defendant will please be seated.

1039
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:53,483
- Raise your right hand, please.
- I think we can dispense with the oath.

1040
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:57,645
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Now, Miss Randall.

1041
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:00,644
- You can call me Ching-Ching, Judge.
- Thank you.

1042
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:04,930
Now, Ching-Ching, the plaintiff
alleges general incompatibility.

1043
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,571
Have you ever noticed
evidence of such a condition

1044
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,883
existing between the parties to this action?

1045
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,361
To my knowledge,
the contestants in this action

1046
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,250
have manifested
nothing but the most harmonious,

1047
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,324
cordial and friendly feelings
towards each other.

1048
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,483
- But, Your Honour, I object.
- Who are you, young man?

1049
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,963
- Why, I'm engaged to the plaintiff.
- Engaged?

1050
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,122
To a married woman?

1051
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,727
- This court recognises no such engagement.
- <i>(laughter)</i>

1052
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:45,966
Now, Ching-Ching, have either of the parties
in this action ever evidenced by their conduct

1053
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,691
any proper legal ground for divorce?

1054
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:53,527
There's utterly no ground for disturbing
the marital status of the contestants.

1055
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,366
Most irregular, Your Honour.
The child doesn't know what she is saying.

1056
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,250
Oh, yes, she does.
Tell the court.

1057
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,291
Isn't this action the result of two
grown-up people behaving like children,

1058
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,250
refusing to admit
that they're in love with each other?

1059
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:13,043
The allegations of the complaint
insofar as it refers to...

1060
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,691
Uh...

1061
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,603
Matrimony.

1062
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:18,966
Huh?

1063
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,529
- Matrimony.
- Oh, yes.

1064
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,286
- Insofar as it refers to macaroni...
- <i>(lawyer)</i> Macaroni?

1065
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,684
There! See, Your Honour?
The child has obviously been coached.

1066
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,481
I was not. I just forgot
what the judge told me to say.

1067
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,244
<i>- (laughter)
- (gavel)</i>

1068
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:41,120
- ls counsel intimating that she is lying?
- Counsel charges just that.

1069
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,568
Have you any witnesses
to disprove her testimony?

1070
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,723
Do you wish to testify
that this child was lying?

1071
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,007
Why...

1072
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:54,802
- No, of course not.
- Then you admit that you love Mrs Randall?

1073
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,291
She knows I do.

1074
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:00,001
You, Mrs Randall.
Do you wish to attack this child's veracity?

1075
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,562
- Why, no, certainly not.
- You admit that you love your husband?

1076
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,448
- Well, yes, I do.
- Then what's all this nonsense about?

1077
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:15,731
Divorce denied. Take your child
and go home, both of you, where you belong.

1078
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,689
Your Honour, what about me?

1079
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,889
My advice, young man, is to stop tampering
with the affections of married women.

1080
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,564
- Well, we did it, didn't we?
- You bet we did.

1081
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,285
Judge, you're simply stravagant.

1082
