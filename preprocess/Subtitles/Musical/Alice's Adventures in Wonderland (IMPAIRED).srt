William the Conqueror,
whose cause was favored by the Pope,

was soon submitted to by the English,
who wanted leaders,

and were of late much accustomed
to usurpation and conquest.

the earls of Mercia and Northumbria...

..and even Stigand,
as the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury,

73

found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling
and offer William the crown.

- Yes?

Oh, in that case, I move that this meeting
adjourn for more energetic measures,

82
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,527

would be to have a Caucus-race.

(Alice gasping)

162
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,805
(Gasping)

163
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,937
<i>Who are you? Who are you?</i>

164
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,442
(Tapping)

165
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:06,484
<i>Who are you?</i>

166
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,151
(He sighs )

167
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,527
(Door creaks )

168
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,464
Who are you?

169
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,737
Come on, don't just stand there.

170
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,605
Who are you?

171
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,840
I'm afraid I don't know just at the moment.

172
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,904
I know who I was
when I got up this morning,

173
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:40,418
but I think I've changed
several times since then.

174
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,421
What do you mean by that exactly?

175
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,648
Explain yourself.

176
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,023
Afraid I can't explain myself.

177
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,528
I'm not myself, you see.

178
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,157
No, I don't see.

179
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,829
Well, I can't put it any more clearly, I'm afraid,
because I don't understand it myself,

180
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,864
and it's very confusing changing size so often.

181
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,503
It's not at all.

182
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,481
Well, I imagine you'll feel a bit queer
when you change size, won't you?

183
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,884
- Not a bit.
- Well, it feels very queer to me.

184
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,717
Who are you?

185
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,150
I think you ought to tell me who you are first.

186
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,821
Why?

187
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,263
(Stutters ) Come back!

188
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,095
Come...

189
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:35,534
I have something important to say.

190
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,035
Yes?

191
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,617
<i>K</i>eep your temper.

192
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,549
Is that all?

193
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,587
No.

194
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,624
(Clock ticking)

195
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,030
So...

196
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:12,133
- you're thinking of changing, are you?
- I'm afraid I am.

197
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,146
You see, I can't remember things I used to

198
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,978
and I can't stay the same size
for more than ten minutes together.

199
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,120
What sort of things?

200
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:26,123
Well, I've tried to say How Doth The Little
Busy Bee, but it came out all different.

201
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,220
<i>V</i>ery well.

202
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,058
Repeat...

203
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,530
You Are Old, Father William.

204
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,394
''You are old, Father William,''
the young man said...

205
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,168
- (Clock ticking)
- ''And your hair has become very white;

206
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:48,839
''And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
Do you think at your age it is right?''

207
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,848
- (Clock ticking)
- ''In my youth,'' said the sage,

208
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,350
as he shook his gray locks...

209
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,581
- Um...
- (Clock ticking)

210
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,919
Um...

211
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:02,154
''In my youth,'' said the sage,
as he shook his gray locks,

212
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,287
- ''I kept all my limbs very supple''
- (Clock ticking)

213
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,298
''By the use of this ointment--

214
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:16,362
''One shilling a box--
Allow me to sell you a couple?''

215
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,274
- (Clock ticking)
- ''You are old,'' said the youth,

216
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,973
''and your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than...

217
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,539
- ''than suet;
- (Clock ticking)

218
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,955
''Do you think I can listen
all day to such stuff?''

219
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:39,155
''Be off or I'll kick you downstairs!''

220
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,894
(Snorts ) That's not quite right!

221
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,770
I'm afraid some of the words
seem to have got altered.

222
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:51,138
No! It is wrong from beginning to end.

223
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:55,168
What...what size do you want to be?

224
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,272
I'm not particular as to size.

225
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,977
It's just that one doesn't like
changing so often, you know.

226
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,520
No, I don't know.

227
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:06,990
- Are...are you happy now?
- Well, I'd like to be a little larger.

228
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:11,086
Hm. Seems a very nice size to me.

229
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:15,293
- But I'm not used to it.
- Hm.

230
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:19,997
- (Sighs ) You'll get used to it in time.
- (Clock ticking)

231
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,632
- (Hammering on door)
- (Shouting)

232
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,801
- (Shattering)
- (Laughter)

233
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,882
You'll never make them people
hear in there, you see,

234
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,887
cos they're...like they're making
too much noise themselves.

235
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,685
I mean, you follow what I mean.
You can hear 'em.

236
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,692
How am I to get in, then?

237
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,024
Hm.

238
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:47,862
- Hm!
- (Shouting continues )

239
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,366
(Shattering)

240
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:53,234
Hm!

241
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,296
(Shattering)

242
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,807
Hm.

243
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:01,869
Oh, excuse me. Something seems
to be cropping up in this area over here.

244
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:07,442
An invitation from the Queen
for the Duchess to play croquet.

245
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,453
Oh, let's have a look.

246
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,589
This the one, then, is it?

247
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,250
Mm.

248
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,694
Yes, right, then. Thank you.

249
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,595
- (Grunts )
- (Smash)

250
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:24,465
Just, er...just sink quietly
out of sight for me, will you?

251
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,231
(Shattering and laughter)

252
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,238
Yes.

253
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,536
- (Dog barks )
- (Shattering)

254
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,803
- Now, then. I'll tell you what I'll do.
- (Shattering)

255
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,747
- (Wild laughter)
- Tell you what I'll do for you.

256
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:41,582
Nothing. How's that?
Any good to you at all? Nothing?

257
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,486
I mean, I wouldn't be able to do it
straightaway, I'll say that.

258
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,854
I couldn't possibly do it straightaway

259
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,758
cos I got all these things
cropping up I have to deal with.

260
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,388
I... Well, you saw just now.

261
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,398
- Something cropped up there.
- (Smash)

262
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:58,197
And I get...the same type of thing
I get cropping up all the time, you see.

263
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,830
So naturally I got my hands full.

264
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,272
But if I was to do nothing for you...

265
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,276
I can't promise I could,
but if I was to do nothing for you,

266
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:11,475
I'd have to sort of find a time, you see, when
I could squeeze it in, you see what I mean?

267
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:16,214
- I think you're absolutely idiotic.
- Oh. Oh, well.

268
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,916
Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not.

269
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,924
(Raised voices )

270

- (Baby gurgling)
- (Hums tune )

274
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:47,044
- Why does your cat look like that?
- It's a Cheshire cat, that's why.

275
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,676
(Chuckles )

276
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,721
Pig!

277
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,484
I didn't know
that Cheshire cats looked like that.

278
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,321
All of them can and most of them do.

279
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:59,124
- I don't know that any of them do.
- You don't know much and that's a fact.

280
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:00,892
(Gasping and wheezing)

(Baby gurgles )

Oh dear, oh dear.

(Grunting and snorting)

286
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,807
Oh! Oh! Here we go,
here we go, here we go.

287
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,146

- Mind the baby!

(Baby cries )

289
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,177
If everybody minded their own business,

290
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,884
the world would turn
a great deal faster than it does.

291
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,654
That wouldn't be a great advantage.

292
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:33,289
The world turns on its axis every 24 hours.

293
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,923
Oh-ho-ho!

294
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,993
Don't bother me, I never could abide figures.
Could I?

295

- (He burbles )
- (Baby chuckles )

296
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:45,471
Speak roughly to your little boy
And beat him when he sneezes

297
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,513
He only does it to annoy
Because he knows it teases!

298
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,013
(Baby cries )

299
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:54,108
- (Both) Wow! Wow! Wow!
- (Baby cries )

300
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:58,952
I speak severely to my boy
I beat him when he sneezes

301
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:02,585
For he can thoroughly enjoy
The pepper when he pleases!

302
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:06,358
- (Baby crying)
- (Both chant song)

303
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,991
Wow, wow, wow, wow!

304
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,900
(Baby oinks )

305
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,966
(Cook) Yes, yes.

306
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:21,035
I speak severely to my boy
I beat him when he sneezes

307
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:26,550
For he could thoroughly enjoy
The pepper if he pleases!

308
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:30,679
(Cook) Yes, yes, yes.

309
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,848
Here, nurse him for a bit.

310

(Piglet squeals)

312
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,433
<i>Which way ought I to go from here?</i>

313
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:57,842
<i>(Whispers) That depends a great deal</i>
<i>on where you want to go to.</i>

314
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,248
<i>I don't much care where.</i>

315
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:03,310
<i>(Whispers)</i>
<i>Then it doesn't matter which way you go.</i>

316
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,788
<i>So long as I get somewhere.</i>

317
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:09,486
<i>(Whispers) Oh, you're sure to do that</i>
<i>if you only walk long enough.</i>

318
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,997
<i>What sort of people live about here?</i>

319
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:20,731
<i>(Whispers) In that dire</i>ct<i>ion is a Hatter.</i>
<i>and in that dire</i>ct<i>ion lives a March Hare.</i>

320
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,602
<i>(Whispers) They're both mad.</i>

321
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,643
<i>But I don't want to go among mad people.</i>

322
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,009
<i>(Whispers) Oh, you can't help that.</i>
<i>we're all mad here.</i>

323
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,412
<i>(Whispers) I'm mad.</i> Y<i>ou're mad.</i>

324
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:39,116
<i>(Whispers) By-the-by, what became</i>
<i>of the baby? I'd nearly forgotten to ask.</i>

325
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,217
<i>It turned into a pig.</i>

326
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,318
<i>(Whispers) Ha. I thought it would.</i>

327
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,928
<i>(Whispers) Did you say pig, or fig?</i>

328
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,970
<i>I said pig.</i>

329
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,798
(Birdsong)

330
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,240
(Bees buzzing)

331
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,558
No room.

332
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:20,962
Oh.

333
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,058
- No room.
- No room. No room, no room.

334
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:27,070
- There's no...
- No room!

335
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,197
No room. No, no, no room. No room.

336
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,901
- No room.
- There's no room.

337
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,139
- No room.
- There's no room.

338
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,976
- There's plenty of room.
- Oh. Oh.

339
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,176
- Have some wine.
- I don't see any wine.

340
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:43,277
- There isn't any.
- Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it.

341
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:47,017
It wasn't very civil of you
to sit down before you were invited.

342
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,821
I thought you did invite me,

343
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,760
and anyway, the table's laid
for a great deal more than three.

344
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,697
Your, um...your...

345
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,428
your hair, er...wants cutting.

346
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,936
You shouldn't make personal remarks.
It's very rude.

347
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:05,306
Oh. Why is a raven like a writing-desk,
I wonder.

348
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:08,971
(Alice ) Oh, I'm glad you've begun
asking riddles. I think I can guess that one.

349
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,107
Do you mean that
you can find the answer to it?

350
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,811
- (Alice ) Exactly.
- Then you should say what you mean.

351
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:18,151
(Alice ) I do. At least, I mean what I say.

352
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,249
- It's the same thing, you know.
- It isn't the same thing a bit.

353
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:26,730
You might as well say that I, er...''I see what
I eat'' is the same thing as ''I eat what I see''!

354
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,322
You might just as well say

355
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,096
that ''I like what I get''
is the same thing as ''I get what I like''!

356
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,797
Yes.

357
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,204
You might as well say...

358
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:44,346
''I sleep when I breathe''
is the same thing as ''I breathe when I sleep''!

359
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:48,647
- Oh, it is the same thing with you.
- (Chuckles )

360
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,688
(Insects buzz )

361
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,538
(Yawning)

362
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:19,640
- Oh, what day of the month is it?
- I think it's the fourth.

363
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:22,049
Oh! Ha-ha-ha!

364
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,578
Two days wrong! I knew that butter
wouldn't be good for the works.

365
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,023
- (Insect buzzes )
- It was the best butter.

366
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:31,357
Yes, but we must have got
some crumbs in with it or something.

367
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,556
I told you not to use the bread-knife.

368
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:37,590
- It was the best butter.
- That's as maybe.

369
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:42,299
What a curious watch! It tells the day
of the month and not what time it is.

370
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:46,434
Of course it does, child.
Does your watch tell you what year it is?

371
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,480
Of course not. That's because
it's the same year for so long together.

372
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:53,176
Exactly! Well, it's just the same
with my watch. Oh!

373
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:59,520
# When Adam and Eve were first deprived
of the golden hand by Heaven...

374
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,754
Oh, the Dormouse is falling asleep again.

375
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:06,786
- Have you guessed the riddle yet?
- No, I give up. What is the answer?

376
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,164
I haven't the slightest idea.

377
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,169
Nor I.

378
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,137
I think you might do
something better with your time

379
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,901
than waste it on riddles that have no answers.

380
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:21,639
If you knew Time as well as I do,
you wouldn't talk about it. It's him.

381
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,044
I don't know what you mean.

382
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:28,051
Of course you don't! I dare say
you've never even spoken to Time!

383
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,587
Perhaps not, but I know
I have to beat time when I learn music.

384
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,816
Oh!

385
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:36,454
Oh!

386
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:39,496
Ho-ho-ho-ho! That accounts for it!

387
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,555
He can't stand beating.

388
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:46,366
But if you keep on good terms with Time,
he'll do anything with a clock that you want.

389
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:51,636
For example, supposing it's half past nine in
the morning, you just whisper a hint to Time.

390
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:56,203
Around goes the clock and it's half past one
in the afternoon, time for dinner!

391
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,841
I only wish it were.

392
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,943
(Alice ) Yes, it might be rather nice
but then I wouldn't be hungry for it, you know.

393
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,719
Not at first, perhaps, but you could keep it
at half past one for as long as you like.

394
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:11,421
- (Alice ) Is that the way you manage?
- Oh, no, no, no, no. We quarreled last March.

395
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,988
Just before he went mad, you know.

396
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:18,627
It was at a concert given by the
Queen of Hearts. I had to sing that song.

397
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:23,163
# Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!

398
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,574
# How I wonder what you're at! #

399
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:28,373
You're familiar with it, doubtless?

400
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,710
- I've heard something like it.
- Yes, it goes on...

401
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,013
# Up above the world the world you fly...

402
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,646
- (Insect buzzes )
- # Like a tea tray in the sky

403
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:42,022
# Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...

404
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:46,223
Oh, well, I'd hardly finished the first verse

405
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:52,429
when the Queen jumps up and bawls out,
''He's murdering the Time! Off with his head!''

406
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:56,030
- How dreadfully savage!
- Oh, yes, yes, yes!

407
00:32:56,107 --> 00:33:00,976
Ho-ho! And ever since then,
Time won't do a thing for me.

408
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:04,276
It's always six o'clock now.

409
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,544
(Alice ) Is that the reason
why so many tea things are put out here?

410
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,085
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

411
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,247
It's always...it's always teatime

412
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:17,886
and of course we don't get much time
to wash the things up between whiles.

413
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:21,796
- So you keep moving round, I suppose.
- Oh, we keep...we keep moving round.

414
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,731
Yes, yes, yes.

415
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,065
As the things get used up.

416
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,002
What happens
when you get back to the beginning?

417
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,836
- Oh!
- Suppose we change the subject.

418
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:34,173
I'm getting dreadfully bored by this.

419
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:37,976
- I vote the young lady tells us a story.
- Oh.

420
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:41,041
- I'm afraid I don't know one.
- Oh.

421
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,314
Then the Dormouse will.

422
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:51,993
I wasn't asleep.
I heard every word you fellows were saying.

423
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,587
Tell us a story!

424
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:57,498
You'd better get on with it, otherwise
you'll fall asleep again before you're done.

425
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,128
- (Insects buzz )
- Heh-heh-heh.

426
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:04,470
Once upon a time
there were three little sisters.

427
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,975
Oh, yes.

428
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:11,744
They were named Elsie, Lacie and Tillie...

429
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,340
(Chuckles )

430
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,149
..and they lived at the bottom of a well.

431
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,849
- What did they live on?
- Ah.

432
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,859
(Insects buzz )

433
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:31,034
- They lived on...treacle.
- They couldn't have done that, you know.

434
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,593
- They'd have been ill.
- Aye, they were.

435
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,901
<i>V</i>ery, very ill.

436
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,271
But why did they live at the bottom of a well?

437
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,606
Oh.

438
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:44,739
- Take some more tea.
- I've had nothing yet, so I can't take more.

439
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:49,344
What you mean is you can't take less.
It's very easy to take more than nothing.

440
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:54,517
- Nobody asked for your opinion.
- Now who's making personal remarks, eh?

441
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,494
- (Chuckles )
- (Insects buzz )

442
00:34:58,563 --> 00:34:59,860
Oh.

443
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,157
Why did they live at the bottom of a well?

444
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,433
- It was a treacle well.
- There's no such thing.

445
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:15,378
If you cannot be civil,
you tell the story yourself.

446
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:19,382
I won't interrupt again.
I dare say there may be one.

447
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,509
Oh, indeed!

448
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,856
Well...

449
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:31,657
the three little sisters,
they were all learning to draw, you know.

450
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,959
What did they draw?

451
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,465
(Others ) Treacle.

452
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,764
Oh.

453
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,200
(Insects buzz )

454
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,969
I don't understand.
Where did they draw the treacle from?

455
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:55,246
You draw water from a water well. You draw
treacle from a treacle well, eh, stupid?

456
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,116
But they were in the well.

457
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,317
Well in.

458
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,326
(Guffaws )

459
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,387
(Chuckles )

460
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,591
(Grunts )

461
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,896
Then they learnt to draw.

462
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:22,638
And they always drew
something beginning with an M.

463
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:25,773
- Why an M?
- Why not?

464
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,944
(Insects buzz )

465

Everything beginning with an M...

00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,898
Money.

468
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,066
Memory.

469
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,235
And muchness.

470
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:59,810
I bet you never saw anything
like the drawing of a muchness.

- Really, now you say it, I don't...
- Then you shouldn't talk.

<i>Why are you painting those roses?</i>

476
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,134
Why are you painting those roses?

477
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,676
What's that? What's that?

478
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,703
Will you hold that book steady?
I can't see to paint.

479
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:33,978
- What are you doing it for?
- Doing it for?

480
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,212
- Yes.
- Yes.

481
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,085
Yes, what am I doing it for?

482
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,989
Yes, well, that is the question, isn't it?

483
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,961
Ah. You see? It's no good.

484
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,498
It's all a problem of color, you see.

485
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:54,562
The, er...problem of these being colored white
when red was what was asked for.

486
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,335
- Who's to know?
- Oh! Oh, yes, that's good.

487
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,069
Ha-ha-ha! Yes, I like that.

488
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:02,806
Ha-ha-ha! Yes, who's to know?
The Queen, that's who.

489
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,212
The Queen doesn't miss a trick.

490
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,376
It doesn't look much like a red rose to me.

491
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:11,046
Oh, well, perhaps you'd like
to have a go at it yourself, then.

492
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,682
Yes, perhaps you'd like to
have a go at it yourself.

493
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,886
I think we can do without any help from you,

Ah, yes. And who's this?

- Yes, who is this?
- Or perhaps I shouldn't ask.

(Burbles )

502
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:53,815
Idiot. Absolute idiot.
You've got an absolute idiot for a son.

503
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,018
Yes, but he's tall. He's very tall.

504
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,357
Come along, child, speak up.
What's your name?

505
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:01,159
- My name is Alice.
- Ah. Oh.

506
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,802
- Er...
- And who are these?

507
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,806
- Or perhaps I shouldn't ask.
- How should I know? It's no business of mine.

508
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,808
You little hussy. Off with her head.

509
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,867
Nonsense.

510
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,707
(Men sob)

511
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,774
Ah, yes. And what have you been doing here?
Or perhaps I shouldn't ask.

512
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,546
Or perhaps I should.

513
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,646
Ha-ha! Painting white roses red, hm?

514
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,918
Perhaps you have an explanation?

515
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:32,520
Well, ma'am,
it's by way of rectifying a mistake.

516
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:37,932
What I've always said is what the eye don't see
the heart don't grieve over.

517
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:41,961
I think that's for me to judge.
Off with their heads.

518
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:46,373
- (Drum roll)
- It's a very fine day.

- <i>V</i>ery. Where's the Duchess?
- She's under sentence of execution.

520
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,814
- What for?
- She boxed the Queen's ears. Whoops.

521
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,516
All right!

522
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,576
Get to your places!

523
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,552
You heard what she said.

<i>(Alice whispers) How are you getting on?</i>

I don't think they play at all fairly.

<i>How do you like the Queen?</i>

533
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,478
Not at all.

00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:23,979
(Trumpet fanfare )

535
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,881
- Who are you talking to?
- It's a friend of mine.

536
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,612
I don't like the look of it at all.

537
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:33,452
- A cat may look at a queen.
- Cats are allowed to do that.

538
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,719
It must be removed. Executioner!

539
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:40,287
About that cat.
I want its head taken off. Right off.

540
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:43,356
Yeah, well, you've got a problem there,
haven't you?

541
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:47,130
I mean, with regard to cutting off a head,
you got a real problem,

542
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,604
unless there's a body to cut it off from.

543
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,368
I mean, you see what I mean.

544
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:56,777
Don't talk nonsense.
Anything that has a head can be beheaded.

545
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,474
Anyway, who does it belong to?

546
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:01,177
It belongs to the Duchess
and you'd better ask her about it.

547
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,845
- Ha-ha.
- Oh.

548
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,827
(Birdsong)

549
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:24,607
Oh! You can't think how glad I am to see you,
you dear old thing!

550
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:31,344
You're thinking about something
and that makes you forget to talk.

551
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:35,476
I can't remember the moral of that,
but I shall remember it in a moment.

552
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,247
<i>Perhaps it hasn't got a moral.</i>

553
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:43,351
Tut-tut! My dear child, everything's got
a moral, if only you can find it.

554
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:45,588
<i>The game seems to be</i>
<i>coming on much better now.</i>

Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

556
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:54,266
And the moral of it is...
'tis love, 'tis love makes the world go round.

557
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,738
<i>I thought it was done by everybody</i>
<i>minding their own business.</i>

558
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:59,537
Oh! Well, yes.

559
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,238
Well, it means much the same thing.

560
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,643
And the moral of that is,

561
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:07,980
take care of the sense
and the sounds will take care of themselves.

562
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,212
<i>Oh, she's jolly fond of finding morals.</i>

563
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:13,256
I dare say you're wondering
why I don't put my arm round your waist.

564
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:18,886
Well, the reason is I'm doubtful
of the temper of your flamingo.

565
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,589
<i>I haven't got a flamingo any more.</i>

566
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:25,226
How true, how true!
Flamingos and mustard, both bite.

567
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:30,433
And the moral of that is,
birds of a feather flock together!

568
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:33,032
<i>But mustard isn't a bird.</i>

569
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:38,412
Right as usual. You do have
a nice clear way of putting things.

570
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:40,006
<i>It's a mineral, I think.</i>

571
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:44,782
Yes, of course it is, and there's
a rather large mustard mine quite near here.

572
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:47,255
Ha-ha! And the moral of it is,

573
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:51,158
the more there is of mine,
the less there is of your'n.

574
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:54,425
<i>I know, it's a vegetable.</i>
<i>It doesn't look like one but it is.</i>

575
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,193
I quite agree with you.

576
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,997
And the moral of that is,
be what you'd seem to be.

577
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,334
Or if you would like it put more simply,

578
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:05,534
never imagine yourself not to be otherwise

579
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,577
than what it would appear to others

580
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:12,240
that what you were and
what you might have been is not otherwise...

581
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,978
(Chuckles ) ..than what you have been.

582
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,987
<i>I think I'd understand that a bit better</i>
<i>if I had it written down,</i>

583
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,751
<i>and I'm afraid</i>
<i>I can't quite follow it as you say it.</i>

584
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:25,488
Oh! I could say much better
than that if I chose.

585
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,395
<i>Please don't trouble yourself</i>
<i>to say it any longer than that.</i>

586
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:32,561
Don't talk about trouble. I'll make you
a present of everything I've said as yet.

587
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,628
<i>A cheap sort of present, I must say.</i>

588
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,504
- Thinking again?
- <i>I have a right to think.</i>

589
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:42,944
About as much right as pigs have to fly.
And the moral...

590
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,345
(Applause in distance )

591
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:51,652
Either you or your head must be off
in the next five minutes!

592
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,747
Take your choice.

593
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:14,409
She'll be the death of me.
Come on, let's get on with the game.

594
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:20,106
(Funeral march plays )

595
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,422
Well, here we are.

596
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,864
- What's happened to them?
- They're going to be executed.

597
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:40,460
- What do you mean?
- They're going to have their heads taken off.

598
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,995
- What, all of them?
- Yes, the whole lot.

599
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:47,339
There's no point spoiling the ship
for a ha'porth of tar.

600
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:50,403
- Have you seen the Mock Turtle?
- No, who's that?

601
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,314
Hm, you'd better ask the Gryphon about that.
He would be able to let you know.

602
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,352
(Seagulls cry )

603
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:02,990
That's just her fantasy.
She never executes anyone.

604
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,790
Ah, there he is.

605
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:09,855
- What's he so sad about?
- That's just his fantasy.

606
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,800
He's got nothing to be sad about, really.

607
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:26,978
This young lady
wants to hear your life history.

608
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:30,849
All right. I'll tell it to her.

609
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,413
But don't speak a word till I finish.

610
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,366
But how can he finish if he doesn't begin?

611
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:55,241
Shh. He's got to get into the mood.

612
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:12,054
When we were little,
we all went to school in the sea.

613
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:17,066
The master was an old turtle -
we used to call him Tortoise...

614
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,568
Why did you call him Tortoise
if he wasn't one?

615
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,072
We called him Tortoise because he taught us.
Really, you are very dull.

616
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,337
Ashamed of you asking
such a simple question as that.

617
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,639
We had the best of educations.

618
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:31,545
In fact we went to school every day.

619
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,379
I've been to a day school too.
It's nothing to be so proud about.

620
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:37,784
- With extras?
- Yes, we learned French and music.

621
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,754
And washing?

622
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,688
- Certainly not.
- Aha.

623
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:44,420
Well, then, yours wasn't really a good school.

624
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:52,833
At our school we always had at the end
of the bill, music, French and washing...extra.

625
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,971
But I couldn't afford to learn it.
I only took the regular course.

626
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,531
What was that?

627
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,668
Reeling and writhing, of course, to begin with,

628
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:04,145
and then there were
the different branches of Arithmetic,

629
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:09,117
Ambition, Distraction,
Uglification and Derision.

630
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,620
I never heard of Uglification before.

631
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,486
Never heard of uglify?

632
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:17,618
- You've heard of beautifying, I suppose?
- Yes.

633
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,218
Need I say more?

634
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:23,198
Then there was Mystery, ancient and modern,

635
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:25,393
and then Drawling.

636
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:29,234
That was with the Drawling master.
He used to come once a week.

637
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:33,333
He taught us Drawling, Stretching,

638
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,742
and Fainting in Coils.

639
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:37,404
What was that like?

640
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,108
I couldn't possibly show you myself.
I'm much too stiff.

641
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,811
And he never learnt it.

642
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,378
I hadn't time.
But I went to the Classical master.

643
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:49,323
Mm, I never went to him.

644
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:53,226
He taught Laughing and Grief, or so they said.

645
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,328
So he did, so he did.

646
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:10,975
- How many hours a day did you do lessons?
- Ten hours the first day.

647
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,208
- Nine the second.
- And so on.

648
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,581
- How odd.
- Not odd at all.

649
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:19,520
That's why they're called lessons,
because they lessen from day to day.

650
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,117
Then the eleventh day
must have been a holiday.

651
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,592
So it was.

652
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,755
So it was.

653
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,924
But then how did you manage on the 12th day?

654
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,495
Oh, that's enough about lessons.
Tell her about the games.

655
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,403
Have you ever done the Lobster Quadrille?

656
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,243
No. What sort of a dance is that?

657
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:45,110
Well, first you form a line along the seashore.

658
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:48,844
No, two lines. Then after you've cleared
the jellyfish out of the way...

659
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:50,715
That generally takes some time.

660
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,221
- ..you advance twice.
- Each with a lobster as a partner.

661
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,782
You advance twice, set to partners...

662
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,954
Change lobsters and retire in the same order.

663
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,491
It must be a very pretty dance.

664
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:07,366
- Would you like to hear some of it?
- <i>V</i>ery much indeed.

665
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:08,768
Well, we'll sing.

666
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:11,568
Oh, you sing it. I can't remember the words.

667
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:18,241
# Will you walk a little faster?
Said the whiting to the snail

668
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:23,184
# There's a porpoise close behind me
And he's treading on my tail

669
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:27,053
# See how eagerly the lobsters
And the turtles all advance!

670
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:30,820
# They are waiting on the shingle
Won't you come and join the dance?

671
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:34,557
# Will you, won't you, will you, won't you
Will you join the dance?

672
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:40,628
# Will you, won't you, will you, won't you
Won't you join the dance?

673
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:46,840
# You can really have no notion
How delightful it will be

674
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:50,937
# When they take us up and throw us
With the lobsters out to sea

675
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,209
# But the snail replied

676
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,513
# ''Too far, too far!''

677
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:56,950
# And gave a look askance

678
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:02,151
# Said he thanked the whiting kindly
But he would not join the dance

679
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:05,683
# Would not, could not, could not, would not
Could not join the dance

680
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:08,322
# Could not, would not...

681
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,730
# Could not, would not

682
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,429
# Would not join

683
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,335
# The dance #

684
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,671
- (Seagulls cry )
- <i>(Whispers) The trial's beginning.</i>

685
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,046
<i>The trial's beginning.</i>

686
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,588
(Hymn begins )

687
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:42,023
(Hymn continues )

688
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:12,554
(Hymn continues )

689
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,357
(Cough)

690
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:53,902
(Hymn continues )

691
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,873
(Hymn ends )

692
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:35,143
- Who are they?
- The jury.

693
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:36,508
What are they doing?

694
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:40,777
Taking down their names in case
they forget them before the trial ends.

695
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,943
- (Chicken clucking)
- Stupid things.

696
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,414
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- (Gavel bangs )

697
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:49,287
- Silence in court!
- (Coughing)

698
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,884
- (Chicken clucking)
- Read the accusation.

699
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:54,657
The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
All on a summer's day:

700
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:58,895
The <i>K</i>nave of Hearts, he stole those tarts
And took them quite away!

701
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,629
- (Chicken clucking)
- Consider your verdict.

702
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:04,002
Not yet, not yet!
There's a great deal to do before that!

703
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,007
- (Chicken clucking)
- Is there? Oh, dear.

704
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:08,373
Well, um...er...

705
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:11,072
call the first witness.

706
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:14,075
First witness.

707
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,517
- (Chicken clucking)
- (Coughing)

708
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,487
(Mad Hatter chuckles )

709
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,689
Good morning.

710
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:26,058
Hello.

711
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:27,653
(Chuckles )

712
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:35,696
Come on, come on.

713
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,501
Oh, yes.

714
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,371
(Horse whinnies )

715
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:41,774
Come on! Come along!

716
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:47,949
(Horse whinnies )

717
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:58,827
- (Mad Hatter laughing)
- (Horse whinnies )

718
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:02,831
Oh, I beg your pardon, Your Majesty,
for bringing these along,

719
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:07,893
but I hadn't quite finished my tea
when I was sent for.

720
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:11,463
Well, you ought to have finished.
When did you begin?

721
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,600
The, er...

722
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:16,611
Let me see. I think it was the, er...

723
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:20,115
- 14th of March.
- 15th.

724
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:22,310
- 16th?
- Yes.

725
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,649
16th. Write that down.

726
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:27,884
And take off your hat.

727
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,687
Ah...it, um...it...

728
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,091
Oh, dear.

729
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,721
It is...it isn't...it isn't mine.

730
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,788
- It's, er...
- (Clucking)

731
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:38,163
Stolen, is it?

732
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:40,293
No, no, no. I, er...

733
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,861
I keep them to sell, Your Majesty, you see.

734
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,100
I'm a...I'm a hatter.

735
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,641
- A very nervous hatter.
- Yes, I am, yes.

736
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:51,441
- Well, don't be nervous.
- No.

737
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:56,781
Don't be nervous. Just give your evidence,
or I shall have you executed, you know.

738
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:59,378
I'm...I'm allowed to do that.

739
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:02,390
- I can have anyone executed.
- Yes, yes.

740
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,085
I have the power...power.

741
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,529
Ah...I'm a very poor man, Your Majesty.

742
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:11,692
And I hadn't begun my tea...

743
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:14,100
well, not above a week or so,

744
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,968
and what with the bread and butter
getting so thin...

745
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,032
- (Chicken clucking)
- ..and the twinkling of tea, I...

746
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:23,476
- Tinkling of the what?
- Er...it began with the tea.

747
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:26,606
Oh! I know that.

748
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,119
I'm not a fool.
I know that twinkling begins with a T.

749
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:33,383
- Oh.
- I'm not a complete idiot, am I?

750
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,083
- (Clears throat)
- Go on, go on.

751
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:39,288
Like I said, Your Majesty,
I'm a...I'm a poor man

752
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,559
and, um...most things twinkled after that.

753
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:44,793
- I didn't.
- You did.

754
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,961
- I didn't. I deny it.
- He denies it.

755
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,631
- (Clucking)
- Leave out that part.

756
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:55,667
After that, I, er...
I cut some bread and butter and...

757
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:57,110
And after that, what happened?

758
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,616
Ah, that...that I can't remember.

759
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:04,346
Yes, yes, well, you must remember it,
or I'll have to have you executed.

760
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,685
I'm a...I'm a poor man, Your Majesty.

761
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:11,022
You are a jolly poor speaker, that's for sure.

762
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:14,461
Get down, sit down and stand clear away.

763
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:17,556
(Chuckles ) Oh, thank you.

764
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:20,295
God bless you, Your Majesty. Ha-ha-ha!

765
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:23,304
- (Chicken clucking)
- (Mad Hatter chuckling)

766
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:27,238
Excuse me.

767
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:31,440
I do hope you manage
to get the funds to pay it.

768
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:34,142
- (Chicken clucking)
- Next witness.

769
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,189
- Give your evidence.
- Shan't.

770
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:51,463
Oh, well, that's the end of that, then.

771
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,227
Aah!

772
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:56,635
Your Majesty must cross-examine
this witness.

773
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:58,731
- Must I?
- Yes.

774
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:00,833
Oh.

775
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:05,910
Oh.

776
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,574
Thank you.

777
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:13,586
What are tarts made of?

778
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,886
- Pepper mostly.
- (Snorts )

779
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:19,384
Anything you want to add to that?

780
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,895
Yes, go away.

781
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,761
Go away with the pepper.

782
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,267
Oh.

783
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:31,602
- Next witness.
- No, don't let's have another witness.

784
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:36,475
Let's have a....let's have a song.

785
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:40,038
Come on, lads, give us a melody.
Come along now.

786
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:43,244
We... We've all rehearsed.

787
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,288
# And we'll all

788
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:50,018
# Swing together

789
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,788
# Britain shall be saved

790
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:56,161
# In all sorts of weather

791
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:58,462
# Come what may

792
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:02,061
# And we'll all swing together

793
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:06,040
# With our bodies between our knees

794
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:09,874
# Yes, we'll all swing together

795
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:15,282
# With our bodies between our knees...

796
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,717
- (Clucking)
- Ah.

797
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:20,483
They don't reach verdicts like that any more.

798
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:22,421
Oh dear.

799
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:24,254
Right.

800
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,295
Next witness.

801
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,758
Alice!

802
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:33,029
Ah. What have you got to say for yourself?

803
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:34,729
Nothing.

804
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,795
- Nothing?
- Nothing whatever.

805
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,568
Oh, that's very important.

806
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:43,306
(Whispers ) Unimportant,
Your Majesty means, of course.

807
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,176
Ah. Oh.

808
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:50,117
Oh. I thought I meant important.
That's what I thought I meant.

809
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,014
Ah. Oh.

810
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:58,290
Oh.

811
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:01,663
Oh.

812
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,756
Ah.

813
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,835
(Snores )

814
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,135
(Hiccups )

815
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:13,698
Ah.

816
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:15,710
(Hums tune )

817
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:18,246
(Snorts )

818
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,680
(Animal roars )

819
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,844
Ahh!

820
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,253
Silence in court! Silence in court!

821
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:28,915
(Cough)

822
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:35,396
All persons more than a mile high
to leave, er...court!

823
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:39,230
- I'm not a mile high.
- Yes, you are.

824
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,463
Nearly two miles high.

825
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:43,334
(Clucking)

826
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:46,068
Consider your silences.

827
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,501
Their verses.

828
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:52,035
No, no, no, no!
There's more evidence to come yet.

829
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,809
This paper's just been picked up.

830
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,681
- What's in it?
- I haven't opened it yet.

831
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:59,687
But it seems to be a letter
written by the prisoner to somebody.

832
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:02,223
Well, it must be that.

833
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:07,319
I mean, it can't just be written to nobody.
I mean, you can't just write to nobody.

834
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:10,229
I mean, if you did that all the time, the...

835
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:13,268
Well, I mean
the post office'd come to a standstill.

836
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,327
I mean, you've got to have somebody...

837
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:18,862
I mean, well...

838
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,102
Well, it's not allowed.

839
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:22,735
Who's it directed to?

840
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:27,010
It isn't directed at all. In fact,
there's nothing written on the outside.

841
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,778
(Coughing)

842
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:33,288
It isn't a letter at all. It's a set of verses.

843
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:36,291
- Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?
- No, they're not.

844
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:39,157
And that's the queerest thing about it.

845
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:45,428
You've been imitating people's hands
and writings again.

846
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,469
(Oinks ) Please, Your Majesty.

847
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:49,902
I didn't...

848
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:52,600
(Oinks ) ..write it.

849
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:56,042
And I can... (Oinks ) ..prove that I didn't.

850
01:06:56,112 --> 01:07:00,640
(Oinks ) There's no name signed at the end.

851
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:03,480
(<i>K</i>ing of Hearts ) Well, that only makes
the matter worse.

852
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:05,179
You must have meant some mischief

853
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:09,315
or else you would have signed your name
like an honest man.

854
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:12,691
- (Queen of Hearts ) That proves his guilt.
- It proves nothing of the sort.

855
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,730
- Hold your tongue.
- I won't.

856
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:18,324
- (Clucking)
- Off with her head! Off with her head!

857
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:22,201
Off with her head! Off with her head!

858
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:26,632
Off with her head! Off with her head!

859
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,007
Off with her head!

860
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:32,639
Off with her head! Off with her head!

861
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,814
- (Birds screech)
- (Church bell tolls)

862
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,175
It is not now as it has been of yore;-

863
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,879
Turn wheresoe'er I may
By night or day

864
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:16,357
The things which I have seen
I now can see no more
