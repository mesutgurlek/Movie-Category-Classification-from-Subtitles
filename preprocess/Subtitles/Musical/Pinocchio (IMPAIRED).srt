When you wish upon a star

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,013

00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:52,752
If your heart is in your dream

No request is too extreme

When you wish upon a star

8
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:07,844
As dreamers do

9
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:12,815
Fate is kind

10
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:17,684
She brings to those who love

11
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:22,089
The sweet fulfillment of

12
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,655
Their secret longing

13
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:38,534
Like a bolt out of the blue

14
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:46,243
Fate steps in
and sees you through

15
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:53,018
When you wish upon a star

16
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,423
Your dreams

17
00:01:56,494 --> 00:02:03,622
Come true

18
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,488
Pretty, huh?

19
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:10,255
I'll bet a lot of you folks
don't believe that,

20
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:13,423
about a wish coming true,
do you?

21
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:15,433
Well, I didn't either.

22
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,561
Of course, I'm just a cricket
singing my way from hearth to hearth,

23
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:22,630
but... let me tell you
what made me change my mind.

24
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,185
One night a long time... ahem.

25
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:39,656
Pardon me.
Wait'll I fix this thing.

26
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:40,885
There.

27
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,588
One night a long time ago...

28
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:47,689
my travels took me
to a quaint little village.

29
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:49,757
It was a beautiful night.

30
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:51,996
The stars were shining
like diamonds...

31
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,199
high above the roofs
of that sleepy old town.

32
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,970
Pretty as a picture.

33
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:04,209
As I wandered
along the crooked streets,

34
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:06,547
there wasn't a soul to be seen.

35
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:09,246
The only sign of life
was a lighted window...

36
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:12,916
in the shop of a wood-carver
named... Geppetto.

37
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:15,926
So I hopped over...

38
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,323
and looked in.

39
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:27,668
It was a shame to see a nice cheerful
fire like that going to waste.

40
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,573
So what do I do?

41
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:32,633
I go in!

42
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:38,749
I looked around.

43
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:43,120
Of course, being in
a strange place like that,

44
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:45,486
I didn't know what to expect.

45
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:48,526
A cricket can't be
too careful, you know.

46
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:55,825
Soon as I saw there was no one about,
I made myself at home.

47
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:18,445
As I stood there warming my...
myself, I took a look around.

48
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:22,226
Well, sir, you never saw
such a place.

49
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,124
The most fantastic clocks
you ever laid your eyes on,

50
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:27,596
and all carved out of wood.

51
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:31,658
And cute little music boxes,
each one a work of art.

52
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:34,170
And shelf after shelf of toys and...

53
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:37,665
And then something else
caught my eye.

54
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:39,733
A puppet!

55
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,179

00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:18,081
The gift of life is thine.

170
00:16:25,196 --> 00:16:28,632
Whew! What they
can't do these days.

171
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,770
I can move! I can talk!

172
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:40,910
I can walk!

173
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:45,980
- Yes, Pinocchio, I've given you life.
- Why?

174
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,884
Because tonight Geppetto
wished for a real boy.

175
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:51,319
Am I a real boy?

176
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:54,358
No, Pinocchio. To make
Geppetto's wish come true...

177
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:58,225
- will be entirely up to you.
- Up to me?

178
00:16:58,296 --> 00:17:00,662
Prove yourself brave,

179
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:04,167
truthful and unselfish,

180
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:07,170
- and someday you will be a real boy.
- A real boy!

181
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:09,001
That won't be easy.

182
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:11,507
You must learn to choose
between right and wrong.

183
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:14,875
Right... and wrong?
But how will I know?

184
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:18,006
- How'll he know!
- Your conscience will tell you.

185
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:23,019
- What are conscience?
- What are conscience! I'll tell ya!

186
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:27,046
A conscience is that still,
small voice people won't listen to.

187
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,185
That's just the trouble
with the world today.

188
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:33,059
- Are you my conscience?
- Who, me?

189
00:17:33,131 --> 00:17:36,862
Would you like to be
Pinocchio's conscience?

190
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:38,595
Well...

191
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:40,967
uh, I, l...

Uh-huh.

193
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:46,768
Very well!
What is your name?

194
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:50,803
Oh, Cricket's the name.
Jiminy Cricket.

195
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:54,443
- Kneel, Mr. Cricket.
- Huh?

196
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:57,520
No tricks now.

197
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:59,556
I dub you Pinocchio's conscience.

198
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:03,082
Lord high keeper of the
knowledge of right and wrong,

199
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:05,686
counselor in moments
of temptation...

200
00:18:05,763 --> 00:18:08,823
and guide along the
straight and narrow path.

201
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,425
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.

202
00:18:11,502 --> 00:18:15,598
Well! Ho-ho-ho! My, my!

203
00:18:15,673 --> 00:18:19,473
Mmm! Say, that's pretty swell.

204
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:21,512
Gee... thanks!

205
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:24,844
But... don't I get
a badge or somethin'?

206
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,315
We'll see.

207
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:30,310
- You mean, maybe I will?
- I shouldn't wonder.

208
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,309
- Make it a gold one?
- Maybe.

209
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:35,109
Now remember, Pinocchio,
be a good boy.

210
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:39,016
And always let your conscience
be your guide.

211
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,518
Good-bye, milady.

212

Not bad, says I.

215
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:55,491
Oh, yeah! Ho-ho-ho!
Almost forgot about you.

216
00:18:55,569 --> 00:19:00,666
Well, Pinoke, maybe you and I had better
have a little heart-to-heart talk.

217
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:02,572
Why?

218
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:06,100
- Well, you want to be
a real boy, don't you?
- Uh-huh.

219
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,239
All right, sit down, son.

220
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,218
Now, you see,

221
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:16,881
- the world is full of temptations.
- Temptations?

222
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,948
Yep! Temptations.

223
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:21,824
They're the wrong things
that seem right at the time,

224
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:25,991
but... even though the right things
may seem wrong sometimes,

sometimes the wrong things,
[Chuckle]

226
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:33,666
May be right at the wrong time,
or... visa versa.

227

Ahem. Understand?

Uh-uh.

229
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,177
But I'm gonna do right!

230

Attaboy, Pinoke,
and I'm gonna help ya!

231
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,686
And anytime you need me,
you know, just whistle...

No, no.
Try it again, Pinoke.

- Like this? [Blows Air]
- No, son.

Now listen!

Come on, now.
Let's sing it!

239
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:13,869
When you get in trouble
and you don't know right from wrong

240
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,972
Give a little whistle
[Whistle]

When you meet temptation
and the urge is very strong

Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle

Not just a little squeak
Pucker up and blow

- And if your whistle's weak, yell
- Jiminy Cricket?

Right!
Take the straight and narrow path

give a little whistle

00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:38,829
And besides, tomorrow
you've got to go to school.

329
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,834
Why?

330
00:26:40,902 --> 00:26:44,838
Oh, to learn things...

331
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:47,602
and get smart.

332
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:49,734
[Pinocchio]
Why?

333
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:54,407
Ahh... because.

334
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:57,383
[Pinocchio]
Oh.

335
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:37,824
[Laughter]

336
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:53,406
Oh, look, Father. Look!

337
00:27:53,474 --> 00:27:56,136
- Wait! Stand still now.
- What are those?

338
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,610
Huh? Oh, those!

339
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,342
They are your schoolmates,
girls and boys. Now get in.

340
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:02,310
They are your schoolmates,
girls and boys. Now get in.

341
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:04,312
- Real boys?
- Yes!

342
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,315
But hurry now.
Oh, wait, wait!

343
00:28:11,653 --> 00:28:14,520
Here's an apple for the teacher.

344
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,616
Now turn around
and let me look you over.

345
00:28:17,693 --> 00:28:19,627
[Chuckling]

346
00:28:19,695 --> 00:28:23,495
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.
Here.

347
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:25,897
Run along now.

348
00:28:29,538 --> 00:28:32,029
Ho-ho-ho, wait, wait.

349
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:35,565
Come back here, Figaro.

350
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:38,978
School is not for you.

351
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:42,108
Good-bye, Father!

352
00:28:42,184 --> 00:28:44,152
Good-bye, son. Hurry back.

353
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,986
Tra-la-la-la
La-la-la

354
00:28:49,124 --> 00:28:51,422
[Laughing]

355
00:28:51,493 --> 00:28:55,691
Ah, Gideon, listen.
The merry laughter...

356
00:28:55,764 --> 00:28:59,461
of little innocent children
wending their way to school.

357
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:04,165
Thirsty little minds rushing
to the fountain of knowledge.

358
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:07,640
School, a noble institution.

359
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:10,974
What would this
stupid world be without...

360
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:16,740
Well, well, well!
Stromboli!

361
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:20,016
So that old rascal's
back in town, eh?

362
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:24,048
Remember, Giddy, the time
I tied strings on you...

363
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:27,960
and passed you off as a puppet?

364
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:33,468
We nearly put one over
on that old gypsy that time!

365
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:36,834
[Laughing]

366
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:40,238
A little wooden boy.
Now, who...

367
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:43,437
A wooden boy!

368
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:46,774
Look, Giddy, look.

369
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:50,114
It's amazing.

370
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:52,653
A live puppet without strings.

371
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:55,622
A thing like that ought to
be worth a fortune to someone.

372
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:58,489
Now let me see.

373
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,085
That's it! Stromboli!

374
00:30:01,163 --> 00:30:04,690
Why, that old faker
would give his... Listen.

375
00:30:04,766 --> 00:30:07,064
If we play our cards right,

376
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:12,233
we'll be on easy street
or my name isn't Honest John.

377
00:30:12,307 --> 00:30:14,707
Quick!
We'll head him off.

378
00:30:29,057 --> 00:30:32,083
Shh! Now's our...

379
00:30:33,428 --> 00:30:35,419
No, no, stupid.

380
00:30:35,497 --> 00:30:38,625
- Don't be crude.
- [Hiccups]

381
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,828
Let me handle this.
Here he comes.

382
00:30:41,904 --> 00:30:46,341
Ah, yes, Giddy, as I was saying
to the duchess only yesterday...

383
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:48,941
Oh!
Oh, how clumsy of me!

384
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:51,002
My, my, my, my.

385
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:54,938
[Honest John]
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

386
00:30:55,017 --> 00:30:58,509
- I do hope you're not injured.
- I'm all right.

387
00:30:58,587 --> 00:31:01,852
Ah, splendid!

388
00:31:01,924 --> 00:31:06,361
Well, well.
Quite a scholar, I see.

389
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:09,556
Look, Giddy, a man of letters.

390
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:13,130
- Here's your book.
- I'm going to school.

391
00:31:13,202 --> 00:31:15,534
School! Ah, yes.

392
00:31:15,604 --> 00:31:19,062
Then you haven't heard
of the easy road to success.

393
00:31:19,141 --> 00:31:21,234
- Uh-uh.
- No?

394
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,940
I'm speaking, my boy, of the theater!
Here's your apple.

395
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:29,006
Bright lights, music, applause!

396
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:31,985
- Fame!
- Fame?

397
00:31:32,054 --> 00:31:37,549
Yes! And with that personality,
that profile, that physique...

398
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:41,460
Why he's a natural born actor,
eh, Giddy?

399
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,657
- But I'm going...
- Straight to the top.

400
00:31:43,732 --> 00:31:47,725
I can see your name in lights,
lights six feet high.

401
00:31:47,803 --> 00:31:49,998
- What is your name?
- Pinocchio.

402
00:31:50,072 --> 00:31:55,339
Pinocchio!
P-l-N-U-O... Uh...

403
00:31:56,745 --> 00:31:58,713
We're wasting precious time.

404
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,248
Come. On to the theater!

405
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:04,752
Hi diddle dee dee

and a silver cane

407
00:32:07,022 --> 00:32:09,183
A watch of gold
with a diamond chain

408
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:12,921
Hi diddle de day
An actor's life is gay

00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:17,591

Whew! Fine conscience
I turned out to be!

417
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:45,416
Late the first day.

418
00:32:45,494 --> 00:32:50,363
Oh, well, he can't get in much trouble
between here and school.

00:32:59,975 --> 00:33:02,808
A waxed moustache and a beaver coat
A pony cart and a billy goat

423
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:06,673
Why, it's... it's Pinoke!
Hey, where you going?

424
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:11,300
- Wait!
- You ride around in a coach and four

425
00:33:11,378 --> 00:33:13,539
- You stop and buy out a candy store
- Halt!

426
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:15,581
- An actor's life for me
- Hold on there! Pinoke!

427
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:19,517
Hi diddle dee dee
An actor's life for me

428
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:22,885
- With clothes that come
from the finest shop
- Hey!

429
00:33:22,956 --> 00:33:25,186
- [Whistle]
- What was that?

430
00:33:25,258 --> 00:33:29,661
- Oh, it's Jiminy!
Whatcha doin' up there?
- Huh? Who? Wh-What?

431
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,290
[Honest John]
Jiminy? Up where?

432
00:33:32,366 --> 00:33:34,300
Shh.

433
00:33:34,368 --> 00:33:39,169
- You must be seeing things.
- Oh, no, that's my conscience.

434
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:42,675
Now, now, now. Just calm down.

435
00:33:42,743 --> 00:33:46,679
Why, there's nothing up there
to be afraid of.

436
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:53,848
[Groaning]

437
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,151
[Muffled Mumbling]

438
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:01,827
Psst! [Whistle]
Pinoke!

Psst. Pinoke?

Over here.

441
00:34:05,332 --> 00:34:07,766
Over here.

442
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:10,268
Oh, Jiminy,
I'm gonna be an actor!

443
00:34:10,337 --> 00:34:12,464
All right, son.
Take it easy now.

444
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:16,100
- Remember what I said about temptation?
- Uh-huh.

445
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:19,407
- Well, that's him.
- Oh, no, Jiminy.

446
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:22,846
- That's Mr. Honest John!
- Honest John?

447
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:26,784
[Mumbling]

448
00:34:26,853 --> 00:34:29,515
Get me outta here!

449
00:34:45,972 --> 00:34:48,463
Ohh!

450
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:54,580
All right then,
here's what we'll tell 'em.

451
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:58,015
You can't go to the theater.
Say "Thank you just the same."

452
00:34:58,084 --> 00:35:02,214
- You're sorry,
but you've got to go to school.
- Mm-hmm.

453
00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:04,257
[Honest John]
Pinocchio?

454
00:35:04,324 --> 00:35:08,158
Oh, Pinocchio! Woo-hoo.

455
00:35:08,228 --> 00:35:10,355
Here they come.
Now you tell 'em.

456
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,830
Woo-hoo!

457
00:35:12,899 --> 00:35:15,367
Oh, little boy!
There you are!

458
00:35:15,435 --> 00:35:20,099
Where were we?
Ah, yes... on to the theater!

459
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:22,539
[Pinocchio]
Good-bye, Jiminy, good-bye!

460
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:25,703
- Hi diddle dee dee
An actor's life for me
- Huh? Good-bye?

461
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:28,077
- Pinoke, you can't go!
- A high silk hat and a silver cane

462
00:35:28,148 --> 00:35:30,048
- There he goes.
- A watch of gold
with a diamond chain

463
00:35:30,116 --> 00:35:33,574
What'll I do?
I'll run and tell his father.

464
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:37,680
No, that'd be snitching.
I'll go after him myself.

465
00:35:42,929 --> 00:35:45,955
Ladies and gentlemen,

466
00:35:46,032 --> 00:35:49,001
to conclude the performance
of this great show,

467
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:54,371
Stromboli, the master showman...
that's-a me.

468
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:57,899
And by special permission
of the management...

469
00:35:57,978 --> 00:36:01,004
that's-a me too.

470
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:04,346
Is presenting to you something...

471
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:07,250
you will absolutely
refuse to believe!

472
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,586
- [Crowd Murmuring]
- Well, looks like a sellout.

473
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:14,024
Introducing
the only marionette-a...

474
00:36:14,094 --> 00:36:16,255
who can a-sing and a-dance...

475
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:21,824
absolutely without
the aids of a-strings.

476
00:36:21,902 --> 00:36:24,427
I hope-a so.

477
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:29,237
The one... and only...
Pinocchio!

478
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:33,075
- [Applause]
- Hmph! What a buildup.

479
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:46,757
I got no strings
to hold me do...

480
00:36:48,194 --> 00:36:50,594
[Laughter]

481
00:36:50,664 --> 00:36:52,996
Go ahead...
make a fool of yourself!

482
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:55,591
Then maybe you'll listen

00:48:35,716 --> 00:48:37,684
Why, l...

647
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:40,811
Monsters?
Weren't you afraid?

648
00:48:40,888 --> 00:48:43,823
No, ma'am.
But they tied me in a big sack.

649
00:48:45,726 --> 00:48:48,194
You don't say!

650
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:52,198
- And where was Sir Jiminy?
- Huh? Oh, Jiminy?

651
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,200
Psst.
Leave me outta this.

652
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:56,964
They put him in a little sack.

653
00:48:57,037 --> 00:49:00,234
- No!
- Yeah!

654
00:49:00,307 --> 00:49:02,571
- How did you escape?
- I didn't.

655
00:49:02,643 --> 00:49:05,043
They chopped me into firewood!

656
00:49:08,315 --> 00:49:12,718
Oh, look, my nose!
What's happened?

657
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,084
Perhaps you haven't been
telling the truth, Pinocchio.

658
00:49:15,156 --> 00:49:19,286
- Perhaps?
- Oh, but I have! Every single word!

659
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:27,698
Oh, please help me.
I'm awful sorry.

660
00:49:27,768 --> 00:49:31,363
You see, Pinocchio,
a lie keeps growing and growing...

661
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:33,872
until it's as plain
as the nose on your face.

662
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:36,466
She's right, Pinoke,
you better come clean.

663
00:49:36,544 --> 00:49:39,775
I'll never lie again,
honest, I won't.

664
00:49:39,847 --> 00:49:43,180
Please, your honor,
uh, I mean... Miss Fairy.

665
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,741
Give him another chance
for my sake.

666
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:48,549
Will ya? Huh?

667
00:49:48,622 --> 00:49:50,954
I'll forgive you this once.

668
00:49:51,025 --> 00:49:53,755
But remember,
a boy who won't be good...

669
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:56,227
might just as well
be made of wood.

[Together]
We'll be good, won't we?

671
00:49:58,732 --> 00:50:02,793
Very well, but this is
the last time I can help you.

672
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:10,905
Gee, look, Jiminy! My nose!

673
00:50:10,978 --> 00:50:13,913
Hey, we're free.
Come on, Pinoke.

00:50:13,981 --> 00:50:17,212
[Stromboli] I buy-a new suit

I got-a no strings on me

677

Toodle-ooo, Stromboli.

678
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:26,455
- Good-bye, Mr. Stromboli.
- Shh! Quiet!

A watch of gold
with a diamond chain

Hi diddle dee day
An actor's life is gay

It's great to be a celebrity

[Honest John]
And he still thinks we're his friends!

690
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:12,564
And did Stromboli pay!

That shows you how low
Honest John will stoop.

what's your proposition?

how would you blokes
like to make some real money?

No, no!

Nothing like that.

You see...

704
00:51:57,318 --> 00:52:00,879
I'm collecting stupid little boys.

Stupid little boys?

706

You know, the disobedient ones
what play hooky from school.

Ohh!

No, no. There is no risk!

Now... I've got a coach load
leaving at midnight.

We'll meet at the crossroads
and no double-crossing!

- No, sir.
- Scout around.

- Any good prospects you find,
bring 'em to me.
- Yes, chief.

- I'll pay you well.
I got plenty of gold.
- Yes, yes.

No, sir, nothing can stop me now.
I'll make good this time.

- You'd better!
- I will. I'm going to school.

That's the stuff, Pinoke.

725
00:53:17,956 --> 00:53:20,015
I'd rather be smart
than be an actor.

Now you're talkin'!
Come on, slowpoke. I'll race ya home.

- Well, how is the great actor?
- I don't want to be an actor.

730
00:53:42,113 --> 00:53:44,638
- Stromboli was terrible!
- He was?

731
00:53:44,716 --> 00:53:46,445
Yeah, he locked me in a bird cage.

732
00:53:46,517 --> 00:53:49,680
- He did?
- Uh-huh, but I learned my lesson.

That's it!
You are a nervous wreck.

Ahem. We must
diagnose this case at once.

My, my. Just as I thought.

740
00:54:13,578 --> 00:54:15,773
A slight touch
of monetary complications...

741
00:54:15,847 --> 00:54:18,577
with bucolic semi-lunar contraptions
of the flying trapezes.

and nobody says a word.

00:58:01,205 --> 00:58:03,696
[Barker] Hurry, hurry, hurry.
See the model home.

802
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:08,768
It's open for destruction and it's
all yours, boys! She's all yours.

803
00:58:13,551 --> 00:58:16,179
What'd I tell ya?
Ain't this a swell joint?

804
00:58:16,254 --> 00:58:19,417
Yeah! Being bad's
a lot of fun, ain't it?

805
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:22,721
Yeah, uh-huh. Get a load
of that stained-glass window.

806
00:58:28,065 --> 00:58:31,466
All right, now.
Hop to it, you blokes.

807
00:58:31,536 --> 00:58:34,232
- [Whip Cracking]
- Come on! Come on!

808
00:58:34,305 --> 00:58:37,001
Shut the doors and lock 'em tight.

809
00:58:37,074 --> 00:58:40,202
Now get below
and get them crates ready.

810
00:58:40,278 --> 00:58:45,580
Give a bad boy enough rope and he'll
soon make a jackass of himself.

811
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,948
[Wicked Laugh]

812
00:58:52,857 --> 00:58:56,054
[Jiminy]
Pinocchio!

813
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,322
Pinocchio?

814
00:58:58,396 --> 00:59:00,387
[Whistle]

815
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:05,769
Where is everybody?

816
00:59:07,405 --> 00:59:09,839
The place is like a graveyard.

817
00:59:09,907 --> 00:59:12,603
I don't like the looks of this.

818
00:59:12,677 --> 00:59:15,339
Pinocchio!

819
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:20,041
Hey, where are you?

820
00:59:24,088 --> 00:59:27,353
[Whistling]

821
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,935
Where do you suppose
all the kids went to, Lampwick?

822
00:59:39,003 --> 00:59:41,062
They're around here somewheres.

823
00:59:41,138 --> 00:59:43,663
What do you care?

824
00:59:45,309 --> 00:59:49,245
- You're havin' a good time, ain't ya?
- Uh-huh, I sure am.

825
00:59:49,313 --> 00:59:52,612
Oh, boy! This is
the life, huh, Pinoky?

826
00:59:52,683 --> 00:59:55,277
Yeah!

827
00:59:55,353 --> 00:59:58,447
It sure is!

828
00:59:58,522 --> 01:00:01,218
Ah, you smoke
like me grandmother!

829
01:00:01,292 --> 01:00:05,092
Come on,
take a big drag like this.

830
01:00:07,598 --> 01:00:09,998
Okay, Lampy.

831
01:00:26,951 --> 01:00:29,977
Heh, some fun, huh, kid?

832
01:00:30,054 --> 01:00:32,912
Okay, Slats, your shot.

833
01:00:47,293 --> 01:00:50,626
[Lampwick] What's the matter, Slats?
Losing your grip?

834
01:00:53,032 --> 01:00:54,966
[Jiminy]
Pinocchio!

835
01:00:55,034 --> 01:00:57,093
So this is where I find you!

836
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:59,229
How do you ever expect
to be a real boy?

837
01:00:59,305 --> 01:01:02,638
Look at yourself...
smoking, playing pool!

838
01:01:02,709 --> 01:01:06,008
Owww! You're comin' right home
with me this minute!

839
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,640
Hey... who's the beetle?

840
01:01:09,716 --> 01:01:11,650
Let go! Put me down!

841
01:01:11,718 --> 01:01:13,345
[Muffled]
Let me out.

842
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,478
He's my conscience!
He tells me what's right and wrong.

843
01:01:15,555 --> 01:01:19,889
What? You mean, you take orders
from a grasshopper?

844
01:01:19,959 --> 01:01:22,894
Grasshopper? Look here,
you impudent young pup!

845
01:01:22,962 --> 01:01:25,988
It wouldn't hurt you to take
orders from your grasshop...

846
01:01:26,065 --> 01:01:28,363
Your conscience,
if you have one.

847
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:31,665
Yeah-yeah, sure.
Screwball in the corner pocket.

848
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,604
Woo-hoo-hoo!

849
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:46,113
Why, why... ya young hoodlum!

850
01:01:46,185 --> 01:01:49,518
I'll knock your block off!

851
01:01:52,525 --> 01:01:56,621
- [Laughing]
- I'll take you apart
and put you back together!

852
01:01:56,696 --> 01:01:58,630
Oh, don't hurt him, Jiminy.
He's my best friend.

853
01:01:58,698 --> 01:02:02,759
Why, I'll...
Your best friend?

854
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:07,033
And what am I?
Just your conscience!

855
01:02:07,106 --> 01:02:10,507
Okay, that settles it!

856
01:02:10,576 --> 01:02:15,070
- But, Jiminy?
- You buttered your bread,
now sleep in it!

857
01:02:16,182 --> 01:02:18,150
[Yells]

858
01:02:22,555 --> 01:02:24,887
Ha-ha-ha! Go on, laugh.

859
01:02:24,957 --> 01:02:27,983
Make a jackass outta yourself.
I'm through!

860
01:02:28,061 --> 01:02:29,995
- This is the end.
- But, Jiminy?

861
01:02:30,063 --> 01:02:34,432
- Lampwick says a guy only lives once.
- Lampwick... hmph!

862
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,527
Come on, come on.
Let him go.

863
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:45,468
Lampwick... hmph!
Lampwick!

864
01:02:45,545 --> 01:02:49,777
It burns me up.
After all I tried to do for him.

865
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:53,945
Who's his conscience, anyway?
Me or that hoodlum, Lampwick?

866
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,285
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat out of here.

867
01:02:57,356 --> 01:03:00,848
Open up that door!
I wanna go home.

868
01:03:00,927 --> 01:03:03,191
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

869

[Coachman]
Come on, you blokes, keep 'em moving!

870
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:13,661
Lively there now.
We haven't got all night.

871
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:16,300
[Braying Continues]

872
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:19,708
Where'd all the donkeys come from?

873
01:03:19,779 --> 01:03:22,304
Come on, come on.
Let's have another.

874
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:27,511
- And what's your name?
- Hee-haw!

875
01:03:27,587 --> 01:03:30,784
Okay, you'll do!
In you go!

876
01:03:30,857 --> 01:03:33,849
[Coachman]
You boys'll bring a nice price.

877
01:03:33,926 --> 01:03:36,486
[Wicked laugh]
All right, next!

878
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,395
And what might your name be?

879
01:03:39,465 --> 01:03:42,059
- Alexander.
- Hmm.

880
01:03:42,135 --> 01:03:44,194
So you can talk!

881
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:48,832
Yes, sir.
I wanna go home to my mama!

882
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:52,776
Take him back!
He can still talk!

883
01:03:52,845 --> 01:03:56,303
Please, please!
I don't wanna be a donkey.

884
01:03:56,382 --> 01:03:59,715
- Let me outta here!
- Quiet!

885
01:03:59,786 --> 01:04:03,688
You boys have had your fun.
Now pay for it!

886
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:08,352
Boys? So that's what...
Pinocchio!

887
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:12,295
Huh! To hear
that beetle talk...

888
01:04:12,365 --> 01:04:15,232
you'd think somethin'
was gonna happen to us.

889
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:22,571
Conscience! Aw, phooey!

890
01:04:29,182 --> 01:04:31,514
Where's he get that stuff?

891
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:36,647
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?
What's he think I look like?

892
01:04:36,722 --> 01:04:39,850
- A jackass?
- You sure do!

893
01:04:41,093 --> 01:04:43,687
Hee-haw, hee-haw!

894
01:04:43,763 --> 01:04:46,129
Hey, you laugh like a donkey.

895
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:51,399
Hee-haw!
Did that come outta me?

896
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:57,100
Oh!

897
01:04:57,176 --> 01:04:59,474
Huh?

898
01:05:00,913 --> 01:05:02,938
What the... What's going on?

899
01:05:04,584 --> 01:05:06,984
Aaah!
I've been double-crossed!

900
01:05:07,053 --> 01:05:10,454
Help! Help! Somebody, help!

901
01:05:10,523 --> 01:05:12,957
I've been framed! Help!

902
01:05:13,025 --> 01:05:16,051
Please, you gotta help me.
Be a pal.

903
01:05:16,128 --> 01:05:18,790
Call that beetle.
Call anybody.

904
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,734
Mama?

905
01:05:22,802 --> 01:05:26,135
Mama!

906
01:05:26,205 --> 01:05:30,733
Hee-haw, hee-haw,
hee-haw, hee-haw!

907
01:05:42,388 --> 01:05:44,391
Oh! What's happened?

908
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:46,493
I hope I'm not too late.

909
01:05:47,461 --> 01:05:50,328
What'll I do?

910
01:05:52,766 --> 01:05:54,825
Pinocchio!

911
01:05:54,902 --> 01:05:56,836
Jiminy! Oh, Jiminy, help!

912
01:05:56,904 --> 01:06:00,203
Pinoke, the kids, the boys,
they're all donkeys!

913
01:06:00,274 --> 01:06:02,504
Oh! You too.

914
01:06:02,576 --> 01:06:06,410
Come on, quick!
Before you get any worse.

915
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,449
This way, Pinoke.
It's the only way out.

916
01:06:17,825 --> 01:06:21,090
Hurry up...
before they see us.

917
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:25,490
You gotta jump!

918
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:48,145
Jiminy? Jiminy?

919
01:06:48,222 --> 01:06:50,452
You all right?

920
01:06:50,524 --> 01:06:52,958
Sure!
[Cough]

921
01:06:53,026 --> 01:06:55,824
I thought
we'd never make it.

922
01:06:55,896 --> 01:07:00,162
Certainly feels good
to be back on dry land.

923
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:05,166
Come on, let's get home.

924
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:09,505
- Father, I'm home!
- We're home, Mr. Geppetto.

925
01:07:09,576 --> 01:07:12,636
- It's me, Pinocchio! I'm home to stay.
- [Bell Ringing]

926
01:07:12,713 --> 01:07:16,240
Here he is, Mr. Geppetto.
Home at last.

927
01:07:16,316 --> 01:07:19,444
Hey, maybe he's asleep.

928
01:07:20,854 --> 01:07:22,822
Father?

929
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:25,586
Father, it's me.

930
01:07:25,659 --> 01:07:28,150
Pinoke, come here.

931
01:07:28,228 --> 01:07:30,162
Look.

932
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:32,391
He ain't here.

933
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:35,162
He... He's gone.

934
01:07:35,235 --> 01:07:37,499
Yeah, and Figaro.

935
01:07:37,571 --> 01:07:40,472
And Cleo too.

936
01:07:44,444 --> 01:07:47,504
Maybe something awful
happened to him.

937
01:07:47,581 --> 01:07:50,846
Don't worry, son,
he probably hasn't gone far.

938
01:07:58,192 --> 01:08:02,094
Hey! It's a message.

939
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:04,562
- What's it say?
- It's about your father.

940
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:07,862
- Where is he?
- Why, uh, uh. It says here...

941
01:08:07,935 --> 01:08:11,769
he went looking for you
and was swallowed by a whale.

942
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,898
- Swallowed by a whale?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

943
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:18,911
A whale?
A whale named Monstro.

944
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:22,540
- But wait, he's alive.
- Alive? Where?

945
01:08:22,616 --> 01:08:25,813
Inside the whale
at the bottom of the sea.

946
01:08:25,886 --> 01:08:27,820
- Bottom of the sea?
- Uh-huh.

947
01:08:27,888 --> 01:08:31,824
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm going to find him.

948
01:08:31,892 --> 01:08:34,326
Pinoke, are you crazy?

949
01:08:34,394 --> 01:08:38,455
- Don't you realize he's in a whale?
- I've gotta go to him.

950
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:42,628
Hey, Pinoke, wait!
Listen here, son...

951
01:08:45,072 --> 01:08:48,200
This Monstro,
I've heard of him.

952
01:08:48,275 --> 01:08:52,769
He's a whale of a whale!
He swallows whole ships alive!

953
01:08:52,846 --> 01:08:56,680
Tie it good and tight now.
And besides, it's dangerous.

954
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,617
- Bye, Jiminy.
- Good-bye?

955
01:08:59,686 --> 01:09:02,348
I may be live bait down there,
but I'm with ya.

956
01:09:02,422 --> 01:09:05,323
Come on... let's go.

957
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:08,759
[Jiminy]
Look out below!

958
01:09:16,003 --> 01:09:19,234
[Gurgling Voice]
Gangway, down there.

959
01:09:27,047 --> 01:09:30,642
Gee! What a big place.

960
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,722
Come on, Jiminy.

961
01:09:43,797 --> 01:09:47,756
All right.
Soon as I take on some ballast.

962
01:09:47,834 --> 01:09:50,325
One side, sister.

963
01:09:54,808 --> 01:09:57,834
Well... so long.

964
01:10:01,648 --> 01:10:05,379
Hmm.
Put it in the wrong end.

965
01:10:10,023 --> 01:10:13,959
Hmm! No more privacy
than a goldfish.

966
01:10:14,027 --> 01:10:16,518
Ooo! Chilly.

967
01:10:20,729 --> 01:10:23,459
Father?

968
01:10:33,008 --> 01:10:35,636
Father?

969
01:10:41,283 --> 01:10:44,013
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!

970
01:10:44,086 --> 01:10:46,919
Father?

971
01:10:46,988 --> 01:10:48,922
Father!

972
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:51,185
Huh!
He ain't my father.

973
01:10:51,259 --> 01:10:55,059
Uh, Mr. Geppetto!

974
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,064
Hey! What the...

975
01:10:58,433 --> 01:11:03,393
Hey, let go! Run along,
you little... squirt.

976
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:05,406
What's the matter?
Can't a fellow... I was only...

977
01:11:07,576 --> 01:11:10,875
We were only
looking for... Monstro.

978
01:11:10,946 --> 01:11:13,141
That got 'em.

979
01:11:14,716 --> 01:11:17,810
Father?

980
01:11:25,427 --> 01:11:27,827
Father?

981
01:11:29,965 --> 01:11:32,297
Oh! Hello.

982
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:37,661
Oh!

983
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:42,039
Can you tell me where we
can find Monstro, the whale?

984
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:45,477
Gee! They're scared.

985
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:52,115
Uh, pardon me, pearl,

986
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:56,783
are you acquainted
with Monstro, the whale?

987
01:12:02,831 --> 01:12:04,924
Whoa, hold it there.

988
01:12:11,406 --> 01:12:13,374
Hmph!

989
01:12:13,442 --> 01:12:16,673
Father?

990
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:21,508
One side there, son.

991
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:24,518
Come on, boys, break it up.
Break it up now.

992
01:12:26,588 --> 01:12:28,419
[Whinnying]

993
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:30,981
[Jiminy]
Hey! What the...

994
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:33,892
Whoa, quit shovin'.
Don't crowd.

995
01:12:33,962 --> 01:12:36,192
Take it easy there.

996
01:12:43,905 --> 01:12:46,567
- Whoa there.
- [Whinnies]

997
01:12:46,641 --> 01:12:50,077
Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them.

998
01:12:50,145 --> 01:12:53,774
Could any of you tell me
where to find Monstro?

999
01:12:55,484 --> 01:12:57,918
Whoa! Whoa, boy.

1000
01:13:00,021 --> 01:13:02,046
Uh, sakes alive.

1001
01:13:04,326 --> 01:13:06,794
Father?

1002
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:12,597
- Father?
- Mr. Geppetto?

1003
01:13:52,007 --> 01:13:55,238
Not a bite for days.

1004
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:04,149
[Geppetto]
We can't hold out much longer.

1005
01:14:07,589 --> 01:14:09,819
Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!

1006
01:14:09,891 --> 01:14:11,756
Ah-choo!

1007
01:14:12,827 --> 01:14:15,625
I never thought...

1008
01:14:15,697 --> 01:14:19,565
it would end this way, Figaro.

1009
01:14:19,634 --> 01:14:22,228
Starving to death...

1010
01:14:22,304 --> 01:14:26,741
in the belly of a whale.

1011
01:14:26,808 --> 01:14:30,403
My poor little Pinocchio.

1012
01:14:30,478 --> 01:14:34,539
He was such a good boy.

1013
01:14:35,617 --> 01:14:38,415
It's hopeless, Figaro.

1014
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:46,126
There isn't a fish left.

1015
01:14:46,194 --> 01:14:49,425
If the monster
doesn't wake up soon,

1016
01:14:49,497 --> 01:14:52,898
I'm afraid we...
we are done for.

1017
01:15:13,688 --> 01:15:16,282
Here they come!

1018
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:19,919
Tuna! Oh, tuna fish!

1019
01:15:22,697 --> 01:15:26,633
Food! We'll eat!
Here's a big one.

1020
01:15:28,703 --> 01:15:32,639
Keep them in there, Figaro.

1021
01:15:34,509 --> 01:15:37,706
Wait! Wait a minute!
Have you seen...

1022
01:15:39,881 --> 01:15:43,286
Monstro!

1023
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,888
Ohh!
We gotta get outta here.

1024
01:15:53,096 --> 01:15:56,964
Woo-hoo-hoo! Come on, Pinoke.
Don't wait for me!

1025
01:15:58,535 --> 01:16:01,368
Never saw so many!

1026
01:16:04,374 --> 01:16:10,006
Whoops! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Here's another one.

1027
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,981
Enough for weeks!

1028
01:16:13,049 --> 01:16:16,610
Here's a big one.

1029
01:16:23,193 --> 01:16:25,320
Keep them in there, Figaro!

1030
01:16:58,695 --> 01:17:02,461
Hey, blubber mouth, open up.
I gotta get in there.

1031
01:17:02,532 --> 01:17:05,433
Looks like the last of them.

1032
01:17:09,706 --> 01:17:12,038
Here's a big one.
Only a few left.

1033
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:16,372
We gotta work fast.

1034
01:17:16,446 --> 01:17:18,914
- Hey!
- Here's another one.

1035
01:17:18,982 --> 01:17:21,143
Hey, Father!

1036
01:17:21,217 --> 01:17:24,243
- Father!
- Don't bother me now, Pinocchio.

1037
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,880
P... Pinocchio?

1038
01:17:26,956 --> 01:17:31,893
- Father!
- Pinocchio, my son!

1039
01:17:31,961 --> 01:17:36,125
- Hey, Father, here I am.
- Huh? Oh, oh, yes!

1040
01:17:36,199 --> 01:17:40,932
Pinocchio, my boy!
I'm so happy to see you.

1041
01:17:41,004 --> 01:17:43,131
Me too, Father.

1042
01:17:43,206 --> 01:17:47,142
- Whoops.
- Figaro! Ah, Figaro.

1043
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:50,145
Cleo! Oh, Cleo!

1044
01:17:50,213 --> 01:17:53,705
- You're here too.
- Yes!

1045
01:17:53,783 --> 01:17:56,809
- We're all together again.
- Ah-choo.

1046
01:17:56,886 --> 01:17:59,650
- Oh, you are soaking wet.
- Yes, Father.

1047
01:17:59,722 --> 01:18:03,158
- You mustn't catch cold.
- But I came to save you.

1048
01:18:03,226 --> 01:18:05,592
You know, you shouldn't
have come down here.

1049
01:18:05,662 --> 01:18:09,462
- But, Father.
- But I'm awfully glad to see you.

1050
01:18:09,532 --> 01:18:12,501
Let me take your hat off.
Oh!

1051
01:18:12,569 --> 01:18:14,969
Pinocchio!

1052
01:18:15,905 --> 01:18:18,237
Wha... What's the matter?

1053
01:18:18,308 --> 01:18:20,037
Those ears!

1054
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:23,204
Huh? Ears? Oh, these!

1055
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:28,080
[Chuckle] Oh, that's nothing.
I got a tail too!

1056
01:18:28,151 --> 01:18:30,051
Hee-haw!

1057
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,486
Pinocchio!

1058
01:18:32,555 --> 01:18:36,150
What's happened to you?

1059
01:18:36,226 --> 01:18:37,784
Well, l...

1060
01:18:37,861 --> 01:18:42,161
- I, l...
- Oh, never mind now.

1061
01:18:42,232 --> 01:18:44,598
Old Geppetto has
his little woodenhead.

1062
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:47,192
Nothing else matters!

1063
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:50,205
[Jiminy] I gotta get in!
My pal's in there.

1064
01:18:50,273 --> 01:18:52,764
Come on, ya big moose!
Open up, I tell ya!

1065
01:18:52,842 --> 01:18:55,174
- Hey! Cut it out.
- [Squawking]

1066
01:18:57,881 --> 01:19:01,749
Hey, beat it, you buzzards!

1067
01:19:01,818 --> 01:19:04,787
Get out? Oh, no, no, son.

1068
01:19:04,854 --> 01:19:09,983
I have tried every way.
Why, I even built a raft.

1069
01:19:10,117 --> 01:19:13,143
A raft? That's it!

1070
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:15,916
We'll take the raft
and when the whale opens his mouth...

1071
01:19:15,989 --> 01:19:18,389
No, no, no, no.
Now, listen, son.

1072
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:22,292
He only opens his mouth
when he's eating.

1073
01:19:22,362 --> 01:19:26,492
Then everything comes in,
nothing goes out.

1074
01:19:26,566 --> 01:19:29,228
- Oh.
- It's hopeless, Pinocchio.

1075
01:19:29,302 --> 01:19:32,794
Come, we make a nice fire
and we cook some of the fish.

1076
01:19:32,873 --> 01:19:34,534
A fire! That's it!

1077
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:37,873
- Yes! And then we'll all eat again.
- A great big fire!

1078
01:19:37,944 --> 01:19:41,380
- Lots of smoke.
- Smoke? Oh, yes, sure.

1079
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:44,849
- Smoked fish will taste good.
- Quick, some wood.

1080
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:47,409
Pinocchio, not the chair.

1081
01:19:47,487 --> 01:19:51,116
- Hurry, Father, more wood!
- What'll we sit on?

1082
01:19:51,191 --> 01:19:55,184
We won't need it.
We're getting out!

1083
01:19:55,262 --> 01:19:57,492
Getting out? But how?

1084
01:19:57,564 --> 01:20:02,934
- We'll make him sneeze!
- Make him sneeze? Oh!

1085
01:20:03,003 --> 01:20:06,461
That will make him mad!

1086
01:20:15,415 --> 01:20:17,883
Sniff, sniff, sniff.

1087
01:20:17,951 --> 01:20:20,579
Sniff, sniff, sniff.

1088
01:20:22,522 --> 01:20:24,683
Ah...

1089
01:20:24,758 --> 01:20:26,783
Ah... Ah...

1090
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:30,956
Well, it's about time!

1091
01:20:31,031 --> 01:20:33,226
Ah... Ah... Ah...

1092
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:37,396
- It won't work.
- Hurry, Father.

1093
01:20:37,471 --> 01:20:39,405
Climb aboard.

1094
01:20:39,473 --> 01:20:42,408
- We'll never get by those teeth!
- Yes, we will!

1095
01:20:42,476 --> 01:20:46,412
Hey, which way you going?
Wait for me!

1096
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,449
Hang on. Here we go!

1097
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:50,949
Ah-choo!

1098
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:58,958
Gesundheit.

1099
01:20:59,025 --> 01:21:00,959
Ah... Ah... Ah...

1100
01:21:01,027 --> 01:21:04,463
- We're going back!
- No, we'll make it. Faster, faster.

1101
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:06,795
Ah... Ah... Ah...

1102
01:21:06,867 --> 01:21:09,529
[Geppetto]
It's no use. We're done for!

1103
01:21:09,603 --> 01:21:11,093
Ah-choo!

1104
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,310
We made it!

1105
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:23,406
[Roaring]

1106
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:28,112
Look! Now he is mad!

1107
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:36,061
I told you he'd be furious!

1108
01:21:46,173 --> 01:21:48,403
- He's gone.
- Where'd he go?

1109
01:21:48,475 --> 01:21:51,171
Look out!

1110
01:21:51,244 --> 01:21:53,678
Hang on!

1111
01:22:01,988 --> 01:22:04,388
[Roars]

1112
01:22:07,761 --> 01:22:10,355
He's coming back.
Hurry!

1113
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:13,058
He's trying to kill us!
Paddle, son!

1114
01:22:22,042 --> 01:22:24,033
Let's go back!

1115
01:22:25,745 --> 01:22:27,337
Look out!

1116
01:22:27,414 --> 01:22:30,144
