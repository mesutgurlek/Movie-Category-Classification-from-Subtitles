Is everything
to your liking, ma'am?

00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:33,111
It's an unusually cheerful
spectacle, Captain Martos.

4
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,812
When we're becalmed
like this, we might as well
enjoy ourselves.

5
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:39,823
When I arrive in New Orleans
I shall enjoy myself,
but not until then.

00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,018
That pirate, Baptiste,
is an obsession with her.

00:01:43,094 --> 00:01:46,188
Every strange sail we sight
calls for a fresh bottle
of smelling salts.

be safer if you were
in your own drawing room.

11
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:52,963
In a calm like this,
no pirate
could ever get to us.

Not even Baptiste.

13
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,547
Fetch me that fiddler, Tom.
He's better
than the one we got.

00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:05,105
Aye, aye, sir.

Mr. Roberts,
you guard the ladies.

Aye.

29
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:06,460
And did you fetch
along the fiddler?

30
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,971
He went
with the spice bales.

(LAUGHS)

32
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:14,636
What do you intend to
do with us, pirate?

33
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,681
Set you adrift
in the small boats,
along with the passengers.

34
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:19,842
Unless there's any
amongst you who
would volunteer?

Think you any of my men
would serve with you?

36
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,379
Well, not a lad amongst us
hasn't served on a vessel
of Alexander Narbonne.

37
00:04:26,457 --> 00:04:30,553
Tell that to your master,
if your small boat's lucky
enough to be picked up.

38
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:33,688
At the same time
I'll request the privilege
of being present

39
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:36,325
when Narbonne
has you hanged from
your own yardarm.

40
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,666
Why bother Narbonne?
I'll invite you myself.

Small boats always
make me crazy.

we're all through.

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,011

would you like to sign on
with Frederic Baptiste?

Well, lower me jib a bustle.

00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:32,916
Very nice to meet you.

62
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:36,251
Is this new gear on
all the Narbonne craft?

63
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:38,420
How did you get aboard?

64
00:05:38,496 --> 00:05:39,724
It was easy.

65
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,197
But if I'd known
you were going to get
your moldy old ship

66
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:45,759
captured by a gang
of cutthroats,
I'd have stayed in Boston.

67
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:48,271
Stowaway, eh?
Put her in the boat
with the other women.

68
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,328
Pulled away.

69
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:51,136
Then she'll have to go
in the longboat with them.

70
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:54,440
And get going before
I change my mind and make you
swim back to New Orleans.

71
00:05:54,512 --> 00:05:56,241
Come on, you...
Wait a minute.

72

I've got two dresses
in that boat and
I'm not leaving without them.

You know, he's making
a big mistake putting one
woman in with all those men.

74
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:08,384
You wouldn't be thinking...

75
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:10,620
That she'd be safer with us?

76
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:12,255
Precisely.

77
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,259
Oh, no, you don't.

78
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,526
It's all for your safety...

79
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,624

my ear off.

how to handle a lady.

86
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,535
If you don't put me down...

87
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:30,604
Imagine all those
poor defenseless men
alone in a small boat

88
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,445
with a dangerous female
like this?

89
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,075
Here, take her.

90
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:37,053
When I get down in the boat,
hand her to me.

00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:59,835

Ow!

99
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,615
Take her, Kryl! Take her!

100
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:09,676
You little devil, you...

101
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:13,147
(SCREAMING)

102
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,351
You think my hand's
a blooming sea biscuit?

103
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:17,656
Touch me again
and I'll bite your arm off.

104
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,993
We gotta get her below decks
before the other boats
get back.

105
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,555
You and your wonderful idea.
We should've
dumped her overboard.

106
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:23,998
Ow!
Ow!

107
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,830
Quiet!
Whatever you have up there,
bring it down here.

108
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:30,841
(GROANING)
Ow!

109
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,309
What goes on out there?

110
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:39,311
Let me down. Let me down.

111
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:41,511
By the Dog Star!
A female.

112
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,053
I've been kidnapped!

113
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:46,113
And I demand
that you do something
about it.

114
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:49,519
She was stowed away
aboard the <i>Gulf Queen,</i> sir.

115
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,892
But somehow
she got herself
in our boat, sir.

116
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:54,124
I'll discuss that
with you later.

117
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:56,632
Meanwhile, leave her here.

118
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:59,727
Aye, aye, sir.
With the greatest
of pleasure.

119
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:02,805
Turn around.

120
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:06,673
Who are you?

121
00:08:06,744 --> 00:08:08,211
The captain of this vessel.

122
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,871
But I thought...

123
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:11,372
Then who was the other?

124
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,440
Jared? My mate.

125
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:16,316
Fortunately, many people
make the same mistake.

126
00:08:16,387 --> 00:08:17,615
Then you must be...

127
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:20,816
Frederic Baptiste,
the bloodthirsty pirate,

128
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:22,792
the scourge of
the Mexican government,

129
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,658
that fiend in human shape.

130
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,665
At your service, <i>mademoiselle.</i>
Up to a point.

131
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,159
Somebody's
been exaggerating.

132
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:32,327
Oh?

133
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,128
Or maybe they haven't.

134
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:35,229
(TITTERING)

135
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,604
Look what your men
have done to me.

136
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:40,803
You'll find ointment
in that chest, Miss...

137
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:42,368
Deborah McCoy.

138
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:44,811
Debbie, they call me.

139
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,247
Where were you headed,
Debbie?

140
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:51,515
Oh, New Orleans, Rio.
I wasn't sure.

141
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:53,016
To visit?

142
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,114
No.

143
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:57,184
They say that
they're good places for
a girl to earn her living.

144
00:08:57,261 --> 00:09:00,526
And this living,
how did you propose
to make it?

145
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:04,193
I'm an entertainer.
I sing a little
and I dance a little.

146
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:08,204
You know, you combine
all the elements
of a first-class problem.

147
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:09,261
Why?

148
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,331
All you have to do
is put me ashore somewhere.

149
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:12,398
(CHUCKLES)

150
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:14,536
And stretch my neck
by doing it?

151
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:16,978
I know how to
keep a tight mouth.

152
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:21,212
After all, they say
you only attack the ships
of Alexander Narbonne.

153
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:23,147
I don't even know who he is.

154
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:26,213
The richest man
in New Orleans.
Or used to be.

155
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:27,848
Oh.

156
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,452
He'd be a good one
to know, wouldn't he?

157
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,655
That depends on
one's point of view.

158
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,893
Why do you give his ships
your special attention?

159
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,569
That's my point of view.

160
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:43,468
Tell me, how long
have you been making
your own way, Debbie?

161
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:44,734
Too long.

162
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:46,572
No one to help you?

163
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:47,974
Too many.

164
00:09:48,513 --> 00:09:51,073
I still can't decide
what to do about you.

165
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:53,776
The sailors
were given a chance
to sign on with you.

166
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:56,843
I believe I have
a more practical solution
than that.

167
00:09:56,954 --> 00:09:59,252
I knew
you'd think of something.

168
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:01,791
We'll maroon you
on a sand spit.

169
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:02,951
Oh.

170
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:05,725
I'm sure
you can think of something
better than that.

171
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:08,856
Why, no.
It's a perfect way
to handle the situation.

172
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:11,766
We'll pick a sand spit
on the sea lanes
to South America.

173
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:13,531
If you're picked up,
you'll get to Rio.

174
00:10:13,604 --> 00:10:17,870
And if not, you'll be on
a clean white beach
protected by palm trees.

175
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,836
You'll soon grow to love it.

176
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,077
Finished, captain.
We stripped her clean.

177
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:26,211
Cargo aboard and stowed.

178
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:29,152
Not a bad haul
for a ship her size.

179
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,519
Oh. These must be
worth a fortune.

180
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,717
I thought
I ordered you set adrift.

181
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:37,454
Oh, you did, but somehow
the orders got mixed up.

182
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:39,189
You'd better find a cabin
for our passenger.

183
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,821
A cabin?
Anything will do.

184
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:43,128
She'll only be with us
until we sight
a suitable sand spit.

185
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,566
But I thought...
Good night, Debbie.

186
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:47,331
Sleep as well as you can.

187
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:48,895
Away with you.

188
00:10:58,316 --> 00:10:59,806
(BELL RINGING)

189
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:18,463
Another four days
and that girl will have them
wearing lace on their drawers.

190
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:20,163
Yeah, that's
a fair shame, sir.

191
00:11:20,237 --> 00:11:21,226
It's always been me pride

192
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,206
we had the roughest
and dirtiest crew
in the Mexican gulf.

193
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:26,800
I can't stand to
look at it anymore.

194
00:11:30,848 --> 00:11:33,078
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

195
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:39,047
Where did you
get that dress?

196
00:11:39,123 --> 00:11:40,181
Oh, this?

197
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:43,693
It's just a little old thing
Jared rummaged for me
in a chest.

198
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:44,921
Jared, eh?

199
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,692
So he rummaged it
for you in a chest,
did he?

200
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:54,165
Well, take it off.

201
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:56,672
Oh, were you taking it
to someone?

202
00:11:57,608 --> 00:12:00,441
How awful of Jared
not to tell me.

203
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,111
But, after all,
she won't know, will she?

204
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,375
I will.

205
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,011
But you'll forget.

206
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:12,482
You'll forget about me
and the dress, these last
few days, everything.

207
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:14,584
At least I'll try.

208
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,022
While I sit on my sand spit
and remember.

209
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:20,621
I told you
to take that dress off.

210
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,791
All right.
You needn't shout.

211
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,194
Not here.

212
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:28,533
(RIPPING)

213
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:32,905
Now look what you've done
to the hem.

214
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,672
Afternoon, Miss Debbie.

215
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:36,736
Good afternoon,
Bertram.

216
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:39,513
He's been telling me
about his sister.

217
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,948
I remind him of her.

218
00:12:41,018 --> 00:12:42,542
He never had a sister.

219
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,912
Oh, the poor fellow.

220
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:47,014
He's had such a sad life.

221
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:48,991
He's had the kind of life
he wants.

222
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,255
So have I. Up to now.

223
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:53,857
Jared!

224
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:56,024
Now, you mustn't be
angry with Jared.

225
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,002
Miss McCoy, you've teased
and wheedled everybody
aboard this ship.

226
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,632
You've shot all discipline
to shreds and now you tell me
how to treat my crew.

227
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,642
It's time I put a stop to it.

228
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,109
You'd be wanting
to see me, sir?

229
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:10,773
Cram on full sail.
I mean to be in and out
of New Orleans before dawn.

230
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:11,837
Aye, aye, sir.

231
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,783
Oh, I hate to think of
your running such a risk

232
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:16,843
just to take me
where I want to go.

233
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,355
You're not going
ashore. I am.

234
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,085
And the moment I get back
we head for the Tortugas,

235
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,320
where you'll stay
and no doubt do very well.

236
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:26,989
Now, go to your cabin
and stay there.

237
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:32,202
And take off that dress!

238
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,198
Keep her steady.

239
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:41,438
More gray hairs
for Narbonne.

240
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:44,011
It's a pity you won't be there
in the morning
to see them sprout.

241
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,742
He'll be bald
before I'm through.

242
00:13:45,816 --> 00:13:47,078
(LAUGHS)

243
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:50,652
Jared, if there's any
trouble with that girl,
I'll hold you responsible.

244
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:52,382
Oh, you needn't
fret about her, sir.

245
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,050
She's locked in the cabin.
I have the key right here
in my pocket.

246
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,889
Well, I'd better put it
in my pocket.

247
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,691
Then I know
she won't cause any trouble.

248
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:01,231
Aye, aye, sir.

249
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:03,828
Cast off.

250
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,237
(SINGING)

251
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:45,336
(SIGHS)

252
00:14:57,221 --> 00:15:00,349
Good morning, Mama.
It's a beautiful morning,
isn't it?

253
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:02,755
So it's a beautiful morning.
What about it?

254
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:05,921
You look tired, Mama.
Go inside and rest.

255
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:09,193
We have no time to rest.
The customers
are already in the market.

256
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:10,597
We gotta put the rest
of the vegetables on...

257
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:11,930
No, no, no, Mama.
Later.

258
00:15:12,002 --> 00:15:14,436
Out of my way.
I was wondering when I...

259
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:16,029
Sorry, but you should
have let me out.

260
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:17,471
So this is where
you keep her.

261
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,169
Mama, I swear,
I never saw her before.

262
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:22,836
After 20 years,
you keep a woman
in the vegetable box.

263
00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:25,177
It isn't true!
After 20 years, I didn't!

264
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:27,843
I never saw your husband
before in my life.

265
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:30,910
I slept in there last night
because I had no place else
to go.

266
00:15:30,988 --> 00:15:32,546
Liar.
Mama.

267
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:34,921
Hag.
No, no, no, please.

268
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:38,450
Mama... Police! Police!

269
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,330
Please, Mama, don't.

270
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,958
Joseph,
hadn't you better go?

271
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:45,899
If <i>Madame</i> Brizar
will pardon me.

272
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,301
Of course.

273
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:50,303
Police! Police! Police!

274
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:51,398
Please, Mama!

275
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:53,943
I wouldn't have your husband
on a salad with mayonnaise!

276
00:15:54,011 --> 00:15:56,070
He's good enough for me,
but he's not
good enough for you?

277
00:15:56,146 --> 00:15:57,135
Police! Mama!

278
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:58,613
You know what?
If he's so good
you can have him.

279
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:02,049
Please stop screaming
for me. I'm here.

280
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:03,653
Now what is the cause
for this disturbance?

281
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:05,211
He hid her
in our vegetable closet.

282
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:06,551
I never saw her before.

283
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:08,182
He lies.
With my own eyes I saw her.

284
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,227
For 20 years,
she accuses me

285
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:12,660
of flirting with every woman
who comes to buy vegetables!

286
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,322
Because it took me
20 years to catch him!

287
00:16:14,398 --> 00:16:16,491
Believe me, Mr. Policeman.
I didn't do anything.

288
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,467
I open the closet door
and there she is!

289
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:20,799
OFFICER: Silence!
I can't hear you
for the shouting.

290
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:23,567
Go inside.
The rest of you, disperse.

291
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:29,141
<i>Madame</i> Brizar's
compliments, <i>mademoiselle.</i>
She wants to see you.

292
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:31,738
Look, I'm in a hurry,
and I'm in trouble enough.

293
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:33,942
Then you should want
to see <i>Madame</i> Brizar.

294
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:35,645
This way, please.

295
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:40,479
<i>Madame</i> Brizar.

296
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:42,720
Did you want to see me?
Yes.

297
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,921
You could be
very attractive, my girl.
What's your name?

298
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:47,853
Deborah McCoy.

299
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:51,263
Stand back a little,
so that
I can see you better.

300
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:52,324
Hmm.

301
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:54,963
Not too bad. Not too bad.

302
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,631
There she is!
By the carriage!

303
00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:58,641
Get in, Deborah.
Why?

304
00:16:58,742 --> 00:17:01,575
Because that policeman
is looking for you.

305
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:04,209
Now drive on.

306
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:08,684
Do you mind
if I ask a question?

307
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:09,912
By all means.

308
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,750
Where are we going?

309
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:12,981
Home.

310
00:17:31,275 --> 00:17:33,539
Come, come, child.
In we go.

311
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:37,538
You may put
the carriage away.

312
00:17:37,614 --> 00:17:39,172
Yes, <i>madame.</i>

313
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,940
Come, Deborah.

314
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:43,719
Good morning, Toussaint.

315
00:17:43,787 --> 00:17:44,981
Good morning, ma'am.

316
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:47,455
<i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne
and <i>Monsieur</i> Patout
are waiting.

317
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,254
Oh. At this early hour?

318
00:17:51,228 --> 00:17:54,994
Well, don't stand there
and gawk. Come in, darling.
Sit down, child, sit down.

319
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:56,189
(SIGHS)

320
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:57,927
<i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne.

321
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,268
Such an honor.

322
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:02,100
Good morning, <i>madame.</i>

323
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:04,800
I'm giving a soirée
for the Governor
and his wife tonight,

324
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,469
and Patout
has just reminded me
that we have no entertainers.

325
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,875
You remember my secretary?

326
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:11,039
Certainly I remember
<i>Monsieur</i> Patout.

327
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:13,208
He always brings the check.

328
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:15,880
No doubt.

329
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,115
There was
a light-haired girl
last time

330
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:20,713
who was unusually pretty,
if a bit gauche.

331
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,157
What was her name, Patout?
Cleo, sir.

332
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,458
Ah, yes, one of
my loveliest girls.

333
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,727
Very lovely,
despite her unfortunate habit
of singing off-key.

334
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,631
Oh, that has been overcome,
<i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne.

335
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:34,262
She no longer sings.
She dances.

336
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:37,774
Splendid.
Then send her along,
by all means.

337
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,378
Well, and who is this?

338
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:43,805
Somebody
who should not be here.

339
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:46,816
Now, make your curtsy, child,
and run along.
Go on, run along.

340
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:49,079
So you're <i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne?

341
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:51,746
Well, hello.
Hello.

342
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:55,787
I've heard a lot about you
from mutual friends.

343
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:57,486
Really? How nice.

344
00:18:58,195 --> 00:19:01,392
Come, Patout.
9:00 this evening,
<i>Madame</i> Brizar.

345
00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:04,127
You can leave everything
to me, as usual.

346
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:07,227
I'll send you
a shower of talent and beauty.

347
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:09,867
"Hello," she says.

348
00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:14,171
"Hello," she says.
Haven't you even
the slightest training?

349
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:16,312
So far I've always
done all right.

350
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,541
I've never been
so mortified.

351
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,175
Perhaps I've made
a serious mistake.

352
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:24,513
Perhaps you have.

353
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:27,119
And then again,
maybe I'm the one
who's made the mistake.

354
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:28,453
"Hello," she says.

355
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:29,549
Hmm!

356
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,253
Oh, Toussaint.
Yes, ma'am.

357
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:34,024
Will you tell Delphine
and Cleo
that I wish to see them?

358
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:36,191
Yes, ma'am.
I'll tell them.

359
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:39,861
And don't stoop.
Your posture's
most unbecoming.

360
00:19:39,937 --> 00:19:41,495
What's the matter
with my posture?

361
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:46,066
Oh, it fails utterly
to suggest the languid grace
of the swan,

362
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,203
or the more piquant movements
of the male partridge.

363
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,268
Huh?

364
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:52,872
Good morning, <i>madame.</i>
You wanted to see us?

365
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,077
Another affair
at <i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne's.

366
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,245
Delphine, you will wear
the white lace.

367
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,050
But it makes me
look so young.

368
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:00,988
Well, that's what
we have in mind, darling.

369
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:06,257
And, Cleo, you will wear
the black dress
and look your best tonight.

370
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,322
<i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne
expressed some interest
in you.

371
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:10,730
It worked.

372
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:14,295
I told you,
if I sang off-key,
he'd notice me.

373
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:16,968
Is he really the richest man
in New Orleans?

374
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,804
He's not only very rich,
he's very single.

375
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:24,405
Oh, Delphine, Cleo.
This is Deborah McCoy,
who may stay with us.

376
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:26,206
Now, after I've had
my coffee,

377
00:20:26,283 --> 00:20:28,183
we'll discuss
your qualifications,

378
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:29,947
and then I'll decide.

379
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,285
Oh, Toussaint?
Toussaint, my coffee
in the study, please.

380
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,994
She can take her time
over that coffee.
I've decided for her.

381
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:45,633
What a lot of time
I've wasted living in Boston.

382
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:50,135
Higher, higher, much higher.

383
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:53,076
Higher all around.

384
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,399
Much higher.

385
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:57,447
This is for the Seamen's
Fund brawl next Tuesday
night at the Catfish.

386
00:20:57,514 --> 00:20:59,004
Will <i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne
be there?

387
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:01,312
<i>Monsieur</i> never goes
to brawls.

388
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,216
When do I get to go
where he goes?

389
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:05,881
Well, after you've had
the rough edges
knocked off.

390
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:08,857
Another month
and you might be ready
for a gentleman's party.

391
00:21:08,926 --> 00:21:11,520
A man is no different
because of his clothes.

392
00:21:11,595 --> 00:21:14,223
Gentlemen prefer
another type of girl.

393
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:16,357
A slouchier,
more indifferent type.

394
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:18,901
Practice looking slouchy
and indifferent.

395
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:32,976
(CLAPPING)

396
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:36,384
After your song,
there will of course
be applause,

397
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:37,442
and then, no doubt,

398
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:40,581
you will be summoned
to the table of your host,
Captain Kingston.

399
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:43,387
Now, I will be
Captain Kingston.

400
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:50,761
Good evening, Captain.
How about buying me a drink?

401
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:54,031
No. No. No. No.
The approach
is much too abrupt.

402
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,662
Well, it always
worked before.

403
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:58,264
Well, maybe, in
your prosaic Boston,

404
00:21:58,342 --> 00:22:02,540
but here in New Orleans,
the gentlemen prefer
a more roundabout course.

405
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,478
Especially Captain Kingston.

406
00:22:04,548 --> 00:22:07,176
He's a great favorite
with our first families.

407
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:10,152
That guarantees
he'll be a first-class bore.

408
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,883
Debbie, Captain Kingston,
as head of the Seamen's Fund,

409
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,051
gives these parties
to entertain
his seafaring friends,

410
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,924
not to entertain you.

411
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:23,422
Now, you are Captain Kingston.
Observe me.

412
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:27,027
(SNICKERING) Ah, Captain.

413
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:29,102
(DELIGHTED LAUGHTER)

414
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:33,975
The city has been desolate
while you were away.

415
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:36,102
Fetch me a beer, wench.

416
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:38,806
The Captain
only drinks champagne.

417
00:22:39,182 --> 00:22:41,207
And remember,
we get an extra five percent

418
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:42,775
from the management
of the Catfish.

419
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:46,448
I still think
you're making a mistake
sending me to a fish fry.

420
00:22:46,723 --> 00:22:48,816
My talents belong
in the drawing room.

421
00:22:48,892 --> 00:22:51,725
Ridiculous, child.
You can't fly
until you've walked.

422
00:22:51,795 --> 00:22:54,263
Tonight, you will attend
the party at the Catfish
with the other girls.

423
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,662
Now, once more.

424
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:00,063
(LAUGHING)

425
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:01,604
Captain Kingston.

426
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:02,934
(SIGHING)

427
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,435
And did you have
an interesting trip?

428
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:11,605
Interesting enough.
Except for a brush
with the pirate Baptiste.

429
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,412
No, no.
You must never mention
anything unpleasant.

430
00:23:14,484 --> 00:23:15,473
Unpleasant?

431
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:18,180
The very name of that monster
must be avoided

432
00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:22,055
when talking with
seafaring men,
especially Captain Kingston.

433
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,286
He is a privateer
commissioned to catch pirates.

434
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:28,823
Confine your conversation
to subjects
that are soothing.

435
00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:32,596
I wonder why I am so sure
I am going to
dislike Captain Kingston.

436
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:33,931
No, don't start that again.

437
00:23:34,004 --> 00:23:36,734
Besides, you've got
to rehearse your song again.
Come along.

438
00:23:36,807 --> 00:23:39,139
Back to work.
Back to the piano.

439
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:41,635
Now, from the beginning.
Are you ready?

440
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,304
One, two, three.

441
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,307
(MUSIC PLAYING)

442
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,910
(MEN CHEERING)

443
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,296
(CLATTERING)

444
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:08,100
You near bit me ear off.
I only wanted you to
share a bottle with me.

445
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:09,195
Oh?

446
00:24:09,673 --> 00:24:12,233
Here. Now you have
one all to yourself.

447
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:13,742
(ALL LAUGHING)

448
00:24:14,177 --> 00:24:15,838
Stop that. Stop that.

449
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,442
Tonight everybody in my place
is supposed to be friendly.

450
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:22,314
That's just it.
He's too friendly.

451
00:24:22,986 --> 00:24:25,750
I may even report
this to <i>Madame</i> Brizar.

452
00:24:25,822 --> 00:24:28,120
Oh, so you're the singer?

453
00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:30,056
I was. In this air,
I don't know.

454
00:24:30,127 --> 00:24:32,755
Well, you'll get used to it.
Besides, you're late.

455
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:34,763
Why didn't you come
with the other girls?

456
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:37,459
BAPTISTE: No doubt
she had something
better to do.

457
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:39,001
Good evening.

458
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:40,696
What are you doing here?

459
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:43,137
That's a fine question,
hey, Captain Kingston?

460
00:24:43,206 --> 00:24:45,538
Asking the host
what he's doing
in his own party.

461
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,598
(CHUCKLING)

462
00:24:46,676 --> 00:24:48,303
Captain Kingston?

463
00:24:48,378 --> 00:24:50,243
At your service,
<i>mademoiselle.</i>

464
00:24:50,714 --> 00:24:52,204
Up to a point.

465
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,283
So now you're here
in New Orleans
to entertain us?

466
00:24:56,353 --> 00:24:59,652
Yes.
Oh, it's such an honor
you have conferred.

467
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:03,022

Why, Debbie, I thought
I'd made everything
very clear.

602
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:47,681
You certainly did.
As Baptiste you sink ships.

603
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,880
Then as Kingston
you turn the proceeds
into a fund to outfit ships

for people whose ships
have been sunk by Baptiste.

It does sounds
a little complicated.

Suppose we put it this way.
Some people need help,
so I help them.

And in doing it,
I right some old wrongs.

609
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:07,095
But what if they
should catch you?

610
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,694
Then I should be very sorry.

611
00:34:08,771 --> 00:34:10,932
New Orleans
is such a lovely place,

612
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,305
and the ladies in it
even lovelier.

613
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:19,337
By the way, Debbie,
if you were a man
wanted by the authorities,

614
00:34:19,415 --> 00:34:23,044
and the secret of
your identity rested
with a certain girl,

615
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,713
would you continue
to worry about it?

616
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:28,981
I'd say the girl was
the least of my worries.

617
00:34:29,058 --> 00:34:31,458
The others I'm sure
I can handle.

Good night, Debbie.

00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:41,534
Well?
There's no
doubt about it.

620
00:34:41,604 --> 00:34:42,969
It's the ring
you gave Baptiste.

621
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,030
Your initials
are on the inside.

622
00:34:46,242 --> 00:34:49,769
So now
we've finished guessing.
The real Baptiste is dead.

623
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:51,211
And Kingston
must have killed him.

624
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,338
What a pity.

625
00:34:52,415 --> 00:34:54,883
And more the pity
he didn't die quickly
before talking.

626
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,542
Without the ring,
Kingston can prove nothing.

627
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,611
I wish
I could be sure of that.

628
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:02,681
He flaunted this ring
before me
in my own house.

629
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:04,750
Whether to inform me
that he had more evidence,

630
00:35:04,827 --> 00:35:07,557
or merely to worry me
that he might have,
I don't know.

631
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:11,157
If he had more evidence,
he's had ample time
to present it to the Governor.

632
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,964
Unfortunately,
he's much cleverer
than you.

633
00:35:15,038 --> 00:35:18,769
I used the real Baptiste
to eliminate the competition
of Kingston's father

634
00:35:18,841 --> 00:35:20,900
and the other shipowners.

635
00:35:21,377 --> 00:35:25,404
So now Kingston
turns pirate,
calls himself Baptiste,

636
00:35:25,481 --> 00:35:27,915
and employs the same method
against me.

637
00:35:27,984 --> 00:35:29,212
(SCOFFS)

638
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:32,716
Eight of my ships sunk,
and eight others outfitted.

639
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:35,957
It's no wonder he prefers
the present situation.

640
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:40,155
If it continues much longer,
he will have destroyed you
completely.

641
00:35:40,496 --> 00:35:44,557
Unless we destroy him first,
at sea
where he should be destroyed.

642
00:35:46,235 --> 00:35:49,830
You know, Patout,
I rather fancy being a hero,

643
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:53,737
ridding the seas
of this new Baptiste.

644
00:35:55,178 --> 00:35:56,668
(HUMMING)

645
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,672
Well? Do you approve?

646
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:01,114
Not bad. Not bad.

647
00:36:01,584 --> 00:36:04,314
A few minor corrections,
and not bad at all.

648
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,612
A little too much rouge,
perhaps.

649
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,420
<i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne
prefers a pale appearance.

650
00:36:10,493 --> 00:36:14,293
It's not rouge, and I don't
intend to stick my face
in a flour barrel

651
00:36:14,363 --> 00:36:16,627
just to please
<i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne.

652
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:19,634
Debbie, please remember,
when I found you,

653
00:36:19,702 --> 00:36:22,193
you had your face
in a vegetable bin.

654
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:25,371
Ever since you've been here
I've heard nothing but

655
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:28,171
"When do I entertain
at <i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne's?"

656
00:36:28,244 --> 00:36:30,109
Now the time is here,

657
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:33,376
<i>Monsieur</i> Patout
has made a point
of asking for your presence,

658
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:34,746
you're suddenly
very nonchalant

659
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,308
about the most
eligible bachelor
in New Orleans.

660
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:40,082
Oh, not at all.
I couldn't be
more interested.

661
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,990
Then you might show it.
Oh, to me, of course,
not to him.

662
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,652
Any more instructions?
Yes.

663
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:49,562
Stay away from the ladies,
sing your song, retire to
your dressing room...

664
00:36:49,632 --> 00:36:53,625
And be particularly pleasant
to that little worm,
<i>Monsieur</i> Patout.

665
00:36:53,703 --> 00:36:56,570
By all means.
He's very close
to <i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne.

666
00:36:56,672 --> 00:37:00,802
And he can stay there.
I intend to stay close
to Captain Kingston.

667
00:37:01,811 --> 00:37:02,835
Oh.

668
00:37:08,284 --> 00:37:09,876
(MUSIC PLAYING)

669
00:37:19,095 --> 00:37:20,187
Good evening.

670
00:37:20,263 --> 00:37:22,697
Good evening.
I'm from <i>Madame</i> Brizar's.

671
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:24,995
Oh. This way please.

672
00:37:34,577 --> 00:37:37,603
This should convince you
of what
you're missing, Captain.

673
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,614
There's nothing like it
at sea.

674
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:41,650
Fortunately for my crew.

675
00:37:43,486 --> 00:37:45,386
You can't be
that thirsty, Captain.

676
00:37:45,454 --> 00:37:47,581
Debbie,
what a pleasant surprise.

677
00:37:47,657 --> 00:37:52,094
That makes us even.
I was surprised when I heard
you were going to be here.

678
00:37:52,161 --> 00:37:56,120
Why, I wouldn't miss one
of Narbonne's soirées
for all his ships at sea.

679
00:37:56,432 --> 00:37:59,731
Darling,
you'd better come here
and defend yourself.

680
00:37:59,802 --> 00:38:02,032
Patout's complaining
to Uncle again.

681
00:38:02,104 --> 00:38:05,540
Pardon me, Debbie.
A summons from
His Excellency, the Governor.

682
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:08,702
We will all be
looking forward
to hearing you sing.

683
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:14,280
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> the entertainers
wait in another room.

684
00:38:18,287 --> 00:38:19,845
I meant no offense,
Captain.

685
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,254
It's just that
I'm so concerned
about <i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne

686
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:23,622
and the losses
he has suffered.

687
00:38:23,693 --> 00:38:27,094
A familiar complaint,
Robert. Why haven't
you hung Baptiste?

688
00:38:27,496 --> 00:38:30,761
Ah, Your Excellency,
the ocean is vast,
the sea lanes many.

689
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:33,825
Where he is, I am not.
Where I am, he is not.

690
00:38:34,537 --> 00:38:35,834
But someday we shall meet.

691
00:38:35,905 --> 00:38:37,998
In the meantime,
Patout here is worried.

692
00:38:38,074 --> 00:38:40,736
It seems that one of
Narbonne's ships
is leaving Spain next week

693
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,539
with a very rich cargo,
and he fears...

694
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,045
Forgive me,
your Excellency,

695
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,707
but I meant that information
to be kept in confidence.

696
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,147
If word should get out...

697
00:38:48,217 --> 00:38:50,913
Well, Baptiste's ear
seems to be in as many places
as his ship.

698
00:38:50,987 --> 00:38:54,354
Of course, Patout,
I understand. Rest assured,
it will go no further.

699
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:56,323
Not a soul will hear it
from my lips.

700
00:38:56,392 --> 00:38:59,691
Enough of Baptiste.
Let's speak of
something pleasant.

701
00:38:59,762 --> 00:39:01,889
I'll arrange
for the entertainment
to begin.

702
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,659
I noticed you
recognized our singer.

703
00:39:03,733 --> 00:39:06,668
Ah, yes.
And I can recommend
her very highly.

704
00:39:07,036 --> 00:39:09,630
Oh, so that's who
the young lady was.

705
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,966
For a moment
I was almost jealous.

706
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:14,370
Delightful evening,
<i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne.

707
00:39:14,443 --> 00:39:17,276
It's always a pleasure
to see you, <i>madame.</i>

708
00:39:18,714 --> 00:39:20,648
It worked like a charm,
even better
than we'd hoped.

709
00:39:20,716 --> 00:39:21,808
Oh?

710
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:24,375
The Governor himself
told him about
our ship from Spain

711
00:39:24,453 --> 00:39:26,978
and I pretended
that the Governor had
breached a confidence.

712
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:31,117
Splendid. Splendid.
In that case, Patout,
I think we can feel secure

713
00:39:31,193 --> 00:39:35,254
that our three ships
from Paris will arrive safely
in New Orleans.

714
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,326
Has our entertainer
arrived yet?

715
00:39:42,405 --> 00:39:45,533
Yes, and Captain Kingston
seemed quite pleased
to see her,

716
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:47,075
which <i>Mademoiselle</i> Villon
noticed.

717
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:50,874
Good. Perhaps tonight
we will kill one bird
with two stones.

718
00:39:51,314 --> 00:39:52,975
Fetch the singer.

719
00:39:53,949 --> 00:39:54,973
Good evening.

720
00:39:55,051 --> 00:39:57,212
WOMAN: Good evening,
<i>monsieur.</i>

721
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,151
Ah, <i>Mademoiselle</i> Villon.

722
00:39:59,221 --> 00:40:01,689
We see far too little of you
when the Captain is away.

723
00:40:01,757 --> 00:40:04,282
And the Captain is away
far too often.

724
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,487
I'll take that
as a compliment, Arlene.

725
00:40:06,562 --> 00:40:08,587
Or is it a warning,
Kingston?

726
00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:10,962
Remember, a fiancée
is not yet a wife.

727
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,228
How very discerning,
<i>monsieur.</i>

728
00:40:13,836 --> 00:40:16,134
And, Robert,
how very true.

she's quite good.

to select a dress for me.

924
00:51:15,063 --> 00:51:16,724
Maybe you'd like to
board her with us
for a fitting?

925
00:51:16,798 --> 00:51:19,358
If this wind holds,
we'll be off the Floridas
in the morning.

926
00:51:19,434 --> 00:51:21,095
We'll lay to and wait.

927
00:51:21,169 --> 00:51:23,467
Are you planning to vote
the Governor
a share of the haul, Captain,

928
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,937
for giving you
the information?

929
00:51:25,007 --> 00:51:26,031
What information?

930
00:51:26,108 --> 00:51:27,370
That's none
of your affair.

931
00:51:27,442 --> 00:51:30,434
When we sight the ship,
you'll go to your cabin
and stay there.

932
00:51:30,512 --> 00:51:33,913
All right,
you don't have to tell me.
I know all about it.

933
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:38,516
With my very own ears
I heard <i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne
tell Patout

934
00:51:38,587 --> 00:51:41,522
that he was expecting
three ships from Paris.

935
00:51:42,858 --> 00:51:44,792
You heard him say what?

936
00:51:45,293 --> 00:51:48,228
That he was expecting
three ships from Paris.

937
00:51:50,966 --> 00:51:54,129
What a fool I've been, Jared!
What a fool!

938
00:51:54,202 --> 00:51:56,500
They set a trap for me
and used the Governor
to spring it.

939
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,095
Then there's no ship
from Spain?

940
00:51:58,173 --> 00:52:00,266
Of course
there's a ship from Spain.

941
00:52:00,342 --> 00:52:02,640
Probably a converted
man-of-war,
armed to the gallows

942
00:52:02,711 --> 00:52:05,771
and ready to blast us
to the bottom of the sea.

943
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,878
Alter course, Jared.

944
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:10,580
Narbonne can have his ship
from Spain.

945
00:52:10,652 --> 00:52:11,983
And we'll have
his ships from Paris

946
00:52:12,054 --> 00:52:13,646
and hoist him
by his own petard!

947
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:14,780
Helm, hard a-larboard!

948
00:52:14,856 --> 00:52:16,016

949
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,889

to buy you some earrings

952
00:52:23,565 --> 00:52:25,726

of yours.

953
00:52:27,636 --> 00:52:28,728

957
00:52:48,156 --> 00:52:49,555
Make it so.

958
00:52:56,598 --> 00:53:00,625
Prepare for action, Jared.
She's flying
the Narbonne flag.

959
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:03,330
Aye, sir.

when we leave New Orleans.

I don't want to
be recognized either.

982
00:54:43,872 --> 00:54:45,897
Then why don't
you stay in your cabin?

983
00:54:45,974 --> 00:54:48,738
Because I belong up here,
but you don't.

1080
01:03:16,317 --> 01:03:19,912
As <i>Madame</i> Narbonne,
she recognized it would be
most unseemly for her

1081
01:03:19,987 --> 01:03:22,979
to be jealous of anyone
but <i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne.

1082
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,355
You are speaking
of <i>Mademoiselle</i> Villon?

1083
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,951
Of course.

1084
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:33,367
Forgive me, Captain,
I assumed you would've been
the first to have heard.

1085
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:35,163
It appears
I've made a dreadful mistake.

1086
01:03:35,236 --> 01:03:38,763
Apparently, I have been saved
from making a greater one.

1087
01:03:45,413 --> 01:03:46,607
Robert.

1088
01:03:50,351 --> 01:03:52,080
This is a surprise.

1089
01:03:52,153 --> 01:03:54,144
It is a day
of surprises, <i>madame.</i>

1090
01:03:54,222 --> 01:03:56,281
My belated
best wishes to you,

1091
01:03:56,357 --> 01:03:58,723
and my congratulations
to <i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne.

1092
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:02,392
No anger, Robert?
That's not very flattering.

1093
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,397
At the risk
of upsetting you, <i>madame,</i>

1094
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:07,662
I find myself less angry
than perplexed.

1095
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:10,802
How well you control
your emotions, Robert.

1096
01:04:10,872 --> 01:04:12,965
But you did come to see me.

1097
01:04:13,207 --> 01:04:15,505
And I must confess
I'm pleased.

1098
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,104
A minor confession, <i>madame.</i>

1099
01:04:18,379 --> 01:04:20,244
No other is important.

1100
01:04:21,516 --> 01:04:24,849
There was always one fault
with being in love with you.

1101
01:04:24,919 --> 01:04:27,251
You could do so well
without me.

1102
01:04:28,356 --> 01:04:30,722
With Alexander,
it's different.

1103
01:04:30,925 --> 01:04:34,759
He needs me.
I have the position to go
with his wealth.

1104
01:04:35,229 --> 01:04:38,221
It's a convenient arrangement
for both of us.

1105
01:04:39,233 --> 01:04:42,168
And, Robert,
it's an arrangement

1106
01:04:42,236 --> 01:04:46,502
that needn't too
much affect you and me.

1107
01:04:47,141 --> 01:04:50,907
When last we met,
you were quite violent
about a young lady.

1108
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:54,439
I was just thinking
of the names you called her.

1109
01:04:54,749 --> 01:04:57,775
Are you comparing me
to that guttersnipe?

1110
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,686
No longer, <i>madame,</i>
the comparison
is too unfair to her.

1111
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:05,825
Then I suggest you leave here
and return to her.

1112
01:05:05,927 --> 01:05:08,191
No suggestion
was ever more welcome, <i>madame.</i>

1113
01:05:08,262 --> 01:05:12,392
I called to offer you
my congratulations.
I now extend my sympathy.

1114
01:05:12,967 --> 01:05:13,956
Get out.

1115
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,469
Your husband
will soon discover
you are without honor.

1116
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:19,335
You will soon discover
he is without wealth.

1117
01:05:19,407 --> 01:05:22,672
This should be
a happy arrangement
for both of you.

1118
01:05:23,411 --> 01:05:27,279
You see,
it has been a day
of surprises, <i>madame.</i>

1119
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:43,754
Patout, is it true
that Alexander
is in financial difficulties?

1120
01:05:43,831 --> 01:05:45,458
Captain Kingston
tell you this?

1121
01:05:45,533 --> 01:05:47,091
Does it make any difference
who told me?

1122
01:05:47,168 --> 01:05:48,328
A great deal, <i>madame,</i>

1123
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:52,168
since it is my belief
he is responsible
for those difficulties.

1124
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,264
Kingston?

1125
01:05:53,341 --> 01:05:56,936
Or should I say, Baptiste,
since they are one
and the same?

1126
01:05:57,011 --> 01:05:58,205
You're out of your mind.

1127
01:05:58,279 --> 01:06:00,770
Both your husband
and I have every reason
to believe this.

1128
01:06:00,848 --> 01:06:02,213
Then why haven't
you gone to the police?

1129
01:06:02,283 --> 01:06:03,307
For one reason, <i>madame.</i>

1130
01:06:03,384 --> 01:06:06,114
Because you and
your uncle have
always been his protector.

1131
01:06:06,187 --> 01:06:08,587
I would like nothing better
than to see him hang.

1132
01:06:08,656 --> 01:06:10,681
If <i>madame</i>
truly feels that way,

1133
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,158
perhaps we can arrange
that event.

1134
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:18,665
We have manifests of
all the cargos lost when
Baptiste looted our ships.

1135
01:06:19,567 --> 01:06:22,661
If any of these cargos
are found
aboard Kingston's ship,

1136
01:06:22,737 --> 01:06:24,796
we have the proof we need.

1137
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,099
I see.

1138
01:06:26,707 --> 01:06:29,642
Send Alexander to me
as soon as he returns.

1139
01:06:30,011 --> 01:06:34,710
<i>Madame,</i> should the charges
be proffered
by the Governor's niece,

1140
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:37,250
Captain Duval would
act even more quickly.

1141
01:06:37,351 --> 01:06:41,151
Of course,
and Captain Kingston
would be even more unhappy.

1142
01:06:46,894 --> 01:06:48,885
We've had
an anxious day, Captain,

1143
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,830
wondering if it would be you
or the police
who would call on us.

1144
01:06:51,899 --> 01:06:53,833
I haven't even
let Debbie unpack.

1145
01:06:53,901 --> 01:06:56,563
It is safe for her
to do so, but I'm here
to ask her not to.

1146
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:58,229
DEBBIE: Why not?

1147
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:01,305
Does my presence
in New Orleans embarrass you?

1148
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:04,037
On the contrary,
New Orleans itself
embarrasses me.

1149
01:07:04,111 --> 01:07:07,410
Therefore
I'm sailing immediately
and want you to go with me.

1150
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:12,043
Won't that be
a little awkward?
You and I and <i>Madame</i> Narbonne?

1151
01:07:13,554 --> 01:07:15,317
Then you know?
Yes.

1152
01:07:15,389 --> 01:07:17,789
<i>Madame</i> Brizar was
kind enough to tell me.

1153
01:07:17,858 --> 01:07:19,257
At which point I discovered

1154
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:22,160
that even a woman
doesn't understand women.

1155
01:07:22,229 --> 01:07:26,222
They're very
unpredictable creatures,
as you're about to find out.

1156
01:07:27,134 --> 01:07:29,694
Debbie, I don't think
you understand.

1157
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:31,829
There's nothing
to stop us now.

1158
01:07:31,906 --> 01:07:35,342
I'm ready
to turn the ship around
and keep on sailing.

1159
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,002
So now you're ready?
Well, I'm not.

1160
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:42,005
When you thought
you could have
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Villon,

1161
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:43,607
you didn't want me.

1162
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:46,244
Well, now that you
can't have her,
I don't want you.

1163
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,480
I came here, Debbie,

1164
01:07:47,555 --> 01:07:52,015
because I discovered that
it wasn't <i>Mademoiselle</i> Villon
that I loved, it was you.

1165
01:07:52,093 --> 01:07:55,187
And I've discovered
that I want no part of you.

1166
01:07:55,429 --> 01:07:58,489
I wasn't good enough
for you and your friends
last night.

1167
01:07:58,566 --> 01:08:01,399
Well, they're not
good enough for me today.

1168
01:08:02,636 --> 01:08:04,968
Debbie, stop acting
like a fool.

1169
01:08:08,943 --> 01:08:12,538
I wonder what
your high and mighty friends
would say if they knew

1170
01:08:12,613 --> 01:08:17,482
that the gallant
Captain Kingston was really
Frederic Baptiste, a pirate.

1171
01:08:18,853 --> 01:08:20,548
Why don't you tell them?

1172
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:30,860
Ahoy, Jared!

1173
01:08:31,365 --> 01:08:32,491
Answer him.

1174
01:08:37,204 --> 01:08:38,728
Ahoy, Captain!

1175
01:08:48,282 --> 01:08:51,251
How fitting that
Captain Kingston should
be the first to know

1176
01:08:51,318 --> 01:08:53,377
we have captured Baptiste.

1177
01:08:55,156 --> 01:08:58,091
She wasted no time
in coming to you, did she?

1178
01:08:58,292 --> 01:09:01,090
Did you expect her to?

<i>And maybe seven more</i>

1226
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:37,377
<i>And now I go to meet my love</i>
<i>His ship has come ashore</i>

1227
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:39,783
(ALL CHEERING)

1228
01:11:40,054 --> 01:11:41,112
Now.

1229
01:11:43,557 --> 01:11:45,218
(SHOUTING)

1230
01:11:49,063 --> 01:11:50,690
(BLOWING WHISTLE)

1231
01:12:08,549 --> 01:12:13,009
I do not condemn
your motive, my son,
only your method.

1232
01:12:14,154 --> 01:12:17,055
No other method
would've been as effective.

1233
01:12:17,358 --> 01:12:20,418
To live by the sword
is to perish by the sword.

1234
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,652
You see
where it has brought you?

1235
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:26,427
If you'll permit me, Father,
I see more clearly
where a woman has brought me.

1236
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,298
I have been to see this
<i>Mademoiselle</i> McCoy.

1237
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:31,600
She denies
having betrayed you.

1238
01:12:32,106 --> 01:12:33,505
And I believe her.

1239
01:12:33,607 --> 01:12:36,906
Father, in your calling,
you're supposed to believe.

1240
01:12:40,381 --> 01:12:43,145
Gentlemen, I'm overwhelmed
by this honor.

1241
01:12:43,217 --> 01:12:44,343
And well you
should be, pirate,

1242
01:12:44,418 --> 01:12:46,477
for <i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne
has come to offer you mercy.

1243
01:12:46,553 --> 01:12:49,681
<i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne's mercy
can be more dangerous
than his threats.

1244
01:12:49,757 --> 01:12:52,123
I pray
you will be generous, sir.

1245
01:12:52,192 --> 01:12:54,888
<i>Monsieur</i> Narbonne
has come as a friend.

1246
01:12:56,697 --> 01:12:59,359
And you're badly in need
of friends, Baptiste.

1247
01:12:59,433 --> 01:13:01,958
The Governor
has refused to see you.

1248
01:13:02,636 --> 01:13:05,230
Your execution
is scheduled for dawn.

1249
01:13:05,639 --> 01:13:09,575
It appears that all is fair
in love and war,
and I have lost at both.

1250
01:13:09,643 --> 01:13:10,701
(CHUCKLES)

1251
01:13:10,778 --> 01:13:12,143
Perhaps not.

1252
01:13:12,212 --> 01:13:13,304
I have come to
make you an offer.

1253
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,938
Which you are
in no position
to refuse.

1254
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,539
I am all ears, gentlemen.

1255
01:13:16,617 --> 01:13:18,949
In exchange for
a simple statement from you,

1256
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:22,546
I'm convinced
I can persuade the Governor
to offer you a pardon,

1257
01:13:22,623 --> 01:13:24,989
on the condition
that you leave
New Orleans forever.

1258
01:13:25,059 --> 01:13:27,118
And what is to be the nature
of this statement?

1259
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:30,561
A simple confession
that the money you turned over
to the Seamen's Fund

1260
01:13:30,631 --> 01:13:35,125
for the purchase of
new ships was really mine,
procured by selling my cargo.

1261
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:38,035
The court will then rule
those transactions illegal.

1262
01:13:38,105 --> 01:13:40,596
And compel the owners
of these ships
to sign them over to you.

1263
01:13:40,674 --> 01:13:42,005
Precisely.

1264
01:13:42,409 --> 01:13:46,436
I would like nothing better
than to sign such a statement,
but I'm afraid I can't.

1265
01:13:46,513 --> 01:13:47,707
Why not?

1266
01:13:47,781 --> 01:13:49,476
You can't deny
that you raided my ships.

1267
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:52,519
I can deny it.
In fact, I will deny it.

1268
01:13:52,586 --> 01:13:54,520
Then you'll hang.
Too bad.

1269
01:13:54,588 --> 01:13:57,148
It seems
such a ridiculous way to die.

1270
01:13:57,224 --> 01:14:00,057
Come, Patout,
we're just wasting our time.

1271
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:01,784
Open.
<i>Monsieur,</i>

1272
01:14:01,962 --> 01:14:04,021
my compliments
to your wife.

1273
01:14:04,098 --> 01:14:05,963
And my apologies
for finding it
impossible to

1274
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:08,399
replenish
the Narbonne fortune.

1275
01:14:08,469 --> 01:14:12,200
She will at least have
the satisfaction
of seeing you hang.

1276
01:14:14,608 --> 01:14:17,543
As well as the reward
for having exposed you.

1277
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:21,807
<i>Monsieur</i> Patout!

1278
01:14:22,649 --> 01:14:25,049
You will never know
how happy you've made me.

1279
01:14:36,397 --> 01:14:39,093
Line up, all of you.
Line up.

1280
01:14:41,135 --> 01:14:42,568
What is all this, Sergeant?

1281
01:14:42,636 --> 01:14:44,331
The fight at
the Catfish, Captain.

1282
01:14:44,405 --> 01:14:46,134
The information you had
was correct.

1283
01:14:46,206 --> 01:14:47,696
Lock them up.

1284
01:14:47,975 --> 01:14:49,602
Merely a routine brawl.

1285
01:14:51,044 --> 01:14:53,239
Bring them along. Open up.

1286
01:14:54,882 --> 01:14:56,144
Come along.

1287
01:14:59,553 --> 01:15:01,350
Hurry up. Move along.

1288
01:15:02,156 --> 01:15:03,214
Go on, get in there!

1289
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:04,348
Now!

1290
01:15:28,348 --> 01:15:29,872
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> the keys.

1291
01:15:32,419 --> 01:15:33,545
Come on.

1292
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:39,149
JARED: Debbie!

1293
01:15:39,226 --> 01:15:40,523
Jared!

1294
01:15:41,295 --> 01:15:42,421
Quick, where is he?

1295
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:45,021
In the next cell.
Give me the keys.

1296
01:15:46,133 --> 01:15:47,794
Debbie, is it any wonder
I love you?

1297
01:15:47,868 --> 01:15:49,995
Hurry, they'll have
reinforcements here
any moment.

1298
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:52,561
If I hang for it,
I'll have a kiss.

1299
01:15:53,173 --> 01:15:55,971
There'll be
time for that later.
Come on.

1300
01:16:02,783 --> 01:16:04,375
(BELL RINGING)

1301
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:12,588
Eight bells
and all's well.

1302
01:16:15,896 --> 01:16:17,523
How right he is.
