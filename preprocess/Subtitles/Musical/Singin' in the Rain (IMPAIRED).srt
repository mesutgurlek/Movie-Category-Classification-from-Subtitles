...just in case it doesn't come off.
I'm worried about Lina.

1114

She doesn't like Miss Selden.
There might be fireworks.

Now, what about the story?

We need modern musical numbers.

1132

We throw a modern section into it.

1133
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,588
The hero's a hoofer on Broadway.

1134
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,214
He sings and he dances.

1135

One night, backstage, he's reading
The Tale of Two Cities.

A sandbag hits his head.

1137
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:12,804
He dreams he's back
during the French Revolution.

1138
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,473
This way, we get in
the modern dancing numbers.

1139
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,934
But in the dream,
we can still use the costumes.

It's a new one.
It's for the modern part.

It's called "Broadway Melody."

she's the only one who's finished.

1264
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:53,322
Who'll hear of her?

1265
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:56,700
Everybody. Why do you think
Zelda's in such a sweat?

1266
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,702
Kathy nearly stole
the picture from her.

1267
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,913
She's only doing you a favor
in The Dancing Cavalier.

1268
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:04,208
And she's getting
full screen credit for it too.

1269
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:08,212
It'll say on the screen
that I don't talk and sing for myself?

1270
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,297
Of course. What do you think?

1271
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:12,549
- They can't do that.
- It's already done.

1272
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:15,094
There's a whole
publicity campaign planned.

1273
01:31:15,387 --> 01:31:16,804
Publicity?

1274
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:18,889
They can't make a fool out of me.

1275
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:21,725
They can't make a laughingstock
out of Lina Lamont.

1276
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:24,895
What do they think I am,
dumb or something?

1277
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:27,439
Why, I make more money...

1278
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:30,109
...than Calvin Coolidge...

1279
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,194
...put together!

1280
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:38,951
ROD: "Monumental Pictures enthusiastic
over Lina's singing and dancing."

1281
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:40,244
I never said that.

1282
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:44,415
"Premiere tomorrow night to reveal
Lina Lamont, big musical talent."

1283
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:47,751
You can't pull a switch like this
on the publicity department.

1284
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:50,087
We were prepared
for the Selden campaign.

1285
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,423
Now you do this.
At least keep us informed.

1286
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:55,384
Wait a minute.
I don't know anything about this.

1287
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:56,844
What are we gonna do?

1288
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:58,053
LINA:
Nothing.

1289
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:01,598
Absolutely nothing.

1290
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:04,935
You wouldn't wanna call the papers
and say Lina Lamont...

1291
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:07,438
...is a big fat liar.

1292
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:09,273
Did you send this stuff out?

1293
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:12,901
I gave an exclusive story
to every paper in town.

1294
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:15,279
You'll never get away with it.
Call the papers.

1295
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,281
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1296
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:19,575
Don't tell me what to do, Lina.

1297
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:23,287
What do you think I am,
dumb or something?

1298
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:26,623
I had my lawyer go over my contract.

1299
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:27,958
Contract?

1300
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:30,794
And I control my publicity, not you.

1301
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,171
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1302
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:35,382
The studio is responsible
for every word printed about me.

1303
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:38,677
If I don't like it, I can sue.

1304
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,012
What?

1305
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:42,473
I can sue.

1306
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:45,642
If you tell the papers
about Kathy Selden...

1307
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:50,606
...it would be "detrimental
and deleterious" to my career.

1308
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:54,401
I could sue you for the whole studio.

1309
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,904
- That's a lot of nonsense.
- Says so.

1310
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:58,530
Right here.

1311
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:03,327
Contract dated June 8, 1925,
paragraph 34, subdivision letter A.

1312
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:05,537
"The party of the first part..."

1313
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:07,623
- That's me.
- You win, Lina.

1314
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:10,459
We better take Kathy's
credit card off the screen.

1315
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:12,002
All right, go ahead.

1316
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:14,421
Let's just get
this premiere over with.

1317
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:16,006
Satisfied?

1318
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:18,717
There's just one little thing more.

1319
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:23,222
You want me to change the name of
the studio to Lamont Pictures, Inc.?

1320
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:25,474
R.F., you're cute.

1321
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,518
Now, I was just thinking.

1322
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:30,229
You've given her
a part in Zelda's picture...

1323
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:33,023
...and you'll give her
a bigger one in the next.

1324
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:34,817
So, what?

1325
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:37,736
If she's done such a grand job
doubling for my voice...

1326
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:41,323
...don't you think she ought to
go on doing just that?

1327
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:43,826
- And nothing else.
- You're out of your mind.

1328
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:47,079
I'm still more important
to the studio than she is.

1329
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:49,081
I wouldn't do that to her
in a million years.

1330
01:33:49,332 --> 01:33:52,835
You'd take her career away.
People don't do things like that.

1331
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:54,586
People?

1332
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:56,713
I ain't people.

1333
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:58,757
I am a...

1334
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:06,557
"A shimmering, glowing star
in the cinema firmament."

1335
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:08,559
It says so...

1336
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:10,227
...right there.

1337
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:27,578
Oh, Pierre, Pierre, my darling.
At last, I've found you.

1338
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:28,787
Oh, Pierre.

1339
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:32,791
Pierre, you're hurt.
Speak to me, speak to me.

1340
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:37,629
[SINGIN]
I'll kiss her with a sigh

1341
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,215
Would you?

1342
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:42,384
Would you?

1343
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:46,722
And if the girl were I

1344
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:48,557
Would you?

1345
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,143
Would you?

1346
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:54,897
Oh, Pierre, hold me
in your arms always.

1347
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:56,398
Lockwood's a sensation.

1348
01:34:56,608 --> 01:35:00,277
Yes, but Lamont! What a voice!
Isn't she marvelous?

1349
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:03,071
- It's going over wonderfully, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1350
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:07,618
Our love will last
till the stars turn cold.

1351
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:12,956
[SINGING]
And would you dare to say

1352
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:18,295
Let's do the same as they

1353
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:21,356
I would

1354
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:29,139
Would you?

1355
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:38,482
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDS]

1356
01:35:52,956 --> 01:35:54,331
R.F., it's a real smash.

1357
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:57,209
- Congratulations. We owe you a lot.
- Thank you.

1358
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,336
- Kathy, we made it!
- It's a miracle!

1359
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:01,380
It's great, Don. Just great.

1360
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:04,508
You were fabulous.
You sang as well as Kathy Selden.

1361
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:07,678
And I'm gonna for a long time.

1362
01:36:07,845 --> 01:36:08,845
What do you mean?

1363
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:12,349
I mean she's gonna go
right on singing for me.

1364
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:13,725
Listen, Lina.

1365
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:17,688
I thought something was cooking
beneath those bleached curls.

1366
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:21,024
Kathy has her own career.
She only did this for this picture.

1367
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:22,693
That's what you think.

1368
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:24,528
Come on, come on.

1369
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:27,030
- Lina's getting carried away.
- Yeah, she is.

1370
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:28,699
Listen, you boa constrictor.

1371
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:31,743
Don't get any fancy ideas
about the future. Tell her!

1372
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:34,371
Never mind, R.F.!
Listen to that applause.

1373
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:36,248
Wait till the money rolls in.

1374
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:40,419
You won't give all that up because
a nobody don't wanna be my voice.

1375
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:42,629
She's got something.
It's a gold mine.

1376
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,007
Part of that choice is mine.

1377
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:46,508
And I just won't do it.

1378
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:50,345
You've got a five-year contract.
You'll do what R.F. says.

1379
01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:53,056
What's the matter?
Why don't you tell her off?

1380
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:55,142
I'm confused.
This thing is so big...

1381
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:58,562
- They're tearing the house apart.
- Take a curtain call.

1382
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:01,064
I once gave you a cigar.
Can I have it back?

1383
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:04,568
Listen! I'm an avalanche!
Selden, you're stuck.

1384
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:08,071
If this happens, get a new boy.
I won't stand for it.

1385
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:11,700
Who needs you? They'd come to see me
if I played opposite a monkey!

1386
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:13,243
Don's a smash too.

1387
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:16,079
I'll say a few words.
I'm still running the studio.

1388
01:37:16,289 --> 01:37:17,748
I'm not so sure!

1389
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:21,251
You're Mr. Producer,
always running things, running me.

1390
01:37:21,461 --> 01:37:24,921
From now on, as far as I'm concerned,
I'm running things.

1391
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:27,507
- Lina Lamont Pictures, Inc., huh?
- Yeah.

1392
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:29,426
You've gone a little too far.

1393
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:31,928
- They're yelling for a speech.
- A speech?

1394
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:35,057
Yeah, everybody's always making
speeches for me.

1395
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:39,603
Tonight, I'm gonna do my own talking.
I'm gonna make the speech!

1396
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:42,773
ROD: No, please!
DON: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1397
01:37:43,066 --> 01:37:46,943
This is Lina's big night
and she's entitled to do the talking.

1398
01:37:48,196 --> 01:37:50,447
- Right?
- Right.

1399
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:57,412
Ladies and gentlemen.

1400
01:37:57,622 --> 01:37:58,705
I can't tell you...

1401
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:01,083
...how thrilled we are
at your reception...

1402
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:05,295
...for The Dancing Cavalier,
our first musical picture together.

1403
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:09,841
If we bring a little joy
into your humdrum lives...

1404
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:12,344
...it makes us feel
as though our hard work...

1405
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:15,097
...ain't been in vain for nothing.

1406
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:17,933
Bless you all.

1407
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:19,851
She didn't sound that way
in the picture.

1408
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:21,728
Cut the talk, Lina. Sing!

1409
01:38:22,772 --> 01:38:25,565
MAN 1: Sing us a song, Lina.
Sing to us.

1410
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,193
MAN 2: Please.
MAN 3: Come on, Lina, sing.

1411
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:30,987
DON:
I got an idea. Come here.

1412
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:32,239
Now, listen.

1413
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:38,453
LINA:
What am I gonna do?

1414
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:41,623
We've got it.
