1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,997
Yeah, we're walkin'. Yep.

2
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,356
(Small group applauds and cheers)

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,749
- Nice to meet you, Mr Darin.
- Thank you very much.

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,360
Bobby, we've got an AP interview tomorrow...

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,630
- AP interview?
- It's only two minutes.

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,150
It's my night with my wife and kid,
for us to experience it.

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,830
It's only two minutes. That's all I'm asking.

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,316
It's my one night I don't have to do that.
It's my anniversary celebration.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,828
You missed them in Florida. We can't avoid 'em.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,871
MAN: Good luck, Bobby.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,911
# Mack The Knife

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,640
- Bobby, have a good evening.
- Thank you.

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,231
Hey, Charlie.

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,915
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,430
<i>tonight, celebrating his 10th
anniversary in show business,</i>

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,396
<i>the Coconut Grove is proud to present
the one, the only Bobby Darin!</i>

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,431
(Cheering)

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,750
Thank you.

19
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,155
Three guesses.

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,236
Wrong.

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,200
# Oh, the shark, babe

22
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,390
# Has such teeth, dear

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,870
# And he shows them pearly white

24
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,234
# Just a jackknife - ah so metamuk -

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,238
# Wears MacHeath, babe

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,909
# And he keeps it out of sight

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,839
- Two, three and one...
# You know when that shark bites

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,871
# With his teeth, babe

29
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,634
# Scarlet billows start to spread

30
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,675
# Fancy gloves though

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,792
# Wears old MacHeath, babe

32
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,469
# So there's never... never a trace of red

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,476
Darlin', then we'll swing.

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,476
# On a sidewalk

35
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,511
# Ooh, Sunday morning, ah-ha

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,875
# Lies a body

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,070
# Just oozing life

38
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,793
# Eeh! Some... Eeh!
Someone's sneaking

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,910
# Round the corner

40
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,751
# Tell me, could that someone...

41
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,513
Stop! Stop! Richie, stop! Stop!

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,074
- Hold it!
(Band stops playing)

43
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,875
OK, I want to start over. I want to do it again.

44
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,196
- You're kidding me. That was perfect.
- I want to do it again.

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,312
- I can do it better.
- Know how long it takes to set this up?

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,511
I don't know how much more
my chops can take today, boss.

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,120
When you start playing it right,
we can all call it a day,

48
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,799
but when you play it sloppy
like you been doing,

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,673
then we're gonna do it again and again
until we get it right.

50
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,632
- Bobby, the guys are tired, that's all.
- How do you think I feel?

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,193
Call it.

52
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,471
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm gonna let you leave in a minute...

53
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,069
Whoa! Please stay in your seats
until Mr Darin has left the set.

54
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,350
Thank you. Can we have the bell up, please?

55
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,391
(Bell rings)

56
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,955
Bobby, we can't keep doin' it
over and over and over.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,037
If Bobby says he can get it better,
then he can get it better.

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,959
- What the hell's he snapping at everybody for?
- Just let him walk it off.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,673
Mr Darin, do you want to start
from the very top?

60
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,712
Hey, Bobby, you know we've got
press on the set today,

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,751
can you give 'em a few minutes?

62
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,199
<i>CREW: Ready to go in ten minutes.</i>

63
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,515
And no-one is discarded.

64
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,832
- How you doin'?
- I don't know, Charlie.

65
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,190
Ah, you'll figure it out.
C'mon, let's go back upstairs.

66
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,471
Put those two pieces together.
I'll look at 'em after lunch.

67
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,875
Mr Darin? David said
I'd get a few minutes today.

68
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,876
- Do you mind if we do this now?
- He's busy.

69
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,390
Nobody's ever done something
quite like this, about their own life.

70
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,715
Sure, they have. It's a self-portrait on film.

71
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,035
Think you can be objective about your own life?

72
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,868
Listen, this guy was raised
to always tell the truth,

73
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,876
and that's what he's doing.

74
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,354
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I'm his brother-in-law.

75
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,356
So you mess with him, you mess with me.

76
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,789
I'm not messing with anyone, sir.
But being honest,

77
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,912
isn't the real truth
he's too old to play this part?

78
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,599
He was born to play the part
and you damn well know it.

79
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,232
<i>Get outta here!</i>

80
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,510
- Thanks, Charlie.
- That's just crap!

81
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,030
How can you be too old to play yourself?
C'mon! Let's get started.

82
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,193
OK, everybody... I want to change the opening.

83
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,037
- What?
- Why, Bobby?

84
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,514
We can't start with Mack,
we blow our wad too soon.

85
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,358
Opening with Mack is brave.

86
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,676
It says, "You want me? Fuck you! Here I am."

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,676
No. It's wrong.

88
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,474
- Let's just do Hello Young Lovers.
- Bobby, start when you got sick.

89
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,318
Nina, it's his story. Let him work it out.

90
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,476
<i>No, no, no. I know what's important here.</i>

91
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,556
Everything starts when he got sick.

92
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,750
- Uh-uh...
- Nina, please. Don't.

93
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,678
No, I think we should start when
they booed me off the stage.

94
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,757
<i>Nobody's gonna come see
you get booed off the stage.</i>

95
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,075
Stick with the hits. That's what sells.

96
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,714
How do you know
what people will come to see, Boom-Boom?

97
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,116
<i>- When did you become the big expert?
- You tell him, Bobby.</i>

98
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,153
<i>As long as I've known you,
as far as you're concerned, I am the expert.</i>

99
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,679
<i>BOY: Bullshit!</i>

100
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,518
- Who was that?
- That's the kid playing him as a kid.

101
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,915
<i>- Get down from there, kid.
CREW: I'll sort this out.</i>

102
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,872
<i>- We're not ready for you yet.
- Take five.</i>

103
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,514
- Wait. I wanna hear what he has to say.
- Jesus Christ!

104
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,356
What did you just say, kid?

105
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,709
I said that's bullshit.

106
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,116
- What's bullshit?
- That you know him better than anybody.

107
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,470
Great. A miniature version of you,
and he's a method actor.

108
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,112
<i>I need a drink.</i>

109
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,628
- He looks just like him.
- I know, it looks like him.

110
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,956
- I'll be back.
DAVID: Here we go again.

111
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,350
So, you're playing me.

112
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,837
- I am you.
- You think you got me down?

113
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,075
I know you better than they do.

114
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,554
We could do it 100 times,
it'd never be good enough.

115
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,160
It's OK if he yells at me,
but not at the other guys.

116
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,714
They've been working their asses off, man.

117
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,115
I've never worked
with such an arrogant asshole.

118
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,157
Listen, you prick.

119
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,273
There are four people here who can't be fired.
You're not one of 'em.

120
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,392
He might be an asshole...but he's our asshole!

121
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,438
Look, he finally found himself.

122
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,471
<i>So how do you think we should start?</i>

123
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,876
You want some truth? I'll give you some truth.

124
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,871
(Children playing)

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,116
<i>BOBBY: The kid is right.</i>

126
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,435
<i>This is how to begin -</i>

127
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,436
<i>on the street where I grew up,</i>

128
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,870
<i>with my sister Nina, my brother-in-law Charlie,</i>

129
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,152
<i>and, to me, the greatest
in the world - my mother Polly.</i>

130
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,272
Mrs Cassotto, I'm sorry to have to tell you.

131
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,880
<i>BOBBY: Ow.
- The boy has rheumatic fever.</i>

132
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,480
CHARLIE: What is it?
- It's a strep infection.

133
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,750
But why is it so painful?

134
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,758
<i>DOCTOR: Rheumatic fever damages the heart.</i>

135
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,394
It affects the joints and the muscles, too.

136
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,034
So, what do we do, Doctor?
How do I make him feel better?

137
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,435
<i>Just make him as comfortable as possible.</i>

138
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,436
<i>POLLY: Just tell us the truth.</i>

139
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,869
You can never go wrong with the truth.

140
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,471
Even with the best medical care in the world,

141
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,910
<i>the boy will be lucky to see his 15th birthday.</i>

142

(Bobby coughs)

143
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,996
<i>CHARLIE: Come and sit down, Doctor.</i>

144
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,191
POLLY: What are you doing? Come on, Bobby.

145
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,959
Silly man doesn't know what he's talking about.

146
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,833
<i>Come on, let's get you back into bed.</i>

147
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,033
Mama, tell me about my father.

148
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,675
You know all about your father.
You just rest now.

149
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,029
But I like to hear you tell it.

150
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,071
Well...

151
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,078
Sam Cassotto was an important man.

152
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,789
He was a cabinet maker,

153
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,798
but then he started working for another man.

154
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,958
- Who was a gangster?
- Walden Robert Cassotto!

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,150
He was a businessman.

156
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,391
I thought you said you could
never go wrong with the truth.

157
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,750
All right, he was a gangster.

158
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,189
But he never did anything for this family.

159
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:12,150
But your father, Sam Cassotto,
he was a loyal and good man.

160
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,274
<i>And he would've been so proud of you.</i>

161
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,510
Keep the noise down, all right?
I want it to be a surprise.

162
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,476
Don't wake the kid, see?

163
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,636
(Car horn toots)
- Hey!

164
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,831
You wake my kid, I'm gonna
stick that horn up your fat ass.

165
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,950
You hear?

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,991
(Piano music)

167
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,190
# Up a lazy river by the old mill run

168
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,915
# Lazy lazy river in the noonday sun

169
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,794
# Linger awhile in the shade of a tree

170
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,435
# Throw away your troubles,
dream a dream of me...

171
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,556
Y'know, before your sister was born,

172
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,795
this is what your mama did for a living.

173
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,832
<i>Music opened a whole new world to me.</i>

174
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,873
<i>No matter how bad I feel,
no matter how sad or sick I am,</i>

175
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,275
<i>I just touch these keys and "Poof!"</i>

176
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,232
like magic, I always seem to feel better.

177
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,754
I've always known you had talent, Bobby.

178
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,076
This piano is for you. Charlie worked hard for it.

179
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,395
See, God wouldn't have made you
suffer so much

180
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,715
if he weren't gonna make up for it later.

181
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,837
# I'm happy you can be

182
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,999
# Up a lazy river with me

183
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,031
(Bobby plays a high C)

184
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,959
<i>Mama was right about music.</i>

185
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,118
<i>It opened a whole new world to me,
outside of time and illness.</i>

186
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,151
<i>A world I could live in.</i>

187
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,390
# Throw away your troubles,
baby, dream a dream with me

188
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,950
# Up a lazy river with me

189
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,156
<i>I knew then if I could live to 10,</i>

190
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,509
<i>maybe I'd make it to 15, and then maybe 20.</i>

191
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,348
<i>From then on, music was the most
important thing in my life.</i>

192
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,238
<i>Mama taught me all the moves
and dances from vaudeville</i>

193
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,271
<i>that made the greats stand out.</i>

194
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,357
<i>I would spend most days in bed with fever</i>

195
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,517
<i>but when I had the strength,
Mama and I would practise,</i>

196
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,710
<i>and practise, and practise,</i>

197
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,548
<i>until we created what she called "The Plan".</i>

198
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,160
# Up A Lazy River instrumental

199
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,631
(Unaccomplished tooting)

200
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,230
<i>Soon I would be old enough
to head to New York,</i>

201
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,158
<i>but Mama had one more lesson to teach.</i>

202
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,873
From the halfway mark!

203
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,117
To be a star, a big star,

204
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,038
<i>you've got to be talented, obviously.</i>

205
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,709
But you got to be tenacious, have charisma.

206
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,435
But most importantly, you gotta have...it!

207
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,919
The great intangible.

208
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,269
<i>And you've got it all, Bobby.</i>

209
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,470
You're gonna be bigger than Sinatra.

210
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,991
I'd settle for a little Jolson. Mama, Mama, Mama.

211
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,998
# There are blue skies up above

212
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,510
# For as long as we're in love

213
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,553
# We'll be up a lazy river

214
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,751
# Up a crazy, lazy river

215
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,399
# Up a lazy river

216
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,750
# I go in your way

217
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,671
# Get out of my way

218
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,398
# Up a lazy river with me

219
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,235
(Cheering and farewells)

220
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,112
<i>So part of Mama's plan...</i>

221
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,197
<i>YOUNG BOBBY: Wait a minute.
- What?</i>

222
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,552
You didn't go dancing down the street like that.

223
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,751
I know. It's a fantasy sequence.

224
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,678
- But it's not real.
- Forget real.

225
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,190
Listen, kid. Memories are like moonbeams.

226
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,834
We do with them what we want.

227
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,235
Oh. OK, then.

228
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,993
Go on. I'll be around when you need me.

229
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,595
Mama's plan was to surround myself
with the best.

230
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,108
<i>So I now had a manager
who had never managed -</i>

231
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,116
<i>Steve Boom-Boom Blauner,</i>

232
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,472
<i>a public relations guy who had never related
to the public - David Gershenson,</i>

233
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,830
<i>Behrke, who had only
conducted the high school band,</i>

234
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,759
<i>and my brother-in-law Charlie,
a garbage man, as my valet.</i>

235
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,880
Not in the school band now, huh, Bobby?

236
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,878
Let me tell you, when you come from nothing,
like us - like him -

237
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,275
<i>then you're destined to make a name
for yourself.</i>

238
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,629
And we will, Richie, we will.

239
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,195
Drive over there.
Drive over to those friggin' girls. Go on.

240
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,993
Go on! Hey, girls,
do you wanna see a real star?

241
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,190
<i>While Sinatra was playing at the Copa,</i>

242
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,199
<i>Walden Robert Cassotto would play
any place they would book him -</i>

243
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,119
<i>barmitzvahs, weddings,
and a few dives on Long Island.</i>

244
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,151
# Jump Down, Spin Around

245
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,956
# I saw a skeeter on my head

246
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,389
# Slipped and fell and killed him dead...

247
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,512
- Hey, kid, you ain't no Sinatra.
- Stop. Stop.

248
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,276
They're lazy. They don't like to rehearse.

249
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,675
They don't get better. They're wasting my time.

250
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,075
- It's only the Safari Club.
- I don't care!

251
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,351
We know three songs, they can't
keep pace with two of them.

252
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,437
Bobby, you didn't know what F sharp
was, now you're an expert?

253
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,630
Bobby, you called the Safari Club a disease.

254
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,114
- You guys sounded great.
- No, we sounded like shit.

255
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,116
The audience deserves better.

256
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,755
<i>I had a hot head, a weak heart
and an even worse stage name.</i>

257
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,270
<i>Walden Robert Cassotto isn't a name
you could see on a marquee.</i>

258
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,276
<i>Well, maybe for one night only.</i>

259
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,438
<i>One thing most performers were doing back
then was to find a great stage name.</i>

260
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,277
<i>And then one day, I saw it.</i>

261
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,675
<i>The perfect name.</i>

262
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,075
<i>Just blinking. Darin.</i>

263
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,908
<i>(Electrics fizz)
- Darin. Bobby Darin.</i>

264
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,795
<i>And no sooner did I change my name
that I got my first gig on television.</i>

265
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,828
# The Rock Island Line, it's a mighty good road

266
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,916
# Rock Island Line is the road to ride

267
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,916
# Rock Island Line...

268
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,394
<i>Unfortunately, I didn't know the lyrics
to the song,</i>

269
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,399
<i>so I had to devise my own method
to get through it on live television.</i>

270
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,431
# Ooh-ee

271
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,119
# Well, it's ABC WXYZ

272
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,355
# Cat's in the corner and he don't see me

273
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,789
# On the Rock Island Line, it's a mighty fine road

274
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,876
# Rock Island Line is the road to ride

275
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,990
# Rock Island Line, it's a mighty fine road

276
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,917
# And if you wanna ride it, gotta ride it...

277
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,518
<i>Didn't win me many fans.</i>

278
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:01,510
# On the Rock Island Line

279
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,476
<i>But it didn't finish me either.</i>

280
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,796
<i>My record company was giving me
one last chance to make a hit.</i>

281
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,796
Bobby, it's all about the image.

282
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,400
Are you starting again? It's my last session.

283
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,830
- You look like shit.
- I know my hair is falling out!

284
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,996
Next time you go on television, wear one.

285
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,474
- That looks so goddamn fake.
- John Wayne wears one.

286
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,034
Very authentic. Humphrey Bogart wears one.

287
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,868
- Bogart has an album coming out, does he?
- Sinatra wears one.

288
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,195
<i>(As Jerry Lewis) All right, Boom-Boom, you win.</i>

289
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,390
I'll go back to making the vinyl and the records,

290
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,874
and the putting the wax in the thing
and making it go.

291
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,956
Let's sing the song again, hello.

292
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,150
CHARLIE:
Does this song make any sense to you?

293
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,316
It takes place in a toilet. It shouldn't.

294
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,316
Maybe he should be in the shower.

295
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,828
- Guys don't take baths.
- I agree.

296
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,469
I put the tow... Wait, wait.
I wrap the towel around me,

297
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,715
<i>and then I jump back in the bath.</i>

298
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,716
How comes he jumps back in the tub?

299
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,196
- Doesn't he know these people?
- Where else should he go?

300
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,879
- We gotta play with it.
- Play, but just keep it to an hour.

301
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,558
That's all the time we got, Bobby.

302
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,556
Hey, tell me something.

303
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,672
Who's this guy, Yom Kippur,
they got booked on Friday?

304
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,713
# Splish splash, I was taking a bath

305
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,638

I want nightclubs, Vegas, movies, TV.

This album will make it happen all fast.

343

You don't have to prove anything.
You're a star already.

No. You don't. I don't know you.

- Hm?

462
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,400
What do you say
you and me have dinner tonight?

463
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,796
No, thank you. I'll have dinner
in my room and then go to bed early.

464
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,593
Oh, my goodness, how can you stand
all that excitement?

465
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,790
I'm not here for excitement. I'm here to work.

466
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,310
- Maybe you should go to sleep early, too.
- How do you know I don't?

467
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,794
Sandra Dee, have you been spying on me?

468
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,989
I have never worked with somebody
so unprofessional in my life.

469
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,918
- Have you ever even acted before?
- Well, I'm learning.

470
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,793
But, blondie, you're not
exactly Audrey Hepburn.

471
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,674
<i>OK, people, that's lunch. One hour.</i>

472
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,438
Poo-Poo, how you doin', boy?

473
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,790
The name's Pom-Pom and she's a girl.

474
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,673
Sandy, don't let that little cupcake
ruin your make-up.

475
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,476
Mary, there's something I don't understand,
you'll have to explain it.

476
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,509
What?

477
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,269
How is it possible that you are Sandy's mother,
not her sister?

478
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,711
Oh! (Tuts) Mr Darin.

479
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,077
No. I'm serious. Look at the two of you -
side by side, you're mirror images of each other.

480
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,430
Honey, when you smile,
just make it a really soft smile.

481
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,119
Keep your lips a little... That's good.

482
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,948
<i>There she is, Charlie, the girl I'm gonna marry.</i>

483
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,116
I want you to find me a florist, a good one.

484
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,197
I want to send 18 yellow roses
to her hotel suite every day.

485
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,834
<i>No cards. She'll know who they're from.</i>

486
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,589
I'll give it a week, maybe less.
It won't take that long for Mary to cave.

487
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,710
Mary?

488
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,149
You're gonna send roses to the mother?

489
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,591
You always make sure the mama dog likes you
before you go near her puppy.

490
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,036
Mary ain't no Rin Tin Tin.

491
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,197
She's a tough broad with a star to protect.

492
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,674
<i>You're gonna get yourself in a lot of trouble.</i>

493
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,836
Charlie, this is trouble I can handle.

494
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,236
<i>Your florist is gonna make more
out of this movie than you are.</i>

495
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,033
I know you want to act convincingly
and everything,

496
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,871
but in the front of your mind, think, "What are
my lips doing now? Where are my teeth?"

497
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,229
<i>Sandy and I just got off on the wrong foot.</i>

498
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,714
<i>If I could just get her away from her mother.</i>

499
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,070
<i>Just imagine, Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee.</i>

500
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,675
We have a photo shoot in less than an hour.

501
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,474
I want you to wear the dress the studio sent over
from Paris. Don't forget the belt.

502
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,911
<i>That's it. I'm gonna start
all over. Like we've never met.</i>

503
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,635
<i>Only this time I'll romance her
the best way I know.</i>

504
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,716
Hello, Sandra Dee, I'm Bobby Darin.

505
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,672
- I believe we're making a movie together.
- Hello.

506
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,111
# Beyond The Sea

507
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,512
# Somewhere beyond the sea

508
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,872
# Somewhere waiting for me

509
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,271
# My lover stands on golden sands

510
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,952
# And watches the ships that go sailing

511
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,199
# Somewhere beyond the sea

512
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,279
# She's there watching for me

513
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,394
# If I could fly like birds on high

514
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,309
# Then straight to her arms I'd go sailing

515
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,480
# It is far beyond the stars

516
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,318
# It is near beyond the moon

517
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,036
# And I know beyond a doubt

518
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,552
# My heart will lead me there soon

519
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,071
# We'll meet beyond the shore

520
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,590
# We'll kiss just as before

521
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,512
# Happy we'll be beyond the sea

522
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,759
# And never again I'll go sailing

523
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,110
# And I know beyond a doubt

524
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,751
<i># My heart will lead me there soon</i>

525
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,998
# We'll meet,
I know we'll meet beyond the shore

526
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,715
<i># We're gonna kissjust as before</i>

527
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,039
# And happy we'll be beyond the sea

528
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,516
# And never again, I'll go sailing...

529
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,757
Sandy, we have to go now.

530
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,791
I have an interview.

531
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,277
Tell 'em you met Bobby Darin
and he's gonna marry you.

532
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,596
Come on, Pom-Pom. Nice hat, Mr Darin.

533
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,630
- I think she likes me, Charlie.
- The mother?

534
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,478
- That's a different story.
- She's just doing her job.

535
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,511
What job is that?

536
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,476
Steering her daughter clear of guys like you!

537
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,591
Yeah, well, guess what, Charlie?

538
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,552
Mama's job just got a whole lot tougher.

539
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,273
(Laughs) Yeah. That's my boy.

540
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,071
# So long sailing

541
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,954
# Bye-bye, sailing

542
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,194
<i>So, Mr Darin, I've read that you
think very highly of yourself.</i>

543
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,915
Well, Miss Duvan, I'm a man
who was raised to believe

544
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,110
that you should have a plan in life.

545
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,109
So once I've set my mind to
achieving something, that's it.

546
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,235
Would you excuse me for a second?

547
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,231
She has a slight cold.

548
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,476
You know, Miss Duvan... Mary...

549
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,193
I just think your daughter's absolutely terrific.

550
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,038
I just think she's the most wonderful thing
on earth.

551
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,071
But she's still only a child.

552
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,680
What you need is an older woman.

553
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,631
I just wanna be friendly with her.

554
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,752
We're doing a movie together,
she acts like she don't even like me.

555
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,190
Give her time.
She's not very comfortable around strangers.

556
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,277
Mary, I got an idea.
Why don't you let me take her out?

557
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,392
- On a date?
- No, no, for publicity. One time.

558
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,670
<i>I'd never let her do anything like that.</i>

559
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,393
Mary, think about what it would mean
for the movie.

560
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,548
- One time?
- One time.

561
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,589
Well, maybe we can do something.

562
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,153
For publicity.

563
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,436
I swear undying fealty to thee,
Sandra Dee, Queen o' the Hop.

564
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,438
And I pronounce thee, Sir Splish Splash.

565
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,359
- Arise, Sir Splish Splash.
- How was that, guys?

566
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,994
- Whoa!
- What about Rock Hudson?

567
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,077
- Rock Hudson's great. Isn't he great?
- He's great.

568
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,156
- I say we ditch these clowns.
- What?

569
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,430
- As soon as I say "run", run.
- You like it here?

570
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,550
<i>- Terrific.
- You plan on more films together?</i>

571
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,875
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

572
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,638
Run. Run!

573
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,269
Hey!

574
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,311
(Sandra giggles)

575
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,316
Are you OK?

576
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,430
I can't believe I just did that.

577
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,751
God, you're beautiful.

578
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,996
Come on.

579
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,031
# Dream Lover

580
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,276
# Every night I hope and pray

581
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,869
# A dream lover will come my way

582
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,674
# A girl to hold in my arms

583
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,439
# And know the magic of her charms

584
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,358
# Because I want a girl

585
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,238
# To call my own

586
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,236
# I want a dream lover

587
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,236
# So I don't have to dream alone...

588
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,158
You OK? You look kind of pale.

589
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,715
Oh, no, I'm OK. I just kind of run out
of gas sometimes, that's all.

590
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,636
It really makes you think,
being in a place this old.

591
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,752
I mean, people have been
living here and loving here,

592
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,872
struggling, dying, for thousands of years.

593
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,669
And now you and I are here.

594
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,197
So, what kind of things do you like?

595
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,755
Well, I can think of one right now.

596
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,109
- Really.
- Oh, OK.

597
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,798
Erm...let me think.

598
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,478
A great melody.

599
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,398
Seeing somebody do something better
than anybody else in the whole world.

600
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,908
Ice cream. A good book.

601
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,748
What about you? What kind of things
does Sandra Dee like?

602
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,110
Er...long walks on the beach.

603
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,628
Crossword puzzles.

604
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,671
Empty studios.

605
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,716
- Elvis.
- Hey.

606
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,513
(Giggles) Just making sure
you're paying attention.

607
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,551
I'm paying attention, trust me.

608
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,715
You know, I was right about you.

609
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,876
Right about what?

610
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,269
You're gonna be easy to love.

611
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,516
# Someday, I don't know how

612
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,916
# I hope that she'll hear my plea

613
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,509
# Some way, I don't know how

614
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,678
# She'll bring her love to me...

615
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,075
May I have this dance, Miss Sandra Dee?

616
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,270
I would be honoured, Bobby Darin.

617
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,676
# That's the only thing to do

618
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,757
# Till all my lover's dreams come true

619
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,349
# Because I want a girl

620
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,836
# To call my own

621
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,030
# I want a dream lover

622
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,550
# So I don't have to dream alone...

623
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,916
Oh, you son of a bitch!

624
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,951
I felt sorry for you and you betrayed me.

625
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,797
Mary, I think you're overreacting.

626
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,912
I said you could take her out sightseeing.
For publicity.

627
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,428
- I didn't say you could marry her!
- Mother!

628
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,630
We are only engaged.

629
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,671
You, come with me!

630
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,950
# Because I want a girl...

631
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,956
(Door slams)

632
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,991
Sit!

633
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,269
You... You don't even know how
to comb your hair without me.

634
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,199
You don't know how to dress without me,
walk, talk to people without me!

635
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,119
I'm the one who brought you into this world.
I created you.

636
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,594
You'd fall apart in 15 minutes without me.

637
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,631
Oh, Mother, please.

638
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,875
When the time is right and you're ready,

639
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,151
<i>we will find a husband for you who is suitable...</i>

640
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,509
What's going on?

641
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,199
No, I love him! I love him with all my heart.

642
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,471
- Oh, he's a loser.
- No, he's smart and he's funny.

643
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,195
I wish you'd concentrated more
on Rock Hudson.

644
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,630
Rock Hudson is a very nice man,
Mother, but I'm not in love with him.

645
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,434
He still would have been a better husband
for you than Bobby Darin!

646
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,835
Why can't you let me make
a decision on my own?

647
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,519
I don't even want to talk about this any further.

648
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,551
We're leaving.

649
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,831
Him or me?

650
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,676
Fine.

651
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,712
Give her to me. Give her to me!

652
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,558
Mary! Mary! Wait, wait, wait a minute!

653
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,033
Nina, stay out of it!

654
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,036
<i>It's none of your business!</i>

655
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,310
<i>NINA: Mary! I wanna talk to you!</i>

656
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,711
(Reporters clamour)

657
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,116
You gonna plan to have any kids?

658
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,310
Show us the ring!

659
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,239
- Have you set the date yet?
- Marriage is such a big step.

660
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,033
We'll wait before rushing into anything.
Right, honey?

661
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,036
Right. Absolutely.

662
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,436
We are definitely gonna wait, gentlemen.
Absolutely.

663
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,316
OK, there.

664
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,590
- Bobby.
- OK.

665
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,038
This...is your home.

666
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,316
No...

667
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,397
I don't mind having a few friends
around every now and then,

668
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,432
and when your mother comes around,
which she finally will,

669
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,710
why, she'll be welcome too.

670
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,558
But for the moment,
I think it should be exclusively us.

671
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,797
Mr and Mrs Bobby Darin at home.

672
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,831
Sandy?

673
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,031
Hey, where'd you go?

674
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,071
Did you go in here already?

675
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,596
Sandush, where are you?

676
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,631
(Sandra sobs)

677
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,871
Hey, baby.

678
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,469
Baby, this should be
the happiest night of your life.

679
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,557
All right. Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on.

680
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,752
I can't. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.

681
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,439
- You can't what?
- I can't go through with this.

682
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,436
- Of course you can, baby.
- I can't.

683
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,789
- Yes, you can.
- You don't want to be married to me!

684
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,798
I'm staying married to you until death do us part.

685
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,434
How do you marry somebody
that you don't even know?

686
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,630
Who doesn't know who?
I don't know you or you me?

687
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,717
I don't know if I know you.
I know you don't know me.

688
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,796
<i>- I know you, you're Mrs Bobby Darin.
- No!</i>

689
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,676
It's never gonna work, Bobby.
Let's just get out of it now.

690
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,073
No way.

691
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,917
<i>- I'll make you miserable.
- OK.</i>

692
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,837
Do you not understand that?

693
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,871
I don't want to.

694
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,519
I don't want to. I can't help it.

695
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,757
(Sobs)

696
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,956
Oh, my God.

697
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,591
What?

698
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,551
I love you.

699
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,711
I really love you.

700
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,956
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

701
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,309
Wait, don't move. Don't move a muscle.

702
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,239
Oh, God, Bobby, no! Please!

703
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,999
No, honey, honey. It's OK.

704
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,589
I'm not gonna hurt you. It's... Just watch.

705
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,279
<i>My mama used to tell me a story
when I was a kid.</i>

706
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,993
That in the Middle Ages,

707
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,952
one of the knights in King Arthur's court,

708
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,120
he laid down his sword
between himself and Guinevere

709
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:18,280
<i>and he promised that he would never
cross over to the other side of the bed.</i>

710
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,791
Really?

711
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,396
I am laying down this sword between us.

712
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,194
That's my side of the bed, and that's yours.

713
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,834
<i>And I will never cross over...</i>

714
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,472
<i>...ever.</i>

715
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:46,076
<i>I don't care if we don't touch
for a thousand nights.</i>

716
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,716
<i>Only you can cross over to my side.</i>

717
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,311
Only you.

718
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,631
# Once Upon A Time

719
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,510
# How the breeze ruffled through her hair

720
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:14,873
# How we always laughed
as though tomorrow wasn't there

721
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,916
# We were young and didn't have a care

722
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,796
# Where did it go?

723
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,909
# Once upon a time

724
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,273
# The world was sweeter than we knew

725
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,199
# Everything was ours

726
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,352
# How happy we were then

727
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,868
# But somehow once upon a time

728
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:10,717
# Never comes again

729
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,433
<i>(Bobby laughs) I can't believe it!</i>

730
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,436
<i>Gimme a break.</i>

731
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,471
(Men laugh and chat)

732
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,396
You look like a dummy.

733
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,590
- (Laughter)
- That's not my fault.

734
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,632
If it's not your fault,
who's running the goddamn thing?

735
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,235
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, sweetie.

736
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,158
- Look who's on the cover.
- (Wolf whistle)

737
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,998
Oh, honey, that's great. Did you see this?

738
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,355
(Men laugh)
- "I want to be a legend."

739
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,436
<i>DICK: I can't believe you said that.</i>

740
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,789
<i>BOBBY: That's not exactly the way I said it.</i>

741
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,638
- Next time get him the cover.
- Yeah, it's a great story.

742
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,639
<i>It gets better. "Brash, cocky
and arrogant", Darin then says,</i>

743
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,877
"I hope to surpass Sinatra
in everything he does."

744
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,310
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
one time only on our stage:

745
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,635
Brash, Cocky and Arrogant.

746
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,035
We ought to use that
next time we play somewhere.

747
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,958
Boom-Boom,
where are we gonna be in five years?

748
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,356
Who knows? The Russians
may own show business in five years.

749
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,437
That's bullshit. What about next
week, next month, next year?

750
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,358
I can tell you where we're gonna be next month.

751
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,197
Don't tell me Detroit.

752
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,596
<i>You know everybody in show business
hates me because of the deals I get?</i>

753
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,757
What do you think, guys,
is that the reason they hate him?

754
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,793
While we're on the subject of what's
next, I almost forgot to tell you.

755
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,310
We're gonna need a new comedian
to open for you at the Copa.

756
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,116
What did you just say?

757
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,391
Didn't I tell you? You're playing the Copa.

758
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,596
You're friggin' kidding me?

759
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,519
- I got the call this morning, big shot.
- No, no, no!

760
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,551
We're gonna play the Copa!

761
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,556
We got the Copa!

762
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,876
Boom-Boom, you gigantic genius! Mwah!

763
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,990
Goddamned lunatic.

764
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,235
Sandush, I'm playing... Sandy!

765
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,590
Sandy, I'm playing the Copa!
We're playing the Copa.

766
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,108
My dream has come true, I'm playing the Copa!

767
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,798
That's great, sweetie.

768
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,637
What's the Copa?

769
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,793
The Copacabana's the most important nightclub
in the whole world -

770
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,354
everybody famous has played here.

771
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,278
And one day, you're gonna play here, Bobby.

772
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,630
<i>And you're gonna break
all his box office records.</i>

773
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,671
You got that?

774
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,435
(Girls scream)
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!

775
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,436
All right.

776
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,552
George Kirby is the funniest comic
working today.

777
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,672
I never said he wasn't funny.
I said he was a negro.

778
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,392
He's breaking house records.

779
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,115
If they're a big act, like Sammy Davis,
they can headline here,

780
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,233
<i>but they never- and you know that -
they never open at the Copa.</i>

781
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,352
Look, Mr Podell,
there's a first time for everything.

782
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,073
Why not let one of the great
comedians play here?

783
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,954
Because I say so. You understand? It's policy.

784
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,230
I understand but, frankly, to hell with policy.

785
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,714
This is 1960, not 1860.

786
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,309
I heard you had a mouth on you,
kid. Save it for singing.

787
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,955
Listen, Mr Podell,
I respect that this is your club, I truly do.

788
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,199
But if you don't let George Kirby open for me,
I can't be responsible for the consequences.

789
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,310
You threatening me? Hm?

790
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,195
I'm cautioning you, Mr Podell.
Have you never heard of a sit-in?

791
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,196
A sit what?

792
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,834
It's a very popular form of protest today.

793
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,678
It's where members of the black
and the white community...

794
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,871
actually, all communities,
come together to an establishment

795
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,674
<i>that they feel is being unfair
to their brothers and sisters.</i>

796
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,316
Then the media shows up,
they hold hands, and they... they sit.

797
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,476
Sometimes for days.

798
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,476
They sit?

799
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,080
<i>Yeah, they sit and erm...</i>

800
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,076
And they sing.

801
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,270
You know, songs like, what's the...?

802
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,914
Oh. We Shall Overcome.

803
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,916
Overcome?

804
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,190
Overcome what?

805
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,113
Policy, Mr Podell.

806
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,351
Outdated policy.

807
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,229
<i>Thank you so very much.</i>

808
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,751
<i>I don't know if you've noticed
what a wonderful thing television is today.</i>

809
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,237
<i>I got Hollywood, California on one channel
and, of all people, I got Louella Parsons.</i>

810
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,556
<i>I'll never forget she started
out her programme by saying,</i>

811
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,558
<i>(Mimics her) "Good evening from Hollywood."</i>

812
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,589
(Laughter)

813
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,956
(Commotion outside)

814
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,356
<i>You don't know who I am?
I'm Bobby Darin's sister!</i>

815
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,676
<i>Don't put your hands on me,
I'm going over there!</i>

816
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,359
<i>Don't tell me where I'm going.
I know where I'm going!</i>

817
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,313
<i>I'm going right over there to see Mr Darin.
I'm his sister.</i>

818
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,316
<i>You don't say anything to me!</i>

819
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,828
Nina.

820
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,836
Nina! What's going on?

821
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,269
These goons won't let me back to see you.

822
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,232
I am family.
They're treating me like some goddamn fan.

823
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,352
They have instructions not to let anybody
back this close to a show.

824
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,391
Oh, I guess I'm just anyone, then, huh?

825
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,396
No, you're... Guys, give me a moment.

826
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,795
Nina, I have to prepare to go on.

827
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,990
- Why are we sitting in the back again?
- What?

828
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,079
My table is almost in the kitchen.
Maybe I should bring you out some coffee.

829
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,430
You know the tables upfront
are for the boys I gotta take care of.

830
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,711
- Sandy's sitting right upfront.
- That's where they want her.

831
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,399
Why don't you just say it?
You are embarrassed by us.

832
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,319
- I am not, honey, but those are Podell's tables.
- Oh, that's bullshit.

833
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,316
It is not bullshit. Now go enjoy the show.

834
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,635
It's the most important night of my life.

835
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,875
I'll do my best. I won't see anything.

836
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,071
Maybe the matre'd will tell me how it went!

837
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,190
Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby Darin!

838
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,792
Thank you.

839
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,152
# Hello, young lovers, whoever you are

840
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,272
# I hope your troubles are few

841
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,118
<i># All my good wishes go with you tonight</i>

842
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,310
# I've been in love like you

843
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,437
# You be brave, young lovers,
and follow your star

844
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,199
# Brave and faithful and true

845
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,596
<i># And cling very close to each other tonight</i>

846
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,517
# I've been in love like you

847
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,677
# And I know how it feels
to have wings on your heels

848
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,280
# And to fly down the street in a trance

849
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,471
# You wing down that street
on the chance that you'll meet

850
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,715
# And you meet, not by chance

851
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,513
# Don't cry, young lovers, whatever you do

852
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,438
<i># Said don't cry because I'm alone</i>

853
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,836
# All of my memories are happy tonight

854
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,678
# I've had a love of my own, hallelujah!

855
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,190
# I've had a love of my own like yours

856
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,276
# I have had... a love...

857
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:33,279
# ...of my own!

858
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,268
Thank you and welcome to the Copacabana.
How about Richard Behrke right there?

859
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,274
<i>I'm very honoured to be here
tonight at the Copacabana.</i>

860
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,595
It's always been...

861
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,870
my dream to play this club.

862
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:05,671
<i>And er... in connection with that
I would like to er... pay tribute to...</i>

863
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,359
to two women in my life.

864
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,951
My er...mother Polly...
always dreamed and believed

865
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,118
that one day I would play the Copacabana.

866
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:21,312
- And so tonight this is for her, for my mother.
(Applause)

867
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,954
And the other woman, who is here tonight,

868
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,754
<i>is, of course, my lovely new wife Sandra Dee,</i>

869
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,872
<i>the woman you are all looking at
when I'm trying to work.</i>

870
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,911
(Applause)

871
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,956
<i>Ah, would you look at that? She's blushing.</i>

872
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,309
Thank you for making her feel
so welcome tonight,

873
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,794
and for that I wanna do a special number for her.

874
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,832
- I wanna dedicate this song to...
- Come on.

875
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,189
I love you, Sandush.

876
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,390
# That's All

877
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,477
# I can only give you love that lasts for ever

878
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,318
# And the promise to be near each time you call

879
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,397
# And the only heart I own,
for you and you alone

880
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,113
# That's all, that's all

881
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,357
# I can only give you country walks in springtime

882
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,710
# And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall

883
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,513
# And a love whose burning light
will warm the winter night

884
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,949
# That's all, that's all

885
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,792
# There are those, I am sure, who have told you

886
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,832
# They would give you the world for a toy

887
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,553
# All I have are these arms to enfold you

888
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,876
# And a love time can never destroy

889
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,388
# If you're wondering
what I'm asking in return, dear

890
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,152
# You'll be glad to know
that my demands are small

891
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,158
# Say it's me that you'll adore
for now and evermore

892
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,270
# That's all, that's all

# Say it's me that you'll adore

901
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,271
# Yeah, it's me that you'll adore

902
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,391
# For now and evermore

# That's all

904
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,389
<i>In those long ago years, it seemed as if
Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee,</i>

905
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,352
<i>were the most talked about couple
on the planet.</i>

906
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,710
<i>After the birth of Dodd Mitchell
Cassotto on December 16th,</i>

907
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,228
<i>they both stayed in Los Angeles
to make movies:</i>

908
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,271
<i>Sandra, in another Tammy picture,</i>

909
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,914
and Bobby in a supporting role
in Captain Newman, MD.

910
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,712
- Shh!
- Quiet.

911
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,637
I'm sorry.

912
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,791
OK. Quiet on the set!

913
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,990
And rolling.

914
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,439
Speed.

915
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,991
And...action, Bobby.

916
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,713
OK, Big Jim, you go on,

917
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,639
you get this two-bit corn-feeder off the ground,
huh?

918
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,636
Hey, Buck! Buck?

919
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,797
We ought to get a couple
of broads when we get home.

920
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,400
Ones with real builds on them that won't quit.

921
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,398
I'm talking about some real balloon smugglers.

922
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,919
Jesus, what was that?

923
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,757
<i>We got hit.</i>

924
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,119
<i>Buck, Buck, we're going down.
Oh, Jesus, we're gonna crash!</i>

925
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,435
I gotta get out, I gotta use the escape hatch.

926
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:45,350
<i>Oh, come on! Oh, no!
He doesn't have a head. Oh, no!</i>

927
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,313
<i>God, please, can't you fix him
the way he was before?</i>

928
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,148
<i>- Oh, God, no.
- And cut. Fantastic.</i>

929
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,471
Bobby, you were wonderful.

930
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,151
Oh, my baby.

931
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,509
Bobby. Thanks, that was incredible.

932
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,632
- It's the best part I've ever had.
- Told you it was a great script.

933
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,195
But how can you go wrong with
Gregory Peck and Tony Curtis?

934
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,754
Don't forget Angie. Thanks, Angie.
See you soon.

935
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,268
- So, what's next?
- Boom-Boom, what's next?

936
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,880
We open in Tahoe for three nights on the 20th,

937
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,115
then we got Philly, Chicago and Miami Beach.

938
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,196
<i>- Thank you. Good luck.
- Thank you so much.</i>

939
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,435
- What's he talking about?
- The tour, baby.

940
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,516
<i>Honey, I'm not done filming my movie yet.</i>

941
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,516
OK, you can join me when you're done.

942
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,632
- I'm not bringing the baby on the road.
- Leave him with the nanny.

943
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,830
I don't want Dodd to be raised by the nanny.

944
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,235
He's not gonna be raised by the nanny.

945
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,590
What'll I do on the road?
Who am I gonna sing to if you're not there?

946
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,596
Back to my set.

947
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,631
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

948
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,238
- You look mad.
- I'm not mad.

949
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,874
The sooner I finish filming,
the sooner I can join you.

950
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,270
Did you know your toupee was on
a little crooked?

951
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,276
- What?
- Yeah.

952
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,552
Are you kidding? How many times
have I told you to watch my hair?

953
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,831
Great timing, Steve.
It'd be nice to have him home for a while.

954
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,758
It's a wonder Dodd even knows
what he looks like.

955
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,112
Great having them both at the same studio,
isn't it?

956
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,788
# There are so many
fabulous faraway places to see

957
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:23,077
<i># Such as Mexico, Sweden,
Hawaii, Japan and Capri</i>

958
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,112
# There's so many exciting
and wonderful places

959
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,596
<i># Mountains and jungles and desert oases</i>

960
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,359
# Pleasant as home is, it isn't what Rome is

961
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,675
# So why stay there?

962
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,157
# When there are so many
fabulous faraway places to see

963
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,878
<i># Why should Spain and Tahiti and Rio</i>

964

# Just be only names to you and me

965
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,676
# I feel certain there's people
we'd be glad to know there

966
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,837
# So tell me why don't we
get up and just go there

967
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,475
# Go to those fabulous places
where we long to be

968
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,872
# Like Bangkok and Hong Kong
and Paris and Venice

969
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,037
# Tokyo and Cairo and Lisbon and London

970

<i># Siam, Siena, Vienna, Verona</i>

971

<i># Java, Jamaica, Bombay, Barcelona</i>

972
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:18,318
# Show me those fabulous places

973
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:23,798
# We're longing to see

974
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,031
(Cheering and applause)

975
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:46,109
So this is your suite, Bobby and Mrs Darin.

976
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,837
Bar, fire pit. The bathroom's over there.

977
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,189
- And the living room's this way, sir.
- Thank you.

978
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,674
- I'll just put your luggage in.
- Great, thank you.

979
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,836
Look at this, baby.

980
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,996
Gonna be a hot night in Vegas.

981
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,711
- Anything else I can do for you?
- No, that's all. Thank you.

982
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,116
- Would you like to have some ice?
- No, I'm great. There you go.

983
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,116
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Germany.

984
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,116
That's a terrific city. Thank you.

985
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,550
- I'm a big fan, Mr Darin.
- That's very kind. Good night.

986
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,316
<i>Sandush...</i>

987
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,989
Don't you think you're drinking
a little bit too much lately?

988
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,713
No, actually I don't think
I've had enough to drink.

989
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,558
OK, what's the problem?

990
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,716
I just want us to be together.

991
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,230
<i>- We are together, baby, look.
- I mean some kind of normal schedule.</i>

992
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,748
We have a baby,
and if I don't see you up on stage,

993
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,758
- I don't see you at all.
- Well, you're here, too.

994
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:52,031
Recording or performing or filming
or making appearances.

995
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,959
- Why can't we just stay home?
- Honey, performing is my life.

996
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,878
- Well, what about me?
- You're here, aren't you?

997
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,957
- Yeah, with all of them.
- They're a part of my life.

998
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,958
Just like Mary is a part of
your life and now a part of ours.

999
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,673
They are our family. All of them, like it or not.

1000
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,915
I can't just stop working to tour with you.

1001
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,030
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

1002
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,230
- You can.
- No. I'm an actress.

1003
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,236
Making movies is what I do.

1004
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,510
Kissing Troy Donahue's not acting.

1005
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:23,155
- Oh, yeah? Then you try it.
- I'd rather not.

1006
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,714
Hey, what a face.

1007
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,876
- You should lock the door.
- Why?

1008
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,388
- Before someone comes in.
- Nobody's coming in.

1009
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,908
Yesterday, Charlie walked in on me
taking a shower.

1010
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,155
<i>You're kidding? What did he want?</i>

1011
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,794
He asked me if I wanted
a corned beef sandwich.

1012
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,197
- Do you?
- (Giggles) Ooh, honey.

1013
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,353
It's OK. It's just us.

1014
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,151
Bobby! Whoa, sorry.
But I was right about the war picture.

1015
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,670
Get your speech ready cos after the tour,
you're going to the Oscars, pal.

1016
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:19,555
- You just got nominated.
- Hallelujah! Yes! Yes!

1017
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,033
Oh, Christ.

1018
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,755
<i>And the nominees are,
Nick Adams in Twilight Of Honour.</i>

1019
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,429
<i>Bobby Darin in Captain Newman, MD.</i>

1020
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,791
<i>Melvyn Douglas in Hud.</i>

1021
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,113
<i>- Hugh Griffith in Tom Jones.
- Hello!</i>

1022
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,151
<i>And John Huston in The Cardinal.</i>

1023
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,311
<i>And the winner is...</i>

1024
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,475
<i>Melvyn Douglas? Melvyn Douglas?</i>

1025
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,432
My blood is up there on the screen
and they give it to him!

1026
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,869
Unzip me, please.

1027
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,115
"You don't care about people, Hud.

1028
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,310
You don't give a damn about 'em."

1029
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,796
<i>I heard he was dying or something.</i>

1030
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,513
- It's a sympathy vote.
- He's dying? I'm the one dying!

1031
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:15,233
Way before he was dying, I was dying.
Where's my sympathy?

1032
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,874
You're doing fine feeling sorry for yourself
all alone.

1033
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,595
"Stick your finger up my ass, Alma,
and wiggle it, just like the doctor does."

1034
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,950
It's an honour just to be nominated.
I've never been nominated.

1035
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,833
All your Hollywood friends
probably voted against me.

1036
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,678
- I voted for you, Bobby.
- It's BD. What time's the car?

1037
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,995
All right, see you then.
All the slaps and smiles,

1038
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,598
and I'm a goddamn joke out there.

1039
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,710
Not as big of a joke as you are right now.

1040
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,389
Warren Beatty is there with Leslie Caron,
nominated for Best Actress,

1041
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,112
and I'm there with Gidget.

1042
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,310
Leslie Caron is not box office!

1043
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,591
- Those people don't care about that.
- It's all they give a shit about.

1044
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,359
Only people from the Bronx
actually care about the Oscars.

1045
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,836
Melvyn Douglas is married to a
congresswoman, I'm married to Tammy.

1046
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,111
It took Melvyn Douglas 40 years
to get a Supporting Actor's face.

1047
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,151
You should be happy you did it in just two.

1048
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,598
You know what?
Maybe I'll just go back out on tour.

1049
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,996
Oh, that's just great, Bobby.
That's just fucking great!

1050
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,395
Like usual, you leave Dodd and me behind.

1051
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,396
When you're on the boards, it's real.

1052
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,670
The audience is right there, you can feel 'em.

1053
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:19,998
- Maybe movie audiences are too sober for you.
- It's reality, the nightclubs are reality.

1054
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,679
It's not like the frickin' movies that are all fake!

1055
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,918
I just have one thing to say to you,
Mr Reality, Mr King of Reality -

1056
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,996
your toupee's on crooked!

1057
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:32,430
You're always trying to undermine me
every time I go on stage like that!

1058
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,155
Telling me I've got a pimple on my nose.
I'm goddamn sick of it!

1059
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,668
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

1060
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,712
No, you don't. Oh, no, you don't!

1061
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,355
You don't leave me! I leave you!

1062
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,756
The cars and the clothes
and the hair and the premiere.

1063
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,916
It's bullshit. I'm sick of all of it.

1064
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,916
I'm telling you I'm out of here.

1065
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,679
You stay here cos you gotta take care of Dodd.

1066
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,756
The nanny's here. He's fine!

1067
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,152
You had a chance to be happy
and you messed it up!

1068
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,156
Well, you...

1069
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,316

to find somebody who'll love you?</i>

1072
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:21,590
A big-nosed, self-centred, mean, nasty,
balding, little shithead with a bad heart?

1073
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,798
Well, you go for it, honey, cos I am through!

1074

# Charade

1075
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,320

1076
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,511
# I turned and you were gone

1077
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:38,030
# While from the darkened wings

1078
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:41,959
# The music box played on and on

1079

# Charade!

1084
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,271
My baby.

1085
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,870
Maybe you're right.

1086
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:34,674
Maybe you're right about all
these people being around us all the time.

1087
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,995
Maybe it should just be us.

1088

# Whatever you've done, it's all over

1089

1090

# Yesterday's long gone for ever

1091
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,750
That's good, Moose, cos I left it somewhere!

1092

# Damned if what you're feeling isn't change...

1093

<i>So I did stay home for a while.</i>

1094
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,480
<i>The 1960s rushed by like a locomotive,</i>

1095
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,954
<i>while Dodd grew up like a moose.</i>

1096
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,798
<i>Sandy and I did a couple of movies together
but they were dogs.</i>

1097
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:15,389
<i>The music scene was changing
as dramatically as the country.</i>

1098
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:19,115
<i>Nightclubs were out
and big venues like stadiums were in.</i>

1099
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:23,358
<i>I was suddenly irrelevant,
my stage literally disappearing.</i>

1100
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,915
<i>I tried to write new music
and got involved in politics</i>

1101
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,349
<i>because we were now a country at war.</i>

1102
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,710
<i>But the fact was, I was a balding chart singer</i>

1103
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:36,639
<i>who hadn't had a hit in years,
and who should be dead.</i>

1104
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,636
<i>INTERVIEWER: So why Kennedy?</i>

1105
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,956
Like most people in this country,
I'm fed up with all the insanity.

1106
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,468
The assassination of our president,
Vietnam, riots.

1107
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,193
<i>I'm looking for salvation from all the madness,</i>

1108
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,879
and then along comes
another guy named Bobby.

1109
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,072
<i>Now, here is a no-bullshit guy
who is committed, passionate,</i>

1110
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:57,590
who really cares -
I've completely dedicated myself to this man.

1111
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,870
<i>I think he may be this country's last hope.</i>

1112
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,869
Go out and vote.

1113

might heal the country,</i>

1114
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,635
<i>Sandy and I drifted farther and farther apart.</i>

1115
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,951
Bobby, why do you sing
the same songs every night?

1116
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,758
Isn't it boring?

1117
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,313
Well, honey, it's an act.

1118
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,193
Do you expect me to sing
different songs every night?

1119
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,276
Why not? I don't make the same movies.

1120
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,437
Well, actually, you do. Sweet, little, innocent...

1121
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,595
Excuse me!

1122
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,633
But I think I know what people want
in the movies nowadays, OK?

1123
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,399
<i>You may be the expert in... in music,</i>

1124
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:37,355
<i>but I... I have had
years of movie experience!</i>

1125
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,356
<i>Not bad, Sand.</i>

1126
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,392
Would've been even better
without the slur in your voice.

1127
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,998
<i>My sister came out to stay with us,</i>

1128
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:51,635
<i>but her real reason for coming
I couldn't have possibly imagined.</i>

1129
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:56,515
Listen, Bobby, there's a reason
I felt I had to come and stay with you.

1130
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,516
Yeah, what?

1131
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:03,235
I heard you were going into politics.
You still thinkin' about doing that?

1132
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,192
Well, I'm considering it.
I mean, they've asked me.

1133
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,800
You know how the papers try and smear people

1134
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,276
with things from their past
when they're gonna run for office?

1135
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,550
Mm-hm. Yeah. So what?

1136
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:19,833
There's something about your past
that I think it's finally time for you to know.

1137
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,871
What are you talking about?

1138
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,392
It's about Polly.

1139
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,960
She wasn't who you thought she was, Bobby.

1140
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,468
She was the best mother
in the whole goddamn world.

1141
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,239
She was, because she was
my mother, so I know it's true.

1142
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,034
<i>- Then take that back!
- She was a wonderful person and mother.</i>

1143
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:40,789
But what I think you really need now
is the truth.

1144
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,876
The truth about your mother.

1145
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,231
And the truth is...

1146
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,317
Polly was not your mother.

1147
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,351
Sam was not your father.

1148
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,751
You ain't my brother, Bobby.

1149
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:07,159
We swore we would never let you find out.

1150
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,955
<i>Polly was my mother.</i>

1151
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,751
<i>Not yours.</i>

1152
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,472
<i>She was your grandmother.</i>

1153
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,999
<i>Sweetheart...</i>

1154
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,317
I'm not your sister.

1155
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,630
Bobby, I'm your mother.

1156
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,958
We made a pact that we would never tell you.

1157
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,472
Is she kidding?

1158
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,717
She got pregnant when she was 17.

1159
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,799
It's true. I didn't want you to be a bastard,
so I gave you to mama,

1160
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,876
so that way no-one could call you one.

1161
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,751
She couldn't give you up for adoption.

1162
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,429
When I went off to the hospital
when it was time for you to be born,

1163
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,109
Mama moved us to the Bronx
where we didn't know nobody.

1164
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:12,110
And then when I came back,
we said you were her baby, not mine.

1165
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:14,116
But that way, I could keep you.

1166
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,720
Do you realise what you're saying to me?

1167
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,716
We did it to protect you, Bobby.

1168
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,150
You need me now. I can really be here for you.

1169
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,236
You're lost.

1170
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:28,558
You can finally have the mother
that you never really had.

01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,832
Look, Bobby, I know...

1222
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,792
I know I ain't no college boy,

1223
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:14,799
<i>but I always kinda felt like I was your father.</i>

1224
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:18,276
Charlie, you've been more than a father to me,
you know that.

1225
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,276
I just wish I knew.

1226
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:24,393
Stay out here much longer and Dodd's
gonna be saying the same thing about you.

1227
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,511
You may not know who your father is,

1228
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:32,597
but you got two mothers out of the deal.

1229
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:36,997
<i>Both are of them are great.
Have you thought how hard it's been for her?</i>

1230
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,953
Not to be able to tell anybody
that you're her son?

1231
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,629
You wanna find yourself, get back on the stage.

1232
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:47,911
- You are Bobby Darin.
- That's who I thought I was.

1233
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:52,476
OK, OK, then you're Walden Robert Cassotto.

1234
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,990
No, I'm not, Charlie. I'm not even him.

1235
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,157
Well, maybe you're both.

1236
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,960
<i>OK, Boom-Boom, let's go. We got a show to do!</i>

1237
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,956
Come on! Get it on!

1238
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,879
(In falsetto) # Woo-oo-ah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1239
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:19,471
# Ah-ah ah-ah hah,
I'll let them know, yeah!

1240
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:23,399
# I got no mama, got no papa,
just got myself

1241
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,830
# That's what I got, hoo!

1242
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,316
# Come and sing the simple song of freedom

1243
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,316
(Audience laugh and chat)

1244
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,716
# Sing it like you've never sung before...

1245
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,149
Sing Dream Lover!

1246
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:43,274
# Let it fill the air, tell the people everywhere

1247
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,994
# We the people here don't want a war

1248
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,748
# Seven hundred million, are you listening?

1249
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:59,119
<i># Most of what you read is made of lies...</i>

1250
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,151
Sing Splish Splash!

1251
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,918
<i># But speaking one-to-one...</i>

1252
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,951
What is this, hm?

1253
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,797
Is it a joke?

1254
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,194
<i>STEVE: Bobby, you're turning into a total hippie!</i>

1255
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,356
I don't have much time left. I'm a dying man.

1256
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,834
Stop that.
I'm not gonna listen to that shit from you.

1257
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,792
- It's not shit! It's the truth!
- We're all dying.

1258
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,796
That's not what I'm talking about!

1259
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,549
- Every day I live is a miracle!
- I know. You weren't supposed to reach 16.

1260
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,353
- Don't you make fun of me, Steve!
- I'm not making fun of you!

1261
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,871
<i>How am I supposed to react when you tell me
the same thing for the 2,000th time?</i>

1262
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:35,150
<i>They booed me off the goddamn stage</i>

1263
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,998
like I'd swindled them
out of their last 15 friggin' bucks!

1264
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,919
They wanted to hear Dream Lover!
They're not ready for the new you!

1265
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,554
They either take me as I am,
or I don't want them!

1266
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,478
<i>Bobby, in seven years you've made ten films,</i>

1267
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,035
won two Grammies, had seven Top 10 singles,

1268
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,753
<i>got nominated for an Academy Award...</i>

1269
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,189
What the hell more do you want?

1270
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,708
I just gotta find myself, that's all.

1271
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,872
Everybody else seems to know who you are.

1272
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,354
But you keep looking.

1273
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,151
When you find yourself, give me a call.

1274
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,236
Then we'll see where we are.

1275
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,551
Steve...

1276
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,514
You don't really think I'm crazy?

1277
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,708
My watch is slowing down.

1278
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,271
Better get this fixed.

1279
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,351
<i>What does "your time's up" mean?</i>

1280
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,789
What are you talking about?

1281
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:52,833
My friend Gregory said that my time's up.

1282
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,589
Your time's up! Bullshit. Here.

1283
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,677
You wear that when you get older. Hm?

1284
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,669
I'm gonna get older?

1285
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,676
Well, sure, you are.

1286
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:11,998
But you gotta believe it.
You always gotta believe it, Bobby.

1287
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:15,874
<i>As long as you really believe it, it's true.</i>

1288
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,111
(Ticking)

1289
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,116
Hey.

1290
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,151
You're back.

1291
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,631
How do you feel?

1292
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:47,478
Like somebody's had their hands in my chest.

1293
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,511
Yeah. They said it went well.

1294
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,869
They replaced both valves.

1295
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,231
It won't last, Charlie.

1296
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,798
Ah, that's just the medication talking.

1297
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,195
<i>- You need to eat.
- I need to eat?</i>

1298
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,231
Yeah.

1299
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,476
You can't have this yet,

1300
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,353
but I want you to have something
to look forward to.

1301
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,356
- Well, what is it?
- Manicotti.

1302
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,755
We got good manicotti.

1303
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,351
And Nina sent her spaghetti
all the way from New York.

1304
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:25,678
Nina's spaghetti?
What are you trying to do, kill me, Charlie?

1305
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,995
She misses you, Bobby.

1306
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:35,632
I'll just call her and Sandy
and tell everybody that you're OK. OK?

1307
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,276
Nine hours on the operating table,
and he keeps on ticking!

1308
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,515
Oh, yeah. I just have one thing to say.

1309
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,677
I bet old Dr Andretti, old dead Dr Andretti,

1310
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:55,429
would sure be surprised
to see I made it to my 36th birthday!

1311
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,476
Don't steal that! It's not yours!

1312
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,030
Ha-Happy birthday.

1313
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:14,311
Thank you, Nina. You look great.
That's a nice outfit.

1314
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,318
You like it?
Cos I got it special for your birthday.

1315
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:21,638
I wanted you to know that your mother
can be a classy lady.

1316
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,398
What, Bobby?

1317
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,112
What, Bobby?

1318
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,640
It's OK, Nina. I think I know why you told me.

1319
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,557
<i>Excuse me for a minute.</i>

1320
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,356
- Hi.
- Don't he look great?

1321
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,470
- Don't he look great?
- He looks great.

1322
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,637
He looks like a million bucks.
He's gonna live to be 100.

1323
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,752
Hey. I've been looking for you all day.

1324
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,076
- No, you haven't, you liar.
- I have. I have.

1325
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,157
- You look so good.
- Oh, I feel good.

1326
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,156
I feel great, physically.

1327
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:59,399
In so much as I can actually breathe easy
for the first time since I can remember.

1328
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,751
<i>Dodd misses you being home.</i>

1329
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,991
I miss you.

1330
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,716
I'm proud of you, baby.

1331
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,479
- I'm really trying, Bobby.
- I know you are.

1332
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,432
That's not why you left. There's more than that.

1333
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:22,718
I'm not what you want me to be.
I'm not an intellectual, I'm not as smart as you.

1334
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,876
You're smart enough for ten of me.

1335
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,078
And look what we did together.

1336
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,559
- You gonna sing again?
- Oh, I'd love to.

1337
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:38,718
I'm just not sure I can get used to the idea
of booing as a nightly ritual.

1338
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,752
Oh, you can't blame them.
They don't understand.

1339
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,518
You were always ahead of your time.

1340
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,757
They're so shallow.
People hear what they see, anyway.

1341
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,914
Yeah. I know, the...

1342
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,991
- What did you just say?
- That you can't blame them...

1343
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:59,555
No, no, no. About people hearing what?

1344
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,556
<i>Boom-Boom! Boom-Boom! Boom-Boom!</i>

1345
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,068
Boom-Boom, Boom-Boom, Boom-Boom.

1346
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,311
Book me back in Vegas.

1347
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,196
You don't wanna go back to Vegas.

1348
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:15,994
Oh, yes, I do. I wanna go back to Vegas,
and I wanna go back on stage.

1349
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,190
<i>Don't tell me you found yourself.</i>

1350
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,834
- He's going back to Vegas?
- First I've heard.

1351
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,110
I'm a nightclub animal, Boom-Boom,
and I love it.

1352
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:25,958
Frankly, I think I do it better
than anybody else in the world.

1353
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,549
You're also modest,
but I don't want you going back there.

1354
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,556
<i>It's gonna work this time.</i>

1355
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,717
I can be what I want,
I can say what I want, I can sing what I want.

1356
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:37,991
Sandy just said it. She just said it beautifully.

1357
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:38,950
What?

1358
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,877
People hear what they see.

1359
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:59,032
It's funny. You weren't a girl
a guy like me was supposed to get.

1360
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,389
I mean, there I was, a singer from the Bronx,

1361
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,159
and there you were, a movie star.

1362
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,109
Bobby, what's gonna happen to me?

1363
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:21,070
No matter what happens, baby,
you'll always be Sandra Dee.

1364
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:48,996
- Why can't I open it?
- Because it's not like the gifts you're used to.

1365
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:53,238
This one is very, very special
and nobody can know you have it.

1366
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,236
What's in it?

1367
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:59,671
$2 million hard cash,
but unfortunately it's Confederate money, so...

1368
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,995
- Dad!
- No.

1369
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,679
It's just some things I want you to have.

1370
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:07,393
So nobody can know I have it? Not even Mom?

1371
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:10,671
Not Mom, not Charlie,
not Aunt Nina, or Grandma.

1372
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:13,154
Nobody but you and me. It's a secret.

1373
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,555
When can I open it?

1374
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:19,951
When I'm gone.

1375
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,036
I don't want you to die, Dad.

1376
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:27,390
Well, you know, Moose,
I'm no different than anybody else.

1377
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,432
My time might just come a little sooner,
that's all.

1378
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:33,199
- What about me?
- What about you?

1379
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,231
You're gonna be just fine...

1380
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,833
...if you're the man I think you are.

1381
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:43,874
You know, I had to fight my way out of the Bronx
to make something of myself.

1382
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,311
But not nearly as hard as you're gonna
have to fight to get out of Beverly Hills.

1383
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,713
How you doing in there?

1384
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:09,314
<i>- Trying to find a heartbeat.
- That's not funny.</i>

1385
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,557
<i>- Are my tux and toupee laid out?
- Yeah.</i>

1386
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,672
You got nothing to worry about.

1387
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,236
You don't look so good.

1388
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:23,591
To tell you the truth, Charlie, I don't feel so hot.

1389
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:27,428
I gotta go under the knife again,
that's why we're taking off early.

1390
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:30,119
I got blood poisoning. It's catching up.

1391
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:33,789
Look, we don't have to do this.
We can call it off.

1392
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,559
Charlie, I gotta get ready now.

1393
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:42,638
I gotta go make sure Nina's at a good table.

1394
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,958
Charlie, I wouldn't have gone this far
without you.

1395
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,595
Kid, you were a runaway train.

1396
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:55,313
- Just get through tonight.
- Yeah.

1397
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,590
Always leave 'em wanting more, Charlie.

1398

I'm gonna take a little break.

1460
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:05,833
And as a result, I may not get a chance
to publicly do something

1461
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:09,509
that I've wanted to do for a very long time.

the woman who raised me.

My mother, Nina Cassotto Maffia.

<i>Please, take a bow, Ma. Take a bow.</i>

<i>(Piano starts up)
- Its lyrics have been changed.</i>

01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:00,040
<i>It was an old Bob Hope number, actually.</i>

1470
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:04,517
But we'd like to do it for you tonight
as our way of closing and saying good night...

1471
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:09,315
as soon as Richie's finished
with that thing he's composing over there.

1472
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,193

# The Curtain Falls

# That's all there is, there isn't any more

<i># They've torn down these dusty walls</i>

<i># If I had this to do again</i>

1490
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:13,952
<i># And the evening were new again</i>

1491
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:22,156
<i># I would spend it with you again</i>

1492

# ...down these dusty walls

01:40:55,040 --> 01:41:01,036
# People say I was made for this

# Nothing else would I trade for this

1499
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:16,916
# And just think - I get paid for this!

1500
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:27,755
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Where you going?

1501
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:29,756
No, that's it, kid.

1502
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:33,429
You can't go. That's not the end.
Let me tell you how it goes.

1503
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:37,631
The man we thought was our father
turned out to be our grandfather.

1504
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,990
The guy we thought was our brother-in-law
is really our stepfather.

1505
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:44,112
The woman we thought was our sister
turned out to be our mother.

1506
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:47,675
Because she slept with half the Bronx,
God knows who our father was.

1507
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,995
Right. So, now we know it. Now we're done.

1508
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,349
No, not you. I'm the one who goes.

1509
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,149
Don't you get it? Bobby Darin doesn't die.

1510
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,998
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Don't you remember?</i>

1511
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:02,999
Memories are like moonbeams.
We do with them what we want.

1512
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,996
Just listen.

1513
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,918
Listen, OK? It's not the way it goes.

1514
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:11,517
# As long as you're singing

1515
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:15,473
# Then the world's all right
and everything's swinging

1516
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:20,799
# Long as you're singing your song

1517
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:23,957
# As long as you're singing

1518
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,471
# There's a bell up in your brain that's ringing

1519
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:33,071
# Making a crazy ding-dong

1520
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:37,477
# And if this band don't desert us

1521
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:41,115
