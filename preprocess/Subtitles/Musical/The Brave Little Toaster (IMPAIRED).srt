00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,671
Good morning,

00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,839
That was
"A-Billion-and-One Strings,"

00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,974

your favorite tunes.

4
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,143
At the top of the news
this morning...

5
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,551
there's monkey
business in Utah.

6
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,715
A band of renegade
chimpanzees...

7
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,554
have kidnapped Pulitzer prize-winning
poet Lester Charles.

8
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:44,119
What's the big idea?
I'm attempting to sleep!!

Do you mind?

10
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,400
Whoa,
not in the face!

11
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,166
Uh, the chimps
are protesting...

12
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,402
I've got a mind to reset
your alarm... permanently!

13
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,774
Sorry, folks.

14
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,006
We're experiencing
technical difficulty...

15
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,310
but it's nothing
we can't handle!!

16
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,374
This just in.

17
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,045
Domestic violence erupts
in peaceful cottage!

Can't hear your own thoughts
with all the racket.

21
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,430
Holy mother of Edison!
What were you thinking?

22
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,561
You might have
broken my bulb!

23
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:28,733
I'm thinking you think too much.
We need wake-up music.

24
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,675
So when it's raining

25
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,076
Have no regrets

26
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,741
Because it isn't raining
rain you know

27
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,875
It's raining violets

28
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,762
Blah!

29
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,169
Va-rooooom!

30
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,516
I'll track you to
the end of this carpet.

31
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,492
Come here.
I'm going to get you.

32
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,086
Wait till I fix
your speaker!!

33
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,394
Rusetti picks it up
and throws.

34
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,027

Come here.

42
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,619
You dare to cross foils...

43
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,092
with the greatest Saxon
swordsman in the land?

44
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,959

Have you any inkling who you're dealing with?

45
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,659

Precisely. A total idiot.

If your saber wags as loosely as your tongue...

- A blow for Mario, the garbage man.
- Ouch!

52
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,714
And for the boys
at the delicatessen.

53
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,688
And here's one for
the guys on 5th Street.

54
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,690
No!

55

Whoa! Ugh!

What's going on?
Who turned out the lights?

57
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,836
Good morning.

58
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,998
Good morning,

Umph!

00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,974
- Thanks.
- What's on our lineup today?

62
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,044
What are our
instructions?

63
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,181
What are we
gonna do today?

64
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,657
The same thing we've done
for the last 2,000 days.

65
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,160
Chores!

66
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,492
- Chores?
- It'll be fun.

I'm always
up for fun!

68
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,963
Listen, a broadcast
from Ebbets Field!

69
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,265
It's the top
of the ninth...

70
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,965
I don't understand
how chores could be fun.

71
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,476
Not supposed to be fun.
It's work!

72
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,535
I don't like to work
without the Master.

73
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,547
Well, okay.

74
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,413
If you don't want to work,
why don't we play a game?

75
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,545
- What sort of game?
- What are the rules?

76
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,555
There's only one rule.

77
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,921
You can't stop till
the house is clean.

Absolutely nothing,

Hey.

You guys have an attachment
for that kid, don't you?

Yes, he was

That's real nice.

Any day he might
come romping back...

just come whistling
back through that door...

So what?
He has a family.

He's not coming back,

Oh, boy,

Life is like a journey

356
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:07,201
On the road that's within

00:24:07,277 --> 00:24:09,370
Head says you should stay

358
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:11,471
But your heart says to begin

359
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:14,016
So you go

360
00:24:14,084 --> 00:24:16,882
But you don't
want to go

362

Isn't life just
filled with ease

363
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:24,560
You just stay forgiving

364
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:26,619
Through the forests
and the trees

365
00:24:26,697 --> 00:24:29,165
And you'll go

366

Just where you want to go

367
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:39,542
Time flies by
in the city of light

368
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:43,444
Time stands still
in the country

369
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:47,678
There's no time
for a fuss and a fight

As we travel the land

And I'd
be satisfied

The city of light

Light shines like a diamond
in the city at night

When that
diamond shines

You know that
everything's all right

Let us meet the Master

We don't want
to make him wait

You just keep a-knocking
he will open up the gate

384

To that city of light

Master is a man
with a plan I can understand

386

Master is a man
of great reflection

387
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:53,339
Master is a man who lays
his hand across the land

388
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:56,716
Master is a man
of our affection

and who knows
what else!

to come this way?

the bases are loaded...

and Pee Wee Reese
is at the plate.

There's the pitch.
He connects.

Oh, and it's a triple play.

What's the matter?

00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:27,640
Eaten alive, the poor sap.

00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,321
Wow, wow!

495
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:35,717
I thought you
were a goner.

You wish.

497
00:36:37,794 --> 00:36:41,423
We are gonna need
some kind of shelter.

498
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:43,830
Shelter from the

Come here and say that,

- What?
- Oh, sorry.

501
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:51,063
I meant to say
"vacuous vacuum."

Ladies and gentlemen,
let's get ready to rumble.

And there's the bell.

Good night, America,

Thanks.

That's all right.

514
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:04,308
So, what's this thing
with you and the blanket?

515
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:06,076
What thing?

516
00:38:06,149 --> 00:38:10,313
All of a sudden you're
being so darn nice to him.

517
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:13,823
I was just thinking,
and I got this feeling...

518
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,155
that I should be nicer
to him for a change.

519
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:19,218
And now
I feel better.

520
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:21,958
- That's weird.
- What's weird about it?

521
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:25,593
You were never
this nice to him before...

522
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:28,695
and now you're nice
to him all the time.

523
00:38:28,772 --> 00:38:30,706
I don't know.

524
00:38:30,774 --> 00:38:34,232
I'm just trying to understand,
figure out what it means.

525
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,609
It's kinda
hard to describe.

526
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,117
It's like being next
to a new loaf of bread.

527
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,283
Hmm, let's see.

528
00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:50,849
It's like a warm,
toasty feeling inside.

529
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:53,452
Like a glow.

530
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,760
- A glow?
- Yeah.

531
00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:59,268
I think I know what
you're talking about.

532
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:03,932
It's like the feeling I get
when I think about the Master.

533
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:05,941
That's it.

534
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:09,467
I remember the first time
my bulb burned out.

535
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:14,915
I thought,
"That's it.

536
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,112
"It's over.
I'm burned out.

Eighty-sixed.
To the showers!!"

538
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:24,626
But then the Master
put in a brand-new bulb.

539
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:29,893
And I just glowed.

540
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:33,192
That's all
there is to it.

541

01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:35,857
More, more, more

977
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:37,864
Any time
or place you wish

978
01:10:37,932 --> 01:10:39,866
You might meet up
with some dish

979
01:10:39,934 --> 01:10:43,301
Pull yourself together
on the edge

980
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:46,897
If you want a lean machine
to whip up some mean cuisine

981
01:10:46,974 --> 01:10:50,000
I'm on the scene
totally automatic

982
01:10:50,077 --> 01:10:52,068
I can bake your
biscuits too

983
01:10:52,146 --> 01:10:54,080
Pop some dough boy
out for you

984
01:10:54,148 --> 01:10:57,743
I'm micro solid-state
and that's no static

985
01:10:57,818 --> 01:11:01,754
More, more, more

986
01:11:01,822 --> 01:11:04,882
Everything you wanted
and more

987
01:11:07,695 --> 01:11:10,687
More, more, more

988
01:11:10,765 --> 01:11:12,733
We're the bytes
and chips to call

989
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,859
You just have
yourself a ball

990
01:11:14,935 --> 01:11:17,369
It's all hyperactive
on the edge

991
01:11:17,438 --> 01:11:20,930
From LEDs to CRTs, woofers
tweeters, antenna trees

992
01:11:21,008 --> 01:11:23,033
An ultra-nylon
life of ease

993
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:26,136
Everything you dreamed of
on the edge

994
01:11:26,213 --> 01:11:29,444
- And more!
- And more!

995
01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:36,952
Where's the toaster?

996
01:11:40,728 --> 01:11:43,356
Where's the vacuum?

997
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:44,692
Whoa!

998
01:11:44,765 --> 01:11:46,733
What's going on?

999
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:49,736
Where's the radio,
the lamp and blanket?

1000
01:11:49,804 --> 01:11:51,669
Whoa!

1001
01:12:02,082 --> 01:12:04,516
[Engine Roar]

1002
01:13:40,948 --> 01:13:45,442
I'm glad the Master
has such good appliances.

1003
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,489
Yeah, couldn't get
any more modern.

1004
01:13:49,556 --> 01:13:52,252
They're wonderful.

[Mom]
Honey, take some of our things.

1006
01:14:22,723 --> 01:14:26,181
This lamp would look
so cute in your dorm room.

1007
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,784
Go for it.

1008
01:14:27,861 --> 01:14:30,386
What are you
going to read by?

1009
01:14:30,464 --> 01:14:32,398
I'll buy
some candles.

1010
01:14:32,466 --> 01:14:34,525
I won't read.
I'll go out.

1011
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:36,694
I'm not gonna
take your stuff.

1012
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:39,762
I'll just pick up a few
cheap things this afternoon.

1013
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,331
That's right,
ladies and gentlemen.

1014
01:14:42,409 --> 01:14:44,843
Appliances,
cheap appliances...

1015
01:14:44,912 --> 01:14:47,380
available now at
Ernie's Disposal.

1016
01:14:47,448 --> 01:14:49,916
Where's a good bargain
place around here?

1017
01:14:49,984 --> 01:14:52,350
You should have gone
for the new stuff.

1018
01:14:59,293 --> 01:15:01,727
Oh, were you
in line first?

1019
01:15:01,795 --> 01:15:03,820
After you,
of course!

1020
01:15:03,897 --> 01:15:05,831
Pardon me!

1021
01:15:20,247 --> 01:15:23,216
I can't take this
kind of pressure

1022
01:15:23,283 --> 01:15:25,274
I must confess

1023
01:15:25,352 --> 01:15:27,286
One more dusty road

1024
01:15:27,354 --> 01:15:29,481
Would just be
a road too long

1025
01:15:30,858 --> 01:15:33,725
Worthless

1026
01:15:33,794 --> 01:15:35,762
I just can't
I just can't

1027
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:37,797
I just can't seem
to get started

1028
01:15:37,865 --> 01:15:40,527
I don't have the heart
to live in the fast lane

1029
01:15:40,601 --> 01:15:43,968
All that is past
and gone

1030
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:48,666
Worthless

1031
01:15:48,742 --> 01:15:51,267
And there ain't nothing
you can do about it!

1032
01:15:52,312 --> 01:15:54,644
Pardon me
while I panic!

1033

Worthless

1035
01:16:00,054 --> 01:16:02,921
No, that place
is too expensive.

1036
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:04,924
Cheap!

1037
01:16:04,992 --> 01:16:07,119
We're talking
real cheap!

1038
01:16:07,194 --> 01:16:09,719
What about Rooney's
down on 53rd?

1039
01:16:09,797 --> 01:16:12,994
They've got used
vacuums and junk.

1040
01:16:13,067 --> 01:16:15,092
This just in.

1041
01:16:15,169 --> 01:16:17,330
Rooney's vacuums
found to be...

1042
01:16:17,404 --> 01:16:20,100
carcinogenic in
recent lab tests!

1043
01:16:20,174 --> 01:16:22,642
Big, big tumors
on those rats.

1044
01:16:22,709 --> 01:16:24,802
We've got photos
to prove it...

1045
01:16:24,878 --> 01:16:26,846
and I don't even
want to look at them.

1046
01:16:26,914 --> 01:16:29,712
I come from
K.C., Missouri

1047
01:16:29,783 --> 01:16:32,149
And I got my kicks
on Route 66

1048
01:16:32,219 --> 01:16:35,848
Every truck stop
from Butte to M.O.

1049
01:16:35,923 --> 01:16:38,858
Motown to old Alabama

1050
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:42,925
From Texarkana
and east of Savannah

1051
01:16:42,996 --> 01:16:45,897
From Tampa
to old Kokomo

I once ran
the Indy 500

1054
01:16:56,777 --> 01:16:59,371
I must confess
I'm impressed how I did

1055
01:16:59,446 --> 01:17:01,710
And I wonder how close
that I came

1056
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:05,612
Now I get
a second sensation

1057
01:17:05,686 --> 01:17:07,620
I was the top
of the line

1058
01:17:07,688 --> 01:17:09,622
Out of sight
out of mind

1059
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,749
So much for
fortune and fame

1060
01:17:11,825 --> 01:17:14,453
A bargain
in every buck!

1061

A buck in
every pocket!

1062
01:17:17,097 --> 01:17:19,998
A pocket in,
uh, every trouser!

01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:29,368
Once took a Texan
to a wedding

1067
01:17:29,443 --> 01:17:32,105
Once took a Texan
to a wedding

1068
01:17:32,179 --> 01:17:34,272
He kept forgetting
his loneliness

Letting his thoughts
turn to home and return

01:17:38,919 --> 01:17:41,513
I took a man
to a graveyard

I beg your pardon
It's quite hard enough

Let's go cruising and
see what we can find.

01:17:58,005 --> 01:18:01,099
Why wander endlessly through
the sprawling wasteland...

1076
01:18:01,175 --> 01:18:03,166
they call the city...

1077
01:18:03,243 --> 01:18:05,541
when your dreams

Once drove
a surfer to sunset

Who would believe
they would love me

1097
01:19:17,117 --> 01:19:20,211
And leave on a bus
back to old Santa Fe

01:19:21,555 --> 01:19:24,285
Once in an
Indian nation

Why look,

I think it is
my blanket.

1135
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:01,832
That's my radio.
Hey, Chris!

1136
01:23:01,908 --> 01:23:03,808
And the lamp!

1137
01:23:03,877 --> 01:23:05,845
Hey, Chris!

1138
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:21,293
Wait a minute!

1139
01:23:21,361 --> 01:23:23,886
These are mine.
Let go!

1140
01:23:23,964 --> 01:23:26,296
Whoa!

1141
01:23:34,574 --> 01:23:37,509
Let me down!

1142
01:23:37,577 --> 01:23:39,568
Aaah!

1143
01:23:50,557 --> 01:23:52,991
Chris! Help!

1144
01:23:53,059 --> 01:23:55,619
Where are you?

1145
01:23:55,695 --> 01:23:57,162
Rob?

1146
01:24:02,469 --> 01:24:04,494
Chris!

1147
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:11,741
Aaah!

1148
01:24:35,869 --> 01:24:37,837
Whew!

1149
01:24:37,904 --> 01:24:40,429
Would you cool it?
Get down here.

1150
01:24:40,507 --> 01:24:42,873
You're scaring me
to death.

1151
01:24:55,956 --> 01:24:57,981
Really now.

1152
01:24:58,058 --> 01:25:00,549
Why don't you just
buy a new one?

1153
01:25:00,627 --> 01:25:04,290
Where could I find another
toaster like this?

1154
01:25:04,364 --> 01:25:07,424
Like that?
Probably nowhere.

1155
01:25:11,771 --> 01:25:14,103
Ah-ha!

1156
01:25:18,445 --> 01:25:20,640
Bye, Mom.
I love you.

1157
01:25:20,714 --> 01:25:22,705
I'll call you tonight.

1158
01:25:22,782 --> 01:25:24,750
You forgot your sweater!!

1159
01:25:26,853 --> 01:25:29,321
We did good,
didn't we?

1160
01:25:29,389 --> 01:25:32,847
Yep, we did good.

1161
01:25:32,926 --> 01:25:35,258
You know,
I've been thinking.

1162
01:25:35,328 --> 01:25:38,889
This college business
seems like a good idea.

1163
01:25:38,965 --> 01:25:42,162
I can absorb a lot
of interesting facts.

1164
01:25:42,235 --> 01:25:44,965
I'm picking up a news flash!

1165
01:25:45,038 --> 01:25:48,974
President Roosevelt has declared
today a national holiday...

1166
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:53,274
in honor of those five amazing
appliances we've heard about.

1167
01:25:53,346 --> 01:25:56,144
So lock up the office,
take down the top...

1168
01:25:56,216 --> 01:25:58,343
and open that
rumble seat!

1169
01:25:58,418 --> 01:26:01,012
Last one to Coney Island
is a party pooper.

1170
01:26:01,087 --> 01:26:03,851
From the starlight roof
high atop the Ritz...

1171
01:26:03,923 --> 01:26:06,414
we wish our intrepid
little friends...

1172
01:26:06,493 --> 01:26:08,552
the best of luck...

1173
01:26:08,628 --> 01:26:11,153
and a fond farewell!

1174
01:26:11,231 --> 01:26:14,200
Ah, you're all
a bunch of junk.
