349
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,392
I understand.

350
00:44:08,462 --> 00:44:11,488
I have to leave Alfredo
for a while.

351
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:15,965
It will be painful for me. Still--

352
00:44:16,036 --> 00:44:17,367
That is not what I ask.

353
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:20,100
God, what more do you want?

354
00:44:20,174 --> 00:44:21,607
I've granted so much already!

355
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,471
It's still not enough.

356
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:25,512
You want me to give him up?

357
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,240
You must.

358
00:44:27,314 --> 00:44:29,680
Oh, no, never!

359
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,817
No, never!

360
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,583
Can you not see
the great passion...

361
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:39,217
that lives and burns
in my breast?

362
00:44:39,293 --> 00:44:41,989
Having neither family
nor friends...

363
00:44:42,062 --> 00:44:44,826
among the living.

364
00:44:44,898 --> 00:44:47,389
Alfredo swore...

365
00:44:47,468 --> 00:44:50,096
he'd be everything to me!

366
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,536
Don't you know
my life is tainted...

367
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,940
with a dreadful malady?

368
00:44:57,678 --> 00:45:00,670
That I know the end is near?

369
00:45:00,748 --> 00:45:04,013
Leave Alfredo!

370
00:45:05,252 --> 00:45:09,052
A torture so cruel
I would rather die!

371
00:45:09,757 --> 00:45:12,920
Yes, I'd rather die!

372
00:45:34,114 --> 00:45:36,947
It is a great sacrifice...

373
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:43,752
but listen to me calmly.

374
00:45:47,795 --> 00:45:50,559
You're beautiful...

375
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:53,866
you're young...

376
00:45:54,435 --> 00:45:56,369
and in time--

377
00:45:56,437 --> 00:46:00,305
Oh, say no more!

378
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:03,371
I understand...

379
00:46:03,444 --> 00:46:07,175
but it's impossible.

380
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:11,076
I could only love him.

381
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,383
Perhaps.

382
00:46:17,391 --> 00:46:19,291
But men...

383
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,021
are often fickle--

384
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:25,190
Good God!

385
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:32,437
One day, time...

386
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:38,901
will tarnish your charms.

387
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,942
Then boredom will set in.

388
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,317
What then?

389
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,756
Think it over.

390
00:46:52,826 --> 00:46:56,626
You will find no help...

391
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:02,330
in the force of your love.

392
00:47:04,972 --> 00:47:10,103
For the Lord
will not have blessed...

393
00:47:13,847 --> 00:47:16,975
a union such as yours.

394
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,314
Then give up...

395
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,951
this seductive dream.

396
00:47:29,897 --> 00:47:31,558
It is true.

397
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,634
Become instead...

398
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,003
our family's guardian angel.

399
00:47:42,743 --> 00:47:45,337
Violetta, for pity's sake...

400
00:47:45,412 --> 00:47:48,245
there's still time!

401
00:47:48,582 --> 00:47:52,382
God Himself, my child...

402
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:01,189
God speaks
through a grieving father.

403
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,701
Then there's no hope...

404
00:48:10,837 --> 00:48:13,965
for the wretched woman...

405
00:48:16,877 --> 00:48:20,210
who fell from grace one day.

406
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,249
She will never rise again.

407
00:48:26,019 --> 00:48:29,216
God, in all His kindness...

408
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:34,226
may nonetheless forgive her.

409
00:48:34,928 --> 00:48:39,262
But men will not relent!

410
00:49:16,336 --> 00:49:19,305
Tell your daughter...

411
00:49:22,576 --> 00:49:26,137
so innocent and beautiful...

412
00:49:30,517 --> 00:49:34,510
that a victim of misfortune...

413
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:53,470
has renounced...

414
00:49:55,509 --> 00:49:58,410
for her sake...

415
00:50:04,518 --> 00:50:06,952
her one glimmer of hope...

416
00:50:10,323 --> 00:50:12,985
before dying!

417
00:50:19,132 --> 00:50:22,624
Weep, weep...

418
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:26,036
poor, unhappy child.

419
00:50:37,651 --> 00:50:40,586
Courage!

420
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,523
A heart as noble as your own...

421
00:50:47,894 --> 00:50:51,489
will surely triumph!

422
00:51:06,379 --> 00:51:09,280
What must I do?

423
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:13,575
Tell him you don't love him.

424
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:17,856
He won't believe me.

425
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:21,759
Then leave.

426
00:51:23,496 --> 00:51:27,830
He would follow.

427
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:37,843
Like your daughter...

428
00:51:38,611 --> 00:51:41,978
take me in your arms.

429
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:47,551
It will make me strong.

430
00:51:48,488 --> 00:51:52,288
Soon you'll have him back...

431
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,592
heartbroken...

432
00:51:55,428 --> 00:51:58,886
and you'll console him.

433
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,691
What will you do?

434
00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:06,068
If you knew, you'd stop me.

435
00:52:07,907 --> 00:52:10,000
Noble creature!

436
00:52:10,076 --> 00:52:12,670
What can I do for you?

437
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:24,446
I'll die!

438
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:27,984
But when I'm dead...

439
00:52:29,596 --> 00:52:32,622
don't let him curse my memory.

440
00:52:35,034 --> 00:52:38,026
At least let him know...

441
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:41,232
how much I've suffered for him.

442
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:45,340
No, my child, you must live...

443
00:52:46,179 --> 00:52:49,580
and find happiness.

444
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:54,377
Heaven will reward...

445
00:52:55,388 --> 00:52:57,822
your tears some day.

446
00:53:02,128 --> 00:53:06,531
- He must know the sacrifice...
- Your great sacrifice...

447
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,194
- I made for love.
- will one day be rewarded.

448
00:53:10,737 --> 00:53:15,674
- My last breath...
- You'll then be proud...

449
00:53:16,142 --> 00:53:18,508
- will be for him!
- of an act so noble.

450
00:53:19,912 --> 00:53:22,403
Someone's coming. Go.

451
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:26,350
My heart's so grateful to you!

452
00:53:26,419 --> 00:53:27,886
Leave!

453
00:53:32,692 --> 00:53:36,355
We may never meet again.

454
00:53:40,867 --> 00:53:43,563
Be happy!

455
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:50,632
Farewell!

456
00:54:11,464 --> 00:54:15,161
Give me strength...

457
00:54:15,234 --> 00:54:18,169
O God!

458
00:54:41,327 --> 00:54:43,158
Did you call?

459
00:54:43,229 --> 00:54:46,596
Deliver this note in person.

460
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,198
Quiet!

461
00:54:49,268 --> 00:54:52,066
Go now.

462
00:54:57,176 --> 00:55:00,373
I must write him.

463
00:55:11,157 --> 00:55:13,819
What will I say?

464
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:20,798
Who will give me the courage?

465
00:56:03,709 --> 00:56:05,199
What are you doing?

466
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,267
Nothing.

467
00:56:06,345 --> 00:56:07,642
Writing?

468
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,609
You're so nervous.
Who is the letter for?

469
00:56:11,184 --> 00:56:12,173
For you.

470
00:56:12,251 --> 00:56:13,240
Give it to me!

471
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:14,479
Not yet.

472
00:56:14,554 --> 00:56:17,785
Forgive me. I'm worried.

473
00:56:19,058 --> 00:56:21,049
My father was here.

474
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,151
You saw him?

475
00:56:22,228 --> 00:56:24,822
No. He left me a stern letter.

476
00:56:25,231 --> 00:56:27,096
But he'll be back.

477
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,566
He'll love you at first sight.

478
00:56:30,703 --> 00:56:34,002
He mustn't find me here.
Let me go.

479
00:56:34,407 --> 00:56:37,808
Calm him.
I'll throw myself at his feet.

480
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:41,003
He will not separate us.

481
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,676
We'll be happy...

482
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:46,483
because you love me, Alfredo.

483
00:56:47,286 --> 00:56:49,914
You love me, don't you?

484
00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:53,249
You love me, Alfredo.
You love me!

485
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,894
So very much!

486
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:02,434
Why are you crying?

487
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:06,165
I need these tears.

488
00:57:08,307 --> 00:57:10,605
Now I'm better.

489
00:57:11,944 --> 00:57:15,277
Can't you tell?

490
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:19,282
I'm smiling. See?

491
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:24,179
I'll be there...

492
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,792
among my flowers...

493
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,260
close to you always...

494
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,522
always close to you.

495
00:57:38,971 --> 00:57:41,906
Love me, Alfredo...

496
00:57:47,113 --> 00:57:50,446
as much as I love you!

497
00:58:15,308 --> 00:58:17,640
Farewell!

498
00:58:23,449 --> 00:58:26,509
[ Music Stops ]

499
00:58:35,895 --> 00:58:40,264
[ Music Begins ]

500
00:59:05,858 --> 00:59:08,326
My darling lives...

501
00:59:10,563 --> 00:59:13,862
only for my love.

502
00:59:23,008 --> 00:59:26,910
It's late.
My father won't come.

503
00:59:32,551 --> 00:59:35,247
Someone's in the garden.
Who is it?

504
00:59:35,754 --> 00:59:37,517
Monsieur Germont?

505
00:59:38,858 --> 00:59:42,385
A lady in a carriage,
not far from here...

506
00:59:43,362 --> 00:59:45,694
gave me this for you.

507
00:59:50,236 --> 00:59:52,898
From Violetta!

508
00:59:56,075 --> 00:59:59,101
Why am I so moved?

509
01:00:01,914 --> 01:00:05,372
Perhaps she wants me
to join her.

510
01:00:08,988 --> 01:00:11,047
I'm shaking.

511
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,721
Courage!

512
01:00:17,162 --> 01:00:20,620
"Alfredo, by the time
you read this letter--"

513
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:29,439
Father!

514
01:00:32,311 --> 01:00:35,906
My son, I know
how you must suffer.

515
01:00:35,981 --> 01:00:38,381
Cry no more.

516
01:00:38,617 --> 01:00:41,916
Come back to your father.

517
01:00:43,756 --> 01:00:46,987
You're his pride and joy!

518
01:01:06,078 --> 01:01:09,980
The sea and soil of Provence...

519
01:01:10,382 --> 01:01:13,749
what erased them
from your heart?

520
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,324

No, you can't die!

865
01:45:50,768 --> 01:45:53,362
You must live, my love.

866
01:45:53,437 --> 01:45:56,736
God did not bring me back...

867
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:59,934
to endure such agony!

868
01:46:14,124 --> 01:46:17,059
If a maiden fair...

869
01:46:19,763 --> 01:46:24,928
should give her heart to you...

870
01:46:38,082 --> 01:46:41,882
marry her.

871
01:46:47,291 --> 01:46:48,986
I want you to.

872
01:46:51,361 --> 01:46:54,262
Show her this portrait.

873
01:46:56,733 --> 01:47:00,692
Tell her it's a gift...

874
01:47:03,173 --> 01:47:07,132
from someone who,
among the angels...

875
01:47:09,646 --> 01:47:11,511
prays...

876
01:47:12,082 --> 01:47:15,779
for her and for you.

877
01:47:16,353 --> 01:47:19,948
As long as eyes have tears...

878
01:47:20,023 --> 01:47:22,617
I will weep for you.

879
01:47:24,761 --> 01:47:28,629
Fly to the kingdom of heaven.

880
01:47:31,635 --> 01:47:34,331
God is calling you.

881
01:47:35,005 --> 01:47:37,599
He is calling you to Him.

882
01:48:19,583 --> 01:48:21,574
How strange!

883
01:48:27,658 --> 01:48:29,785
The spasms...

884
01:48:30,794 --> 01:48:32,455
have stopped.

885
01:48:33,964 --> 01:48:38,128
In me is reborn...

886
01:48:42,039 --> 01:48:44,030
reawakened...

887
01:48:44,441 --> 01:48:47,569
a new strength...

888
01:48:50,714 --> 01:48:53,012
Yes, l.. I...

889
01:48:54,685 --> 01:48:58,951
I am returning to life!

890
01:49:26,049 --> 01:49:30,577
