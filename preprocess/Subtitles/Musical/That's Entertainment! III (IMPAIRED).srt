[SINGING]
Here's to the beautiful ladies

2
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,370
Here's to those wonderful girls

3
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:37,794
This is the mixture to start the picture
So bring on the beautiful girls

4
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:43,050
NARRATOR: When Fred Astaire sang
this song in the film Ziegfeld Follies...

5
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,719
...the year was 1946...

6
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:50,599
...and MGM was at the height of its success
in creating incredible fantasies...

7
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,518
...and setting them to music.

8
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,981
Here, Lucille Ball tames a pack
of exotic cat-women.

9
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:03,320
It was imaginative, outlandish imagery,
and audiences loved it.

10
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:07,783
It was a time before television and VCRs,
when on the average...

11
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,286
...90 million Americans
went to the movies each week...

12
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:15,123
...and the MGM musical
was king of the box office.

13
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,544
The most popular entertainment
in the world.

14
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:43,360
CHORUS [SINGING]:
This is the mixture to start the picture

15
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:50,409
So bring on the beautiful girls

16
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,487
NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, there was a factory...

17
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,615
...that created wonderful musical dreams.

18
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:15,911
It happened when a special group
of talented artists came together...

19
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,706
...to create some of the world's
most enchanting movies.

20
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,834
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
was not the only studio...

21
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,003
...that made musical motion pictures.

22
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,464
But it did make more than anyone else...

23
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,300
...and somehow did it better.

24
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,928
To tell us more
about those remarkable days...

25
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:37,098
...here's one of MGM's best:
Mr. Gene Kelly.

26
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,685
The 44 acres behind me...

27
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,729
...was where it all began.

28
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,023
When I first arrived here...

29
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,069
...MGM's dream factory
was in full swing.

30
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:53,365
And every week
the studio released a new film...

31
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,869
...and musicals
were always a big part of the lineup.

32
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:03,375
But the success of the MGM musical
did not happen overnight.

33
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:08,088
It all started
when the movies learned to talk.

34
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,131
[ALL SINGING]

35
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:14,678
KELLY: At first, the studios were unsure
of what to do with this new invention.

36
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,974
Then they hit on the idea
of filming popular vaudeville acts.

37
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:24,020
ALL [SINGING]: My pet told me cutely
That I'm set absolutely

38
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:29,568
- So I pet with nobody else but my, my pet
- Whose pet?

39
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,320
- I repeat that he's my pet
- Whose pet?

40
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,575
Ain't he sweet?
And I pet with nobody else

41
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:43,623
But my pet

42
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,922
KELLY:
In The Hollywood Revue of 1929...

43
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,343
...one of the first all-talking, all-singing,
all-dancing movies...

44
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,388
...the studio gave its huge roster
of stars...

45
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,683
...a chance to get their feet wet...

46
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,185
...in the newfangled talkies.

47
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:09,399
The finale introduced a brand-new song
that did a lot for me much later.

48
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,027
But at the time it was so new...

49
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,697
...that some of the performers
had trouble remembering the lyrics.

50
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,284
ALL [SINGING]: Let the stormy clouds
Chase everyone from the place

51
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:24,247
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face

52
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:28,835
I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain

53
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:33,131
Just singin'
Just singin' in the rain

54
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,384
Singin' in the rain

55
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:43,558
Just singin' in the rain

56
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:49,022
KELLY: Suddenly, the musical became
an overnight sensation...

57
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,275
...delighting audiences
with bigger casts...

58
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,027
...lavish sets and costumes...

59
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,530
...and even a new gimmick
called Technicolor.

60
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,868
MGM began its most ambitious film
of this kind...

61
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,162
...in late 1930...

62
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,873
...and filmed
all the big production numbers...

63
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:12,212
...before the public lost interest
in these plotless musicals...

64
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,006
...and the project was abandoned.

65
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,676
One of the numbers
featured The Dodge Twins...

66
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,262
...performing... What else?
- "The Lock Step"...

67
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,057
...from the unfinished March of Time.

68
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,810
[SINGING] Shake your stripes
Beat your pipe

69
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,978
Start crooning the jailhouse wail

70
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,941
Lock your cell
Step light, hello, warden

71
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,444
Join in and lock step
It'll get you fizzin'

72
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,907
Like bottles of pop
Get hep to the new jazz prison

73
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,075
Lock step

74
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,724
Clean as a whistle
Fresh as a daisy

75
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,184
Brand-new
Clean through

76
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:12,647
On my way
Just wearin' that smile of mine

77
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,817
Clean as a whistle
Fresh as a daisy

78
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,194
Spick-and-span

79
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,740
Spend my day
Just wearin' a great big smile

80
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:27,120
KELLY: To capture an audience,
producers knew they could always turn...

81
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,206
...to the old reliable sex.

82
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,583
Imagine that.

83
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,044
This number,
set in the shower room of a girls' school...

84
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,840
...shocked audiences in 1933.

85
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,967
ALL [SINGING]:
All wearin' a great big smile

86
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,219
Can't you see we're all excited?

87
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,472
They might be relaxing

88
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,518
But, gee, I'd rather
Exercise myself into

89
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,854
Say, the water stopped.

90
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,190
- Water.
- Water.

91
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,986
KELLY: Such scenes fuelled
the growing public outcry.

92
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,448
Faced with threats of boycotts
and censorship...

93
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,911
...MGM conformed
to the stern Production Code.

94
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:13,041
- That the vulgar, the cheap
and the tawdry is out.

95
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,628
There is no room on this screen
at any time...

96
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,048
...for pictures which offend
against common decency.

97
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,343
And these, the industry will not allow.

98
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:28,097
EDDY [SINGING]:
Ah, sweet mystery of life

99
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,851
At last I found thee

100
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,395
Ah

101
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,482
KELLY: Among MGM's efforts
for the new morality...

102
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,902
...was a series
of wildly successful operettas...

103
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,238
...with Jeanette MacDonald
and Nelson Eddy.

104
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:50,411
BOTH [SINGING]: My heart has heard
The answer to its calling

105
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:58,002
For it is love that rules

106
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:08,179
Forevermore

107
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:20,108
KELLY: In 1934, the studio lifted the public
out of the Depression...

108
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,403
...and into a make-believe
Hollywood party.

109
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,824
[SINGING] Hollywood party
Get up, get up, get in it

110
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:32,412
Hollywood party
Nobody sleeps tonight

111
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,541
Hollywood party
Going a mile a minute

112
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:41,296
Hollywood party
Nobody sleeps tonight

113
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,883
Let the laughter spring out
Music ring out

114
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,468
Satan sing out, "Yeah, man"

115
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,470
At that crashing, furniture-smashing

116
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,765
Hollywood party
Nobody sleeps tonight

117
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,768
And now, here's to beauty,
laughter, romance, music.

118
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,187
On with the biggest party
ever given in Hollywood.

119
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,066
[SINGING]
Feelin' high

120
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,573
What's the use
Feelin' low?

121
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:12,660
On that wagon
On the town

122
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:16,789
Gonna be up
Never down

123
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,093
There's a reason
If you'd like to know why

124
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,970
I'm in love

125
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:35,934
I'm feelin' high

126
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,731
KELLY: Even the biggest production numbers
needed stars.

127
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:47,445
So Eleanor Powell
became MGM's first big dancing star.

128
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:52,033
In Broadway Melody of 1938
and almost all of her films...

129
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,037
...Eleanor becomes a huge sensation
by the last reel.

130
00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:00,375
ALL [SINGING]:
Follow in my footsteps

131
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:12,220
Follow them

132
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,393
Your Broadway
And my Broadway

133
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,561
Got that rhythm

134
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,313
Inside me
Everybody dance

135
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,192
You are my lucky star

136
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,279
Hear the rhythm of the music
And the music of the rhythm

137
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,412
Got a pair of new shoes
Got a pair of new shoes

138
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,415
Gotta dance

139
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,918
Tap your feet
Light, long and sweet

140
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,839
And dance

141
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,117
Dance
Now Broadway dance

142
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,786
A Broadway dance and go singing

143
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,748
The whole town is waking up

144
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,668
Your Broadway

145
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:32,258
And mine

146
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,310
KELLY:
It took a lot of hard work...

147
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,980
...to make musical production numbers
for the big screen.

148
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,648
And here's a good example.

149
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,569
Eleanor Powell's tap dance
of "Fascinating Rhythm"...

150
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,446
...from Lady Be Good.

151
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,533
On the right, we see what went on
behind the scenes.

152
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,870
Stagehands using little tractors
called mules...

153
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,206
...quickly take the set apart...

154
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:09,003
...allowing the camera to move forward
to follow her dancing.

155
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,242
CHORUS [SINGING]: Fascinatin' rhythm
You've got me on the go

156
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,786
Fascinatin' rhythm
I'm all aquiver

157
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,081
What a mess you're making
The neighbors will know

158
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,250
I'm always shaking like a flivver

159
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,087
Each morning I'm wakin' up

160
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,673
Very happy

161
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,259
Just to find that no work has been done

162
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,970
Once it didn't matter
But now you do wrong

163
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,598
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy

164
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,475
Won't you take a day off?
A couple of weeks?

165
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,020
Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy

166
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:54,108
Oh, how I long to be the man
That I used to be

167
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,485
Oh, fascinatin' rhythm

168
00:19:56,653 --> 00:20:01,282
Won't you stop picking on me?

169
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,607
- Good morning
- It's a lovely morning

170
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,109
- Good morning
- What a wonderful day

171
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,947
We've danced the whole night through

172
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,908
Good morning, good morning to you

173
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,326
How do you do?

174
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,663
KELLY: When MGM teamed
Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland...

175
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,665
...in Babes in Arms...

176
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:54,377
...it launched the most successful
musical team at the studio.

177
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,964
BOTH [SINGING]:
Good morning, good morning to you

178
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:22,029
KELLY: With World War II raging in Europe,
the Mickey-Judy musicals...

179
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:27,201
...provided an uplifting diversion
for audiences of the day.

180
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45,886
ALL [SINGING]: Qherever freedom's banners
Are unfurled sing a song from our hearts

181
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,181
To the hearts of the world

182
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,852
We send our greetings to friendly nations

183
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,981
We may be Yanks
But we're your relations

184
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:01,027
Drop your sabers
We're all gonna be good neighbors

185
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,572
Here in God's

186
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,034
God's

187
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:15,207
Country

188
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,925
KELLY: As Andy Hardy,
Mickey Rooney was always falling in love.

189
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:29,597
Esther Williams played his love interest
in her first film.

190
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,099
A fashion model
and champion swimmer...

191
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,602
...Esther was working in an aquacade...

192
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,356
...when she caught the attention
of an MGM talent scout.

193
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,984
In the 22 films she made at Metro...

194
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,987
...she was seldom out of the water.

195
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,375
WILLIAMS:
This is MGM's famous saucer tank.

196
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,295
I did many of
my underwater scenes here.

197
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:05,466
It's a huge, all-steel swimming pool...

198
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,720
...with porthole windows
just below the water line...

199
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:14,141
...so that you can see
anything that's going on inside.

200
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:30,699
This tank was originally built as a place
for Tarzan, Johnny Weissmuller...

201
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,160
...to fight his rubber crocodiles.

202
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,996
But I really had it
pretty much to myself...

203
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,833
...once my swimming musicals
became popular.

204
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,420
DURANTE [SINGING]: Every time they start off
Wit' a water ballet

205
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,631
There's the customary swimmin' pool
To swim in

206
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,969
But we don't wanna do it
In the customary way

207
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,139
So we start off
Just with bathin' suits and women

208
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,268
WILLIAMS: It had been five years
since my Andy Hardy movie.

209
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,354
By this time,
I had starred in several films.

210
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,524
And MGM was committed
to finding new ways...

211
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,068
...to get me out of my clothes
and into the pool...

212
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,655
...as in This Time for Keeps
with the great Jimmy Durante.

213
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,033
DURANTE [SINGING]:
Take ten percent off for your agent

214
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,036
Take ten percent off for the press

215
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,708
Then take another ten
For your publicity men

216
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,294
What's another ten more or less?

217
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,548
Then take off a few incidentals

218
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,593
It's the little things that really count

219
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,722
Anyone with half a brain
Can show a capital gain

220
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,974
If you take off the proper

221
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,726
Listen to your Papa

222
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,187
Take off the proper amount

223
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,912
WILLIAMS:
I was called America's mermaid...

224
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,541
...because it appeared
that I could stay underwater indefinitely.

225
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,265
In Jupiter's Darling...

226
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,935
...I swam into
a sunken Roman amphitheater...

227
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:26,690
...where my presence had the magical effect
of bringing statues to life.

228
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,358
In Dangerous When Wet...

229
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:14,530
...I swam into a cartoon sequence
where I met Tom and Jerry.

230
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:20,327
You know, they were more animated
than some of my leading men.

231
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:50,441
In Texas Carnival, I became
Howard Keel's underwater dream...

232
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,652
...right there in his own living room.

233
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,218
For 12 years,
I was the center of an amazing series...

234
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:22,139
...of vivid sights and water pageantry.

235
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,309
And I loved every minute of it.

236
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:27,830
ALLYSON [SINGING]: I'd be like Cleopatterer
If I could have my way

237
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,541
Each man she met she went and kissed

238
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,168
And she'd dozens on her waiting list

239
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:38,507
I wish that I had lived there
Beside the pyramid

240
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:43,846
For a girl today don't get the scope
That Cleopatterer did

241
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,390
WILLIAMS:
If one performer could exemplify...

242
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,768
...the lighthearted spirit
of the MGM musical...

243
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:53,230
...then June Allyson would surely be it.

244
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,899
Here, from Till the Clouds Roll By...

245
00:28:56,067 --> 00:29:01,488
...she romanticizes the virtues
of that ancient Egyptian princess...

246
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,449
...Cleopatterer.

247
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:08,829
ALLYSON [SINGING]: Gaping in a line
And watch her agitate her spine

248
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,915
It simply use to knock them flat

249
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,336
When she went like this
And then like that

250
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,179
At dancing Cleopatterer
Was always on the spot

251
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,140
She gave these poor Egyptian ginks

252
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,809
Something else to watch
Besides the sphinx

253
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:36,148
Marc Antony admitted
That what first made him skid

254
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:41,487
Was the wibbly, wobbly, wiggly dance
That Cleopatterer did

255
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,273
This was the original main gate at MGM.

256
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:21,318
In the early days,
when a star came to work...

257
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,861
...they'd drive in here...

258
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,656
...and then the studio car
would whisk them off...

259
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,367
...to their destination on the lot.

260
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,536
It was all so glamorous.

261
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,579
MGM liked to boast...

262
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:36,083
...that it had more stars
than there are in the heavens.

263
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:40,212
I just felt lucky to be counted among them
when I was still just a kid.

264
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,090
[SINGING] I never wanna hear
Johann Sebastian Bach

265
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,842
ALLYSON:
That's me on the right.

266
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,928
Still wet behind the ears
from the Broadway show...

267
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,179
...Best Foot Forward...

268
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:53,183
...which the studio bought
and took me along as part of the package.

269
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,518
It's not hard to tell...

270
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,479
...that Nancy Walker,
Gloria DeHaven and I...

271
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,524
...desperately wanted
to make good at Metro.

272
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:06,238
ALL [SINGING]: Yes, the barrelhouse
The boogie-woogie and the blues

273
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,449
Oh, the barrelhouse
Makes you want to carol

274
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,035
Every boogie beat will raise your heat

275
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,121
When they start to play the blues

276
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,916
You'll never choose to lose the blues

277
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:23,630
Oh, the blues will really get you

278
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:27,885
And the barrelhouse
Is bound to upset you

279
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,723
And the boogie-woogie beat
Will drive you straight to distraction

280
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,559
Hey, let's go professors
Get a solid reaction

281
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,144
From a barrelhouse

282
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,564
The boog-boog-boog-boog boogie
And the blues

283
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,151
I love the boogie
'Cause it tickles my spine

284
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,154
I love the boogie
'Cause it's fresh and it's fine

285
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:51,325
Just like a cigarette with modern design
That's why I love the boogie-woogie

286
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,993
Yes, yes

287
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,913
It seems to knock the wind
Right out of my chest

288
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,957
It's so darn good
It makes a fool of the rest

289
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,335
Just goes to show you
That the boogie's the best

290
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,211
That's why I love the boogie-woogie

291
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,379
Yes, yes

292
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,465
It's right as rain
As low as thunder

293
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,093
High as a cloud
And sweet as a cake

294
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:14,056
It's got a kick like mountain liquor
And it's as slick and hard

295
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,433
To take as Veronica Lake

296
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,853
It picks you up
And then it knocks you right down

297
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,773
It makes you laugh and play
And act like a clown

298
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,025
No other music has the right
To the crown

299
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,778
'Cause there's nothing
That will raise your heat

300
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,490
- Like the boogie-woogie beat
- Don't mean the barrelhouse

301
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,368
- Like the boogie-woogie beat
- Don't mean the blues

302
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,746
I love the boogie-woogie beat

303
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,624
- She loves the boogie-woogie beat
- Great

304
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,878
ALLYSON: Each year,
hundreds of performers like me...

305
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,382
...were brought to MGM,
hoping to get a break in the movies.

306
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,177
There were acting teachers,
instructions in posture and grooming...

307
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,973
...and everybody had to learn
to sing and dance.

308
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,350
It was an extensive crash course...

309
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,395
...designed to find those
with that special something...

310
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,730
...known as star quality.

311
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,901
And if you had it,
you got to take the next big step:

312
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,487
The screen test.

313
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,324
For instance, Kathryn Grayson
had to wait two years at MGM...

314
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,452
...before she was given
her first screen test...

315
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,205
...represented here in Anchors Aweigh.

316
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:25,752
But the wait paid off because she became
one of MGM's leading sopranos...

317
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,547
...in the 1940s and '50s.

318
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,800
GRAYSON [SINGING]:
To the thrill of the night

319
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,039
Shakin' the blues away

320
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,750
Unhappy news away

321
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,793
If you were blue, it's easy to

322
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:10,464
Shake off your cares and troubles

323
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:16,011
ALLYSON: Ann Miller was only 14 when
she got her first movie contract at RKO...

324
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,847
...and was a seasoned pro
when she came to MGM...

325
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,892
...for Easter Parade.

326
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,707
CHORUS [SINGING]:
Shakin' the blues away

327
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,502
Unhappy news away

328
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,587
If you are blue
It's easy to

329
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,798
Shake off your
Shake off your cares

330
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,216
And shake off your troubles

331
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,843
Provin' that there's a way

332
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,638
To chase your cares away

333
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,681
If you would lose
Your weary blues

334
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:07,604
Shake them away

335
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:17,656
Away

336
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:30,210
ALLYSON: Joan McCracken
was a wonderfully talented artist...

337
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,045
...from the Broadway stage...

338
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:36,341
...brought to enrich
MGM's galaxy of dancing stars.

339
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:40,554
Here, Joan and Ray McDonald
bring their infectious enthusiasm...

340
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:44,933
...to pass that peace pipe
from Good News.

341
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,044
ALL [SINGING]: Solid potato salad
Is the groovy movie salad, Jack

342
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,880
Solid potato salad bowl

343
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,799
Da-do da-do da-do-day
Bring it back

344
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:03,094
ALLYSON: Sometimes the studio
tried out a novelty act...

345
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:07,474
...that just didn't catch on,
no matter how hard they worked.

346
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:11,394
Meet The Ross Sisters
from Broadway Rhythm.

347
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,614
Whoo! Whoo!

348
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,783
[SINGING]
We're going on the town

349
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:11,204
ALLYSON: MGM musicals had a special
enthusiasm all their own.

350
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,708
In the 1949 hit On the Town...

351
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,253
...Frank Sinatra, Jules Munshin
and Gene Kelly...

352
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,631
...teamed with Betty Garrett,
Ann Miller and Vera-Ellen...

353
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,134
...as three sailors and their dates...

354
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,637
...go out on a night in New York City.

355
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,433
ALL [SINGING]: And hit the heights tonight
Get high as kites tonight

356
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:37,063
East side, west side, rouse the city

357
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:43,486
One day, one night, that's the pity

358
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,989
But we won't look ahead

359
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:51,536
Won't let the light of dawn get us down

360
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:57,250
We're really living, Jack
We're going on the town

361
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,546
We're going on the town

362
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,924
We're kicking back the traces

363
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,136
We're gonna do the places

364
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,889
We've never done before

365
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,100
We're going on the loose

366
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,437
We're throwing all our dough in

367
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,690
And we'll keep right on going

368
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,236
As if no one before had any fun before

369
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:30,450
Hot spots, swank spots
Roofs and cellars

370
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:37,082
Three smart girls
And three slick fellers

371
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,292
We're going to paint it red

372
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,838
We'll fill 'em up
And then drink 'em down

373
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,965
Let's have a ball tonight

374
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:52,305
We're going on the town

375
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:58,436
What a dame, what a dame
She belongs in the hall of fame

376
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:02,649
ALLYSON: I have always admired
the strength and stamina of dancers.

377
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,318
And one of the greatest
is Cyd Charisse...

378
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:09,030
...whom Fred Astaire
called "beautiful dynamite."

379
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,032
And I completely agree.

380
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
ALL [SINGING]:
I'm flat

381
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,703
Baby, you knock me out

382
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,872
You're the whistle in the kisser
Super sweet

383
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,458
You're the top
People stop when you're on the street

384
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,627
You're a wow with the power
I admit defeat

385
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:26,297
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, boing

386
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,509
I'm beat
Star light, star bright

387
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,511
I see stars when you move in

388
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,139
One, two, left, right
You win

389
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,765
You got me hangin' on the ropes

390
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,559
Baby, you knock me out

391
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,019
You're the broad
I'd applaud in a Broadway show

392
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,188
You're the chick with the kick
Like a rodeo

393
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,524
Mighty punch, you got the punch
That lays me low

394
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:48,194
One, two, three, four,
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, boing

395
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,362
KO

396
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,197
Bam, slam
Hear me shout

397
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,991
Baby

398
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:58,079
You knock me out

399
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,763
This was MGM's scenic backdrop building
where talented artists...

400
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:19,809
...created their movie magic,
and this is just one section...

401
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,062
...of a huge painting
re-creating the Scottish countryside...

402
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,231
...for the film Brigadoon.

403
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:29,235
Altogether, it was originally
600 feet long...

404
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:33,072
...and 60 feet high
and wrapped around the entire interior...

405
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,408
...of MGM's Stage 15.

406
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,119
Gene Kelly and I spent many hours...

407
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:43,666
...rehearsing and filming our dance numbers
in front of these heathered hills.

408
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,503
I've always had such respect for Gene.

409
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:51,174
Dancer, singer, actor, choreographer...

410
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,134
...and director.

411
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,677
He did it all...

412
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,680
...and always brought
exciting new dimensions...

413
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,266
...to the musical motion picture.

414
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,602
BOTH [SINGING]: First, you put your
Two knees close up tight

415
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,855
Then you sway 'em to the left
Then you sway 'em to the right

416
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,274
Step around the floor kinda nice and light

417
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,402
Then you twist around and twist around
With all of your might

418
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,738
Stretch your lovin' arms
Straight out in space

419
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,616
Then you do the Eagle Rock
With the style and grace

420
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,452
Swing your foot way 'round
And bring it back

421
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,455
Now that's what I call Ballin' the Jack

422
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:27,460
CHARISSE: Gene's first big break came
on Broadway, starring in Pal Joey.

423
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,254
MGM soon grabbed him...

424
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,965
...and started him off
as Judy Garland's leading man...

425
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:35,468
...in For Me and My Gal.

426
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,358
BOTH [SINGING]:
Ballin' the Jack

427
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,212
CHARISSE:
Gene had a style all his own...

428
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,591
...charming and athletic,
with boundless energy.

429
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,594
In Summer Stock,
he created a classic number...

430
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:23,474
...using only a squeaky floor
and a newspaper as dance partners.

431
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,121
CHARISSE:
As a choreographer...

432
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:11,582
...Gene staged this exciting
and bittersweet ballet...

433
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,002
...to Richard Rodgers'
"Slaughter on Tenth Avenue"...

434
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,879
...from Words and Music.

435
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:21,092
His partner: The wonderful Vera-Ellen.

436
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,589
[WOMAN SCREAMING]

437
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,341
[WHISTLE TOOTING]

438
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,789
CHARISSE: Gene's inventiveness
seemed inexhaustible.

439
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,332
In An American in Paris...

440
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,418
...he even danced into
a Toulouse-Lautrec painting...

441
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,295
...to find Leslie Caron...

442
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:26,092
...and the incomparable music
of George Gershwin.

443
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,763
The film won six Oscars
plus a special award to Gene...

444
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:35,852
...for his brilliant achievements
in the art of choreography on film.

445
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:50,176
BOTH [SINGING]: Fit as a fiddle and ready
For love I can jump over the moon up above

446
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,678
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love

447
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,848
CHARISSE:
Gene teamed with Donald O'Connor...

448
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,684
...to perform this marvelously
comic vaudeville routine...

449
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:02,396
...for Singin' in the Rain.

450
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:07,109
BOTH [SINGING]: Soon all the church bells
Will be ringing and I'll march with Ma and Pa

451
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,278
How the church bells will be ringing

452
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,073
With a hey naughty-knotty
And a hotcha-cha

453
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,116
Hi, diddle-diddle, my baby's OK

454
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,577
Ask me a riddle, I'm waiting to say

455
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,330
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love

456
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:25,271
CHARISSE: It was my pleasure
to dance with Gene in several films...

457
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,107
...but I think this one is my favorite.

458
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:32,111
"The Heather on the Hill"
from Brigadoon.

459
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:47,413
[SINGING]
You are my lucky star

460
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,541
CHARISSE: Gene inspired
a whole new generation of stars.

461
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,085
One of the brightest
was a young California girl...

462
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,546
...named Debbie Reynolds.

463
00:52:55,714 --> 00:53:01,177
Here's Debbie in a rare outtake
from Singin' in the Rain.

464
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:07,433
REYNOLDS [SINGING]:
Rod La Rocque and Valentino

465
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,770
You are

466
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:19,945
My lucky star

467
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:34,627
I was only 16
and still Mary Frances Reynolds...

468
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,046
...when I entered
the Miss Burbank contest.

469
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,715
I did it as a lark
to get a blouse and a scarf...

470
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,301
...that they were giving away
to all the contestants.

471
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,136
Well, as fate would have it...

472
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,513
...an MGM talent scout
was in the audience...

473
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:51,185
...and in a year, I was under contract
to the biggest studio in Hollywood.

474
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:55,856
It was at MGM that I learned the workings
of the studio's glamour mill...

475
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:59,068
...comprised of dozens
of talented artists and technicians...

476
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:03,239
...who made MGM's leading ladies
appear on the screen...

477
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:06,075
...as images of unsurpassed beauty.

478
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:16,168
REYNOLDS: Gorgeous gowns created by
the world-famous designer Adrian...

479
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,836
...were part of the treatment.

480
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,838
As well as Makeup
and Hair Departments...

481
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,633
...that could accomplish
any style imaginable.

482
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,802
A star like Joan Crawford
would sometimes...

483
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,054
...have her look redesigned
numerous times...

484
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:32,142
...until it matched the exact mood
of the role she was to play.

485
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,021
The studio prided itself
on presenting some of the most...

486
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:39,608
...glamorous women
seen anywhere in the world.

487
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:06,385
CHORUS [SINGING]:
You stepped out of a dream

488
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:13,434
You are too wonderful
To be what you seem

489
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:17,855
Could there be eyes like yours?

490
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,734
Could there be lips like yours?

491
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:25,696
Could there be smiles like yours?

492
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:29,950
Honest and truly?

493
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:05,569
You stepped out of a cloud

494
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:09,448
REYNOLDS: In 1941, the glamour age
had reached its zenith...

495
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:13,660
...with Tony Martin and an all-star cast
in Ziegfeld Girl.

496
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:17,748
MARTIN [SINGING]:
And have you all to myself

497
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:24,880
Alone and apart
Out of a dream

498
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:31,720
Safe in my heart

499
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:36,600
Out of a dream

500
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:43,774
Of you

501
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:59,081
REYNOLDS: I even got the glamour treatment
in a dream sequence...

502
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,709
...to the song "A Lady Loves"
in the film I Love Melvin.

503
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:06,964
[SINGING] A lady loves expensive clothes
And pretty jewels and furs

504
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,049
And French chapeaus

505
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:14,138
She loves her lingerie in black
It suits her zodiac

506
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:18,016
Loves a penthouse
Where she'll be content to stay

507
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:21,311
Finds little gifts on her breakfast tray

508
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:24,857
But now and then pack and sail away

509
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:28,277
For a simple Riviera holiday

510
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,697
REYNOLDS: Donald O'Connor plays
my boyfriend in the film.

511
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:35,826
He envisions a different role in life
for my character.

512
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,371
His version of me
as a stay-at-home farm girl...

513
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,874
...was dropped from the final film.

514
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:45,669
Now, at last, you can see
our differing points of view.

515
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,796
A lady loves the simple things

516
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:51,216
She loves her dreams tied up
With apron strings

517
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,385
There are no yachts
In all her plans

518
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,387
Just little pots and pans

519
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:58,599
In the doorway
She'll wait for his warm caress

520
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,393
And he'll be handsome
Well, more or less

521
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,271
But he will notice that brand-new dress

522
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,357
Saying, "You look nice
Oh, never mind the price"

523
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:10,235
A lady loves beaucoup I'amour

524
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:14,114
But first of all she loves to be secure

525
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,909
And she adores the subtle phrase

526
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,119
That it's the man who pays

527
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:23,248
Yet there is one vital thought
She will place above

528
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:27,586
All of the things I make mention of

529
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,339
But most of all a lady loves to love

530
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,091
And what is more a lady loves to live

531
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:38,388
And what is more a lady lives to love

532
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,769
Thanks for the present
Of the silver-blue mink

533
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:48,106
Thanks for the plane
And the ice-skating rink

534
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:52,569
Thanks for the yacht
And for the solid-gold sink

535
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,073
Thanks a lot, but no thanks

536
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,285
REYNOLDS: Dolores Gray uses glamour
as a weapon...

537
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:04,248
...in this spoof of the power
of the devastating female...

538
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:06,166
...over the hapless male...

539
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,544
...from It's Always Fair Weather.

540
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,337
GRAY [SINGING]:
However classy

By which this lassie can be had

542
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:19,429
Thanks for the banks
And for the Santa Fe line

543
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:24,268
Thanks for the darling uranium mine

544
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:29,106
But I'm a gal
With only one valentine

545
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,858
Thanks a lot, but no thanks

546
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:37,906
For I am just a faithful lassie

547
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:42,077
Waitin' for her faithful lad

548
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:46,290
And there's no gift
However classy

549
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:51,295
By which this lassie can be had

550
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:55,340
Thanks for losin' your mind

551
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:59,970
And thanks for Fort Knox
Sealed and signed

01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:04,474
But I've got a guy who's Clifton Webb
And Marlon Brando combined

553
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:12,357
Thanks a lot, but no

554
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:20,824
No thanks

555
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:27,331
I don't know why they scold me

556
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:32,711
For doing what I'm trying not to do

557
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:36,715
REYNOLDS: In Torch Song, Joan Crawford
made her final musical film...

558
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,300
...as a fading legend...

559
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:43,055
...performing in tropical makeup
for the song "Two-Faced Woman."

560
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:45,599
The recording wasn't a new one at MGM.

561
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,060
Sung by voice double India Adams...

562
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,646
...it had originally
been used with Cyd Charisse...

563
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:54,816
...for The Band Wagon,
but was cut from the final film.

564
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:58,779
It's been suggested that they may have
dropped the wrong version.

565
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,447
CRAWFORD [SINGING]:

CHARISSE [SINGING]:
I don't belong

I can't help being a two-faced woman

568
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,335
A little bit of boldness
A little bit of sweetness

569
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,587
A little bit of coldness
A little bit of heatness

570
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,924
Don't fall in love

573
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:26,098
I'm like a weathervane

A two-faced woman

They call me two-faced woman

REYNOLDS:
In the early 1940s...

590
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,643
...Hollywood began a fascination
with things tropical...

591
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:57,814
...and south of the border,
and MGM was no exception.

592
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:00,066
Exotic rhythms and costumes...

593
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:03,153
...transported audiences
away from cold climates...

594
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,031
...and the troubled times of a world war.

595

[SINGING IN SPANISH]

596
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:23,673
REYNOLDS: Many Latin artists were recruited
to add an authentic sound to these films.

597
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:27,803
One of the most popular
was Xavier Cugat and his orchestra.

became a sensation at Metro...

600
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:34,369
...as the Latin lover,
driving female audiences wild.

601

from The Kissing Bandit...

602
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:42,127
...there doesn't seem to be
enough Ricardo to go around.

01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:52,530
REYNOLDS: From Nancy Goes to Rio
comes the Brazilian bombshell herself:

604
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:55,784
The incomparable Carmen Miranda.

That feeling you feel

01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:33,923
Hey, Ma

620
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:37,635
It seems we've stood and talked

621
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:43,808
Like this before

622
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:47,145
REYNOLDS: One ofthe performers at MGM
whom I admired the most...

623
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,981
...was the legendary Lena Horne.

624
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:55,236
[SINGING]
But I can't remember where

625
01:07:55,404 --> 01:08:00,200
Or when

626
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:06,164
Some things that happen

627
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:12,837
For the first time

628
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:21,346
[SINGING]
Seem to be happening again

629
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:25,975
It was a long time ago
I stood in this very spot...

630
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:29,354
...and recorded that lovely song.

631
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:34,526
When I first walked onto
this recording stage in 1942...

632
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:37,862
...it looked pretty much as it does today.

633
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:41,074
Although the technology
was prehistoric...

634
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:44,577
...compared to what we use today.

635
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:48,039
I recorded all of the music
for my movies here...

636
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:54,212
...and it is still considered
Hollywood's greatest recording stage.

637
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:58,633
I have many memories here...

638
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,219
...good and bad.

639
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:05,181
I never felt like I really belonged
in Hollywood.

640
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:09,936
At that time, they didn't quite know
what to do with me, a black performer.

641
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:15,024
So I usually just came on,
sang a song and made a quick exit.

642
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:19,279
[SINGING]
It was just one of those things

643
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,992
Just one of those crazy things

644
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,913
HORNE: This was true of my first film
in the studio, Panama Hattie.

645
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:33,668
Yeah, I got to sing a great Cole Porter tune
in a featured appearance...

646
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:38,298
...but what I really wanted was to be given
an acting role in the movies.

647
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:41,259
Just one of those fabulous flights

648
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:46,222
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings

649
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:49,559
Just one of those things

650
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:53,563
If we thought a bit of the end of it

651
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:58,109
Before we started painting the town

652
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:02,280
We'd have been aware
That our love affair

653
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:06,910
Was too hot not to cool down

654
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:11,998
So goodbye, dear, and Amen

655
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:16,336
Here's hoping we meet now and then

656
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:20,965
It was great fun

657
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:24,344
But it was just

658
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:30,225
One of those things

659
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:38,816
Said that gal, Du Barry

660
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:41,027
"Ain't it the truth?"

661
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:44,572
HORNE:
In 1943, I got to play a part.

662
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,533
Georgia Brown in Cabin in the Sky.

663
01:10:47,701 --> 01:10:51,871
And this good song, "Ain't It the Truth,"
was cut from the movie...

664
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:55,416
...because studio bosses
thought it too risqu...

665
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:59,170
...to show a black girl in a bubble bath.

666
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:02,924
[SINGING]
Love is a ripplin' brook

667
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,969
Man is a fish to cook

668
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:08,972
You got to bait your hook

669
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:11,724
Rise and shine

670
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:16,813
And cast your line

671
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:21,526
You got to get your possum

672
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,820
Ain't it the truth?

673
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:27,573
While you still in blossom

674
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:29,867
Ain't it the truth?

675
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:33,204
Cleopatra and Delilah

676
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:36,457
Had it way over Ruth

677
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:41,045
Them gals did mighty swell

678
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:44,132
They sure did ring that bell

679
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:49,095
Ain't it the gospel truth?

680
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:52,223
It's the truth

681
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:55,310
The truth

682
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,937
It's the solid

683
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:06,112
Mellow truth

684
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:13,369
HORNE:
In 1946, I played the role of Julie...

685
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:18,082
...in an excerpt from Show Boat
in Till the Clouds Roll By.

686
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:23,880
I was being considered for the part
for the 1951 version of Show Boat...

687
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:28,176
...but the Production Code Office
had banned interracial romance...

688
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,053
...on the screen.

689
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:34,557
So the studio gave the part
to my good friend Ava Gardner.

690
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:37,560
And she was wonderful in it.

691
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:42,690
The studio had Ava rehearse
singing the role...

692
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:46,611
...to the recordings that I had made
hoping to get the part...

693
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,696
...which annoyed us both.

694
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:52,075
Anyway, she did a great job
on her own...

695
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:56,120
...but just before releasing the film,
the studio dubbed her...

696
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,623
...with Annette Warren's voice.

697
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:05,797
GARDNER [SINGING]:
Fish got to swim, birds got to fly

698
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:13,429
I got to love one man till I die

699
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:21,104
Can't help lovin' that man of mine

700
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:24,148
HORNE: This is what audiences
would have heard...

701
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:27,610
...if they had allowed Ava's voice
to be used.

702
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:35,785
GARDNER [SINGING]:
Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow

703
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:40,915
Tell me I'm crazy

704
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:45,420
Maybe I know

705
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:49,340
Can't help

706
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:57,849
Lovin' that man of mine

707
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:01,477
HORNE: Though Ava was
one of my few good friends...

708
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:06,065
...I was deeply disappointed
that I didn't get the part.

709
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:11,529
[SINGING]:
That's a rainy day

710
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:14,699
But when he comes back

711
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:22,206
That day is fine

712
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:31,632
The sun will shine

713
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:39,098
He can come home

714
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:44,103
As late as can be

715
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:49,192
Home without him

716
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:55,406
Ain't no home to me

717
01:14:56,283 --> 01:15:00,369
Can't help

718
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:05,291
Lovin' that man

719
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:14,550
Of mine

720
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,517
HORNE: I was not the only one
to lose a role here.

721
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:26,270
In Annie Get Your Gun,
Betty Hutton was a big hit...

722
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:28,648
...as Annie Oakley.

723
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:33,110
But Betty wasn't
the studio's first choice.

724
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:37,949
Judy Garland had begun filming the role
and completed two numbers...

725
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:41,869
...when she suffered a breakdown
and had to be replaced.

726
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:45,164
Retrieved at last
from the MGM film vaults...

727
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:49,418
...is Judy's version of
"I'm an Indian Too."

728
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:52,129
[INDIANS YELPING]

729
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:13,150
Am I an Indian yet?

730
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,154
Hoh!

731
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:19,240
[INDIANS CHEERING]

732
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:23,286
[INDIANS CHANTING]

733
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:38,301
[SINGING] Like the Chippewa
Iroquois, Omaha

734
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:40,845
Like those Indians

735
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:46,058
I'm an Indian too
A Sioux

736
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:49,020
A Sioux

737
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:54,525
Some Indian summer's day
Without a care

738
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:57,653
I may run away

739
01:16:57,821 --> 01:16:59,739
With Big Chief Sun-of-a-Bear

740
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:02,867
And I'll have totem poles

741
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,661
Tomahawk
Small papoose

742
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:10,458
Which will go to prove
I'm an Indian too

743
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,044
A Sioux

744
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:17,381
A Sioux
Oh, I'm an Indian, I'm an Indian

745
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:20,384
I'm an honest Injun Indian

746
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:28,559
I'm an Indian, too

747
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:31,979
Ow

748
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,565
Folks are dumb where I come from

749
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:37,234
They ain't had any learning

750
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:42,031
HORNE: This is the only other number
Judy shot forAnnie Get Your Gun.

751
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:46,952
As you can see, whatever conflicts
Judy struggled with as a person...

752
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,956
...she always came through
as an entertainer.

753
01:17:51,124 --> 01:17:53,709
GARLAND [SINGING]:
Still we've gone from A to Z

754
01:17:53,877 --> 01:17:58,881
Doin' what comes naturally

755
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:01,425
You don't have to know
How to read or write

756
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:04,345
When you're out with a feller
In the pale moonlight

757
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,764
You don't have to look
In a book to find

758
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:10,101
What he thinks of the moon
And what is on his mind

759
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:14,855
That comes naturally

760
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:20,111
My uncle out in Texas
Can't even write his name

761
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:22,822
He signs his checks with "x's"

762
01:18:22,989 --> 01:18:25,574
But they cash them just the same

763
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,285
Grandpa Dick was always sick

764
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:31,247
But never saw a doctor

765
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:33,999
He just died at 93

766
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:47,471
Doin' what comes naturally

767
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,728
The sleepless nights
The daily fights

768
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:56,272
The quick toboggan
When you reach the heights

769
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,774
I miss the kisses
And I miss the bites

770
01:18:58,942 --> 01:19:01,235
I wish I were in love again

771
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,696
HORNE:
Words and Music was the last time...

772
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:07,783
...that Judy and Mickey Rooney
worked together at MGM...

773
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:10,911
...ending the most popular
song and dance team...

774
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:12,663
...the studio would ever have.

775
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,540
GARLAND [SINGING]:
No more pain

776
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,792
No more strain

777
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:21,672
Now I'm sane
But I would rather be gaga

778
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,341
The pulled-out fur of cat and cur

779
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:26,719
The fine mismating of a him and her

780
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:31,849
We've learned our lesson
And we wish we were in love

781
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:37,521
Again

782
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,698
[APPLAUSE]

783
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:54,872
Judy Garland and I
grew up together at MGM...

784
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,709
...and completed high school
between long days of shooting.

785
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:01,378
Here on the lot
we made 10 pictures together...

786
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:03,380
...and even when
we worked separately...

787
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:07,343
...we turned to each other
for friendship and encouragement.

788
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:11,555
We were the very best of friends,
more like brother and sister.

789
01:20:11,723 --> 01:20:14,350
I still miss her very much.

790
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,894
Judy was 11 years old
when I first heard her sing...

791
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,939
...and I told her right off
what I felt then...

792
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:21,273
...and what I feel today.

793
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:26,070
I said to her,
"Darling, you're the best in the world."

794
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:31,867
ROONEY: By the time 15-year-old Judy
appeared in Everybody Sing...

795
01:20:32,035 --> 01:20:35,621
...she had already been on-stage
for more than a decade...

796
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:40,251
...billed as the little girl
with the great, big voice.

797
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:42,419
[SCATTING]

798
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:46,215
[SINGING]
Teach me how to sing

799
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:50,469
Music with a modern rhythm
Let me swing

800
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:53,889
Mr. Mendelssohn swing

801
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:56,976
Music is a thing

802
01:20:57,143 --> 01:20:59,687
That's no good without that rhythm

803
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:02,189
Sweet and hot
Fast and slow

804
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:04,483
So get yourself
A little dash of holy ho

805
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:09,196
And swing it
Mr. Mendelssohn swing it high

806
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,949
Hey, swing it low

807
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:17,454
[ALL SCATTING]

808
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:23,377
And swing it
Mr. Mendelssohn swing

809
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:28,549
I'm past the stage
Of doll and carriage

810
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:33,470
I'm not the age
To think of marriage

811
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:36,140
I'm too old for toys

812
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,934
And I'm too young for boys

813
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:43,063
I'm just an in-between

814
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:44,773
ROONEY:
In Love Finds Andy Hardy...

815
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:48,319
...Judy laments the fact
that she's not a little girl any longer...

816
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:51,113
...and not quite a grownup either.

817
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:53,407
GARLAND [SINGING]:
Grownups ignore me

818
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,492
And in every sense

819
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:58,662
I'm just on a fence

820
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:03,000
I'm just an in-between

821
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:06,003
ROONEY: For a few years,
Judy was an in-between.

822
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,422
Even though the critics
had compared her talent...

823
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,592
...to that of a teenage Sarah Bernhardt...

824
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,637
...the studio had to search
for just the right part...

825
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:18,307
...to showcase her grownup gifts.

826
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:27,733
They found it in her first starring role:

827
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:30,861
Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz.

828
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:34,156
When Judy stepped into
the Technicolor land of Oz...

829
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:39,536
...it mirrored her arrival as a major star.

830
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:47,628
Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.

831
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,880
We must be over the rainbow.

832
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:53,384
MUNCHKINS [SINGING]: Follow the yellow
Brick road follow the yellow brick road

833
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:56,512
Follow, follow, follow, follow
Follow the yellow brick road

834
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,768
Follow the yellow brick
Follow the yellow brick

835
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:04,436
Follow the yellow brick road

836
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:10,693
You're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

837
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:14,238
You'll find he is a Whiz of a Wiz
If ever a Wiz there was

838
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:17,992
If ever, oh ever, a Wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

839
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,245
Because, because, because
Because, because

840
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:23,247
Because of the wonderful things he does

841
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:26,709
ROONEY:
The Wizard of Oz was to become...

842
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:29,211
...the most widely seen
motion picture of all time...

843
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:31,797
...and Judy's wonderful performance
in the picture...

844
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:34,383
...earned her a special Academy Award...

845
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:37,761
...which I was lucky enough
to present to her.

846
01:23:38,221 --> 01:23:40,889
And, Judy, I hope you win
many more of them, honey.

847
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:42,057
Thank you.

848
01:23:42,225 --> 01:23:44,435
And how about doing us all
a little favor now...

849
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:48,147
...and singing "Over the Rainbow"?
Will you do that?

850
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,732
[APPLAUSE]

851
01:23:54,779 --> 01:24:00,743
[SINGING]
Somewhere over the rainbow

852
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:05,956
Blue birds fly

853
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:12,337
Birds fly over the rainbow

854
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:15,340
Why, then

855
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:21,972
Oh, why can't I?

856
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:29,271
I like New York in June, how about you?

857
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:36,737
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?

858
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:43,577
I love a fireside when a storm is due

859
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:47,790
I like potato chips
Moonlight and motor trips

860
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:51,293
How about you?

861
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:53,504
ROONEY: My favorite memories
of working with Judy...

862
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:56,423
...are when it was just the two of us
performing a simple...

863
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,425
...song and dance routine together...

864
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:02,638
...like this one from Babes on Broadway.

865
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:26,036
[SINGING]
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine

866
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:29,331
I'd love to see your name

867
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:31,917
Right beside mine

868
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:34,628
I can see we're in harmony

869
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,880
Looks like we both agree

870
01:25:37,048 --> 01:25:39,842
On what to do

871
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:48,016
And I like it, how about you?

872
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:51,270
Down on an island, the southern seas

873
01:25:51,437 --> 01:25:54,022
There lived a lassie named Minnie Breeze

874
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:58,694
And all the natives agree
That she's the hottest thing in Trinidad

875
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:02,614
ROONEY: Judy became one of the country's
top 10 box-office stars.

876
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:04,741
The little girl was growing up.

877
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:07,953
So the studio gave her
the full glamour treatment...

878
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:13,208
...in this Busby Berkeley extravaganza
from Ziegfeld Girl.

879
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:15,752
GARLAND [SINGING]:
They call her Minnie from Trinidad

880
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,175
They all love Minnie from Trinidad

881
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:26,346
And all the natives would be so sad

882
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:29,933
If Minnie ever left Trinidad

883
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:35,689
And all the natives would be so glad

884
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:38,650
If Minnie

885
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:44,615
Came back to Trinidad

886
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:10,098
For Minnie

887
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:16,688
Minnie

888
01:27:16,856 --> 01:27:24,863
Came back to Trinidad

889
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:34,373
Who, stole my heart away

890
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:38,335
Who, makes me dream all day

891
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:42,214
Dreams I know can never come true

892
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:46,218
Seems as though I'll ever be blue

893
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:50,055
Who, means my happiness

894
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:56,186
Who, would I answer yes to

895
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:59,773
Well, you ought to guess who

896
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:01,233
No one but you

897
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:05,279
ROONEY: By 1946, Judy was one
of the studio's most valuable assets...

898
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:08,365
...and made a special guest appearance
as Marilyn Miller...

899
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:13,704
...in the Jerome Kern biography,
Till the Clouds Roll By.

900

[SINGING]
March on, little doagies

901
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:05,922
March on, down the trail

902
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:09,801
ROONEY: One of Judy's biggest hits
was The Harvey Girls.

903
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:11,511
The film was so big, in fact...

904
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:14,890
...that there wasn't time
for this extraordinary production number...

905
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,350
...in the final film.

906
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:20,937
Here are Judy, Ray Bolger, Cyd Charisse,
and a cast of hundreds...

907
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:24,107
...in a never-before-seen
"March of the Doagies."

908
01:29:24,275 --> 01:29:27,444
GARLAND [SINGING]:
We don't know where we're goin'

909
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:32,032
But we're on our way

910
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:37,079
March on, little doagies

911
01:29:37,246 --> 01:29:41,083
March on, down the trail

912
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:45,462
March on, little doagies

913
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:49,883
Till we're past the last fence rail

914
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:54,346
Out there lies the prairie

915
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:58,975
Out there breaks the day

916
01:29:59,143 --> 01:30:02,604
Oh, we don't know where we're goin'

917
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:07,818
But we're on our way

918
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:12,280
- Me for a campfire out on the trail
- Me for an old cayuse

919
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:17,035
- Me for the sound of the coyote's wail
- And I'm all set to vamoose

920
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:21,706
- You for a pipe, when the evenin' is still
- You for your own backyard

921
01:30:22,041 --> 01:30:26,837
- I'll be the first fella over the hill
- Me for a campfire out on the trail

922
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:31,258
An old cayuse and a coyote's wail
With nothin' to do

923
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:35,846
And nobody asking me why
Give me a cowhand song

924
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:40,517
And I'll be gettin' along

925
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:44,229
March on along

926
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:48,859
March on
The doagies on the trail

927
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:50,902
Are marchin' on

928
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:55,532
Until the last grand swale

929
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:59,536
Out there lies the prairie

930
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:03,540
Out there breaks the day

931
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:06,835
Oh, we don't know where we're goin'

932
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:15,010
But we're on our way

933
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:23,435
ROONEY: In Summer Stock,
Judy was seen for the first time...

934
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:27,189
...wearing what was to become
her trademark for years to come.

935
01:31:27,356 --> 01:31:29,524
The top half of a tuxedo.

936
01:31:29,692 --> 01:31:32,903
Two years before, however,
she had worn the same outfit...

937
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:37,282
...in a scene removed from
the released version of Easter Parade.

938
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:41,661
Irving Berlin had based a song
on just a few notes...

939
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:44,372
...and called it "Mr. Monotony."

940
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:48,001
This is Judy at the top of her career.

941
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:52,088
GARLAND [SINGING]:
Playing on his slide trombone

942
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:55,926
In a certain monotone

943
01:31:56,093 --> 01:32:02,182
He was known as Mr. Monotony

944
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:07,771
Any pleasant interlude

945
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:11,691
That would mean a change of mood

946
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:18,448
Didn't go with Mr. Monotony

947
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:23,537
Sometimes he would change the key

948
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:27,457
But the same dull melody

949
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:34,631
Would emerge from Mr. Monotony

950
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:39,386
Folks for miles would run away

951
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:43,306
Only one preferred to stay

952
01:32:43,474 --> 01:32:46,601
She would come around and say

953
01:32:46,769 --> 01:32:51,523
"Have you got any monotony today?"

954
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:57,153
"Haven't got any monotony

955
01:32:57,321 --> 01:33:01,324
Today

956
01:33:01,492 --> 01:33:05,453
Can't play

957
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:09,791
Today

958
01:33:09,959 --> 01:33:17,007
Haven't got any monotony

959
01:33:17,174 --> 01:33:24,180
Today"

960
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,018
[APPLAUSE]

961
01:33:31,897 --> 01:33:38,194
It only happens when I dance with you

962
01:33:38,362 --> 01:33:42,616
ROONEY: Another legend at Metro
was my good friend Fred Astaire...

963
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:46,870
...who always romanced
a glamorous partner in his motion pictures.

964
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:50,332
In Easter Parade,
it was the one and only Ann Miller.

965
01:33:50,499 --> 01:33:52,709
ASTAIRE [SINGING]:
Seem quite so near

966
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:56,588
Why does it happen, dear

967
01:33:56,922 --> 01:34:00,550
Only with you?

968
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:09,517
Two cheeks together can be so divine

969
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:13,188
But only when those cheeks

970
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:16,900
Are yours and mine

971
01:34:17,568 --> 01:34:20,820
I've danced with dozens of others

972
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:24,741
The whole night through

973
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:28,328
But the thrill that comes with Spring

974
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:32,374
When anything could happen

975
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:38,421
That only happens with you

976
01:34:42,259 --> 01:34:45,053
It was at a rehearsal hall like this...

977
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:47,681
...that I spent my first days at MGM...

978
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:51,726
...preparing for the production numbers
in Easter Parade.

979
01:34:51,894 --> 01:34:56,022
Oh, and I was just scared stiff
because I was going to dance...

980
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:57,732
...with the master.

981
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:01,945
But Fred Astaire was as charming
off the screen as he was on...

982
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:04,155
...and he put me at ease right away.

983
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:07,534
Especially after I agreed to dance with him
in ballet slippers...

984
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:10,286
...so I wouldn't be taller than he was.

985
01:35:10,454 --> 01:35:14,624
Fred was a perfectionist.
After exhausting hours of rehearsal...

986
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:17,627
...when we all thought we had it just right,
he would say:

987
01:35:17,795 --> 01:35:21,131
"Come on, Annie,
let's do it one more time."

988
01:35:22,299 --> 01:35:26,636
What I wouldn't give
to do it just one more time again.

989
01:35:28,305 --> 01:35:30,515
Fred and his sister Adele
were already stars...

990
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:35,895
...in the New York and London theater
before he came to MGM in 1933.

991
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:38,982
Do you feel like going through
that number with Mr. Astaire?

992
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:40,358
- All right.
- Freddie.

993
01:35:40,526 --> 01:35:42,986
Show Miss Marlowe the routine
on that opening number.

994
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:44,779
- Good evening.
- Miss Marlowe.

995
01:35:44,947 --> 01:35:47,907
ASTAIRE: Do you know the routine?
- I've seen it often enough. I'll try.

996
01:35:48,075 --> 01:35:51,661
That's fine. Harry, give us the pickup
on that gang number, will you, please?

997
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:54,372
MILLER: It was a little more
than a guest appearance for Fred...

998
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:57,792
...for he was soon to be under
contract to RKO Pictures...

999
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:00,628
...where they were about to team him
with Ginger Rogers...

1000
01:36:00,796 --> 01:36:03,757
...causing a string of hit musicals
to follow.

1001
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:07,010
Fred didn't return to MGM
until seven years later...

1002
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:09,554
...at which time he starred
with Eleanor Powell...

1003
01:36:09,722 --> 01:36:12,932
...in Broadway Melody of 1940.

1004
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:51,197
MILLER: In 1945, Fred and a new partner,
Lucille Bremer...

1005
01:37:51,365 --> 01:37:54,617
...stepped out to "Coffee Time"
in Yolanda and the Thief.

1006
01:37:54,785 --> 01:37:58,288
Its director, Vincente Minnelli.

1007
01:38:33,949 --> 01:38:36,326
[APPLAUSE]

1008
01:38:37,286 --> 01:38:39,954
[SINGING]
That's for me

1009
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:45,251
I'm drum crazy, yes
I'm drum crazy, yes

1010
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:48,588
I'm plumb crazy for drums

1011
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:52,508
MILLER: Fred could make music
out of almost anything.

1012
01:38:52,676 --> 01:38:56,179
And he often found new challenges
that stretched his talents.

1013
01:38:56,347 --> 01:39:00,558
In Easter Parade, he uses drums
to make a melody.

1014
01:39:00,726 --> 01:39:02,685
ASTAIRE [SINGING]:
First, soft violins

1015
01:39:02,853 --> 01:39:05,521
Then, sweet saxophones

1016
01:39:05,689 --> 01:39:09,108
Then, blue clarinets croon

1017
01:39:09,526 --> 01:39:14,030
When it's my turn I turn into a loon

1018
01:39:14,406 --> 01:39:16,783
When the drum takes the melody

1019
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,869
When the drum carries the tune

1020
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:36,863
MILLER: Hard-boiled private eyes
were all the rage in the '50s.

1021
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:39,657
Perfect for the musical spoof,
"The Girl Hunt" ballet...

1022
01:40:39,825 --> 01:40:41,242
...from The Band Wagon.

1023
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:44,954
In it, Fred plays a tough detective
tracking down a killer.

1024
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:48,041
The femme fatale, Cyd Charisse.

1025
01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:51,461
ASTAIRE:
She came at me in sections.

1026
01:40:51,628 --> 01:40:55,173
More curves than a scenic railway.

1027
01:40:56,383 --> 01:40:59,218
She was bad. She was dangerous.

1028
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:02,388
I wouldn't trust her
any farther than I could throw her.

1029
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:07,018
She was selling hard,
but I wasn't buying.

1030
01:42:05,911 --> 01:42:10,081
MILLER: A team that had no equal
was Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

1031
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:13,292
In The Barkleys of Broadway,
they dance the "Swing Trot"...

1032
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:17,255
...under the main titles of the picture,
but with the titles removed...

1033
01:42:17,422 --> 01:42:19,549
...another musical gem is revealed...

1034
01:42:19,716 --> 01:42:22,385
...from the most beloved
dance team of all time.

1035
01:42:22,553 --> 01:42:25,012
CHORUS [SINGING]: And you're the greatest
Dancer in the land

1036
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:27,765
It's bill and coo-y, tea for two-y

1037
01:42:27,933 --> 01:42:30,184
Just watch your partner's
Eyes grow dewy

1038
01:42:30,352 --> 01:42:32,603
Entrenous-y you're slightly screwy

1039
01:42:32,771 --> 01:42:36,107
But irresistible
On and on

1040
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:41,112
Oh, what a natural they've hit upon
It gets you going till you're really gone

1041
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:43,906
And you will never rue the day

1042
01:42:44,074 --> 01:42:48,661
The day you realize
The Swing Trot is here to stay

1043
01:43:35,626 --> 01:43:37,460
[APPLAUSE]

1044
01:43:44,301 --> 01:43:47,762
MILLER: For The Belle of New York,
the studio decided to reshoot this scene...

1045
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:51,807
...because Fred's costume
didn't suit his famous dapper style.

1046
01:43:51,975 --> 01:43:55,519
So by putting the original
and the reshot versions together...

1047
01:43:55,687 --> 01:43:59,982
...it gives us a rare opportunity
to see just how perfectly rehearsed...

1048
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:01,359
...Fred really was.

1049
01:44:01,526 --> 01:44:08,324
ASTAIRE [SINGING]:
I wanna be a dancin' man while I can

1050
01:44:08,784 --> 01:44:14,622
Gonna leave my footsteps
On the sands of time

1051
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:18,834
If I never leave a dime

1052
01:44:19,711 --> 01:44:21,462
A dancin' man

1053
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:25,007
With footsteps
On the sands

1054
01:44:25,175 --> 01:44:26,801
Of rhythm

1055
01:44:28,887 --> 01:44:32,014
And rhyme

1056
01:45:16,852 --> 01:45:19,395
[APPLAUSE]

1057
01:45:22,899 --> 01:45:25,443
Anything you can do, I can do better

1058
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:28,070
I can do anything better than you

1059
01:45:28,655 --> 01:45:31,907
MILLER: Another one ofmy favorite
leading men was Howard Keel.

1060
01:45:32,075 --> 01:45:36,704
Best known for his rich baritone voice,
he had a very competitive romance...

1061
01:45:36,872 --> 01:45:39,040
...with Betty Hutton
in Annie Get Your Gun.

1062
01:45:39,207 --> 01:45:41,876
- No, you're not
- Yes, I am

1063
01:45:42,044 --> 01:45:44,754
- No, you're not
- Yes, I am, yes, I am

1064
01:45:45,255 --> 01:45:47,798
I can shoot a partridge
With a single cartridge

1065
01:45:47,966 --> 01:45:50,760
I can get a sparrow
With a bow and arrow

1066
01:45:50,927 --> 01:45:53,512
I can live on bread and cheese

1067
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,014
- And only on that?
- Yes

1068
01:45:55,182 --> 01:45:59,185
- So can a rat
- Any note you can reach, I can go higher

1069
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:02,313
- I can sing anything higher than you
- No, you can't

1070
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:09,362
- Yes, I can
- No, you can't

1071
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:15,951
Yes, I can

1072
01:46:17,537 --> 01:46:20,039
Anything you can wear, I can wear better

1073
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:22,375
In what you wear I'd look better than you

1074
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:23,751
- In my coat?
- In your vest

1075
01:46:23,919 --> 01:46:25,127
- In my shoes?
- In your hat

1076
01:46:25,295 --> 01:46:28,130
- No, you can't
- Yes, I can, yes, I can

1077
01:46:28,298 --> 01:46:30,800
Anything you can say, I can say faster

1078
01:46:30,967 --> 01:46:33,135
I can say anything faster than you

1079
01:46:33,303 --> 01:46:38,641
- No, you can't
- Yes, I can

1080
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:41,519
- I can jump a hurdle
- I can wear a girdle

1081
01:46:41,686 --> 01:46:44,271
- I can knit a sweater
- I can fill it better

1082
01:46:44,439 --> 01:46:46,816
I can do most anything

1083
01:46:46,983 --> 01:46:48,317
- Can you bake a pie?
- No

1084
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:49,652
Neither can I

1085
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:52,321
Any note you can sing
I can sing sweeter

1086
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:54,782
I can sing anything sweeter than you

1087
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:58,452
No, you can't

1088
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:00,621
Yes, I can

1089
01:47:00,789 --> 01:47:02,915
No, you can't

1090
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:08,421
- Yes, I can
- No, you can't

1091
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:11,507
- Yes, I can
- No, you can't, can't, can't

1092
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:15,678
Yes, I can, can, can

1093
01:47:16,179 --> 01:47:24,186
- No, you can't
- Yes, I can

1094
01:47:27,232 --> 01:47:31,986
This is the vault where thousands
upon thousands of MGM films are stored.

1095
01:47:32,154 --> 01:47:35,448
Their worth in dollars, film history,
entertainment...

1096
01:47:35,615 --> 01:47:37,616
...is immeasurable.

1097
01:47:37,784 --> 01:47:41,162
There are a few of these, of course,
in which I appeared.

1098
01:47:41,329 --> 01:47:43,456
This one, Rose Marie...

1099
01:47:43,623 --> 01:47:46,667
...was the first wide-screen,
CinemaScope musical.

1100
01:47:46,835 --> 01:47:51,005
Now, in the 1950s,
Hollywood went into a panic...

1101
01:47:51,173 --> 01:47:54,049
...that rivaled the advent
of talking pictures.

1102
01:47:54,217 --> 01:47:58,345
A monster had taken over
the movie-going public: Television.

1103
01:47:58,513 --> 01:48:01,390
So the movies
went into new technologies...

1104
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:04,185
...such as CinemaScope,
stereophonic sound...

1105
01:48:04,352 --> 01:48:06,896
...to try to recapture their audience.

1106
01:48:07,063 --> 01:48:10,649
[SINGING] Today to get the public
To attend a picture show

1107
01:48:10,817 --> 01:48:14,069
It's not enough to advertise
A famous star they know

1108
01:48:14,237 --> 01:48:17,114
If you want to get the crowds
To come around

1109
01:48:17,657 --> 01:48:20,117
You gotta have glorious Technicolor

1110
01:48:20,285 --> 01:48:24,538
Breathtaking Cinemascope and
Stereophonic sound

1111
01:48:24,706 --> 01:48:27,458
KEEL: In Silk Stockings,
Janis Paige and Fred Astaire...

1112
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:30,753
...spoof the necessary elements
to make a modern motion picture.

1113
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:32,213
PAIGE [SINGING]:
This lover boy's technique

1114
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:35,508
If you want to hear
Applauding hands resound

1115
01:48:35,675 --> 01:48:38,427
You gotta have glorious Technicolor

1116
01:48:38,595 --> 01:48:42,681
Breathtaking Cinemascope and
Stereophonic sound

1117
01:48:43,433 --> 01:48:46,769
The customers don't like to see
The groom embrace the bride

1118
01:48:46,937 --> 01:48:50,397
Unless her lips are scarlet
And her mouth is five feet wide

1119
01:48:50,565 --> 01:48:54,276
In glorious Technicolor
Breathtaking Cinemascope

1120
01:48:54,444 --> 01:48:56,612
Or Cinerama, VistaVision or

1121
01:48:56,780 --> 01:49:00,783
Superscope or Todd-AO and
Stereophonic sound

1122
01:49:01,451 --> 01:49:05,246
And Stereophonic sound

1123
01:49:07,123 --> 01:49:10,626
There was a time when dancing
Was so intimate and sleek

1124
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:14,088
A fella hugged his partner
As they'd cuddle cheek to cheek

1125
01:49:14,256 --> 01:49:17,174
Now he doesn't even know
If she's around

1126
01:49:17,342 --> 01:49:21,470
Because they're in glorious Technicolor
Breathtaking Cinemascope and

1127
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:25,474
Stereophonic sound

1128
01:49:25,642 --> 01:49:28,936
It's not enough today
To see a dancer at his ease

1129
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:32,314
He's got to throw his back out
And come sliding on his knees

1130
01:49:32,482 --> 01:49:36,360
He's gotta have glorious Russian ballet
Or modern ballet or English ballet or

1131
01:49:36,528 --> 01:49:40,155
Chinese ballet or Hindu ballet or
Bali ballet or any ballet

1132
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:43,450
And Stereophonic sound

1133
01:49:43,618 --> 01:49:47,371
And Stereophonic adds an extra tonic

1134
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:54,211
Stereophonic sound

1135
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:58,257
- Shakin' the blues away
- Away

1136
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:01,302
- Unhappy news away
- Away

1137
01:50:01,469 --> 01:50:03,554
If you were blue, it's easy to

1138
01:50:03,722 --> 01:50:07,099
Shake off your cares and troubles

1139
01:50:07,267 --> 01:50:10,686
KEEL: In 1955, the studio
cleverly combined the new technologies...

1140
01:50:10,854 --> 01:50:14,648
...with the old-fashioned backstage musical
and starred Doris Day...

1141
01:50:14,816 --> 01:50:18,110
...in the Oscar-winning hit
Love Me or Leave Me.

1142
01:50:18,278 --> 01:50:20,529
DAY [SINGING]:
Do like the voodoos do

1143
01:50:20,697 --> 01:50:23,866
Listen to a voodoo melody

1144
01:50:24,034 --> 01:50:28,454
They shake their bodies so
To and fro

1145
01:50:28,622 --> 01:50:31,206
With every shake
A lucky break

1146
01:50:31,374 --> 01:50:34,084
- Provin' that there's a way
- A way

1147
01:50:34,252 --> 01:50:37,046
- To chase your cares away
- Away

1148
01:50:37,213 --> 01:50:39,298
If you would lose your weary blues

1149
01:50:39,466 --> 01:50:42,134
Shake 'em away

1150
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:10,120
- Shakin' the blues away
- Away, away

1151
01:51:10,288 --> 01:51:12,831
- Unhappy news away
- Away, away

1152
01:51:12,999 --> 01:51:14,750
If you were blue, it's easy to

1153
01:51:14,918 --> 01:51:18,128
Shake off your cares and troubles

1154
01:51:18,296 --> 01:51:20,673
Tellin' the blues to go

1155
01:51:21,007 --> 01:51:23,467
They may refuse to go

1156
01:51:23,718 --> 01:51:27,888
But as a rule they'll go
If you'll shake 'em away

1157
01:51:28,056 --> 01:51:31,141
Do like the voodoos do

1158
01:51:31,309 --> 01:51:34,770
Listen to a voodoo melody

1159
01:51:34,938 --> 01:51:39,775
They shake their bodies so
To and fro

1160
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:45,531
With every shake
A lucky break

1161
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:48,075
- Provin' that there's a way
- A way

1162
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:50,661
- To chase your cares away
- Away

1163
01:51:50,829 --> 01:51:52,621
If you would lose your weary blues

1164
01:51:52,789 --> 01:51:54,039
Shake 'em away

1165
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:56,125
Shake those blues away

1166
01:51:56,292 --> 01:51:58,669
Gotta chase those cares away

1167
01:51:58,878 --> 01:52:00,629
Just to prove that there's a way

1168
01:52:00,797 --> 01:52:03,382
A way to shake, shake your blues

1169
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:10,556
Away

1170
01:52:11,057 --> 01:52:13,308
[APPLAUSE]

1171
01:52:14,269 --> 01:52:16,603
The warden threw a party
In the county jail

1172
01:52:16,771 --> 01:52:19,314
The prison band was there
And they began to wail

1173
01:52:19,774 --> 01:52:22,317
The band was jumpin'
And the joint began to swing

1174
01:52:22,485 --> 01:52:24,903
You should've heard
Those knocked-out jailbirds sing

1175
01:52:25,071 --> 01:52:26,196
Let's rock

1176
01:52:26,489 --> 01:52:28,532
KEEL:
Times were changing, and so was music.

1177
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:31,243
MGM began appealing
to a new generation of filmgoers...

1178
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:33,662
...with Elvis Presley
and the "Jailhouse Rock."

1179
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:36,081
ELVIS [SINGING]:
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

1180
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:39,501
Spider Murphy played
The tenor saxophone

1181
01:52:39,919 --> 01:52:42,588
Little Joe was blowin'
On the slide trombone

1182
01:52:42,839 --> 01:52:45,340
The drummer boy from Illinois
Went crash, boom, bang

1183
01:52:45,508 --> 01:52:47,968
The whole rhythm section
Was the Purple Gang

1184
01:52:48,136 --> 01:52:51,972
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock

1185
01:52:53,892 --> 01:52:56,268
Everybody in the whole cell block

1186
01:52:56,936 --> 01:52:59,188
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

1187
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:02,566
Number forty-seven said to number three:

1188
01:53:02,984 --> 01:53:05,444
"You're the cutest jailbird
I ever did see

1189
01:53:05,695 --> 01:53:08,155
I sure would be delighted
With your company

1190
01:53:08,698 --> 01:53:10,991
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock
With me"

1191
01:53:11,159 --> 01:53:12,159
Let's rock

1192
01:53:12,327 --> 01:53:13,327
Go, go, go

1193
01:53:13,495 --> 01:53:14,912
Everybody, let's rock

1194
01:53:15,079 --> 01:53:16,538
Lay it on me, daddy-o

1195
01:53:16,706 --> 01:53:19,041
Everybody in the whole cell block

1196
01:53:20,001 --> 01:53:24,588
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

1197
01:53:24,756 --> 01:53:25,756
Rock, rock, rock

1198
01:53:25,924 --> 01:53:27,424
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

1199
01:53:27,592 --> 01:53:28,801
Rock, rock, rock

1200
01:53:28,968 --> 01:53:30,302
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

1201
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:31,678
Rock, rock, rock

1202
01:53:37,852 --> 01:53:42,189
Gigi, am I a fool without a mind...

1203
01:53:42,357 --> 01:53:47,277
...or have I merely been
too blind to realize?

1204
01:53:47,487 --> 01:53:48,612
Oh, Gigi.

1205
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:49,905
KEEL:
In 1958...

1206
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:53,408
...the golden age of the MGM musical
came to a grand finale...

1207
01:53:53,576 --> 01:53:56,078
...with Lerner and Loewe's Gigi.

1208
01:53:56,246 --> 01:53:58,872
The film became
the studio's top box-office musical...

1209
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:03,043
...and won nine Academy Awards,
including one for this lovely song.

1210
01:54:03,211 --> 01:54:07,923
The film stars Louis Jourdan
and the lovely Leslie Caron.

1211
01:54:08,091 --> 01:54:09,633
JOURDAN [SINGING]:
Oh, no

1212
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:15,514
Overnight there's been
A breathless change

1213
01:54:15,682 --> 01:54:17,808
In you

1214
01:54:18,768 --> 01:54:23,063
Oh, Gigi
While you were trembling on the brink

1215
01:54:23,231 --> 01:54:27,818
Was I out yonder somewhere
Blinking at a star?

1216
01:54:29,112 --> 01:54:31,029
Oh, Gigi

1217
01:54:31,197 --> 01:54:34,074
Have I been standing up too close?

1218
01:54:34,242 --> 01:54:36,410
Or back too far?

1219
01:54:39,247 --> 01:54:43,792
When did your sparkle turn to fire?

1220
01:54:45,211 --> 01:54:49,298
And your warmth become desire?

1221
01:54:49,799 --> 01:54:52,718
Oh, what miracle

1222
01:54:52,886 --> 01:54:57,431
Has made you the way

1223
01:54:57,599 --> 01:55:00,309
You are?

1224
01:55:14,157 --> 01:55:16,617
What a time it was.

1225
01:55:16,784 --> 01:55:18,702
Life was simpler then.

1226
01:55:18,870 --> 01:55:21,079
And so was the movie business.

1227
01:55:21,247 --> 01:55:26,251
MGM's dream factory
created a rich, romantic...

1228
01:55:26,419 --> 01:55:28,712
...compelling world of illusion.

1229
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:32,007
And although we may not
see anything like it again...

1230
01:55:32,175 --> 01:55:34,384
...we're blessed with memories...

1231
01:55:34,552 --> 01:55:38,388
...and miles and miles of film.

1232
01:55:38,556 --> 01:55:41,099
In the words of Irving Berlin:

1233
01:55:41,267 --> 01:55:43,352
"The song is ended...

1234
01:55:43,519 --> 01:55:47,439
...but the melody lingers on."

1235
01:55:47,607 --> 01:55:50,359
PEOPLE [SINGING]:
A show that is really a show

1236
01:55:50,526 --> 01:55:54,029
Sends you out with a kind of a glow

1237
01:55:54,197 --> 01:55:58,116
And you say as you go on your way

1238
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,703
That's Entertainment

1239
01:56:02,205 --> 01:56:05,290
A song that is winging along

1240
01:56:05,458 --> 01:56:09,002
