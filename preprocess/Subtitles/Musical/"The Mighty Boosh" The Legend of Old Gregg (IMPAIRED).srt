00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,975
-All right.
-How did the gig go?

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,216
Oh, one of the best we've ever done, I reckon.

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,092
-Genius.
-Should have seen this guy.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,973
Throwing shapes left, right and centre.
Never seen its equal.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,729
Howard was on fire.
He was improvising like a mother bitch.

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,452
The crowd was going wild, Naboo.

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,299
At one point I got out a bassoon.
I've never even played one before.

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,370
-What's going on?
-It's probably just some kids mucking about.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,730
-HOWARD: Yeah.
-There's one of your flyers attached.

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,532
There was one or two people at the gig

16
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,379
who didn't quite get into the spirit of things,
wasn't there?

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,411
There's 500 people out there.

18
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,371
-Is there?
-You'd better get out of here.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,650
Okay, well, we'll see you in a couple of days.

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,213
You'd better make it a week.

(PEOPLE SHOUTING)

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,818
That was the worst gig in the history of music.

23
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,977
It wasn't that bad.
They just weren't ready for us, Vince.

24
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,770
Do you think we'll ever be allowed
back into the city?

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,175
Of course we will. We're pioneers.

26
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,689
Give them a bit of time to catch up
with what we're about,

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,969
then they'll welcome us back.

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,294
Have you seen this review?

29
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,049
Vince, we do not need the words
of reviewers to tell us what we're about.

30
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,098
Well, that's lucky,
'cause there's no words in this one.

31
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,859
It's just a picture of some sick
with our names underneath it.

32
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,050
They weren't ready
for what we were trying to do, Vince.

33
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,011
Let's just leave it there, let's move on.

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,928
Yeah, I wanted to ask you about that.
What exactly were you trying to do?

35
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,176
I was on fire, Vince, that's all you need to know.

36
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,849
On fire? You were leaping around
with a bassoon sellotaped to your head.

37
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,699
Yes, sir. That's the way I move.

38
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,129
When the hoodoo trance takes me,
that's the way I go.

39
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,296
-The hoodoo trance?
-Yeah, I was out there.

40
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,058
You looked like a jazz dalek.

41
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,330
I didn't know what I was doing, but it felt good.

42
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,735
Well, I don't know what it was either,
but I saw the crowd.

43
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,851
It was freaking people out.

44
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,699
A little too sexual perhaps. A little too sensual.

45
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,051
I've heard that before,
that my moves can be a bit too ripe for some.

46
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,570
Too ripe? It was like a supply teacher
at a drum and bass convention.

47
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,735
What?

48
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,693
I don't know how to tell you this, Howard,
but you're a bit white.

49
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,338

-Good evening, squire.
-What do you want?

53
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,296
I'll have a Flirtini, please.

54
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,214
What?

55
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,015
It's a kind of champagne cocktail
with pineapple in it and a little twist of lime.

56
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,971
You London types.

57
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,934
Coming up here with your balls all shiny.
Think you own the place.

58
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,739
Well, you don't own this place. Jeff does.

59
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,055
There'll be no Flirtinis here.

60
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,889
You'll drink what Jeff drinks,
a simple, honest fisherman's drink.

61
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,091
Great, we'll have a couple of those then, thanks.

62
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,699
Two maggot ciders.

63

-I'm a little bit peckish. Have you got any olives?
-No.

-Hummus?
-No.

65

-Stuffed vine leaves?
-No.

66
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,657
-Do you have any crudités at all?
-You'll eat what Jeff eats.

67
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,374
A simple curry with
a couple of naan bread on the side.

68
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,819
-Garlic naan?
-Aye.

69
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,896
Great. Well, we'll be over here.

70
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,612
Two maggot bhunas.

71
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,053
It's a bit weird in here, isn't it?

72
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,093
Not weird. Just different.

73
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,451
You know, you got to get used to it.
You've got to lose your city eyes and adapt.

This place could be good for us, you know.

75

Get out of town, recharge our batteries,

76
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,540
have some new ideas,
maybe even write a couple of new songs, eh?

77
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,052
Pardon me, I couldn't help overhearing.
You two creative types?

78

We're in a band. Who are you?

-I'm Ramsey.
-Ramsey. Howard Moon.

80

I love your hair. What's that about?

81
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,971
It's your basic backcombed structure.

82
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,409
Slightly root boosted framing a cheeky fringe.

83

-Ramsey.
-What do you do?

87
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,737
I'm a local artist.

88
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,579
I put shells on things. You know, like cups

89
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,691
and telephone books,

90
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,458
and shoes.

91
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,889
-Cool.
-There's not too much money in it, though.

92
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,409
-Really?
-So what are you two doing out here?

93
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,735
Well, we hit a bit of a creative block there,
back in London,

94
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,772
so we thought we'd take a break
from the music scene and head out here.

95
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,174
Chill out, you know, kick back.

96
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,336
Whenever I hit a creative drought,

97
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,735
I go fishing out on Black Lake.

98
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,533
-Yeah?
-Yeah, with the wind in your hair

99
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,414
and the water flowing. It's perfect for inspiration.

100
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,100
That sounds great. We could do that tomorrow.

101
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,008
Let me let you in on a little secret. Gather round.

102
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,051
Not you, naan bread.

103
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,536
The best time to go out on Black Lake
is right now.

You and your lady friend can have
a special time together.

106
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,978
I'll even give you a discount. €40.

107
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,328
It's a deal.

108
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,011
The boat's tied outside on the jetty.
Listen, I've got to go, the wife's here.

(INHALING DEEPLY)

113
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,977
I think that Ramsey guy was right, you know.
I'm feeling myself unwind out here.

114
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,534
Feeling my batteries start to recharge.

115
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,969
Yeah, I love fishing.

116
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,576
Don't get your expectations up though, Vince.

117
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,215
It took me three months of solid fishing
before I even caught my first fish.

118
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,729
It's all about relaxing and letting go.

119
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,536
Sorry, what were you saying?

120
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,572
It's about patience, you know,
and getting into that Zen state,

121
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,214
wherein, the catching of a fish is unimportant.

Are you sure you've never been fishing before?

124
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,371
No, it's great. It's really easy.

125
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,410
-What are you using as bait?
-Well, I was using these signed press shots.

126
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,690
But, you know, I've given up on bait now.

127
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,890
It's ridiculous,
they're just throwing themselves at me.

And you.

130
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,809
The thing you don't understand about fishing,
Vince, right...

131
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,612
is it's not actually about catching fish.

132
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,776
-I think it is.
-That's a common mistake.

133
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,697
It's about everything else except that.

That's not fishing, that's just thinking about stuff.

Yeah, well, anyone can catch a fish, Vince.

-No, I haven't.

-I don't want one of yours.

don't you?

156
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,060
-Why?
-You know the old fisherman saying.

157
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,977
If you're too white, the fish don't bite.

158
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,613
Listen, Morgan Freeman,

159
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,174
why don't you head back to dry land
and leave me some fish to catch.

160
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,131
Oh, yeah, what, am I going to walk on water?

161
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,459
Emergency dinghy.

162
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,649
Fine, I will.

163
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,172
Oh, I've gone into the future.

164
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,052
Ain't there a foot pump in here?

165
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,932
Oh, yeah, here it is.

166
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,216
Oh, thanks a lot.

167
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,451
# I'd rather kiss a fish, a fish, a fish

168
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,218
# Than a fisherman's wife

169
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,570
# I'd rather kiss a fish, a fish, a fish

170
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,531
# Than a fisherman's wife

171
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,651
# I'd rather get off with a clam tonight

172
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,736
# Than get off with a fisherman's wife

173
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,771
# I'd rather get off with a clam tonight

174
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,415
# And be happy for the rest of my life #

175
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,250
-Hello, Vince.
-All right.

176
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,974
-You catch all them yourself, boy?
-Yeah.

177
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,695
A true fisherman. See, fellas?

178
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,976
A toast to the young man.

179
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,819
Flirtinis all round.

180
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,489
# He caught a fish upon the lake

181
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,657
# And came into this pub #

182
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,169
They improvise all that, you know, Vince.

183
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,973
-Really?
-Come sit yourself down, boy.

184
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,899
What's your name, boy boy?

185
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,214
-Vince.
-Vince?

186
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,978
Good strong fisherman's name.

187
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,818
Vince is Icelandic for hook, you know.

188
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,089
-Really?
-Aye.

189
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,256
-There's your Flirtini.
-Oh, cheers, mate.

190
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,018
-Pipe?
-Yeah, why not?

191
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,210
-Beard?
-I'm fine, thanks.

192
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,012
-Colin.
-Lucien.

193
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,291
How did you come by these fish then,
boy, sonny Jim, laddie, boy?

194
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,332
Oh, you know, just dangled my rod
over the edge of the boat and just....

195
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,371
No, no, no, no, no.

196
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,459
You got to set the scene, spin the yarn.
That's what fishing's about.

197
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,572
It isn't about fishing,
we ain't been fishing for years now.

198
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,168
Old Neville over there, he's never been fishing.

199
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,817
It's about telling the tales.

200
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,091
Oh, I get you. Right, watch this.

201
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,053
It was a dark night.

202
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,253
# It was a dark night #

203
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,018
Aye, that's more like it, son.

204
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,698
And the moon was full.

205
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,257
# The moon was full #

206
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,450
Ha-ha! I'm feeling rigid.

207
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,736
I was out on Black Lake.

208
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,731
(URINE FLOWING)

209
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,617
What did you say, boy?

210
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,689
Black Lake.

211
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,339
(URINE FLOWING)

212
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,655
Just going to go...change the barrel.

213
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,252
You should never go out on Black Lake
when the moon be full.

214
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,655
-Why?
-Because there's something out there.

215
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,693
Something evil.

216
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,779
Something that goes by the name of Old Gregg.

217
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,251
-Who?
-Old Gregg.

218
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,816
Legendary fish. Some say he's half man, half fish.

219
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,249
Other's say it's more of a 70-30 split.

220
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,178
Whatever the percentage, he's one fishy bastard.

221
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,976
Some say he's a ghost.
Can't catch what don't exist.

222
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,297
Hook goes right through him.

223
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,140
Some say he's acquired the taste of human meat.

224
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,251
Won't respond to conventional bait.

225
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,213
Only way to hook him is to use a child's toe.

226
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,536
Some say Old Gregg is like a big fishfinger,

227
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,776
but big like...

228
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,733
like a garage, as big as a garage.

229
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,019
Imagine a fishfinger
when you can see it as big as a garage.

230
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,412
Ooh! It's enorm, it's a big one, like that.

231
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,178
Ah! I've got something.

232
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,779
I've got something!

233
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,936
Come to Papa Moon.

234
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,937
That's it, come on.

235
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,778
(GRUNTING)

236
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,339
(JOLTING)

237
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,453
(WATER LAPPING)

238
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,094
Hi, there.

239
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,850
-Who are you?
-I'm Old Gregg.

240
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,652
Pleased to meet you.

241
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,008
What do you want?

242
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,256
Maybe I should ask you the same question.

243
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,018
What you doing in my waters?

244
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,689
Just taking the air, you know. Not fishing.

245
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,455
Well, then how come this hook's in my head, fool?

246
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,899
It's nothing to do with me, sir.

247
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,170
It's attached to your rod, mother licker.

248
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,814
Don't kill me, I've got so much to give.

249
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,771
Easy now, fuzzy little man peach.

250
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,290
You ever drunk Baileys from a shoe?

251
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,455
What?

252
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,889
Do you want to come to a club
where people wee on each other?

253
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,532
-No.
-I'm going to hurt you.

254
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,332
-Excuse me?
-I like you. What do you think of me?

255
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,729
-I don't rightly know, sir.
-Make an assessment.

256
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,939
I think you're a nice, modern gentleman.

257
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,449
-Don't lie to me, boy.
-I'm not lying.

258
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,059
I know what you're thinking.

259
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,377
Here comes Old Gregg, he's a scaly man-fish.

260
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,253
You don't know me. You don't know what I got.

261
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,417
I got something to show you.
You know what that is?

262
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,531
That's Old Gregg's vagina.

263
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,936
I got a mangina.

264
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,976
(ECHOING) I'm Old Gregg!

265
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,330
I found this washed up on the shore.

266
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,609
That's Howard's hat.

267
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,732
There's no mistaking this.
This is the work of Old Gregg.

268
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,420
-How do you know?
-He left his business card.

269
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,973
Do you think he'll be all right?

270
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,570
Well, I'll let the boys explain that
in the form of a song.

271
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,296
# He's dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead

272
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,609
# Dead #

273
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,369
Only one man survived an encounter
with Old Gregg and lived to tell the tale.

274
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,092
And that's Mr Hopkins over there.

275
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,257
-Well, I'm going to go and ask him about it.
-You're welcome to try.

276
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,053
Excuse me, when you actually met Old Gregg,
what was that like?

277
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,215
This is useless,
I'm going to have to sort this out myself.

278
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,259
(PHONE RINGING)

279
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,290
Got a bad feeling about this.

280
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,812
Pass it here.

281
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,738
-Hello.
-VINCE: Hey, Naboo, how are you?

282
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,330
-What do you want?
-Nothing. Just thought I'd phone up for a chat.

283
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,974
It's been great, we've been fishing.
I caught loads, yeah.

284
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,056
Met some interesting local types.

285
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,091
Oh, it's been a right laugh.

286
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,769
-So what do you want?
-Nothing. I just thought I'd phone up,

287
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,219
you know, a little catch up.

288
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,693
-Nothing else?
-No.

289
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,776
-All right, I'll see you later, then.
-Naboo.

290
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,936
There was just one small thing.

291
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,852
Here we go.

292
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,653
Howard might have been abducted
by a sea monster.

293
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,935
I don't believe this.

294
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,528
-You couldn't help us out, could you?
-All right.

295
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,049
Look, stay where you are,
I'll be there in about half an hour.

296
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,171
Oh, cheers, Naboo, you're a diamond.

297
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,253
Bollo, get the submarine out of the loft, will you?

298
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,776
Underneath the Christmas tree.

299
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,813
What's happening?

300
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,970
(ECHOING) I'm Old Gregg.

301
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,135
What?

302
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,453
I'm Old Gregg.

303
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,658
Where am I?

304
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,974
Gregg's place.

305
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,497
You've been asleep. Do you want a little drinkie?

306
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,973
I'll get you a drink.

307
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,939
(SPLASHING)

308
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,134
Do you like Baileys? Hm, creamy.

309
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,296
It's all c-cream and beige.

310
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,374
Delicious.

311
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,138
Do you like Old Gregg's place?

312
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,336
I got all things that are good.

313
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,697
You've done some nice things with it.

314
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,818
It's got this. This is good.

315
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,211
-That's nice.
-You can have it.

316
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,054
I'm fine, thanks.

317
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,613
I'll keep it here for you.

318
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,056
Well, is this the way out?

319
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,094
Erm...I better be scooting.

320
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,332
-Hm?
-Got meetings,

321
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,418
and a friend of mine's waiting for me
so perhaps I should be....

322
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,849
Why are you going?
We got everything we need here.

323
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,132
We got Baileys, creamy, and everything we need.

324
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,376
-I'll get you another Baileys.
-I'm fine.

325
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,811
-Thanks.
-I do watercolours.

326
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,135
-Do you?
-Let me show you something.

327
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,296
I call that one Old Gregg.

328
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,612
I did and that one, I call that one Old Gregg.

329
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,412
And this one, do you know what I call that one?

330
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,894
-Old Gregg?
-Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

331
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,768
I got some more. I got these two.
That one's Baileys.

332
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,734
And that one's Baileys, but a bit bigger.

333
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,619
And that one's as close as you can get
to Baileys without your eyes getting wet.

334
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,568
Hm, that is quite a portfolio
you've got going on there.

335
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,168
But I really should be heading off,
so it's been good.

336
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,768
We could do some watercolours together.
You and I.

337
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,812
Well, that sounds like great fun.
Let's do it in the week then, Gregg.

338
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,089
What do you mean?

339
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,690
-Well, are you free Thursday at all?
-Why can't we do it now?

340
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,617
Well, you know, I'm a busy man, Gregg.

341
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,732
You know, I've got things to do.
Howard Moon, man about town.

342
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,339
Do you love me?

343
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,219
Oh, dear.

344
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,739
Do you love me?

345
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,693
Umm...

346
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,729
going to have to pretend I didn't hear that, Gregg.

347
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,532
Do you think you could ever love me?

348
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,696
It doesn't really work like that, Gregg.

349
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,170
How does it work? Tell me how it works.

350
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,812
Well, you get to know someone,
you hang out, you...

351
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,973
see where that goes, this, that, the other.

352
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,853
Eventually, you know....
I don't know you.

353
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,097
You know me. What about the boat times?

354
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,654
That wasn't really a time, was it, Gregg?

355
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,090
That was more of just an exposure.

356
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,297
That was our first date, hm?

357
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,615
You pulled me up with your strong arms.

358
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,651
Oh, dear. Look, Gregg, I don't know you.

359
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,499
Oh, you know me, you seen my downstairs mix-up.

360
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,258
Yeah. I didn't ask to see that, did I?

361
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,938
What did it mean to you to see that?

362
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,937
-Did it mean you love me?
-No, it didn't.

363
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,699
-Could you learn to love me?
-No, I couldn't. I don't love you.

364
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,139
-You do love me.
-No, I don't.

365
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,648
-You do love me.
-No, I don't.

366
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,568
You love me and you've seen me
and you know me. I'm Old Gregg.

367
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,009
Yeah, I know you are.
You've told me 89 times now.

368
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,051
You must love me exactly as I love you.

369
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,889
Well, I don't love you. And to be honest,
you're starting to get on my nerves a bit now.

370
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,978
If anything, I find you slightly pathetic.
So deal with that.

371
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,132
Maybe I will deal with it.

372
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,457
Maybe I'll deal with it
the way I dealt with Curly Jefferson.

373
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,416
You know what, Gregg, maybe I was being
a bit hasty there when I said I didn't love you.

374
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,014
Perhaps now, in this light,
with you in the tutu and the...

375
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,170
water playing off your seaweed.

376
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,538
Maybe I could love you.

377
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,290
Maybe I was lying because when
you do love someone, sometimes you...

378
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,453
say you don't because you're playing hard to get,

379
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,053
-playing a game.
-Games?

380
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,774
-Yeah, I was just playing a game with you.
-Love games?

381
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,453
That's right, love games, Gregg.

382
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,339
Love games?

383
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,373
# Do you love me?

384
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,298
# Are you playing your love games with me?

385
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,498
# I just wanna know what to do
'cause I need your love a lot

386
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,655
# Oh, come on now

387
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,815
# Do you love me?

388
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,659
# Are you playing your love games with me?

389
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,979
# I just wanna know what to do
'cause I need your love a lot

390
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,215
# Oh, come on now

391
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,410
# Moving too fast, this isn't a race, hmm

392
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,531
# Baby back off and lower the pace now

393
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,696
# Slow it down and give me some space

394
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,572
# Moving too fast, this isn't a race

395
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,339
# Do you love me?

396
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,054
# Are you playing your love games with me?

397
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,658
# I just wanna know what to do
'cause I need your love a lot

398
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,815
# Come on now

399
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,896
# Moving too fast, this isn't a race, hmm

400
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,011
# Will you back off and lower the pace now?

401
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,131
# Slow it down and give me some space

402
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,216
# Moving too fast, this isn't a race

403
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,854
# I'm Old Gregg
# I know, I think you said

404
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,893
# Come on, don't make me beg now
'cause I'm not your regular guy

405
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,411
# Don't be shy
Do you love me? #

406
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,093
(BEEPING)

407
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,335
Can you open a window? I can't breathe in here.

408
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,018
It's a submarine, you idiot.

409
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,335
How are we ever going to find
this underwater sea cave?

410
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,213
-Look, don't worry. Captain Bollo's on the case.
-Is he?

411
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,932
You getting any readings, Bollo?

412
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,652
(MUMBLING)

413
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,099
He's playing Pac-Man.

414
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,257
I'll sort this out. What you doing, Bollo?

415
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,531
-Oh, shift over, I'm good at this bit.
-Get the apple, get the apple.

416
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,173
The ghost is in the way.

417
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,337
Hello? We're supposed to be rescuing Howard.
Go back for the cherry.

418
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,734
Go back for the cherries.

419
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,889
Well, you've put on a nice spread, Gregg.

420
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,409
-I did home economics.
-Really.

421
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,019
I got an A plus. I did a crumble.

422
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,971
The teacher said mine was the best one.

423
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,696
Well, I'm very pleased for you.

424
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,692
You don't look happy, Howard.

425
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,693
You're picking up on that, are you?

426
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,854
I could make you happy, Howard,
if only you'd let me.

427
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,940
-Oh, not another watercolour.
-You a musician, yeah?

428
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,255
-Yes, I am.
-But you ain't very good, are you?

429
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,098
I'm one of the best in town.

430
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,018
Come on, I read your reviews.
You know what your problem is?

431
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,017
-What?
-You ain't got the funk.

432
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,779
You're all rigid. You're like a bread stick.

433
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,253
You've got no rhythm.

434
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,416
Yeah, I've heard all this sort of stuff before,
thank you.

435
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,735
Well, maybe I can help you. I got the funk.

436
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,612
Yeah, I know, you're very funky, Gregg.

437
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,971
No, no, you don't understand.
I mean, I got the funk, right here.

438
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,178
It's in this box.

439
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,895
You see, the funk is a living creature,
about the size of a medicine ball,

440
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,055
but covered in teats.

441
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,454
(PURRING)

442
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,129
Came from another planet
and landed on Bootsy Collins' house.

443
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,170
Back then Bootsy was a simple farmer,

444
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,009
but he took one look at all those
mauve titties and he lost his mind.

445
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,619
He began to milk the funk.

446
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,459
BOOTSY: Shit, this ball
producing some sweet cream.

447
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,372
GREGG: Made himself a funk shake.

448
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,297
Praise the Lord.

449
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,049
GREGG: He began to feel fizzy inside.
He found he could see round corners.

450
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,659
What the....

451
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,771
Suddenly, he passed out.

452
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,455
But when he came to, baby,
he was slapping the bass guitar fast and loose

453
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,253
like some kind of delirious funky priest.

454
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,813
BOOTSY: Oh, yeah.

455
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,455
Two months later,
he was world famous with his band Parliament

456
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,696
and everybody wanted a piece of the funk.

457
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,573
Rick Wakeman, even the Bee Gees.

458
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,850
BEE GEES: # Oh, give me that funky milk #

459
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,411
One day, Parliament were travelling on
the mother ship, fooling around with the funk...

460
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,734
Pass it over.

461
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,249
...when George Clinton
kicked the funk clean overboard.

462
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,415
Ow!

463
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,529
Oh, man!

464
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,492
That was july the second, 1 9 79.

465
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,458
The day the funk died.

466
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,338
Two weeks later,
I found the funk in bed with a conger eel.

467
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,291
Oh, I've been rumbled.

468
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,730
At first, I thought it was a sea anemone,
but under closer inspection,

469
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,176
I realised it was a funky ball of tits
from outer space.

470
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,648
I offered to take him back to Parliament,
but he said he was done with that shit

471
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,137
and that they never listened to him anyway
and were only interested in his funky produce.

472
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,854
So I let him live down here with me in this cave.

473
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,699
That was a nice story, Gregg.

474
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,811
What's it got to do with
making me happy, exactly?

475
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,896
I've got a proposition for you.

476
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,217
We could take the funk,
make ourselves some tasty shakes.

477
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,492
Travel the world in a band. We'd become famous.
We'd be the family funk.

478
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,134
What? And we can get out on dry land
and get out of this place?

479
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,410
-Yes, sir.
-Well, let's do it. Let's move, come on.

480
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,172
-Okay.
-Let's do it.

481
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,211
-Just one condition.
-What?

482
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,649
That you take my sweet hand in marriage.

483
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,169
-Oh, God.
-Think about it, Howard.

484
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,736
Funky freedom for marriage.
You get what you want,

485
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,896
Old Gregg gets what he wants.

486
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,330
A strong man to hold me at night
when it's raining outside.

487
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,813
We can get out of this cave forever?

488
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,817
You bet your life. Do you accept?

489
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,969
I do.

490
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,931
Great. You've made me very happy.

491
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,893
Old Gregg's going to pick himself out
a nice wedding dress.

492
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,333
That's right, crack open a fresh Baileys.
I'm Old Gregg.

493
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,012
(PURRING)

494
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,615
Howard!

495
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,254
(PURRING)

496
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,855
Hey, Howard!

497
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,540
-Oh, thank God!
-Quick, get in.

498
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,008
Just a minute.

499
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,172
HOWARD: Naboo,
I didn't know you had one of these.

500
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,535
-Yeah, I got it second-hand.
-Nice.

501
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,453
What's in that box?

502
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,652
This, my friend, is something
that's going to put us back on the musical map.

503
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,498
Right, full steam ahead.

504
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,779
# We got the funk

505
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,930
# We've got that underwater funk

506
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,818

507
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,096
# Forget the P-Funk, we got the sea funk

508
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,175
# Funk

509
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,409
# Funk

510
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,569
# Funk

511
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,016
# We got the funk

512
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,449

# We've got the funk

518
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,215
(SCREAMING)

519
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,409
# ...we've got the sea funk

# Forget the P-Funk, we've got the sea funk #

528
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,696
-Pretty good gig, eh?
-Yeah.

529
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,176
-We're going to bring the funk back to London.
-Nothing can stop us now.

530
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,456
I'm Old Gregg!

531
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,491
I've got a mangina.

532
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,736
