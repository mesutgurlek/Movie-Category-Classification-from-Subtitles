00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,077
where the sun always rises
and the sun always sets.

159
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,713
- That's very deep.
- Elliott...

160
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,195
It's a place of serenity
and security,

161
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,995
where the unexpected
never happens.

- Ow!
- [Elliott Grumbles, Growls]

163
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,998
- It's okay, Elliott.
- [Astonished Mumbling]

164
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,951
It seems to say,
"Welcome!"

165
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,992
You-You absolute oaf.

166
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,873
You-You idiot!

167
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,719
- No, come, come.
- Look, it was that kid that pushed me.

168
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,274
He pulled off
Miss Taylor's petticoat.

169
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,154
- He walked through my cement
with his big feet.
- He scared my horse, Victoria.

170
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,555
Let's get out
of here, Elliott.

171
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,559
- We-Well, where is this person?
- Th-There he goes!

172
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,638
- Well, detain him. Detain him.

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,473
- You spoiled everything.
- [Gibberish]

176
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,160
Darn you, Elliott.

177
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,956
I told you to behave.

And...

182
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,792
Oh, hello there,
little boy.

183
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,708
- Hi.
- [Sniffing]

184

- Hi.
- [Puzzled Gibberish]

- Hey! Hey, you look terrible.
- Whoopee!

Hey, your friend's...
turned green.

187
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,794
- [Gibberish]
- If I didn't know any better,

188
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,195
I'd say he was a dragon.

189
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,279
- A drag-drag...
- [Growls]

190
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,429
Dragon!

Oh! Gentlemen...

195
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,595
A dragon, a dragon
I swear I saw a dragon

196
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,757
A green and seething
fire-breathing monster is in sight

197
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,156
With eyes of red a lion's head
and wings as dark as night

198
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,750
Oh, he has a jaw of gleaming teeth
He's 50 feet in height

199
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,236
It's true, it's true
Oh, what are we to do

200
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,670
It's true, it's true
He'll break us all in two

201
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,032
Oh, he's comin' in
His great big fin
is right against the door

202
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,799
So board up all the windows

203
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,833
And get down on the floor

204
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,997
Has anybody seen my dad?

205
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,954
Nora, please,
my child, come in.

206
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,435
- Get off that street.
- What's the matter?

207
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,393
- Worst thing I ever saw
in my life out on the street.
- What was it?

208
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,069
- I don't want to tell you for
fear it'll scare you to death!
- Scare me.

209
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,795
A dragon, a dragon
I swear I saw a dragon

210
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,595
His tail lashing, he'll be
smashing every shop in town

211
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,871
With scaly feet he'll crack the street
and tear the steeple down

212
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,549
It's not some loony dream
I heard a scream from Sheriff Brown

213
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,877
It's true, it's true
Oh, what are we to do

ever was, there never was

221

224
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,271
- Now, why don't you just calm down?
- I seen his face.

225
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,436
If you wanna
call it a face.

226
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,676
It was this close to me.

227
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,030
Why don't you
lie down, Dad? Come on.

228
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,632
You know what else?
It started to smile at me.

229
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,153
- Well, did you smile back?
- I didn't have time to smile.
I was too busy running.

230
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,593
And you know...
And you know what else?

231
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,757
There was this boy with it.

232
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,348
And he wasn't afraid.

233
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,472

It's just
I don't know what to do,

Hi.

258
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,232
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, just playing tic-tac-toe.

259
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,511
[Chuckling] Well, this isn't exactly
the best place for tic-tac-toe.

260
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,712
The tide's coming in.
High water reaches this cave sometimes.

261
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,717
You better
head for home.

You're not from

Nope.

Where are you staying?

- What's your name?
- Pete.

267

I'm Nora, and I have to get back
on watch, up in the lighthouse.

268
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,510
There's chowder on the stove,
if you'd like some.

269
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,679
Wh-What's the matter?
It's a hand, not a shark.

You can finish that chowder...

it's like up in the lighthouse.

277
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,515
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

278
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,477
The Gogans own me,
I guess.

279
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,910
They said it was against the law
for me to ever leave them.

280
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,037
Where did you get
that bruise?

281
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,755
Mr. Gogan. I was milking the cow,
and I missed the bucket.

282
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,476
- Had he done that before?
- All the time.

283
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,434
The first time I ran away,
the orphan home sent me back.

284
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,233
This time,
I'll just keep running.

285
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,040
Well, you'll be safe here.

286
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:46,154
Nora, no one's ever been this nice
to me. I'll always remember it.

287
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,635
Pete, why don't you
sleep here tonight?

288
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,910
We'll figure out
what to do tomorrow.

289
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,474
Okay?

290
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,592
Wonderful.
I've got work to do. Come on.

291
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,276
Are you anybody's mother?

292
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,516
I'm not even anybody's wife.

293
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,837
But you're gonna get
married now, aren't you?

294
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,396
[Scoffs] I'm already married
to this lighthouse.

295
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,479
- Who's that?
- Paul.

296
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,149
- Is he part of your family?
- He almost was.

297
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,114
- How can someone almost
be part of a family?
- We were going to be married.

298
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,630
How come you weren't?

299
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,629
Well, as far as we know,
his ship was headed for a storm.

300
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,675
They were never heard from again.
That was a year ago.

301
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,678
He'll come back.

302
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,314
I tell myself
the same thing every day,

303
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,069
standing up there
watching for ships on the horizon.

304
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,636
[Sighs] Time I should be thinking of
other things, so they tell me.

305
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,589
I'll have to ask
Elliott about Paul.

306
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,676
He has a way
of knowing things.

307
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,677
Who's Elliott?

308
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,633
- My dragon.
- Dragon?

309
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,832
[Gasps]
So you're the boy with the dragon.

310
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,235
- Yup.
- Where is he?

311
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,591
- Down in the cave.
- That's interesting.

312
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,315
I've never known anyone with a dragon.
What does he look like?

313
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,670
Just a plain,
ordinary dragon.

314
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,553
How plain?
How ordinary?

315
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,070
He has the head of a camel

316
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,236
The neck
of a crocodile

317
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,749
It sounds rather strange.

318
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,156
He's both
a fish and a mammal

319
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,718
And I hope
he'll never change

320
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,550
'Cause it's not easy
to find someone who cares

321
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,673
It's not easy
to find magic in pairs

322
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,109
I'm glad I found him
I love him

323
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,119
I won't let him
get away

324
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,472
'Cause it's not easy

325
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,555
You say
the head of a camel

326
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,355
- The neck of a crocodile
- And the ears of a cow!

327
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,837
It's clear that friends
can be different

328
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,112
Yes, I understand you now

329
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,919
[Together] It's not easy
to find someone who cares

330
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,158
It's not easy
to find magic in pairs

331
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,714
Now that you have him
Hold him

332
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,310
Treasure him
from day to day

333
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,118
It's so easy

334
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,953
Life is lollipops
and raindrops

335
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,959
With the one
you love

336
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,595
Someone you can
always be with

337
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,359
Argue and agree with

338
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,753
Climb the highest tree with

339
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,554
[Together]
It's not easy

340
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,557
To share somebody's dream

341
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,753
It gets easy
when you work as a team

342
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,394
You've got to tend it
Fan it

343
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,036
That's what
I plan to do

344
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:16,393
Oh, I had one friend
by my side

345
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,229
Now I have two

346
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,272
Him and you

347
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,552
Him and me

348
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,276
[Together]
And it's so easy

349
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,632
[Humming]

350
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,836
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, son.

351
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,794
- Nice to see you again.
- Ah. Thank you.

352
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,350
Aah!

353
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,790
- It's you!
- What's the matter?

354
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,071
It's you.
The boy with the dragon.

355
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,236
Yes, sir.

356
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,797
[Screaming]

357
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,480
Dad! Dad, what is it?

358
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,628
- The boy with the dragon.
- I know, I know. Now, just take it easy.

359
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,910
You saw it.
You saw it?

360
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,395
I didn't actually see it,
but I know what it looks like.

361
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,398
- But wha...
- We'll talk about it later.

362
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,196
O-One thing I must know:
It isn't in the lighthouse, is it?

363
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,596
- No, Elliott's down in the cave.
- Oh, Ellio...

364
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,236
Elliott? Lt... It even has a name.

365
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,874
There's nothing
to get upset about.

366
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,958
You're right. Right, there's
nothing to get upset about.

367
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,514
Nothing. No, why should I get upset?
I should be happy.

368
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,316
L... I should be happy! I'll go down
to the saloon and I'll tell the boys.

369
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,831
I'll say, "Boys, here it is."
And then hear the apologies. [Laughs]

370
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,396
Elliott'll be happy
to do it for you, sir.

371
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,670
Good boy. Good lad.

372
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,519
Just you and me and Elliott.
We'll go into the saloon.

373
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,756
Oh. Elliott...

374
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,075
He won't... won't start
to scratch or...

375
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,555
or fight, or set anything
on fire, will he?

376
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,592
- Well, he's sort of...
- Sort of what?

377
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,474
- Unpredictable.
- Now, don't do anything with Elliott.

378
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,477
Wh-Why don't you
leave him where he is?

379
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,876
- It's too dangerous
to take him into town.
- It's dangerous.

380
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,276
Now, I don't want either one of you
to say a word about Elliott...

381
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,277
- to anyone, do you understand,
- No. No. Yes!

382
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,356
Until we've
talked this over.

383
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,438
Now, let's all have breakfast. The lamp
has to be polished, the lens cleaned,

384
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,437
and I want to take Pete
to buy new clothes.

385
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,437
Yes, well, clean Elliott
and eat the lamp.

386
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,790
I mean, we'll...
clea-clean the lamp.

387
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,833
[Muttering] Elliott!
The name's Elliott. Did you hear that?

388
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,595
Doc Terminus is comin'!

389
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,637
Are they still after us?

390
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,716
We lost 'em.

391
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,035
Good.

392
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,275
- Passamaquoddy ahead, ahoy!
- What?

393
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,678
Pass-a-ma-quoddy ahead, ahoy!

394
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,792
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

395
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,593
[Dog Barking]

396
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,029
- [Screams] Slow down!
- My fence!

397
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,996
Throw out the anchor!

398
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,477
Since we all concur, gentlemen,
I suggest that we adjourn.

399
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,477
[Screams]

400
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,989
[Townspeople Screaming]

401
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,193
- Watch Bones.
- Get him off of me! Get him off!

402
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,118
I think they remember us.

403
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,913
Uh-oh. I think
I remember them.

404
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,113
- Just act normal.
- I am acting normal. I'm ready to run.

405
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,119
- Quick, what's the name
of this town again?
- Passamaquoddy.

406
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,595
- "Quassama" what?
- Passamaquoddy!

407
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,599
Got it. How wonderful to see
your smiling faces again.

408
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,870
All of you.

409
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,956
I-I've never known
such warmth,

410
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,957
such welcome,

411
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,435
such loving hospitality.

412
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,438
Get out, ya quack!

413
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,551
And don't bring those
phony remedies here again.

414
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,989
Go on back where
you belong: Jail.

415
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,318
- [Booing]
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

416
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,351
I sense enthusiasm,

417
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,436
I sense loving response,

418
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,757
and that's why I feel
that this is my home...

419
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,030
away from home.

420
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,516
I've been bringing cures
from Pilgrim Heights to Provincetown

421
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,712
Treated rabid fever
down on Queen Anne Road

422
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,435
Gout or gastritis
Mumps or bronchitis

423
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,235
Bites and burns and blue abrasions
Got a pill for all occasions

424
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,352
Little Sipowissot
was so nice to visit

425
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,075
And Scraggy Neck
is lovely to recall

426
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,670
I took your drug for losing weight
and now I'm a blob

427
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,758
But now there's so much
more of you to love

428
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,231
I wiped out impetigo
on the banks of Buttermilk

429
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,114
Flu is under firm control
in Powder Hole

430
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,516
Terminus potions
tablets and lotions

431
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,996
Major news in modern science
Step up now and join my clients

432
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,556
Spent a day in Buzzard's Bay
They couldn't keep me there

433
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,240
Even turned away
from Kingdom Hall

434
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,351
They probably
threw you out

435
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,914
[Laughing]
They probably threw...

436
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,396
My hair was gray and thanks to you
it turned into pink

437
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,149
But that color.
It's so becoming.

438
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,831
- Aah!
- We're gonna wash your phony
tonics right down the sink

439
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,030
Wait. Listen.

440
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,072
My specialties are
audiology, mycology,

441
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,671
serology, teratology,
embryology, psychology, zoology...

442
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,314
and any other "ology"
you can think of!

443
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,512
My friends, you're not
giving me a chance!

444
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,679
[Sobs] I brought all these
medicines back from Paris.

445
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,677
- France.
- [Crowd] Ohh!

446
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,519
Honi soit qui mal y pense:
Shamed be he who thinks evil of it.

447
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,428
And that's what the medical
business is all about, folks:
People helping people.

448
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,790
You should all have help.

449
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,832
Gadzooks!
What have we here?

450
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,509
Oh, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor.
[Panting]

451
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,995
All I'm askin' for
is a miracle.

452
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,395
All he wants
is a miracle, folks.

453
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,389
How can I deny him? If he's willing
to pay for it, he's gonna get it.

454
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,592
- Any price.
- One dollar, sir.

455
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,037
[Drumroll]

456
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,837
[Drumroll Ends]

457
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,555
- I trust him.
- I believe in the Doc.

458
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,551
I'd put my life
in his hands.

459
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,273
My friends you've seen a miracle
and you'll see many more

460
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,073
People will come pourin' in
from land and sea

461
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,636
We'll have centers for testing
Let's start investing

462
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,035

we'll be ready for the night.

Sure. Before that, I'd like
to show Elliott my new suit.

Okay. Nora, first can
I bring Paul's picture down to Elliott?

- For making believe about
the dragon and going along with it.
- Making...

It means a lot to Pete.
Sort of a family he made up.

the existence of a dragon...

from bits of dragon.

[Chuckling]

772
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,270
Dragon whiskers
Dragon toes

773
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,277
A dragon tooth

774
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,472
And a dragon nose

775
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,876
Every little piece
Every little piece

776
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,629
We could make a million
by slicing him, dicing him

777
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,116
Hoagy, we could sell
every little shell

778
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,516
There's enough of him
to go around

779
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,279
Money, money, money
by the pound

780
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,598
Every little piece
Every little piece

781
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:56,030
I can take a scissor
and clip him up, rip him up

782
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,550
Every little part
is a work of art

783
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,911
Think of what
a dragon heart would bring

784
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,032
Wrapped up in a ribbon
and a string

785

Dragon liver
can cure a cold

Dragon powder grows hair
[Gasping]

787

With dragon blood
you'll never grow old

788
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:21,078
Every item
is covered with gold

Every item
is covered with gold

Every little piece

Every little piece

792
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,070
Dragon, you're my wagon to destiny
you're the key

793
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,556
Every little shred
moving me ahead

794
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,911
Every dream of mine
will be fulfilled

795
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,032
Oh, what a dragon business
we can build

796
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:49,119
Dragon cartilage
keeps you thin

797
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,391
Dragon fat is for burns
[Gasping]

798
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:56,638
A dragon tear will
clear up your skin

799
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,672
Watch the profits
come rolling in

800
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:06,319
Watch the profits
come rolling in

801
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,352
Every little piece
Every little crease

802
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,359
Oh, lead me to the dragon
I'll buy him up, tie him up

803
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:19,589
Drag him from the cave
Show him that I'm brave

804
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,631
I'll bind him up
Grind him up

805
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,115
Lop him up
Chop him up

806
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,518
Can't you hear
that jingle-jangle sound

807
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,155
Oh yeah

808
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,999
[Together]
It's money money, money by the pound

809
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:50,273
Good morning, Miss Nora.
So, this is where you live, eh?

810
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,995
At last we've seen the light.
[Chuckling]

811
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:57,032
I tell you, you've got to have
a sense of humor these days.

812
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,596
- And you must be Pete.
- Yes, sir!

813
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,232
I'm Dr. Terminus,
and this is Hoagy,

814
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,828
who's doing
his internship with me.

815
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,520
I heard about the incident
at school yesterday.

816
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,315
- I'd rather not discuss it.
- I realize you must be
disturbed about it, and, uh,

817
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,432
up to here in dragons.

818
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,109
You know, Pete, I have
always loved dragons.

819
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,754
They're such
wonderful creatures.

820
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,633
When they're not busy
destroying things, of course.

821
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,752
I've had a dream since
I was your age that one day...

822
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,758
I would have
my very own dragon.

823
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,871
I would consider my life
to be fulfilled...

824
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,757
and would be most grateful
if you would sell me your dragon.

825
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,032
You wanna buy Elliott?

826
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,037
Sight unseen. As is.

827
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,596
We'll give him
a good home. Bless him.

828
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,790
I couldn't sell him.

829
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,913
Sure you could! That's what life
is all about: Buying and selling.

830
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:01,113
- I'll give ya three dollars.
- [Whispering] Offer him four!

831
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,515
I'll offer him five.
It'll make his head swim.

832
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,871
Five... dollars.

833
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,072
I can't sell him.
I don't own him.

834
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,988
- Well, what did ya do, rent him?
- Well, who owns him?

835
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,475
Well, nobody, I guess.

836
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,956
He just came to me.
He only goes to those who need him.

837
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,355
I need him.

838
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,711
Listen, Doc, I don't know what you're
up to, but you better forget about this.

839
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,071
- He's not for sale.
- Nora, go paint your lighthouse.

840
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,953
Pete, my boy,
you're conversant with Elliott.

841
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:35,470
Now, talk to him.
Tell him how much I need him.

842
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,478
Deliver Elliott to me
and the fiver is yours,

843
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:43,674
plus a bottle of my medicine
that's guaranteed to bring on
puberty two years ahead of time,

844
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,234
and that's better than a dragon, hmm?
[Chuckling]

845
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:50,319
- Doc, maybe you should
talk to Elliott yourself.
- Mm-hmm.

846
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,431
Wh-Where is he?
Does he speak English?

847
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,630
Down the beach.

848
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,394
- Where?
- Right there, by the water.

849
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,072
- Right. I still don't see...
- That's because he's invisible today.

850
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,272
[Laughing]

851
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,437
They know they're sitting
on a gold mine.

852
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,472
Well, they've had their chance
to make a few dollars.

853
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:39,596
That dragon doesn't belong to anybody.
He's fair game, and he's gonna be ours!

854
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:43,269
We'll bind him up, grind him up
Lock him up, chop him up

855
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,188
Can't you hear
that jingle-jangle sound

856
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,312
- Oh yeah
- [Cackling]

857

Fog! Fog!

863
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,557
- Where's the fog?
- There's not much fog.

864
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,194
We were just using the horn
to chase off a few buzzards.

865
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,949
Few buzzards. Nora,
how many times must l...

866
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,833
Oh, started already, huh?

867
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,996
Look, if you're
gonna whitewash, son,

868
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,271
let your brush
go up and down, up...

869
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,391
that's a boy...
and down.

870
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,750
- Up and down. Up and down.
- That's right.

871
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,110
- [Chuckling]
- This is fun.

872
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,437
If it's so much fun, I'm gonna leave
it to you and Nora to finish up...

873
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:47,314
while I go in and take
a nice little nap.

874
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,709
This is the best time
I've ever had in my whole life.

875
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,193
- It is?
- Yeah.

876
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,390
Tell him, Nora.

877
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,913
Pete, Lampie and I
have talked it over.

878
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:10,511
- We feel the time has come
for you to stop running.
- Yes, it's true.

879
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:16,397
If it's all right with you,
we'd like you to live here with us.

880
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:20,911
Oh, Nora, Lampie, do you mean this
could be my real home?

881
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:24,555
- It certainly does.
- And Elliott too?

882
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,116
- Well, l...
- Sure, and Elliott too.

883
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,754
But Elliott has to live
in the cave.

884
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,394
All right, he will.

885
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,069
- Oh.

Not on me! Not on me!

On the side of the building,
please, huh?

You know what?

It's a brazzle
dazzle day

Enjoying your time
from minute to minute

without your shoes on
- Shoes on

Even the birds
are below us

01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,439
It's a brazzle
dazzle day

924
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,235
A lifetime of joy
in just a few hours

925
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,352
All our brazzle dazzle years

926
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:43,156
Have just begun
We'll follow the sun and replay

927

This brazzle dazzle day

928

This brazzle dazzle day

Come on. Come on.

934
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,791
Whoa, boy. Say, have you seen
anything of a mean, fresh kid...

935
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,990
'bout yea big?

936
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,997
Answers to the name of Pete.

937
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,998
Half of the kids in this town
answer to the name of Pete.

938
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,997
Other half don't answer.

939
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:28,079
- Let me break his bones, Pa!
- Just a minute!

940
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,919
This particular Pete,
he's always talkin'...

941
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,589
to his big, hokey-pokey,

Merle, this here's
the place.

944
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,957
Come on, Willie.

945
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,229
It would be unethical of me
to leave my patient at a time like this.

946
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,113
It's important.
About the dragon.

947
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:09,391
Put your foot on there.

948
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,795
Now, don't move, stay tense,
or that weight will fall,

949
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,276
that clamp will break your jaw,
tear your gums apart
and go through your cheek.

See that wagonload of worms? They're
lookin' for the kid and the dragon.

953
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,869
I knew there'd be competition.
Come on.

954

Careful as you bring 'em aside.

961
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:10,199
Who's that pretty lady

962

- Yeah. Introduce us.
- Yeah. Introduce us.

963
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,830
I'm Nora, and Pete
is staying with me.

964
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:23,478
Why, boys, I believe she's tryin'
to break up our happy little family.

965
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,513
Elliott went to look for Paul.
I wish he were here.

966
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,200
Don't worry. They won't get you.
Come on, Dad.

967

to his own home, sweet home.

- Come on, Pete.
- You won't be taking him anywhere!

970

Okay, lady. We're gonna take him
whether you like it or not.

That says
he belongs to us

986
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,989
We bought him

And we own
the little cuss

see him when he comes through the door.
