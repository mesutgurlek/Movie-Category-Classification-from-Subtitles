- [Voiceover] Ladies and
gentlemen, here he is.

21
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,127
The star Dolemite.

22
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,306
- Yes, I have been rough.

23
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,179
And you know I'm also tough.

24
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,931
I'm bad and sometimes
I get very mad.

25
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,105
I've been known to be mean,

26
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,433
but right now y'all
can look and see

27
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,735
that I'm damn sure clean.

28
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:28,567
(crowd applause)

29
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,040
Now I see a lot of lovely
people in this house tonight.

30
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,993
Look at this big fat man.

31
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,671
My my my my girls look
what y'all could get

32
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,339
if you was lucky.

33
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,669
Well I say one thing,
he can lay heavy

34
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,549
but he'll never go deep.

35
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:57,099
(drum roll)

36
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:01,015
I bet he tells the average girl

37
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,850
you may not know I'm in there,

38
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,231
but you're damn sure
know I'm on there.

39
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,485
I see this big
fat lady with him.

40
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,488
My my my my my,
young lady you've got

41
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,945
the same damn thing them
lil skinny girls got.

42
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,905
But a damn sight more of it.

43
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,491
Is that your husband?

44
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:19,871
Ain't that a damn shame?

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,123
You need a little
skinny man, baby.

46
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,205
You and that man get
in the bed together

47
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,418
and try to do y'all thing
would be a mission impossible.

48
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:33,924
(audience applauds)

49
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:37,385
I'm gonna tell you like the
bathtub told the toilet stool

50
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,766
I get as much ass as you,

51
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,018
but I don't have to
take all that shit.

52
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,645
Young lady went out with her
boyfriend the other night,

53
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,655
and he got into bed
with her and pulled out

54
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,482
something like my little finger.

55
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,904
She looked at it and said,

56
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,699
well you no-screwing,
pencil-dick,

57
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,867
Pistol-Peter son of a gun.

58
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,161
Says I tell you what
I will do for you.

59
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,080
Since you can't
do nothing for me

60
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,204
with a joint that small,

61
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,582
said I'll give you $50
if you can hurt me.

62
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,630
He screwed her three
times and hit her

63
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,674
in the head with a rock.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,297
(crowd applause)

65
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,129
There's some ugly mother
fuckers in this house tonight.

66
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,216
If you don't believe
it, look over here.

67
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,892
Baby

68
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,772
you are so ugly you stopped
this motion picture from runnin.

69
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,067
Yo lips like you wearing
a turtleneck sweater.

70
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,860
I had a brother
look just like you,

71
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,466
he stuck his head out the window

72
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,405
and his lips beat him to death.

73
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,693
My my my, that's what
I call stretching

74
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,028
a good thing a bit too far.

75
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,954
Two soldiers went to Vietnam,

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,954
a black soldier and a white
soldier, can you dig it?

77
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,683
And they come all
the way back home,

78
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,711
and the people in
Louisiana said we gonna

79
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,914
give y'all anything
that y'all want.

80
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,887
They looked at the
white soldier and said,

81
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,328
young man, what do you want?

82
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,252
He said, well I'll tell
you all what I want.

83
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,716
I want me $10,000 and a
Lincoln Continental to drive.

84
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,851
They said, we gonna
get that for you.

85
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,071
Then they looked at the
brother, they said brother,

86
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,096
what would you like?

87
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,898
The brother said, well

88
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,022
y'all can give me
a dollar and a half

89
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,854
from the head of my
ding-a-ling down to my balls.

90
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,606
They said brother, brother,

91
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,863
don't you want no
more than that?

92
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,115
He said, no that's all I want.

93
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,044
So he pulled it out
and they put a dollar

94
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,231
and a half at the head of it.

95
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,883
Then they put another
dollar and a half on it,

96
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,107
and another dollar and a half,

97
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,497
another dollar and a half,

98
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,124
and another dollar and a half.

99
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,296
And one of those fellas
looked at him and said,

100
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,171
nigga, where is your balls at?

101
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,838
He said in Vietnam.

102
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,722
(crowd applauds)

103
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,956
Young lady took her boyfriend
out with her the other night.

104
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,264
You know?

105
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,017
She got into bed with him,

106
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,945
and baby he did his thang before
he could get on top of her.

107
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,739
And he looked at her and said,

108
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,943
go in the kitchen
and fix me some food.

109
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,370
She went in the
kitchen and brought him

110
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,539
a head of lettuce and
a bowl of carrots.

111
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,863
He looked at her and said,

112
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,750
why in the world did
you bring me these

113
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,044
carrots and lettuce out here?

114
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,293
She looked at him,
said, mother fucker

115
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,222
you fuck like a rabbit,
you might as well

116
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,877
eat like one.

117
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,130
- Dolemite you might
come like a rabbit yourself.

118
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,756
- Now this is what
I call a nigga

119
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,057
that always wanna
get in the show.

120
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,517
This is the kinda nigga
that'll fart in a bathtub

121
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,315
and turn around and
bite the bubble.

122
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,362
(crowd applauds)

123
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,988
Ladies and gentlemen
tonight has been a pleasure.

124
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,990
Thank you for letting
us be ourselves.

125
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,741
I ain't lying!

126
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,914
- [Voiceover] Dolemite
ladies and gentlemen!

127
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:52,250
(crowd applauds)

128
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,149
(crowd chats)

129
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:19,615
(light funk music)

130
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,242
- You really came at a bad time.

131
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,075
I'm very very busy.

132
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,378
Relax, take off your thangs,
and I'll see you later.

133
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:45,057
- I've invited you
all here to inform you

134
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,384
that the money drive
that was planned

135
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,845
six months ago by our
planning committee,

136
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,180
to purchase a new boys home,

137
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,687
has been called abruptly closed.

138
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,815
(crowd murmurs)

139
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,277
But along with the bad news,

140
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,825
there's always good news.

141
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,868
I'm going to allow the man

142
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,992
that's caused all
of this to happen.

143
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,120
Your friend and mine,
brother Dolemite.

144
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,545
(crowd applauds)

145
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,255
- Thank you.

146
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,097
I'm so glad you could come.

147
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,596
As you know I've been
having a lot of hard knocks.

148
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,474
And a lot of trials
and tribulations.

149
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,607
And I've had a lot of success.

150
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,104
And I think it's a shame
for anyone successful

151
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,819
not to share it with others.

152
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,077
So today I'm doing
something that I wanted

153
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,325
to do for a long time.

154
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,624
I'm giving my home
and its entirety

155
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,335
to the gentleman that started
the drive for the boys home.

156
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,087
(crowd applauds)

157
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,512
Let us now talk to some of
our distinguished guests.

158
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,786
Alright let's get
this shit over,

159
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,708
I ain't got all day.

160
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,878
- Dolemite.

161
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,749
You're worth every
damn cent I pay you.

my ass, what would you do?

329
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,522

Pull over at the next

Hey how's Florida, huh?

- Oh, Florida's fine,
but I'm not so well.

441
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,029
Uh, I don't like your receipts kid.

442
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,642
What are you running down there,

443
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:14,953
a funeral parlor?

444
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,454
- Now look, look boss.

445
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,704
Look you see, if this damn
broad down the street,

446
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,955
you know Queen Bee boss.

447
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,006
She's competition
this Queen Bee.

448
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,834
- It's Queen Bee, Queen Bee,

449
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,448
you've been telling me about
Queen Bee for months now Joe.

450
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,594
Uh, Joe, you're into
this organization

451
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,551
for a lot of money,

452
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,100
and now they are after me.

453
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,306
- Hey Vince, Vince, listen

454
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,438
I swear it's all gonna
be taken care of.

455
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:42,967
Just gimme a little more time.

456
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,779
- Boss has something
he wants to say.

457
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,732
- Now look boys, we
ain't doing so good.

458
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,908
And my people are mad at me.

459
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,487
Now with Queen Bee's club
taking in all the business,

460
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,664
my place is coming up
like a funeral parlor.

461
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,742
And my backers in Florida
ain't so happy about it.

462
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,916
They're pressuring me.

463
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,544
And this kinda
pressure I don't need.

464
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,046
Now something's gotta
be done about it, right?

465
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,425
Okay, now Carl here is gonna
act as my enforcer.

466
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,342
Now I want Queen
Bee's place shut down.

467
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,676
- Jimmy baby.

468
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,010
- [Jimmy] Yeah, Queen?

469
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,470
- Oh, we!

470
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,353
Two more nights like this,

471
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,230
and maybe we can
make up for them

472
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,812
two lousy weekends we had.

473
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,186
You know why?

474
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,864
- Why's that Ma, what is it?

475
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,283
- Java's really packing them in.

476
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,406
I should have had her
here a long time ago.

477
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,032
- Right on baby.

478
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,006
And you know I haven't
seen this many niggas

479
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,498
in here since Dolemite was here.

480
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,748
And my catch action
tonight was heavy.

481
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,330
If I was you I'd hold
on for a couple weeks.

482
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,663
- I heard that.

483
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,083
- Yes sir!

484
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,813
- Thank God we don't have to
see this place until tomorrow.

485
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,310
Girl my feet are hurting.

486
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,391
I feel like I wanna scream.

487
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:05,897
- Right on Java.

488
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,944
- Oh, fix me a drink baby.

489
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,866
How did we do tonight, Queenie?

490
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,614
- Not bad baby.

491
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,911
In fact you can look for
a bonus with your check.

492
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,534
You deserve it.

493
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,491
- That's what I like to hear.

494
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,950
- Here baby.

495
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,678
And as good as you
looked and the way

496
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,954

497
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,506
You can go anywhere
you want with me.

498
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,004
- Now what about
your lady over here?

499
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,304
(Queen laughs)

500
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,306
(slams chair)

501
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,307
- Oh excuse me,
I made a mistake.

502
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,568
- That's okay, lemme
give you a hand okay?

503
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:48,940
- Alright.

504
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,192
(smashes chairs)

505
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,148
- What kinda shit is this?

506
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,706
(fight sounds)

507
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,952
(gunfire)

508
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,038
- Everybody freeze!

509
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,674
(punching sound)

510
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,771
- You the hard-hitting
lady owner?

511
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,523
Well maybe this'll teach you.

512
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,610
The boss wants you to learn.

513
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,783
(punching sound)

514
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,953
(Queen screams and moans)

515
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,009
- Queen!

516
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,590
Oh my God.

517
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,139
- Come on let's get outta here.

518
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,468
Come on.

519
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,182
<i>- Let's go!</i>

520
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,779
(phone rings)

521
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,105
- Hello.

522
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,025
- Yeah boss, we got him.

523
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,638
We didn't get that
Jackson creep,

524
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,938
but we got two of the girls.

525
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:21,865
- Good.

526
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,118
Nice work Carl.

527
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,755
(phone rings)

528
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,671
- Hello?

529
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,631
- This is Cavaletti.

530
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,932
I've got two of your girls.

531
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,138
Now I want you to close
that joint of yours down

532
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,596
and be over here tomorrow night.

533
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,307
Cause if you don't, you'll
never seem em again.

534
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,987
- Hello? Hello?

535
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,067
Motherfucker hung up.

536
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,995
(man laughs)

537
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,542
(old lady laughs)

538
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,422
- What the fuck is this?

539
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,766
- What have we here?

540
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,523
You've come to see Momma.

541
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:35,569
(laughs)

542
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,366
- This place gives
me the creeps.

543
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,863
- Yeah, me too.

544
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,366
I wonder why the boss picked
this place to come here.

545
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,117
- He likes the old lady.

546
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,824
Besides, he gets his nuts

547
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,034
watching her torture
pretty broads.

548
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,339
(old lady laughs)

549
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,382
- My little pretty.

550
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,920
Oh you like that.

551
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,223
My boy says hey.

552
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,347
(woman screams)

553
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,282
- [Dolemite] I hope
these girls in California

554
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,155
are as good as this apple.

555
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,284
Boys.

556
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,082
This is Los Angeles, California.

557
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:35,333
- [Man] California, oh this
is where the stars are.

558
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,255
- [Dolemite] I said boys.

559
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,671
Dough gimme a little money.

560
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,467
Here's 97 dollars.

561
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,393
Thanks for the use of your car,

562
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,016
and the trouble we caused you.

563
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,895
- I'll take your money, but you
didn't cause me any trouble.

564
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,647
I've always wanted to
come to California.

565
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,321
By the looks of the
things out here,

566
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,990
someone's gonna have to
kidnap me to take me back.

567
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,819
(laughs)

568
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,785
- Dough, call us a cab.

569
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,991
- Hey taxi!

570
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,899
- Damn, what the
hell happened here?

571
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,110
- Yeah, the club should
be open, shouldn't it?

572
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,574
- Whatever happened,

573
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:54,158
somebody better have a
damn good excuse for it.

574
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:57,335
Let's make it out to
Queen Bee's house.

575
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,378
- Hey, hey, where you going?

576
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,883
Ain't nobody home.

577
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,100
- Well where's everybody at?

578
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,019
- Don't know, I ain't
seen nobody all day.

579
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,562
- Fellas let's go into town

580
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,168
and check out some of the clubs.

581
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,742
I'm sure someone there
can tell us something.

582
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,766
Let's make it.

583
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:26,698
(funk music)

584
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,769

could have done found.

586

me to come at once.

656
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,852
I went by the club
and it's closed.

Well that's news to me.

659
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,241
Did you try her house?

660
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,535

- Kidnapped em, what you mean?

729
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,473
- Kidnap em, and forced us
to come and work for him.

730
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,678
And said that if I didn't
come and work for him,

he'd kill em.

be nuts to think

he can get away with
some shit like that.

Who the hell does
he think he is?

- That's what I wanna know.

736
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,817
He must think he is

737

the new Godfather
or some kinda shit.

738
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,457

making more money than he was.

What's with the chatter?

742
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,963
- They were just
some friends of mine,

743
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,612
and they was looking
for somebody.

00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,137
- I could tell he's

822
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,722
in these parts.

823
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,521
I'm gonna find that nigger

824
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,813
if it's the last thing I do.

825
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,693
- Well good luck to you.

826
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,820
We'll do everything
we can to help you.

827
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,820
- I appreciate that

828
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,371
very much.

829
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,993
- Oh by the way Sheriff.

830
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,918
What do you want him for?

831
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:19,461
- He murdered my wife.

832
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,927
- I'm sorry.

833
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:27,598
I'll put my best man on it.

834
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:37,854
(phone rings)

835
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,374
- Detective Pete Blakeley here.

836
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,701
- Blakeley, it's Ryan.

837
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,506
I've got a special
assignment for you.

838
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,912
- I've got one too captain,

839
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,809
it's just about to
slip through my hands.

840
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,006
Now look, my vacation just
started two hours ago.

841
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,339
- I know Pete.

842
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:11,058
And I am sorry,

843
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,680
but this is serious.

844
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,307
Maybe a promotion.

845
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:15,854
- How serious?

846
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,352
- It's a 187.

847
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,934
- Have you got an ID captain?

848
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,267
- Yes.

849
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:23,904
Male negro

850
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,278
200 pounds, six foot,

851
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,701
may be a scar on
his left shoulder.

852
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,903
We do have a mugshot.

853
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,705
- Oh that's just great.

854
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,998
But do you have a name or an ID?

855
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:36,871
- Yes, he goes by the name of

856
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:38,201
Dolemite.

857
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:45,919
(woman screams)

858
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,440
(engine starts)

859
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:19,494
(exciting music)

860
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:27,673
(tires screech)

861
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,560
(cars honk)

862
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,857
(tires screech)

863
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:50,032
(exciting drum music)

864
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:03,379
(gunfire)

865
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,835
(chill music)

866
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,008
- It looks like nobody can
help him-.

867
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,098
They just wished he was new

868
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,141
and wish he was a girl.

869
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,980
- Well, I think I know
what we got to do.

870
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:26,982
Queen Bee we got to get TC
and Alice away from Cavaletti.

871
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,439
- Well this is a big city.

872
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,024
Where do we start?

873
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:32,700
- That's easy.

874
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:35,323
We find Cavaletti and (punches)

875
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,997
make him tell us where they are.

876
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,245
- Oh no, it's not that easy.

877
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,167
Everywhere that Joe goes

878
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,040
he has his army with him.

879
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:47,465
- Oh baby, armies can
come large or small

880
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,133
but we're known for kicking ass

881
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,926
and we can handle em all.

882
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,345
(group laughs)

883
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,969
(phone rings)

884
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,390
- Hello?

885
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,559
- Queen, stop what
you're doing this minute.

886
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,478
Cavaletti wants you
and your bitches

887
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,431
over here within the hour.

888
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:06,017
- Oh just a second please.

889
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,693
This is from Joe.

890
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,487
Pick up on the other phone.

891
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:24,418
Would you tell Joe

892
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,292
that all the girls
are on their monthly.

893
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,295
And they will not be able

894
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,342
to be over there tonight.

895
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:35,012
- Now you listen to me Queen.

896
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,384
- What's the matter now?

897
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:37,714
- She ain't coming.

898
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,317
- What do you mean
she's not coming?

899
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,388
Gimme that phone.

900
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,937
Queen Bee, you better
get your ass over here

901
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,935
and I mean on the double.

902
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:46,686
- Under one condition.

903
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,608
That you turn my girls loose.

904
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,528
- Look Bee, you're in no
position to bargain with me.

905
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,231
Now you get your
hot ass over here,

906
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,066
or I'll massacre
those black bitches.

907
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,864
I'll give you just one hour.

908
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:04,826
(dial tone)

909
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:08,504
- Why you rat-soup
eating motherfucker!

910
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,086
- I guess you heard all of that.

911
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,638
- That's all I needed to know.

912
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,011
That the girls are still alive.

913
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,811
Now I can work with that
cranny-dodging motherfucker.

914
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:26,434
So here's what we do.

915
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,609
- Brother QB what's happening?

916
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,060
- I wanna talk to you man.

917
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,247
- Oh I don't have time
fellas, I got a lot to do.

918
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:34,942
I'll talk to you later.

919
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,552
- Later on will be too late man,

920
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,649
we need to rap right now.

921
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,735
- That's right brother
man, right now.

922
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,320
- Oh some heavy shit, huh?

923
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,700
- Dig it.

924
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,328
- Okay, sock it to me.

925
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,001
Cavaletti's men blew away
my brother this morning.

926
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:49,829
- Oh no, you mean Jeff is dead?

927
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,431
- That's why we come to you man.

928
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:52,581
We need your help.

929
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,517
- Okay I'll tell you
what we'll get together

930
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,964
this afternoon and see what
we can map out, alright?

931
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,563
- Say look here,
I got information

932
00:54:58,587 --> 00:54:59,964
on a house in Pasadena man,

933
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,049
where the motherfuckers
torture people.

934
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,929
- A torture chamber?

935
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,604
Goddamn I haven't heard of
no shit like that in years.

936
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,773
Listen, did you get
any information on

937
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,645
the guys that laid
your brother away?

938
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:12,521
- Yeah.

939
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,228
The motherfuckers was black.

940
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,359
- Yeah, brothers.

941
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,942
- Mannix, what's new
on the Sheriff case?

942
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,369
- Well I gotta see
some mugshots Chief.

943
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,991
- It's in the Dolemite file,

944
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,948
you've got everything we have.

945
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,841
- The Sheriff's case
is nothing compared

946
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,115
to what I've come up with.

947
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,581
Another 187.

948
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,709
This time the finger points to.

949
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,039
Mr. Cavaletti.

950
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,053
- [Chief] Cavaletti?
- [Pete] That's right.

951
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,166
- Do you have grounds?

952
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,424
- Well sir we share some
brotherly information.

953
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,753
- Good.

954
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,403
Gimme the information
and I'll assign

955
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,966
somebody else to the case.

956
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,299
I don't want you biting
off more than you can chew.

957
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,680
You concentrate on
the Sheriff case.

958
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,480
Get Dolemite.

959
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,396
- You mean you're
assigning me to help

960
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,161
some hokey Sheriff
solve a murder case

961
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,903
which we know nothing about?

962
00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:00,233
And for two years, I've
tried to nail Joe Cavaletti.

963
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,694
And finally I get this
asshole by his balls,

964
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,120
and you wanna assign
somebody else to the case?

965
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,445
- Now dammit Pete.

966
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,373
You will do as you're told.

967
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:09,699
- Good.

968
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,790
I remember the other day
I was told my vacation

969
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:14,042
started today,
and I'm taking it.

970
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,009
- Son of a bitch.

971
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,634
- What brings you
this way my friend?

972
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,058
- I've got news for ya.

973
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,889
- How you know I'm
looking for needles?

974
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,658
- I heard through the
grapevine that you

975
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:34,962
were trying to get Queen's girls

976
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,480
back from Cavaletti, right?

977
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:39,905
- So?

978
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,276
- I got some real strong info
from some friends of mine.

979
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,462
- So let's have it.

980
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,586
- Info like that
don't grow on trees.

981
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,884
It costs money you know.

982
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,303
I got a sick aunt.

983
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:16,688
- Hold it.

984
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,275
Information first.

985
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,824
- Well Cavaletti's got
this house in Pasadena.

986
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,901
It's a real chamber of horrors.

987
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,532
Like he really fucks
people up over there man.

988
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,910
- Where's it at?

989
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,866
- I haven't found that out yet.

990
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,123
- Well how do you find out?

991
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,998
- If somebody was to get
Cavaletti's main woman,

992
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,959
then they might find
out where the house is.

993
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,715
- Where does Cavaletti
keep his main woman?

994
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,005
- Well

995
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:51,302
Cavaletti usually
keeps her at his pad.

996
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,308
She's a nice bitch.

997
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,311
I heard that she's a
common freak, you know?

998
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,233
A real nymphomaniac.

999
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,560
- Where's Cavaletti's house?

1000
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,147
- In Pasadena baby.

1001
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,902
(doorbell rings)

1002
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,660
- May I help you?

1003
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,244
- Yes, is this the
Cavaletti's residence?

1004
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,702
- Yes, it is.

1005
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,036
What can I do for you?

1006
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,423
- My card first, Madame.

1007
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,885
- Frank Huck
Delmonico NcAdeemus?

1008
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,214
- Yes.

1009
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,055
Are you Mrs. Cavaletti?

1010
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:33,556
- Yes, I am.

1011
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,137
- Mrs. Cavaletti

1012
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,519
I am a connoisseur of the rarest

1013
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,068
most interesting nude studies.

1014
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:42,485
- I am not interested.

1015
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:43,811
If you'll just...

1016
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,857
- Ms-Cavaletti, if you
would wait just a moment

1017
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,739
and gaze upon this
exquisite artwork,

1018
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,241
I'm sure you'll be interested.

1019
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:57,330
Madame.

1020
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,037
I see you like my work.

1021
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,963
Miss?

1022
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,711
Miss Cavaletti?

1023
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,174
Mrs. Cavaletti?

1024
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,426
You do like my work?

1025
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:13,843
I've got something
better for you.

1026
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:19,105
You'll like it.

1027
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:22,355
Big black strong man.

1028
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:27,031
Ah. Ah.

1029
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:30,025
You'll enjoy it.

1030
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,077
Miss Cavaletti, Miss Cavaletti?

1031
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:38,375
(fantasy synthesizer music)

1032
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:25,266
- Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1033
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,602
(distorted sounds)

1034
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,609
- Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1035
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:38,495

1038
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:50,624
Where, where is Cavaletti
hiding the girls!

1039
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,881
(mirrors crash)

1040
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,220
(house shakes)

1041
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:05,101
(exciting music)

1042
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,542
(roof collapses)

1043
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:45,930
(sparks and explosions)

1044
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,729
Where is Cavaletti

1045
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,692
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1046
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,382
Where is Cavaletti

1047
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,325
Where is Cavaletti

1048
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:01,119
Where is Cavaletti

1049
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,196
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1050
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:07,083
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

1051
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,913
- They're at the
house on the hill

1052
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:13,044
in Pasadena.

1053
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,922
They're at the house on the hill

1054
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:17,969
in Pasadena.

1055
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:21,014
They're at house on the hill

1056
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,091
in Pasadena!

1057
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:28,639
- [Dolemite]
They're at the house

1058
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,896
on the hill in Pasadena.

1059
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:32,851
- Have a seat.

1060
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,184
- No thanks.

1061
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,311
- Some coffee?

1062
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,713
- No thanks, I've
had my breakfast.

1063
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,016
I just came here to find out

1064
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,858
what you got on
that Dolemite boy.

1065
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,911
It's been a while since
I've heard from you.

1066
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,070
I wanna know what's happening.

1067
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,156
- Well when we get something,

1068
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,036
I'll let you know.

1069
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,036
I've got my best
man on the case.

1070
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,667
- He ain't made no
contact with me yet.

1071
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:57,092
- Well this particular man
works better by himself.

1072
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:00,045
He's my undercover
man for the ghettos.

1073
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,721
- You mean to tell me you sent

1074
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,721
a nigger out to
find another nigger?

1075
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,450
Why that's the most
ridiculous thing

1076
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,011
I've ever heard of.

1077
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:08,974
- Sheriff.

1078
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,398
We don't have any niggers here.

1079
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:13,942
Just damn fine police officers.

1080
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,985
Some of the best in the country.

1081
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,530
Now if you can't respect that,

1082
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,278
and if you can't accept
my choice of assignment,

1083
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,236
you can get your
ass out that door.

1084
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,913
And if you don't like that
you can go to the Chief.

1085
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,491
- I'll do just that Captain.

1086
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,418
And when I find him, I'll
bring his head to you.

1087
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,838
Since you love niggers so much.

1088
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:38,633
You can mount Dolemite's
head on your mantlepiece.

1089
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,381
Good day, Captain.

1090
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,556
- Fuck you.

1091
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:50,804
- Sweetheart.

1092
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,309
Call Queen.

1093
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,439
Tell her to bring everybody
that works for her

1094
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:55,516
to my party tonight.

1095
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:57,007
Tell them to be ready at eight.

1096
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,145
I'll have them picked up.

1097
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:01,527
(phone rings)

1098
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,283
- Hello?

1099
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,649
- Joe wants you to scrounge
up all the girls you can

1100
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,325
and bring em over here tonight.

1101
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,953
We'll send someone after you.

1102
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,376
- Yes ma'am, we'll be there.

1103
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,538
- Well.

1104
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:20,634
Looks like we've all been
invited to the party.

1105
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,506
But this time

1106
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,804
this will be the party
to end all parties.

1107
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:30,560
<i>(spooky music)</i>

1108
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:33,476
(dog barks)

1109
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,521
Okay.

1110
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:41,151
We know that Cavaletti has
an army compared to us.

1111
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:43,899
We're outnumbered in people

1112
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:46,155
but not in skill.

1113
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:49,826
Just remember

1114
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:52,123
if anybody come out alive

1115
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,451
be sure it be one of us.

1116
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,832
Now how did you say this worked?

1117
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,414
- Well tonight

1118
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,090
is Cavaletti's birthday party.

1119
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:06,422
You'll have all his
big shit friends there.

1120
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,016
- So if we get em
all at one time,

1121
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,093
it's got to be tonight.

1122
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:16,101
- Has anybody heard
from Dolemite?

1123
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,936
(doorbell rings)

1124
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:32,246
- Howard Jackson!

1125
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:40,247
- Is that the bad little nigga
that taught me martial arts?

1126
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,048
- In person.

1127
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:44,046
- Lord things is looking better.

1128
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,375
- Looking better?

1129
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:46,885
With that little shit?

1130
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:49,761
Well I'll take my dick and
beat his goddamn ass with that.

1131
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,887
(group laughs)

1132
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,060
- We'll see about that brother.

1133
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,598
- Did you hear about
the new contract?

1134
01:06:58,932 --> 01:06:59,933
- No, what is it?

1135
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,815
- It's Queen Bee,
Annie, and Dolemite.

1136
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:04,145
- Who's doing the job?

1137
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:05,479
- Red and Fingers.

1138
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:06,273
- Well that's Wild.

1139
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:07,886
With those three out of the way,

1140
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:08,533
the boss will have no problems.

1141
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:09,858
- Right.

1142
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:13,822
(car honks)

1143
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,580
- Okay, we'll be right out.

1144
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,675
Alright girls.

1145
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,007
Let's get this show on the road.

1146
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,852
- We'll see you there.

1147
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,903
- We'll wait till
the party starts

1148
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,027
then we'll crash it.

1149
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:54,537
(tense music)

1150
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:05,124

(speaks gibberish)

1155

1158
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,881

(screams)

1167
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:55,255

down there the first time!

1168
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:58,888
(red shirt chuckles)

1169
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,195
- I didn't forget about you.

1170
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,863
We'll make it a twosome.

1171

(chuckles)

1172
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,923
Now don't move

1173
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,375
or bye bye.

1174

(combat sounds)

1178
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:39,443
- No, no.

1179

Please don't kill us.

Please no!

1184

(Crack)

1188
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:42,002
- The candle over here!

1189
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,009
The candle, the
rope, for God's sake!

1190
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,511
Pull me out of the way Dolemite.

1191
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,432
Hurry!

1192
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,010
(plank crashes)

1193
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:53,688
- Are you alright Java?

1194
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:56,061
- Oh yeah, thanks
to you Dolemite.

1195
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,983
- Don't touch me there's a
live grenade between my legs.

1196
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:04,065
- Be very careful
don't move, don't move.

1197
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:07,618
- He keeps the key over
in his back pocket.

1198
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:32,185
(explosion)

1199
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:42,691
- Java, are you alright?

1200
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:51,658
Mules have kicked me and
didn't even bruise my hide.

1201
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:56,417
Rattlesnakes have bit me
and falled off and died.

1202
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:02,048
Yes, I fought my way in here
cause I'm rough and ready,

1203
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:06,003
so girls let's go and get that

1204

motherfucking Cavaletti.

1205
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,433
Hurry.

(combat sounds)

1207
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,072
- Hurry Dolemite.

1208
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:29,867
Let me at em.

1209
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:34,205
(combat sounds)

1210
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:41,875
- Hello, Captain.

1211
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,204
Yeah, it's Pete here.

1212
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:44,669
Yeah, I know about that.

1213
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:46,216
Listen, hold onto your hat

1214
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,222
and get a pencil and
pad to take this down.

1215
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:51,013
I got some news here to
make you blow your mind.

1216
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:52,009
Yeah.

1217
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:55,058
Look, not only do
I get Cavaletti,

1218
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,807
but the Sheriff
gets his man too.

1219
01:15:58,137 --> 01:16:00,856
That's right, Dolemite is
over at Cavaletti's right now.

1220
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,900
There's a war going
on between em.

1221
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,852
Guess who else is over there?

1222
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:07,359
Red and Fingers, our
two pals from the East

1223
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:09,031
the hitmen.

1224
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:10,608
Remember them?

1225
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:12,113
Right.

1226
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,621
What's the address monkey?

1227
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:18,324
- $25, baby.

1228
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,337
- I got enough shit on

1229
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,377

1230
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:24,956

1232
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,805
(crowd murmurs)

1233
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:37,050
- Hey Joe?

1234
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,306
Joe?

1235
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,401
- Well it's about
time you got here.

1236
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:55,031
Come on put your
things in there,

1237
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,034
and come join the party.

1238
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,628
(crickets chirp)

1239
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,893
- Say white boy, come
out here in the light

1240
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:28,648
cause tonight is the night.

1241
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,525
Come out here and you can see

1242
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:34,576
some genuine American
Indian turquoise jewelry.

1243
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,868
I got to sell this
shit and sell it quick,

1244
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,571
I got to get outta town.

1245
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,624
Wait a minute white boy
fool, wait a minute.

1246
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:42,120
I'm selling this shit cheap.

1247
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:44,409
I'm gonna let you take the
shit off your old lady.

1248
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:45,931
She might give you
some pussy tonight,

1249
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:47,459
if you know what to do with it.

1250
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,337
Wait a minute fool,
we'll take this then.

1251
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,340
(combat sounds)

1252
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:04,764
- Hey everybody.

1253
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:06,644
Got a special surprise for you.

1254
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,648
Cavaletti just hired a new
man, and he's one of the boys.

1255
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,105
And for this evening's
entertainment,

1256
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:13,678
he's going to demonstrate to us

1257
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:17,406
how he became Central America's
champ at nunchuck sticks.

1258
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:24,541
(crowd murmurs)

1259
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:47,307
(crowd applauds)

1260
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,233
(doorbell rings)

1261
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:53,612
- Catering service here sir.

1262
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:06,042
Where do you want this stuff?

1263
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:16,753
Looks like you're having
a real nice party.

1264
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:19,884
- Sure am.

1265
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:21,716
Put the stuff in the kitchen.

1266
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:23,346
Too bad you wasn't invited boy.

1267
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:24,768
- Yeah it is.

1268
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:26,437
(chuckles)

1269
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,149
- Say baby, let's you
and me go take a swim.

1270
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:35,237
- I don't have a suit on sugar.

1271
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,439
- Suit? It's a private pool.

1272
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:45,490
- In that case, what
are we waiting for?

1273
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,980
- Say the young lady that was
with the guy with the glasses

1274
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:53,585
is she a friend of yours?

1275
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:55,712
- Oh yes, she's one of my girls.

1276
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:11,186
(combat sounds)

1277
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:19,281

(water splashes)

1279
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,876
- Hey there Momma, what it is?

1280
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:39,584
- Queen.

1281
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,215
- You got Red.

1282
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:45,224
I can't believe it.

1283
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:48,098
Now I have to kill
both of ya's myself.

1284
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:50,020
Alright ladies this way.

1285
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:51,768
Come on, move!

1286
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,101
That's far enough.

1287
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:02,108
Turn around!

1288
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,576
(gunfire)

1289
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:22,508

(man speaks gibberish)

1305

(man chokes)

1312
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:40,363
(man speaks gibberish)

1313
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:46,075
- Look out!

1314
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:47,284
(gunshot)

1315
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:52,090
(Jimmy groans)

1316
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:58,006
(drum roll)

1317
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,305
(Jimmy groans)

1318
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:15,443
- Y'all take care of Jimmy.

1319
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:20,202
I'm gonna get that
motherfucking Cavaletti

1320
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:22,746
if it is the last thing I do.

1321
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:27,250
- Jimmy...

1322
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:28,919
Jimmy.

1323
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:33,975
- Pack your things, we're
getting out of here fast.

1324
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:34,591
- What's the matter honey?

1325
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:36,018
- Don't ask questions dammit,

1326
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:37,043
just get dressed.

1327
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:40,547
- Can you hear me?

1328
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:42,007
It's your brother Bo.

1329
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:43,512
(Jimmy groans)

1330
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:47,475

01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,355
Jimmy...

1332
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:00,818
Don't die on me man.

1333
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:05,322
Come on, now get your shit together.

1334
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:07,703
Come on now.

1335
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:09,033
- Bo.

1336
01:28:10,494 --> 01:28:12,371
- He's just playing.

1337
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,124
He's just playing.

1338
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,460
Come on stop acting man, get up.

1339
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:21,676
- Bo!

1340
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:27,261
- My brother man.

1341
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:32,183
My brother.

1342
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:38,610
- He's gone man.

1343
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:43,155
- Come on.

1344
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:46,533

1345
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:48,908
- Come on let's go.

1346
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:50,959
- Going somewhere
Cavaletti, baby?

1347
01:28:51,284 --> 01:28:53,082
- Get outta here.

1348
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,005
- Let me go!

1349
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:59,084
(combat sounds)

1350
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,025
- Hold it everyone!

1351
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,018
- Police!

1352
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:21,190
- Freeze everybody, freeze!

1353
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:23,696
- Nobody move.

1354
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:32,330
(gunfire)

1355
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:36,250
Come here.

1356
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,002
Where's Cavaletti?

1357
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,425
Where is he?

1358
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:47,136
- Hold it, out, out.

1359
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:51,061
Out!

1360
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:01,150
- I got money.

1361
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:02,856
A lot of money.

1362
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:04,611
Here.. Here in this bag.

1363
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:07,990
You can take it,
take all you want.

1364
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,994
Only let me get the
fuck outta here.

1365
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:13,246
Please.

1366
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:16,124
- Beg little puppy
you like a big dog.

1367
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:18,921
Give you a little
bit, and I'd be damned

1368
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:20,840
if you don't want it all.

1369
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:24,261
I'll take that money
and I'll use it well

1370
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:27,556
cause you got a one way
ticket straight to hell.

1371
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,467
Now get in the car and move.

1372
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,892
- No, don't do it!

1373
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:33,515
Don't do it goddammit!

1374
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:34,937
- What is it Pete?

1375
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,982
- It's Cavaletti, and he's
about to get his nuts blown off,

1376
01:30:38,308 --> 01:30:40,402
and by your boy Sheriff.

1377
01:30:41,728 --> 01:30:42,854
- Cover em.

1378
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,489
(engine starts)

1379
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:07,174
(old lady laughs)

1380
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:09,006
- Oh goodie, son

1381
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:11,888
you've brought old
momma a customer.

1382
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:17,097
- You got that right
you decrepit old witch.

1383
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,182
But this time it's him.

1384
01:31:19,516 --> 01:31:21,234
Now move!

1385
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:28,991
What goes around comes around.

1386
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:32,116
Now it's yo turn to die
you no business barred

1387
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:36,040
insecure rat soup
eating motherfucker.

1388
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:38,164
And if you don't die
you're gonna wish

1389
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:40,712
to hell you hada.

1390
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:45,087
(Cavaletti screams)

1391
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:55,761
- Son of a bitch.

1392
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:08,407
(Cavaletti cries)

1393
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:10,909
- Where is Dolemite?

1394
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:12,861
Where is Dolemite?

1395
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,617
Where is that son of a
bitch named Dolemite?

1396
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:17,699
Where is he?

1397
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:20,127
- Sheriff, leave him alone!

1398
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:38,182
(gunfire)

1399
01:32:38,511 --> 01:32:40,263

1401
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:47,445
(Dolemite grunts)

1402
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:52,780
- Son of a bitch!

1403
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:55,157
(chuckles)

1404
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:57,831

1405
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:07,374
Your career is over stud.

(laughs)

1408
01:33:40,115 --> 01:33:42,994
