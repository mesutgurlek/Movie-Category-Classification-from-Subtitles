I don't think the investment plan's
quite as simple as you're making out.

- Come here.
- Come off it, Ripley, stop messing about.

you know.

Barry's a bit deaf, anyway.
And he's not married, so no real offence.

Is it someone I might approve
of this time?

86
00:04:58,175 --> 00:04:59,244
I doubt it.

to hang around with the likes of us.

She's a student now. Here, go on.

00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:09,244
- You go and have a good time.
- I will.

91
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:13,413
- Not bad for a thick kid, eh?
- Not bad at all.

92
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:16,723
You know anything
about this new boyfriend of hers?

93
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:18,487
I didn't know she had a new boyfriend.

94
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:21,009
He's got to be an improvement
on that biker, hasn't he?

95
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:23,484
- Special needs meets Special Brew.
- Don't exaggerate.

96
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:25,566
Anyway, she's got to make
her own mistakes.

97
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:27,885
You mean she hasn't finished
making them yet?

98
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:31,286
Thank you so much for coming.
We really appreciate it.

- What?

Those lads there,
they're using a refill key.

00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:57,685
- I just hope all this is tax-deductible.
- I love this man. He never relaxes.

Do I know you at all?
You one of Allbright's lot?

456
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:07,374
No, I'm not local. They called me in
because they're overstretched.

457
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:10,974
Sort of like an emergency plumber,
but less well paid.

458
00:31:11,055 --> 00:31:12,727
So, you found the body?

459
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:16,292
I open the door, go over to the alarm,
start putting in the code

460
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,774
then I notice it's not on,

461
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:21,086
and then, there he is, in all his glory.

462
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:23,973
- Do you recognise him?
- Never seen him before in my life.

463
00:31:24,055 --> 00:31:27,934
- Do you want to take another look?
- Has anybody got a Rennie on them?

464
00:31:28,815 --> 00:31:32,364
I have a very nervous tummy
and this has set it off.

465
00:31:32,495 --> 00:31:34,531
Funnily enough. Somewhere.

466
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:37,490
I never leave home without antacids.

467
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:41,447
Keep them. I'm taking Kaolin
and Morphine on a trial basis.

468
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:49,772
No, I definitely don't know him.

469
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:53,451
Why would anybody do this? I just...

470
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:57,373
I locked up last night
and I opened up this morning.

471
00:31:59,815 --> 00:32:01,168
So how did he get in here?

472
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:15,814
We're filing it as a suspicious death for
now, just to keep the paperwork in order.

473
00:32:15,895 --> 00:32:17,692
Suspicious? It's miraculous.

474
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:21,051
He got through a locked door,
tripped the alarm, then killed himself.

475
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:23,046
What makes you think he killed himself?

476
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,047
I don't. I was making a joke.

477
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:29,844
Freud would say that your jokes revealed
a truth buried in your subconscious.

478
00:32:29,935 --> 00:32:32,574
Oh, what do you know?
A copper who's read a book.

479
00:32:33,175 --> 00:32:36,326
Well, if I'd read two books,
maybe I'd run an amusement arcade.

480
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:41,330
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I run a family entertainment centre.

481
00:32:42,575 --> 00:32:45,328
And I'm a crime-citizen
interface consultant.

482
00:32:47,575 --> 00:32:49,770
Political correctness strikes again.

483
00:32:50,255 --> 00:32:51,290
You know what?

484
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:56,486
I get Chinky lads down here all the time
and they tell me kung fu jokes.

485
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:01,045
We'll always find new insults.
Prejudice is very inventive like that.

486
00:33:03,095 --> 00:33:04,289
That's right.

487
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:08,247
You know what he's done, don't you?

488
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,843
He's hid behind the dance stage
while I'm locking up,

489
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:13,290
tried to rob the slots,
got himself electrocuted.

490
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:17,171
- Thanks for sorting that out for us.
- He looked the type, didn't he?

491
00:33:17,255 --> 00:33:18,574
You know, hair like that.

492
00:33:20,695 --> 00:33:23,892
I'll do everything I can to get you
open again as soon as possible.

493
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:27,607
- What, you're closing me down?
- Just till forensics are happy.

494
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:29,925
No, I know it's a tragic loss
and everything

495
00:33:30,015 --> 00:33:32,973
but I've got the biggest deal of my life
riding on this arcade.

496
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:34,647
You can read about it in here.

497
00:33:36,295 --> 00:33:37,569
Thanks.

498
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,091
I think I know where you're coming from.

499
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:49,014
Scruffy bastard.

500
00:33:58,535 --> 00:34:00,412
So, what's the arcade chap like?

501
00:34:00,815 --> 00:34:02,885
- A prick.
- A guilty prick?

502
00:34:03,255 --> 00:34:06,372
A prick has no conscience.
Didn't your father tell you anything?

503
00:34:06,655 --> 00:34:08,964
His story seems a little unlikely.

504
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:13,170
Acquire an ID on the body, go through
the CCTV from the pubs and clubs...

505
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:15,728
talk to witnesses.

506
00:34:16,215 --> 00:34:20,174
The gruelling but necessary slog that
makes our police force enviable.

507
00:34:20,255 --> 00:34:23,008
- What are you going to do?
- I'll start with Ripley's wife.

508
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:25,849
I'm good with wives.

509
00:34:27,095 --> 00:34:29,563
A dead man? Just there on the floor?

510
00:34:29,655 --> 00:34:33,330
Dead as Southport he was. Six feet
from the kiddies rides. How sick is that?

511
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:35,883
That is awful. Who was he?

512
00:34:36,655 --> 00:34:39,647
I don't know. Neither do the police.
Some deadbeat or other.

513
00:34:39,735 --> 00:34:41,248
It'd be a deadbeat. That's right.

514
00:34:41,335 --> 00:34:44,054
- I've had to close the arcade.
- How long for?

515
00:34:44,135 --> 00:34:46,729
So what did they think?
The coppers. They got any ideas?

516
00:34:46,815 --> 00:34:48,089
Have they heck!

517
00:34:48,175 --> 00:34:50,530
They'll just tit around for a few days
and file it away.

518
00:34:50,615 --> 00:34:54,005
Got to look like they're earning
the tax payers' shilling, haven't they?

519

Love?

522
00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:16,530
He's finished with me by text.

523
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:18,734
How cheap is that?

524
00:35:19,975 --> 00:35:20,964
So...

525
00:35:22,175 --> 00:35:24,325
no explanation or anything?

526
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:28,445
Just said it wasn't working for him.

527
00:35:28,935 --> 00:35:31,369
He was sorry. That was it.

528
00:35:31,535 --> 00:35:33,730
Oh, cheap bastard, eh?

529
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:37,844
I don't know what you're getting angry
about. I could tell you didn't like him.

530
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:42,725
I'll be straight. You know, I did have
a few problems about the age difference

531
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:44,965
but only because
I want what's best for you.

532
00:35:45,575 --> 00:35:46,974
Well, he is.

533
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:49,849
I love him, Dad.

534
00:35:51,535 --> 00:35:54,732
And don't you start telling me
I'll get over it.

535
00:35:55,175 --> 00:35:56,369
Look at me.

536
00:35:56,775 --> 00:35:58,413
Hey, look at me.

537
00:36:00,335 --> 00:36:04,806
When I was your age, I was the loneliest
bastard on this bastard planet.

538
00:36:04,975 --> 00:36:08,968
And the worst thing was people telling
me it was going to get better...

539
00:36:11,215 --> 00:36:16,084
But for what it's worth, you're a
beautiful, intelligent young woman.

540
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:19,813
And the man you're gonna spend
the rest of your life with

541
00:36:19,895 --> 00:36:21,533
is out there now, somewhere.

542
00:36:21,615 --> 00:36:23,367
You've not even met him yet.

543
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:27,211
Isn't that something
to get excited about?

544
00:36:28,295 --> 00:36:29,648
I suppose.

545
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,892
Steve's a bigger prick than I thought
he was to finish with you.

546
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:36,047
- You were doing well till that last bit.
- Come here.

547
00:36:43,255 --> 00:36:45,894
You don't think Mum warned him off
or anything, do you?

548
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:48,804
No.

549
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:53,370
Your mum's a bit of a hothead,
but she'd never do anything like that.

550
00:36:56,655 --> 00:36:59,772
So that's the last
we'll be seeing of Steve, I suppose.

551
00:36:59,935 --> 00:37:01,732
Broke the poor girl's heart.

552
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:06,049
- Quite a coincidence though, isn't it?
- What's that?

553
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:10,044
You meet him, you don't like him, and
the next day he finishes with Shyanne.

554
00:37:10,255 --> 00:37:13,008
Yeah, that's why it's called coincidence,
I suppose.

555
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,445
I didn't know you believed
in coincidence.

556
00:37:15,855 --> 00:37:19,404
I run an amusement arcade.
Of course, I believe in coincidence.

557
00:37:19,495 --> 00:37:21,645
How else could I look the punter
in the eye?

558
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:24,648
Yeah, well, maybe we'll leave that one
for another day.

559
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,968
Are you feeling horny at all?

560
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:43,447
I love it when you whisper
sweet nothings.

561
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:45,848
Is that a yes or a no?

562
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:49,129
Well, a little more effort might be nice.

563
00:37:49,215 --> 00:37:52,651
You know, something a bit romantic.

564
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:55,329
- Do you want to talk about it?
- Piss off, Ripley.

565
00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:58,286
Now who's being romantic?

(BLYTHE) Ripley Holden used to own
three arcades off Promenade

571
00:40:44,215 --> 00:40:48,094
but he sold them all 6 months ago to bid
for this Promenade site when it came up.

572
00:40:48,175 --> 00:40:50,484
- He's got a lot riding on it.
- He's a great salesman.

573
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:51,690
Says who?

574
00:40:51,775 --> 00:40:54,414
It's what I've been getting
from everybody I've spoken to.

575
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:58,374
He believes in family, money
and Blackpool. Not always in that order.

576
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:00,764
What about the family?
What did you get on them?

577
00:41:00,855 --> 00:41:03,050
Danny, the son, goes to a private school

578

he might be dabbling in soft drugs.

Well, who didn't at his age?

- I'll report back to you once I've met her.

585

The question is,
what's she doing with Ripley Holden?

586
00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:33,091
Oh, Blythe, one day you'll fall in love

587
00:41:33,175 --> 00:41:37,851
and you'll find out that the heart
is a complicated and capricious organ.

588
00:41:39,215 --> 00:41:41,126
Right. Back to the arcade then, is it?

589
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:44,446
Yeah. For me, I'm gonna get a list
of key holders off Ripley Holden.

We did. And he wasn't.

607
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:39,129
The early signs are that he'd been dead
for a day or so before you found him.

608
00:42:39,215 --> 00:42:40,409
So he were dumped here?

609
00:42:40,495 --> 00:42:42,690
Well, you see, I attract a lot of jealousy.

610

Because we don't like success
in this country, do we?

611
00:42:45,495 --> 00:42:48,692
So I'd start with the anti-gambling mob
and the other arcade owners.

612
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:53,166
But not my staff. No way. They love
working here. They're like family.

It's complicated.

What's complicated? You're the big
cheese. Give him the red card.

638

He's from outside the town.
He's been sent across from Kendal.

What is it he's done
to upset you exactly?

He thinks me and my staff have got
something to do with that lad's death.

You might not care about that

644
00:44:28,615 --> 00:44:31,971
but you should care that he's shut
the arcade and he's keeping it shut.

645

Which means nobody makes any money.
Not me. Not you. Not anybody.

758
00:53:23,255 --> 00:53:24,529
No.

759
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:29,484
Are you sure?
Because we've got you and him on CCTV

760
00:53:29,575 --> 00:53:32,806
going into Romeo's
within ten minutes of each other.

761
00:53:32,895 --> 00:53:36,285
I didn't see him there.
I never saw him after he left this place.

762
00:53:37,455 --> 00:53:38,570
He was here?

763
00:53:40,455 --> 00:53:42,810
At the arcade opening night?
Are you sure?

764
00:53:43,135 --> 00:53:46,445
Of course I'm sure. You could hardly
miss hair like that, could you?

765
00:53:46,535 --> 00:53:50,448
Okay, Braveheart.
What do you think you're doing?

766
00:53:50,735 --> 00:53:54,808
I'm just trying to ascertain
where science ends and luck begins.

767
00:53:54,935 --> 00:53:57,324
You're talking to my son. He's a minor.

768
00:53:57,495 --> 00:54:00,373
You don't talk to my son
without me being there, understand?

769
00:54:00,455 --> 00:54:02,491
Okay. I'll just collect my winnings.

770
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:11,373
Mr Holden, just one question
and I'll be gone.

771
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,492
- What do you want to know?
- What's an AWP?

772
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:20,254
Amusement with Prizes. Like that
machine you've just been playing.

773
00:54:20,335 --> 00:54:22,326
I see. Amusement with Prizes.

774
00:54:24,335 --> 00:54:26,405
Sounds a bit like life itself, doesn't it?

775
00:54:27,215 --> 00:54:29,683
And you are absolutely sure

776
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:32,735
you didn't see him here
at your opening night party?

777
00:54:32,855 --> 00:54:35,130
Absolutely. You know why?

778
00:54:35,215 --> 00:54:38,412
Because he wasn't here that night.
Now, are you sure of your way out?
