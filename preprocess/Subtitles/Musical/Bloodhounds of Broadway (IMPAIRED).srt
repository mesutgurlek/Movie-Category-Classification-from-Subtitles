goes around gettin' spliced.

737
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,684
But in your case, I advise it.

738
00:49:06,752 --> 00:49:09,084
Subconscious, you want to marry Yvonne.
The dream proves it.

739
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,520
- Yvonne?
- Not Yvonne?

740
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,218
She ain't in the dream.
That I know.

741
00:49:14,293 --> 00:49:16,693
- Why? Must she be? There's a law?
- No.

742
00:49:16,762 --> 00:49:21,096
Only she saved our necks.
And get her sore, and-Well, a doll's a doll.

743
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,100
You know, they don't
think like guys.

744
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,227
And on top of that,
the crime committee's coming back.

745

Aw, can it, you and this- this love.

746

Your marbles ain't loose, they're cracked.
Take the dogs to the park.

They wanna chase things up and down trees.

- Then walk 'em on the street.

Hello.

- Yvonne, you know what I've been doing.

00:49:51,664 --> 00:49:57,102
Your philanthropy. Of course. It must be exciting
helping out homeless but beautiful girls.

thrown me over, that's what. Don't say no.

- Nobody else.

766

And with an investigator
from the new crime committee.

767
00:50:26,298 --> 00:50:29,131
This guy asked me if
I'll, uh, testify again.

768
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:31,999
- Oh, yeah? And just what did you say?
- Oh, don't look so worried.

769
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:37,941
I nixed it. After all,
I'm still your doll... I hope.

770

What do you mean, you hope?

771

- You are.
- Well, how was I to know?

772

Things aren't as they were.

773

We don't go out together
or anything anymore.

774

- And I miss you.
- Tell you what.

775

Emily Ann tries out today.
If she's okay, my worries are over.

776
00:50:53,959 --> 00:50:56,154
She'll have a job where I can
keep my eye on her.

777

So maybe you and me'll do
a little celebrating tonight.

- I don't want her to work at the Dude's.
- Why not?

782
00:51:12,544 --> 00:51:16,344

Well, anyhow, I know him.

~ And who came aboard ~

1315
01:27:00,631 --> 01:27:04,727
~ But Lily the flower of the South ~

1316
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:10,670
~ She was as shy as a violet ~

1317
01:27:10,741 --> 01:27:14,233
~ A picture so sweet ~

1318
01:27:14,311 --> 01:27:18,839
~ That sugar cane would melt
right in her mouth ~

1319
01:27:22,486 --> 01:27:26,513
~ She looked at Jack O'Diamonds
and his heart was aflame ~

1320
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:30,651
~ She smiled at Jack O'Diamonds
and suggested a game ~

1321
01:27:30,727 --> 01:27:34,993
~ He opened strong with jacks
but Lily didn't give beans ~

1322
01:27:35,065 --> 01:27:38,592
~ She topped his jack of diamonds
with a couple of queens ~

1323
01:27:38,669 --> 01:27:42,503
~ She topped his jack of diamonds
with a couple of queens ~

1324
01:27:42,573 --> 01:27:46,737
~ And as the crowd gathered round
he started dealing with skill ~

1325
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:50,007
~ Displaying his celebrated art ~

1326
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:54,312
~ And though he pulled every trick
it wasn't long until Lil ~

1327
01:27:54,384 --> 01:27:57,979
~ Relieved him of his bankroll
and his heart ~

1328
01:27:58,055 --> 01:28:01,991
~ And now with Jack O'Diamonds
facing terrible times ~

1329
01:28:02,059 --> 01:28:05,893
~ He's down to penny-ante games
for nickels and dimes ~

1330
01:28:05,963 --> 01:28:10,366
~ And as the Mississippi
paddle wheeler departs ~

1331
01:28:10,434 --> 01:28:12,732
~ He's left without his glory ~

1332
01:28:13,804 --> 01:28:16,102
~ And the moral of the story ~

1333
01:28:17,307 --> 01:28:20,037
~ Is that Jack O'Diamonds ~

1334
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:22,101
~ Shouldn't trifle ~

1335
