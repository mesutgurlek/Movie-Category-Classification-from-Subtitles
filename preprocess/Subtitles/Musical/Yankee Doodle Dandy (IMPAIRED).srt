Well, I'd settle for his age.

There never was anything dull
about his life, either.

Don't worry, Dad. I'll never do that.

worked well for a long time.

Yeah, now that it's all over,
who was the senior partner...

1930
01:49:08,125 --> 01:49:09,667
...and who was the junior partner?

1931
01:49:09,668 --> 01:49:11,669
You mean, who was Dietz
and who was Goff?

1932
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:15,965
Well, I bet it's the first firm in the history
of show business had two senior partners.

1933
01:49:15,966 --> 01:49:18,301
Well, uh, you know how I feel,
don't you, Sam?

1934
01:49:18,302 --> 01:49:20,344
Sure. I understand.

1935
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:23,639
You know, when Dad died, with him went
the last link with The Four Cohans.

01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:27,602
All the backslapping and the applause,
well, it became unimportant.

No more fun in it.

ever even heard of us.

[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]

2097
01:57:26,665 --> 01:57:29,293
[SINGING] It's really a wonderful job

2098
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:32,920
For fellows like George,
Abe and me too

2099
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:35,839
It's great to shake hands with a mob

2100
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:39,051
And to hold every kid
on your knee too

2101
01:57:39,052 --> 01:57:42,346
Every word that I speak
Goes into headlines

2102
01:57:42,347 --> 01:57:45,349
When I speak
All the papers hold their deadlines

2103
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:47,935
But I have found a way
Of dropping a hint

2104
01:57:47,936 --> 01:57:52,022
Or a glint of the truth
That the boys cannot print

2105
01:57:52,023 --> 01:57:53,607
For instance

2106
01:57:53,608 --> 01:57:55,655
For instance

2107
01:57:58,363 --> 01:58:00,072
When I was courting Eleanor

2108
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:02,950
I told her Uncle Teddy
I wouldn't run for president

2109
01:58:02,951 --> 01:58:04,702
Unless the job was steady

2110
01:58:04,703 --> 01:58:07,626
Don't print it
Strictly off the record

2111
01:58:07,789 --> 01:58:11,041
We entertained the royalty
But we were never flustered

2112
01:58:11,042 --> 01:58:14,253
We gave them Yankee hot dogs
With Colman's English Mustard

2113

Don't print it
Strictly off the record

2114
01:58:17,299 --> 01:58:20,384
It's pleasant at the White House
But I'll tell you how I feel

2115
01:58:20,385 --> 01:58:23,554
The food is simply terrible
Just sauerkraut and veal

2116
01:58:23,555 --> 01:58:26,724
If Mrs. R. would stay at home
I'd get a decent meal

2117
01:58:26,725 --> 01:58:29,648
But that's off the record

2118
01:59:08,058 --> 01:59:09,642
When I go up to Hyde Park

2119
01:59:09,643 --> 01:59:11,310
It's not for just the ride there

2120
01:59:11,311 --> 01:59:12,853
It's not that I like Hyde Park

2121
01:59:12,854 --> 01:59:14,647
But I love to park and hide there

2122

Don't print it
It's strictly off the record

2123
01:59:17,651 --> 01:59:20,778
I sit up in my study
Writing gags for Mr. Ickes

2124
01:59:20,779 --> 01:59:22,404
And insults for the gentlemen

2125
01:59:22,405 --> 01:59:24,073
Who'd love to slip him Mickeys

2126

Don't print that
Off the record

2127
01:59:42,801 --> 01:59:46,095
I scrapped the Prohibition Act
When we required a bracer

2128
01:59:46,096 --> 01:59:49,390
And finished up the Boulder Dam
To give the boys a chaser

2129

Don't print it

Who complain about the taxes

The ax out of the Axis?

I can't forget how Lafayette
Helped give us our first chance

2134
02:00:05,156 --> 02:00:08,242
To win our fight for liberty
And now they've taken France

2135
02:00:08,243 --> 02:00:11,328
We'll take it back from Hitler
And put ants in his Ja-pants

Good work, kids. I'll see
you at 11 in the morning.

2139
02:00:35,437 --> 02:00:38,690
And then came your wire,
and I was really worried.

2140

Well, here I am going on like Tennyson's
book, giving you the story of my life.

I'm sorry. You should've stopped me.

2142

Why, I wanted to hear
the story of your life.

2143
02:00:46,948 --> 02:00:50,534
It has a direct bearing
on my sending for you.

2144

I congratulate you, Mr. Cohan.

I understand you're the first person
of your profession to receive this honor.

Oh, I am proud.

2152
02:01:21,775 --> 02:01:23,525
In fact, I'm flabbergasted.

2153
02:01:23,526 --> 02:01:25,778
First time in my life,
I'm speechless.

2154
02:01:25,779 --> 02:01:28,530
Uh... You're sure there
isn't some mistake?

2155

Quite sure.

2156
02:01:31,618 --> 02:01:35,370
This medal is for people who've given their
lives for their country or done something big.

I'm just a song-and-dance man.
Everybody knows that.

A man may give his life to his country
in many different ways, Mr. Cohan.

And quite often, he isn't the best judge
of how much he has given.

2160
02:01:47,383 --> 02:01:51,053
Your songs were a symbol
of the American spirit.

2161

"Over There" was just as powerful
a weapon as any cannon...

...as any battleship we had
in the first World War.

Today, we're all soldiers.
We're all on the front.

We need more songs
to express America.

will give them to us.

begun to earn this medal.

It's quite a thing.

that I'm not the only one that's grateful.

My mother thanks you,
my father thanks you...

...my sister thanks you,
and I assure you, I thank you.

And, uh, I wouldn't worry
about this country if I were you.

We've got this thing licked.

Where else could a plain guy like me come
in and talk things over with the head man?

2176
02:02:42,689 --> 02:02:45,190
Well, that's about as good
a definition of America...

...as any I've ever heard.
