He did ask me to go with his band.

103
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,900

only as a band singer.

Oh, perfectly.
And what experience have you had?

106
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,700
Well, I've sung once
with the Cincinnati Symphony.

I thoroughly approve
of both your face and contour.

Let's call that God's contribution.

a lot more than just a pair of pipes.

You've got to know how to walk,
how to smile, how to take a bow.

what to do with your hands.

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,100
Which reminds me,
where would you like to eat?

309
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,500
Don't ask me.
I'm a stranger in town.

310
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
But I'm feeling mighty rich.

311
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,000
- Let's go somewhere we can't afford.
- Spoken like a leading lady.

312
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,000
Taxi. Taxi!

313
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
Of course, if you'd take
my advice and get married...

314
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,600
you wouldn't have to worry
about where you're gonna eat.

315
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
We could just go home and eat.

316
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,900
- Please, let's not go into that again, not tonight.
- I'm sorry. I forgot.

317
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,500
- When you were five, your father
tipped his hat and rolled away...
- Don, it's nothing to joke about.

318
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,100
Taxi. Taxi!

319
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,800
So one marriage goes on the rocks.
Does that mean they all have to?

320
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,800
- I've seen too much of the other side of it.
- Okay, okay.

321
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,600
Consider it unsaid, like a letter
that didn't get sent.

322
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,300
But I can't forget it either. You've been
so wonderful to me, all your help...

323
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,000
Tell you what you do. Send me
a Christmas card signed "Gratefully yours."

Hey, taxi. Taxi!

325
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,800
You're so rich you can't
even get a taxicab.

326

Come on. Let's walk up an appetite.

there's only one town.

In the words of the, shall we say,
more conservative critics...

top air shows like
Palmolive, Coca-Cola, Buick.

383

You didn't need a crystal ball
to tell where all this was leading...

384
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,900
right straight to her selection
as the number one girl singer on the air.

385
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,900
Meanwhile, what about me?
Well, I'll bite. What about me?

386
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,900
Oh, I managed
a few jobs here and there.

Hittin' the Follies
in which Jane was a star.

388

The Pontiac program.
A trip to Hollywood for a movie test.

389
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,300
In fact, I was just
back from that.

390
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,600
But my real job...
my 24-hour-a-day job...

391
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,000
was increasingly Jane.

392
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
[Jane]
Yes? Who is it?

393
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,300
[Raspy Voice] Lady, I'm workin' my way
through barber college. I just wondered...

394
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,900
Don! I thought you were
still in California.

395
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,500
- We all make mistakes. How are you, baby?
- I am fine. Come on in.

396
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,500
- Miss me?
- Like a front tooth.

397
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,100
- You don't show it.
- You dog. Just because I've put on four pounds.

398
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,000
- Where?
- Where do you think?

399
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,200
I played 18 holes of golf yesterday
and rehearsed four hours trying to get it off.

400
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
What about you?
What about the picture?

401
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,300
If those birds think I'm gonna stay in Hollywood
just to play a stooge for Victor Mature...

402
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,600
- Eighteen holes, huh? What'd you shoot?
- Never mind that.

403
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,200
I was so in hopes this would be the break
you'd been waiting for.

404
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,300
You couldn't give me Hollywood.

405
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,700
Besides, if I'm out there, who's gonna run out
and get you a jar of cold cream?

406
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,000
Suppose it wasn't as good a part
as you'd hoped for.

407
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,500
It's not always the size
of the part that matters.

408
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
Maybe if you'd talked to them,
they'd have built it up.

409
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,400
Look, what's the use of kidding ourselves?
There wasn't any picture deal.

410
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,800
Just another wild-goose chase
that some screwball agent dreamed up.

411
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,600
But who cares?
The Chief gives you a nice ride.

412
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,000
I slept like a Monday night
audience both ways.

413
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,900
And now you.
What have you been up to, besides golf?

414
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,900
- Nothing of any interest.
- Is that so?

415
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,900
Then what's all this I read in Winchell's column
about you and that Long Island polo player?

416
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,500
Oh, him? He's all right. He's fun.
Not a brain in his head.

417
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,700
Mm-hmm.
And all these flowers?

418
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,500
From some garden club, no doubt?
Or do you send them to yourself?

419
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,400
- Mind if I take a peek?
- I'm not sure I should let you.

420
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,100
But go right ahead.
Help yourself.

421
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,000
Who's this one?

422
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,200
Oh, just somebody who's down
to his last million or two.

423
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,400
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Reduced to that, eh?

424
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,900
So much for him.
Now, you were saying?

425
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I wasn't saying anything.

426
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,600
But there was something you said about getting
me a jar of cold cream when I need it.

427
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,800
Oh, that's just a way of talking.
Mind if I fix myself a drink?

428
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,900
Of course not.
I'll fix it for you. What'll it be?

429
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,500
- Scotch.
- And soda?

430
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,500
A little.

431
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,900
You know, it's true.
I have let you do things for me.

432
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,400
I'm the slave type.
I like doing them.

433
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,900
- Listen, you wanna know something?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,500
I haven't got a polo pony to my name.
I haven't even got a million bucks.

435
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,100
- Imagine.
- But you know how I feel.

436
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,200
The question is,
how do you feel?

437
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,200
All kidding aside, don't you think
it's time we talked things over...

438
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,600
got something settled?

439
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,500
I don't know what to say, Don.

440
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,300
You've been so wonderful to me.
You've taught me so much.

441
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,600
- But you're not in love with me, is that it?
- I didn't say that.

442
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,900
It's just that,
well, I'm not sure.

443
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,800
You see,
I've never been in love before.

444
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,500
And you sort of expected someone
to come along, like a knight on horseback?

445
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,200
I suppose every girl looks forward
to a little fireworks.

446
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,300
You haven't been reading
True Confessions, have you?

447
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,900
It's possible.

448
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,900
It's also possible that
I'm in love with you.

449
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,600
Okay. That's good enough for me.
Let's say you are.

450
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,500
How about dropping down
to city hall with me some morning?

451
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,900
They tell me there's been
quite a run on marriages lately.

452
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,100
Maybe it's the war fever.
People hedging against the future.

453
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,600
Anyway, something's doing it.

454
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,000
- Do you really want me to do that, Don?
- Of course I do.

455
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,200
What do you think
I've been driving at all these months?

456
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:39,400
I've asked you so many times,
I'm beginning to sound like a roundelay.

457
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,300
Suppose I put it another way,

In addition to the 12 members
of the crew...

765
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,400
there were 27 passengers aboard.

766

Among them, seven entertainers
from the U.S. O...

767
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,500
a few businessmen,
several diplomats who...

768
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,800
believe it or not,
looked like diplomats...

769
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,500
and a brigadier general
of the air force...

770
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,800
an elderly flyer
of at least 34.

771
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,500
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have
your attention for a moment, please?

772
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,100
On behalf of Captain Donovan and the crew,
I want to welcome you aboard.

773
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,500
It's all right to unfasten your seat belts now.
If anyone's dying for a cigarette, go ahead.

774
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,400
- I say, what's the weather ahead?
- Very good, sir.

775
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,800
It's a little on the chilly side,
but indications are it'll be good all the way.

776
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,800
Now, for the benefit of those of you who may
be making your first transatlantic flight...

777
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,200
or who may be worrying
about the war...

778
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:36,100
all I can say is this ship has made
240 crossings without being shot at once.

779
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,800
Captain Donovan has flown at least
a hundred crossings himself.

780
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,400
By the way,
my name is John Burn.

781
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,700
I'm fourth officer aboard,
which means I'm third copilot.

782
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,800
If there's anything that I or the stewards
can do to make your flight more comfortable...

783
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,800
please sing out.

784
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,800
Incidentally, each of you
has been assigned a seat.

785
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,700
We'll appreciate it if you occupy
the same seat on all takeoffs and landings.

786
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,200
I've forgotten why,
but the company prefers it that way.

787
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,300
Which leads me to this.

788
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,200
This is called a Mae West.

is very unlikely...

it's still my duty to acquaint
you with our landing procedure just in case.

it's practically irresistible.

- Just a little.

There you are.

Uh, maybe you'd better do that.

- Can you get 'em out?
- I think so. Here we are.

805
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,000
That's right.
Now, just a simple knot.

about such things, a bow.

they're chewing their nails off with envy.

And thank you,

01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,300
- Feel good?
- Oh, words fail me.

914
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,300
Nothing in the world like it.

915
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,900
I know.
I can stand pain... anything.

916
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,500
But to itch and not
be able to scratch it...

917
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,100
that I can't stand.

918
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:57,000
The man who thought of making these
knitting needles out of plastic...

919
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,400
so he can go around corners
ought to get a D.S.C.

920
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,400
D.S.C., my eye.
He oughta be canonized.

921
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,900
- Ah, Miss Stomach Bump of 1943.
- All right.

922
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
- Open your traps and swallow these down.
- Not again.

923
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:12,800
You oughta be grateful I'm not still
stickin' you in the caboose with a needle.

924
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,700
- Here you are.
- [John] Thank you.

925
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:21,400
[Gasps]
Mercy me! If it isn't a reptile!

926
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,200
- How'd this get in here?
- Why, I haven't the slightest idea.

927
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,200
- Go on. Drink it.
- Me? Drink that?

928
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,500
- Down the hatch.
- What are you trying to do, poison me?

929
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,100
- It's a tempting idea.
- General, you ought to be ashamed of yourself...

930
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,900
scaring a poor angel
of mercy like Clancy.

931
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Listen. You couldn't scare
this Flatbush Florence Nightingale...

932
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,600
- with Rommel's whole Africa Corps.
- Is that so?

933
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:45,500
Well, for that crack you're going to eat
intravenously from now on.

934
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,100
Wait a minute, Clancy. There's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

935
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,600
First of all, how did you ever
get to be a nurse?

936
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,600
Second, what are
you doing over here?

937
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,000
Question one:
I was hit over the head...

938
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,000
with a pair
of forceps at birth...

939
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,500
and when I came to,
I was in uniform.

940
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,500
Question two:
When the war broke out...

941
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,600
I joined an ambulance corps
from Flatbush to get away from my relatives.

942
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,500
- Does that answer you?
- Right on the nose.

943
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,800
Okay. Here we go,
General Pershing.

944
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,800
Hey! Give us back our frog.

945
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:16,200
Ask the mother superior for it.

946
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,700
- She's gonna find it in her bed tomorrow morning.
- [Jane Laughing]

947
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,700
- Don't you just love her?
- I'm crazy about her.

948
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,400
I'd probably elope with her
if I weren't already in love with you.

949
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,200
Oh, stop it.

950
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,200
I mean it, Jane.

951
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,700
I had no right to say that, did I?

952
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,700
No.

953
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,000
Even though it's true?

954
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I know you're not happy
the way things have been.

955
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,600
- [Door Opens]
- Good morning.

956
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,600
Oh, good morning, Father.

957
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,800
- How are you feeling today?
- Very well, thank you.

958
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,800
Good.

959
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,700
[Door Closes]

960
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,300
Shall I go on?

961
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,500
Or have I already said too much?

962
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,800
I admit there's a bond between us.

963
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,900
That's only natural
after all we've been through.

964
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,600
And then being here together
every day since the accident...

965
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,600
It's more than that.

966
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,900
You know it.

967
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,800
Ever since that first night,
we've clung to each other.

968
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,800
We've depended on each other.

969
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,900
Maybe that's because
we like the same things...

970
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,300
the same books, the same music.

971
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:43,100
Jane, people can't go through
what we've been through...

972
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,800
and then go right on acting
as if nothing had happened.

973
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,200
[Door Opens]

974
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,900
- Pardon me, but somebody's got company.
- Hi.

975
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,500
- Don!
- Remember me?

976
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,700
- Where in the world...
- Flew over. How else? F.D.R. Gave us a priority.

977
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,400
Wants me to bring you on home.

978
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:02,000
Let me look at you. I didn't know
what to expect, a crack-up like that...

979
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,100
- but you look swell.
- Well, I'm all right.

980
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,400
They tell me you're gonna be fine.
Maybe a little operation or two on the leg...

981
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,400
but at least
everything's under control.

982
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,100
That's what they tell me too.
I hope they're right.

983
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,300
Don, this is Mr. Burn.
John, my husband, Don Ross.

984
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,600
- Oh, so you’re John Burn,
one of the pilots. How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

985
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,900
And this is Clancy. Miss Clancy.

986
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,400
- We met.
- Yes, in the room.

987
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,900
Look. I've got passage for us...

988
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,800
on a Portuguese steamer
sailing next Tuesday.

989
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:31,200
It may be a little rugged, but I want to get
you home where we can really take care of you.

990
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,500
- Think you can make it?
- We'll make it.

991
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,500
Clancy! You'll go with us?

992
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,400
Remember those relatives
I was telling you about?

993
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,700
I just got a wire.
Two of them have been drafted.

994
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,200
They're just as likely
to show up even here.

995
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,300
So it's back to Flatbush for me.

996
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,400
- You ready to go to your room?
- Uh, yes, please.

997
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,400
Why don't you
come with us, Mr. Burn?

998
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,200
- I think I can fix it.
- Thanks. I'll wait and fly back.

999
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,500
But, John,
I thought you said we'd...

1000
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,900
Sorry, l...

1001
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,900
It's nice to have met you, Mr. Ross.

1002
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,500
Yeah, sure.
Glad to have met you.

1003
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,000
- See you later.
- You bet.

1004
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,400
- Seems like a nice guy.
- He is.

1005
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:15,400
- Hurt bad?
- His back... a couple of fractured vertebrae.

1006
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,400
Tell me, did you have
a nice flight over?

1007
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:21,200
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Just a breeze.
Not a bump all the way.

1008
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,900
[Don Narrating]
And then home sweet home...

1009
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:29,200
through submarine infested waters
and straight into another hospital.

1010
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,500
They'd done their best
for her in Lisbon.

1011
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,100
But now she needed
more than the best.

1012
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:37,100
She needed a miracle.

1013
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,700
Oh, excuse me, Doctor.
I didn't know you were here.

1014
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,200
- That's all right, Sister.
- I can come back later.

1015
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,200
No, no. Come in.

1016
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,300
- Aren't they lovely?
- [Jane] Beautiful.

1017
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,100
Wouldn't you like one
for your lapel, Doctor?

1018
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:00,300
- May I?
- All doctors should wear roses in their lapels.

1019
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,000
Then maybe they wouldn't look
so serious and so infallible.

1020
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,500
Also prettier.

1021
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,900
I'll take those, Sister.
Thank you.

1022
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,100
You must have a rich admirer.
Anybody I know?

1023
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:17,600
- John Burn.
- Burn? He sent those all the way from Lisbon?

1024
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,800
Well, he arrived
in New York this morning.

1025
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,200
Pretty quick work.

1026
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,000
Well, Doctor?

1027
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:35,000
Am I still photogenic?

1028
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,900
It's a beautiful picture, but I'm afraid
it's not such a pretty break.

1029
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,200
That bone's not knitting
the way it should.

1030
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,500
What are we gonna do about it?

1031
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,200
I know. Let's send it out
to Max Factor in Hollywood.

1032
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,300
He makes over old faces.
Maybe he can make over an old leg.

1033
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:53,900
[Chuckling]
Well, that's a possibility.

1034
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:56,600
In the meanwhile,
I would say a bone graft is indicated.

1035
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:00,200
And that's a very delicate operation.
I can't guarantee success.

1036
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,600
What percentage of such operations
are successful, Doctor?

1037
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,500
Oh, between 50% and 60%.

1038
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,500
A great deal depends on the patient.

1039
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,900
A good patient, one with a lot
of desire to get well...

1040
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,200
can make a bad doctor
look awfully good.

1041
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:17,700
- Are you a good patient?
- Terrible. I'll probably kick and howl.

1042
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,200
- When will you operate?
- Personally, I would say the sooner the better.

1043
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,200
What would you say
about tomorrow?

1044
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,200
Well, I was booked to ride
in the fourth at Belmont tomorrow.

1045
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,000
- You can always be scratched.
- Then see that I am, Clancy.

1046
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,400
No use our keeping the doctor on pins
and needles any longer than we have to.

1047
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:38,100
Will you come with me, Mr. Ross? I want
to show these to Dr. Jameson, my associate.

1048
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,400
- I'd like you to be present.
- Of course.

1049
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,400
Take it easy.
I'll be right back.

1050
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,100
They're gonna
take my leg off, Clancy.

1051
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:55,900
Who said so?

1052
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,300
He didn't have to say so.
I know.

1053
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,200
Ah, you don't want
to pay any attention to doctors.

1054
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:06,300
They gotta view with alarm,
so that later they can point with pride.

1055
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,600
You know?
Like... Like politicians.

1056
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:21,500
[Phone Ringing]

1057
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,500
I'll get it.

1058
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,600
Hello?

1059
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,200
Well, welcome home.

1060
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,800
[Chuckling]
Sure, I'm true to you. Wait a minute.

- Don't be so nosy. Here.

01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:41,100
- Hello?
- Hi.

1063
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,700
John! Where are you?

1064
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,700
Doctor's Hospital.

1065
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,200
I'm in the X-ray room trying to find out
when they're gonna take this crate off me...

1066
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,200
after which, in case
you didn't suspect it...

1067
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,500
I'm gonna beat a path
right straight to your door.

1068
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,100
What do you know about that?

1069
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:02,500
Well, l... I'm not gonna be able
to see anybody for a while.

1070
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,400
Well, how are you?
How was everything in Lisbon when you left?

1071
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,700
Don't change the subject.
You have missed me, haven't you?

1072
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,100
Never mind. Don't answer that.
I just wanted to hear your voice.

1073
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,400
- All ready, Mr. Burn.
- Okay.

1074
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:18,100
Sorry. I gotta run now. They want me
to pose again. But I'll be seeing you.

1075
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:22,000
Oh! Tell Clancy I love her too.
Good-bye.

1076
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,000
Here you are. Thank you.

1077
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:32,800
- You gonna see him?
- If he wants to come.

1078
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:35,400
Is that wise?

1079
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,100
No, I suppose it isn't, but...

Oh, Clancy, what am I going to do?

1082
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,900
There, there.
None of that now.

1083
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,800
I've never known anyone like him.

1084
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:54,300
When he's with me,
I don't even hurt as much.

1085
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,400
I've learned to lean on him so.

1086

I know. I know.

I don't want to hurt Don.

But, Clancy, I'm in love.

1089

For the first time in my life,
I'm really in love.

1090
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,000
I've tried not to think about him.

1091

I keep telling myself
that nothing can come of it.

1092
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:18,000
But I need him...

1093
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,200

[Crying]
What should I do?

1095
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,700
Well...

1096
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,400
The first thing you should do
is blow your nose and powder it...

1097
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,400
before somebody
comes back in here.

1098
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,800
Here. Use this.

1099
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,300
Now this is no time to get yourself
all worked up emotionally...

1100
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,800
and start acting like a female.

1101
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,200
When you're through with all this,
you'll have plenty of time to decide.

1102
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:49,000
But right now,
let's do what the doctor said.

1103
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,600
Give him a break. Right?

Sister Marie! A piano?

1114
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,800
Yes, Sister.
It's for Miss Froman.

1115
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,800
She's going to rehearse
for a new show.

1116
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:18,000
Rehearse? In her condition?
Why, she can't even walk.

1117
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,400
Dr. Taylor considers work
a very good therapy, Sister.

Also, Miss Clancy says
she can use...

I hope you'll pardon
the expression, Sister...

01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:29,800
but Miss Clancy says she
can also use a few "bucks."

1121

Excuse me, Sister,

Uh, right over here I think.

1125

That oughta do right there.
Thank you very much.

1126
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,700
I'll take care of that.

1127

Thank you, fellas.
Thank you, Sister.

1128

We'll try to be as quiet as we can.

1129

Don't worry about the noise.
That heart case next door has gone home.

any outsiders to hear you rehearse?

1132

Well, I guess our secret will be safe with you,
Sister. Stick around if you want.

1133
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:14,500
May I? Oh, thank you.
I'm so crazy about music.

I promise to be as still as a mouse.

It's all right.
Glad to have you.

First I'm gonna play
your theme song.

1137

This comes right after the opening number
when the artists come on.

1138
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:25,000
As the curtains part,
you're sitting there...

some way to prop you up.

1140

You're posing for this artist, the tenor...
That's you, Clancy.

Well, that's typecasting, all right.

As it happens, you're nuts about Jane...

1143
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,900
but there are reasons
why you can't tell her so yet.

1144
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,700
I know one good reason.
I ain't a boy.

1145
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:43,500
Well, he walks over to you,
and you have a few lines of dialogue.

1146
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,600
You know, love stuff. You say, uh,
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

1147
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,700
And then, Clancy, you say,
"Blah, blah, blah, blah..."

After which, you go into your song.

1150

But before I play that...

1151

I want to do the opening for you
so you can picture the whole scene.

the chorus on, the models.

That's you, Sister. Step back by the door.
I'll tell you when to come on.

1161
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,900
We're gonna have about
20 of the best looking dames we can find.

1162
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:31,200
Typical artist models, which means
they'll have on as little as the law allows.

1163

doesn't want to be a model.

I didn't mean to offend you. L...

in the least.

got carried away in it.

- You mean you're not gonna use me anymore?

this is a bunch of chorus girls.

But it's the first time
I've ever been in a chorus.

And if I have to go back and tell the other sisters
I was fired, they'd never forgive me.

would the audience
take her this way?

01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:50,400
That leg had begun to act up again.

1208
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,000
Now the really rugged days
were beginning.

1209
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Ahead lay long
dreary weeks and months...

1210
01:17:56,100 --> 01:18:00,200
of suffering, of uncertainty,
bitterness, despair...

1211
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:06,000
more doctors, more consultations,
more X-rays, more bone grafts.

1212
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,300
Seldom if ever out of pain...
excruciating pain.

1213
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,400
Once or twice,
near death itself.

1214
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:18,400
In and out of a dozen hospitals,
always facing another operation.

1215
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:23,300
Ten, 20... So many in fact that even I
began to lose track of them.

1216
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:25,300
Twenty-one, 22...

1217
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,400
Tumors, abscesses,
nervous exhaustion...

1218
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,800
endless hours with psychiatrists...

1219
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,400
sometimes not caring
whether she lived or died.

1220
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,700
And always with the threat
hanging over her head...

1221
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:39,700
that next time that leg
would have to come off.

1222
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,700
Here we are.

1223
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,500
Mmm. That looks good.

- Hmm.

- What's the matter with you?
- I'm not hungry.

1226
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,500
None of that now.
You've got to eat.

1227
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:01,600
Why? Why do I have to eat?
I'm sick of it. I'm sick of all of it.

1228
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:04,400
Why don't they just go ahead
and cut it off and be done with it?

1229
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,800
They know I'll never walk again.
Why don't they admit it?

1230
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:10,500
- Who says you'll never walk again?
- I do.

1231
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:15,000
And I'm fed up with hearing
you and everybody else say that I will.

1232
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:18,200
I know I'll never be
a normal woman again.

1233
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,200
I'll never dance.
I'll never go shopping.

1234
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,500
I'll never do any of the things
other women do.

1235
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:28,100
I can't even remember what it was like
to wear a decent pair of shoes.

1236
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:31,200
So why go on fighting it
and kidding myself?

1237
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,900
I hope they do take it off.
I'll be glad to get it over with.

1238
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,300
Now wait a minute. That's just about
enough of that kind of talk.

1239
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,300
Sure, you've had your share of it.

1240
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,400
Do you think I've sat around here day
after day watching you suffer...

1241
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,500
without knowing what
you've been going through?

1242
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,500
Why do you think
I stayed with you?

1243
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:50,300
'Cause I thought you had it in you to keep on
punching without feeling sorry for yourself.

1244
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:52,300
But don't you see?
I'm tired of punching.

1245

You're sick of it?
Well, I've got news for you.

1247
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,200
This has been
no picnic for me either.

1248
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:05,800
But I said to myself, "This baby's got what
it takes. Nothing's gonna get her down."

1249
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,700
And now all of a sudden
you start bellyaching.

1250
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:12,400
Well, that's your business.
But let's get one thing straight right now!

1251
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,300
Nobody feels sorry
for themselves around me.

1252
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,600
Nobody cries on my shoulder.

1253
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,600
And the minute they start it,
they can get themselves another girl.

1254
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:23,600
Because I've got more important things
to do with my life.

1255
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:26,800
And if you've got your heart set
on being a freak or an invalid...

1256
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,800
that's okay with me.

1257
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:31,400
Of course you've still
got your face and your voice.

1258
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,700
That'd be enough for most women.
But not you.

1259
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,000
Because you haven't got
what it takes...

any more of that kind of talk.

In fact, as soon
as the doctors gave the word...

she was right in
there pitching again.

with doctors to be paid...

it was work or else.
