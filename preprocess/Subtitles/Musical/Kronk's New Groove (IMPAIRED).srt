1
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,456
[explosion]

2
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,366
[man] Yep, that's me. Kronk.

3
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,102
Wait. Where did I go?

4
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,664
Right, there I am.

5
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,108
Covered in cheese
like a human pizza.

6
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,112
My life was fine until today.

7
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,343
- But now I'm doomed. Doomed!
- Ah!

8
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,908
You know, it wasn't
always like this.

9
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:56,183
I helped save the emperor's life.
Found a rewarding career.

10
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,814
- Next slide!
- [baby cooing]

11
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,018
I even made
some great new friends.

12
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,859
Oh! But look at me now!
Hiding out like a frightened kid

13
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,921
who needs a hug
from his teddy bear.

14
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,490
The little yellow one
with the button nose.

15
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,833
Ah, if only I could
turn back the clock.

16
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,703
Back to a time when I had
a spring in my step

17
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,140
and a... smile in my heart.

18
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,609
A time I like to think of as...

19
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,882
... earlier that same day.

20
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,660
[sniffing] Ahhh!

21
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,968
Mmm!

22
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,377
Mmm!

23
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,419
[woman] Come on!

24
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,817
Mm-hmm.

25
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,881
That's what I'm talking about.

26
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,788
Look out! Here it comes!

27
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,592
* See him walkin' down the street

28
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,689
* With a merry gleam in his eye

29
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,167
* He's loved by everyone in this town

30
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,602
* He's loved by this town

31
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:22,334
* To look at him now you'd never know
He was once the kind of guy

32
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,036
* Who tried to bring an empire down

33
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,510
* An empire down

34
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,879
* He lost his groove, he lost his way
When he fell in with a woman

35
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,351
* Who wanted to take over the world

36
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,718
* But then he did a full 1 80

37
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,916
* Said vamoose to the shady lady

38
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,654
* Now he'll teach your kid
to talk like a squirrel

39
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,094
- Squeakity squeaken.
- Squeak, squeaken!

40
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:49,192
* And though he spreads such joy
everywhere he goes

41
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,737
* Looks like this town's fly guy

42
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,272
* Will be the last to know

43
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,004
* There is nothing to prove

44
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:01,172
* Don't have to approve
the way that you move

45
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:05,308
* Don't have to be smart
or be rich or be smooth

46
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,912
* Don't have to make art
that could hang in the Louvre

47
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,320
* If you just go with your heart

48
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,918
- * Then you'll be true to your groove
- * True to your groove

49
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:19,328
- * You should be true to your groove
- * True to your groove

50
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:23,335
- * You should be true to your groove
- * True to your groove

51
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,428
* Yeah, you should be true to your

52
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,269
* Oh, you should be true
to your groove *

53
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,542
[man] So right about now
you're probably wondering,

54
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,707
" Hey, where's that emperor guy?"

55
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,081
Ha-ha! Wella, wella, boom baby!

56
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,849
Emperor Kuzco here,
coming at you live from the palace.

57
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,184
[guards] Hail Kuzco!

58
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,725
No, please, don't grovel.
I'd feel stupid.

59
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,522
I'm not that kind of guy anymore.

60
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,689
I'm nice now.
Didn't you see the first movie?

61
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,528
Yay! A 50-foot me!

62
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,331
Oh, I love that movie,
'cause it's all about me.

63
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:03,571
But right now it's Kronk's turn
to be in the limelight.

64
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,634
Let me put this as simply as I can.

65
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,703
This one's his movie.

66
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,271
Not my movie. His movie.

67
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,285
Not mine. His, not mine.

68
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,786
His. Not mine. You got it?

69
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,084
Even the little ones? OK.

70
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,953
I'll be back
to check on you later.

71
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,222
Have some popcorn,
a little sippy-sip of your sip stuff.

72
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,696
Places, please. Action!

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,727
- [bell dings]
- [woman] Ordering!

74
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,363
Waffle platter, extra butter,
two honey-glazed pill bugs

75
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,169
and a chocolate sundae,
hold the cherry.

76
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,176
One diet plate. Got it.

77
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,907
[Kronk] Yeah, it was shaping up
to be another perfect day.

78
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:45,678
The orders were flying, the joint
was jumping, grease was popping...

79
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,515
... and everybody knew my name.

80
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,077
[all] Kronk!

81
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,385
[Kronk] Oh, yeah,
I was living the dream.

82
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,425
Hey, Kronk!
How about some grub?

83
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,222
- Pacha!
- Hey, Kronk!

84
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,489
Tipo. Chaca.

85
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,189
[cooing]

86
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,424
[giggling]

87
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,558
Put her there, Junior Chipmunks.

88
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,327
N ice handshake, Chippers!

89
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,498
- Mmm. Someone's been practicing.
- Oh! You're too kind.

90
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,272
Pacha, you forgot
your change yesterday.

91
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,605
Hey, thanks, Kronk!

92
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,078
Well, what's right is right.
Otherwise...

93
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,581
- It'd be wrong!
- Right.

94
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,183
Boy, the place is packed.

95
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,551
Yeah. Never had this many friends
when I was an evil henchman.

96
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,250
And look at you now,
chef at Mudka's.

97
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,623
And head delivery boy!

98
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:31,858
[man] Delivery Boy logo by permission
of Delivery Boy Local 8675309.

99
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:35,367
- I get my one-year pin next week.
- That calls for a celebration!

100
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,130
A toast to Kronk!

101
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,194
May you be this happy

102
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,107
till the day you die!

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,265
[thunder clap]

104
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,810
- Ah!
- [screaming]

105
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,673
[record scratching]

106
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:52,047
[clears throat] I've come to
deliver this urgent llama gram.

107
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,710
[all sighing]

108
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,754
[bird] Llama gram. Thank you.

109
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,216
[gasps]

110
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,622
Everything OK, buddy?

111
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,491
Oh! [laughing]

112
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,023
Are you kidding? It's just your
run-of-the-mill urgent llama gram.

113
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:16,630
[screams] What am I goanna do?
What am I goanna do?

114
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,509
I know. I'll tunnel out of here with
a spoon, escape through the sewers

115
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,572
and live as a quiet but lonely
shepherdess named Maria.

116
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,673
That'll work.

117
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:30,082
[screams] We're out of spoons!
That's it. I'm done for.

118
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,317
Chin up, big guy.
I'm here for you.

119
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,758
You! This is all your fault! You...

120
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,589
You're the one who
got me into this mess!

121
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,461
If you'd listened,
you could have had everything.

122
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,195
But no. You had to listen
to Miss Goody Two-Wings.

123
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,833
Mr. Goody Two-Wings.

124
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,169
Yeah, big talk
coming from a guy in a dress.

125
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,709
- I told you, it's a robe.
- And those are pearls.

126
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,768
Fellas! You're not helping.

127
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,911
Now where was l? Oh, yeah.

128
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,973
Doomed!

129
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,019
- What's with you?
- It's my father.

130
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,248
He's... He's...

131
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,812
...coming for a visit.

132
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,191
[sighs] "Can't wait to meet
your wife and kids and see

133
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,729
your big house on the hill.
Cordially,

134
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:14,028
your father, Papi." So?

135
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:18,833
So Papi said I have to have all those
things if I'm ever gonna be a success.

136
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,396
And I once had them,
but I lost them!

137
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,642
- So?
- I never told him that part.

138
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,372
Big whoop.
T ell him the truth.

139
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,041
What? T ell him the truth?
Are you nuts?

140
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,517
You don't let a guy like Papi down,
or you'll get one of these.

141
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,850
The Cold Shoulder,
the Frenzied Eyebrow,

142
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,686
the Grimace of Doom,
the Sneer of Despair,

143
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,726
the Crippling Wince of Guilt,

144
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,818
the Scowl of impending Wrath,

145
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,658
and worst of all,

146
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,166
the Nostril Flare of Total Rejection.

147
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,692
Total rejection.
Right, right. Mm-hmm.

148
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,205
I remember it well. Too well.

149
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,646
[Kronk] You see, I was always...

150
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,711
... different growing up.

151
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:04,841
[giggling]

152
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,908
Squeak, squeaker, squeaken?

153
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,150
[squirrels scream]

154
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,090
[Kronk] Papi didn't approve.

155
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,626
He said if I didn't get serious,
I'd never amount to anything.

156
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,033
But nothing I ever did
was good enough for him.

157
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,648
[sniffling]

158
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:59,502
All I ever wanted
was a thumbs up

159
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,472
from Papi.

160
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,032
And I was so close.

161
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,303
I once had
a beautiful I house on a hill.

162
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,378
Papi would a loved it.

163
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,850
That house was
a d ream come true.

164
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,146
Are you gonna
tell me your life story,

165
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,783
or are we gonna get back
to running a restaurant?

166
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,726
- You're right. Priorities.
- [bubbling]

167
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,191
Get comfortable.
I've got a lot to get off my chest.

168
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:27,333
Oy! I had to ask.

169
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,130
Oy! I had to ask.

170
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,601
My nightmare began
on a day like any other.

171
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,868
So, technically, I guess
that would be a "day mare. "

172
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,408
But I digress.

173
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:40,172
It was Lunchtime, and I was making
my usual deliveries around town.

174
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,237
I always saved
the best stop for last,

175
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:46,149
to see my dear old friends at the
Flickering Embers Home for Seniors.

176
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,846
A happier group of folks
you'd never hope to meet.

177
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:53,654
A perfect example of how
to grow old with grace and dignity.

178
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,217
Does this look like a rash to you?

179
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,559
Has anybody seen my teeth?

180
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,895
Oy! My aching knee.

181
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:04,698
[sighs] I sure wish there
was some way to stop getting old.

182
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,671
[woman] If only they could
put youth in a bottle.

183
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,833
I'd pay anything for that.

184
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,536
Again with the youth potion.

185
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,012
How many times do I have to
tell you : there's no such thing!

186
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,208
- But if there were...
- But there's not!

187
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,012
- I said "if"!
- lf, schmiff!

188
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,484
OK, you two lovebirds.

189
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,545
I don't have any youth potion,
but I did bring you lunch.

190
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,523
- Hello, Kronk!
- Hello, Kronk!

191
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,320
- Hiya, Kronk!
- Rudy!

192
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,520
Gimme some stick.
What's shaking?

193
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,189
- What isn't?
- [laughs] Brought your favorite:

194
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,892
- puree of mystery meat.
- Oooh!

195
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,869
Now that's a lunch
I can sink my teeth into.

196
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,205
And to complement your meal,
prune juice.

197
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,400
Ahhh!

198
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,173
Drink up, everyone! Liquid gold.
[laughs]

199
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,908
[man] Ugh!
How can you drink that stuff?

200
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,882
Kronk says it's good for us.

201
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,613
Good enough for me.
Fill her up, Kronk!

202
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:01,522
- I guess that's everything.
- Aren't you forgetting something?

203
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,896
- No, that's not it.
- Here you go, pal.

204
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,295
[Rudy] From all of us.

205
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,798
Oh, no, Rudy. I couldn't.

206
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,394
We insist!
It's for your house fund.

207
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,631
You know.
So you can afford that

208
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,800
house on the hill your father
always wanted you to have.

209
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,937
Oh, yeah. And then I could finally
get the big thumbs up from Papi.

210
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,947
Yeah. How's that going?

211
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,984
- Oh, l'll get there. Someday.
- [coin rattling]

212
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,991
[woman cackling]

213
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,217
How about fresh
pill bug tomorrow?

214
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,855
- [man] All right!
- I'll see you all later.

215
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:43,492
Oh, boy.
Uh, somebody lose this? Anybody?

216
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,464
That's weird.

217
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,932
[whooping]

218
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,068
[shouting]

219
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,744
Ooh! Hey!

220
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:59,410
[Kronk] Little did I know, my life
was about to be changed forever.

221
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,579
If only there'd
been some kind of warning.

222
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,646
- A sign.
- [meowing]

223
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,351
Anything.

224
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,920
Oh, you're a feisty one.
[chuckles] Hold still now.

225
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,796
- H u h?
- [echoing laughter]

226
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,392
H m m...

227
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,439
- [bats screeching]
- Ah h!

228
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,406
Al I rig ht. Where'd you go,
you little rascal?

229
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,939
Looking for... this?

230
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,177
[screaming]

231
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,149
[sighs]

232
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,122
Hello, Kronk.

233
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,489
Yzma! What are you doing here?

234
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,495
I live here. Ever since
I was thrown out of the palace.

235
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,622
Ah. Weird.
Never seen you around.

236
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,532
Ah, but I've seen you, Kronk.

237
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,695
- Oh. You look good.
- You think?

238
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,672
- At least you're not a cat anymore.
- [meowing]

239
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,537
- Except for that.
- Yes.

240
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:01,103
An unfortunate side effect
of our last escapade together.

241
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,579
Yeah. Good times.

242
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,674
[laughing] You drank that potion,
turned you into a cat.

243
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,515
Who would have thought?
It was a pink one like this.

244
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,986
Don't touch the pink one!

245
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,152
[stammering] It's cough medicine.

246
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,427
Hope you get to feeling better.
I'd love to stay and reminisce, but...

247
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,433
- I've been watching you.
- Yeah.

248
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:26,663
And I have a proposition for you.

249
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,767
Ewww!

250
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,235
A business proposition.

251
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,436
Oh. Whoo!

252
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:36,038
You see, Kronk,
l' m not the person I once was.

253
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,207
I've changed.

254
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,547
I've turned myself around

255
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:43,384
and devoted myself to hel...
[stammering]

256
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,947
..." helping others." [chuckles]

257
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,554
Oh, well, that's some turnaround.

258
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,721
I want to help those old geez...

259
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,732
I mean, your friends out there.

260
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,567
Wouldn't you do anything
to ease their suffering, Kronk?

261
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:03,233
- Of course I would, Yzma.
- Good. Then follow me!

262
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,541
Pull the lever!

263
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,477
Uh... This lever?

264
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,640
- I worked out the bugs.
- Just checking.

265
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,686
Whoo! [laughing] Huh?

266
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,459
Wait for it.

267
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,194
[screaming]

268
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,729
This is even better
than your last one! Whoo!

269
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,501
Welcome to my new secret lab.

270
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,574
- Souvenir photo?
- Rats! My eyes are closed.

271
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,406
[Yzma] Follow me!

272
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:43,172
[Kronk] Whoa! Looks like
someone's been busy.

273
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,807
[Yzma] I've finally done it.

274
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,853
I've created the elixir of life.

275
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,184
The answer to everyone's prayers.

276
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,723
Behold!

277
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,452
The fountain of youth in a bottle!

278
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,255
[thunder crashing]

279
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,122
- Regular and diet.
- Huh. What do you call this?

280
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,532
Yzma's Young and Beautiful!

281
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,194
Heh. Catchy.

282
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,262
And now that you're here,

283
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:12,106
I finally have the one person
who can make my plan a success!

284
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,077
And that person would be...?

285
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,239
- You.
- Me! I knew that.

286
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,011
Wait. Why me?

287
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,711
Because l' m not
exactly what you call

288
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,617
a " people person."

289
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,815
And everyone trusts you.

290
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,723
Those old people will buy
anything you tell them to.

291
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,489
So you want me
to sell this to them?

292
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:34,464
What do you say, Kronk?
Help me to help you to help them?

293
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,263
I can't take money from them.
It wouldn't be right.

294
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,395
Oh, too bad.

295
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:43,032
Now I guess you'll never get
that great big house on a hill

296
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:47,067
and the big thumbs up from Papi.

297
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,511
Papi?

298
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,911
Bingo.

299
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,250
Whoa!

300
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,313
* He wants to come on
up to your house

301
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,890
* Have some supper

302
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,155
What will you serve it on, Kronk?
Plastic Tupper?

303
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:07,062
* You don't even own a fixer-upper

304
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,327
* Help me to help you to help him

305
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,062
Hel p you to help me to hel p who?

306
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,900
- I need gold, Kronk!
- [record scratches]

307
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,601
[laughs] I mean, you need gold.

308
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,666
* So sign your name

309
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,041
* On this line

310
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,374
* A void disaster

311
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,644
"You'll achieve a beautiful
connection with your father."

312
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,345
* Just faster
Win Papi's love

313
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,411
* With that pile of plaster

314
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,582
* Help me to help you to help him

315
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,148
* And then you'll hear him say

316
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,818
* Hey, hey, hey

317
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,885
* I'm milking the Milky Way

318
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,261
* I'm loving this lovely day

319
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,390
* And I

320
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,094
* Feel like a million

321
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,692
* Wow zee wow

322
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,795
* This cat is back, and how

323
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:51,775
* I'm taking my big-time bow
when I feel like a million

324
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,368
* A million, a million

325
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,778
* A million

326
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,808
[purring]
Yes! Now, sell, sell, sell!

327
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:00,953
[Kronk] Whoa!

328
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,682
[Kronk] Whoa!

329
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,746
Step rig ht u p.

330
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,315
It's finally arrived. The cure
for everything that ails you.

331
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,327
Yzma's Young and Beautiful!

332
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,998
[crickets chirping]

333
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,762
Ugh. It's a, uh, youth potion.

334
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:17,961
[all] Ohhh!

335
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,561
- Here you go.
- [man] Kronk!

336
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,196
Does this stuff really work?

337
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,703
Does this stuff really work?

338
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,369
Of course it does, you idiot!

339
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,003
Of course it does, you idiot!

340
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,877
[gasping]

341
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,142
Good enough for me!

342
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,513
Drink up, everyone!

343
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,313
Liquid gold.

344
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,459
Oh. Look at my range of motion!

345
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,359
My elbow doesn't creak!

346
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,660
I'm melting away the pounds!

347
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,030
Hair! I've got hair!

348
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,695
By golly, this stuff really works!

349
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,279
* Hey, hey, hey

Look out, old Yzma' s back!

361
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,157
Well, that worked. [cackling]

362
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,651
Suckers!

363
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,325
It's like a dream come true.

364
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,027
I put slime in a bottle,
call it a youth potion

365
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,831
and they can't get enough.

366
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,168
I'll be rich!

367
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,232
I'll be on top of the world! Again!

368
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,937
- [cackling]
- [thunder crashing]

369
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,537
[Kuzco laughing] Shut up!

370
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,982
Whoo!
Could she be crazier? Cuckoo!

371
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,542
You see what's going on here,
don't you, folks?

372
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,454
Here's a hint. You got sewer slime,
fancy packaging,

373
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,982
crazy laugh like a demon from
the bowels of the earth. It's a scam!

374
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,325
Her potion's a fake!
She's selling snake oil, people!

375
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,659
Wake up!

376
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,723
Oh, you saw it already, huh?

377
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,236
Well, smarty,
I bet you didn't see this!

378
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,732
Oh! Yikes! That's gonna
haunt me in my nightmares.

379
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,937
Can we just move on, please?

380
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,245
Guy in the booth!

381
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,516
Now!

382
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,024
- [horn honking]
- Big load of happy coming through.

383
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,224
Doesn't get better than this, does it?

384
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,236
I'm making tons of cash
for my house fund.

385
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,864
Now if only I could find
a house on a hill.

386
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,670
Kronk, heard you were looking
for a house on a hill.

387
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,802
- You heard right.
- We need money for more potion.

388
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,178
- Oh, yeah?
- So we're selling the senior home.

389
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,547
Good luck with that.
[humming]

390
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,008
How much?

391
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,282
Sold! Look, everyone!

392
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,087
- I sold the house!
- [old people] Hooray!

393
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,491
OK. Take care. Bye-bye.
[whistles]

394
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,091
Oh, yeah.
It's all coming together.

395
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:46,676
[Kronk] Dear Papi, remember how you
never thought I'd amount to anything?

396
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,111
- Well, I got news for you.
- [squeaking]

397
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,705
Good news!

398
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:54,946
I finally got that big house on a hill
you always wanted me to have.

399
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,146
It's really great.

400
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:59,122
You're gonna love it.
It's got all the amenities.

401
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,351
Swimming pool,

402
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,454
golf course...

403
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,260
The windmill's a killer.

404
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,060
And my favorite part of all...

405
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,896
- [trai n wh istle blows]
- Whoo!

406
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,529
Pancake Junction! [chuckling]

407
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,733
I even built a cozy little
guest wing just for you.

408
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:21,438
Yep. Just a big, serious house
for a big, serious guy.

409
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,482
Like me. That's who I am.
Marge, you getting all this?

410
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,380
- Tina.
- Rig ht. Sorry.

411
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,181
Anyway, Papi,
don't just take my word for it.

412
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,778
Come see for yourself.

413
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,086
I know you're
gonna be so proud of your...

414
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,650
... little Kronker.

415
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,091
- Mr. Kronk?
- Yes, Tina?

416
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,560
- Marge.
- Right.

417
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,620
Wait. What?

418
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,997
- A Mr. Rudy is here to see you.
- Rudy? Rudy who?

419
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,265
Hey, Kronk!

420
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,395
[gasping]

421
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,063
Oh, that Rudy.

422
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,506
[laughing] Long time no see!

423
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,541
Rudy! What happened to you?

424
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,841
You're, uh, not wearing any...

425
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,313
-...clothes.
- Oh, that.

426
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:00,283
I sold my clothes to buy
more of Yzma's youth potion.

427
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,546
You sold your clothes?

428
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,748
I sold everything.
We even sold the senior home.

429
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,121
- You sold your home?
- Yeah. To you.

430
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,454
Oh. Yeah.

431
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:12,019
- [sighs] We're flat broke.
- That's awful.

432
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,362
I know. I can't afford
any more youth potion.

433
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,995
Think you can do anything
to help out an old friend?

434
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,368
Oh.

435
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,070
How about if I spot you a bottle?

436
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,041
[imitating Gollum] My precious!

437
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,547
Kronk just wants to keep it.
We must not let him. No!

438
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:33,209
Something's just not right here.

439
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,220
Figure that out
on your own, genius?

440
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,915
Yeah, sure did.

441
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,890
- Figured what out?
- [groans] OK.

442
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,755
Uh...

443
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,959
Take a look at your pal, Rudy.

444
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,623
This is before.

445
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,829
This is after.

446
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,894
Before. After.
You see any difference?

447
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:58,375
Hmm. Can I see "before" again?

448
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,779
Well, I give up.
They look exactly the same.

449
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,784
He looks exactly the same,
so the potion is worthless,

450
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:11,448
and Yzma's a crook, and it's all
my fault because I helped her do it.

451
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,788
What's the problem?
Look at him. He's happy.

452
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,794
[slurping, snorting]

453
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,190
Eh, fine. You win.

454
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,100
Oh, yeah.

455
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,336
- [whimpering]
- Rudy?

456
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,514
Yzma's youth potion is a fake.

457
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,451
- She cheated you.
- Oh?

458
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,022
And... I cheated you too.

459
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,002
Oh...

460
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,535
I'm sorry.

461
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,882
I guess we better
go tell the others.

462
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,552
[gasps] The others!
I almost forgot!

463
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,425
They're about
to elect Yzma emperor!

464
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,590
I never knew that was
an elective office.

465
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:32,831
- [crowd] Yzma for emperor!
- Thank you, thank you!

466
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,873
I'd like to thank
all the little people,

467
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,340
but what do they matter?

468
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,537
- What matters is me, me, me!
- [cheering]

469
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:41,772
[Yzma cackling]

470
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,213
And when you elect me
as your new emperor,

471
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,682
I'm going to be
on top of the world!

472
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,427
- [Kronk] Stop this charade!
- Yzma's youth potion is a fake!

473
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,918
- [Kronk] Stop this charade!
- Yzma's youth potion is a fake!

474
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,429
[all gasping]

475
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,661
Kronk? What are you doing?

476
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,760
- I want you all to look at Rudy...
- Uh!

477
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,100
...and tell me what you see.

478
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,609
Whoo! That is one
hot hunk of man!

479
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,277
He's in his golden years.

480
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,545
Not getting any younger.
Chronologically challenged.

481
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,245
I got wrinkles,

482
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,446
bunions, ear hair!

483
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,547
I'm still old!

484
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,752
Hey, he's right.
I'm still old too.

485
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:32,157
Me too! And Hildy looks like...

486
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,788
Uh-uh-uh. Don't even!

487
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,560
[all] Yzma's a crook!

488
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,626
- [man 1 ] Yzma's a witch!
- Would you excuse me a moment?

489
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,564
[man 2] Get her!

490
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,505
[man 3] She's getting away!

491
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,472
Come on, fellas!

492
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,036
Hit it, girls!

493

[screaming]

496
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,360
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yippee!

497
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:35,882
- [Rudy] There she is!
- [man 1 ] She's a liar!

498
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,986
- [man 2] Get her!
- [woman] Stop her!

499
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,191
- Don't let her get away!
- Shame on you!

500
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,632
[Rudy] Got you!

501
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,166
Back off, or I'll jump!

502
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,435
[snapping]

503
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,306
Wait! That can't be right.

504
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:56,541
Whoo! OK. Why don't we all
just take a step back?

505
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,242
Not you, Yzma.

506
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,408
[growling]

507
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,315
She stole everything we have!

508
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:05,083
Yeah, we didn't chase her
all the way down here for nothing!

509
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,916
Nice moves back there, Hildy.

510
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:11,861
Oh! What about you?
Pouncing like a wildcat.

511
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,919
[growling]

512
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,398
Hey, I just realized something.

513
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,095
We chased Yzma
all the way down here.

514
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,932
Didn't I just cover that?

515
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:24,738
Don't you see? We're busting moves
like a bunch of teenagers!

516
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,003
[all] Ooh!

517
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,874
So, what you're saying is,

518
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:32,076
even though the potion was fake,
we're only as old as we feel.

519
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,018
It's like you should thank Yzma
for robbing you of every last cent.

520
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,721
Wait. That can't be right.

521
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,384
- Let's get her!
- Stand back!

522
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,687
Don't make me use this!

523
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,126
[all] Ooh!

524
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,026
Your cough medicine?

525
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:49,191
No! My most fiendishly
diabolical potion ever!

526
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:53,226
When I drink this, you won't
be able to lay a finger on me!

527
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,363
[cackling]

528
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,741
- [choking]
- Get her!

529
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,212
- How cute!
- Cutie pie!

530
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,187
See? I told you so.

531
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,750
[bird caws]

532
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,425
That's weird.

533
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:20,658
Let's all reflect on these lessons
on our way home tonight.

534
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,565
Well, everyone, back to the alley.

535
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,967
- You're living in an alley?
- Well, sure.

536
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,267
We sold our house to you.

537
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,740
I got dibs on the cardboard box!

538
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,278
[man] Come on!
You had the box last night.

539
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,146
It's my turn.

540
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,276
This is awful. I've got to
find them a place to live.

541
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,580
But where can I find a gigantic house
with 30 extra bedrooms?

542
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,451
Where?
Think, think, think!

543
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,552
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Too much salt in my spinach puffs?

544
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,321
Oh, no! Your house!

545
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,726
Right!

546
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,629
Whoa, Nelly!
Let's not overreact.

547
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,530
You wanna lose your dream house?

548
00:28:56,601 --> 00:29:00,162
That's gonna get us
the big thumbs up from Papi.

549
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,638
If I lose the house,
I'll let Papi down.

550
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,197
I can't let Papi down.

551
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,334
But you tricked Rudy
out of that house!

552
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,039
Oh, my! It's true!
I took away Rudy's home!

553
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,548
Hey! You got that house
fair and square!

554
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,607
Yeah, but he cheated
his best friend!

555
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,175
No, he didn't!

556
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,688
Yes, I did.

557
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,021
[coughing]

558
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,085
I gotta do the right thing.

559
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,221
[Kronk] Rudy!

560
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,129
Let's talk real estate.

[laughing, shouting]

562
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,008
Looking jiggy, Burt!

563
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,015
Feeling jiggy, Kronk!

- [train whistle blows]
- All aboard for Pancake Junction!

565
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,189
Tina! Marge! You'll be OK.

566
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,992
I'll help you land on your feet.

567
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,224
Don't worry about us.

568
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,961
We've been contacted
by a team of headhunters.

569
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,935
[jungle animal sounds]

570
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,605
- But what's going to happen to you?
- Yes. You're giving up everything.

571
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,735
No worries. I may be
giving up everything,

572
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,905
but it was the right thing to do.

573
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,074
So when you think of our
brief time together here,

574
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,482
don't cry for me,
Marge and Tina.

575
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,779
You didn't!

576
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:29,520
[sighs] Afraid so.
[sobbing]

577
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,290
Oy. Enough with the pity party.
You did good.

578
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,593
End of story. Back to work.

579
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,100
Yeah, but doing good
cost me my dream house.

580
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,363
- And then...
- Don't tell me.

581
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:40,961
It cost me my girl.

582
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,563
I said don't tell me.

583
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,939
These oven mitts were
the last thing she touched,

584
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,944
other than my fragile heart...

585

- [sobbing]
- Oy.

586

out of my life.

- [music dies down]
- Wrong movie.

to Camp Chippamunka

* We proudly pledge
our troth to thee

592
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,558
[girl] What's a troth?

593
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,997
[Kronk] It all happened
at Camp Chippamunka.

594
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,535
* And greet our leaders cheerfully

Yeah, rig ht!

596
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,601
[Kronk] We were there
for the Chipmunk Challenge.

597
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:19,473
We won Troop of the Year
two years running, going for three.

598

* C-H-I-P-P-amunka can't you see

* You are the acorn of my eye *

600
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,440
OK, Chippers!

601
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:29,008
- First, we gotta pitch the tents.
- Y ay!

602
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:34,155
And then we' I l review
some basic cam ping terminology.

[squirrel squeaking]

Hey, Bucky. Uh-huh.

Uh-huh. Squeakity-squeak.

606
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,963
There's a new troop leader
named Birdwell...

607
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,765
...who wants to take away
our... [gasps] trophy!

608
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:51,039
[Tipo] Look at them.
They're really snot and polish.

609
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,010
Yeah. It's "spit and polish."

610
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,136
- Snot.
- Spit.

- Snot!
- Spit!

Whoa. Easy, kids. Spit, snot,
same general neighborhood.

613
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,651
And don't worry about
this Birdwell guy, whoever he is.

614
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,554
The important thing here
is that there are no losers.

615
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,024
But you always win.
Right, Kronk?

616
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,424
We always win.

617
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,658
But winning's not
what really counts.

618
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,130
Remember our motto.

You know what that means, Tipo?

623
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:25,835
Right.

Granted.

Yoli's afraid of the water again.

It's not me! It's Mrs. Queetzo.

00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,967
Oh, gosh. Well,
we can't have that, can we?

633
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,903
Now, uh, um, give me the doll.

634
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,239
Yes. I'll have to have
a word with her. Now...

635
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,242
See here, Mrs. Queetzo.

636
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,147
Uh, Yoli is a top-notch swimmer,

637
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,777
and she's very, very brave.

638
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,378
So steady as you go, Chipper.

639
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,186
You're in excellent hands.

640
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,158
Yes. Mm-hmm.

641
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:20,061
Oh, super-duper!
That's more like it.

642
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,462
What did she say?

643
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,625
She's going to be just tickety-boo.

644
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,100
Very well then.

645
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,467
And off you go.

646
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,836
Hup, hup, hup, hup...

647
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:33,967
Let the aquatic competition begin!

648
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,110
[children] Yeah!

649
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,845
[boy] This is gonna be fun!

650
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,149
[girl] Hurry up!

651
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,323
[children] Cannonball! Cannonball!

652
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,998
Oh, I'm so proud
of my little Chippers.

653
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,798
Oh, dear. Are you all right?

654
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:04,976
[mumbling]

655
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,967
[mumbling]

656
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,513
Oh, you're a troop leader.

657
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,208
Are you hurt?
Can you speak?

658
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,175
Blink if you can hear me.

659
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:20,054
[Kronk] She was a vision. Feet
like a pair of landlocked tugboats.

660
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,149
Knees like brass doorknobs.

661
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,889
Elbows so rough they could take
the grain right off a two-by-four.

662
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,521
And her eyes.

663
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:30,032
They say the eyes
are the window to the soul.

664
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:33,195
Hers were more like
steel-reinforced security doors

665
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,865
with a combination
I just had to crack.

666
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,601
No doubt about it.

667
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:42,040
She was the kind a girl
you'd want to bring home to Papi.

668
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,126
Wow! The Chipmunk Handshake
of Fellowship, Level Seven.

669
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,397
A level attainable only by the
most dedicated of troop leaders.

670
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,528
You're good.

671
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,128
Well, you're better.

672
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,366
You're sensational.

673
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,340
You're dazzling.

674
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,570
- l' m Kronk.
- l' m Birdwell.

675
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,737
[gasping]

676
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,247
- You're Birdwell?
- Yes.

677
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,877
- But you're a girl!
- [children] Cannonball!

678
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,556
[children] Ahhh!

679
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,496
[coughing]

680
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,928
- Awesome!
- Phat wave, dude!

681
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,399
Nice form, Chippers.

682
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,698
What do you think you're doing?!

683
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,397
Uh... Cannonball?

684
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,734
[all] Duh!

685
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,637
[gasps] Look at poor Mrs. Queetzo!

686
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,179
She's all... all...

687
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,004
...wet!

688
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,644
Well, it is a, uh...
swimming competition.

689
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,382
Oh, it's all about
the competition with you?

690
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,287
Yeah. Wait. What?

691
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,223
No matter what it does
to the tinies?

692
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:06,696
Hey, I always put my, uh...
tinies first.

693
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,961
Ha-ha! Obsessed
with being first. I knew it!

694
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,060
Fortunately, there are rules
about this sort of thing.

695
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,902
- What sort of thing?
- Ahem!

696
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:19,739
Rule 4. 7, paragraph A,
subsection 2, revised :

697
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,335
"Troops shall compete
in alphabetical order.

698
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,278
B before K, except after May,

699
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,784
or when sounding like A
as in' neighbor' or' weigh'."

700
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,685
- Says who?
- Says the Official Chipmunk Rulebook.

701
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:31,744
No way!

702
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:34,649
[all] Way!

703
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,626
Troop Kronk is disqualified!

704
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,629
[gasping]

705
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,189
The aquatic competition
goes to Troop Birdwell!

706
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,064
[cheering]

707
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,501
Hey! That's not fair!

708
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,472
You ruined the aquatic event
for my poppets.

709
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,770
But now you've
ruined it for my, uh...

710
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,833
- Poppets.
-... poppets! I knew that!

711
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,243
You should've
thought of that sooner.

712
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,714
Come along, Chippers!
Toodle pip!

713
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,878
[Kronk] Why is this happening?

714
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,618
I-I-I just don't understand.

715
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,819
It just doesn't make any sense.

716
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,727
Was it loop over,
loop under and pull,

717
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,890
or loop under,
loop over and pull?

718
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,261
Tipo? You OK, little pal?

719
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,667
We're gonna lose the trophy
because of her.

720
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,034
[children] Yeah!

721
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,665
Now, now. Let's, uh...
keep the focus on fun.

722
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,043
- What about her?
- She disqualified us!

723
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:33,743
Yeah, and you're the best
troop leader ever, Kronk.

724
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,809
She can't do that to you.

725
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,121
Can she?

726
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,457
Just who does she think she is?

727
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,517
[Birdwell] Just who
does he think he is?

728
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,153
[sneezes]

729
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,631
Poor Yoli.
You'll catch your death of cold.

730
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,226
And then he tries to act all innocent.

731
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:55,739
Thinks he can charm me
with those rippling muscles

732
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,206
and that... that... crooked smile

733
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,643
and those deep, deep

734
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,374
- sensitive eyes.
- [Yoli sneezes]

735
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:10,984
No! He can't do this
to my little Chippers.

736
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,182
She can't do this
to my little Chippers.

737
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,418
- Yeah!
- That's it. Oh, that's it.

738
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:19,190
The gloves are coming off.
We're going mano a womano.

739
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:21,857
[both] Let the games begin!

740
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,867
- [playing bugle]
- [screeches]

741
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,869
[Tipo grunting]

742
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,220
[straining]

743
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,188
[grunts]

744
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,994
[gasps]

745
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,243
[Birdwell] Stroke! Stroke!

746
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,457
[Kronk] So. It all
comes down to one event.

747
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,496
[Birdwell] The Chipmunk Cheer-Off!

748
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,828
[both] There's only one thing to do.

749
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,561
Practice, practice, practice!

750
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:35,969
Do whatever it takes to win!
Here's how we're gonna do it!

751
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,373
We're gonna hit them hard.
Come at them with everything we got.

752
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,604
Get out there
and give a 110 percent!

753
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,147
Whatever happened to
" keep the focus on fun"?

754
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,511
We can't let him down. We just
gotta win that trophy for Kronk!

755
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,179
You know what I'd do? Cheat.

756
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,747
[gasps] What am I hearing?
You can't do that!

757
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,850
- Nah-nah-nah-nah.
- Stop it!

758
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,522
Ha-ha! Crybaby, crybaby,
stick your head in pie, baby!

759
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,589
Make him stop! Make him...

760
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:07,002
Hey! Kronk said,
"Do whatever it takes to win."

761
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,335
Right.

762
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,974
Whatever it takes.

763
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:15,534
Chin up, Chipmunks!
Victory is ours!

764
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:19,379
Soon as we practice our routine
ten times through without a mistake.

765
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,213
[groaning]

766
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:26,450
Uh-uh-uh! Spirit smiles!
I want to see spirit smiles!

767
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,251
Yes. That's more like it!

768
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,793
Peppy and poised!

769
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:34,490
Remember, don't think of your
opponents as a rival troop.

770
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,726
- Think of them as...
-...the enemy!

771
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,234
Layout. Very good.

772
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,133
This is no ordinary cheer-off.

773
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,138
- Basket toss. Higher!
- [girl screams]

774
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,868
This is a test
of everything we stand for!

775
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,969
- The culmination of all of our efforts!
- You call that a backflip?

776
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:52,982
[both] By this time tomorrow,
the trophy will be ours!

777
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,415
Right, Chipmunks?

778
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,646
[snoring]

779
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,709
Chipmunks?

780
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,655
Oh, man! This really stinks.

781
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:01,713
Yeah.

782
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,487
[girl] I want to go swimming.

783
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,392
[boy] I want to have some fun.

784
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,488
I want to go home.

785
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,762
- [sighs]
- [squeaking]

786
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,565
This is all her fault.

787
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,105
This is all his fault.

788
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:20,269
Well, if there's one sure-fire way
to cheer up a Chipmunk...

789
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,675
...it's raisin bread.

790
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,406

00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,398
How could you?

951
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,128
I'm so disappointed.

952
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,433
Oh, no. What am I gonna do?

953
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:31,474
Eh, let the kid take the rap.
He'll do easy time.

954
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:35,102
You put the idea in his head.
Look at him out there.

955
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:38,909
- He's six.
- Uh-oh, the lip. Not the lip.

956
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:41,006
Don't look directly at it!

957
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,780
Start flapping your jaw,
the girl goes bye-bye.

958
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:46,447
- Forever?
- Heartbreak City.

959
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:49,287
- No.
- So you're gonna weasel out

960
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,759
while they send Tipo
off to the big house?

961
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:55,521
You forgetting something?
You want this, you need that.

962
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,033
Dangerous.
You could have hurt somebody.

963
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:02,435
I cannot believe that you would disgrace
the Chipmunk name in this manner!

964
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:04,496
But Tipo needs me.

965
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:08,039
Let him go!
It's all my fault.

966
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:10,545
[gasps] Kronky-poo?

967
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,813
You told Tipo to cheat?

968
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:19,286
I told him...
do whatever it takes to win.

969
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,052
Wait!

970
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:32,466
- It was all a big mistake.
- I'll say it was.

971
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:35,663
The biggest mistake of my life!

972
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,065
I thought I could trust you.

973
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:40,803
But Miss Birdy-poo...

974
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,936
Don't ever call me that again!

975
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,838
On second thought,

976
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,749
don't call me ever!

977
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:06,858
She's gone.

978
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:10,929
And all I have
to remember her by are these.

979
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:15,909
Now I've got nothing.

980
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,574
No, what you've got
is a full house on fondue night.

981
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,480
Now give me one
Havarti party pot

982
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:25,214
two blue cheese bombs
and a cracker cheddar surprise. Stat!

983
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:28,257
How can you think of fondue
at a time like this?

984
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,294
Look, you made the right choice.
You saved the kid.

985
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:32,760
But I lost the girl.

986
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:36,390
Now l' m a two-time loser, and my
father's gonna be here any minute.

987
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,866
- More like any second.
- [horse whinnies]

988
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,766
Ah! What am I gonna do?

989
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,600
Just tell him the truth.

990
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,902
I can't handle the truth!

991
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,803
Where am I going to find a wife
and kids and house on a hill?

992
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,106
How's dinner coming?

993
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,274
I gotta get the wife and kids
back to our house on the hill.

994
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,415
You want to borrow my house?

995
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:00,979
- And me?
- And them, if it's no trouble.

996
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,651
Kronk, you should be
ashamed of yourself.

997
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,161
T rust me, I am,
but not as much as I'd be

998
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,890
if Papi finds out l' m a failure.

999
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:11,365
He'll come with everything.
Cold Shoulder, Frenzied Eyebrow,

1000
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:14,028
Grimace of Doom, Sneer of Despair,
Wince of Guilt,

1001
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,334
Scowl of impending Wrath,
and worst of all,

1002
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:19,807
the Nostril Flare
of Total Rejection.

1003
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,104
What's wrong with Kronk?

1004
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,478
Duh. You made him look like a
big fat liar in front of Miss Birdwell!

1005
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,645
Hey, don't guilt-trip the kid!

1006
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:35,282
- It's not his fault.
- No, he's right.

1007
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:36,950
I've got to help him.

1008
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,017
Now come on, Chich,
he's our friend.

1009
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:40,084
Pacha!

1010
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:42,654
You saw the Nostril Flare
of Total Rejection.

1011
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,496
We have to do something
before his father gets here.

1012
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,830
Too late. He's here.

1013
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,030
- [brakes screeching]
- [horse whinnies]

1014
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,972
- Ah! It's him!
- [both] I know what to do!

1015
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:57,809
I'll just wait here,
like a sane person.

1016
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:11,716
Kronker?

1017
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,393
Kronker?

1018
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:19,124
- Kronker, front and center!
- Yes, sir! Oh!

1019
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:24,297
Papi!

1020
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,535
What do I look like, your Aunt Matilda?

1021
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,167
Put her there!

1022
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:28,878
- [whimpering]
- Papi?

1023
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:29,810
- [whimpering]
- Papi?

1024
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:32,006
Huh? Oh!

1025
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,946
Where are your manners, son?

1026
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,850
Uh, sorry. Papi, this is...

1027
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,753
- You must be Kronk's wife.
- I'm...

1028
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:43,650
-...Chicha.
- Chicha.

1029
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,755
How'd this knucklehead
ever land a catch like you?

1030
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,992
Well, he just asked.

1031
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,026
Really.

1032
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,591
And these are my grandkids?

1033
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:59,198
Front and center, kids,
and... let me have a look at you.

1034
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,710
I said front and center!
Names and ages!

1035
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:05,339
Chaca, sir!
Age seven and three-quarters, sir!

1036
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:07,610
- And this is Yupi. He's only a half.
- [coos]

1037
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:10,244
And, uh,
that's my house up there,

1038
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,981
on the hill.

1039
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:18,354
Wow! I never thought
I'd live to see this.

1040
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:22,888
You, of all people, with a wife,
kids and a house on a hill.

1041
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:25,431
Son, I don't know what to say.

1042
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,269
Kronkers! Hoo-hoo-hoo!

1043
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,609
Now I really don't know what to say.

1044
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,615
Who's this... lovely...

1045
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,672
...lady?

1046
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,514
Well, she's, uh...

1047
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,747
- I'm Kronk's wi...
- Mother-in-law!

1048
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,058
- Granny!
- Pach...

1049
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:52,322
...ita!
Papi, this is Pachita,

1050
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:54,124
Chicha's mother.

1051
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,925
Ohhhh!

1052
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,297
Mother, huh?

1053
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:04,502
- Enchante.
- [giggles]

1054
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,810
Now I see
where Chicha gets her looks.

1055
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,637
OK. Who's hungry? Let's eat.

1056
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,840
Yeah, I'm starving.

1057
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:15,248
I hope the chef here
knows what he's doing.

1058
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:18,013
Yeah, so do l.

1059
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:22,057
Whoa, little fella!
Where are you going in such a hurry?

1060
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,184
Kronk's in trouble!
His father's here!

1061
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,888
He doesn't have a wife or kids
or a house on the hill.

1062
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,658
I've got to help him!

1063
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:32,030
Kronk's in trouble?
I know what to do.

1064
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:33,796
Hang on, big fella!

1065
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:37,271
The cavalry's comin'!

1066
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,308
[creaking]

1067
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,875
Ah, well, isn't this nice, Papi?

1068
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:45,847
You, me, Chicha,

1069
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,678
Mom.

1070
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,775
So, are you proud of me?

1071
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:51,183
Even a little?

1072
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,690
Humph. I'm just glad to see
you gave up all those crazy ideas

1073
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,988
- about cooking and talking to animals.
- Kronk! Y oo-hoo!

1074
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,458
[chuckling] Yeah. Crazy.

1075
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,725
- Hey, Kronk, what's cookin'?
- Nothing!

1076
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:07,065
There's no cooking whatsoever
going on here. No siree.

1077
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,366
- What's he talking about? Him!
- Him who?

1078
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,838
- Guy who was here.
- What?

1079
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:14,070
- Why's he asking you about cooking?!
- Yeah. That's weird.

1080
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,873
It's a... a business deal.

1081
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,506
Oh, Kronk's always
got something cooking.

1082
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,379
Oh, yeah.

1083
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:24,511
Speaking of cooking,
what does it take to get food here?

1084
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,987
- Talk to the chef.
- I'll go!

1085
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:29,590
Perfect.

1086
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:32,253
Gives us more time
to get to know each other.

1087
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:34,694
Oh... Oh! Lucky me.

1088
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:35,958
I can't do this.

1089
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:39,001
- Look. Fondue night was your idea.
- Ow, ow, ow!

1090
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,160
[chanting] Fondue!

1091
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,670
They don't get fed,
they come after you.

1092
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:44,570
Wait. I'll cook.

1093
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:47,102
[rattling]

1094
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:48,268
Feel that!

1095
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:49,936
Like a python.

1096
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,242
[waitress] Ordering.
One bucket of brie,

1097
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,252
two Gouda gulps
and a flaming fountain of fondue.

1098
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,753
Cardio special. Got it.

1099
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,051
And a side salad
with poppy seed dressing.

1100
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:02,113
Papi?!

1101
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,584
Kronk! Oh, thank goodness.

1102
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,686
[clears throat]

1103
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:09,493
- So?
- So, what?

1104
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:11,999
Hello! Anybody up there?

1105
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:13,558
Where's our food?

1106
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,070
I've worked up quite an appetite.

1107
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,241
More water. Be right back.

1108
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:21,242
Kronk!

1109
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:24,108
I mean... Kronkles!

1110
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,478
OK. Stoke the fire.
Stir the fondue.

1111
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,210
Chop the onions, lie to Papi.

1112
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:32,651
- Machu Picchu!
- Kronky-wonky!

1113
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:33,950
Who is this?

1114
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:37,584
- Why, I'm the lovely Mrs. Kronk.
- Kronker!

1115
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,787
Uh... Right.
I'll go check on dinner.

1116
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:44,027
Hey! Is that any way
to treat the lovely Mrs. Kronk?

1117
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,762
I thought I was
the lovely Mrs. Kronk.

1118
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:51,203
Look at us. Putting on dresses.
Pretending to be women.

1119
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:53,003
Kronk! What are you doing?

1120
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:56,204
Dinner rush. Four specials up
and a party of ten in at 8:30.

1121
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,941
- Kronk!
- Kronk? Kronk!

1122
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,778
Let me get this straight.

1123
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,910
She's Mrs. Kronk
and she's Mrs. Kronk?

1124
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:07,752
- Papi, I can explain.
- I'm the lovely Mrs. Kronk.

1125
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:10,486
- Ow. You're stepping on my face.
- Or maybe not.

1126
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,222
Is there anyone in this town
who isn't Mrs. Kronk?

1127
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:14,285
[screaming]

1128
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:16,695
- Daddy!
- How about them?

1129
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,929
- Who are they?
- We're Kronk's adorable kids!

1130
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:21,401
Oh!

1131
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,195
Kronk!

1132
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:25,206
- Sweetheart!
- Tina, Marge.

1133
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:26,673
- Marge.
- Tina.

1134
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,541
- Kronk!
- Well, at least that's everybody.

1135
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:31,477
Boom, baby!

1136
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:34,380
Like how I weaseled
myself in the movie? Nice.

1137
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,918
- Kuzco?
- How you doing, hot stuff?

1138
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:38,078
Hot stuff?

1139
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:47,594
[explosion]

1140
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:51,861
Kronker!

1141
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:59,632
[Kronk] So this is right
about where we started.

1142
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:03,941
Miserable. Covered in cheese.

1143
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:06,743
Trying to hold on to a big fatlle!

1144
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:08,078
[door opens]

1145
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,765
Papi...

1146
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,070
... I have a confession.

1147
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:36,441
I'm not who you think I am. I, uh...

1148
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:38,605
I'm just a humble fry cook.

1149
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:42,977
And a delivery boy.

1150
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:45,710
That's not all.

1151
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:48,313
Ch icha's not my wife.

1152
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:53,361
None of these folks are my wives.
And these aren't my kids.

1153
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:56,227
Not even the ones
who really are kids.

1154
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:59,632
Yeah, and that
big house up on the hill,

1155
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:01,636
that's not mine either.

1156
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,971
And Pachita...

1157
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:10,243
... not even a woman.

1158
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:12,907
I lied to you, Papi.

1159
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:15,507
I just wanted you
to be proud of me.

1160
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:17,712
I just wanted to get...

1161
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:19,880
...one of these.

1162
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:21,924
But all I ever got from you was...

1163
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:25,223
Yeah, that.

1164
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:30,557
I'm a failure.

1165
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:33,363
The truth is...

1166
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:35,336
... I've got nothing.

1167
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,105
But Kronk,

1168
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:44,942
you've got us.

1169
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:48,006
And I wouldn't trade
you guys for anything.

1170
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:51,053
Well, that would explain
why you don't have anything.

1171
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,248
For your information,
Kronk used to have a big house.

1172
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,449
On a hill.

1173
01:04:55,524 --> 01:05:00,154
- But he gave it away to us old folks.
- And he had a girlfriend too.

1174
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:02,322
They baked us raisin bread.

1175
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:06,129
He gave up all those things
to protect his friends.

1176
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:08,693
You were actually
listening to my stories?

1177
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,966
I was weeping on the inside.

1178
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:13,908
Wait a second.

1179
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:22,277
I really wouldn't
trade you guys for anything.

1180
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,681
Not even for a thumbs up.

1181
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,656
You see, Papi,
you may look at my life

1182
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:31,056
and think I've got nothing,

1183
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:33,288
but the truth is...

1184
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,621
...I've got everything.

1185
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,869
Not yet, you don't.

1186
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:50,502
I'm proud of you, son.

1187
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:51,876
Ohhh...

1188
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:54,075
Whoo! Papi!

1189
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,481
Awwww.

1190
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:57,644
Come here, you little squirt.

1191

Tipo! How's my little Chipper?

1194
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,728
I brought a friend.

1195
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:25,175
Hello, Kronky-poo.

1196
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:27,545
Miss Birdy-poo.

1197
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,818
I've missed you so much.

1198
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,915
I missed you more.

1199
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:38,615
I thought...

1200
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:40,958
We'd never see each other again.

1201
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:43,089
You know what this means.

1202
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,793
If they're finishing
each other's sentences...

1203
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:48,302
...then it must be true love.

1204
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:52,834
