307
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:28,513
My name is of no concern to you
whatsoever.

308
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:30,353
BUTLER: One moment, please.

309
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,509
London is gettin' so dirty these days.

310
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:45,306
MRS. PEARCE: l'm Mrs. Pearce,
the housekeeper. Can l help you?

311
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:48,865
Good morning, missus.
l'd like to see the professor, please.

312
00:25:48,995 --> 00:25:50,508
Could you tell me what it's about?

313
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:53,063
lt's business of a personal nature.

314
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:56,668
One moment, please.

315

[Vowel sounds droning on phonograph]

316
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:08,435
-Mr. Higgins?
-What is it, Mrs. Pearce?

317
00:26:08,515 --> 00:26:10,949
There's a young woman
who wants to see you, sir.

318
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:12,184
A young woman?

319
00:26:13,315 --> 00:26:14,270
What does she want?

320
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:16,994
She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.

321
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,031
l should've sent her away, only l thought...

322
00:26:19,115 --> 00:26:21,026
...you wanted her to talk
into your machine.

323
00:26:21,115 --> 00:26:23,788
-Has she an interesting accent?
-Simply ghastly.

324
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,753
Good. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.

325
00:26:27,515 --> 00:26:30,825
This is rather a bit of luck.
l'll show you how l make records.

326
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:34,669
We'll set her talking, then l'll take
her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...

327
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:37,792
...then in broad Romic.
Then we'll get her on the phonograph...

328
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:42,107
...so you can turn her on when you want
with the written transcript before you.

329
00:26:44,635 --> 00:26:46,944
MRS. PEARCE:
This is the young woman, sir.

330
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:48,263
Good mornin', my good man.

331
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:50,186
Might l 'ave a word with you?

332
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,664
Oh, no. This is the girl
l jotted down last night.

333
00:26:52,755 --> 00:26:55,872
She's no use. l got the records l want
of the Lisson Grove lingo.

334
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:57,786
l won't waste another cylinder on that.

335
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,433
Be off with you. l don't want you.

336
00:26:59,515 --> 00:27:02,552
Don't be so saucy.
You ain't 'eard what l come for yet.

337
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:04,433
Did you tell 'im l come in a taxi?

338
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:07,427
Nonsense. Do you think a gentleman
like Mr. Higgins cares...

339
00:27:07,515 --> 00:27:08,630
...what you came in?

340
00:27:08,715 --> 00:27:10,228
Oh, we are proud.

341
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,512
He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im.
l 'eard 'im say so.

342
00:27:13,595 --> 00:27:15,586
l ain't come here to ask
for any compliment...

343
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,314
...and if my money's not good enough,
l can go elsewhere.

344
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:19,794
Good enough for what?

345
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,627
ELlZA: Good enough for you.

346
00:27:22,635 --> 00:27:25,354
Now you know, don't ya?
l'm come to 'ave lessons.

347
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,869
And to pay for 'em, too, make no mistake.

348
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:28,950
Well!

349
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:32,104
And what do you expect me to say?

350
00:27:32,915 --> 00:27:36,271
Well, if you was a gentleman,
you might ask me to sit down, l think.

351
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,949
Don't l tell you l'm bringin' you business?

352
00:27:39,675 --> 00:27:41,552
Should we ask this baggage to sit down...

353
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:43,944
...or shall we just throw her
out of the window?

354
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:48,267
l won't be called a baggage.
Not when l've offered to pay like any lady.

355
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:51,305
PlCKERlNG: What do you want, my girl?

356
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:56,507
l want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...

357
00:27:56,595 --> 00:27:59,314
...'stead of sellin' at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

358
00:27:59,395 --> 00:28:02,034
But they won't take me
unless l can talk more genteel.

359
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:03,343
He said 'e could teach me.

360
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:05,426
Well, 'ere l am ready to pay 'im.

361
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:08,632
Not asking any favor
and he treats me as if l was dirt.

362
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:12,984
l know what lessons cost as well as you do
and l'm ready to pay.

363
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:17,109
How much?

364
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:19,193
Now you're talkin'.

365
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:21,829
l thought you'd come off it
for a chance to get back...

366
00:28:21,915 --> 00:28:23,951
...a bit of what you chucked
at me last night.

367
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,673
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you?

368
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:26,904
Sit down.

369
00:28:27,035 --> 00:28:30,107
-lf you're goin' t' make a compliment of it--
-Sit down!

370
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:33,151
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

371
00:28:33,675 --> 00:28:34,994
What's your name?

372
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:36,707
Eliza Doolittle.

373
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:39,950
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

374
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:45,188
l don't mind if l do.

[Pickering chuckles]

376
00:28:48,595 --> 00:28:51,587
How much do you propose
to pay me for these lessons?

377
00:28:51,795 --> 00:28:53,228
Oh, l know what's right.

378
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,068
My lady friend gets French lessons
for 18 pence an hour...

379
00:28:56,155 --> 00:28:57,986
...from a real French gentleman.

380
00:28:58,075 --> 00:29:00,305
You wouldn't have the face
to ask me the same...

381
00:29:00,395 --> 00:29:03,114
...for teachin' me my own language
as you would for French.

382
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:06,426
l won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.

383
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:11,433
Do you know, Pickering,
if you think of a shilling...

384
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:15,588
...not as a simple shilling,
but as a percentage of this girl's income...

385
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:18,509
...it works out as fully equivalent of...

386
00:29:20,155 --> 00:29:22,510
...60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.

387
00:29:23,315 --> 00:29:26,591
By George, it's enormous.
lt's the biggest offer l ever had.

388
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:30,714
[Yells] Sixty pounds? What are you talkin'
about? Where would l get 60 pounds?

389
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:33,070
-l never offered you 60 pounds!
-Hold your tongue!

390

[Sobs] But l ain't got 60 pounds!

391
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:38,431
Don't cry, silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.

392

Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick
if you don't stop sniveling.

Anybody'd think you was my father!

395
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:52,745
lf l decide to teach you,
l'll be worse than two fathers to you.

396
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:54,470
Here.

397
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:55,744
What's this for?

398
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:59,464
To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part
of your face that feels moist.

399
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:02,394
Remember, that's your handkerchief
and that's your sleeve.

400
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:05,911
Don't confuse one with the other,
if you want to become a lady in a shop.

401
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:09,670
lt's no use to talk to her like that.
She doesn't understand you.

402
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:13,225
Give the 'andkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you!

403
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,306
Higgins, l'm interested.

404
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:16,703
What about your boast...

405
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:19,548
...you could pass her off as a duchess
at the Embassy Ball?

406
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:22,354
l'll say you're the greatest teacher alive
if you do that.

407
00:30:22,435 --> 00:30:25,984
l'll bet you all the expenses
of the experiment that you can't do it.

408
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:28,225
I'll even pay for the lessons.

409
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:30,829
You're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n.

410
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:34,152

[Henry chuckles]

412
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:38,746
She's so deliciously low.

413
00:30:39,035 --> 00:30:40,514
So horribly dirty.

414

l ain't dirty! l washed my face an' hands
before l come, l did.

415

l'll take it. l'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

416
00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:51,665
We'll start today. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.

Sandpaper, if it won't come off.
ls there a fire in the kitchen?

418
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:58,027
Take her clothes off and burn them
and order some new ones.

419
00:30:58,115 --> 00:31:00,629
Just wrap her in brown paper
till they come.

420
00:31:01,115 --> 00:31:04,551
You're no gentleman, you're not,
to talk o' such things.

l'm a good girl, l am.

And l know what the likes of you are, l do.

We want none of your slum prudery here,
young woman.

424
00:31:12,795 --> 00:31:14,945
You've got to learn to behave
like a duchess.

425
00:31:15,035 --> 00:31:18,345
Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.
lf she gives you any trouble, wallop her.

426
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:20,187
l'll call the police, l will.

427

Come, Higgins, be reasonable.

431

You must be reasonable,
Mr. Higgins, you must.

432
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:31,664
You can't walk over everybody like this.

433

00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:37,793
Walk over everybody?

435

My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering,
l had no intention of walking over anybody.

436
00:31:41,955 --> 00:31:44,992
l merely suggested we should be kind
to this poor girl.

437

because l didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...

But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that...

a pebble on the beach.

Why not? But you don't know
anything about her.

But if you are naughty and idle...

...you'll sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles...

...and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce
with a broomstick.

...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

that you are not a lady...

of London where your head will be cut off...

...as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girls.

509

But if you are not found out,
you shall have a present of...

00:50:19,195 --> 00:50:22,073
...who wants to see you.
He says you have his daughter here.

765
00:50:22,155 --> 00:50:23,304
l say!

766
00:50:24,515 --> 00:50:26,187
Well, send the blackguard up.

767
00:50:26,275 --> 00:50:28,470
PlCKERlNG: He may not be
a blackguard, Higgins.

768
00:50:28,555 --> 00:50:31,023
Nonsense. Of course
he's a blackguard, Pickering.

769
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:33,390
l'm afraid we'll have some trouble
with him.

770
00:50:33,475 --> 00:50:37,787
No, l think not. Any trouble to be had,
he'll have it with me. Not l with him.

771
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:42,268
Doolittle, sir.

772
00:50:48,435 --> 00:50:51,074
ALFlE: Professor Higgins?
HENRY: [Shouts] Here!

773
00:50:51,555 --> 00:50:52,544
Where?

774
00:50:53,075 --> 00:50:54,872
Good morning, Governor.

775
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:58,187
l come about a very serious matter,
Governor.

776
00:51:01,555 --> 00:51:03,511
Brought up in Houndslow.

777
00:51:04,155 --> 00:51:06,032
Mother Welsh, l should think.

778
00:51:06,995 --> 00:51:08,508
What is it you want, Doolittle?

779
00:51:08,595 --> 00:51:11,029
l want my daughter, that's what l want.
See?

780
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:13,504
Of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?

781
00:51:13,595 --> 00:51:16,109
l'm glad to see you have a spark
of family feeling left.

782
00:51:16,195 --> 00:51:18,709
She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.

783
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:19,864
What?

784
00:51:20,395 --> 00:51:24,183
Take her away. Do you think l am going
to keep your daughter for you?

785
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:26,749
Now, is this reasonable, Governor?

786
00:51:27,115 --> 00:51:30,027
ls it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that?

787
00:51:30,195 --> 00:51:33,312
The girl belongs to me. You got 'er.
Where do l come in?

788
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:37,031
How dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me!

789
00:51:37,835 --> 00:51:39,712
You sent her here on purpose!

790
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:42,588
Don't take a man up like that, Governor.

791
00:51:43,155 --> 00:51:45,225
The police shall take you up.
This is a plan...

792
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:47,590
...a plot to extort money by threats.

793
00:51:47,675 --> 00:51:49,552
l shall telephone the police.

794
00:51:49,675 --> 00:51:52,314
Have l asked you for a brass farthin'?

795
00:51:53,035 --> 00:51:56,471
l leave it to this gentleman 'ere.
Have l said a word about money?

796
00:51:56,555 --> 00:51:58,625
Well, what else did you come for?

797
00:52:00,435 --> 00:52:02,346
What would a bloke come for?

798
00:52:02,715 --> 00:52:04,433
Be 'uman, Governor.

799
00:52:04,715 --> 00:52:06,228
[Alfie cackles]

800
00:52:09,435 --> 00:52:12,029
Alfred, you sent her here on purpose.

801
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:13,987
So help me, Governor, l never did.

802
00:52:14,075 --> 00:52:15,428
How did you know she was here?

803
00:52:15,515 --> 00:52:18,268
l'd tell you, Governor,
if you'd let me get a word in.

804
00:52:18,355 --> 00:52:21,108
l'm willing to tell ya.
l'm wanting to tell ya.

805
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:23,073
l'm waiting to tell ya!

806
00:52:24,715 --> 00:52:28,594
You know, Pickering, this chap's got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric.

807
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:31,593
Observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild.

808
00:52:31,835 --> 00:52:35,623
"l'm willing to tell you. l'm wanting
to tell you. l'm waiting to tell you."

809
00:52:35,715 --> 00:52:37,785
That's the Welsh strain in 'im.

810
00:52:38,035 --> 00:52:40,549
How did you know Eliza was here
if you didn't send her?

811
00:52:40,635 --> 00:52:43,991
Well, she sent back for her luggage
and l got to 'ear about it.

812
00:52:44,075 --> 00:52:46,589
She said she didn't want no clothes.

813
00:52:47,275 --> 00:52:51,746
What was l to think from that, Governor?
l ask you, as a parent, what was l to think?

814
00:52:52,195 --> 00:52:55,790
So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?

815
00:52:56,115 --> 00:52:58,504
-Yes, sir, Governor. That's right.
-Yes.

816
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,228
Mrs. Pearce!

817
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,905
Eliza's father has come to take her away.
Give her to him, will you?

818
00:53:04,995 --> 00:53:08,271
ALFlE: Now wait a minute, Governor.
Wait a minute.

819
00:53:09,195 --> 00:53:11,755
You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?

820
00:53:12,235 --> 00:53:16,148
Men of the world, are we?
Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.

821
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:17,873
l think so indeed, sir!

822
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:19,833
ALFlE: Here, Governor.

823
00:53:19,915 --> 00:53:22,713
l've took a sort of a fancy to you and...

824
00:53:25,915 --> 00:53:29,146
...if you want the girl, l ain't so set
on 'avin' her home again...

825
00:53:29,235 --> 00:53:32,033
...but what l might be open to
is an arrangement.

826
00:53:32,435 --> 00:53:34,744
All l ask is my rights as a father.

827
00:53:34,835 --> 00:53:38,350
You're the last man alive to expect me
to let her go for nothing.

828
00:53:38,675 --> 00:53:41,553
l can see you're a straight sort, Governor.

829
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:42,864
So...

830
00:53:43,115 --> 00:53:46,744
...what's a five pound note to you?
An' what's Eliza to me?

831
00:53:47,355 --> 00:53:48,993
l think you should know, Doolittle...

832
00:53:49,075 --> 00:53:52,112
...that Mr. Higgins' intentions
are entirely honorable.

833
00:53:52,475 --> 00:53:56,150
Of course they are, Governor.
lf l thought they wasn't, l'd ask 50.

834
00:53:56,635 --> 00:53:59,354
You mean, you'd sell your daughter
for 50 pounds?

835
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:01,107
Have you no morals, man?

836
00:54:03,995 --> 00:54:07,908
No, l can't afford 'em, Governor. Neither
could you if you was as poor as me.

837
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,111
Not that l mean any 'arm, but...

838
00:54:10,195 --> 00:54:13,551
...if Eliza is gonna have a bit out o' this,
why not me, too?

839
00:54:14,795 --> 00:54:15,830
Why not?

840
00:54:18,635 --> 00:54:20,865
Look at it my way. What am l?

841
00:54:21,995 --> 00:54:25,908
l ask ya, what am l? l'm one
o' the undeserving poor, that's what l am.

842
00:54:25,995 --> 00:54:27,951
Think what that means to a man.

843
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:31,584
lt means he's up against
middle-class morality for all the time.

844
00:54:32,155 --> 00:54:35,943
lf there's anything goin' an' l ask
for a bit of it, it's always the same story:

845
00:54:36,035 --> 00:54:38,549
"You're undeservin', so you can't have it."

846
00:54:38,715 --> 00:54:42,549
But my needs is as great as the most
deservin' widows that ever got money...

847
00:54:42,635 --> 00:54:46,947
...out of six different charities in one week
for the death o' the same 'usband.

848
00:54:47,035 --> 00:54:50,345
l don't need less than a deservin' man,
l need more.

849
00:54:50,835 --> 00:54:53,713
l don't eat less 'earty than he does
and l drink...

850
00:54:54,475 --> 00:54:55,669
...a lot more.

851
00:54:55,955 --> 00:54:57,866
l'm playin' straight with you.

852
00:54:57,955 --> 00:55:01,504
l ain't pretendin' to be deservin'.
No, l'm undeservin'...

853
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:05,874
...and l mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
l like it an' that's the truth.

854
00:55:05,955 --> 00:55:09,072
But will you take advantage
of a man's nature...

855
00:55:09,635 --> 00:55:12,945
...do him out of the price of
his own daughter, what he's brought up...

856
00:55:13,035 --> 00:55:15,629
...fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow...

857
00:55:16,315 --> 00:55:20,627
...till she's growed big enough
to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?

858
00:55:22,635 --> 00:55:25,593
ls five pounds unreasonable,
l put it to you?

859
00:55:26,195 --> 00:55:27,753
And l leave it to you.

860
00:55:30,475 --> 00:55:33,911
You know, Pickering, if we took this man
in hand for three months...

861
00:55:33,995 --> 00:55:38,227
...he could choose between a seat in
the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.

862
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:42,025
-We'd better give 'im a fiver.
-He'll make bad use of it, l'm afraid.

863
00:55:42,115 --> 00:55:44,265
ALFlE: Not me, Governor,
so 'elp me l won't.

864
00:55:44,355 --> 00:55:46,744
Just one good spree
for meself an' the missus...

865
00:55:46,835 --> 00:55:49,793
...givin' pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others.

866
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:52,628
An' satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been throwed away.

867
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:54,592
ALFlE: You couldn't spend it better.

868
00:55:54,675 --> 00:55:57,314
This is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.

869
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,511
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart
to spend ten.

870
00:55:59,595 --> 00:56:01,233
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.

871
00:56:01,315 --> 00:56:04,705
Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to 'appiness.

872
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:08,994
No, you just give me what l ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

873
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:12,272
l rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality.

874
00:56:12,355 --> 00:56:14,346
Why don't you marry that missus of yours?

875
00:56:14,435 --> 00:56:17,711
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

876
00:56:17,795 --> 00:56:19,353
Who told you that, Governor?

877
00:56:19,435 --> 00:56:22,154
Well, nobody told me.
l concluded, naturally....

878
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:29,305
lf we listen to this man for another minute
we'll have no convictions left.

879
00:56:29,395 --> 00:56:32,114
-Five pounds, l think you said.
-Thank you, Governor.

880
00:56:32,195 --> 00:56:33,514
Are you sure you won't have ten?

881
00:56:33,595 --> 00:56:35,586
No. No, perhaps another time.

882
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:37,586
ELlZA: [Shrieks] l won't, l won't!

883
00:56:37,675 --> 00:56:38,869
l beg your pardon, miss.

884
00:56:38,955 --> 00:56:41,594
l won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.

885
00:56:41,675 --> 00:56:43,267
Blimey, it's Eliza.

886
00:56:43,355 --> 00:56:46,028
ALFlE: l never thought she'd clean up
so good-looking.

887
00:56:46,115 --> 00:56:48,026
She does me credit, don't she?

888
00:56:48,115 --> 00:56:50,071
What are you doin' here?

889
00:56:50,635 --> 00:56:54,913
Now, you hold your tongue and don't
you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.

890
00:56:55,435 --> 00:56:58,632
lf you have any trouble with 'er,
give 'er a few licks o' the strap.

891
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,910
That's the way to improve 'er mind.

892
00:57:01,195 --> 00:57:03,789
Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Cheerio, Eliza.

893
00:57:07,315 --> 00:57:10,864
There's a man for you.
A philosophical genius of the first water.

894
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,555
HENRY: Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford
and tell him...

895
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:17,832
...if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch
with Mr. Doolittle...

896
00:57:17,915 --> 00:57:21,544
...a common dustman, one of
the most original moralists in England.

897
00:57:21,835 --> 00:57:23,427
What did he come for?

898
00:57:23,795 --> 00:57:24,784
Say your vowels.

899
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:26,831
l know me vowels.
l knew 'em before l come.

900
00:57:26,915 --> 00:57:28,143
lf you know them, say them.

901
00:57:28,235 --> 00:57:30,191
Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

902
00:57:32,155 --> 00:57:33,634
A, E, l, O, U.

903
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:37,553
That's what l said. Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

904
00:57:37,635 --> 00:57:40,354
That's what l've said for three days
an' l won't no more.

905
00:57:40,435 --> 00:57:43,427
l know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle,
but try to understand.

906
00:57:43,515 --> 00:57:46,587
There's no use explaining.
As a military man you should know that.

907
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:48,154
Drilling is what she needs.

908
00:57:48,235 --> 00:57:50,544
Leave her alone or she'll turn to you
for sympathy.

909
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:53,547
Very well, if you insist,
but have a little patience with her.

910

Whom shall l say is calling?

1380
01:30:59,515 --> 01:31:02,666
Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
lf she doesn't remember who l am...

1381
01:31:02,795 --> 01:31:05,593
...tell her l'm the chap
who was "sniggering" at her.

1382
01:31:05,675 --> 01:31:06,630
Yes, sir.

1383
01:31:06,715 --> 01:31:08,546
And will you give her these?

1384
01:31:08,995 --> 01:31:10,144
Wouldn't you like to come in?

1385
01:31:10,235 --> 01:31:12,271
They're having dinner,
but you may wait in the hall.

1386
01:31:12,355 --> 01:31:15,745
No, thank you. l want to drink in
the street where she lives.

FREDDY: [Sings] "l have often walked

MRS. PEARCE: Oh, sir.

1405
01:33:00,515 --> 01:33:02,346
l'm terribly sorry, sir.

1406
01:33:02,475 --> 01:33:05,467
Miss Doolittle says she doesn't want
to see anyone ever again.

1407
01:33:05,555 --> 01:33:07,591
FREDDY: But why? She was unbelievable.

1408
01:33:07,675 --> 01:33:10,633
So l've been told, sir.
ls there any further message?

1409

Tell her that l'll wait.

But it might be days, sir, even weeks.

lt really is, Higgins.
lt's inhuman to continue.

1418
01:34:02,795 --> 01:34:05,707
Do you realize what you've got to teach
this girl in six weeks?

1419
01:34:05,795 --> 01:34:08,628
You've got to teach her to walk, talk,
address a duke, a lord...

1420
01:34:08,715 --> 01:34:11,309
...a bishop, an ambassador.
lt's absolutely impossible.

1421
01:34:11,395 --> 01:34:14,785
Higgins, l'm trying to tell you
that l want to call off the bet.

1422
01:34:14,875 --> 01:34:17,025
l know you're a stubborn man, but so am l.

1423
01:34:17,115 --> 01:34:18,946
This experiment is over.

1424
01:34:19,035 --> 01:34:23,187
And nothing short of an order
from the king could force me to recant.

1425
01:34:23,635 --> 01:34:24,704
Excuse me.

1426
01:34:25,115 --> 01:34:27,390
You understand, Higgins? lt's over.

1427
01:34:29,075 --> 01:34:31,748
Higgins, if there's any mishap
at the Embassy tonight...

1428

...if Miss Doolittle suffers
any embarrassment...

HENRY: Eliza can do anything.

1431
01:34:36,995 --> 01:34:38,713
Suppose she's discovered?
Remember Ascot.

1432
01:34:38,795 --> 01:34:40,592
Suppose she makes
another ghastly mistake?

1433
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:43,235
There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.

1434
01:34:45,195 --> 01:34:47,390
PlCKERlNG: Think of how agonizing
it would be.

1435
01:34:47,475 --> 01:34:50,035
lf anything happened tonight,
l don't know what l'd do.

1436
01:34:50,115 --> 01:34:51,628
You could always rejoin your regiment.

1437
01:34:51,715 --> 01:34:53,467
This is no time for flippancy, Higgins.

1438
01:34:53,555 --> 01:34:55,511
The way you've driven her
the last six weeks...

1439
01:34:55,595 --> 01:34:57,586
...has exceeded all bounds
of common decency.

1440

For God's sake, stop pacing.
Can't you settle somewhere?

1441
01:35:00,635 --> 01:35:02,512
Have some port. lt'll quieten your nerves.

1442
01:35:02,595 --> 01:35:03,869
l'm not nervous.

01:35:05,435 --> 01:35:07,266
-Where is it?
-On the piano.

1444

The car's here, sir.

1445
01:35:10,115 --> 01:35:11,707
Good. Tell Miss Doolittle.

1446
01:35:11,795 --> 01:35:15,265
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed.
l'll bet you that damned gown doesn't fit.

1447
01:35:15,355 --> 01:35:17,346
l warned you about these French designers.

1448

We should've gone to an English shop.
They would've been on our side.

-Have a glass of port?
-No, thank you.

1450
01:35:29,035 --> 01:35:33,074
Are you so sure this girl will retain
everything you've hammered into her?

1451
01:35:33,635 --> 01:35:35,227
Well, we shall see.

1452
01:35:35,355 --> 01:35:37,425
PlCKERlNG: Suppose she doesn't?

1453
01:35:38,235 --> 01:35:39,304
l lose my bet.

1454
01:35:39,395 --> 01:35:43,388
PlCKERlNG: There's one thing l can't stand
about you, your confounded complacency.

1455
01:35:43,475 --> 01:35:45,431
At a moment like this,
with so much at stake...

1456
01:35:45,515 --> 01:35:48,871
...it's utterly indecent
that you don't need a glass of port.

1457
01:35:50,475 --> 01:35:54,070
And what about the girl? You act
as though she doesn't matter at all.

1458
01:35:54,155 --> 01:35:56,669
Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters.

1459
01:35:57,035 --> 01:35:59,344
What do you think l've been doing
all these months?

1460
01:35:59,435 --> 01:36:02,791
What could possibly matter more
than to take a human being...

1461
01:36:02,875 --> 01:36:06,914
...and change her into a different human
being by creating a new speech for her?

1462
01:36:06,995 --> 01:36:10,670
lt's filling up the deepest gap
that separates class from class...

1463
01:36:10,755 --> 01:36:12,268
...and soul from soul.

1464
01:36:12,675 --> 01:36:14,711
Oh, she matters immensely.

Thank you, Colonel Pickering.

Don't you think so, Higgins?

l don't have your imposing appearance,
your figure, your brow.

nobody would notice me.

He pretends not to know English,

He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker.

young lady you have with you this evening.

Well, who is she?

Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins.

Such a faraway look,
as if she's always lived in a garden.

1514
01:42:18,914 --> 01:42:20,984
So she has. A sort of garden.

1515

Henry must take Eliza home at once.
There's a language expert here.

-Sort of, you know, "imposterologist."

He's got lots of money.

You can tell him that straight.

Ruined me, that's all.

1859

Tied me up and delivered me
into the hands of middle-class morality.

Sounds like one of his jokes.

1866

You may call it a joke.
lt's put the lid on me. Proper.

1867
02:11:15,914 --> 02:11:19,987
The old bloke died and left me
4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.

1868
02:11:21,354 --> 02:11:25,313
Who asked him to make a gentleman

l touched pretty nigh everyone for money

amongst the lot of them.

1874
02:11:43,754 --> 02:11:48,032
l have to live for others now,
not for meself. Middle-class morality.

Why do you think l'm dressed up
like a ruddy pallbearer?

1879

...but l 'aven't the nerve.

1885

That's what we are, intimidated.

brought me to.

Oh, sent you back, 'as he?

1890

then he chucks you out for me to support.

1891
02:12:36,234 --> 02:12:38,145
That's all part of his plan...

1892
02:12:38,754 --> 02:12:40,585
...but you double-cross him.

1893
02:12:41,154 --> 02:12:45,113
Don't you come back home to me.
Don't you take tuppence from me.

02:26:35,634 --> 02:26:36,464
Who's that?

2122
02:26:36,554 --> 02:26:38,863
Henry. l knew it wouldn't be too long.

2123
02:26:40,274 --> 02:26:42,151
MRS. HlGGlNS: Now, remember...

2124
02:26:42,314 --> 02:26:46,466
...you not only danced with a prince
last night, you behaved like a princess.

2125
02:26:53,074 --> 02:26:55,668
Mother, the most confounded thing....
Do you--

2126
02:26:59,074 --> 02:26:59,950
You!

2127
02:27:00,754 --> 02:27:03,746
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?

2128
02:27:05,154 --> 02:27:09,113
Of course you are. You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?

2129
02:27:09,874 --> 02:27:12,627
Don't you dare try that game on me.
l taught it to you.

2130
02:27:12,714 --> 02:27:14,386
Get up, come home and stop being a fool.

2131
02:27:14,474 --> 02:27:15,953
You've caused me enough trouble.

2132
02:27:16,034 --> 02:27:19,868
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.
No woman could resist such an invitation.

2133
02:27:19,954 --> 02:27:21,467
How did this baggage get here?

2134
02:27:21,554 --> 02:27:24,387
Eliza came to see me this morning
and l was delighted to have her.

2135
02:27:24,474 --> 02:27:27,307
lf you don't promise to behave yourself
l'll ask you to leave.

2136
02:27:27,394 --> 02:27:29,305
l'm to put on my Sunday manners
for this...

2137
02:27:29,394 --> 02:27:33,023
...thing that l created out of the squashed
cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?

2138
02:27:33,114 --> 02:27:34,786
That's precisely what l mean.

2139
02:27:34,874 --> 02:27:36,387
l'll see her damned first.

2140
02:27:36,474 --> 02:27:39,466
However did you learn good manners
with my son around?

2141
02:27:39,674 --> 02:27:43,826
lt was very difficult. l should never have
known how ladies and gentlemen behave...

2142
02:27:43,914 --> 02:27:46,428
...if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.

2143
02:27:47,794 --> 02:27:49,944
He showed me that he felt
and thought about me...

2144
02:27:50,034 --> 02:27:53,265
...as if l were something better
than a common flower girl.

2145
02:27:55,794 --> 02:27:59,230
You see, Mrs. Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up...

2146
02:27:59,394 --> 02:28:02,989
...the difference between a lady
and a flower girl isn't how she behaves...

2147
02:28:03,074 --> 02:28:04,792
...but how she is treated.

2148
02:28:07,474 --> 02:28:09,863
l'll always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins...

2149
02:28:09,954 --> 02:28:13,424
...because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.

2150
02:28:14,114 --> 02:28:16,150
I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...

2151
02:28:16,234 --> 02:28:19,385
...because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.

2152
02:28:22,474 --> 02:28:23,953
[Henry groans]

2153
02:28:24,074 --> 02:28:25,473
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

2154
02:28:25,554 --> 02:28:28,273
The bishop is here.
Shall l show him into the garden?

2155
02:28:28,354 --> 02:28:30,743
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no!

2156
02:28:30,834 --> 02:28:32,586
l should be excommunicated.

2157
02:28:32,874 --> 02:28:34,705
l'll see him in the library.

2158
02:28:35,434 --> 02:28:37,994
Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...

2159
02:28:38,194 --> 02:28:40,788
...l give you full permission
to have him evicted.

2160
02:28:40,874 --> 02:28:44,913
Henry, l suggest you stick to two subjects:
the weather and your health.

2161
02:29:11,594 --> 02:29:13,550
You've had a bit of your own back,
as you say.

2162
02:29:13,634 --> 02:29:16,910
Have you had enough and will you
be reasonable or do you want any more?

2163
02:29:16,994 --> 02:29:18,905
You want me back to pick up
your slippers...

2164
02:29:18,994 --> 02:29:21,906
...and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.

2165
02:29:21,994 --> 02:29:23,712
l didn't say l wanted you back at all.

2166
02:29:23,794 --> 02:29:25,113
Then what are we talking about?

2167
02:29:25,194 --> 02:29:26,752
Well, about you, not about me.

2168
02:29:26,834 --> 02:29:29,428
lf you come back you'll be treated
as you always have.

2169
02:29:29,514 --> 02:29:31,664
l can't change my nature or my manners.

2170
02:29:31,754 --> 02:29:34,473
My manners are exactly
the same as Colonel Pickering's.

2171
02:29:34,554 --> 02:29:38,183
That's not true. He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.

2172
02:29:38,314 --> 02:29:40,464
l treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.

2173
02:29:40,554 --> 02:29:42,624
l see. The same to everybody.

2174
02:29:43,074 --> 02:29:45,713
The great secret is not a question
of good manners...

2175
02:29:45,794 --> 02:29:49,104
...or bad manners
or any particular sort of manner...

2176
02:29:49,594 --> 02:29:52,791
...but having the same manner
for all human souls.

2177
02:29:54,634 --> 02:29:56,943
The question is not
whether l treat you rudely...

2178
02:29:57,034 --> 02:30:00,310
...but whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.

2179
02:30:00,394 --> 02:30:02,271
l don't care how you treat me.

2180
02:30:02,354 --> 02:30:05,312
l don't mind your swearing at me.
l shouldn't mind a black eye.

2181
02:30:05,394 --> 02:30:08,352
l've had one before this.
But l won't be passed over!

2182
02:30:08,554 --> 02:30:10,351
Get out of my way,
for l won't stop for you.

2183
02:30:10,434 --> 02:30:12,470
You talk about me as though
l was a motorbus.

2184
02:30:12,554 --> 02:30:16,593
So you are a motorbus. All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.

2185
02:30:16,834 --> 02:30:19,473
But l can get along without you.
Don't you think l can't!

2186
02:30:19,554 --> 02:30:21,863
l know you can. l told you, you could.

2187
02:30:25,154 --> 02:30:27,622
You've never wondered, l suppose,
whether...

2188
02:30:27,714 --> 02:30:30,148
...whether l could get along without you?

2189
02:30:31,194 --> 02:30:34,106
Don't you try to get around me.
You'll have to.

2190
02:30:35,274 --> 02:30:37,788
So l can, without you or any soul on earth.

2191
02:30:40,794 --> 02:30:44,833
l shall miss you, Eliza. l've learned
something from your idiotic notions.

2192
02:30:45,474 --> 02:30:47,908
l confess that humbly and gratefully.

2193
02:30:50,754 --> 02:30:53,029
Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.

2194
02:30:53,114 --> 02:30:57,426
When you feel lonely without me you can
turn it on. lt has no feelings to hurt.

2195
02:30:58,874 --> 02:31:01,513
[Sighs] Well, l can't turn your soul on.

2196
02:31:04,074 --> 02:31:05,666
You are a devil!

2197
02:31:07,154 --> 02:31:09,543
You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily...

2198
02:31:09,634 --> 02:31:11,989
...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.

2199
02:31:12,074 --> 02:31:13,826
What am l to come back for?

2200
02:31:14,154 --> 02:31:16,145
For the fun of it. That's why l took you on.

2201
02:31:16,234 --> 02:31:18,873
You may throw me out tomorrow
if l don't do everything you want.

2202
02:31:18,954 --> 02:31:22,230
Yes. And you may walk out tomorrow
if l don't do everything you want.

2203
02:31:22,314 --> 02:31:23,463
And live with my father?

2204
02:31:23,554 --> 02:31:25,988
Yes, or sell flowers.
Would you rather marry Pickering?

2205
02:31:26,074 --> 02:31:29,669
l wouldn't marry you if you asked me
and you're nearer my age then what he is.

2206
02:31:29,754 --> 02:31:32,826
-Than he is.
-l'll talk as l like, you're not my teacher.

2207
02:31:32,914 --> 02:31:35,633
That's not what l want
and don't you think it is.

2208
02:31:35,714 --> 02:31:37,864
l've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.

2209
02:31:37,954 --> 02:31:40,912
Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.

2210
02:31:40,994 --> 02:31:44,782
ln short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is, is that it?

2211
02:31:44,874 --> 02:31:48,662
No, l don't. That's not the sort of feeling
l want from you.

2212
02:31:49,754 --> 02:31:51,426
l want a little kindness.

2213
02:31:51,834 --> 02:31:55,383
l know l'm a common, ignorant girl,
and you're a book-learned gentleman...

2214
02:31:55,474 --> 02:31:57,624
...but l'm not dirt under your feet.

2215
02:31:57,874 --> 02:32:01,867
What l done...what l did was not
for the taxis and the dresses...

2216
02:32:03,074 --> 02:32:06,589
...but because we were pleasant together
and l come to...came...

2217
02:32:07,874 --> 02:32:09,307
...to care for you.

2218
02:32:09,594 --> 02:32:11,312
Not to want you to make love to me...

2219
02:32:11,394 --> 02:32:14,352
...and not forgetting the difference
between us, but...

2220
02:32:14,434 --> 02:32:16,026
...more friendly like.

2221
02:32:18,154 --> 02:32:20,304
Well, of course. That's how l feel.

2222
02:32:20,914 --> 02:32:23,906
And how Pickering feels.
Eliza, you're a fool!

2223
02:32:24,434 --> 02:32:25,753
That's not the proper answer.

2224
02:32:25,834 --> 02:32:27,711
lt's the only answer
till you stop being an idiot.

2225
02:32:27,794 --> 02:32:29,864
To be a lady, you must stop
feeling neglected...

2226
02:32:29,954 --> 02:32:32,468
...if men don't spend half their time
sniveling over you...

2227
02:32:32,554 --> 02:32:34,510
...and the other half giving you black eyes.

2228
02:32:34,594 --> 02:32:36,903
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,
don't you?

2229
02:32:36,994 --> 02:32:38,985
Off with you to the sort of people you like.

2230
02:32:39,074 --> 02:32:40,905
Marry a sentimental hog
with lots of money...

2231
02:32:40,994 --> 02:32:43,633
...and thick lips to kiss you,
and thick boots to kick you.

2232
02:32:43,714 --> 02:32:46,751
lf you can't appreciate what you have,
then get what you can appreciate.

2233
02:32:47,074 --> 02:32:49,793
l can't talk to you.
You always turn everything against me.

2234
02:32:49,874 --> 02:32:51,512
l'm always in the wrong.

2235
02:32:51,714 --> 02:32:53,864
Don't be too sure you have me
under your feet...

2236
02:32:53,954 --> 02:32:55,990
...to be trampled on and talked down.

2237
02:32:56,074 --> 02:32:59,464
l'll marry Freddy, l will,
as soon as l'm able to support him.

2238
02:32:59,674 --> 02:33:00,663
Freddy!

2239

as an errand boy...

2240

...even if he had the guts to try?

2241
02:33:05,434 --> 02:33:09,029
Don't you understand?
l have made you a consort for a king!

2242
02:33:09,194 --> 02:33:12,027
Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.

2243
02:33:12,114 --> 02:33:14,992
l don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to do it as l was.

2244
02:33:15,074 --> 02:33:16,746
l'll go and be a teacher.

2245
02:33:17,154 --> 02:33:19,065
What'll you teach, in heaven's name?

2246
02:33:19,154 --> 02:33:21,588
What you taught me. l'll teach phonetics.

[Henry jeers]

2248
02:33:25,794 --> 02:33:29,628
l'll offer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant Hungarian.

2249
02:33:30,714 --> 02:33:34,229
What, that imposter? That humbug?
That toadying ignoramus?

2250
02:33:34,594 --> 02:33:36,664
Teach him my methods, my discoveries?

2251
02:33:36,754 --> 02:33:39,268
You take one step in that direction,
l'll wring your neck!

2252
02:33:39,354 --> 02:33:42,664
Wring away! What do l care?
