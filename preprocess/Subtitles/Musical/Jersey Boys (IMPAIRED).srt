How much are we talking about?

1705
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:02,077
As of noon today, including the vig:

1706
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:03,737
One hundred and sixty-two large.

1707

What were you thinking, Tommy?

1708
01:28:07,324 --> 01:28:09,418
I don't know, Gyp. It, uh...

1709
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,962
It always felt like I was playing catch-up.
It just crept up.

1710
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,169
I'm surprised he's still walking around.

1711

I'll be honest with you, Gyp.
We like their songs.

on and off for, what is it, 10 years?

1725

This was not a walk in the park.
This was a sentence.

The man is a personal nightmare.

He wears the same underwear

He takes no pride in his appearance.
In the simple amenities of life.

This isn't the time...

The man cannot be in a hotel
without using all the towels.

1733

I'm talking face towels, bath towels...

In a pile on the floor.

I come back to the room one time
the man is pissing in the sink.

- Right in the fucking sink.

There's a toilet."

You think it's easy running the group?

01:35:38,608 --> 01:35:39,655
Hey, Frankie.

1853
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:41,949
Frankie.

1854
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:44,576
It's that bad, huh?

1855
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:51,879
Frankie...

1856
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:55,967
...you are digging a million-dollar hole
for yourself.

1857
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:00,964
Tommy took me off the streets, Gyp.
What's that worth?

1858
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:03,558
You'll be on the road till you're 90.

1859
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:07,103
You want, I could arrange a loan.

1860
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:12,109
Thanks, Mr. DeCarlo, but I don't want anybody
involved in our future besides me and Frankie.

1861
01:36:13,059 --> 01:36:14,936
Hey, I just realized something.

1862
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:17,231
I don't wanna be in this group anymore.

1863
01:36:17,397 --> 01:36:19,820
FRANKIE: Not now, Nicky.
- No, forget that. I wanna go home.

1864
01:36:19,983 --> 01:36:21,485
What are you talking about?

1865
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:23,528
I wanna go home.

1866
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,868
Good idea.
After the tour, we all take a break.

1867
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:27,282
No. Now.

1868
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:28,495
I quit.

1869
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:30,827
You can't quit.

1870
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:33,213
I got his attention. Hi, Bob.

1871
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:35,749
Nicky, Nicky, we're in
the middle of a tour.

1872
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:38,134
Yeah. You know, I always hated the touring.

1873
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:41,137
Fucking hotels.
Those tiny little bars of soap.

1874
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:43,719
You're supposed to wash with that?
Can't even see it.

1875
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:46,475
You're talking crazy.
Calm down and we'll figure it out.

1876
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:48,181
I already figured it out.

1877
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:50,305
I'll make it easy for you.

1878
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,519
I don't want money.
I don't want side deals.

1879
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:53,854
All I want is out.

1880
01:36:54,017 --> 01:36:55,394
You're right about the soap.

1881
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,437
Hey, Nicky. Nicky.

1882
01:36:58,438 --> 01:36:59,485
BOB:
Nicky!

1883
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:02,491
We're in the middle of a damn tour!
Are you crazy?

1884
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:10,333
GYP:
Nicky, wait.

1885
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:11,951
Wait up.

1886
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:14,628
Let me understand.

1887
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:17,210
You put in all this time,
you have all these hits...

1888
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:19,250
...and yet, you're gonna just
walk away?

1889
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:20,714
That is crazy.

1890
01:37:21,878 --> 01:37:25,428
Me and the wife had a little trouble
last year, so you know what I did?

1891
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,592
I put the kids with my parents.

1892
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:30,228
And then I told them, my own kids...

1893
01:37:30,386 --> 01:37:34,061
...I made up this thing where I told them
I was really their uncle. Uncle Nick.

1894
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:36,025
I don't understand.

1895
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:38,562
So I could screw around, you know.
Do what I wanted.

1896
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:43,074
I figured if I wasn't home to put them to
bed, they wouldn't feel deprived of a father.

1897
01:37:43,649 --> 01:37:45,367
I don't know what to say, Nick.

1898
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:48,238
All due respect, Mr. DeCarlo...

1899
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:51,787
...you sell a hundred million records,
see how you handle it.

1900
01:37:52,241 --> 01:37:54,960
Frankie and Bob,
they're gonna take this hard.

1901
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:57,129
I'm not worried.

1902
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:58,961
Those guys, with all their talent...

1903
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:00,875
...they'll never even know I'm gone.

1904
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:16,190
You want me to go out there by myself?
Are you nuts?

1905
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:19,068
Look, there's a lot of great
backup guys out there, right?

1906
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:21,730
There's Joe Long, Charlie Calello.

1907
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:24,069
We find two more and put you in front.

1908
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:27,443
Get a great drummer.
A horn section like we talked about.

1909
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:29,533

- Write and produce.

1911
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,281
I don't like it.

1912
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:33,916
- Why?
- You're crapping out on me.

1913
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:36,169
- I thought we had a handshake.
- We do.

I think, "What the hell happened?
What's gonna happen? Everybody leaves."

1916
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:48,806
Why does everybody leave?
