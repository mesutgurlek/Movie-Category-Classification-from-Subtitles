1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:03,333
I hold in my hand,
ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:05,902
our competition for regionals.

3
00:00:05,936 --> 00:00:08,304
(cheering)

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,873
Drumroll, please.

5
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:11,875
From...

6
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:13,409
North Central High School
in Indianapolis,

7
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:14,911
the Hoosierdaddies.

8
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:16,846
That's very clever.
And from Our Lady

9
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:19,482
of Perpetual Loneliness
in Battle Creek, Michigan,

10
00:00:19,516 --> 00:00:20,650
the Nun-Touchables.

11
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:23,152
BLAINE:
<i>Wait, is that a convent?</i>

12
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:25,488
WILL: Guys, I like our chances
against both these squads,

13
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:26,990
but we still got a
lot of work to do.

14
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:28,858
Mr. Shue, please stop talking.
I have an announcement.

15
00:00:28,893 --> 00:00:30,927
I regret to inform you

16
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:33,296
a deadly asteroid
is headed our way.

17
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:39,068
Wait, didn't we just go
through this at Christmas?

18
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:40,270
TINA:
Yeah, and is it true

19
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:42,105
you and Sam got married?
Did that happen?

20
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:44,107
Shut up, Tina.
I'm naming this comet.

21
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:46,576
Tubbington-Bopp, and it is
headed straight for Lima.

22
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,212
Wait, so is it an asteroid or a comet?
It's both.

23
00:00:49,246 --> 00:00:51,080
Wouldn't NASA know something
about this?

24
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:53,049
We can't trust NASA.
I mean, last month

25
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,717
a meteor exactly
like Tubbington-Bopp

26
00:00:54,752 --> 00:00:57,020
hit Russia with no warning at all.
Oh, so now it's a meteor.

27
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:58,588
That's right, Artie,
And when this meteorite hits,

28
00:00:58,622 --> 00:01:00,556
I will not be spending my time

29
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:02,058
in this room preparing
for regionals.

30
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:05,261
I will be spending my last hours
making amends with somebody who

31
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:06,429
I need to get right with.

32
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:08,197
Someone who I love very much.

33
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:10,767
Lord Tubbington.

34
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:12,235
So go back to your homes
and hide your wife,

35
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:14,437
hide your kids
and hide your wife.

36
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:16,139
McKinley High, I salute you.

BRITTANY: I'm really surprised
that Jesus Christ Superstar

39
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:27,383
has chosen to end the world
this way instead of the way

40
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:28,384
he killed off the dinosaurs,

41
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:29,886
which was a global
yeast infection.

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,522
Do you think God will let me
be a girl angel in heaven?

43
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:34,123
Wait, there are girl
and boy angels?

44
00:01:34,158 --> 00:01:36,225
Does that mean
you can have angel sex?

45
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,294
WILL:
All right. Show of hands.

46
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:39,562
Who's worried about.

47
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:43,566
Brittany's meteor/asteroid/comet
prediction?

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,902
Okay. Well, here's how I see it.

49
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:47,570
There are two possible outcomes.

50
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:50,606
First, the meteor misses us
and we go to regionals

51
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:54,210
and we kick butt, which will
only happen if we prepare.

52
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:57,880
Or... we only have
a few days to live

53
00:01:57,915 --> 00:01:59,716
and if that's the case,

54
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,484
we need to say everything
we need to say

55
00:02:01,518 --> 00:02:03,319
to the people we love.

56
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:05,154
I can tell you
from those couple of weeks

57
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,490
where I couldn't talk to Emma
that there is nothing worse

58
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:09,659
than unfinished business
with the one you love.

59
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:11,327
And meteor or no meteor

60
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:13,696
any moment you have
with those people

61
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:15,631
might be your last one.

62
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,134
Bruce Springsteen always says

63
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:20,536
that he plays every show
as if it's his last,

64
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:24,107
and that is the kind of urgency
we need at regionals this year.

65
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:26,109
So this week

66
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:28,811
we're either gonna sing
our last songs to each other

67
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:33,683
or get in touch with what it
feels like to do that.

68
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:35,018
(school bell ringing)

69
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:36,853
Okay, everyone.

70
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:37,987
Let's make the most of it.

71
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:39,989
Dude. Dude, I saw her.

72
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:41,891
She goes here. I can't
believe the coincidence.

73
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:43,726
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.
Saw who?

74
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:45,728
Her. Katie.

75
00:02:45,763 --> 00:02:47,730
(sighs) Okay, listen,
I haven't told you

76
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:49,298
'cause it's a little
embarrassing,

77
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,967
but I've been having
this text-lationship

78
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:52,535
with this girl I met online.

79
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,537
She's funny, she's smart,
she totally gets me,

80
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:56,539
but I figured she lived, like,
halfway across the country

81
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:58,374
or something and I'd have
to steal my mom's Volvo

82
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,376
for a spring break roadie to God
knows where just to meet her.

83
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:01,677
But just this morning...

84
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:03,679
<i>I was taking</i>
<i>that English test on</i> 1984,

85
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:05,515
<i>getting totally frustrated</i>
<i>about how I'm supposed to write</i>

86
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:07,683
<i>an essay on the dystopian</i>
<i>future when the book is set,</i>

87
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:09,419
<i>like, 13 years</i>
<i>before I was even born.</i>

88
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,387
<i>And then I looked up</i>
<i>to clear my head</i>

89
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:12,588
<i>and there she was.</i>

90
00:03:12,623 --> 00:03:15,758
♪ There is one in a million
like you ♪

91
00:03:15,793 --> 00:03:18,061
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

92
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:20,229
<i>I thought I was hallucinating,</i>
<i>but she looked right back at me</i>

93
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:21,731
<i>as she walked by.</i>
<i>It was definitely her.</i>

94
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:25,368
<i>I tried to get up</i>
<i>and go after her, but...</i>

95
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:27,370
I think I'm in love
with this girl.

96
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:29,539
(chuckles) Dude,
you've got to slow down.

97
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:31,040
You haven't even met her yet.

98
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:32,775
It's like I've more
than met her, okay?

99
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,945
Without all the awkwardness
of looks or clothes or hairdos,

100
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,614
we really got to know
each other. On the real.

101
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:40,616
I've got to meet her.

102
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:43,086
I think I'm gonna skip next hour
and just go class to class,

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,687
looking in the windows
until I find her.

104
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:46,722
Okay, and then what?
You can't just walk

105
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:48,558
into the middle of some class.
You can't wait for her

106
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:50,560
in the hall and say,
"Hi, I'm in love with you."

107
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:52,428
You need some kind of a plan.

108
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:53,896
And it has to be special.

109
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:55,731
(bell ringing)

110
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,567
Lord Tubbington,

111
00:03:57,601 --> 00:04:00,236
I know that through the years
we haven't always gotten along.

112
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,573
Like the time that you filed
paperwork to have me committed

113
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:05,608
or the time you told the police
that I was the one

114
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:07,910
that brutally murdered
that whole family of mice.

115
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:09,912
But I want you to know

116
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:11,514
that through it all,

117
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:13,116
I always loved you.

118
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,784
I don't think he believes me.

119
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:16,953
'Cause he won't say
that he loves me, too.

120
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:19,589
What's Lord Tubbington's
favorite song? I mean, maybe...

121
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:22,225
you could let him know how much he
means to you by singing it to him.

122
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:23,793
Well, I stopped singing to
Lord Tubbington out of protest

123
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:26,762
when he joined the KKKK, which
is the Ku Klux Klan for Kats.

124
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:28,064
SAM:
You know, you could bring him by

125
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:29,432
and then we could
all sing to him.

126
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:30,766
That way, you know,
he'll see how much

127
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:32,435
you love him, and everybody
else in the glee club

128
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:34,937
will stop feeling like you're
choosing a cat over them.

129
00:04:34,972 --> 00:04:37,940
Sam, despite your outlandishly
low test scores,

130
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:39,575
you're a genius.

131
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:44,947
(bell ringing)

132
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:50,086
H-Hey.

133
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,754
How you doing?

134
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:53,456
Me?

135
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,757
Yeah, you. I've been
dying to talk to you.

136
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,093
(chuckles) Seriously?

137
00:04:57,127 --> 00:04:58,461
Yeah.

138
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,829
I saw you walk by my class
this morning and I almost

139
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:01,664
ran out of a test
to come meet you.

140
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:04,333
(chuckles) I'm kind of freaking
out right now. That's cool.

141
00:05:04,368 --> 00:05:07,270
So am I. Uh, sorry. I should
really do this properly.

142
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:08,437
I'm Ryder Lynn.

143
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:10,206
Yeah. Yeah, I know who you are.

144
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,241
Would you mind coming with me?

145
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:16,846
Hey, how you doing?

146
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,514
What is happening?

147
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:19,715
And...

148
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:23,386
(quietly):
...who are they?

149
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,222
They're the band.

150
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:28,558
And...
Oh, my... God.

151
00:05:28,592 --> 00:05:29,859
If I know you
the way I think I do,

152
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:31,894
you're gonna love it
even more after.

(chuckles) (laughs)

185
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:49,098
Okay, you are such a good
singer, and your arms

186
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:50,666
are, like, so hunky.

187
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:53,402
I'm literally dying.
(laughs)

188
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:55,604
Uh, but... why me?

189
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,174
After all the time we've spent
getting to know each other

190
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,343
on Facebook and-and IM-ing
and texting,

191
00:08:00,377 --> 00:08:02,678
I just... I wanted
the first time we met in person

192
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:04,513
to be something we remembered
for the rest of our lives.

193
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:07,717
Okay, but we haven't been doing
any of those things.

194
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:09,385
Yeah, we have.

195
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,154
The last few weeks, we've
told each other everything.

196
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:14,056
All our secrets, our dreams.

197
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:16,992
Come on, Katie, you don't have
to be embarrassed.

198
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:18,828
But my name's not Katie.
It's Marissa.

199
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:21,397
No. No, I, um...

200
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:23,899
Look. See? Uh...

201
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,301
here are all our texts,

202
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:27,303
and that's a picture
you sent me of yourself.

203
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:30,740
Well, yeah, that's my picture,
but I didn't send it to you.

204
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:33,843
I-I never wrote
any of those texts.

205
00:08:33,877 --> 00:08:36,579
Oh, my God.
Someone's catfishing you.

206
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:38,180
It happened to Manti Te'o.

207
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:40,683
Someone stole a picture of me

208
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:43,686
and used it created a fake
identity to get close to you.

209
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,688
Who the hell would do
something like that?

210
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:48,691
I'm so sorry, Ryder.

211
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:51,727
But please... please call me.

212
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:09,988
(bell ringing)
Hey! Hey!

213
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:12,658
Hey, which one of you was it?
JAKE: Whoa, dude. Dude.

214
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:14,660
It was you, wasn't it? What are you doing?
You need to calm down.

215
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:16,829
Stringing me along online,
pretending to be somebody else,

216
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:19,832
getting me to send you...
pictures?

217
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,900
Because you still like me
and this is your warped way

218
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:23,669
of showing it? Well, that's
messed up, Marley. Ryder,

219
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:27,106
I swear to you, it-it...
This is not me.

220
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,574
Then it was you.

221
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:30,309
Dude, I wouldn't
do something like this.

222
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:32,978
You know, I get it, all right?

223
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:35,647
I get it that you didn't
like me back.

224
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:37,116
I get it that I crossed
the line,

225
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,752
but you didn't have
to humiliate me.

226
00:09:39,786 --> 00:09:43,288
You didn't have
to make me feel so pathetic.

227
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:45,290
I thought you were still
my friends.

228
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:48,327
I swear to you
we did not do this.

229
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,498
Well, it had to be somebody
close to me, all right?

230
00:09:52,532 --> 00:09:54,666
Somebody who knew exactly what
to say to get me to trust them.

231
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:56,835
Do you want to talk about it?

232
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,604
I don't want
anything from anyone.

233
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:00,005
Especially not either of you.

234
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,173
Dude.

235
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:03,208
Dude.

236
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,513
Wow.
Whoa.

237

A little din-din,

269
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:25,584
inspired by one of
our favorite movies.

270
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:26,752
<i>The Godfather?</i>

271

<i>Lady and the Tramp.</i>

272

Oh.
(chuckles)

273
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:30,322
Oh.
Mmm.

274
00:12:30,356 --> 00:12:31,490
Come sit down.

275
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:32,658
This looks great.

276
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:33,825
Right here.

277
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,160
I mean, what-what's
this all about?

278
00:12:35,194 --> 00:12:36,995
Well, as you've heard,

279
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,830
that Tubbington-Bopp's
getting close to Earth.

280
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:40,666
Oh.
(chuckles)

281
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,168
And if it hits,
we're all gonna be deader

282
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:45,470
than a bunch of baby chickens
fighting a dachshund.

283
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:48,674
So, I figured if I had
one more week upright,

284
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,409
I wanted to do
something special

285
00:12:50,443 --> 00:12:52,344
with my most special friend.

286
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:53,745
Well, that is very lovely.

287
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,147
Thank you so much.

288
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:56,915
And, hey, why worry about carbs

289
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,617
when we're all gonna die anyway?

290
00:12:58,651 --> 00:12:59,952
Hello.
Hello.

291
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:02,187
So, I heard about your, uh,

292
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:03,855
glee lesson.

293
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,158
About last chances
and finally saying

294
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,759
everything you want to say.

295
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:09,027
Yeah, I think that

296
00:13:09,062 --> 00:13:11,196
the kids are really
taking to it. Mmm.

297
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,831
This is delicious.

298
00:13:12,865 --> 00:13:14,933
I boiled the pasta
in the hot tub

299
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,134
in the training room.

300
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,936
I-I changed the water first.

301
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:20,005
But there is something
about that thing

302
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:22,374
that just gives it
the perfect al dente.

303
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:23,875
All right.

304
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,345
So, anyway...

305
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,980
Oh, man.

306
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:30,048
I have punched a charging hippo

307
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,216
square in the face,

308
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,353
and not been as scared
as I am right now.

309
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,721
Talk to me.
What-what is going on?

310
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:37,723
You are the...
the first guy

311
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:40,659
that was ever willing
to kiss me.

312
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:42,294
The first one that...

313
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:44,229
ever made me feel like a girl.

314
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:47,232
I am proud to have been
that man in your life.

315
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:49,835
(exhales)

316
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:51,169
Whoa.
(chuckles)

317
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:54,439
I want you to be
the man in my life.

318
00:13:54,474 --> 00:13:57,376
For the first time
since we've known each other,

319
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,312
we're both single.

320
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:03,415
Oh, please...

321
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:05,117
say something.

322
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:07,352
I...

323
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:09,221
If you don't,
I'm-I'm gonna die.

324
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:11,223
Shannon...

325
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:13,425
Emma and I are back together.

326
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:15,193
I've been meaning
to tell you about it.

327
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:17,262
I mean, we have been
for a week or so.

328
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:19,464
I-I want you be happy
for me, and I-I...

329
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:21,199
Let's just talk about this

330
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:23,268
over this incredible dinner.

331
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:25,103
I... I don't think I have
much of an appetite.

332
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:26,304
I'm sorry.

333
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,573
Shannon...

334
00:14:31,778 --> 00:14:33,779
(sighs heavily)

335
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:36,982
(school bell rings)

336
00:14:37,016 --> 00:14:39,117
(cell phone buzzes)

337
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,824
RYDER:
Of course I'm mad...

338
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,994
Esteemed members
of the Astronomy Club,

339
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:24,329
I have an announcement.

340
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:26,264
I have recently discovered that

341
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:28,467
the Tubbington-Bopp
is not an asteroid.

342
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,502
<i>It is a dead ladybug</i>

343
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:32,504
<i>at the end of my telescope.</i>

344
00:15:32,538 --> 00:15:34,005
And I have also discovered

345
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,441
that my telescope
is not a telescope.

346
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:39,945
It is a Pringles can.

347
00:15:39,979 --> 00:15:43,348
Hallelujah, we're saved.

348
00:15:43,382 --> 00:15:45,183
(whoops) Oh, thank God.
(cheering)

349
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:47,586
However, however, I...

350
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,588
feel that I have disgraced
this fine institution

351
00:15:49,622 --> 00:15:51,790
and I am hereby disbanding
the Astronomy Club.

352
00:15:51,824 --> 00:15:54,292
What? This club
is my community service.

353
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:57,129
Shine on, young astronomers,
and I guess good night.

354
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:59,164
Forever.

355
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,333
It's good news, we're alive.

356
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:06,705
Can I talk to you for a second?

357
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:08,306
Sure. What's up?

358
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:10,308
The meteor made me realize

359
00:16:10,343 --> 00:16:13,145
that there is something
I really want to say to you.

360
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,547
Brittany, I have always
looked up to you.

361
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:17,883
Thank you, Becky.

362
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:20,685
Let's both not ever graduate.

363
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,221
The-the world out there
is really scary.

364
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,856
Someday, they will

365
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:26,892
make me leave here,

366
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:29,227
and I don't know
what I'm going to do.

367
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:31,229
Okay, but, Becky,
I can't stay here.

368
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:33,698
I aced my SATs, which means

369
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,066
that if I graduate,

370
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:37,202
I can go to whatever college
I want to.

371
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:39,704
But I can't go to college.

372
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:41,239
Becky, I know it's scary.

373
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:43,575
And it would be so cool

374
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:45,243
to be a Cheerio again
with you next year.

375
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:48,213
But I have to move on.

376
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:49,714
And so do you.

377
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,717
And if you really
prepare yourself,

378
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:55,887
the world won't seem
like such a scary place.

379
00:16:57,089 --> 00:16:58,790
Pinkie promise.

380
00:16:58,825 --> 00:16:59,591
Pinkie promise that.

381
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:03,895
I love you, Brittany.

382
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,130
I love you, too.

383
00:17:08,465 --> 00:17:09,665
Hey, Will, you wanted to see me?

384
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,767
We wanted you to join us

385
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:13,102
for our first annual.

386
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:15,171
"Thank God the World
Isn't Ending" glee practice.

387
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:16,806
It's where I can throw
Junior Mints at Marley

388
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,174
without feeling
bad about it again.

389
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,175
Sit down.

390
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:20,843
Mm, I don't know, Will.

391
00:17:20,877 --> 00:17:22,011
Come on, we're gonna
sing some songs,

392
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:23,613
maybe bust out
a few dance moves.

393
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:25,114
I may even rap.
(laughs)

394
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:26,449
Okay.

395
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:27,817
All right!

396
00:17:27,851 --> 00:17:28,951
Let's get started.

397
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:30,152
(gunshot)

398
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:32,688
(screaming in distance,
running footsteps)

399
00:17:32,723 --> 00:17:35,024
(gunshot)
(shouting in distance)

400
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:37,360
Everyone just spread out
and hide, spread out and hide.

401
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:38,527
Find a place to hide!

402
00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:40,196
Please, go over there.
No, wait...

403
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:45,401
(running footsteps)

404
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:47,536
(girl screams,
students clamoring)

405
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:52,708
(metronome ticking)

406
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:06,022
Are we even sure
those are gunshots?

407
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:07,456
Shh!

408
00:18:15,465 --> 00:18:17,466
(footsteps in distance)

409
00:18:18,702 --> 00:18:20,202
(girl sobbing)

410
00:18:20,237 --> 00:18:21,704
Here, hey, guys, guys, guys.

411
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:24,273
Start texting, tweeting,

412
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:26,442
let everyone know
what's going on.

413
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:27,710
But don't tell them
we're here, all right?

414
00:18:27,744 --> 00:18:29,712
Shooters have smartphones, too.

415
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:32,682
(quietly):
It's okay.

416
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:34,917
(metronome ticking)

417
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:42,325
WILL:
Guys...

418
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,961
we're all just gonna
stay here, okay?

419
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:48,230
Got nowhere to be,
we don't know what's out there.

420
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:51,434
Shh. Shh.

421
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:54,337
(cell phone buzzes)

422
00:18:54,371 --> 00:18:57,239
WILL:
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

423
00:18:57,274 --> 00:18:59,442
I love you guys.

424
00:19:05,615 --> 00:19:07,616
(running footsteps approaching)

425
00:19:11,822 --> 00:19:13,456
(doorknob rattles)

426
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,691
(footsteps continue)

427
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:17,727
(doorknob rattles,
footsteps continue)

428
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:19,662
(door slams shut,
Beiste cries out)

429
00:19:22,332 --> 00:19:23,632
It's okay.

430
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:24,700
Shh.

431
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:26,535
It's okay.

432
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,170
It's all right.

433
00:19:29,673 --> 00:19:31,040
Sam.
Sam.

434
00:19:31,074 --> 00:19:33,976
Sam. What are
you doing?

435
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,379
Sam, get down. Get down. Get down.
I have to go.

436
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:37,747
Brittany doesn't
have her phone on her.

437
00:19:37,781 --> 00:19:38,814
She's in the bathroom.
She left it here.

438
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,282
Sam, Sam, sit down.

439
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:42,451
Sam, sit down.

440
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:47,390
(sighs)

441
00:19:47,424 --> 00:19:49,859
Tina isn't here, either.

442
00:19:52,763 --> 00:19:54,730
(sniffling)

443
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:56,565
(metronome ticking)

444
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,601
(water running)

445
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:07,676
(crying softly)

446
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:10,045
(sniffles)

447
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:20,022
(sniffles)

448
00:20:20,056 --> 00:20:22,057
(faucet dripping)

449
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:34,770
KITTY:
Who are you texting?

450
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:36,839
It's my mom.

451
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:42,011
There's no back way out
when you're in the kitchen.

452
00:20:42,045 --> 00:20:43,179
(sobs)

453
00:20:43,213 --> 00:20:45,080
(metronome ticking)

454
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:47,349
(sobbing) JAKE: It's
okay, it's okay.

455
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:48,717
Where is she?

456
00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:52,555
(phone buzzing)

457
00:20:54,124 --> 00:20:56,992
(steam hissing)

458
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:05,835
I don't know why
she's not answering.

459
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:07,036
She'll be okay.
No one's gonna hurt your mom.

460
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,337
(sobbing)

461
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:09,905
Everyone really likes her.

462
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:16,345
Marley.

463
00:21:18,315 --> 00:21:19,482
When we were doing <i>Grease,</i>

464
00:21:19,516 --> 00:21:20,850
I took in all your costumes

465
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:22,551
so that you'd think
you were fat.

466
00:21:22,586 --> 00:21:23,752
(sniffles)

467
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:27,456
I'm so sorry.

468
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:29,425
(sobbing)

469
00:21:31,228 --> 00:21:33,229
(metronome ticking)

470
00:21:33,263 --> 00:21:35,064
(Kitty sobbing)

471
00:21:35,098 --> 00:21:36,398
KITTY:
I have to go.

472
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:37,700
Where are you going?
I have to go.

473
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:38,734
JAKE:
No, are you crazy?

474
00:21:38,768 --> 00:21:39,735
Shh.

475
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:40,970
Kitty.
Stay down.

476
00:21:41,004 --> 00:21:41,971
Kitty.

477
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:43,839
Yes!
Kitty. Kitty.

478
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:45,741
Kitty.

479
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:47,643
Kitty. Stay down.

480
00:21:47,677 --> 00:21:49,111
Get down!

481
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:52,915
Sam. Sam. I have to go.
I got to go.

482
00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:54,250
She's out there all alone, she
doesn't have anybody out there.

483
00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:55,251
Sam, no.
I have to go, I don't care.

484
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:56,852
Come on, Sam.
I don't care.

485
00:21:56,887 --> 00:21:58,220
Come on, Sam!

486
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:00,022
No, let go of me!
I'm going!

487
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:01,423
Sam!
(muffled shouting)

488
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,259
BEISTE:
Sam, listen!

489
00:22:03,293 --> 00:22:04,727
I don't care!
Shh!

490
00:22:04,761 --> 00:22:06,328
(muffled):
I don't care!

491
00:22:06,363 --> 00:22:07,696
Sam, listen.

492
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:10,799
You are putting
everybody's life in danger.

493
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:11,934
Look at them.

494
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,102
Look at them.

495
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:14,470
(crying) Look at them.

496
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:16,639
Sam, it's okay.

497
00:22:16,673 --> 00:22:18,607
It's okay, Sam.

498
00:22:18,642 --> 00:22:20,109
Sam, go sit.
Go sit with Artie.

499
00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:22,811
Go sit with him.

500
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:24,547
(girl coughs)

501
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:26,582
(metronome ticking)

502
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,559
(sniffling)

503
00:22:36,593 --> 00:22:38,594
(steam hissing)

504
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:48,270
(faucet dripping)

505
00:22:50,106 --> 00:22:52,074
(sighs)

506
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:54,109
(rhythmic ticking)

507
00:22:57,213 --> 00:22:59,114
(sighs) Shh.

508
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:00,849
Ryder, what are you doing?

509
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:02,351
(whispers loudly):
Get down!

510
00:23:02,385 --> 00:23:04,853
What are you doing?

511
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:07,690
What are you doing?

512
00:23:08,892 --> 00:23:12,194
(sighs)

513
00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:14,229
(scattered screaming, sirens
wailing, indistinct chatter)

514
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,667
Principal Figgins,
I need to go back in.

515
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:19,868
It's Glee practice,

516
00:23:19,903 --> 00:23:21,036
and everyone is
in the choir room. I was late.

517
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:22,705
No way. Not until
the police go in

518
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:24,707
and give the all-clear!

519
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:27,176
(indistinct crowd chatter)

520
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:30,779
(beep)
Artie, what are you doing?

521
00:23:30,814 --> 00:23:34,216
ARTIE: If we don't get out of
here, people need to see this.

522
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,518
(metronome ticking)

523
00:23:36,553 --> 00:23:39,088
Does anybody have anything
they want to say?

524
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:41,123
RYDER:
Yeah. Me.

525
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:44,593
(sniffles)

526
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:46,161
(sighs)

527
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:47,963
(panting)

528
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:50,432
I love you, Dad.

529
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:53,469
Thanks for, like... everything.

530
00:23:53,503 --> 00:23:56,038
And I know
I don't always let you know,

531
00:23:56,072 --> 00:23:58,173
but you've taught me a lot.

532
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,209
(sighs)

533
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:05,214
(sniffles)

534
00:24:05,248 --> 00:24:08,450
There's a fake bottom...
to my desk drawer.

535
00:24:08,485 --> 00:24:09,718
(sniffles)

536
00:24:09,753 --> 00:24:12,121
If you look under it, um...

537
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:15,891
there's a journal with a bunch
of songs that I wrote.

538
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,596
I've never told anyone,
but I'm really proud of them.

539
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,968
(sighs)

540
00:24:26,002 --> 00:24:27,736
Uh... (sniffles)

541
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:29,038
Mom, Puck...
(sniffles loudly)

542
00:24:29,072 --> 00:24:31,240
...I love you guys.
(cries)

543
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:33,909
BEISTE:
You guys. Turn it off.

544
00:24:33,943 --> 00:24:35,377
Please turn it off.

545
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:37,980
ARTIE:
Sam...

546
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:39,048
(beep)

547
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:41,050
(faucet dripping)

548
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:43,085
(loud thud of door opening)

549
00:24:44,954 --> 00:24:46,955
(footsteps approaching slowly)

550
00:24:51,695 --> 00:24:53,696
(footsteps)

551
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:57,533
(faucet dripping)

552
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:06,041
WILL:
Brittany?

553
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:08,677
Mr. Shue.

554
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,281
Oh.

555
00:25:12,315 --> 00:25:13,716
(sighs, sniffles)

556
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,317
(stall door latches click open)

557
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:16,485
It's okay.

558
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,220
(Brittany sniffles,
stall doors squeak open)

559
00:25:18,254 --> 00:25:20,155
(sighs)

560
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,057
Everyone all right?

561
00:25:22,092 --> 00:25:25,461
(sniffles) I want to call her.

562
00:25:25,495 --> 00:25:26,662
JAKE:
Who?

563
00:25:26,696 --> 00:25:28,831
Katie.

564
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:30,432
I thought you said
she was fake?

565
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:32,468
Look, she's someone...

566
00:25:32,502 --> 00:25:34,503
and I still care
about her, okay?

567
00:25:35,505 --> 00:25:37,005
(sniffles)

568
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,074
I'm calling her.
Yeah.

569
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:40,409
(sniffles)

570
00:25:40,443 --> 00:25:42,745
(sighs)
Come on, pick up, pick up.

571
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,748
Pick up, please. Please.

572
00:25:45,782 --> 00:25:48,851
(phone ringing)

573
00:25:48,885 --> 00:25:50,018
Shh!

574
00:25:50,053 --> 00:25:51,987
(phone continues ringing)

575
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:53,555
(metronome ticking)

576
00:25:57,393 --> 00:25:59,361
(indistinct,
overlapping whispering)

577
00:25:59,395 --> 00:26:01,663
(whispers loudly):
Turn it off!

578
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:03,932
Turn the phone off.
Shh.

579
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:05,501
You guys find that phone,
and turn it off.

580
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:06,602
Hang up.
Hang up the phone, Ryder.

581
00:26:06,636 --> 00:26:07,703
Hang up.
Hang up.

582
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:09,204
Hang up... the phone.
Shh! Shh! Shut up!

583
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:11,206
Hang up the phone.
Shh.

584
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:13,242
(phone stops ringing)

585
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,612
(Ryder bangs the phone
on the floor)

586
00:26:16,646 --> 00:26:18,614
(metronome ticking)

587
00:26:18,648 --> 00:26:21,083
(sniffling)

588
00:26:27,323 --> 00:26:29,324
(knocking)

589
00:26:31,194 --> 00:26:32,528
(Will whispers indistinctly)

590
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:37,332
(whispers indistinctly)

591
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:46,675
(Will sighs)

592
00:26:48,178 --> 00:26:49,812
COP:
All clear!

593
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:52,281
(girl crying)

594
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:53,549
(quietly):
Is everybody here?

595
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,652
All clear!

596
00:26:56,686 --> 00:26:58,887
All clear!
(Will sighs heavily)

597
00:26:58,922 --> 00:27:00,489
Oh, my God.

598
00:27:00,523 --> 00:27:01,690
All clear!

599
00:27:01,724 --> 00:27:02,858
(sighs and indistinct chatter)

600
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:05,360
All clear!

601
00:27:05,395 --> 00:27:07,729
(sighing) My God.

602
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:10,299
(sniffles)

603
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,401
(muffled cries)

604
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:14,570
(sniffles)

605
00:27:14,604 --> 00:27:16,572
(Beiste grunting)

606
00:27:16,606 --> 00:27:17,906
(sobbing)

607
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:19,741
WILL:
Come here.

608
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:21,543
Come here. Come here. Come here.

609
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:22,911
Where's Tina? You
guys get over here.

610
00:27:22,946 --> 00:27:24,079
You guys, come here.

611
00:27:24,113 --> 00:27:25,247
You kids, get in here.

612
00:27:25,281 --> 00:27:26,582
(crying) Come here.

613
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:28,250
It's okay. It's okay.
We're all here.

614
00:27:28,284 --> 00:27:30,085
(crying)

615
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,587
I love you all.

616
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:33,088
I love you guys.

617
00:27:33,122 --> 00:27:36,225
Every one of you.

618
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:38,260
You guys were awesome.

619
00:27:40,096 --> 00:27:42,097
(metronome ticking)

620
00:27:45,768 --> 00:27:48,070
(indistinct chatter)

621
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,046
(sighs heavily)

622
00:27:58,081 --> 00:28:00,082
(indistinct chatter, crying)

623
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:10,751
(school bell ringing)

624
00:28:13,054 --> 00:28:15,455
(spray can shaking)

625
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:27,968
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

626
00:28:28,002 --> 00:28:29,669
(high-pitched squeaking)

627
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:31,938
(beep)

628
00:28:31,973 --> 00:28:33,640
Seriously?

629
00:28:33,674 --> 00:28:34,975
(beep)

630
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:36,910
(high-pitched squeaking)

631
00:28:36,944 --> 00:28:39,412
SUE: At the risk of
stepping out of character,

632
00:28:39,447 --> 00:28:42,249
I brought donuts to calm
everyone's frayed nerves,

633
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:44,618
until some rent-a-cop
put his greasy palm prints

634
00:28:44,652 --> 00:28:46,052
all over my French crullers.

635
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:47,788
Hmm. I don't mind.

636
00:28:47,822 --> 00:28:49,890
I'll never forget
the look on their faces

637
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:51,825
when that gun went off.

638
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:53,894
Something was taken from them...

639
00:28:53,928 --> 00:28:57,063
their innocence, their idealism,

640
00:28:57,098 --> 00:28:58,298
their feeling of safety.

641
00:28:58,332 --> 00:28:59,800
BEISTE:
I just hope we get

642
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:01,034
the students back.

643
00:29:01,068 --> 00:29:03,403
Half of them didn't
even show up today.

644
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:05,238
Oh, my goodness,
I haven't seen this

645
00:29:05,273 --> 00:29:06,640
level of overreaction

646
00:29:06,674 --> 00:29:09,810
since Janet Jackson showed her
saggy fun bag at the Super Bowl.

647
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:12,145
What if it wasn't even a gun?

648
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,815
You ever think about that?
Cops didn't find one.

649
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:15,816
It could just as easily
have been firecrackers,

650
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,983
or a car backfiring.

651
00:29:17,018 --> 00:29:18,151
I grew up on a farm,

652
00:29:18,186 --> 00:29:20,086
and I know what
a gunshot sounds like.

653
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:21,321
Somebody fired

654
00:29:21,355 --> 00:29:22,489
a gun in this school.

655
00:29:22,523 --> 00:29:25,091
And quite frankly,
I don't feel safe

656
00:29:25,126 --> 00:29:26,893
knowing there's some kid
with a gun

657
00:29:26,928 --> 00:29:28,829
stuffed in his backpack
walking around these halls.

658
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:30,730
No. Either the kid
took the gun home,

659
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:33,333
in which case, they won't
be able to bring it back

660
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:34,801
because of the new
metal detectors.

661
00:29:34,836 --> 00:29:36,236
Or the kid stashed it somewhere

662
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,504
here at school.
Yeah.

663
00:29:37,538 --> 00:29:40,073
In which case, the police
are going to find it.

664
00:29:40,107 --> 00:29:41,942
I mean, they are
searching every locker,

665
00:29:41,976 --> 00:29:43,677
and interviewing
every single student.

666
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:45,512
Every single student?

667
00:29:45,546 --> 00:29:49,015
Yeah. Then when they find
who did it, the kid's

668
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,051
going to be expelled.

669
00:29:53,287 --> 00:29:56,189
Well, no student's
going to get expelled.

670
00:29:56,224 --> 00:29:58,191
BEISTE:
Why not?

671
00:29:58,226 --> 00:30:00,227
'Cause it was my gun.

672
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:10,437
(school bell ringing)

673
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:12,005
It's registered.

674
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,540
I have a license for it.

675
00:30:13,574 --> 00:30:15,508
I'm sorry,
but in light of recent events,

676
00:30:15,543 --> 00:30:17,677
I feel more safe
with it in my office.

677
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:19,946
Look, Sue, I'm not going
to argue the merits

678
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:21,781
of armed teachers right now.

679
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:24,217
It's a different world from
when you and I started teaching.

680
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:25,552
Or rather,
when I started teaching,

681
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:27,587
and you started doing
whatever it is that you do.

682
00:30:27,622 --> 00:30:28,755
The safety net

683
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:32,259
of the public
mental health system is gone.

684
00:30:32,293 --> 00:30:35,095
Parents with troubled kids
are too busy working three jobs

685
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:36,763
to look after them,

686
00:30:36,797 --> 00:30:39,900
and the gun yahoos
have everyone so worked up

687
00:30:39,934 --> 00:30:41,835
about Obama
taking away their guns

688
00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:44,905
that every house has
a readily-available arsenal.

689
00:30:44,939 --> 00:30:47,440
But having a gun
to make you feel safe,

690
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:51,444
and shooting it in school
are two different things.

691
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:53,246
I was just doing my daily

692
00:30:53,281 --> 00:30:55,615
<i>safety check,</i>
<i>making sure Uma Thurman...</i>

693
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,517
<i>that's what I call her...</i>

694
00:30:57,551 --> 00:31:00,754
<i>was locked up tight, and</i>
<i>she accidentally went off.</i>

695
00:31:00,788 --> 00:31:04,124
When she fired, I dropped her,

696
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:07,260
and the second shot came
when the gun hit the floor.

697
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:08,862
This doesn't make
any sense, Sue.

698
00:31:08,896 --> 00:31:11,798
Bullets leave bullet marks,
shell casings.

699
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:13,934
The casings are at
the bottom of a lake.

700
00:31:13,968 --> 00:31:16,937
And I moved some posters
and a tub of protein powder

701
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:18,571
to cover up the holes.

702
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:20,640
"Cover-up" is
the optimal phrase.

703
00:31:20,675 --> 00:31:22,709
I panicked.

704
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:25,111
Okay? I'm...

705
00:31:25,146 --> 00:31:27,113
I'm sorry.

706
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:28,448
It took a couple

707
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:31,084
of days for me
to come to my senses,

708
00:31:31,118 --> 00:31:35,355
but I'm here now,
ready to take my punishment.

709
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:41,795
You do realize
my hands are tied, don't you?

710
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:44,798
I have to report to the police
and the school board.

711
00:31:44,832 --> 00:31:47,801
There are policies
in place, Sue.

712
00:31:47,835 --> 00:31:49,903
Zero tolerance policies.

713
00:31:49,937 --> 00:31:52,372
Yeah, I'm aware of them.

714
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:57,143
You know, it's funny
how this stuff works out.

715
00:31:57,178 --> 00:32:00,513
An entire career doing
the right thing, winning.

716
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,618
I sent Cheerios off
to the Ivy Leagues.

717
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:08,088
I educated girls who are CEOs

718
00:32:08,122 --> 00:32:10,390
of Fortune 500 companies.

719
00:32:10,424 --> 00:32:13,093
They're mothers,
gold medalists.

720
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:15,095
I've coached two Grammy winners,

721
00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:17,097
an Internet billionaire

722
00:32:17,131 --> 00:32:20,133
and a lesbian
secretary of state.

723
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:27,307
But all I'll be remembered for

724
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:29,442
is this one thing.

725
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:35,782
It'll be the first line
of my obituary.

726
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:39,786
I'm sorry, Sue.

727
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,188
I have no choice.

728
00:32:55,489 --> 00:32:59,422
BLAINE: I couldn't sleep,
neither could my mom and dad,

729
00:32:59,456 --> 00:33:02,492
so we just stayed up
all night, talking

730
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:04,460
and crying
and hugging each other.

731
00:33:04,495 --> 00:33:05,928
I know.

732
00:33:05,963 --> 00:33:08,131
My parents wanted me
to stay home this week,

733
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:10,333
but I told them, no way.

734
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,104
It sounds crazy,
Blaine, but I...

735
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:18,007
I wanted to be in that
choir room with you guys.

736
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:19,342
Believe me, you didn't.

737
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:20,826
It was the most scared I think
I've ever been in my life.

738
00:33:20,843 --> 00:33:23,144
Me, too, but not because
of what was happening,

739
00:33:23,178 --> 00:33:24,912
but because I
couldn't get to you,

740
00:33:24,947 --> 00:33:27,115
or do anything
to help you, or...

741
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:29,984
(sighs)

742
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:32,053
(voice breaking):
Or even say good-bye.

743
00:33:32,087 --> 00:33:35,823
I-I think the important thing is
that no one got hurt.

744
00:33:35,858 --> 00:33:37,925
Yeah. (Sniffles)

745
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,328
And that you know
that you're my family.

746
00:33:40,362 --> 00:33:41,662
(sniffles)

747
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:43,965
Everybody in that room
is my family.

748
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:46,968
And I didn't want the
last thing you guys heard

749
00:33:47,002 --> 00:33:49,837
from me is some snarky comment
about how I never get solos.

750
00:33:49,872 --> 00:33:51,005
(laughs)

751
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,040
(crying)

752
00:33:57,713 --> 00:33:59,714
(laughing)

753
00:34:03,337 --> 00:34:04,904
Oh, I love you, Tina.

754
00:34:04,938 --> 00:34:06,506
(laughs)

755
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,774
Oh.

756
00:34:07,808 --> 00:34:09,509
(soft laugh)

757
00:34:09,543 --> 00:34:12,044
Now you listen to me.

758
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,248
You were there
in the choir room with us.

759
00:34:15,282 --> 00:34:16,816
Mm-hmm.
Okay?

760
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,818
You were there.

761
00:34:18,852 --> 00:34:20,219
(Tina cries) Come on.

762
00:34:27,694 --> 00:34:30,496
(school bell rings) Read my lips
because we know you can't read words.

763
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:31,664
I didn't catfish you.

764
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:32,832
I'm not into guys

765
00:34:32,866 --> 00:34:34,801
who look like life-sized
cartoon wieners.

766
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:36,235
Now excuse me,
because just thinking

767
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,137
about me and you dating
makes me drier

768
00:34:38,172 --> 00:34:39,806
than the cast
of <i>Hot in Cleveland.</i>

769
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,308
It's totally her.
Think of it.

770
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:45,077
Kitty and Katie are
practically the same name.

771
00:34:45,112 --> 00:34:47,180
That's genius,
because it's so obvious.

772
00:34:47,214 --> 00:34:49,849
Brittany's dating Sam,
Unique's ringtone is.

773
00:34:49,883 --> 00:34:51,818
"Bootylicious," and Sugar
and Tina weren't even there.

774
00:34:51,852 --> 00:34:53,519
Okay, so what if it is Kitty?

775
00:34:53,554 --> 00:34:55,021
Would it really be that bad?

776
00:34:55,055 --> 00:34:57,456
You have to admit,
she has been much cooler lately,

777
00:34:57,491 --> 00:35:00,092
and maybe the only way
she can be completely honest is

778
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:01,360
by being anonymous.

779
00:35:01,395 --> 00:35:02,962
What if it's that bass player

780
00:35:02,996 --> 00:35:04,530
with the bowl cut, or

781
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:05,698
Brad, the piano player?

782
00:35:05,732 --> 00:35:07,533
W-Whoever it is,
I'll find out at 3:30.

783
00:35:07,568 --> 00:35:08,868
Okay?
Mm-hmm.

784
00:35:08,902 --> 00:35:11,504
(sighs)

785
00:35:11,538 --> 00:35:12,905
(school bell ringing) Okay.

786
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:15,174
The first word I'd use

787
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:16,843
to describe you would be brave.

788
00:35:16,877 --> 00:35:18,377
Hmm.

789
00:35:18,412 --> 00:35:20,880
Then, funny,
strong inside and out,

790
00:35:20,914 --> 00:35:24,217
great hugger,
and wears kick-ass red lipstick.

791
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:28,454
In fact, that's what I used
to describe you in this.

792
00:35:28,488 --> 00:35:29,555
(beep)

793
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,291
Online dating?

794
00:35:32,326 --> 00:35:34,961
Nobody ever meets anyone
on this.

795
00:35:34,995 --> 00:35:36,162
Of course they do.

796
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:37,897
How do you think
everyone's meeting up nowadays?

797
00:35:37,931 --> 00:35:40,800
How did you know
my favorite Beatle was George?

798
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:43,236
And my favorite food was everything?
(laughs)

799
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,472
You know, I-I...
I could not have gone

800
00:35:46,506 --> 00:35:50,042
through that horror
the other day without you.

801
00:35:50,077 --> 00:35:53,112
I know this seems scary, but...

802
00:35:53,146 --> 00:35:55,014
the time for you
to get out there is now.

803
00:35:55,048 --> 00:35:57,450
Thank you, Will,
for doing this for me.

804
00:35:57,484 --> 00:35:59,085
I love you.

805
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,620
I love you, too.

806
00:36:02,456 --> 00:36:05,358
So, you think anyone's going
to respond to this? Jackpot.

807
00:36:05,392 --> 00:36:06,759
You got one already. Hmm.

808
00:36:06,793 --> 00:36:08,294
He's in Oregon,

809
00:36:08,328 --> 00:36:10,296
he's a former
football coach, too.

810
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,798
(chimes) Ken Tanaka.

811
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:14,834
(chuckles)

812
00:36:16,236 --> 00:36:18,204
(school bell ringing)

813
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:20,273
Hi, baby.

814
00:36:20,307 --> 00:36:22,208
Are you feeling
any more normal?

815
00:36:22,242 --> 00:36:24,310
Not really.

816
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:27,914
I mean, I was genuinely scared
when I was in the choir room,

817
00:36:27,948 --> 00:36:30,783
and you were out here all alone.

818
00:36:30,817 --> 00:36:32,051
Couldn't stop thinking
about you.

819
00:36:32,085 --> 00:36:33,819
You were all
I thought about, too.

820
00:36:33,854 --> 00:36:35,621
Not Lord Tubbington?

821
00:36:35,656 --> 00:36:38,224
No. At first, I thought he might
be the one doing the shooting.

822
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:40,126
I've kind of been a jerk
about him lately.

823
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,395
I mean, it's not like
he's that nice to me.

824
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:44,397
I shut down his
e-mail account

825
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:46,565
so he wouldn't send you
any more harassing messages.

826
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,568
Look, he's your cat,
and if he's important to you,

827
00:36:49,603 --> 00:36:51,070
he's important to me, too.

828
00:36:51,104 --> 00:36:52,738
That said...
Mm.

829
00:36:52,773 --> 00:36:54,106
I've been thinking

830
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:55,975
that we needed something
that's really ours.

831
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:57,743
We had a fake wedding,

832
00:36:57,778 --> 00:37:00,179
and I think we should
also start a fake family.

833
00:37:00,213 --> 00:37:03,182
Did you get me a fake baby?
Better.

834
00:37:06,453 --> 00:37:07,420
(gasps)

835
00:37:07,454 --> 00:37:09,288
Her name is Lady Tubbington.

836
00:37:09,323 --> 00:37:12,158
I made sure to get a fat one
at the shelter

837
00:37:12,192 --> 00:37:13,693
so Lord Tubbington
doesn't feel self-conscious.

838
00:37:13,727 --> 00:37:14,927
Oh.

839
00:37:14,962 --> 00:37:17,530
How long was she in there for?

840
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:18,531
A while.

841
00:37:18,565 --> 00:37:20,599
(growling) Oh.

842
00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:22,168
She's amazing.

843
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:23,569
Mm.

844
00:37:23,603 --> 00:37:25,004
I love you.
I love you.

845
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:30,475
(footsteps approaching)

846
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,511
(sighs)

847
00:37:35,615 --> 00:37:38,083
Why, Sue?
Why did you do it?

848
00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:40,585
Well, I had my reasons.

849
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,255
I explained them to
Principal Figgins.

850
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:46,057
I heard... but I don't
accept that.

851
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,395
Bringing a gun to school?
That's not you.

852
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,063
BECKY:
<i>I was scared, Coach.</i>

853
00:37:52,098 --> 00:37:54,433
About graduating,
being out in the world

854
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:55,934
with no one to protect me.

855
00:37:55,968 --> 00:37:58,503
Honey, told you. You will always
have a place here.

856
00:37:58,538 --> 00:38:00,839
No. I wanted to be prepared

857
00:38:00,873 --> 00:38:02,274
and protect myself!

858
00:38:02,308 --> 00:38:05,911
I need help.

859
00:38:05,945 --> 00:38:07,846
I don't know what
to tell you, Will.

860
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,648
I stand by my actions.

861
00:38:10,817 --> 00:38:13,084
Becky... give me the gun.

862
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,086
Where did you get that?

863
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:16,922
It's my dad's.
I wanted to be ready.

864
00:38:16,956 --> 00:38:19,424
Oh, I know sweetheart.
Don't worry about it.

865
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:21,293
I completely understand.
Just-just give me the gun.

866
00:38:22,128 --> 00:38:23,395
So, that's it?

867
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:24,896
This is how it ends?

868
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:27,332
Give me something
so I can talk to Figgins.

869
00:38:27,366 --> 00:38:29,601
Let me help you.

870
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,441
(gunshot, Sue gasps,
Becky gasps)

871
00:38:36,476 --> 00:38:37,843
(gunshot)

872
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:39,544
I'm sorry, Coach.
(people screaming and shouting)

873
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:41,546
(crying):
I'm sorry.

874
00:38:41,581 --> 00:38:42,781
Shh.

875
00:38:42,815 --> 00:38:44,049
Shh. It's okay.

876
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,184
BOY: Come on! Oh! It's okay.

877
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:47,853
I'll take care of it.

878
00:38:47,887 --> 00:38:50,288
Keep an eye on Becky, will you?

879
00:38:50,323 --> 00:38:51,923
She's tough,

880
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:53,925
but like all the kids,

881
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,961
she gets scared sometimes.

882
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:07,339
Thanks, buddy.

883
00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:11,176
(school bell ringing)

884
00:39:25,992 --> 00:39:28,693
(footsteps approaching)

885
00:39:32,865 --> 00:39:34,966
Shouldn't you be at
the mandatory school assembly?

886
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:36,601
We're having a secret
Glee Club meeting instead,

887
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:37,869
but I was waiting for someone.

888
00:39:39,438 --> 00:39:41,006
She was supposed
to meet me here at 3:30.

889
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,208
Well, good luck with that.

890
00:39:43,242 --> 00:39:44,709
What?

891
00:39:44,744 --> 00:39:47,512
Aren't you gonna write me up
for not being at the assembly?

892
00:39:47,547 --> 00:39:49,548
I would, but I don't
work here anymore.

893

00:42:36,716 --> 00:42:39,150
Hi, Mom and Dad.
I just wanted you to know...

945
00:42:39,185 --> 00:42:41,352
(sniffles)
...that I love you.

946

Even though...
maybe it didn't seem like it.

948
00:42:48,027 --> 00:42:49,728
I just want to say

949
00:42:49,762 --> 00:42:53,562
that I've had the best
experience of my entire life

950
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,001
in this room, and that I love
these people more than anything.
