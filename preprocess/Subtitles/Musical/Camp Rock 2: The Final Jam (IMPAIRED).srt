Oh, my gosh, I can't believe
we're finally here.

Oh, wait. I told Shane I'd text
him once we're almost there.

Oh, Mitchie...

What?
Nothing, nothing.

Mom, obviously it's something.

I mean, you and subtle
aren't very good friends.

the time, but, you know, it's...

You actually haven't seen
this boy in almost a year.

I just don't want you to be
too disappointed, honey,

to camp this summer.

I want you to have fun
and focus on your music.

Okay, first off, this is goanna
be the best summer ever.

18
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:03,897
And second, nothing can make me
lose my focus.

19
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:07,034
What is that?
Did somebody open another camp?

another camp across the lake?

Thank you.

goanna get here in time,

but doesn't look like
many are here.

Well, you know what this means.

33

about my life.

and it's for Mitchie.

I feel like if we never get
to spend any time together,

51

then nothing
is ever goanna happen.

Can we please just wait
for the tow truck?

Oliver tried
and he couldn't get it.

Mm-hm.

60
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:57,812
That's because Oliver's
not properly motivated.

61
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,814
He's not trying to get
to Camp Rock before Mitchie.

62
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:02,015
We should have never taken
that shortcut.

63
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,585
Maybe because Oliver
doesn't even know Mitchie.

64
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:10,758
Thanks.

It's goanna be really cool.
I got it all planned.

66
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:17,931
She'll walk in, and I'll be
sitting there, and I'll say:

00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,633
"Hey, Mitchie."

68
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,135
She's goanna be
so surprised.

69
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,438
"Hey, Mitchie"?
That's your big line?

70

Trust me.
Everything's cool when I do it.

spend some time with her.

Oh, here you go.
Is this from the tire?

00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:36,183
Yeah. I saw it
on the ground before.

00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:38,151
Thought it was important,
so I put it in my pocket.

00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,653
Why didn't you
tell me this earlier?

76
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:42,823
How could I have told you
if I didn't remember until now?

77
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:44,492
It's fine.
Just one bolt, right?

we can do at opening jam.

I've got nothing.

I don't know. I--

{all cheering}

176
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,042
Yeah! Whoo!
Yeah!

177
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,045
Yes, all right.

178
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:09,382
Mitchie Torres,
returning rocker. Yes!

179
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,354
Welcome to the heart and soul
of rock 'n' roll.

180
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:17,091
Whether you're slick and
happening or dark and jamming,

181
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:20,427
Camp Rock is the place to be,
yeah?

182
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,129
All right!
{all cheering}

183
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:25,532
Now, I'm sure you've noticed

184
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,936
that there aren't quite as many
of you as in years past.

185
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,188
But not to worry.
{horn honking}

186
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:32,555
{squeals}
Ooh.

187
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:33,756
Shane!

188
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,525
Sorry, she does that.

189
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:38,761
BROWN:
Rockers, my nephews,
and Camp Rock alum,

190
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,564
better known to the world
as Connect Three!

191
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:42,932
Hey.

192
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,101
{grunts}

193
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,535
{crowd gasps}

194
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:47,670
We probably shouldn't have
tied his shoes together.

195
00:09:47,738 --> 00:09:50,040
He's the one who said he could
make anything look cool.

196
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:51,975
{squawks}

197
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:55,045
And I believe
he stands corrected.

198
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:57,914
Shane.
Are you all right?

199
00:09:57,982 --> 00:10:00,150
Yeah, I'm fine.
{chuckles}

200
00:10:00,218 --> 00:10:01,351
Surprise.

201
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:03,253
{chuckles}

202
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:05,055
All right.

203
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:08,458
They are goanna be with us
for the entire summer.

204
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,060
The whole summer?

205
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:12,595
Absolutely.
{chuckles}

206
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:16,366
The official reason being
they miss their uncle.

207
00:10:16,434 --> 00:10:18,868
But I don't think
that's the entire story.

208
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:21,405
CROWD:
Ooh!

209
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:22,705
People are staring.

210
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:25,842
You might wanna do something,
like react or wave.

211
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,378
Hey, guys. I'm Shane.
This is Jason and Nate.

212
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:30,947
{crowd cheers}

213
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,615
We know it's goanna be hard,

214
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:35,352
but just treat us
like normal campers.

215
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:39,222
Wow, I guess it's not
goanna be that hard.

216
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,957
BROWN:
Yeah, as I was saying,

217
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:42,959
um, we're a little
smaller this year,

218
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:46,563
and that is courtesy of our
new friends across the lake,

219
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,997
Camp Star,

220
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:52,402
founded, not so coincidentally,
by my out-to-destroy-me,

221
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,672
still-mad-that-I-kicked-him
out-of-the-group

222
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,175
former bandmate,
Axel Turner.

223
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,776
Axel Turner?

224
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:02,845
The guy who owns Star Records?
He's across the lake?

225
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:07,016
Yes, and I share your disdain,
Tess. Thank you for that.

226
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:09,553
Now, it's goanna take
some effort,

227
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,154
but I'm sure we can all

228
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:14,724
peacefully co-exist on the lake,
yeah?

229
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:16,793
{dramatic theme playing}

230
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,235
We're under attack!

231
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:36,646
BOY:
Nice.

232
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:43,120
It's full of marshmallows.

233
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:45,489
This one has chocolate.
Whoa.

234
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:47,890
Graham crackers.

235
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:54,531
Camp Rock's invited
to an opening-night bonfire.

236
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:57,501
{all cheering}
No, no, no. Absolutely not. No.

237
00:11:57,568 --> 00:12:00,537
ALL {chanting}:
Bonfire, bonfire, bonfire!

238
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:04,874
This is a setup.
For what I'm not sure.

239
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,043
Come on, Brown. It'll be fun.

240
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:09,579
You said yourself
we all need to get along, right?

241
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:12,215
And it's not just because
I haven't made dessert yet.

242
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:15,652
This is really good chocolate.
Isn't it?

243
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,720
{upbeat theme playing}

244
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:23,926
TESS:
One word: wow.

245
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,396
This isn't a camp,
i-it's a resort.

246
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:28,898
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

247
00:12:30,234 --> 00:12:32,135
All right, I got it.

248
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:35,338
Oh, I don't got it.

249
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,807
I think we should add this
to the uncool list.

250
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,910
A little help--
A little help, please.

251
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:42,279
Thank you. Ah.

252
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,846
See,
these are the type of things

253
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:45,649
that you can't learn
over e-mail.

254
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:47,684
Maybe we should
go back to that.

255
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:52,088
Guys, I'm not kidding.
Line up and wait for me.

256
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:54,057
Junior rockers, I'm serious.

257
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:56,059
Please wait.

258
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:57,360
Hey, what's up, guys?

259
00:12:57,428 --> 00:13:00,363
I remember when I used to be
a junior rocker.

260
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:03,533
I-Is that a camera, bud?
Don't touch it.

261
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:06,269
What, you think I'm goanna drop
it in the water?

262
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:11,308
And if you thought that,
I guess you'd be right.

263
00:13:13,311 --> 00:13:15,645
You dropped it, Curly.
You swim for it.

264
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:16,813
Yeah. Um...

265
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,149
Brown, my man. Long time.

266
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:23,286
Hi, I'm Connie.
Hi.

267
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:26,623
Listen, Axel, I don't actually
know what your plan is--

268
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:27,824
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

269
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,326
A breath and a step.

270
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,294
I'm beginning to remember
why I left the band.

271
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:34,397
Left the band.
You l-- You left the band?

272
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:37,267
That is so rich. Is that what
you're telling people?

273
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:40,637
You, my friend, have got to stop
living in the past.

274
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:42,439
I'm trying to reach out
to you here.

275
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:47,110
Reach out? Reach out by driving
me out of business. I love it.

276
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:49,946
There's no reason why we both
can't be successful.

277
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:52,949
We both have our niche.
Niche?

278
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,084
Camp Star is dedicated
to producing

279
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:56,853
the superstars of tomorrow.

280
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,055
And, uh, what's your place
about again?

281
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:02,792
Encouraging kids
in their love of music, Axel.

282
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,961
Ah.

283
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:07,830
Like I said,
room for both of us.

284
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,303
Y-You know,
just to be clear,

285
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:16,205
he did not leave the band.
We kicked him out.

286
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:19,376
I know, I know.
It's okay.

287
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,011
We kicked him out.

288
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,148
SHANE:
Question: What do you say
you and I break away later

289
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:27,651
and I finally take you
on a first date?

290
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:30,487
Answer:
I'd like that.

291
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,125
MAN:
Check, check. One, two.
Check, check.

292
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:38,628
One, two. Check, check, check.

293
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:40,397
Wow.

294
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,898
I know, right?

295
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,034
That's all I've been saying
since I got off the boat.

296
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,541
Come on.

297
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,948
Ready?
We really shouldn't be here.

298
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:01,984
It's so obvious this guy's just
doing this to get back at Brown.

299
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:04,220
First, he tries to take down
the White Crows,

300
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:06,255
and now Camp Rock.

301
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:07,924
What is that?

302
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,627
Hot chocolate. They're handing
it out free when you walk in,

303
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:12,796
plus you get to keep the mug.

304
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,032
What?

305
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:18,901
There's no way I'm staying
at this bonfire.

306
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:21,871
Hey, pouty boy.
You better hurry.

307
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:23,139
The bonfire's
about to start.

308
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:28,578
You know, we should probably
go take our seats.

309
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:30,447
I think they're about to start.

310
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,848
Mm-hm.

311
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:34,016
Don't mock.
I'm not.

312
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:36,319
Yes, you are.
Okay, just a little bit.

313
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:39,422
Ah.

314
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,091
Look, they actually have
a real Wardrobe department

315
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,361
with incredible fabric.
And they let me make this.

316
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:48,365
Uh-oh. I think I just sewed
my scarf to my bra.

317
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:51,334
So I thought this was supposed
to be a campfire.

318
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:55,772
You know, singing,
telling stories, an actual fire.

319
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,407
Everybody have a seat.

320
00:15:57,475 --> 00:15:59,275
{crowd cheering}

321
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:01,277
I'm Axel Turner.

322
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:06,315
And I'd like to welcome
all you rockers,

323
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:09,853
and my dear, old friend,
Brown Cesario--

324
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:12,589
Yeah, Brown! Whoo!

325
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:14,557

Go, Brown!

328
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:24,066
But you all don't wanna hear
a speech from me.

329
00:16:24,134 --> 00:16:28,605
You wanna get to what a campfire
is really all about:

330
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:30,407
singing.

331
00:16:30,474 --> 00:16:34,076
Hey, that's what you just said.
You're twins. Ha-ha-ha!

332
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:38,615
So does anyone have anything
they'd like to play?

333
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:41,818
Camp Rockers, don't be shy.

334
00:16:41,886 --> 00:16:44,353
{crowd chattering}

335
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:47,957
Well, we'll go,
if nobody else wants to.

336
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:49,826
{crowd cheering}

337
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:05,007
This song is about me
and a friend of mine.

¶¶ Until we figure it out ¶¶

341
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:31,133
¶¶ We sing
"La, la, la, la, la, la" ¶¶

342
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:35,204
¶¶ I know it's simple, yeah
But it's worked ¶¶

343
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:38,842
¶¶ Right up till now ¶¶

344
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:42,512
¶¶ 'Cause up till now, yeah ¶¶

¶¶ Every day's been like
A dream world ¶¶

346
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:52,922
¶¶ Oh, but now you're not
Just in my head ¶¶

347
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,757
¶¶ Oh, no ¶¶

348
00:17:54,825 --> 00:18:00,730
¶¶ Will we remember
Different summers? ¶¶

349
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:03,265
¶¶ It's like tossing your heart ¶¶

350
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,836
¶¶ To see where it lands ¶¶

351

¶¶ If we're starting
All over again ¶¶

354

¶¶ And again and again ¶¶

355
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:29,526
¶¶ Oh, you know that I can't help
But wonder ¶¶

356

¶¶ What's goanna happen next ¶¶

357
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,532

¶¶ When you were under it too ¶¶

361
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:47,510
¶¶ Did you ever think about us? ¶¶

362
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:55,618
¶¶ I hope you did
'Cause I can tell you ¶¶

363
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:59,822
¶¶ That's something
I'll never forget ¶¶

for Camp Star to answer.

And, heh, my apologies

And that's how we do things here

00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:52,882
at Camp Star!

446
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:55,051

Uh, before we go any further,

449
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:03,893
I'd like to make a quick
announcement.

450
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,963
We're having staffing problems.
Who knew we'd be so popular?

451
00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:10,133
All right,
now we're under attack.

452
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,268
So I'd just like
to put it out there.

453
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:15,704
If there are any Camp Rock
counsellors or staff

454
00:24:15,772 --> 00:24:18,141
who'd like to make the switch,

455
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,943
I'd be more than willing
to double your salary.

456
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:24,147
You've gotta be joking. I barely
have enough staff as it is.

457
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,649
I'll go.
What?

458
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:29,052
No.

459
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,588
And, if there are any Camp Rock
campers who'd like to join us,

460
00:24:32,656 --> 00:24:34,823
well, I'm sure we can
find you a bunk.

461
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:39,128
Oh, did I mention
our cabins are air-conditioned?

462
00:24:39,196 --> 00:24:40,729
He can't do this.

463
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:42,665
Right.
I need all the Camp Rockers

464
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,800
back on the boats now. Come on.

465
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:46,035
Go, please.

466
00:24:46,103 --> 00:24:47,336
Come on, guys.
Back to the boats.

467
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:50,606
Let's go. Come on.

468
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:02,051
Are you sure it's okay?

469
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,419
Not a scratch.

470
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:05,421
I'm really sorry
about that.

471
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:08,257
Oh, it's all good.
I'm totally fine.

472
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:10,293
I'm just happy
I could catch it for you.

473
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,695
Well, it's always
kind of been my lucky charm.

474
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:15,931
I guess it still works.

475
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,801
Did you forget the part
where you hit him in the eye?

476
00:25:21,738 --> 00:25:25,074
I'll be over there.

477
00:25:25,142 --> 00:25:29,545
So, Dana,
you were amazing up there.

478
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:32,014
You think?
I'm just glad it's finally over.

479
00:25:32,082 --> 00:25:33,949
We've been practicing for weeks,

480
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:35,551
and still,
every time I go on,

481
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,886
I'm almost sure
I'm goanna throw up.

482
00:25:39,223 --> 00:25:40,689
I'm really glad you guys came.

483
00:25:40,757 --> 00:25:43,792
My dad was totally sure
none of you would show.

484
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,129
My dad's Axel Turner.

485
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:48,731
He's your dad?
{mouthing words}

486
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,101
Heh. Everybody says that,
and kind of exactly like that,

487
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:53,736
but trust me,
once you get to know him,

488
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:56,239
he's a really great guy.

489
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:59,142
Well, I-I guess I should go.

490
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:02,211
Here.
You don't wanna lose it.

491
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,647
You can keep it if you want.

492
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:07,916
What would I do with a bracelet?
Right.

493
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,820
For the record,
I'm glad you're okay.

494
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:13,389
You have really pretty eyes.

495
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:17,760
Ah. Sorry, that was weird.

496
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,395
I didn't mean to make you
uncomfortable.

497
00:26:19,463 --> 00:26:22,765
No, it's all good. People tell
me that all the time.

498
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,267
Um, probably because
they're right

499
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,435
in the middle of my face, so...
Uh-huh.

500
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,275
So... Heh. What--?

501
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:33,942
Um...

502
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,580
I'll see you around.
Okay.

503
00:26:39,883 --> 00:26:43,219
Yes, I wanna keep it, you have
pretty eyes too. Stupid.

504
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:49,058
I'm an idiot.
Ha.

505
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,394
Something we both
can agree on.

506
00:26:52,496 --> 00:26:55,097
Ow. Strong idiot.

507
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,168
I...

508
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:02,205
I don't want you
talking to that boy.

509
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,908
Don't worry, I don't think
it's goanna be a problem.

510
00:27:07,344 --> 00:27:09,478
Okay, come on.

511
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,649
Rockers, boats now.

512
00:27:15,985 --> 00:27:17,086
{scoffs}

513
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:18,521
Wow.

514
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:22,324
Now, this is a recording studio.

515
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:25,394
Hey.
Um...

516
00:27:25,462 --> 00:27:27,696
Hi.

517
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:29,331
Can I help you with something?

518
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,500
Do I look like I need help?

519
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,936
Heh. Do I know you?

520
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:36,805
That's funny. I'm Luke.

521
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:38,607
Luke Williams.

522
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:41,643
I was just on-stage,
like two minutes ago.

523
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:45,281
¶¶ I'm giving you the fire ¶¶

524
00:27:45,348 --> 00:27:47,616
{vocalizing}

525
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:52,121
Wow, impressive.

526
00:27:52,189 --> 00:27:54,190
I know, right?
It's kind of my thing.

527
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:56,092
So you thinking about
joining us over here?

528
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,261
Uh, no, I'm perfectly happy
where I am.

529
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:02,398
Well, you are Shane Gray's
girlfriend, so...

530
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:05,468
Wait, what does Shane--?
How do you even know that?

531
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:06,635
You have to know the players

532
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:08,036
if you wanna be in the game,
right?

533
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:10,439
No.
It's a tough business.

534
00:28:10,507 --> 00:28:12,308
It's summer camp.

535
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,376
To you, but to anybody
at Camp Star,

536
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:17,045
it's step one to a long
and illustrious career.

537
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,047
I don't have time
for second rate.

538
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:21,117
We're not second rate.

539
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:22,951
You don't have to get
all defensive.

540
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:24,186
It's none of my business,

541
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:25,621
you don't have to try
to convince me.

542
00:28:25,688 --> 00:28:27,723
I'm not trying
to do anything.

543
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,692
Good. You're at the perfect
place for you.

544
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,462
Look, just so we're clear,

545
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,731
Luke "I'm giving you the fire"
Williams,

546
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:38,066
or whatever your name is,

547
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:40,536
not one Camp Rocker,
not in a million years,

548
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:42,471
would ever even think
about coming over

549
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:46,475
to this narcissistic,
over-produced ego factory.

550
00:28:46,543 --> 00:28:49,645
Guess what? My mom said yes.
I get to make the switch.

551
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:52,748
That's great.
Welcome to the ego factory.

552
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:54,550
Thanks.

553
00:28:54,618 --> 00:28:56,352
Tess, how could you?

554
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:00,489
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I feel horrible, but...

555
00:29:00,557 --> 00:29:01,990
{laughing}

556
00:29:02,058 --> 00:29:03,526
Who am I kidding?
I am so excited,

557
00:29:03,593 --> 00:29:06,195
I can't even pretend
to be sympathetic.

558
00:29:06,263 --> 00:29:08,264
That was great
what you did up there.

559
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:11,400
¶¶ I'm giving you the fire ¶¶

560
00:29:11,468 --> 00:29:12,901
So impressive.

561
00:29:12,969 --> 00:29:14,270
I know, right?

562
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:16,305
Wow.

563
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:17,906
Good luck trying to find
a spotlight

564
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:19,441
big enough
for the both of you.

565
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:20,942
{scoffs}

566
00:29:23,813 --> 00:29:25,747
{birds chirping}

567
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:27,816
{soft theme playing}

568
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,820
{all chattering}

569
00:29:31,888 --> 00:29:34,156
No, you guys,
it's goanna be okay.

570
00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:36,892
I mean, Brown's a smart guy,
he can figure something out.

571
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:40,596
Thanks for that vote
of confidence, Mitchie.

572
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:43,632
Guess I don't have to get
everyone's attention.

573
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,235
So the good news is,

574
00:29:46,303 --> 00:29:49,137
and this really warms my heart,

575
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:51,240
we lost very few campers
last night.

576
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:54,310
{crowd cheers}

577
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,612
That's right.

578
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,716
But we did lose quite a few
of our remaining staff.

579
00:30:00,783 --> 00:30:02,184
Which means,

580
00:30:02,252 --> 00:30:05,654
and I can't believe
I have to say this,

581
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,424
Camp Rock is closed,
effective immediately.

582
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:10,092
GIRL: Wait, what?
BOY: No.

583
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,528
Y-You have to believe me,
I-I truly--

584
00:30:12,596 --> 00:30:14,896
I've got no other option.

585
00:30:14,964 --> 00:30:18,033
I'll start calling parents
as soon as we're done here,

586
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:20,068
which I guess is now.

587
00:30:20,136 --> 00:30:22,338
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:26,074
Brown, wait. Guys.

589
00:30:26,142 --> 00:30:28,677
Camp is over?
But we just got here.

590
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:29,878
It's not his fault.

591
00:30:29,946 --> 00:30:32,248
I mean, there's nothing
he can do about it.

592
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:34,182
GIRL:
Man, this is such a bummer.

593
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:37,152
But...

594
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,755
that doesn't mean there isn't
something we can do about it.

595
00:30:39,822 --> 00:30:41,089
Mitchie.

596
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:42,625
No, I'm serious.

597
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:45,927
This is our summer,
and we're not giving up.

598
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:48,530
We're not backing down.
GIRL: Right.

599
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,098
I don't know, Mitchie.

BROWN:
What's going on?

659
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:18,207
Well, you said you needed
some new counsellors, so...

660
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:20,042
I found you some.

661
00:34:23,613 --> 00:34:27,416
Then it looks like I should call
this staff meeting to order.

662
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:30,286
Yes.
Thank you.

663
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:31,653
BOY: Yes.
GIRL: All right.

664

GIRL:
Come on, Terry.

665
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:36,625
No, nada. Guys,
I already told you,

666
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:37,893
I'm not goanna be doing this.

667
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:41,330
Jason, you're looking
at this all wrong.

668
00:34:41,397 --> 00:34:43,866
This isn't punishment.

669
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,767
It's a reward.

670
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:47,169
Really?
Really.

671
00:34:47,237 --> 00:34:48,770
This just means
that everybody thinks

672
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,272
that you have
the leadership skills,

673
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,908
the maturity,
the intelligence--

674
00:34:52,976 --> 00:34:55,177
You think I'm intelligent?
No.

675
00:34:55,245 --> 00:34:57,279
--and the sheer guts
to take on this challenge.

676
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,849
Wow, you're good.
Thank you.

677
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:03,919
You're right.
This is an honour.

678
00:35:03,987 --> 00:35:07,122
Exactly. Now, get in there
and make us proud.

679
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:09,959
We'll be right here
if you need us.

Run.

Hi, everybody. I'm Jason.

684
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:23,105
I'm goanna be your counsellor.

685
00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:24,874
I'm a little new at this
so I thought you guys

686
00:35:24,941 --> 00:35:26,475
would go a little bit
easier on me.

687
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:27,743
What do you say?

688
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,045
I say, let's get him.

689
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:32,481
ALL: Yeah!
Guys, guys, hold on a minute.

690
00:35:36,586 --> 00:35:37,819
Now get him.

691
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:39,654
No, no, no.
No, no, no. No.

697

All good?
ALL: All good.

698
00:36:22,565 --> 00:36:24,333
Let's do this.

699
00:36:29,205 --> 00:36:31,373
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

700
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:33,943
Here we go, guys. All right.

701
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,313
Circle, down.
Head, meet, out.

702
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:43,319
Louder.

What about this, girls? Right?

706
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:54,163
Hi.

Enough.

00:37:15,785 --> 00:37:18,053
Do you wanna rock?

710
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:20,089
Well, you know what?
You don't deserve to rock.

711
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:22,724
Why should I show you the first
thing about being a rock star,

712
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:25,394
if you don't wanna show me
any respect?

713
00:37:28,098 --> 00:37:30,366
Well, okay, then.

714
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:32,034
Who wants to play the drums?

715
00:37:34,604 --> 00:37:36,305
Who wants to play the guitar?

716
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:39,475
Who wants to be a lead singer?

717
00:37:40,977 --> 00:37:42,911
Well, you are goanna
have to buy tighter pants

718
00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:44,779
and learn how to play
a tambourine.

719
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,716
I heard that.
JASON: Sorry.

720
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:50,352

It's true.

Nate?
Yeah.

724
00:38:01,131 --> 00:38:04,433
Shane. What's up, bro?

725
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:06,068
What are you doing?

726
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:09,071
Um, lifeguard duty.

727
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:11,407
Schedule's a mess,
but you can't be too careful.

728
00:38:12,642 --> 00:38:15,177
Just one last look.

729
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:20,582
All clear.

730
00:38:24,654 --> 00:38:27,956
So, what do I have to do to pull
you away from this clipboard?

731
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:30,692
Mitchie,
I just rolled 100 pounds

732
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,727
of raw hamburger all by myself.

733
00:38:32,795 --> 00:38:34,963
I told you, honey,
I needed help.

734
00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:36,498
No, no, no, that--
That's impossible.

735
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:37,899
I know for a fact
that I scheduled--

736
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:41,736
Absolutely nobody. I'm so sorry.
What's going on?

737
00:38:41,804 --> 00:38:44,506
This isn't working.
The kitchen is a disaster.

738
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:47,076
Yesterday, I ordered 50 pounds
of black beans

739
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:50,946
and they delivered
50 cases of beach balls instead.

740
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:54,483
Well, you gotta admit, Mom,

741
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:55,951
you don't have the best
handwriting.

742
00:38:56,018 --> 00:38:58,353
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, it's rock 'n' roll, right?

743
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,122
It's goanna be
a little chaotic.

744
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,790
I think you're doing great.
We'll just make

745
00:39:01,857 --> 00:39:04,025
some adjustments
to the schedule, yeah?

746
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:06,995
Perfect. Shane,
help Connie with the hamburgers.

747
00:39:07,063 --> 00:39:09,198
Actually, I've--
I've got this thing--

748
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:11,032
Oh, really?
Well, come on, pretty boy.

749
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:12,501
No, but--

750
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:14,703

{playing steady beat}

752
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:19,641
All right, that's it.
Now pick it up.

753
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:22,777
Bring it home.

754
00:39:26,048 --> 00:39:27,349
I knew you could do it.

755
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:29,218
All right, now it's, uh,
getting a little late,

756
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,052
so what do you say
we all go enjoy some free time?

757
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,387
ALL: Yeah.
BOY: All right.

758

{soft theme playing}

759
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,544
Hey, man.
Oh.

760
00:39:55,612 --> 00:39:57,579
What are you doing?

761
00:39:57,647 --> 00:39:59,581
Why does everybody
keep doing that?

762
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:03,084
Sorry, we're just doing our part
as activity directors.

763
00:40:04,187 --> 00:40:05,887
And what's the activity today?

764
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:07,256
Wakeboarding.

765
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:08,923
{laughing}

766
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:11,059
No!

767
00:40:11,127 --> 00:40:13,428
Oh!

768
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:17,499
{soft theme playing}

769
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:19,635
{grunts}

770
00:40:21,804 --> 00:40:24,072
Are you okay?

771
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,074
Yeah, I'm great.

772
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:27,709
{sighs}

773
00:40:27,777 --> 00:40:30,245
Uh, don't suppose
you came over here

774
00:40:30,313 --> 00:40:31,513
to see anyone
in particular.

775
00:40:31,581 --> 00:40:34,115
No,
just getting some exercise.

776
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:36,718
Do you play a lot of sports?

777
00:40:37,987 --> 00:40:40,689
Canoeing.
That's pretty much it.

778
00:40:40,756 --> 00:40:42,257
I'm really
not all that sporty either.

779
00:40:42,325 --> 00:40:44,959
I played soccer when I was
little, but who doesn't?

780
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:47,196
I don't know if it counts
as a sport,

781
00:40:47,263 --> 00:40:49,298
but I'd kind of love
to be a dancer.

782
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:51,600
It's like my nerdy secret,
"if I could be anything,

783
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:54,969
that's what I'd be" wish.
What would you be?

784
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:57,072
I don't know.
Never thought about it.

785
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:59,608
Probably because if you could
be anything, you'd be you.

786
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:01,176
{both chuckling}

787
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:05,414
Uh, do you wanna hear something
really stupid?

788
00:41:05,481 --> 00:41:06,781
I was goofing around,

789
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:11,386
and I accidentally sort of
wrote your name on my hand

790
00:41:11,454 --> 00:41:14,823
but used permanent ink
by mistake.

791
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,326
No one's ever written my name
on their hand before.

792
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:20,295
Really more my wrist.
Heh.

793
00:41:20,363 --> 00:41:22,431
Dana--
Yeah?

794
00:41:22,498 --> 00:41:23,832
AXEL:
Dana?

795
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,400
Oh, it's my dad.

796
00:41:25,468 --> 00:41:28,136
I'm so sorry, I'm not supposed
to be talking to you.

797
00:41:28,204 --> 00:41:30,071
Hurry. Go.

798
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:31,773
AXEL:
Dana?

799
00:41:33,509 --> 00:41:35,510
Dana.
Hey.

800
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:37,479
I saw this canoe.

801
00:41:37,547 --> 00:41:40,549
Ugh. Don't touch it,
it's one of theirs.

802
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:43,051
I'll have an attendant
fish it out.

803
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,954
What's that on your wrist?
Nothing.

804
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:50,359
You wanna know what I wanna be?

805
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:53,295
The kind of guy who can tell you
how he really feels.

806
00:41:53,363 --> 00:41:55,864
I hate canoes.

807
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,932
{upbeat theme playing}

808
00:42:01,404 --> 00:42:04,873
I'm still an idiot.
I still agree.

809
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,708
Dude,
you can't keep hitting me.

810
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:08,577
Thank you.
{footsteps approaching}

811
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:10,078
Oh!
{Mitchie giggling}

812
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:11,680
SHANE:
Ow.

813
00:42:11,748 --> 00:42:12,981
Thanks, Mitchie.

814
00:42:13,048 --> 00:42:15,284
I had absolutely
the best day ever.

815
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:17,085
Everything's finally
starting to work out.

816
00:42:17,153 --> 00:42:19,187
That's great.
It's all because of you.

817
00:42:19,255 --> 00:42:21,055
No, it's because of us.

818
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:22,891
Now that everybody else
has gotten your time,

819
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,526
I think I'm goanna demand
some of my own.

820
00:42:24,594 --> 00:42:27,396
It hasn't been that bad.

821
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:30,499
The whole reason I'm here,
the reason my brothers are here,

822
00:42:30,566 --> 00:42:33,001
is so I can
get to know you better.

823
00:42:33,068 --> 00:42:35,970
It's only been like two seconds.

824
00:42:36,038 --> 00:42:37,839
And that is
the sweetest thing

825
00:42:37,907 --> 00:42:39,741
that anybody has ever
said to me.

826
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:41,242
But...
But--

827
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:42,544
BARRON {over PA}:
Now a word from

828
00:42:42,612 --> 00:42:44,145
your friendly
neighbourhood announcer.

829
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:46,080
Will the counsellors
scheduled for the bonfire

830
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:47,683
please report to the mess hall.

831
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,252
But you gotta go.
But we gotta go.

832
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,390
Are you coming?

833
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:57,526
No, it's cool. I'll catch up.

834
00:42:57,593 --> 00:42:58,927
Shane.

835
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:01,095
Go, they need you.

836
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:03,565
Okay.

837
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,278
{guitar playing soft music}

838
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:20,615
Hey. I'm impressed.
Ehh.

839
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:22,918
You seem to be doing
much better with them.

840
00:43:22,985 --> 00:43:24,186
It took
a little bit of time,

841
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:26,421
but I think I finally gained
their respect.

842
00:43:27,824 --> 00:43:29,925
{whispering indistinctly}

843
00:43:29,992 --> 00:43:31,459
{laughing}

844
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:37,065
Who glued me to this log?

845
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:38,633
{all laughing}

846
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:40,235
{singsong}:
Log Butt, Log Butt.

847
00:43:40,302 --> 00:43:42,137
We're goanna call you Log Butt.

848
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:44,572
You know what's worse
than being called Log Butt?

849
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,942
Is being sat on by Log Butt.

850
00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:48,777
Oh! Ooh!

851
00:43:48,845 --> 00:43:51,579
BROWN:
Run. Run, he's got you.

852
00:43:51,647 --> 00:43:52,814
Come back here.

853
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,118
Fireflies.

854
00:43:56,185 --> 00:43:58,519
I'm goanna get this one.
Okay, catch them, everybody.

855
00:43:58,587 --> 00:44:00,455
Let's jump. Jump.

856
00:44:00,522 --> 00:44:02,457
{chuckling}

857
00:44:02,524 --> 00:44:06,594
{suspenseful theme playing}

858
00:44:06,662 --> 00:44:09,831
Looks like the Lord of the Flies
over there.

859
00:44:09,899 --> 00:44:13,135
There's no way they're goanna
make it through the summer.

860
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:18,774
I remember doing that.
It's fun.

861
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:21,109
Don't even think about it.

862
00:44:26,649 --> 00:44:28,516
{sighs}

863
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,789
It felt so great just standing
up in front of that class today.

864
00:44:33,856 --> 00:44:36,357
I feel like there's
nothing we can't do.

865
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:39,694
Pleats.
Still can't do pleats.

866
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:43,198
Wish we had that attitude
the other night at Camp Star.

867
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:45,333
Yeah, I so wanted
to show them up.

868
00:44:45,401 --> 00:44:47,836
That hardly counted. They'd been
planning that for weeks.

869
00:44:47,904 --> 00:44:49,570
Yeah, and now they're all
walking around

870
00:44:49,638 --> 00:44:50,939
thinking they're better than us.

871
00:44:51,007 --> 00:44:52,473
PEGGY:
So not true.

872
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:55,443
You know, I'd really like to see
them go up against us.

873
00:44:55,511 --> 00:44:56,678
BARRON:
Yeah.

874
00:44:56,745 --> 00:44:58,346
CAITLYN:
If we had time
to get it together,

875
00:44:58,414 --> 00:44:59,647
no way they'd stand a chance.

876
00:44:59,715 --> 00:45:01,183
Like in Final Jam.

877
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,018
There's just no way.

878
00:45:03,085 --> 00:45:06,822
Lot of big talk.
Wanna see if it's true?

879
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:12,194
{mellow theme playing}

880
00:45:14,897 --> 00:45:16,998
It's about time.

881
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:19,968
My private vocal lessons
started ten minutes ago.

882
00:45:20,036 --> 00:45:21,970
Oh, I'm sorry.

883
00:45:22,038 --> 00:45:26,607
I forgot that Axel thinks
you need the extra rehearsal.

884
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:29,311
ALL {chanting}:
Camp Rock.

885
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:32,714
Camp Rock.

886
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:36,484
Camp Rock.

887
00:45:37,887 --> 00:45:40,121
Camp Rock.

888
00:45:41,924 --> 00:45:43,091
Camp Rock.

889
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:48,730
Camp Rock.

890
00:45:48,797 --> 00:45:51,766
Camp Rock. Ooh.

891
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:55,670
Yeah, that's right.
We're here on your stage.

892
00:45:55,738 --> 00:45:57,405
See, you guys didn't really
give us a chance

893
00:45:57,473 --> 00:45:58,940
to answer back
the other night.

894
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:01,609
But guess what?
That's goanna change.

895
00:46:01,677 --> 00:46:04,812
Camp Rock vs. Camp Star,
the Final Jam.

896
00:46:04,881 --> 00:46:06,581
What do you guys think
about that?

897
00:46:08,084 --> 00:46:09,417
Drums.

898
00:46:09,485 --> 00:46:12,553
{playing steady beat}

899
00:46:12,621 --> 00:46:13,788
A little guitar, please.

900
00:46:13,856 --> 00:46:15,656
{playing upbeat music}

901
00:46:15,724 --> 00:46:17,025

¶¶ We just do what we do ¶¶

933
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:35,803
¶¶ Watch me break and pop
I'll pass it to you ¶¶

934
00:47:35,871 --> 00:47:37,138
¶¶ You wanna rock like us ¶¶

935
00:47:37,206 --> 00:47:40,308
¶¶ 'Cause we're never
Second place ¶¶

936
00:47:40,376 --> 00:47:41,509
¶¶ You ready, ready? ¶¶

937
00:47:41,577 --> 00:47:43,578
¶¶ Show me, show me
Show me, show me ¶¶

938
00:47:43,645 --> 00:47:44,779
¶¶ Show what you got ¶¶

939
00:47:44,847 --> 00:47:46,781
¶¶ Come on, come on
Come on, come on ¶¶

940
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:48,483
¶¶ Ready or not ¶¶

941
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:51,353
¶¶ La, la, la, la, la, la
Let me see how you bop ¶¶

942
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,655
¶¶ It's on, it's on, it's on ¶¶

943
00:47:54,723 --> 00:47:57,825
¶¶ Get crazy, crazy, crazy
Take it over the top ¶¶

944
00:47:57,893 --> 00:47:59,560
¶¶ 'Cause, because, because
When we rock ¶¶

945
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:01,162
¶¶ We let it rock ¶¶

946
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:02,697
¶¶ Rock it, rock it
Rock it, rock it ¶¶

947
00:48:02,764 --> 00:48:04,032
¶¶ Dance till we drop ¶¶

948
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,435
¶¶ It's on, it's on, it's on ¶¶

949
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:12,540
¶¶ Okay, now
Are you ready? ¶¶

950
00:48:12,608 --> 00:48:15,643
¶¶ One, two
One, two, three ¶¶

951
00:48:15,711 --> 00:48:19,214
¶¶ There, there, there, there
There is no competition ¶¶

952
00:48:19,281 --> 00:48:21,716
¶¶ That's why
We in the number-one position ¶¶

953
00:48:21,783 --> 00:48:25,353
¶¶ That crew can't hang with us
Man, we're too dangerous ¶¶

954
00:48:25,421 --> 00:48:28,356
¶¶ Ain't got the style
Or the stamina ¶¶

955
00:48:28,424 --> 00:48:31,526
¶¶ Just doing' my thing
Get hooked on my swing ¶¶

956
00:48:31,593 --> 00:48:33,128
¶¶ Rocking' the place
Dropping' the bass ¶¶

957
00:48:33,195 --> 00:48:35,763
¶¶ Making all the girls sing ¶¶

958
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:38,733
¶¶ Yeah, we make the bells ring ¶¶

959
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,436
¶¶ It's on, it's on ¶¶
¶¶ Drums ¶¶

960
00:48:43,939 --> 00:48:45,507
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶

961
00:48:45,574 --> 00:48:47,708
BOY: Come on.
GIRL: Yeah.

962
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:52,414
SANDER:
A little guitar, please.

963
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:54,249
One, two, three, four.

964
00:48:59,588 --> 00:49:00,588
Yeah.

965
00:49:06,529 --> 00:49:08,430
¶¶ Show me, show me

¶¶ La, la, la, la, la, la

970
00:49:16,038 --> 00:49:19,541
¶¶ It's on, it's on, it's on ¶¶
¶¶ Show me ¶¶

971
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:22,710
¶¶ Get crazy, crazy, crazy

972
00:49:22,778 --> 00:49:24,446
¶¶ 'Cause, because, because
When we rock ¶¶

973
00:49:24,513 --> 00:49:25,980
¶¶ We let it rock ¶¶

974
00:49:26,048 --> 00:49:27,615
¶¶ Rock it, rock it
Rock it, rock it ¶¶

975
00:49:27,683 --> 00:49:28,816
¶¶ Dance till we drop ¶¶

976

¶¶ It's on, it's on, it's on ¶¶

977
00:49:32,321 --> 00:49:33,988
¶¶ Show me, show me
Show me, show me ¶¶

978
00:49:34,056 --> 00:49:35,490
¶¶ Show what you got ¶¶

979
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:37,225
¶¶ Come on, come on
Come on, come on ¶¶

980
00:49:37,293 --> 00:49:38,693
¶¶ Ready or not ¶¶

982
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:45,066
¶¶ It's on, it's on, it's on ¶¶

983

¶¶ Get crazy, crazy, crazy
Take it over the top ¶¶

984
00:49:48,003 --> 00:49:49,737
¶¶ 'Cause, because, because
When we rock ¶¶

985
00:49:49,805 --> 00:49:51,739
¶¶ We let it rock ¶¶

986
00:49:51,807 --> 00:49:53,241
¶¶ Rock it, rock it
Rock it, rock it ¶¶

987
00:49:53,309 --> 00:49:54,409
¶¶ Dance till we drop ¶¶

988
00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:57,778
¶¶ It's on, it's on, it's on ¶¶

989
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:03,017
¶¶ It's on ¶¶
¶¶ It's on, it's on ¶¶

990
00:50:03,085 --> 00:50:05,520
¶¶ It's on ¶¶
¶¶ Two, one, two, three ¶¶

991
00:50:05,588 --> 00:50:08,022
¶¶ It's on ¶¶

992
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,225
{crowd cheering}

993
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:17,098
That is a fantastic idea.

994
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:20,335
Truly. I'm impressed.

995
00:50:20,402 --> 00:50:23,371
A little healthy competition
is exactly what we need.

996
00:50:23,439 --> 00:50:27,342
A champion always needs
a good sparring partner.

997
00:50:27,409 --> 00:50:28,676
We do?

998
00:50:28,744 --> 00:50:30,678
But you really think
that you can,

999
00:50:30,746 --> 00:50:34,349
uh, take my guys on
head-to-head?

1000
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:35,916
{scoffs}

1001
00:50:35,984 --> 00:50:38,186
Anytime, anyplace.
GIRL: Yup.

1002
00:50:38,254 --> 00:50:39,854
BOY: Yeah.
Can't wait.

1003
00:50:39,921 --> 00:50:42,056
Maybe use our amphitheatre.

1004
00:50:42,124 --> 00:50:43,458
Doesn't matter where.

1005
00:50:43,526 --> 00:50:45,860
We just know that Camp Rock
is goanna blow you guys away.

1006
00:50:45,927 --> 00:50:48,029
GIRL: That's right.
BOY: Straight up.

1007
00:50:48,096 --> 00:50:50,532
I'm sure an audience
would be a better judge of that.

1008
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:53,901
Bring it on. You can pack it
with anybody you want.

1009
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:56,404
{chuckles}

1010
00:50:56,472 --> 00:50:58,939
Well,
how about a worldwide audience?

1011
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:03,411
What if we put this little
competition on TV?

1012
00:51:03,479 --> 00:51:05,813
Have the public decide
who's really the best.

1013
00:51:05,881 --> 00:51:08,550
TV? We'd really get to be on TV?

1014
00:51:08,617 --> 00:51:11,085
Uh, I don't really know
about this.

1015
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:12,887
Not such a big talker now,
are you?

1016
00:51:12,954 --> 00:51:14,522
{Camp Star chuckles}

1017
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:17,692
But that would be so cool.
The whole world would see us.

1018
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:19,727
Uh...

1019
00:51:19,795 --> 00:51:22,530
SANDER:
Come on, Mitchie.
This could be huge.

1020
00:51:22,598 --> 00:51:24,965
BOY:
Yeah, let's do it.

1021
00:51:25,033 --> 00:51:26,501
You're on.

1022
00:51:26,569 --> 00:51:27,835
Whoo!
Yeah.

1023
00:51:27,903 --> 00:51:30,438
{all cheering}

1024
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,848
I wrote this song
a long time ago

1025
00:51:39,915 --> 00:51:41,015
and I kind of
forgot about it,

1026
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:43,117
but I think it could work.

1027
00:51:44,954 --> 00:51:46,387
It's a duet.

1028
00:51:46,455 --> 00:51:48,389
Now. But I think
I could rewrite it

1029
00:51:48,457 --> 00:51:49,724
and make a part for everybody.

1030
00:51:49,791 --> 00:51:52,426
Or we can rewrite it.

1031
00:51:52,494 --> 00:51:55,796
"I lay pretty, pretty flowers
on your grave."

1032
00:51:56,932 --> 00:51:58,632
Am I the only one who thinks
this song is, like,

1033
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,801
totally depressing?
{clears throat}

1034
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:03,004
You're on the wrong page.

1035
00:52:03,072 --> 00:52:06,107
Yeah, that song
was for my hamster's funeral.

1036
00:52:06,175 --> 00:52:07,909
Oh, this is perfect.

1037
00:52:07,977 --> 00:52:10,111
The staging
could be pretty cool.

1038
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:12,513
Yeah, it looks like there's some
great spots for dancing.

1039
00:52:12,581 --> 00:52:14,115
And it's got a great groove.

1040
00:52:14,183 --> 00:52:15,884
Well, before we get ahead
of ourselves, guys,

1041
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:17,218
I got a couple conditions.

1042
00:52:17,286 --> 00:52:18,719
You've got conditions?

1043
00:52:18,787 --> 00:52:21,622
Yes. Well, a condition.

1044
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:24,259
There has to be a spot
for my junior rockers.

1045
00:52:24,326 --> 00:52:28,029
Of course. That's what
this is all about.

1046
00:52:28,097 --> 00:52:29,898
So, what do you guys think?

1047
00:52:29,965 --> 00:52:31,933
ALL:
I'm in. Let's do it.

1048
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:34,735
I think somebody should talk
to Uncle Brown.

1049
00:52:34,803 --> 00:52:37,638
Why? I already know
what he's goanna say.

1050
00:52:37,706 --> 00:52:40,541
How could she do that?
I told them.

1051
00:52:40,609 --> 00:52:45,113
I told Mitchie Axel Turner
cannot be trusted.

1052
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,815
I don't know why
you're getting so upset.

1053
00:52:47,883 --> 00:52:51,085
At the very least, Camp Rock
could get some great exposure.

1054
00:52:51,153 --> 00:52:53,321
He took advantage
is what he did.

1055
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:55,856
He saw an opportunity
and went for it.

1056
00:52:55,925 --> 00:53:00,261
An opportunity to destroy me
once and for all.

1057
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:02,196
And I thought Mitchie
could be dramatic.

1058
00:53:02,264 --> 00:53:04,632
Okay, then, just call him
and say no.

1059
00:53:04,699 --> 00:53:06,968
It's not that big a deal.

1060
00:53:07,036 --> 00:53:08,769
Oh, we're well past
big deal.

1061
00:53:08,837 --> 00:53:12,006
Look. "Camp Wars." Catchy.

1062
00:53:12,074 --> 00:53:14,508
Yeah, I especially
like the tagline,

1063
00:53:14,576 --> 00:53:16,844
"Only one will survive."

1064
00:53:16,912 --> 00:53:20,281
Millions of viewers will be
watching. That's good, right?

1065
00:53:20,349 --> 00:53:23,284
After this,
we are done.

1066
00:53:23,352 --> 00:53:26,354
And not just for the summer,
for good.

1067
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:31,792
Oh, come on. Brown.

1068
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,362
Give them a chance.

1069
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:37,098
BROWN:
Look, nobody believes
in my rockers more than I do,

1070
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:40,201
but we are goanna look like
a joke next to Camp Star.

1071
00:53:40,269 --> 00:53:44,538
We don't have the resources,
the infrastructure, the money.

1072
00:53:44,606 --> 00:53:46,941
Talent, passion, commitment,
yeah, we've got that.

1073
00:53:47,009 --> 00:53:48,476
It's not goanna matter.

1074
00:53:48,543 --> 00:53:50,345
It always matters.

1075
00:53:50,412 --> 00:53:51,912
And when people watch,

1076
00:53:51,981 --> 00:53:54,148
where do you think they're goanna
send their kids to camp?

1077
00:53:56,418 --> 00:53:58,152
CONNIE:
She didn't do it on purpose.

1078
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,753
BROWN:
I know.

1079
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:04,058
I just wish she wouldn't have
fallen into the trap.

1080
00:54:06,728 --> 00:54:09,430
{footsteps retreating}

1081
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:19,374
{upbeat theme playing}

1082
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:21,209
SANDER {over PA}:
Good morning, Camp Rock.

1083
00:54:21,276 --> 00:54:23,244
A message from Mitchie Torres:

1084
00:54:23,312 --> 00:54:26,347
All rockers, please report
to the main stage immediately.

1085
00:54:26,415 --> 00:54:29,117
Yeah, that means you.
Get moving.

1086
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,389
All right, rockers. There are
new schedules out on the board.

1087
00:54:34,456 --> 00:54:35,589
From this moment on,

1088
00:54:35,657 --> 00:54:38,026
everything is about winning
the competition.

1089
00:54:38,093 --> 00:54:40,361
Everything. We have to be
completely focused.

1090
00:54:40,429 --> 00:54:42,296
What about swimming
and waterskiing and--?

1091
00:54:42,364 --> 00:54:44,032
Focus. Sorry.
{feedback whining}

1092
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:46,267
Oh, sorry again.

1093
00:54:46,335 --> 00:54:49,237
Seriously, you guys,
if we wanna save this camp,

1094
00:54:49,304 --> 00:54:51,539
we have to put
all of our energies into this

1095
00:54:51,606 --> 00:54:55,009
and make it the best performance
that any of us have ever put on.

1096
00:54:55,077 --> 00:54:56,310
I mean, we may have
our doubters,

1097
00:54:56,378 --> 00:54:57,912
but we have come way too far

1098
00:54:57,979 --> 00:54:59,647
just to back down. Agreed?

1099
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:01,049
ALL:
Agreed.

1100
00:55:01,116 --> 00:55:03,117
All right.
Now, let's go get to work.

1101
00:55:05,054 --> 00:55:07,121
Now.
{feedback whines}

1102
00:55:07,189 --> 00:55:09,257
{all chattering}

1103
00:55:16,131 --> 00:55:17,598
I don't know what to do
about this set,

1104
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:18,899
but it's just gotta be big.

1105
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:20,535
Think of the biggest thing
you can imagine

1106
00:55:20,602 --> 00:55:21,635
and then make it bigger.

1107
00:55:21,703 --> 00:55:22,703
All right.
Thanks.

1108
00:55:24,573 --> 00:55:27,075
Mitchie, we're moving
in the wrong direction.

1109
00:55:27,142 --> 00:55:29,444
There's even less time on this
than the last one.

1110
00:55:29,511 --> 00:55:32,146
Um, I've got a few minutes now.
That's not what I mean.

1111
00:55:32,214 --> 00:55:33,514
Mitchie,
can you look at this?

1112
00:55:33,582 --> 00:55:36,150
I want us to coordinate,
but not be all matchy-matchy.

1113
00:55:36,218 --> 00:55:37,785
Mitchie-- Hi, Shane.
Hi.

1114
00:55:37,852 --> 00:55:39,187
CAITLYN:
I know you're rewriting,

1115
00:55:39,254 --> 00:55:42,022
but we've gotta make some
decisions about the music.

1116
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:43,757
Mitchie, can I talk to you?

1117
00:55:43,825 --> 00:55:45,759
Do you know who's doing
the vocal arrangements?

1118
00:55:45,827 --> 00:55:47,728
If it's me, fine,
but somebody's gotta tell me.

1119
00:55:47,796 --> 00:55:49,597
{sighs}

1120
00:55:49,664 --> 00:55:51,031
I'm sorry.

1121
00:55:55,737 --> 00:55:58,473
{tense theme playing}

1122
00:56:05,947 --> 00:56:07,748
{piano playing in distance}

1123
00:56:07,816 --> 00:56:09,984
I don't even know
why I'm here.

1124
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:12,653
Take my advice
and never get a girlfriend.

1125
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:18,226
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

1126
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:20,027
{playing soft music}

1127
00:56:22,631 --> 00:56:25,766
{tender theme playing}

1128
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:30,171
{laughing}

1129
00:56:32,641 --> 00:56:33,741
Hey, what are you guys doing?

1130
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:35,510
I thought you were
goanna be rehearsing.

1131
00:56:35,577 --> 00:56:39,213
Whoa, calm down. We've been
rehearsing for over five hours.

1132
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:40,714
We're just taking
a little break.

1133
00:56:40,782 --> 00:56:42,116
Really?
Because I was watching,

1134
00:56:42,184 --> 00:56:45,586
and it looks like we're goanna
need a lot more work.

1135
00:56:45,654 --> 00:56:46,920
{both laughing}

1136
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,324
You guys done already?
No.

1137
00:56:50,392 --> 00:56:51,692
He was telling me
about his sister.

1138
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,594
It's hilarious.
You have to tell her.

1139
00:56:53,662 --> 00:56:55,095
Oh, is it the one
about the group of kids

1140
00:56:55,164 --> 00:56:56,597
that didn't take
their jobs seriously

1141
00:56:56,665 --> 00:56:58,032
and then the camp shut down?

1142
00:56:58,099 --> 00:56:59,867
Yeah, I think I've heard it.

1143
00:56:59,934 --> 00:57:01,669
Hey, Mitchie. You gotta check
out this bit

1144
00:57:01,736 --> 00:57:02,870
me and the J.R.'s worked out.

1145
00:57:02,937 --> 00:57:04,705
It's a real spotlight moment.

1146
00:57:04,773 --> 00:57:06,374
That's great.
I'm sure whatever it is,

1147
00:57:06,441 --> 00:57:08,643
it's just goanna have to be
more of a background moment.

1148
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,746
Sander, what's going on?

1149
00:57:12,814 --> 00:57:14,682
You guys haven't made
any progress

1150
00:57:14,749 --> 00:57:16,016
since I left like
half an hour ago.

1151
00:57:16,084 --> 00:57:18,619
You guys have
to get this thing built.

1152
00:57:18,687 --> 00:57:20,688
You guys have to work
with me.

1153
00:57:20,755 --> 00:57:23,924
If I wanted to go to Camp Star
I would have signed up.

1154
00:57:23,992 --> 00:57:25,660
Okay, that's not fair.

1155
00:57:25,727 --> 00:57:27,127
I'm just trying
to get stuff done,

1156
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:28,296
but if you guys don't care--

1157
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:29,997
Mitchie.

1158
00:57:30,065 --> 00:57:32,567
We all care,
but you gotta lighten up.

1159
00:57:32,634 --> 00:57:36,003
Really?
And what will that get us?

1160
00:57:39,441 --> 00:57:41,542
All right, okay.
Let's do it again.

1161
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:45,179
That girl is taking the F-U-N
out of summer.

1162
00:57:45,247 --> 00:57:47,081
There is no F-U-N
in summer.

1163
00:57:47,148 --> 00:57:48,249
Exactly.

1164
00:57:48,317 --> 00:57:50,218
Seriously, I love her,

1165
00:57:50,285 --> 00:57:52,019
but I'm goanna kill her.

1166
00:57:56,725 --> 00:58:00,428
Okay, I think you know
what you've gotta do.

1167
00:58:00,495 --> 00:58:03,130
I'm on it.

1168
00:58:03,198 --> 00:58:05,633
{all shouting}

1169
00:58:05,701 --> 00:58:08,569
Guys, guys, calm down.

1170
00:58:08,637 --> 00:58:11,138
She didn't say no,
she said she'd think about it.

1171
00:58:13,709 --> 00:58:17,411
All work and no spray
makes a very unhappy rocker.

1172
00:58:17,479 --> 00:58:20,348
So I got a proposition
for you guys.

1173
00:58:20,415 --> 00:58:21,716
You think you're up for it?

1174
00:58:23,752 --> 00:58:26,821
Okay, we have a ton of stuff
to go over.

1175
00:58:26,888 --> 00:58:28,956
Where is everybody?

1176
00:58:29,024 --> 00:58:30,190
{sighs}

1177
00:58:30,258 --> 00:58:32,292
Seriously, people have got
to start being on time.

1178
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,095
{kids shouting}

1179
00:58:34,162 --> 00:58:35,863
Attack!

1180
00:58:35,931 --> 00:58:37,932
{rock music playing}

1181
00:59:05,193 --> 00:59:08,663
Oh, this was not
on the schedule.

1182
00:59:11,466 --> 00:59:15,770
Are you kidding? This is what
summer camp is all about.

1183
00:59:15,837 --> 00:59:18,205
Counterattack!

1184
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:22,409
{laughs}

1185
00:59:27,115 --> 00:59:28,049
Come on!

1186
00:59:28,116 --> 00:59:29,850
{all laughing and shouting}

1187
00:59:32,988 --> 00:59:34,155
Come on, then.

1188
00:59:37,392 --> 00:59:39,026
BOY 1: I know.
GIRL: It's so high.

1189
00:59:39,094 --> 00:59:41,528
BOY 2: Look at that.
BOY 3: That's a lot of fire.

1190
00:59:41,596 --> 00:59:43,564
So fun today.
Today was so awesome.

1191
00:59:43,631 --> 00:59:46,133
Yeah.
Has anybody seen Mitchie?

1192
00:59:46,201 --> 00:59:47,735
Um, I don't know.

1193
00:59:47,803 --> 00:59:49,036
She missed dinner.

1194
00:59:50,538 --> 00:59:52,239
Okay, thanks.

1195
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:54,175
Look at our fire.

1196
00:59:54,242 --> 00:59:55,275
{laughs}

1197
00:59:55,343 --> 00:59:56,844
{door opens}

1198
00:59:57,913 --> 00:59:59,413
{door closes}

1199
01:00:02,617 --> 01:00:04,685
Your sheet music's soggy.

1200
01:00:04,753 --> 01:00:06,921
Just pouring myself
into my music.

1201
01:00:06,988 --> 01:00:07,988
{chuckles}

1202
01:00:08,056 --> 01:00:10,324
That was bad.
Yeah, I know.

1203
01:00:10,391 --> 01:00:12,093
Um...

1204
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,728
Are you here to help?

1205
01:00:13,795 --> 01:00:15,462
I can't.

1206
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,931
Why?

1207
01:00:16,998 --> 01:00:20,467
Because you and I are going
on a moonlight picnic.

1208
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:22,569
Now?
Right now.

1209
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:24,571
How could you--

1210
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:26,207
Because I'm that nice
of a guy.

1211
01:00:26,274 --> 01:00:28,142
--think that I would just
go running off?

1212
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:29,409
Are you saying no?

1213
01:00:29,477 --> 01:00:31,979
Do you not understand everything
that needs to get done?

1214
01:00:32,047 --> 01:00:34,048
How could I not?
You remind me every two seconds.

1215
01:00:34,116 --> 01:00:36,583
And the water-balloon fight.
I mean, what were you thinking?

1216
01:00:36,651 --> 01:00:39,053
I was thinking, "Wouldn't it be
nice to have a little fun?"

1217
01:00:39,121 --> 01:00:40,587
So you're saying I'm not fun?

1218
01:00:40,655 --> 01:00:42,857
Why do I even keep trying?

1219
01:00:42,924 --> 01:00:44,391
The whole reason I came
was because--

1220
01:00:44,459 --> 01:00:46,260
I know. It was to get
to know me better.

1221
01:00:46,327 --> 01:00:47,494
Well, guess what.
This is me

1222
01:00:47,562 --> 01:00:49,663
trying to save something
that I care about.

1223
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:51,365
So am I.
Really?

1224
01:00:51,432 --> 01:00:52,733
And how's that working out
for you?

1225
01:00:52,801 --> 01:00:54,835
Not so great.

1226
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,540
Shane.

1227
01:01:03,178 --> 01:01:04,678
You forgot your flashlight.

1228
01:01:27,735 --> 01:01:29,436
{playing soft music}

1229
01:01:38,446 --> 01:01:42,416
¶¶ It's like he doesn't hear
A word I say ¶¶

1230
01:01:42,483 --> 01:01:46,753
¶¶ His mind is somewhere
Far away ¶¶

1231
01:01:46,822 --> 01:01:49,556
¶¶ And I don't know
How to get there ¶¶

1232
01:01:49,624 --> 01:01:52,759
¶¶ All he wants is to chill out ¶¶
¶¶ She's way too serious ¶¶

1233
01:01:52,828 --> 01:01:54,361
¶¶ He makes me wanna pull
All my hair out ¶¶

1234
01:01:54,429 --> 01:01:57,331
¶¶ She's always in a rush
And interrupting ¶¶

1235
01:01:57,398 --> 01:02:00,935
¶¶ Like he doesn't even care ¶¶

You were right.
It shouldn't be all up to you.

01:05:47,028 --> 01:05:48,061
And we do need
to step it up.

Shane got everybody up
before dawn.

He can be pretty persuasive
when he wants to be.

Morning. Sleep well?

Well, it's easy for you guys,

1314

01:07:24,525 --> 01:07:26,860
¶¶ But that don't mean

Hi, Nate.

Oh, I-- I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

1371
01:10:09,924 --> 01:10:11,258
Hi, Dana.

1372
01:10:12,393 --> 01:10:13,326
What are you doing here?

1373
01:10:13,394 --> 01:10:14,394
What do you think?

1374
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:16,029
You came to see me?

1375
01:10:16,097 --> 01:10:17,730
Good guess.

1376
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,201
Well, here I am.

1377
01:10:22,837 --> 01:10:23,837
{laughs}

1378
01:10:23,905 --> 01:10:25,872
That's it?

1379
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:27,774
I came all the way over here
in a canoe

1380
01:10:27,842 --> 01:10:29,242
risking my father's wrath,

1381
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:33,780
and that's all
you have to say to me?

1382
01:10:33,848 --> 01:10:36,049
I don't know what else
I'm supposed to say.

1383
01:10:36,117 --> 01:10:38,785
There's nothing
you're supposed to say.

1384
01:10:38,853 --> 01:10:41,321
Every day I see you looking
and waving and I'm all,

1385
01:10:41,388 --> 01:10:43,589
"That's so sweet.
I so like him."

1386
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:46,326
You do? Really, that's--
That's what you say?

1387
01:10:46,393 --> 01:10:48,661
But then--
"But then"?

1388
01:10:48,729 --> 01:10:50,763
Ah. That's never good.

1389
01:10:50,832 --> 01:10:52,565
How do I really know

1390
01:10:52,633 --> 01:10:54,100
if I don't know anything
about you?

1391
01:10:55,937 --> 01:10:57,570
I guess I just thought
you were different.

1392
01:10:57,638 --> 01:10:58,705
I am different.

1393
01:10:58,772 --> 01:11:00,707
No, you're not.

1394
01:11:00,774 --> 01:11:03,877
You're exactly like every other
teenage boy in the world.

1395
01:11:03,945 --> 01:11:06,579
Have you ever told me anything
about yourself?

1396
01:11:06,647 --> 01:11:08,581
You know, other than
you like canoeing.

1397
01:11:08,649 --> 01:11:12,452
Well, I don't really
like canoeing.

1398
01:11:13,855 --> 01:11:15,255
Oh. Oh, good.

1399
01:11:15,323 --> 01:11:18,558
So I really know nothing
about you.

1400
01:11:20,828 --> 01:11:23,063
I still don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

1401
01:11:26,734 --> 01:11:29,102
I think you just did.

¶¶ Instead I'm all
Out of tune ¶¶

1413
01:11:58,065 --> 01:11:59,665
Special order.

1414
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:02,369
¶¶ But what you don't know ¶¶

All along ¶¶

01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:13,506
I take back what I said
about girlfriends.

1435
01:13:13,574 --> 01:13:16,276
It's all good, because at this
rate, I'll never have one.

1436
01:13:16,344 --> 01:13:17,510
What do you mean?

1437
01:13:17,578 --> 01:13:19,812
Well, there's this girl.

1438
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,681
I kind of figured.

1439
01:13:21,748 --> 01:13:24,917
I really like her,
but I'm having a hard time

1440
01:13:24,986 --> 01:13:26,386
telling her
how I really feel.

1441
01:13:26,454 --> 01:13:29,356
You're a rock star, dude.
Use it.

1442
01:13:29,423 --> 01:13:31,291
I don't think she cares.

1443
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:34,427
She just wants to know all this
stupid, random stuff about me.

1444
01:13:34,495 --> 01:13:36,496
It's not random stuff.

1445
01:13:36,563 --> 01:13:37,964
She just wants to know
you care enough

1446
01:13:38,032 --> 01:13:39,932
to let her know
who you are.

1447
01:13:40,001 --> 01:13:42,768
Well, I care.

1448
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:44,737
But I just don't know
how to say it.

1449
01:13:44,805 --> 01:13:48,774
Well, if you can't say it,
you can sing it.

Every single time
I'm trying to sing my high note,

1453
01:14:11,798 --> 01:14:13,666
I keep getting lost
behind her big head.

1454
01:14:13,734 --> 01:14:14,734
Oh, no, you didn't.

1455
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:16,102
You couldn't stand
the spotlight.

1456
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:17,203
TESS:
Now that you mention,

1457
01:14:17,271 --> 01:14:18,338
I'm not trying to do anything.

1458

AXEL:
Enough!

1459
01:14:19,673 --> 01:14:22,142
We'll run it again
in three minutes.

1460
01:14:22,209 --> 01:14:25,711
And this time, remember,
it's not amateur hour.

1461
01:14:25,779 --> 01:14:27,847
He means you.

1462
01:14:32,453 --> 01:14:33,586
Hi, Dana.
Oh!

1463
01:14:33,654 --> 01:14:36,056
Kind of makes you jump,
doesn't it?

1464
01:14:37,158 --> 01:14:38,124
You shouldn't be here.

1465
01:14:38,192 --> 01:14:40,160
I know,
but I couldn't wait.

1466
01:14:40,227 --> 01:14:42,195
Wait for what?

1467
01:14:44,131 --> 01:14:47,467
It's a list of things
that nobody knows about me.

1468
01:14:49,002 --> 01:14:50,336
Two minutes.

1469
01:14:50,404 --> 01:14:52,172
I really gotta go.
I'm sorry.

1470
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,340
Wait. We still have
two minutes.

1471
01:14:55,543 --> 01:14:56,543
Okay.

Sorry. It's my fault.

1541
01:18:05,366 --> 01:18:08,601
Why don't you save the theatrics
for the competition?

1542
01:18:08,669 --> 01:18:10,503
It's okay.

1543
01:18:10,571 --> 01:18:12,204
Go.

1544
01:18:13,374 --> 01:18:14,407
Thank you.

1545
01:18:15,743 --> 01:18:17,510

1548
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:35,861
was a bloody footprint.

Lame.
Not even scary.

1551
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,502
Yeah, totally
not scary at all.

1552
01:18:42,569 --> 01:18:44,337
Okay, time for bed.
Turn on the lights.

1553
01:18:44,404 --> 01:18:45,571
But you called
"lights out."

1554
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:47,039

Well?

Good.

1629
01:22:28,462 --> 01:22:30,529
Maybe great.

1630
01:22:30,597 --> 01:22:33,232
But this competition
isn't about maybe.

1631
01:22:33,299 --> 01:22:36,068
Okay, fine. But can you tell
her to stay out of my light?

1632
01:22:36,135 --> 01:22:38,070
Well, maybe if you would
stay out of my way,

1633
01:22:38,137 --> 01:22:39,972
it wouldn't
be a problem.

This has to be perfect.

what hit them.

{all chattering}

1640
01:22:58,275 --> 01:23:00,843
And the stage was, like,
super-cool.

1641
01:23:00,911 --> 01:23:02,311
It's huge.

1642
01:23:02,379 --> 01:23:04,580
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold up.

1643
01:23:04,648 --> 01:23:06,515
Wait, so it's just
Tess and Luke singing?

1644
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:08,651
Yeah, pretty much. Everybody
else is doing something,

1645
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,319
but they're definitely
the stars.

1646
01:23:10,387 --> 01:23:12,288
But this makes it
so much easier.

1647
01:23:12,355 --> 01:23:14,157
We could totally win
this thing.

1648
01:23:14,224 --> 01:23:15,357
How so?

1649
01:23:15,425 --> 01:23:17,359
Oh, come on.
Even I get it.

1650
01:23:17,427 --> 01:23:18,861
I don't care
what they're singing,

1651
01:23:18,929 --> 01:23:21,363
but you and Shane are better
than Tess and Luke any day.

1652
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:24,233
But Shane and I
aren't even singing together.

1653
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:26,635
But you originally
wrote the song as a duet.

1654
01:23:26,704 --> 01:23:28,004
I know, but I--

1655
01:23:28,072 --> 01:23:29,972
You're our two
strongest singers.

1656
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,075
And we know
you have chemistry.

1657
01:23:33,643 --> 01:23:35,444
It's just,
everybody worked so hard.

1658
01:23:35,512 --> 01:23:36,913
Yeah, to help save the camp.

1659
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:39,515
If the two of you singing alone
on-stage can help us win,

1660
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:40,883
you have to do it.

1661
01:23:40,951 --> 01:23:42,151
Then it's settled.

1662
01:23:42,219 --> 01:23:43,419
ALL:
Yeah!

1663
01:23:47,925 --> 01:23:50,259
{melancholy theme playing}

1664
01:24:00,204 --> 01:24:02,238
Remember when Audrey
jumped on Jason?

1665
01:24:02,305 --> 01:24:04,673
Man, the shaving cream
was the best one.

1666
01:24:08,511 --> 01:24:11,848
You guys okay
with just Shane and I singing?

1667
01:24:11,915 --> 01:24:13,182
Yeah, we're good.

1668
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:15,718
I was just looking forward
to doing some of my new moves.

1669
01:24:15,786 --> 01:24:17,186
But it's okay,

1670
01:24:17,254 --> 01:24:19,388
if it means we get to come back
here next summer.

1671
01:24:19,456 --> 01:24:21,157
You guys had a good summer?

1672
01:24:21,225 --> 01:24:22,625
Only the best summer ever.

1673
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:28,664
{Mitchie laughing}

1674
01:24:38,142 --> 01:24:40,542
You guys just gave me
the best idea ever.

01:24:41,779 --> 01:24:43,112

01:25:11,175 --> 01:25:14,944
What's your favourite camp,
Camp Star or Camp Rock?

1687
01:25:15,012 --> 01:25:16,378
And we're out.

1688
01:25:16,446 --> 01:25:17,379
Okay.

1689
01:25:17,447 --> 01:25:19,182
Georgina.

1690
01:25:20,684 --> 01:25:22,418
It's great to see you.

1691
01:25:22,485 --> 01:25:23,986
As always, Axel.

1692
01:25:24,054 --> 01:25:25,221
{laughs}

1693
01:25:25,289 --> 01:25:26,823
Well, I'm goanna go backstage

1694
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:28,424
and do some stand-ups
before the concert.

1695
01:25:28,491 --> 01:25:30,726
Good luck.
Thank you.

1696
01:25:30,794 --> 01:25:33,196
All right, let's go get
some interviews backstage

1697
01:25:33,263 --> 01:25:34,630
with some of the campers.

1698
01:25:34,698 --> 01:25:36,232
You, uh-- You know her?

1699
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:37,800
No, I know everyone.

1700
01:25:37,868 --> 01:25:39,235
But don't worry,

1701
01:25:39,303 --> 01:25:41,437
she doesn't have anything
to do with the voting.

1702
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,872
Oh.

1703
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:44,606
So I probably
shouldn't hold out hope

1704
01:25:44,674 --> 01:25:47,210
for us ever being friends again?

1705
01:25:48,212 --> 01:25:49,812
Probably not.

1706
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,247
Though you never know.

1707
01:25:51,315 --> 01:25:54,183
Next year I might hire you
to run my summer camp.

1708
01:25:54,251 --> 01:25:56,085
{chuckles}

1709
01:25:56,153 --> 01:25:57,954
Thanks.

1710
01:25:58,021 --> 01:25:59,521
But I'm already booked.

1711
01:26:04,928 --> 01:26:06,329
Good luck.
{scoffs}

1712
01:26:06,396 --> 01:26:08,797
I'll be lucky if you don't
forget your words this time.

1713
01:26:08,866 --> 01:26:12,601
By "good luck" I mean
"I hope you fall off the stage."

1714
01:26:12,669 --> 01:26:14,337
{scoffs}

1715
01:26:20,878 --> 01:26:22,728
{all cheering and applauding}

1716
01:26:22,795 --> 01:26:26,398
As the sun goes down,
the volume goes up.

1717
01:26:26,466 --> 01:26:29,335
Welcome back to the ultimate
summer-camp showdown,

1718
01:26:29,402 --> 01:26:33,372
where you decide the winner.

1719
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:39,811
Now, first up is Camp Star.

1720
01:26:39,879 --> 01:26:42,080
Now, Camp Star
was founded only this year

1721
01:26:42,149 --> 01:26:44,816
by superstar producer
and founder of Star Records,

1722
01:26:44,884 --> 01:26:46,218
Axel Turner...

1723
01:26:46,286 --> 01:26:48,487
{audience cheering}

1724
01:26:50,157 --> 01:26:52,891
...who's been producing
for over 20 years.

1725
01:26:52,959 --> 01:26:55,060
Now, I know if I was goanna
study music,

1726
01:26:55,128 --> 01:26:56,895
this is the place
I'd wanna be.

1727
01:26:56,963 --> 01:26:59,031
Why is she saying that?

1728
01:26:59,098 --> 01:27:02,901
It's her job. She's supposed
to say nice things.

1729
01:27:02,969 --> 01:27:06,272
If she doesn't stop talking,
I think I'm goanna throw up.

1730
01:27:06,339 --> 01:27:07,606
Too late.

1731
01:27:09,209 --> 01:27:11,243
Well, there's no
turning back now,

1732
01:27:11,311 --> 01:27:13,812
because the party
has already started.

1733
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,847
Camp Star, everybody.

1734
01:27:15,915 --> 01:27:17,416
{all cheering and applauding}

1735
01:27:19,586 --> 01:27:21,987
{upbeat hip-hop music playing}

1736
01:27:22,055 --> 01:27:24,423
WOMAN:

{all cheering and applauding}

1785
01:29:45,264 --> 01:29:47,098
GEORGINA:
Camp Star, everyone.

1786
01:29:50,437 --> 01:29:54,673
Oh! Remember, if you loved them
as much as I did,

1787
01:29:54,741 --> 01:29:56,141
call or text in now.

1788
01:29:56,209 --> 01:29:57,643
But don't go anywhere,

1789
01:29:57,711 --> 01:30:01,012
because in a moment
we're goanna hear from Camp Rock.

1790
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:05,684
What happened to you?

1791
01:30:05,751 --> 01:30:09,388
When I get nervous
I sparkle things.

1792
01:30:09,456 --> 01:30:11,223
{laughs}
TESS: Would you stop and listen?

1793
01:30:11,291 --> 01:30:12,524
LUKE:
You sounded good too.

1794
01:30:12,592 --> 01:30:15,760
Hey, you guys
were incredible.

1795
01:30:15,828 --> 01:30:17,196
I know, right?

1796
01:30:17,263 --> 01:30:21,433
Only one thing would've
made it better: doing it solo.

1797
01:30:21,501 --> 01:30:23,102
I totally agree.

1798
01:30:27,073 --> 01:30:28,640
It's this bantery thing
that we--

1799
01:30:31,111 --> 01:30:32,111
Thanks.

1800
01:30:33,713 --> 01:30:35,547
Good luck.

1801
01:30:40,053 --> 01:30:42,087
Quite a performance, eh?

1802
01:30:44,391 --> 01:30:45,590
No denying it.

1803
01:30:45,658 --> 01:30:48,460
But don't count
those votes just yet, love.

1804
01:30:48,528 --> 01:30:50,695
I think you're goanna
be very impressed.

1805
01:30:50,763 --> 01:30:51,863
I don't need
to be impressed.

1806
01:30:51,931 --> 01:30:53,698
It'd be a miracle
if Axel didn't win.

1807
01:30:53,766 --> 01:30:55,100
Excuse me?

1808
01:30:55,168 --> 01:30:57,136
Do you know how much money
he spent marketing this?

1809
01:30:57,203 --> 01:30:59,405
He's paying to text and tweet
every cell phone user

1810
01:30:59,472 --> 01:31:00,939
in the western hemisphere.

1811
01:31:01,007 --> 01:31:02,274
You don't even
need to see the show

1812
01:31:02,342 --> 01:31:03,942
to know to vote
for Camp Star.

1813
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:06,045
MAN:
One minute.

1814
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,046
How come I just got a text

1815
01:31:07,113 --> 01:31:08,980
telling me to vote
for Camp Star?

1816
01:31:09,049 --> 01:31:10,315
I just got one too.

1817
01:31:10,383 --> 01:31:11,917
Um, it's asking me
if I wanna download

1818
01:31:11,984 --> 01:31:13,385
Camp Star's song
as my ringtone.

1819
01:31:15,221 --> 01:31:16,721
You were really a star.

1820
01:31:16,789 --> 01:31:19,458
Thanks.

1821
01:31:19,526 --> 01:31:21,660
And I really gotta go.

1822
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:25,297
Oh, I hate crust on my bread,
and birds make me nervous.

1823
01:31:26,966 --> 01:31:31,170
Excuse me. Oh, uh, that
performance was amazing.

1824
01:31:31,237 --> 01:31:33,004
Thank you.

1825
01:31:33,073 --> 01:31:34,639
Don't you have somewhere
to be?

1826
01:31:34,707 --> 01:31:36,308
Yes, but, you know,

1827
01:31:36,376 --> 01:31:39,311
once you start expressing your
innermost thoughts and feelings,

1828
01:31:39,379 --> 01:31:40,712
it's kind of hard to stop.

1829
01:31:42,615 --> 01:31:43,615
Wish us luck.

1830
01:31:43,683 --> 01:31:45,284
Good luck.

1831
01:31:45,351 --> 01:31:48,287
Dana, he is the enemy.

1832
01:31:48,354 --> 01:31:50,055
No, he's not.

1833
01:31:50,123 --> 01:31:52,023
Not everything in life
is a competition.

1834
01:31:53,326 --> 01:31:56,562
But I think I just won.

1835
01:32:01,301 --> 01:32:04,002
{all cheering and applauding}

1836
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:06,037
And we're back.
If you liked Camp Star,

1837
01:32:06,106 --> 01:32:08,840
get ready to be blown away
by Camp Rock.

1838
01:32:08,908 --> 01:32:11,009

¶¶ They say that life
Is a two-way street ¶¶

1847
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:44,676
¶¶ When you're not sure
You gotta trust your feet ¶¶

1848
01:32:44,744 --> 01:32:48,180
¶¶ To know the right way ¶¶

1849
01:32:48,248 --> 01:32:51,116
¶¶ You can keep on moving
With your head down ¶¶

1850
01:32:51,184 --> 01:32:53,185
¶¶ Or you can stop
And take a look around ¶¶

1851
01:32:53,253 --> 01:32:54,853
¶¶ Take a look around ¶¶

1852
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:57,356
¶¶ And that's the choice
I've made ¶¶

In your soul ¶¶

1869
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:52,211
¶¶ Every time we sing ¶¶

Gonna make me laugh ¶¶

Whoo!

1906
01:36:05,177 --> 01:36:07,479
GEORGINA:
Weren't they incredible?

1907
01:36:07,547 --> 01:36:11,216
So call in now, and tell us
which summer camp rules.

1908
01:36:11,283 --> 01:36:13,819
And don't go anywhere.
We'll be right back.

1909
01:36:18,758 --> 01:36:21,059
Call in, call in.

1910
01:36:21,126 --> 01:36:22,293
Yes!

1911
01:36:22,362 --> 01:36:24,062
MAN:
Wow!

1912
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,100

{dramatic theme playing}

1914
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:40,679
Impressive,
but it'll never sell.

1915
01:36:42,715 --> 01:36:46,084
You know, uh, it should still
be about the music.

1916
01:36:46,152 --> 01:36:48,153
Maybe so,

1917
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:51,623
but that's why you'll never
make it in this business.

1918
01:36:51,691 --> 01:36:53,425
That's fine.

1919
01:36:53,492 --> 01:36:55,561
I don't wanna be
in your business.

1920
01:36:55,628 --> 01:36:57,796
{chuckles}

1921

{all cheering and applauding}

1922
01:36:59,999 --> 01:37:02,668
And the results are in.

1923
01:37:02,735 --> 01:37:06,638
{suspenseful theme playing}

1927
01:38:34,426 --> 01:38:38,229
You know, I was thinking about
keeping this as a souvenir.

1928
01:38:39,832 --> 01:38:41,599
Can't believe we lost.

1929
01:38:46,405 --> 01:38:47,939
Every song
can't be a hit.

1930
01:38:50,543 --> 01:38:52,310
Isn't that
what you told me?

1931
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:57,149
It doesn't mean
we have to stop singing.

1932
01:39:02,388 --> 01:39:05,390
I'm really sorry I didn't spend
more time with you this summer.

1933
01:39:05,457 --> 01:39:07,759
Hey, the whole reason
I came here--

1934
01:39:07,827 --> 01:39:10,361
Was to get
to know me better.

1935
01:39:10,429 --> 01:39:12,630
And I've learned everything
I need to know.

¶¶ Come grab your guitar ¶¶

1947
01:40:24,503 --> 01:40:27,639
¶¶ Sit by the fire ¶¶

1948
01:40:27,706 --> 01:40:31,276
¶¶ 'Cause we all need a song ¶¶

1949

¶¶ When we're weary and tired ¶¶

1950

¶¶ We'll sit here together ¶¶

1951
01:40:39,218 --> 01:40:42,320
¶¶ And sing it out loud ¶¶
¶¶ And sing it out loud ¶¶

¶¶ This is our song

Than singing' along ¶¶

1955

¶¶ This is our summer
And this is our song ¶¶

1956

¶¶ This is our song ¶¶

01:41:14,887 --> 01:41:16,822
GIRL:
Hey, you guys, look.

1961
01:41:16,889 --> 01:41:17,956
Check it out.

{all chattering}

1963
01:41:26,465 --> 01:41:28,733
Hi, we saw the fire.

1964
01:41:28,801 --> 01:41:30,401
We really don't get
to do this kind of thing.

1965
01:41:30,469 --> 01:41:34,706
So we were hoping there was room
for some of us to join.

1966
01:41:34,773 --> 01:41:36,975
There's always room.
Brown, if it's okay with you,

1967
01:41:37,043 --> 01:41:39,277
I'd really like to come back
to Camp Rock next summer.

1968
01:41:39,345 --> 01:41:41,112
Come on.

Hey, can I get
a little help inside?

1972
01:41:49,088 --> 01:41:51,756
The phones are going crazy.
Yeah, sure, I'll help.

1973
01:41:51,824 --> 01:41:54,792
I told my parents I wanna
come here instead next summer.

Please, can you put us
on the list?

1977
01:42:04,337 --> 01:42:06,371
This place
is so much more fun.

1978
01:42:06,438 --> 01:42:08,240
I'm sure we can
work something out.
