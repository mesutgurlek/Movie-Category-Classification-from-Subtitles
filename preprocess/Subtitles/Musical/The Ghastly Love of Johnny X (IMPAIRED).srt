We got a problem here, Clayton.

628
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:22,011
The spirit of Rock and Roll
dictates that I do what I want

to do and managers be damned.

630

Now you're asking me
to go against that spirit,

631
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:31,821
to do what my premonition
tells me not to do.

632
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,656
To help my fellow
man, to help you?

633

In a nutshell, yes.

Okay.

636
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:43,199

each other, buddy.

My own father.

814
00:52:20,171 --> 00:52:22,538
You can't go anywhere now,
can you?

815
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,643
You can't leave me this time.

I always knew I'd find
you someday.

I wanted to share some kind
words with you, Dad.

That's all I ever wanted.

01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:24,425
for your buddy Mickey?

1132
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:25,827
Would I!

1133
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,428
Yes, you would.

1134
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:29,197
Just a moment, Mick.

1135
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:33,434
I forgot something,
but I'll be right back, okay?

1136
01:09:33,436 --> 01:09:36,738
I believe you mentioned
something about a chariot.

1137
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:40,842
On our planet, pleasure and pain
is not to be experienced,

1138
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:43,511
let alone enjoyed.

1139
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:47,682
You should really
watch what you say in public.

1140
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:51,352
You could give a fella
the... wrong impression.

1141
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:58,193
You're a sweet kid,
but I'm a bit lost here.

1142
01:09:58,195 --> 01:10:00,862
Maybe I latched onto
the wrong...

1143
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:02,530
boy.

1144
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,604
Is it getting cold out
here or is that just you?

1145
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,209
Oh, come on.

1146
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:17,212
Don't be such a thespian.

1147
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:18,713
Chip?

1148
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:23,251
♪

1149
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:25,553
No, Sluggo--
No, not the pill!

1150
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,222
Anything but that, Sluggo!

1151
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:29,557
Not the big pill, please!

1152
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:30,959
( Screaming )

1153
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:33,228
( engine puttering )

1154
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:44,439
( Dandi ) What's up with her?
A little too much freedom.

1155
01:10:44,441 --> 01:10:46,808
Oh my God, I used
to be just like that.

1156
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:49,344
I guess I got better at
holding my liquor.

1157
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:55,516
Mmm, you smell just
like jasmine, my favorite.

1158
01:10:55,518 --> 01:10:57,585
Mine too, I think.

1159
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,354
Enough with
the chit-chat.

1160
01:10:59,356 --> 01:11:02,757
Let's agitate the gravel.

1161
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,260
Hold on.

1162
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,836
( Marty ) Hey, sleeping beauty.

1163
01:11:14,838 --> 01:11:17,305
Johnny wants you to have this.

1164
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:18,706
Bliss!

1165
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,642
Bliss, where's Bliss?

1166
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:24,379
A triumph, my pet.

1167
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:27,682
Of course, it wasn't easy,
but nothing in the world is.

1168
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:29,317
I'll tell you what.

1169
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:31,653
Let's go share some of
this celebration with Mickey

1170
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:34,956
and those juvenile delinquents
from outer space.

1171
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:38,526
Hey, save some of that
celebration for me, big daddy.

1172
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:41,929
Babe, the party ain't starting

1173
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:45,333
'til I see the whites
of your thighs.

1174
01:11:45,335 --> 01:11:47,502
Spoken like a true romantic.

1175
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:53,408
( Playfully growling )

1176
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,313
( timidly laughing )

1177
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,420
Oh!

1178
01:12:05,422 --> 01:12:06,888
Ah!

1179
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:11,426
Oh!

1180
01:12:11,428 --> 01:12:13,528
Oh, hey, Chip...

1181
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:15,029
I was just... I
was helping Lily with--

1182
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:16,864
She's gone!

1183
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:20,368
Who, the skirt? Bliss--
Her name is Bliss.

1184
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,969
Chip, you know girls.

1185
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:23,504
She probably just went to
the powder room or something.

1186
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:25,006
She's been dusted alright.

1187
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:28,409
That goon, Sluggo,
nabbed her, and Mickey too!

1188
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:31,846
My Mickey?
Your investment!

1189
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,849
( Dandi ) Like I said, jasmine would
be scent number one on my list.

1190
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,551
It is just short of orgasmic.

1191
01:12:36,553 --> 01:12:38,920
Number two would be a citrus
scent of some type,

1192
01:12:38,922 --> 01:12:42,924
maybe mandarin or kumquat
or even something grapefruity.

1193
01:12:42,926 --> 01:12:46,894
After that, mmm, I don't know,
probably rose petals,

1194
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:48,796
although that's a bit light.

1195
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:51,766
I'm a fan of heather and woodsy
smells like pine and birch

1196
01:12:51,768 --> 01:12:53,568
and anything
you'd find in nature.

1197
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:56,437
Things "au naturel" as
they say in Europe.

1198
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:58,039
When I was a kid,
honey was the bomb.

1199
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:01,542
I'd pour honey onto bread,
in my tea, in my milk,

1200
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:02,977
even on my eggs sometimes.

1201
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:05,713
I was crazy when I was a kid.

1202
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,749
I'll let you in on
a little secret.

1203
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:10,418
I still like to pour
honey onto certain things,

1204
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:13,488
if you take my meaning...

1205
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:14,922
It is so beautiful.

1206
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:16,524
Thank you.

1207
01:13:16,526 --> 01:13:17,925
Cinnamon, nutmeg...

1208
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:20,495
I mean, the infinity
of it all...

1209
01:13:20,497 --> 01:13:23,097
Honey, whipped cream,
chocolate sauce, butterscotch,

1210
01:13:23,099 --> 01:13:24,699
strawberry jam...

1211
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:26,734
Bonbons?
Huh?

1212
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,569
Do you like bonbons?
Oh, yeah--

1213
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:32,407
They're aged, but tasty.

1214
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:34,842
That reminds me--
How old are you, darling?

1215
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:36,911
18.

1216
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:40,848
18, my favorite flavor.

1217
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:43,418
Slugster.

1218
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,920
What time is it, please?

1219
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,689
Almost midnight.
Perfect.

1220
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:50,691
There's someone I'd want
to drop in on.

1221
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:52,760
At this hour?

1222
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:56,597
Thanks one and all for staying
tuned through that interlude.

1223
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:59,801
And now let's bring back
the Potentate of Pleasantry,

1224
01:13:59,803 --> 01:14:01,702
the Sultan of Civility.

1225
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:05,840
Who else could be better
company, but Cousin Quilty?

1226
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:07,942
Shut up.

1227
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,744
We're having a discussion here.

1228
01:14:09,746 --> 01:14:11,145
We're with the lovely
Miss Robin.

1229
01:14:11,147 --> 01:14:12,747
Actress.

1230
01:14:12,749 --> 01:14:14,148
Star?

1231
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:15,783
Potential squeeze
for Cousin Quilty.

1232
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,185
Ha!
( mild laughter )

1233
01:14:17,187 --> 01:14:19,487
Maybe not...
Where were we?

1234
01:14:19,489 --> 01:14:21,956
New Mexico,
the land of enchantment.

1235
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,459
Actually, Cousin Quilty,

1236
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:25,893
we were here in your studio,

1237
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:27,795
and we're still here,

1238
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,197
I think.

1239
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,065
( Braying laughter )

1240
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:35,036
I think I'm in trouble.

1241
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:36,771
Okay, but seriously.
Okay.

1242
01:14:36,773 --> 01:14:38,172
Okay.
Okay.

1243
01:14:38,174 --> 01:14:39,807
I was visiting New Mexico

1244
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:43,110
when I had that first encounter
with a flying saucer.

1245
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:45,980
Flying saucer, fascinating.

1246
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,715
( Singsong fluttering )

1247
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:49,550
Flying saucer!
You seem skeptical.

1248
01:14:49,552 --> 01:14:50,952
Skeptical?

1249
01:14:50,954 --> 01:14:52,553
Au contraire, moped.

1250
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:55,022
I'm one of the few
living talk show hosts

1251
01:14:55,024 --> 01:14:56,858
who's actually been abducted.

1252
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,826
I spent several weeks with
the little fellows.

1253
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,529
They even took
a stab at impregnating me.

1254
01:15:01,531 --> 01:15:03,664
Fun, but fruitless.

1255
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,066
You held your ground.

1256
01:15:05,068 --> 01:15:07,001
Among other things, yes.

1257
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,836
Whatever do you mean?

1258
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:11,005
I'll show you later.

1259
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:13,875
( Engine rattling )

1260
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,687
Hey Mickey, where'd
they have you stashed?

1261
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,189
Sluggo, get rid of the geezer.

1262
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,926
Relax, lollipop, look at me.

1263
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:35,963
Look into my eyes and everything
is gonna be just fine.

1264
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:38,032
They're dreamy.
I know.

1265
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:41,969
Now you sit tight, you keep
an eye on Sluggo's playmate.

1266
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:45,806
I have a message for the people
and I'm in need of a medium.

1267
01:15:45,808 --> 01:15:47,308
Oh.

1268
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:51,045
You'll always be
an extra large to me, Mickey.

1269
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,721
Mick.

1270
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:03,925
Mick, I've been thinking.

1271
01:16:03,927 --> 01:16:06,327
We really ought to get
that suit of Johnny's

1272
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:07,929
so's I could protect you.

1273
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:09,564
Look up.
Huh?

1274
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,566
Look up.

1275
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:13,901
I hope I never forget

1276
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:16,270
the way the sky looks tonight.

1277
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,574
This is gonna sound crazy.

1278
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:22,743
Crazier than
a Quaker in a whorehouse.

1279
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:26,080
I look up there, I think
it's home.

1280
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,715
Maybe just--

1281
01:16:27,717 --> 01:16:31,185
But Mick, we need that suit.

1282
01:16:31,187 --> 01:16:34,188
How do you think you came back?

1283
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:36,591
From where?

1284
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:40,261
But they told me that my spirit
animal was an armadillo.

1285
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:41,896
Fascinating.

1286
01:16:41,898 --> 01:16:43,764
Yeah.

1287
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:45,600
Are you brain damaged or drunk?

1288
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:47,969
We're on the air.

1289
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:51,806
Where are we working tomorrow?

1290
01:16:51,808 --> 01:16:53,240
Ooh, this is a nice surprise.

1291
01:16:53,242 --> 01:16:55,142
Oh, no, no, don't tell me,
let me guess.

1292
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:57,979
The Martians have landed.
Oh, it's better than that.

1293
01:16:57,981 --> 01:16:59,780
Better than Martians?

1294
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,816
I have to tell you, folks, there
have been a lot of weird rumors

1295
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:03,317
circulating about this man.

1296
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:05,720
Tabloids have been reporting
that he's dropped dead.

1297
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:07,121
Or disappeared.

1298
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:08,723
Or even worse.

1299
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:10,291
But evidently,
nothing could keep him away

1300
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:12,360
from Cousin Quilty's
show tonight.

1301
01:17:12,362 --> 01:17:14,962
Put your hands
together, ladies and gentlemen,

1302
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:17,264
for one of the greatest
singers of all time,

1303
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:20,801
The Man With
the Grin, Mickey O'Flynn!

1304
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,370
( Clapping, gong sounds )

1305
01:17:22,372 --> 01:17:26,641
There we go.

1306
01:17:26,643 --> 01:17:28,042
Hi!

1307
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:30,244
Oh--

1308
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:32,146
Mickey.

1309
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,981
Looking--

1310
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:35,716
You're looking good.

1311
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:38,152
I'll give you
a Cousin Quilty welcome.

1312
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,087
( Singsong warbling )

1313
01:17:40,089 --> 01:17:42,757
Thanks for having me, Quilt.

1314
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:45,026
Who's this lovely little
hummingbird?

1315
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:47,328
( Squealing, growling )

1316
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,296
I'm sorry, I should
have introduced you.

1317
01:17:49,298 --> 01:17:52,700
This is the lovely Robin Wray,
star of "Beatnik Buffalo."

1318
01:17:52,702 --> 01:17:54,869
( slurping, awkward laughter )

1319
01:17:54,871 --> 01:17:57,104
"Beatnik Barbecue."
"Beatnik Barbecue."

1320
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:59,173
Oh, if that's
an invitation to dinner,

1321
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,042
you can count me in, darling.

1322
01:18:01,044 --> 01:18:02,443
I don't eat meat.

1323
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:04,245
Well, except in the movie,
of course.

1324
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:06,147
There's been a lot of rumors
about what's been happening

1325
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:08,683
with you lately, Mick.
That's why I'm here, Quilt.

1326
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:11,886
I want to tell the whole world
that I'm alive.

1327
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,855
I'm alive and
I feel magnificent.

1328
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:17,425
( Clapping and whistling )

1329
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,731
Now that's a coincidence.

1330
01:18:23,733 --> 01:18:25,199
( Clayton ) Mickey?

1331
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:26,901
( Bonni ) And that no-good
Sluggo is with him.

1332
01:18:26,903 --> 01:18:28,335
Traitor!

1333
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:30,104
It's not, like, a rerun?

1334
01:18:30,106 --> 01:18:32,273
Hey, hey, shut up--
I wanna hear this.

1335
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:35,209
So-- so you weren't
abducted by aliens?

1336
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:38,379
It was a carefully orchestrated
publicity stunt,

1337
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:42,717
the brainchild of my
former employer, King Clayton.

1338
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,452
That's it--
That does it.

1339
01:18:44,454 --> 01:18:46,921
I'm tearing up his contract!

1340
01:18:46,923 --> 01:18:49,890
Well, I guess the proverbial
cat is out of the bag.

1341
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,393
So get out of town
while you still can.

1342
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:54,328
Oh, wow.

1343
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:56,297
My face?
Are you okay?

1344
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:59,400
My face is flopping off,
what the hell's going on?

1345
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:01,736
Am I sick--
Am I sick?

1346
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:03,337
No, no, no,
it's just--

1347
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:05,272
Do I look sick? <i>No,
you look fine, Mick.</i>

1348
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:07,007
<i>Well, heck.</i>

1349
01:19:07,009 --> 01:19:08,476
There's just so many
beautiful things out there.

1350
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:10,244
In fact, on the way
over tonight,

1351
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:12,079
look what I found.

1352
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:16,917
It was just lying there in the
road, unnoticed and unloved,

1353
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:20,354
yet all the beauty
and mystery of life can be found

1354
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:24,959
in that serpentine, sensual,
sinewy body.

1355
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:26,360
Look at it.

1356
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:28,262
It's exotic--
whoop--

1357
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,864
It's deadly.

1358
01:19:29,866 --> 01:19:31,398
It's alive!
( shrieking )

1359
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:36,103
Yes.

1360
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:39,073
It's the booze,
Daddy-o.

1361
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:41,108
Mickey, who is
this dapper young man

1362
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,510
you've brought along with you?

1363
01:19:42,512 --> 01:19:44,211
A friendly friend?

1364
01:19:44,213 --> 01:19:45,813
Ah Quilt, he's more than that.

1365
01:19:45,815 --> 01:19:47,214
Sluggo is my son.

1366
01:19:47,216 --> 01:19:48,883
Fine looking young man.

1367
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:51,185
I didn't exactly germinate
his mom's hooha

1368
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:52,787
or anything like that,

1369
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:55,122
but Sluggo is my son.

1370
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,825
That rotten dirtbag.

1371
01:19:57,827 --> 01:20:01,128
And to think, I love them both.

1372
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,997
Adopted?

1373
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:06,333
Yeah, damn straight,
100% bona fide adoptee.

1374
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:09,970
The son I always wanted.

1375
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:12,006
Don't touch that dial.

1376
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:15,075
<i>We're coming</i> <i>right back!</i>

1377
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,881
<i>I'd like say a word</i>
<i>about Chesterfields.</i>

1378
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:22,316
Where's that studio?

1379
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,951
We have to save Bliss.

1380
01:20:23,953 --> 01:20:25,452
What's Bliss got to
do with this?

1381
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:27,054
I said, what's
Bliss got--

1382
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:29,190
Johnny, Johnny...
They got Bliss.

1383
01:20:29,192 --> 01:20:30,591
Sluggo abducted her.

1384
01:20:30,593 --> 01:20:32,493
Double whammy!
What?

1385
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:34,495
Well, what are we doing waiting
around her-- Let's scramble!

1386
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:36,363
Unlikely they'd
still be there, chief.

1387
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:40,067
The Quilty show is on
a one-hour delay.

1388
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:44,038
Hello, The Cave, the utmost in
underground entertainment,

1389
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,873
how can I--

1390
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,541
Oh.

1391
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:49,143
Sorry.

1392
01:20:49,145 --> 01:20:50,544
Yeah, sweetie, he's right here.

1393
01:20:50,546 --> 01:20:53,914
Johnny, it's for you.

1394
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:55,883
It's Mickey's son.

1395
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:57,284
Speak, dead man.

1396
01:20:57,286 --> 01:20:59,019
Bring the suit, punk.

1397
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:01,255
That is, if you want to see
your little Miss Muffet

1398
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:02,957
all in one piece.

1399
01:21:02,959 --> 01:21:04,525
What makes you think I care?

1400
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:06,493
A juggler has balls,
doesn't he?

1401
01:21:06,495 --> 01:21:08,462
Don't make
me laugh, pretty boy.

1402
01:21:08,464 --> 01:21:10,297
She's got yours and tight.

1403
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:13,467
Mickey, I don't think
I like your son--

1404
01:21:13,469 --> 01:21:15,369
He scares me.

1405
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:18,606
Now, now, he just wants
to do what's right for us.

1406
01:21:18,608 --> 01:21:21,508
He's got a big heart beneath
all that blubber.

1407
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:24,912
The suit--
Damnation's Hole, two hours!

1408
01:21:24,914 --> 01:21:27,548
All right, you really crossed
the line this time, Sluggo.

1409
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:29,183
All right, I'll be there.

1410
01:21:29,185 --> 01:21:32,953
But I'm warning you,
it's gonna get ugly.

1411
01:21:32,955 --> 01:21:36,290
Good, you'll know what it
feels like to be me.

1412
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:38,926
He has mean nostrils,
have you noticed?

1413
01:21:38,928 --> 01:21:41,996
He's a good egg, he's
just a little hard-boiled.

1414
01:21:41,998 --> 01:21:43,397
Two hours!

1415
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,301
Not like you Mickey.

1416
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:49,103
You're boiled to perfection.

1417
01:21:49,105 --> 01:21:50,504
Sunny side up.

1418
01:21:50,506 --> 01:21:52,139
Oh.

1419
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:54,008
Don't get all clingy now.

1420
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:55,910
Mickey needs his space, Mama.

1421
01:21:55,912 --> 01:21:58,245
You heard the man--
Give him some room, bitch!

1422
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:00,080
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1423
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:02,116
I think she gets your point.

1424
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:05,119
She's not that bad,
she's just a tad pushy.

1425
01:22:05,121 --> 01:22:06,921
You and Bliss I got
to tolerate,

1426
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:09,356
at least until I get
that suit and I'm in charge.

1427
01:22:09,358 --> 01:22:11,959
But her, I don't got
to tolerate.

1428
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:15,095
All I got to do to her is
kick her bony butt to the curb!

1429
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:17,298
Here, get out!

1430
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,099
Get out of the car!

1431
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:23,637
Thanks for the wheels,
Earth slut!

1432
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:27,608
Mickey!

1433
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:30,277
Mickey!

1434
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:35,482
( Distant screaming )

1435
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:40,321
I'll have 'em all
marching to the sound

1436
01:22:40,323 --> 01:22:42,990
of Sluggo's jukebox when
I get that suit,

1437
01:22:42,992 --> 01:22:47,161
a whole planet of zombies
here to do Sluggo's bidding!

1438
01:22:47,163 --> 01:22:49,129
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

1439
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,298
In this perfect world, why
would you want to--

1440
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,200
Don't you get it, old man?

1441
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:55,002
You must have short circuited
a few wires

1442
01:22:55,004 --> 01:22:56,637
while you were in Hell.

1443
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:00,007
As bad as I am,
you're even worse.

1444
01:23:00,009 --> 01:23:03,677
All right, let's finish this
thing, right here, right now.

1445
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:07,047
We'll give 'em
the old cherry smash.

1446
01:23:07,049 --> 01:23:08,482
