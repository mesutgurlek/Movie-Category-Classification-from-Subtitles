plenty ofbounces,

916
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:48,300
Got to be more´n that gal
could handle,

917
01:11:48,371 --> 01:11:52,239
and Sue took off
like a Roman candle,

918
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:05,554
That devilish contraption
ofsteel and wire,,,

919
01:12:06,756 --> 01:12:09,623
kept bouncin´ that poor gal
higher and higher,

920
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:11,956
Soon it was plain
to the multitude,,,

921
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:14,223
that Sue was
a-gainin´altitude,

922
01:12:14,297 --> 01:12:17,232
Sure looked like
she was a goner,

923
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,768
But no,
Here come a ray ofhope,

924
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:23,772
Look! I t were Bi I l
and his trusty rope.

925
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,900
He´d durn soon
put a stop to this,

926
01:12:26,976 --> 01:12:30,241
- Shucks, Bill was never knowed to miss,
- [ Crash ]

927
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:34,875
Bill was calm, confident,

928
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:36,919
He built his loop
with careless ease,

929
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:40,251
He judged his distance,
tested the breeze,

930
01:12:41,658 --> 01:12:44,252
Then a whirl and a twirl
and a twist ofthe wrist,

931
01:12:44,327 --> 01:12:46,261
He let ´er go,,,

932
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:52,260
but the champeen missed,

933
01:12:52,335 --> 01:12:57,102
How it come to happen,
nobody could ever figure out,

934
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:59,607
## [ Whistl i ng ]

935
01:13:02,078 --> 01:13:04,546
She was offagain
on her heavenly flight,

936
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:09,481
Up, up she went,
clean out ofsight,

937
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:13,613
till far into space
this unfortunate maid,,,

938
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:16,181
finally come to the moon,

939
01:13:16,259 --> 01:13:18,227
and that´s where she stayed,

940
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,626
In the state ofTexas,
U,S,A,,

941
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:26,430
Iife still goes on
in the same old way,,,

942
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:29,335
and the Pecos River
still flows on,

943
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,169
but the greatest cowboy
on Earth,,,

944
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,175
is gone,

945
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:37,406
Yeah, Bill went back
to the coyotes,

946
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,108
but he never forgot Sue,

947
01:13:40,183 --> 01:13:42,674
And every night,
when the moon ris´high,

948
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,243
he´d lift his voice
in mournful cry,

949
01:13:45,321 --> 01:13:48,347
- [ Howl i ng ]
- Bewailin´ the fate ofhis lady fair,

950
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:51,587
his long lost love
in the sky up there,

951
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:54,323
- [ Howling Continues ]
- So painful was his griefto see,

952
01:13:54,397 --> 01:13:58,128
the varmints joined in
out ofsympathy,

953
01:13:58,201 --> 01:14:01,637
And that´s how come,
to this very day,

954
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:05,140
coyotes howl at the moon
that way,

955
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:08,041
- # Move along #
- # Move along #

956
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:10,807
# Bl ue shadows #

957
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:16,011
- # Move along #
- # Move along,  move along,  move along #

958
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:19,179
# Soon the dawn will come #

959
01:14:19,255 --> 01:14:23,453
# And you´ll be
on yourway #

960
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:26,791
# On yourway #

961
01:14:26,863 --> 01:14:29,559
# But until #

962
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:31,566
#The darkness #

963
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:36,731
# Sheds its veil #

964
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:42,073
#There´ll be
blue shadows #

965
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:46,741
# On the trail #

966
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:49,216
# Shadows on #

967
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:53,016
#The trail ##
