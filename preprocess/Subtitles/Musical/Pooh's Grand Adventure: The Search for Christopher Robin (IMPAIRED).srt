00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:26,018
[narrator] Once upon the last day
of a golden summer,

2
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,992
there was a boy... and bear.

3
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,797
The boy, whom we shall meet in
a moment, was called Christopher Robin.

4
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:41,326
The bear was called Winnie the Pooh.

5
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:50,012
And together they had many
grand adventures in a remarkable place

6
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:53,175
called the Hundred Acre Wood.

7
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:57,784
But the grandest and most extraordinary
of all their adventures

8
00:00:57,855 --> 00:00:59,846
was still to begin.

9
00:01:15,106 --> 00:01:19,702
T oday, I believe, is a good day
for being Pooh.

10
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:21,768
[hums]

11
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:29,043
And here, I should say,
is a good place for being Pooh.

12
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,111
[hums]

13
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:38,187
Any reason that I think of
is a good one for being Pooh.

14
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:40,253
[hums]

15
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,125
[Iaughs]

16
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:46,726
But the very best reason of all is...

17
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:48,635
[boy] Pooh Bear.

18
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:53,109
...being with my very best friend,
Christopher Robin.

19
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:57,974
You are just in time
for the best part of the day.

20
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,914
What part is that?

21
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:02,578
The part when you and me...

22
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,655
...become we.

23
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:09,819
[clattering]

24
00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:16,265
Pooh,...
there's something I have to tell you.

25
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:18,666
Is it something nice?

26
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:22,270
Not exactly.

27
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,501
Then it can wait.

28
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:28,102
It can? For how Iong?

[Pooh chuckles]

00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:48,155
# Forever isn't long at all, Christopher

50

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,126
# I wanna be with you forever

# One thing you should know

00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:09,338
# No matter where I go

# We'll always be together

# For ever and ever #

58
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:20,349
[narrator] And so they stayed together,

59
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:24,019
doing all the things
a boy and a bear could do.

60
00:04:24,094 --> 00:04:26,562
And when the day began to end,

61
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:32,933
Christopher Robin had quite forgotten
he still had something to tell Pooh.

62
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:37,832
[Christopher] Pooh Bear,
there's one thing we didn't do today.

63
00:04:37,908 --> 00:04:40,172
[Pooh] And what thing might that be?

64
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:42,235
[Christopher] Uh... nothing.

65
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,404
Nothing?

66
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:50,114
Christopher Robin,
what exactly is "doing nothing"?

67
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:53,112
Well, I'm told it means

68
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,354
going along, Iistening to
all of the things you can't hear,

69
00:04:57,428 --> 00:04:59,896
and not bothering.

70
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:04,031
It's when people say
"What are you two doing?"

71
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:06,569
And we say "Oh, nothing."

72
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:08,537
And we do it.

73
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:11,370
This is sort of a nothing thing
we're doing right now.

74
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:16,979
I wish it could Iast forever.

75
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:19,914
Well, then we must do it again tomorrow.

76
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:23,613
And the tomorrow after.
And the tomorrow following that.

77
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:30,726
Pooh Bear,... what if... some day...

78
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:35,527
there came a tomorrow
when we were apart?

79
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:39,933
As Iong as we're apart together
we shall certainly be fine.

80
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:43,301
[chuckles] Yes, yes, of course.

81
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:46,741
But if we weren't together?

82
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,938
If I were somewhere else?

83
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:52,915
[chuckles] But you really couldn't be,

84
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:55,918
as I would be quite Iost without you.

when I'm just not strong enough,

00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:05,522
or brave enough?

89
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:07,257
Well, actually...

90
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:09,765
And who would I ask for advice

91

when we're not together,

00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:51,901
Oh, relax, Piglet, old pal.

169
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:56,378
There's no difference between plunging
1 0,000 feet to the jagged rocks below

170
00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:58,971
and tumblin' out of bed.

171
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:03,512
Oh, really?

172
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:06,351
Why, sure! [Iaughs]

173
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:12,590
Except for the splat at the end
they're practic'Iy similar.

174
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:18,762
Christopher Robin!

175
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:21,565
Hmm.
CIutched in the throes of terror, eh?

176
00:12:21,638 --> 00:12:25,335
Well, I guess I just better
bounce up there and get him down.

177
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:29,869
Stand back, this is gonna take
a world's record bounce.

178
00:12:45,262 --> 00:12:46,923
What's the matter with you?

179
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:50,797
Being a second-rate bouncer
is not what tiggers Iike best.

180
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:00,640
[rumbling]

181
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:10,153
[creaking]

182
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:11,211
[creaking]

183
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:12,653
[strains]

184
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:24,065
[strains]

185
00:13:24,134 --> 00:13:25,624
[shrieks]

186
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:30,100
It doesn't matter
if you think you're not ripe.

187
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:35,770
This is Rabbit's garden, and Rabbit
does his harvesting by the book.

188
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:41,112
As it clearly says
in the official almanac,

189
00:13:41,184 --> 00:13:44,847
"Today is... [clears throat]
the first day of fall

190
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:47,754
following the Iast day of summer."

191
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:51,157
Harvest day.

192
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:52,695
Any questions?

193
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:54,526
[Pooh] Hello.

194
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:58,432
Oh, yes, the rutabaga in the back row,
"Hello" what?

195
00:13:58,502 --> 00:14:00,493
[rumbling]

196
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,564
[shrieks]

197
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,631
[Pooh] Hello, Rabbit.

198
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:11,614
Not much of a house.

199
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:16,010
Just right for not much of a donkey.

200
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:19,021
[Rabbit gibbers]

201
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:20,351
[shrieks]

202
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:29,760
Easy come,... easy go.

203
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:34,093
Excuse me, Rabbit,...

204
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:38,297
but would you happen to have a...

205
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:44,036
a, um,... Christopher Robin about you?

206
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:46,275
No! I haven't seen him.

207
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:49,451
- Bother.
- [thud]

208
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,885
- He isn't where he should be.
- [thud]

209
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:54,788
- And wasn't where we were.
- [thud]

210
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:57,326
- And seems not to be anywhere...
- [thud]

211
00:14:57,394 --> 00:15:00,727
...where he can tell me
whose honey this is.

212
00:15:00,797 --> 00:15:02,230
[thud]

213
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,130
Well, it isn't mine.

214
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:08,331
And I don't have time. It's harvest day!
Says so in the book!

215
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:12,466
I have carrots to cut, pumpkins to pick,
peas to pluck!

216
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:18,645
Well, of course it's mine.
It's got my name scribbled all over it.

217
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:21,582
T-I double g...

218
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:25,246
Honey?! Yuck!

219
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:27,313
P-tooie! BIech!

220
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,089
Tiggers do not Iike honey.

221
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:36,790
It isn't mine.

222
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:41,294
Then again, few things are.

223
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:43,362
[grunts and groans]

224
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:47,399
Oh, here!

225
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:50,810
If only I could find Christopher Robin.

226
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:52,974
He could tell me whose it is.

227
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:57,110
Why don't you check the note
and find out?

228
00:15:58,488 --> 00:16:00,251
A note!

229
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:02,757
Why, Rabbit, how clever of you.

230
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,651
I'II just read it.

231
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:09,357
Or would...

232
00:16:09,432 --> 00:16:11,423
if I could.

233
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:14,527
Perhaps you can, Rabbit.

234
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,041
[harrumphs] I could read this
with my eyes closed.

235
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:23,875
[chuckles]

236
00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:25,539
It says... [clears throat]

237
00:16:25,615 --> 00:16:27,606
[talks nonsense]

238
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:53,003
Well, I could have read it
if Tigger hadn't bounced me so.

239
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,106
Tar? Jar?

240
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,241
Oh, far!

241
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,788
"Dear Pooh" it begins.

242
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:09,086
"Worry about me."

243
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:14,256
"I'm going far away."

244
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:18,825
"Help!" And the note is signed
"Crelm-flummin Bobbin."

245
00:17:20,003 --> 00:17:22,563
[chuckles] Oh, Christopher Robin.

246
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:24,072
Christopher Robin?

247
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,109
Gone far away?
Oh, what a frightful thought.

248
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:31,974
Wait! Why? When?

249
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:34,141
Who authorized it?

250
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:38,017
Where will we get the strength...
to go on without him?

251
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:39,453
[whimpers]

252
00:17:39,522 --> 00:17:41,513
[Pooh] Christopher Robin.

253
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:52,198
My very best best friend.

254
00:17:53,937 --> 00:17:55,928
It simply cannot be.

255
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:59,570
Whatever will I do?

256
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:04,603
I wonder, Pooh, if... if perhaps
u-u-until Christopher Robin gets back...

257
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:08,481
um... I might possibly be your...

258
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:11,377
best best friend.

259
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:14,080
Yeah. [sobs]

260
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:18,924
And when Piglet gets sick of you...
[sobs] we can take over.

261
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:20,724
Oh, thank you.

262
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:25,063
But you already are
the very best of my best friends.

263
00:18:25,135 --> 00:18:28,468
You see, you and I can do anything.

264
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:33,175
But only Christopher Robin and I
could do...

265
00:18:33,943 --> 00:18:35,740
nothing.

266
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:40,975
Poor guy. His very Iittle brain
is half gone with grief.

267
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:45,647
Ah-ha! I've discovered where he went.

268
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,622
[Iaughs]

269
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:52,487
An O, another O, and...

270
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:55,793
[gasps] Oh, my.

271
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:58,129
What is it, Owl? Where is it?

272
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:00,795
Somewhere bad, I fear.

273
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:03,503
How bad?

274
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:06,201
On a scale of one to ten...

275
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:09,268
It's not good.

276
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:09,512
[match strikes]

277
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:10,604
[match strikes]

278
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,619
He has gone to S-C-H-O-O-L.

279
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:18,779
[gasps] Skull.

280
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:21,889
Skull?

281
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:24,987
What sort of place is that?

282
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:27,962
Well, from the very sound of it,

283
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:32,695
one can tell it's a most forbidding
and faraway place.

284
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:38,236
Then we must help Christopher Robin.

285
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:40,936
Help him get back... to here.

286
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,534
And us.

287
00:19:42,612 --> 00:19:44,637
And me.

288
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:49,344
Then it's a quest, is it? [Iaughs]
That's the spirit.

289
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:52,547
Hoo, the nobility of it.

290
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:58,561
A Iong and dangerous journey
through the Great Unknown.

291
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:00,653
Of course, you'II need a map.

292
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,891
D-d-d-dangerous?

293
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:09,936
Oh, Owl,... you wouldn't suppose
we'd meet any, uh...

294
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:12,998
Heffalumps?

295
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:17,069
Oh, thank you, I nearly forgot.
Herds of Heffalumps.

296
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:18,978
[mutters]

297
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:24,714
Down here I fancy, in the... southeast
corner of the far west portion.

298
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:27,757
W-w-what about W-w-woozles?

299
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:29,917
Woozles! Wonderful!

300
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:34,625
- Jagulars?
- Hoo-hoo, just a dozen or three.

301
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:37,188
Here, there and yonder.

302
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:40,259
Not to mention the fabled... [chuckles]

303
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:42,327
Skullasaurus.

304
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,272
S-skulla...s-saurus?

305
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:48,435
Oh, come, come, come.

306
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,309
Without a monster or two
it's hardly a quest.

307
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:53,975
Merely a gaggle of friends
wandering about.

308
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:58,278
Hoo-hoo-hoo, how I envy you.

309
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:02,586
Not everyone has the chance
to face the unspeakable terrors

310
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:05,093
of the Great Unknown.

311
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:07,686
# Today's the day

312
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:12,030
# In only a matter of moments
You'll all be on your way

313
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:17,603
# What lurks around the corner
Not a soul can say

314
00:21:18,174 --> 00:21:19,801
# But I can guess

315
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:21,571
# More or less

316
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:25,347
# Hidden dangers, great duress

317
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:30,409
# Ah, the moment of glory
Is close at hand

318
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:34,814
# Hoo-wee, it's gonna be grand

319
00:21:36,793 --> 00:21:40,388
# Adventure is a wonderful thing

320
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:44,263
# Pack only the essentials
I'll tell you what to bring

321
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:47,667
# Your strength, your nerve
Your hearts, your wits

322
00:21:47,737 --> 00:21:51,503
# And for skullasaurus attacks
First-aid kits

323
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:54,236
# Adventure is a hoot and a half

324
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:58,607
# You'll face unearthly dangers
And look at them and laugh

325
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:02,344
# The claws, the teeth
The chase, the thrill

326
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:05,854
# You'll never want to come home
Maybe you never will

327
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:09,551
# That's the beauty of adventure
It's strictly sink or float

328
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:13,357
# It runs you till you're ragged
Then it grabs you by the throat

329
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:17,422
# You'll struggle to survive
Although the chances are remote

330
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,459
# Hoo-hoo, lucky you
Wish I was coming too

331
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:24,701
# Adventure is a wonderful thing

332
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:27,805
I almost forgot the very best part.

333
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:32,109
You not only save your friend from
the most dangerous place, namely Skull,

334
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:35,412
but from the most dangerous part
of the most dangerous place.

335
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:38,352
The eye of the skull itself.

336
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:41,045
Oh, bother.

337
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:44,616
# And you, General Pooh

338
00:22:44,694 --> 00:22:48,391
# Off you go
Marching high and low

339
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:51,763
# Your friend waits at the end

340
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,927
# Right here

341
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:59,339
# Take a look
The map is perfectly clear

342
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:03,675
# With your excellent sense of direction
You've nothing to fear

343
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:07,509
# Through the quicksand and the chasms

344
00:23:07,584 --> 00:23:10,212
# Tempting fate and fighting spasms

345
00:23:10,286 --> 00:23:12,413
# Dodging avalanching boulders

346
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:13,614
# Remember

347
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:19,822
# Christopher Robin's fate
Rests completely on your shoulders, Pooh

348
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:20,920
Excuse me.

349
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:24,694
# It's up to you

350
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:27,292
# That's the beauty of adventure

351
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,201
# The trembling and the dread

352
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:33,436
# I can't think of another thing
I'd rather do instead

353
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:35,033
Perhaps you could join us?

354
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:37,102
# No, no, you go ahead

355
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:43,217
# Hoo-hoo, lucky you
Tally-ho and toodle-oo

356
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:46,813
# Ready now? Noble chin
Chest out, tummy in

357
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:48,914
# Make a fracas, have a fling

358
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,550
# Drop a postcard, give a ring

359
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:52,527
# Get the lead out, time to swing

360
00:23:52,595 --> 00:23:54,222
# Whoop-de-doo and ba-da-bing

361
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:57,061
# Adventure

362
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:59,124
# Is a wonderful thing #

363
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:04,230
I salute you. And those of you doomed
to never return, I salute you twice.

364
00:24:12,048 --> 00:24:15,211
[narrator] And so Pooh and his friends
crossed over

365
00:24:15,284 --> 00:24:19,983
into... well, that part
of the Hundred Acre Wood

366
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:24,356
which Owl called the "Great Unknown. "

367
00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:29,926
It was the start of their quest
for Christopher Robin.

368
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:35,733
They would find him, Owl said,
if they could get through the woods.

369
00:24:36,406 --> 00:24:41,366
For the woods, Owl said,
were filled with Heffalumps...

370
00:24:42,145 --> 00:24:44,136
and Woozles,...

371
00:24:44,714 --> 00:24:48,775
and... who knew how much worse?

372
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:52,878
Look!

373
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,750
"The Upside Down Rock."

374
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:59,852
"If you've made it this far...

375
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:04,298
you're where... monsters... are."

376
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:06,494
[distant growling]

377
00:25:14,977 --> 00:25:16,467
What was that?

378
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:19,037
Sounded too hungry for a Heffalump.

379
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:21,106
[growling continues]

380
00:25:21,884 --> 00:25:24,079
Too plump for a Jagular.

381
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:26,144
[growling continues]

382
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:29,350
I'd say it's a... big old...

383
00:25:29,425 --> 00:25:34,226
buggy-eyed, saber-toothy skullasaurus.

384
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:35,821
Skullasaurus?

385
00:25:35,898 --> 00:25:38,025
- Which way do we run?
- Where do we hide?

386
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:40,865
What's the shortest shortcut home?

387
00:25:40,937 --> 00:25:44,236
I believe... that way is a good way.

388
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:46,241
[all] Run!

389
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:48,300
[all gibber]

390
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,338
AIthough, this way could be better.

391
00:25:52,415 --> 00:25:54,178
[Tigger] Give me a break!

392
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,775
- If not over here.
- [all scream]

393
00:25:59,088 --> 00:26:04,253
AIthough... [chuckles] there
might be particularly pleasant as well.

394
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:06,352
[all gibber]

395
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,154
Stop it!

396
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:12,633
We're getting nowhere fast, Pooh,
and that just won't do.

397
00:26:12,702 --> 00:26:16,536
A Ieader must be someone Ieaderly,
quick-thinking, informed.

398
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:17,595
Someone Iike...

399
00:26:18,841 --> 00:26:21,275
- me.
- [Iouder growling]

400
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:25,246
Well,... there.

401
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:28,750
Anyone with half a set of smarts
can see we Iose the beast

402
00:26:28,818 --> 00:26:31,719
by cutting across this Iovely meadow.

403
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:33,779
[squawking]

404
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,121
And a Iovely meadow it is.

405
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:41,193
[gasps] Why, Iook.

406
00:26:41,264 --> 00:26:44,392
Is that a golden dahlia-daffodilus?

407
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:46,731
Rare for this Iocation.

408
00:26:48,471 --> 00:26:52,908
What exactly is this Iocation, Rabbit?

409
00:26:52,975 --> 00:26:57,639
And might it be nearer Christopher Robin
than farther?

410
00:26:57,713 --> 00:27:01,843
Why, we're right here,
on course, of course.

411
00:27:01,918 --> 00:27:03,943
Where else w-would we be?

412
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,011
[squawking]

413
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:10,487
Owl, where are we?

414
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,155
"Nice peeceful spot!" Ha! Indeed!

415
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:19,595
[ping]

416
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:23,937
- [ping]
- Oh, d-d-dear.

417
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:27,669
This is not the place for a small
and frightfully fearful animal...

418
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:29,878
such as myself.

419
00:27:29,946 --> 00:27:31,937
Or myself.

420
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:34,806
Or himself.

421
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:37,045
Thanks for noticing.

422
00:27:37,954 --> 00:27:40,946
Yes, well, uh,
precisely why I chose it.

423
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:44,652
No skullasauruses would dare
follow us in here. [chuckles]

424
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:47,025
[distant growling]

425
00:27:47,096 --> 00:27:49,291
[screams]

426
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:51,458
Piglet! Come back!

427
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:54,025
I can't Iose you, too.

428
00:28:35,478 --> 00:28:37,070
[butterfly squeaks]

429
00:28:40,016 --> 00:28:42,007
[Piglet giggles]

430
00:28:43,085 --> 00:28:45,679
- [butterfly squeaks]
- [Pooh] Oh, my, my.

431
00:28:45,755 --> 00:28:49,521
I believe you've made a friend, Piglet.

432
00:28:49,592 --> 00:28:52,390
[chuckles] I believe you're right, Pooh.

433
00:28:52,461 --> 00:28:54,861
[butterfly squeaks]

434
00:28:59,135 --> 00:29:00,397
[whistles]

435
00:29:03,706 --> 00:29:05,139
[butterflies squeak]

436
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:07,675
And another, it seems.

437
00:29:08,477 --> 00:29:10,445
And also that one.

438
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:13,914
And that one, too,... as well.

439
00:29:13,983 --> 00:29:15,746
And he, or her.

440
00:29:15,818 --> 00:29:17,376
And her, and him.

441
00:29:17,453 --> 00:29:19,887
And they, and them.

442
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,758
Face it, Piglet, old pal,
you're just plain popular.

443
00:29:28,831 --> 00:29:34,428
Some piglets have it,...
some donkeys don't.

444
00:29:34,503 --> 00:29:36,494
[butterflies squeak]

445
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:42,608
Why, I believe, Piglet, they want
to take you home with them.

446
00:29:42,678 --> 00:29:43,770
[chuckles]

447
00:29:43,846 --> 00:29:49,375
It's very kind of them, I'm sure,
but I already have a home.

448
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:52,513
Oh, d-d-dear.

449
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:54,419
Piglet.

450
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:59,017
Don't Ieave.

451
00:29:59,095 --> 00:30:01,461
I wouldn't if I couldn't, but I can't.

452
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,624
Jump, Piglet. We'II catch you,
Iikely as not.

453
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,965
I would if I could,
but they won't Iet me.

454
00:30:08,637 --> 00:30:13,040
Perhaps you can ask your friends
to bring you back.

455
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:15,077
Why, yes.

456
00:30:15,144 --> 00:30:17,977
But I don't know which way back is.

457
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:21,039
[chuckles] It's down here.

458
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:22,482
Look.

459
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:30,087
I'm afraid I'm too afraid to Iook.

460
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,890
Oh, if only Christopher Robin was here.

461
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:37,657
Christopher Robin.

462
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:40,628
Piglet, that's it.

463
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:44,696
He said all I have to do
is remember that you are...

464
00:30:45,374 --> 00:30:47,501
bigger than a big Ieaf...

465
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:52,038
I mean, uh,
bolder when you're not green.

466
00:30:52,114 --> 00:30:54,708
[sighs] Or...

467
00:30:54,784 --> 00:30:59,414
Is any of this making you feel
any Iess afraid, Piglet?

468
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:01,922
I'm afraid not, Pooh.

469
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:03,959
Oh, bother.

470
00:31:05,327 --> 00:31:07,420
Hm.

471
00:31:07,496 --> 00:31:11,626
How to get a piglet down
who is very... up.

472
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,691
[butterflies squeak]

473
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,478
[Pooh] Oh, bother.

474
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:28,745
E-excuse me, b-but is that you, Pooh?

475
00:31:28,818 --> 00:31:31,309
Yes, Piglet, it is.

476
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,115
Might we be coming down soon?

477
00:31:39,695 --> 00:31:41,925
I believe so, Piglet.

478
00:31:42,565 --> 00:31:44,556
Uh, how soon?

479
00:31:45,534 --> 00:31:46,796
[Pooh] Very.

480
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:48,860
[mutters]

481
00:31:48,938 --> 00:31:50,132
[shrieks]

482
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:55,268
That's throwin' your weight around,
Buddy Bear.

483
00:31:55,344 --> 00:32:00,111
Imagine, being outnumbered
by those buggy boys a zillion to one.

484
00:32:00,182 --> 00:32:02,173
What a guy.

485
00:32:05,988 --> 00:32:11,085
Brave indeed. Now if you don't mind,
Crustopher Ribbon,

486
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,927
Ristopher Crobbin,
Rustopher Crobbin, is this way.

487
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:28,009
Are you all right, Piglet?

488
00:32:28,077 --> 00:32:30,443
Yes, Pooh. Thank you.

489
00:32:32,014 --> 00:32:35,609
Saving me was very brave of you.

490
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,513
But you're brave, too, Piglet.

491
00:32:38,587 --> 00:32:40,316
Braver than...

492
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,690
something.

493
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:45,158
I am?

494
00:32:45,227 --> 00:32:47,593
Oh, what thing is that?

495
00:32:47,663 --> 00:32:50,723
I'm not sure, Piglet.

496
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,495
Oh, if only I could remember.

497
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:01,774
[narrator] This way and that way
the map led them,

498
00:33:01,844 --> 00:33:04,870
to all the places
Christopher Robin wasn't.

499
00:33:05,681 --> 00:33:08,013
But to none of the places he was.

500
00:33:10,252 --> 00:33:15,417
And still Rabbit refused to realize the
map didn't know which way it was going.

501
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:21,889
So we first head east by south,
then south by east.

502
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:25,991
Of course, minus the magnetic variation,
plus the wind drift.

503
00:33:26,068 --> 00:33:28,059
We clearly go...

504
00:33:28,837 --> 00:33:30,304
this way!

505
00:33:32,908 --> 00:33:37,072
I wonder if those
rather forbidding Iooking things

506
00:33:37,146 --> 00:33:42,846
might be the Forbidden Mountains,
where Christopher Robin is.

507
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,378
[Piglet] You're right, Pooh.

508
00:33:46,455 --> 00:33:48,719
[Tigger] You found 'em, Buddy Bear.

509
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:50,918
Excuse me.

510
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:53,757
The way to there is over here.

511
00:33:55,864 --> 00:34:01,393
But, Rabbit, isn't that them,
over there?

512
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,608
Now, which are you going to believe,

513
00:34:07,676 --> 00:34:11,043
this official map or your own eyes?

514
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:15,413
Look for yourself
and you'II see we're right on course.

515
00:34:15,484 --> 00:34:18,510
It's all right there in black and white.

516
00:34:18,587 --> 00:34:22,648
Why would anyone want to wander around
wondering which way to go

517
00:34:22,725 --> 00:34:25,455
when they have a map to follow?

518
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:29,224
# A map is not a guess
An estimation or a hunch

519
00:34:29,298 --> 00:34:33,462
# A feeling or a foolish intuition

520
00:34:33,535 --> 00:34:36,629
# A map is a dependable, unwavering

521
00:34:36,705 --> 00:34:41,870
# Inarguably accurate portrayer

522
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:45,309
# Of your position

523
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:50,507
# Never trust your ears,
your nose, your eyes

524
00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:54,022
# Putting faith in them is most unwise

525
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:57,354
# Here's a phrase you all must memorize

526
00:34:57,426 --> 00:35:02,056
# "In the printed word
is where truth lies "

527
00:35:03,532 --> 00:35:04,590
Y es, but, Rabbit...

528
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:08,194
# Never trust your tummies,
your tails or toes

529
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,603
# You can't learn a thing
from any of those

530
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:15,303
# Here's another fact I must disclose

531
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:18,938
# From the mighty pen true wisdom flows

532
00:35:19,014 --> 00:35:20,811
# If it says so

533
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:22,316
# Then it is so

534
00:35:22,384 --> 00:35:25,285
# If it is so, well, so it is

535
00:35:26,221 --> 00:35:29,452
# A thought's not fit to think
till it's printed in ink

536
00:35:29,525 --> 00:35:32,653
# Then it says so
So it is

537
00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:34,218
Y es, but I think...

538
00:35:34,296 --> 00:35:37,493
# Never trust that thing
between your ears

539
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:41,593
# Brains will get you nowhere fast
My dears

540
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,106
# Haven't had a need for mine in years

541
00:35:45,174 --> 00:35:48,701
# On the page is where the truth appears

542
00:35:48,777 --> 00:35:52,110
# If it says so
Then it is so

543
00:35:52,181 --> 00:35:55,947
# If it is so
So it is

544
00:35:56,018 --> 00:35:59,215
# A thought's not fit to think
Till it's printed in ink

545
00:35:59,288 --> 00:36:02,052
# Never differ from or doubt it

546
00:36:02,124 --> 00:36:06,288
- Bother.
- # Or go anywhere without it

547
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:08,728
# Thank goodness we've got this

548
00:36:09,898 --> 00:36:12,833
# So we don't need to fret about it

549
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:16,393
# If it says so

550
00:36:16,472 --> 00:36:18,565
# So it is #

551
00:36:21,877 --> 00:36:24,311
[shrieks] Oh, no! The map!

552
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:29,147
Get the map! With only half a map
we're... we're Iess than nowhere.

553
00:36:29,218 --> 00:36:31,209
After that map!

554
00:36:39,828 --> 00:36:41,455
I got it!

555
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,020
Don't have it.

556
00:36:43,098 --> 00:36:44,190
I had it!

557
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:45,597
I don't have it now.

558
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:48,932
I want it again. I got it!
I ain't got it. I don't have it.

559
00:36:49,004 --> 00:36:51,837
I got it! Wait, I'II get it...
No! I don't... I have it!

560
00:37:00,816 --> 00:37:02,340
Hmm.

561
00:37:03,485 --> 00:37:06,318
I wonder what's causing
this tail to fail.

562
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,291
Maybe it just doesn't
have what it takes.

563
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,351
[creaking]

564
00:37:14,663 --> 00:37:16,528
Yikes!

565
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:21,493
Christopher Robin!

566
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:34,010
Tigger, of all the safer places to be...

567
00:37:34,082 --> 00:37:36,346
I don't think this is one.

568
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:38,978
- You could fall.
- Yeah.

569
00:37:39,054 --> 00:37:41,955
Well, you know what they say.

570
00:37:42,024 --> 00:37:44,959
What doesn't bounce up
has got to fall down.

571
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:47,393
- [Iaughs]
- [creaking]

572
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:53,399
Uh... there's no time for this.
We've had too many delays.

573
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:56,495
So you just bounce out of there
this moment.

574
00:37:56,572 --> 00:38:01,407
[Iaughs] No way.
The wind isn't right.

575
00:38:01,477 --> 00:38:03,911
But there isn't any wind.

576
00:38:06,648 --> 00:38:09,208
OK, OK, you've got me. [sobs]

577
00:38:09,284 --> 00:38:12,651
The truth is... [whimpers]

578
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:17,818
my tail... just doesn't have...
enough strength.

579
00:38:17,893 --> 00:38:19,918
[sobs]

580
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:22,259
Oh. [chuckles]

581
00:38:22,331 --> 00:38:24,128
Don't worry, Tigger,

582
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:29,102
Christopher Robin said
I just have to remember you're...

583
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:31,503
taller than a beam.

584
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:34,098
Really?

585
00:38:34,743 --> 00:38:38,179
Or was it "slower than whipped cream?"

586
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:41,272
Do you feel any bouncier now?

587
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,942
Nope.

588
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:47,879
Oh... [chuckles]

589
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:52,221
Perhaps your tail just needs a hand.

590
00:38:52,294 --> 00:38:55,320
Could you... bounce up this far?

591
00:38:56,698 --> 00:38:58,495
Pooh Bear!

592
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:06,835
Ooh. How about now?

593
00:39:07,476 --> 00:39:09,637
No, no, no. Thanks for trying.

594
00:39:09,711 --> 00:39:12,942
I'm goin' out the way I came in.

595
00:39:13,015 --> 00:39:14,846
[sobs]

596
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,215
A second-rate bouncer.

Um... Uh, Tigger.

601
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:42,839
Hm?

602
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:45,971
Oh... OK.

603
00:39:53,488 --> 00:39:56,048
Look at the biceps on that bear.

604
00:39:56,124 --> 00:39:59,582
I don't deserve to dangle
from the same precipice.

What's Donkey Boy saying?

608
00:40:08,437 --> 00:40:10,803
I said "Ouch."

Yike!

Now, don't worry, Piglet, it's only me.

00:40:39,134 --> 00:40:41,125
Oh.

00:40:41,203 --> 00:40:42,465
Yike!

615
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:47,533
Now, don't worry, Piglet,
it's only Tigger and Rabbit and Eeyore.

616
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:52,577
The map! Whoo-hoo, we have it!
We can go now!

617
00:40:53,815 --> 00:40:56,409
[distant growling]

618
00:40:56,485 --> 00:41:00,080
Worry now, Piglet,
it's the skullasaurus.

619
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:24,806
I know we went over this way...
And I came across...

620
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,871
But then I... I Iost my way over...

621
00:41:26,948 --> 00:41:29,382
And if I don't... I know...

622
00:41:29,451 --> 00:41:35,219
Might you know which way
Christopher Robin is from here, Rabbit?

623
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:38,054
Uh, well... Uh, I mean the...

624
00:41:43,498 --> 00:41:45,762
There's this way, of course.

625
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:51,266
Not that it's the right way.

626
00:41:53,408 --> 00:41:56,172
We obviously want to go this way.

627
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,049
Though that way's further than farther
and nearer than not.

628
00:42:05,787 --> 00:42:08,312
AIthough we can't rule out this way.

629
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:16,560
Now, if Christopher Robin was here,
what would he say?

630
00:42:16,631 --> 00:42:18,622
Well, he'd say...

631
00:42:20,168 --> 00:42:22,762
"That Rabbit can't function
in this humidity."

632
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:26,296
"It's not his fault.
This fog isn't even on the map."

633
00:42:26,374 --> 00:42:28,808
"And that... [sobs]

634
00:42:28,877 --> 00:42:32,779
that Rabbit is just not smart enough
to know where to go

635
00:42:32,848 --> 00:42:35,681
or... what to do."

636
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:41,145
Oh. Christopher Robin says
"At a time Iike this...

637
00:42:41,223 --> 00:42:44,522
all I have to do is remember..."

638
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,455
Remember what?

639
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:52,800
I forget.

640
00:42:52,868 --> 00:42:54,859
But it's something Iike...

641
00:42:56,371 --> 00:42:58,931
you're smarter when you're pink.

642
00:43:00,242 --> 00:43:02,233
Does that help?

643
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,610
No. I don't know where we are
and where we aren't.

644
00:43:07,816 --> 00:43:10,614
And I haven't known for hours.

645
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:13,882
[sighs] I've failed us all.

646

[footsteps]

647
00:43:15,423 --> 00:43:19,052
I believe I have as well.

648
00:43:19,127 --> 00:43:21,687
Let's face it,
without Christopher Robin,

649
00:43:21,763 --> 00:43:24,926
we don't have a chance

00:57:15,863 --> 00:57:18,024
Au-contrariwise.

817
00:57:19,634 --> 00:57:22,159
Well, I guess I could try.

818
00:57:22,236 --> 00:57:24,636
If it'd make Pooh happy.

819
00:57:24,705 --> 00:57:27,469
Vewy, vewy happy.

820
00:57:28,476 --> 00:57:33,971
It's a... rather high place
for a... a very small animal.

821
00:57:34,048 --> 00:57:36,608
But I'II be brave for Pooh Bear.

822
00:57:40,921 --> 00:57:43,856
One for the money, two for the show,

823
00:57:43,924 --> 00:57:47,951
three because uh... uh...
it comes before four.

824
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:50,429
And here we go.

825
00:58:36,944 --> 00:58:38,935
[creaks]

826
00:59:14,982 --> 00:59:17,041
You did it!

827
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:19,109
[strains]

828
00:59:21,021 --> 00:59:23,182
[yells]

829
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:35,427
You know,... for a moment, I almost
thought I could hear Pooh Bear,

830
00:59:35,503 --> 00:59:37,494
cheering us on.

831
00:59:44,345 --> 00:59:46,370
Wait for me, Piglet.

832
00:59:57,024 --> 00:59:59,424
Hold on, Eeyore.

833
01:00:17,578 --> 01:00:19,739
Oh, bother.

834
01:00:19,814 --> 01:00:23,580
I believe if there is no way out...

835
01:00:23,651 --> 01:00:27,280
that I shall have to stay... in.

836
01:00:28,222 --> 01:00:33,250
With no more friends.
No more Christopher Robin.

837
01:00:34,128 --> 01:00:36,790
No more... we.

838
01:00:48,042 --> 01:00:51,910
If only I hadn't forgotten
what he asked me to remember.

839
01:00:51,979 --> 01:00:57,713
Oh, Christopher Robin,
if you just could have seen Piglet.

840
01:00:57,785 --> 01:01:00,948
He was so much braver than he believes.

841
01:01:01,021 --> 01:01:04,252
And Tigger was stronger than he seems.

842
01:01:04,325 --> 01:01:07,192
And Rabbit smarter than he thinks.

843
01:01:08,329 --> 01:01:13,460
[Christopher Robin] Even if we're apart
I'll always be with you.

844
01:01:13,534 --> 01:01:15,934
Christopher Robin?

845
01:01:16,003 --> 01:01:18,096
[Christopher Robin] Always be with you.

846
01:01:31,518 --> 01:01:33,543
[Christopher Robin] Always be with you.

847
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,285
Hmm.

848
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:41,260
It's a rather puzzlesome thing,

849
01:01:41,328 --> 01:01:45,264
but it's almost as if
you had never Ieft me.

850
01:01:46,533 --> 01:01:49,525
But that can't be, can it?

851
01:01:50,337 --> 01:01:52,498
Or can it?

852
01:01:58,746 --> 01:02:02,182
Perhaps you are here.

853
01:02:02,249 --> 01:02:07,778
So, even though we're apart...
we really are together.

854
01:02:07,855 --> 01:02:13,316
[chuckles] Then perhaps
Owl was mistaken all along.

855
01:02:14,428 --> 01:02:19,024
Perhaps the place where you are...
is not on a map.

856
01:02:21,535 --> 01:02:22,900
[chuckles]

857
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:26,872
How very nice for... us.

858
01:02:33,981 --> 01:02:35,539
[scraping]

859
01:02:56,437 --> 01:02:58,428
[thuds]

860
01:03:09,216 --> 01:03:11,081
This is it.

861
01:03:11,151 --> 01:03:13,142
[Rabbit] It's...

862
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:15,620
It's...

863
01:03:16,557 --> 01:03:17,956
It's...

864
01:03:18,025 --> 01:03:20,016
[Piglet] Christopher Robin?

865
01:03:22,529 --> 01:03:25,089
[chuckles] You made it.

866
01:03:25,165 --> 01:03:27,793
How clever of you.

867
01:03:27,868 --> 01:03:30,769
We're so very glad to see you.

868
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:31,827
Hello.

869
01:03:31,905 --> 01:03:36,604
Where have you been? I've been
searching everywhere for you.

870
01:03:36,677 --> 01:03:38,804
We've been searching for you.

871
01:03:38,879 --> 01:03:42,371
But on the way I found something else.

872
01:03:42,449 --> 01:03:44,440
That I'm brave enough.

873
01:03:44,518 --> 01:03:46,816
Feast your eyes on this.

874
01:03:46,887 --> 01:03:48,752
I'm strong enough.

875
01:03:48,822 --> 01:03:50,346
[thud]

876
01:03:50,424 --> 01:03:52,619
[Rabbit] Ahem!

877
01:03:52,693 --> 01:03:56,857
I found I'm smart enough.
Pretty smart, eh?

878
01:03:56,930 --> 01:04:01,390
Didn't have to come clear out here
to find it.

879
01:04:01,468 --> 01:04:04,528
Had it inside all along.

880
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:08,231
Of course you did.
It's just Iike I told...

881
01:04:08,308 --> 01:04:10,936
Wait! Searching for me?

882
01:04:11,011 --> 01:04:13,571
[Tigger] Why, certainly.

883
01:04:13,647 --> 01:04:15,842
To save you from Skull.

884
01:04:15,916 --> 01:04:17,349
Skull?

885
01:04:17,418 --> 01:04:19,579
[chuckles] Oh, no.

886
01:04:19,653 --> 01:04:21,644
I was at school.

887
01:04:23,357 --> 01:04:26,326
- School?
- That Owl!

888
01:04:26,393 --> 01:04:28,486
I knew skull had another "y" in it.

889
01:04:29,663 --> 01:04:35,033
But you said to worry about you
'c-c-c-cause you were going far away.

890
01:04:35,102 --> 01:04:36,899
Yeah, and you needed help.

891
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:38,733
No, no, no.

892
01:04:38,806 --> 01:04:42,867
"Don't worry about me.
I'm not going far away."

893
01:04:42,943 --> 01:04:46,242
"Just to school.
Be back this afternoon."

894
01:04:46,313 --> 01:04:48,611
"Help yourself to this honey."

895
01:04:48,682 --> 01:04:50,912
"And it Iooks Iike Pooh did."

896
01:04:54,922 --> 01:04:57,220
Where is Pooh?

897
01:04:57,291 --> 01:04:59,691
Oh, Christopher Robin.

898
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,695
The skullasaurus gobbled him up.

899
01:05:02,763 --> 01:05:05,095
- The what?
- [growling]

900
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:09,158
[all scream]

901
01:05:16,343 --> 01:05:20,302
[chuckles] That's no skullasaurus.

902
01:05:21,148 --> 01:05:24,345
There's only one thing
that makes a sound Iike that.

903
01:05:24,418 --> 01:05:29,720
The rumbly tumbly
of a hungry for honey... Pooh Bear.

904
01:05:32,426 --> 01:05:34,417
[tummy grumbles]

905
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:38,855
Now, Christopher Robin,

906
01:05:38,932 --> 01:05:42,459
I was saving this honey for you.

907
01:05:42,536 --> 01:05:47,701
But since we're together,
if I munched a small smackerel

908
01:05:47,774 --> 01:05:50,800
you'd have half, would you not?

909
01:05:53,947 --> 01:05:59,385
AIthough, to be fair to us both,
I should munch twice as much.

910
01:06:02,489 --> 01:06:06,755
But then this would only Iast...
half as Iong.

911
01:06:07,628 --> 01:06:11,587
[sighs] Oh, it's a bothersome thing
eating for two.

912
01:06:11,665 --> 01:06:13,223
[tummy grumbles]

913
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,928
When there's company of three.

914
01:06:18,505 --> 01:06:22,498
Oh! Look what someone has Ieft.

915
01:06:23,577 --> 01:06:25,568
[munches]

916
01:06:34,321 --> 01:06:36,312
[Pooh mutters]

917
01:06:37,257 --> 01:06:39,248
[knocking]

918
01:06:39,326 --> 01:06:41,726
Hm?

919
01:06:43,297 --> 01:06:45,288
[creaking]

920
01:06:54,341 --> 01:06:55,569
Oh!

921
01:06:56,343 --> 01:06:58,334
Silly old bear.

922
01:07:02,716 --> 01:07:06,675
[Pooh chuckles]
And we Iooked and Iooked.

923
01:07:06,753 --> 01:07:11,247
But every place we Iooked
was one of those places you weren't.

924
01:07:11,325 --> 01:07:14,954
And by the time we thought
to Iook where you were, well...

925
01:07:15,028 --> 01:07:17,223
Well, you... Um...

926
01:07:17,297 --> 01:07:22,030
Exc... Excuse me, Christopher Robin,

927
01:07:22,102 --> 01:07:28,063
but wasn't that a bit... um... bigger?

928
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:32,009
Yeah. And a whole Iot scarier?

929
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:38,450
Well, things can seem that way
when we're alone and afraid.

930
01:07:38,518 --> 01:07:40,577
Or so I'm told.

931
01:07:41,255 --> 01:07:43,883
But now there's nothing to be afraid of.
[chuckles]

932
01:07:43,957 --> 01:07:46,084
[shrieks]

933
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:48,525
Nothing to be afraid of at all.

934
01:07:50,163 --> 01:07:53,530
# The sky is perfectly blue

935
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,263
# The clouds are perfect too

936
01:07:57,337 --> 01:07:59,771
# And here I am with you

937
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,832
# What could be more right?

938
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:07,437
# A quest has come to an end

939
01:08:07,514 --> 01:08:10,779
# And home's around the bend

940
01:08:10,851 --> 01:08:13,786
# And here you are, my friend

941
01:08:13,854 --> 01:08:16,414
# What could be more right?

942
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:21,025
# Nothing can go wrong
If everything is right

943
01:08:21,094 --> 01:08:24,757
# And everything is right somehow

944
01:08:24,831 --> 01:08:27,857
# Nothing can go wrong
As long as everything is right

945
01:08:27,934 --> 01:08:31,631
# And everything is right right now

946
01:08:32,472 --> 01:08:33,461
[buzzing]

947
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,701
# Bees are buzzing around

948
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:39,838
# We're on familiar ground

949
01:08:39,913 --> 01:08:42,746
# And look at who we found

950
01:08:42,816 --> 01:08:44,909
# What could be more right?

951
01:08:47,354 --> 01:08:50,084
# Nothing can go wrong
If everything is right

952
01:08:50,157 --> 01:08:54,116
# And everything is right somehow

953
01:08:54,194 --> 01:08:57,061
# Nothing can go wrong
As long as everything is right

954
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:59,121
# And everything is right

955
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:00,826
T op to bottom.

956
01:09:00,901 --> 01:09:02,493
# Everything is right

957
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:04,434
Thank goodness you've got him.

958
01:09:04,504 --> 01:09:05,903
# Everything is right

959
01:09:05,972 --> 01:09:08,304
[Pooh] Perfectly.
Wonderfully. T otally.

960
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:10,240
Silly old bear.

961
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:14,041
# Right now #

962
01:09:26,259 --> 01:09:31,663
I still am not certain why you went
to this school, Christopher Robin.

963
01:09:32,532 --> 01:09:36,298
Well, I went there to Iearn things.

964
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:38,361
We Iearn things here.

965
01:09:38,438 --> 01:09:42,431
I mean things Iike...
where the sun goes at night.

966
01:09:42,509 --> 01:09:45,034
And how words are spelled.

967
01:09:45,112 --> 01:09:48,275
[sighs] And how they're not.

968
01:09:49,116 --> 01:09:52,711
[Pooh chuckles] Rabbit will be so proud.

969
01:09:55,422 --> 01:09:59,722
It's rather fun really,
in a different sort of way.

970
01:09:59,793 --> 01:10:02,887
It was scary at first.

971
01:10:02,963 --> 01:10:07,400
But then... I remembered
how brave Piglet can be.

972
01:10:07,467 --> 01:10:09,992
And that helped.

973
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:14,302
And sometimes I didn't think
I'd have the strength to go on.

974
01:10:17,711 --> 01:10:20,077
Then I thought of Tigger.

975
01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:24,743
And once I found myself
feeling very much alone.

976
01:10:24,818 --> 01:10:27,286
What did you do then?

977
01:10:29,823 --> 01:10:32,257
I... thought of you, Pooh.

978
01:10:33,093 --> 01:10:36,654
[chuckles] It's what I would have done.

979
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:41,896
Pooh Bear.

980
01:10:41,968 --> 01:10:47,235
I'm told that tomorrow
I'II be going again.

981
01:10:47,307 --> 01:10:49,036
Again?

982
01:10:49,109 --> 01:10:50,133
[groans]

983
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:52,371
Shall I find you again?

984
01:10:52,446 --> 01:10:55,438
No. I'm going to school.

985
01:10:55,515 --> 01:10:59,975
I'II be back,... as Iong as you're here.

986
01:11:01,087 --> 01:11:03,419
Promise me you'II be here.

987
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:04,957
AIways.

988
01:11:05,025 --> 01:11:07,118
Even when I'm 1 00.

989
01:11:11,364 --> 01:11:14,060
How old shall I be then?

990
01:11:14,134 --> 01:11:15,726
Ninety-nine.

991
01:11:15,802 --> 01:11:17,633
I promise.

992
01:11:17,704 --> 01:11:20,036
For ever and ever?

993
01:11:21,241 --> 01:11:23,607
Yes, Christopher Robin.

994
01:11:24,811 --> 01:11:27,905
For ever and ever.

995
01:11:34,087 --> 01:11:36,988
[narrator] And so it is here
we shall leave them.

996
01:11:37,057 --> 01:11:40,026
And here we shall find them again.

997
01:11:40,093 --> 01:11:43,859
For the boy and the bear
will always be together

998
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:49,596
in this remarkable place
called the Hundred Acre Wood.

999
01:12:07,187 --> 01:12:13,217
# Come out moon
Come out wishing star

1000
01:12:14,227 --> 01:12:17,560
# Come out, come out

1001
01:12:18,665 --> 01:12:22,260
# Wherever you are

1002
01:12:27,007 --> 01:12:32,035
# I'm out here in the dark
All alone and wide awake

1003
01:12:32,112 --> 01:12:34,740
# Come and find me

1004
01:12:37,784 --> 01:12:42,847
# I'm empty and I'm cold
And my heart's about to break

1005
01:12:42,923 --> 01:12:46,188
# Come and find me

1006
01:12:48,695 --> 01:12:53,029
# I need you to come here and find me

1007
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:58,602
# 'Cause without you I'm totally lost

1008
01:12:59,272 --> 01:13:04,437
# I've hung a wish on every star

1009
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:10,006
# It hasn't done much good so far

1010
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:14,247
# I can only dream of you

1011
01:13:16,022 --> 01:13:19,389
# Wherever you are

1012
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:28,693
# But when the morning comes
And the sun begins to rise

1013
01:13:28,768 --> 01:13:31,328
# I will lose you

1014
01:13:33,873 --> 01:13:38,810
# Because it's just a dream
When I open up my eyes

1015
01:13:38,878 --> 01:13:41,711
# I will lose you

1016
01:13:42,849 --> 01:13:47,877
# Oh, I used to believe in forever

1017
01:13:48,688 --> 01:13:52,988
# But forever's too good to be true

1018
01:13:54,461 --> 01:13:59,421
# I've hung a wish on every star

1019
01:13:59,499 --> 01:14:04,698
# It hasn 't done much good so far

1020
01:14:04,771 --> 01:14:08,468
# I can only dream of you

1021
01:14:10,944 --> 01:14:14,175
# Wherever you are

1022
01:14:22,622 --> 01:14:27,821
# I hear you laugh
I see you smile

1023
01:14:27,894 --> 01:14:30,556
# I'll be with you

1024
01:14:31,564 --> 01:14:34,590
# Just for a while

1025
01:14:35,301 --> 01:14:40,637
# Oh, I'll be there just for a while

1026
01:14:48,348 --> 01:14:51,715
# I'll come and find you

1027
01:15:01,561 --> 01:15:05,725
# I used to believe in forever

1028
01:15:06,499 --> 01:15:11,436
# But forever's too good to be true

1029
01:15:12,072 --> 01:15:17,271
# I've hung a wish on every star

1030
01:15:17,343 --> 01:15:22,508
# It hasn't done much good so far

1031
01:15:22,582 --> 01:15:25,983
# I don't know what else to do

1032
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:32,455
# Except to try to dream of you

1033
01:15:32,525 --> 01:15:38,191
# And wonder if you're dreaming too

1034
01:15:41,735 --> 01:15:44,863
# Wherever you are

1035
01:15:49,709 --> 01:15:56,342
# Wherever you are #
