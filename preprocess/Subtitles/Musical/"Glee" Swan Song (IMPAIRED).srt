1
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:01,931
Give her some room.

2
00:00:01,932 --> 00:00:03,350
She needs space! Breathe, girl, breathe!

3
00:00:03,372 --> 00:00:04,736
Does anyone have anything she can eat?

4
00:00:04,737 --> 00:00:06,777
I have some leftover
Halloween candy in my locker.

5
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:08,778
I may have a juice box.
I'll go get Marley's mom.

6
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:09,579
ARTIE:
This is bad.

7
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,535
Never in the history

8
00:00:10,553 --> 00:00:13,872
of show choir competitions
has anyone ever fainted.

9
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,201
We got the juice.
We got the juice.

10
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:17,642
No, I'm okay.
Drink the damn juice!

11
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,683
FINN: Marley? Marley, are you okay?
What happened?

12
00:00:19,684 --> 00:00:20,884
JAKE:
She hasn't been eating.

13
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:21,783
She's been skipping lunch.

14
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:22,384
Is that because

15
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:23,465
you've been telling her to?

16
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:24,346
You trying to turn her

17
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:25,717
into a damn rexy?
What?

18
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:27,415
No. Why would I...
why would I want that?

19
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,776
'Cause you're a crazy, evil bitch.

20
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:29,857
Hey, Marley, you all right?

21
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:32,978
The nurse is on the way, Mr. Schue.
Santana, Puck, you stay here with Marley.

22
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:34,619
The rest of you guys,
get back up there.

23
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,020
Leaving the stage
mid-competition,

24
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:38,221
for any reason, is risking
immediate disqualification.

25
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:39,564
What?! That-that's a rule?

26
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:40,783
SUE:
Yeah, it's a rule.

27
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:42,451
One of the bylaws, actually.

28
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:43,782
As all of you all were spiraling

29
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:46,738
into a self-created
K-hole of crazy,

30
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,173
the judges, by unanimous vote,

31
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,009
have declared the Warblers victorious.

32
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:54,639
Hey, congratulations, Finn Hudson.

33
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,000
For the first time in its charmed,

34
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:57,132
yet pitiful existence,

35
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:58,917
the New Directions!
Has lost Sectionals.

36
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:00,469
But here's the good news.

37
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,138
Christmas came early
for one Sue Sylvester.

38
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:14,415
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

39
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:16,869
That was Blaine.
They lost.

40
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:20,372
(gasps) Apparently, the new girl,
Marley, passed out on stage,

41
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:21,657
and the Warblers won.

42
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,642
Oh, my God. So, wait.
That... that's it then.

43
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:25,210
What are they going to do now?

44
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:27,296
I don't know.
I just feel bad for Blaine.

45
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,947
If he was still with the Warblers,

46
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:31,049
he'd be on his way
to Regionals right now.

47
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:34,124
You think I should call Finn? If you
think it's gonna make him feel better.

48
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,005
No. I don't, actually.

49
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:36,788
It'll probably
just make him feel worse.

50
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:37,844
Imagine coming down

51
00:01:37,845 --> 00:01:40,125
from one loss just to be
reminded of an even bigger one.

52
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:42,961
Well, our friends' feelings
aside, it's really woken me up

53
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,981
to the idea of making the most
of the chances that you have.

54
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:48,483
You know? I've got one more
chance of getting into NYADA,

55
00:01:48,518 --> 00:01:49,852
and I can't blow the audition.

56
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:51,636
It's not your last chance, okay?

57
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,856
I mean, you can still reapply.
No.

58
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:56,187
I can't live my life chasing
something that the universe

59
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:58,508
is trying to tell me that I'm
not good enough to achieve.

60
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,746
It's not the universe.
It's just Carmen Tibideaux.

61
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,980
Is there a difference?

62
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:02,768
Speaking of Carmen,

63
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:04,649
has she started passing out
her golden tickets

64
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,151
for the Winter Showcase yet?

65
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,587
No, and it doesn't matter,
because I'm not getting one.

66
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:10,873
Alexandra Blasucci was
the last freshman to get one

67
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:12,490
in the past seven years,

68
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,760
and she was practically
raised on the Broadway stage.

69
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:16,714
Wait. How do you even know
about those tickets?

70
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:18,663
I've become very active
on the NYADA blogs.

71
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,761
I figured, the more I know,

72
00:02:19,762 --> 00:02:22,042
the better I can streamline
my application and audition.

73
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:23,168
(opera music playing)

74
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:25,387
<i>The Winter Showcase</i>
<i>is like the NYADA Met Ball.</i>

75
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:27,838
<i>Ten students are invited to</i>
<i>perform at the showcase a year.</i>

76
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,007
The cream of the cream.

77
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:32,010
<i>She handwrites and</i>
<i>hand-delivers each invitation.</i>

78
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:34,062
<i>Just getting invited is an honor.</i>

79
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,364
<i>Former winners have gone on</i>

80
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:36,698
<i>to win Emmys, Tonys,</i>

81
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:38,951
<i>Golden Globes and even an Oscar.</i>

82
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:40,235
But they all agree.

83
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,454
The proudest and greatest moment
of their careers

84
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:44,573
was when Carmen handed them
that Golden Envelope.

85
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:55,167
♪

86
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:11,433
(applause)

87
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:14,519
(school bell rings)

88
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:31,503
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wha-What's
happening? What are you doing?

89
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:32,671
Hey, there, Lumps.

90
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,425
Just taking advantage
of the high ceilings

91
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:36,325
on this, my new rehearsal space.

92
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,576
It is now the home of my
brand-new French-Canadian,

93
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:42,580
circus-inspired Cheerios!
Side project, Sue du Soleil.

94
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,118
Get rid of all this sparkly red stuff.

95
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:45,929
It still smells like
the Glee Club in here.

96
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,252
What are you talking about?

97
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,753
Well, when your season ended,

98
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,088
with your loss at Sectionals,

99
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,861
I filed the appropriate paperwork

100
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:54,142
so that the Cheerios! Take
full possession of this room,

101
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,594
including everything
in it... your trophies,

102
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,931
your beloved plaque
with the late Lillian Adler.

103
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:02,701
And I took her inspirational quotation,

104
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:05,037
and I re-engraved something
for myself here.

105
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:07,605
"I died a slow, horrible death
choking on the fluid

106
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,791
in my own lungs."

107
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:13,996
You...

108
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,882
You can't do this.
Oh, I didn't do this.

109
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,051
You did this, and now
if you'll excuse me,

110
00:04:19,085 --> 00:04:21,553
I'm going to take
your Nationals trophy,

111
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:24,056
and I'm going to run
over it with my Le Car.

112
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:28,010
Over my dead body.

113
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:33,965
(grunting)

114
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,967
Figgins' office.

115
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,986
Now!

116
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:42,324
Door jam?

117
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:43,808
(school bell ringing)

118
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,327
How could you have let this happen?

119
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:46,978
It's not rocket science, Will.

120
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,581
When the football team
loses and the season is over,

121
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:52,084
they are longer entitled
to use the field!

122
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:53,651
Fine. We'll use
the auditorium.

123
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:54,836
The auditorium now belongs

124
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:56,872
to the McKinley High
Drum and Bugle Corps.

125
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:58,206
What about the Spanish Room?

126
00:04:58,257 --> 00:04:59,777
I've rented it out to the Rotary Club.

127
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:01,978
The history classroom? Sex
and Love Addicts Anonymous.

128
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,499
You're telling me that there's nowhere

129
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,420
in this school
that the Glee Club can rehearse?

130
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:07,454
That's exactly what
I'm telling you, Finn Hudson.

131
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,666
It's pure economics.

132
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:11,720
The district is running
a seven-figure deficit,

133
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:13,555
and we're sitting on prime real estate.

134
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:15,507
SUE:
Let's face facts.

135
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,008
The New Directions!
Are finished.

136
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,843
You have no place
to practice or perform.

137
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,817
The only thing left
to do is to hand over

138
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:22,898
the keys to the choir room
and inform your students

139
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:25,200
that Glee Club is over for the year.

140
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:27,354
And if that's too much
for your feeble constitution,

141
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,887
I'm happy to do it for you.

142
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,290
No.

143
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:35,710
I'll do it.

144
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,964
(school bell ringing)

145
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,083
(sighs)

146
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:42,300
How does it feel, Coach?

147
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:45,036
Got to be honest, Becky.

148
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,722
I have looked forward
to this very moment

149
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:49,641
for a long time.

150
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:51,709
Now that it's finally here,

151
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:55,714
I'm left with a strange, empty feeling.

152
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:58,650
That's how I felt
when I saw <i>Prometheus.</i>

153
00:05:58,684 --> 00:06:00,552
Now, I'd be lying if I said

154
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,604
I wasn't a little concerned
about them, Becky.

155
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,556
(sighs)

156
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:09,394
Those Glee Clubbers are
so emotionally fragile,

157
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:12,564
I can't help wonder
what this will do to them.

158
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,583
With their dreams crushed,

159
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:16,901
where and who will they be

160
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,237
in just a few short months?

161
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:21,739
I'm a drug mule
in the Lima crack district.

162
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,658
I was forced to sell my legs
to science.

163
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:25,333
I'm performing
on the bathhouse circuit.

164
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,345
I'm a finance major at Brandeis.

165
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,081
It turns out Glee Club
was really holding me back.

166
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:33,135
Oh, I wish there was some way
to assuage my guilt.

167
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:35,520
A sign that I was doing
the right thing.

168
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:37,305
(knocking)

169
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,758
Sue Sylvester?
I cannot thank you enough.

170
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:42,677
I can't tell you
how much I hate those kids!

171
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:45,090
Do you know how demeaning
it is when they just turn to you

172
00:06:45,091 --> 00:06:46,931
and yell, "Hit it!,"
and you're just supposed

173
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,600
to know what song they're gonna sing?

174
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:50,268
I'm free. Free.

175
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:52,604
(school bell ringing)

176
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:54,089
So, that's it?

177
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,874
No more Glee? Until
next September.

178
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,042
Sugar already bailed.

179
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:59,044
Can I just say
what everyone is thinking?

180
00:06:59,078 --> 00:07:00,878
This is Marley's fault.
New Rachel, my butt.

181
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,547
I knew Rachel Berry.

182
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:03,999
I was friends with Rachel Berry,

183
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,950
and you, Marley, are no Rachel Berry.
Mm-hmm.

184
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,952
Preach. FINN: Guys,
guys, enough.

185
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,362
It's not like it's over.
The holiday concert is later

186
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,123
this week, and we are
going to be preparing

187
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,391
for it all week long.

188
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:15,393
If this is our swan song,

189
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:17,629
let's make it the best one it can be.

190
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:18,904
You really expect us to go up

191
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,465
in front of the whole school and parade

192
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:21,966
our loserdom for all to see?

193
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,184
Yeah, Kitty does have a point.

194
00:07:23,185 --> 00:07:24,825
We agreed to do the show
when we thought

195
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:27,066
it would be on the heels
of another Sectionals victory.

196
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,573
Now it just feels like a pity party.

197
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:30,733
I love to sing and dance
as much as anybody,

198
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:32,694
but without a competition
to prep for, it's hard

199
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:33,578
to get motivated.

200
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:34,812
I understand that we need

201
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,239
a little shift in perspective,

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,200
but let's just enjoy this week,
and look forward

203
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:40,318
to our big comeback next year.
That's right.

204
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:42,454
What about those of us
who won't have a next year?

205
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:48,426
(school bell ringing)

206
00:08:21,504 --> 00:08:23,371
It worked.
You found me.

207
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,007
Did you lay out the
line of cereal for me?

208
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:27,208
Well, it's Tuesday, and I know

209
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:28,969
how you forget
to eat breakfast on Tuesdays

210
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,330
'cause the first few days
of the week tend to confuse you.

211
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:32,211
How did you know that?

212
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,315
You told me.

213
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,718
Is that mine? I think
maybe the reason

214
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:39,257
why Santana was always
picking on me was because

215
00:08:39,258 --> 00:08:40,538
some part of her knew the truth.

216
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:42,107
About Area 51?

217
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,226
About that I'm totally into you.

218
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:48,330
You're, uh, the only person
that really understands me.

219
00:08:48,364 --> 00:08:50,115
It's 'cause you're a genius.

220
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,066
And most people don't
understand geniuses.

221
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:54,068
Like most people
didn't appreciate Einstein

222
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:56,071
or the Spice Girls
until it was too late.

223
00:08:56,105 --> 00:08:58,072
And I think that you know that I think

224
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,926
that you are... pretty awesome.

225
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:03,345
And your impressions are amazing.

226
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:05,019
(like Elvis):
Well, thank you, Brittany.

227
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,020
(laughs) I'm super bummed

228
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:07,915
about Glee Club ending,
but I'm most sad

229
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:10,635
that I never got the chance to
do a real love song with you.

230
00:09:10,686 --> 00:09:13,021
That's why I laid out
the path of cereal...

231
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:15,089
so you could come in
here and sing with me.

232
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:17,642
Is that why the band's here?

233
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:19,644
You figured it all out.

234
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:23,865
So, will you do me the honor
of singing a ballad with me?

235
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,600
I love this song.

236

(whispers):
I can't.

262
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:30,608
Is it my lips?

263
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:33,144
No. Your lips are so
soft and horizontal.

264
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,280
I just like you too much
to put you in danger.

265
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:36,898
Santana broke up with you.

266
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:38,232
No, it's not just Santana.

267
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,068
It's, like, all the
lesbians of the nation,

268
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:42,587
and I don't know how they found out

269
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:44,122
about Santana and I dating,

270
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:46,674
but once they did, they started
sending me, like, tweets,

271
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:48,993
and Facebook messages on
Lord Tubbington's wall.

272
00:11:49,028 --> 00:11:50,228
I think it means a lot to them

273
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:52,514
to see two super-hot,
popular girls in love,

274
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:55,416
and I worry if they find
out about you and I dating,

275
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:57,802
that they'll turn on you
and get really violent

276
00:11:57,853 --> 00:12:00,588
and hurt your beautiful face and mouth.

277
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:02,473
I'm not scared of them.

278
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:06,928
I know, uh, yeah...

279
00:12:06,946 --> 00:12:08,363
Um, thanks for the song

280
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:10,315
and breakfast was great,
but I just can't.

281

Of course.

Everybody, stop.

You see, they stop the show

so that mommy can hand you a sippy cup.

I'm just...
I'm dehydrated,

298

and I've been working
my butt off in this class,

299
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:03,751
Hmm. And I have gotten better.

300
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:05,506
Three months in,
you still have no stamina

301
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:07,255
no precision, and you think

302
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:10,157
you can outperform Alexandra
Blasucci at the Showcase?

You won't even be able to keep up.

305
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:16,163
I've kept up with you.

306
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:18,216
Oh. All right.

00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:45,743
Anybody else here can

join in if they like,

320
00:13:47,212 --> 00:13:49,196

365
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:14,892
do you see what I'm saying, Schwimmer?

366
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:18,029
You're not good enough yet.

367
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:19,847
Maybe you're right.

368
00:16:19,865 --> 00:16:22,025
Yeah, I'm not-I'm not
as good of a dancer as you are.

369
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:25,736
Oh! Oh, you're finally
learning something in here.

370
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:27,572
But I'm just as good of a singer,

371
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:29,457
maybe even better.

372
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:31,576
You think anyone in here believes that?

373
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:33,744
Because there's a big difference

374
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:35,413
between self-confidence
and delusion.

375
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:37,582
No one else has to believe it.

376
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:39,467
No one but me.

377
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:41,535
But... thank you.

378
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:43,871
You actually did teach me
something, which is that

379
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:45,556
if I'm going to win this showcase,

380
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:47,925
the only way I'm gonna do it
is with my voice.

381
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:56,062
Where are we putting Scott Rudin?

382
00:16:56,873 --> 00:16:58,106
That's where you have him?

383
00:16:58,124 --> 00:16:59,491
You need to put him over here.

384
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:00,509
As a matter of fact,

385
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:01,843
you need to redo all of this.

386
00:17:01,878 --> 00:17:02,828
(knock at door)

387
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,329
Madame Tibideaux?

388
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,464
I hope it's all right

389
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:08,333
that I'm dropping by your office.

390
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:10,185
I-I'm not sure that
you, uh, remember me...

391
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:11,619
What can I do for
you, Mr. Hummel?

392
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,338
Oh, uh,

393
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:15,007
I-I applied for
the second semester...

394
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,241
I received it.
I reviewed it.

395
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:18,110
And the accompanying video?

396
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:19,645
Of you doing the acoustic version

397
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,180
of WHAM!'s "Wake Me Up
Before You Go-Go"?

398
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:24,049
What'd you think?

399
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,603
I thought exactly what I thought
the first time you auditioned

400
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:27,635
for me last Spring.

401
00:17:27,654 --> 00:17:29,637
"Here's a very talented young man

402
00:17:29,656 --> 00:17:32,307
"who knows how to sell a number,

403
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:35,310
but who is devoid
of complexity and depth."

404
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,729
What?
You gave me

405
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:38,980
surface...

406
00:17:38,998 --> 00:17:41,649
when I was looking for soul.

407
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:45,370
We are training artists
here, Mr. Hummel.

408
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:47,781
Performers who are not afraid
to show their vulnerability,

409
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:50,876
and yes, even their heart.

410
00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:53,245
Madame Tibideaux, I-I-I-I-I have
all of those things.

411
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,997
I rarely give anyone a second chance,

412
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:58,417
and when I do, it is on my terms.

413
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:01,219
Now, thank you for your
continued interest in NYADA,

414
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,505
but as you can see, I'm busy preparing

415
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,006
for the Winter Showcase.

416
00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:06,441
Good afternoon, Mr. Hummel.

417
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:13,532
(school bell rings)

418
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,401
Oh, hell no.

419
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:17,685
What happened to you?

420
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:19,664
I joined the marching band.
I'm the drum leader.

421
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,688
What happened to you?

422
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:22,214
We joined the Cheerios!

423
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:24,055
We had to do something.
It's our senior year.

424
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,170
We wanted to compete.
We want to be part of a team.

425
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,491
And Coach Sylvester just let you?

426
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:29,197
It was way easier than I thought.

427
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:30,298
I'm gonna be blunt.

428
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,217
<i>60 Minutes</i> is doing a piece on me,

429
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:34,252
and that Leslie Stahl is
gonna to bring the heat.

430
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:36,538
I could use a handsome,
non-flammable gay

431
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:39,091
to articulate how my defeating
the Glee Club once and for all

432
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:40,559
and absorbing its budget

433
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:42,877
was actually the best thing
that ever happened to him.

434
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:44,879
And my squad's looking
a little pale these days.

435
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:47,716
Wouldn't hurt to add
a dash of Yellow ♪4

436
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,384
to my championship cheer batter.

437
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,867
I get what you're saying.

438
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:53,428
It's weird to suddenly feel like
you're not a part of anything.

439
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:55,109
That's why we joined
the basketball team.

440
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,390
Oh, no,

441
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:57,111
that's why you joined
the basketball team.

442
00:18:57,145 --> 00:18:59,585
I joined the basketball team
because I'm good at basketball.

443
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:01,696
Uh...

444
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:05,567
That's right.

445
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:08,120
Uh-huh.

446
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:10,905
I joined the McKinley
Floor Hockey Team.

447
00:19:10,923 --> 00:19:12,843
And when I slip a wig
underneath the face mask,

448
00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:13,959
nobody will be the wiser.

449
00:19:13,993 --> 00:19:15,410
Hallelu.

450
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:16,988
Who knew this school had so many clubs?

451
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,894
I joined the Interfaith
Paintball League,

452
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:20,415
where Christians, Jews and Muslims can

453
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:22,750
shoot at each other safely.

454
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:24,469
(spattering)

455
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:31,868
Well, it looks like we've
all sort of moved on,

456
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:34,429
which just leaves one question:
When are we going to tell Finn?

457
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,032
(school bell rings)

458
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:40,435
I can't believe it's been,
like, what, two days,

459
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,937
that you've all gone
in completely separate,

460
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:44,322
and totally insane, directions.

461
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:46,274
We lost Sectionals.

462
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:47,275
Our season is over.

463
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:48,853
You can't be upset that we've moved on.

464
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,031
It's the healthy thing to do.

465
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:50,629
Is it really?

466
00:19:50,663 --> 00:19:51,830
Is it the healthy thing to do

467
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:53,281
to take orders from Sue Sylvester

468
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:55,000
for the rest of the school year?

469
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:56,001
And Artie, man,

470
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:57,219
you basically dragged me

471
00:19:57,253 --> 00:19:59,454
out of the tire shop,
telling me that this club was

472
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:00,722
part of my destiny somehow.

473
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:01,956
What did you even join?

474
00:20:01,974 --> 00:20:03,725
Your costume is ridiculous.

475
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,510
I looks like a peacock
died on your head.

476
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:06,378
It's called a plume.

477
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:07,423
Whatever! Okay, look,

478
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:09,064
I-I'm not going to waste
all six minutes

479
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:10,545
I was able to book the auditorium for

480
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:11,449
yelling at you guys.

481
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:12,951
Six minutes?
Yeah.

482
00:20:12,985 --> 00:20:14,129
Emperor Sylvester swooped in

483
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,970
and carved the reservation
hours into tenths.

484
00:20:15,988 --> 00:20:18,139
So the only other time
I was able to get

485
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:20,225
was 9:54, Friday night,

486
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:22,577
and I'll be here ready to rehearse,

487
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,396
and I hope you will, too.

488
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,380
'Cause if you don't,

489
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:26,581
I think you're going to regret

490
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,867
missing that opportunity
for the rest of your lives.

491
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:29,868
I'll definitely be here.

492
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,536
Yeah, well, we'd all be here

493
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:33,655
if you hadn't face-planted
at Sectionals.

494
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:34,923
Tina, enough.

495
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,437
(speaking quietly)

496
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,788
(light switches clicking, clanking)

497
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:10,575
(school bell rings)

498
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,127
Hey.
Oh.

499
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:14,281
Can I ask you a question?
Oh, <i>The Walking Dead</i> isn't

500
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:15,962
based on a true story.
I already checked.

501
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:18,366
That's not what I was
gonna ask, but, oh.

502
00:21:18,384 --> 00:21:19,718
No, thanks.

503
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:21,052
Are you planning on going

504
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:23,054
to the holiday concert
rehearsal on Friday?

505
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:25,056
Why?

506
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:26,708
Well, I pulled some strings

507
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:30,362
and I got us reservation
for the VIP booth at Breadstix,

508
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:32,564
but the only time
they had available was

509
00:21:32,598 --> 00:21:35,133
for the same time as rehearsal.

510
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,735
So, do you want to go?

511
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:39,821
You mean, like... on a date?

512
00:21:39,855 --> 00:21:42,991
Yeah, well, I was thinking
about what Finn said

513
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:44,910
about last chances,
Mm-hmm.

514
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:47,262
And how everyone's
joining all these clubs

515
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:48,914
because they don't want to miss out,

516
00:21:48,948 --> 00:21:53,585
and the truth is, is that
ever since Santana left,

517
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:55,654
you're the only person
that makes me smile.

518
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:57,455
I am pretty
non-stop hilarious.

519
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,660
You make me happy, Sam,

520
00:22:01,694 --> 00:22:03,762
And I don't want to waste any more time

521
00:22:03,796 --> 00:22:05,480
not smiling at your hilariousness.

522
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:11,315
What about the lesbian
blogger community?

523
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:12,437
They're not gonna like it,

524
00:22:12,471 --> 00:22:14,189
but the way I figure is that

525
00:22:14,223 --> 00:22:15,473
they know they're my sisters

526
00:22:15,524 --> 00:22:16,950
and love is love.

527
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,323
(like Forrest Gump): I may not be a
smart man, but I know what love is.

528
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,422
(chamber orchestra tuning up)

00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:47,263
(instruments quiet)

530
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:50,600
Welcome to the New York
Academy of Dramatic Arts'

531
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:53,269
annual Winter Showcase.

532
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:55,755
While this is a competition,

533
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:58,090
it is also a celebration.

534
00:22:58,108 --> 00:23:01,194
Each year, our faculty
chooses ten students

535
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:03,363
who exemplify the best

536
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:05,598
of what we are trying to achieve.

537
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:07,984
Our first performer is Alexandra.

538
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:09,452
Blasucci.

539
00:23:09,486 --> 00:23:12,772
She will be doing Delibes' <i>Sylvia</i>

540
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,492
with variations
by Sir Frederick Ashton.

541
00:23:16,543 --> 00:23:18,544
(applause)

542
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:27,971
(orchestra playing lively,
dramatic selection from <i>Sylvia</i> )

543
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:32,976
Hey.

544
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,144
Hey. Hi.

545
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,630
You're nervous.

546
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:39,732
I was, too, at my first showcase.

547
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:41,748
Just... remember what I said

548
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:43,069
when we first met...
you're here

549
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:44,604
because you're the best of the best.

550
00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:47,139
What?
Well, that's very sweet.

551
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:48,357
That was a very good pep talk.

552
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,158
I don't know.

553
00:23:49,193 --> 00:23:50,810
I feel like I...
like I got this.

554
00:23:50,828 --> 00:23:51,861
You know?

555
00:23:52,947 --> 00:23:55,498
Look, I-I know I may not be a...

556
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:57,417
like, a typical beauty, and...

557
00:23:57,451 --> 00:24:00,086
no one's gonna ever pay me to
walk the runway on Fashion Week

558
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,656
or I'm not gonna cure cancer,
write the Great American Novel,

559
00:24:03,691 --> 00:24:06,426
but if you give me a stage to sing on,

560
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,196
I know, in my gut, that there's
no one that can beat me.

561
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,548
I... can't believe
you can be so calm.

562
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,434
(chuckling):
Oh, my God... I'm terrified!

563
00:24:15,436 --> 00:24:17,603
But, um, I know who I am and I know

564
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:18,938
what I'm gonna do.

565
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:22,058
I'm just gonna go out there like...

566
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:25,061
I'm never gonna get
a chance to sing again.

567
00:24:25,112 --> 00:24:26,729
Well, I may not be able to cure

568
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,898
anything either,
but I'm smart enough to know...

569
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:31,234
never get in the way
of a woman on a mission.

570
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:32,902
So...

571
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:34,737
...break a leg.

572
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:45,131
What was that for?

573
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:47,199
I think I'm just gonna
start doing things

574
00:24:47,217 --> 00:24:49,202
like I'm never gonna
get another chance to.

575
00:24:49,236 --> 00:24:50,202
KURT:
Hey!

576
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,587
Uh, as sympathetic as I am

577
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:53,089
at this particular act
of a rom-com,

578
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,140
Rachel, you're up.

579
00:24:58,062 --> 00:25:01,731
Our next performer is
from the freshman class.

580
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:04,050
Please welcome Miss Rachel Berry.

581
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:06,102
(applause)

582
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:13,609
Hi, I'm Rachel Berry, and, um...

583
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,079
I'm just going to...
sing for you.

Rachel, that was wonderful.

653

No...

654
00:31:00,507 --> 00:31:02,241
it was superb.

655
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:05,010
And now we're going to have
a brief intermission,

656
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:07,463
and when we come back,
if he thinks he's ready,

657
00:31:07,514 --> 00:31:08,964
we'll have a performance...

658
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:10,549
from Mr. Hummel.

659
00:31:18,425 --> 00:31:20,524
Carmen Tibideaux is an insane person.

660
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:21,285
Asking me to sing

661
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:22,766
in front of the entire NYADA faculty?

662
00:31:22,817 --> 00:31:23,934
And all those theatrical

663
00:31:23,985 --> 00:31:26,103
luminaries? I mean,
why would she do that?

664
00:31:26,154 --> 00:31:28,194
She's giving you a second chance
at your audition.

665
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,380
She just wants to see how
you perform under pressure.

666
00:31:30,381 --> 00:31:32,359
I'm gonna fail,
that's what's gonna happen.

667
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:34,828
Uh... I have nothing prepared.
Oh, my God.

668
00:31:34,863 --> 00:31:36,413
You have an entire repertoire.

669
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:39,283
I guess I could do "Wishing
You Were Somehow Here Again"?

670
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:40,894
No <i>Phantom,</i> not in front of this crowd.

671
00:31:40,902 --> 00:31:43,203
"With One Look"?
<i>Sunset Boulevard?</i> Same thing.

672
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:45,255
(sighs) "Being Alive"?

673
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,924
Yes.

674
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,675
Oh, my God, I just got chills.

675
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,470
That's perfect!
There's only one problem...

676
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:52,296
I think that's a song that Carmen hates

677
00:31:52,347 --> 00:31:54,548
and I can't do it
without a costume or props!

678
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:56,183
You don't need any of that stuff!

679
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:57,817
Yes, I do.
You know that I'm at my best

680
00:31:57,818 --> 00:31:59,538
when I have my careful
assortment of bells

681
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:02,806
and whistles, like steel
scaffolding or my gold lamé pants.

682
00:32:02,857 --> 00:32:04,141
Kurt.

683
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:05,776
You said it yourself...

684
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:09,196
that is exactly what Carmen
does not want to see.

685
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:13,617
You know when you were
your absolute best?

686
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:15,369
My favorite performance ever?

687
00:32:15,403 --> 00:32:17,871
When you sang "I Want to Hold
Your Hand" in the choir room.

688
00:32:17,906 --> 00:32:19,573
It was so...

689
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:20,657
just simple

690
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,327
and emotional and...
I don't know, I...

691
00:32:23,378 --> 00:32:25,629
I get chills every time
I think about it.

692
00:32:25,663 --> 00:32:26,964
Do you remember that?

693
00:32:26,998 --> 00:32:28,048
(sighs)

694
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:29,800
Of course I do.

695
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:32,114
But things were different...
my dad was in the hospital.

696
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:33,503
I dedicated it to him.

697
00:32:33,554 --> 00:32:35,722
Who am I supposed
to dedicate this to? Carmen?

698
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:37,624
To yourself.

699
00:32:40,345 --> 00:32:42,930
(applause)

00:32:42,964 --> 00:32:44,965

Uh, uh...

701
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:53,273
Hi. Um...

702
00:32:53,308 --> 00:32:54,741
I'm Kurt Hummel,

703
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:57,277
and I'll be auditioning
for the role of...

704
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:58,528
NYADA student.

705
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:01,448
Tonight I am going to perform a song

706
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:03,417
that I've loved since I was six.

707
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:05,118
But, um...

708
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:08,121
I think for the
first time in my life, I...

709
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:11,157
finally understand what it means.

00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:40,954
Rachel, it's Finn.
You butt-dialed me again.

743
00:36:40,972 --> 00:36:43,336
Oh, I... I didn't...
I didn't butt-dial you.

744
00:36:43,371 --> 00:36:44,672
I just, um...

745
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:47,474
I wanted to hear your voice.

746
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:49,476
Especially after...

747
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:51,512
Hearing we lost?

748
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:52,846
That everyone's giving up

749
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:53,647
and moving on?

750
00:36:53,682 --> 00:36:55,149
It's over.

751
00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:56,817
We're done competing for the year.

752
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:59,270
Finn, Glee Club isn't
just about competing.

753
00:36:59,321 --> 00:37:01,272
You kidding me?
You live to compete.

754
00:37:01,323 --> 00:37:03,324
Kurt told me
you were competing tonight.

755
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:06,410
How'd it go?

756
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:11,165
I won.

757
00:37:14,669 --> 00:37:16,620
Great.

758
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:18,706
That's...

759
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,842
Wow, uh... congratulations.

760
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:25,179
Finn, listen to me.

761
00:37:25,213 --> 00:37:29,216
You know, even if we...
we never won our Sectionals,

762
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,536
or Nationals had never happened...

763
00:37:32,571 --> 00:37:36,390
it still would have been worth it.

764
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:38,392
I mean, Glee... it's...

765
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:40,561
it's about the love of music.

766
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:44,698
It's about people like Puck and Artie

767
00:37:44,733 --> 00:37:47,934
not just singing together,
but actually being friends.

768
00:37:47,953 --> 00:37:50,771
And Brittany and Mike dancing
just for fun

769
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:52,790
when no one else is around.

770
00:37:54,726 --> 00:37:57,944
It's even about the romances.

771
00:37:57,963 --> 00:38:00,581
You know, they come and go, but...

772
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:02,616
they're just as important.

773
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:13,093
Look, those kids...
they respect you so much.

774
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:15,095
And they look up to you, so...

775
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:17,431
don't let them give up on their dreams.

776
00:38:17,465 --> 00:38:19,433
Okay?

777
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:21,585
Promise me one thing.

778
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,555
Don't give up on yours.

779
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:28,409
Okay?

780
00:38:28,443 --> 00:38:30,444

No one else is coming, are they?

783
00:38:59,024 --> 00:39:01,208
I don't think so.

784
00:39:03,111 --> 00:39:06,730
I had some good news for us, but
maybe it doesn't matter anymore.

785
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:09,099
I found a place where
Glee Club can practice.

786
00:39:09,134 --> 00:39:10,901
It's not great, but

787
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:13,370
I know for a fact
that no one can kick us out.
