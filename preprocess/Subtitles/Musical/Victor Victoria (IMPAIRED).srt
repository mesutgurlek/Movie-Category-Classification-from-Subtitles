This is All they have.

337
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,370
This? Last time I saw
a specimen like this,

338
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,455
they had to shoot the horse.

339
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,624
How lucky can you get?

340
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,002
In one evening, a Rockefeller

341
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,712
and a Groucho Marx.

342
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,047
They didn't shoot a real horse.

343
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,383
Just a costume
with two waiters in it.

344
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,052
I shall think of a sharp retort

345
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,054
while I'm getting
your roast chicken.

346
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,891
It's a wise man who knows
when to throw in the towel.

347
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,476
And it is a moron
who gives advice

348
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,145
to a horse's ass.

349
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,775
Ha ha ha ha!

350
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,950
I made the dressing myself

351
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,411
with the last of the rose.

352
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,038
I'll bet it's delicious.

353
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,414
I wouldn't bet on it.

354
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,082
Go on, try it.

355
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,852
I think I'll wait till

Oh, I want to.

You will be the first to know.

360

Oh, that's lovely.

363
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,935
But it's my cockroach
in my purse,

364
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,020
and I have to get it
into my salad.

365
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,689
I'm perfectly willing
to take over your salad.

366
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,275
You can just slip me
the purse under the table.

367
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,276
Listen, you hate cockroaches

368
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,486

what if I manage and you faint?

370
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,240
Then it's possible
I shall wake up in prison.

371

Then I can't talk you out of it?

You don't have time.

373

No. I was, um,

We would like another
bottle of wine.

I don't believe it.

Are you impugning
this lady's integrity?

She's impugning my salad.

Oh, no, no, no.

it wasn't your fault

your salad had
a cockroach in it.

It didn't, and it wasn't.

I demand to see the manager.

Yes, sir.

00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:21,339
This lady found
a cockroach in her salad.

So I gather.

Well, what are you
going to do about it?

402

I'm going to apologize.

403
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,680
Madame, I regret that you found

404
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,515
a cockroach in your salad.

405
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,976
I can assure you
that in the five years

406
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,519
I've been running
this restaurant,

407
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,521
there have only been
two other occasions

408
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:37,939
when customers complained

409
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,525
of having found insects
in their food.

410
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,027
You see?
It's happened before.

411
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,445
On both occasions,

412
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,155
it turned out that the customers

413
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,325
had actually put the
insects in their food,

414
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,160
hoping to blackmail
the restaurant

415
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,163
and thus avoid having
to pay their checks.

416
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,622
Uh-huh.

417
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,708
Surely you're not suggesting...

418
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:57,917
that madame is trying

419
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:58,710
to avoid paying her check?

420
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,045
Well, of course not,

421
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,297
and as a manager
of this restaurant,

422
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,132
I hope madame accepts my apology

423
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,383
for any inconvenience

424
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,385
she may have been caused.

Thank you.
Ma... madame does.

Now, that is what I
have done about it.

to do about it?

of your check.

My check?

438
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:30,033
that since this

you don't feel
that you should pay

for his dinner, either?

441
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,348
I would say that
under the circumstances

that's the only
logical conclusion available.

I will tell you what
I consider to be

444
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,213
the only logical
conclusion available.

That's a woman's argument.

Your problem,
Mr. Marchand,

1008
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,263
is that you're preoccupied

any kind of future,

1826

Yes.

I wouldn't have a job.

1835

Uh-huh.
While we're living

1836

and sleeping together,

1837
01:39:33,843 --> 01:39:35,302
what's everybody going to think?

1838
01:39:35,511 --> 01:39:36,887
I guess they're going to
think that you're living

1839
01:39:37,096 --> 01:39:38,263
and sleeping with a man.

1840

How do you feel about that?

1841
01:39:40,141 --> 01:39:42,267
Well, they're going to think
the same thing about me.

1842

But you're a woman!

Yeah, but they don't know that.

You do!

1845
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:48,273
And you know you're a man!

1846
01:39:48,483 --> 01:39:49,942
I don't see the difference.

1847
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:52,277
We'd be living a damn lie.

bothering you.

If you think I'm worried

1851

1852

1853
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:04,164
So we have a problem.

1854
01:40:04,374 --> 01:40:05,791
I guess we have.

1855
01:40:12,465 --> 01:40:14,508
Well, it's probably
for the best.

1856
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:16,510
That's as bad

1857

as "love is
a two-way street."

it makes up for in prophecy.

1860
01:40:26,813 --> 01:40:29,064
Sooner or later,
I'd probably ask you

1861
01:40:29,273 --> 01:40:32,025
to stop being a gangster
because I was worried

1862
01:40:32,235 --> 01:40:34,611
about everyone thinking
I was your moll.

1863

I am not a gangster.

1864

with a bodyguard.

is soon out of business.

1869
01:40:43,997 --> 01:40:46,456
A businessman who does
business with gangsters

1870

and pretends he's not a gangster

1871
01:40:48,668 --> 01:40:50,836
sounds a lot like
the kind of act I do.

1872
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:54,840
I think we're both pretenders,

1873
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:57,467
and that's not a very good basis

1874
