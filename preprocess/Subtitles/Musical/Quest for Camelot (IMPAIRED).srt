ARTHUR: I may not survive.
GARRETT: Kayley, no!

1157

ARTHUR: But you'll never destroy...

...the ideals of Camelot.

1159

Well, I've got to start somewhere.

1160
01:12:19,923 --> 01:12:22,009
Say hello to your new king.

1161
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:25,012
You're no king.

1162
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:27,097
You're right.

1163
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:28,682
Perhaps I'm...

1164
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:31,018
...more of a god.

1165
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:34,271
Hey, Ruber!

1166
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:35,564
You!

1167
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:38,150
I will not serve a false king.

You're in the way, just like your father.

1171
01:13:11,558 --> 01:13:13,352
Since you're dying...

1172
01:13:14,186 --> 01:13:15,938
...to be like him...

You probably needed that.

RUBER: Where is your pigeon now?

1178
01:13:38,919 --> 01:13:42,005
Hold your ground
until the last possible moment.

1179
01:13:42,589 --> 01:13:45,133
GARRETT: Yes, and you give the signal.

1180
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:47,219
Two for the price of one.

You forgot this.

JULIANA: [Whispers] Take it, it's yours.

You have reminded us
that a kingdom's strength...

1198
01:15:38,664 --> 01:15:41,124
...is not based on the strength of the king...

1199
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:43,252
...but the strength of the people.

1200

From this day forward...

1201
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:48,340

as Knights of the Round Table.

Well done, Ayden.
