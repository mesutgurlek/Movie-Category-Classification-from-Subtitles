1
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,514
THE BAND WAGON

2
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,868
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in luck today here in Los Angeles.

3
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,435
Through the years,
the Bullwinkle Galleries...

4
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,158
have brought up for auction...

5
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,279
many collections of the personal effects
of your famous movie stars.

6
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,395
AUCTION SALE

7
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,597
But today is indeed a red-letter day.

8
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,433
The personal effects of Tony Hunter!

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,915
Lot 94.

10
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,789
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's start out with Lot 94.

11
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,678
Some of the potpourri
of Mr. Hunter's own personal costumes...

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,476
that he used in his famous
dancing-singing pictures.

13
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,672
Remember this?
Perhaps the most famous top hat...

14
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,591
and stick of our generation.

15
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,434
 Yes, the one he used
in Swinging Down to Panama... 

16
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,556
and all his other famous pictures.

17
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,390
Let's start with $5. Do I hear $5?

18
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,751
It's worth a lot more.

19
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,390
All right. Let's start with $2.

20
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,832
Well? 50 cents?

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,028
Anything?

22
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,477
Just one more for the road.
About 20 minutes to New York.

23
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,834
Bottoms up.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,719
- So you're from California?
- That's right. Sunny Cal.

25
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,109
- Sunny Cal?
- Yeah. Sunny Cal.

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,949
Say, you're from Sunny Cal. I bet
you know a lot of movie stars out there.

27
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,190
I got to confess. I'm just like you and me.

28
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,589
Only get to see them in the movies.

29
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,194
But I read about them.
I know all about them.

30
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,153
Boy, I'd sure like to meet
that Ava Gardner.

31
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,034
- You're a little late. She's married.
- Yeah.

32
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,351
- You know this one?
- Who's that?

33
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,512
- Tony Hunter.
- Oh, him. The singing-dancing fella.

34
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,673
My wife used to go see all his pictures.
Almost broke up our home.

35
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,751
"Tony Hunter! Tony Hunter!"

36
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,071
He was good 12 or 15 years ago...

37
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,355
but the columnists out there
say he's through.

38
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,630
Through? He's washed up.
Hasn't made a picture in three years.

39
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,678
- Did you say something, mister?
- I said I agreed with you.

40
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,273
That Tony Hunter's a has-been.

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,032
- Got a match?
- Yeah.

42
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,079
I wouldn't go to see him
if they gave away $5 bills with the ticket.

43
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,829
Yeah.

44
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,751
We should be pulling...

45
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,551
The funny thing about what you're saying,
boys, is that it's absolutely true.

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,149
Here. Have an exploding cigar.

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,630
- This the last of the bags, Mr. Hunter?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,518
Say, porter, could you see that
they get put in a taxi...

49
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,513
- and taken up to the Plaza Hotel?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

50
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,038
Everybody's getting off, sir.

51
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,351
If you don't mind,
I'll just sit for a minute or two.

52
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,512
You couldn't just make up my berth
for the night here, could you?

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,636
No, sir. I couldn't do that.

54
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,513
There's a mob of reporters
and photographers out there.

55
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,672
Yep. There must be some big shot aboard.
Maybe the President.

56
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,752
No, too many for that.
Probably a movie star.

57
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,428
- Hi, fellas.
- Tony Hunter! Hello, Mr. Hunter!

58
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,228
Thanks for the red-carpet bit.
I didn't expect it.

59
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,517
- What brings you to New York?
- Just fooling around and relaxing.

60
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,750
- Between pictures, Tony?
- In a manner of speaking.

61
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,718
 Didn't I read something in Variety
about you going into a show? 

62
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,190
Lily and Les Marton had something
planned for me. I haven't decided yet.

63
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,159
I haven't been on the stage in a long time.
And you get into a different medium.

64
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,196
- What it actually is...
- Here she is, fellas!

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,191
- Excuse me, Mr. Hunter.
- See you later, Tony.

66
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,269
Hi, Miss Gardner.

67
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,669
Miss Gardner, hold it, please?
Smile pretty. Thanks.

68
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,275
- How long you going to be in town?
- I have no definite plans. I thought...

69
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,749
Tony! I had no idea you were on the train.

70
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,796
This is a surprise.
You going to be here long?

71
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,110
- Perhaps a week or two...
- Excuse me, Miss Gardner.

72
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,919
Could the boys get one more shot of you
coming out the door?

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,560
Honestly, isn't all this stuff an awful bore?

74
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,631
- Good to see you, Tony.
- It's nice to see you.

75
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,429
By the door, please, Miss Gardner.
Once more! Here we go! Thank you.

76
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,308
Miss Gardner, my paper would like
to do a Sunday feature on you.

77
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,996
Those poor movie stars. People just
won't let them alone, will they?

78
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,435
No. I don't know how they stand it.

79
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,072
 I'll go my way by myself 

80
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,796
 like walking under the clouds 

81
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,633
 I'll go my way by myself 

82
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,116
 all alone in a crowd 

83
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,034
 I'll try to apply myself 

84
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,351
 and teach my heart how to sing 

85
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,274
 I'll go my way by myself 

86
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,795
 like a bird on the wing 

87
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,349
 I'll face the unknown 

88
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,639
 I'll build a world of my own 

89
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,078
 No one knows better than I, myself 

90
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,709
 I'm by myself alone 

91
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,598
Tony Hunter! There's Tony Hunter!

92
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,871
HI TONY - WELCOME TONY
TONY HUNTER FAN CLUB

93
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,270
Did you kids paint those signs just for me?

94
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,351
That's cute. Piggy.

95
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,078
Let's get rid of this stuff.

96
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,955
This is the biggest surprise I've had.

97
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,635
- Mister, can I have your autograph?
- You certainly can, gal, come here!

98
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,073
That's my wife. Let go.

99
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,435
Don't worry.
I'll get around to you in a minute.

100
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,397
- Who's he?
- Never saw him before in my life.

101
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,233
- Hello, piggy!
- Hello, yourself, you two-headed creep!

102
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,958
Why didn't you say
when you were coming?

103
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,268
We had to ask your agent.

104
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,193
- Why didn't you send us a wire?
- I wanted to sneak in quietly.

105
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,193
Believe me, I didn't have any trouble.
I want to see if you've changed in a year.

106
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,556
No, Les, you haven't changed a bit.
You look desperately ill, as usual.

107
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,790
- What'd you have to say that for?
- Just kidding.

108
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,313
I've been feeling terrible all day.

109
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,518
Kind of faint, light-headed,
a lot of pressure here, queasy inside...

110
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,079
- my pulse...
- You look great.

111
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,675
As for you, that New York pallor
is like a breath of fresh air.

112
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,799
You're too pretty to be a successful writer
and much too pretty to be married to that.

113
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,996
That's the prettiest compliment
I've had all day!

114
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,753
Come on, you two-headed lovebirds,
there's work to be done!

115
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,196
- Now I have here a script of a show!
- Les, you didn't bring it.

116
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,555
It's great. It's the best thing
we've ever written.

117
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,949
Take it, boy. Smell it!
You can tell it's good.

118
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,873
There's a great part in it for you,
nice little parts for us.

119
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,633
Wait. This boy must be starving.
Let's take him to Sardi's.

120
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,431
Only two blocks more, then Sardi's.

121
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,398
- Shall we tell him, Lil, the big surprise?
- You tell him, Les.

122
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,471
Who do you think is going to do the show?

123
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,519
Only the greatest director /producer
in town, Jeffrey Cordova.

124
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,551
- Who?
- Jeff Cordova.

125
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,313
We're meeting him tonight, backstage,
right after the show.

126
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,914
- What did you say his name was?
- Jeffrey Cordova!

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,149
You're not serious.

128
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,390
I don't think he ever heard of this fella.

129
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,358
What's the matter? Don't you
get newspapers back in California?

130
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,795
 This genius directed Man in a Mousetrap... 

131
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,192
 The Lost Nymph, and did them both
while starring in Oedipus Rex. 

132
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,078
He's got three hits running,
and he's starring in one of them.

133
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,149
Only one?

134
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,119
This fella's fabulous, phenomenal,
fantastic! He can do anything.

135
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,918
Has he ever directed a musical?

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,991
What's the difference? He can do anything.

137
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,992
He's theatre.
He's a new kind of theatre man, Tony.

138
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,355
The theatre’s changed.
Lots of things have changed.

139
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,919
They certainly have.

140
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,395
What's happened to 42nd Street?

141
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,750
I just can't get over it.
I just can't understand it.

142
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,316
This used to be the great theatre street
of the town. The New Amsterdam.

143
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,278
I had one of my biggest successes there.
Ran a year and a half.

144
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,272
 Noel Coward and Gertie
were here in Private Lives in the Selwyn. 

145
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,794
Strictly carriage trade,
nothing but the finest.

146
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,078
First show I ever did was at the Eltinge,
and I don't believe that's here anymore.

147
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,635
What's the matter?

148
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,314
- I think he broke my leg.
- Can you put your weight on it?

149
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,470
- I'll try.
- I'm sorry, fella! I didn't mean it.

150
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,755
- Okay, forget it.
- Let's get him a cab.

151
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,114
Taxi!

152
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,553
Here, let me carry you.

153
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,076
My dear man, it's entirely my fault
and I apologize.

154
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,559
Here's for your trouble.

155
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,908
Lean on me.

156
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,478
- I can stand anything but pain.
- You'll be all right.

157
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,473
It's swelling. I'm getting a haematoma.
The blood is spurting out.

158
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,430
I want some cold compresses!
Not hot, but cold.

159
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,795
Listen, you go over to Sardi's.
I'll see you later.

160
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,757
Driver, take them on over.
Order me a steak.

161
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,159
I'll see you in a few minutes.

Excuse me.

164
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,750
I'm just a little bit fuzzy.
Wasn't this formerly the Eltinge theatre?

165
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,916
What are you doing in there?

183
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,875

 In such a time, indeed
you must reap doubly 

219
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,238
 with a twofold pain 

220
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,074
Kind friend, you alone are faithful to me.

221
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,759
Blind though I am...

222
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,549
I know that you are here,
and your voice is known to me.

223
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,910
Oh, man of dark deed, how did you find
the heart to blind yourself...

224
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,116
but deliver to all?

225
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,112
Apollo, friends! Apollo!

226
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,554
Come near me.
Lay your hand upon a wretched man.

227
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,872
Do not fear.

228
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,794
My plague can touch no one but me.

229
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,995
Seize me and drive me out!

230
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,356
Send me, for God's sake,
to some distant spot!

231
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,830
Conceal me! Kill me!

232
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,598
This guy is going to direct a musical?

233
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,950
This guy can do anything.

234
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,954
 Therefore plan, for to death
shall watch life's hand 

235

 and can't all happy till thee pass
the earth away 

236
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,116
Sweetie, we start on the left foot!

237
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,998
Always the left!
The whole exit depends upon...

238
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,752
Lily, darling! How are you?

239
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,193
Lester, how am I doing?

240
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,236
- Jeff, this is Tony...
- Excuse me.

241
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,796
Underneath it all, very simple.

242
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,518
Isn't he wonderful?

243
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,959
Listen. Order me
a corned-beef sandwich, will you?

244
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,555
Lean, now, no fat, no gristle.
And a cream soda and a pickle.

245
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,318
- Mr. Cordova wants a...
- Stay right here. It's all right.

246
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,709
That maniac. Honestly! Say, Hal?

247
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,870
- Yes, Miss Marton.
- The maestro wants his...

248
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,599
I know. The corned beef.
It's in his dressing room already.

249
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,749
Hal, this is Mr. Hunter.

250
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,274
- This is Hal Benton, Jeff's manager.
- Nice to meet you.

251
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,078
- I'm a great admirer of yours.
- Thank you.

252
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,391
- When did you get in town?
- I got off the train a couple of hours ago.

253
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,438
- Wasn't that curtain slower tonight?
- It was my fault. I'm sorry.

254
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,149
No, don't change it. Keep it that way.
It's wonderful. Doubles the applause.

255
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,117
- Jeff, this is Tony Hunter.
- How do you do?

256
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,749
Sorry, kids. Be with you soon as I get out
of this sackcloth and ashes...

257
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,469
Max, what happened to that amber spot?
It was way off.

258
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,913
Must have more light on me there.

259
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,116
Don't let us keep it a secret
I'm in the show.

260
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,474
- Excuse me.
- Hello, sweetheart.

261
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,232
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

262
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,074
Hal, call a full dialogue rehearsal, will you?
Friday, for the full company.

263
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,232
Sloppy diction. The original was in Greek,
but this is in English.

264
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,438
Don't let us keep it a secret it's in English.
I want to catch the matinee tomorrow...

265
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,159
 - of Man in a Mousetrap.
- Can't do. We got a drama lecture... 

266
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,878
Never mind. We'll work it out somehow.

267
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,996
Jeff, this is Tony Hunter.

268
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,911
Yeah, I know. We just met.

269
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,829
Mr. Hunter.

270
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,797
- I beg your pardon.
- I'm glad to know you.

271
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,108
So happy to meet you.

272
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,953
You have no idea
how delighted I am to see you.

273
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,951
- Delighted and thrilled.
- Thank you.

274
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,635
We need our theatre greats right here.

275
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,110
So when Lily and Lester said they were
doing a show with Tony Hunter...

276
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,031
that's all I had to know.

277
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,715
I'm dropping every other project,
and there are plenty, believe me.

278
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,752
That's wonderful, Mr. Cordova,
but all this... The classics...

279
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,273
- Do you really want to do a musical?
- Musical, musical!

280
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,114
I'm sick of these artificial barriers
between the musical and the drama.

281
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,955
In my mind, there is no difference
between the magic rhythms...

282
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,669
of Bill Shakespeare's immortal verse
and the magic rhythms...

283
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,069
of Bill Robinson's immortal feet.

284
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,234
Hal, write that down.
I'll use it at Princeton.

285
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,151
It's already down. You used it last week.

286
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,800
I tell you, if it moves you,
if it stimulates you...

287
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,950
if it entertains you, it's theatre.

288
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,231
When the right combination gets together
and it spells theatre...

289
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,392
I got to be right in there up to my armpits.

290
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,439
That's higher than usual.

291
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,875
Now, that's what I wanted
Tony to hear you say.

292
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,238
I tried to tell him how you feel, but I knew
that you could say it so beautifully.

293
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,629
Lily, you splendid animal.

294
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,598
Take your hands off my wife
and let's get down to business.

295
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,672
Now I have here a script.
It's great. It's ready to roll.

296
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,196
Jeff, I want you to take this home.
I want you to read it tonight...

297
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,317
But before I do,
give me a rough idea of the plot.

298
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,954
- Now?
- Throw it at me for a quick impression.

299
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,951
- I'm dying to hear it.
- You tell it, Lester.

300
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,190
- You do it so much better.
- Lester, honestly.

301
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,669
- Please, Lily, tell them.
- Lester, honestly.

302
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,393
With Tony in mind, we naturally
visualize a light and intimate show.

303
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,314
We want to give him a chance to play
a charming guy, with just enough plot...

304
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,198
to make him do lots
of gay and varied numbers.

305
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,876
He's a writer and illustrator
of children's books...

306
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,473
but to get in the real dough...

307
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,518
on the side,
he writes lurid murder mysteries...

308
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,830
full of violence and buckets of blood.

309
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,199
The success of these
makes him feel he's sort of...

310
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,874
sold his soul to the Devil,
but he keeps on doing it.

311
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,157
There's lots of comedy implications
with his friends, played by us.

312
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,879
- And with his girl.
- I love this. Terrific possibilities.

313
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,076
And some of the best numbers
we've ever written!

314
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,278
Children's playground, a reform school,
12 showgirls playing softball!

315
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,477
- And a number about a murder mystery!
- You two are the end.

316
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,156
- Tony, I'm so glad!
- Some of the best lines we've written.

317
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,391
What do you think, Jeff?

318
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,991
Kids, you're geniuses.

319
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,918
The whole thing
is a brilliantly imaginative idea.

320
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,353
Why, Jeff!

321
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,910
You've hit on something
that's not only great as a musical...

322
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,719
but valid in terms of today, of modern life.

323
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,552
Jeff, I'm so glad!

324
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,155
Of course, these modern thrillers,
he's got to keep turning them out.

325
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,151
They make him fame, money. He's caught.

326
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,798
It's a funny situation.

327
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,395
Of course! It's brilliant,
contemporary, perceptive.

328
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,632
 This story's a modern version of Faust. 

329
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,276
 - Faust?
- You're kidding, Jeff. 

330
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,710
I guess I didn't tell it right.
I didn't bring out the point.

331
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,918
But you did bring out the point admirably.
You used the phrase:

332
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,275
"He sells his soul to the Devil."

333
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,677
Now, that's the line you have to follow
straight through.

334
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,480
Just like Faust,
this man is tempted by the Devil...

335
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,792
and his compromise, his sell-out,
must end in eternal damnation.

336
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,271
That'll leave them laughing.

337
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,239
Kids, you've got a choice here
between a nice little musical comedy...

338
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,039
and a modern musical morality play...

339
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,395
with meaning and stature!

340
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,675
 - But we don't want to write Faust.
- You're taking me too literally. 

341
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,035
I want to do your story. I love it!

342
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,920
But I want to angle it
to bring out the analogy...

343
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,594
 between the Faust legend
and this man's story. 

344
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,709
Won't this make it heavy?
Is this a box-office idea?

345
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,153
 Is Faust box-office? 

346
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,630
 Listen, Faust by Christopher Marlowe,
Faust by Goethe, Faust by Gounod... 

347
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,755
 Faust by Hector Berlioz. 

348
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,674
I tell you, anyone who's touched this
legend has turned it into a gold mine.

349
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,318
It's got to be a smash.

350
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,079
It could still have all the fun in it,
couldn't it?

351
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,869
- Yeah, and some stature thrown in.
- Now, kids, I'm happy about this.

352
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,594
- Really happy.
- So are we, Jeff.

353
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,079
This publisher you mentioned...

354
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,913
obviously, he could be
the counterpart of the Devil.

355
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,476
Evil personified!

356
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,039
Leading all mankind
into the paths of temptation!

357
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,116
- But nobody could play it like you.
- Nobody's going to.

358
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,191
You mean you're going to play it?

359
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,318
The part of the girl... Somebody fresh.

360
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,029
Somebody with fire, charm, grace, beauty.
Gabrielle Gerard.

361
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,431
- Gerard? She's a ballet dancer.
- She doesn't want to do a show.

362
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,909
- She turns them all down.
- Nobody ever turns me down.

363
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,719
Do you really think you could get her?
What a cast!

364
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,237
Tony Hunter, Jeff Cordova,
Gabrielle Gerard! Tony! Isn't this exciting?

365
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,469
Yeah.

366
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,475
 Now, look, this is going to be
a sort of modern Faust story. 

367
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,193
I play the Faust character. You play
the Devil. It'll have stature, importance.

368
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,398
- I have to dance with this ballet dancer?
- She's wonderful.

369
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,629
It'll be great.

370
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,951
It'll be great for somebody.
I'll pick up my marbles and go home.

371
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,838
Fellas, bless you and good luck,
but this just ain't for me.

372
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,831
I know what I can do,
and I'm sticking to it.

373
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,912
That's the trouble. You've stuck to it,
and you're stuck with it.

374
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,434
- What?
- Tony, nobody admires you more than I.

375
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,512
I've seen every show
and every movie you've ever done...

376
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,238
but let's face some brutal facts.

377
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,312
Times have changed, Tony.
You haven't changed with them.

378
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,279
- You've gone stale.
- Then you certainly don't need me.

379
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,599
Yes, we do!

380
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,989
Because you can be greater
than you ever were!

381
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,550
We are going to make you explode
on the theatre scene like a skyrocket!

382
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,552
Not just the old trademark,
with the top hat, tie, and tails...

383
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,631
but a great artist
at the peak of his powers.

384
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,315
The new Tony Hunter. Tony Hunter, 1953!

385
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,392
- But can I do it?
- It's a challenge to all of us...

386
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,948
but that's what the theatre’s about:
a challenge.

387
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,315
Whatever I am,
whether it's a new me or an old me...

388
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,118
remember, I'm still just an entertainer.

389
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,589
What do you think I am?
What do you think they are?

390
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,240
What do you think the theatre is?
It's all entertainment!

391
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,312
Believe me, there is no difference
between the magic rhythms...

392
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,994
- of Bill Robinson's immortal feet...
- You said that before.

393
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,629
All right, what did Bill Robinson do?
He danced on the stairs, didn't he?

394
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,280
Now I happen to play Oedipus the king
on the same stairs.

395
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,749
What's the difference? We're all theatre.

396
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,358
Show me the greatest tragic actor...

397
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,556
or the lowest red-nosed comic
in burlesque...

398
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,074
and I'll show you an entertainer. We're all...

399
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,791
Jeff, are you all right?

400
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,829
 Everything that happens in life 

401
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,275
 can happen in a show 

402
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,912
 You can make 'em laugh
You can make 'em cry 

403
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,199
 Anything, anything can go 

404
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,877
 The clown with his pants falling down 

405
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,316
 Or the dance that's a dream of romance 

406
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,279
 Or the scene where the villain is mean 

407
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,468
 That's Entertainment! 

408
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,912
 The lights on the lady in tights 

409
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,595
 Or the bride with the guy on the side 

410
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,673
 Or the ball where she gives him her all 

411
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,588
 That's Entertainment! 

412
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,232
 The plot can be hot
simply teeming with sex 

413
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,598
 A gay divorcée who is after her ex 

414
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,195
 It could be Oedipus Rex 

415
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,159
 Where a chap kills his father
and causes a lot of bother 

416
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,232
 The clerk who is thrown out of work 

 By the boss who was thrown for a loss 

418
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,190
 By the skirt who is doing him dirt 

419
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,511
 The world is a stage 

All right!

423
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,830
 That's Entertainment! 

424
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,078
Look what I can do.

425
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,279
It's still me!

426
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,557
 The doubt while the jury is out 

427
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,996
 or the thrill when they're reading the will 

- You gone yet, Hal?
- I'm in here, Jeff, on the phone.

444
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,348
Drama desk? Hello, Mike. It's Hal.

445
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,870
You know that item Mr. Cordova sent you
about signing Gabrielle Gerard...

446
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,075
for the Marton show?

447
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,596
There's been a mistake.
I wonder if there's still time to kill it.

448
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,478
- Yeah. I'd appreciate it. Thanks, kid.
- Why did you do that?

449
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,028
To save you from making an idiot
of yourself in print.

450
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,429
- You know you can't get Gerard.
- Why?

451
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,876
Because Paul Byrd won't let her
do a show. He's a tough customer.

452
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,599
He's not only her choreographer,
he's also her boyfriend.

453
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,398
She doesn't make a move without him.

454
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,357
That will be Paul Byrd now.

455
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,671
- It's 3:00 in the morning.
- Let him in, Hal, will you?

456
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,633
- Hello, Paul.
- Where are they?

457
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,153
He's in there.

458
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,635
Hello, Paul.

459
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,039
- Where is he?
- Who?

460
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,588
- Oscar Hammerstein.
- Home in bed, I hope, at this hour.

461
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,194
- Who is it? Dick Rodgers?
- What are you talking about?

462
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,840
Didn't you say the greatest producer
of musicals today...

463
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,194
was here and wanted to see me?

464
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,989
- That's me. I'm doing a musical.
- Did you get me out of bed...

465
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,119
I see what this is all about.

466
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,909
You needn't go any further because
the answer is no on Gabrielle Gerard.

467
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,309
Gabrielle... Paul, I don't follow you.

468
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,472
Gabrielle is not going to do a show.
She's too important to ballet.

469
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,198
This has nothing to do with Gabrielle.

470
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,713
Paul, I want you to do the choreography
for the greatest musical in years.

471
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,156
- I'm sorry...
- That's why I wakened you, Paul.

472
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,949
I'm so keyed up I just can't sleep.
You know how brilliant the Martons are.

473
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,712
This time, they've excelled themselves.

474
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,598
This show is a choreographer's dream,
and only you can do it.

475
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,274
- I wouldn't say that.
- No time for false modesty.

476
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,238
You're the greatest, and we know it.
This is just your meat.

477
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,757
 A great classic theme.
The story of Faust in a modern setting. 

478
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,313
Say, that sounds interesting.

479
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,153
I've never been so excited
about a project in my life.

480
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,789
Now, there's Tony Hunter, myself,
a great score by the Martons.

481
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,155
Wonderful. My brain's beginning
to churn already.

482
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,869
Good. Now we must comb the country
for a wonderful singer for the girl.

483
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,675
Singer? Jeff, don't you think we ought
to stress the dancing in that role?

484
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,954
No, Paul.

485
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,477
This girl has to be a virtuoso performer,
with fire, charm, beauty...

486
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,513
a great lady with a gamine quality.
You know no dancer can give you that.

487
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,479
Wait. Of course I wouldn't let her do it,
but Gabrielle has all that and more.

488
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,677
Gabrielle? Paul, I feel a little embarrassed.

489
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,558
I think she's charming,
within her limitations. Charming.

490
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,312
She's a great artist, and you know it.

491
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,756
- Sorry. I know how fond of her you are.
- That has nothing to do with it!

492
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,115
She can be one of the greatest
stars in the theatre.

493
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,633
Everybody's been trying to get her.

494
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,870
For the right vehicle,
something light and fluffy.

495
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,552
Light and fluffy? Now, see here, Jeff.

496
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,950
I'm not gonna do this show
unless Gabrielle Gerard plays that part!

497
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,709
Now, Paul, this throws a little
monkey wrench into things, doesn't it?

498
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,633
Never mind.
You and I will work together sometime...

499
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,837
Wait. At least do this. You come
and see her in the ballet tomorrow.

500
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,309
- Bring Hunter, bring the Martons.
- No. Impossible.

501
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,914
I have a performance.
But I'll gladly send the Martons.

502
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,390
We can get together afterwards and talk.
Mind you, I'm promising nothing.

503
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,198
Good night, sweetie.

504
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,708
Drama desk?

505
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,270
Mike. Hal again.
Better print that item after all.

506
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,592
And, Mike, after this, if Mr. Cordova tells
you he's casting Tallulah...

507
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,194
for Little Eva, believe him.

508
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,879
COMMODORE THEATER
Coutray Ballet Company

509
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,076
Gabrielle Gerard
Choreography by Paul Byrd

510
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,993
IMAGE OF THE NIGHT - ENSEMBLE
THE FIELDS - PHANTASY

511
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,355
Well?

512
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,432
She's fabulous, sensational,
loveliest thing I've ever seen.

513
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,312
A little tall, isn't she?

514
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,839
Stage illusion.

515
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,712
So you didn't care for it much?

516
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,631
The girl's fantastic, beautiful...

517
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,153
but I can't dance with her.

518
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,673
Stop worrying!

519
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,753
It isn't that I don't appreciate
what she does.

520
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,638
I tell you, I know she's magnificent.
That's what scares me.

521
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,235
But I haven't done ballet
since I was a kid. I'd look silly.

522
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,278
Hello, Lil. You look wonderful.
Put your things over there.

523
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,639
Hello, Mr. Hunter. How are you?

524
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,597
- Hello, Les. Glad to see you.
- How are you?

525
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,910
What is this?
The annual fur trappers' convention?

526
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,150
- The boss is inside with big money.
- His backers?

527
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,595
- They're raising money for the show.
- What show, ours?

528
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,511
- Sure.
- He hasn't read the script yet.

529
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,272
- I better go back...
- Sorry, Mr. Marton.

530
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,397
You disturb the water, you scare the fish.
They're biting tonight.

531
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,313
- What's he telling them?
- Whatever it is, it's going over big.

532
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,992
- Come on, Lil.
- Please don't go in yet.

533
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,799
Wait here in the study.
He's saving you for the big finale.

534
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,869
Excuse me.

535
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,871
- Lester, isn't this wonderful?
- Yeah.

536
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,155
- This is going to be great, Tony.
- Why?

537
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,390
Cordova. The dough for the show.
No problems.

538
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,789
How many times did we have to audition
the last time?

539
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,757
- Fifty.
- A hundred, maybe more.

540
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,674
Jeff might raise the backing tonight.
We'll be ready to rehearse in three weeks.

541
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,798
- Hello, Hal.
- Hello, Paul. How are you?

542
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,472
How nice to see you. Come right in.

543
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,516
Hal, this is Miss Gerard. Mr. Benton.

544
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,716
How do you do?
Jeff's inside with the backers.

545
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,631
Why don't you wait in the library?

546
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,119
- Excuse me.
- Thanks.

547
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,396
Let's wait in here a minute, huh?

548
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,750
Now, wait a second. I'm not ready yet.

549
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,637
There's a lot to be cleared up first.

550
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,075
This girl Gerard, it's not just her dancing.

551
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,391
On top of everything, she's too tall for me.
This girl is a giantess.

552
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,471
She's not too tall for you. I know this girl.

553
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,676
She comes up to here,
maybe 2 inches shorter.

554
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,035
You know I'm the perfect height for you.
Now look...

555
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,429
turn around. Measure. Look.
You see? Isn't that fine?

556
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,150
Listen. Gabrielle Gerard in her
stocking feet is at the most 3-feet tall.

557
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,354
Now relax. I'm going to find you a drink,
and you can stop worrying about her.

558
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,034
Jeff only wants her in the show
because she's the best.

559
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,475
We all gotta go along with him, too, Tony.

560
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,630
In the show, one guy's got to be
at the helm...

561
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,154
and in Jeff, we got someone
we can trust to...

562
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,710
...it is the Devil, come to claim the soul
of the modern Faust man.

563
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,598
With flapping wings
and grinning evil eyes...

564
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,353
he points the way
to the yawning pits of Hades.

565
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,869
Hallelujah.

566
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,190
- I'm embarrassed.
- Don't be childish.

567
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,714
I'm sure Tony Hunter doesn't want me
in this show.

568
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,553
- What makes you say that?
- Did he come backstage to see me...

569
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,755
after the performance?

570
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,671
He knew he was going to meet you here.

571
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,435
- I'm just a ballet dancer...
- You're a famous leading ballerina.

572
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,717
What does he want with me?
He's a famous movie and stage actor.

573
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,439
He's practically a historical character
by now.

574
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,796
Dancing with him is like dancing
with a statue of General Grant.

575
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,359
Now look, Gaby.

576
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,196
You know, this is a Cordova show.
It's an important step for you.

577
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,193
I'm going to do the choreography,
so there's nothing for you to worry about.

578
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,033
But I still think he doesn't want me
in the show.

579
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,553
Your nose is shiny.

580
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,790
- Where's the...
- Maybe this is it.

581
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,916
He passes by all the writhing souls
in torment paying for their deadly sins.

582
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,752
Gluttony, avarice...

583
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,073
It must be upstairs.

584
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,917
Lester, what have we got ourselves into?

585
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,310
The story he's telling them has nothing
to do with the story we wrote.

586
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,755
This will mean months of rewriting.

587
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,032
He expects us to go into rehearsal
in three weeks?

588
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,750
Brimstone and flames. Save me.

589
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,190
Corrupter of children.
Purveyor of evil. Dungeon...

590
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,872
...bubbling cauldrons.
Fiery furnaces of doom.

591
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,995
- You're...
- And you're... How do you do?

592
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,798
How do you do? It's certainly a...

593
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,792
- We've been waiting for you in there.
- We just got here.

594
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,110
We just got here ourselves,
about five minutes ago.

595
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,236
A little early, I guess. Mr. Cordova's busy.

596
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,754
Yes, I know, and I rushed so to get here.

597
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,229
- I'm a mess.
- No. You look wonderful.

598
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,678
- Will you have a cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.

599
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,758
- Never?
- I don't think a dancer should smoke.

600
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,955
I see.

601
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,793
- Is anything wrong?
- No.

602
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,476
- Pretty shoes.
- Thank you.

603
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,352
You always wear high heels?

604
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,829
No. Not always. Sometimes toeshoes.

605
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,468
Toeshoes.

606
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,511
I'm afraid I've been awfully rude.

607
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,114
I haven't told you how wonderful
you were tonight.

608
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,873
Thank you.
I'm a great admirer of yours, too.

609
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,633
- I didn't think you'd ever even heard of me.
- Heard of you?

610
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,359
I used to see all your pictures
when I was a little girl.

611
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,955
I'm still a fan. I recently went to see
a revival of them at the museum.

612
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,075
Museum?

613
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,957
"Step right this way,
ladies and gentlemen.

614
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,871
"Egyptian mummies, extinct reptiles...

615
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,679
"and Tony Hunter,
the grand old man of the dance."

616
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,795
I didn't mean...

617
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,668
I want you to know that I can still
thread a needle without my eyeglasses...

618
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,479
and still occasionally do
a soft-shoe shuffle.

619
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,073
Nothing balletic, of course.

620
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,991
You're not a ballet devotee, are you?

621
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,594
Yes. I was going to the ballet
before you were born.

622
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,717
I saw Pavlova, Karsavina,
all the real ballet greats.

623
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,394
You don't see dancing like that nowadays.
I'm sorry.

624
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,074
That's okay. I don't expect you
to class me with Pavlova.

625
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,354
In fact, if she were around...

626
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,590
I doubt if she'd be good enough
to dance with you.

627
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,671
You'd probably insist on an audition first.

628
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,399
I sure would.
I'd audition my own grandmother.

629
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,950
Then why don't you audition mine?
She'd be just about right for you.

630
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,110
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No, you're not.

631
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,633
- No, I'm not.
- Neither am I.

632
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,755
Good.

633
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,953
- Paul, I'm leaving.
- What's the matter, darling?

634
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,110
I can't work with that man.
He's impossible.

635
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,838
We just got here. It'll look funny...

636
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,514
The whole thing is off.
This girl is a monster.

637
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,511
I have definitely had it.

638
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,713
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the brains, the talent, the artists.

639
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,629
Wonderful. Aren't they wonderful?

640
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,950
You have no idea
how well things are going.

641
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,712
It's really wonderful.

642
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,557
Ladies and gentlemen.

643
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,949
I want you all to meet
the happy little group...

644
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,519
that's responsible for the show...

645
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,717
that everyone will be clamouring
to get seats for next season.

646
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,439
The celebrated choreographer Paul Byrd.

647
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,668
The authors you know:
Lily and Lester Marton.

648
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,512
Take a bow, Lily.

649
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,997
And, ladies and gentlemen...

650
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,230
my star, Tony Hunter.

651
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,630
A name, a talent.
Mr. Show Business himself.

652
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,357
And, ladies and gentlemen,
his new leading lady.

653
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,353
That glamorous, delightful dancer
from the magical world of ballet.

654
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,319
Mr. Hunter's own personal choice,
Gabrielle Gerard.

655
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,395
I think, gentlemen, you will agree
your investment is safe, yes?

656
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,199
Now let's relax and have a drink, shall we?

657
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,554
My dear, how do you authors
ever think of these brilliant ideas?

658
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,712
That damnation scene.
Did you ever in your life hear...

659
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,634
My boy. I had the pleasure
of backing your last show, too.

660
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,314
Jeffrey. How about...

661
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,794
There it is, folks. The work light.

662
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,713
Only an electric bulb, perhaps,
but for the next four weeks...

663
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,519
that will be our sun, our moon, our stars.

664
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,831
These four walls will be our universe,
our private world.

665
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,112
We enter with nothing but a dream,
but when we leave...

666
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,792
we'll have a show.

667
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,118
In between, there will be enthusiasms,
frustrations, hot tempers...

668
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,474
cold coffee.

669
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,074
Some of us will fight, some fall in love...

670
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,549
but all of us will work and adore it...

671
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,473
because all of us are inspired
by the same thing.

672
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,155
The night that curtain goes up,
it will go up on a smash hit.

673
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,157
And believe me, kids...

674
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,233
there's nothing in the world as soothing...

675
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,271
as a smash hit.

676
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,832
What do you think this is,
summer stock or something?

677
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,628
POSITIVELY NO SMOKING

678
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,349
Go!

679
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,998
That's it. That's wonderful.
Why didn't you do it before?

680
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,479
Good, men.

681
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,154
Honey, would you try
that cross, please, again for me?

682
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,277
"The same kind of opportunistic snake
that he is."

683
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,193
"You got me wrong. I'm a self-made snake.

684
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,511
"Listen, baby, we all live by the jungle:
Eat or be eaten.

685
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,593
"I just realized that I like to eat,
and to eat caviar whenever possible.

686
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,671
"Anything wrong with that?"

687
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,594
"Anything wrong with that?" A bad line.

688
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,111
What we need is some quick image,
like "spreading ideals on a cracker."

689
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,033
You all like that?
"Ever try spreading ideals on a cracker?"

690
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,519
Let me hear it, Tony.

691
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,909
Did you ever try spreading ideals
on a cracker?

692
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,753
- Jeff. I don't...
- Honey, just try that cross again for me.

693
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,877
"The same kind of opportunistic snake
that he is."

694
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,040
"You got me wrong. I'm a self-made snake.

695
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,839
"Listen, baby.
We all live by the law of the jungle..."

696
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,751
- Excuse me, Tony.
- "...eat or be eaten."

697
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,398
Pardon me, folks.

698
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,918
You know about icebergs, don't you?

699
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,833
One-eighth above the surface,
seven-eighths below. That's you.

700
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,798
You're giving me only that one-eighth.
I'm greedy. I want more.

701
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,598
All eight-eighths. Now let it rip, Tony.

702
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,639
Give it too much. Go way over.
Come along. The whole eight-eighths!

703
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,239
Okay, Gaby. Same place.

704
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,470
"The same kind of opportunistic snake
that he is."

705
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,516
You got me wrong. I'm a self-made snake!

706
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,717
Listen, baby. We all live by
the law of the jungle: Eat or be eaten!

707
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,429
And I realized that I like to eat,
and eat caviar whenever possible.

708
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,273
Did you ever try spreading ideals
on a cracker?

709
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,033
Good boy, Tony. That's it. Eight-eighths.

710
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,394
- Sorry. Butterfingers.
- No. It's not your fault, Tony.

711
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,436
It's an awkward pattern.
I have a better idea.

712
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,715
You hold your position right here,
and Jimmy...

713
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,076
suppose you pick up Gaby like that,
and put her down...

714
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,230
right here next to Tony?
Now you see, Tony...

715
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,629
I'd like to practice it with her
two or three times.

716
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,755
I think I could handle it.

717
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,558
Do you mind if he tries it with Barbara?

718
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,471
These are new toeshoes.
They're killing me.

719
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,074
Sure. You go ahead and rest.
Barbara, come here. Try it.

720
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,196
I think this is what's throwing you off.

721
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,352
If you hold your balance so, like this,
then grab her here by the...

722
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,113
Paul, I think we're making a mistake here.

723
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,471
I think we're wasting Tony in this scene.

724
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,677
He's got the first-act finale right after this.
The damnation scene.

725
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,796
I don't want to dissipate
his impact in that.

726
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,998
Now, why not let him exit into the house
and watch it from his balcony?

727
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,559
- How'd that be?
- Wonderful idea.

728
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,029
See what that would do?
Save your sock for the finale.

729
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,269
Much better that way.

730
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,555
Let's go back
to the beginning positions. Gaby.

731
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,551
Boys, get around up here,
and the girls, yes.

732
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,108
You were down here in the line like that.
Not too close.

733
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,952
This group's down here, you're up there.

734
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,712
- Let's try it this way.
- No!

735
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,553
Let's not try it this way or any other way.

736
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,199
I have had enough. I've had
three weeks of these lovely rehearsals...

737
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,636
three weeks of Chinese torture.
I don't know what you're trying to do...

738
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,314
except make me look like a complete fool.
A clumsy idiot.

739
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,597
I've tried. For three weeks, I've tried.
I've taken everything.

740
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,355
I've watched my part being changed,
my numbers being cut out day after day...

741
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,475
and I haven't said a word.

742
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,915
Got to be cooperative,
think of the good of the show.

743
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,877
Let's get this straight:

744
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,676
I am not Nijinsky. I am not Marlon Brando.

745
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,156
I am Mrs. Hunter's little boy, Tony,
song-and-dance man.

746
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,152
I'm supposed to have entertained
millions of people in my time.

747
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,870
And I am not entertained by
this little ballerina's snide insinuations...

748
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,757
that I am a no-talent hoofer.

749
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,752
I am sick of her superior smirk.
I'm sick of her.

750
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,628
 I'm sick of Faust. I am sick of this show.
Never mind saying it! 

751
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,393
Tony Hunter, 1953.

752
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,115
I hereby declare my independence.

753
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,392
Tony Hunter, 1776.

754
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,034
Bless you.

755
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,354
STAGE DOOR

756
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,953
- Lester, where are you going?
- I don't know. I was...

757
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,113
What's happening to us? Let's try
to keep our heads. It's only a show.

758
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,918
I know. I'm sorry, baby.

759
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,992
So am I. Let's try to be sensible about it.

760
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,874
- Do you think we should try to find Tony?
- I don't know. What do you think?

761
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,155
- Maybe we should.
- But Jeff said not to.

762
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,800
And, of course,
you mustn't disobey teacher.

763
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,838
Right or wrong,
someone has got to be at the helm.

764
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,388
But to you, he's 100% right every time.

765
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,836
If you say one more word to me
about Jeff's hypnotic influence on me...

766
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,593
- I'll scream.
- He's got you so bulldozed...

767
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,837
Someone's liable to think we're quarrelling.

768
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,115
We're not quarrelling.
We're in complete agreement.

769
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,872
We hate each other.

770
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,517
WE NEVER CLOSE - Cocktails

771
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,159
Joe, tell Mrs. Marton I've gone to Tahiti...

772
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,914
to paint.

773
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,633
UNBREAKABLE

774
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,916
- Hello, Mr. Hunter.
- You must have the wrong apartment.

775
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,037
No. I came to see you.
May I come in a minute?

776
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,355
Please.

777
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,269
I was just about to slip
into my bed of nails.

778
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,513
I'm terribly sorry.

779
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,479
That's all right. You couldn't have done it
if I hadn't softened it up for you.

780
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,993
- What?
- Nothing.

781
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,353
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

782
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,590
That's right. Dancers shouldn't smoke.

783
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,478
- You mind if I do?
- Yes. I mean, it's all right.

784
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,709
Thanks.

785
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,714
How lovely.

786
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,592
I've never seen such wonderful prints
in a hotel.

787
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,559
They don't belong to the hotel yet.
They're mine, and they're originals.

788
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,154
Don't let that throw you.

789
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,153
I don't know any more about art than I do
about dancing. I'm just a Hollywood actor.

790
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,470
I call my agent and say,
"I've got a wall to cover.

791
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,916
"Send me over 20 feet's worth of paintings
in assorted colours."

792
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,994
That's a very early Degas, isn't it?

793
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,712
"1877."

794
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,995
Yeah. I swiped it from his desk in school.
Was he sore.

795
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,394
What can I do for you?

796
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,756
I know. You demand an apology.
Okay, let's cut it short. I apologize.

797
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,832
No, don't do that.
I'm supposed to apologize to you.

798
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,549
I mean...

799
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,313
I see, the fellows got together,
stuck a gun in your back...

800
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,392
No, it was all my idea.
I just wanted to tell you that...

801
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,596
All right. It was Paul's idea.

802
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,551
Why do I let him push me around?

803
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,234
What do I want to apologize
to you for anyway?

804
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,117
You've been mean to me.

805
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,431
You didn't want me in the show
in the first place.

806
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,589
What?

807
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,274
And you think
I'm a dime-a-dozen ballet dancer.

808
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,349
No.

809
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,830
And this whole thing's making me
a nervous wreck and no show is worth it.

810
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,912
I wouldn't apologize to you
in a million years.

811
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,959
Now, don't do that. Please, just
calm down. Now take it easy. Look.

812
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,720
I thought I was the only nervous wreck
around here...

813
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,631
and all this time you've been behaving...

814
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,359
I've behaved horribly to you, and I know it.

815
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,149
I'm not used to behaving horribly.
It's a big strain.

816
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,430
You just misunderstood me, that's all.
I think you're terrific.

817
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,035
I think everything in the show
is probably terrific, except me.

818
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,350
I've been scared to death of you...

819
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,591
and scared to death
of every last kid in the chorus.

820
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,432
Don't be nice to me.

821
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,392
It just makes me seem twice as ugly.

822
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,030
I'd say you were more plain than ugly...

823
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,954
- but at least you've got talent.
- Thanks.

824
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,830
Now look, Gaby. It's just plain silly...

825
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,150
that we have never sat down
and talked this out.

826
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,391
We are the only animals given
the greatest means of communication...

827
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,515
human speech.

828
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,797
- And all we do is snarl at each other.
- I know.

829
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,713
We're from two different worlds,
two eras...

830
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,758
but yet we're supposed
to dance together, work together.

831
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,432
No one consulted us...

832
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,557
but we're the only things that matter
in this whole thing.

833
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,077
Not those geniuses out there,
telling us what to do.

834
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,916
You're right.
We have to do the performing.

835
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,874
We're the ones
that have to get up on that stage...

836
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,192
- and make idiots out of ourselves.
- Tony, is that what's going to happen?

837
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,318
No. Of course not.
Things are going to be fine.

838
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,790
I have a feeling that everything
is going to be much better from now on.

839
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,552
Yes, I know, but...

840
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,634
Can you and I really dance together?

841
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,879
I don't know.

842
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,393
Let's find out.

843
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,397
- Taxi, sir?
- Yes, please.

844
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,717
- El Morocco, please.
- No.

845
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,549
Stork? Waldorf?

846
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,154
No. I'm not dressed.
I just came from rehearsal.

847
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,959
- I can't go to any of those places.
- You look fine to me.

848
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,190
- Never mind. Thanks.
- Thank you.

849
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,558
- Where to, sir?
- Leave it to the horse.

850
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,598
Look, trees.

851
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,113
Yes, I remember now, dimly. Trees.

852
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,076
And isn't that called grass?

853
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,876
And, look, there's the sky.

854
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,159
This has all been here...

855
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,596
the whole time we have been
shut up in our little sweatbox of the arts.

856
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,398
Really? Amazing.

857
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,991
Do you know what those are
on those benches? People.

858
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,435
Happy people.

859
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,476
Would you believe it?
They don't even care...

860
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,757
whether we have a damnation scene
in our show or not.

861
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,599
Neither do I.

862
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,989
New Haven THEATRICAL TRANSPORT CO.
New Haven, Conn.

863
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,951
NEW HAVEN THEATRE - STAGE ENTRANCE

864
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,917
You can't get it into the elevators.

865
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,390
And you take this one here,
and it won't fit the finale.

866
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,954
- How are we doing?
- It's a disaster.

867
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,998
We're in terrible trouble.
We just can't open in three days.

868
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,595
I told you from the beginning,
you are overloading the show.

869
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,955
You can't get all this scenery
in the theatre.

870
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,873
- Why isn't this hung?
- We've been hanging all night.

871
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,315
You've got more scenery in this show...

872
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,516
than there is in Yellowstone National Park.

873
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,353
Never mind. Get your blueprints.
We'll go have a conference.

874
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,795
Everything will work out all right.

875
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,677
Hold it. I scored for brass,
and all I hear is flute.

876
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,398
I don't want so many long bows.

877
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,358
Lester, I gotta cut 16 bars
out of that dance.

878
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,717
Sixteen bars! Hey, Lil.

879
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,993
All right, I'll make the cut. Page to page.

880
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,469
Would you ask Lily
if she approves the cut?

881
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,835
- Lil, how about this cut?
- It's fine.

882
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,592
Okay, Lester. Let's give it to her.

883
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,831
This'll sound like hash.
I better put some chords in for transition.

884
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,071
Wait, just a minute.
Sublime, time, dime, slime...

885
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,196
 You can't hear Tony in Lovelier Than You. 

886
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,750
- I'm already holding down the orchestra.
- Maybe the key's too low.

887
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,670
Ask Lester if Tony can take it a key higher.

888
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,671
 About Lovelier Than You,
Les, a key higher? 

889
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,354
Don't you see I'm trying to make a cut?
The key's perfect.

890
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,671
- But Lily said you'd make the change.
- The key is...

891
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,514
 Everyone on their toes
for the transformation scene. 

892
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,273
 - We're not ready.
- Perfectly all right. Next. 

893
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,430
 Watch it.
I'll cue you for the transition music. 

894
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,158
 Isn't it great? Herman. 

895
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,037
 Everybody ready back there? 

896
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,190
We got to have more time
to make the change.

897
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,397
- I've got to have 16 more men.
- I got elevators...

898
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,833
Do the best you can.

899
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,638
 All right, everybody. This is it. 

900
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,439
 Men in the elevators,
watch the signal lights for your cues. 

901
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,557
 Switchboards. Stand by to come down
your number one batten on cue. 

902
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,473
 Girls on stairs, take your positions,
but don't be frightened. 

903
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,755
 Men in armour, light your chandeliers. 

904
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,913
 All right, make this great, everybody.
Don't forget, it's the first-act finale. 

905
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,074
Are you guys all right in there?
Now, watch your cue.

906
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,679
 Light change. 

907
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,909
 Revolve. 

908
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,510
 This is going to be beautiful. 

909
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,354
 It will be a memorable moment. 

910
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,994
 Memorable. 

911
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,911
 This is real theatre. 

912
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,390
 Everything's smooth as silk. 

913
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:35,391
 No, Herman, that doesn't go up,
it goes down. Take it down. 

914
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,077
 What is this? Herman! 

915
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,280
 I don't think you've got your cues right! 

916
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,913
 No, stop! 

917
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,359
 That one doesn't go down, it goes up.
Take it up. 

918
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,478
 For heaven's sake, look at your cue sheet. 

919
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:57,553
 Take it up. No, not me. 

920
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,392
 Herman, this cable has fouled. 

921
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,637
Calm down. Don't let us lose our heads.

922
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,393
This is a setback,
but that's what we come out of town for.

923
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,595
We'll never make it work.

924
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,956
Of course it will. You boys get together,
think of something brilliant.

925
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:27,157
You can't put Gaby on that thing.
It's dangerous. I won't allow it.

926
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,152
It's all right. After all, we expected
to strike a snag or two.

927
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,993
Get the full company in the lounge
for dialogue rehearsal...

928
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:36,595
while they're clearing the stage.
We can't afford to waste a moment.

929
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,320
Here. I'm sorry. I forgot.

930
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,839
That help?

931
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,153
All right?

932
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,316
If you've quite finished, let's try this.

933
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,960
We're going to get the stage soon.
You don't know it yet.

934
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:18,556
Paul, I'm afraid Gaby's kind of beat.
Nobody's had any sleep for two nights.

935
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,039
Can't you let her rest a while?

936
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,913
If you don't mind, Tony,
I've worked with her for many years.

937
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,309
I happen to know her a good deal
better than you do.

938
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,674
All right, Gaby. Come on.

939
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,318
Madame, may I have this dance?

940
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,358
Cut the clowning. It's not going to seem
so funny tomorrow night.

941
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,759
All right, Adam.

942
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:45,110
Okay, Paul, they're ready for you on-stage.
Come on.

943
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,629
This is the big moment.
Hal, come on. Take it over there.

944
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:57,633
Tony, Gaby, this is it.
I want it to be outstanding.

945
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,915
It must be beautiful, fabulous,
warm, and fiery.

946
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,078
Your cue is, "Dance, fools, dance!"

947
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,674
Hal, it seems to be a little too much,
doesn't it?

948
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,994
Yes.

949
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,798
Are we really supposed
to open tomorrow night?

950
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,315
"Dance, fools, dance!"

951
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,078
The New Haven Theatre PRESENTS THE

952
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,958
JEFFREY CORDOVA PRODUCTION OF
The Band Wagon

953
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,678
OPENING TONIGHT
NEW GREAT MUSICAL

954
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,479
ALL OF THE NATION'S GREATEST HITS

955
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,274
Hello, there! It's a big night.

956
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,671
Everybody is here from New York.
Simply everybody.

957
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,593
Do you hear that, my dear?
Everybody from New York is here.

958
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,034
Come on. Don't want you
to miss the overture.

959
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,751
Think we should get ready, boys?

960
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,912
No, we can finish this hand.
Nobody's made a pep talk yet.

961
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,395
Pep talk?

962
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,713
Yeah. I never seen an opening night yet
without some guy...

963
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,349
gets all the poor actors together
and makes them a long speech:

964
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,112
"They should be brilliant."

965
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,829
On-stage, please. Everybody on-stage.

966
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,077
Mr. Cordova wants to say a few words.

967
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:26,391
Come on, girls. Hurry up. Let's go.
Step right along.

968
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,269
Company, a final word.
You've all been just wonderful.

969
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,953
Thanks for your cooperation.

970
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,998
Tonight, we're about to perform
before an audience in a theatre.

971
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,799
It's not only a temple of the arts,
but a place of business.

972
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,031
And I feel we have here a venture
that is successful on both counts.

973
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,351
Nothing to be nervous about.
We've got to keep our wits and do a show.

974
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,829
There will be rough spots,
but we'll smooth them out.

975
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,354
Remember, that's what
we came out of town for.

976
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,273
Up to now,
I've been giving you orders as director...

977
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,196
but when next you see me,
I shall be just as one of you...

978
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,953
an eager ham, anxious to make good.

979
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,239
Actors, let's go.

980
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,789
All right, people.
Get ready for the tableau, girls.

981
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,394
Finish your make-up.
Come on, girls. Let's go.

982
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,917
I'm so glad you folks could come.

983
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,952
And don't forget the big party
at the hotel after the show.

984
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,270
The whole cast will be there.
You'll meet them all.

985
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,273
Of course, I have to go backstage
to congratulate them afterwards.

986
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,556
I'll see you all at the party.

987
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,718
All New York is here.

988
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,511
Big party at the hotel after the show.

989
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,831
I'll look for you. Big party, big show.
Come on, now.

990
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,712
We don't want to miss a thing.
Now, don't forget the party.

991
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,349
Evelyn, big party at the hotel
after the show.

992
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,998
I'll look for you.

993
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,992
Champagne's on me.

994
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:56,032
The Band Wagon
WILL BE THE Great Hit OF THE YEAR

995
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,197
Shall I drive you to the hotel, sir,
to the party?

996
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,828
No. Drive me to the station.

997
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,718
Maybe I can still make the 11:40
back to New York.

998
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,994
Yes, sir.

999
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,430
 - Good evening.
- I was looking for The Band Wagon party. 

1000
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,033
This is it, sir.

1001
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,354
 Let's go. Hurry up. Champagne. 

1002
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,671
This way, please.

1003
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,513
- Are you leaving, sir?
- Yes. Good night.

1004
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,316
We must do this more often.

1005
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,957
 Oh, give me something
to remember you by 

1006
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:32,717
 When you are far away from me 

1007
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,396
 Some little something 

1008
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,277
It's all Annie's fault.

1009
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:44,632
I should have listened to my mother.
She told me only to be in hit shows.

1010
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,558
Hi, I don't want to barge in.

1011
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,108
I just want to tell you all
how great I think you are.

1012
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,077
I didn't get a chance
to know you very well.

1013
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:57,870
- I'm sorry I messed up the show for you.
- Wait a minute, come on in, have a drink.

1014
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,997
- I don't want to crash the party.
- Give Mr. Hunter a drink.

1015
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,674
- What do you say, Scotch, rye, or beer?
- Beer's fine.

1016
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,433
- One beer, coming up.
- Want some pizza pie?

1017
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,398
How about a sandwich?
We've got ham and devilled egg.

1018
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,994
I've had enough of both for one night.

1019
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:21,272
 Far away
Me, oh, my 

1020
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,955
 Only yesterday 

1021
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,598
There we were, the whole act,
the 10 Tapping Troubadours.

1022
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,671
The 10 Tapping Troubadours?

1023
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,113
Yeah, believe it or not...

1024
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,509
we were stranded in Pittsburgh
with $3 between us...

1025
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,478
crammed into one room
the size of that closet.

1026
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,678
Gaby, come on in.
We're having a good old-fashioned wake.

1027
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,632
I've been looking all over for you.

1028
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:48,755
Where is Paul?

1029
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,673
He's at a very exclusive wake
with Jeff and the Martons.

1030
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,955
Can I get you a drink, Gaby?
How about a beer?

1031
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,837
How about some popcorn?

1032
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,711
Lily, Lester, come on in.

1033
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,717
Are you sure? Don't you remember?
We wrote that thing.

1034
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,314
This is a wonderful party. Come on in.

1035
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,117
Who's going to go out and get the beer?
Okay, Sis, you're elected.

1036
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,031
Tony, watch this!

1037
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,953
More beer!

1038
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,349
I'll never forget. You blew a gasket.

1039
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,556
You were really gone. Come on.

1040
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,398
Come on, Tony. Come on, get with it.

01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,473
 - How I love the glass of beer
- More beer 

1042
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:37,511
 - Beer goes very good with beer
- More beer 

1043
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:42,151
 When I'm drinking beer I'm thinking
'"Ach, life is dear'" 

1044
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:46,956
 But there's someone I love
even more than beer 

1045
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,918
 I love Louisa
Louisa loves me 

1046
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:57,677
 When we rode on the merry-go-round
I kissed Louisa 

1047
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,673
 And then Louisa
Louisa kissed me 

1048
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:06,478
 We were so happy
So happy and free 

1049
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:10,958
 Ach! Ach! But she's a
beautiful Louisa 

1050
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:15,397
 Ach! When I choose 'em
I never want to lose 'em 

1051
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:19,871
 Someday Louisa
Louisa will be 

1052
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,838
 More als just a Fräulein to me 

1053
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:30,638
 - Frenchmen love a glass of wine
- More beer 

1054
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:35,077
 - The English think the whiskey's fine
- More beer 

1055
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:39,392
 But when I comb off all the foam off
I drink a toast 

1056
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,273
 To the Germans and the Mädchen 

1057
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:45,750
 I love most 

1058
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,152
 Ich liebe Louisa
Louisa liebt mich 

1059
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,916
 Wenn wir auf das Ringelspiel gehen
Ich küsse Louisa 

1060
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,675
 Und dann Louisa
Louisa küsst mich 

1061
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:03,436
 Wir sind so glücklich
So glücklich sind wir 

1062
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,877
 Ach! Ach! But she's a
beautiful Louisa 

 Someday Louisa
Louisa will be 

1067
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,152
 More than just a Fräulein to me 

1068
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:49,392
 More beer!
More beer! 

1069
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:53,029
 More beer! 

1070
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,595
Gosh, with all this raw talent around,
why can't us kids get together...

1071
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,079
and put on ourselves a show?

1072
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:16,789
Maybe we can find ourselves
a barn or something, and maybe...

1073
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,629
I could stand anything but failure.

1074
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,309
- Where's the telephone?
- In there.

1075
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,954
Give me Jeff Cordova's room, please.

1076
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:40,470
Hello, Jeff. This is Tony.
Now, don't say anything. Just listen.

1077
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,120
I'm here with all the kids,
and we've come to a decision.

1078
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:46,954
We're not closing this show,
if you can call it a show. We're going on.

1079
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,316
We're going to keep it on the road
and redo it from top to bottom.

1080
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,231
 It won't be a modern version of Faust... 

1081
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,880
 Pilgrim 's Progress, or the Book of Job
in swing time. 

1082
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,599
It'll be our show,
the show we started out to do...

1083
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,240
the book the Martons wrote,
with the songs you threw out.

1084
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,153
It'll have laughs and entertainment.
You remember entertainment?

1085
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,196
Look, we'd love to have you with us, Jeff.

1086
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,350
But if you're not,
it won't make any difference.

1087
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,873
We're going ahead just the same.

1088
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,793
We're going to put this thing across,
aren't we, kids?

1089
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,917
 - All right. What do you say?
- Hello? There's nobody here. 

1090
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,798
This is the chambermaid, but if you want...

1091
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:21,156
 - I'll leave a message for Mr. Cordova.
- Thank you, madam. 

1092
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,033
He isn't in.

1093
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,389
Jeff, did you hear what I said?

1094
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,276
Tony, I've learned one thing in the theatre,
and it's this:

1095
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:44,511
one man has to be at the helm,
the rest take orders.

1096
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,035
I believe in what you said.
I got carried away in the wrong direction.

1097
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:53,671
You've got to be the boss, Tony.
I think you can pull this off brilliantly...

1098
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,110
and I'd like to be a part of it.

1099
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,235
Jeff, you're all right.

1100
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,470
I must tell you one thing.
There isn't any money.

1101
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,711
Colonel Todd and the backers
have stolen away into the night.

1102
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,869
- We've got backers.
- Who?

1103
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,076
A bunch of painters.
A fellow named Degas from...

1104
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:12,072
- You wouldn't sell your paintings.
- Sure, they love the theatre.

1105
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:16,073
I figure we need five or six weeks on tour
to do what we have to do with this show.

1106
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,594
- Jeff, would you help us with bookings?
- Of course.

1107
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,877
Hal, have you got paper and pencil?
We can send a telegram.

1108
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,316
- Washington? Washington's open.
- And Boston.

1109
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,435
Boston's very good.

1110
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,671
Can we go to Philadelphia, Detroit,
then come on back to New York?

1111
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:34,275
- Paul, aren't you excited?
- Yeah. It's wonderful.

1112
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,191
I wish them a lot of luck.

1113
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,837
- This kind of leaves us out.
- Why?

1114
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:45,397
With Tony doing the dances,
it's not going to be my kind of show.

1115
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,153
Yours, either. I don't want you to do it.

1116
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,070
I wouldn't think of leaving the show, Paul.

1117
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:56,711
- I've worked too hard on your career to...
- It's my career, and I want to stay.

1118
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:01,432
I'm taking the 9:00 train
tomorrow morning for New York.

1119
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,431
I expect you to be there.

1120
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,951
Have a nice trip, Paul.

1121
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,554
Dancers, singers, the sketches.

1122
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,591
Listen, kids,
it's going to mean rehearsing every day...

1123
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,070
all day, right up to curtain time.

1124
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:27,391
We're going to put in new numbers,
and learn them as fast as we can...

1125
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,199
and we're going to yank out all that junk.

1126
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,916
We've got our schedule all worked out,
and it looks pretty good now.

1127
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,992
Philadelphia, Boston, Pittsburgh...

1128
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,310
Washington, Baltimore...

1129
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,474
PHILADELPHIA

1130
01:19:55,560 --> 01:20:00,236
 I see a new sun up in a new sky 

1131

there'd be another man 

The scene's only about two minutes.
You won't have time to make the change.

1188
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,631
I know it's a rough deal,
but we won't make New York if we don't.

1189
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:57,474
- As much rehearsal time as possible.
- Better call them at 10:00.

1190

Don't forget, everybody.
Rehearsal, 10:00 on the dot, Baltimore.

1191
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:05,475
That case is important.
Tell you what we'll do, when we start.

1192
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,551
Say, who's the pretty girl?

1193
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,468
Why, this couldn't be
the mousy little Miss Gerard.

1194
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:14,030
You've been with the firm for years.
I've never seen you with glasses on.

1195
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:17,715

I'm sorry.

1199
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,872
- You must be tired.
- Yes, I am, a little.

1200
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:35,477
- Bet you are, too.
- A little.

1201
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:45,436
Lester, look, I've got a problem
with these two numbers.

1202
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,193
The murder mystery has a jazz beat
and I don't want it to...

1203
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:52,671
- Anyone heard from Paul Byrd?
- No, I haven't heard.

1204
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:55,877
As a matter of fact, nobody has.
At least they haven't mentioned it.

1205
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,190
- Wasn't he going to...
- What a rat.

1206
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:00,874
Rat? Lester, wait a second.

1207
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,673
He's a wonderful guy,
wonderful and talented.

1208
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,230
He's written... Listen, don't sell him short.
That boy has got a lot...

1209
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,949
He may be a little young, yes.
He needs a little more experience.

1210
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,315
- Just give him a few more years.
- Yeah.

1211
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,312
Probably when he settles down
and gets married.

1212
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,158
- You think he'll make a good husband?
- And how. Great.

1213
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,310
He'll make a great husband. Sure.

1214
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,072
Listen, this kid is solid.

1215
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:30,038
He knows all... It isn't gonna be easy. No.

1216
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:34,591
Marriage and the theatre and two careers.
Problems. It isn't all skittles.

1217
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,353
- It's no bed of...
- Is that why you never got married?

1218
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:42,150
Who, me? You know, I'm the kind of fella...

1219
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:45,630
You got the right slant.
You're pretty happy as you are.

1220
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,038
I like to kick around
and have a lot of laughs.

1221
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,758
Lester, I'm very much in love with this girl.

1222
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:08,436
It's ridiculous, I know,
things being as they are, but there it is.

1223
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:13,238
Look, Tony,
I don't know what the chances are...

1224
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:16,393
but wait till we get to New York,
and see how you stand.

1225
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,835
Personally, I think the girl's crazy
about you...

1226
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:23,232
but what you can see in a beautiful,
young and talented girl is beyond me.

01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,755
 These mugs were smart,
but they made one mistake. 

1326
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,193
 They got me mad. 

1327
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:50,670
DEM BONES CAFE

1328
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:15,229
 Suddenly, all the pieces fitted together.
I knew how the crime had been done. 

1329
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:18,232
 The high note on the trumpet
had shattered the glass. 

1330
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:37,910
 The glass with the nitro-glycerine. 

1331
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:42,952
 Now I knew who the killer was,
but it didn't matter anymore. 

1332
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,837
 Killers have to die. 

1333
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:23,837
 Another page in the casebook of Rod Riley
was finished. 

1334
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:27,550
 The city was asleep.
The joints were closed. 

1335
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:30,951
 The rats, the hoods,
and the killers were in their holes. 

1336
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:35,073
 I felt good, but something was missing. 

1337
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:40,596
 She was bad, she was dangerous. 

1338
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:43,672
 I wouldn't trust her any farther
than I could throw her. 

1339
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:47,073
 But she was my kind of woman. 

1340
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:20,954
- Who's that? Somebody come in?
- No one, Mr. Hunter.

1341
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:24,476
- You sure? Did you look out in the hall?
- Not a soul, Mr. Hunter.

1342
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:29,033
I can't understand it.
Are you sure this show's a hit?

1343
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:32,159
A very big hit, Mr. Hunter.
Congratulations.

1344
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:33,992
It certainly doesn't feel like one.

1345
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:38,358
I didn't expect them to pull my carriage
through the streets or hurl flowers at me...

1346
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,395
- Hal, come on, boy. Have a drink.
- No, thanks.

1347
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:45,472
- Got any notes for the cast for tomorrow?
- No.

1348
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,033
- Good night.
- Say, look.

1349
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:50,078
Doesn't anybody come backstage anymore
on opening nights?

1350
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:53,755
No. It's considered old-fashioned.
Have a good night's rest, Tony.

1351
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:58,398
Did Gaby go out with Paul?

1352
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:01,517
Gaby? I don't know. I guess so.
Good night, Tony.

1353
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:06,870
Bobby, you know what I'm going to do?

1354
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,269
I'm going out to the biggest nightclub
I can find.

1355
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,635
I'm going to get a glass of champagne
and celebrate.

1356
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:13,119
Fine idea, sir.

1357
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:26,157
 I'll go my way by myself 

1358
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:30,192
 All alone in a crowd 

1359
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:34,318
 I'll try to apply myself 

1360
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:38,074
 And teach my heart how to sing 

1361
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,956
 I'll go my way by myself 

1362
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,438
 Like a bird on the wing 

1363
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:50,758
 I'll face the unknown 

1364
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:54,877
 I'll build a world of my own 

1365
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:03,431
 He's a jolly good fellow
He's a jolly good fellow 

1366
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:06,797
 He's a jolly good fellow 

1367
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:11,113
 That nobody can deny
That nobody can deny 

1368
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:13,710
 That nobody can deny 

1369
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:17,110
 For he's a jolly good fellow 

1370
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:20,112
 That nobody can deny 

1371
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,110
Tony, the whole company got together.

1372
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:28,317
We all chipped in,
and we bought you... nothing.

1373
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,832
So we have nothing to give you...

1374
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:34,037
but our gratitude, our admiration...

1375
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,518
and our love.

1376
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:38,717
The show's a hit, but we all feel...

1377
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:42,679
no matter what might've happened to it,
it was wonderful knowing you...

1378
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,398
working with you.

1379
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:48,877
Maybe some of us didn't see eye to eye
with you at the beginning.

1380
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,599
Maybe we thought
we wouldn't work out together...

1381
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:53,559
but we have.

1382
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,948
Yes, there were obstacles between us...

1383
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,915
but we've kissed them good-bye.

1384
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:06,198
We've come to love you, Tony.
We belong together.

1385
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,116
The show's going to run a long time.

1386
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:15,119
As far as I'm concerned,
it's going to run forever.

1387
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:27,319
- Tony.
- May we say something?

1388
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:30,837
 A show that is really a show 

1389
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:34,356
 Sends you out with a kind of a glow 

1390
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:38,069
 And you say as you go on your way 

1391
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:41,628
 '"That's Entertainment! '" 

1392
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:45,159
 A song that is winging along 

1393
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:48,755
 or a dance with a touch of romance 

1394
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:52,310
 is the art that appeals to the heart 

1395
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:56,278
 That's Entertainment! 

1396
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:59,909
 Admit we're a hit
and we'll go on from there 

1397
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,958
 We played a charade
that was lighter than air 

1398
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,719
 A good old-fashioned affair 

1399
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:10,355
 As we sing this finale
we hope it was up your alley 

1400
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:13,637
 No death like you get in Macbeth 

1401
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:17,076
 No ordeal like the end of Camille 

1402
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:20,914
 This good-bye brings a tear to the eye 

1403
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,595
 The world is a stage
The stage is a world 

1404
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:29,117
 of entertainment 

1405
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,033
THE END

1406
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,918
