What's her talent
getting her here?

00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,050
I know all that, but
I produced her show.

136

Producers are a dime
a dozen in New York.

Well I wouldn't be the

what it would be like.

Just butting your head
up against a stone wall.

It would break your
heart and hers.

You wouldn't want to stand
in her way, would you?

148
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,440
Of course not.

149
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,280

642
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,810
But to make sure you're
not going to get well,

643
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:36,020
I will call in another doctor.

644
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,740
Now, the other doctor
told him that he

645
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,650
Was threatened with paralysis.

646
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,550
[LAUGHTER]

647
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:42,740
Why do you laugh, brother?

648
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,360
Don't you realize it's an
awful thing to be paralyzed?

649
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,660
Sure is, you feel so
rotten in the morning.

650
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,470
I don't know you, my friend,
but I think you show poor taste

651
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,630
To laugh at so
serious a subject.

652
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,370
Anyway, this man
finally came to us

653
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:59,510
And Doctor Dorando, whom I
shall introduce presently,

654
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,650
Diagnosed his case
as stomach trouble.

655
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,890
Friends, do you realize that the
death rate on stomach trouble

656
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:09,820
A year averages one
death per person.

657
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,250
Ah, you may laugh,
but that's a fact.

658
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,590
Doctor Dorando put
this man on a milk diet

659
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,780
Until he was strong enough
to take his medicine.

660
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,420
And that man would be alive
today it he hadn't a...

661
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,300
Died.

662
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,730
Oh no my friend, if
he hadn't held out

663
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,890
The Saturday night's
paycheck on his wife.

664
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:30,660
Now before I go on with my
talk I have a treat for you.

665
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,410
I should like to introduce
the Dorando and Davis

666
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,980
World famous quartet,
The Cats and the Fiddle.

667
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,630
Come along and swing
it for them, boys.

668
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,720
(SINGING) He's the man
that smokes that jive.

669
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,630
That jive will take
you for a dive.

670
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:57,050
One sip you will arrive.

671
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,190
When you smoke
that killin' jive.

672
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,180
It will make you very tall.

673
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,650
Seems that if you're
going to fall,

674
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,480
Knock yourself out for a ride.

675
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,880
I mean that killin' jive.

676
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,320
You will think
you'll blow your top.

677
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,730
Baby you start laughing
and you can't stop.

678
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,810
Now won't you give
him a smile 'cause

679
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:20,610
He's a sad man not bad man.

680
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:23,050
Everything will seem so funny.

681
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,980
Darkest days will seem so sunny.

682
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:30,730
That feeling will arrive when
you smoke that killin' jive.

683
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:56,570
[SCAT SINGING]

684
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,790
Sad man not bad man.

Everything will seem so funny.

Darkest days will seem so sunny.

687
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,130
That feeling will arrive when
you're a high man, [INAUDIBLE]

688
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,100
Man, you're in the sky, man.

689
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,080
You're on the rip, man.

690
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,220
You'll been so mellow,
just like a jello

691
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,840
When you smoke
that killin' jive.

692
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,430
Hey, Duke sure knows
how to get 'em, don't he?

693
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,670
You telling me?

694
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,370
And now for the real
treat of the evening.

695
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,620
It gives me a great
deal of pleasure

696
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:19,100
To introduce Doctor Dorando, the
discoverer of Universal Elixir,

697
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,400
Himself in person...
Doctor Dorando.

698
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,870
[APPLAUSE]

699
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,980
Yes, it's a man that
has done more for mankind

700
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,980
With his Universal
Elixir than all

701
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,750
The doctors in the
world put together.

702
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,580
What he has done to
others, he can do to you.

703
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,020
The doctor will sit
by my side to verify

704
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,260
Any and all statements
that I may make.

705
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,290
Is that so, Doctor?

706
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,840
Oh, yes, yes indeed.

707
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,240
Friends, as I look
over your smiling faces

708
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,750
The thought comes to me
that a lot of those smiles

709
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,640
May be covering up
sickness and suffering.

710
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,070
Maybe some of you are
suffering with rheumatism.

711
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,880
Here are some copper
neutralizing rings

them don't you Doctor?

713
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,730
Oh, yes, indeed.

714
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,870
Guaranteed to keep
away rheumatism.

715
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,050
Just think friends, we're
giving away free these marvelous

716
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:19,590
Manifestations of
modern science.

And here, here are some
chestnuts all the way

718
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:25,120
From the land of
the East Indies,

719
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,630
The land of mystic and magic.

720
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,890
Put one of these
in your hip pocket

721
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:32,620
And you'll never be
bothered with sciatica.

722
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,500

got a hip pocket.

Be bothered with sciatica.

Neighbors, we only
have a limited supply,

Now I tell you what I'm going
to do, when I ring this bell,

When I ring it again,
the sale will stop,

738

Ah, how time has
flown on golden wings,

And tonight we have reached
the pinnacle of our success.

ladies and gentlemen.

804
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,080
This is a spotter
with a spot of news.

805
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,400
Hottest hot spot, Ferdie
Fenton's Century Club,

806
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,780
Has as cooled off after
the first presentation

807
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:44,210
Of a new review featuring the
erstwhile Bronze Nightingale,

808
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:47,770
Ethel Andrews, who still wobbles
a swell pair of pipes, but is

809
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:49,640
Nixed when it comes to
filling the heavy spot

810
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,280
On the Broadway biggie.

811
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,150
Some of the blame,
or maybe all of it,

812
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:56,290
Pins on Fenton, for trying
to rush the gal from sticks

To steeples in a
few weeks and one

00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,970
Marshall who authorized
this one should

815
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:03,040
Be forced to eat raw egg...

816
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,630
Look, Mr. Fenton, I
can dope this show.

817
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:05,880
Not on my money.

818
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,620
I must have been dope when
I let you talk me into it.

819
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,040
That girl's a
specialty, not a star.

820
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,170
Well, why not go back
to her first setup?

821
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,210
Remember when you first
saw her in Philadelphia?

822
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:16,420
Fill her as a single.

823
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,540
Remember her rave notices?

824
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,290
Remember the variety?

825
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,320
Yes, I remember
and I'm thinking

826
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,160
About what variety
will do to me now.

827
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,950
As a producer, Marshall,
your a good agent.

828
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,860
Back to the sticks, I'm through.

829
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:40,910
From pinnacle to pit to
bottomless pit, that's me.

830
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:43,620
Don Dorando's
wonderful discovery

831
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:47,610
Is headed for a drainpipe
instead of [INAUDIBLE], and all

832
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,940
Because of that devilish device.

That broadcasting operators,
why, I have a mind to bust...

834
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,950
You understand, Doc, Don't ya?

835
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:00,850
Say, Duke, can I drive
you down to the station?

836
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,250
No, Dippy, thanks.

837
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,770
I'd rather walk.

838
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,760
I want to be by myself.

839
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,240
Well, so long, fellows.

840
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,790
ELLA: Oh, so that does
mean something to you.

841
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:20,940
Where we heading, honey?

842
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:21,710
South?

843
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:24,950
No, we're moving to
another apartment.

844
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:27,330
We can't afford all this now.

845
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:31,710
A fortune teller told me
once that I was a, a cyclist.

846
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:32,990
A what?

847
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:36,250
Somebody who can see things
that some people can't.

848
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:38,530
Oh, you mean a psychic.

849
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,760
That's it, a cyclist.

850
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,600
Well, I've been having notions
about somebody down South.

851
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,580
And I'm trying to
forget the South.

852
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,620
You're kidding yourself, honey.

853
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,140
Anyway, Duke's
down there and I've

854
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,390
Got a hunch he's in trouble.

855
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:53,400
Maybe he's broke.

856
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,050
Not much.

857
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:59,480
Your forgetting a little matter
of $5,000 he sold me for.

858
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,910
Now, you listen to me.

859
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:04,050
I've been hiding a lie and
it's time somebody came clean.

860
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,570
If Duke won't, I will.

861
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,100
Then I don't want to
hear anything about it...

862
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,530
You're going to hear
what I've got to say

863
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,100
And it's all about him.

Duke Davis double
crossed himself for you.

865
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:14,500
He wrote that $5,000
check and didn't

866
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,360
Take a dime for Marshall.

867
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,520
He thought he was
standing in your way.

Well, am I invited in?

what you did for me.

And I just found out
what they did to you.

You can't hurt him,
it wasn't his fault.

Hurt him?
