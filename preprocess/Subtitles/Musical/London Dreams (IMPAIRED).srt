1
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,688
'In the next one minute my
dream wiII be fuIfiIIed.'

2
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:45,526
'This dream came into existence
along with me.'

3
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,040
I have done some good, some bad..'

4
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,216
'..and some very bad deeds
to achieve this dream.'

5
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,118
'But I don't regret any of it.'

6
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,221
'Show me one person in the worId..'

7
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,725
'..who hasn't done some thing
good, something bad..'

8
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:15,230
'..or some thing very bad,
to achieve his biggest dream.'

9
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,067
'Even if there is some one..'

10
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,399
'..it doesn't make a
difference to me.'

11
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:27,741
'Because, my dream wiII be
fuIfiIIed in next 30 seconds.'

12
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,412
30 seconds to go, Arjun.

13
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:54,764
'It aII started in Punjab
during my schooI days.'

14
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,945
ChiIdren, one by one telI mew hat
you wish to become when you grow up?

15
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,810
I want to be a piIot.
- I'm a doctor.- I'm a Iawyer.

16
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,550
And you,Arjun?

17
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,278
I want to be Michael Jackson.

18
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,518
Keep quiet.

19
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,094
That means you want to be
a pop star, Arjun.

20
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,793
Have you toId this your father?

21
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,566
'Have you Iost your mind?'

22
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,965
'Remember, no one from this famiIy
has ever been associated with music.'

23
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,732
'IfI ever hear you even humming again..'
'..I'II skin you alive.

24
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,136
Get back to work.'

25
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:36,146
I didn't ask your friend there.

26
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,909
Teacher, I don't want to grow up onIy.

27
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,348
There are many probIems
in growing up.

28
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,517
'Music is my hobby..
everything forme.'

29
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,349
'And, I wanted to carve
aniche for myseIf.'

30
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,358
Mannu, I want to reach to the top.

31
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,727
Any how.At any cost.

32
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,062
If you want to become a
successfuI pop star go ahead.

33
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,568
What's the probIem?

34
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,264
Father. He'II make me sIave
to death in his restaurant.

35
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,343
Why does your father
hate music so much?

36
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,376
Because of my grandfather.

37
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,481
Father beIieves my grandfather
is the one responsibIe..

38
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,210
..for the sorry state of our famiIy today.

39
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,186
He keeps praying everyday..
..that I for sake my hobby of music.

40
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:55,054
And, I pray everyday as welI that,
''How can you Iisten to him?''.

41
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,491
'God bestowed me with
the knack for music.'

42
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,491
'He even gave me the taIent to Iearn music.'

43
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,733
'Then, how couId He take
me away from music?'

44
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,403
'How couId He keep me from
achieving my fame in music?'

45
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,873
So Lord, cIear every obstruction
in my path to success.

46
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:16,845
Stupid, you wish in such a detaiIed pattern
along with the reasons.

47
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,915
Doesn't the Lord get bored of you?

48
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,081
Just watch, Mannu, God wiII sureIy
do something for me.

49
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:29,892
What is the matter?

50
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,623
'UnknowingIy, I hadwished
for my father's death.'

51
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:11,130
'God had cIeared aII the
obstructions in my path.'

52
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,973
'In return,
I made apromise to Him.'

53
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,476
'TIII I fuIfiII my dream..'

54
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,141
'..I won't Iet anything distract me.'

55
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,019
UncIe...

56
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,164
Arjun.Arjun.

57
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:55,004
I wanted to get a piano.
But it was too heavy.

58
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:59,178
Here, pIay this fIuteand be happy.

59
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,719
Your father hated music, and so do I.

60
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,720
Every member of our famiIy does.

61
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,722
Andwe also have a reason for it.

62
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:46,562
If you ever pIay it again,
I'II smash it to pieces.

63
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,695
Get that.

64
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:49,897
Go to sIeep.

65
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,384
Arjun,where are you going?

66
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,186
Arjun. Arjun, Iisten to me.

67
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,263
PoIice, catch that boy.
- Stop.

68
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,765
Arjun, stop.
- Stop.

69
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,429
Arjun.

70
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,436
Listen to me.

71
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,739
You'II Iearn music by practicing.

72
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,394
'Days, months and years.'

73
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,799
I never kept track of them,
Iike normaI peopIe.'

74
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:52,074
'The onIything I kept track of..'
'..was how much I have Iearned,

75
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,973
and how much I stiII have to.'

76
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,809
'When I feIt my preparations
were good enough

77
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,984
I feIt the urge to audition
Iike every musician.'

78
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,482
'When I didn't achieve anything..'

79
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,353
'..I thought, God has written
my story differentIy.'

80
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,121
'That's why I decided to
take a different path.'

81
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,707
FIre it up.

82
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,006
Fire up the burning desire in your heart.

83
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,013
Flareit up.

84
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,511
FIare up those amber fIames.

85
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:41,524
No one here understands you.

86
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:49,362
Turn your seIf into bIazing fIames,
and touch the sky.

87
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,563
Move a head, melt away.

88
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,300
You're Iike Iava. Gush out.

89
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:05,042
Carve your way,
make your path. Go ahead.

90
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,448
''You'rea fIame, a fIame, a fIame.

Giveme a minute,

143
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,147
Two minutes..two minutes,

144
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,482
Even if you had two days, and

145
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,623
..you wouIdn't have had
a chance with her.

146
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,225
I needed just two minutes, and you know it.

147
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,362
Arjun, can I ask you something?

If any one's getting anything for free in Iife,

00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,856
And you Iet a girI sIip away?.

153
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,142
Name.. Arjun..
what is the connection?

154
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,377
When you aren't focused about your goaI
you tend to miss the mark

155
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,709
If you deviate from the path,
you Iose your destination.

156
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:34,984
My destination,

157
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,655
my goaI is something else.

158
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,654
And not your deIightfuI butter chicken

159
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,724
Byt he way, do me a favour.

160
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,953
DeIiver my stuff to this address.

161
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,397
GoaI is something eIse.

162
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,330
I hope everything is normal.

163
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,199
Stupid, he wants to achieve
something in Iife..

164
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,340
..and he's focused on that.
- RealIy?.- Yes.

165
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,000
You know what I think?
I think he swings theother way.

166
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,181
This guy is begging for an audition.

167
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,325
He is desperate.
Yes, it's the sort ofhunger I Iike.

168
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,357
I'II teII you what.

'UsualIy, after a successfuI show
you've to head for a nice party.'

171
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,551
'But I went to jaiI.'

172
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,819
'But, I had no regrets.'

173
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,758
'Maybe because everyone

174
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,728

175
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,399
'Now. I was sure..'

176
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,898
'..God had written my story differentIy,
just Iike His.'

177
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,907
'That's why I didn't Ioose my hope.'

178

'Even the poIiceIet me

179
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,245
'The chance that I never
got was waiting for me.'

180
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,251
'FinaIIy, the new chapter of
my Iife had finaIIy begun.

215
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,132
First, pay my dues and the you can caII as much as you
want

216
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:06,177
HeIIo.
- Hey Arjun,what's going on?

217
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,477
Mannu.

218
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,812
You don't have to say anything..

219
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,785
I know you've won. I can sense
the joy in your voice.

220
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:13,923
You've gone crazy.

221
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,095
I know you've made London
go crazy for you.

222
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,193
Mannu, I just..

223
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,161
Have you been sIeeping with any
Iovely Iadies there or not?

224
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,559
Why do you waste your money on
such useless conversations?

225
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,294
They've tormented us for 200 years.

226
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,631
It shouId be equal.

227
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,173
That's how you waste money
on ISD for such non sense.

228
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,012
This is not non sense, it's history.

229
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,577
You calI meten times a week.
Have you won aIottery?

230
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:41,378
No. The ISDrates here just got cheaper.

231
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,611
Therates havegot cheaper,
butnot free.

232
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,312
When are you paying my dues?

233
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:49,191
I said I'II pay you on the 25th.
- That's what you say every month.

234
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,426
Mannu, it's an ISD calI. TaIk to me.

235
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,860
Arjun, just a minute..

236
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,157
..I'm just giving a coin to a beggar.

237
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,164
I toId you before,
I'II pay you on the 25th.

238
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,735
But in which month?

239
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,202
In any month, but I sureIy wiII.

240
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,439
That's my promise.
Now can I taIk to my friend?

241
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,771
AII you can do is make promises, Mannu.
- I know.

242
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:11,210
It won't be a promise if I fuIfiI it.

243
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,043
Why you..

244
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,049
What's that racket?

245
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:18,450
Nothing.AII of Punjab is happy
about your achievement.

246
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,716
They are asking me to
disconnect the phone..

247
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:24,350
When are you coming to Bhatinda?
- Soon.

248
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,053
This is just the beginning,.

249
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:27,526
HeIIo.

250
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,063
HeIIo..

251
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,563
Do you think you're KhaIIi?

252
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,071
Do you want to stay aIivetiII the 25th?

253
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,578
My dreams haven't been fuIfiIIed yet.

254
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,586
Here.

255
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,586
You're going to take us here for a treat.
- Yes.

256
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,592
What's wrong?
- No,this is very good, actuaIIy.

257
00:24:58,797 --> 00:24:59,729
Nice, isn't it?

258
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,956
ChiII, bro. You won't have to
eat here for Iong.

259
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,763
Soon,we'II beeating in

260
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,271

00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,311
No, address him as sir.

266
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,010
Yesterday, he took alI of London

267
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,348
Today,we'II win BIock Buster

00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:52,978

BIock Buster audition's

293

Okay,that's it.

Hey, Sita-Gita.

299
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,956
Neither Sita nor Gita. It's Priya.

300
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,724
I found out that you'recoming here

Now I'm convinced he's normaI.

305
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,642
Do you go to a fancy dress
competition everyday..

00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,780
..orchanging your Iook
is just ahobby..

307
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,108
I mean, at times Sita
and at times Gita.

308
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:15,343
It's not myhobby, but my helpIessness.
- Meaning?

309
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,612
I was born in a very
conservative Iyer famiIy.

310
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,529
Just Iike a princess.

311
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,637
Just Iike a Goddess.

312
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:54,891
Papa didn't Iet me go a head of
Bharatnatyam.

313
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:58,722
And the pop music inside me
keeps drawing me towards this.

314
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,001
How do you controI yourseIf?.

315
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,405
I guess I'm not as brave as you,Arjun.

316
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,078
WouId you Iike to audition with our band?

00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,079
At Ieast, don't Iet theartist inside you die.

319
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:29,621
Excuseme,what shouId I do?

320
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,591
ChiII.Just go with the fIow.

321
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,900
Isn't he the same guy

322
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,435
Yes, itis.

325
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,316
But I've waited aII my Iife for this.

326
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,423
I'm afraid you'II have to wait some more.

00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,092
PIease, sir.

328
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,452
This song is more than
four and half minutes.

329
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,789
And you're going to take more than
a minute to get out of here.

330
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:07,555
I'm going to sing.

There's a tune on our Iips..
''..and ajourneyunder our feet.''

338
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:08,683
The destination is far.
''And rhythm in our breath.''

339
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:12,392
We'II keep humming.

464
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,834
You..(mocking anger)

465
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:30,083
We'renot different,
but one and the same.

466
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:34,287
Friends arenever apart.

467
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:39,834
If one is hurt,the other
feels the pain.

468
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:44,167
Friends are never a part.

469
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,138
Our friendship is sweet.

470
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,073
Sweeter than water.

471
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,872
Come, Iet's ceIebrate.

472
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,640
Come, Iet's dance.

473
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:58,584
He knows the sorrows dweIIing
in your heart.

474
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,987
Imparts happiness in
every condition.

475
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:10,327
Friends, Iifeis meaningIess
without friendship.

476
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:17,838
Life is meaningIess.. ''..meaningIess..
meaningIess without friendship.''

477
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:24,572
Life is meaningIess.. ''..meaningIess..
meaningIess without friendship.''

478
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:12,292
Life is meaningIess.. ''..meaningIess..
meaningIess without friendship.''

479
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:18,628
Life is meaningIess.. ''..meaningIess..
meaningIess without friendship.''

480
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,214
So,what did you do after I Ieft?

481
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:43,788
You were working hard
and I was fIirting hard

482
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:47,828
You became famous,
and I was getting infamous.

483
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,496
Do you seethatstar?

484
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:53,501
Where?

485
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,009
That one, which is shining the brightest.

486
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:03,840
Yes. - I want to shinein
the worId just Iikethat.

487
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,448
One day,the two of us wiII be
shining just Iike that star.

488
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,115
Yes,wewiII.

489
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,889
You fooI, there is onIy onestar..

490
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,360
..and onIy one person who
deserves to shine Iike it.

491
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,692
And that is you my brother.

492
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,239
As a chiId, I wouId always
feeI jealous of you.

493
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,908
But why?

494
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,806
Because, your father wouId run after you
with the musical instrument.

495
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:39,312
And my father, wouId always
try to keep meaway from it.

496
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,278
But stiII I kept getting
drawn towards music.

497
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,213
Because, I never had any interest
in anything else.

498
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,491
And, even ifI did feeI something..

499
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,296
..I didn't Iet it burden myheart.

500
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,896
Because, I'veaI ready come aIong way..

501
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,070
..but my destination is
stiII now here cIose.

502
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:03,573
There's a stadium in London.

503
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:04,739
WembIey.

504
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,408
I want to singthere one day.

505
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,739
And I want every person
that comes there..

506
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,847
..to know my name.

507
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:25,294
This is the same pIace, because
of which father hated music.

508
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:29,464
I used to keep asking you
since chiIdhood that

509
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,569
..why did your father
hate music so much?

510
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,295
Why?

511
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:44,274
Grandfather was a weII-known
Sufi singerin Punjab.

512
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,287
One day,the government
sent him to takepart..

513
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:01,291
..in a cuIturaI event,
organised at WembIey.

514
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,732
It was his first chance to
sing amongst thousands.

515
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:11,966
But seeing the huge crowd,
he just couIdn't sing.

516
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:18,647
When he was given this big chance
his music faiIed him.

517
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:20,977
He couIdn't sing.

518
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:27,490
He feIt that he had
Iet down his country.

519
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,622
And committed suicide.

520
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:34,763
Andthat's why, Mannu,

521
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,325
this triumph at WembIey..

522
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,169
..is veryi mportant to me.

523
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:44,340
Very important.

524
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:50,012
Hey serious man, you made mecry.

525
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,447
You made a stone shed tears.

526
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,009
Lord, Iisten to my brother.

527
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:59,012
Bro, Iisten to me.

528
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,213
Before your this brother

529
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,292
dies of hunger and you have to sing

530
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,519
mourning songs for me..

531
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:12,530
..Iet's go to the restaurant
and have something to eat.

532
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:15,536
Two butter chicken,
two cottage cheese curry..

533
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:19,675
..two meat curry,two roasted chicken,
two bIack IentiIs..

534
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:20,705
..two fried rice..

535
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,879
Do you want to finish everything here?

536
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,015
This restaurant won't
run out of food soon.

537
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,649
This is Punjab.

538
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:28,875
Give that free loader some food.

539
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,553
Comes here every day to hog for free.

540
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:32,051
Listen..

541
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,556
How much do you manage to earn?

542
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:35,721
Earn?

543
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:37,818
'How much do I oweaII of you?'

544
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:40,258
'Me first, you oweme Rs.20000.

545
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,490
Rs.15250.35.'

546

don't forget the 30 paise.'

547
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,703
'Rs.98.45.

548
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,845
Do as I say. SettIe that with your account.'

549
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,343
'Why shouId I do that?.'

550
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:59,448
'It wiII take me two days to
total the dues you oweme.'

551
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,914
Then I suggest that you come
after two days onIy.'

552
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:08,083
I earn enough to make my ends
meet, no credits at aII.

553
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,623
I'm enjoying.

554
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,089
But, how many weddings
take pIace in a year?

555
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,455
How do you manage your
house hoId expenses?

556
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,755
House?

557

00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:15,590
'..and paying three
times your dues.'

00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,460
'So, he shouId have aII
the comforts here.'

560
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,934
'And I need every thing that
every rich man has.'

561
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:25,040
'What do they have?'

'A keep.
- Yes, yes.'

567
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:37,850
'Except for the Iast one,

568
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:43,516
Mannu needs everything else..'
'..here by this evening.'

569
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:46,127
'Fine, now that he'II be paying
three times more..'

570
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,126
'..we'II have to do that much.'

571
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,992
There's nothing Iacking
in the house..'

572
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,461
'..come and see for your seIf.'

573
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:53,461
We'ver eached.

574
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,070
You'II go crazy when you see the bedroom.

575
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,079
Do you wear that girI's top too?

576
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:14,155
No. The girIs keep coming
here in transit.

577
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,657
The chiIdren must becoming
in transitas welI then.

578
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,566
No. This is the ''Beprepared'' poIicy.

579
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:25,928
Look, I'II sureIy get married someday.

580
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:27,763
That's why I'vebought
this dress ingtabIe.

581
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,870
Now, once I get married..
..I'II sure Iy have chiIdren.

582
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:30,539
And since I'II have chiIdren..

583
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,265
..I wouId be needing this cradIe.

584
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,704
You don't worry.

585
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,606
Your friend is welI respected here.

586
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:36,836
Now, just sIeep.

This viIIagers Ioves mea Iot.

You fooIs! You couId've at Ieast waited
for him to wakeup.

589
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,986
Forget it. You said, he'II cIear your
dues once he arrives.

590
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,457
He arrived, hummed a song,
and also feII asIeep.

591
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:55,188
No, I said whiIe Ieaving.
It's my mistake..

592
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,966
..I shouIdn't say anything
to you cheap peopIe.

593
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,431
How many times have I toId you..

594
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,073
1 pound is equaI to 80 rupees.

595
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:07,976
My friend has no probIem in paying
three times the amount.

596
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,373
Come on the 25th and
take your money. Go now.

597
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:14,548
Fine, tomorrow is the 25th. Isn't it?

Mannu, don't tryto run.

Now, one, two,three,

602
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,489
You don't understand,

603
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:29,893
They won't Iet me go.

604
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,761
You'II haveto come with me to Bhatinda airport.

605
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,664
You don't understand.

606
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,667
The viIIagers wiII think
I'm going to London with you.

607
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,567
They'II be heart-broken.

Before the viIIagers give

I'II sit with you for a whiIe.

612
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,753
And then, I'II jump from
the speeding train.

613
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,583
Comeon, comeon.

614
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,194
Hey station master, make the train

615
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,761
Mannu, you forgot about us didn't you?

616

00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,936

They Iove you three times more now.

632
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,965
These scoundreIs have
no Iove for any human.

633
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,836
They just Iove the three
times the money they got.

634
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,033
So,finalIy you managed
to come on the 25th.

OnIy one week is Ieft for the concert, guys.
Consider that, the four of us.

645
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:08,323
Not four, but five.

646
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:09,753
Who is the fifth one?
- Mannu.

647
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,326
Is he any good? - I've heard him sing.
He's good.

648
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,396
Priya, you pick him up
from the Airport. - Yeah, sure.

649
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,232
Here you are, Mr. Mannu.

650
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:27,409
You know my name.

651
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,047
What's your name?
- Ann.

652
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,477
These airIine peopIe make
you wear a name pIate.

653
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:37,584
Doesn't it hurt?

654
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,913
No, sir.

655
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,749
Are you from Punjab?
- Excuseme, sir.

656
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,419
Excuse me.

657
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,812
Indiais so odd.

658
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,608
There are pothoIes on the road.
And pothoIes in the air as weII.

659
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:10,780
Where's water?

660
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,289
Water,water, water.

661
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,460
Up there.

662
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,468
The oId man Iied to me.

663
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:38,307
This is how you ruIed India
for 200 years? By Iying?

664
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,885
Here you go, sir.
- What is this? I asked for water.

665
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,490
You want to get me drunk.

666
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:51,820
Do you want to take advantage?

667
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,419
Now that you've brought it,then..

668
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:58,328
..get mesomegrams aIong with
onions also. - Sure sir.

669
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:04,303
She's abomb.

670
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,998
Why don't you shut up?
But why?

671
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:09,601
You've already crossed that age.

672
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,838
These things are not meant for you.

673
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,355
Where's the wash room?

674
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,867
Sir, sir, sir..

675
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,263
Sir, the washroom's that way.

676
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:36,701
This is the exit door of the pIane.

677
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,299
Thank God you toId me.

678
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,208
Or else, the entire city
wouId've been drenched.

679
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:49,875
This is an EngIish one.

680
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,381
This drunk passenger in
the first cIass cabin..

681
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,887
..is driving mein sane.

682
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:58,424
Hey, Ann..there's no
water in the tank.

683
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:02,894
Sir, it's a vacuum Iavatory,
you don't need water in it.

684
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:06,091
The entire wasteis coIIected
in a bin,

685
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,067
below the cabinet through suction.
- ReaIIy?.

686
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,336
Then, cIose the fIap.

687
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:16,205
FIap? What fIap?
- I mean, the door.

688
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:21,749
Fine, sir I'II cIose the fIap.
- I mean, the door.

689
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:40,195
You see, first time Iast time pIane.

690
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:41,870
I aIways traveI by buIIock cart.

691
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,206
BuIIock cart.

692
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,111
Sorry sir. You've got
to go through again.

693
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:03,455
Sorry sir, we've to strip you.

694
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,190
Strip? What strip? Don't strip.

695
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:09,592
Sir..- Sir, you'II have to take your cIothes
off for security reasons.

696
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,357
Is that so?

697
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:24,707
Any body to see Manjeet KhosIa..
..arriving from Chandigarh..

698
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,643
Wow! Announcement.

699
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,644
Seems Iike a big guy.

700
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:43,257
I'd swaIIowed a 25 paise coin in my chiIdhood
and it hasn't come out yet.

701
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:44,990
I'm tired of expIaining it to them.

702
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,533
But they don't seem to understand.

703
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,864
This didn't come out.

704
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,338
And, I didn'tIet them take this off.
Or eIse.

705
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:21,026
Champion, are you Iaughing at me?

706
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,365
I can open any knot but
I can't seem to open this tie.

707
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:44,217
You wait here..

708
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,892
I'II get the car.

709
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:54,733
I Iove you.

710
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:00,334
Okay.

711
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,748
You were dazzled to see
mein my underwear.

712
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:10,744
How nice.
You seem to be on a roII.

713
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,751
Hey, birdy.

Hi.

717
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:21,889
Doesn't this nose ring pain you?

718
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:25,090
WeIcome to London.
- - I'm Mannu.-Zoheb.

719
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:31,739
These two brothers that you
have here are just great.

720
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:32,999
If I take them back to Punjab..

721
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:35,769
..Raja-Rani BandwiII be
reaIIy famous in Punjab.

722
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,606
He's great fun.

723
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:39,782
ShaII we get down to work?

724
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:42,110
I know what I have to do.

725
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,013
Take me around London.

726
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,949
What wouId you Iike to see?
Buckingham PaIace?

727
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:47,952
The museum wiII be best for him.

728
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:50,091
Then, we'II take him
to Madame Tussauds.

729
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:52,625
London Eye.
- Not just London's eyes..

730
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,888
..show me London's entire body.

731
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,965
Show me something that wiII
make me settIe back here.

732
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,803
He's my type. AIIow me.

733
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:17,314
Hey, Iisten, Iisten this is a
mind-bIowing pIace.

734
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,748
Listen guys.
Zoheb.Zoheb.

735
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:25,651
Aren't you going?

736
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,333
Hey,Zoheb.
- Zoheb, here's your girIfriend.

737
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:33,099
Listen,take good care of her,

738
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,498
and don't make her sad ever.
Listen..

739
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,168
Let it be.

740
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,041
That was fun.

741
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:48,047
I'm in Iove. With London,
with the peopIe here..

742
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:52,347
..the alcohoI,the bars here and..

743
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,119
Priya.

744
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:01,860
You are not her type.

745
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:07,034
I know. OnIy I am my type.

746
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,733
She's not some Punjabi
girI from your viIIage.

747
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,501
I know. She's from Chennai

748
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:16,735
But,that's okay..our pairing

749
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:20,382
has been designed by God

750
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:23,542
Hi..how are you?
Good.

751
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:26,215
What are you doing?

752
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:27,889
Look,when the dispIayis so good..

753
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:28,887
..just think about thereal deaI.

754
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:32,550
Comeon, I'm going.

755
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,059
Comeon. Comeon.

756
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:35,389
No.

757
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,898
Let's go.

758
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,710
It was a big mistake.

759
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,503
It was a big mistake.

760
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,672
Why did we throw them out?.

761
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:56,579
They gave us train, schooI,
post offices..

762
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:57,810
..constructed roads for us.

763
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:59,750
If we had Iet them stay
for another 20 years..

764
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:02,424
..they wouId've given us this too.

765
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:11,759
What pIace is this?

766
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:20,266
After seeing alI this .I'm craving
very strongIy for Iove.

767
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:23,934
You reaIIy think I can faII
in Iove with a man Iike you?

768
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:25,045
You aIways say no to me.

769
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:26,875
And I do alI this to
make you jeaIous.

770
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,380
Just say yes once,
and I wiII change.

771
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:31,109

Sir, what does music mean to you?

900
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,354
There's music in the
sighing of a reed.

901
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:02,524
There's music in the
gushing of a riII.

902

There's music in aII the things.

908
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:23,377
I don't know how and when I
started to havean interest.

909
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:26,608

My mother said I Iearnt everything

01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:48,220
This is nonsense.

930
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:50,622
They shouId be asking
these questions to you.

931
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:53,692
What's wrong with him?

932
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:55,802
What's music to you?

933
01:12:58,507 --> 01:12:59,633
It's my Iife.

934
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,977
I can't breathe without it.

935
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,244
And I can't even sIeep without it.

936
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:10,648
If it's with you,

937
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:12,150
Iifeis meaningfuI.

938
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,815
If not, Iifeis meaningIess.

939
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:21,694
The truth is everything
that seems odd to say..

940
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:24,457
..sounds wonderfuI to sing.

941
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:27,499
And that's why, there's music
aII around in the worId.

942
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,832
Jai Hind.

943
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:43,843
What?.

944
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:48,019
Did you hear..what I just said?

945
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:49,687
About music.

946
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:53,689
About you.

947
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,691
Didn't you remember this
in CaIista's house?

948
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,690
That who is your Iife?

949
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:00,903
Who you can't sIeep without?

950
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:02,165
Who you can't even breathe without?

951
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:05,033
Etc.. Etc.. Etc..

952
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:10,300
Just say yes, and I'II get rid ofthese
CaIistas and Baristas.

953
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:12,711
Never.

954
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:22,557
You can't actpossessive without
expressing your Iove. Get that?.

955
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:28,388
Just the tune has been
finalised for now.

956
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,428
We'II finalise the rhythm
and words Iater.

957
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:31,564
F-minor.

958
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:42,908
What have you done to my heart?

959
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:50,074
(My heart) ''Just doesn't
beIong to meany more.''

960
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:56,115
What have you done to my heart?

961
01:14:56,325 --> 01:15:03,254
I've just Iost my heart.

962
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,269
It's a hit, a hit. Brother,
it's a big hit.

963
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:09,968
Late again.

964
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,231
I had a Iittle too much Iast night.

965
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:15,342
But Arjun, that me treon which
you've composed the song..

966
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:17,011
..I was speII-bound.

967
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:19,510
Come down, and take your notations.

968
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:20,909
I don't need any notations.

969
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:23,550
Once my brother has sung it,
it's alI memorised here. That's aII.

970
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:25,014
You memorised it after
hearing it just once.

971
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,085
That's my styIe.

972
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:31,089
I don't make my brother repeat things.

973
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:33,454
Brother, give me some space.

974
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:35,794
What a meter you've chosen.

975
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:41,727
You know, you can make such
wonderfuI tunes on this meter.

976
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:44,735
Look, your tune in
Hindi movie styIe.

977
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:56,149
What have you done to my heart?

978
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:03,486
(My heart) ''Just doesn't
beIong to meany more.''

979
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:11,159
What have you done to my heart?

980
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:17,330
(My heart) ''Just doesn't
beIong to meany more.''

981
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:23,342
Brother, Europeis beautifuI.

982
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,849
And Iisten, if you take
this on G-major..

983
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,779
..and my brother here, gives 82 trebIe.

984
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:31,247
The tune wiII beat tonishing.

985
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,261
What have you..

986
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:54,036
What have you done to my heart?

987
01:16:54,943 --> 01:17:01,212
(My heart) ''Just doesn't
beIong to meany more.''

988
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:07,116
What have you done to my heart?

989
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:12,885
(My heart) ''Just doesn't
beIong to meany more.''

990
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:23,903
What have you..

991
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,700
Thank you,thank you.

992
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,400
And this is hip-hop.

993
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:41,751
What have you done to my heart?

994
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:46,256
I've just Iost my heart.

995
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,760
What have you done to my heart?

996
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:55,595
I've just Iost my heart.

997
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:06,444
So, Iadies and gentIemen.

998
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:09,879
Let's get to brother's
Meter and his styIe.

999
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:22,795
What have you done to my heart?

1000
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:29,803
(My heart) ''Just doesn't
beIong to meany more.''

1001
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:31,804
Just doesn't be Iong to me

1002
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:40,479
What have you done to my heart?

1003
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:46,988
(My heart) ''Just doesn't
beIong to meany more.''

1004
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,921
Just doesn't be Iong to me

1005
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:09,503
'WhiIes truggIing with Iife''
I tried to Iock horns with God.'

1006
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:13,670
'I asked Him, ''If You gave
me obsession of music..''

1007
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:16,176
..why did You give
the talent to Mannu?

1008
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:19,020
What was Iacking in my efforts?

1009
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:22,614
Which sacrificedid I
stiII need to make?

1010
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:26,691
What was the reason to
give him the magic..

1011
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:29,693
..who considered alI
of this a joke?

1012
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:32,630
What was the reason to
give Mannu such a voice?

1013
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:35,025
'If Mannu hadn't been my friend..'

1014
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:38,029
'..I wouId've asked
for something eIse.'

1015
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,203
'But Mannu was my friend,

1016
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:43,704
that's why I asked God..'

1017
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:46,008
..to give my friend
aII the happiness.

1018
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:48,045
To give him fame and fortune.

1019
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:51,217
But give me a talent Iike him.

1020
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:53,216
Because, onIy I have a right on it.

1021
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:54,547
OnIy me.

1022
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:00,888
Just me.

1023
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:10,237
Attention pIease.

1024
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,903
And with that, you become my wife.

1025
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:16,076
Attention pIease.

1026
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:29,922
Tour. We're going on atour.
- Tour?

1027
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:49,433
How are the girIs there?

1028
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:55,707
Party.

1029
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:59,787
WiII there be girIs?
There are girIs.

1030
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:03,949
Just send a big car, I'm coming.

1031
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:12,596
You're going. - No one is paying
attention to me here.

1032
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:13,859
Why shouId I stay?

1033
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:16,126
You were quite serious about me?

1034
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:19,305
So what ifI'm serious about you?

1035
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,967
You shouId give your
acceptanceas weII.

1036
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:26,307
Just say 'yes' once,
and I'II Ieave everyone for you.

1037
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:30,306
In EngIish, it means the end to
alI of Mannu's other stories.

1038
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:32,486
And in French, 'Fin'.

1039
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:35,319
You've Iearnt French too. How?

1040
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,693
I don't Iike to praise my seIf,
Chennai Express.

1041
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:42,762
There've been many trains that
have halted at this station.

1042
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:46,991
Just,the Chennai Express is deIayed.

1043
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:49,837
It's not deIayed. ActuaIIy,
it doesn't take that routeat alI.

1044
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,806
Hey, now I'II sIap you.

1045
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:56,177
Don't I know that you Iove me?

1046
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:57,841
Not at aII.

1047
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:02,078
Look, Mannu can not read
books or magazines.

1048
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:05,845
But he can read girIs' eyes.

1049
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:10,348
Listen, I know what you think.

1050
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:16,021
You think, ''Mannu is never
going to reform''.

1051
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:18,866
So, it's no use saying yes.

1052
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:20,834
And you know, what I think?

1053
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:22,798
I think, ''TIII you don't say yes..''

1054
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:25,700
..there's no reason for
Mannu to reform.

1055
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:28,208
It's alI reasons.
- ReaIIy?.

1056
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:29,809
You'II never reform.

1057
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:32,206
You can never stay IoyaI to one.

1058
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:42,222
Listen, say yes before
I get into the car..

1059
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:46,053
..or else, I'm going.

1060
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:48,057
So?

1061
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,059
Look.

1062
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:53,592
I'm going.

1063
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:58,400
Listen, better stop me.
Look what's going on there.

1064
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:00,005
You'II be alI alone.

1065
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:06,910
The Ionger you take
the better for me.

1066
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:09,413
Say yes. You shouIdn't
have such an ego.

1067
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:13,745
Chennai Express, I'm going.

1068
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:17,420
Papa.

1069
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:19,255
Look.

1070
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:25,662
Come on, Iet's go.

1071
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:54,721
Sir, my name is Arjun.

1072
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:56,786
Maybe you know me.

1073
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,798
I want to teII you about a dream.

1074
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:02,998
London Dreams.

1075
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:06,636
It's no Ionger just my dream.

1076
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:08,900
But also your daughter's now and,

1077
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:11,908
of every Indian here.

1078
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,706
The success which this band
has achieved here..

1079
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:19,484
..no other Indian band
has ever attained it.

1080
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:24,049
This band can go further.

1081
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:25,949
And, so can your daughter.

1082
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:28,826
But the decision Iies
entireIy in your hand.

1083
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:32,722
Do you want to stand in
the way of your daughter?

1084
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:36,395
Or, do you want her to achieve the

01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:48,671
..and you've the right to take
decisions regarding her future.

1088
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:53,748
But I know,
you aren't just a father..

Why have you brought me here?

1131
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:31,505
Five, four, three, two, one.

1132
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:42,687
Wow!

1133

OnIy for you.

1135
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:48,694
ReaIIy?

1136
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:51,621
Oh, no. This takes pIace
in every half an hour.

1137
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:52,959
But I thought, why not Iight up your mood..

1138
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:54,759
..along with the EiffeI Tower?

But I've done something for you.

1140
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:08,211
Keep your feet here.

1141
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:17,214
The girI I got this from
made mesIog aIot.

1142
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:19,986
I'm just joking.

1143
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:22,322
I've bought it,with a Iot of Iove.

I wasn't with any girI.

1146
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:30,567
Instead, I was searching something
for my Chennai Express.

1147
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:33,935
I thought, how couId I ask ''WiII you

1148
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:35,942
be mine forever?'' empty-handed?

1149
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,006
Are you asking meortelIing me?

1150
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:40,744
I'm asking. For the Iast time.

1151
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:45,084
After this, I won't telI
or ask you again.

1152
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:49,082

1157
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:32,131
Have you ever danced with
a girI on a saxophone tune?

1158
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,791
I pIayed aIotin Raja-Rani Band.

But never danced, why?.

1161
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:46,575
Don't ever do it, or elseI'II kiII you.

1162
01:29:46,781 --> 01:29:51,377
Oh, oh..Chennai Express has

I swear I didn't do anything with her.

1313

What do you think about him?

1339
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:06,390
That girI gave him
every kind of drug.

Coke, met hane, marijuana.

1341
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:10,561
He can't survive without it.

1342
01:45:11,204 --> 01:45:12,569
He's finished.

1343
01:45:15,075 --> 01:45:16,064
Not yet.

1344
01:45:22,849 --> 01:45:23,747
DaiIy Mirror.

..Arjun got you addicted to drugs.

1349
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:09,623

1353
01:46:22,709 --> 01:46:25,303
Mannu what are you doing?

01:46:32,686 --> 01:46:35,655
Mannu! Stop! Mannu!

1356
01:46:37,524 --> 01:46:41,722
He gave me honour, and you say
Aword against my brother..

1357
01:46:41,928 --> 01:46:43,987
I'm trying to break free.

Do you take drugs?

1367

Mannu, do you take drugs?

01:48:52,859 --> 01:48:54,793
Why do I need to take drugs?

1370
01:48:55,662 --> 01:48:57,129
You're my intoxication.

1371

01:51:56,176 --> 01:51:57,803
I brought you here,

1398
01:51:59,412 --> 01:52:01,141
and you took me back there.

1399
01:52:02,515 --> 01:52:03,140
It happens.

1400
01:52:05,418 --> 01:52:09,320
I swear on Chennai Express,

1401
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:13,157
I'II stop taking drugs.

1402
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:19,992
And, I swear on you..
I'II rock WembIey.

1403
01:52:21,034 --> 01:52:22,831
I'II rock WembIey.

1404
01:52:23,603 --> 01:52:27,004
I know how much this
show means to you.

1405
01:52:27,273 --> 01:52:33,337
I'II rock that show.
Brother. Brother.

1406
01:52:37,217 --> 01:52:38,514
Mannu has promised..

1407
01:52:40,153 --> 01:52:42,519
..that WembIeyis going to
be his best performance.

1408
01:52:43,323 --> 01:52:45,382
He shouIdn't be abIe
to keep his promise.

1409
01:52:46,893 --> 01:52:50,522
I came here to teII you,
that I Iied to you the other day.

1410
01:52:51,664 --> 01:52:53,655
I made a promise to Arjun, that

1411
01:52:56,603 --> 01:52:58,195
I'II never take drugs again.

1412
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:02,535
And, I make a promise to you.

1413
01:53:05,178 --> 01:53:07,043
I'II never Iie again.

1414
01:53:07,213 --> 01:53:10,444
It's my dream to carveaniche
for my self at WembIey..

1415
01:53:11,584 --> 01:53:12,710
..not Mannu's.

1416
01:53:12,919 --> 01:53:17,879
I want Arjun to get a standing ovation right where his
grandfather

1417
01:53:18,091 --> 01:53:19,456
was humiIiated.

1418
01:53:19,659 --> 01:53:24,392
This time, they'II appIaud for me
aIone and not Mannu.

1419
01:53:25,465 --> 01:53:30,061
I promise Arjun wiII attain
fameat WembIey.

1420
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:32,232
Hesurely wiII.

1421
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:35,240
I'II make peopIe forget Mannu.

1422
01:53:35,875 --> 01:53:42,246
It's difficuIt, but I wiII
be at WembIey at any cost.

1423
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:47,843
It's difficuIt, but this timeI wiII stop him.

1424
01:53:48,354 --> 01:53:50,083
I have onIy onegoal.

1425
01:53:51,457 --> 01:53:52,515
Arjun's success.

1426
01:53:52,725 --> 01:53:56,923
I have onIy onegoal, my success.

1427
01:53:57,130 --> 01:53:59,928
His biggest victory wiII onIy
be when I stand next to him..

1428
01:54:00,266 --> 01:54:01,426
Forhis big victory.

1429
01:54:01,634 --> 01:54:05,434
I cannot win,tiII Mannu Ioses.

1430
01:54:07,173 --> 01:54:08,265
I have apIan.

1431
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:12,844
And, you wiII have to
help me impIementit.

1432
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,607
I don't know how to do this,

1433
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:19,117
you'II have to help me.

1434
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:35,793
Come what may.

1435
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:40,639
I assure you, that London Dreams
wiII perform at WembIey.

1436
01:54:48,014 --> 01:54:49,140
Chennai Express.

1437
01:54:54,721 --> 01:55:00,159
In this humidity, I'm feeling Iike I'm in
KuIu Manali, minus thecIothes.

1438
01:55:10,637 --> 01:55:13,162
Manjeet KhosIa's 'London Dreams'

1439
01:55:55,415 --> 01:55:57,713
You'vefinalIy fuIfiIIed your dream.

1440
01:55:57,917 --> 01:55:59,646
You've reached WembIey.

1441
01:56:01,621 --> 01:56:03,589
That's whyit's important
for you to come.

1442
01:56:04,457 --> 01:56:07,483
The pIace, wherewe severed
alI ties with music..

1443
01:56:08,094 --> 01:56:09,721
..I'II rekindIe them again.

1444
01:56:12,498 --> 01:56:14,056
How are your preparations?

1445
01:56:15,168 --> 01:56:17,728
I'vebeen preparing for many years.

1446
01:56:17,937 --> 01:56:19,734
But, then you were aIone.

1447
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:22,235
Now, Mannu is with you.

1448
01:56:25,445 --> 01:56:28,312
I'm taIking about myseIf
and you're taIking about Mannu.

1449
01:56:28,514 --> 01:56:32,006
I have to. After aII he's
a part of London Dreams.

1450
01:56:32,218 --> 01:56:35,415
But he isn't London Dreams.

1451
01:56:36,122 --> 01:56:37,089
I'II Ieave now.

1452
01:56:37,657 --> 01:56:38,749
Do come.

1453
01:57:53,633 --> 01:57:54,998
Big night, big boy.

1454
01:57:56,169 --> 01:57:59,263
Want some stuff?.
- What's your name?

1455
01:57:59,839 --> 01:58:01,830
Who sent you here?

1456
01:58:03,409 --> 01:58:06,845
You never asked my name before.
Why today?

1457
01:58:07,046 --> 01:58:09,844
I havea vaIid reason.
You'represenceat every pIace.

1458
01:58:11,184 --> 01:58:13,345
Leaving me alone in a
car fiIIed with drugs.

1459
01:58:14,387 --> 01:58:17,083
Coming backstage, in spite
of so much security.

1460
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:19,087
Tryingto ruin me.

1461
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:22,520
TelI me,who sent you here?

1462
01:58:44,083 --> 01:58:46,677
TeII me who you are, or else
I'II beat you bIack and bIue.

1463
01:58:46,886 --> 01:58:50,219
Where have you come from,
and why or eIse, I'II beat you bIack and bIue.

1464
01:58:53,526 --> 01:58:56,984
Okay, I'II teII you.

1465
01:58:58,764 --> 01:59:01,665
Okay, I forgave you.
TelI me,who sent you here?

1466
01:59:03,269 --> 01:59:05,567
Stop this charade, and teII me.

1467
01:59:07,106 --> 01:59:10,564
What are you doing?
- I trusted you, Mannu.

1468
01:59:13,446 --> 01:59:14,071
Priya.

1469
01:59:14,947 --> 01:59:18,007
Why the.. Priya.

1470
01:59:22,588 --> 01:59:28,220
Priya. Listen to me, Priya.

1471
01:59:28,427 --> 01:59:29,689
Priya. Where are you going?

1472
01:59:29,896 --> 01:59:31,261
I made a mistake.

1473
01:59:32,031 --> 01:59:35,432
I trusted you, Mannu.
- Priya, this girI is trying to ruin me.

1474
01:59:35,601 --> 01:59:37,535
Why wouId anyone want to ruin you?

1475
01:59:37,737 --> 01:59:40,262
Priya, she got me addicted to drugs.

1476
01:59:40,473 --> 01:59:41,906
I thought you'vere formed.

1477
01:59:42,108 --> 01:59:46,272
But no, this is what you Iike.

1478
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:50,044
WelI. It's yourIife.

1479
01:59:51,551 --> 01:59:54,452
I don'thave anyrightto interfere.
- Priya.

1480
01:59:57,390 --> 02:00:01,121
Listen. You'retheonIy one that
has a right to interfere.

1481
02:00:01,661 --> 02:00:02,958
You'ret he onIy one.

1482
02:00:05,264 --> 02:00:08,631
No. Not anymore.

1483
02:00:10,369 --> 02:00:17,138
Now,there's nothing Ieft
between you and me.

1484
02:00:19,178 --> 02:00:24,309
You Iive your Iife.. and
I'II Iive mine.

1485
02:00:26,352 --> 02:00:26,977
Priya.

1486
02:00:38,297 --> 02:00:43,667
But.. I don'twant our differences
to haveany effect on the band.

1487
02:00:45,238 --> 02:00:47,001
On Arjun's dreams.

1488
02:00:48,874 --> 02:00:55,677
That's why, we'II work together
onIy as professionaIs.

1489
02:01:48,467 --> 02:01:51,300
I Ieft everthing for her.

1490
02:01:52,204 --> 02:01:54,399
No... No, dude.

1491
02:02:01,447 --> 02:02:03,074
But sheIeft me.

1492
02:02:08,654 --> 02:02:10,246
I heard everything.

1493
02:02:11,090 --> 02:02:13,081
I know you'rein pain.

1494
02:02:13,993 --> 02:02:15,927
You won't be abIe to perform welI.

1495
02:02:16,295 --> 02:02:18,661
But this show is very important
for aII ofus.

1496
02:02:18,864 --> 02:02:20,092
EspeciaIIy, for Arjun.

1497
02:02:23,636 --> 02:02:24,330
Here.

1498
02:02:27,139 --> 02:02:28,106
What is it?

1499
02:02:28,974 --> 02:02:32,102
Go here, and take it.

1500
02:02:35,314 --> 02:02:37,782
It's cIose by. But don't
take too much. Okay.

1501
02:02:39,919 --> 02:02:44,947
And remember, come back before
Arjun's soIo, okay?. - Sure.

1502
02:02:45,324 --> 02:02:46,951
Come soon.

1503
02:02:59,939 --> 02:03:01,031
Where is he going?

1504
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:03,140
And,what was that chit
that you gave him?

1505
02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:07,138
It was the address of a drug-deaIer.
- What?

1506
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,474
It's cIose-by.

1507
02:03:09,682 --> 02:03:13,812
You? You know, he won't be abIe
to stop him self this time.

1508
02:03:14,019 --> 02:03:15,486
He'II be ruined.

1509
02:03:15,855 --> 02:03:17,652
That's what I want.
- Why?.

1510
02:03:17,857 --> 02:03:21,190
Because, he snatched a way everything
that be longed to Arjun.

1511
02:03:21,394 --> 02:03:23,658
Our band, our songs, Iyrics
whose were they?

1512
02:03:23,863 --> 02:03:27,822
Arjun's. But, who got the name,
Iove and fortune Mannu!

1513
02:03:28,367 --> 02:03:31,495
So Paris, Rome you did alI that?

1514
02:03:31,704 --> 02:03:33,672
Yes, Paris, Rome,
Press Conference, everything.

1515
02:03:33,873 --> 02:03:35,431
And now, WembIey as welI.
I did it.

1516
02:03:35,641 --> 02:03:39,941
Because, tiII he's on stage
Arjun won't get whathe deserves.

1517
02:03:40,312 --> 02:03:43,509
And thankfuIIy, he'II never be
abIe to cIimb on stage again.

1518
02:03:44,383 --> 02:03:46,681
You scoundreI.. How couId you Zoheb,

1519
02:03:46,886 --> 02:03:47,682
how couId you? How couId you do this?

1520
02:03:48,888 --> 02:03:54,190
I aIways heeded what you said to me
but I knew that you wereright.

1521
02:03:54,393 --> 02:03:56,861
But today, you're wrong.
- What's wrong in it?

1522
02:03:57,530 --> 02:03:59,122
Arjun shouId get the
pIacehe deserves.

1523
02:03:59,331 --> 02:04:00,525
By ruining someoneeIse.

1524
02:04:00,733 --> 02:04:02,860
Just because he's more
taIented than Arjun.

1525
02:04:05,204 --> 02:04:06,068
TaIent?

1526
02:04:06,872 --> 02:04:08,533
AII hehas is style.

1527
02:04:09,074 --> 02:04:10,871
What does he know about music?

1528
02:04:14,513 --> 02:04:15,707
You're my brother.

1529
02:04:17,116 --> 02:04:18,549
You're my brother.

1530
02:04:20,753 --> 02:04:22,050
How couId you do this?

1531
02:04:24,256 --> 02:04:25,553
How couId you do this?

1532
02:04:51,617 --> 02:04:53,084
30 seconds to go, Arjun

1533
02:05:17,209 --> 02:05:21,942
Listen, God! Now the
skies beIong to me.

1534
02:05:22,147 --> 02:05:24,377
Now the skies belong to me.

1535
02:05:27,386 --> 02:05:30,617
My dreams have now
turned to reality.

1536
02:05:30,823 --> 02:05:34,088
Now the skies belong to me.

1537
02:05:34,293 --> 02:05:37,421
Now the skies belong to me.

1538
02:05:37,630 --> 02:05:40,793
I've kissed the cIouds.

1539
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,800
Now the skies belong to me.

1540
02:05:47,506 --> 02:05:54,674
I set out aIone with
the oars my self.

1541
02:05:54,880 --> 02:06:01,251
I've no faith in
the oars man at aII.

1542
02:06:01,453 --> 02:06:04,081
It's a celebration of victory.

1543
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:07,657
Of victory, of victory, of victory.

1544
02:06:28,814 --> 02:06:31,874
My dreams have now
turned to reality.

1545
02:06:32,084 --> 02:06:35,349
Now the skies belong to me.

1546
02:06:35,621 --> 02:06:38,715
Now the skies belong to me.

1547
02:06:38,924 --> 02:06:42,223
''I've kissed the cIouds.''

1548
02:06:42,428 --> 02:06:45,556
Now the skies belong to me.

1549
02:06:45,764 --> 02:06:48,927
Now the skies belong to me.

1550
02:06:49,134 --> 02:06:55,972
I set outa I one with
the oars my self.

1551
02:06:56,175 --> 02:07:02,205
I've no faith in
the oars man at aII.

1552
02:07:02,414 --> 02:07:09,047
It's a celebration of victory.
''Of victory, of victory, of victory.''

1553
02:07:09,254 --> 02:07:17,218
It's a celebration of victory.
''Of victory, of victory, of victory.''

1554
02:07:43,856 --> 02:07:50,261
My feet aresore from the
thorns Iying on thepath.

1555
02:07:50,562 --> 02:07:57,263
At pIaces, the ground
was bIazing hot.

1556
02:07:57,469 --> 02:08:04,033
I averted, and endured much pain.

1557
02:08:04,243 --> 02:08:10,182
But I had no dearth of courage.

1558
02:08:10,382 --> 02:08:13,715
I stood my ground.

1559
02:08:13,919 --> 02:08:17,878
Faced the worst storms.

1560
02:08:18,090 --> 02:08:24,552
I fought against darkness,
and snatched Iight from it.

1561
02:08:24,763 --> 02:08:30,861
It was my part of dawn,
and your part of Iife.

1562
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:37,634
It's a celebration of victory.
''Of victory, of victory, of victory.''

1563
02:08:37,843 --> 02:08:45,648
It's a celebration of victory.
''Of victory, of victory, of victory.''

1564
02:09:28,827 --> 02:09:38,031
We want Mannu.

1565
02:09:49,681 --> 02:09:51,876
Where is Mannu? CaII him.

1566
02:09:52,618 --> 02:09:53,880
He won't come.

1567
02:10:09,101 --> 02:10:12,127
Mannu won't come. He's finished.

1568
02:10:13,939 --> 02:10:16,567
Hey, Iights, Iights, I say Iights.

1569
02:10:18,710 --> 02:10:21,645
I put in my Iife, my hard
work to win your accIaims.

1570
02:10:21,847 --> 02:10:23,940
And you want Mannu.

1571
02:10:24,149 --> 02:10:25,241
Stop it.

1572
02:10:26,385 --> 02:10:27,374
Mannu won't come.

1573
02:10:27,586 --> 02:10:30,020
He won't come at any stage.

1574
02:10:30,222 --> 02:10:31,416
He's ruined.

1575
02:10:31,623 --> 02:10:33,853
Stop it.. He's finished

1576
02:11:23,909 --> 02:11:27,310
Yes, go a head cIap.

1577
02:11:28,213 --> 02:11:29,805
Take his name.

1578
02:11:31,216 --> 02:11:34,151
Mannu, see what's happening with me.

1579
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:39,318
You caII your seIf a friend and Iook
at what you've done with me.

1580
02:11:40,626 --> 02:11:43,493
Whenever I sing, peopIe stiII
wait for you to sing.

1581
02:11:44,029 --> 02:11:46,156
Whenever I say anything,
they want to hear your voice.

1582
02:11:50,035 --> 02:11:56,565
Hit me, hit me, hit me..go on,
hit me, hit me some more.

1583
02:12:01,146 --> 02:12:04,582
It's my mistake, I brought him here.

1584
02:12:05,717 --> 02:12:09,016
But he snatched my fame
and my Iove from me.

1585
02:12:09,588 --> 02:12:12,682
Yes, Mannu. I Iove Priya.

1586
02:12:14,026 --> 02:12:16,654
Much before you did, and
much more than you do.

1587
02:12:19,231 --> 02:12:21,199
But, my tiffisn't with you.

1588
02:12:22,067 --> 02:12:24,035
It's with God.

1589
02:12:24,903 --> 02:12:27,371
And that's why, I had to vent
out alI my anger on you.

1590
02:12:30,309 --> 02:12:33,039
Because, He chose you and not me.

1591
02:12:34,746 --> 02:12:38,045
He didn't care about my efforts,
my hard work.

1592
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:39,717
I asked for it,

1593
02:12:40,185 --> 02:12:41,413
but He gave the taIent to you.

1594
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:45,556
I Ioved her, but He bIessed
you with that Iove.

1595
02:12:47,926 --> 02:12:50,394
This, fame, honour, music was

1596
02:12:50,996 --> 02:12:53,726
my dream, and not yours.

1597
02:12:54,066 --> 02:12:55,897
Then, how can you get it?

1598
02:12:56,969 --> 02:12:59,403
How can the music you
mocked aII your Iife..

1599
02:13:00,505 --> 02:13:02,735
..give you fame?

1600
02:13:04,176 --> 02:13:06,736
How can the music I worshipped
aII my Iife..

1601
02:13:07,412 --> 02:13:09,607
..make me unsuccessfuI?

1602
02:13:11,316 --> 02:13:13,250
I made this group.

1603
02:13:14,086 --> 02:13:16,884
This is not Manjeet KhosIa's
London Dreams.

1604
02:13:17,189 --> 02:13:20,249
This is my London Dreams
damn it!

1605
02:13:22,227 --> 02:13:23,421
Go to heII.

1606
02:15:30,088 --> 02:15:31,555
Can I come inside?

1607
02:15:42,767 --> 02:15:46,066
I've heard you don't meet
anyone these days.

1608
02:15:47,739 --> 02:15:49,400
Don't even take caIIs.

1609
02:15:50,075 --> 02:15:52,236
Don't go out.

1610
02:15:54,946 --> 02:15:56,743
How Iong wiII you keep
running from the worId?

1611
02:15:59,784 --> 02:16:01,411
The worId is over for me.

1612
02:16:02,888 --> 02:16:04,412
What's the use of running from it?

1613
02:16:10,495 --> 02:16:12,258
The worId is stiII there, Son.

1614
02:16:13,231 --> 02:16:14,755
You don't see it.

1615
02:16:16,468 --> 02:16:20,268
We often have this misunderstanding
that we'II be famous

1616
02:16:20,872 --> 02:16:23,067
a twhat we're good at.

1617
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:27,443
Your grandfather was
a very good musician.

1618
02:16:27,812 --> 02:16:34,615
But he..couIdn't endurea singIe
faiIure and gave his Iife.

1619
02:16:35,787 --> 02:16:38,449
You're abetter
musician than he was.

1620
02:16:39,958 --> 02:16:42,791
But Mannu is more talented than you.

1621
02:16:44,496 --> 02:16:46,487
You couIdn't accept this.

1622
02:16:46,698 --> 02:16:50,794
That day, after your first concert
this is what I wanted to teII you.

1623
02:16:51,703 --> 02:16:55,571
What's the use? It's too Iate now.

1624
02:16:55,774 --> 02:16:59,107
If you do believe in this
don't try to give excuses.

1625
02:16:59,311 --> 02:17:00,972
Go, and get Mannu back.

1626
02:17:07,419 --> 02:17:09,250
How can I go back there?

1627
02:17:12,824 --> 02:17:14,655
Everyone might be a ware..

1628
02:17:16,394 --> 02:17:20,854
..of what I did with
my friend in London.

1629
02:17:21,099 --> 02:17:24,000
If you accept your mistake,
what are you afraid of?.

1630
02:17:25,303 --> 02:17:29,137
If you have the courage,
accept Mannu's taIent..

1631
02:17:29,341 --> 02:17:31,400
..and admit your mistake.

1632
02:17:31,610 --> 02:17:34,511
Then, you need not fear
facing the worId.

1633
02:17:35,981 --> 02:17:39,007
Come on. I'II come with you to the viIIage.

1634
02:17:39,217 --> 02:17:42,516
Let's end this story
where it had started.

1635
02:17:47,225 --> 02:17:48,021
Okay.

1636
02:19:02,634 --> 02:19:06,229
Son, Mannu toId us everything.

1637
02:19:06,771 --> 02:19:08,295
That useIess boy Ieft
you and came back.

1638
02:19:08,506 --> 02:19:10,371
He doesn't want to work.

1639
02:19:11,376 --> 02:19:14,436
He's extremeIy Iazy.

1640
02:19:14,913 --> 02:19:21,443
Son,we apoIogise on his be haIf.

1641
02:19:22,087 --> 02:19:24,214
Where's Mannu?
- There heis

1642
02:19:26,358 --> 02:19:36,290
When the worId wiII try to..

1643
02:19:39,537 --> 02:19:46,636
Know your worth.

1644
02:19:51,116 --> 02:20:02,084
A friend wiII say,
come give me a hug.

1645
02:20:02,293 --> 02:20:10,667
Who cares about the worId?

1646
02:20:27,185 --> 02:20:28,516
SiIence.

1647
02:20:28,987 --> 02:20:30,511
Did you seemy authority?

1648
02:20:30,722 --> 02:20:33,782
Business is doing reaI good.
By taking me to London,

1649
02:20:33,992 --> 02:20:34,856
you've doubIed my rate.

1650
02:20:35,059 --> 02:20:37,391
EarIier, I wouId get onIy Rs.2500.
But now, I get Rs.5000.

1651
02:20:37,595 --> 02:20:39,460
And these fooIs, telI me
change the name of..

1652
02:20:39,664 --> 02:20:43,122
..Raja-Rani Band to London Dreams.

1653
02:20:43,334 --> 02:20:46,030
What have I toId you?

1654
02:20:46,237 --> 02:20:49,035
That London Dreams is
my brother's band.

1655
02:20:50,542 --> 02:20:54,603
Forgive me, Mannu

1656
02:20:54,813 --> 02:20:59,773
Don't hurt me by apoIogising.

1657
02:20:59,984 --> 02:21:02,214
I shouId apoIogise to you.

1658
02:21:02,687 --> 02:21:04,882
I was so Iost in the joy in London..

1659
02:21:05,089 --> 02:21:07,216
..that I couIdn't see your sorrows.

1660
02:21:07,425 --> 02:21:09,154
I shouId apoIogise to you.

1661
02:21:09,360 --> 02:21:14,559
Being your friend, I couIdn't
feeI your pain.

1662
02:21:14,766 --> 02:21:17,326
I shouId apoIogise to you.

1663
02:21:17,702 --> 02:21:22,139
The day I found out that my
voice is your biggest enemy..

1664
02:21:22,340 --> 02:21:26,071
..I shouId havesIitit,
but I couIdn't do it.

1665
02:21:26,277 --> 02:21:30,680
I was wrong.
So, I shouId apoIogise to you.

1666
02:21:31,516 --> 02:21:34,576
For alI the mistakes,that
I committed unknow ingIy.

1667
02:21:34,953 --> 02:21:37,387
Am I? Am I?

1668
02:21:38,056 --> 02:21:40,251
Then why are you apoIogising to me.

1669
02:21:40,458 --> 02:21:46,624
Because, brother is after
aII a brother, Brother.

1670
02:21:46,831 --> 02:21:48,492
No apoIogising.

1671
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:54,270
I'm so happy brother.

1672
02:21:55,406 --> 02:21:57,601
You've come to Punjab.

1673
02:21:57,809 --> 02:21:59,276
StiII it was my mistake.

1674
02:22:00,011 --> 02:22:03,174
I did wrong with you, and with Priya.

1675
02:22:03,381 --> 02:22:06,612
Then, apoIogise to Priya and not me.

1676
02:22:06,818 --> 02:22:09,616
Chennai Express, come here.

1677
02:22:16,494 --> 02:22:18,121
No apoIogies, Brother.

1678
02:22:22,433 --> 02:22:25,425
I knew that you'II come back one day.

1679
02:22:26,938 --> 02:22:30,135
That's why, no expIanations
and no saying sorry.

1680
02:22:31,276 --> 02:22:34,302
We'II onIy taIk about the future now.

1681
02:22:35,013 --> 02:22:35,980
And not the past.

1682
02:22:39,884 --> 02:22:41,010
To London then?

1683
02:22:41,219 --> 02:22:43,312
To London and London Dreams.

1684
02:22:43,788 --> 02:22:45,255
Let's rock the worId alI over again.

1685
02:22:45,456 --> 02:22:48,653
So,when do we Ieave?
- Right now.

1686
02:22:49,460 --> 02:22:53,260
Come on. We're going to London!

1687
02:22:53,898 --> 02:22:57,356
London, here we come.
- We are going to rock London.

1688
02:23:20,258 --> 02:23:29,189
The ones that wakes you up.

1689
02:23:29,901 --> 02:23:37,205
Keeps your sIumber at bay..
''..are dreams.''

1690
02:23:41,379 --> 02:23:44,871
The true ones..

1691
02:23:46,684 --> 02:23:55,649
..the ones that creep
in when you sIeep.

1692
02:23:55,860 --> 02:24:01,230
''The ones that you forget.''
''Those dreams..'' ''..are not true.''

1693
02:24:01,432 --> 02:24:10,067
Let your dreams soar.

1694
02:24:12,110 --> 02:24:19,744
Fuel your sIeep.

1695
02:24:29,060 --> 02:24:34,123
Light the fIame.

1696
02:24:34,332 --> 02:24:37,426
Sing Iike the cuckoo.

1697
02:24:38,670 --> 02:24:43,130
Are dreams.

1698
02:24:43,341 --> 02:24:47,107
The true ones.

1699
02:24:50,014 --> 02:24:55,213
The ones that makes waves..

1700
02:24:55,420 --> 02:24:59,288
..move even water..

1701
02:24:59,691 --> 02:25:04,287
..are dreams.

1702
02:25:04,495 --> 02:25:09,990
The true ones.

1703
02:25:10,201 --> 02:25:20,509
Let your dreams soar.

1704
02:25:20,712 --> 02:25:32,988
Fuel your sIeep.

1705
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:45,698
There're celebrations on the way.

1706
02:25:45,903 --> 02:25:47,837
But those are your defeats.

1707
02:25:48,039 --> 02:25:53,204
Happiness is mean in gIess
without in.

1708
02:25:53,411 --> 02:25:58,371
Music is in compIete, so are
your tunes and melodies..

1709
02:25:58,583 --> 02:26:03,520
..and your Iife, without your kind.

1710
02:26:03,888 --> 02:26:09,019
''Let your dreams be your strength.''

1711
02:26:09,227 --> 02:26:14,221
But, don't Iose touch
with your kind.

1712
02:26:14,432 --> 02:26:19,563
The breeze says touch the sky.

1713
02:26:19,771 --> 02:26:24,231
''Let your wings soar.

1714
02:26:24,442 --> 02:26:34,317
Don't hoId back.''

1715
02:26:34,519 --> 02:26:44,224
Let your dreams soar.
''Fuel your sIeep.''
