1
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,353
<i>On Christmas Eve, many years ago... </i>

2
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,875
<i>... I lay quietly in my bed. </i>

3
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,270
<i>I did not rustle the sheets. </i>

4
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,591
<i>I breathed slowly and silently. </i>

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,232
<i>I was listening for a sound</i>
<i>I was afraid I'd never hear. </i>

6
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,475
<i>The ringing bells of Santa's sleigh. </i>

7
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,350
All right. All right, Sarah,
you had your water.

8
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,476
Now let's get you upstairs
and into bed.

9
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,154
But... But... But, I have to...

10
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,393
He said Santa would have to
fly faster than light...

11
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,235
...to get to every house in one night.
And to hold everyone's presents...

12
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,994
...his sled would be bigger
than an ocean liner.

13
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,994
Your brother said that? He was just
kidding you. He knows there's a Santa.

14
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,675
He said he wasn't sure.
He wasn't sure if Santa was for real.

15
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,752
Of course Santa is real.
He's as real as Christmas itself.

16
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,390
But he won't come until you're
sound asleep, young lady.

17
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,112
Sweet dreams.

18
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,155
Santa will be here before you know it.

19
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,231
So go to sleep.

20
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,196
"Stark, barren.

21
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,669
Devoid of life. "

22
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,390
He's gotta be asleep by now.

23
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,439
He used to stay awake all night
waiting for Santa.

24
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,037
Think those days are just about over.

25
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,031
That would be sad if that were true.

26
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,556
Yeah, an end of the magic.

27
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,150
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

28
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,992
See, he's out like a light.

29
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,197
An express train
wouldn't wake him up now.

30
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,669
<i>"End of the magic"?</i>

31
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,515
All aboard!

32
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,520
Well? You coming?

33
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,909
Where?

34
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,150
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

35
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,995
This is the Polar Express.

36
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,558
The North Pole?

37
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,558
I see.

38
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,039
Hold this, please.

39
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,077
Thank you.

40
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,597
Is this you?

41
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,072
- Yeah.
- Well, it says here...

42
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,711
...no photo with a department-store
Santa this year, no letter to Santa.

43
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,395
And you made your sister
put out the milk and cookies.

44
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,110
Sounds to me like
this is your crucial year.

45
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,478
If I were you, I would think
about climbing onboard.

46
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,438
Come on, come on.
I've got a schedule to keep.

47
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,270
Suit yourself.

48
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,675
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen</i>
<i>On the Polar Express</i>

49
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,718
<i>Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows</i>
<i>That's the sound of her singing</i>

50
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,997
<i>Ding, ding, the bell will ring</i>
<i>Golly, look at her go</i>

51
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,436
<i>You wonder if we'll get there soon</i>
<i>Anybody's guess</i>

52
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,717
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen</i>
<i>On the Polar Express</i>

53
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,316
<i>When we get there</i>
<i>We'll scream, "Yay!"</i>

54
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,630
<i>We'll arrive with</i>
<i>A bang, bang, bang</i>

55
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,950
<i>Boom, boom, boom</i>
<i>Laughing all the way</i>

56
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,157
<i>With a comfy seat and lots to eat</i>
<i>Boy, it's just the best</i>

57
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,392
<i>Wish it wouldn't ever have to end</i>

58
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,233
<i>With a little luck, we'll be on time</i>
<i>There's no need to stress</i>

59
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,712
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen</i>
<i>On the Polar Express</i>

60
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,949
Hey. Hey, you. Yeah, you.
Do you know what kind of train this is?

61
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,433
Train. Do you know what kind of train
this is? Do you?

62
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,789
Of course.

63
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,030
It's a magic train.

64
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,352
- We're going to the North Pole.
- I know it's a magic train.

65
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,988
It's a Baldwin 2-8-4 S3-class
steam locomotive...

66
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,877
...built in 1931 at the Baldwin Locomotive
Works. It weighs 456,100 pounds and...

67
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,156
Are we really going to the North Pole?

68
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,551
- Hey, look!
- Isn't that wonderful?

69
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,190
Herpolsheimer's! Herpolsheimer's!

70
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,632
Wow, look at all those presents.
I want all of them.

71
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,713
It's so Christmassy and cozy
and beautiful!

72
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,834
Tickets.

73
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,316
Tickets, please.

74
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,671
Try your pocket.

75
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,308
Try your other pocket.

76
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,233
Thank you, sir.

77
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,279
Hey, watch out, there.

78
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,032
Thank you, sir.

79
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,232
That is a public-address microphone.
It is not a toy.

80
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,391
Boy, that guy sure likes to show off.

81
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,233
Look what that wise guy
punched on my ticket.

82
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,476
- "L-E." What the heck does that mean?
- Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.

83
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,549
We're heading for the other side
of the tracks.

84
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,597
Well? You coming?

85
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,433
It's just another pickup.

86
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,910
That's weird. I thought you were
supposed to be the last one.

87
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,196
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

88
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,079
This is the Polar Express.

89
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,037
Suit yourself.

90
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,830
Hey, that kid wants
to get on the train.

91
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,636
Come on!

92
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,478
Hurry up!

93
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,999
We have to stop the train.

94
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,549
- I don't know how.
- Pull the emergency brake!

95
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,073
Who in the blazes applied
that emergency brake?!

96
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,593
He did.

97
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,432
You.

98
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,550
In case you didn't know, that cord
is for emergency purposes only.

99
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,272
And in case you weren't aware,
tonight is Christmas Eve.

100
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,353
And in case you hadn't noticed,
this train is on a very tight schedule.

101
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,308
Now, young man, Christmas
may not be important to some people...

102
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,790
...but it is very important
to the rest of us!

103
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,393
But... But...

104
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,996
He was just trying to stop the train
so that kid could get on.

105
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,431
I see. Young man,
is that what happened?

106
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,637
Well...

107
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,435
Let me remind you we are
on a very tight schedule.

108
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,750
And I've never been late before...

109
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,559
...and I am certainly not
going to be late tonight.

110
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,554
Now, everybody, take your seats, please!

111
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,436
Thank you.

112
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,553
Your attention, please.

113
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,032
Are there any Polar Express passengers
in need of refreshment?

114
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,033
- Me! Me! Me!
- I thought so.

115
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,673
<i>- Hot, hot</i>
<i>- Oh, we got it</i>

116
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,717
<i>- Hot, hot</i>
<i>- Hey, we got it</i>

117
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,519
<i>- Hot, hot</i>
<i>- Say, we got it</i>

118
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,908
<i>Hot chocolate</i>
<i>Hot, hot</i>

119
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,752
<i>- Oh, we got it</i>
<i>- Hot, hot</i>

120
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,592
<i>- So we got it</i>
<i>- Hot, hot</i>

121
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,955
<i>Yo, we got it</i>

122
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,554
<i>- Hot chocolate</i>
<i>- Here we've only got one rule</i>

123
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,517
<i>Never, ever let it cool</i>

124
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,272
<i>Keep it cooking in the pot</i>

125
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,113
<i>- Then you got</i>
<i>- Hot chocolate</i>

126
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,873
You know, Montezuma,
the king of the Aztecs...

127
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,476
...would drink 50 quarts
of hot chocolate every day.

128
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,155
It was thick as mud and red.
He put chili pepper in instead of sugar.

129
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,551
- Get it? Hot chocolate?
- How do you know? That's not true.

130
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,393
- Where you going with that?
- It's for him.

131
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,758
- I don't think we're to leave our seats.
- It's a violation of safety regulations...

132
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,912
...for a kid to cross moving cars
without a grown-up.

133
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,593
I think I'll be okay.

134
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,069
Are you sure?

135
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,519
What about this lad in the back?
Did he get any refreshment?

136
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,550
Well, let's take some to him,
by all means.

137
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,828
Watch your step, now. Watch your step.

138
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,753
She forgot her ticket.

139
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,195
It hasn't been punched.

140
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,040
What are you doing?
You're gonna get us in trouble!

141
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,833
Young lady, forgive me.

142
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,390
I believe I have neglected
to punch your ticket.

143
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,312
May I?

144
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,078
I left my ticket right here on the seat.

145
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,471
- But it's gone.
- You mean...

146
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,791
...you have lost your ticket.

147
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,791
She didn't lose her ticket.

148
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,632
I did.

149
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,198
I was trying to return it to you.

150
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,079
But the wind blew it out of my hand.

151
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,754
You can have my ticket.

152
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,711
These tickets are not transferable.

153
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,634
Young lady...

154
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,758
...you will just have to
come along with me.

155
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,675
You know what's gonna happen now?
He's gonna throw her off the train.

156
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,673
He's gonna probably throw her
off the rear platform.

157
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,230
Standard procedure. That way,
she won't get sucked under the wheels.

158
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,517
They may slow the train down,
but they're never gonna stop it.

159
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,829
Stop it?

160
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,719
That's it! I have to stop the train again.

161
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,030
No, please, don't do that again.

162
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,912
Where'd they go?

163
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,912
What happened to them?

164
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,913
Please, she's in big trouble.
You have to help me.

165
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,029
I found your ticket! Wait!

166
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,228
Wait!

167
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,709
I have your ticket!

168
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,431
Is there something I can do for you?

169
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,511
I'm looking for a girl.

170
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,633
A gi...?

171
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,717
Ain't we all?

172
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,272
I have her ticket.

173
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,796
Well, lookie. Lookie here. What is this?

174
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,351
This is an official, authentic,
genuine ticket to ride.

175
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,876
You better keep this
in a safe place, young man.

176
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,393
If I was you...

177
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,120
I keep all my valuables right here.

178
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,350
Right here in the old size 13.

179
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,670
Experience shows
this is the safest place.

180
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,036
Not that I have much use for those.

181
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,394
Tickets.

182
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,073
I ride for free.

183
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,870
Oh, yeah, yeah. I hop aboard this rattler
any time I feels like it.

184
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,996
I own this train. Oh, yeah.

185
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,438
It's like I'm the king of this train.
Yeah. The king of the Pol Ex.

186
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,436
In fact, I am the king
of the North Pole!

187
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,315
Oh, where's my manners? Sit, sit. Sit.

188
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,072
Take a load off.

189
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,470
Hey, would you like some Joe?

190
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,953
Nice hot refreshment.
Perfect for a cold winter's night.

191
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,351
There. Bless you.

192
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,310
What about Santa?

193
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,995
- Santa?
- Isn't he the king of the North Pole?

194
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,232
You mean this guy?

195
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,231
What exactly is your persuasion
on the big man?

196
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,674
Since you brought him up.

197
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,836
Well, I...

198
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,036
I want to believe.

199
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,792
- But...
- But you don't wanna be bamboozled.

200
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,918
You don't wanna be
led down the primrose path.

201
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,119
You don't wanna be conned or duped,
have the wool pulled over your eyes.

202
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,239
Hoodwinked. You don't wanna be
taken for a ride, railroaded.

203
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,832
Seeing is believing.

204
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,719
Am I right?

205
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,075
But what about this train?

206
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,993
What about it?

207
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,993
We're all really going
to the North Pole...

208
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,309
...aren't we?

209
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,795
Aren't we?

210
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,952
Are you saying
that this is all just a dream?

211
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,596
You said it, kid. Not me.

212
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,796
So let's go find that girl.

213
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,836
One other thing.

214
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,110
Do you believe in ghosts?

215
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,477
Interesting.

216
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,473
Wait.

217
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,433
I have to wake up.

218
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,556
Yeah. I have to wake up.

219
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,997
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

220
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,590
Kid!

221
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,876
Kid, get your head out of the clouds!

222
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,519
Wake up, kid!

223
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,309
There's no sleepwalking
on the Polar Express.

224
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,037
We gotta jump them knuckles.

225
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,517
Come on, kid. Flip my shoulders.

226
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,432
Grab my lily.

227
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,349
That skirt you're chasing
must have moved ahead.

228
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,754
- We gotta hightail it to the hog, pronto.
- To the hog?

229
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,757
The engine. The engine, you tenderfoot.

230
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,992
We gotta make the engine
before we hit Flat Top Tunnel.

231
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,752
How come?

232
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,434
So many questions.

233
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,992
There is but one inch of clearance
between the roof of this rattler...

234
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,913
...and the roof of Flat Top Tunnel.

235
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,877
Savvy?

236
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,792
It's just the run up to the hump, kid.

237
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,192
This will be interesting.

238
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,078
Get back on, kid. Hurry!

239
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,435
Grab my muck stick.

240
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,069
There's only one trick to this, kid.

241
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,633
When I say "jump"...

242
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,714
...you jump!

243
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,637
You. I thought you got thrown off, and...

244
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,719
- You're driving the train?
- They put me in charge.

245
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,156
- The engineer had to check the light.
- Here's the light. Careful.

246
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,912
All right, now.

247
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,393
I got it.

248
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,356
- How do you know how?
- It's easy. Come here, I'll show you.

249
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,875
This big lever here, that's the throttle.

250
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,076
This little one here, that's the brake.

251
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,993
And those are the pressure gauges.

252
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,628
And that rope is the whistle.

253
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,918
The whistle.

254
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,511
You wanna try it?

255
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,118
I've wanted to do that my whole life.

256
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,557
Hold still! Hold still! Don't move!

257
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,669
Look!

258
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,710
Stop the train! Stop the train!

259
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,472
Stop the train!

260
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,958
What?

261
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,680
They want us to stop the train.

262
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,195
- Which one is the brake?
- He told me this was.

263
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,998
- Who?
- The engineer.

264
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,591
- The engineer? This one looks like a brake.
- No, he said this was the brake.

265
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,749
Are you sure?

266
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,834
Pull the brake!

267
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,837
Stop the train!

268
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,357
Caribou?

269
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,509
There can be no Christmas without
the Polar Express arriving on time.

270
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,831
Am I the only one who understands that?

271
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,673
You. I should have known.

272
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,549
Are you bound and determined that
this train never reaches the North Pole?

273
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,233
But look.

274
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,953
Caribou crossing?!

275
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,435
I make that herd to be at least
100,000, maybe even a million.

276
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,558
It's gonna be hours
before they clear this track.

277
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,599
- A tough nut to crack.
- We are in some serious jelly.

278
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,115
- And a jam.
- Tight spot.

279
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,554
- Up a creek.
- Up a tree.

280
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,792
- Lost in the grass.
- I'll tell you what's grass: Our a...

281
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,712
Problem solved. All ahead, slow.

282
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,551
We're going pretty fast.

283
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,473
Tell the engineer to slow down.

284
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,158
Slow it down.

285
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,599
Watch the speed!

286
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,352
Jumping jeepers,
the cotter pin sheared off.

287
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,748
- What?
- The pin.

288
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,990
- Where?
- There.

289
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,438
- They can't hear me.
- They can't?

290
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,029
I don't like the look of this.
Under the safety bar.

291
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,315
Is everything all right?
What should we do?

292
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,433
Considering we've lost communication
with the engineer...

293
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,717
...we are standing totally exposed
on the front of the locomotive...

294
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,917
...the train appears to be
accelerating uncontrollably...

295
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,755
...and we are rapidly
approaching Glacier Gulch...

296
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,276
...which happens to be the steepest
downhill grade in the world...

297
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,591
...I suggest we all hold on...

298
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,270
...tightly.

299
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,392
- The pin.
- The pin.

300
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,829
Jiminy Christmas, the ice has frozen
over the tracks.

301
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,390
Hold on. Hold on. No, no.

302
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,316
Come on. Watch your step.

303
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,552
Come on, sweetie.
Up you go. Up you go.

304
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,275
Put your feet on here. On here.

305
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,948
Little adventure, huh?

306
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,429
Young man, quick thinking on your part.

307
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,319
Step to your left, please. To your left.

308
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,356
Well, that is more like it.

309
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,234
What in the name of Mike?

310
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,639
Look.

311
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,799
Get us the blazes out of here!

312
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,233
Turn this sled around.

313
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,313
Look there.

314
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,194
Tracks.

315
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,713
Dead ahead.

316
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,389
Right.

317
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,949
Left.

318
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,189
Right.

319
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,114
Hang a Louie.

320
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,439
Toss a Ritchie.

321
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,272
Port astern.

322
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,112
To the starboard.

323
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,828
- My slipper.
- You're gonna lose your ticket.

324
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,797
It's not my ticket, it's yours.

325
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,712
- It's my ticket?
- Yes.

326
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,916
Right. Keep up with me. Left.

327
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,549
Right. Left.

328
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,714
Right.

329
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,268
Left.

330
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,759
Right.

331
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,797
Left. Right.

332
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,588
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

333
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,472
Brace yourselves!

334
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,831
Well, that's more like it.

335
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,599
Thank you.

336
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,911
Thank you. I can't believe
you found my ticket.

337
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,954
Did someone say they found a ticket?

338
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,156
Well, in that case... Tickets, please.

339
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,159
Thank you.

340
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,554
- "L-E"?
- Just like that know-it-all kid.

341
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,428
Watch your step.
Tricky walking up here.

342
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,875
It's mighty slick.
Mighty slick, I tell you.

343
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,434
There you go. What did I tell you?

344
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,515
Years ago, on my first Christmas Eve run,
I was up on the roof making my rounds...

345
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,511
...when I slipped on the ice myself.

346
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,956
I reached out for a hand iron,
but it broke off. I slid and fell.

347
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,954
And yet, I did not fall off this train.

348
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,670
Someone saved you?

349
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,751
Or something.

350
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,748
An angel.

351
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,232
Maybe.

352
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,391
Wait. Wait.

353
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,237
What did he look like? Did you see him?

354
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,029
No, sir. But sometimes
seeing is believing.

355
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,315
And sometimes the most real things
in the world are the things we can't see.

356
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,150
The forsaken and the abandoned.

357
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,114
Mind your step, now.
These poor toys have suffered enough...

358
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,432
...being left to rust and decay in the
back alleys and vacant lots of the world.

359
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,638
What are they doing here?

360
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,916
It's a new concept
the boss came up with.

361
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,311
Instead of being thrown away,
they're collected. Refurbished.

362
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,869
He calls it "rebicycling. "
Something like that.

363
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,349
Makes me wanna cry...

364
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,557
...seeing toys that were
treated this way.

365
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,359
These hopelessly entangled
string puppets and marionettes...

366
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,638
...pose a particular problem. We found
the nimble fingers of our work force...

367
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,952
...here at the North Pole are best
for working out those knots and tangles.

368
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,554
Thank you. Double-locked here.

369
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,790
You are just like me, my friend.

370
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,235
A scrooge!

371
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,470
Ebenezer Scrooge.

372
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,837
North Pole, Santa Claus, this train...

373
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,754
...it's all a bunch of humbug.
A bout of indigestion.

374
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,388
Oh, yeah. I know what you are.

375
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,074
You're a doubter.

376
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,674
A doubter. You don't believe!

377
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,877
You're a doubter! You don't believe!

378
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,078
You missed it.
We rode down some really sharp hills.

379
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,196
We were on what looked like
a frozen lake.

380
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,430
But I know it was just
an optical illusion.

381
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,398
He said the train was on ice.
I said it's impossible...

382
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,120
You can't put a train track...
Where you going now?

383
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,913
<i>I'm wishing on a star</i>

384
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,117
<i>And trying to believe</i>

385
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,317
<i>That even though it's far</i>

386
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,194
<i>He'll find me Christmas Eve</i>

387
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,792
<i>I guess that Santa's busy</i>

388
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,838
<i>'Cause he's never come around</i>

389
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:28,838
<i>I think of him</i>
<i>When Christmas comes to town</i>

390
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,637
<i>The best time of the year</i>

391
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,872
<i>When everyone comes home</i>

392
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,077
<i>With all this Christmas cheer</i>

393
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,630
<i>It's hard to be alone</i>

394
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,591
<i>Putting up the Christmas tree</i>
<i>With friends who come around</i>

395
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,869
<i>It's so much fun</i>
<i>When Christmas comes to town</i>

396
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:01,476
<i>Presents for the children</i>
<i>Wrapped in red and green</i>

397
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,552
<i>All the things I've heard about</i>
<i>But never really seen</i>

398
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,749
<i>No one will be sleeping</i>

399
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,878
<i>On the night of Christmas Eve</i>

400
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:20,832
<i>Hoping Santa's on his way</i>

401
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,958
<i>When Santa's sleighbells ring</i>

402
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,873
<i>I listen all around</i>

403
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,112
<i>The herald angels sing</i>

404
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,158
<i>I never hear a sound</i>

405
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,990
<i>And all the dreams of children</i>

406
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,833
<i>Once lost will all be found</i>

407
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,677
<i>That's all I want</i>
<i>When Christmas comes to town</i>

408
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,719
Look.

409
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,191
The northern lights.

410
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,876
Hey. You three.

411
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,758
We just crossed it.

412
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:26,119
Latitude 66°33'.
The Arctic Circle.

413
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,477
And do you see?
Those lights in the distance.

414
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,638
They look like the lights of a strange
ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.

415
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,791
There...

416
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,396
...is the North Pole.

417
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,919
<i>It's a magic carpet on a rail</i>
<i>It never takes a rest</i>

418
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,117
<i>Flying through</i>
<i>The mountains and the snow</i>

419
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,113
<i>You can ride for free and join the fun</i>
<i>If you just say yes</i>

420
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,477
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen</i>
<i>On the Polar Express</i>

421
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,632
<i>Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows</i>
<i>That's the sound of her singing</i>

422
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,872
<i>Ding, ding, the bell will ring</i>
<i>Golly, look at her go</i>

423
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,918
<i>You wonder if you'll get there soon</i>
<i>Anybody's guess</i>

424
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,152
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen</i>
<i>On the Polar Express</i>

425
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,312
<i>When we get there</i>
<i>We'll scream, "Yay!"</i>

426
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,710
<i>We'll arrive with</i>
<i>A bang, bang, bang</i>

427
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,758
<i>Boom, boom, boom</i>
<i>Laughing all the way</i>

428
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,358
We made it. With five minutes to spare.

429
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,317
We made it.

430
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,915
There should be elves.
Where are the elves?

431
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,672
Yeah, where are the elves?

432
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,070
They are gathering
in the center of the city.

433
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,869
That is where Santa will give
the first gift of Christmas.

434
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,075
Who gets the first gift of Christmas?

435
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,949
He will choose one of you.

436
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,713
- Look.
- Elves!

437
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,550
All right. All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

438
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,314
Two columns, if you please.

439
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,153
Shorter in the front, taller in the rear.

440
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,110
Even-numbered birthdays on the right,
odd-numbered on the left.

441
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,078
No pushing. No pushing.
But let's not dilly-dally.

442
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,071
It's five minutes to midnight.

443
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,676
Hey, what gives? It was five minutes
till midnight four minutes ago.

444
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,509
Exactly. Columns of two.

445
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,716
- One, two.
- Excuse me.

446
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,235
- Question.
- What about him?

447
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,474
No one is required to see Santa.

448
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,632
Ladies and gentlemen,
you do not have to hold hands...

449
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,110
- Come on.
... but please remain in your columns...

450
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,555
...while we are in transit.

451
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,156
- Look, you have to come with us.
- She's right.

452
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,278
Christmas just doesn't work out
for me. Never has.

453
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,954
But Christmas is such a wonderful,
beautiful time.

454
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,590
It's a time for giving and being thankful,
for friends and family.

455
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,356
People hang decorations and lights. Santa
leaves presents under our Christmas trees.

456
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,872
Christmas just...

457
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,237
...doesn't work out for me.

458
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,509
Look, I don't know if Christmas
is gonna work out for you or not...

459
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,672
...but this is Christmas Eve.
Don't stay here by yourself.

460
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,759
Yes, come with us.

461
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,998
We'll go together.

462
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,158
Oh, no.

463
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,677
We're gonna be okay.

464
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,956
Maybe not!

465
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,637
The emergency brake.

466
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,677
The emergency brake.

467
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,869
There's no brake. I can't find the brake!

468
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,588
Take a break, kid.

469
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,275
How about a nice, good hot cup of Joe?

470
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,755
We're gonna crash!

471
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,311
We're spinning.

472
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,917
You hear that?

473
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,708
The bell.

474
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,315
- What bell?
- The sleighbell.

475
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,789
- Sleighbell?
- Don't you hear it?

476
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,514
It's coming from that tunnel.

477
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,876
That's the way we should go.

478
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,479
Come on.

479
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,873
What?

480
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,920
- What?
- Come on.

481
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,389
Come on.

482
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,518
We're lost.

483
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,433
Yes.

484
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,438
- Yes. I hear it.
- I hear it too.

485
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,513
- I don't hear anything.
- Okay, it's down this way.

486
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,829
Are you sure?

487
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,514
Absolutely.

488
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,309
Why can't I hear anything?

489
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,314
Get down and be quiet.

490
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,354
Yeah.

491
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,719
Okay.

492
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,636
Well, that was the wrapping hall, chief.

493
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,268
- Just finished the last one.
- How's it wrapped?

494
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,194
It's wrapped in candy-striped red
with a number-seven holly-green bow.

495
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,511
A number-seven bow?
When we're this close to liftoff?

496
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,990
What are they thinking down there?
Are they meshuggener?

497
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,310
- What's the routing?
- Going to the States.

498
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,596
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

499
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,998
That's my town. I'm from Grand Rapids.

500
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,992
We got a troublemaker now.
Just what we need.

501
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,958
Things aren't bad enough.
What's his 20?

502
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,271
Apparently, some kid
from Maplewood, New Jersey...

503
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,749
...stuck some gum in his sister's hair.

504
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,278
New Jersey? Is that the same kid
that put the tack...

505
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,476
...underneath his teacher's chair
last year?

506
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:25,110
- No, sir. This kid's name is Steven.
- Steven.

507
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,433
So, what do we do, chief?
Alert the big man?

508
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,478
We talking nothing for Christmas here?

509
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,752
<i>I didn't do it. </i>

510
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,195
Look, it's...
It's almost Christmas, huh?

511
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,597
We'll cut the kid a break.

512
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,716
But put him on the check-twice list
for next year.

513
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,516
All right, boys.

514
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,678
Let's shut it down.
That's it for this year. Come on.

515
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,197
- Hey, boss, are we taking the pneumatic?
- Of course we're taking the pneumatic.

516
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,397
It's the only way to get
to the square on time.

517
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,677
- Let's go.
- And time is money.

518
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,919
Ready, and mount.

519
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,840
Good. Close.

520
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,552
All right, get in.

521
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,996
I don't know about this.

522
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,199
I don't hear it. Do you?

523
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,038
No.

524
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,989
I think we should follow those arrows.

525
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,035
I thought there'd be a way out.

526
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,316
We're gonna miss everything.

527
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,478
Hey, look.

528
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,359
A present.

529
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,398
It's going to my town.
To someone named Billy.

530
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:03,918
- My name is Billy.
- It's going to 11344 Edbrooke Avenue.

531
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,877
That's my address.

532
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,873
Come on.

533
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,879
Look.

534
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,510
It says, "Merry Christmas, Billy.
From Mr. C."

535
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,678
I think I know what it is.
I wanted one of these my whole life.

536
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,830
Wait, wait. Stop. Look.

537
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,876
But I...

538
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,792
Those are the rules.

539
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,352
Something's got me.

540
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,158
It's got my leg.

541
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,999
I can't hold him.

542
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,318
Give me your other hand.
Give me your other hand.

543
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,910
- I can't.
- On three.

544
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,072
One, two, three.

545
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,711
- Look.
- It's still got me.

546
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,077
On three again. One, two, three.

547
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,713
- You.
- You.

548
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,836
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.

549
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,436
Checking my presents. Making sure
I'm getting everything on my list.

550
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,398
I found one present.
All it had was stupid underwear.

551
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,118
Look.

552
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,436
<i>You may start your descent</i>
<i>any time now. </i>

553
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,750
<i>At your convenience, of course. </i>

554
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,716
It's still five to.
I think we're gonna make it.

555
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,394
Of course. It's been five to
for the last hour.

556
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,996
We got plenty of time. We got nothing
but time. We got time to kill.

557
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,755
You know what?
I don't think we're gonna make it.

558
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,072
I may be just an old railroader...

559
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,913
...and know nothing about
lighter-than-air craft...

560
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:55,359
...but from my layman's perspective,
you need more altitude!

561
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,875
More altitude!

562
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,393
<i>Altitude, please. </i>
<i>A bit more altitude, please. </i>

563
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,430
Geronimo!

564
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,639
The Flying Elves.

565
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,473
They are specialists.
Do not try that at home, kids.

566
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,517
Do not try that at home.

567
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,874
We're not gonna make it.

568
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,038
A well-oiled machine.

569
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,159
All right, you stowaways.

570
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,597
- Party's over.
- I was just following them.

571
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,591
We fell in here by mistake.

572
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,309
Forget about it. We knew you
was in there the whole time.

573
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,479
Come on, out you go.

574
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:35,189
Let's go, come on.
Step up, step up. There we go.

575
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,477
Not a problem. Come on.
Watch your step. There you go.

576
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,317
So nobody gets hurt, here's
how we're gonna get you guys down.

577
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,677
- This is simple. Why, I know...
- What do you know?

578
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,356
You're not supposed to be here
in the first place.

579
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,793
But since it's Christmas,
I'm gonna let you slide.

580
01:03:58,960 --> 01:03:59,949
Hey.

581
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,674
Been looking for you.

582
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,999
There you go.

583
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,354
Watch your step.

584
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,351
Careful.

585
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,511
Beautiful form. Beautiful.

586
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,955
Nice to see you again.

587
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,399
Cutting it kind of close, aren't we?

588
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,996
I'll take care of this.

589
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,196
It's in good hands.

590
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,920
Trust me.

591
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,630
<i>It's the spirit of the season</i>

592
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,190
<i>You can feel it in the air</i>

593
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,955
<i>You can hear it if you listen</i>

594
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,635
<i>Everywhere</i>
<i>So much care</i>

595
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,438
<i>Like a prayer</i>

596
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,115
<i>Whatever it is</i>
<i>You need to share it</i>

597
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,512
Aren't those bells
the most beautiful sound?

598
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,079
He's here! He's here!

599
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,434
Where?

600
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,875
I see him. He's over there.

601
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,473
I can't see him.

602
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,996
<i>Doubter. Doubter. </i>

603
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,236
I believe.

604
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,235
What was that you said?

605
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,113
I believe.

606
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,196
I believe.

607
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,993
I believe that this is yours.

608
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,153
Well...

609
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,114
Thank you.

610
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,397
- Me, me. Pick me, Santa.
- What are you doing? Stop it.

611
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,518
- Pick me, pick me. I want the first gift.
- Hush.

612
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,557
Young man...

613
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,472
...patience.

614
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,111
And a smidgen of humility
might also serve you well.

615
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,838
Yes, sir.

616
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,315
And you, young lady...

617
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,118
A lady of decision.

618
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:24,034
Full of confidence and spirit.

619
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,318
Christmas spirit.

620
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,519
Keep up the good work.

621
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,438
Thank you.

622
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,918
And Billy.

623
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,998
It is Billy?

624
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,194
I see you've made some new friends.

625
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,279
Yes, sir. I sure have.

626
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,597
That's a lucky lad.

627
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,115
There's no greater gift than friendship.

628
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,798
And speaking of gifts...

629
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,429
...let's have this young fellow
right here.

630
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,913
Now...

631
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,958
...what would you like for Christmas?

632
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,917
Me.

633
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,433
You.

634
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,079
Yes. Indeed.

635
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,189
Yes, indeed.

636
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,349
The first gift of Christmas!

637
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,915
This bell is a wonderful symbol
of the spirit of Christmas...

638
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,514
...as am I.

639
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,713
Just remember...

640
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,519
...the true spirit of Christmas...

641
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,910
...lies in your heart.

642
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,712
Merry Christmas.

643
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,399
Better keep that in a safe place.

644
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:30,156
Hey, hey. Man alive, are you lucky.

645
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,994
Pull, Comet. Pull, boy!

646
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,156
Prancer, that's a girl.

647
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,750
Good boy, Donder.

648
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:40,398
Now, Dasher. Now, Prancer and Vixen.

649
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,838
It's everything I dreamed it would be.

650
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,718
Could all...?

651
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,713
Could all this be nothing but a dream?

652
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,359
No.

653
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,469
<i>To the top of the roof</i>
<i>To the top of the wall</i>

654
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,270
<i>Now, dash away, dash away</i>
<i>Dash away all</i>

655
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:51,193
All aboard!

656
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,191
One, two. One, two, three, go.

657
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:57,069
<i>Rockin ' on top of the world</i>
<i>Rockin ' on top of the world</i>

658
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,310
<i>The place is hoppin '</i>
<i>There ain't no stoppin '</i>

659
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:03,189
<i>Rockin ' on top of the world</i>
<i>Lift your spirits, swing that girl</i>

660
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,920
<i>Rockin ' on top of the world</i>
<i>Tonight, yeah</i>

661
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,310
Come on, shorty!

662
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,149
Show your tickets.
Have your tickets ready.

663
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,754
Remember to eat
the five basic food groups.

664
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,638
Ticket, please.

665
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,951
And please brush after every meal.

666
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,032
Remember to duck and cover.
All right, you. Ticket, please.

667
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,028
"Lean. " Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

668
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,395
"Lean" is spelled with four letters.

669
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,710
I believed I punched five.

670
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,559
Hey, are you saying
I don't know how to...?

671
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:00,837
I'm sorry. It says "learn. " My mistake.

672
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,831
Lesson learned.

673
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,319
Ticket.

674
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,873
That is some special ticket.

675
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,473
Sure is.

676
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:27,758
So can you count on us
to get you home safe and sound?

677
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,432
Absolutely.

678
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,033
Me...

679
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,196
...and my friends.

680
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:39,989
Ticket.

681
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:51,158
It says "lead. " Like "lead balloon. "

682
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,880
I believe it also is pronounced "lead. "

683
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,917
As in "leader," "leadership. "

684
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,196
"Lead the way. "

685
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,476
Follow you anywhere, ma'am.

686
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,468
Ah, yes.

687
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,473
Young man with all the questions.

688
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,313
Ticket.

689
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,076
It says...

690
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,878
It's nothing I need to know.

691
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,675
- Come on, let's see the bell.
- Let's see it.

692
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,434
- Come on, let's see the bell.
- Show us the bell.

693
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,670
Yeah, let's see the bell.

694
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:49,318
It's gone.

695
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,239
- Where is it?
- I lost it.

696
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,868
I lost the bell from Santa's sleigh.

697
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,792
It's gone?

698
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,354
Don't worry.

699
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,829
- We'll... We'll find it.
- Yeah, we'll find it.

700
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,230
Yeah, we'll help you. All of us.

701
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,119
Yeah, let's hurry out
and find it right now.

702
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,912
It's too late.

703
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,749
Gee, that's really too bad.

704
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,312
Really.

705
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,992
I'm sorry.

706
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,434
<i>11344 Edbrooke. </i>

707
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:19,833
Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.

708
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,671
Hey, where you going?

709
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:30,709
Home.

710
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,316
Oh, okay. Merry Christmas.

711
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,958
Thanks for stopping the train for me.

712
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,118
Have a wonderful Christmas.

713
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,509
Watch your step, please.

714
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:56,991
And merry Christmas.

715
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,548
Look.

716
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,873
Santa got to Billy's house already.

717
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,199
Look, look! Santa got here!

718
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,873
Isn't that amazing?

719
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,393
It is amazing.

720
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,516
It is amazing.

721
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,155
I'm sorry about the bell.

722
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,280
It was a really special present.

723
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,112
Well, you know what they say.

724
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,475
It's the thought that counts.

725
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,519
Yeah.

726
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:37,393
Well, see you.

727
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,359
Well...

728
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,518
...see you.

729
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,793
See you.

730
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,429
Watch your step, please.

731
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,834
Thank you.

732
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,434
No, thank you.

733
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,838
One thing about trains:

734
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,991
It doesn't matter where they're going.

735
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:16,039
What matters is deciding to get on.

736
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,753
Merry Christmas!

737
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,469
What?

738
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:43,917
Merry Christmas!

739
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:53,838
Wake up. Wake up.
Santa's been here. Santa's been here.

740
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,592
Hurry up. Hurry up!

741
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,957
Mom, Dad, wake up. Wake up!

742
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,998
Santa's been here! Santa's been here!

743
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,914
Mom, Dad, look!
He brought us all kinds of stuff!

744
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,514
Look, a train!

745
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:29,519
This is the beautiful-est,
most wonderful-est Christmas ever.

746
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,875
Wait. Look.

747
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,917
Here's one more.

748
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,197
Has your name on it.

749
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,309
<i>Found this on the seat of my sleigh. </i>

750
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:11,040
<i>Better fix that hole in your pocket. </i>

751
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,394
<i>Mr. C.</i>

752
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,156
Oh, what a beautiful bell.
Who's it from?

753
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,276
- Santa.
- Santa?

754
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,998
Really?

755
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,309
- Oh, that's too bad.
- What's this?

756
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,753
Broken.

757
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,910
Sorry about that, sport.

758
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:45,272
Come on, kids. We don't wanna be late.

759
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,356
<i>At one time, most of my friends</i>
<i>could hear the bell. </i>

760
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:00,399
<i>But as years passed,</i>
<i>it fell silent for all of them. </i>

761
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:05,634
<i>Even Sarah found, one Christmas, that she</i>
<i>could no longer hear its sweet sound. </i>

762
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,392
<i>Though I've grown old... </i>

763
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,835
<i>...the bell still rings for me. </i>

764
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,913
<i>As it does for all who truly believe. </i>
