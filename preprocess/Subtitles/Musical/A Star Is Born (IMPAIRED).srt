staggering back.

Washing out my gloves

...and winning a contest on the radio,
singing in joints.

407
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:34,665
You see how my mind works?
It's all jumbled.

408
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,999

410
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,879
I can't.

411
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:48,136
I can remember my first job
singing with the band.

412
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:52,975
And then, one-night stands

Whoa, that was a low point.

416
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,571
I'll never forget it...

417
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:09,700
...and I'll never, never do that again.

418
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,869
No matter what.

419
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,581
But I had to sing.

00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:57,080
Well, have you had enough,
as the Republicans used to say?

432
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:01,585
You know about as much about me now
as I do of myself.

433
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,255
But you see how long it's taken me
to get this far.

434
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,885
Now, all I need is just a little luck.

435
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,180
- What kind of luck?
- Oh....

436
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:17,017
The kind of luck that every girl singer
with a band dreams of.

One night a talent scout
from a big record company will come in.

438
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,440
And he'll let me make a record.

439
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,776
Yes, and then?

440
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,904
Oh, the record'll become number one
on the hit parade.

441
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,449
Be played on the jukeboxes
all over the country.

And I'll be made.

No, it might happen very easily.
Only the dream isn't big enough.

How long will you be playing
at the Grove?

- Quit. Leave the band. Stay on here.

at the studio. I'll talk to Niles right away.

451
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,526
It's just a chance, but take it.

452
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,820
A chance?

453
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,906
Do you realize I'd be giving up
everything I ever worked for?

454
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:17,160
That's right. But it's served its purpose.
Listen to me, Esther.

455
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,497
A career is a curious thing.
Talent isn't always enough.

456
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,668
You need a sense of timing,
an eye for seeing the turning point...

457
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,422
...or recognizing the big chance
when it comes along and grabbing it.

458
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:32,342
A career can rest on a trifle like....

459
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,845
Like us sitting here tonight.

460
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,015
Or it can turn on somebody's
saying to you:

461
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:42,019
"You're better than that.
You're better than you know."

462
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,814
Don't settle for the little dream.
Go on to the big one.

Yes.

00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:03,206
Say, what makes you so sure about me?

466
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,459
I heard you sing.

467
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:09,713
- Yeah, but that--
- I know, just my word.

468
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,216
But you know yourself, don't you?

469
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,094
You just needed somebody to tell you.

470

...then your picture
gets off to a good start, but....

934
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,940
Anyway, they always go out
for fresh popcorn...

935
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:13,361
...so that the first few reels always sound
like the Marines landing on Iwo Jima.

936
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,947
- And the thing to do--
ESTHER: Norman?

937
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,240
NORMAN:
Yes?

938
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,868
ESTHER:
Would you stop the car, please?

939
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,529
NORMAN:
Are you all right?

940
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:59,449
ESTHER:
Fine. I wish I was dead.

941
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,459
Come on.

942
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:26,267
- We're in luck, Esther. We're in luck.
- Why? Did the theater burn down?

943
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:30,897
NORMAN: That picture of mine is so bad,
anything they see after will seem great.

You're starting lucky.

ESTHER [SINGING ON FILM]:
Swanee, how I love ya

947
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:46,538
How I love ya
My dear old Swanee

948
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:51,751
The folks up north will see me no more

949
01:08:51,919 --> 01:09:02,762
When I get to that Swanee shore

950
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:41,593
Thank you. Thank you very much.

951
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:46,306
I can't express it any other way.

952
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:50,810
For, with this awful trembling
in my heart...

953
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:55,773
...I just can't find another thing to say.

954
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:59,360
I'm happy that you liked the show.

955
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,238
I'm grateful you liked me.

956
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:07,410
And I'm sure to you,
the tribute seemed quite right.

957
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:12,999
But if you knew of all the years

958
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:17,754
Of hopes and dreams and tears

959
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:22,217
You'd know it didn't happen

960
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:28,848
Overnight

961
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:32,101
Overnight.

962
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:39,984
I was born in a trunk

963
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,988
In the Princess Theater

964
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:51,412
In Pocatello, Idaho

965
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:58,753
It was during the matinee on Friday

966
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:03,216
And they used a makeup towel

967
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:06,511
For my didee

968
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:10,682
When I first saw the light

969
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:15,103
It was pink and amber

970
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,981
Coming from the footlights

971
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:22,568
On the stage

972
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:26,739
When my dad carried me out there

973
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:30,743
To say hello

974
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:36,291
They tell me
That I stopped the show

975
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:43,298
So I grew up in a crazy world
Of dressing rooms

976
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:47,218
And hotel rooms and waiting rooms

977
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:51,347
And rooms behind the scenes

978
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:55,810
And I can't forget the endless rows

979
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:59,647
Of sleepless nights and eatless nights

980
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:03,234
And nights without a nickel

981
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:08,656
In my jeans

982
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:12,452
But it's all in the game

983
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,997
And the way you play it

984
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:23,796
And you've gotta play the game, you know

985
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:28,134
When you're born in a trunk

986
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:33,014
At the Princess Theater

987
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:36,517
In Pocatello

988
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:43,691
Idaho

989
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:50,615
At first I just stood
And watched from the wings

990
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:54,660
That's all my mom and dad would allow

991
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,584
But as I got older
I got a little bolder

992
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:07,215
And snuck out for their second bow

993
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:14,889
They kept me in the act
Because they needed me to milk applause

994
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:19,227
Until one night
They did a crazy thing

995
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,273
They left me out there all alone

996
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:26,401
Mama said,
"You're on your own"

997
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:30,696
And Papa shouted,
"This is it kid, sing"

998
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:43,751
I'll get by

999
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:48,756
As long as I

1000
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:52,760
Have you

1001
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:58,141
Though there be rain

1002
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:02,395
And darkness too

1003
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:07,191
I'll not complain

1004
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:13,698
I'll see it through

1005
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:19,203
I learned very quickly
The tricks of the trade

1006
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:24,959
I practiced after everyone was gone

1007
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:29,005
And with the tricks
I learned traditions

1008
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,966
And the hardest one of all

1009
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,343
Is no matter what

1010
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:40,141
The show must go on

1011
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:46,314
As time went by
I looked for jobs

1012
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:50,651
And was kicked from pillar to post

1013
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:56,157
I haunted all the agents' offices

1014
01:14:56,575 --> 01:15:01,245
And I almost ended up a ghost

1015
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:13,466
I'm a sentimental sap
That's all

1016
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:15,468
What's the use of trying not to fall

1017
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,845
I have no will
You made your kill

1018
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:20,056
'Cause you took advantage of me

1019
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:21,974
No.

1020
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,403
I'm just like an apple on the bough

1021
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:36,489
And you're gonna
Shake me down somehow

1022
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,783
So, what's the use
You cooked my goose

1023
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,868
'Cause you took advantage of me

1024
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,745
No.

1025
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,381
I'm so hot and bothered
That I don't know

1026
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,716
My elbow from my ear

1027
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,052
Suffer something awful each time you go

1028
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,555
But much worse when you're near

1029
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:03,558
Here am I with all my bridges burned

1030
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:06,269
Just a babe in arms
Where you're concerned

1031
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:09,146
So lock the doors
Call me yours

1032
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:14,527
'Cause you took advantage of me

1033
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,112
Yes.

1034
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,405
No.

1035
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:29,959
So I got into a tap show

1036
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:33,963
All I did was kick my feet

1037
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:38,509
You'd hardly call it a chance to sing

1038
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,804
But at least it was a chance to eat

1039
01:16:47,477 --> 01:16:49,353
They call it black bottom

1040
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:50,563
A new twister

1041
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,732
But sure got him
An old sister

1042
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:55,651
They clap their hands
And do the raggedy trot

1043
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,154
Hot
Ooh!

1044
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:01,782
Old fellows with lumbago

1045
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,118
And young fellows, away they go

1046
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,121
They jump right in
And give it all that they've got

1047
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,292
Then one night something happened.

1048
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,753
Dame fortune showed her face.

1049
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,883
The star got sick
and I was told to go on in her place.

1050
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,894
But she recovered.

1051
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:33,731
Oh, well.

1052
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,275
Black bottom
A new rhythm

1053
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:38,653
When you spot 'em
You go with 'em

1054
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,905
And do that
Black, black, black, black bottom

1055
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:42,990
You won't be blue
When you have got 'em

1056
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:47,745
If you do that
Black, black, black, black bottom all day

1057
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:54,335
But finally I got an offer
To sing in New York

1058
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,797
And I wired, "I'm on my way"

1059
01:17:57,964 --> 01:18:04,512
I had visions that this would be
A fabulous, famous cafe

1060
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:10,768
Filled with high society
Elegance and spruce

1061
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:14,939
And I pictured me
The epitome

1062

1064
01:18:26,743 --> 01:18:28,994
Through every city, town
And country lane

1065
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:31,580
You'll hear him sing
His plaintive little strain

1066
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:34,792
And as he goes by
To you he'll say

1067
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,878
Sing "Melancholy Baby."

Peanuts

1069
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,762
The little children like to trail along

1070
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:49,306
They like to hear
The peanut vendor's song

1071
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:52,393
They all laugh with glee
When he will say

1072
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:55,563
- Sing "Melancholy Baby."
- "Melancholy Baby."

01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:13,503
You see?

1252
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:15,755
Well, goodbye. Goodbye, everyone.

1253
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:19,092
Oh, now, wait a minute, my boy.
That's much too public a proposal...

1254
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,595
...for me to say no to. I accept.

1255
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:24,222
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

1256
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,355
NORMAN:
Oliver, we're gonna get married.

1257
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:38,445
I guess I didn't read that line right.
I'll try again.

1258
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:42,365
We're going to get married.

1259
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:45,827
- Both of us.
- To each other. What do you think of that?

1260
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:47,370
What's the matter?

1261
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:50,582
He's trying to decide
if it's good for the studio.

1262
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:53,960
Well, is it?

1263
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:56,963
- It is. My blessings.
- Thank you.

1264
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:58,632
A little unsteady, but thank you.

1265
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:00,467
LIBBY: Congratulations.
- Thank you, Libby.

1266
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,719
How long a honeymoon
are you going to give us?

1267
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,471
OLIVER:
Now, let's see.

1268
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:07,682
I'll want you back by the ninth.

1269
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:08,892
No, make it the tenth.

1270
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:11,519
Now, don't let your heart run away
with your head.

1271
01:34:11,687 --> 01:34:15,649
I'll have to call Production and see how
long I can stall off Vicki's wardrobe tests.

1272
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:20,278
While you're settling the details, is it
all right if I go out and buy the lady a ring?

1273
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:22,155
Sure, we want everything legal.

1274
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:24,074
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1275
01:34:24,241 --> 01:34:26,159
Bye, Oliver.

1276
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:28,411
ESTHER: Goodbye, Libby.
NORMAN: Bye. Bye, Libby.

1277
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:34,167
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

1278
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:39,005
That was quite a decision
you made just now, Oliver.

1279
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:41,091
Decision?

1280
01:34:42,593 --> 01:34:45,303
Letting that girl walk into a booby trap.

1281
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:47,180
Vicki's business is her own.

1282
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:48,890
Is it?

1283
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:53,103
She's the hottest piece of property
the studio has right now.

1284
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:55,980
This might make the difference
to Norman.

1285
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:58,191
This might be it.

1286
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:00,777
Any bets?

1287
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:05,490
Well, I better start the wheels grinding.

1288
01:35:05,658 --> 01:35:08,868
A front-page splash on the wedding
would help his slipping box office.

1289
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:11,746
Hello, this is Matt Libby.
Get me my office.

1290
01:35:12,289 --> 01:35:14,332
MARKHAM: Mr. Libby's office.
- Hello. Hello, Markham?

1291
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:18,336
- Yes, Mr. Libby.
- Lester and Maine are getting married.

1292
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:21,297
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, look, I want all stops pulled.

1293
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:24,467
Full coverage, every department.
The wedding to end all weddings.

1294
01:35:24,635 --> 01:35:26,886
- Yes, sir.
- All right. Now, see if you can get...

1295
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:30,140
...the mayor to close school that afternoon.
I'll get you the date.

1296
01:35:30,307 --> 01:35:32,892
Get newsreel and television coverage
started right away.

1297
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:38,022
Yeah. Get all traffic routed out of Beverly
Hills for two miles each side of the church.

1298
01:35:38,190 --> 01:35:39,232
Which one?

1299
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:43,361
The big one. And tell the Life, the TIME,
the AP and the UP boys...

1300
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:47,991
...that I'll set up restricted coverage
with each one of them, personally.

1301
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,952
Yeah. The bleachers and everything.
The full treatment.

1302
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:54,289
MAN: Now, if any man can show just cause
why these two...

1303
01:35:54,457 --> 01:35:59,252
...may not be lawfully joined together,
let him now speak or else hereafter...

1304
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:02,088
...forever hold his peace.

1305
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:08,428
Do you, Ernest Sidney Gubbins,
take this woman for your wedded wife?

1306
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:09,637
I do.

1307
01:36:09,805 --> 01:36:13,099
MAN: Will you love, comfort, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health...

1308
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:14,893
...as long as you both shall live?

1309
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:16,227
I will.

1310
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:21,357
Do you, Esther Blodgett,
take this man for your wedded husband?

1311
01:36:21,525 --> 01:36:24,652
- I do.
MAN: Will you obey, serve, love, honor...

1312
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:28,281
...and keep him in sickness and in health
as long as you both shall live?

1313
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:32,994
- I will.
- Now, place the ring on her finger.

1314
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,457
By virtue of the powers vested in me...

1315
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:40,376
...as justice of peace
of San Verdo township...

1316
01:36:40,544 --> 01:36:45,799
...county of Los Angeles,
I pronounce you man and wife.

1317
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:51,763
- Good luck.
- Hooray!

1318
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:57,811
I must exercise my prerogatives of office.

1319
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:01,356
I wish you all the happiness, miss.

1320
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:02,690
Thank you so much.

1321
01:37:02,858 --> 01:37:04,776
Same to you.

1322
01:37:04,944 --> 01:37:08,154
- And now, if you'll just sign this.
- Oh, yes.

1323
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:13,576
You know, I'd swear
I'd seen you before, Mrs. Gubbins.

1324
01:37:13,744 --> 01:37:14,786
Oh, really?

1325
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:19,666
Well, I think this is the first time
I've ever been in San Verdo.

1326
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:23,753
You know, your face looks familiar too,
Mr. Gubbins.

1327
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:26,673
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1328
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:28,466
Thank you.

1329
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:30,677
Here's your receipt.

1330
01:37:31,887 --> 01:37:33,346
- Goodbye.
- Oh, goodbye.

01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:34,848
- Bye.
- Bye.

1332
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:37,308
- Here.
- Thank you.

1333
01:37:37,476 --> 01:37:39,352
- I think we got by with it.
- It was close.

1334
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,021
That J.P. was just beginning
to remember us.

1335
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:43,523
At least we got away from Libby.

1336
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,650
NORMAN:
Libby doesn't even know we left town.

1337
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,610
DANNY:
All the luck.

1338
01:37:54,243 --> 01:37:58,371
Well, if you'll be kind enough to glance
between my shoulder blades...

1339
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:00,039
...Mr. and Mrs. Gubbins...

1340
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:03,084
...you'll find there a knife,
on its handle are your initials.

1341
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:05,962
- Oh, now, don't be angry.
- It's been delightful seeing you.

1342
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:07,672
LIBBY: Wait! Wait a minute!
ESTHER: Goodbye!

- I've got--
- Bye.

Well, I wish them joy.

1345
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:18,683
Wait till they see the press.
It won't be so funny.

1346
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:22,812
- They've a right to get married quietly.
- No, they haven't. He knows better.

1347
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:26,357
Mr. Public Nuisance could stand
some decent publicity for a change.

1348
01:38:26,525 --> 01:38:28,401
I've spent ten years covering up for him.

1349
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:31,946
Killing bad stories, sucking up
to columnists to smooth away his insults.

1350
01:38:32,114 --> 01:38:36,576
Who do you think they'll blame for not
letting them cover this today? Him? No. Me.

1351
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:38,411
I'll look just like a fool.

1352
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:41,331
Double-crossed by a cruddy actor.

1353
01:38:41,498 --> 01:38:44,792
Well, he needs this, believe me,
more than I do.

1354
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,753
Okay.

1355
01:38:47,087 --> 01:38:49,380
Just wait your turn, I always say.

1356
01:38:49,548 --> 01:38:51,966
What do you always say, McGuire?

1357
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:32,799
Ooh.

1358
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:41,641
Well, the first thing to do, I think...

1359
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,477
...is to go and wash your face.
It's quite dirty.

1360
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:49,023
I know my face is dirty. But you didn't
want anybody to recognize us, did you?

1361
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:51,192
NORMAN:
No, that's right.

1362
01:39:52,611 --> 01:39:55,029
But you can unmask now.

1363
01:39:55,197 --> 01:39:59,075
I paid my $2, I wanna see what I got.
There it is.

1364
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:02,036
Nice.

1365
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:12,171
Oh. Heh.

01:40:32,776 --> 01:40:36,654
...singing the title song
from her new picture It's a New World.

1369
01:40:36,822 --> 01:40:39,323
This is the number one tune
of the hit parade...

1370
01:40:39,491 --> 01:40:43,161
...and the number one favorite
on the jukeboxes all over the country.

Vicki Lester, "It's a New World."

Well, there it is, Esther.

You've got it,
just the way you dreamed it.

No, I've got more.

1375
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:03,598
Much more.

1376
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:07,351
Hey.

1377
01:41:07,519 --> 01:41:10,188
That's for ordinary folks
who have to turn on the radio...

1378
01:41:10,355 --> 01:41:13,941
...and put a nickel in the jukebox.
I've got a private copyright of my own.

Including the Scandinavian.

1380
01:41:16,487 --> 01:41:20,406
I've got the built-in original right
in the house, every time I want to hear it.

1381
01:41:20,574 --> 01:41:22,575
And I want it now.

No, you don't.

[SINGING]
How wonderful that I'm beholding

1386
01:41:36,256 --> 01:41:40,927
A never-never land unfolding

1387
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:43,888
Where we polish up the stars

1388
01:41:44,056 --> 01:41:46,933
And mountains we move

1389
01:41:47,101 --> 01:41:52,563
In a life where all the pleasures

1390
01:41:52,731 --> 01:41:58,444
We will prove

1391

It's a new world I see

A new world for me

1393

Every time you speak

A new world

01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:46,993
Though we're in a tiny room

1398
01:42:47,494 --> 01:42:51,747
What a vision of joy

1399

And blossom and bloom

1400
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:02,884
A newfound promise

One that will last

My name is Harrison.

- Hello, Norman.

Shall we...? Hm.
Shall we go through there?

You don't think someone'll come
strolling in...

...and start telling us he's Napoleon
or Julius Caesar, do you?

1882
02:20:59,409 --> 02:21:01,243
No.

1883
02:21:01,953 --> 02:21:06,582
Nevertheless, I think we'd find it
a little cozier in the sun porch.

Now, Cuddles, Mr. Niles isn't
slipping me a case of Scotch.

He's just gonna sit with me.

Oliver, this is Cuddles,
my social secretary.

We go everywhere together.

How are you feeling?

1889
02:21:27,770 --> 02:21:30,814
Oh, I'm coming along splendidly,
so Cuddles tells me.

1890
02:21:30,982 --> 02:21:33,650
He says you ought to see
some of the boys.

1891

Well, let's sit down.

1892
02:21:35,528 --> 02:21:38,113
Cuddles, we really don't need you.

1893
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:46,163
Touching, isn't it?
He can't bear to have me out of his sight.

Well, you comfortable here?

Comfortable?
Why, it's positively luxurious.

1896
02:21:52,462 --> 02:21:57,216
Why, we even have steel mesh
on the windows to keep the drafts out.

1897

OLIVER: How much longer
do you think you'll be here?

1898
02:21:59,552 --> 02:22:02,304
Well, I'm really cured now,
only I'm just staying on...

1899
02:22:02,472 --> 02:22:05,432
...an extra week or two
until I get into really good shape.

1900

After all, there isn't any great hurry
to return to the cameras.

That's what I wanna talk to you about.

1902

I have a script here.

Why, that's great, Oliver.

1905

Who plays opposite me?

1906
02:22:28,581 --> 02:22:32,209
Well, it isn't exactly the lead, Norman.
Young Pemberton's doing that.

1907
02:22:32,377 --> 02:22:35,671
But I'll tell you frankly,
I consider your part better than the lead.

1908
02:22:35,838 --> 02:22:38,257
I see. Better than the lead.

1909
02:22:38,424 --> 02:22:42,302
Of course, it isn't terribly long. It's one
of those parts that make an impression.

1910
02:22:42,470 --> 02:22:45,305
They'll be thinking about you
all through the picture.

1911
02:22:47,892 --> 02:22:51,645
Well, the thing is, Oliver,
that I'm pretty well set at another studio.

1912
02:22:51,813 --> 02:22:54,356
I'm not at liberty at the moment
to tell you which one.

You know yourself how those things are,
but it's big. Big.

It's-- Cuddles, do you have a quarter?

1915

It's one of the biggest pictures of the year.
As for the part, every actor in Hollywood...

1916
02:23:05,034 --> 02:23:09,538
- ...would give his eyeteeth to play it.
- That's fine, Norman. Just fine.

1917
02:23:10,456 --> 02:23:13,333
Naturally, that'll tie you up for a while.

1918

However, we're not getting to this
for some time.

1919
02:23:17,088 --> 02:23:20,090
- Perhaps you'd consider it for later on.
- Better not count on me.

They're talking to me about England.

Maybe you'll come up with some ideas,
even if you don't play the part.

Come on. Right down there.

2016
02:30:01,158 --> 02:30:04,327
Hats off, cigarettes out.
Hurry it up, come on.

2017
02:30:04,495 --> 02:30:09,207
Come on, hurry up. Come on, come on.
Hurry it up. Single file line, face the judge.

2018
02:30:10,501 --> 02:30:13,003
Face the judge. Hurry it up.

2019
02:30:13,170 --> 02:30:15,130
Second line right down there.

2020
02:30:15,297 --> 02:30:17,090
Single file.

Take your hat off. Come on, go. Hat off.

Come on. Hurry it up, fellows.

2026

JUDGE: I want to advise you that you're
entitled to be represented by counsel...

2027
02:30:31,772 --> 02:30:34,357
...to be confronted
by the witnesses that testify...

2028
02:30:34,525 --> 02:30:37,694
...to a public and speedy trial
by the court or by a jury...

2029
02:30:37,862 --> 02:30:39,988
...and the right to be admitted to bail.

2030
02:30:40,156 --> 02:30:42,032
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.

2031
02:30:42,199 --> 02:30:43,825
William Gregory.

2032
02:30:43,993 --> 02:30:46,619
MAN: Drunk. Picked up at Fifth
and Towne asleep in the gutter.

2033
02:30:46,787 --> 02:30:49,330
Fourteen similar offenses
in the past six months.

2034
02:30:49,790 --> 02:30:51,708
How do you plead?

2035
02:30:51,876 --> 02:30:53,376
I don't feel so good.

2036
02:30:53,544 --> 02:30:56,337
I didn't ask you how you feel.
I said how do you plead?

2037
02:30:56,505 --> 02:30:57,881
Guilty, I guess.

2038
02:30:58,049 --> 02:31:00,216
When did you get out the last time?

2039
02:31:00,384 --> 02:31:01,551
Just before Christmas.

2040
02:31:02,636 --> 02:31:05,055
You'll have to miss New Year's,
but you'll be out...

2041
02:31:05,222 --> 02:31:08,600
...in time for Washington's birthday.
Sixty days.

2042
02:31:11,479 --> 02:31:13,855
Ernest Gubbins.

2043
02:31:14,523 --> 02:31:16,149
Gubbins.

2044
02:31:16,317 --> 02:31:19,652
MAN: Drunk and disorderly. Crashed car
into tree at Sunset and Coronado.

2045
02:31:19,820 --> 02:31:21,404
Evidently been drinking for days.

2046
02:31:21,572 --> 02:31:25,075
Resisted arrest and injured
one of the arresting officers.

2047
02:31:25,242 --> 02:31:26,785
How do you plead?

2048
02:31:26,952 --> 02:31:28,703
Guilty.

2049
02:31:29,789 --> 02:31:32,540
Were you Norman Maine, the actor?

2050
02:31:32,708 --> 02:31:34,250
Yes.

2051
02:31:35,544 --> 02:31:38,171
You've come pretty low, haven't you?

2052
02:31:38,339 --> 02:31:41,091
There isn't a man here
that's had the advantages you've had.

2053
02:31:41,258 --> 02:31:43,093
And look what you've done with them.

2054
02:31:44,887 --> 02:31:48,139
You're nothing but an irresponsible drunk
driving around the streets...

2055
02:31:48,307 --> 02:31:52,102
...with the power to inflict death
and injury on innocent people.

2056
02:31:52,269 --> 02:31:57,899
I think we'd better deny you that power
for a while. Ninety days in the city jail.

2057
02:32:06,575 --> 02:32:07,867
I'm his wife.

2058
02:32:08,744 --> 02:32:10,286
I recognize you, Miss Lester.

2059
02:32:11,497 --> 02:32:14,666
Please, judge, I promise...

2060
02:32:14,834 --> 02:32:19,003
...this will never, never happen again.

2061
02:32:19,171 --> 02:32:21,631
I'll be responsible for him.

2062
02:32:21,799 --> 02:32:23,550
I will.

2063
02:32:23,801 --> 02:32:27,929
If you'll just not send him there.

2064
02:32:28,305 --> 02:32:30,306
JUDGE: Do you realize that this man,
when drunk...

2065
02:32:30,474 --> 02:32:32,725
...is obviously a menace
to the public's safety?

2066
02:32:35,688 --> 02:32:39,649
Do you realize, too, the responsibility
you'll be assuming in this, to the court...

2067
02:32:39,817 --> 02:32:41,568
...and to the people of this city?

2068
02:32:41,735 --> 02:32:43,653
I do.

2069
02:32:50,703 --> 02:32:53,997
Sentence suspended.
Prisoner remanded to custody of wife.

2070
02:32:56,333 --> 02:32:58,042
Thank you.

2071
02:33:04,383 --> 02:33:06,593
JUDGE:
Jose Rodriguez.

2072
02:33:55,476 --> 02:33:58,978
- I'm so tired, Esther.
MAN 1: All right, folks, hold it.

2073
02:33:59,146 --> 02:34:00,813
MAN 2:
Hold it.

2074
02:34:02,066 --> 02:34:04,651
MAN 3: One more, please.
- Just a minute.

2075
02:34:56,453 --> 02:34:58,955
- He's asleep.
- Good.

2076
02:34:59,123 --> 02:35:00,748
He's been sleeping most of the day.

2077
02:35:00,916 --> 02:35:03,251
- That's the best thing for him.
- Yes.

2078
02:35:06,547 --> 02:35:10,174
He looks so helpless lying there.

2079
02:35:10,801 --> 02:35:15,638
Smiling in his sleep, just like a child.

2080
02:35:19,685 --> 02:35:22,937
OLIVER: Do you still love him, Esther?
Or do you feel sorry for him?

2081
02:35:24,982 --> 02:35:27,191
ESTHER:
Sorry for him?

2082
02:35:27,359 --> 02:35:30,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

2083
02:35:30,821 --> 02:35:32,822
I love him.

2084
02:35:32,990 --> 02:35:35,575
OLIVER:
We'll take care of him together.

2085
02:35:36,994 --> 02:35:39,037
ESTHER: You are very fond of him,
aren't you, Oliver?

2086
02:35:39,204 --> 02:35:41,581
OLIVER:
I'm very fond of both of you.

2087
02:35:43,083 --> 02:35:47,003
ESTHER: Then I know you'll understand
what I have to tell you.

2088
02:35:48,255 --> 02:35:52,008
You probably know already,
after what happened last night.

2089
02:35:53,427 --> 02:35:56,512
I can't do any more pictures, Oliver.

2090
02:35:57,264 --> 02:35:59,849
I'm going away for good.

2091
02:36:01,101 --> 02:36:02,977
With Norman.

2092
02:36:03,312 --> 02:36:06,022
You're at the very height
of your career, Esther.

2093
02:36:06,190 --> 02:36:08,775
The very peak of your success.

2094
02:36:09,318 --> 02:36:12,111
There wouldn't be any career
without Norman.

2095
02:36:12,738 --> 02:36:15,365
I'm just giving back the gift he gave me.

2096
02:36:15,532 --> 02:36:18,534
OLIVER: No one can give anyone a career.
You've made your own.

2097
02:36:18,702 --> 02:36:20,953
ESTHER:
No, no.

2098
02:36:21,163 --> 02:36:23,039
He gave it to me...

2099
02:36:23,457 --> 02:36:27,627
...by his faith and by his love.

2100
02:36:28,045 --> 02:36:31,297
And without him, it's just nothing.

2101
02:36:31,715 --> 02:36:34,175
Not the way things are.

2102
02:36:34,343 --> 02:36:36,386
- You've thought this through?
- Mm-hm.

2103
02:36:36,553 --> 02:36:38,388
You're sure you're right?

2104
02:36:38,555 --> 02:36:40,390
What'll you do?

2105
02:36:40,682 --> 02:36:44,143
Well, we'll go away together.

2106
02:36:44,311 --> 02:36:47,397
I'll be with him every moment.

2107
02:36:47,564 --> 02:36:50,066
Maybe if I'd had a chance
to be with him more...

2108
02:36:50,234 --> 02:36:53,069
...some of these things
wouldn't have happened.

2109
02:36:54,446 --> 02:36:57,156
I've got to hang onto that.

2110
02:36:57,491 --> 02:36:59,492
I've got to believe that.

2111
02:36:59,660 --> 02:37:02,745
And then when he gets better...

2112
02:37:03,038 --> 02:37:06,999
...we can work in England or Italy.

2113
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:13,923
Somewhere where they don't know
about him the way they do here.

2114
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:19,762
And he can get a chance to start again.
That's all he needs.

2115
02:37:20,097 --> 02:37:22,348
That's what I'm willing to fight for.

2116
02:37:22,516 --> 02:37:24,976
To give anything for.

2117
02:37:25,727 --> 02:37:27,353
Esther...

2118
02:37:28,230 --> 02:37:30,148
...I have to tell you this.

2119
02:37:30,315 --> 02:37:32,608
I hate to, but I must.

2120
02:37:33,193 --> 02:37:34,569
There's nothing left anymore.

2121
02:37:36,113 --> 02:37:41,159
It happened long before last night.
Long before we let him out of the studio.

2122
02:37:41,326 --> 02:37:46,456
Twenty years of steady and quiet drinking
do something to a man.

2123
02:37:46,957 --> 02:37:50,126
Long before it showed in his face,
it showed in his acting.

2124
02:37:50,294 --> 02:37:54,213
Little by little, more and more,
with each picture.

2125
02:37:54,381 --> 02:37:56,007
That's why he slipped.

2126
02:37:56,175 --> 02:37:59,135
It wasn't just bad pictures, it was him.

2127
02:37:59,344 --> 02:38:02,305
And there's nothing left anymore.

2128
02:38:02,473 --> 02:38:05,641
He's just the shell of what he once was.
It's gone, Esther.

2129
02:38:05,809 --> 02:38:11,272
No. No, Oliver, I don't believe that.
I won't and I can't.

2130
02:38:13,108 --> 02:38:17,528
Can you honestly tell me
I'm wrong to do this?

2131
02:38:17,696 --> 02:38:21,157
To try? To try?

2132
02:38:21,408 --> 02:38:25,453
No, my dear, I can't.
I can't honestly tell you that.

2133
02:38:25,621 --> 02:38:28,289
Well, then it's settled.

2134
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:31,751
OLIVER:
It's settled.

2135
02:38:32,294 --> 02:38:34,212
I'll arrange it.

2136
02:38:36,006 --> 02:38:38,007
Bye, Vicki Lester.

As fit as a fiddle and ready for love.

Why being as fit as a fiddle should make
one ready for love I never understood.

Yes. A number of things.

Yes, both of us. I should like to see

In the first place,
I'm going in for the athletic stuff.

The swim before breakfast,
the swim before dinner, the happy mind...

- No. Your part begins when I come out.
