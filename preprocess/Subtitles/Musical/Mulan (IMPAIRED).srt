328
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,072
Stony? Oh, man, they're gonna kill me.

329
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,734
[Great Ancestor] Great stone dragon,

330
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,506
have you awakened?

331
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:11,071
[Mushu] Uh, uh, uh, uh...
Yes, I just woke up!

332
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,983
I'm... I am the great stone dragon.
Good morning!

333
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,613
I will go forth and fetch Mulan.

334
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,022
Did... Did I mention that
I was the great stone dragon?

335
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,993
Go! The fate of the Fa family

336
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,724
rests in your claws.

337
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,234
Don't even worry about it.
I will not lose face.

338
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,429
[Screaming, grunting]

339
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,640
Oh. My elbow!

340
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,232
[Groaning] I know I twisted somethin'.

341
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,937
[Grunting]

342
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,502
That's just great.
Now what?

343
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,572
I'm doomed, and all 'cause Miss Man

344
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,482
decides to take her
little drag show on the road.

345
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,481
[Chirping, squeaking]

346
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,888
Go get her?
What's the matter with you?

347
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,154
After this great stone,
Humpty-Dumpty mess,

348
00:24:56,228 --> 00:25:00,562
I'd have to bring her home with
a medal to get back in the temple.

349
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,759
That's it!
I'll make Mulan a war hero.

350
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,064
They'll be begging me
to come back to work.

351
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,764
That's the master plan.
Ah, you done it now, man.

352
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,898
[Chirps]

353
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,101
[Chirping continues]

354
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,167
Hey, what makes you
think you're comin'?

355
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,837
[Chirping]

356
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,904
You're lucky? [laughing]

357
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,507
- Do I look like a sucker to you?
- [Chirps]

358
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,211
What you mean, "a loser"?

359
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,880
How 'bout I pop
one of your antennas off?

360
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,549
- Then who's the loser?
- [Chirps]

[Screeches]

367
00:26:17,674 --> 00:26:21,667
Nice work, gentlemen.
You found the Hun army.

368
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:24,111
[Huns laughing]

369
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:26,206
The emperor will stop you.

370
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:29,775
Stop me? He invited me.

- [Grunts]
- [Groans]

372
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:35,113
By building his wall,
he challenged my strength.

373
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,717
Well, I'm here to play his game.

374
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:43,599
Go! Tell your emperor
to send his strongest armies.

375
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:46,065
I'm ready.

376
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:52,605
How many men does it take
to deliver a message?

377
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:55,269
One.

378
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,517
Okay, okay, how about this?

379
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:03,985
[Coughs, speaks in deep voice]
Excuse me.

380
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:06,215
Where do I sign in?

381
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:10,385
Ha, I see you have a sword.
I have one, too.

382
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,690
They're very manly and... tough.

383

[Neighing]

384
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,695
I'm working on it!

385
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:21,794
Oh. Who am I fooling?

386
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:25,069
It's going to take a miracle
to get me into the army.

387
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:27,975
Did I hear someone
ask for a miracle?

388
00:27:28,044 --> 00:27:30,569
- Let me hear you say "aaah"!
- Aaah!

389
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:32,842
- That's close enough.
- A ghost.

390
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:36,317
Get ready, Mulan.
Your serpentine salvation is at hand!

391
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:39,549
For I have been sent
by your ancestors

392
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:42,183
to guide you through
your masquerade.

393
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:44,386
If you're gonna stay,
you're gonna work.

394
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:48,761
So heed my word! 'Cause if the army
finds out you're a girl,

395
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:52,199
the penalty is death!

396
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:53,668
Who are you?

397
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:56,297
Who am I? Who am I?

398
00:27:56,373 --> 00:27:59,865
I am the guardian of lost souls.

399
00:27:59,943 --> 00:28:02,571
I am the powerful,
the pleasurable,

400
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:05,137
the indestructible Mushu.

401
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,541
Oh. Ha, ha.
Pretty hot, huh?

402

[Groans]

403
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:18,721
Uh, my ancestors sent
a little lizard to help me?

404
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:21,525
Hey, dragon, dragon, not lizard.

405
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:24,226
I don't do that tongue thing.

406
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:26,269
You're, um...

407
00:28:26,336 --> 00:28:28,600
Intimidating?
Awe-inspiring?

408
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:29,934
- Tiny.
- Of course.

409
00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:32,065
I'm travel-size
for your convenience.

410
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:35,873
If I was my real size, your cow
here would die of fright.

411
00:28:35,946 --> 00:28:39,905
Down, Bessie. My powers are
beyond your mortal imagination.

412
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:44,750
For instance, my eyes can see
straight through your armor. Oooh!

413
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:47,986
All right, that's it! Dishonor!

414
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:50,049
Dishonor on your whole family.

415
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:51,184
Make a note of this.

416
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:53,821
Dishonor on you,
dishonor on your cow, dis...

417
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:56,195
Stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

418
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:59,531
I'm just nervous.
I've never done this before.

419
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:03,039
Then you're gonna have to trust me.
And don't slap me no more.

420
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:05,540
We clear on that?
All right.

421
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:08,874
Let's get this show on the road!
Cri-Kee, get the bags.

- Let's move it, heifer.

Okay, this is it.
Time to show 'em your man walk.

426
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,786
Shoulders back, chest high,
feet apart, head up and strut.

427
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:26,261
Two, three. Break it down.
Hup, two, three. And work it!

428
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:32,034
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- They're disgusting.

429
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:35,469
No, they're men. You have to
act like them, so pay attention.

430
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:39,770
Look.
This tattoo will protect me from harm.

I hope you can get your money back!

434
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:48,410
I don't think I can do this.

435
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:51,147
It's all attitude.
Be tough, like this guy here.

Punch him.
It's how men say hello.

438
00:29:58,728 --> 00:30:01,128
Oh, Yao, you've made a friend.

439
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:03,665
Good. Slap him on the behind.
They like that.

Whoa-ho-ho!

I'm gonna hit you so hard,
it'll make your ancestors dizzy.

The Huns have struck here,
here and here.

459
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,971
I will take the main troops
up to the Tung Shao Pass...

460
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,737
and stop Shan-Yu before
he destroys this village.

Excellent strategy, sir.

I do love surprises. [chuckling]

You will stay and train
the new recruits.

When Chi Fu
believes you're ready,

you will join us, Captain.

Captain?

467
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,753
[Gasps] This is an enormous
responsibility, General.

468
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,821
Perhaps a soldier
with more experience...

469
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,764
Number one in his class,

470

extensive knowledge
of training techniques,

- Yes, sir.
- Very good then.

475
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:03,878
We'll toast China's victory
at the imperial city.

476

I'll expect a full report
in three weeks.

We'll make better time
to the lmperial city

through the Tung Shao Pass.

We're the only hope
for the emperor now.

[Mushu] We're gonna die!
We are definitely gonna die.

No way we survive this.
Death is coming!

857
00:58:34,506 --> 00:58:39,170
[Blubbering] I let them
slip through my fingers.

Huh?

I knew we could do it.
You the man!

863

Well, sort of.

You are the craziest man
I've ever met.

And for that, I owe you my life.

- High treason!

01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,555
I didn't mean for it to go this far.

889
01:00:40,632 --> 01:00:42,793
Ultimate dishonor!

890
01:00:42,868 --> 01:00:46,531
It was the only way.
Please, believe me.

- [Together] No!
- You know the law.

My debt is repaid.

897
01:01:23,342 --> 01:01:26,834
- Move out!
- But you can't just...

898
01:01:26,912 --> 01:01:29,779

This close to impressin' the ancestors,

904
01:02:11,056 --> 01:02:13,752
gettin' the top shelf, an entourage.

905
01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:17,352
Man. All my fine work. Pfft.

906
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:23,166
Hi.

907
01:02:23,235 --> 01:02:26,261
I should never have left home.

908
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:29,432
Hey, come on.
You went to save your father's life.

909
01:02:29,508 --> 01:02:32,602
Who knew you'd end up shamin' him,
disgracing your ancestors

910
01:02:32,677 --> 01:02:36,408
and losin' all your friends?
You know, you just gotta...

911
01:02:36,481 --> 01:02:38,415
you gotta learn
to let these things go.

[Crying]

913
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:43,179
Maybe I didn't go for my father.

914
01:02:43,255 --> 01:02:45,246
Maybe what I really wanted

915
01:02:45,323 --> 01:02:48,087
was to prove I could do things right.

916
01:02:49,127 --> 01:02:51,960
So when I looked in the mirror,

917
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:54,521
I'd see someone worthwhile.

918
01:02:57,135 --> 01:02:58,796
But I was wrong.

I can see you. Look at you.
You look so pretty.

The truth is, we're both frauds.

924
01:03:28,867 --> 01:03:31,927
Your ancestors never sent me.
They don't even like me.

925
01:03:32,003 --> 01:03:34,733
I mean, you risked your life
to help people you love.

926
01:03:34,806 --> 01:03:36,774
I risked your life to help myself.

Let's go home.

01:03:59,598 --> 01:04:02,931
Yeah. This ain't gonna be pretty.

936
01:04:03,001 --> 01:04:07,028
But don't you worry, okay?
Things will work out.

The Huns are alive!
They're in the city!

961
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:42,953
You don't belong here, Mulan.
Go home.

962
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:49,656
I saw them in the mountains.
You have to believe me.

963
01:06:49,734 --> 01:06:51,326
Why should I?

964
01:06:54,773 --> 01:06:57,537
- [Whinnying]
- Why else would I come back?

965
01:06:57,609 --> 01:07:02,342
You said you'd trust Ping.
Why is Mulan any different?

966
01:07:09,854 --> 01:07:14,416
Keep your eyes open.
I know they're here. Yah!

967
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:24,734
- [Crowd cheering]
- Now where are you going?

968
01:07:24,803 --> 01:07:27,397
To find someone
who will believe me.

969
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:02,200
My children,
heaven smiles down

970
01:08:02,273 --> 01:08:04,503
upon the Middle Kingdom.

971
01:08:04,576 --> 01:08:08,273
China will sleep safely tonight

972
01:08:08,346 --> 01:08:11,076
thanks to our brave warriors.

973

[Crowd cheering]

974
01:08:14,185 --> 01:08:16,619
- Sir, the emperor's in danger.
- [Harrumphs]

975
01:08:16,688 --> 01:08:18,918
But the Huns are here.

976
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:21,788
- Please, you have to help.
- [Harrumphs]

977
01:08:23,661 --> 01:08:25,026
No one will listen.

978
01:08:25,096 --> 01:08:27,326
Huh? I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

979
01:08:27,398 --> 01:08:31,129
- Mushu.
- You're a girl again, remember?

980
01:08:31,202 --> 01:08:33,136
Your Majesty,

981
01:08:33,204 --> 01:08:36,833
I present to you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

982
01:08:36,908 --> 01:08:40,275
I know what this means to you,
Captain Li.

983
01:08:40,345 --> 01:08:43,974
Your father would have been very proud.

984

[Groaning]

992
01:09:31,162 --> 01:09:33,756
They'll never reach the emperor in time.

[Battering continues]

994
01:09:37,569 --> 01:09:40,037
[Whistling] Hey, guys!

995
01:09:40,104 --> 01:09:42,538
I've got an idea.

996
01:09:56,521 --> 01:09:58,250
# <i>Be a man</i>

997
01:09:58,323 --> 01:10:01,121
# <i>We must be swift as a coursing river</i>

998
01:10:01,192 --> 01:10:02,557
# <i>Be a man</i>

# <i>With all the force of a great typhoon</i>

1000

# <i>Be a man</i>

1001

# <i>With all the strength of a raging fire</i>

[people exclaiming, gasping]

1004
01:10:27,018 --> 01:10:29,953
Boo.

1005
01:10:30,021 --> 01:10:31,488
Guard the door.

1006
01:10:37,595 --> 01:10:40,530
Your walls and armies have fallen,

1007
01:10:40,598 --> 01:10:42,896
and now it's your turn.

1008
01:10:42,967 --> 01:10:44,867
Bow to me.

1009
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,399
Okay. Any questions?

1010
01:10:51,476 --> 01:10:53,467
[Yao] Does this dress make me look fat?

1011
01:10:53,544 --> 01:10:55,375
- [Slap]
- Ow!

1012

[Giggling]

Oh, he's so cute!

Mongolian barbecue.

[Chuckling]

1021

Shang, go!

1022
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:42,293
I tire of your arrogance, old man.
Bow to me!

1023
01:11:42,293 --> 01:11:47,094
I tire of your arrogance, old man.
Bow to me!

1024
01:11:47,165 --> 01:11:52,933
No matter how the wind howls,
the mountain cannot bow to it.

1025
01:11:53,004 --> 01:11:56,940
Then you will kneel in pieces!

1026
01:12:09,153 --> 01:12:11,383
Chien-Po, get the emperor!

1027
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:14,084
Sorry, Your Majesty.

You!

1037
01:13:02,073 --> 01:13:04,439
You took away my victory!

1038
01:13:04,509 --> 01:13:05,976
[Mulan] No!

1039
01:13:06,911 --> 01:13:07,969
I did.

- [Mushu] So what's the plan?

1043
01:13:26,664 --> 01:13:28,859
- Um...
- You don't have a plan?

1044
01:13:28,933 --> 01:13:32,801
Hey, I'm making this up as I... go.

1045
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:35,338
- Mushu!
- Way ahead of you, sister.

01:13:59,897 --> 01:14:02,297
Your worst nightmare!

1051
01:14:06,204 --> 01:14:07,762
- On the roof!
- Look!

1052
01:14:15,046 --> 01:14:17,014
[Gasping]

1053
01:14:25,022 --> 01:14:28,116
It looks like you're out of ideas.

1054
01:14:30,962 --> 01:14:32,520
Not quite.

1055
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:34,895
Ready, Mushu?

1056
01:14:34,966 --> 01:14:38,402
I am ready, baby!
Light me.

[Screams]

1060

[Crowd cheering]

1065
01:15:24,182 --> 01:15:26,878
That was a deliberate attempt
on my life!

1066
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:29,579
Where is she?
Now she's done it.

1067
01:15:29,654 --> 01:15:32,020
What a mess!
Stand aside!

1068
01:15:32,089 --> 01:15:35,286
That creature's not worth protecting.

1069
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:37,350
- She's a hero.
- 'Tis a woman.

1070

- She'll never be worth anything.
- Listen, you pompous...

1071
01:15:40,598 --> 01:15:43,692
That is enough.

1072
01:15:48,706 --> 01:15:51,436
Your Majesty, I can explain.

1073
01:15:59,217 --> 01:16:03,017
I've heard a great deal about you,
Fa Mulan.

1074
01:16:04,388 --> 01:16:06,379
You stole your father's armor,

1075
01:16:06,457 --> 01:16:08,687
ran away from home,

1076
01:16:08,759 --> 01:16:10,852
impersonated a soldier,

1077
01:16:10,928 --> 01:16:13,294
deceived your commanding officer,

1078
01:16:13,364 --> 01:16:17,630
dishonored the Chinese army,
destroyed my palace...

1079
01:16:17,702 --> 01:16:19,465
and...

1080
01:16:19,537 --> 01:16:22,665
you have saved us all.

1081
01:16:29,413 --> 01:16:31,040
Ah! Ooh!

1082
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:53,126
[Mushu sniffles]

1083
01:16:53,204 --> 01:16:57,573
My little baby is all grown up
and... and savin' China.

1084
01:16:57,642 --> 01:16:59,542
You have a tissue?

1085
01:17:02,346 --> 01:17:05,338
- Chi Fu.
- Your Excellency?

1086
01:17:05,416 --> 01:17:08,749
See to it that this woman
is made a member of my council.

1087
01:17:08,819 --> 01:17:11,344
Member... what?
[Stammering] But...

1088
01:17:11,422 --> 01:17:16,121
There are no council positions open,
Your Majesty.

1089
01:17:16,193 --> 01:17:18,991
Very well.
You can have his job.

1090
01:17:19,063 --> 01:17:21,827
What? I... Oh.

1091
01:17:24,035 --> 01:17:27,027
With all due respect,
Your Excellency,

1092
01:17:27,104 --> 01:17:29,834
I think I've been away
from home long enough.

1093
01:17:29,907 --> 01:17:32,205
Then... take this,

1094
01:17:32,276 --> 01:17:36,906
so your family will know
what you have done for me.

1095
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:39,040
And this,

1096
01:17:39,116 --> 01:17:44,520
so the world will know
what you have done for China.

1097
01:17:48,459 --> 01:17:49,756
[Emperor chuckles]

1098
01:17:49,827 --> 01:17:52,921
Is she allowed to do that?

1099
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:05,072
[Crying]

1100
01:18:06,777 --> 01:18:09,974
Um... you...

1101
01:18:10,047 --> 01:18:12,572
You fight good.

1102
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:15,517
Oh. Thank you.

1103
01:18:19,423 --> 01:18:21,084
[Groans]

1104
01:18:24,028 --> 01:18:26,758
Khan, let's go home.

1105
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:30,699
[Crowd cheers]

1106
01:18:31,969 --> 01:18:33,960
[Clears throat]

1107
01:18:34,038 --> 01:18:37,496
The flower that blooms in adversity

1108
01:18:37,575 --> 01:18:41,204
is the most rare and beautiful of all.

1109
01:18:41,278 --> 01:18:42,267
Sir?

1110
01:18:42,346 --> 01:18:46,305
You don't meet a girl
like that every dynasty.

1111
01:19:17,114 --> 01:19:18,809
Mulan!

1112
01:19:18,883 --> 01:19:22,614
Father, I brought you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

1113
01:19:24,088 --> 01:19:26,886
And the crest of the emperor.

1114
01:19:28,225 --> 01:19:31,752
They're gifts,
to honor the Fa family.

1115
01:19:38,235 --> 01:19:43,537
The greatest gift and honor
is having you for a daughter.

1116
01:19:44,909 --> 01:19:47,275
I've missed you so.

1117
01:19:47,344 --> 01:19:49,574
I've missed you, too, Baba.

1118
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:58,618
- [Sighs]
- Great. She brings a sword.

1119
01:19:58,689 --> 01:20:01,317
If you ask me, she should've
brought home a man.

1120
01:20:01,392 --> 01:20:02,381
Excuse me.

1121
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,826
Does Fa Mulan live here?

1122
01:20:07,264 --> 01:20:08,629
Thank you.

1123
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:12,135
Whoo! Sign me up for the next war!

1124
01:20:14,071 --> 01:20:17,563
Honorable Fa Zhou, I...
Mulan!

1125
01:20:17,641 --> 01:20:20,940
Uh... you forgot your helmet.

1126
01:20:21,011 --> 01:20:24,037
W-well, actually,
it's your helmet, isn't it?

1127
01:20:24,114 --> 01:20:25,775
I mean...

1128
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:28,182
Would you like to stay for dinner?

1129
01:20:28,252 --> 01:20:31,688
[Grandmother] Would you
like to stay forever?

1130
01:20:31,755 --> 01:20:33,746
Dinner would be great.

1131
01:20:37,228 --> 01:20:39,856
Come on.
Who did a good job?

1132
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:42,330
Come on. Tell me.
Who did a good job?

1133
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:46,995
Oh, all right!
You can be a guardian again.

1134
01:20:47,071 --> 01:20:50,871
Aah-ha!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1135
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,273
Take it, Cri-Kee!

1136
01:20:58,349 --> 01:21:00,544
[Whooping]

1137
01:21:00,618 --> 01:21:03,746
You know, she gets it
from my side of the family.

1138
01:21:08,559 --> 01:21:10,652
[Mushu]
Call out for egg rolls!

1139

1140
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:18,157

1141
01:21:19,703 --> 01:21:21,796
