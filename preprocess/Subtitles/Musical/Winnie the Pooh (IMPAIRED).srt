Otherwise, I wouldn't have seen it.

Pooh was puzzled by the note.
Even more so than usual.

And even more than that.

324

So, Pooh decided to go directly
to Owl's house,

783
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:33,369
I can't believe how wonderful
that speech was.

784
00:41:33,462 --> 00:41:34,791
I can't, either.

785
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,956
Moved me to tears.

786
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,011
[narrator] So Piglet bravely ventured
forth towards Christopher Robin's house.

787
00:41:42,096 --> 00:41:47,090
But the further he went,
the more frightened he became.

788
00:41:47,184 --> 00:41:50,221
[whimpering] Oh, dear.

789
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,138
I mustn't fear.

790
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:58,315
There's a very important thing to...

791
00:41:58,404 --> 00:42:02,271
[heavy stammer] Do...

792
00:42:02,366 --> 00:42:03,991
[screams]

793
00:42:04,076 --> 00:42:06,532
[whimpering]

794
00:42:09,248 --> 00:42:14,124
Oh. It's just you, B'loon.
I'll get some help.

795
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:17,334
Oh, dear. I am the help.

796
00:42:19,842 --> 00:42:22,214
How did you ever get stuck up there?

797
00:42:22,303 --> 00:42:25,387
It wasn't the Backson, was it?

798
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:28,380
Oh, good.

799
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:30,599
I knew the Backson wasn't around here.

800
00:42:30,686 --> 00:42:32,513
[grunts]

801
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:42,817

[moaning]

803
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:47,780
[stammering] Backson!

804
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,863
Huh?! Backson?

805
00:42:51,499 --> 00:42:53,787
- [screaming]
- Piglet, help!

806
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,158
Whew.

807
00:42:57,254 --> 00:42:58,962
[shouting]

808
00:43:08,224 --> 00:43:11,806
Let me tell you, that was the last time
I'll ever put my beak

809
00:43:11,894 --> 00:43:13,637
- in a keyhole.
- Shh-shh-shh!

810
00:43:13,729 --> 00:43:16,220
[whispers] Do you hear something?

811
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:19,434
- Help! Help me!
- Piglet!

812
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:21,603
He knows my name!

813
00:43:23,072 --> 00:43:24,649
[blowing hard]

814
00:43:26,992 --> 00:43:28,617
- Yeah!
- [gasp]

815
00:43:29,745 --> 00:43:31,323
Whoa! Oh!

816
00:43:31,413 --> 00:43:33,073
[shouting]

817
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,839
Ah!

818
00:43:42,758 --> 00:43:45,249
- [straining]
- [grunting]

00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:51,391

00:43:51,475 --> 00:43:53,302
[screams]

821
00:43:55,187 --> 00:43:56,847
[Piglet groans]

822
00:43:57,565 --> 00:43:58,727
[all gasp] Backson!

823
00:43:59,942 --> 00:44:02,100
Whew! It's only Tigger.

824
00:44:02,194 --> 00:44:05,361
Oh! Hi, fellas!

825
00:44:05,448 --> 00:44:09,397
Tigger Two?
I thought the Backson got you.

826
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:11,402
Ahh. As soon as we get out of here,

827
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:15,030
we're gonna show that Backson
what Tiggers are made of, aren't we?

828
00:44:15,124 --> 00:44:17,994
Thanks, but I'd rather stay an Eeyore.

829
00:44:18,085 --> 00:44:21,086
What? But what about all the pouncing
and the trouncing?

830
00:44:21,172 --> 00:44:23,923
And the mixing it up?
I thought you liked being a Tigger.

831
00:44:24,008 --> 00:44:26,629
The most wonderful thing about Tiggers,

832
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:29,673
is you're the only one.

833
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:33,678
Aw, shucks. I'm speechless.

834
00:44:33,768 --> 00:44:35,048
[Piglet] Excuse me.

835
00:44:35,144 --> 00:44:38,809
- I can't breathe! [groans]
- [Tigger] Oh.

836
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,600
Sorry about that, little guy.
I didn't mean to scare you.

837
00:44:45,696 --> 00:44:47,985
Wait! B'loon! Don't leave!

838
00:44:49,074 --> 00:44:51,482
[Piglet] You're the only one
who can get us out of here!

839
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:54,412
We're all gonna die.

840
00:44:55,289 --> 00:44:57,614
Cheer up, Eeyore.
We won't perish for days.

841
00:44:57,708 --> 00:45:00,626
Which leaves plenty of time for me
to continue my memoirs.

842
00:45:00,711 --> 00:45:02,170
Now, dear Uncle Ridley...

843
00:45:02,254 --> 00:45:03,713
♪ Honey ♪

844
00:45:03,798 --> 00:45:05,541
[Owl] ...exacerbated
by my aunt's predilection

845
00:45:05,633 --> 00:45:07,921
- for only the finest parchment...
- Hmm. [gasps]

846
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,631
...woven so tightly
the ink took weeks to fully dry.

847
00:45:10,721 --> 00:45:13,758
Their nest was littered with quills
that were never used,

848
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:16,423
papers that were never cut,
and letters that never dried.

849
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:20,386
My aunt often bemoaned the situation in
letters that she couldn't write to me.

850
00:45:20,481 --> 00:45:23,316
It drove my poor uncle absolutely batty,

851
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,022
which is quite a feat for an owl,
I assure you.

852
00:45:26,112 --> 00:45:29,397
Now, when my uncle had committed
an exceedingly rousing point...

853
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:30,688
Empty.

854
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:34,661
...and let me tell you,
it packed quite a wallop.

855
00:45:34,745 --> 00:45:36,323
- [groans]
- Huh?

856
00:45:36,413 --> 00:45:37,658
Look! Look, the letters!

857
00:45:37,748 --> 00:45:40,120
The ladder! The ladders formed a letter!

858
00:45:40,209 --> 00:45:42,285
I mean the letters... We can get out!

859
00:45:42,378 --> 00:45:47,087
[narrator] And so they all used the
letter ladder to climb out of the pit.

860
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:51,295
But little did they know that
coming through the bushes was...

861
00:45:51,387 --> 00:45:53,629
- [branches snapping]
- [all gasp] Backson!

862
00:45:53,722 --> 00:45:55,181
Back to the pit!

863
00:45:55,266 --> 00:45:57,554
[Christopher] Wait, everyone.

864
00:45:58,185 --> 00:46:00,142
It's only me.

865
00:46:00,229 --> 00:46:02,518
[all] Christopher Robin!

866
00:46:03,732 --> 00:46:06,021
You found them, B'loon. Well done.

867
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,897
It's Christopher Robin!

868
00:46:08,988 --> 00:46:11,146
How did you escape from the Backson?

869
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,157
Backson? What on earth is a Backson?

870
00:46:14,243 --> 00:46:15,488
He wakes up babies!

871
00:46:15,578 --> 00:46:16,953
He swipes your stripes!

872
00:46:17,037 --> 00:46:18,580
He puts out the lights!

873
00:46:18,664 --> 00:46:22,199
Yes, and we thought he took you from us.

874
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:25,911
What gave you the idea
I was taken by a Backson?

875
00:46:26,005 --> 00:46:27,629
Your note.

876
00:46:28,966 --> 00:46:33,675
[narrator] Christopher Robin explained
that it had all been a misunderstanding.

877
00:46:33,763 --> 00:46:36,633
And now that it was autumn,
the school year had begun.

878
00:46:36,724 --> 00:46:41,849
His note was simply to say he had
gone out and would be back soon.

879
00:46:43,189 --> 00:46:45,430
[all] Oh!

00:46:47,735 --> 00:46:49,312
Ooh. Um...

881
00:46:52,114 --> 00:46:54,190
OK.

882
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:56,691
It's getting late.
We ought to be heading back.

883
00:46:56,786 --> 00:46:57,953
Just a moment, everyone.

884
00:46:57,953 --> 00:46:58,570
Just a moment, everyone.

885
00:46:58,662 --> 00:47:00,454
Oh, yes. You're right, Piglet.

886
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:02,615
We owe a very special someone...

887
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:05,958
...a token of our appreciation.

888
00:47:06,045 --> 00:47:07,243
Ohh!

889
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:11,336
This reward goes to a good friend
and a loyal companion.

890
00:47:11,425 --> 00:47:13,797
Someone who not only helped us
out of this pit,

891
00:47:13,886 --> 00:47:16,211
but also found Christopher Robin.

892
00:47:16,305 --> 00:47:20,255
And he just so happens
to be wearing red today.

893
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:23,435
So it is with great, great honour
and a humble heart,

894
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:27,768
that I bestow this pot of honey
upon our dear friend...

895
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:29,103
...B'loon.

896
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:30,652
Wonderful idea, Rabbit.

897
00:47:30,736 --> 00:47:33,227
- Hooray!
- Hooray, B'loon!

898
00:47:33,823 --> 00:47:37,274
- Thank you, B'loon. Goodbye.
- Hooray!

899
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:41,496
[narrator] Pooh watched as B'loon took
the honey pot higher and higher,

900
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:46,373
until it was completely out of sight.

901
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,212
Oh, bother.

902
00:47:55,344 --> 00:47:57,586
Sorry, Pooh.

903
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,508
Ever have one of those days
where you just can't win, Eeyore?

904
00:48:02,601 --> 00:48:06,220
Yep. I know how you feel.

905
00:48:10,484 --> 00:48:12,691
- [rumbling]
- Oh, yes.

906
00:48:12,778 --> 00:48:15,067
I simply must find some honey.

907
00:48:15,156 --> 00:48:18,322
[narrator] As Pooh continued searching,
he got hungrier...

908
00:48:19,577 --> 00:48:21,818
- Oh!
- ...and hungrier...

909
00:48:22,621 --> 00:48:25,706
- Yes, tummy, I know.
- ...and hungrier...

910
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:27,700
Ohh...

911
00:48:27,793 --> 00:48:31,376
...until he found himself
at Owl's house.

912
00:48:45,895 --> 00:48:46,926
[bell jingles]

913
00:48:49,106 --> 00:48:51,858
Well, stone the crows.
If it isn't Pooh Bear.

914
00:48:51,942 --> 00:48:54,231
Hello, Owl.

915
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,404
Well, congratulate me.

916
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:00,159
- For what?
- I have achieved completion

917
00:49:00,242 --> 00:49:03,243
of my autobiographical treatise!

918
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:05,072
Oh! Was it painful?

919
00:49:05,164 --> 00:49:08,331
No, no, no. My memoirs are finished.

920
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:09,662
Oh.

921
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:13,959
Dash it all, Pooh. Why do you keep
staring at that bell rope?

922
00:49:14,048 --> 00:49:18,840
Because it reminds me of something.

923
00:49:18,928 --> 00:49:21,679
And that reminds me
of another something.

924
00:49:21,764 --> 00:49:23,756
Perhaps I could borrow some honey?

925
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:27,681
Just a taste? A drop, perhaps?

926
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,430
A small lick, I should think.

927
00:49:29,522 --> 00:49:32,523
My boy, I shall do better than that.

928
00:49:32,608 --> 00:49:34,601
Not only will I beckon you to my table,

929
00:49:34,693 --> 00:49:38,608
but as we feast,
I shall treat you to an excerpt

930
00:49:38,697 --> 00:49:41,070
from chapter 127,

931
00:49:41,158 --> 00:49:45,536
which tells the gripping tale of how
only a few days ago,

932
00:49:45,621 --> 00:49:48,788
I found that very handsome bell rope
that you were admiring

933
00:49:48,874 --> 00:49:52,243
just hanging over a thistle bush.

934
00:49:52,336 --> 00:49:53,664
Thistle bush?

935
00:49:53,754 --> 00:49:55,546
Or was it a gorse bush?

936
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:58,834
No. No. It was definitely
a thistle bush.

937
00:49:58,926 --> 00:50:00,171
Pardon me, Owl.

938
00:50:00,261 --> 00:50:02,930
At first I thought someone lived there,
so I rang it.

939
00:50:03,013 --> 00:50:04,258
No one answered.

940
00:50:04,348 --> 00:50:07,219
And then the thing just fell off
in my hand.

941
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:11,307
What sort of place

And you can tell him he's welcome.
