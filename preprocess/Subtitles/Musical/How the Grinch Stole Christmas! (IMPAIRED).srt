Now, please, don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.

6
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,825
It could be perhaps
that his shoes were too tight.

It could be his head
wasn't screwed on just right.

But I think that
the most likely reason of all...

9
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,880
...may have been that his heart
was two sizes too small.

[WHOS SINGING
"WELCOME CHRISTMAS"]

153
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:22,113
But this sound wasn't sad.

154
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,785
Why, this sound sounded glad.

155
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:33,416
Every Who down in Who-ville,
the tall and the small...

156
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:38,380
...was singing without any presents at all.

157
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:43,843
He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming,
it came.

158
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:50,558
Somehow or other, it came just the same.

159
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:55,730
And the Grinch,
with his Grinch feet ice-cold in the snow...

160
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,234
...stood puzzling and puzzling.

161
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:03,989
How could it be so?
It came without ribbons.

162
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,076
It came without tags.

163
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,957
It came without packages, boxes or bags.

164
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:19,170
He puzzled and puzzed
till his puzzler was sore.

165
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,799
Then the Grinch thought of something
he hadn't before.

166
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:28,513
"Maybe Christmas," he thought,
"doesn't come from a store.

167
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:34,769
Maybe Christmas, perhaps,
means a little bit more."

168
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:24,360
And what happened then?
Well, in Who-ville they say...

169
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:30,742
...that the Grinch's small heart
grew three sizes that day.

170
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,706
And then the true meaning of Christmas
came through.

171
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:42,504
And the Grinch found the strength
of 10 Grinches plus two.

172
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,883
And now that his heart
didn't feel quite so tight...

173
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,261
...he whizzed with his load
through the bright morning light.

174
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,765
With a smile in his soul,
he descended Mount Crumpit...

175
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,268
...cheerily blowing Who-Who
on his trumpet.

176
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,062
[TRUMPET PLAYING]

177
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,232
He rode into Who-ville,
he brought back their toys.

178
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:06,069
He brought back their floof
to the Who girls and boys.

179
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:10,281
He brought back their snoof
and their tringlers and fuzzels.

180
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,160
He brought back their pantookas,
their dafflers and wuzzels.

181
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:18,373
He brought everything back,
all the food for the feast.

182
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:23,378
And he himself, The Grinch...

183
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:27,048
...carved the roast beast.

184
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:34,305
Welcome Christmas, bring your cheer.
Cheer to all Whos far and near.

185
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,727
Christmas day is in our grasp,
so long as we have hands to clasp.

186
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:45,233
Christmas day will always be
just as long as we have we.

187
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:52,407
Welcome Christmas while we stand,
heart to heart and hand in hand.

188
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,746
