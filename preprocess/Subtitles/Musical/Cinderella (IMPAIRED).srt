So, we're arranging the conditions.

326
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,339
But, Your Majesty, if the
Prince should suspect.

327
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,219
Suspect!

328
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,059
Look, the boy's coming
home today, isn't he?

329
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,099
Yes, Sire.

330
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,339
Well, what could be more natural
than a ball to celebrate his return?

331
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,299
(STAMMERS) Nothing, Sire.

332
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,299
If all the eligible maidens
in my kingdom just

333
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,699
(LAUGHS) happened to be there,

334
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,059
why, he's bound to show interest
in one of them, isn't he?

335
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,819
Isn't he?

336
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,459
(STAMMERS) Yes, Sire.

337
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,285
The moment he does...

338
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,379
Soft lights.

339
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,059
Romantic music.

340
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,761
All the trimmings!

341
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,603
It can't possibly fail.

342
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,250
Can it?

343
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,619
(STAMMERS) Yes, Sire. No, Sire!

344
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,979
Very well, Sire.

345
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,739
I shall arrange the ball for...

346
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,379
- Tonight.
- Tonight? Tonight!

347
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,059
- Oh, but, Sire...
- Tonight!

348
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,619
And see that every
eligible maid is there.

349
