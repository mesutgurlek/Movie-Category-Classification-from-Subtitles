How do you get to Wonderland

4
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:46,880
Over the hill or under land

5
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:51,260
Or just behind the tree

They roll away
and leave the sky

beyond the isles

That people cannot see

Where do stars go

Where is the crescent moon

13
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:24,293

to a book
with no pictures?

Nothing would

extra-special powers

I keep wishing

78
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,170
It could be that way

79
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,173
Because my world
would be

Better look first.

00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,353
Oh, no!

173
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,439
But of course,
you've got the key.

174
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,024
Key?

175
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:29,862
Don't tell me you've
left it up there?

176
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,613
Oh, dear.

177
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,205
Whatever will I do?

178
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,374
Try the box,
naturally.

179
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,334
Oh!

180
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,628
" Eat me."
All right.

181
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,548
Goodness knows
what this will do.

182
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,049
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

183
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,761
Hmpfh shmfrumph.

184
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,346
What did you say?

185
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,851
A little of that
went a long way.

186
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:03,395
I don't think
it's funny.

187
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,398
Now I shall
never get home.

188
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,400
Oh, come,
come now.

189
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,027
Crying
won't help.

190
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,403
I know,

191
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:15,824
but l..l..l
just can't stop.

192
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,994
Say,
this won't do.

193
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,416
It won't do
at all.

194
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,920
You!
You up there.

195
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,922
Stop!
Stop, I say!

196
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,423
Oh, look!

197
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:32,925
The bottle.

198
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,343
The bot--

199
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,771
Oh, dear.

200
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,106
I wish I hadn't

201
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,525
cried so much.

202
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,950
A sailor's life
is the life for me

203
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,452
How I love to sail
o'er the bounding sea

204
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,788
And I never never ever
do a thing about the weather

205
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,374
For the weather never ever
does a thing for me

206
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,750
Oh

207
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,752
A sailor's life
is the life for me

208
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:09,920
Tiddlee um pom pom

209
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,129
Deedle dum dum dee

210
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,214
And I never--

211
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,298
Ahoy!

212
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,259
Another nautical
expression.

213
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,844
Land ho, by Jove.

214
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,554
Where away, Dodo?

215
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,596
Dodo?

216
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,431
Three points
to starboard.

217
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,559
Pull away,
me hearties.

218
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,603
Have you in port
in no time.

219
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,105
Mr. Dodo!

220
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,108
Please! Please help me!

221
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,406
Pardon me,
but, uh...

222
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:41,326
would you mind
helping me, please?

223
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,287
Yoo hoo!

224
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,788
Yoo hoo!

225
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,290
Help me!

226
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,457
Please!

227
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,462
Help me!

228
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,341
Forward, backward,
inward, outward

229
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,010
Come and join
the chase

230
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,305
Nothing could be drier
than ajolly caucus race

231
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,806
Backward, forward,
outward, inward

232
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,308
Bottom to the top

233
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,642
Never a beginning

234
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,769
There can never
be a stop

235
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,271
To skipping,
hopping, tripping

236
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,939
Fancy free and gay

237
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,609
I started it tomorrow,
but will finish yesterday

238
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,360
Round and round
and round we go

239
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,112
Until forever more

240
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:20,282
Once we were behind,
but now we find we are

241
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,825
Forward, backward,
inward, outward

242
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,452
Come and join
the chase

243
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,121
Nothing could be drier
than ajolly caucus race

244
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:30,167
I say, you'll never
get dry that way.

245
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,293
Get dry?

246
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:35,297
You have to run
with the others.

247
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,174
But how can l--

248
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:41,637
Have you dry
in no time.

249
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,973
No one can get dry
this way.

250
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,226
Nonsense.
I'm dry already.

251
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,977
Yes, but--

252
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,395
All right, chaps,

253
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,980
Iook lively!

254
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,400
The white rabbit.

255
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,069
Mr. Rabbit!

256
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,487
Mr. Rabbit!

257
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,656
My goodness.
I'm late! I'm late!

258
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:01,990
I'll be back.

259
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,743
I'm late,
I'm late, I'm late!

260
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,703
Stop kicking
that mackerel.

261
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,376
Mr. Rabbit!

262
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,877
Oh, Mr. Rabbit!

263
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,088
Oh, dear.

264
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,382
I'm sure he came
this way.

265
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,425
Could he be hiding?

266
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,594
Hmm.

267
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,097
Not here.

268
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:27,933
I wonder...

269
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,904
No. I suppose
he must have--

270
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,782
Why, what peculiar
little figures.

271
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,578
Tweedle Dee
and Tweedle Dum.

272
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,954
Honk!

273
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,915
If you think we're waxworks,
you ought to pay.

274
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,960
If you think we're alive,
you ought to speak to us.

275
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,087
Beep!

276
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:57,921
Honk!

277
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:58,755
Beep!

278
00:13:58,839 --> 00:13:59,590
Honk!

279
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:00,424
Beep!

280
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,425
Honk!

281
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,426
Beep!
Honk!

282
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,552
That's logic!

283
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,430
Well, it's been nice
meeting you.

284
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,432
Good-bye.

285
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,933
You're beginning
backwards.

286
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,936
The first thing
is to say...

287
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,396
" How do you do"
and shake hands

288
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,439
Shake hands

289
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,815
Shake hands

290
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,066
" How do you do"
and shake hands

291
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,943
State your name
and business

292
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,403
That's manners!
That's manners!

293
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,946
Really?

294
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,948
My name is Alice.

295
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,451
I'm following
a white rabbit.

296
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,952
You can't go yet.

297
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,913
The visit is
just started.

298
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:31,997
Sorry.

299
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,958
Like to play
hide-and-seek

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,419
or who's got
the button?

301
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:41,256
If you stay long enough,
we might battle.

302
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,758
That's very kind.

303
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,343
But I must be going.

304
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,094
Why?
Why?

305
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,764
I'm following
a white rabbit.

306
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,683
I'm curious to know
where he's going.

307
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,936
Oh, she's curious.

308
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,479
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

309
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,023
The oysters
were curious, too.

310
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:02,194
Aye. And you remember
what happened to them.

311
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:05,280
Poor things.
Poor things.

312
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:08,450
Why? What happened
to the oysters?

313
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,369
You wouldn't
be interested.

314
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,372
You're in too much
ofa hurry.

315
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,791
Perhaps, I could
spare a little time.

316
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,544
You could? Well...

317
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,837
Beep!

318
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,381
The walrusand
the carpenter.

319
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:25,884
Or the story
of the curious oysters.

320
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,219
Honk!

321
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,637
Beep! Beep!

322
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:30,889
Honk!

323
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,058
The sun was
shining on the sea

324
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,810
Shining
with all its might

325
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,854
He did his
very best to make

326
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,189
The billows
smooth and bright

327
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:42,067
And this was odd
because it was...

328
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,486
The middle
of the night

329
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,580
The walrus
and the carpenter

330
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,582
Were walking
close at hand

331
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,584
The beach was wide
from side to side

332
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,336
But much
too full of sand

333
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,255
Mr. Walrus,
said the carpenter

334
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,757
My brain
begins to perk

335
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,843
We'll sweep this clear
in 'alfa year

336
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,761
lf you don't mind
the work

337
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,514
Work!
Uh...brrrr.

338
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,682

Good luck, Bill.

Poor Bill.

516
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,265
Uh...perhaps
we should try

517
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,225
a more energetic
remedy.

00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:36,393
Yes!

Anything,
but hurry!

520
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,981
I propose
that we, uh...

521
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,358
Yes?

I propose
that we...

523

That's it!
We'll burn the house down!

Oh, we'll smoke

We'll put
the beast to rout

Some kindling,
a stick or two

532
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:06,215
Ah, this bit
ofrubbish ought to do

533
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:08,133
We'll smoke
the blighter out

534

We'll toast

Just fetch that gate,
we'll make it clear

That monsters
aren't welcome here

Oh, a garden!

Perhaps if
I ate something,

551
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:46,296
it would make me
smaller.

Oow!

I'm here!
I should be there!

Must go!
Good-bye!

Doyou

No. Sorry.
Mr. Rabbit!

No cooperation.
No cooperation at all.

Can't have
monsters about.

carry on alone.

Wait. Please!

571

Just a minute!

00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,304
Oh, dear.

573

I'll never catch him
while I'm this small.

Why...

575

You mean bread
and butterflies.

I beg your pardon,
but did you...

584
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:09,046
That's nonsense.
Flowers can't talk.

585
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,965
But of course
we can talk, my dear.

If there's
anyone worth
talking to.

Let's sing
TeIllt To the Tulips.

What garden
are you from?

I don't come
from any garden.

a wildflower!

What specie or genus
are you, my dear?

me a genus humanus Alice.

00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,687
Meoooow!

675
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,689
Arf!. Arf!. Arf!.

676
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:41,485
All right,
if that's how you feel.

677
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:44,446
If l were
my right size,

678
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,032
I could pick
each of you!

679
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,992
That'd
teach you.

680
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:51,036
Ha ha ha ha!

681
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,961
You can learn a lot
from the flowers.

682
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:03,340
Hmph! They could learn
a lot about manners.

683
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:09,346
A

684
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:13,934

A E I O U

691
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,264
Who...

692
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:53,265
are...

693
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,058
you?

694
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:57,311
Why, I hardly
know, sir.

695
00:32:57,352 --> 00:33:01,106
I've changed so many times,
you see--

696
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,108
I do not see.

697
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:04,693
Explain yourself.

698
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:07,821
I can't explain
myself, sir,

699
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:10,449
because I'm not
myself, you know.

700
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:12,910
I do not know.

701
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:14,745
I can't be clearer.

702
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:17,080
It isn't
clear to me.

703
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,123
You?

704
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:21,293
Who are you?

705
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:23,795
Well, you ought
to tell me--

706
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:26,757
[Cough cough]

707
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,258
Who...

708
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:30,552
you are first.

709
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:31,845
Why?

710
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:36,475
Oh, dear. Everything
is so confusing.

711
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:37,768
It is not.

712
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:39,144
It is to me.

713
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:40,479
Why?

714
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:43,482
I can't remember
things as I used to.

715
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:44,483
Recite.

716
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:45,400
Hmm?

717
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,820
Oh! Yes, sir.

718
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:48,987
Um...

719
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:51,281
how doth the
little busy bee

720
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:52,825
improve each--

721
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:53,826
Stop!

722
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,788
That is not spoken
correcti-cally.

723
00:33:57,871 --> 00:33:59,331
It goes...

724
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:02,835
how...

725
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,551
Ha ha ha ha.

726
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:12,845
A-hem.

727
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:15,222
How doth the little
crocodile

728
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:17,766
improve his shining tail

729
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:21,228
and pour the waters
ofthe Nile

730
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,689
on every golden scale?

731
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,315
How cheer--

732
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:27,568
How cheer--

733
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:31,572
A-hem!

734
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:34,116
Ha ha ha ha.

735
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,870
How cheerfully
he seems to grin.

736
00:34:37,953 --> 00:34:41,248
How neatly
spreads his claws.

737
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,792
And welcomes
little fishes in

738
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:47,379
with gently smiling jaws.

739
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:50,924
I've never heard it
that way before.

740
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,969
I have improved it.

741
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:54,970
Well...

742
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:56,263
[Cough cough]

743
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,265
If you ask me--

744
00:34:58,307 --> 00:34:59,600
You?

745
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:02,477
Who are you?

746
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:04,813
[Cough cough]

747
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:06,273
[Cough cough]

748
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:07,858
Ah-choo!

749
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:10,861
Oh!

750
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:20,746
You there!

751
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:21,747
Girl!

752
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,248
Wait!

753
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:25,042
Come back!

754
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,252
I have something
important to say!

755
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:29,546
Oh, dear.

756
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:33,884
I wonder what
he wants now.

757
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:38,055
Oh!

758
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:46,730
Well?

759
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:51,860
Keep your temper.

760
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:53,487
Is that all?

761
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:55,572
No.

762
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,953
Exacti-cally
what is your problem?

763
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:02,663
Well,
it's exactic--

764
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:03,831
Exactic--

765
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:06,250
It's precisely this.

766
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,836
I'd like
to be larger, sir.

767
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:09,920
Why?

768
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,380
Well, after all...

769
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,299
3 inches is
a wretched height.

770
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:17,636
I am exactically
three inches high,

771
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,848
and it's a very
good height indeed!

772
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:23,892
[ Alice ]
But I'm not used to it,

773
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:25,811
and you needn't...

774
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:26,854
shout!

775
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,316
Oh, dear.

776
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,486
I have some more
helpful hints.

777
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,780
One side makes
you grow taller.

778
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:38,448
One side ofwhat?

779
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:41,535
The other side
makes you grow shorter.

780
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:43,787
The other side
of what?

781
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,039
The mushroom,
of course!

782
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:50,335
Hmm.

783
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:57,801
One side will
make me grow...

784
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,845
But which is which?

785
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:02,306
Hmm.

786
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,808
After all that's
happened, l...

787
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:06,810
I wonder if l...

788
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:08,353
I don't care.

789
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:12,649
I'm tired of being
3 inches high.

790
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,026
Yi! Yi! Yi! Yi!

791
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:15,861
Yi! Yi! Yi! Yi!

792
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:19,156
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

793
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:24,578
Ah!

794
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,455
A serpent!

795
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:28,874
Help! Help!

796
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:30,876
A serpent! A serpent!

797
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,419
Please, please!

798
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:34,880
Off with you!
Shoo! Shoo!

799
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:36,507
Go away! Serpent!

800
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,884
But I'm not
a serpent!

801
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,302
Indeed?

802
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,346
Just what are you?

803
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:43,805
A little girl.

804
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:44,890
Little?

805
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:46,183
Ha! Little?

806
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,768
Ah ha ha ha ha!

807
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:49,353
Well, I am.

808
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:51,813
I mean, I was.

809
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:54,608
I supposeyou don't
eat eggs, either.

810
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,193
Yes, I do.

811
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:58,529
I knew it!

812
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:01,532
Serpent!
Serpeeeeeeeeent!

813
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:03,617
Oh, for goodness sake!

814
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,704
And the other side will...

815
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:09,248
The very idea!

816
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:14,044
Spend all my time
laying eggs for
serpents like her!

817
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,546
Ahhhhhhhh!

818
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,801
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

819
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:21,885
Oh!

820
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,304
Goodness.

821
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:29,393
I wonder if l'll ever
get the knack ofit.

822
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:36,900
There. That's
much better.

823
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:40,404
Hmm. Better save these.

824
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:45,868
Now, let's see.

825
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,411
Where was l?

826
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:53,876
Hmm. I wonder which way
I ought to go.

827
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,502
'Twas...

828
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:59,381
Brillig and
the slithy toves

829
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:03,510
Did gyre and
gimbel in the wabe

830
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:05,888
All mimsy

831
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:07,890
Were the borogoves

832
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:12,311
And the momeraths
outgrabe

833
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:15,230
Now, where do you
suppose that...

834
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:16,732
Lose something?

835
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:18,317
Oh! Well, uh...

836
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,445
Ha ha ha.
I-l was...no...

837
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,530
I-l mean...
I-l was wondering...

838
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:25,115
That's all right.

839
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,950
One moment, please.

840
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:29,036
Ooh!

841
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:32,748
Second chorus.

842
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:35,083
'Twas brillig

Did gyre and
gimbel in the wabe

00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:44,676
Why...why,
you're a cat.

846
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,387
A Cheshire cat.

847
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:48,722
All mimsy

848
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:50,724
Were the borogoves

849
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,100
Oh, wait.

850
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:53,727
Don't go, please!

851
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:55,103
There you are.

852
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:56,605
Third chorus.

853
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,398
I wanted to ask

854
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:01,235
which way
I ought to go.

855
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:04,071
Well, that depends...

856
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:07,199
on where...
you want to get to.

857
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:09,827
It really doesn't
matter, as long--

858
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,913
Then...it really
doesn't matter...

859
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:16,250
which way...you go.

860
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,377
Ah hah, hah hah

861
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,296
All mimsy
were the borogoves

862
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:23,298
And the momeraths
outgrabe

863
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:28,428
Oh, by the way...

864
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,306
if you'd really
like to know,

865
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:33,642
he went...that way.

866
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:35,435
Who did?

867
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:36,770
The white rabbit.

868
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:37,980
He did?

869
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:39,147
Did what?

870
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:40,065
Went that way?

871
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:40,899
Who did?

872
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:42,025
The white rabbit.

873
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,277
What rabbit?

874
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,112
Didn't you say...

875
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:46,780
Oh, dear!

876
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:49,658
Can you stand
on your head?

877
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:50,993
Oh!

878
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:52,286
However...

879
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:56,123
if l were looking
for a white rabbit...

880
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:57,291
[Clunk]

881
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,960
I'd ask the Mad Hatter.

882
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:02,212
The Mad Hatter?

883
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,672
No, I don't--

884
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,800
Or...there's
the March Hare

885
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:09,219
in that direction.

886
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:12,139
Thank you.
I shall visit him.

887
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:13,682
Of course...

888
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:15,434
he's mad, too.

889
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:18,228
I don't want to
be with mad people.

890
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,981
Oh, you can't
help that.

891
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:23,233
Most everyone's
mad here.

892
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:26,320
Ha ha ha ha ha!

893
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:30,407
You may
have noticed

894
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:34,995
that I'm not
all there myself.

895
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:42,336
And the momeraths
outgrabe...

896
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:44,546
Goodness. If people
here are like that,

897
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,550
I must try not
to upset them.

898
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,763
How very curious.

899
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:54,681
lfthere are
no objections

900
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,558
Let it be unanimous

901
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:58,352
Oh, a very
merry unbirthday

902
00:41:58,393 --> 00:42:00,562
A very merry
unbirthday

903
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:03,899
A very merry
unbirthday to us

904
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,835
A

905
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:25,003
Very merry
unbirthday to me

906
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:25,921
To who

907
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:27,256
Oh, you

908
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:28,757
A very merry
unbirthday to you

909
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:29,758
Who, me

910
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,009
Oh, me

911
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:32,177
Let's all
congratulate us

912
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:33,679
With another
cup of tea

913
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:36,598
A very merry
unbirthday

914
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:40,519
To...

915
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:42,062
You

916
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:44,940
[Clap clap clap]

917
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,525
No room!
No room!

00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:48,610
No room!
No room!

919
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:51,446
But there's
plenty of room.

920
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,950
It's rude to sit
without being invited.

921
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:58,579
It's very, very
rude, indeed!

922
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,415
Very, very, very
rude, indeed.

923
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:02,958
I'm very sorry.

924
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:05,961
But I did enjoy
your singing.

925
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:08,172
You enjoyed
our singing?

926
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:10,799
Oh, what
a delightful child!

927
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:11,800
I'm so excited.

928
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:13,635
We never get
compliments.

929
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,638
You must have
a cup of tea!

930
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:18,265
Ah, yes, indeed.

931
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:21,768
You must have
a cup of tea.

932
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,272
I'm sorry I interrupted
your birthday party.

933
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:26,773
Birthday?

934
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:29,610
This is not
a birthday party!

935
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,153
Of course not.

936
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:35,365
This is
an unbirthday party.

937
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:36,950
Unbirthday?

938
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:39,453
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

939
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:40,954
It's very simple.

940
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:42,956
30 days have Sept--

941
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:44,458
No. An unbirthday...

942
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,461
if you have
a birthday, then...

943
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:48,962
you...

944
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:52,174
She doesn't know
what an unbirthday is.

945
00:43:52,257 --> 00:43:55,802
How silly!
Ha ha ha ha!

946
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:57,346
Well, l...

947
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,975
I shall elucidate.

948
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:09,650
Now statistics prove

949
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:11,985
Prove that you've
one birthday

950
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:14,530
lmagine just one
birthday every year

951
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:19,451
Ah, but there are
364 unbirthdays

952
00:44:19,535 --> 00:44:22,162
Precisely why
we're gathered here to cheer

953
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:24,873
Then today's
my unbirthday, too.

954
00:44:24,957 --> 00:44:26,083
It is?

955
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:28,377
What a small world.

956
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,963
In that case...

957
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:32,881
A very merry unbirthday

whatyou're at.

969
00:45:00,993 --> 00:45:03,579
Up above
the world you fly,

970
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:06,540
Like a tea-tray
in the sky.

971
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:08,917
That was lovely.

972
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:11,128
And now, my dear,

973
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:14,840
you were saying
you were seeking...

974
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,383
Pardon me.

975
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:20,596
You were seeking
some information of some kind?

976
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:22,848
Yes. I'm looking
for--

977
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:24,850
Clean cup!
Clean cup!

978
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:26,393
Move down!

979
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:28,562
But I haven't
used my cup.

980
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:31,231
Clean cup,
move down

981
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:33,984
Would you like
more tea?

982
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:36,403
I haven't
had any yet,

983
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:38,864
So I can't take more.

984
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:41,325
You mean you
can't take less.

985
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:44,578
You can always take
more than nothing.

986
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,455
But--

987
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:48,415
And now, my dear,

988
00:45:48,457 --> 00:45:51,418
Something seems
to be troubling you.

989
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,171
Tell us
all about it.

990
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:56,048
Start at
the beginning.

991
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:57,382
Yes, yes.

992
00:45:57,466 --> 00:46:00,761
And when you
come to the end...

993
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:02,304
stop!

994
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:05,432
It started while
I was sitting

995
00:46:05,474 --> 00:46:07,684
on the riverbank
with Dinah.

996
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:09,394
Very interesting.

997
00:46:09,478 --> 00:46:11,396
Who's Dinah?

998
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,565
Dinah's my cat.

999
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:14,608
Cat?

1000
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,276
Cat!

1001
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,695
What's got
into him?

1002
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:19,863
Catch him!

1003
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:22,282
Help! Help!
Stop him!

1004
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:23,826
Get thejam!

1005
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:25,702
Put it
on his nose!

1006
00:46:25,786 --> 00:46:27,496
C-c-cat...

1007
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:28,580
Ohh...

1008
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:30,165
Oh, my goodness.

1009
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:34,294
Those are the things
that upset me.

1010
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:37,005
See the trouble
you've started?

1011
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:38,549
I didn't think--

1012
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:41,844
If you don't think,
you shouldn't talk.

1013
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:43,887
Clean cup,
move down!

1014
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:45,013
But--

1015
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:46,139
Move down,
move down

1016
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:48,183
Move down

1017
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:50,811
Now, dear,
you were saying?

1018
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:52,229
Oh, yes.

1019
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:55,065
I was sitting
on the riverbank,

1020
00:46:55,149 --> 00:46:57,442
with, uh...
you know who.

1021
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:59,444
I do?

1022
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:03,365
I mean my c-a-t.

1023
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:04,658
Tea!

1024
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:08,871
Just a half
a cup.

1025
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:10,455
Come, come, my dear,

1026
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:13,667
don't you care
for tea?

1027
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:15,836
I'm very fond
of tea.

1028
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:19,381
You could
at least make polite conversation.

1029
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:21,216
I've been
trying to ask--

1030
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,011
I have an
excellent idea.

1031
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:26,263
Let's change
the subject.

1032
00:47:27,556 --> 00:47:31,268
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

1033
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:32,686
Riddles?

1034
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:34,688
Let me see, now.

1035
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:37,691
Why is a raven

1036
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:39,693
Iike
a writing desk?

1037
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:41,278
I beg your pardon?

1038
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:44,448
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

1039
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:45,782
What?

1040
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:47,242
Careful.
She's mad.

1041
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:49,620
It's your
silly riddle.

1042
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:51,079
You just said--

1043
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:52,414
Don't get excited.

1044
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:53,707
A cup of tea?

1045
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,919
A cup of tea,
indeed!

1046
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,462
I haven't time.

1047
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:01,423
The time!
Who's got the time?

1048
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:03,926
No time,
no time, no time.

1049
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:06,094
Hello. Good-bye.
I'm late! I'm late!

1050
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:07,596
The white rabbit!

1051
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:10,307
I'm so late.
I'm so very late.

1052
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,434
No wonder you're late.

1053
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:15,646
This clock is exactly
two days slow.

1054
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:17,147
Two days slow?

1055
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,649
Of course you're late.

1056
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,150
My goodness.

1057
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:22,611
We'll have
to look into this.

1058
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:24,404
A-ha!

1059
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:26,323
I see what's wrong.

1060
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:29,159
This watch
is full of wheels.

1061
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:30,911
Oh, my poor watch.

1062
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:33,330
Oh, my wheels
and springs.

1063
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:35,165
But-but-but-but...

1064
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:36,917
Butter! Of course!

1065
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,836
It needs butter.
Butter!

1066
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:40,587
Butter!

1067
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:41,922
But-butter?

1068
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:43,841
Butter.
Thank you. Butter.

1069
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,759
That's fine.

1070
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:47,010
No, no, no.

1071
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:49,346
You'll get
crumbs in it!

1072
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:51,265
This is good butter.

1073
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:52,432
Tea?

1074
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:55,269
I never
thought of tea.

1075
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:56,687
No! Not tea!

1076
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:57,855
Sugar?

1077
00:48:57,938 --> 00:48:59,439
Sugar. Two spoons.

1078
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:01,191
Two spoons.
Thank you.

1079
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:02,693
Be careful!

1080
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:06,780
Jam! I forgot
all about jam.

1081
00:49:06,864 --> 00:49:07,823
Mustard!

1082
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:09,324
Mustard, yes.

1083
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:11,368
Mustard?

1084
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,704
Don't let's
be silly.

1085
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:15,998
Lemon.
That's different.

1086
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:19,042
That should do it.

1087
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:20,794
[Ring]

1088
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:23,005
Look at that!

1089
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:24,047
Goodness.

1090
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:25,048
Dear.

1091
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:29,011
Mad watch.

1092
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:30,387
Mad watch!

1093
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:36,685
There's only one way
to stop a mad watch.

1094
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:40,230
Two days slow,
that's what it is.

1095
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:43,066
Oh, my watch.

1096
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,193
It was?

1097
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:46,987
It was an
unbirthday present.

1098
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,155
In that case...

1099
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:50,741
A very merry unbirthday

1100
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:53,994
To

1101
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:55,496
You

1102
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:56,497
Mr. Rabbit!

1103
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,415
Oh, Mr. Rabbit!

1104
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:00,918
Now where did he go?

1105
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:03,003
...to us,
to us

1106
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:04,254
A very merry
unbirthday

1107
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,882
To us, to us

1108
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:09,593
Of all the silly nonsense.

1109
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:13,680
This is the stupidest
tea party ever.

1110
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:20,270
I've had
enough nonsense.

1111
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:22,105
I'm going home.

1112
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:23,774
Straight home.

1113
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:26,443
That rabbit.

1114
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:29,446
Who cares where
he's going anyway?

1115
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,741
Ifit hadn't
been for him, l--

1116
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:35,285
"TulgeyWood."

1117
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:38,914
Hmm. Curious.

1118
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:41,083
I don't remember this.

1119
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:46,964
Now, let me see...

1120
00:50:50,551 --> 00:50:51,468
Oh!

1121
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:56,640
No, no, please.

1122
00:50:56,723 --> 00:50:58,475
No more nonsense.

1123
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:06,150
Now, if l came
this way,

1124
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:08,986
I should go back
this way.

1125
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,946
Honk!

1126
00:51:10,988 --> 00:51:12,990
I beg your pardon.

1127
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:32,467
Goodness.

1128
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:34,678
When I get home,

1129
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,805
I shall write a book
about this place.

1130
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:40,434
If l ever do get home.

1131
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:54,990
Oh, excuse me!

1132
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:57,201
Could one of you
tell me--

1133
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,875
Uh...

1134
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,460
never mind.

1135
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,049
Caw! Caw!

1136
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:13,550
Oh, dear.

1137
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:15,511
It's getting
dreadfully dark,

1138
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:17,888
and nothing
looks familiar.

1139
00:52:28,482 --> 00:52:32,069
I'll be glad
to get out of--oh!

1140
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:49,545
Hoo.

1141
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:51,046
Hoo hoo.

1142
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:52,256
Hoo.

1143
00:52:56,093 --> 00:52:58,053
It would be nice

1144
00:52:58,095 --> 00:53:01,598
if something made
sense for a change.

1145
00:53:07,938 --> 00:53:09,022
Oh.

1146
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,740
The momeraths?

1147
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:30,127
A path!

1148
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,963
Oh, thank goodness.

1149
00:53:33,046 --> 00:53:36,800
I knew I'd find one
sooner or later.

1150
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:38,260
Ifl hurry,

1151
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:42,389
I might be home
in time for tea.

1152
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:46,560
Won't Dinah
be happy to see me.

1153
00:53:46,643 --> 00:53:48,729
I just can't
wait till l--

1154
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:06,330
Oh, dear.

1155
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:09,333
Now I shall
never get out.

1156
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:12,920
Well...

1157
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:14,838
when one's lost,

1158
00:54:14,922 --> 00:54:17,841
I suppose
it's good advice

1159
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:20,344
to stay
where you are

1160
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:23,847
until someone
finds you.

1161
00:54:23,931 --> 00:54:29,186
But...but who'd ever think
to look for me here?

1162
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:30,687
Good advice.

1163
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,858
If l'd listened
earlier,

1164
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:36,360
I wouldn't be here.

1165
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:40,364
But that's just
the trouble with me.

1166
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:44,701
I give myself
very good advice...

1167
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:48,789
But I very seldom
follow it

1168
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,377
That explains

1169
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:58,298
The trouble
that I'm always in

1170
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:01,885
Be patient

1171
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:04,805
ls very good advice

1172
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:08,392
But the waiting
makes me curious

1173
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:12,896
And I'd love
the change

1174
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:16,233
Should something
strange

1175
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:17,901
Begin

1176
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:21,864
Well...

1177
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:24,908
I went along
my merryway

1178
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:29,913
and I never
stopped to reason.

1179
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:34,376

01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:00,714
Mr. Caterpillar,
what will I do?

1513
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:03,550
Who are you?

1514
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:05,761
[Cough cough]

1515
01:13:05,844 --> 01:13:07,262
There she goes!

1516
01:13:07,346 --> 01:13:09,765
Don't let
her get away!

1517
01:13:09,807 --> 01:13:11,809
Off with her head!

1518
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:17,815
Ohh!

1519
01:13:17,898 --> 01:13:19,775
Still locked,
you know.

1520
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:22,736
The queen.
I must get out.

1521
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:24,112
But you are outside.

1522
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:25,447
What?

1523
01:13:25,489 --> 01:13:27,407
See for yourself.

1524
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:29,952
Why...
why, that's me!

1525
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:31,411
I'm asleep.

1526
01:13:31,495 --> 01:13:33,997
Don't let her
get away!

1527
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:35,916
Off with her head!

1528
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,417
Alice, wake up.

1529
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:38,627
Alice!

1530
01:13:39,753 --> 01:13:41,755
Please
wake up, Alice.

1531
01:13:41,839 --> 01:13:43,257
Alice! Alice!

1532
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,758
Alice!

1533
01:13:44,842 --> 01:13:46,260
Alice! Alice!

1534
01:13:46,343 --> 01:13:49,596
Will you pay attention
and recite your lesson?

1535
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,765
Hmm? Oh.

1536
01:13:51,849 --> 01:13:54,101
How doth
the little crocodile

1537
01:13:54,184 --> 01:13:55,435
improve
his shining tail

1538
01:13:55,519 --> 01:13:57,271
and pour
the waters of--

1539
01:13:57,354 --> 01:14:00,274
Alice, what are
you talking about?

1540
01:14:00,357 --> 01:14:01,775
Oh, I'm sorry.

1541
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:04,278
You see,
the caterpillar said--

1542
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:07,281
Caterpillar?
Oh, for goodness sake.

1543
01:14:07,364 --> 01:14:08,782
Alice, l--

1544
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:10,784
Oh, well.
Come along.

1545
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:12,786
It's time for tea.

1546
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:14,830
[Chorus]
Alice

1547
01:14:14,872 --> 01:14:18,125
In wonderland

1548
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:19,793
Over the hill

1549
01:14:19,877 --> 01:14:24,214
Or here or there

1550
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:30,846
I wonder where

1551
01:14:42,274 --> 01:14:44,026
Alice

1552
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:47,613
In Wonderland

1553
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:51,742
How do you get
to Wonderland?

1554
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:55,704
Over the hill
or underland

1555
01:14:55,787 --> 01:15:00,667
Or just behind the tree?

1556
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:02,419
Alice

1557
01:15:02,503 --> 01:15:05,672
In Wonderland

1558
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:10,886
Where is the path
to Wonderland?

1559
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:12,971
Over the hill

1560
01:15:13,055 --> 01:15:16,683
Or here or there?

1561
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:21,980
I wonder where
