That's all right.
Why don't we start

00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:22,270
and see how far we get.
Oh, excuse me.

Uh, tell me, have you had
any previous experience?

Doing what?

813
00:38:27,186 --> 00:38:28,813
I was thinking
of your stage career,

814
00:38:28,888 --> 00:38:29,820
but I'd be interested
in anything else

a much better idea.

I enjoyed your performance,

Did you?
Did you really?

Come in please.

it was awfully sweet
of you to come back

and tell me how much
you admired my work.

And tell your family

appreciate it,

I'll tell 'em,

I'm sorry, but there are

about it, Pop.

What about the theater?

957
00:42:52,885 --> 00:42:55,251
In a way, it's just
a change of booking.

958
00:42:55,321 --> 00:42:58,381
You must admit the church
has had a pretty long run.

I just hope
I have the talent for it.

971
00:43:23,082 --> 00:43:25,107
I can handle him. I've been
handling him his whole life.

972
00:43:25,184 --> 00:43:27,118
Is there some sort
of dispute going on?

973
00:43:27,186 --> 00:43:28,983
Can I be
of any assis--

974
00:43:29,054 --> 00:43:31,352
Can I be of any--

975
00:43:31,423 --> 00:43:33,482
Oh, Mom, I don't
feel so good.

976
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:35,754
Oh, no, you don't.
Upstairs for you.

977
00:43:35,828 --> 00:43:38,661
I just had
this carpet cleaned.

978
00:43:38,731 --> 00:43:41,393
What a family.
One of'em

979
00:43:41,467 --> 00:43:42,525
goes sneaking off
to a nightclub,

980
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:44,364
one of'em comes home
smelling like a saloon,

981
00:43:44,436 --> 00:43:47,098
and the third one--you--
I might've expected you

982
00:43:47,172 --> 00:43:49,402
to come home drunk like Tim,
but I will be a Hindu swami

983
00:43:49,475 --> 00:43:51,067
if I expected
what you gave me tonight.

984
00:43:51,143 --> 00:43:52,633
Pop, don't take it
so big.

985
00:43:52,711 --> 00:43:53,871
Steve might turn out

986
00:43:53,946 --> 00:43:55,106
to be something
really big,

987
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,115
like a bishop
or even a cardinal.

988
00:43:58,183 --> 00:44:00,811
Yeah? The only cardinal
I want in this family

989
00:44:00,886 --> 00:44:03,596
is one that plays ball
with St. Louis.

990
00:44:05,297 --> 00:44:07,458
I could take a--

991
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:08,465
Bath.

992
00:44:08,534 --> 00:44:10,729
Big man now.
Comin' home like--

993
00:44:10,803 --> 00:44:12,270
You're drowning me.

994
00:44:12,338 --> 00:44:14,033
Don't put any ideas
in my head.

995
00:44:14,106 --> 00:44:15,038
Yeah, but I--

996
00:44:15,107 --> 00:44:16,802
Down, boy. Down.

997
00:44:16,876 --> 00:44:19,777
And don't come up
till I tell ya.

998
00:44:23,215 --> 00:44:25,046
Where am I?

999
00:44:29,755 --> 00:44:30,847
Here.

1000
00:44:31,924 --> 00:44:32,913
Give me that.

1001
00:44:32,992 --> 00:44:35,392
Will you please, Ma?

1002
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:38,453
Timmy, this hurts you
more than it hurts me.

1003
00:44:38,531 --> 00:44:40,260
Now get in there.

1004
00:44:40,332 --> 00:44:42,630
I'm getting there.

1005
00:44:42,702 --> 00:44:45,330
Come on, get in.
Hurry up.

1006
00:44:45,404 --> 00:44:48,305
This way. Put your head
down here on the pillow.

1007
00:44:48,374 --> 00:44:49,306
Come on.

1008
00:44:55,281 --> 00:44:57,408
All right,
let's have it, sport.

1009
00:44:57,483 --> 00:44:59,075
Who were you out with?

1010
00:44:59,151 --> 00:45:00,516
Lillian Sawyer.

1011
00:45:00,586 --> 00:45:02,019
That tomato?

1012
00:45:02,088 --> 00:45:05,524
I think I asked her
to marry me, Mom.

1013
00:45:05,591 --> 00:45:07,923
I know I proposed
something.

1014
00:45:07,993 --> 00:45:10,461
I bet you did.
What'd you have to drink?

1015
00:45:10,529 --> 00:45:13,362
I don't remember,
but we topped it off

1016
00:45:13,432 --> 00:45:14,865
with champagne
and root beer.

1017
00:45:14,934 --> 00:45:17,300
I was trying to forget.

1018
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:18,336
Forget what?

1019
00:45:18,404 --> 00:45:20,804
That's another thing
I don't remember.

1020
00:45:20,873 --> 00:45:23,000
Another girl, I think.

1021
00:45:23,075 --> 00:45:24,906
Little man,
you've had a busy night.

1022
00:45:24,977 --> 00:45:28,606
Yeah. Hello? Hello?

1023
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:30,444
Everything's going
round and round, Ma.

1024
00:45:30,516 --> 00:45:32,211
Yes, I know. I know.

1025
00:45:32,284 --> 00:45:34,252
You go to sleep now.
We'll talk this over

1026
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,252
in the morning.

1027
00:45:35,321 --> 00:45:36,253
Oh.

1028
00:45:36,322 --> 00:45:38,290
I'm sorry, Mom.

1029
00:45:38,357 --> 00:45:40,086
I know you are, kid,

1030
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:42,719
and I'm sorry, too,
if I hurt you.

1031
00:45:42,795 --> 00:45:45,263
It's just that
we love you so much

1032
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:46,730
that we intend
to make a man out of you,

1033
00:45:46,799 --> 00:45:48,824
even if we have
to murder you first.

1034
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:50,391
Thanks, Mom.

1035
00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:52,903
Go to sleep now.

1036
00:45:52,972 --> 00:45:54,564
Good night, Ma.

1037
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,164
Good night, Tim.

1038
00:46:02,681 --> 00:46:04,080
Is he all right?

1039
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,742
Oh, he's fine now,

1040
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:07,752
but what he's gonna
feel like in the morning.

1041
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:13,156
Anyway, I hope so.
Steve, I wanna talk to you.

1042
00:46:13,225 --> 00:46:15,022
Sure, Mom.

1043
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:23,067
Are you disappointed
in me, too,

1044
00:46:23,135 --> 00:46:24,534
the way Dad is?

1045
00:46:24,603 --> 00:46:26,366
You can't blame
your father, Steve,

1046
00:46:26,438 --> 00:46:28,338
the way you
threw it at him,

1047
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:30,375
just cold,
without any buildup.

1048
00:46:30,442 --> 00:46:31,875
He wasn't lookin' for it.

1049
00:46:31,944 --> 00:46:34,139
He had different plans
for you.

1050
00:46:34,213 --> 00:46:36,181
There's still
Katy and Tim.

1051
00:46:36,248 --> 00:46:38,273
Yes, but you're
the firstborn.

1052
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,410
There's always something
about the first.

1053
00:46:41,487 --> 00:46:45,685
Life's funny.
You raise a kid backstage,

1054
00:46:45,758 --> 00:46:47,749
you teach him
every trick you know

1055
00:46:47,827 --> 00:46:51,627
about singing and dancing
and how to make people laugh,

1056
00:46:51,697 --> 00:46:54,495
and then one day, this.

1057
00:46:54,567 --> 00:46:57,695
Why? How come?

1058
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:01,206
I don't know, Ma.
It's inside me.

1059
00:47:01,273 --> 00:47:04,140
It must have
always been there.

1060
00:47:11,951 --> 00:47:13,976
It's like losin' ya, Steve.

1061
00:47:14,053 --> 00:47:16,578
Oh, I know,
not really, but--

1062
00:47:16,655 --> 00:47:18,020
Then you are
disappointed.

1063
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:21,526
No, I'm not disappointed.
It's a wonderful thing.

1064
00:47:21,594 --> 00:47:24,119
I'm just not
used to it yet,

1065
00:47:24,196 --> 00:47:27,688
but I'm proud.
Very proud.

1066
00:47:27,766 --> 00:47:29,597
Mom.

1067

# Remember the night #

1068
00:47:31,237 --> 00:47:32,736

1069
00:47:32,805 --> 00:47:35,535
#The night you said #

1070
00:47:35,608 --> 00:47:38,441
# I love you? #

1071
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,604
# Remember? #

1072
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,240
# Remember,
my love #

00:47:49,955 --> 00:47:52,651

1076
00:47:52,725 --> 00:47:58,493
# Remember, we vowed
to own this spot #

1077

#And after I learned
to care a lot #

1078
00:48:04,003 --> 00:48:06,938
#You promised that you'd #

1079
00:48:07,006 --> 00:48:11,466
# Forget me not #

1080
00:48:11,543 --> 00:48:16,571
# But you forgot #

1081
00:48:16,649 --> 00:48:24,385
#To reme-em-em-ber #

1082
00:48:24,456 --> 00:48:26,356
When do we open?

1083
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:27,357
Where?

1084
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:29,018
Have another sandwich.

1085
00:48:29,094 --> 00:48:30,288
[Drum Roll]

1086
00:48:30,362 --> 00:48:32,421
Oh, come on,
let's go inside.

1087
00:48:32,498 --> 00:48:33,465
They're starting.

1088
00:48:33,532 --> 00:48:34,999
Showtime.

1089
00:48:35,067 --> 00:48:36,534
Quiet!

1090
00:48:36,602 --> 00:48:38,229
Terry:
Showtime! Showtime!

1091
00:48:38,304 --> 00:48:41,239
You all get settled down.

1092
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:46,034
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

1093
00:48:46,111 --> 00:48:49,740
There. Now, since you were
nice enough to surprise me,

1094
00:48:49,815 --> 00:48:51,476
I have a surprise for you.

1095
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,075
We have a couple of
very talented young people

1096
00:48:54,153 --> 00:48:56,485
here with us tonight--songs,
dances, and impressions--

1097
00:48:56,555 --> 00:48:59,319
And they would like
to perform for you.

1098
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,859
Now, this act
hasn't been seen

1099
00:49:01,927 --> 00:49:03,485
in something like
20 years,

1100
00:49:03,562 --> 00:49:05,086
and if I'm any
judge of talent,

1101
00:49:05,164 --> 00:49:06,791
it'll never be seen again.

1102

Thank you.

Thank you very much,

My sister and I
both thank you.

Would you like to say
a few words, sweetheart?

1134
00:51:02,114 --> 00:51:02,978
Yes.

1135

for the piece de résistance.</i>

We're supposed
to add a new song

1138
00:51:08,587 --> 00:51:09,576
to our act
for next season,

1139
00:51:09,655 --> 00:51:11,179
but the fella who was
supposed to sing it

1140
00:51:11,256 --> 00:51:12,484
got himself a new job.

1141
00:51:12,558 --> 00:51:14,890
It's not as much money
as we were paying him,

1142
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,154
but that's
what he wants to do,

1143
00:51:16,228 --> 00:51:19,459
so we're all for him.
Would you like to hear it?

1144
00:51:24,562 --> 00:51:26,029
Ladies and gentlemen,

your guest of honor,
Mr. Steven Donahue.

Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago,

1147
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:35,568
when we were
playing down in Memphis,

1148
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,006
I heard a song
that impressed me very much,

1149
00:51:38,076 --> 00:51:39,703
and it's
the kind of a song

1150
00:51:39,777 --> 00:51:41,870
we snap our fingers
and clap our hands,

1151
00:51:41,946 --> 00:51:44,107
and I want you
to come along with me.

1152

we're gonna do together?

[Applause]

2117
01:37:10,618 --> 01:37:11,812
Hiya, Pop.

2118
01:37:14,355 --> 01:37:15,549
How's the girl?

2119
01:37:15,623 --> 01:37:17,056
She's all right,
I guess. Uh...

2120
01:37:17,124 --> 01:37:18,716
they had to take
a couple of stitches,

2121
01:37:18,793 --> 01:37:20,385
but the doctor said
none of them would show.

2122
01:37:20,461 --> 01:37:21,393
How 'bout you?

2123
01:37:21,462 --> 01:37:22,793
I'm all right.
They, uh...

2124
01:37:22,863 --> 01:37:24,296
took a couple
of X-rays,

2125
01:37:24,365 --> 01:37:25,764
just want me
to stay overnight

2126
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:26,891
for observation.

2127
01:37:26,967 --> 01:37:29,231
All right, let's have it.
What happened?

2128
01:37:29,303 --> 01:37:30,793
Didn't they
tell you downstairs?

2129
01:37:30,871 --> 01:37:33,772
Yeah, they told me downstairs.
I'd like to hear it from you.

2130
01:37:33,841 --> 01:37:36,537
OK, I was drunk.
I was loaded.

2131
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:38,578
The girl didn't like
the way I was driving,

2132
01:37:38,646 --> 01:37:41,046
so she took the wheel,
and I passed out.

2133
01:37:41,115 --> 01:37:42,912
Next thing I knew,
we were in a ditch,

2134
01:37:42,983 --> 01:37:45,383
the car rolled over
a couple of times,

2135
01:37:45,453 --> 01:37:48,115
and, uh...well, that's
about the whole story.

2136
01:37:48,189 --> 01:37:49,383
Well, if you think
that's the whole story,

2137
01:37:49,457 --> 01:37:51,550
you got even
less sense than--

2138
01:37:51,625 --> 01:37:53,354
You know, I thought
you were just a kid

2139
01:37:53,427 --> 01:37:55,088
who got out of line
a few times.

2140
01:37:55,162 --> 01:37:57,790
But you're not a kid anymore.
You know the score.

2141
01:37:57,865 --> 01:37:59,628
Have you any idea
what you pulled tonight?

2142
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:01,167
What do you mean,
it's opening night,

2143
01:38:01,235 --> 01:38:02,668
the show must go on,
that routine?

2144
01:38:02,736 --> 01:38:04,795
No, no. They'll get
the show on without you.

2145
01:38:04,872 --> 01:38:06,703
You're not that important.

2146
01:38:06,774 --> 01:38:09,004
You didn't hurt anybody
tonight but yourself.

2147
01:38:09,076 --> 01:38:11,340
All right. So I had
the chance of a lifetime,

2148
01:38:11,412 --> 01:38:13,539
and I blew it, so what?

2149
01:38:13,614 --> 01:38:15,479
What's got into you?

2150
01:38:15,549 --> 01:38:17,210
Who do you think you are?

2151
01:38:17,284 --> 01:38:18,649
I'll tell you what you are.

2152
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:20,778
You're nothing, because
you've made yourself nothing,

2153
01:38:20,855 --> 01:38:22,288
you conceited little punk.

2154
01:38:22,356 --> 01:38:24,290
I wouldn't care if I
never saw you again.

2155
01:38:24,358 --> 01:38:25,586
Oh, come on now, Pop.

2156
01:38:25,659 --> 01:38:27,889
I heard there's a big
crop of corn this year,

2157
01:38:27,962 --> 01:38:28,986
- but--
- What?

2158
01:38:29,063 --> 01:38:30,792
Corn. H-A-M. Corn.

2159
01:38:33,467 --> 01:38:34,525
[Door Slams]

2160
01:38:42,109 --> 01:38:43,542
Did you put in
a clean shirt?

2161
01:38:43,611 --> 01:38:44,703
Yeah. I got
everything he needs.

2162
01:38:44,778 --> 01:38:46,040
Now, remember, when we
get to the hospital,

2163
01:38:46,113 --> 01:38:48,013
you promised me not
to be tough with him.

2164
01:38:48,082 --> 01:38:49,549
He's just no good,
Mother.

2165
01:38:49,617 --> 01:38:50,811
You should've
heard him last night.

2166
01:38:50,885 --> 01:38:52,318
But it's not all his fault.

2167
01:38:52,386 --> 01:38:54,149
I found out a lot
of things last night.

2168
01:38:54,221 --> 01:38:56,883
That Parker girl's been
giving him a rough time.

2169
01:38:56,957 --> 01:38:59,016
I knew she was
no good for him.

2170
01:38:59,093 --> 01:39:02,028
You can blame the girl,
but everybody else blames him.

2171
01:39:06,367 --> 01:39:07,698
Are you gonna tell him

2172
01:39:07,768 --> 01:39:09,668
that they want you
to stay in the show?

2173
01:39:09,737 --> 01:39:11,705
Sure. It'll only
be a few days.

2174
01:39:11,772 --> 01:39:12,761
It's down here.

2175
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,205
Oh.

2176
01:39:14,275 --> 01:39:15,401
Can I help you?

2177
01:39:15,476 --> 01:39:17,171
I'm Mr. Donahue.
My son is in 4--

2178
01:39:17,244 --> 01:39:18,176
Oh! I--

2179
01:39:18,245 --> 01:39:19,337
Is there
something wrong?

2180
01:39:19,413 --> 01:39:20,903
Your son isn't here.

2181
01:39:20,981 --> 01:39:23,040
He seems to have picked
himself up last night

2182
01:39:23,117 --> 01:39:24,084
and walked out.

2183
01:39:24,151 --> 01:39:26,676
He left this note
for you.

2184
01:39:26,754 --> 01:39:27,812
Thank you.

2185
01:39:35,963 --> 01:39:37,021
'' Dear folks,

2186

Molly:
'' Don't worry.'' Ha.

2193
01:40:13,233 --> 01:40:14,461
That's a laugh.

2194
01:40:14,535 --> 01:40:16,469
You start worrying
about your kids

2195
01:40:16,537 --> 01:40:19,563
the day they're born,
and you never stop.

2196
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:22,609
Even after they bury you,
I bet you never stop.

2197
01:40:24,378 --> 01:40:26,312
Terry: Of course
we did everything

2198
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:28,610
we possibly could
to find him.

2199
01:40:28,682 --> 01:40:31,173
Went to the police.

2200
01:40:31,251 --> 01:40:34,618
Checked booking offices,
in case he tried to work.

2201
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:37,054
Even hired detectives
of our own.

2202
01:40:38,359 --> 01:40:39,656
Once, later on,

2203
01:40:39,727 --> 01:40:42,059
we heard he was working
under a different name

2204
01:40:42,129 --> 01:40:44,620
with a trio down
in Greenwich Village.

2205
01:40:52,454 --> 01:40:53,785
# Oh, Marie #

2206
01:40:53,856 --> 01:40:55,346
#Time for sleepin'
is done #

2207
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,686
#The dawn is breaking #

2208
01:40:56,759 --> 01:40:58,556
#Take a peek
at that sun #

2209
01:40:58,627 --> 01:41:00,060
# Sweet Marie #

2210
01:41:00,129 --> 01:41:01,426
# Better open
your eyes #

2211
01:41:01,497 --> 01:41:02,657
#You'll soon be awake #

2212
01:41:02,731 --> 01:41:04,756
# Now's the time
to arise #

2213
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:06,027
# Oh, Marie #

2214
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:07,864
Both:
# My broken heart #

2215
01:41:07,936 --> 01:41:08,868
# My heart is #

2216
01:41:08,937 --> 01:41:12,873
All:
#Aching for you #

2217
01:41:12,941 --> 01:41:14,340
# For you #

2218
01:41:14,409 --> 01:41:19,938
# My sweet
Ma-Ma-Marie #

2219
01:41:25,187 --> 01:41:27,121
Molly: Every place
you went those days,

2220
01:41:27,189 --> 01:41:29,851
you saw more
and more uniforms.

2221
01:41:29,925 --> 01:41:32,189
Half the world
was fighting already,

2222
01:41:32,261 --> 01:41:34,991
and the other half was
rehearsing to get into it.

2223
01:41:35,063 --> 01:41:38,726
Even Steve had applied
to go over as a chaplain.

2224
01:41:56,752 --> 01:41:58,652
Better wait under here,
Miss Parker.

2225
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,153
I'll only be a minute.

2226
01:42:00,222 --> 01:42:01,655
Thanks, Kelly.

2227
01:42:08,730 --> 01:42:10,698
Oh, uh...Kelly's
getting me a cab.

2228
01:42:10,766 --> 01:42:12,165
May I drop you
someplace?

2229
01:42:12,234 --> 01:42:13,326
No, thank you.

2230
01:42:13,402 --> 01:42:15,336
I just thought it would
give us a chance to--

2231
01:42:15,404 --> 01:42:17,372
Oh, that's quite all right.
There are plenty of cabs.

2232
01:42:17,439 --> 01:42:18,633
I'll find one.

2233
01:42:28,383 --> 01:42:29,475
All ready?

2234
01:42:29,551 --> 01:42:31,849
I changed my mind,
Molly. I'm not going.

2235
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,182
Aw, come on, Terry.

2236
01:42:33,255 --> 01:42:34,847
You can drop me off
at the theater

2237
01:42:34,923 --> 01:42:36,550
and then go over
The Lamb's Club

2238
01:42:36,625 --> 01:42:37,819
and have a few laughs.

2239
01:42:37,893 --> 01:42:39,884
And then I'll pick you up
after the show.

2240
01:42:39,962 --> 01:42:41,953
We can take in
a midnight movie, hmm?

2241
01:42:42,030 --> 01:42:44,362
Thanks, Molly.
I'm just not up to it.

2242
01:42:44,433 --> 01:42:45,422
OK.

2243
01:42:46,902 --> 01:42:48,301
See you later.

2244
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:52,832
Oh, uh, Terry,

2245
01:42:52,908 --> 01:42:54,307
I came across
some old arrangements,

2249
01:42:58,580 --> 01:43:00,275
Well, the actor's fund's
having a benefit

2250
01:43:00,349 --> 01:43:02,078
on the 19th.
I told you about it.

2251
01:43:02,150 --> 01:43:03,242
They're tearing down
the Hippodrome,

2252
01:43:03,318 --> 01:43:04,717
and they're trying
to get together

some of the old acts
that played there.

I'm a pretty old act.

Maybe they better
tear me down, too.

to be in the show.

go out on a stage.

Oh, Terry will you stop
talking this way?

2261
01:43:15,964 --> 01:43:17,124
It's not gonna help anything.

2262
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:18,894
What are you gonna do,
spend the rest of your life

2263
01:43:18,967 --> 01:43:20,867
moping around like this,
blaming yourself?

Look, I miss him, too.
Every day. Every minute.

But at least I keep goin'.

Oh, Molly.

Come on, you're going
into town with me.

2270
01:43:30,846 --> 01:43:32,313
Why? So we can
walk down Broadway,

2271
01:43:32,381 --> 01:43:33,848
and you can look
into the face

of every young kid
that goes by?

will you stop
nagging me?

2276
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,153
I said I'm not going,
and I'm not.

2277
01:43:40,222 --> 01:43:41,621
And that benefit
on the 19th,

2278

just figure
to play it yourself

2279
01:43:43,158 --> 01:43:44,250
because I won't be here.

2280

Why? Where you going?

2281
01:43:45,394 --> 01:43:46,486
I'm gonna go find him.

2282
01:43:46,561 --> 01:43:48,028
Where? How do you know
where to look?

2283
01:43:48,096 --> 01:43:49,529
I don't. But I can't

We can talk about it
when I get home.

2289
01:43:57,639 --> 01:43:59,834
I'll be early. I'll skip
the curtain call, OK?

01:43:59,908 --> 01:44:00,897

Mom, I didn't know
myself.

The whole regiment

2405
01:48:52,015 --> 01:48:53,880
was just handed
a 24-hour pass.

2406
01:48:53,950 --> 01:48:55,349
Now, I knew
by the papers

2407
01:48:55,418 --> 01:48:56,851
that you're doing
a show here, so--

2408
01:48:56,920 --> 01:48:58,353
A 24-hour pass?
Does that mean that--

2409
01:48:58,421 --> 01:48:59,854
It means a 24-hour pass.

Don't you double-talk me,
Steve Donahue.

2411
01:49:01,658 --> 01:49:03,421
Mom, I'm not supposed
to say any more.

any more.

there was some way

2423

we could help him.

2424
01:49:26,549 --> 01:49:29,040
Yeah. Did, uh,
Katy also write you

2425
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:31,087
that you're
gonna be an uncle?

2426

Yeah. Isn't that great?

01:49:33,556 --> 01:49:35,854
She booked me
for the christening.

I still believe
he'll be back, Mom.

I'm not so sure.

never see him again.

2562
01:55:49,595 --> 01:55:52,758
#And there's your billing
right up there in lights #

2563
01:55:52,832 --> 01:55:56,324
#There's no people
like show people #

2564
01:55:56,402 --> 01:55:59,860
#They smile
when they are low #

2565
01:55:59,939 --> 01:56:02,874
# Even with a turkey
that you know will fold #

2566
01:56:02,942 --> 01:56:06,469
#You may be stranded
out in the cold #

2567
01:56:06,545 --> 01:56:07,944
# Still you wouldn't
change it #

2568
01:56:08,013 --> 01:56:09,571
# For a sack of gold #

2569
01:56:09,648 --> 01:56:13,015
#You go on with the show #

2570
01:56:13,085 --> 01:56:16,179
#There's no business
like show business #

2571
01:56:16,255 --> 01:56:19,713
# Like no business I know #

2572
01:56:19,792 --> 01:56:23,125
# Everything about it
is appealing #

2573
01:56:23,195 --> 01:56:26,289
# Everything the traffic
will allow #

2574
01:56:26,365 --> 01:56:29,061
# Nowhere can you get
that happy feeling #

2575
01:56:29,135 --> 01:56:32,502
#When you are stealing
that extra bow #

2576
01:56:32,571 --> 01:56:35,938
#There's no people
like show people #

2577
01:56:36,008 --> 01:56:39,671
#They smile
when they are low #

2578
01:56:39,745 --> 01:56:42,805
#Yesterday they told you
you would not go far #

2579
01:56:42,882 --> 01:56:46,113
#That night you open,
and there you are #

2580
01:56:46,185 --> 01:56:47,880
# Next day,
on your dressing room #

2581
01:56:47,953 --> 01:56:49,318
#They've hung a star #

2582
01:56:49,388 --> 01:56:53,347
# Let's go
on with the show #

2583
01:56:53,425 --> 01:56:55,757
