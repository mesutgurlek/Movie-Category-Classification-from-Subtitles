Until you were born,

unless we told them what to want.

David, do you have any idea
what a success story you've become?

You found a fairy tale, and inspired
by love, fueled by desire...

01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:09,956
...you set out on a journey
to make her real.

1112
01:42:10,165 --> 01:42:14,502
Most remarkable of all, no one taught
you how. We actually lost you for a while.

1113
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:17,672
But when you were found again,
we didn't make our presence known.

1114
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,048
Our test was a simple one.

1115
01:42:19,216 --> 01:42:22,426
Where would your self-motivated
reasoning take you?

1116
01:42:22,636 --> 01:42:25,054
To the logical conclusion
the Blue Fairy...

1117
01:42:25,222 --> 01:42:28,599
...is part of the great human flaw
to wish for things that don't exist...

1118
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:31,769
...or to the greatest single human gift...

David, I often felt a sort
of envy of humans...

1232
02:08:20,484 --> 02:08:23,444
...of that thing they called spirit.

1233
02:08:23,612 --> 02:08:27,865
Human beings had created a million
explanations of the meaning of life...

1234
02:08:28,117 --> 02:08:30,660
...in art, poetry, mathematical formulas.

1235
02:08:30,869 --> 02:08:35,123
Certainly human beings must be the key
to the meaning of existence.

But human beings no longer existed.

So we began a project...

And you know what we found?

02:08:59,815 --> 02:09:03,735
We found the very fabric

...they died again.

1258
02:09:57,873 --> 02:09:59,373
Maybe....

1259
02:10:02,878 --> 02:10:05,713
Maybe she will be special.

1260
02:10:06,882 --> 02:10:09,467
Maybe she will stay.

1261
02:10:09,802 --> 02:10:12,929
I thought this would be hard
for you to understand.

1262
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:16,265
You were created to be so young.

1263
02:10:17,476 --> 02:10:22,939
Maybe the one day will be like
that one day inside the amphibicopter.

1264
02:10:23,232 --> 02:10:26,067
Maybe it will last forever.

1265
02:10:26,485 --> 02:10:29,904
SPECIALIST:
David, you are the enduring memory...

1266
02:10:30,072 --> 02:10:32,198
...of the human race.

1267
02:10:33,826 --> 02:10:37,203
The most lasting proof of their genius.

We only want for your happiness.

1269

David...

1270
02:10:44,086 --> 02:10:46,629
...you've had so little of that.

1271
02:10:47,506 --> 02:10:50,633
If you want for my happiness...

1272
02:10:51,802 --> 02:10:54,971
...then you know what you have to do.

1273

Can you hear that?

1276
02:11:10,237 --> 02:11:13,114
The new morning has come.

1277
02:11:20,956 --> 02:11:23,332
Go to her, David.

1278
02:11:26,044 --> 02:11:29,130
She's just waking up this instant.

1279
02:13:07,938 --> 02:13:10,022
I found you.

1280
02:13:14,861 --> 02:13:19,490
-Hi.
-Hi.

1281
02:13:20,784 --> 02:13:23,494
I must have dozed off.

1282
02:13:25,789 --> 02:13:28,874
-How long--?
-Would you like some coffee?

1283
02:13:29,167 --> 02:13:31,377
Just the way you like it?

1284
02:13:32,421 --> 02:13:35,131
Yeah, I'd love a coffee.

1285
02:13:36,591 --> 02:13:38,759
It'll wake me up.

1286
02:13:42,514 --> 02:13:45,057
Okay.

1287
02:14:03,535 --> 02:14:06,454
You never forget how, do you?

1288
02:14:07,956 --> 02:14:09,165
No.

1289
02:14:11,293 --> 02:14:13,127
I never forget.

1290
02:14:18,633 --> 02:14:21,177
I must be a little confused.

1291
02:14:22,304 --> 02:14:24,055
What day is it?

1292
02:14:26,850 --> 02:14:29,977
It is today.

1293
02:14:31,730 --> 02:14:36,692
SPECIALIST: As the day wore on, David
thought it was the happiest day of his life.

1294
02:14:36,902 --> 02:14:42,031
All the problems seemed to have
disappeared from his mommy's mind.

1295
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:46,118
There was no Henry, there was no Martin.

1296
02:14:46,328 --> 02:14:50,081
There was no grief.
There was only David.

[BOTH LAUGH]

1298
02:15:00,967 --> 02:15:03,719
SPECIALIST: David had been warned
not to explain anything to Monica...

1299
02:15:03,887 --> 02:15:07,431
...otherwise she'd be frightened,
and everything would be spoiled.

1300
02:15:07,682 --> 02:15:10,434
But David's journey home
belonged only to him.

1301
02:15:10,644 --> 02:15:15,689
So he didn't see the harm of painting her
pictures of things she'd have no memory of.

[DAVID & MONICA YELL THEN LAUGH]

1303
02:15:43,135 --> 02:15:45,136
SPECIALIST:
David had never had a birthday party...

1304
02:15:45,303 --> 02:15:46,971
...because David had never been born.

1305
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:50,224
So they baked a cake
and lit some candles.

1306
02:15:50,475 --> 02:15:54,603
-Now make a wish.
-It came true already.

1307
02:16:00,485 --> 02:16:03,237
SPECIALIST: By now, indeed,
the windows were beginning to dim.

1308
02:16:03,446 --> 02:16:08,576
David drew the shades without
even needing to be asked.

1309
02:16:17,002 --> 02:16:20,254
I really ought to be tucking you in.

1310
02:16:20,964 --> 02:16:22,965
How strange.

1311
02:16:25,594 --> 02:16:26,635
Hmm.

1312
02:16:27,262 --> 02:16:29,388
How fascinating.

1313
02:16:34,019 --> 02:16:37,396
I can hardly keep my eyes open.

I don't know what's come over me.

1315

Such a beautiful day.

1316
02:16:51,828 --> 02:16:53,954
I love you, David.

1317
02:17:00,128 --> 02:17:02,379
I do love you.

1318
02:17:03,965 --> 02:17:07,676
I have always loved you.

1319
02:17:11,139 --> 02:17:15,309
SPECIALIST: That was the everlasting
moment he had been waiting for.

1320
02:17:17,062 --> 02:17:22,358
And the moment had passed,
for Monica was sound asleep.

1321
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:26,362
More than merely asleep.

1322
02:17:27,197 --> 02:17:30,574
Should he shake her,
she would never rouse.

1323
02:17:34,412 --> 02:17:37,331
So David went to sleep too.

1324
02:17:38,291 --> 02:17:42,878
And for the first time in his life...

1325
02:17:43,546 --> 02:17:46,298
...he went to that place...

1326

...where dreams are born.
