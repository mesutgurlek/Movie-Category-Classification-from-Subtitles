Why'd you save my ass?

00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:36,810
ZEUS: I didn't.

468
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:39,821
I stopped a white cop
from getting kiIIed in HarIem.

469
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:41,584
One white cop
gets kiIIed today...

470
00:31:41,623 --> 00:31:43,591
tomorrow we got
1,000 white cops...

triggerfingers, got it?

472
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,022
Get him back.

00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:53,191
Where'd youfind that bomb?

00:31:53,235 --> 00:31:54,725
Chinatown.

475
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,829
Shit.

476
00:31:56,872 --> 00:31:59,773
JOHN:

You know where that park is at

482
00:32:14,556 --> 00:32:15,955
Yeah. That's in HarIem.

Where do you think

00:32:18,494 --> 00:32:22,624
Listen,this guy doesn't care

00:32:22,664 --> 00:32:24,097
even if you do.

00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:27,530
ZEUS: What am I doing?

487
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:29,537
JOHN: Cheer up.
Things couId be worse.

488
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:31,869
I was working

We need this phone

Honey, I'm a cop.

497
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,968

Don't do that shit again.

503
00:33:10,846 --> 00:33:12,313
ZEUS: Let's get something eIse
straight--

504
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:14,975
you need me
more than I need you.

505
00:33:15,017 --> 00:33:18,475

So do pigs and swine.

Rats and mice

00:33:56,558 --> 00:33:57,855
JOHN: It's a pubIic phone.
What shouId I say?

to get her off.

00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,473
Now, do I have your attention?

530
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,484
As I was going to St. Ives,
I met a man with seven wives.

531
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,986
Every wife had seven sacks.
Every sack had seven cats.

00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,487
Every cat had seven kittens.

533
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,319
Kittens, cats, sacks, and wives.

534
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,984
How many were going to St. Ives?

00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:31,322
My phone number is 555--

536

JOHN: I didn't getthat!
Say it again!

537
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,655
SIMON: Not a chance.

538
00:34:34,696 --> 00:34:37,722
My phone number is 555

Seven times seven is 49.

JOHN:
A bad hangover,for one!

549
00:34:58,053 --> 00:35:00,681
AII right.
Seven wives times seven--49...

550
00:35:00,722 --> 00:35:03,850
with seven cats--
Seven times 49 is 343, right?

551
00:35:03,892 --> 00:35:05,826
-Asking me orteIIing me?
-I'm teIIing you.

552
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:09,024
Three-forty-three
times seven is...

00:35:09,064 --> 00:35:10,497
Two thousand,
four hundred and one.

-That's whatyou got right?
-Yeah.

555
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,698
JOHN: Is that it? 2401?

00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:17,227
ZEUS:
That's it. DiaI 555-2401.

00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,701
No,wait,wait! It's a trick.

Fuckthe man!
We got 10 seconds!

ZEUS: He said how many
were going to St. Ives.

561
00:35:26,882 --> 00:35:30,318
The riddIe begins,
''As I was going to St. Ives.''

562
00:35:30,352 --> 00:35:32,411
The wives aren't going anywhere.

00:35:32,454 --> 00:35:33,751

564

785
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,685
JOHN:
Yeah,that's the probIem,Joe.

786
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,244
-What?
-The miracIe part.

787
00:49:35,288 --> 00:49:38,018
What are the odds of us
making it here on time?

788
00:49:39,058 --> 00:49:40,184
ZEUS: Zip.

789
00:49:40,226 --> 00:49:43,889
That bombwas going off
no matterwhat.

790
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,192
Take this off me.

791
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,227
LAMBERT: What's so speciaI
aboutthis pIace?

792
00:49:48,268 --> 00:49:50,736
I don't know.
Something just doesn't add up.

793
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,328
WOMAN: Lieutenant McCIane?

794
00:49:52,372 --> 00:49:54,602
They're askingforyou

WALTER: John.

797
00:50:00,246 --> 00:50:04,706
John,this is Andy Cross

BiII Jarvis. He's, uh--

799
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,449
JARVIS:
I'm, uh,with another agency.

800
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:11,457
It's good to meetyou.

801
00:50:11,491 --> 00:50:13,220
WALTER:
This is Lieutenant McCIane.

802
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:14,954
This is Mr. Carver.

803
00:50:14,994 --> 00:50:18,259
CROSS: We got a coupIe
of questions. First...

804
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:19,663
do you recognize this guy?

805
00:50:24,671 --> 00:50:25,797
No.

806
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:28,238
CROSS: How aboutthis one?

807
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,071
Mm-mmm.

808
00:50:33,112 --> 00:50:34,807
CROSS: How aboutyou?

809
00:50:36,115 --> 00:50:38,345
Did you recognize the voice
on the phone?

810
00:50:38,384 --> 00:50:40,249
No.

811
00:50:40,286 --> 00:50:45,588
CROSS: Did you, uh...
notice any carsfoIIowing you?

812
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,154
No.

813
00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:50,162
JARVIS:
AnybodyfoIIowing you at aII?

814
00:50:50,196 --> 00:50:54,189
Any surveiIIance--teIephone,
house, anything unusuaI?

815
00:50:54,234 --> 00:50:55,360
[Sighs]

816
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:58,029
WeII, now thatyou mention it...

817
00:50:58,071 --> 00:51:03,202
I have experienced a burning
sensation between my toes.

818
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:07,111
I thought itwas
athIete'sfoot or something.

819
00:51:08,748 --> 00:51:10,716
We read yourjacket, Lieutenant.

820
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:13,719
We were toId
you wouId be cooperative.

821
00:51:13,753 --> 00:51:15,220
Cooperate with what?

822
00:51:15,255 --> 00:51:16,722
We're wasting time here.

823
00:51:16,756 --> 00:51:18,280
WALTER:
You wantto share information...

824
00:51:18,324 --> 00:51:20,849
how about sending
a IittIe ourway?

825
00:51:20,893 --> 00:51:23,293
CROSS: We wantto hear
what he knowsfirst.

826
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:25,490
We wantto hear
what he knowsfirst.

827
00:51:25,531 --> 00:51:28,500
JOHN:
I know as much as you know.

828
00:51:28,534 --> 00:51:31,503
There's a guy outthere
setting off bombs.

829
00:51:31,537 --> 00:51:33,004
He caIIs himself Simon.

830
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:35,507
He speaks
with a German accent.

831
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:38,237
Andfor some reason,
he's very angry with me.

832
00:51:38,278 --> 00:51:41,611
And maybe you can
teII me why, huh?

833
00:51:46,219 --> 00:51:48,041
Thefirst man there
is Mathias Targo.

834
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:48,939
Thefirst man there
is Mathias Targo.

837
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,806
WALTER: Working?

JARVIS: FreeIance terrorism,
by contract.

839
00:51:57,818 --> 00:51:59,649
JOHN: Who's the girI?

840
00:51:59,686 --> 00:52:01,153
CROSS: Targo's other half.

841
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:04,646
Rumor is the IsraeIis sIipped
a bomb in between their sheets.

842
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:07,785
He wasn't at home,
butthey thinkthey got her.

843
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:10,296
JARVIS: The second man

00:52:18,538 --> 00:52:19,835
JOHN: I saw the movie.

849
00:52:19,873 --> 00:52:23,741
JARVIS: AII we know of him
is the GDR medicaI records...

850
00:52:23,777 --> 00:52:26,109
show he suffersfrom migraines.

851
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:29,274
His name is Peter...Krieg.

852
00:52:31,585 --> 00:52:33,883
JOHN:
That's an exceptionaI report.

853
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,889
What does this
have to do with me?

854
00:52:36,923 --> 00:52:40,381
MAN: The name Gruber mean
anything to you, Lieutenant?

855
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:46,594
It rings a beII,yeah.

857

He's Hans Gruber's brother.

JARVIS:
Don't Iet him know we're here.

Ha ha ha ha.

878
00:53:47,627 --> 00:53:53,224
This, gentIemen, as they say
is where the pIotthickens.

879
00:53:53,266 --> 00:53:55,734
I have put 2,400 pounds

Twenty minutes.

By the way, gentIemen...

900
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,087

on radio detonators.

Chief AIIen,
the man who's done this...

933
00:56:02,462 --> 00:56:06,364
has toId us he's pIanted
a very Iarge bomb...

934
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:08,367
in a New York schooI.

935
00:56:08,401 --> 00:56:10,369
He's toId us
we cannot evacuate...

936
00:56:10,403 --> 00:56:13,338
but he has not said
we cannot search.

937
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:16,001
I recommend we get everybody,
