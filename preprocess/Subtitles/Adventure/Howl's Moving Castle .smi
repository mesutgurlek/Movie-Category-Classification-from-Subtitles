   <SYNC START=333817>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=334123>
      <P>Behave naturally. I'm being chased by someone.
   <SYNC START=335948>

   <SYNC START=381795>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=387383>
      <P>There you go. Don't be afraid
   <SYNC START=389564>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=405518>
      <P>Very well.
   <SYNC START=406846>

   <SYNC START=421639>
      <P>I'll be a decoy. You better wait for a while before you go.OK
   <SYNC START=426854>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=427717>
      <P>Good girl.
   <SYNC START=429314>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=441306>
      <P>Here, you are. Thank you, sir.I wish I could buy a chocolate as sweet as you, Bettie.
   <SYNC START=446804>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=446977>
      <P>My sister? 
   <SYNC START=448246>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=449351>
      <P>We expect you to come back soon, Bettie.
   <SYNC START=451292>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=455104>
      <P>Sissy!
   <SYNC START=456555>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=456869>
      <P>Are you OK? I heard you sprinkled over the terrace. You became an angel or something?
   <SYNC START=460868>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=461910>
      <P>Uh,I...,it's like I'm dreaming.
   <SYNC START=464079>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=464405>
      <P>Bettie, why don't you guys talk in the office?
   <SYNC START=466131>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=466658>
      <P>Thank you. But I'm still working.
   <SYNC START=469527>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=472473>
      <P>Seriously? Isn't he a wizard or something, is he?
   <SYNC START=474771>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=475375>
      <P>He was very gentle.
   <SYNC START=477166>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=477206>
      <P>And he saved me.
   <SYNC START=479510>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=480061>
      <P>So you had your heart stolen, haven't you?
   <SYNC START=482441>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=483496>
      <P>If that wizar had been Howl, your heart would have been eaten.
   <SYNC START=487182>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=488054>
      <P>It wasn't him. I heard his targets are beautiful girls.
   <SYNC START=491271>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=491853>
      <P>You must be more careful.Listen. It's getting dangerous out there. Some say recently even "Witch in the Waste Land" is out there.
   <SYNC START=498723>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=500496>
      <P>Sissy!.
   <SYNC START=502112>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=508337>
      <P>Bettie, Madeline is ready.
   <SYNC START=510179>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=510784>
      <P>OK, wait a sec. oke
   <SYNC START=513332>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=515520>
      <P>I'm off. Now I feel better and relaxed after seeing your bright face
   <SYNC START=520099>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=521463>
      <P>Hi, Bettie. How are you? I'm fine.
   <SYNC START=523210>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=523956>
      <P>Sophie, are you serious you're gonna continue to work in the shop for the rest of your life?
   <SYNC START=527955>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=528929>
      <P>I saw dad loved the shop. And I'm his first daughter. So...
   <SYNC START=532671>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=532680>
      <P>I'm asking if you really want to take over the shop because you like to make hats.
   <SYNC START=535902>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=537344>
      <P>Uh, I...See you, Bettie.You come by the shop sometime. OK? Oke
   <SYNC START=540790>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=542127>
      <P>I'm off.You must decide what YOU really wanna be!
   <SYNC START=547213>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=614623>
      <P>Uh, Madam, the shop is closed. I'm sorry. I thought I'd locked the door already.
   <SYNC START=619066>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=621723>
      <P>How miserable this shop looks like. You sell such cheap hats, don't you?This shop suits a girl like you
   <SYNC START=630731>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=631856>
      <P>There's nothing special in this ordinary downtown hat shop
   <SYNC START=634855>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=640598>
      <P>Would you please come tomorrow, Madam?
   <SYNC START=642427>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=643822>
      <P>You have guts. I wonder if you know me, "Witch in the Waste Land"..
   <SYNC START=647275>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=647552>
      <P>"Witch in the Waste Land"?
   <SYNC START=648515>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=656664>
      <P>This curse can't be dispelled by a human. Say hello to Howl.
   <SYNC START=661736>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=708555>
      <P>Is it...,me...?Oh, my God...
   <SYNC START=711868>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=729798>
      <P>Calm down..
   <SYNC START=731881>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=731805>
      <P>There's nothing to be worried.Ok, Sophie. Relax.
   <SYNC START=740260>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=755581>
      <P>I'm home!Welcome back, ma'am.
   <SYNC START=758890>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=759077>
      <P>What do you think about my dress? This fashion is very popular in Kingsberry.Fantastic!
   <SYNC START=763076>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=763338>
      <P>It suits you very well, ma'am.This is gonna be definitely accepted in this town as well. Don't you think?
   <SYNC START=765913>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=766430>
      <P>Sophie! Sophie! 
   <SYNC START=768856>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=769623>
      <P>Ma'am, Lady Sophie hasn't come yet today.
   <SYNC START=772010>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=772338>
      <P>That's weird.
   <SYNC START=774220>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=772338>
      <P>Really !?
   <SYNC START=774220>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=784974>
      <P>Don't. You don't wanna open the door. I caught a bad cold.You don't wanna be infected, do you?
   <SYNC START=791080>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=791817>
      <P>You've got horrible voice, haven't you? It's like 90-year-old grandma is speaking.
   <SYNC START=795562>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=795762>
      <P>So, I decided to stay in my room today
   <SYNC START=798110>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=798651>
      <P>Ok. If you say so... I'll see you later
   <SYNC START=801415>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=816619>
      <P>What the hell...You'll be OK, Sophie. Your cloths suit you better than before, by the way.
   <SYNC START=822006>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=825458>
      <P>I can't stay here any longer.
   <SYNC START=826830>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=839979>
      <P>Ouch!I don't want backache yet at my age.
   <SYNC START=842827>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=866882>
      <P>Grandma, let me help.
   <SYNC START=868468>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=869345>
      <P>I can handle it. Thank you for your kindness. 
   <SYNC START=872941>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=873726>
      <P>I don't mind to give you a ride, grandma. But, where are you goingI'm going a bit further from your destination.
   <SYNC START=879087>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=883838>
      <P>Granny, I think you're going to the wrong place, where only witches are wondering around.I appreciate your advice
   <SYNC START=890343>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=891205>
      <P>Is she going to Naquie Valley at this time?She told me that she is meeting with her youngest sister.
   <SYNC START=897204>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=910308>
      <P>It seems I still have long way to go.
   <SYNC START=912307>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=915030>
      <P>Thank goodness. Fortunately, my teeth are as well as before.
   <SYNC START=918301>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=925459>
      <P>That is best suitable as a cane, isn't it?
   <SYNC START=928277>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=935641>
      <P>Well, then... Ouch! I hope it's not too chunky.
   <SYNC START=939487>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=948996>
      <P>Ouch. My waist kills me...How stiff is it!
   <SYNC START=951915>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=953043>
      <P>I will never give up! Come on!
   <SYNC START=955185>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=967922>
      <P>A Scarecrow...,isn't it? I thought you were one of her goons
   <SYNC START=972558>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=972458>
      <P>Wait a sec... Why can you stand by your self?
   <SYNC START=975217>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=977988>
      <P>Your head is made of turnip, isn't it?
   <SYNC START=979901>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=980542>
      <P>I hate turnip ever since I was a small kid.
   <SYNC START=983739>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=983963>
      <P>You look better to stand up straight, don't you? Work hard.
   <SYNC START=987962>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=995490>
      <P>It's cold. I haven't reached so far yet, have I? Besides, the town looks still close.
   <SYNC START=999354>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1005074>
      <P>Don't follow me! I don't expect you to repay my favor.
   <SYNC START=1010195>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1010297>
      <P>I'm fed up with witch and curse stuff!
   <SYNC START=1014423>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1010297>
      <P>You are controlled by magic or something, aren't you?
   <SYNC START=1014423>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1015794>
      <P>Stay there. Don't follow me!
   <SYNC START=1018116>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1039421>
      <P>For me? This is perfect! Thank you, sweet scarecrow.
   <SYNC START=1042160>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1042963>
      <P>You can't bring a small house to stay tonight, can you?
   <SYNC START=1047001>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1058339>
      <P>I enjoy pearls of wisdom thanks to aging.
   <SYNC START=1060661>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1071893>
      <P>What a huge battle ship
   <SYNC START=1074119>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1076374>
      <P>I wonder where this smell is coming from...
   <SYNC START=1079817>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1096660>
      <P>It would be wonderful if there was a lodge or something.
   <SYNC START=1100548>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1120459>
      <P>Hello, again, turnip head. But isn't that Howl's castle?
   <SYNC START=1123139>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1123596>
      <P>Yes, I asked you to bring a house, but this is...
   <SYNC START=1127718>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1138103>
      <P>What the hell is this? Is it... a castle?
   <SYNC START=1141278>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1161228>
      <P>Is that the entrance?
   <SYNC START=1163217>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1165273>
      <P>Why don't you slow down a bit!

      <P>My scarf...!
   <SYNC START=1180656>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1194317>
      <P>It seems warm inside the castle anyway, I'll say thank you, turnip head. 
   <SYNC START=1197815>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1199210>
      <P>I hope Howl doesn't eat such an old woman's heart.
   <SYNC START=1203154>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1205892>
      <P>Good bye, turnip head. You are a good turnip.

   <SYNC START=1212349>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1259408>
      <P>What's going on? It's like I'm in an old house.
   <SYNC START=1263530>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1273108>
      <P>Good thing about getting old is not to be surprised often.
   <SYNC START=1276789>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1286293>
      <P>Sophisticated curse you've got, haven't you?
   <SYNC START=1288858>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1289596>
      <P>It's gonna be really hard to dispel it.
   <SYNC START=1292141>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1294116>
      <P>Fire,...is talking.
   <SYNC START=1295384>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1295850>
      <P>And you can't tell it to other people.
   <SYNC START=1297722>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1298568>
      <P>You are...,Howl?
   <SYNC START=1300063>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1300175>
      <P>No. I'm an evil spirit, Calucifer
   <SYNC START=1303666>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1305148>
      <P>Then, Calucifer. Can you dispel the curse on me?
   <SYNC START=1308892>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1310163>
      <P>Yeah. That's pretty easy. I'll dispel the curse on you right away, if you let me be free.
   <SYNC START=1315891>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1316776>
      <P>That means I make a deal with an evil, doesn't it? Are you sure that you can keep such a promise like this?
   <SYNC START=1321794>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1322867>
      <P>You see, I'm an evil. I never keep promises.
   <SYNC START=1324784>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1326598>
      <P>Find someone else, then.
   <SYNC START=1328266>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1328382>
      <P>Are you gonna abandon such a pity evil like me with no mercy? I've been bound by Howl's magic.
   <SYNC START=1333574>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1334405>
      <P> So I have no freedom.Look at this castle, I am the one who is running this castle. See?
   <SYNC START=1336641>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1337831>
      <P>Is that so..., what a pity evil.
   <SYNC START=1341024>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1341683>
      <P>If you found out and spelled out the secret behind Howl and me, my curse would be dispelled.If you will do it for me, I'll dispel your curse, too.
   <SYNC START=1348343>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1349158>
      <P>Ok, then..Deal is made.
   <SYNC START=1353624>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1358166>
      <P>Hey, are you listening, granny?
   <SYNC START=1362113>
      <P>&nbsp;

   <SYNC START=1544676>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1544382>
      <P>You should stop that disguise like that
   <SYNC START=1546292>
      <P>&nbsp;

   <SYNC START=1641195>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1643042>
      <P>This is a magic house, isn't it?
   <SYNC START=1644518>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1645821>
      <P>Are you listening? Where does this black mark lead to? Master Howl only knows.
   <SYNC START=1650314>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1650314>
      <P>I'll have my breakfast.

   <SYNC START=1665117>
      <P>Master Howl only can control that evil fire.
   <SYNC START=1667623>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1671673>
      <P>I can handle it.
   <SYNC START=1673095>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1674060>
      <P>Impossible. Calucifer only listens to Master Howl's order.
   <SYNC START=1677878>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1678611>
      <P>He's right. I hate cooking.
   <SYNC START=1680545>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1681694>
      <P>Oh, my... My hat is here.
   <SYNC START=1683299>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1687401>
      <P>Now Calucifer. I'm counting on you.
   <SYNC START=1690309>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1690789>
      <P>No way! I'm an evil. I won't help anyone.
   <SYNC START=1695534>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1696161>
      <P>Are you sure? I can spill water over you, or I can have a little talk with Howl about our deal.
   <SYNC START=1702134>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1703499>
      <P>All right! I'll do it! I shouldn't have let such an evil granny like you in the castle...
   <SYNC START=1706820>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1707389>
      <P>What's your answer, little evil?
   <SYNC START=1708475>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1712789>
      <P>That's it. You understand very well.
   <SYNC START=1715166>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1718728>
      <P>I'll give you burnt bacon!
   <SYNC START=1720784>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1721364>
      <P>She controls Calucifer...
   <SYNC START=1723486>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1723470>
      <P>Next, I want a cup of tea. Do you have a teapot? Yes. 
   <SYNC START=1726478>

   <SYNC START=1742823>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1753921>
      <P>Calucifer, you are a good boy today, aren't you? What happened to you?
   <SYNC START=1756791>
      <P>&nbsp;

      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1775844>

   <SYNC START=1778962>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1809492>
      <P>Who decided you to be the cleaning lady?
   <SYNC START=1811507>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1812589>
      <P>I decided by myself.I've never seen such a dirty house in my life.
   <SYNC START=1816237>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1819733>
      <P>Marker give me a dish!

   <SYNC START=1874982>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1881253>
      <P>I seem to have lots of things to teach.
   <SYNC START=1883813>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1885254>
      <P>By the way, what's inside your pocket?
   <SYNC START=1887595>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1899466>
      <P>What's this? I don't remember...Let me have a look.
   <SYNC START=1902443>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1908125>
      <P>It's a magic spell! Isn't this..., Master Howl?
   <SYNC START=1910976>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1911514>
      <P>This is really an old magic and it's powerful, too.
   <SYNC START=1914855>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1915543>
      <P>Isn't it the "Witch in Waste Land", is it, master?
   <SYNC START=1917580>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1917784>
      <P>"He, the one who grasped a shooting star...,such a mindless man, your heart is mine."
   <SYNC START=1923854>
      <P>&nbsp;

      <P>It messed up the table.
   <SYNC START=1925610>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1939171>
      <P>Unbelievable! It's gone! You can't see it anymore, but the curse is still there, I'm afraid.
   <SYNC START=1943360>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1944115>
      <P>Everyone, you may continue breakfast.
   <SYNC START=1946418>

      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1956381>
      <P>It's delicious! Send me a hot water to the bathroom
   <SYNC START=1958487>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1958699>
      <P>At the same time? You're killing me!

   <SYNC START=2118283>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2118723>
      <P>If I were you, I would hide something important immediately

      <P>Great, Calucifer! Your magic is really wonderful! You do a great job!
   <SYNC START=2185549>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2189669>
      <P>Really...? Really!?
   <SYNC START=2192839>

      <P>Oops! Not yet! Come on!
   <SYNC START=2201217>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2233771>
      <P>What a beautiful lake..That is called "Star Ocean".
   <SYNC START=2236551>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2242610>
      <P>Something's stuck in that hole.
   <SYNC START=2244366>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2245592>
      <P>Oh, my... Marker, give me a hand.Come on. Almost there...
   <SYNC START=2247591>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2255419>
      <P>A scarecrow!
   <SYNC START=2256341>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2257124>
      <P>His name is "turnip head".
   <SYNC START=2258823>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2258957>
      <P>Hey, you.You really like to be upsidedown, don't you?
   <SYNC START=2261801>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2270672>
      <P>I met many strange things, didn't I? He followed me.
   <SYNC START=2274659>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2275437>
      <P>Aren't you really a witch?
   <SYNC START=2277535>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2277731>
      <P>Yes, indeed. I'm the tidiest witch in this country.
   <SYNC START=2281045>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2310745>
      <P>You큥e pulling too much, turnip head!
   <SYNC START=2312810>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2322202>
      <P>He seems to like laundries, doesn't he?
   <SYNC START=2324190>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2324799>
      <P>Thanks to him, they will dry faster.
   <SYNC START=2326587>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2329532>
      <P>Maybe, turnip head is an evil too, because Calucifer doesn't complain about anything.
   <SYNC START=2333436>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2334445>
      <P>You may be right. He might be the Death.Whatever he is, I'm very happy
   <SYNC START=2336693>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2337907>
      <P>Because I couldn't have come to such a wonderful place like this without him.
   <SYNC START=2341409>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2383437>
      <P>Sophie, I put all the laundries into the castle.
   <SYNC START=2385848>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2386792>
      <P>Ah, thank you. I think it's time to go back to the castle.
   <SYNC START=2389055>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2390584>
      <P>Strange..., I've never felt so relaxed like this before.
   <SYNC START=2395649>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2473396>
      <P>You, stink. The smell is like an animal and burnt iron.
   <SYNC START=2476928>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2496964>
      <P>If you fly for too long, you'll never be able to return to the normal shape
   <SYNC START=2500852>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2504534>
      <P>Isn't it great? Sophie gave me these firewoods.
   <SYNC START=2507559>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2510671>
      <P>War started. It was a sea of flame from southern ocean to northern boundary...
   <SYNC START=2515581>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2516344>
      <P>I hate fire that comes from gunpowder.
   <SYNC START=2520412>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2522418>
      <P>I was attacked by someone similar in kind
   <SYNC START=2524518>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2523990>
      <P>"Witch in Waste Land"?
   <SYNC START=2525171>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2525271>
      <P>No. They weren't any matche for me, but they had already turned into monsters
   <SYNC START=2528790>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2529648>
      <P>Sooner or later, they will definitely regret themselves.
   <SYNC START=2532084>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2532572>
      <P>They won't be able to go back to human form.
   <SYNC START=2534400>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2535267>
      <P>They are fine. They've already forgotten how to regret.
   <SYNC START=2537757>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2538616>
      <P>Howl You've been called by the king, haven't you?
   <SYNC START=2540617>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2541292>
      <P>Yeah. Would you send me a hot water to the bathroom?
   <SYNC START=2544058>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2544350>
      <P>What? Again?
   <SYNC START=2546068>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2578993>
      <P>Is it Howl? I think he uses too much hot water.
   <SYNC START=2582231>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2588136>
      <P>I think Master Howl will never eat it. Let's see what happens.
   <SYNC START=2591689>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2592233>
      <P>Good morning.Good morning.

   <SYNC START=2631194>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2632110>
      <P>They seemed to have gotten  a serious damage.
   <SYNC START=2633771>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2634305>
      <P>You are kidding! I'll be back soon, ma'am.

      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2661048>
      <P>Sophie, let's go closer.
   <SYNC START=2662898>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2663124>
      <P>I'm scared. I'm not going. Please....That ship was the state-of-the-art battleship. I wonder what could beat it.
   <SYNC START=2667123>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2674183>
      <P>Marker, I see a "dark human".
   <SYNC START=2675710>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2676595>
      <P>Huh...? Don't look at him!
   <SYNC START=2677731>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2678253>
      <P>He is one of  "Witch in Waste Land's " followers
   <SYNC START=2680586>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2686090>
      <P>I guess normal humans can't see him.
   <SYNC START=2689621>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2697993>
      <P>There! Over there! Look at it! It dropped the bomb!
   <SYNC START=2699306>

   <SYNC START=2699442>
      <P>Sophie, look! That's an enemy's battleship!

      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2709538>
      <P>Don't pick up our enemy's fliers!
   <SYNC START=2712107>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2717135>
      <P>Sophie, are you ok?
   <SYNC START=2718719>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2725013>
      <P>I need a glass of water.
   <SYNC START=2726889>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2743618>
      <P>aaahhhhhhhhh!!!! Sophie you touched something in the cabinet in the bathroom, didn't you?
   <SYNC START=2745610>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2746161>
      <P>Look at this! It's your fault! I don't want this hair color!
   <SYNC START=2749660>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2750587>
      <P>You have beautiful hair.
   <SYNC START=2751525>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2751586>
      <P>Look more carefully! Sophie, because YOU rearranged stuff up there, my spell got messed up!
   <SYNC START=2756037>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2757524>
      <P>I didn't do such a thing. I just cleaned the bathroom.
   <SYNC START=2759594>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2760371>
      <P>That's why I told you not to clean everything too much!
   <SYNC START=2764811>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2765740>
      <P>I'm ruined ...
   <SYNC START=2767183>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2768169>
      <P>What a humiliation...
   <SYNC START=2769909>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2772337>
      <P>Your hair doesn't look that bad.
   <SYNC START=2774075>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2781980>
      <P>That color is not bad either.
   <SYNC START=2784777>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2785355>
      <P>I'm hopeless. I'm not handsome anymore...I want to die.
   <SYNC START=2789927>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2801510>
      <P>Howl, calm down. Stop!
   <SYNC START=2803697>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2804500>
      <P>He summons a dark spirit.He summoned it before, when he was refused by a girl.
   <SYNC START=2809187>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2812953>
      <P>OK, Howl. Nothing gets better by doing this.
   <SYNC START=2817059>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2828981>
      <P>You can change your hair color again, can't you? That's enough. Do whatever you want! I've never been beautiful!
   <SYNC START=2834069>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2836396>
      <P>I don't wanna stay here anymore!
   <SYNC START=2838348>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2877453>

   <SYNC START=2884567>
      <P>Howl, stop it! Or I'll disappear!
   <SYNC START=2887514>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2889042>
      <P>Sophie! Hurry up!
   <SYNC START=2891554>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2894374>

   <SYNC START=2964463>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2968319>
      <P>I'll put it here. You should drink it before it gets cold.
   <SYNC START=2971700>

      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2997142>
      <P>"Witch in Waste Land" is looking for this castle.
   <SYNC START=3000311>
      <P>&nbsp;

      <P>These interiors are all amulets.I've been scared every second.
   <SYNC START=3011194>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3011742>
      <P>Why on earth have you been targeted by "Witch in Waste Land"?
   <SYNC START=3013586>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3015425>
      <P>She was totally evil-minded.
   <SYNC START=3018459>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3019372>
      <P>I'm the one who had contact with her, because I found her interesting.
   <SYNC START=3022562>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3023586>
      <P>And then, I ran away.
   <SYNC START=3026735>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3030003>
      <P>And this time, I was summoned by the king.
   <SYNC START=3032516>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3032942>
      <P>Also Jenkins and Pen dragon were.
   <SYNC START=3035858>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3036002>
      <P>How many names do you have, Howl?
   <SYNC START=3037586>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3038440>
      <P>Several names enough to live my life of freedom...I see.
   <SYNC START=3040016>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3041998>
      <P>You have no choice but to obey the king's order?
   <SYNC START=3043686>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3044690>
      <P>Look!.
   <SYNC START=3046043>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3046375>
      <P>I had to have a contract with the king when I entered the school of magic.
   <SYNC START=3050179>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3052672>
      <P>So, Howl, why don't you go and see the king, then?
   <SYNC START=3055284>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3057686>
      <P> Say to him, "I don't want to help you with this stupid war.".
   <SYNC START=3062862>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3065096>
      <P>Sophie you can say it easily, because you don't know what kind of people they are.
   <SYNC START=3067798>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3068566>
      <P>He's the king, isn't he? He's supposed to care about his people, isn't he?
   <SYNC START=3072949>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3074195>
      <P>That's right! Sophie, you can go to see the king! What do you mean?
   <SYNC START=3077646>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3079610>
      <P>You go as Pen dragon's mom.
   <SYNC START=3081364>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3081971>
      <P>And say, "My son is coward and useless.".
   <SYNC START=3085685>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3086030>
      <P>If you say so, Madam Saliman might give up.
   <SYNC START=3088536>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3089155>
      <P>Madam Saliman?
   <SYNC START=3090388>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3094518>
      <P>After all your work to clean my cloths.
   <SYNC START=3095859>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3096383>
      <P>Do you still wear that hat?
   <SYNC START=3098124>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3099204>
      <P>I'm off. See you guys later.
   <SYNC START=3100508>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3101440>
      <P>See you later.
   <SYNC START=3102815>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3110975>
      <P>Good luck, Sophie.It'll protects you from "Witch in Waste Land".
   <SYNC START=3113651>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3115516>
      <P>You're gonna be fine. I'm coming with you by transforming into something
   <SYNC START=3118584>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3118786>
      <P>Good luck!.
   <SYNC START=3120021>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3128245>
      <P>I doubt if it's gonna work...
   <SYNC START=3130213>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3139206>
      <P>He's supposed to protect me. I hope that crow isn't him.
   <SYNC START=3142953>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3150012>
      <P>I think Howl transformed into something identical.
   <SYNC START=3153067>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3158708>
      <P>I hope he's not that one.
   <SYNC START=3159710>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3171414>
      <P>Still long way to go to get to the palace
   <SYNC START=3173288>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3215523>
      <P>Howl, are you Howl?
   <SYNC START=3218721>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3223153>
      <P>You are mean. You didn't need to become an OLD dog!
   <SYNC START=3226147>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3226588>
      <P>You don't know how stressful and tiring it is to be an OLD lady.
   <SYNC START=3229636>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3233078>
      <P>Hello, again. Aren't you the shop keeper of the hat shop?
   <SYNC START=3235755>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3236516>
      <P>Isn't she "Witch in Waste Land"?
   <SYNC START=3238021>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3238215>
      <P>Thank you for handing the letter to Howl.
   <SYNC START=3240753>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3243690>
      <P>How is he doing?
   <SYNC START=3245590>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3245753>
      <P>He was trembling in fear.I'm working for him as a cleaning lady, by the way.
   <SYNC START=3250294>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3251885>
      <P>It's good for you.
   <SYNC START=3254039>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3255325>
      <P>But why do you need to go to the palace?
   <SYNC START=3257497>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3258131>
      <P>I'm asking the government for job.I'm fed up with being Howl's cleaning lady.
   <SYNC START=3262835>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3261718>
      <P>How about you? What are you doing here?
   <SYNC START=3262446>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3263517>
      <P>I'm going to see the king.
   <SYNC START=3265497>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3266763>
      <P>it finally seems that Saliman, that idiot, can't do it without me anymore.
   <SYNC START=3270245>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3271083>
      <P>I'm not interested in that topic. But dispel this curse you put on me.
   <SYNC START=3273813>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3274748>
      <P>Unfortunately, no. I can spell the curse on, but I can't dispel it. Farewell.
   <SYNC START=3280272>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3280293>
      <P>Ciao.
   <SYNC START=3281403>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3283363>
      <P>Wait, you can't go! Wait!
   <SYNC START=3286128>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3287965>
      <P>I would have gone up to her and hit her, if you hadn't  been like that!
   <SYNC START=3290492>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3308441>
      <P>What's going on? What happened to you guys?
   <SYNC START=3309438>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3310006>
      <P>Madam, magic is forbidden from here on .
   <SYNC START=3312966>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3313415>
      <P>You can only walk.
   <SYNC START=3314826>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3315626>
      <P>Is that you, Saliman? Do you want ME to go up stairs on foot?
   <SYNC START=3320527>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3331805>
      <P>I'm catching up.You can 't stare at her like that. 
   <SYNC START=3334599>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3359373>
      <P>Oh, my...! I hate this.Why are you so heavy?
   <SYNC START=3362446>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3372486>
      <P>Hey! You! Why don't you wait for me?
   <SYNC START=3377410>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3377620>
      <P>What do you want? Did you remember how to dispel my curse?
   <SYNC START=3382110>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3382202>
      <P>I said I forgot. I can't dispel.
   <SYNC START=3387365>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3387241>
      <P>You'd better study hard!
   <SYNC START=3389189>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3393938>
      <P>I don't understand...Why is she still that vital?
   <SYNC START=3398832>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3407355>
      <P>Let me have a small break.
   <SYNC START=3409989>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3415422>
      <P>Hey, you! You'd better give up today. It's impossible for you to climb all the way to the top.
   <SYNC START=3419586>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3419939>
      <P>Since..., I..., was..., kicked out..., of the palace..., 50 years ago..., 
   <SYNC START=3426834>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3427255>
      <P>I had been..., waiting for  this chance...
   <SYNC START=3429734>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3430281>
      <P>Do whatever you want, then unfortunately I can't be kind to you to take your hand.
   <SYNC START=3434499>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3435587>
      <P>Come on, Howl.
   <SYNC START=3437064>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3438468>
      <P>How cold-hearted are you! I'll turn you into even OLDER women next time!
   <SYNC START=3443473>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3463813>
      <P>Come on! Hurry! Quick, quick!
   <SYNC START=3465806>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3466842>
      <P>Hello, Madam. This way, please.
   <SYNC START=3468791>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3469195>
      <P>But, I think you should help that lady down there, first.
   <SYNC START=3471276>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3472354>
      <P>We are not allowed to take anyone's hand, I'm afraid, Madam.
   <SYNC START=3474936>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3475360>
      <P>How cruel! Didn't the king summon us to the palace?
   <SYNC START=3478012>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3478943>
      <P>Hey, you! Keep up! You can do it!
   <SYNC START=3481077>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3481911>
      <P>You're nearly there.
   <SYNC START=3483920>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3484528>
      <P>Don't you have more stamina?
   <SYNC START=3487350>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3488109>
      <P>Shut up!!
   <SYNC START=3489810>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3491945>
      <P>You look terribly and older in such a short period.
   <SYNC START=3494163>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3495778>
      <P>Mrs. Pen dragon, and "Witch in Waste Land"!
   <SYNC START=3498152>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3500023>
      <P>Are you OK? You wanted to come here, didn't you?
   <SYNC START=3503136>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3507337>
      <P>Mrs. Pen dragon, and "Witch in Waste Land"!
   <SYNC START=3510627>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3511282>
      <P>Pen dragon? I've heard of that name before...
   <SYNC START=3514027>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3514886>
      <P>Of course you do. This is the name of the hat shop I was working for.
   <SYNC START=3517964>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3518895>
      <P>I doubt it!.
   <SYNC START=3520016>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3528609>
      <P>Wait here please..
   <SYNC START=3533940>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3543071>
      <P>Howl, come over here!
   <SYNC START=3545291>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3553365>
      <P>Come this way please, Madam.
   <SYNC START=3555257>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3614856>
      <P>You are Howl's mother?
   <SYNC START=3616971>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3617637>
      <P>My name is Pen dragon, your highness.
   <SYNC START=3620203>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3620463>
      <P>You're tired, aren't you? You may sit there.
   <SYNC START=3623034>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3623363>
      <P>Thank you.
   <SYNC START=3623918>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3634765>
      <P>How do you do? My name is Saliman, a royal sorcerer.
   <SYNC START=3637848>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3643682>
      <P>Ah..., your highness? That dog is...
   <SYNC START=3645075>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3645899>
      <P>This dog? His name is Hean, my lovely
   <SYNC START=3648918>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3649301>
      <P>I asked him to guide you all the way here.
   <SYNC START=3650815>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3655360>
      <P>So, you want to say Howl is not coming, is he?
   <SYNC START=3657636>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3658999>
      <P>Howl, my son, is such a coward and a incapable wizard.
   <SYNC START=3661289>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3662052>
      <P>Your highness I don't think he can help the king.
   <SYNC START=3664683>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3666246>
      <P>I'm disappointed... Oh,
   <SYNC START=3668208>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3668744>
      <P>Howl was my last apprentice...
   <SYNC START=3671139>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3672947>
      <P>He used to be incredibly talented.
   <SYNC START=3675483>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3676255>
      <P>I even thought about giving him my position soon.
   <SYNC START=3680349>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3682538>
      <P>I was so pleased of it.
   <SYNC START=3685689>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3685669>
      <P>however his heart was stolen  by evil, and then he left right after...
   <SYNC START=3687333>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3688099>
      <P>He began to use magic for his own purpose.
   <SYNC START=3691434>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3694767>
      <P>Howl's mother.Yes.
   <SYNC START=3695790>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3696266>
      <P>He is too dangerous he's got too much power, but he doesn't have enough strength in is heart to control it.
   <SYNC START=3702358>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3703541>
      <P>I'm afraid he's going to be like "Witch in Waste Land" if you don't do anything for him.
   <SYNC START=3707214>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3707782>
      <P>Bring her here..
   <SYNC START=3708554>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3715444>
      <P>Hey, you! Are you OK?
   <SYNC START=3717024>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3718901>
      <P>She's all right. I brought her back to her real age.
   <SYNC START=3721129>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3721751>
      <P>She has  no magic power anymore.
   <SYNC START=3723144>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3724086>
      <P>She also used to be very talented in magic.
   <SYNC START=3727615>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3728612>
      <P>Since she made deals with evils gradually her body and soul had been eaten up.
   <SYNC START=3734055>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3735069>
      <P>Now, the kingdom is not going to allow those back-alley wizards and witches to live unchecked.
   <SYNC START=3740269>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3740741>
      <P>I'm going to tell him how to end his deal with evils
   <SYNC START=3743812>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3744225>
      <P>if you bring him here and he promises he'll be devoted to the king.
   <SYNC START=3746034>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3747568>
      <P>If he doesn't come, I'll take away all his power.
   <SYNC START=3749767>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3750134>
      <P>Like that poor lady.
   <SYNC START=3751359>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3752482>
      <P>Your highness,
   <SYNC START=3754216>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3754841>
      <P>Now I see why Howl didn't want to come here.
   <SYNC START=3757956>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3758824>
      <P>Something's wrong here.
   <SYNC START=3762803>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3760365>
      <P>You let old ladies like us climb up such a long stair without any help, even though you summoned us.
   <SYNC START=3764364>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3763049>
      <P>And you led us to a strange room like that. It's like a trap!
   <SYNC START=3765702>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3766337>
      <P>Howl has no heart?
   <SYNC START=3767830>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3768423>
      <P>You are right in a way that he's coward and selfish, and sometimes I can't see what he's thinking.
   <SYNC START=3771992>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3772993>
      <P>But he is honest. He just wants to live with freedom. He's not coming.
   <SYNC START=3775823>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3776581>
      <P>He's not going to be evil.
   <SYNC START=3778742>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3780037>
      <P>And he can handle his relationship by himself.
   <SYNC START=3781738>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3781664>
      <P>I believe so.
   <SYNC START=3782940>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3784363>
      <P>Howl's mother, you are in love with him, aren't you
   <SYNC START=3787174>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3788238>
      <P>Howl, Howl's coming?
   <SYNC START=3790710>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3791553>
      <P>I want to eat his heart. I want it!
   <SYNC START=3794671>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3794697>
      <P>You, why don't you just give up? Howl's not coming!
   <SYNC START=3797937>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3799732>
      <P>Yes, he is.
   <SYNC START=3801699>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3803232>
      <P>I found his weak point
   <SYNC START=3804770>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3812008>
      <P>Your Majesty.You should still stay in bed, Saliman
   <SYNC START=3814243>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3814876>
      <P>Do you feel better?
   <SYNC START=3816038>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3816460>
      <P>I feel well today, Your Majesty. I got bored with meetings, so I took a walk in the sky for a while.
   <SYNC START=3821142>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3821142>
      <P>Good for you, Your Majesty.Who are those ladies?
   <SYNC START=3823836>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3825027>
      <P>She is mother of the  wizard Howl.
   <SYNC START=3827340>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3832660>
      <P>I'm glad to see you,I pretty appreciate Saliman's effort, but I don't think I will use magic in battle
   <SYNC START=3836659>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3837843>
      <P>In fact, enemy's bombs never reach this palace because of Saliman's magic power.
   <SYNC START=3841789>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3842311>
      <P>Instead, they do it to surrounding towns, I'm afraid.
   <SYNC START=3844723>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3844806>
      <P>That's the way it is.Don't you think, Saliman?
   <SYNC START=3847325>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3847831>
      <P>Absolutely. You are very philosophical today, Your Majesty.
   <SYNC START=3849985>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3850115>
      <P>There you are, Saliman!
   <SYNC START=3851939>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3854579>
      <P>Finally, we're getting into the final battle!
   <SYNC START=3857886>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3861578>
      <P>We must beat them completely in this Saliman, this time you made such a brilliant double.I'll come back with good news!
   <SYNC START=3864331>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3864630>
      <P>I'm looking forward to hearing it, Your Majesty.
   <SYNC START=3866786>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3867546>
      <P>All generals are ready? Yes.
   <SYNC START=3869365>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3873452>
      <P>It's been a while, Howl.
   <SYNC START=3875652>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3875952>
      <P>I'm so glad to see you again, Master.
   <SYNC START=3878088>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3878549>
      <P>I knew it was you.
   <SYNC START=3880373>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3880951>
      <P>I didn't break the promise.
   <SYNC START=3882765>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3880951>
      <P>That's because,
   <SYNC START=3882765>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3882301>
      <P>I don't want to fight against you, Master.
   <SYNC START=3884601>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3885691>
      <P>I'm going home with my mother.
   <SYNC START=3886891>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3887317>
      <P>I won't let you go.
   <SYNC START=3888724>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3910438>
      <P>Don't look at the ground. She is extremely powerful.
   <SYNC START=3912499>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3913277>
      <P>Show your mother your real identity!
   <SYNC START=3916525>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3970920>
      <P>Howl, no!
   <SYNC START=3972307>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3985520>
      <P>Hang on tight!
   <SYNC START=3986488>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3994563>
      <P>Sophie, move to the front!
   <SYNC START=3995870>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=3998078>
      <P>After all, you brought everybody with you, didn't you?
   <SYNC START=4001177>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4003117>
      <P>doggy
   <SYNC START=4004155>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4005820>
      <P>You are on Saliman's side, aren't you?
   <SYNC START=4007891>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4008241>
      <P>I want you to get you off somewhere.You can't fly, can you?
   <SYNC START=4010883>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4011583>
      <P>Sophie, you drive.
   <SYNC START=4013097>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4013419>
      <P>Are you kidding? That's insane!
   <SYNC START=4015158>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4015203>
      <P>They are catching up! Already
   <SYNC START=4016500>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4021687>
      <P>I'll take care of them.Sophie, you keep flying to the castle in Waste Land, OK?
   <SYNC START=4024891>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4024919>
      <P>Are you serious? I've never even driven a car!
   <SYNC START=4026777>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4026924>
      <P>Did you forget you are wearing the ring? It will guide you to the castle.
   <SYNC START=4029434>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4029863>
      <P>Call Calucifer in your hand.
   <SYNC START=4031827>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4032495>
      <P>Call Calucifer...?
   <SYNC START=4033814>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4037293>
      <P>It worked.
   <SYNC START=4038011>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4039792>
      <P>Head to the direction the light is pointing at. That's it.I suppose you'll get there by the evening.
   <SYNC START=4042647>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4042914>
      <P>I think I didn't need to go to the palace, because you came after all!
   <SYNC START=4045784>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4046235>
      <P>I did, because you were there, Sophie
   <SYNC START=4048487>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4049090>
      <P>I couldn't have been there if I had been without you.
   <SYNC START=4051148>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4052033>
      <P>You saved me.
   <SYNC START=4053393>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4053842>
      <P>It was really close I tell you.
   <SYNC START=4055505>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4057219>
      <P>Don't release the wheel suddenly!
   <SYNC START=4058828>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4066315>
      <P>You drive very well.No way!
   <SYNC START=4067829>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4070189>
      <P>Wow, you threw them away a bit.
   <SYNC START=4071885>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4072294>
      <P>I'll make them blind for five seconds, so that you can go further.
   <SYNC START=4074956>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4078606>
      <P>Howl!
   <SYNC START=4079679>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4092573>
      <P>No, thanks.
   <SYNC START=4093690>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4094446>
      <P>Thanks.It was really an exciting moment.
   <SYNC START=4097784>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4098372>
      <P>Howl believes he escaped successfully, but he didn't.
   <SYNC START=4100381>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4101880>
      <P>He has  a very young mother, doesn't he by the way?
   <SYNC START=4104304>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4154843>
      <P>Don't expect me to be friendly with you. 
   <SYNC START=4157177>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4160478>
      <P>Besides, I still don't trust you. You know that?
   <SYNC START=4163904>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4187681>
      <P>The castle is there! It's welcoming us!
   <SYNC START=4189222>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4194397>
      <P>Over here, Sophie!
   <SYNC START=4196638>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4197069>
      <P>Marker! I have a little problem. Where is the brake!?
   <SYNC START=4200909>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4212967>
      <P>Sophie!
   <SYNC START=4213994>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4215349>
      <P>Doggy!.
   <SYNC START=4216246>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4218946>
      <P>I'm successfully home, Marker!
   <SYNC START=4221308>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4222315>
      <P>Are you OK, Sophie?
   <SYNC START=4223953>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4224469>
      <P>I'm was very worried about you!
   <SYNC START=4226389>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4226464>
      <P>Thank you for catching us.
   <SYNC START=4228678>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4260025>
      <P>That's no good! You did too much!
   <SYNC START=4262004>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4280845>
      <P>Was it Howl? Did he come back?
   <SYNC START=4283122>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4336941>
      <P>Howl!
   <SYNC START=4337832>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4399694>
      <P>Howl !Are you OK, Howl?
   <SYNC START=4402284>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4404907>
      <P>You got injured, didn't you does it..hurt?
   <SYNC START=4407890>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4408273>
      <P>Don't..., come...
   <SYNC START=4409639>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4410125>
      <P>I came to help you! I want to set you free from the curse put on you!
   <SYNC START=4413934>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4414862>
      <P>You should dispel your own curse first. And why do you try to do this for monster like me?
   <SYNC START=4418537>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4419087>
      <P>Because I'm in love with you!
   <SYNC START=4420848>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4421792>
      <P>It's too late!
   <SYNC START=4422770>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4427443>
      <P>Howl
   <SYNC START=4428645>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4441905>
      <P>Howl did come back, didn't he?
   <SYNC START=4443783>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4443717>
      <P>Sophie, I want to set the curse between Howl and me free. Don't you still know the secret between us yet?
   <SYNC START=4447520>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4448587>
      <P>Our time is ticking to the end...
   <SYNC START=4450433>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4450843>
      <P>Howl is turning into a demon, isn't he?
   <SYNC START=4452358>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4452486>
      <P>Is that right?
   <SYNC START=4453180>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4453553>
      <P>I can't tell you the truth!.Because I'm an evil. You know that!
   <SYNC START=4456803>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4459085>
      <P>Listen, Calucifer. Saliman told me Howl gave you something very important for him.
   <SYNC START=4463929>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4464448>
      <P>What and where is it?
   <SYNC START=4465639>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4466401>
      <P>I can't speak about the secret of the contract.
   <SYNC START=4468898>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4469349>
      <P>Or I'll give you water.
   <SYNC START=4471445>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4471973>
      <P>Didn't you hear? If I die, Howl dies too.
   <SYNC START=4474391>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4494352>
      <P>Good morning, "turnip head".Are you allright. 
   <SYNC START=4497254>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4501279>
      <P>All right, Sophie! Come on!
   <SYNC START=4503248>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4503758>
      <P>OK! Calucifer, open the mouse bigger! 3, 2, 1, GO! Come on!
   <SYNC START=4506833>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4507814>
      <P>Hang on tight! Let's get it through!
   <SYNC START=4509104>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4521364>
      <P>Why..., don't..., you MOVE!!!
   <SYNC START=4524582>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4548378>
      <P>It's a bunch of bits and pieces inside the castle. I can't imagine it from the outside.
   <SYNC START=4552532>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4554569>
      <P>Everyone! It's time for lunch!
   <SYNC START=4556902>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4562998>
      <P>Here's your porridge, granny.
   <SYNC START=4564425>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4565969>
      <P>Sophie, she's "Witch in Waste Land". Why do you take care of her?
   <SYNC START=4568188>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4568901>
      <P>She is a harmless poor old lady now.
   <SYNC START=4569962>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4570542>
      <P>She's staring at me all the time.
   <SYNC START=4572218>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4573214>
      <P>What a beautiful fire...
   <SYNC START=4574685>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4577931>
      <P>Howl? Hey, everybody!
   <SYNC START=4579683>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4580242>
      <P>Welcome back.Master howl, may I keep this dog?
   <SYNC START=4583225>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4584056>
      <P>"Witch in Waste Land" and Master Saliman's dog, I'm impressed you got all of them in the castle, Calucifer.
   <SYNC START=4586601>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4587289>
      <P>How tolerant you are.
   <SYNC START=4589323>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4590006>
      <P>I didn't granted! But Sophie forced me to let them in!
   <SYNC START=4593480>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4596581>
      <P>What a big hole you made!
   <SYNC START=4598038>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4599394>
      <P>You are "Turnip head", right?
   <SYNC START=4601520>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4603810>
      <P>You've also got a complicated curse on you, haven't you?
   <SYNC START=4605672>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4606871>
      <P>There are full of mysterious members who have sophisticated backgrounds in our family.
   <SYNC START=4608789>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4609204>
      <P>How handsome you are, young boy.
   <SYNC START=4611065>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4611754>
      <P>Well, it's gonna be very busy today.!!We're saying goodbye to "Waste Land" and moving to somewhere else.
   <SYNC START=4614733>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4615374>
      <P>But to where...? Great! Because we're running out of food, we needed a house in a town so that we can go shopping.
   <SYNC START=4619239>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4619621>
      <P>That's right. We have to move to a place where Master Saliman can't find us so easily.
   <SYNC START=4622577>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4623511>
      <P>But I'm afraid you must stay here, because your magic power is too strong.
   <SYNC START=4627212>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4633593>
      <P>This is lovely. 
   <SYNC START=4634945>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4635883>
      <P>OK, come on calucifer!
   <SYNC START=4637682>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4652869>
      <P>Yes! This is perfect! Stay on the table until I finish the ritual
   <SYNC START=4655592>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4659739>
      <P>I'm fragile, you know...
   <SYNC START=4660786>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4664796>
      <P>Let's begin.
   <SYNC START=4666029>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4710288>
      <P>Here's our destination.
   <SYNC START=4712292>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4715108>
      <P>You can move around in our new house.Wow! Super cool, Master Howl! What a big house!
   <SYNC START=4717456>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4717650>
      <P>What a beautiful fire...
   <SYNC START=4719958>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4734543>
      <P>It's...Look at the toilet. Lovely, isn't it? Now we got bigger family.
   <SYNC START=4738731>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4739984>
      <P>Sophie, come down here. Look! Sophie!
   <SYNC START=4742486>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4746286>
      <P>I added one more room you can look inside the room.
   <SYNC START=4749324>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4759407>
      <P>I'm familiar with this room. But why...?
   <SYNC START=4761705>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4761788>
      <P>I made this room for you, Sophie.I hope you like it.
   <SYNC START=4764270>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4766094>
      <P>Let's see...This room is too nice for a cleaning lady, Howl.
   <SYNC START=4768747>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4769642>
      <P>I bought new cloths for you.Come with me for the next surprise.
   <SYNC START=4773139>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4773591>
      <P>Sophie! Come on! Hurry up!
   <SYNC START=4776655>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4776926>
      <P>Wow, we've got courtyard! There are many shops in this town as well.
   <SYNC START=4780692>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4780642>
      <P>Let's go, Hean! Sophie
   <SYNC START=4782901>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4782968>
      <P>Since we changed the door color,
   <SYNC START=4784411>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4784575>
      <P> This is the new entrance of the castle.
   <SYNC START=4785450>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4789058>
      <P>This is a present for you, Sophie.Here we go.
   <SYNC START=4792055>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4817325>
      <P>This is my secret garden.Fantastic.
   <SYNC START=4820765>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4823605>
      <P>This is also what you created by the magic?
   <SYNC START=4825869>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4826424>
      <P>No. I used magic only for helping weak flowers.
   <SYNC START=4828705>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4838106>
      <P>Magnificent! It's wonderful, Howl! It's like a dream...
   <SYNC START=4842182>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4865408>
      <P>Sophie.
   <SYNC START=4867382>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4867799>
      <P>It's strange...I feel familiar with this place as if I've been here before...
   <SYNC START=4871357>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4872406>
      <P>I don't know why, but tears are coming out...
   <SYNC START=4873412>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4874687>
      <P>Come with me.
   <SYNC START=4876435>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4883803>
      <P>Look!
   <SYNC START=4885741>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4890607>
      <P>What a cute house.That's my hiding place.
   <SYNC START=4893495>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4894672>
      <P>I used to stay there alone in summer when I was a kid.
   <SYNC START=4897633>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4898752>
      <P>Stayed alone...?
   <SYNC START=4900938>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4901936>
      <P>My uncle left that lodge stealthily for me. He was also a wizard.
   <SYNC START=4905201>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4905894>
      <P>That's also for you, Sophie.
   <SYNC START=4907518>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4911676>
      <P>Is something wrong with you? If go there, you'll go somewhere far away and leave me behind, won't you?
   <SYNC START=4917756>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4920551>
      <P>Howl, tell me the truth.I don't care about your real identity.
   <SYNC START=4925827>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4931583>
      <P>Listen, I just want you to live in peace.
   <SYNC START=4934451>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4935440>
      <P>How about opening a flower shop and sharing beautiful flowers in here with people in the town?
   <SYNC START=4939024>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4939727>
      <P>I think you can handle it.
   <SYNC START=4941932>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4942568>
      <P>Are you leaving after that?
   <SYNC START=4944162>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4946284>
      <P>I want to help you.
   <SYNC START=4948885>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4949690>
      <P>Obviously, I'm not a beautiful girl. Only thing I can do is clean the house, though.
   <SYNC START=4953072>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4954112>
      <P>Sophie, you are beautiful. You really are.
   <SYNC START=4955893>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4960642>
      <P>Good thing about being old is to have fewer things to lose.
   <SYNC START=4964296>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4977790>
      <P>How could anyone pass the beautiful place like this by a bloody battleship?
   <SYNC START=4980469>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4980154>
      <P>To where's it heading? To towns to kill people...
   <SYNC START=4983351>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4983610>
      <P>Is that enemy or...? Both do the same thing. They kill each other.
   <SYNC START=4987551>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=4998337>
      <P>They are addicted to killing.
   <SYNC START=4999790>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5007008>
      <P>Look at the amount of bombs they are carrying.
   <SYNC START=5009773>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5025551>
      <P>It stopped...Did you use magic?
   <SYNC START=5027772>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5028721>
      <P>A little bit. It's not going down, anyway.
   <SYNC START=5030862>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5034780>
      <P>Howl, you...I wonder if they found us.
   <SYNC START=5038649>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5047740>
      <P>They are Master Saliman's lowest class monsters.
   <SYNC START=5050345>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5051224>
      <P>Run! Move your legs!
   <SYNC START=5052919>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5079604>
      <P>Sophie, what's the matter?
   <SYNC START=5081213>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5082662>
      <P>Ouch! This is enough! I'm leaving this house!
   <SYNC START=5085328>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5094242>
      <P>Sophie, good night.Good night
   <SYNC START=5097418>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5099482>
      <P>Sophie, you don't need to be worried about Master Howl.He sometimes leaves the house for a few days.
   <SYNC START=5103872>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5104396>
      <P>Thanks, Marker.
   <SYNC START=5106532>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5106733>
      <P>Do you want to go to the toilet before you go to bed? I'm fine.
   <SYNC START=5110174>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5111388>
      <P>You are in love with Howl, aren't you?
   <SYNC START=5114260>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5115111>
      <P>And you can't concentrate on what you do, can you?
   <SYNC START=5118585>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5130079>
      <P>I got it
   <SYNC START=5130413>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5132451>
      <P>Granny, have you ever been in love with someone? Of course, I have.
   <SYNC START=5138117>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5139297>
      <P>Even I do know.Are you kidding ! I love young men's heart. They are delicious!
   <SYNC START=5145559>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5144987>
      <P>You haven't given up, have you?
   <SYNC START=5147997>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5147162>
      <P>And they are cute.
   <SYNC START=5150939>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5153168>
      <P>What's that sound? That's air-raid siren.
   <SYNC START=5156074>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5156660>
      <P>Air-raid?
   <SYNC START=5158576>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5159370>
      <P>That's not for this city though, you'd better not to go out tonight.
   <SYNC START=5162974>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5165085>
      <P>Saliman's monsters are looking for this house.
   <SYNC START=5169068>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5172456>
      <P>You are such a clever fire...Hiding this house from them very skillfully.
   <SYNC START=5177073>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5211462>
      <P>Sophie, that woman came into the house without permission.
   <SYNC START=5213344>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5221259>
      <P>Mom..Sophie!
   <SYNC START=5224210>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5226933>
      <P>Where were you?! I've been looking for you
   <SYNC START=5229496>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5230529>
      <P>You look like a granny.
   <SYNC START=5232560>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5233720>
      <P>It's all my fault.
   <SYNC START=5236228>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5237258>
      <P>Sophie, I'm sorry.
   <SYNC START=5239218>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5240257>
      <P>Oh, mom...
   <SYNC START=5241975>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5244435>
      <P>You rearranged inside completely.
   <SYNC START=5246537>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5246872>
      <P>Who is that old lady over there? Ah, she must be the landlord.
   <SYNC START=5250950>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5251130>
      <P>Sophie, listen. I married with someone else.What?
   <SYNC START=5253696>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5254317>
      <P>He is gentle. He's rich as well.We can live together again.
   <SYNC START=5258400>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5259259>
      <P>You should quit being a clean lady.
   <SYNC START=5261704>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5262094>
      <P>Thank you for caring about me, but I love my life here.
   <SYNC START=5264610>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5265369>
      <P>Are you sure? Oh, no!
   <SYNC START=5267950>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5267865>
      <P>I forgot my car's waiting outside. I have to go.
   <SYNC START=5270409>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5288870>
      <P>Poisonous sneak created by a spell? Saliman, you use an old ploy, don't you?
   <SYNC START=5292022>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5293078>
      <P>Calucifer, burn it.
   <SYNC START=5294503>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5303788>
      <P>I'm always praying  for your happiness, mom.Thank you. You, too Sophie.
   <SYNC START=5308319>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5312812>
      <P>I did what I was told.I want to go back to my husband.Sure. Madam Saliman will be proud of you.
   <SYNC START=5319089>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5321201>
      <P>So sorry..., Sophie.
   <SYNC START=5322896>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5327025>
      <P>So many people...After everyone runs away, the town will be empty...
   <SYNC START=5331870>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5332530>
      <P>Do you want to evacuate with them, too?
   <SYNC START=5335213>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5335996>
      <P>That lady said so.You're right.
   <SYNC START=5339745>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5340031>
      <P>We were reconciled to each other.
   <SYNC START=5341679>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5342056>
      <P>I don't want you to leave, Sophie!
   <SYNC START=5344549>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5344862>
      <P>I like you very much, Sophie.Please live with us.
   <SYNC START=5347416>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5348255>
      <P>I like you very much, too Marker.I won't go anywhere.Really?
   <SYNC START=5355067>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5354685>
      <P>You and I are family? Of course, we are.
   <SYNC START=5357933>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5358830>
      <P>I was so worried about it.
   <SYNC START=5361218>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5368298>
      <P>I won't give you Howl, Saliman.
   <SYNC START=5370997>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5387808>
      <P>The paper says the kingdom won.Only the youth believe that.
   <SYNC START=5392350>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5393988>
      <P>Strange..., Calucifer doesn't seem to be there.
   <SYNC START=5397212>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5398430>
      <P>Granny, I hate smoke.The smell is everywhere in the house.
   <SYNC START=5401061>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5401849>
      <P>Are you going to take away my only enjoyment?
   <SYNC START=5404779>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5405768>
      <P>Would you open the window, Marker? 
   <SYNC START=5407625>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5411005>
      <P>I think you shouldn't open the window.
   <SYNC START=5413544>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5415267>
      <P>Calucifer's weak now.Monsters are coming in.
   <SYNC START=5419513>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5421362>
      <P>Marker?
   <SYNC START=5422754>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5433453>
      <P>Close it quickly!
   <SYNC START=5434814>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5442312>
      <P>Marker, you take care of granny.
   <SYNC START=5443812>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5442312>
      <P>I'm going to watch the shop.
   <SYNC START=5444812>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5462759>
      <P>I can't believe it in such an emergency! Why don't you guys put out fire?
   <SYNC START=5465918>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5490657>
      <P>Howl!
   <SYNC START=5492122>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5505255>
      <P>They have no mercy.
   <SYNC START=5506892>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5519762>
      <P>Oh, Howl!
   <SYNC START=5522221>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5523049>
      <P>Sorry, I'm late. There were too many enemies tonight.
   <SYNC START=5525751>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5526088>

      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5781512>
      <P>Let's go! Keep away from me.You should let me be the last.
   <SYNC START=5784759>
      <P>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=5785804>
      <P>Even I don't know what will happen if I go out of the castle.
   <SYNC START=5788873>
      <P>&nbsp;

   <SYNC START=5878238>
      <P>Calucifer, please. Only you can do it.
