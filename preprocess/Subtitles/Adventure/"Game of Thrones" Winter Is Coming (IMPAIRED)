166
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:35,583
<i>What if Jon Arryn</i>

167
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:37,918
But who would he tell?

168
00:19:37,953 --> 00:19:41,088
- My husband.
- If he told the King, both our heads

169
00:19:41,123 --> 00:19:43,323
would be skewered
on the city gates by now.

170
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:47,862
Whatever Jon Arryn
knew or didn't know, it died with him.

171
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:51,699
And Robert will choose a new
Hand of the King-- someone to do his job

172
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,635
while he's off fucking boars
and hunting whores--

173
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,638
or is it
the other way around?

174
00:19:57,673 --> 00:20:00,074
And life will go on.

175
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,677
You should be
The Hand of the King.

176

That's an honor
I can do without.

177
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,715
Their days are too long,

178
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,017
their lives are too short.

and I still feel
like an outsider

184
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:53,962
when I come here.

185
00:20:53,997 --> 00:20:56,532
You have five

You're not an outsider.

187

I wonder
if the old gods agree.

188
00:21:03,873 --> 00:21:06,775
It's your gods
with all the rules.

189
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,851
I am so sorry, my love.

190
00:21:16,254 --> 00:21:19,790
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

191
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,361
Jon Arryn is dead.

196
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:52,056
The raven
brought more news...

197
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,393
The King rides
for Winterfell...

198
00:21:55,428 --> 00:21:57,128
with the Queen

199

If he's coming
this far north...

201
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:06,172
There's only
one thing he's after.

202

You can always say no, Ned.

203
00:22:17,952 --> 00:22:21,689
Catelyn:
We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

204
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,657
I'm told he reads
all night.

205
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:25,593
I'm told he drinks
all night.

206
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:28,930
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

207
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:30,731
Stature?

208
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,435
We've brought up
eight barrels of ale from the cellar.

209
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:36,004
- Perhaps we'll find out.
- In any case,

<i>candles.</i>

211
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:45,882
Why is your mother so dead set
on us getting pretty for the King?

212
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,751
It's for the Queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

213
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:50,887
I hear the prince
is a right royal prick.

214
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:52,955
Think of all those
southern girls he gets to stab

215
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,557
with his right
royal prick.

216
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:58,460
Go on, Tommy,
shear him good.

217
00:22:58,494 --> 00:23:00,963

He's got hundreds of people.

How many times
have I told you no climbing?

But he's coming right now--
down our road.

224

I want you
to promise me,

225

no more climbing.

- Aye.

Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

I need you, Ned--

275
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:27,152
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

Lord Eddard Stark,

I would name you

I'm not worthy
of the honor.

I'm not trying to honor you.
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

You helped me win

now help me
keep the damn thing.

We were meant

If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

Well, it's not too late.

287
00:30:06,692 --> 00:30:08,627
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

Did you hear the King's

00:30:50,672 --> 00:30:52,607
I did hear
something about that.

And the Queen
and her twin brother.

296

They say that <i>he</i> is the most

And the other brother?

the clever one.

Mmm, I hear they
call him the imp.

301

I hear he hates
that nickname.

Oh?
I hear he's
more than earned it.

303

I hear he's a drunken

prone to all manner
of perversions.

- Don't get up.
- My Lord.

00:31:44,892 --> 00:31:47,227
Should I explain to you
the meaning of a closed door

313
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:50,998
- in a whorehouse, brother?
- You have much to teach me, no doubt,

but our sister craves
your attention.

She has odd cravings,
our sister.

316
00:31:56,838 --> 00:31:58,972
A family trait.

00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:12,153
I thought
you might say that.

322
00:32:12,187 --> 00:32:14,588
But since
we're short on time...

323
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:16,523
Come on, girls.

324
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:19,225
( Giggling )

325
00:32:21,595 --> 00:32:23,897
See you at sundown.

326
00:32:23,931 --> 00:32:26,499
Tyrion:
<i>Close the door!</i>

327
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:41,649
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

328
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:45,687
<i>She should be</i>
<i>on a hill somewhere</i>

329
00:32:45,722 --> 00:32:48,324
with the sun
and the clouds above her.

330
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:50,326
<i>She was my sister.</i>

331

This is where
she belongs.

332
00:32:53,163 --> 00:32:55,698
She belonged with me.

333
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:04,340
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

334
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,343
It's done, your Grace.

335
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:11,013
The Targaryens are gone.

336
00:33:13,016 --> 00:33:15,317
Not all of them.

Daenerys.

340
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:35,203
There's our bride-to-be.

341
00:33:36,105 --> 00:33:39,240
Look, a gift
from Illyrio.

342
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,076
Touch it.

343
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:44,312
Go on,
feel the fabric.

344
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:51,118
Mmm.

345
00:33:52,286 --> 00:33:55,089
Isn't he a gracious host?

346
00:33:57,259 --> 00:33:59,294
We've been his guests
for over a year

347
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,296
and he's never
asked us for anything.

348
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,065
Illyrio's no fool.

349
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:05,434
He knows I won't
forget my friends

350
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:07,503
when I come
into my throne.

351
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,308
You still slouch.

352
00:34:17,946 --> 00:34:20,347
Let them see.

353
00:34:22,984 --> 00:34:25,885
You have
a woman's body now.

( Sighs )

355
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:46,405
I need you to be
perfect today.

356
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:49,708
Can you do that for me?

357
00:34:53,113 --> 00:34:55,815
You don't want to wake
the dragon, do you?

358
00:34:57,252 --> 00:34:58,852
No.

359
00:35:05,794 --> 00:35:08,863
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

360
00:35:08,897 --> 00:35:11,131
they will say
it began today.

361
00:35:34,054 --> 00:35:36,523
It's too hot, my lady.

362
00:35:47,002 --> 00:35:49,436
<i>( Gulls cawing )</i>

Where is he?

364
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:02,180
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

365
00:36:15,395 --> 00:36:19,566
( Illyrio speaking Dothraki )
Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven.

366

May I present
my honored guests?

367
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:25,273
<i>Viserys</i>
<i>of House Targaryen,</i>

<i>the third of his name,</i>

<i>Daenerys</i>
<i>of House Targaryen.</i>

372

( Speaking Dothraki )

373
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,188
Do you see
how long his hair is?

374
00:36:40,223 --> 00:36:42,924
<i>When Dothraki are</i>
<i>defeated in combat,</i>

<i>so the whole world can</i>
<i>see their shame.</i>

376
00:36:46,928 --> 00:36:50,897
Khal Drogo has
never been defeated.

377
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,900
He's a savage, of course,

378
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:56,269
<i>but one of the finest</i>
<i>killers alive.</i>

379
00:36:57,538 --> 00:36:59,672
And you will be his Queen.

380
00:36:59,706 --> 00:37:02,341
Come forward, my dear.

381
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:44,083
Where is he going?!

382
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:46,652
- The ceremony is over.
- But he didn't say anything.

383
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:49,121
- Did he like her?
- Trust me, your Grace,

384
00:37:49,156 --> 00:37:51,657
if he didn't like her,
we'd know.

385
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:56,929
It won't be
long now.

386
00:37:56,963 --> 00:37:58,864
Soon you will cross
the Narrow Sea

387
00:37:58,898 --> 00:38:01,333
and take back
your father's throne.

388
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:04,268
The people
drink secret toasts

389
00:38:04,303 --> 00:38:06,003
to your health.

390
00:38:06,037 --> 00:38:08,372
They cry out
for their true king.

391
00:38:11,977 --> 00:38:13,845
When will they
be married?

392
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:17,416
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.

393
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,985
Is it true they lie
with their horses?

394
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,089
I wouldn't ask
Khal Drogo.

395
00:38:23,124 --> 00:38:24,991
Do you take me
for a fool?

396
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:26,860
I take you
for a King.

397
00:38:26,894 --> 00:38:30,097
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

398
00:38:30,131 --> 00:38:32,499
My apologies if
I've given offense.

399
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:34,902
I know how to play
a man like Drogo.

400
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:37,838
I give him a Queen
and he gives me an army.

401
00:38:37,873 --> 00:38:40,742
I don't want
to be his Queen.

402
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,217
I want to go home.

403
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,585
So do I.

404
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,755
I want us both
to go home,

405
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,090
but they took it from us.

406
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,892
So tell me, sweet sister,

407
00:38:56,927 --> 00:38:59,128
how do we go home?

408
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,531
I don't know.

409
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:05,568
We go home with an army.

410
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:10,406
With Khal Drogo's army.

411
00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:13,443
I would let
his whole tribe fuck you--

412
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:16,680
all 40,000 men
and their horses too

413
00:39:16,714 --> 00:39:18,582
if that's what it took.

414
00:39:25,056 --> 00:39:27,290
( Kisses )

415
00:39:35,698 --> 00:39:38,133
Do you think Joffrey
will like me?

416
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,702
What if he thinks
I'm ugly?

417
00:39:40,737 --> 00:39:44,407
Then he is the stupidest prince
that ever lived.

418
00:39:46,743 --> 00:39:49,311
He's so handsome.

419
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:52,047
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

420
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:55,184
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

421
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:57,052
Why would he say no?

422
00:39:57,087 --> 00:40:00,356
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

423
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,958
He'd have to leave home.

424
00:40:02,993 --> 00:40:05,928
He'd have to leave me.

425
00:40:05,962 --> 00:40:08,965
And so would you.

426
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:11,600
You left your home
to come here.

427
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:14,436
And I'd be Queen someday.

428
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:17,073
Please make father
say yes!

429
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:18,974
- Sansa--
- Please please!

430
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:21,944
It's the only thing

Didn't want to leave you
alone with the Lannisters.

Why aren't you
at the feast?

441

Lady Stark thought
it might insult the royal family

442
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,241
to seat a bastard
in their midst.

Never forget

will not.

Wear it like armor

and it can never
be used to hurt you.

What the hell do you know about
being a bastard?

You at a feast--
it's like a bear in a trap.

481

The boy I beheaded--

- did you know him?
- Of course I did.

483
00:44:00,399 --> 00:44:02,501
Just a lad.

484
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:04,269
And he was tough, Ned,

485
00:44:04,303 --> 00:44:06,071
a true ranger.

486
00:44:06,105 --> 00:44:09,575
Pfft.
He was talking madness.

487
00:44:10,744 --> 00:44:12,979
Said the Walkers
slaughtered his friends.

488
00:44:13,013 --> 00:44:15,581
The two he was with
are still missing.

489
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,419
Hmph.
A wildling ambush.

490
00:44:20,453 --> 00:44:22,087
Maybe.

491
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:25,657
Direwolves
south of the wall,

talk of The Walkers,

493
00:44:28,227 --> 00:44:30,829
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

494

Winter <i>is</i> coming.

- Robb boy.

- How are you?
- I'm good.

500
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:49,580
Is this your first time
in the north, your Grace?

501
00:44:49,615 --> 00:44:52,751
Yes.
Lovely country.

502
00:44:56,457 --> 00:44:59,859
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

503
00:45:01,129 --> 00:45:03,230
I remember how scared I was
when Ned brought me

504
00:45:03,264 --> 00:45:05,499
up here
for the first time.

505
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:09,369
Hello, little dove.

506
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:12,739
But you are a beauty.

507
00:45:12,773 --> 00:45:14,874
- How old are you?
- 13, your Grace.

508
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:17,643
You're tall.
Still growing?

509
00:45:17,678 --> 00:45:19,578
I think so, your Grace.

510
00:45:19,613 --> 00:45:21,847
And have you bled yet?

511
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:28,419
No, your Grace.

512
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:31,957
Your dress,
did you make it?

513
00:45:33,259 --> 00:45:36,595
Such a talent.
You must make something for me.

514
00:45:38,365 --> 00:45:41,467
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

515
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:43,737
I hear the same.

516
00:45:43,771 --> 00:45:45,839
Your daughter will
do well in the capital.

517
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:49,577
Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden
up here forever.

518
00:46:05,661 --> 00:46:08,964
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

519
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:10,665
- I hope it's true.
- Yes,

520
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,567
the King has honored me
with his offer.

521
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:14,102
I'm sure we'll have
a tournament

522
00:46:14,137 --> 00:46:16,104
to celebrate your new title--
if you accept.

523
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:18,341
It would be good
to have you on the field.

524
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,543
The competition
has become a bit stale.

525
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:23,313
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

526
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,848
Getting
a little old for it?

527
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:28,519
( Chuckles )
I don't fight
in tournaments

528
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:31,054
because when I fight
a man for real

529
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:33,323
I don't want him to know
what I can do.

530
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,959
Well said.

I belong here with you,

I <i>won't</i> let him

The king

( Huffs )
That's why he's King.

He belongs to me now."

How did he get so fat?

00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:42,623
He only stops eating

Pardon, my Lord,

from your sister.

556
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,521

( Door closes )

558
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,762
What's she doing
at the Eyrie?

559
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:22,431
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

560
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,909
What news?

561
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,014
<i>She's fled</i>
<i>the capital.</i>

562
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,819
She says Jon Arryn
was murdered.

563
00:48:41,854 --> 00:48:43,822
By the Lannisters.

564
00:48:43,856 --> 00:48:46,625
She says the King
is in danger.

565
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:48,928
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

566
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:50,963
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

567
00:48:50,997 --> 00:48:53,499
Lysa's head would be
on a spike right now

568
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:55,701
if the wrong people
had found that letter.

569
00:48:55,735 --> 00:48:58,437
Do you think she would
risk her life--

570
00:48:58,471 --> 00:49:00,105
her son's life--

571
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:03,609
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

572
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:12,652
If this news is true

573
00:49:12,686 --> 00:49:15,689
and the Lannisters
conspire against the throne,

574
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:19,025
who but you can
protect the King?

575
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,261
They murdered
the last Hand.

576
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:23,664
Now you want Ned
to take the job?

577
00:49:23,698 --> 00:49:25,532
The King rode
for a month

578
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:27,601
to ask for
Lord Stark's help.

579

He's the only one
he trusts.

580
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:34,876
You swore the King
an oath, my Lord.

581
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:38,011
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

582
00:49:38,046 --> 00:49:40,547
He owes him nothing.

583
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:45,485
Your father and brother
rode south once

on a King's demand.

585
