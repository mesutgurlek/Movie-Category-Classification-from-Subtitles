He was a model of health and vigor.

He just dropped dead in his study

or the Orkney Islands to dig another.

63
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,418
He said it was pure research,

64
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:01,964
but it always seemed to me
like he was looking for something.

00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,136
Oh, and God grant me

He never offered an explanation,
I never asked him for one.

87
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,711
It was his private journal.

88

He was most explicit that you,

89

The eastern border is a wasteland.

<i>Sab Than has burned
through our defenses,</i>

Forgive me, my lady,
but you have not seen this weapon.

345

It radiates the most intense, baleful

Somehow that idiotic brute
had discovered it first.

349

Discovered what?

350
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,476
The Ninth Ray.

But think of what Helium might
accomplish with such power.

You can't just bow down to Zodanga!

376
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:16,000

You must find another way!

382
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,553
There is no other way!

383

If there were,
I would risk anything to seize it.

This is the chance we have been given.

385
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:56,332
Perhaps it is the will of the Goddess.

No.

So, when I was little,
and we would look up at the stars

389

and you would tell me of the heroes

how there was a star up there for me,

would be written on it?

No. Not like that.

639
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:49,668
Go on, shock me.

640
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:50,919
How?

641
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:55,799
That brought me here.

642
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:05,809
Oh.

00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:09,145
Well, that explains everything, then.

644
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:13,066
- It does?
- Yes.

645
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:14,359
You're a Thern

646

and you simply
wish to return to your rightful place.

Isn't that it?

Yes.

No, she is Issus.

Your right arms were planning
to rob you of the medallion

and use it to commit greater blasphemy
down the River Iss.

Her mother kept her egg

and Sola's the last flicker
of her ancient greatness.

Leave a Thark his head and one hand
and he may yet conquer.

743
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:43,980
Is it done, my Jeddak?

744

A princess who didn't want
to get married, so she ran away.

799
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:08,035
No.

800
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:10,871
Is that all there is to the story?

801
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:13,833
No, I didn't run away!

802
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:17,253
- I escaped!
- From what, his breath?

803
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:19,547
So marry the guy and save your people.

804
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,216
A life of oppression! That's not living!

805
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:34,478
If you had the means to save others,

806
01:03:34,562 --> 01:03:37,231
would you not take
any action possible to make it so?

807
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:41,027
No good will come
out of me fighting your war.

808
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:45,740
I would lay down my life for Helium.

809
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:53,247
Yes, I ran away.

810
01:03:53,706 --> 01:03:55,708
I was afraid,

811
01:03:56,709 --> 01:03:58,085
weak.

812
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:02,923
Maybe I should have married.

813
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:10,765
But I so feared that it would somehow
be the end of Barsoom.

814
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:18,064
I tell you truly, John Carter of Earth,

815
01:04:19,732 --> 01:04:21,609
there are no Gates of Iss.

816
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,903
They are not real.

817
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:33,287
I'm sorry, Princess.

818
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:39,126
But this, this is real.

819
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:45,466
And so is my cave of gold.

820
01:04:57,645 --> 01:04:59,688
Prudence demands you take an escort.

821
01:04:59,772 --> 01:05:01,065
No.

822
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:03,150
I go alone, General.

823
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:05,569
But, Jeddak...

824
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:08,948
In one sweep, I can
put an end to 1,000 years of civil war

825
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:11,158
and bring Helium to its knees forever.

826
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:16,372
But my general, in his superior wisdom,
objects. Is that right?

827
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:22,711

I'm a copy of myself.

Possibly, making these words
here the command for travel.

I don't like guessing.

909
01:12:57,791 --> 01:13:00,836
I need more information.
I need charts, codices.

01:13:03,589 --> 01:13:05,591
And where might we find those?

912

In the Hall of Science.

913
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,181
And where's that?

914

915
01:13:15,642 --> 01:13:19,479
Then quick, let's just head on
and turn on back to Helium.

916
01:13:19,855 --> 01:13:20,981
What do you take me for?

917
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:23,400
I take you for a man who's lost.

918

I won't be lost if you just tell me
how to work this thing!

I will!

920

But everything I need to understand
that medallion is in Helium.

921

From the moment
you caught me in the sky, I knew.

I felt the heart of a man

1428
01:58:23,347 --> 01:58:26,183
<i>So for ten bitter years, I searched.</i>

1429
01:58:26,350 --> 01:58:28,019
<i>On the trail of rumor and legend</i>

1430
01:58:28,102 --> 01:58:31,105
<i>I ferreted out every possible
evidence of the Therns,</i>

1431
01:58:31,188 --> 01:58:33,065
<i>but I found no medallion.</i>

1432
01:58:35,234 --> 01:58:38,237

01:59:14,565 --> 01:59:16,567
Sir.

1441
01:59:16,692 --> 01:59:18,903
I feel remarkably unwell, Thompson.

1442
01:59:19,904 --> 01:59:23,074
- Please send for the doctor.
- Yes, sir.

1443
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:25,242
And, Thompson...

1444
01:59:26,243 --> 01:59:28,204
My attorney as well.

1445
01:59:29,955 --> 01:59:31,582
Of course, sir.

1446
01:59:37,588 --> 01:59:40,591
<i>Now you will understand
the cause of my sudden death.</i>

1447

<i>The reason

1448
01:59:52,812 --> 01:59:56,482
<i>Why the door can only be opened

Dear Ned.

1463
02:00:53,831 --> 02:00:55,833
You sneaky devil!

You never called me Edgar!
You... You called me Ned!

Hello, Ned.

1467
02:01:27,072 --> 02:01:30,075
Toxin. Derived from the puffer fish.

Simulates death.

1469
02:01:38,042 --> 02:01:40,002
You never found the medallion.

1470
02:01:40,085 --> 02:01:41,378
No.

1471
02:01:42,713 --> 02:01:45,800
That's why I'm so grateful
to you for bringing me one.

1472
02:01:47,384 --> 02:01:50,888
I... I was just bait?

1473
02:01:51,055 --> 02:01:54,391
No. You're far more than that.

1474
02:01:54,725 --> 02:01:56,852
I really do need a protector.

1475
02:01:58,896 --> 02:02:01,065
That is, if you're willing.

1476
02:02:09,782 --> 02:02:11,200
Goodbye, Ned.

1477
02:02:15,746 --> 02:02:17,873
Oh, and, Ned...

1478
02:02:18,916 --> 02:02:20,501
Take up a cause.

1479
02:02:20,584 --> 02:02:22,545
Fall in love.

1480
02:02:22,628 --> 02:02:24,255
Write a book.

1481
02:02:26,257 --> 02:02:28,300
It's time I went home.

1482
