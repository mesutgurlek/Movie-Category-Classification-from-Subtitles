The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

166
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,565
EATON: Just what does
that mean to you, uh, Tanis?

167
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,691
Well, it...

168
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,194
The city of Tanis is one of the possible
resting places of the Lost Ark.

169
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,946
The Lost Ark?

170
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,280
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.

171
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,532
The chest the Hebrews used

172
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,950
to carry around
the Ten Commandments.

173
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,117
What do you mean,
"commandments"?

174
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,702
You talking
about the Ten Commandments?

175
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,871
Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.

176
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,456
The original stone tablets

177
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,500
that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,

178
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,627
if you believe
in that sort of thing.

179
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,588
Any of you guys
ever go to Sunday school?

180
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,674
- Well, I...
- Oh, look.

181
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,342
The Hebrews took
the broken pieces

182
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,803
and put them in the Ark.
When they settled in Canaan,

183
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,514
they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.

184
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,640
In Jerusalem.

185
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,225
Where it stayed for many years.

186
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,394
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

187
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,645
Where?

188
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,605
Well, nobody knows
where or when.

189
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,566
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

190
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,650
- Shishak.
- Yes.

191
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,486
...invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

192
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,531
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis

193
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,533
and hidden it
in a secret chamber

194
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,867
called the Well of Souls.

195
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,536
Secret chamber?

196
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,246
BRODY: However, about a year

197
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,498
after the pharaoh
would return to Egypt,

198
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,835
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert

199
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,005
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

200
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,340
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

201
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,094
Uh-huh.

202
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,887
Obviously, we've come
to the right men.

203
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,514
Now you seem to know, uh,

204
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,849
all about this Tanis, then.

205
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,350
No, no, not really.

206
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,853
Ravenwood is the real expert.

207
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,938
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.

208
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,566
Collected some of its relics.

209
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,444
It was his obsession, really.

210
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,862
But he never found the city.

211
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,282
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

212
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,034
An American being mentioned
so prominently

213
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,286
in a secret Nazi cable.

214
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,705
Oh, rubbish.
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

215
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,540
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

216
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,084
Well, obviously,
the Nazis are looking

217
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,961
for the headpiece
to the Staff of Ra

218
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,255
and they think Abner's got it.

219
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,008
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

220
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,593
Well, the staff
is just a stick...

221
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,927
I don't know, about this big,

222
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,763
nobody really knows
for sure how high...

223
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,849
And it's... it's, uh...
it's capped

224
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,435
with an elaborate headpiece...

225
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,480
in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

226
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,148
And what you did was

227
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,984
you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis...

228
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,402
A map room with a miniature

229
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,904
of the city all laid out
on the floor,

230
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,989
and if you put the staff
in a certain place,

231
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,950
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here

232
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,788
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...

233
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,791
and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

234
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,293
Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?

235
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,629
Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.

236
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,964
What does this Ark look like?

237
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,383
Uh...

238
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,760
INDY: There's a picture of it
right here.

239
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,266
That's it.

240
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,108
EATON: Good God.

241
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,735
Yes, that's just
what the Hebrews thought.

242
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,195
Uh...

243
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,739
now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

244
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,491
INDY: Lightning...

245
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,535
fire...

246
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,787
power of God or something.

247
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,665
EATON: I'm beginning to understand

248
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,166
Hitler's interest in this.

249
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,626
BRODY: Oh, yes.

250
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,878
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,

251
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,465
and laying waste
to entire regions.

252
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,428
An army which carries
the Ark before it...

253
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,971
is invincible.

254
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,535
You did it, didn't you?

255
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,245
They want you to go for it.

(LAUGHING) Oh, Marcus!

257
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,542
They want you to get a hold of
the Ark before the Nazis do

258
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,794
and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

259
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,045
And the museum?

260
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,380
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

261
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,840
Oh, yes.

262
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,386
Oh...

263
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,513
The Ark of the Covenant.

264
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,266
Nothing else has come close.

265
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,559
That thing represents everything

266
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,062
we got into archeology
for in the first place.

270
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,947

271
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,699
I think I know where to start.

272
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,790

still be with him?

273
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,792
