1
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:09,150
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

2
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:11,984
Money, money, money!
Hey!

3
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,769
You got a date with justice, One-Eyed Bart.
- Too bad, Sheriff.

4
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,053
I'm a married man.

5
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:28,297
One-Eyed Betty!

6
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:45,193
I think you dropped something, mister.

7
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:48,598
Jessie?
- Give it up, Bart.
You've reached the end of the line.

8
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,787
I always wanted to go out with a bang.

9
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:03,132
Oh no!
- The orphans!

10
00:02:03,964 --> 00:02:07,376
Hate to leave early, but our ride is here.

11
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:15,264
It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff.
Take your pick.

12
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:21,227
Ride like the wind, Bull's-eye!

13
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:29,719
Hold 'em steady.

14
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:35,617
Woody, hurry!

15
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,552
No ...

16
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:10,403
Glad I can catch the train.
- Now let's catch some criminals.

17
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:13,416
To infinity and beyond.

18
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:32,528
Reach for the sky.
- You can't touch me, Sheriff.

19
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:36,118
I brought my attack dog
with a built-in force field.

20
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:47,797
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force fields dogs.

21
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,298
Evil Doctor Pork Chop.

22
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:14,305
That’s Mr. Evil Doctor Pork Chop to you.

23
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:59,287
Buzz, shoot your laser on my badge.
- Woody, no, I'll kill you.

24
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:01,639
Just do it.

25
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:07,428
You're going to jail, Bart. Ah, watch out!

26
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:13,163
Mom!
- No, no, no. Just keep playing.
Just pretend I’m not here.

27
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:16,054
Oh, no, Molly!
- No, it's ok, Mom.

28
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:18,774
It's a 50 foot baby from outer space.

29
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:22,410
And she's on a rampage!
Run for your lives!

30
00:05:23,474 --> 00:05:26,135
Does the red light mean it's going?

31
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:28,820
Come on say "Happy Birthday" to Molly.

32
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:32,558
Happy birthday.
- Oh. Charming.

33
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,194
Look how tall you're getting.

34
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:52,725
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

35
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,977
Good work, Buzz.

36
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:25,914
Ok places, everyone. Come on, come on.
Get in position.
- Wait, I can't find my other eye.

37
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:28,759
All right, whose foot's in my face?
- It's mine, give it back.

38
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,383
You saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

39
00:06:31,676 --> 00:06:33,789
Buzz, mind if I squeeze in next to you?

40
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,383
Yes. No.  I mean, why would I mind if
I squeeze .. squeeze in next to .. you?

41
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,815
Is it hot in here?
- Oh, here they come.

42
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:48,900
Sarge, you got it?
- Mission accomplished.
- Hooray!

43
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:52,280
Careful. Careful.

44
00:06:54,512 --> 00:06:56,687
All right guys. We've got one shot at this.

45
00:06:56,688 --> 00:06:59,351
Everybody ready?
- We're ready, Woody. Let's do it.

46
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,680
Ok Buzz, make the call.

47
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:19,302
Target is on approach.
- Just like we rehearsed it guys.

48
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,720
Hello. Hello.
Anyone there?

49
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:43,885
Molly, stay out of my room.
- I wasn't in your room.

50
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:48,704
Then who was messing with my stuff?
- It wasn't me.

51
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:59,783
Well, that went well.
- He held me! He actually held me!

52
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:06,694
Uh, this is just sad.
- Who we kidding? The kid's 17 years old.
- We ain't ever getting played with.

53
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:14,534
Guys, hey, hold up. We need a staff meeting.
Everyone, a staff meeting.

54
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,803
Oh, not again.
- Oh come on. Sling, gather everyone up.

55
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:20,923
Uh, we are together, Woody.

56
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:26,905
Ok. Uh, first off ... we all knew
"Operation Playtime" was a long shot.

57
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:31,761
More like a misfire.
- But we've always said this job
isn't about getting played with

58
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:34,391
it's about ...
- Being there for Andy.
We know.

59
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:36,756
But we can try again, right?

60
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:40,833
I'm calling it guys. We're closing up shop.
- What?

61
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,771
Andy's going to college anyday now.

62
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:45,975
That was our last shot.

63
00:08:45,976 --> 00:08:49,528
We're going into attic mode folks.
Keep your accessories with you at all times.

64
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,837
Spare parts, batteries ...
Anything you need for an orderly transition.

65
00:08:52,937 --> 00:08:56,610
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished. Over the hill.

66
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:59,463
Hey, hey, hey. Come on guys. We all
knew this day was coming.

67
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:04,443
Yeah, but now it's here.
- Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see ...

68
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:07,027
Hey Sarge! What are you doing?
- War's over folks.

69
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:10,135
Me and the boys are moving on.

70
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:12,452
Moving on?
- You're going AWOL?
- We've done our duty.

71
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:14,719
Andy is grown up.
- Let's face it ...

72
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,066
When the trash bags come out,
we army guys are the first to go.

73
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:20,631
Trash bags?
- Who said anything about trash bags?

74
00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:24,657
It has been an honor serving with you.
Good luck folks.

75
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:29,484
You're gonna need it.
- No, no, wait, wait, wait.

76
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,512
We're getting thrown away?
- No. No one's getting thrown away.

77
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:34,732
How do you know?
- We're being abandoned.

78
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,844
We'll be fine, Jessie.
- So why did Sarge leave?

79
00:09:36,845 --> 00:09:39,419
Should we leave?
- I thought we were going to the attic?

80
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,311
Oh I hate all this uncertainty.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on a minute. Quiet!

81
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:45,697
No one's getting thrown out, ok?

82
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:50,965
We're all still here. I mean, yeah,
we've lost friends along the way ...

83
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:54,351
Wheezy and Etch and ...
- Bo Peep.

84
00:09:56,107 --> 00:09:59,237
Yeah, even, even Bo.

85
00:09:59,238 --> 00:10:02,057
All good toys who've gone
on to new owners.

86
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:04,727
But through every yard sale,
every spring cleaning ...

87
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:06,651
Andy held onto us.

88
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:09,887
He must care about us
or we wouldn't be here.

89
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:14,419
You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in
the attic. It'll be safe and warm.

90
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,863
And we'll all be together.
- Exactly.

91
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:19,551
There's games up there and books and ...
- The racecar track.

92
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,723
The racecar track, thank you.
- And the old TV.

93
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:28,129
There you go, the old TV. And those
guys from the Christmas decorations.

94
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,700
Well, they're fun, right?

95
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:34,699
And some day, if we're lucky, Andy
may have kids of his own.

96
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,551
And he'll play with us then, right?

97
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:40,514
We'll always be there for him.
- Come on guys ...

98
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:44,324
Let's get our parts together, get ready
and go out on a high note.

99
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:48,341
I'd better find my other eye.
- Where'd you leave it this time?

100
00:10:48,342 --> 00:10:52,166
Some place dark and dusty.

101
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:55,151
Come on. Let's see how much
we're going for on eBay.

102
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:58,923
Don't worry, Andy's going to take
care of us. I guarantee it.

103
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,720
You guarantee it, huh?
- I don't know, Buzz.

104
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:31,056
What else could I say?

105
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,314
Well, whatever happens, at least
we'll all be together.

106
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:36,750
For infinity and beyond.

107
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:40,645
Can I have your stereo?
- No.
- Why not?

108
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:48,852
Can I have your computer?
- No.

109
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:51,158
Your video games?
- Forget it, Molly.

110
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,618
Ok Andy, let's get to work here.
Anything you're not taking to college ...

111
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:56,835
either goes to the attic, or it's trash.

112
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:59,892
Mom, I'm not leaving til Friday.
- Come on, it's garbage day.

113
00:12:00,214 --> 00:12:03,709
Mom!
- Look, it's simple.
Skateboard: college.

114
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:05,922
Little League trophy: probably attic.

115
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:07,998
Apple core: trash.

116
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:11,394
You can do the rest.
- Why do you still have these toys?

117
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:15,977
Molly, out of my room!
- Three more days and it's mine.

118
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:19,856
Molly! You're not off the hook either.
You have more toys than
you know what to do with.

119
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:21,892
Some of them can make other
kids really happy.

120
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:24,465
What kids?
- The children at the daycare.

121
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:27,508
They're always asking for donations.
- What's daycare?
- Sh Sh Sh.

122
00:12:27,568 --> 00:12:31,484
Mom!
- No buts. You choose the toys
you want to donate, I'll drop
them off at Sunnyside.

123
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,704
Poor Barbie.
- I get the Corvette.

124
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:48,608
Andy, come on. You need to start
making decisions.

125
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:51,383
Like what?
- Like, what are you going
to do with these toys?

126
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:55,079
Should we donate them to Sunnyside?
- No!
- Maybe sell them online?

127
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,324
Mom, no one's going to want those old toys.

128
00:12:57,325 --> 00:13:00,903
They're junk.
- Fine. You have til Friday.

129
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:03,648
Anything that's not packed for
college or in the attic ...

130
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,996
is getting thrown out.
- Whatever you say, Mom.

131
00:13:58,575 --> 00:14:02,042
What's happening?
- We're getting thrown out, you idiot!
That's what's happening!

132
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,632
You need a hand?
- I got it.

133
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:21,853
Here. So you gonna miss me when I'm gone?

134
00:14:21,854 --> 00:14:24,172
If I say "no", will I still get your room?

135
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:26,668
No.
- Then, yes, I'll miss you.

136
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:29,402
I can't breathe.
- This can't be happening.

137
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:31,571
Quiet! What's that sound?

138
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:43,576
Andy!

139
00:14:45,454 --> 00:14:47,883
That's not trash.
That's not trash!

140
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:50,054
Think, Woody. Think, think, think.

141
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:52,962
Buster, come here boy. Come here.

142
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,955
Ok boy, to the curb.
Heeyah!

143
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,396
No, Buster! No!

144
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:11,514
Get up, Buster.

145
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:29,607
We're on the curb!
- Oh, I knew it come to this.

146
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:32,058
Pull everyone! Pull!

147
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:43,116
It won't rip!

148
00:15:43,117 --> 00:15:46,377
Oh for goodness ... It's triple-ply,
high-density polyethylene.

149
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,511
There's gotta be a way out.
- Oh Andy doesn't want us.
What's the point?

150
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:51,364
Point, point, point!

151
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:57,876
Push! Push!
- I can hear the garbage truck!

152
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:01,296
It's getting closer.

153
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:40,685
Buzz! Jessie!

154
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:52,178
Andy threw us out.
- Like we were garbage.
- Junk. He called us junk.

155
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,439
How could he?

156
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,247
This doesn't make any sense.
- I should have seen this coming.

157
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:01,110
It's Emily all over again.
- The Sarge was right.

158
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:04,966
Yeah and Woody was wrong.
- Wait a minute. Hold on.
This is no time to be hysterical.

159
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:08,346
It's the perfect time to be hysterical.
- Should we be hysterical?

160
00:17:08,347 --> 00:17:10,831
No. Yes.
- Maybe, but not now.

161
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,090
Yee haw! Fellas, I know what to do.

162
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:23,825
What the heck?

163
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:27,417
Oh, we should have done this years ago.
- Jessie wait. What about Woody?

164
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:30,265
He's fine, Buzz. Andy's taking him to college.

165
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,706
Now, we need to go.

166
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:35,700
You're right. Come on.

167
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:40,736
Buzz?
- Woody.
- What's going on? Don't you know
this box is being donated?

168
00:17:40,737 --> 00:17:44,065
It's under control, Woody. We have a plan.
- We're going to daycare.

169
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:46,734
Daycare! What, have you all lost your marbles?

170
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:52,167
Well didn't you see? Andy threw us away.
- No, no, no. He was putting you in the attic.

171
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:54,998
Attic? So how did we end up on the curb?
- That was a mistake.

172
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:59,194
Andy's mom thought you were trash.
- Yeah, after he put us in a trash bag.

173
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:03,933
And called us junk!
- Yeah, I know it looks bad.
But guys, you gotta believe me.

174
00:18:03,934 --> 00:18:08,119
Sure thing, college boy.
- Andy's moving on, Woody.

175
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,583
It's time we do the same.

176
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:13,773
Ok, out of the box.
Everyone, right now!

177
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,926
Come on Buzz, give me a hand.
We gotta get this thing.
- Woody, Woody.

178
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:19,004
We need to figure out what's best for everyone.

179
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:28,407
Oh great, great. It'll take us
forever to get back here.

180
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,565
Oh it's all right, Barbie.
You'll be ok.

181
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:44,051
Molly and I have been growing
apart for years.

182
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:48,859
It's just .. I can't believe she
would throw me away!

183
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,973
Welcome to the club, Toots.
- Ok, everyone listen up ...

184
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:54,267
We can get back to Andy's
but we gotta move fast.

185
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:58,193
We'll hide under the seats
til we get back home.
- Get it through your
vinyl noggin Woody ...

186
00:18:58,194 --> 00:19:01,790
Andy doesn't want us anymore.
- He was putting you in the attic!

187
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:05,095
He left us on the curb!
- All right, calm down, both of you!

188
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:09,295
Ok. Fine, fine. Just wait until you
see what daycare's like.
- Why? What’s it like?

189
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:14,181
Daycare is a sad, lonely place for
washed up old toys who have no owners.

190
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:21,628
Quite the charmer, aren’t you?
- Oh, you'll see, as soon as we get to daycare

191
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:24,151
you'll be begging to go home.

192
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:41,829
Can anyone see anything?
- There's a playground.
- Wow!

193
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,089
We hit the jackpot, Bull's-eye.
- So much for sad and lonely, huh?

194
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,488
Ok calm, down guys.
Let's keep this in perspective.

195
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:52,009
Perspective? This place is perfect.
- Woody, it's nice.

196
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,704
See? The door has a rainbow on it.

197
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:02,002
Hey, there.
- Wow. I haven't seen you in ages.

198
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:06,071
I just wanted to drop these old toys off.
- Is this Bonnie?

199
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:09,451
Look how big you are.
- Say hi, Sweetie.

200
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:11,998
Hi.
- Hey, how are your kids?

201
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:16,308
Molly and Andy?
- Not kids anymore.
Andy's going to college on Friday.
- What?

202
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:19,076
Can you believe it?
- You sure they won't miss these?

203
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:21,298
No, they never get played with.

204
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:26,627
Do you see any kids?
- Where's she taking us?

205
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,947
Look.
- Wow.
- What? What is it?

206
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:48,566
I can't see.

207
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:51,662
Ok, everyone recess. Come on.

208
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:58,321
So now what do we do?
- We go back to Andy's.

209
00:20:58,322 --> 00:21:00,331
Anyone see an exit?
- Exit, schmexit.

210
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:03,996
Let's get played with.
- Careful these toys might
be jealous of new arrivals.

211
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:06,977
I want to see.
- It's my turn.

212
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:14,591
New toys!

213
00:21:20,132 --> 00:21:23,743
Howdy, glad to meet you.
- Buzz Lightyear at your service.

214
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:32,592
Oh, thank you.
May I? Oooh.

215
00:21:35,678 --> 00:21:38,017
The Claw.

216
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,116
Well, hello there.

217
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:50,490
I thought I heard new voices.
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.

218
00:21:50,491 --> 00:21:54,935
I'm Lotso, hugging bear.
But please call me Lotso.

219
00:21:54,936 --> 00:21:57,188
Buzz Lightyear. We come in ...

220
00:21:57,843 --> 00:22:01,063
First thing you gotta know about me,
I'm a hugger.

221
00:22:01,664 --> 00:22:04,972
Oh, look at you all. You been
through a lot today haven't you?

222
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:08,085
Oh, it's been horrible.
- Well, you're safe now.

223
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:11,844
We're all cast-offs here.
We've been dumped, donated ...

224
00:22:11,845 --> 00:22:15,513
yard sales, second-handed
and just plain thrown out.

225
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:20,553
But just you wait, you'll find being donated
was the best thing to ever happen to you.

226
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:25,065
Mr. Lotso, do toys here
get played with everyday?

227
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:27,489
All day long. Five days a week.

228
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:31,279
But what happens when the kids grow up?
- Well now, I'll tell you.

229
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,396
When the kids get old, new ones come in.

230
00:22:34,397 --> 00:22:37,406
When they get old, new ones replace them.

231
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:41,519
You'll never be out-grown or neglected,
never abandoned ...

232
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,366
or forgotten.
No owners means no heartbreak.

233
00:22:46,507 --> 00:22:51,637
Yee haw!
- It's a miracle!
- And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.

234
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:56,112
Because we're Andy's toys!
- So you got donated by this Andy, huh?

235
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:59,534
Well, it's his loss, Sheriff.
He can't hurt you no more.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

236
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:03,730
Now let's get you all settled in.
Ken? Where is that boy? Ken!

237
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:07,859
New toys.
- Far out. Down in a jiff, Lotso.

238
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:13,791
So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?

239
00:23:13,886 --> 00:23:18,697
Let's show our new friends
where they'll be staying.
- Now folks, if you wanna
step right this way ...

240
00:23:28,611 --> 00:23:30,634
Hi. I'm Ken.
- Barbie.

241
00:23:30,635 --> 00:23:34,752
Have we ever met?
- Uh uh. I would have remembered.

242
00:23:34,753 --> 00:23:38,435
Love your legwarmers.
- Nice ascot.

243
00:23:38,436 --> 00:23:43,653
Come on, Ken. Recess don't last forever.
- Right on, Lotso. This way, everybody.

244
00:23:43,848 --> 00:23:49,741
You got a lot to look forward to, folks.
The little ones love new toys.

245
00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:52,947
What a nice bear.
- And he smells like strawberries.

246
00:23:54,963 --> 00:24:00,508
Folks, if I could share ... Here at
Sunnyside we've got just about
anything a toy could ask for ...

247
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:05,509
Spare parts, super glue and enough fresh
batteries to choke a hungry, hungry hippo.

248
00:24:05,973 --> 00:24:09,206
Think you're getting old?
Well, stop your worrying.

249
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:12,897
Our repair spot will keep you stuffed,
puffed and lighted up.

250
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:18,237
And this ... Well, this is where I live.
Ken's dream house.

251
00:24:18,238 --> 00:24:23,375
It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy and
a whole room just for trying on clothes.

252
00:24:23,376 --> 00:24:29,948
You have everything.
- Everything, except
someone to share it with.

253
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,310
You need anything at all,
you just come talk to me.

254
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:36,246
Here we are.

255
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:43,680
Well, thank you, Big Baby. Why don't
you come meet our new friends?

256
00:24:43,903 --> 00:24:47,784
Poor baby. We were thrown out
together - me and him.

257
00:24:47,785 --> 00:24:53,097
Abandoned by the same owner.
But we don't need all
this at Sunnyside ...

258
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:56,336
We own ourselves.
We're masters of our own fate.

259
00:24:56,337 --> 00:24:58,960
We control our own destiny.

260
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:01,310
Oh, watch out for puddles.

261
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:04,010
Here's where you folks will be staying.

262
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:06,652
The Caterpillar Room.

263
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,773
Look at this place!
- Wow!

264
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:13,486
Holy moley guacamole!
- Jackpot, baby!

265
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,614
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.

266
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:19,741
It's so beautiful!

267
00:25:20,974 --> 00:25:22,661
Huh? What the ... ?

268
00:25:22,992 --> 00:25:24,563
Oh, hey, little guy.

269
00:25:24,864 --> 00:25:27,992
How long's it been since you all
got played with?

270
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:31,176
It's been years.
- Well, just you wait ...

271
00:25:31,177 --> 00:25:36,006
in a few minutes, that bell's gonna
ring and you'll get the playtime
that you've been dreaming of.

272
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:39,340
Play. Real play. I can't wait!

273
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:41,898
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we best be heading back.

274
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:46,522
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
- Thank you. Bye.

275
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:49,601
Will I see you again?
- Oh, I'll see you tonight ...

276
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:54,202
In my dreams.
- Ken, let's get a move on.

277
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:57,130
Barbie, come with me.
Live in my dream house.

278
00:25:57,131 --> 00:26:00,446
I know it's crazy. I know we just met.
Ah heck, you don't know me from GI Joe ...

279
00:26:00,447 --> 00:26:04,496
but when I look at you,
I feel like we were ...
- Made for each other?

280
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:09,774
Yay!
- Yes!
- Ken?
- Coming, Lotso!

281
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:14,141
It's so exciting!

282
00:26:20,006 --> 00:26:22,992
Sounds like kids to me.
- Oh, I want to get played with.

283
00:26:22,993 --> 00:26:28,636
Why can't time go faster?
- How many are there out there?
- Oh, they sound so sweet!

284
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:38,304
Look everyone, it's nice here, I admit.

285
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:43,106
But we need to go home.
- We could have a whole new life here, Woody.

286
00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:47,339
A chance to make kids happy again.
- Why don't you stay?

287
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,748
Yeah, Woody stay with us.
- Come on, Woodster.

288
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:53,478
You'll get played with.
- I can't. No. No.
Guys, really, no!

289
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:58,060
I have a kid. You have a kid - Andy.

290
00:26:58,061 --> 00:27:01,660
And if he wants us at college
or in the attic ...

291
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,344
Well, our job is to be there for him.

292
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:08,316
Now I'm going home.
Anyone who wants to join me is welcome.

293
00:27:08,317 --> 00:27:14,602
Come on, Buzz.
Buzz?

294
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:21,154
Our mission with Andy is complete, Woody.

295
00:27:21,155 --> 00:27:24,574
What?
- What's important now is that we stay together.

296
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:27,422
We wouldn't even be together
if it weren't for Andy!

297
00:27:27,423 --> 00:27:31,589
Look under your boot, Buzz. You too, Jessie.
Whose name is written there?

298
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:38,519
Maybe Andy doesn't care about us anymore.
- Of course he does. He cares about all of you.

299
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,336
He was putting you in the attic. I saw ...
You can't just turn your back on him now!

300
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:44,810
Woody, wake up! It's over!

301
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:47,299
Andy is all grown up.

302
00:27:47,914 --> 00:27:54,574
Ok. Fine. Perfect.
I can't believe how selfish you all are.

303
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:06,207
So this is it?
After all we've been through ...

304
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:24,987
Bull's-eye, no.
You need to stay.

305
00:28:27,482 --> 00:28:30,747
Bull's-eye, no. I said stay!

306
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:36,761
Look, I don't want you left alone
in the attic, ok?

307
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:39,293
Now stay.

308
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:45,251
Bonnie?

309
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,135
I ... I gotta go.

310
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,448
Bonnie, you in here?

311
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:16,436
Come on, Come on ...
No, no!

312
00:29:54,436 --> 00:29:57,877
What? What the heck?

313
00:29:59,913 --> 00:30:01,517
Ah, that's better.

314
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:06,185
Bonnie!
Oh, there you are.

315
00:30:06,186 --> 00:30:08,406
Come on, Honey. It's time to go home.

316
00:30:32,281 --> 00:30:33,897
No, no, no, no ...

317
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,107
Reach for the sky.

318
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:22,384
Bluebells, cockleshells, eeny, miney ...

319
00:31:27,926 --> 00:31:31,247
You're my favorite deputy.

320
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:34,064
Bonnie!
- Coming!

321
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:38,932
Oh, great!

322
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,122
Oh, it's gonna be ok, Bull's-eye.
- Woody's going to college with Andy.

323
00:31:54,123 --> 00:31:56,290
It's what he always wanted.
- Ah, he's crazy.

324
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,340
College is no place for a toy.
- Toys are for playtime.

325
00:31:59,341 --> 00:32:02,531
Oh speaking about playtime ...
They're lining up out there!

326
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:04,330
How many?
- There must be dozens.

327
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:07,342
Oh, I can hardly wait!
- Places, everyone.

328
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,508
At last I'm going to get played with.

329
00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:27,593
Uh Rex ...
- Come to Poppa.

330
00:33:20,939 --> 00:33:23,973
There's a snake in my boot.

331
00:33:23,974 --> 00:33:28,321
I'd like to join your posse boys, but
first I'm gonna sing a little song.

332
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:30,311
A sheriff!

333
00:33:31,568 --> 00:33:34,995
Move over, Mr. Prickle Pants.
We have a guest.

334
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:37,015
You want some coffee?

335
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:41,316
It's good for you but don't drink too much
or you'll haveta .. haveta ...

336
00:33:41,317 --> 00:33:44,024
Be right back!

337
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:47,595
Hey. Hello. Hi, excuse me.
- Sh!

338
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,189
Can you tell me where I am?
- Shhh!

339
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:54,976
The guy's just asking you a question.
- Well, excuse me, I'm trying
to stay in character.

340
00:33:55,704 --> 00:33:59,207
My name's Buttercup.
You've met Baron Von Shush.
- Sh!

341
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:01,906
Hello, I'm Trixie.
- Sh!
- Sh!

342
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:06,332
Guys. Hey. Guys, look.
I don't know where I am.
- We're either in a cafe in Paris ...

343
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:09,587
or a coffeshop in New Jersey.
I'm pretty sure I just came back
from the doctor ...

344
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:14,133
with life-changing news.
- We do a lot of improv here. Just
stay loose, have fun. You'll be fine.

345
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:16,032
- No, no, no, no. I ...

346
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:18,021
Who wants lunch?

347
00:34:20,236 --> 00:34:23,390
I have the secret ingredient.
Jelly beans.

348
00:34:24,382 --> 00:34:28,242
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.
- Poisoned?

349
00:34:28,243 --> 00:34:31,258
Who would do such a mean thing?

350
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:37,544
Agh! The scary witch! Look out!

351
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:40,185
She using her witchy powers.

352
00:34:40,186 --> 00:34:41,496
I know where to hide.

353
00:34:44,905 --> 00:34:48,359
She'll never find us in here.

354
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,763
What's wrong?

355
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:54,685
Agh! She found us! We need a spaceship
to get away from the witch!

356
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:57,486
You're doing great.
- Are you classically trained?

357
00:34:57,487 --> 00:35:01,756
Look, I just need to know
how to get out of here.
- There is no way out.

358
00:35:01,757 --> 00:35:06,145
Just kidding. Door's right over there.
- Well, Cowboy. You just jumped
right in, didn't ya?

359
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,527
I'm Dolly.
- Uh, Woody.

360
00:35:07,528 --> 00:35:11,837
Woody. Really? You're gonna stick
with that? Cause now's your chance
to change it. New room and all ...

361
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:14,508
That's coming from a doll named Dolly.

362
00:35:15,421 --> 00:35:18,099
Who's the new guy?
- Are you a real cowboy?

363
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,177
Well, actually ...
- Of course he's not, Pea Brain ...

364
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:22,693
He don't even have a hat.
- I do too have ...

365
00:35:22,694 --> 00:35:24,312
My hat!
- Told you.

366
00:35:24,313 --> 00:35:27,013
I found a spaceship!
- Showtime!

367
00:35:27,014 --> 00:35:31,068
Quick. Get in. Strap in your seatbelts,
close your tray tables.

368
00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:33,860
Hold on, it might get a little bumpy.

369
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:37,214
Three, two, one. Blast off!

370
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:44,490
Yee haw! You saved us, Cowboy!
You're our hero!

371
00:35:53,848 --> 00:35:56,435
I got a kink in my slink.

372
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:00,912
My tail! Where's my tail?

373
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:09,431
Someone need a hand?

374
00:36:09,742 --> 00:36:11,161
Where's my nose?
- Here it is.

375
00:36:11,162 --> 00:36:13,430
Here's your arm.
- Gimme that.
- Honey, the mustache?

376
00:36:13,431 --> 00:36:16,547
I don't recall playtime being
quite that strenuous.

377
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:21,739
Andy never played with us like that.
- We're just gonna have
to make the best of it.

378
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,980
But these toddlers, they don't
know how to play with us.
- They're too young.

379
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:27,918
And they're sticky.
- We should be in the Butterfly Room.

380
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,270
With the big kids.
- That's right.
- You said it.

381
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:34,177
We'll get this straightened out.
I'll go talk to Lotso about
moving us to the other room.

382
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,412
Blast. Try that one.

383
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:43,105
It's locked.
- Same here.

384
00:36:43,106 --> 00:36:44,967
Try the windows.
- Uh negatory.

385
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:48,967
It's a Fenster-Sneckler 380.
Finest child-proof lock in the world.

386
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:52,659
We're trapped!
- Wait. Did anyone notice the transom?

387
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:56,539
Oh great. How do we get up there?

388
00:36:57,531 --> 00:36:59,487
All right, everyone. On three!

389
00:36:59,488 --> 00:37:03,121
One ... two ...
- Three!

390
00:37:05,064 --> 00:37:07,054
Let go!

391
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,929
Go!

392
00:37:23,983 --> 00:37:25,900
He did it!
- Yes, sir!

393
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:29,616
Way to go, Buzz!

394
00:37:31,273 --> 00:37:36,294
They think they had a fun playtime.
- Sh. They might hear you.

395
00:37:37,806 --> 00:37:40,655
Ok, now you start.
- I ...
- Love ...
- You!

396
00:37:40,656 --> 00:37:42,464
See? That time I said "love".

397
00:37:42,465 --> 00:37:44,116
Ok, now me first.
- Ok, ok, ok.

398
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:45,574
I ...
- Love ...
- You!

399
00:37:45,575 --> 00:37:47,838
You see what I mean?
It changes every time!

400
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:51,651
You are so smart.
- Come on, Romeo. You're late.

401
00:37:51,652 --> 00:37:53,663
I'm going to miss you.

402
00:38:57,746 --> 00:39:00,097
All right. Place your bets.
Come on, everybody.
- Any splits?

403
00:39:00,098 --> 00:39:02,054
Here we go.
- Come on.

404
00:39:06,201 --> 00:39:07,317
That's it. No more bets.

405
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:09,861
Come on, right here.
- Come on, duck!
- Come on, duck!

406
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:13,183
I won!

407
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:17,585
Stretch takes the round.
- You lost.

408
00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:20,724
Ok, minimum bet: five monopoly.
Coyotes wild.

409
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,760
Change of two double A's.

410
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:24,759
Hey, what do you guys think of
the new recruits? Any keepers?

411
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,060
Oh please ... landfill!

412
00:39:27,061 --> 00:39:29,471
Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
- Toddler fodder.

413
00:39:29,472 --> 00:39:32,150
But that, that, uh, space guy ...
He can be useful.

414
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:36,306
He ain't the sharpest knife in the
place where they keep the knives.

415
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,112
Neither are you, Chunk.

416
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:40,798
You got a little piece for yourself,
didn't you, Ken?

417
00:39:40,799 --> 00:39:42,524
Hey, lay off, Twitch!

418
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:45,702
Barbie's different.
- Oh, Mr. Softy over here.

419
00:39:45,703 --> 00:39:50,011
What do you expect from a girl's toy?
- I'm not a girl's toy! I'm not!

420
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:53,694
Why do you guys keep saying that?
- All them toys are disposable.

421
00:39:53,695 --> 00:39:56,762
We'll be lucky if they last us a week.

422
00:40:01,628 --> 00:40:05,640
Well, well. Looky who we have here.

423
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:08,840
Let me go!
- Take him to the library.

424
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:10,346
No!

425
00:40:39,802 --> 00:40:41,626
1225 Sycamore.

426
00:40:42,312 --> 00:40:44,244
Woody, what are you doing?

427
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:47,672
I gotta get outta here.
- You're leaving?

428
00:40:47,673 --> 00:40:51,507
But didn't you have fun today?
- Well, of course I did.
More than I've had in years.

429
00:40:51,508 --> 00:40:55,046
But, you see, I belong to someone else.
- Who's "Ydna"?

430
00:40:55,047 --> 00:40:58,892
I believe it's pronounced "Ydnay".
- Guys, it says Andy.

431
00:40:58,893 --> 00:41:01,437
He's my Bonnie.
And he's leaving soon.

432
00:41:01,438 --> 00:41:03,524
I gotta get home.
- Where's home?

433
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:05,708
Elm Street. 234 Elm.

434
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:08,968
Do you have guys a map?
We're on it, Cowboy. Trixie?

435
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:11,670
I'll fire up the computer.

436
00:41:16,114 --> 00:41:19,697
Unhand me you, cowards.
I demand to talk to Lotso.

437
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:24,226
Zip it, Buck Rogers.
You won't talk to Lotso
til we say you can ...

438
00:41:25,231 --> 00:41:30,221
Ken, what's going on here?
Why is this toy tied up?

439
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:33,702
Uh, he got out Lotso.
- Got out?

440
00:41:33,703 --> 00:41:37,018
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no!
This isn't how we treat our guests.

441
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:43,232
FAO my Schwartz! There you go. I'm so sorry.

442
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:45,506
Lotso, there's been a mistake.
- A mistake?

443
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:49,186
The children in the Caterpillar Room are
not age-appropriate for me and my friends.

444
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:52,417
We respectfully request a transfer
to the Butterfly Room.

445
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:55,281
Well, request granted.
- But Lotso ...

446
00:41:55,282 --> 00:41:58,890
Hush now, Kenneth. This toy showed initiative.

447
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:02,394
Leadership. Why I say, we've
found ourselves a keeper.

448
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:05,650
Hear that everyone? We got a keeper!

449
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:10,249
We're calling you up to
the big leagues, son.

450
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:13,139
From now on you'll have anything you want.

451
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,822
Excellent! I'll go get my friends.
- Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.

452
00:42:18,823 --> 00:42:21,431
Those Caterpillar kids need
someone to play with.

453
00:42:21,432 --> 00:42:24,823
But my friends don't belong there.
- Oh none of us do.

454
00:42:24,824 --> 00:42:28,816
I agree, which is why for the good,
of our community ...

455
00:42:28,817 --> 00:42:35,449
We ask the newer toys, the stronger
ones, to take on the hardships the
rest of us can't bear anymore.

456
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,523
I guess that makes sense.

457
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:43,027
But I can't accept.
We're a family. We stay together.

458
00:42:43,723 --> 00:42:46,911
A family man, huh? I understand.

459
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:49,719
Put him back in the timeout chair.

460
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:53,419
Unhand me!

461
00:42:53,624 --> 00:42:56,067
Bring in the bookworm.

462
00:42:57,997 --> 00:43:03,589
Ah! Here it is.
It was filed under "Lightyear".

463
00:43:08,142 --> 00:43:11,893
Let's see here ...
Accessories, maintenance ...

464
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:16,818
Oh, here we go. Remove screws
to access battery compartment.

465
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:18,267
What are you doing?

466
00:43:19,246 --> 00:43:21,220
Let go of me.

467
00:43:21,221 --> 00:43:26,905
To return your Buzz Lightyear action figure
back to its original factory settings,

468
00:43:26,906 --> 00:43:31,005
slide the switch from 'Play' to 'Demo'.

469
00:43:31,006 --> 00:43:34,350
Stop! No, no, no!

470
00:43:35,478 --> 00:43:39,031
What was that?
- Sounds like it came from the hall.

471
00:43:39,032 --> 00:43:41,121
I'll see what it was.

472
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,346
What do you see? Anything?
- No, just a dark hallway.

473
00:43:46,347 --> 00:43:50,702
Wait, wait, I see Andy.
- What?

474
00:43:50,703 --> 00:43:53,928
That's impossible.
- No, no. I really see him.

475
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:56,728
In his room. Ohh! My other eye!

476
00:43:56,729 --> 00:43:59,385
The one I left behind!

477
00:44:00,249 --> 00:44:03,911
This is so weird. He's packing up.

478
00:44:03,912 --> 00:44:09,909
Uh oh. Here comes Buster.
Out of the way. Get away!

479
00:44:10,344 --> 00:44:12,920
Ok. Andy's out in the hall.

480
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:16,986
He's looking in the attic.
Wait, there's Mom.

481
00:44:17,172 --> 00:44:19,538
Why is he so upset?

482
00:44:19,939 --> 00:44:23,350
Oh no. Oh, this is terrible!

483
00:44:23,568 --> 00:44:27,892
He's looking for us.
Andy's looking for us.

484
00:44:27,893 --> 00:44:31,061
He's looking for us?

485
00:44:31,062 --> 00:44:35,294
Andy does want us! I just knew it!
- I think he did mean
to put us in the attic.

486
00:44:35,295 --> 00:44:39,368
Well, then Woody was telling the truth.
- Holy cow!
- And you didn't believe him!

487
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:43,814
Hey, you didn't believe him first.
- Guys, we gotta, we gotta go home!

488
00:44:45,887 --> 00:44:50,162
Lotso!
- Hey there. How are you all
doing this fine evening?

489
00:44:50,163 --> 00:44:55,040
Thank goodness. Have you seen Buzz?
- There's been a mistake. We have to go.

490
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:59,033
Go? Why? You just got here,
in the nick of time too.

491
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:02,398
We were running low on volunteers
for the little ones.

492
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:05,494
They just love new toys,
now don't they?

493
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:08,445
Love? We have  been chewed,
kicked, drooled on ...

494
00:45:08,446 --> 00:45:11,300
Just look at my pocket book.

495
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:15,764
Hmm, well here's the thing, Sweet
Potato, you ain't leaving Sunnyside.

496
00:45:15,765 --> 00:45:19,444
Sweet Potato?
Who do you think you're talking to?

497
00:45:19,445 --> 00:45:23,852
I have over 30 accessories and I
deserve more respect ...

498
00:45:23,963 --> 00:45:25,908
Ah, that's better.

499
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:29,128
Hey! No one takes my wife's mouth,
except me!

500
00:45:29,129 --> 00:45:31,294
Give it back, you furry air freshener!

501
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:36,350
Come on guys. We're going home.
- Whoa, there Missy!
You're not going anywhere.

502
00:45:36,617 --> 00:45:39,029
Oh yeah? Who's going to stop us?

503
00:45:40,376 --> 00:45:44,404
Buzz, you're back. Buzz?

504
00:45:47,387 --> 00:45:49,441
Watch out!

505
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,366
Prisoners disabled, Commander Lotso.

506
00:45:57,367 --> 00:45:59,996
Buzz, what are you doing?
- Silence. Minions of Zurg.

507
00:45:59,997 --> 00:46:03,909
You are in the custody of the Galactic Alliance.
- Galactic Alliance?

508
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:07,822
Good work, Lightyear. Now lock 'em up.

509
00:46:07,823 --> 00:46:09,761
Yes, sir.

510
00:46:18,368 --> 00:46:20,864
Where do you think you're going?

511
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:26,057
Buzz, we're your friends.
- Spare me your lies, Temptress.

512
00:46:26,058 --> 00:46:30,541
Your emperor is defeated and I'm immune
to your bewitching good looks.

513
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:33,235
Hey, Mungo. Get your paws off my wife.

514
00:46:33,236 --> 00:46:40,033
Let go of me, you drooling doofus.
- Not him. I think this potato needs
to learn himself some manners.

515
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:43,505
Take him to the box.
- Hey, put me down, you moron!

516
00:46:43,506 --> 00:46:46,146
Where are you taking me to?
Bad baby. Bad baby.

517
00:46:46,147 --> 00:46:51,075
Ken, what's going on?
- Barbie. I told you to
wait in the dream house.

518
00:46:51,076 --> 00:46:54,432
What are you doing with my friends?
- Get in.

519
00:46:54,493 --> 00:46:57,659
Barbie, wait.
- Don't touch me!

520
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,473
We're through!
- Barbie, I ...

521
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:04,724
And give me my scarf back.
- Ow!

522
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:10,618
Lightyear, explain our overnight accommodations.
- Sir. Yes, sir.

523
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:16,127
Prisoners sleep in their cells.
Any prisoner caught outside their cell,
spends the night in the box.

524
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:18,350
Roll call at dusk and dawn.

525
00:47:18,351 --> 00:47:22,282
Any prisoner misses roll call,
spends the night in the box.

526
00:47:22,283 --> 00:47:25,465
Prisoners do not speak unless spoken to.

527
00:47:25,466 --> 00:47:28,586
Any prisoner talks back,
spends the night ...

528
00:47:28,587 --> 00:47:30,777
... in the box.
We get it!

529
00:47:30,778 --> 00:47:33,674
At ease, soldier. They're neutralized.

530
00:47:33,709 --> 00:47:37,214
But remember, they'll say anything
to make you doubt yourself.

531
00:47:38,015 --> 00:47:39,672
Don't worry, Commander.
Any doubt I had ...

532
00:47:39,673 --> 00:47:42,382
got pounded out of me at the Academy.

533
00:47:42,383 --> 00:47:46,729
Listen up folks. We got a way of
doing things here at Sunnyside.

534
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:53,016
If you start at the bottom, pay your dues,
life here can be a dream come true.

535
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:56,430
But if you break our rules,
step out of line ...

536
00:47:56,431 --> 00:48:03,454
try to checkout early,
well, you're just hurting yourself.

537
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:08,847
Woody! What did you do to him?
- You all get a good night's rest ...

538
00:48:08,848 --> 00:48:13,197
You got a full day of playtime tomorrow.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

539
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:21,155
1225 Syca ...

540
00:48:21,156 --> 00:48:25,389
Who is Velocistar237?

541
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:30,330
That's just a dinosaur toy down the street.
That's nothing. Let me just take care of that.

542
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,364
Just a dinosaur ...

543
00:48:32,365 --> 00:48:35,465
All right. Sycamore. Ok. Enter.

544
00:48:35,877 --> 00:48:38,641
Please don't be far. Please. Please.

545
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:42,746
Right around the corner?
It's right around the corner!
- Yay!

546
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:47,653
Look at me! I'm big toy on campus!

547
00:48:47,654 --> 00:48:51,416
Hello. I'll see you at the Sock Hop.
- Ok, Potsie.

548
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:54,681
Hey, wait, listen ... If any of you guys
ever get to Sunnyside Daycare ...

549
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,647
you tell them that Woody made it home.
- You came from Sunnyside?

550
00:48:57,648 --> 00:49:01,575
But, how'd you escape?
- Well, it wasn't easy.

551
00:49:02,295 --> 00:49:04,835
What do you mean "escape"?

552
00:49:04,836 --> 00:49:08,072
Sunnyside is a place of ruin
and despair.

553
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:11,880
Ruled by an evil bear who
smells of strawberries.

554
00:49:12,686 --> 00:49:16,640
Lotso?
- The guy may seem plush and
huggable on the outside ...

555
00:49:16,675 --> 00:49:21,076
but inside, he's a monster.
- But, how do you know that?

556
00:49:21,841 --> 00:49:24,637
Chuckles. He'll tell you.

557
00:49:29,118 --> 00:49:31,566
Yeah, I knew Lotso.

558
00:49:32,397 --> 00:49:35,442
He was a good toy. A friend.

559
00:49:35,443 --> 00:49:39,461
Me and him, we had the same kid. Daisy.

560
00:49:40,775 --> 00:49:44,322
I was there when Lotso got unwrapped.

561
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:52,862
Daisy loved us all.
But Lotso ... Lotso was special.

562
00:49:53,765 --> 00:49:57,200
They did everything together.

563
00:49:57,201 --> 00:50:00,710
I've never seen a kid
and a toy more in love.

564
00:50:01,474 --> 00:50:04,534
One day we took a drive.

565
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:07,954
At a rest stop, we had a little playtime.

566
00:50:08,748 --> 00:50:11,850
After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.

567
00:50:19,471 --> 00:50:22,329
She never came back.

568
00:50:26,853 --> 00:50:29,591
Lotso wouldn't give up.

569
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:36,399
It took forever, but we finally
made it back to Daisy's.

570
00:50:42,908 --> 00:50:46,221
But by then, it was too late.

571
00:50:57,219 --> 00:51:00,430
Something changed that day inside Lotso.

572
00:51:00,431 --> 00:51:04,001
Something snapped.
- She replaced us.

573
00:51:04,002 --> 00:51:06,568
Come on.
- No, she only replaced you.

574
00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:10,116
She replaced all of us.
Didn't she?

575
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,925
She don't love you no more.

576
00:51:14,926 --> 00:51:17,661
Now, come on!

577
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:24,936
We were lost. Cast off.

578
00:51:24,937 --> 00:51:27,823
Unloved, unwanted.

579
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,898
Then we found Sunnyside.

580
00:51:45,036 --> 00:51:48,170
But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore.

581
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,344
He wasn't anyone's friend.

582
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:57,167
He took over Sunnyside and
rigged the whole system.

583
00:51:57,844 --> 00:52:01,026
So, how'd you get out?
- I got broke.

584
00:52:01,027 --> 00:52:06,342
Bonnie found me. Took me home.
Other toys, they weren't so lucky.

585
00:52:06,653 --> 00:52:12,999
It ain't right what Lotso done.
New toys, they don't stand a chance.

586
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,652
But my friends are in there.
- You can't go back.

587
00:52:15,653 --> 00:52:19,973
Returning now would be suicide.
- But what about your Andy?

588
00:52:19,974 --> 00:52:23,382
Isn't he leaving for college?

589
00:52:41,516 --> 00:52:43,610
Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!

590
00:52:46,345 --> 00:52:50,264
Oh, Bull's-eye. I miss Woody too.

591
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:55,718
But he ain't ever coming back.

592
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:19,834
Rise and shine, campers!
- Commander Lotso, sir.

593
00:53:20,619 --> 00:53:24,089
All quiet. Nothing to report.
- Excellent, Lightyear.

594
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:29,031
Come on. We need you back at Star Command.
- Wait! What have you done with my husband?

595
00:53:29,066 --> 00:53:31,918
Big Baby.

596
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:38,826
Sweet heart!

597
00:53:38,827 --> 00:53:43,042
It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand
and a couple of "Lincoln Logs".

598
00:53:43,043 --> 00:53:45,415
Uh, I don't think those were "Lincoln Logs".

599
00:53:45,416 --> 00:53:49,513
You all get ready.
You got a play date with destiny.

600
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:16,271
Uh, hello?
- You shouldn't have come back, Cowboy.
They've cracked down hard since you left.

601
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:21,050
More guards, more patrols. You and your
friends ain't ever gonna get outta here now.

602
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:23,713
I made it out once.
- You got lucky once.

603
00:55:23,714 --> 00:55:26,724
Want my advice? Keep your heads down.

604
00:55:26,725 --> 00:55:29,194
You'll survive.
- Yeah, for how long?

605
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:32,565
I've been here years.
They'll never break me.

606
00:55:32,841 --> 00:55:35,787
There's only one way toys leave this place.

607
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,885
Poor fella.
Trash truck comes at dawn.

608
00:55:39,886 --> 00:55:44,761
Then it's off to the dump.
- Look, I appreciate your concern, Old Timer.

609
00:55:44,762 --> 00:55:47,709
But we have a kid waiting for us.
Now we're leaving.

610
00:55:47,982 --> 00:55:51,202
If you'd help us, one toy to another,
I'd sure be grateful.

611
00:55:54,071 --> 00:55:57,405
Well, if you're gonna get out, first thing
you gotta get through is the doors.

612
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,687
Locked every night.
Inside and out.

613
00:56:00,688 --> 00:56:03,405
Keys are left on a hook in the office.
- Got it. What else?

614
00:56:03,406 --> 00:56:06,139
Lotso's trucks patrolling all night long.

615
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,308
Hallway, lobby, playground ...
- Yeah, yeah. What about the wall?

616
00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:14,460
8 feet high.
Cinder block. No way through it.
You go over or under.

617
00:56:14,461 --> 00:56:17,068
That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.
- It's not.

618
00:56:17,069 --> 00:56:20,073
Your real problem's the monkey.

619
00:56:20,108 --> 00:56:24,759
The monkey's the eye in the sky.
He sees everything.

620
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:28,490
Classrooms ...

621
00:56:37,622 --> 00:56:39,672
Hallways ...

622
00:56:47,885 --> 00:56:50,701
Even the playground.

623
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,472
He can unlock doors, sneak past guards ...

624
00:57:00,473 --> 00:57:03,814
climb the wall, but if you
don't take out that monkey ...

625
00:57:03,815 --> 00:57:06,525
you ain't going nowhere.
Do you want to get out of here?

626
00:57:06,526 --> 00:57:09,665
Get rid of that monkey!

627
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:12,097
Recess. Come on, kids.

628
00:57:18,274 --> 00:57:21,755
Hey guys.
- Woody?
- Woody!

629
00:57:26,002 --> 00:57:28,592
Thank goodness!
- You're alive!
- Of course I'm alive.

630
00:57:29,326 --> 00:57:32,814
My hat. Wait. Where's Buzz?

631
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:36,895
Lotso did something to do with him.
- He thinks he's a real Space Ranger again.

632
00:57:36,896 --> 00:57:40,281
Oh no!
- Oh yes. Return of the astro nut.

633
00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:45,061
Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy.
I ... I was wrong.

634
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,287
Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.

635
00:57:47,288 --> 00:57:50,731
No, no, it's my fault for leaving you guys.

636
00:57:50,732 --> 00:57:53,096
From now on, we stick together.

637
00:57:53,097 --> 00:57:55,257
But, Andy's leaving for college.

638
00:57:55,258 --> 00:58:00,063
College! Flag down the mailman!
We gotta get you home before
Andy leaves tomorrow!

639
00:58:00,098 --> 00:58:02,912
Tomorrow? But that means ...
- That means we're busting out of here.

640
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:05,345
Tonight.
- What? Impossible!

641
00:58:05,346 --> 00:58:08,273
There's no way out of here.
- No, there is a way out.

642
00:58:09,577 --> 00:58:12,195
One way.

643
00:58:19,977 --> 00:58:22,329
Slinky Dog?
- Present.

644
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:25,753
Green guys? Cowgirl?

645
00:58:25,754 --> 00:58:28,371
Here.
- Horse?

646
00:58:29,228 --> 00:58:31,508
Piggy Bank.
- Yup.

647
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:33,866
Tyrannosaurus?
- Here.

648
00:58:33,867 --> 00:58:35,976
Barbie?
- Here.

649
00:58:35,977 --> 00:58:40,868
Potato Head?

650
00:58:41,348 --> 00:58:44,708
Hey! Hey! Super Troop Man. Wake up!

651
00:58:44,709 --> 00:58:47,472
Impossible.

652
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:04,945
Little late for a stroll isn't it,
Potato Head?

653
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,416
That's Mr. Potato Head to you smoothie!

654
00:59:16,304 --> 00:59:19,255
You ascot-wearing pink nosier!
You're not a toy!

655
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:21,729
You're an accessory!
You're a purse with legs!

656
00:59:22,628 --> 00:59:25,979
Take him back to the box!
- No, not the box!

657
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,027
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
I like ascots.

658
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:33,813
Ok check.
- Good work, Lightyear.

659
00:59:33,814 --> 00:59:36,620
All right. Resume your ...
uh ... space guy thing.

660
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:39,151
Yes, sir, well-groomed man.

661
00:59:39,186 --> 00:59:41,927
Ken? Ken?

662
00:59:44,554 --> 00:59:47,282
What do you want?
- I can't take it here, Ken.

663
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:49,454
I want to go to the Butterfly Room.
With you.

664
00:59:49,455 --> 00:59:52,931
Yeah, well, you should have
thought of that yesterday.
- I was wrong.

665
00:59:52,932 --> 00:59:55,761
I want to be with you Ken, I do,
in your dream house.

666
00:59:55,762 --> 00:59:59,967
Take me away from this!
Take me away!

667
01:00:00,669 --> 01:00:05,009
Darn it, Barbie. Ok, but things
are complicated around here.

668
01:00:05,044 --> 01:00:08,663
You gotta do what I say.
- I will Ken. I promise.

669
01:00:09,502 --> 01:00:12,838
Wait! I'll do anything!
I'll change your diapers!

670
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,020
Get the tape!

671
01:01:08,282 --> 01:01:11,165
And this is where the magic happens.

672
01:01:11,905 --> 01:01:15,679
Look at all your clothes!
I can't believe you never
brought me up here!

673
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,941
Tennis whites. Mission to Mars.
- Check this out.

674
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:22,877
Kung Fu Fighting. Canvas Hero
with matching sports pennant.

675
01:01:22,878 --> 01:01:26,735
Flower Power. Oh, Ken!

676
01:01:27,002 --> 01:01:29,561
No one appreciates clothes here, Barbie.

677
01:01:29,596 --> 01:01:35,698
No one.
- Ken, would you model
a few outfits for me?

678
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:38,393
Just a few.

679
01:02:08,351 --> 01:02:13,159
Go get the key!
- Where is it? Where is it?
Where's the key? Where's the key?

680
01:02:13,286 --> 01:02:16,660
Bingo.

681
01:02:24,512 --> 01:02:29,953
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
I told you, keep your hands off of my stuff!

682
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,932
Make a move, Porky.

683
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:35,857
No fighting. Break it up.

684
01:02:41,318 --> 01:02:44,055
You can't hit each other.
That's my job.

685
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:51,010
Help! Prison riot!

686
01:02:52,589 --> 01:02:54,539
Get the tortilla.

687
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:36,039
Ready?
- Ready.

688
01:03:43,711 --> 01:03:46,372
Uh, Barbie?

689
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:49,846
No more games, Ken.
What did Lotso do to Buzz?

690
01:03:49,847 --> 01:03:53,413
And how do we switch him back?
- You can't make me talk. You can't!

691
01:03:54,462 --> 01:03:57,278
But I'd like to see you try.

692
01:04:48,113 --> 01:04:51,103
Let's see ... Hawaiian surf trunks.

693
01:04:51,104 --> 01:04:53,669
Oh, Barbie, those are vintage!

694
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:56,754
It's ok. Go ahead, rip them.
I don't care. They're a dime a dozen.

695
01:04:57,299 --> 01:04:59,547
Ooh, glitter tux.

696
01:05:00,308 --> 01:05:02,895
Who cares? Who cares?
Those things are tacky.

697
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:07,711
Ooh, a Nehru jacket.
- Barbie, not the Nehru!

698
01:05:07,712 --> 01:05:10,344
This is from what? 1967?

699
01:05:10,379 --> 01:05:13,571
The Groovy Formal Collection, yes!
- What a shame.

700
01:05:13,572 --> 01:05:15,918
Oh no! No! No!

701
01:05:15,919 --> 01:05:18,407
There is an instructional manual!

702
01:05:18,408 --> 01:05:24,247
Lotso switched Buzz to demo mode.
- Where's that manual?

703
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:30,058
I don't know why this couldn't wait
until morning Ken, but here you go.

704
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:45,848
What's taking so doggone long?

705
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,747
So, how do we fix Buzz?

706
01:06:08,705 --> 01:06:10,989
What are you looking at, Feathers?

707
01:06:19,334 --> 01:06:22,448
Yeah, fly away, you coward.
Uh oh.

708
01:06:23,727 --> 01:06:26,071
Well, that's just great.

709
01:06:33,148 --> 01:06:36,018
Oh give it up. No one can hear you.

710
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:39,670
What?
- I said, no one can hear you.

711
01:06:39,972 --> 01:06:42,833
What?
- He said, "no one can" ...

712
01:06:42,834 --> 01:06:46,003
Shh. Be quiet.
- Woody, you're back.

713
01:06:49,287 --> 01:06:53,567
Stop him! Don't let him get out!
- Star Command: I've been taken
hostage by my own prisoners.

714
01:06:55,935 --> 01:06:59,401
Quick.  Open his back, there's a switch.
- Unhand me Zurg scum!

715
01:06:59,402 --> 01:07:02,123
The Galactic Court will show you no mercy.

716
01:07:02,606 --> 01:07:05,935
It's not working. Why is it not working?
Where's the manual?

717
01:07:05,936 --> 01:07:09,363
Here we go. There should be a little
hole under the switch.
- Little hole ... Got it!

718
01:07:09,364 --> 01:07:12,479
To reset your Buzz Lightyear,
insert paper clip ...

719
01:07:12,898 --> 01:07:15,898
Rex, use your finger!
- What?
- Ok. Now what?

720
01:07:16,546 --> 01:07:20,418
Let's see. Caution do not hold button
for more than five seconds.

721
01:07:22,673 --> 01:07:25,621
It's not my fault.

722
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:34,204
Starlog, I've awakened from hyper
sleep on a strange planet.

723
01:07:34,205 --> 01:07:36,688
Now what did you do?
- I just did what you told me.

724
01:07:36,689 --> 01:07:40,535
I am surrounded by unknown creatures.

725
01:07:40,536 --> 01:07:43,784
Friend or foe?

726
01:07:44,482 --> 01:07:46,680
Amigos. We're all amigos.

727
01:07:47,299 --> 01:07:50,713
I must have crashed and
my memory's been erased.

728
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:55,102
Has anyone seen my spaceship?
- We gotta switch him back.

729
01:07:55,103 --> 01:07:58,028
How do we do that ?
- I don't know, this part's in Spanish.

730
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:04,092
We don't have time for this. Come on, El Buzzo.
- My ship has landed well.

731
01:08:05,344 --> 01:08:07,080
Good luck, Cowboy.

732
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,684
Here they come.

733
01:08:16,776 --> 01:08:19,142
Come on, Buzz.

734
01:08:19,689 --> 01:08:22,306
What took you so long?
- Things got complicated.

735
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:24,521
Where's Potato Head?
- We haven't seen him.

736
01:08:27,157 --> 01:08:30,545
Buzz.

737
01:08:31,115 --> 01:08:37,093
My desert flower.

738
01:08:37,662 --> 01:08:40,981
Did you fix Buzz?
- Uh, sort of.

739
01:08:40,982 --> 01:08:43,431
Behind you. Someone's coming.

740
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,801
You would not believe what I've
been through tonight.

741
01:08:49,802 --> 01:08:52,894
Darling, are you ok?
- I feel fresh, healthy ...

742
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:55,345
It's terrible.
- You've lost weight.

743
01:08:55,346 --> 01:08:57,577
And so tall.

744
01:08:58,461 --> 01:09:00,701
Ah, you're a sight for detachable eyes.

745
01:09:06,832 --> 01:09:08,431
All clear.

746
01:09:11,124 --> 01:09:12,816
Come on. Come on.

747
01:09:14,389 --> 01:09:16,124
We're almost there.

748
01:09:20,932 --> 01:09:22,034
Back up. Back up.

749
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:30,245
Come on.

750
01:10:37,806 --> 01:10:41,466
Miss, you are the prettiest
flower in the room.

751
01:10:41,467 --> 01:10:44,792
And together, we'll fight evil.

752
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,805
Woody!

753
01:10:51,161 --> 01:10:55,320
Come on, we're almost there.
- After you.

754
01:11:01,823 --> 01:11:04,663
Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.

755
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:09,454
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

756
01:11:14,918 --> 01:11:18,502
Open.
- Way to go, Buzz. Come on.

757
01:11:21,956 --> 01:11:25,402
Is it safe?
- I guess I'll find out.

758
01:11:31,989 --> 01:11:35,334
Woody, are you ok?
- Yeah, come on down.

759
01:11:35,335 --> 01:11:37,624
But not all at once.
- What did he say?

760
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:40,944
I think he said, all at once.
- No. No, no, no, no, no!

761
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,460
Thanks Jess.
- You're welcome.

762
01:11:48,461 --> 01:11:52,054
Almost there guys.
Slink, you think you can make it?

763
01:11:52,055 --> 01:11:55,366
I might be old, but I still
got a spring in my step.

764
01:11:57,574 --> 01:11:59,890
He did it!
- All right, Slinkykins!

765
01:11:59,891 --> 01:12:02,774
Ok, climb across.

766
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:06,913
You lost, little doggie?

767
01:12:09,085 --> 01:12:12,789
Well, well, look who's back.

768
01:12:20,385 --> 01:12:24,747
I'm sorry, Cowboy. They broke me.

769
01:12:24,748 --> 01:12:28,347
What are y'all doing?
Running back to your kid?

770
01:12:28,348 --> 01:12:31,400
He don't want you no more.
- That's a lie.

771
01:12:31,401 --> 01:12:33,751
Is it? Tell me this Sheriff ...

772
01:12:33,752 --> 01:12:37,523
If your kid loves you so much,
why is he leaving?

773
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:41,807
You think you're special, Cowboy?
You're a piece of plastic.

774
01:12:41,808 --> 01:12:44,786
You were made to be thrown away.

775
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:48,313
Speak of the devil.

776
01:12:52,671 --> 01:12:56,236
Now, we need toys in our Caterpillar Room

777
01:12:56,237 --> 01:12:58,867
and you need to avoid that truck.

778
01:12:58,868 --> 01:13:02,948
Why don't you come on back
join our family again?

779
01:13:02,949 --> 01:13:07,085
This isn't a family, it's a prison.
You're a liar and a bully.

780
01:13:07,086 --> 01:13:11,141
And I'd rather rot in this dumpster
than join any family of yours.

781
01:13:11,142 --> 01:13:14,915
Jessie's right.
Authority should derive from
the consent of the governed,

782
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:17,240
not from the threat of force.

783
01:13:17,241 --> 01:13:20,803
If that's what you want.

784
01:13:21,069 --> 01:13:24,630
Barbie, wait!
Don't do this, Lotso!

785
01:13:24,631 --> 01:13:29,220
She's a barbie doll, Ken.
There's a hundred million just like her.

786
01:13:29,692 --> 01:13:32,395
Not to me there's not.

787
01:13:32,396 --> 01:13:35,512
Fine. Then why don't you join them?

788
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:44,386
Oh Ken!
- Everyone listen. Sunnyside can be cool
and groovy if we treated each other fair.

789
01:13:44,387 --> 01:13:48,799
It's Lotso. He's made us into a pyramid,
and he put himself on top.

790
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,613
Anyone concur with Ken?

791
01:13:54,133 --> 01:13:56,981
I didn't throw you away, your kid did.

792
01:13:56,982 --> 01:14:01,994
Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.
Chew on that when you're in the dump.

793
01:14:01,995 --> 01:14:04,227
Wait. What about Daisy?

794
01:14:05,308 --> 01:14:10,744
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Daisy. You used to do everything with her.

795
01:14:10,745 --> 01:14:14,350
Yeah, then she threw us out.
- No, she lost you.

796
01:14:14,351 --> 01:14:17,017
She replaced us.
- She replaced you.

797
01:14:17,018 --> 01:14:19,195
And if you couldn't have her,
then no one could!

798
01:14:19,196 --> 01:14:22,155
You lied to Big Baby and
you've been lying ever since.

799
01:14:23,281 --> 01:14:25,903
Where'd you get that?
- She loved you, Lotso.

800
01:14:25,904 --> 01:14:29,493
She never loved me!
- As much as any kid ever loved a toy.

801
01:14:33,499 --> 01:14:40,962
Mama.
- What? You want your mommy back?
She never loved you! Don't be such a baby!

802
01:14:42,923 --> 01:14:45,991
Push them in. All of them.

803
01:14:45,992 --> 01:14:48,814
This is what happens when
you dummies try to think.

804
01:14:48,815 --> 01:14:52,271
We're all just trash waiting
to be thrown away.

805
01:14:52,272 --> 01:14:55,124
That's all a toy is.

806
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:58,646
Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!

807
01:15:00,065 --> 01:15:03,924
No, no, wait a minute! Baby, wait!

808
01:15:05,866 --> 01:15:08,674
He's gone.
- Holy cow.

809
01:15:13,269 --> 01:15:15,213
Come on. Hurry.

810
01:15:21,524 --> 01:15:23,998
Oh for crying out loud!
- Come on.

811
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,619
No!
- Woody!

812
01:15:33,064 --> 01:15:35,472
Oh boy. Incoming!

813
01:15:36,362 --> 01:15:39,032
Come on.

814
01:15:39,033 --> 01:15:41,020
Barbie, no!

815
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:46,207
Woody!

816
01:15:49,298 --> 01:15:51,571
No!

817
01:15:55,328 --> 01:15:58,019
Can you hear me? Is everyone ok?

818
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,324
Of course not, you imbecile!
We're doomed!

819
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,767
Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on.

820
01:16:06,908 --> 01:16:09,160
We all here ? Slinky? Rex?

821
01:16:12,912 --> 01:16:17,519
Against the wall, everybody. Quick!
- Miss, where are you?

822
01:16:28,495 --> 01:16:30,015
They'll never make it.

823
01:16:39,496 --> 01:16:41,892
Look out!

824
01:16:53,077 --> 01:16:56,115
Anyone see him?
- Over here, y'all. I found him.

825
01:16:59,569 --> 01:17:04,890
Buzz, are you ok?
Buzz? Buzz?

826
01:17:15,066 --> 01:17:20,463
That wasn't me was it?
- Oh Buzz, you're back.

827
01:17:20,498 --> 01:17:23,169
Yes, I'm back.
Where have I been?

828
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:27,438
Beyond infinity, Space Ranger.
- Woody!

829
01:17:27,473 --> 01:17:31,127
So, where are we now?
- In a garbage truck on the way to the dump.

830
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:47,446
Hold on! We're going in!

831
01:18:01,555 --> 01:18:05,463
Have you got all your pieces?
- The Claw.

832
01:18:05,464 --> 01:18:08,679
My babies!
- Hey guys! No! No!

833
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:12,011
No!

834
01:18:17,253 --> 01:18:19,754
Hang on.

835
01:18:31,917 --> 01:18:35,579
Woody, what do we do?
- We'll be ok if we stay together.

836
01:18:39,145 --> 01:18:41,933
It's a magnet. Watch out!

837
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:43,783
Don't worry, Slink.
We'll get you down.

838
01:18:43,784 --> 01:18:46,611
I don't wanna take a look at this.

839
01:18:50,046 --> 01:18:52,533
Quick, grab something metal.

840
01:18:56,979 --> 01:19:00,059
You heard the guy.

841
01:19:01,764 --> 01:19:05,233
It's not working.

842
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:11,141
Help! Help me! I'm stuck!

843
01:19:11,142 --> 01:19:15,723
Help please! Help!
- Woody!

844
01:19:17,892 --> 01:19:20,393
Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.

845
01:19:33,801 --> 01:19:35,810
Go! Go!

846
01:19:40,436 --> 01:19:43,649
Thank you, Sheriff.
- We're all in this together.

847
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:46,488
Right guys?

848
01:19:46,489 --> 01:19:49,902
Guys?
- Woody, down here.

849
01:19:56,686 --> 01:20:00,939
Woody, look, I can see daylight.
We're going to be ok.

850
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:05,640
I don't think that's daylight.

851
01:20:10,675 --> 01:20:13,371
Run!

852
01:20:28,562 --> 01:20:32,613
Sheriff, the button. Help me.

853
01:20:32,614 --> 01:20:34,841
Come on.

854
01:20:34,842 --> 01:20:37,669
Go! Go! Hit the button!

855
01:20:44,766 --> 01:20:47,175
Hurry!

856
01:20:49,105 --> 01:20:52,707
Just push it! Push it! Push it!

857
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:55,964
Where's your kid now, Sheriff?

858
01:20:55,965 --> 01:20:59,131
No! No!
- Lotso!

859
01:21:25,296 --> 01:21:30,047
Buzz, what do we do?

860
01:23:17,633 --> 01:23:20,458
You know all that bad stuff
I said about Andy's attic?

861
01:23:20,459 --> 01:23:23,589
I take it all back.
- You're darn tootin'.

862
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:26,092
You said it.

863
01:23:30,674 --> 01:23:34,023
Oh darling, you were so brave.

864
01:23:34,691 --> 01:23:39,233
You saved our lives.
- And we are eternally grateful.

865
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:43,300
My boys.
- Daddy!

866
01:23:43,301 --> 01:23:45,065
Hey, where is that furball Lotso?

867
01:23:45,066 --> 01:23:47,341
Yeah, I'd like to loosen his stitching.

868
01:23:47,342 --> 01:23:50,243
Forget it, guys.
He's not worth it.

869
01:23:59,815 --> 01:24:03,172
Hey!
- Whatcha got?
- I had me one of these when I was a kid.

870
01:24:03,884 --> 01:24:07,186
Strawberries.

871
01:24:09,698 --> 01:24:12,920
Hey buddy! You might wanna
keep your mouth shut.

872
01:24:18,894 --> 01:24:23,226
Come on, Woody. We gotta get you home.
- That's right, college boy.

873
01:24:23,327 --> 01:24:27,220
Wait, what about you guys?
I mean ...

874
01:24:27,221 --> 01:24:29,913
Maybe the attic's not such a great idea.

875
01:24:29,914 --> 01:24:34,260
We're Andy's toys, Woody.
- We'll be there for him ...

876
01:24:34,261 --> 01:24:36,558
Together.

877
01:24:36,559 --> 01:24:40,584
I just hope he hasn't left yet.
- Wait a minute. Wait, I'll check.

878
01:24:40,585 --> 01:24:45,127
Andy's still packing.
But he's almost done.

879
01:24:45,128 --> 01:24:48,313
He lives halfway across town.
- We'll never get there in time.

880
01:25:04,368 --> 01:25:07,452
Come on, Buster.
- Honey, you've got everything?

881
01:25:07,453 --> 01:25:10,392
Yeah, just a few more boxes in my room.
- Ok, come on!

882
01:25:25,412 --> 01:25:28,050
Ok. All clear.

883
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:37,432
Oh, there you are!

884
01:25:45,102 --> 01:25:49,942
Buzz ... this isn't goodbye.

885
01:25:50,184 --> 01:25:54,508
Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.
- Yeah, but not too much fun.

886
01:25:54,509 --> 01:25:59,970
Woody, take care of Andy.
- Yeah.
- He's a good kid ...

887
01:25:59,971 --> 01:26:02,976
Tell him to get a haircut.
- Sure thing.

888
01:26:04,444 --> 01:26:08,661
Jessie, you'll be ok in the attic?
- Of course I will.

889
01:26:08,662 --> 01:26:12,527
Besides, I know about Buzz's Spanish mode.

890
01:26:12,528 --> 01:26:13,935
My what?

891
01:26:18,274 --> 01:26:21,234
You know where to find us, Cowboy.

892
01:26:34,544 --> 01:26:38,091
Did you say goodbye to Molly?
- Mom, we've said goodbye like ten times.

893
01:26:50,364 --> 01:26:53,109
Mom, it's ok.

894
01:26:55,260 --> 01:27:01,811
I know. It's just ... I wish
I could always be with you.

895
01:27:02,967 --> 01:27:05,536
You will be, Mom.

896
01:27:21,037 --> 01:27:23,329
Hey, aren't you going to say goodbye to Buster?

897
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:26,799
Of course I am. Who's a good dog?
Who's a good doggie?

898
01:27:42,643 --> 01:27:47,907
Get the rest of your things.
- Ok Buster. Now don't let Molly near my stuff.

899
01:28:01,203 --> 01:28:06,494
Hey, Mom. So, do you really think
I should donate these?

900
01:28:06,495 --> 01:28:09,510
It's up to you, Honey.
Whatever you want to do.

901
01:28:35,598 --> 01:28:39,187
Don't go in there! The bakery is haunted!

902
01:28:39,188 --> 01:28:42,707
Are you crazy? You'll wake up all the ghosts.

903
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:45,414
Look out! The ghosts are throwing pies.

904
01:28:48,484 --> 01:28:53,388
Mom!
- Andy?
- Hi.
- Wow, look at you.

905
01:28:53,389 --> 01:28:57,173
I hear you're off to college.
- Yeah, right now actually.

906
01:28:57,234 --> 01:29:01,497
So, what can we do for you?
- Uh, I have some toys here.

907
01:29:02,459 --> 01:29:06,027
You hear that, Bonnie?
- So, you're Bonnie?

908
01:29:07,337 --> 01:29:12,501
I'm Andy.
Someone told me you're
really good with toys.

909
01:29:12,502 --> 01:29:16,904
These are mine, but I'm going away now ...

910
01:29:16,905 --> 01:29:19,753
So I need someone really special

911
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:21,383
to play with them.

912
01:29:27,465 --> 01:29:31,287
This is Jessie. The roughest, toughest
cowgirl in the whole west.

913
01:29:31,288 --> 01:29:35,633
She loves "critters", but not more
than her best pal, Bull's-eye.

914
01:29:38,857 --> 01:29:40,009
Here.

915
01:29:53,281 --> 01:29:58,089
This is Rex, the meanest, most terrifying
dinosaur who ever lived.

916
01:30:04,161 --> 01:30:09,941
The Potato Heads. Mr. and Mrs.
You gotta keep them together,
because they're madly in love.

917
01:30:11,096 --> 01:30:13,976
Now Slinky here, is as loyal as
any dog you could want ...

918
01:30:14,396 --> 01:30:17,301
And Hamm ... he'll keep your money safe ...

919
01:30:17,302 --> 01:30:22,772
but he's also one of the most
dastardly villains of all time
... Evil Doctor Pork Chop.

920
01:30:25,632 --> 01:30:30,408
These little dudes are from a strange
alien world - Pizza planet.

921
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:40,024
And this is Buzz Lightyear,
the coolest toy ever!

922
01:30:40,059 --> 01:30:43,245
Look, he can fly and shoot lasers.

923
01:30:43,246 --> 01:30:46,640
He's sworn to protect the galaxy
from the evil Emperor Zurg.

924
01:30:48,426 --> 01:30:50,926
To infinity and beyond.

925
01:30:51,725 --> 01:30:55,956
Now, you gotta promise to take
good care of these guys ...

926
01:30:58,288 --> 01:31:01,408
They mean a lot to me.

927
01:31:06,246 --> 01:31:07,738
My cowboy!

928
01:31:11,431 --> 01:31:14,419
Woody? What's he doing in there?

929
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:17,096
There's a snake in my boot.

930
01:31:19,218 --> 01:31:22,118
There's a snake in my boot.

931
01:31:35,349 --> 01:31:40,350
Now, Woody ... he's been my pal for
as long as I can remember ...

932
01:31:40,845 --> 01:31:43,121
He's brave, like a cowboy should be ...

933
01:31:43,388 --> 01:31:48,699
and kind and smart, but the thing
that makes Woody special ...

934
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:53,126
is he'll never give up on you. Ever!

935
01:31:54,827 --> 01:31:58,501
He'll be there for you no matter what.

936
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:03,304
You think you can take care of him for me?

937
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:05,748
Ok, then.

938
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:20,496
Oh, no! Doctor Pork Chop is
attacking the haunted bakery!

939
01:32:21,404 --> 01:32:23,207
The ghosts are getting away!
Woody'll stop them!

940
01:32:23,799 --> 01:32:24,794
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

941
01:33:20,543 --> 01:33:22,043
Thanks, guys.

942
01:33:25,650 --> 01:33:27,883
Look, Mommy!
They're all playing together.

943
01:33:27,889 --> 01:33:30,473
Come on. Let's get some lunch.

944
01:33:44,165 --> 01:33:47,587
So long, partner.
