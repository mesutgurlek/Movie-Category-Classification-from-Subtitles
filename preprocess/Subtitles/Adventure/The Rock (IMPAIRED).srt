an act of cruelty.

I know, I'm rambling, I'm complaining.
I'm sorry. What's your news, baby?

Blue.

- When?

160

Just right now, when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world...

161
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,437
- and having it be an act of... cruelty.
- I meant it at the time.

162
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:14,121
Stanley, at the time? You said it
seven and a half seconds ago.

that there's never been an escape?

171
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:59,766
Ah, that's true. From 1936 until '63

there were 14 attempts.

188
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:53,396
Like being a caged animal.

189
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:56,047
Spend a couple of years

190

Something wrong with the tour?
- Tour's over, Bob.

It's an antimotion trembler device.

and nobody expects it.

- Thank you, sir.

We have achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity.

222
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:38,243
To this we must
now add resolve.

223
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:41,637
We'll be branded as traitors;
the gravest capital crime.

224
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,844
Punishable by death.

225
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:48,886
Couple hundred years ago, a few guys
named Washington, Jefferson and Adams...

226
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,846
were branded as traitors
by the British.

227
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:55,566
And now they're called
patriots.

228
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:57,603
In time, so shall we.

229
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:03,246
God willing, in less than 48 hours we
will evacuate this island in gunships...

230
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:06,842
under cover of hostages
and VX gas warheads.

231

Your destination:
a nonextradition-treaty country.

<i>You will each be paid a fee</i>
<i>of $ 1 million for services rendered.</i>

237
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:34,479

Get the Pentagon and call
the San Francisco office.

256
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:43,364
It seems Alcatraz
was just reopened.

I don't know, Frank.
Why don't you tell me?

270

There are a lot of very,
very worried people here, Frank.

271
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:34,517
I'll come straight
to the point.

Eighty-three Force
Reconnaissance Marines have died

Southern China? We never admitted
we sent troops into China.

275
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:45,357
Who is this?
Identify yourself.

White House Chief of Staff

you've probably got no fucking idea
what I'm talking about.

280
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,356
By your ninth birthday
I was runnin' black ops into China,

281
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:02,325
and my men were responsible
for over 200 enemy kills.

282

Now put some rigging tape
over Mr Sinclair's mouth.

283

- He's wasting my time.
- Ah, you want to continue, Frank?

284
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:10,723
Remember Operation
Desert Storm?

285

Those surgical hits made by our

it's lethal up to...
100 feet.

One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere...

What did Hummel mean by
your "countermeasure," General?

321
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:12,316
Standard poison is countered
by napalm. It burns it up,
consumes it upon detonation.

322
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:16,241
<i>Now, the problem with VX poison gas</i>
<i>is that it's designed specifically...</i>

where thermite plasma comes in.

<i>but they're still in the test phase.</i>

Hummel knows this.

to tell me what is goin' on.
- Nope.

869
00:59:19,993 --> 00:59:22,302
Listen, Stanley Goodspeed
is my boyfriend.

870

- Actually, he's my fiance. Where is he?
- Classified, lady.

871

Okay, well you just sit here

Shit.

877
00:59:55,033 --> 00:59:58,708
In my day, we did it all
with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

- Your day?
- Yes, didn't you read my resume?

- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.

891
01:00:47,193 --> 01:00:49,070
Sir, Raider One
is at the drop zone.

892
01:00:51,033 --> 01:00:54,343
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
I mean, he can't even snorkel.

- Good to go!

- [Muffled Words] Good to go!

895
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:13,189
All right, so the SDUs
have been deployed,
and the Eagles are in the water.

896
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:25,511
Major, I want the perimeter patrolled
to the west end of the island.

897

you lead the patrol.
- Aye, sir.

You've led us into a room with no exit.

Any ideas, Dillinger?

902

Figure it out soon.
We're sitting ducks.

903
01:02:47,193 --> 01:02:50,981
- Real tight on time.
- You stand by the door. Until I open it.

904
01:02:51,073 --> 01:02:54,145
I'd like to know how you plan
on accomplishing that.

Through here.

906
01:03:03,233 --> 01:03:06,782
- You're shitting me.
- I memorized the timing.

907
01:03:06,873 --> 01:03:09,023
I just hope
it hasn't been changed.

908

leave his side, but, uh...

- That's classified.

912
01:03:51,513 --> 01:03:54,186
Clear here, sir.
No motion sensors tripped.

913

Nothing.

I knew it.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.

You enjoying this?

925
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:15,189
Well, it's certainly
more enjoyable than my average day:

926
01:05:15,273 --> 01:05:19,425
reading philosophy,
avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

927

Though it's less of a problem these
days. Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

928
01:05:27,713 --> 01:05:30,830
We've got seismic activity

<i>some say the country.</i>

1036

It's no secret he kept microfilm files
on prominent Americans and Europeans:

1037
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:41,109
de Gaulle, British
members of Parliament,
even the Prime Minister.

the cloak-and-dagger stories.
Where does Mason fit in?

1040
01:14:47,993 --> 01:14:50,712
<i>Mason was the British operative</i>
<i>who stole the files.</i>

1041

But our Bureau agents caught him
at the Canadian border.

1042

<i>Of course, the British claimed</i>
<i>they'd never heard of him.</i>

And we held him without trial
until he gave up the microfilm.

1044
01:15:01,113 --> 01:15:02,990
But he never did.

1045
01:15:03,073 --> 01:15:06,145
I'm surprised Hoover didn't
use his daughter as leverage.

1046
01:15:06,233 --> 01:15:08,872
Hoover was dead in '72.
She wasn't born yet.

Today, well, it's
a different bureau.

1048

So you held this guy without trial
his whole life. No wonder he's pissed.

1049

This man knows our most intimate
secrets from the last half-century:

1050
01:15:20,953 --> 01:15:25,708
the alien landing at Roswell,
the truth about the JFK assassination.

1051
01:15:25,793 --> 01:15:29,263
And Mason's angry, he's lethal.
He's a trained killer.

1052
01:15:29,353 --> 01:15:34,347
And he is the only hope
that we have got.

Be seated. Gentlemen,
consider yourselves on ground alert.

If we receive launch authority,
your mission is...

1313
01:37:27,153 --> 01:37:29,872
the complete thermal destruction
of Alcatraz Island.

1314

Eighty-one American civilians

- Some solution.
- <i>You ended up here.</i>

02:02:05,821 --> 02:02:07,777
This is Goodspeed.

1608
02:02:09,901 --> 02:02:13,132
Are the hostages alive?

1609
02:02:13,221 --> 02:02:15,132
Every one of'em.

[Cheering]

1611
02:02:17,821 --> 02:02:22,133
Goodspeed, it's Womack.
What about Mason?

1612
02:02:29,341 --> 02:02:31,172
He's dead, sir.

1613
02:02:31,261 --> 02:02:34,970
- How? When?
- Just come and get me.

1614
02:02:37,341 --> 02:02:39,297
Womack tore up
your pardon, John.

1615
02:02:39,381 --> 02:02:42,851
[Chuckles]
But of course. I knew he would.

1616

1617
02:02:46,301 --> 02:02:48,861
If you can get
to the Pan Pacific Hotel,

1618
02:02:48,941 --> 02:02:51,819
there's clothes in my closet
and $200 in the Bible.

1619
02:02:51,901 --> 02:02:53,732
<i>Room 26.</i>

1620
02:02:53,821 --> 02:02:58,053
Well, it's been a long time
since I've said thank you to anybody.

1621
02:02:58,141 --> 02:03:00,052
But thank you.

1622
02:03:02,141 --> 02:03:06,771
Well, Stanley, uh, this is when
we go our separate ways, huh?

1623
02:03:08,381 --> 02:03:12,613
Uh... I'm sure you know the etymology
of your name, "Goodspeed."

1624
02:03:12,701 --> 02:03:16,933
Yeah, "Godspeed." To wish someone
a prosperous journey. Why?

1625
02:03:17,021 --> 02:03:20,491
Well, if you fancy
a journey,

1626
02:03:20,581 --> 02:03:23,698
I recommend
Fort Walton, Kansas.

1627
02:03:23,781 --> 02:03:25,772
I was thinking of Maui.

1628
02:03:25,861 --> 02:03:27,692
No.

1629
02:03:32,261 --> 02:03:35,094
Forget Maui.

1630

1633
02:03:48,901 --> 02:03:52,052
Is this what I think it is?

1634
02:03:53,581 --> 02:03:55,856
Mason?

1635
02:04:08,661 --> 02:04:10,492
Congratulations, Dr Goodspeed.
You did it.

1636
02:04:10,581 --> 02:04:12,412
Thank you, sir.

1637
02:04:12,501 --> 02:04:15,652
You know, for a while there,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

1638
02:04:15,741 --> 02:04:19,256
<i>Well done, son.</i>
<i>So, where's Mason?</i>

1639
02:04:19,341 --> 02:04:23,300
Vaporized.
Blown out to sea.

1640
02:04:23,381 --> 02:04:25,611
Blown out to sea, huh?

1641
02:04:25,701 --> 02:04:27,931
Yeah.

1642
02:04:28,021 --> 02:04:29,852
Poor bastard.

1643
02:04:33,061 --> 02:04:35,370
Goodspeed, where's Mason?
Where's his body?

1644
02:04:35,461 --> 02:04:37,850
I wanna see
that son of a bitch.

1645
02:04:37,941 --> 02:04:40,774
Vaporized, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1646
02:04:40,861 --> 02:04:45,935
What? Vaporized?
A body can vaporize?

1647
02:04:46,021 --> 02:04:49,218
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely, sir.
