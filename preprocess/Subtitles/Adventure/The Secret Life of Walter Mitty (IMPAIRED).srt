00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,302
Perhaps I can contact you

167
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:06,005
possibly through
my poetry falcon.

00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:16,182
Do you think if I hit him with
a paper clip, would he move?

172
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,316
Yeah, I don't know.

173
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,086
Do it. Oh, hello.

174
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,655
I actually threw
a toner box at him once.

175
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:23,856
Yeah? Did he move?

176
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,058
No, I-I missed.

00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,194

Uh, yeah.

We're gonna be evaluated.

They won't be able to.

Yeah.

It's tricky and bewildering.

00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,247
I should evaluate you;
you should evaluate me.

they'll let us do that.

Hey, how long has
this neg roll been here,

201
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,323
out in the open?

202
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,462
It's a Sean O'Connell.

203
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,830
It came in this morning.

204
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,098
There's a present, too.

205
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,101
He sent you a present
on your desk.

206

Sean O'Connell
still shoots on film.

207

That results for me
in a man crush.

Hey, you want to mount these?

209

A 100-year-old dude came
in a little hat.

to, uh,<i> LIFE Online,</i>

the privilege
of publishing what will be

with the executives here.

and most rich.
Okay.

286

So our cover will probably
be the most famous ever

287
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:48,347
because it really will have the
big quintessence of all time.

Um, it's not really
that easy with him.

why don't I check with Peg?

340
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,616
I know she just processed
a check for him,

341
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,418

his payout, maybe,

385

is to work backwards.

scatter them so they seem unrelated.

00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:57,295
Why?

655
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,131
No, I just, um...
I used to...

656
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,100
I was kind of into the scene.

657
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,868
Like...
Oh.

658
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,069
The skateboard scene?

659
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,105
Yeah.
Wow.

660
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,907
Hi, Peg.

661
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,241
Yeah, Sean O'Connell.

662
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:12,276
We actually, uh,
need to find him.

663
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,380
Uh-huh. Yes.

664
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:17,015
If you could hurry.

665
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:18,817
Kickflip.

666
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,218
Yeah.

667
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:22,854
It's a good one
for the repertoire.

668
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:24,255
I'm Walter.

669
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,090
Rich.

670
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:28,593
Yeah, we think he might know
something or have an asset we need.

671
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:30,128
You know, you just got to get

672
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,463
a little more snap,
get that thing up there.

673
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:33,932
Want me to, uh,

674
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,200
show you something?

675
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,167
Sure.

676
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,171
Here.

677
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,307
Like your trucks.

678
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:45,076
Thanks.

679
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,478
Check this out.

680
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,880
Know about the flick?

681
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,548
Uh-huh.

682
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:53,951
Yeah, we-we-we've finished
processing his April work order.

683
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,160
Yes, it's kind of important.

684
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:03,460
Okay.

685
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,433
Did you forward the job 1090's?

686
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:11,536
Or his last salary?

687
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,037
Wow!

688
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,404
Okay.

689
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,976
Wow.

690
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,310
Here you go.
That was awesome.

691
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,179
So it could be either place.

692
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,313
Thanks, Walter.
Okay.

693
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,482
Thanks, Peg.
All right.

694
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,584
Hey. So, um...

695
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,386
Sean's definitely
not in New York.

696
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,154
Peg said she sent multiples.

697
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:32,390
I don't know if you know
how it works with him.

698
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:35,193
She sends copies 'cause we never
know where's he's going to be.

699
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:38,396
And this week, she sent 1090's
to Princeton, New Jersey.

700
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,632
Oh, great. Train ride.

701
00:31:40,633 --> 00:31:42,100
And one to Greenland.

702
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,468
(CHUCKLING):
Just in case.

703
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:46,337
Greenland, the country?

704
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:50,942
That's, um... you can't take
a train there.

705
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:52,343
No. (CHUCKLES)

706
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,245
Well, maybe he's in Jersey.
Yeah.

707
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,347
Yeah, is your phone done
buffering with that ship's name?

708
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:58,016
Oh. Um, yes.

709
00:31:58,017 --> 00:31:59,484
Look. Here it is.

710
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,486
Nuuk, Greenland.

711
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:02,687
That's...

712
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,355
Yeah. (LAUGHS)
(CHUCKLES)

713
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,157
Come on, that's a good lead.

714
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,959
You should follow that up.

715
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,628
Yeah, follow it up in Greenland.

716
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:13,097
Yeah. Why not? Go.

717
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,699
Crack the case.

718
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,401
Listen to your wallet.

719
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:18,369
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

720
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:22,307
Sorry. It's my, um...
it's Phil again.

721
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,342
Um, maybe he fell
down a well or something.

722
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,443
Maybe I should get it.

723
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,978
Hey, buddy. Here.

724
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,680
Rich, Rich, Rich!
Not so fast. Here, here, here.

725
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:30,982
Take that. Take that.

726
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:32,250
Yeah.

727
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:33,685
I understand.

728
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:35,053
Okay.

729
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:36,554
Bye.

730
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,656
He did fall down a well.

731
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,658
But I don't care.

732
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:43,328
I just want to be with you,
you know?

733
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,429
Really?

734
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,097
Let's run away together.

735
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,132
Let's make every moment count,
starting now.

736
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,134
Sweet.

737
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,669
Can I tell you something?

738
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,769
Anything.

739
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,075
I have that
Benjamin Buttons thing.

740
00:32:57,076 --> 00:33:00,712
Where you get old
but smaller or whatever

741
00:33:00,713 --> 00:33:03,214
and become a gradual
old baby or something.

742
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,449
I didn't see the movie,

743
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,184
so I don't really know
how it works.

744
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:07,385
But I have it.

745
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:10,421
We can still build
a life together.

746
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,089
Cool.

747
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,638
I like your snappy little suit.

748
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:30,742
WALTER (WEAKLY):
I bought it at a doll store.

749
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:33,711
Oh, cool.

750
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:38,182
My little heart
is no bigger than a quarter,

751
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:42,020
but it's as full as Fort Knox.

752
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,489
You're the bravest man
I've ever known.

753
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,491
I love you, baby.

754
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:49,727
Not like "baby," like,

755
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:54,197
because you look
like a little weird baby-man.

756
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,467
I get it.

757
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:59,604
Thank you for such
a wonderful life.

758
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:02,673
You're... I...

759
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:03,808
Shh.

760
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:06,744
Just nestle in here and die.

761
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:09,213
(EXHALING)

762
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,649
Good-bye, Walter.

763
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,584
Good-bye, Walter.
<i>Bye! Walter!</i>

764
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,286
CHERYL:
Walter.

765
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:16,721
Walter.

766
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,289
Bye.
Oh. Sorry.

767
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,490
I was just...

768
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,426
Where do you go?

769
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:24,228
I-I started, uh, thinking about...
Oh, no, it's okay.

770
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,497
I was probably boring you
about my broken refrigerator.

771
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,766
No.
Rich!

772
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,669
My son's running into
the street. I-I have to go.

773
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,438
Yeah.

774
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:36,774
Oh, I wanted to tell you, um,
that song, "Major Tom,"

775
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,843
back there,
when the beard guy was...

776
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:41,646
he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

777
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:46,284
That song is about courage
and going into the unknown.

778
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:47,951
It's a cool song.

779
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,490
Rich!

780
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,269
Yo.

781
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,472
Where's my thing?

782
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:09,507
Oh, it's in a silver bath.

783
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,476
(STAMMERING)

784
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,544
I don't even know what language
you're speaking right now.

785
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,413
You know, you got to
take me seriously.

786
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:17,281
I got a magazine to execute here.

787
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,317
And bosses to answer to.

788
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:22,353
So next time I see you,
I see that picture. Okay?

789
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,622
Hey, dream machine.

790
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,158
Hello?

791
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,226
I just... I-I want proof
you heard me.

792
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,596
Next time I see you...

793
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,233
You see the picture.

794
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:37,601
(SNAPS FINGERS) That's right.

795

(SIGHS)

796
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:46,177
Any luck, Hernando?

797
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:48,446
I turned the place
upside down... 25's not here.

798
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,547
I searched Receiving, too, man.

799
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,252
This never happens.

800
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:55,887
I'm telling you,

801
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:57,420
it's nowhere, Walter.

802
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,560
I mean, maybe he didn't
even send it.

803
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:04,928
Maybe it's still on him.

804
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,665
Walter?

805
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,626

with my dad,

on a Tuesday,

I'm just going to get out.

1474
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:12,080
Hey, Mom.
Hi, honey.

1475
01:14:12,081 --> 01:14:14,116
Oh, Walter,
you gotta tip these guys.

1476
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,185
We got the piano back safe, Mom.

1477
01:14:16,186 --> 01:14:19,488
You back from your work trip?

1478
01:14:19,489 --> 01:14:21,089
WALTER:
Yeah, this morning.

1479
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,090
MOTHER:
Hungry?

1480
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:24,460
WALTER:
Mm-hmm.

1481
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:25,928
I'm making soup.
Thanks.

1482
01:14:25,929 --> 01:14:27,749
Hey, tipping time now.
(WHISPERS): Let's go.

1483
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:35,169
This is all I got.

1484
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:39,508
MOVER: Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1485
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:40,843
ODESSA: All right, thanks, everybody.

1486
01:14:40,844 --> 01:14:42,211
For all your hard work.

1487
01:14:42,212 --> 01:14:43,212
MOVER:
Yeah. We appreciate it, ma'am.

1488
01:14:43,213 --> 01:14:44,213
ODESSA: You did great.

1489
01:14:44,214 --> 01:14:45,981
You just let yourself out.

1490
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,842
He's good for this.
MOVER: What'd I tell you?

1491
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:51,086
MOTHER: You gonna
stay for dinner?

1492
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:52,955
ODESSA:
Oh, Mom, I'd love to.

1493
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:54,523
I think I'm just really wiped out

1494
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:56,191
after supervising moving
that thing all day.

1495
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:59,528
I think I just need to go
to yoga and then just crash.

1496
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:00,863
MOTHER:
What is it? A class?

1497
01:15:00,864 --> 01:15:02,865
Yeah, it's yoga.
It's a class.

1498
01:15:02,866 --> 01:15:05,067
I go to the hot kind,
where they heat the room.

1499
01:15:05,068 --> 01:15:07,202
Have you heard of that?
Mm. Sure.

1500
01:15:07,203 --> 01:15:08,537
You have?
It's good for you.

1501
01:15:08,538 --> 01:15:09,738
ODESSA:
Oh, It's great for you.

1502
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:11,206
You just get it
all out of your system.

1503
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:12,574
You just get all your sweat out,

1504
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:14,076
you just get everything,
all your fear.

1505
01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:15,978
I'm waiting on a call
about an audition, and I just...

1506
01:15:15,979 --> 01:15:17,079
MOTHER:
Ooh, that<i> Grease</i> show?

1507
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,580
Yeah.
Rizzo?

1508
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:19,815
ODESSA: Yeah. I'm really
excited about it.

1509
01:15:19,816 --> 01:15:21,049
MOTHER: I haven't
even heard of that.

1510
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:22,951
ODESSA: But I just
gotta get it... I just...

1511
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:24,219
what's good about this is that
I just don't worry about it.

1512
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,220
Just get out of my head.

1513
01:15:25,221 --> 01:15:26,889
MOTHER:
Is that good, too?

1514
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,624
ODESSA: I feel like it's good
in a class like this.

1515
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:31,093
I mean, I'm not going to get
paid for it, which is fine.

1516
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:32,728
It's not about money.
Ah, wonderful.

1517
01:15:32,729 --> 01:15:34,196
And I feel like, you know,

1518
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:35,864
it's just for kids,

1519
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:38,734
but I think it's important
for them to start early.

1520
01:15:38,735 --> 01:15:40,068
I'm really thrilled, Mom.

1521
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:42,571
You know, I think I'm just
going to enjoy it.

1522
01:15:42,572 --> 01:15:44,273
Just standing in front
of people and talking.

1523
01:15:44,274 --> 01:15:46,909
MOTHER: You'll be
good at that.
Yeah.

1524
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:49,011
You'll really be good at that.
I think so, too, Mom.

1525
01:15:49,012 --> 01:15:52,147
Hey, Mom?
MOTHER: Yeah.

1526
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:56,250
Did somebody take a picture
of your piano, like, a week ago?

1527
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:00,889
MOTHER:
I did.

1528
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,256
With Sean's camera.

1529
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:08,196
Sean O'Connell's camera?

1530
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:09,964
Yeah, he came to visit.

1531
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,668
Mom, what?

1532
01:16:12,669 --> 01:16:14,937
Yeah.

1533
01:16:14,938 --> 01:16:16,872
He wanted to know about
your work schedule,

1534
01:16:16,873 --> 01:16:18,907
when you left,
when you came home.

1535
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:21,276
He said you really
understood<i> LIFE.</i>

1536
01:16:21,277 --> 01:16:23,278
He was really interested
in your work.

1537
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:25,213
You...

1538
01:16:25,214 --> 01:16:27,049
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

1539
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:28,183
I told you.

1540
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:29,918
I told you in the produce aisle.

1541
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,354
I remember that.

1542
01:16:32,355 --> 01:16:34,056
Oh, maybe you were...

1543
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:35,857
Odessa, what is it you call it

1544
01:16:35,858 --> 01:16:37,926
when he goes into
one of his little places?

1545
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:39,828
Oh, zoned out.

1546
01:16:39,829 --> 01:16:41,929
You do that now and then.

1547
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:44,832
MOTHER:
What's the matter?

1548
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:49,071
I got fired.

1549
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:50,939
I lost a picture of his.

1550
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,808
Can you find it?

1551
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:55,077
No, I don't know where he is.

1552
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:59,247
He's some... someplace
with warlocks or...

1553
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:01,917
Warlords.

1554
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:03,685
No, warlocks.

1555
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:05,354
No. Warlords.

1556
01:17:05,355 --> 01:17:09,024
Sean said he had to meet
with warlords very soon,

1557
01:17:09,025 --> 01:17:11,860
and maybe he would take my cake

1558
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:13,362
so that he could get permission

1559
01:17:13,363 --> 01:17:15,964
to trek through
the wilds and places.

1560
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,966
He said he wants to
photograph snow leopards.

1561
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,101
How about that?

1562
01:17:19,102 --> 01:17:20,434
Who?

1563
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:32,446
"Ungoverned Afghanistan."

1564
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,719
MOTHER:
Mm-hmm. That's where Sean is.

1565
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,889
Crazy Afghanistan.
Yeah.

1566
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:43,692
In the upper Himalayas.
Mm-hmm.

1567
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:46,194
They can't let you go.

1568
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:49,698
You were Sean's partner.

1569
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:51,800
He told me that you
were the person

1570
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:53,368
who worked the hardest

1571
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:57,505
to make sure his work was
realized the way he wished.

1572
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:04,945
You finish his work.

on this helicopter

with a very drunk pilot,

1899
