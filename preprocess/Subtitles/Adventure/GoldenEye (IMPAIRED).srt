<i>Thank you.</i>

00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:30,233
<i>Yes, after the distress signal,
your helicopter took off</i>

263
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,144
<i>and the Russians
had three MiGs intercept it.</i>

264

<i>What do you think the base is used for?</i>

265

<i>We suspected it might be
the ground station</i>

<i>for a secret space-based
weapon called Go|denEye, but...</i>

<i>Our statistical analysis saw they had
neither the finance nor technology.</i>

<i>Are these pictures live?</i>

270

<i>Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.</i>

<i>Two of the MiGs are down.</i>

<i>It looks like the third went into the dish.</i>

288

<i>What do you think?</i>

289
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:50,546
<i>No lights. Not one single
electric light on in a 30-mile radius.</i>

290
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,598
<i>- EMP?
- It would explain the MiGs and satellites.</i>

291
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,473
<i>- And the blackout.
- Electromagnetic pulse.</i>

292
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:02,558
<i>- A satellite weapon developed by the...
- Americans and Soviets in the Cold War.</i>

293

296
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:20,033
<i>The idea being to knock out the enemy's
communications before they can retaliate.</i>

297
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,623
<i>So, Golden Eye exists.</i>

298
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,335
<i>Yes.</i>

299
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,876
<i>- Could this be an accident?
- No. The helicopter.</i>

300
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,422
<i>For stealing the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.</i>

301
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:37,099
<i>Setting off the blast would
wipe out any trace of the crime.</i>

00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,603
<i>I know the Russian fail-safe systems.</i>

304
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:49,859
<i>You just don't walk in and ask for the keys
to the bomb. You need the access codes.</i>

305
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,818
<i>{punches keys}</i>

306
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,614
<i>There had to be an insider.</i>

307
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,999
<i>At least one person
probably knows who it is.</i>

308
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,719
<i>{animal whimpering}</i>

309
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,056
<i>{barking and whining}</i>

310
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:35,150
<i>Very well, sir. Thank you. Good night.</i>

311
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:41,702
<i>The prime minister's talked to Moscow. It
was "an accident on a training exercise".</i>

312
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,959
<i>Governments change.
The lies stay the same.</i>

313
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,044
<i>What else do we know about Janus?</i>

314
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,506
<i>Top-flight arms dealers,
headquartered in St Petersburg.</i>

315
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,551
<i>Restocked the Iraqis during the Gulf War.</i>

316
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:57,005
<i>The head man's unreliably
described. No photographs.</i>

317
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,217
<i>The woman, Onatopp,</i>

318
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,472
<i>is our only confirmed contact.</i>

319
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:06,268
<i>- Would you care for a drink?
- Thank you.</i>

320
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,394
<i>- Your predecessor kept some cognac...
- I prefer bourbon.</i>

321
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,229
<i>- Ice?
- Yes.</i>

322
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:25,875
<i>We pulled the files on whoever may have
had access or authority at Severnaya.</i>

323
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:30,083
<i>The top name on the list's
an old friend of yours, I understand.</i>

324
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,340
<i>Ourumov. They made him a general.</i>

325
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:39,389
<i>He sees himself as the next
"iron man of Russia".</i>

326
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:43,434
<i>Our political analysts say
he doesn't ﬁt the profile of a traitor.</i>

327
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,514
<i>Are these the same analysts who said
that Go|denEye couldn't exist?</i>

328
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:52,644
<i>Who said the helicopter posed no threat
and wasn't worth following?</i>

329
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,905
<i>You don't like me, Bond.
You don't like my methods.</i>

330
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:01,953
<i>You think I'm an accountant, more
interested in numbers than your instincts.</i>

331
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,414
<i>- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.</i>

332
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,746
<i>Because I think you're
a sexist, misogynist dinosaur,</i>

333
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,921
<i>a relic of the Cold War, whose
boyish charms, though wasted on me,</i>

334
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:15,591
<i>obviously appealed to that
young woman I sent out to evaluate you.</i>

335
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,920
<i>- Point taken.
- Not quite, O07.</i>

336
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,723
<i>If you think I don't have the balls
to send a man out to die,</i>

337
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,176
<i>your instincts are dead wrong.</i>

338
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:28,225
<i>I've no compunction
about sending you to your death.</i>

339
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:32,897
<i>But I won't do it on a whim, even
with your cavalier attitude towards life.</i>

340
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,606
<i>I want you to find GoldenEye.</i>

341
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,034
<i>Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.</i>

342
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,658
<i>If you come across Ourumov,
guilty or not,</i>

343
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:50,039
<i>don't run off on a vendetta. Avenging
Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.</i>

344
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:55,040
<i>- You didn't get him killed.
- Neither did you. Don't make it personal.</i>

345
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,879
<i>Never.</i>

346
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:03,385
<i>Bond...</i>

347
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,886
<i>Come back alive.</i>

348
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,524
<i>{military march}</i>

349
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,714
<i>{knock on door}</i>

350
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,762
<i>Good morning, General Ourumov.</i>

351
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:55,187
<i>Defence Minister Mishkin... Gentlemen.</i>

352
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,065
<i>Please, deliver your report.</i>

353
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:06,032
<i>As you know, 72 hours ago, a secret
weapons system - codename GoldenEye -</i>

354
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,204
<i>was detonated over Severnaya.</i>

355
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,917
<i>As head of Space Division,
I personally undertook the investigation.</i>

356
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:17,589
<i>I have concluded this crime was
committed by Siberian separatists</i>

357
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,291
<i>seeking to create political unrest.</i>

358
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,846
<i>Regrettably, the peaceful work and the
hard-currency earnings of Severnaya</i>

359
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,765
<i>have been set back by several years.</i>

360
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,136
<i>Therefore, I tender my resignation.</i>

361
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,729
<i>{protests}</i>

362
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:37,733
<i>It seems the council does not want
your head, Arkady Grigorovich.</i>

363
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,278
<i>Merely your assurance that
there are no other Go|denEyes.</i>

364
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,981
<i>I can give you that assurance,
Defence Minister.</i>

365
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:47,068
<i>And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?</i>

366
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,833
<i>I was aware only of the one.
Boris Grishenko.</i>

367
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,040
<i>There was a girl also, whose body
was not among the dead.</i>

368
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,339
<i>Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.
A level-two programmer.</i>

369
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:03,092
<i>I will investigate immediately.</i>

370
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:08,553
<i>It would seem presumptuous to blame
this incident on Siberian separatists</i>

371
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:13,057
<i>before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.</i>

372
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:17,352
<i>- Do you agree?
- Yes, Defence Minister.</i>

373
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,110
<i>Thank you for bringing it to my attention.</i>

374
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,530
<i>That will be all.</i>

375
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,880
<i>Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing?</i>

376
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,836
<i>Hunting.</i>

377
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,388
<i>Right. Now pay attention, O07.</i>

378
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,465
<i>First, your new car.</i>

379
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:56,138
<i>BMW. Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar.</i>

380
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,851
<i>Self-destruct system. And, naturally,
all the usual refinements.</i>

381
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,563
<i>Now, this I'm particularly proud of.</i>

382
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,570
<i>Behind the headlights, Stinger missiles.</i>

383
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,320
<i>Excellent. Just the thing
for unwinding after a rough day.</i>

384
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:19,082
<i>Need I remind you, O07, that you have
a license to kill, not break the traffic laws.</i>

385
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,204
<i>- I wouldn't think of it.
- Good.</i>

386
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:25,337
<i>Right. Let's get on
to more practical matters.</i>

387
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:31,431
<i>A typical leather belt.
Male, size 34, buckle, notch.</i>

388
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,760
<i>Have you finished?</i>

389
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,348
<i>- Yes.
- Good.</i>

390
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,432
<i>- A typical belt...
- Q, I'm familiar with that device.</i>

391
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:44,860
<i>Not one with a 75-foot
rappelling cord built into the buckle.</i>

392
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,155
<i>Fire, and out shoots a piton,</i>

393
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:52,194
<i>followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.</i>

394
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:55,530
<i>I see. And what if I need
additional support?</i>

395
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,207
<i>It's tested for one, O07.</i>

396
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:06,006
<i>Flight 878 to St Petersburg.</i>

397
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,507
<i>X-ray document scanner.</i>

398
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,885
<i>A pen. This is a class 4 grenade.</i>

399
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:17,518
<i>Three clicks arms the four-second fuse.</i>

400
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,809
<i>Another three disarms it.</i>

401
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,893
<i>How long did you say the fuse was?</i>

402
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,570
<i>Oh, grow up, O07.</i>

403
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:32,776
<i>- "The pen is mightier than the sword."
- Thanks to me, it is.</i>

404
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:36,912
<i>Look, let's ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.</i>

405
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:41,663
<i>Here we are. Sorry about this, Fred.
One, two, three.</i>

406
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:51,047
<i>- Don't say it.
- The writing's on the wall?</i>

407
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,179
<i>Along with the rest of him.</i>

408
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,766
<i>Now, 007, do please try and return...</i>

409
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:01,054
<i>{clattering}</i>

410
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,731
<i>Do try and return some of this
equipment in pristine order.</i>

411
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,730
<i>Don't touch that! That's my lunch.</i>

412
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,925
<i>In London, April's a spring month.</i>

413
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,678
<i>Oh, yeah? What are you -
the weatherman?</i>

414
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,844
<i>For cryin' out loud.
Another stiff-assed Brit,</i>

415
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,350
<i>with your secret codes and passwords.</i>

416
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,684
<i>One of these days you guys
are gonna learn just to drop it.</i>

417
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,607
<i>Come on. My car's over there.</i>

418
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,999
<i>- After you.
- Thank you.</i>

419
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:13,088
<i>- Like you said, drop it.
- All right.</i>

420
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:16,797
<i>In London, April's a spring month.
In St Petersburg, we freeze our butts off.</i>

421
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,758
<i>- Close enough for government work?
- No.</i>

422
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,974
<i>- Show me the rose.
- Please, no.</i>

423
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,730
<i>All right, all right, all right.</i>

424
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,532
<i>- "Ml-iffy"?
- Third wife.</i>

425
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,537
<i>- Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.</i>

426
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,618
<i>- That's a nice move.
- Nice car.</i>

427
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:51,831
<i>Hasn't let me down yet. She's an ugly
little bitch, but she gets you there.</i>

428
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,633
<i>Hey, Bond. Do you do any gardening?</i>

429
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:59,218
<i>{announcement in Russian

<i>{PA system} St Petersburg express

<i>Can you hand me that wrench, Jimmy?</i>

432
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,815
<i>- So what do you know about Janus?
- Zilch. Zipsky.</i>

433
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:21,406
<i>No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.</i>

434
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,071
<i>KGB, military. Screwdriver.</i>

435
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:30,253
<i>Rumour has it he lives on
one of those old Soviet missile trains.</i>

436
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:34,457
<i>That armoured stuff they used to
run around so we couldn't target 'em.</i>

437
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,881
<i>Wanna hand me that hammer, Jimbo?</i>

438
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,421
<i>No, the bigger one. The sledge.</i>

439
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,843
<i>Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don't find this guy. He finds you.</i>

440
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,808
<i>Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.</i>

<i>- Who is the competition?
- An ex-KGB guy. Tough mother.</i>

443
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,234
<i>Limps on his right leg. Name's Zukovsky.</i>

<i>- Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah.</i>

445

00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,688
<i>Yes?</i>

447
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:38,112
<i>- Are these all you have?
- How many do you want?</i>

448
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,367
<i>24 for the American school,
11 for the Swedish.</i>

449
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:48,824
<i>IBM-compatible with 500 meg
hard drives, CD-ROM and 14.4 modems.</i>

450
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:51,959
<i>- You pay dollars?
- Of course.</i>

451
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,202
<i>If madam requires a demonstration...</i>

452
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:58,499
<i>Madam requires one demonstration
model and a quiet place to test it.</i>

453
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:14,557
<i>Natalya.</i>

454
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,609
<i>{typing}</i>

455
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:35,119
<i>- Is everything satisfactory?
- Everything except the interruption.</i>

456
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,974
<i>{Wade} Let me get this straight, Jimmy.</i>

457
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,805
<i>You shot him in the leg,
you stole his car, you took his girl.</i>

458
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:57,232
<i>And now you want Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus?</i>

459
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,819
<i>- {Bond} Yes.
- Are you gonna appeal to his heart?</i>

460
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:04,023
<i>- No. His wallet.
- That might work.</i>

461
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,575
<i>OK. Showtime.</i>

462
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,575
<i>Valentin operates
out of building number 23.</i>

463
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,748
<i>Are you sure you wanna do this?</i>

464
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:22,376
<i>Last guy who dropped in uninvited went
home air freight - in very small boxes.</i>

465
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,507
<i>Make sure they send me home first class.</i>

466
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,601
<i>- {screams}
- Natalya! It's me! It's Boris!</i>

467
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,732
<i>It's Boris. It's Boris. Hello.</i>

468
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,156
<i>Shh-shh-shh.</i>

469
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:33,453
<i>Another morning shot to hell.</i>

470
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:39,368
<i>Free-market economy!
I swear it will be the end of me.</i>

471
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:47,130
<i>Walther PPK, 7.65mm.</i>

472
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:52,431
<i>Only three men I know use such a gun.
I believe I've killed two of them.</i>

473
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:56,386
<i>- Lucky me.
- I think not.</i>

474
00:59:57,052 --> 01:00:00,056
<i>Ooh-ahh</i>

475
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,732
<i>{Russian accent} And if you love him</i>

476
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:03,980
<i>Love him</i>

477
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:07,029
<i>Oh, be so proud of him</i>

478
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,196
<i>Of him</i>

479
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,990
<i>Cos after all</i>

480
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,569
<i>He's just a man</i>

481
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,786
<i>{tunelessly} Stand by your man...</i>

482
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,004
<i>James Bond.</i>

483
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,959
<i>Charming, sophisticated secret agent.</i>

484
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,670
<i>"Shaken, but not stirred."</i>

485
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:36,634
<i>I see you haven't lost your
delicate sense of humour, Valentin.</i>

486
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,102
<i>Or your need for an audience.</i>

487
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:43,936
<i>- Who's strangling the cat?
- Strangling a cat?</i>

488
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,234
<i>Stand by your man</i>

489
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,824
<i>That is Irina, my mistress.</i>

490
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,737
<i>Very talented girl.</i>

491
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,281
<i>Irina! Take a hike!</i>

492
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:09,087
<i>So, Mr Bond, what is it that brings you
to my neighbourhood? Hm?</i>

493
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:14,471
<i>Still working for MI6, or
have you joined the 21 st century?</i>

494
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,265
<i>I hear the new M is a lady.</i>

495
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,344
<i>I want you to do me a favour.</i>

496
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:25,733
<i>He wants me to do him a favour!</i>

497
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:32,816
<i>My knee aches every single day.
Twice as bad when it is cold.</i>

498
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:36,528
<i>Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country?</i>

499
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:39,121
<i>- Tell him, Dimitri.
- It depends...</i>

500
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:40,869
<i>Silence!</i>

501
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:44,417
<i>For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.</i>

502
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:49,293
<i>Surely you must have realised the skill
was not to hit your knee, but to...</i>

503
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,712
<i>Miss the rest of you.</i>

504
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:57,423
<i>- So why did you not kill me?
- Call it professional courtesy.</i>

505
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,768
<i>Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.</i>

506
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:08,604
<i>Kirov‘s funeral parlour,
four o'clock this afternoon.</i>

507
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:11,937
<i>200 pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.</i>

508
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:15,487
<i>Your man drives the hearse in,
the money's exchanged,</i>

509
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,113
<i>their man drives the hearse out.</i>

510
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,912
<i>Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.</i>

511
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:24,996
<i>Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.</i>

512
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,123
<i>Your money.</i>

513
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:29,921
<i>And what do I owe
for this accommodation?</i>

514
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,633
<i>I want you to set me up... with Janus.</i>

515
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:38,589
<i>- What has he done to deserve you?
- Stole a helicopter.</i>

516
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:42,017
<i>- I have six.
- Three. None that fly.</i>

517
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:46,145
<i>- Who's counting?
- These aren't just criminals but traitors.</i>

518
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:51,310
<i>They used the chopper to steal a nuclear
weapon. Killed a lot of innocent Russians.</i>

519
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:54,112
<i>- What do you expect from a Cossack?
- Who?</i>

520
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,946
<i>This Janus - I never met the man,
but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.</i>

521
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:02,363
<i>The group that worked
for the Nazis, Second World War.</i>

522
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,039
<i>You know your history.
At the end of the war,</i>

523
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,710
<i>the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria,</i>

524
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:13,256
<i>believing they would join them
and wage war against the communists.</i>

525
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:16,961
<i>But the British betrayed them,
sent them back to Stalin,</i>

526
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,886
<i>who promptly had them all shot.</i>

527
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,556
<i>Women, children, families.</i>

528
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,810
<i>Not exactly our ﬁnest hour.</i>

529
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,982
<i>Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.</i>

530
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:34,103
<i>I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.</i>

531
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:38,531
<i>- You meet me tonight at the Grand Hotel.
- And then you and I are even and...</i>

532
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,743
<i>- he owes me one.
- Precisely.</i>

533
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,050
<i>You don't need the gun... Commander.</i>

534
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:51,229
<i>That depends on
your definition of safe sex.</i>

535
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,320
<i>That's close enough.</i>

536
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,939
<i>Not for what I have in mind.</i>

537
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,078
<i>{Xenia moans with pleasure}</i>

538
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:20,125
<i>{Xenia shrieks}</i>

539
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:27,553
<i>Oh, you think you can hurt me?</i>

540
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:30,135
<i>{laughs}</i>

541
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:38,443
<i>- {Bond gasps for breath}
- {Xenia shrieks with pleasure}</i>

542
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,991
<i>You think you can break me?</i>

543
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,128
<i>{Bond roars}</i>

544
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:00,002
<i>{shrieking} Ah, yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

545
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,256
<i>{Xenia yelps}</i>

546
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:09,474
<i>No, no, no.</i>

547
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,018
<i>No more foreplay.</i>

548
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,687
<i>Take me to Janus.</i>

549
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:15,763
<i>Buliatch!</i>

550
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:32,656
<i>- This is it?
- Yes.</i>

551
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:38,458
<i>Well, I must say, I've had a lovely evening.</i>

552
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:42,541
<i>- You?
- Once again, the pleasure was all yours.</i>

553
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:47,004
<i>- You'll understand if I don't call.
- I won't lose sleep over it.</i>

554
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,387
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

555
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,909
<i>{Clink}</i>

556
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,582
<i>Hello, James.</i>

557
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:31,491
<i>- Alec?
- Back from the dead.</i>

558
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:36,079
<i>No longer just an anonymous star
on the Memorial Wall at MI6.</i>

559
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:40,785
<i>What's the matter, James?
No glib remark? No pithy comeback?</i>

560
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:44,671
<i>- Why?
- {laughs}</i>

561
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:48,880
<i>Hilarious question. Particularly from you.</i>

562
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:54,799
<i>Did you ever ask why we toppled
all those dictators and regimes,</i>

563
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:59,227
<i>only to come home - "Well done!
Good job, but sorry, old boy."</i>

564
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,559
<i>"Everything you risked
your life for has changed."</i>

565
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,360
<i>- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you'd say that.</i>

566
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:09,980
<i>James Bond, Her Majesty's loyal terrier,</i>

567
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:12,316
<i>defender of the so-called faith.</i>

568
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,867
<i>Oh, please, James, put it away.</i>

569
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:18,700
<i>It's insulting to think
I haven't anticipated your every move.</i>

570
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,247
<i>Yes.</i>

571
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:30,008
<i>- I trusted you, Alec.
- Trust. What a quaint idea.</i>

572
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:35,634
<i>How did the MI6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?</i>

573
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:39,388
<i>Once again, your faith
is misplaced. They knew.</i>

574
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:41,845
<i>We're both orphans, James.</i>

575
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:46,186
<i>But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident,</i>

576
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:49,735
<i>mine survived the British betrayal
and Stalin's execution squads.</i>

577
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:55,067
<i>But my father couldn't let himself
or my mother live with the shame of it.</i>

578
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:59,370
<i>MI6 figured I was too young to remember.</i>

579
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:02,536
<i>And in one of life's little ironies,</i>

580
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:05,919
<i>the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal</i>

581
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,706
<i>caused the father to kill
himself and his wife.</i>

582
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:15,171
<i>Hence Janus, the two-faced
Roman god, come to life.</i>

583
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:18,223
<i>It wasn't God who gave me this face.</i>

584
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:21,973
<i>It was you, setting the timers
for three minutes instead of six.</i>

585
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:27,433
<i>- Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
- No. You're supposed to die for me.</i>

586
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:32,441
<i>By the WHY</i>

587
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:37,701
<i>I did think of asking you to join
my little scheme, but somehow I knew</i>

588
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:40,779
<i>007's loyalty was always
to the mission,</i>

589
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,998
<i>never to his friend.</i>

590
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:47,752
<i>Closing time, James. Last call.</i>

591
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,625
<i>{gunshot}</i>

<i>- Who are you?
- I work for the British government.</i>

622
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:58,245

623
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,667
<i>Boris. Boris Grishenko.</i>

- No.</i>

<i>What, no small talk?</i>

634
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,748
<i>No chitchat?</i>

635
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:48,466
<i>That's the trouble. No one has time to do
a really sinister interrogation any more.</i>

636
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:52,466
<i>- It's a lost art.
- Your sense of humour doesn't slay me.</i>

637
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:55,135
<i>- Where is the Golden Eye?
- I assumed you had it.</i>

638
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:58,851
<i>I have an English spy,
a programmer and a helicopter...</i>

639
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:02,524
<i>- That's how your traitor wants it to look.
- Who attacked Severnaya?</i>

640
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,321
<i>- Who had the codes?
- The penalty for terrorism is still death.</i>

641
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:10,650
<i>- And for treason?
- Stop it, both of you! Stop it.</i>

642
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,236
<i>You're like... boys with toys.</i>

643

<i>It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.</i>

<i>I saw him do it.</i>

645
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:28,968
<i>- Are you certain it was Ourumov?
- Yes.</i>

646
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,589
<i>He killed everyone,
then stole the Go|denEye.</i>

647
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:37,051
<i>And why would he do that?</i>

648
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,808
<i>There is another satellite.</i>

649
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:45,188
<i>Another Golden Eye.</i>

650
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:48,855
<i>Thank you, Miss Simonova.</i>

651
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:52,408
<i>What did you say about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr Bond?</i>

<i>I've seen this gun
in the hand of our enemy.</i>

657
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:12,425
<i>- Put it down, General!
- Do you even know who the enemy is?</i>

658
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,380
<i>- Do you?
- Guard!</i>

<i>you and I will have
more money than God</i>

<i>with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.</i>

725

<i>So, what's the choice, James?</i>

726
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:35,272
<i>Two targets, time enough for one shot.</i>

<i>The girl, or the mission?</i>

728

<i>Boris. Yes!</i>

<i>If I can spike him, I might be able

<i>- Don't stand there! Get us out of here!

"What I sit on but don't take with me."</i>

01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:38,895
<i>- Chair.

<i>{Bond} 30 seconds.</i>

743
01:32:44,434 --> 01:32:48,064
<i>{Natalya} He's not in Russia,
Germany, Paris, London, Madrid,</i>

744
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:51,275
<i>- 25 seconds.
- New York, Toronto, Chicago,</i>

745
01:32:51,357 --> 01:32:53,325
<i>- San Francisco...
- 20 seconds!</i>

746
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:55,745
<i>Mexico City, Rio, Miami...</i>

747
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:05,668
<i>- Come on!
- Wait! He's in Cuba. Havana - no.</i>

748
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:08,257
<i>NOW!</i>

749
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:31,030
<i>Do you destroy
every vehicle you get into?</i>

750
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:33,825
<i>Standard operating procedure.</i>

751
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,454
<i>Boys with toys.</i>

752
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:44,078
<i>Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.</i>

753
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:46,629
<i>Our trip?</i>

754
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:50,000
<i>Do you know how to disarm the weapon?</i>

755
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:55,509
<i>I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you're talking about disarming.</i>

756
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:03,814
<i>So... tell me. Are there any other
standard operating procedures</i>

757
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:06,767
<i>I should be aware of, Commander?</i>

758
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:13,690
<i>Thousands.</i>

759
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:16,322
<i>But I only pay them</i>

760
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,954
<i>lip service.</i>

761
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:45,515
<i>My whole life I dreamed
about coming to the Caribbean.</i>

762
01:34:45,847 --> 01:34:47,849
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>

763
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:50,185
<i>Not another human being in sight.</i>

764
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,362
<i>{fast bleeping}</i>

765
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:06,117
<i>What is it with you and moving vehicles?</i>

766
01:35:31,017 --> 01:35:36,148
<i>Yo, Jimbo! Brought a little gift
from old... whatshisname? T? Z?</i>

767
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:37,778
<i>_ Q_
- Yeah.</i>

768
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:41,612
<i>- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.</i>

769
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:45,323
<i>Uh... lam not here. The CIA has
no knowledge, no involvement.</i>

770
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:49,081
<i>Nothing to do with your insertion
into Cuba, if you catch my drift.</i>

771
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,787
<i>Mm-hm. Yes, I do.</i>

772
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:53,585
<i>Borrowed the plane
from a friend in the DEA.</i>

773
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:56,176
<i>The Coast Guard and the FAA
are in the loop.</i>

774
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,925
<i>You're cleared on our radar
for 0600 hours.</i>

775
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,343
<i>Here's the latest sat-int from Langley.</i>

776
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:05,268
<i>- Stay below 600 feet.
- 500 feet.</i>

777
01:36:05,551 --> 01:36:07,895
<i>- Who's that?
- Natalya Simonova.</i>

778
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:11,020
<i>- Sim-yo-nova.
- Russian minister of transportation.</i>

779
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:13,193
<i>{Wade clears throat}</i>

780
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:16,654
<i>Did you check her out?</i>

781
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:19,153
<i>- Head to toe.
- Right...</i>

782
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:25,702
<i>So, you're lookin' for a dish the size
of a football ﬁeld, huh? Doesn't exist.</i>

783
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:29,375
<i>- Light a cigar in Cuba and we see it.
- I know it's there.</i>

784
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:34,206
<i>It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like
your secret transmitters in New Zealand.</i>

785
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:37,129
<i>I've never been there.
How does she know about that?</i>

786
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,462
<i>- What if I need backup?
- Get on the radio. I'll send in the marines.</i>

787
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,974
<i>Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.</i>

788
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:47,719
<i>- Cuba's 80 miles on your right.
- Yo, Wade!</i>

789
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:55,314
<i>Just one thing. Don't push
any of the buttons on that car.</i>

790
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:58,814
<i>- I'm just gonna bomb around in it.
- Exactly.</i>

791
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:02,321
<i>Yo, James. I got faith, but be careful.</i>

792
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:06,617
<i>- He knows you're comin'.
- {starts engine}</i>

793
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:11,018
<i>He was your friend - Trevelyan.</i>

794
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,891
<i>And now he's your enemy
and you will kill him.</i>

795
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:19,857
<i>It is that simple?</i>

796
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:23,110
<i>In a word, yes.</i>

797
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:26,572
<i>- Unless he kills you first.
- Natalya...</i>

798
01:38:26,651 --> 01:38:31,578
<i>You think I'm impressed? With your guns,
your killing, your death. For what?</i>

799
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:34,451
<i>So you can be a hero?</i>

800
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:38,000
<i>- All the heroes I know are dead.
- Natalya...</i>

801
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:41,299
<i>How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?</i>

802
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:46,095
<i>It's what keeps me alive.</i>

803
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:50,387
<i>No. It's what keeps you alone.</i>

804
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:31,849
<i>James...</i>

805
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:35,478
<i>Yes?</i>

806
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:43,603
<i>On the train,</i>

807
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:49,488
<i>when you told him to kill me
and that I meant nothing to you,</i>

808
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,277
<i>did you mean it?</i>

809
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:54,785
<i>Yes.</i>

810
01:39:56,365 --> 01:39:59,619
<i>Basic rule: always call their bluff.</i>

811
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:03,047
<i>{Bond laughs}</i>

812
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:05,963
<i>No.</i>

813
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:43,288
<i>Turn ten degrees south, bearing 1-8-4.</i>

814
01:40:43,371 --> 01:40:45,294
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

815
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:13,531
<i>Nothing. There is nothing here.</i>

816
01:41:14,151 --> 01:41:16,245
<i>Let's make another pass.</i>

817
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:31,503
<i>Maybe Wade was right. There is no dish.</i>

818
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:36,550
<i>{Natalya screams}</i>

819
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,817
<i>Natalya.</i>

820
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:38,452
<i>{Bond groans}</i>

821
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:48,792
<i>{shrill birdsong}</i>

822
01:43:31,997 --> 01:43:36,798
<i>This time, Mr Bond,
the pleasure will be all mine.</i>

823

<i>{cries out in pain}</i>

<i>{Bond growls}</i>

<i>You wait for your turn.</i>

<i>{shrieks}</i>

828
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:34,022
<i>She always did enjoy a good squeeze.</i>

829
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:49,038
<i>- ls the satellite in range?
- Six minutes.</i>

830
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:51,835
<i>- Prepare the dish.
- No. It's too early.</i>

831
01:44:52,328 --> 01:44:55,423
<i>- I am not ready.
- Do it.</i>

832
01:44:59,168 --> 01:45:02,297
<i>{klaxon}</i>

833
01:45:26,028 --> 01:45:28,656
<i>No wonder we couldn't see it.</i>

834
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:40,843
<i>Come on.</i>

835
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:58,694
<i>The world's greatest cash card.</i>

836
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:01,738
<i>It had better not be rejected.</i>

837
01:47:06,462 --> 01:47:09,591
<i>- Mischa is on-line.
- {guard} Sir!</i>

838
01:47:15,012 --> 01:47:16,685
<i>Kill him.</i>

839
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:19,267
<i>The man just won't take a hint.</i>

840
01:47:19,475 --> 01:47:20,692
<i>Hm!</i>

841
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:24,739
<i>- Target coordinates?
- The target is London.</i>

842
01:47:37,534 --> 01:47:40,333
<i>He's getting ready to signal the satellite.</i>

843
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:43,340
<i>- How do you stop it?
- The transmitter above the antenna.</i>

844
01:48:15,781 --> 01:48:18,284
<i>Antenna in position.</i>

845
01:48:20,828 --> 01:48:23,001
<i>On my count.</i>

846
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:26,504

<i>James! What an unpleasant surprise.</i>

854
01:50:49,977 --> 01:50:53,026
<i>- We aim to please.
- Where's the girl?</i>

855
01:50:53,856 --> 01:50:55,824
<i>Find her!</i>

856
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:04,993
<i>So, how is old Q?</i>

857
01:51:05,701 --> 01:51:07,874
<i>Up to his usual tricks?</i>

858
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,790
<i>The watch.</i>

859
01:51:14,001 --> 01:51:16,925
<i>Ah. A new model.</i>

860
01:51:17,296 --> 01:51:19,390
<i>Still press here, do I?</i>

861
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:33,858
<i>{man shouting in Russian}</i>

862
01:51:36,315 --> 01:51:38,534
<i>{Bond} Interesting setup, Alec.</i>

863
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,699
<i>You break into the Bank of England
via computer,</i>

864
01:51:41,778 --> 01:51:44,327
<i>then transfer the money electronically</i>

865
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:47,705
<i>just seconds before
you set off the Go|denEye,</i>

866
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:51,125
<i>which erases any record
of the transactions.</i>

867
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:54,541
<i>- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.</i>

868
01:51:54,875 --> 01:51:57,594
<i>But it still boils down to petty theft.</i>

869
01:51:58,587 --> 01:52:02,808
<i>In the end, you're just a bank robber.
Nothing more than a common thief.</i>

870
01:52:13,268 --> 01:52:15,771
<i>You always did have
a small mind, James.</i>

871
01:52:16,438 --> 01:52:21,569
<i>It's not just erasing bank records. It's
everything on every computer in London.</i>

872
01:52:21,652 --> 01:52:26,453
<i>Tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, land registries,</i>

873
01:52:26,531 --> 01:52:28,704
<i>criminal records.</i>

874
01:52:28,909 --> 01:52:33,005
<i>In 16 minutes and 43... no, 42 seconds,</i>

875
01:52:33,497 --> 01:52:35,841
<i>the United Kingdom
will re-enter the Stone Age.</i>

876
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:38,920
<i>A worldwide financial meltdown.</i>

877
01:52:39,127 --> 01:52:43,223
<i>And all so mad little Alec can settle
a score with the world 50 years on.</i>

878
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:47,895
<i>Oh, please, James! Spare me the Freud.
I might as well ask you</i>

879
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:52,567
<i>if all the vodka martinis ever silence
the screams of all the men you've killed.</i>

880
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:59,440
<i>Or if you find forgiveness
in the arms of all those willing women</i>

881
01:52:59,606 --> 01:53:01,984
<i>for all the dead ones
you failed to protect.</i>

882
01:53:04,194 --> 01:53:07,698
<i>England is about to learn
the cost of betrayal,</i>

883

<i>inflation-adjusted for 1945.</i>

<i>This is not one of your games, Boris.
Real people will die!</i>

889
01:53:57,998 --> 01:54:01,047
<i>You pathetic little worm.</i>

890
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:04,179

Check the computer.</i>
