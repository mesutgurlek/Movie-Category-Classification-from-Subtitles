1
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,454
Sierra Leone, 1999

2
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,293
Civil war rages for control
of the diamond fields.

3
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:49,091
Thousands have died
and millions have become refugees.

4
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,345
None of whom has ever seen a diamond.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,300
Dia.

6
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,407
Don't want to be late.

7
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,700
English boys don't go
to school every day.

8
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,497
Every day. Just like you.

9
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:24,001
So you can become a doctor,
not mend the nets like your father...

10
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,421
Now get out of bed before 1 tan your
behind with my fishing rod.

11
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,385
You listen to your father.

12
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,016
And be careful on the road.

13
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,400
Teacher say this country
was founded as a utopia.

14
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,200
Do you know
what that word means, Papa?

15
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,700
Well, she says someday
when the war is over...

16
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,300
...our world will be a paradise.

17
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,800
And all this you learn in one day?

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,100
And math and science.

19
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,400
This is too much learning. Tomorrow,
you will stay home and mend the nets, yes?

20
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,600
No, Papa.

21
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,100
What? So now you want
to go to school every day?

22
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,100
- Stay.
- Papa.

23
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,600
- Stay!
- Papa!

24
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,300
Jassie!

25
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,300
Solomon.

26
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,000
Come, come, come.

27
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,100
Pick it up. Quick.

28
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,600
- Papa! Papa!
- Jassie.

29
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,600
- Dia, run!
- Papa!

30
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,800
- Papa! Papa!
- Dia, run!

31
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,100
Papa!

32
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
Bring forward the next one. Bastard.

33
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,100
Bring forward the next one.

34
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,200
- Long sleeve or short sleeve?
- No.

35
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
Young man. You must understand.

36
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,100
The government wants you to vote, okay?

37
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,900
They gonna tell you say,
"The future is in your hands."

38
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,300
We now the future.

39
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,100
So we take your hands.

40
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,700
- No.
- No more hands, no more voting.

41
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,200
Chop him.

42
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,800
Spread the word.
The Revolutionary United Front is coming.

43
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,600
- RUF!
- RUF! RUF!

44
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,100
Bring forward the next one.
Bring him forward. Bring him forward.

45
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,900
Long sleeve or short sleeve?

46
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,800
- Short sleeve!
- Chop him.

47
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

48
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,200
Not this one. Look at him.

49
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,700
- Put him in the truck.
- Let's go.

50
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,300
Bring him to the mines.

51
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,600
He can work. He can work.
Move, move, move.

52
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Next one, next one, next one.

53
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,700
<i>Throughout the history of Africa...</i>

54
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,400
...whenever a substance
of value is found...

55
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,362
G8 Conference on Diamonds
Antwerp, Belgium

56
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,100
...the locals die
in great number and in misery.

57
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,000
Now, this was true of ivory,
rubber, gold and oil.

58
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,600
It is now true of diamonds.

59
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,200
<i>According to a devastating report
by Global Witness...</i>

60
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,200
<i>...these stones are being used
to purchase arms and finance civil war.</i>

61
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,200
We must act to prohibit...

62
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,700
...the direct or indirect import
of all rough diamonds from conflict zones.

63
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
<i>May I remind you...</i>

64
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,400
...that the U.S. is responsible for two-thirds
of all diamond purchases worldwide...

65
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,200
<i>...and I don't anticipate
that demand diminishing.</i>

66
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
<i>We must remember
that these stones...</i>

67
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,700
<i>...comprise only a small percentage
of the legitimate diamond industry...</i>

68
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,800
...whose trade is crucial to the economies
of many emerging nations.

69
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,200
The Freetown government
and their white masters...

70
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,000
...have raped your land
to feed their greed.

71
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,300
RUF have freed you.

72
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,800
<i>- No more slave and master here.
- It's true.</i>

73
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,100
Current estimates are that conflict stones
account for only 15 percent of the market.

74
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,600
But in a multi-billion-dollar-a-year
industry...

75
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,900
...that means hundreds of millions
of dollars are available...

76
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,000
...for weapons in these conflict zones.

77
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,600
RUF is fighting for the people!

78
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,500
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

79
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,600
Any bastard think he would joke
with me diamond, I go cut he throat.

80
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,900
Stop!

81
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,300
And we are joined today
by members of that diamond industry...

82
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,100
...who wholeheartedly
endorse your proposal.

83
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,000
I hope you join me
in applauding their presence here.

84
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,400
Mr. Van De Kaap and Mr. Simmons.

85
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,000
Give it to me.

86
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,900
Don't worry. We'll be fine, huh?

87
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,400
Listen. You take off
as soon as I'm out the door.

88
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,000
You don't land
until I raise you on the sat phone.

89
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,800
You be careful, Danny.

90
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,500
Don't worry. They want these guns
too much to do anything stupid.

91
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Where is Commander Zero?

92
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,800
I am Captain Rambo.

93
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,200
Right. Right, I've seen your films, huh?

94
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,800
I'm looking for Commander Zero, huh?

95
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,800
He's inside. You talk to me.

96
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,900
You are here to help us
in our struggle against the government.

97
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,700
I'm here to do business
with Commander Zero, all right?

98
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,500
All right.

99
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,900
You are the man, huh?
You are the man.

100
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,200
Here, huh?

101
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,300
Hey. I'm talking to you! Stop!

102
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,500
- Commander Zero.
- Hey.

103
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,300
- I go kill you, eh?
- It's fine, huh? It's fine.

104
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,100
Commander Zero. Commander Zero.

105
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Mr. Archer, come here.

106
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,100
You get something for me?

107
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,900
And yourself get something for me, huh?

108
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,100
First you bring back the plane.

109
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,300
Are you craze?
You get for pay me first for them.

110
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,300
This no fine, huh?

111
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,800
This no fine.

112
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,293
That's all you get!

113
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:55,465
Then your boys can use those crummy AK's
against the government's troops...

114
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,300
...and their new weapons, huh?

115
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,800
Maybe I could kill you
and take what you bring.

116
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,900
Then you get one more dead body...

117
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,700
...instead of airplane
way full with grenade launchers.

118
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,900
So I'm think I'm gonna go
to them government.

119
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,500
Them government,
at least them go pay me, huh?

120
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,500
Wait, wait. Wait, my friend.

121
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,800
This is the thing you want? Here.

122
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,200
So many I not know
what to do with them all.

123
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Hey, Archer, next time,
you bring satellite TV, eh?

124
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,800
<i>- I wanna see Baywatch.
- Yeah.</i>

125
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,400
Yeah. Yeah.

126
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,900
Hello, hello, hello.

127
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,000
Papers, please.

128
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
<i>Danny Archer, National Geographic.</i>

129
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,100
You crossing into Liberia.

130
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,900
I've got a letter from the minister of interior
and a Liberian visa as well.

131
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,600
I'm doing a story on the Marrakaz,
who, as you know...

132
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,100
...are allowed to cross the border
in order to get into grazing grounds.

133
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,600
<i>You ever read National Geographic, huh?</i>

134
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,300
- You're under arrest for smuggling.
- No, no, no.

135
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,100
Listen here, my friend.
Listen here, all right?

136
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,800
I am good friends
with Colonel Coetzee.

137
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,300
Colonel Coetzee would not be pleased
that you've interfered with his business.

138
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,100
Now, you know who I am, all right?

139
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,200
You don't wanna make trouble for me
or my friends, all right?

140
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,100
Now, look, why don't I just
look the other way, all right?

141
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,900
You take one or two of those stones
and get something lacquer for the wife...

142
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,900
...or maybe the mistress, all right?
We'll solve the problem right here, huh?

143
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,300
We'll go back to Freetown
and ask Colonel Coetzee...

144
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,500
...how he wishes
to thank his business associate.

145
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,300
Guys, take him away.

146
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,200
Hey! What the fuck?
What's going on there?

147
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,200
Come on! Fix that shit now!

148
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,700
Wasting my time here!
What in the shit is that?

149
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,500
Fuck that stuff! Fix that shit!
Damn, now need to work.

150
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,600
- Can't work. What's going on there?
- Boss.

151
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,600
- Fix that thing.
- I wanna go toilet. I must go now, now.

152
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,100
- I can't hold it in, boss.
- Go, go.

153
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Get to work. Go to work, go to work.

154
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,700
Fuckheads wasting my time now.
How am I work in this shit?

155
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,500
Stop!

156
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Spread your fingers.

157
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,000
Open.

158
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,200
Make it quick.

159
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,800
Give it to me.

160
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,100
Give it to me.

161
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
The government troops are coming!

162
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,300
Go, go, go--!

163
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,800
No, no, no!

164
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,600
No! I'm not a rebel!

165
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,321
1 am not a rebel! 1 am not R. U. F. !

166
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,000
<i>RUF is coming! RUF is coming!</i>

167
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,100
<i>RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!</i>

168
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,400
<i>RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!</i>

169
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,900
<i>RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!</i>

170
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
<i>RUF! RUF! RUF!</i>

171
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,500
<i>RUF! RUF! RUF!</i>

172
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,100
<i>RUF! RUF! RUF!</i>

173
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,700
<i>RUF! RUF! RUF!</i>

174
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,000
Hey.

175
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,500
What did you do with it?

176
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,800
I'm talking to you, you hear me?

177
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,400
Where the diamond? The pink one.

178
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,400
- I saw you take it.
- You're mad. I do not know you.

179
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,500
Liar! I saw it with my own eyes.

180
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,300
This big. Biggest I have ever seen.

181
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,100
My brothers, I go give $1000...

182
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,700
...to the man who cuts the diamond
out of this bastard.

183
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,300
You the craze! You the craze!

184
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,100
Where is the diamond?

185
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,500
Where is the diamond?
Do you see a diamond?

186
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,500
You devils have taken my family!
My home! I done lost everything!

187
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,800
Here, look. What is left?

188
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,900
What is left?

189
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,700
If there is a diamond,
you are the one who has taken it!

190
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,800
Liar! The man is a liar!

191
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,300
I know your name, Solomon Vandy!
You have a name!

192
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,500
You have a family!
And I'll catch them!

193
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,500
And I'll find them!

194
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,500
<i>Please tell me you brought me
cigarettes, bru, please.</i>

195
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,100
I just have to tell you, Danny.

196
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,300
The colonel's not going to be happy
about you losing the diamonds.

197
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,300
Forget the colonel.
There's a fisherman in there, all right?

198
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,100
He might've found a pink. Big one.

199
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,400
What about the colonel?
He'll want that stone.

200
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,100
Screw the colonel.
I'll contact our friends in London.

201
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,100
If this stone is as big as I think,
we're gonna need a real buyer, all right?

202
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,400
What? What?

203
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,200
London wants nothing more
to do with you.

204
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,900
"Arrest in Sierra Leone of Daniel Archer,
former mercenary and smuggler..."

205
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,700
"Retains close ties
to Van De Kaap diamond cartel.

206
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,000
Sources say they deny
any affiliation whatso--"

207
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,300
Fucking hell.

208
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,900
Listen, his name
is Solomon Vandy, all right?

209
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,700
Van De Kaap is gonna want that stone,
whatever they say. You just get him out.

210
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,500
Get him out.

211
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,400
Yeah, can you tell Mr. Simmons
that Danny Archer called. Right.

212
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,600
Archer. A-R-C-H-E-R.

213
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,400
Afternoon, darling, huh?

214
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,500
Big white man all alone.
That is no fine.

215
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,100
- I'm safe, huh? No HIV.
- Yeah, yeah. I've heard that one before.

216
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,500
Archer, I know where to get
nice baby diamond just for you.

217
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,600
- Not now, next time.
- Come on, Archer.

218
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,100
I said not now, next time. Bugger off.

219
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,100
Solomon Vandy?

220
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,000
What do you want?

221
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,000
It seems you made a friend in prison.

222
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,300
- Hey.
- How the body, Mr. Archer?

223
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,300
The body fine, M'Ed.

224
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,300
So you want something nice, huh?

225
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,600
The best you can get ahold of, all right?

226
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,300
Take me a few days,
but I go find you something special.

227
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,300
All right. You hear
they took Marampa yesterday?

228
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,000
- Really?
- Now, come on.

229
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,800
You know every move they make.
When are they gonna hit us?

230
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,500
Oh, I imagine they come
do some shopping very soon.

231
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,900
Yeah, yeah.
Got any smokes back there?

232
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,600
Yeah.

233
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,500
Who's that, huh?

234
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,300
All right.

235
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,500
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks.

236
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,400
You listening to this?

237
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,000
<i>I am profoundly sorry.</i>

238
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,700
The world is falling apart,
and all we hear about is Blowjobgate.

239
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,800
<i>I believe he's sorry.</i>

240
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,400
When was the last time the world
wasn't falling apart, huh?

241
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,300
A cynic. Why don't you sit down
and make me miserable?

242
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,000
- Danny Archer.
- Maddy Bowen.

243
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,000
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

244
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,800
- American, huh?
- Guilty.

245
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,200
Well, Americans usually are.

246
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,100
Says the white South African?

247
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,100
I'm from Rhodesia.

248
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,500
We say Zimbabwe now,
don't we?

249
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,900
- Do we?
- Last time I checked.

250
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,300
Don't tell me,
you're here to make a difference.

251
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,700
- And you're here to make a buck?
- I'm here for lack of a better idea.

252
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,300
- That's a shame.
- Not really.

253
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,700
Peace Corps types only
stay around long enough...

254
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,800
...to realize they're not helping anyone.

255
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,800
Government only wants
to stay in power...

256
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,900
...until they've stolen enough
to go into exile somewhere else.

257
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,700
And the rebels, they're not sure
they want to take over.

258
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,200
Otherwise,
they'd have to govern this mess.

259
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,700
- But TIA, right, M'Ed?
- TIA.

260
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,100
What's TIA?

261
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,600
- "This is Africa," huh?
- Right.

262
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,700
- You want another?
- Sure.

263
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,000
So which one are you?

264
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,700
- Smuggler?
- Am I?

265
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,800
Somehow you don't strike me
as the UNICEF type.

266
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,800
How about soldier of fortune?

267
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,900
Or is that too much of a cliché?

268
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,400
Diamonds?

269
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,700
- If I told you I was a missionary...?
- For Van De Kaap?

270
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,000
Better watch that type of talk,
Miss Bowen.

271
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,300
In America, it's bling-bling,
but out here, it's bling-bang, huh?

272
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,700
I wouldn't want you
getting in any trouble.

273
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,200
How much trouble
do you think I would get into...

274
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,600
...for talking about blood diamonds?

275
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,500
- You're a journalist.
- That's right.

276
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,000
Piss off, huh?

277
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,700
For five years, this country has reported
almost no diamond exports...

278
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,500
...while Liberia, right next door,
has exported 2 billion dollars' worth.

279
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Very odd, considering that Liberia
has no diamonds to speak of.

280
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
I'm shocked.

281
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,400
Van De Kaap denies trading blood
diamonds, but admits it's impossible...

282
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,900
...to tell where a diamond comes from
unless their smuggler gets caught.

283
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,700
What do you want from me, huh?

284
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,400
You know all about Van De Kaap.
Help me out. Off the record.

285
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,100
Well, off the record, I like to get kissed
before I get fucked, huh?

286
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,900
Shit.

287
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,700
- Cordell. How is it, Shona?
- Long time, pal.

288
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,300
- How's Alice?
- She's well, thanks.

289
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,300
Tim must be in school, right?

290
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,800
- Big kids, big problems, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.

291
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,600
I heard you got into a spot of trouble
in the bush, huh?

292
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,100
<i>Well, you know the bush, right, bru?</i>

293
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,500
- Company doing well?
- Can't complain.

294
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,300
Eleven wars in the continent.
We're keeping busy.

295
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,900
So, what, you're here on holiday, huh?

296
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,500
- How's the colonel?
- He sends his regards.

297
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,300
Good, good. Score us a loose, huh?

298
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,700
<i>Smoking will kill you, bru.</i>

299
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,200
Only if I live, right?

300
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,400
<i>That's for breaking my TV, bru.</i>

301
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,800
Tell the colonel he'll get his money.
I'll come see him soon.

302
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,800
Ten more.

303
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,900
Come. Come.

304
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,500
Go on.

305
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Dia. Dia. Come here.
Get away from there.

306
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,800
Go. Go, Mama.

307
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Stay down.

308
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,955
Please...

309
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,208
1 must talk to someone. My family's
name is not on the list.

310
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,876
Go to Kissy, there is another list.

311
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,254
I have been to Kissy, and Waterloo, and
Port loko, and—

312
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,715
Talk to the whites.

313
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,700
Excuse me,
my name's Solomon Vandy--

314
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,000
- Check the list.
- I have checked the list.

315
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,600
- File papers at the Office for Refugees.
- Sir, I have filed papers with the office.

316
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Then God help you,
because I can't.

317
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
- Please, sir--
- Next.

318
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,300
- Sir-- Sir, no, please.
- Hey, hey. Me, me, me.

319
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,300
Husband here. One year we look.

320
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,000
Hurry, Mom. Go.

321
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,500
Dia! Dia!

322
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,700
- Jassie!
- Dia!

323
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,400
- Mama!
- Dia!

324
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,800
Jassie! Mama!

325
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,937
Cape Town,
South Africa

326
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,900
He's been waiting.
What took you?

327
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,900
What are you gonna do,
shoot me right here, huh, Shona?

328
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,200
Now, don't be a wanker, man. Get in.

329
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,700
- Hello, Danny.
- Colonel.

330
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,600
You look well.

331
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,000
Clean living and a pure heart,
I suppose, huh?

332
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,000
Walk with me.

333
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,600
It seems the rebels have taken back
the diamond fields, Danny.

334
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,100
The government
of Sierra Leone has contracted us...

335
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,300
...to go in there
and take the rebels down.

336
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,000
So you sell the rebels weapons...

337
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,900
...the government hires you
when they use them? Nice, sir.

338
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,200
I assume you're asking
for mining concessions, huh?

339
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,500
We save the government,
they show their gratitude.

340
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,000
And you get rich, right?

341
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,800
How long have I known you, Danny?

342
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,400
I was... I was 19, sir.

343
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,200
And you survived.
A lot of boys didn't. Why is that?

344
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,300
Just lucky, I guess.

345
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,100
No, you were a good soldier.
But I made you better, didn't I?

346
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,900
Yes, sir. Yes, you did.

347
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,100
And over the years,
didn't I protect you...

348
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,400
...teach you about diamonds,
cut you in on the deals?

349
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,300
- Some might call it that, yeah.
- But not you...

350
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,900
...because you done with me now, eh?
On to bigger things.

351
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,500
I need a man that knows
his way around up there.

352
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,500
Unless, of course,
you wanna cut me in. Something pink?

353
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,100
Sir...

354
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,400
Our deal went bad,
and you owe me money.

355
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,300
I'll take a stone as payment.

356
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,300
Look, do you think if I found a stone
like that, I'd still be on this continent?

357
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,300
- Come on.
- Danny, give me your hand.

358
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,000
That's red earth. It's in our skin.

359
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,900
The Shona say the color
comes from all the blood...

360
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,600
...that's being spilled
fighting over the land.

361
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,300
This is home.
You'll never leave Africa.

362
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,700
If you say so, sir.

363
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,800
So, what did you do, bury it?

364
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,600
Yeah. Yeah, I would have
buried it, huh?

365
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,800
<i>- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about? Come on, bru.</i>

366
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,400
I'm late for work.

367
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,100
Pink, huh? The biggest one
he'd ever seen.

368
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,400
<i>You were in the mining camps,
weren't you, bru?</i>

369
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,100
Why else would that rebel with
the bandaged arm make up such a story?

370
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,500
Go ask him.

371
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,000
Thank you.

372
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,500
Your mothers and fathers,
your brothers and sisters are dead.

373
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,500
- You are dead! You have been reborn.
- No!

374
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,900
- We are your family now.
- No! No!

375
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,100
Your parents are weak.

376
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:21,200
They're the farmers.
They're the fishermen.

377
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,200
They've done nothing
but suck the blood from this country.

378
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,100
But you are the heroes
who will save this nation.

379
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,300
You are not children anymore.

380
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,200
You're men.

381
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,600
No one has ever given you respect...

382
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,900
...but with this in your hand,
they go fear you.

383
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,500
If you do not get
the respect you deserve...

384
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,000
...you will take it
by shedding their blood.

385
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,100
- Repeat after me, shed their blood.
- Shed their blood.

386
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,400
- Louder! Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Shed their blood!

387
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,700
Make them hear you in Freetown.
Shed their blood! Shed their blood!

388
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,400
<i>Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!</i>

389
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,500
<i>- Dia Vandy, stand up.
- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!</i>

390
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,600
<i>- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Put your hand on the gun.</i>

391
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,300
<i>Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!</i>

392
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,100
<i>Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!</i>

393
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,300
<i>- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Now squeeze the trigger.</i>

394
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,200
Come on, Dia. Pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger!

395
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,900
I know, I know.
It's hard to be a man.

396
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,200
Sit up. Come.

397
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,700
But you are a soldier
of the revolution now.

398
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,800
And I am your commander.

399
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,100
Whatever you need...

400
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,500
...guns, CDs, food...

401
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,400
...come to me.
I will take care of you.

402
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:30,100
Today, you are promoted
to the rank of captain.

403
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,700
Dia Vandy...

404
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,100
...boss man.

405
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,500
<i>How's it, bru?</i>

406
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,200
- You got something for me, huh?
- Yeah.

407
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,400
- So, what's new, M'Ed?
- Fucking RUF.

408
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,100
Tried to hit the government building
across the street.

409
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,900
Shit, man, half the people
be soldiers today, RUF tomorrow.

410
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,500
- Might be time to get your family out, huh?
- And go where?

411
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,400
Just fire up the chopper
and fly away like you people?

412
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,600
This my country, man.

413
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,200
We here long before you came,
long after you gone.

414
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,400
- Hi. I'm Maddy Bowen.
- How about you dance with me?

415
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,000
- No, I don't dance.
- Neither do I. Come on.

416
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,600
- So, Danny...
- Archer.

417
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,900
Archer.

418
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,500
When did you first start
moving stones? Was it Angola?

419
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,900
Then you did the whole
mercenary thing. Was that fun?

420
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,100
So, what are you?
Nihilist? Opportunist?

421
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,400
Maybe I wasn't breast-fed
as a child, huh?

422
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,000
You think I haven't met
people like you before?

423
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,500
- I think you get off on people like me.
- You think?

424
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,800
When did you first start
working for Van De Kaap?

425
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,000
Christ, you never stop, do you?

426
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,600
No, I never stop.

427
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,900
Do you want me to stop?

428
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,200
Why don't we go back to your place,
see what's in the minibar, huh?

429
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,500
I'm a print journalist. I drank it.

430
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,500
Is it possible that you don't care
how many people die...

431
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,600
...because of the deals you do?

432
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,000
People here kill each other as a way of life.
Always been like that.

433
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,100
So you can just watch it
and go about your day?

434
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,500
Maybe we should all just
write about it, then.

435
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,000
Look, thanks for the dance, huh?

436
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,500
- And a shot too, huh, M'Ed?
- Sure.

437
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,700
You're a hard case, huh?

438
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,800
Tell me something,
how long you been here in Africa, huh?

439
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,300
Three months. And before that,
Afghanistan and Bosnia.

440
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,700
You come here
with your laptop computer...

441
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,900
...and your malaria medicine
and your little bottles of hand sanitizer.

442
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,700
Think you're gonna change
the outcome, huh?

443
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,400
Let me tell you something.
You sell blood diamonds too.

444
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,100
- Really?
- Yeah.

445
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,300
Tell me, how is that?

446
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,700
Who do you think buys
the stones that I bring out?

447
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,500
Dreamy American girls who all want
a storybook wedding and a big, shiny rock...

448
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,200
...like the ones in the advertisements
of your politically-correct magazines.

449
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,400
So, please, don't come here
and make judgments on me, all right?

450
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,100
I provide a service. The world wants what
we have, and they want it cheap.

451
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,500
We're in business together.
Get over yourself, darling.

452
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,100
Okay, just to clarify, not all American girls
want a storybook wedding...

453
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,200
...just like not all Africans kill each other
as a way of life.

454
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,700
And yeah, it's a shit, shit world,
but you know what?

455
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,800
Good things are done every day,
just, apparently, not by you.

456
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,400
This place is about to explode.

457
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,700
I wanna spend my time
with someone else.

458
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,800
<i>You are listening to BBC World Service.</i>

459
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,700
<i>In Sierra Leone, Revolutionary United Front
forces have been sighted...</i>

460
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,600
<i>...within 10 kilometers
of the capital city of Freetown.</i>

461
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,500

has expressed confidence...</i>

462
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,000
<i>...that the government troops

463
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,400
<i>All foreign nationals are being advised
to leave the country.</i>

464
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,800
<i>There are also unconfirmed reports...</i>

465
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,000
<i>...that atrocities are being committed by
both sides in the rapidly worsening situation.</i>

466
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,100
<i>The United Nations has described
the refugee situation as critical.</i>

467
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,100
Don't tell me you're gonna try
and sell it yourself.

468
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,800
To who?
And for what price, my friend?

469
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You need my help,
whether you like it or not.

470
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,200
- What are you talking about?
- Here, let me help you with that.

471
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,300
You hear that? You hear that?
They came into the city overnight.

472
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,700
It's started.
What are you gonna do now, huh?

473
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,200
Listen, the right stone can buy anything.
Information, safety, even freedom.

474
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,800
But a big stone does not stay secret
for very long.

475
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,300
The moment you tell anyone about it,
your life is absolutely worthless.

476
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,600
The only reason you're alive is
you haven't told anyone where it is.

477
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,000
Am I right? Am I?

478
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,400
Who do you think got you
out of jail, huh?

479
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,700
- That makes us partners.
- I am not your partner!

480
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,300
What if I helped you find your family?

481
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,000
What do you know of my family?

482
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,200
The relief agencies are useless,
the hospitals are overwhelmed.

483
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,000
<i>- There are other ways, bru.
- Liar.</i>

484
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,400
Look at me. I know people, huh?
White people.

485
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,700
Without me, you're just another
black man in Africa, all right?

486
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,800
Oh, shit.

487
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,100
We got no time.
What's it gonna be?

488
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,300
You would say anything.
How can I trust you?

489
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,900
I don't give a fuck about you, all right?
That diamond could be priceless!

490
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:22,300
We split it, and you get your family.
What's it gonna be, yes or no? Yes or no?

491
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,100
- Where will we go? Where do we go?
- Come on, follow me!

492
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,200
Stay low!

493
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,300
Get your ass over here!

494
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,400
Wait!

495
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,500
Now!

496
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,200
Come on, come on.

497
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,600
Come on!

498
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,400
Come on.

499
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,800
Fuck!

500
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,900
No, this way.

501
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,800
Fire!

502
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,400
Fuck! Go, go, go!

503
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,300
Go!

504
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,100
Shit!

505
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,900
No! No!

506
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,100
This way.

507
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,200
This way. Stay low.

508
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,300
Come on. Go, go, go. Come on.

509
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,100
Come on!

510
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,000
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

511
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,800
Fire!

512
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,400
- Is there another way?
- That bridge is the only way across, huh?

513
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,800
So, what do we do?

514
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,300
- You are RUF, huh? And I am your prisoner.
- What do you mean?

515
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,600
You wanna see your son again, don't you?
You stay behind me.

516
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,900
Wait, wait. Wait.

517
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,600
Bring that pink chicken skin
over here, huh?

518
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,200
Now let me shoot that pink ass, boy.

519
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,800
Where are we going?

520
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,200
Lungi's under government control.

521
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:05,800
I'm gonna try to locate a sat phone
to get in contact with my pilot, all right?

522
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,300
I have agreed to nothing.

523
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,700
You're in a bit of a conundrum there,
my friend.

524
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,100
You know what that means?
It means you have no choice.

525
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,200
So you're a fisherman, huh?

526
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,200
- What do you catch mostly?
- Fish.

527
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,000
Come on.

528
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,700
- Hello.
- Back away from the fence.

529
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,500
<i>Listen, I'm from
the Cape Herald, all right?</i>

530
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,600
My wallet, my credentials,
everything got left in Freetown.

531
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,500
We barely got out with our lives.
Can we just get through?

532
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,700
Back away from the fence.

533
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,300
But you are not a journalist.

534
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,900
I'm trying to get us to Kono.

535
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,500
- Do you understand that, huh?
- Getting B-roll. Wait.

536
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,200
Listen, I'm coming back.
I'm coming back just now.

537
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,400
<i>How's it, my bru?
Have you got an extra smoke?</i>

538
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,300
- Here.
- Oh, cheers.

539
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,500
I'm looking for someone, an American
by the name of Maddy Bowen.

540
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,500
- If you saw her, you would not forget it.
- Yeah, I know her.

541
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,700
- Is it?
- Yeah.

542
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,400
Can you tell her Danny Archer's looking
for her? I've got the story she wants.

543
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,800
Okay, but I'm going out for a bit.
If I see her before, I'll tell her.

544
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,200
Magic. Listen, we'll be
right down the road, huh?

545
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,200
<i>- Sweet. Cheers, bru.
- Cheers.</i>

546
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,000
It is as I said.
You will say anything.

547
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,200
- You don't mind waiting?
- No worries.

548
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,300
- Thank you so much. I'll just be a sec.
- All right, Maddy.

549
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,000
Hi.

550
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,000
You got out.

551
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,200
Yes. Hello again.

552
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,700
- This is Solomon Vandy.
- Hi.

553
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,400
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

554
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,100
So I'm on deadline. I've been waiting
four hours to use the phone.

555
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:29,600
- I've got someone holding my place in line.
- I understand. Come with me, huh?

556
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,300
All right. Here it is.

557
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,500
- There's a company called Tiara Diamonds.
- Right?

558
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,900
They get the stones
that I smuggle into Liberia.

559
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,500
Now, Van De Kaap
has no visible ties to Tiara...

560
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,900
...but through a series of cross holdings
and offshore bank accounts...

561
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,200
- ...they actually own it.
- You can prove this?

562
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,100
- If you help me out, yeah.
- Right, here it comes.

563
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,800
Before you say anything,
look at that man. You see him?

564
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,800
His entire village was burned down.
His wife and children, they got away.

565
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,200
He's been working in the mining camps,
trying to get his family back.

566
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,000
He cannot get through the red tape.

567
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,900
All I'm asking is this,
that you help him, huh?

568
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,100
And how do you know this man?

569
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,600
- I know him. I know him.
- Oh, come on, Archer.

570
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,600
You're using him.

571
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,400
I'm using him, and you are using me,
and this is how it works, isn't it?

572
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,400
Come on. Look, you've got access
to U.N. databases.

573
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,400
- You can track his family for him.
- Why?

574
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,800
This whole country's at war.
Why should I help just one person?

575
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,400
I can't believe I just said that.

576
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,200
My family's here, in Guinea?

577
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,700
Yes, according to the manifest.

578
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,400
I do not know how to thank you.

579
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:03,323
Tassin Camp
Forecariah, Guinea

580
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,100
Thank you. Thank you.

581
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,800
This is what a million people looks like.

582
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,100
At the moment, the second largest
refugee camp in Africa.

583
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:47,300
Might catch a minute of this on CNN,
somewhere between Sports and Weather.

584
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,200
- Hello.
- Yeah, hello?

585
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,700
I've spoken with Colonel Coedoo...

586
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,000
...and highlighted the names
we're looking for.

587
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,400
- Move away.
- What him doing?

588
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,900
Okay, I'm gonna check for you.

589
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,600
- Wait me there.
- Okay, thank you.

590
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,000
We are here to help you.

591
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,500
This woman says she has
spoken to Coedoo.

592
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,400
An entire country made homeless.

593
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,700
Two multiplied by three
is equal to six.

594
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,400
Two multiplied by four
is equal to eight.

595
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,800
Two multiplied by five
is equal to 10.

596
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,100
Two multiplied by six
is equal to 12.

597
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,300
Jassie.

598
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,900
Jassie!

599
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,400
Jassie!

600
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,700
- Jassie.
- Solo.

601
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,100
- Jassie.
- Solo.

602
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,700
Jassie. Jassie.

603
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,500
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

604
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,600
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

605
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:38,812
Where is Dia?

606
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,100
Dia. Dia.

607
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,300
Where is Dia?

608
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,569
Where is my son?

609
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,300
Jassie!

610
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:49,907
Where is my son?

611
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,701
Where is my son?

612
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:55,037
They took him.

613
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,200
They took him.

614
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,600
There are only two children
on the manifest.

615
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,300
- Where is my son?
- Oh, Christ.

616
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,500
Where is my son?

617
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,400
- Away from the fence.
- Where is my son?

618
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,800
Move away from the fence.

619
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,100
- Let them out! Let them out!
- Keep away from the fence.

620
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,700
Let them out!

621
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:24,441
Let them out!

622
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,861
Let them out!

623
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,200
Away from the fence.

624
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,900
- They'll shoot you!
- Jassie!

625
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,500
No! Solo!

626
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,900
Do you want your wife and child
to watch you die?

627
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,500
Solo! Solo!

628
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:52,500
They said they're concerned that
some of the refugees might be rebels...

629
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,700
...so they refused to release them
until there's a cease-fire.

630
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,900
I'm so sorry, Solomon.

631
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,900
What you want, Mr. Archer,
is beyond those hills...

632
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,300
...where I buried it.

633
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:34,400
You say the mine is on the Sewa River.
Where exactly?

634
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,100
Solomon.

635
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,000
I do not need a map.

636
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,600
Yeah, well, I do.
Look, we are down here, huh?

637
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,500
The press convoy
is on its way to Kono.

638
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,000
You say the diamond mine is up here.
Where did you bury it?

639
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:56,500
When we get to Kono,
we're gonna have to walk, all right?

640
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,400
You damn well better be able to find it.

641
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,600
My son is a very good student.

642
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,400
He walks five kilometers
to the Sister School...

643
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,900
...every morning to study English.

644
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,800
He's going to be a doctor one day.

645
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:46,000
"In the 90-degree heat,
Solomon Vandy drops to his knees...

646
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,900
...rattling the wire
with his powerful hands."

647
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,200
- What?
- Nothing.

648
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,300
Do you think I'm exploiting his grief?

649
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,100
You're right. It's shit.

650
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,600
It's like one of those infomercials.

651
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:12,600
You know, the little black babies
with swollen bellies and flies in their eyes.

652
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,600
So here I've got dead mothers,
I've got severed limbs, but it's nothing new.

653
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,400
It might be enough
to make people cry if they read it...

654
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,100
...maybe even write a check...

655
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,600
...but it's not gonna be enough
to make it stop.

656
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:28,500
I am sick of writing about victims,
but it's all I can fucking do.

657
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,200
Because I need facts.

658
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:34,900
I need names. I need dates.
I need pictures. I need bank accounts.

659
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,400
People back home
wouldn't buy a ring...

660
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,900
...if they knew it cost
someone else their hand.

661
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,700
But I can't write that story...

662
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,400
...until I get facts
that can be verified...

663
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:53,700
...which is to say, until I find someone
who will go on record.

664
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,400
So if that is not you...

665
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,700
...and you're not really gonna help me,
and we're not really gonna screw...

666
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,100
...then why don't you get the fuck
out of my face...

667
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,100
...and let me do my work?

668
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:18,200
Do you know that Solomon thinks
his son's gonna be a doctor one day?

669
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,100
Maybe his baby dies in that camp.
Maybe his daughter gets raped.

670
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,600
Who knows, maybe both.

671
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,500
Do you realize that
that diamond...

672
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,400
...is the only chance he has
of getting his family out?

673
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,800
- You don't give a rat's ass about his family.
- Do you understand that?

674
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,400
Listen, I need to get to Kono, all right?

675
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,600
The only way
is with the press convoy.

676
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,200
I'm a journalist,
and he's my cameraman, all right?

677
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,900
- No.
- Please, Maddy.

678
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,700
- Please.
- No!

679
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,400
After I smuggle the stones
across the border...

680
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,300
...local buyers get them
to a middleman in Monrovia.

681
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,400
Go on.

682
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:24,800
<i>He pays off Customs and then certifies
that the diamonds were mined in Liberia.</i>

683
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,300
That way, they can be legally exported.

684
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,000
Now, once they've reached
the buyers in Antwerp...

685
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:33,600
<i>...diamonds are brought
to the sorting tables...</i>

686
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,400
<i>...no more questions are asked.</i>

687
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,400
By the time they get to India...

688
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:42,300
<i>...the dirty stones are mixed with
the clean stones from all over the world...</i>

689
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,700
...and then they become
like any other diamonds.

690
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,100
And Van De Kaap
knows about all this?

691
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:49,700
Yeah.

692
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,600
<i>When I get to London,
I meet with Simmons.</i>

693
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,400
Supply and demand. You control the supply,
and you keep the demand high.

694
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,100
- Agreed.
- Good.

695
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,600
Now, there's an underground vault...

696
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,300
<i>...where they put all the stones
they buy up to keep off the market...</i>

697
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,300
<i>...so they can keep the price high.</i>

698
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,500
If rebels wanna flood the market
with a billion dollars' worth of rough...

699
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,700
...a company like Van De Kaap,
who says that they're rare...

700
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,600
...can't afford to let that happen.

701
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,000
<i>Especially when they're telling
some poor sod...</i>

702
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,700
<i>...he's supposed to shell out
three months' salary...</i>

703
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,200
<i>...for an engagement ring.</i>

704
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,400
Now, technically speaking,
they're not financing the war...

705
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,400
...but creating a situation
where it pays to keep it going.

706
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,800
- You understand?
- Yes. And where's my proof?

707
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,400
Names, dates and numbered accounts.

708
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,500
You publish one word of this story
before I give them the stone...

709
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,800
...and I'm dead, huh?

710
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:54,300
After I give it to them,
then... I leave this continent forever.

711
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,300
If you don't come out
with the diamond?

712
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,900
Then write whatever you want.

713
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,800
I'm already dead.

714
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:14,300
Now, remember. All you say is,
"I am the cameraman," all right?

715
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,500
Listen, I cannot do this.

716
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,200
- Why not?
- Because I am not a journalist.

717
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,900
- Of course you're not.
- Well, then how can I say I am?

718
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:25,300
Because you do. Because that's how
you get your son back, all right?

719
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,900
Now get on the bus. Go.

720
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,500
I am the cameraman.

721
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,600
You are writing about
what is happening here?

722
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,400
Yes.

723
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:01,700
So when people in your country read it,
they will come help us, yes?

724
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,500
Probably not.

725
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,500
- You heard of a Stinger?
- What?

726
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:12,100
<i>Your friend, Maddy. She's like a full-on,
heat-seeking missile, bru.</i>

727
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,000
I mean, I saw her go into Afghanistan...

728
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,300
...like about 200 clicks
into Taliban land.

729
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,300
<i>When the military said no,
she just took a bus, bru.</i>

730
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,800
Came back with 3000 words,
and she still looked so good.

731
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,800
- Like hot, you know?
- All right.

732
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,700
Calm down to the frantic now, huh?

733
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,200
- What's that?
- What's going on?

734
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,500
Looks like it was an RPG.

735
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,500
Open the door. Let us out.

736
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,800
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on. Go, go, go.

737
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,200
Go, go! Move, move, move!

738
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,900
We've just happened upon
the sight of an ambush...

739
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,400
...fifteen kilometers
from the Liberian border...

740
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,200
- ...near the Moa River...
- As you can see behind me...

741
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,900
...just a few minutes ago...

742
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,400
- ...an ambulance has...
- Got movement in the bush.

743
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,600
- Check out the head of the road.
- Spread out.

744
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,600
--at this site.
Dozens of--

745
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,500
Many are injured.

746
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,800
Get back on the bus, huh?
Get back on! Come on!

747
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,600
- Maddy!
- Move it! Move it!

748
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,800
Get back on the bus!

749
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,500
Solomon! Solomon!

750
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:23,200
- Let's go.
- Solomon, come here!

751
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,800
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, come on.

752
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,600
- Get in the bus!
- Move, move, move! Come on, come on.

753
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,800
- Move!
- Get in the bus. Let's go.

754
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,200
Get in, get in.
Goddamn it, get in! Get in!

755
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,800
- Let me inside!
- There's no fucking space!

756
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,200
- Let them on the bus.
- You give him your seat.

757
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,400
What if we just take your place, huh?
What if we take your place?

758
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,500
That's enough. He can ride with me.
Oi, he can ride with me.

759
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,200
Maddy! Let's go!
Maddy, let's go. Come on!

760
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:02,200
Nothing like a little bang-bang
to get the heart started, Maddy.

761
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:06,300
- Whatever you say, Corbauld.
- Come on, love. Don't be like that.

762
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,900
Story's played out, hasn't it?
Government bad, rebels worse.

763
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,900
No one gives a toss anymore.
Know what I mean?

764
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,600
<i>This medicine will make you strong...</i>

765
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,600
...make you invisible to your enemies.

766
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,000
Bullets will bounce off you.

767
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,600
Superboy Killer, yes, huh?
Commando.

768
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,700
Foreigners are the cause of the problems.

769
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:20,100
Poppy Sankoh say,
"Overthrow those who would exploit you."

770
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,500
I am Baby Killer.

771
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,900
- I am the Master of Disaster.
- You will be strong.

772
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,700
I am Born Trouble.

773
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,100
I am See Me No More.

774
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,600
You'd think they'd want
at least one decent road in this place.

775
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:02,200
I'm gonna have to start charging
an entrance fee. Oh, God!

776
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,200
Get down!

777
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,600
- Look out!
- Shit!

778
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,700
- You all right?
- Fine.

779
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,600
Shit!

780
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,100
Hold on!

781
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,600
Hold on!

782
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,100
Come on.

783
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,800
- Everyone all right, huh?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

784
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,400
Let me see that. You okay?

785
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,700
- Yeah.
- All right.

786
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,300
Quietly, now. Quietly.

787
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,900
Come on.

788
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,300
Kamajors. Local militia
protecting their homes, huh?

789
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,400
- Do not look them in the eye.
- No.

790
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:43,382
Who are you?

791
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:46,260
We are friends.

792
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:51,390
We are not R. U. F. !
We are not government!

793
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,434
We will kill all of you!

794
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,400
Excuse me. Excuse me?

795
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:01,700
<i>Hi, I'm Maddy Bowen
with Vital Affairs magazine.</i>

796
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,900
Wonder if I could take your picture.
I'm just gonna get my camera.

797
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,000
I've heard about your struggle.
I'd love to know more about it.

798
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,800
Would you mind if I took your picture?
Everyone together?

799
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,900
Everyone could all come in together.

800
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:16,082
-Who is this woman?
-We are friends.

801
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,400
Is that okay?
If everyone could come closer.

802
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,600
If you come over here and come in
nice and close. That's good.

803
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,200
Yeah. That's great.
And we'll get one with all of us.

804
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,300
There you go. That's perfect.

805
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,470
Reminds me of my wife.

806
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,600
How about one together?
Us together, what do you think?

807
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,800
I'll come in like this, yeah?

808
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,600
Cheese.

809
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:41,100
So do you think
they've read your work?

810
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,400
Shut up.

811
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,600
Hey, get them, get them, get them.

812
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,900
- I got a score. I got a score.
- You missed.

813
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,800
Where have you come from?

814
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,100
- Where did you come from?
- Where have you come from?

815
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,000
That's right. Yeah.
From New York. From America.

816
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,100
I don't have anything for you.

817
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:19,645
Don't bother the people now.
Let them come in.

818
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:25,860
Thank you, Ubani.

819
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:30,114
You can leave them here. 1 take
responsibility.

820
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,908
Good. Now they are your problem.

821
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,200
My name is Benjamin Margai.

822
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:41,000
Danny Archer. This is Maddy Bowen.

823
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,200
- Hello. How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

824
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,005
Welcome brother.

825
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,924
1 am Solomon Vandy, from Shenge.

826
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,719
What should 1 make of your companions?

827
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,723
He-- She is... They are journalits.

828
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:57,266
Ah. And 1 suppose you are, too.

829
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,400
I'm the cameraman?

830
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,900
The Belgians were the first
to chop off limbs in Africa.

831
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:11,400
King Leopold took one hand
for every hundredth slave in the Congo...

832
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,700
...to keep them in line.

833
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:17,300
Many of these children
were taken by the RUF.

834
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,400
We have taken them back.

835
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,700
Some of them have been
made to do horrible things.

836
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,900
We are trying
to bring them back to life.

837
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,700
Let me show you.

838
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,100
Imagine doing all this, huh?

839
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,300
What's your excuse?

840
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:41,400
Well, it's gotten hard to go back
to sipping lattes and talking interest rates.

841
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,300
So you're an action junkie, huh?

842
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,500
Three out of five ex-boyfriends
recently polled...

843
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:52,100
...say that I prefer to be
in a constant state of crisis.

844
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,900
Maybe I just give a shit.

845
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,600
You were good today.

846
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,400
You know that?

847
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,000
You too.

848
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,900
"--that sometimes they forgot
to close the door.

849
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,100
She also wrote
about her sister Josie...

850
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:20,700
...who was very ill
and who had to be taken to hospital."

851
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:23,900
Cheers.

852
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:29,300
So how many attacks
have there been in the area?

853
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,400
I have known most of the rebels
since they were children.

854
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:37,100
The local commander is still afraid
I will come after him with my ruler.

855
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,000
So you think because your intentions
are good, they'll spare you, huh?

856
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,000
My heart always told me
that people are inherently good.

857
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,400
My experience suggests otherwise.

858
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,400
But what about you, Mr. Archer?

859
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,200
In your long career as a journalist...

860
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,200
...would you say that people
are mostly good?

861
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,700
No.

862
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,500
I'd say they're just people.

863
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:04,600
Exactly. It is what they do
that makes them good or bad.

864
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,000
A moment of love,
even in a bad man...

865
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,800
...can give meaning to a life.

866
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,600
None of us knows which path
will lead us to God.

867
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,800
Hey!

868
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,700
It's palm wine.

869
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,900
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, yeah. It takes getting used to, huh?

870
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,600
God.

871
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:25,500
- Drank that as a boy.
- In Rhodesia?

872
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,900
I take notes.

873
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,300
The Shona...

874
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,900
The Shona have a word for me.

875
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:42,400
- It means "white boy in Africa."
- When did you leave?

876
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,700
I didn't leave.

877
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:49,200
<i>I got sent away to South Africa
in 1978 when the munts overran us.</i>

878
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,000
Then you joined the army?

879
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,100
Yeah. Yeah, I did my time in Angola.

880
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,900
- The 32 Battalion.
- That's right.

881
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:04,600
You know, contrary to what
you might think about us...

882
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:08,200
...we fought with the blacks, huh?
Yeah. Side by side.

883
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,100
There was no apartheid in a foxhole.
The colonel always used to tell us that.

884
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,700
- This is Colonel Coetzee?
- Yeah.

885
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,400
Then, of course, it's 1994.
No more army.

886
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,400
No more apartheid.

887
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,900
Truth and reconciliation
and all of that rubbish, you know.

888
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,500
Kumbaya.

889
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:32,100
We fought and died together,
you know?

890
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:35,500
Black and white. Most people back home
didn't even know we were at war.

891
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,600
We thought we were
fighting Communism...

892
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:41,600
...but in the end, it was all about
who gets what, you know?

893
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,800
Ivory, oil, gold:

894
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,500
Diamonds.

895
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,800
So one day I decided,
"Fuck it," you know?

896
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,900
"I'm gonna get mine."

897
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,700
You gonna steal his diamond?

898
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,900
That diamond is my ticket
out of this godforsaken continent.

899
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:11,000
That doesn't answer the question.

900
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,700
My dad came home
from the war in '69.

901
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,900
And it took him...

902
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,100
...about 20 years to get right.

903
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,300
What?

904
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:43,400
You Americans love to talk
about your feelings, huh?

905
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,900
So, what does that mean?
What does that mean?

906
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,200
- Got a thing for messed-up vets now?
- Shut up.

907
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,600
You lost both your parents.

908
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:55,400
That's a polite way
of putting it, yeah.

909
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,300
Mom was raped and shot...

910
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,300
...and Dad was decapitated
and hung from a hook in the barn.

911
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,600
I was 9.

912
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,800
Boohoo, right?

913
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,600
Sometimes I wonder...

914
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:26,800
...will God ever forgive us
for what we've done to each other?

915
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,300
Then I look around and I realize...

916
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:37,700
...God left this place a long time ago.

917
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,400
It's...

918
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,600
What's the point, huh?

919
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,100
Oh, shit. Keep moving, huh?

920
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,000
- What?
- Drive at them. They'll panic.

921
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,500
Do you know where the word
"infantry" comes from?

922
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:44,000
It means "child soldier."
They are just children.

923
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:47,800
- Stop! Stop! RUF on the road!
- Hi. Hello. Hello.

924
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,100
Hello, little brothers.

925
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:52,800
- RUF on the road!
- Yeah, yeah. What is your names?

926
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,600
I'm Dead Body.
Who is this motherfucker?

927
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,400
We are teachers on our way to Kono.

928
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,800
Only RUF on the road.

929
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,900
- RUF only!
- Yes, yes, I understand that.

930
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:03,500
- Only RUF!
- But son, this is--

931
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,300
Don't move! Don't move! Fuck.

932
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,900
Jesus Christ! Maddy, press your hand
against the exit wound there, huh?

933
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,400
- Got it.
- Keep it there, huh?

934
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,300
Whatever you do,
don't talk, all right?

935
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,300
Is there any wine left in that jug?

936
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,400
- Here.
- Pour it all over everything, huh?

937
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:25,800
The colonel's gonna have a medic
at the airstrip in Kono.

938
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
- How far is it?
- You said not to talk.

939
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,500
A comedian, huh?

940
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:47,100
- How's his pulse?
- I can feel it sometimes.

941
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:00,500
- Hold it right there.
- Stop.

942
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,900
Papers, please.

943
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,300
Excuse me.

944
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,400
I was just trying
to keep pressure on the wound.

945
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,100
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- You'll be all right, huh?

946
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:15,000
Will you?

947
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:18,700
I'll check on him in the tent
in a little bit. Thank you.

948
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,300
Hey.

949
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,800
Look who's alive, eh?

950
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,400
I told the H you'd be back.

951
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:29,300
I'm afraid we're evacuating
all non-military personnel, miss.

952
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,300
Transport touches down at 1600.

953
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,200
She's with me, all right?

954
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:37,100
No exceptions, pal. This is gonna be ugly.
Colonel doesn't want an audience.

955
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,000
Is I.R.'s presence here
known to other African nations?

956
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,600
- She's with you?
- Yeah.

957
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,600
Come on. The colonel's this way.

958
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,600
Give me a minute, huh?

959
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,300
We block their escape
by blowing the bridge.

960
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,600
That's correct.

961
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,700
You made it out. Well done.

962
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,800
Negative, Kilo Foxtrot, stand by.

963
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:07,100
- Colonel, sir.
- So must be real, then.

964
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:09,500
The pink.

965
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,600
Well, you're part
of this operation now.

966
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,300
First we snuff everything that moves
out there, then we find your diamond.

967
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,100
Colonel?

968
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,000
Go get kitted. Yes?

969
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,300
Move, move, move!

970
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,800
- Go get your kit.
- Will do, chum. Will do.

971
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,500
It's go time, all right?
Meet me behind the tents.

972
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,300
How's Benjamin?

973
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,000
They say he'll live.

974
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:48,600
Good. Good.

975
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,800
Listen, Maddy...

976
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,900
...I need you to do me one last favor.

977
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,400
Yeah?

978
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,000
Tell that guard
you wanna put him...

979
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,800
<i>...on the cover of Soldier of Fortune
magazine for me.</i>

980
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,100
You're going in.

981
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,800
You and Solomon.

982
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:26,900
You're going in now.

983
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,000
Your plane leaves
in a few minutes, huh?

984
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,600
You're an idiot.

985
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,700
- What if I wanted to go in with you?
- I'd say no.

986
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:43,900
- What if I insist?
- I'd insist back.

987
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,200
It's my story.

988
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:54,800
Your story is Van De Kaap, all right?
That stone is mine.

989
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:58,400
I'm not leaving here without it,
you understand?

990
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,700
Please, just give me two minutes.

991
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:20,900
Yeah.

992
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,900
- Hello.
- Hi.

993
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,300
<i>My name is Maddy Bowen.
I'm with Vital Affairs magazine.</i>

994
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,900
I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

995
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,600
Well, that depends what they are.

996
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,700
Oh, I see you're familiar
with our devious ways, aren't you?

997
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,400
Okay, so I'll start
with something simple.

998
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,700
And before that you were with
the South African Defense--?

999
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,500
- Defense Force, correct.
- Of course.

1000
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:09,100
And was that with Colonel Coetzee?
Were you in Angola?

1001
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,800
Angola, yeah.

1002
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,400
That is all I really need to know.
Thank you so much.

1003
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,100
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1004
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:28,500
Thank you, huh?

1005
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:31,100
Just keeping my end of the deal.

1006
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,000
Good luck to you, Solomon.

1007
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:34,800
Okay.

1008
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:39,800
- I hope you find what you're looking for.
- Thank you for all you have done.

1009
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,800
- Listen, I--
- No, you listen.

1010
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,300
In another life maybe, all right?

1011
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,600
Yeah. Sure.

1012
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,100
Yeah.

1013
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,600
You find yourself a good man,
all right, Maddy?

1014
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,600
You know, I've got three sisters.

1015
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:19,400
They're all married to good men.

1016
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,300
I prefer my life.

1017
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,400
Here is my office phone...

1018
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,000
...home phone, cellphone.

1019
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:37,200
I'm used to being pursued,
but what the heck.

1020
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,500
You better get on that plane, huh?

1021
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:54,200
You should get on that plane.

1022
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,200
So should you.

1023
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:11,800
You gonna call me?

1024
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,100
Soon as I'm near a phone, yeah.

1025
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,400
Yeah, right.

1026
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:45,400
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1027
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,500
Oh, shit.

1028
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,500
Nabil? Yeah, I'll call you
when we get closer, all right?

1029
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,300
You keep me posted. Right.

1030
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:01,300
All right. I set the pace, huh?
Two-hour marches, five-minute breaks.

1031
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:05,300
If I hold my hand up like this, you stop.
If I point to the dirt, you lie flat.

1032
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:09,000
If I say go, you move like your life
depended on it. Understood?

1033
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,900
- Yes, boss.
- Come on.

1034
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:23,800
Tell me about the stone.

1035
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,600
Is it clear or is it milky?

1036
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,300
Clear.

1037
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,900
And the color, is it strong?

1038
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:32,300
Does it hold the light?

1039
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,500
It is as you say.

1040
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,100
- About the size of a bird's egg?
- Yes.

1041
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:42,500
One hundred carats.
Come on, let's pick up the pace.

1042
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,400
Dia!

1043
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:29,300
Stop the truck!

1044
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,700
I thought it was Dia.

1045
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:27,200
Wake up.

1046
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:32,200
Don't worry, they're gone, huh?

1047
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:36,600
You know, I once had this buddy...

1048
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,700
...named Mabhoko.

1049
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:42,700
We used to hunt bush meat
together as kids, huh?

1050
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,800
Baboons.

1051
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,900
Baboons, they were
the hardest to catch. They're...

1052
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,300
They're cunning.

1053
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,600
Cunning creatures.

1054
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:55,500
Fast, strong.

1055
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:57,900
Got good eyesight.

1056
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,400
We would always find them
by the smell of their shit.

1057
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:07,700
And that's how we learned to track
your black terrorists in Angola, huh?

1058
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,200
By the smell of your shit.

1059
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:15,700
It's not...

1060
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:18,600
It's not the same as a baboon's.

1061
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:24,400
But, you know, after you skin it...

1062
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,000
...the flesh of a baboon...

1063
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:30,700
...isn't that much different
than a man's, you know.

1064
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:38,000
I'll tell you, I can track anything.

1065
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,400
You risk my life like that again...

1066
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,900
...and I'll peel your face
back off your head.

1067
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,700
Do you understand?

1068
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:15,000
Make us a fire.

1069
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:52,103
Hello my brother. Are you lost?

1070
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:54,814
We are headed for the mines in Kono.

1071
01:34:56,441 --> 01:35:00,528
You don't want to go that way. The
R. U. F. is in the next village.

1072
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,489
Thank you, my brother.

1073
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:07,452
And tell the poomui not to shoot me.

1074
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:12,999
He is crazy for diamonds like everybody else.

1075
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:15,376
Let's hope they don't discover oil here.

1076
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:20,798
Then we'd have real problems.

1077
01:35:21,758 --> 01:35:22,800
Thank you, my brother.

1078
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:26,900
What'd he say?

1079
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,200
We are going the right way.

1080
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,100
Hold up there, my man.
It's this way, huh?

1081
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,700
Where do you think you are going?

1082
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,100
Stop!

1083
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,000
I said, stop!

1084
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,000
He is not down there, all right?

1085
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:55,700
All right. You're gonna need
some of that old discipline, huh?

1086
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:58,200
Now you listen here, my boy,
and you listen well.

1087
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:00,300
You are not going down there.
Are we clear?

1088
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,100
You are not the master.

1089
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:05,900
Right now, that is exactly what I am,
and you'd better remember it, Kaffir!

1090
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:22,400
Don't you fucking move, huh?

1091
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:24,500
Don't you move. Don't you move, huh?

1092
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:27,000
- My son is there!
- Your son is gone!

1093
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,500
- He is alive!
- He's gone!

1094
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:31,300
He's alive! He's there
with those crazy people!

1095
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:35,900
I am his father! His father!
I should have protected him!

1096
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:40,300
I must go find him.
I cannot live without knowing!

1097
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,700
Shoot me if you want, but I'm going.

1098
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,200
Why should it matter,
I'm dead already.

1099
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:58,400
We wait until dark, huh?

1100
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:28,900
Are you satisfied?

1101
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:34,400
All right, come on.

1102
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,400
<i>--is fighting for Sierra Leone</i>

1103
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:44,600
<i>RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone</i>

1104
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,700
<i>Go tell my parents
They may see me no more</i>

1105
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:50,900
<i>In the battlefield
We're fighting forever</i>

1106
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:54,000
<i>Go tell my parents
They may see me no more</i>

1107
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,700
<i>In the battlefield...</i>

1108
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,200
You are how old?

1109
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,100
Me? I'm 31.

1110
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:04,500
And you have no wife?

1111
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:07,800
- No.
- No children?

1112
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,300
No.

1113
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,100
And no home?

1114
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,900
No.

1115
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,000
But you have money, yes?

1116
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,400
Yeah, some.

1117
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,600
But not enough?

1118
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:25,700
No.

1119
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:30,900
If you get this diamond,
you will have enough money, yes?

1120
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:34,100
Yes.

1121
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:37,100
Then you will get
a wife and children?

1122
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,600
Probably not, no.

1123
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:41,700
What?

1124
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,300
What?

1125
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:47,800
I am confused.

1126
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,300
Yeah?

1127
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:53,300
<i>That makes two of us, my bru.</i>

1128
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:59,300
Oh, Christ.
I've gotta quit smoking, huh?

1129
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:01,900
Why don't you?

1130
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:04,600
I'll tell you what, Solomon.

1131
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:09,400
You find me this diamond,
and I'll quit right then and there, huh?

1132
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,800
- You were born in Zimbabwe?
- Oh, yeah.

1133
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:23,100
- Is it beautiful there?
- Sure you're not a reporter?

1134
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:27,000
Because you ask a hell of a lot
of questions, my man.

1135
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:38,300
My grandfather told
many stories of war.

1136
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:41,400
How the Mende fought the Temne.

1137
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:45,300
Or how two tribes would fight
when somebody had stolen a woman.

1138
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:58,700
I understand white people
want our diamonds, yes?

1139
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:05,500
But how can my own people
do this to each other?

1140
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,900
I know good people...

1141
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,900
...who say there is something
wrong with us...

1142
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:20,400
...inside our black skin.

1143
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:23,900
That we were better off
when the white man ruled.

1144
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:28,600
But my son is good.

1145
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,400
And when he grows up...

1146
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:33,800
...and peace comes...

1147
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,500
...this place will be a paradise.

1148
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,800
We'll get your son back, huh?

1149
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:34,900
Where is it exactly?

1150
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,300
Through the camp, by the river.

1151
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,600
Christ.

1152
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,700
Okay.

1153
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,200
I'm gonna make contact
with the colonel.

1154
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:51,900
He'll send in an air strike.

1155
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:55,300
- What is that?
- A chopper, huh? An attack helicopter.

1156
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:58,000
- We use it as a diversion.
- What if my son is there?

1157
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,500
- He isn't.
- How do you know?

1158
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:03,300
I said we do it my way now, all right?
Don't fuck with me.

1159
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,600
Cordell, it's Danny.

1160
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:18,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up and listen, all right?

1161
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:21,100
You tell the colonel I've found the stone.

1162
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:24,300
No, I haven't got it in my hands,
but I'm OP'ing its location.

1163
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,000
It's a major rebel camp, my man.

1164
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,600
You tell him to send in the dakadak.

1165
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:32,000
Because I stole a GPS, that's how.

1166
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:34,700
If you shut up and listen,
I could give the coordinates.

1167
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:38,200
Zero-nine-zero-five-four-two-four, north.

1168
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:42,900
Three-two-seven-two-nine
three-zero-five-zero, east.

1169
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:45,400
I'll call back at midnight to confirm.

1170
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:51,100
You can look all night,
my friend, right?

1171
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:53,900
I promise you he is not there.

1172
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:01,400
They're coming in the morning, all right?

1173
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:04,000
No movement, my friend. You stay still.

1174
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:08,300
When it gets dark,
then we move in closer.

1175
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:33,500
Solomon. Shit.

1176
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:45,700
I can do it.

1177
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:46,900
- Help me.
- Help him.

1178
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:49,200
Thank you, Papa.

1179
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:33,400
Hey, you smell.

1180
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:36,000
That's fine.

1181
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:50,300
- Ready? I'm winning.
- Okay, let's go.

1182
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:52,100
Play, man.

1183
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:56,600
- Play. Play the card.
- Play.

1184
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,500
Dia.

1185
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:29,300
Leave me alone.

1186
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:33,500
- Dia. I'm your papa. Come with me.
- Hey.

1187
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:35,400
- Dia.
- Get away from me.

1188
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,400
- Dia. Dia!
- I do not know you. Traitor!

1189
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:40,300
- Enemy! Enemy!
- What the hell are you doing?

1190
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:41,700
- What are you doing?
- I don't know you!

1191
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:43,200
- What's wrong?
- I hate you!

1192
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:45,100
- Dia, come with me!
- I hate you!

1193
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,800
Get away from me!

1194
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:51,100
- Get him!
- Don't shoot!

1195
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,800
- Don't shoot! Don't--! Don't shoot!
- I hate you!

1196
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,900
- Fisherman! Traitor!
- Don't shoot!

1197
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:58,300
Get away from me!

1198
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,600
I knew you would come back.

1199
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:11,500
I have dug and dug and dug,
but I've found nothing.

1200
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:13,600
Nothing.

1201
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:15,400
Dig, dig, dig!

1202
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,900
You will find it for me.

1203
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,100
You will dig up
what you have come back for.

1204
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:22,300
No.

1205
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,900
Why should the diamond
go to the foreign devils?

1206
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:28,900
We will use it
to make the country strong.

1207
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:32,000
RUF is fighting for the people!

1208
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:37,400
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

1209
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:42,000
Pick it up.

1210
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:46,200
Why? You are going to kill me anyway.

1211
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,500
I do not need to kill you,
Solomon Vandy.

1212
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:54,500
If you do not bring me the diamond...

1213
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:56,900
...I will find the rest of your family.

1214
01:46:57,100 --> 01:46:59,500
Just as I have found your son.

1215
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:04,000
I will rape your wife
in front of your eyes...

1216
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:07,100
...slit her throat...

1217
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:10,000
...and I will keep your daughters
for myself.

1218
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,900
You think I am a devil...

1219
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:20,400
...but only because I have lived in hell.

1220
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,700
I want to get out.

1221
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:27,400
You will help me.

1222
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:31,500
I don't remember.

1223
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:34,700
Find it or your family will die!

1224
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,500
Now pick it up!

1225
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,500
- Go!
- Bastards!

1226
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:56,000
Shoot it!

1227
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Dia!

1228
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,200
Come, boy. Come. This way. This way.

1229
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:18,300
Dia!

1230
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:42,800
<i>Colonel, we think Archer's there.</i>

1231
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,800
I don't give a damn who's down there.
Kill them all.

1232
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:57,400
Dia!

1233
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:13,500
I'm coming!

1234
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,700
- Dia!
- Bastard!

1235
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:43,200
No!

1236
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:04,700
Dia!

1237
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:13,800
- We found his digger, sir.
- Keep him close.

1238
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:18,000
- Danny boy.
- Colonel.

1239
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:21,500
- Thanks for calling it in.
- Yeah, yeah. Always happy to help, huh?

1240
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:25,000
So where is it? The stone?

1241
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:27,100
We split, huh? Fifty-fifty, all right?

1242
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:28,900
Look around you, Danny boy.

1243
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:32,100
You're not in a position
to be dictating terms.

1244
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,300
Then you will never find it, sir.

1245
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:36,100
That's correct.

1246
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:40,400
- But he will.
- Come. Up.

1247
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:44,300
Introduce me to your digger.

1248
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:47,600
Solomon Vandy.

1249
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:49,900
This is Colonel Coetzee.
He wants the diamond.

1250
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:53,100
- No more than you.
- Fuck.

1251
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:55,300
You gonna show us where it's hidden?

1252
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,600
Does he speak English?

1253
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:02,800
He will only tell me, sir.
I promise you that.

1254
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:06,700
- Let me talk to him, huh?
- Go on.

1255
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,900
All right, my friend.

1256
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
End of the line here, huh?

1257
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:21,400
- You just tell him where it is, all right?
- I do not trust him.

1258
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:25,000
I don't trust him either,
but we haven't got much of a choice here.

1259
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:29,800
I promise you
he will shoot us both in the head.

1260
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:33,000
Right, tell him, huh?
Tell him where it is, huh?

1261
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:35,800
- Go on. Come on.
- I'm not feeling the love, Danny.

1262
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,800
All right.
No more messing about, all right?

1263
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,000
I said tell him where it is!
Tell him where it is! Now!

1264
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:44,800
Tell him!

1265
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,800
- No.
- Fucking--

1266
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,700
Danny, there are other ways
to do this, okay?

1267
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:52,500
Yeah, yeah.

1268
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:03,700
- If he tells us, do we have a deal, sir?
- Seventy-thirty.

1269
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:06,200
Sixty-forty. I've already lined up a buyer.

1270
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,100
Agreed.

1271
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:14,800
Come here.

1272
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:20,800
This is his son. Vandy will do
whatever you want for his sake, all right?

1273
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,800
Danny, you're a pisser, man. Well done.
Boys, we move out.

1274
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:30,800
What do you say, Mr. Vandy?

1275
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:34,200
- You ready to take a walk?
- Come on.

1276
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:42,100
Come on.

1277
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,100
So who's the buyer?
I'm guessing London.

1278
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:01,600
Well, they no longer accept
conflict diamonds, huh?

1279
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:04,200
Wouldn't hurt to interest
some other parties.

1280
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:07,800
- Start a bidding war.
- What, one war's not enough for you, huh?

1281
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:10,400
I missed you, Danny.

1282
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:14,900
See? It is here.
He has tried to find it.

1283
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,700
All right, Mr. Vandy.
Time for you to start digging.

1284
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:35,100
<i>Hey, boet, have you got a smoke?</i>

1285
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:37,400
Smoking will kill you.

1286
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:39,700
Sorry.

1287
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:44,700
It's all right.

1288
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:47,000
Time I quit smoking anyway,
huh, Solomon?

1289
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:02,800
- It's gone.
- What?

1290
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,100
Someone has taken it.

1291
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:10,000
This is where I buried it.
It isn't here.

1292
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:13,800
Well, then there's no reason
for any of you to stay alive. Is there?

1293
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:19,800
Wait, wait, wait.

1294
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,200
I know, I know. I know where it is.

1295
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:24,700
- I know where it is.
- It better be there.

1296
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:30,800
Yes.

1297
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,400
Oh, here, here.
It is here.

1298
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,200
- Yeah? Yeah, there it is.
- Yes.

1299
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:38,800
Fuck!

1300
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:59,400
TIA, huh, Danny?

1301
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:02,400
TIA.

1302
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:12,700
Keep digging, huh?
They'll be here any second. Come on.

1303
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,200
Keep digging.

1304
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:31,800
- It had better be there, huh?
- Yes, yes.

1305
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,400
Have you got it?

1306
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:41,100
- Have you got it, huh?
- Yes, got it. Oh, yes.

1307
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:43,800
Oh, yes.

1308
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,600
Solomon.

1309
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:57,400
Dia, what are you doing?

1310
01:56:57,900 --> 01:56:59,400
Dia.

1311
01:57:00,222 --> 01:57:01,514
Look at me.

1312
01:57:01,700 --> 01:57:03,600
What are you doing?

1313
01:57:06,102 --> 01:57:08,271
You are Dia Vandy.

1314
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:09,800
Of the proud Mende tribe.

1315
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:20,600
You are a good boy
who loves soccer and school.

1316
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:26,100
Your mother loves you so much.

1317
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,300
She waits by the fire making plantains...

1318
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:34,100
...and red palm oil stew
with your sister N'Yanda...

1319
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:38,700
...and the new baby.

1320
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:49,800
The cows wait for you.

1321
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:55,800
And Babu, the wild dog
who minds no one but you.

1322
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:01,700
I know they made you do bad things...

1323
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:04,400
...but you are not a bad boy.

1324
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:10,000
I am your father...

1325
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:14,000
...who loves you.

1326
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:19,000
And you will come home with me
and be my son again.

1327
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:46,800
Solomon, we've got to move, huh?

1328
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,500
We've got to--

1329
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:54,400
Go, go! Move!

1330
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:58,700
Move. Move.

1331
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:00,200
Move, move, move!

1332
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,400
Move! Move! Move!

1333
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,300
How far?

1334
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:08,500
There's an airstrip
at the top of that gorge.

1335
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:10,800
A plane will meet us, huh?

1336
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:13,500
Hey, stop. Stop.

1337
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:19,800
Give it to me.
Come on, give it to me, huh?

1338
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:30,400
Keep moving. They'll be tracking us.

1339
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:38,800
Nabil, where are you?

1340
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:42,500
I'm nearly there.
Tell me what's happening.

1341
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:46,100
We're about 10 K's out, huh?
We've got it, my friend.

1342
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:48,200
<i>- Who is we?
- The fisherman and his son.</i>

1343
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:49,900
<i>Lose them.</i>

1344
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:06,200
It's at the top of that ridge there, huh?

1345
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,700
You must stop and rest.

1346
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:10,700
What? And give up the damn stone?

1347
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,900
Keep moving. Come on.

1348
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:49,900
Come. Come, come.

1349
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,300
I can't. Stop.

1350
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:41,500
- Okay.
- Stop.

1351
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,100
Come on.

1352
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:14,300
No! God, no. Stop.

1353
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:18,700
Christ. No more. No more.

1354
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:04,400
Take it, huh?

1355
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:10,000
- Mr. Archer--
- Take it, take it.

1356
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,800
I thought you would steal it from me.

1357
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:24,300
Yeah, yeah, it occurred to me, huh?

1358
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:36,900
Listen...

1359
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:42,200
...this is Maddy's card, huh?

1360
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:44,600
You call her when
you get to Conakry, all right?

1361
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:50,800
And don't trust that pilot for a second.

1362
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:54,000
You point this at his head
if he fucks around, all right?

1363
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:55,700
I can carry you.

1364
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:10,000
You take your boy home, huh?

1365
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:17,900
You take him home, huh?

1366
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:24,200
- Go! Go!
- Go. Come on.

1367
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,100
Go on!

1368
02:04:31,900 --> 02:04:33,700
Come on. Come on.

1369
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:42,900
Archer, you're a dead man!

1370
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:44,900
Yeah, yeah.

1371
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:17,000
Dia.

1372
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:39,300
Hello. Maddy Bowen.

1373
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:41,400
Yeah.

1374
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:43,400
Thought I'd never call, huh?

1375
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:48,400
And I'm so glad you did.
Excuse me.

1376
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:51,500
When am I gonna see you?

1377
02:05:52,700 --> 02:05:58,400
Maddy, I want you to do me
one more favor, huh?

1378
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:03,600
I want you to go meet Solomon
in Conakry.

1379
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:06,500
In Guinea?
Why do you want me to go to Guinea?

1380
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:11,600
We found his son...

1381
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:16,000
...but he's gonna need some help,
you understand?

1382
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:17,900
<i>Maddy?</i>

1383
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:22,500
You're hurt.

1384
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:24,200
Are you hurt?

1385
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:27,600
Yeah, well, I've got
a little problem here.

1386
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:35,800
Okay. You--
You tell me where you are.

1387
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:40,100
<i>Archer?</i>

1388
02:06:52,300 --> 02:06:57,000
I'm looking at an incredible view
right now.

1389
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:00,100
I wish you were here, Maddy.

1390
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:03,900
Okay, then I'm coming to be with you.
You just tell me where you are.

1391
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:08,400
I don't think so.

1392
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:11,900
Are you still in Kono? Because I can
get someone there to help you.

1393
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:16,400
Maddy, you find someplace safe
for the boy, all right?

1394
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:19,000
<i>And keep him out of sight.</i>

1395
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:22,300
<i>And get Solomon to London.</i>

1396
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:28,200
He's bringing something with him.

1397
02:07:28,900 --> 02:07:30,800
But he's gonna need your help.

1398
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,900
Why aren't you bringing it yourself?

1399
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:40,400
I'm saying it's a real story now.

1400
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:43,100
And you can write the hell out of it.

1401
02:07:50,300 --> 02:07:52,800
I'm really happy I met you.

1402
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:55,400
You know that?

1403
02:07:58,700 --> 02:08:00,900
Yeah, I'm...

1404
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:05,100
I'm really happy I met you too.

1405
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:09,700
<i>And I wish I could be there with you.</i>

1406
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:12,600
That's all right.

1407
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:17,500
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

1408
02:09:11,100 --> 02:09:13,500
When we get to the stairs,
you just keep walking...

1409
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:15,700
...and I'll wait for you here.

1410
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:17,800
You're not coming.

1411
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:21,200
I'm not here. Good luck.

1412
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:45,500
You must understand, Mr. Vandy...

1413
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:51,800
...that your diamond could have ended up
nowhere else but with us.

1414
02:09:55,100 --> 02:09:58,000
- It is not enough.
- I assure you, 2 million pounds...

1415
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:02,100
...is more than anyone else will offer you
for that stone under the circumstances.

1416
02:10:02,300 --> 02:10:04,900
I want what was promised to me
by Mr. Archer.

1417
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:11,000
- What was promised to you?
- My family.

1418
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:13,300
When they are here,
you will get the stone.

1419
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,600
I will have the money too.

1420
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:18,400
Well, may I see what I'm buying?

1421
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:21,400
You will get the stone
once my family is here.

1422
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:23,900
How do I even know you've got it?

1423
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:34,600
Can you comment on the diamonds
mined in Sierra Leone?

1424
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:38,700
I'm not going to comment
on some sensationalist magazine article.

1425
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:41,400
- What about Liberia?
- No comment. No comment.

1426
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:44,000
- Mr. Van De Kaap--
- That's all I have to say.

1427
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:45,600
The natural resources
of a country...

1428
02:12:45,708 --> 02:12:47,376
Kimberley, South Africa
January, 2000

1429
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:50,600
...are the property of its people.
They are not ours to steal...

1430
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:57,300
<i>...or exploit in the name of our comfort,
our corporations, or our consumerism.</i>

1431
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:09,300
They're ready for you, sir.

1432
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:13,200
The Third World is not a world apart.

1433
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:18,100
And the witness you will hear today
speaks on its behalf.

1434
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:22,100
Let us hear the voice of that world.
Let us learn from that voice.

1435
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:25,800
And let us ignore it no more.

1436
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Solomon Vandy.
