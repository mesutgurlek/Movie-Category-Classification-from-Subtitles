I want you to know my real name.
It's Chihiro.

Haku, listen.

I just remembered something
from a long time ago.
I think it may help you.

1234
01:53:43,716 --> 01:53:47,652
<i>Once, when I was little,</i>
<i>I dropped my shoe into a river.</i>

1235
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:51,212
And when I tried
to get it back, I fell in.

1236
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:54,885
I thought I'd drown, but the water
carried me to shore.

1237
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,554
It finally came back to me.

1238
01:53:57,629 --> 01:54:00,723
The river's name was
the Kalaku River.

1239
01:54:00,799 --> 01:54:04,633
<i>I think that was you,</i>
<i>and your real name is Kalaku River!</i>

You did it, Chihiro! I remember.

01:54:28,394 --> 01:54:30,692
I was the spirit of the Kalaku River.

1243
01:54:30,763 --> 01:54:34,392
- A river spirit?
- My name is the Kalaku River.

1244
01:54:34,466 --> 01:54:37,162
They filled in that river.
It's all apartments now.

1245
01:54:37,236 --> 01:54:40,034
That must be why I can't
find my way home, Chihiro.

1246
01:54:40,105 --> 01:54:43,734
I remember you falling into my river,
and I remember your little pink shoe.

1247
01:54:43,809 --> 01:54:46,972
So you're the one who carried me back
into shallow water.

01:54:47,046 --> 01:54:50,379
You saved me.
I knew you were good.
