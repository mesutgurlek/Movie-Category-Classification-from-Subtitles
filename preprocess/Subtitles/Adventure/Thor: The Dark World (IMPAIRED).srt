The Nine Realms are not eternal.

But before that dawn

481
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:10,521
the dark forces, the Dark Elves,
reigned absolute and unchallenged.

485
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,943
Their leader Malekith made a

486
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,618
and it was called the Aether.

While the other relics
often appear as stones

488
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,496
the Aether is fluid
and everchanging.

489
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,252
It changes matter into dark matter.

490

It seeks out host bodies, drawing
strength from their life-force.

491
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,177
Malekith sought to use
the Aether's power

492
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:46,090
to return the universe
to one of darkness.
