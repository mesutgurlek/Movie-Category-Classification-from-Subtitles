You will go.

503
00:58:55,909 --> 00:58:59,140
And you will go.

504
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:02,443
That is all I have to say.

505
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,330
Welcome.

506
00:59:24,404 --> 00:59:25,837
Welcome.

Hi!

508
00:59:36,482 --> 00:59:38,416
Come.

509
00:59:38,484 --> 00:59:40,418
Please, sit down.

510
00:59:40,486 --> 00:59:42,545
Sit down.

511
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,640
Wait just a minute.

512
01:00:14,454 --> 01:00:16,513
His mind is gone.

513
01:00:23,863 --> 01:00:25,854
Tatanka.

514
01:00:29,769 --> 01:00:30,793
Tatanka.

515
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:33,168
Tanka?

Tatanka.

Tatanka.

01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:44,616
Tatanka.

521
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:46,276
Tatanka. Buffalo.

01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:50,246
Buffalo.

525
01:00:51,657 --> 01:00:52,919
Buff?

526
01:00:52,992 --> 01:00:55,358
Buff--Buff--

01:00:56,696 --> 01:00:58,755
Buffalo.
Tatanka.

529
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:04,559
The Fierce One, as I call him,
seems very tough.

530
01:01:04,637 --> 01:01:07,538
I hope I never
have to fight him.

531
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,108
He seems honest
and very direct.

532
01:01:10,176 --> 01:01:12,235
I like The Quiet One
immensely.

533
01:01:12,345 --> 01:01:15,576
He's patient, inquisitive,
and seems eager to communicate.

534
01:01:15,648 --> 01:01:20,085
I would conclude he's a man
of weight among his people.

535
01:01:20,153 --> 01:01:22,212
Buffalo.

I believe I made a greater impression
on their next visit.

538
01:01:32,765 --> 01:01:34,596
I produced
a coffee grinder,

539
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:37,727
something none of them
had seen before.

540
01:01:55,021 --> 01:01:56,283
Is the coffee not good?

541
01:01:56,355 --> 01:01:58,823
It's too
strong, maybe.

542
01:01:58,891 --> 01:02:00,381
Too strong,
maybe.

543
01:02:02,795 --> 01:02:04,194
Sugar.

544
01:02:04,263 --> 01:02:05,958

545
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:12,597
Um...

546
01:02:12,705 --> 01:02:13,694
Ta--

547
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,176
Taste it.

548
01:02:27,653 --> 01:02:29,746
Sugar.

549
01:02:29,822 --> 01:02:31,847
You want some?

550
01:02:31,924 --> 01:02:33,721
You want some?

551
01:02:39,132 --> 01:02:41,032
That's a lot.

552
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,398
It's good to have company.

553
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:45,198
So much goes unsaid.

554
01:02:45,271 --> 01:02:48,729
I feel these people,
The Quiet One in particular,

555
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:50,639
want something from me.

556
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:53,372
Made presents of coffee
and most of the sugar.

557

Don't believe
I'd go too far in saying

558
01:02:56,649 --> 01:02:59,550
a foundation for good relations
is being laid.

560
01:03:08,961 --> 01:03:11,486
We will talk a while.

561
01:03:19,639 --> 01:03:22,369
Your wounds are healing well?

562
01:03:23,743 --> 01:03:26,337
Yes, they are.

563
01:03:30,316 --> 01:03:32,841
You are happy here,
with my family?

564
01:03:32,919 --> 01:03:34,750
I am glad to be here.

565
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:39,757
I am missing my husband.

566
01:03:41,994 --> 01:03:45,486
Perhaps you will marry again
when the time is right?

567
01:03:45,565 --> 01:03:46,827
Perhaps.

568
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:56,874
We have word from many places
that the whites are coming.

569
01:03:58,244 --> 01:04:00,371
They are coming
into everyone's country.

570
01:04:00,446 --> 01:04:03,244
I think they
will soon be in ours.

571
01:04:03,316 --> 01:04:05,978
This white man who lives
at the old soldier fort...

572
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:08,953
I have visited him and I believe
his heart is a good one.

573
01:04:15,761 --> 01:04:18,059
I am afraid of the white man
at the fort.

574
01:04:19,198 --> 01:04:23,726
I am afraid he will tell others
that I am here.

575
01:04:23,836 --> 01:04:25,895
I am afraid they will
try to take me away.

576
01:04:26,005 --> 01:04:27,973
I've heard they
take people away.

577
01:04:28,241 --> 01:04:30,539
Every warrior in camp
would fight them if they tried.

578
01:04:30,643 --> 01:04:33,134
I cannot make
the white man language.

579
01:04:33,246 --> 01:04:36,340
He cannot speak Sioux.

580
01:04:37,283 --> 01:04:40,218
It has been a long time
since I made the talk.

581
01:04:40,286 --> 01:04:42,652
I want you to try.

582
01:04:43,322 --> 01:04:44,983
I don't know how.

583
01:04:45,057 --> 01:04:46,388
Yes, you do.

584
01:04:46,459 --> 01:04:48,290
I can't.

585
01:04:49,228 --> 01:04:51,526
I can't.
It's dead in me.

586
01:04:52,398 --> 01:04:56,664
I don't ask this for myself.
I ask this for all the people.

587
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,462
He knows things about the whites
which we do not.

588
01:05:00,573 --> 01:05:02,905
Now, you must remember.

589
01:05:06,078 --> 01:05:08,103
I can't.

590
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:22,253
Will she make the white words?

591
01:05:22,328 --> 01:05:26,560
She won't try.
She is being difficult.

592
01:05:26,632 --> 01:05:29,066
Well, she's the one
who's crying.

is yours.

Nothing I've been told

They are not beggars

been made out to be.

Most progress has been built on failure
rather than success.

about the woman

There are no buffalo.
