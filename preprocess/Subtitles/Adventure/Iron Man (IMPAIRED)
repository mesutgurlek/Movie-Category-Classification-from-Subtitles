Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

201
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,788
No. The Springs was actually

Like what?

615
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:12,097
You want us to
make baby bottles?

616
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:15,401
I think we should take
another look into
arc reactor technology.

617
00:47:15,468 --> 00:47:20,072
Ah, come on.
The arc reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!

618
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,275
Tony, come on.
We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

619
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:26,879
It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

620
00:47:26,946 --> 00:47:28,447
The arc was
never cost effective.

621
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,249
We knew that
before we built it.

622
00:47:30,316 --> 00:47:33,452
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

623
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,120
Maybe.

624
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:37,756
Huh? Am I right?
We haven't had a breakthrough
in that in what?

625
00:47:37,824 --> 00:47:39,858
30 years.
- That's what they say.

626
00:47:42,996 --> 00:47:45,230
Could you have
a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

627
00:47:45,298 --> 00:47:48,500
Never mind who told me.
Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

628
00:47:48,568 --> 00:47:50,836
I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

629
00:47:59,312 --> 00:48:00,746
Okay.
- Okay?

630
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,284
It works.

631
00:48:09,456 --> 00:48:13,659
Listen to me, Tony.
We're a team.
Do you understand?

632
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:16,995
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

633
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:18,497
like your father and I.

634
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:20,366
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

635
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:22,001
But if I had...
- Tony.

636
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:25,104
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

637
00:48:25,171 --> 00:48:28,440
You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

638
00:48:28,508 --> 00:48:30,676
You gotta let me
handle this.

639

We're gonna have to play
a whole different
kind of ball now.

640
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:35,080
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

641
00:48:35,148 --> 00:48:38,617
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

Let's see them.

Let's see them.

657
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:28,600
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

658
00:49:28,668 --> 00:49:31,937
I just need your
help for a sec.

659
00:49:32,005 --> 00:49:34,206
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

660
00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:37,576
It was.
It is now an antique.

661
00:49:37,644 --> 00:49:40,446
This is what will
be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

662
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:42,514
I'm swapping it up
for an upgraded unit,

663
00:49:42,582 --> 00:49:45,317
and I just ran into
a little speed bump.

664
00:49:45,385 --> 00:49:46,785
Speed bump,
what does that mean?

665
00:49:46,853 --> 00:49:48,187
It's nothing.
It's just a little snag.

666
00:49:48,254 --> 00:49:51,623
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

667
00:49:51,691 --> 00:49:54,827
And it's contacting the
socket wall and causing
a little bit of a short.

668
00:49:54,894 --> 00:49:57,396
It's fine.

669
00:49:57,464 --> 00:49:59,398
What do you want me to do?
- Put that on
the table over there.

670
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:01,266
That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

671
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:06,338
I want you to reach in,
and you're just gonna
gently lift the wire out.

672
00:50:06,406 --> 00:50:08,474
Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

673
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,209
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

674
00:50:10,276 --> 00:50:11,643
the socket wall
or it goes "beep."

675
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:12,811
What do you mean,
"Operation"?

676
00:50:12,879 --> 00:50:14,213
It's just a game,
never mind.

677
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,283
Just gently lift the wire.
Okay? Great.
- Okay.

678
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:22,654
You know,
I don't think that I'm
qualified to do this.

679
00:50:22,722 --> 00:50:26,792
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable,
qualified,

You're gonna do great.

681
00:50:31,664 --> 00:50:33,632
Is it too much of
a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

682
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,368
Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

683
00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:37,336
Okay.

684
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:43,509
Oh, there's pus!

685
00:50:43,576 --> 00:50:48,213
It's not pus.
It's an inorganic plasmic
discharge from the device,

686
00:50:48,281 --> 00:50:50,215
not from my body.
- It smells!

687
00:50:50,283 --> 00:50:52,117
Yeah, it does.

688
00:50:52,185 --> 00:50:53,519
The copper wire.

689
00:50:53,586 --> 00:50:54,887
The copper wire,
you got it?

690
00:50:54,954 --> 00:50:56,088
Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

691
00:50:56,156 --> 00:50:57,489
Now, don't let it

I'm sorry.

That's what
I was trying to
tell you before.

695
00:51:02,195 --> 00:51:03,896
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull
it out, you don't...

696
00:51:03,963 --> 00:51:05,831
There's a magnet
at the end of it!
That was it.

698

- Okay, I was not expecting...

699
00:51:08,668 --> 00:51:10,369
Don't put it back in!
Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

700
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:12,371

yanked it out like a trout...

702

What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry.
Take this. Take this.

703
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,445
You gotta switch
it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

704
00:51:19,512 --> 00:51:21,347
Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

705
00:51:21,414 --> 00:51:22,448
Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

706
00:51:22,515 --> 00:51:25,584
I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

707
00:51:25,652 --> 00:51:29,722
Okay, you're gonna attach
that to the base plate.

I'll tell you,
in my experience,

733
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:52,071
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump
a pilot's instinct,

734
00:52:52,138 --> 00:52:53,572
his insight,

735
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,508
that ability to look
into a situation
beyond the obvious

736
00:52:56,576 --> 00:53:00,279
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

Look who fell
out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

740
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:07,453
Hello, sir.
- Speaking of
manned or unmanned,

741
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,388
you gotta get him
to tell you about the
time he guessed wrong

742
00:53:09,456 --> 00:53:12,091
at spring break.
Just remember that,
spring break, 1987.

743
00:53:12,158 --> 00:53:13,459
That lovely lady
you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

744
00:53:13,526 --> 00:53:14,927
What was his name?
- Don't do that.

745
00:53:14,994 --> 00:53:16,095
Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.

746
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:17,396
They'll believe it.
Don't do that.

747
00:53:17,464 --> 00:53:18,964
Okay.
- Don't do that.

748
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:21,266

- Give us a couple minutes,
you guys.

750
00:53:24,104 --> 00:53:25,804
I'm surprised.
- Why?

751
00:53:25,872 --> 00:53:29,141
I swear,
I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

752
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:31,043
I'm doing a little
better than walking.

753
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:33,212
Really?
- Yeah.

754
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:36,015
Rhodey, I'm working on
something big.

755
00:53:36,082 --> 00:53:40,185
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

756
00:53:40,253 --> 00:53:42,755
You're about to make
a whole lot of people
around here real happy,

757
00:53:42,822 --> 00:53:45,824
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

758
00:53:45,892 --> 00:53:47,793
that was a doozy.

759
00:53:47,861 --> 00:53:52,398
This is not for the military.
I'm not... It's different.

760
00:53:52,465 --> 00:53:55,100
What? You're
a humanitarian now
or something?

761
00:53:55,168 --> 00:53:56,602
I need you to listen to me.
- No.

762
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:00,272

Let's get this
show on the road.

1504
01:54:57,897 --> 01:55:00,265
You know,
it's actually
not that bad.

1505
01:55:00,333 --> 01:55:02,634
Even I don't think
I'm Iron Man.

1506
01:55:02,702 --> 01:55:04,269
You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

1507
01:55:04,337 --> 01:55:06,805
You're not.
- All right,
suit yourself.

1508
01:55:06,873 --> 01:55:10,876
You know, if I were Iron Man,
I'd have this girlfriend
who knew my true identity.

1509
01:55:10,944 --> 01:55:12,411
She'd be a wreck,
'cause she'd always
be worrying

1510
01:55:12,479 --> 01:55:13,512
that I was going to die,

1511
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:15,981
yet so proud of
the man I'd become.

1512
01:55:16,049 --> 01:55:19,418
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1513
01:55:20,387 --> 01:55:21,420
(CLEARS THROAT)

1514
01:55:21,488 --> 01:55:22,588
crazy about me.

1515
01:55:22,655 --> 01:55:24,323
Tell me you never
think about that night.

1516
01:55:24,391 --> 01:55:26,225
What night?
- You know.

1517
01:55:29,195 --> 01:55:34,733
Are you talking about
the night that we danced
and went up on the roof,

1518
01:55:36,569 --> 01:55:42,174
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1519
01:55:42,242 --> 01:55:45,210
and you left me there,
by myself?

1520
01:55:46,713 --> 01:55:49,281
Is that the night
you're talking about?

1521
01:55:49,349 --> 01:55:50,149
Mmm-hmm.

1522
01:55:51,418 --> 01:55:52,151
Thought so.

1523
01:55:55,221 --> 01:55:58,991
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all,
Miss Potts.

1524
01:55:59,059 --> 01:56:02,661
<i>And now, Mr. Stark has</i>
<i>prepared a statement.</i>

1525
01:56:02,729 --> 01:56:05,264
<i>He will not be</i>
<i>taking any questions.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

1526
01:56:09,936 --> 01:56:12,304
<i>Been a while since</i>
<i>I was in front of you.</i>

1527
01:56:12,372 --> 01:56:13,906
<i>I figure I'll stick</i>
<i>to the cards this time.</i>

1528
01:56:13,973 --> 01:56:15,074
(ALL LAUGHING)

1529
01:56:15,508 --> 01:56:17,409
(CLEARS THROAT)

1530
01:56:17,477 --> 01:56:20,079
<i>There's been speculation</i>
<i>that I was involved in</i>
<i>the events that occurred</i>

1531
01:56:20,146 --> 01:56:21,814
<i>on the freeway</i>
<i>and the rooftop...</i>

1532
01:56:21,881 --> 01:56:24,316
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark,
but do you honestly
expect us to believe that

1533
01:56:24,384 --> 01:56:28,153
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that
conveniently appeared,

1534
01:56:28,221 --> 01:56:31,357
despite the fact that you...
<i>I know that it's confusing.</i>

1535
01:56:31,424 --> 01:56:35,060
<i>It is one thing to question</i>
<i>the official story,</i>
<i>and another thing entirely</i>

1536
01:56:35,128 --> 01:56:38,397
<i>to make wild accusations,</i>
<i>or insinuate</i>
<i>that I'm a superhero.</i>

1537
01:56:38,465 --> 01:56:40,099
I never said
you were a superhero.

1538
01:56:40,166 --> 01:56:41,900
<i>Didn't?</i>
<i>- Mmm-mmm.</i>

1539
01:56:41,968 --> 01:56:45,137
<i>Well, good,</i>
<i>because that would be</i>
<i>outlandish and fantastic.</i>

1540
01:56:45,939 --> 01:56:47,406
(TONY SIGHS)

1541
01:56:47,474 --> 01:56:51,210
<i>I'm just not</i>
<i>the hero type.</i>
<i>Clearly.</i>

1542
01:56:51,277 --> 01:56:54,346
<i>With this laundry list</i>
<i>of character defects,</i>

1543
01:56:54,414 --> 01:56:55,781
<i>all the mistakes I've made,</i>

1544
01:56:55,849 --> 01:56:57,516
<i>largely public.</i>

1545
01:56:57,584 --> 01:56:59,218
(SOFTLY) Just stick to
the cards, man.

1546
01:56:59,285 --> 01:57:00,719
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1547
01:57:03,123 --> 01:57:04,623
<i>The truth is</i>

1548
01:57:10,830 --> 01:57:12,297
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

1549
01:57:12,365 --> 01:57:13,365
(ALL CLAMORING)

(DOOR OPENS)

1551
02:05:15,515 --> 02:05:16,782
Jarvis!

1552
02:05:16,850 --> 02:05:18,317
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

1553
02:05:22,022 --> 02:05:27,793
"I am Iron Man."
You think you're the only
superhero in the world?

1554
02:05:27,861 --> 02:05:31,130
Mr. Stark,
you've become part
of a bigger universe.

1555
02:05:31,197 --> 02:05:33,432
You just don't
know it yet.

1556
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:35,401
Who the hell are you?

1557
02:05:35,468 --> 02:05:38,007
Nick Fury,
Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1558
02:05:39,039 --> 02:05:40,439
Ah.

1559
02:05:40,507 --> 02:05:42,808
I'm here
to talk to you about
the Avenger Initiative.
