it's a family travel tradition.

00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,586
Get over here!
I got to talk to you!

649
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,359
MARV: Whoa! Whoa!

650
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,027
Would you like a scarf?

651
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,833
Forget the scarf, Marv.
We got to talk.

652
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,232
We don't have the equipment
to pull off anything big--

653
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,402
you know, your banks,
jewelry stores.

654
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,036
We don't want goods.

655
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:12,082
We need cash,
and we need it now.

656
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,583
MARV: How about, uh...

657
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,084
hotels?

658
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,814
Tourists carry lots of cash.

659
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:18,321
There's no guarantees.

660
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:19,652
I got a better idea.

661
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,953
Stores don't deposit cash
on Christmas Eve.

662
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,426
The only stores
that'll have cash on hand...

663
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:27,555
are ones that deal
in moderate-priced goods.

664
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,031
MARV: Right...right.

665
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:32,593
HARRY: What stores make
lots of cash Christmas Eve...

666
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:34,866
that nobody's going to think
to rob?

667
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:36,833
Candy stores.

668
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,100
Nine-year-olds
rob candy stores, Marv.

669
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,240
This is what I had in mind.

670
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:46,007
MARV: That's brilliant, Harry.

671
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,448
Brilliant!

672
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,280
HARRY: Yep.
There's nobody dumb enough...

673
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:54,017
to knock off a toy store
on Christmas Eve.

674
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,616
Oh, yes, there is.

675

DRlVER: Here we are, sir...

676
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,146
Duncan's Toy Chest.

677
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,474
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

678
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:06,353
This is the greatest accident
of my life.

679
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,775
Marv. Marv!

680
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,478
Hey, nice house,
but there's no bathroom in it.

681
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:33,853
MARV: What's the plan?

682

HARRY: Everybody leaves
for a nice holiday off.

683
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,259
We come out
of our little houses...

684
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,426
Yeah, then what?

685
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,833
We empty the registers and
walk out like we own the joint.

686
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,564

Oh, yes. Let me see.

You shopping alone?

693

In New York?

694

Sir, I'm afraid
of my own shadow.

CASHlER: That'll be $23.75.

700
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:19,728
My, my, my!

701

Where did you get
all that money?

702
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,897
Uh...I have a lot
of grandmothers.

703
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,068
CASHlER: Oh.

704
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,134
Well, that explains it.

705
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,043
This is a really nice store--

706
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:35,084
one of the finer toy dealerships
I've ever visited.

707
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,449
CASHlER: Oh, well, thank you.

708
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:38,454
KEVlN: Mr. Duncan
must be a pretty nice guy...

709
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,490
Ietting all the kids
come into his store...

710
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,991
and play with his toys.

711
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,925
Most toy stores prohibit that.

712
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,485
-Oh, is that so?
-Yep.

713
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,929
Well, he loves kids.

714
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,432
As a matter of fact...

715
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,934
all the money
the store takes in today...

716
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:55,598
Mr. Duncan is donating it
to the Children's Hospital...

717
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,937
and the day after Christmas...

718
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:01,138
we empty all the money
in the cash register...

719
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,669
and Mr. Duncan just takes it
right down to the hospital.

720
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:06,340
That's very generous of him.

721
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:10,113
Well, children
bring him a lot of joy...

722
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:13,452
as they do to everyone
who appreciates them.

723
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,623
I'm not supposed to spend
this money...

724
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:22,723
but I have twenty dollars
from shoveling snow...

725
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:24,063
in a jar in our garage...

726
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,035
where my older brother
can't find it.

727
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,196
So I'll pay my mother back
with that.

728
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,206
You can give this
to Mr. Duncan.

729
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,504
The hospital
needs it more than I do.

730
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,533
Besides, I'll probably
spend it on stuff...

731
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,308
that'll rot my teeth
and my mind.

732

that's very sweet of you.

for your generosity...

I'm going to let you select
an object from that tree...

that you can take home with you.

I could have two?

742
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,535
Well, two turtledoves.

I'll tell you what you do.

744
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,745
You keep one...

and you give the other one
to a very special person.

You see...

747
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,113
turtledoves are a symbol
of friendship and love.

748
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:25,554
As long as each of you
have your turtledove...

you'll be friends forever.

01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,820
If I'm bothering you,
I can leave.

975
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,727
Am I bothering you?

976
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:44,127
No.

977
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,761
Good.
I'm not a pain in the butt?

978
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:51,032
No.

979
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:57,336
Will those pigeons
come back on their own...

980
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,779
or do you have to call them?

981
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,319
WOMAN: Give me your hand.

982
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:16,888
They can hear it.

983
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,974
This is great.

984
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:41,688
It's pretty cold out.

985
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,192
I could sure go
for a cup of hot chocolate.

986
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,694
How about you? My treat.

987
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:54,397
KEVlN: I'd hate to spend
Christmas Eve in Central Park.

988
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:56,803
Can we go someplace warm?

989
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:58,932
WOMAN: Yes. I know a place.

990
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:10,041
[Playing "Adeste Fideles"]

991
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:47,582
KEVlN: Nice music.

992
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:51,192
This place is great.

993
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:54,752
WOMAN: I've heard the world's
great music from here.

994
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:59,256
Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie...

995
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:01,326
Frank Sinatra...

996
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:02,802
Luciano Pavarotti.

997
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:10,474
So, do you bring your friends
up here?

998
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,179
I haven't got many friends.

999
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,616
Oh. Sorry.

1000
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:18,948
I'm like the birds I care for.

1001
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:21,753
People pass me in the street.

1002
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,258
They see me,
but they try to ignore me.

1003
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:26,818
They'd prefer
I wasn't part of their city.

1004
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:28,193
Yeah.

1005
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:30,221
It's sorta like that
with my family.

1006
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:32,234
I'm kinda the pigeon
of the house...

1007
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:34,133
just because I'm the youngest.

1008
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,494
Everyone fights for position.

1009
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,168
Everybody wants to be seen...

1010
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:40,334
and heard.

1011
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,139
I guess so.

1012
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,237
I'm seen and heard
pretty much...

1013
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,271
but then I get sent
to my room a lot, too.

1014
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:51,913
I wasn't always like this,
you know.

1015
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,683
Oh. What were you like before?

1016
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:56,490
I had a job...

1017
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,152
I had a home...

1018
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,320
I had a family.

1019
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,521
Did you have any kids?

1020
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:02,924
No.

1021
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,259
Oh, I wanted them...

1022
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:08,270
but the man I loved...

1023
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:09,771
fell out of love with me.

1024
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,106
That broke my heart.

1025
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:15,568
And whenever the chance
to be loved came along again...

1026
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,043
I ran away from it.

1027
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:20,943
I stopped trusting people.

1028
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,450
No offense...

1029
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:25,317
but that seems like
sort of a dumb thing to do.

1030
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:27,879
I was afraid of getting
my heart broken again.

1031
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:31,185
You see, sometimes
you can trust a person...

1032
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,695
and then,
when things are down...

1033
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:35,560
they forget about you.

1034
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:38,328
Maybe they're just too busy.

1035
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,697
Maybe they don't
forget about you...

1036
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:42,396
but they forget to remember you.

1037
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:44,234
I don't think people
mean to forget.

1038
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,503
I think it just happens.

1039
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:49,204
My grandfather says
if my head wasn't screwed on...

1040
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,872
I'd leave it on the school bus.

1041
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,904
I'm just afraid
if I do trust someone...

1042
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:55,246
I'll get my heart broken again.

1043
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:56,649
KEVlN: I understand that.

1044
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:59,620
I used to have a really nice
pair of roller blades.

1045
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:02,215
I was afraid I'd wreck them...

1046
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,782
so I kept them in the box.

1047
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,919
-You know what happened?
-No.

1048
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,087
I outgrew them.

1049
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:08,721
I never wore them once
outside...

1050
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,959
just in my room
a couple of times.

1051
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:13,968
A person's heart
and a person's feelings...

1052
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:16,096
are very different than skates.

1053
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:18,268
Well, they're kind
of the same thing.

1054
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,275
If you aren't going
to use your heart...

1055
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,300
then what's the difference
if it gets broken?

1056
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:24,278
If you just keep it
to yourself...

1057
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:26,543
maybe it'll be like
my roller blades--

1058
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:28,550
when you do decide to try it...

1059
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,211
it won't be any good.

1060
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:31,719
You should take a chance.

1061
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:33,278
You got nothing to lose.

1062
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,621
A bit of truth in there
somewhere.

1063
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,126
I think so.

1064
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,855
Your heart
might still be broken...

1065
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,362
but it isn't gone.

1066
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,888
If it was gone,
you wouldn't be this nice.

1067
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:46,298
Thank you.

1068
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:50,099
Do you know that it's been...

1069
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:54,638
a couple of years
since I've talked to anybody?

1070
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:57,077
That's OK.
You're really good at it.

1071
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:58,238
You're not boring.

1072
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,077
You don't mumble or spit
when you talk.

1073
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:02,242
You should do it more often.

1074
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:03,581
You just have to wear
an outfit...

1075
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,211
that doesn't have
pigeon poop on it.

Oh, I have been working
very hard...

1078
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:12,249
at keeping people away,
haven't l?

1079
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:15,024
I always think I'll have
a lot of fun if I'm alone...

1080
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,464
but being alone isn't much fun.

1081
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:20,229
I don't care how much
people bug me sometimes...

1082
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:23,328
I'd rather be with somebody
than by myself.

1083
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,830
So what are you doing
running around the streets...

1084
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:27,341
on Christmas Eve alone?

1085
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:29,344
Did you get into trouble?

1086
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,437
Yeah.

1087
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,004
WOMAN:
You've done something wrong?

1088
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:34,572
A lot of things.

1089
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:40,648
Did you know that a good deed
erases a bad deed?

1090
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,122
It's getting pretty late.

1091
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:44,182
I don't know
if I'll have enough time...

1092
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:46,888
to erase
all the bad deeds I did.

1093
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,726
Well, it's Christmas Eve.

1094
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:50,527
Good deeds
count for extra tonight.

1095
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:53,591
-They do?
-Of course they do.

1096
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:55,899
So you must think
of the most important thing...

1097
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,462
that you can do for others...

1098
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,166
and go and do it.

1099
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,170
Just follow the star
in your own heart.

1100
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,269
OK.

1101
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:07,748
It's getting pretty late.

1102
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:09,273
I better get going.

1103
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:19,757
If I don't see you again,
I hope everything turns out OK.

1104
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,126
Thank you.

1105
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:23,889
Say good-bye to your birds
for me.

1106
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,092
Oh, I will.

1107
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:34,935
Merry Christmas.

1108
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,376
Merry Christmas.

1109
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,870
If you need somebody to trust,
it can be me.

1110
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:42,247
I won't forget to remember you.

1111
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,253
Don't make promises
you can't keep.

CHlLDREN SlNGlNG: Distant stars
at home up in the heavens

01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,738
Are they watching me?

Christmas star

1116

You watch the world so wisely

At my journey's end

1118
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:29,154
Will you be my true friend?

01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:32,997
Starlight, shine bright

01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:37,004
See me through the dark night

01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:40,838
Light my pathway

1122
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:44,368
Guide me home for Christmas

1123

DUNCAN: All the money
in the cash register...

1124
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:50,411
Mr. Duncan is going to donate
to the Children's Hospital.

1125

MARV: At midnight tonight, we're
hitting Duncan's Toy Chest.

1126
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,714
You can mess
with a lot of things...

1127
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:59,727
but you can't mess with kids
on Christmas.

1128

CONClERGE:
We'd like to offer you...

1129
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:23,529
a complimentary suite
while you're here.

1130
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,740
It's a penthouse
with a view of the park.

1131
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:27,901
I think
you'll find it satisfactory.

1132
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:31,470
It was recently vacated by
the Countess of Worcestershire.

01:46:30,884 --> 01:46:32,818
Looks like a kid
broke your window.

1461
01:46:49,736 --> 01:46:52,398
Turtledoves.

1462
01:46:52,472 --> 01:46:53,632
Ohh.

1463
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:02,776
KATE: Oh, excuse me.
I'm looking for my son.

1464
01:47:02,816 --> 01:47:04,113
He's this boy right here.

1465
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:07,848
Excuse me. Please help me.

1466
01:47:07,921 --> 01:47:09,047
This boy right here,
have you seen him?

1467
01:47:09,122 --> 01:47:10,919
This one. Please?

1468
01:47:19,533 --> 01:47:21,000
I'm looking for my son.

1469
01:47:21,034 --> 01:47:23,002
He's been missing
for two days.

1470
01:47:23,036 --> 01:47:24,503
OFFlCER:
Have you filed a report?

1471
01:47:24,538 --> 01:47:26,005
KATE: Yes, of course we have.

1472
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:29,473
Then trust us.

1473
01:47:29,509 --> 01:47:30,669
We'll handle it.

1474
01:47:32,579 --> 01:47:33,739
Oh.

1475
01:47:36,049 --> 01:47:37,209
But I'm his mother.

1476
01:47:38,919 --> 01:47:40,011
I realize that, ma'am...

1477
01:47:40,086 --> 01:47:41,576
but you're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

1478
01:47:42,756 --> 01:47:44,246
Do you have kids?

1479
01:47:45,325 --> 01:47:46,451
Yes, ma'am.

1480
01:47:46,493 --> 01:47:48,461
And what would you do
if one of them was missing?

1481
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:53,558
I'd probably be doing
the same thing you're doing.

1482
01:47:54,568 --> 01:47:55,728
Thank you.

1483
01:47:58,338 --> 01:48:00,465
Look, put yourself
in your kid's shoes.

1484
01:48:00,507 --> 01:48:02,873
Where would you go?
What would you do?

1485
01:48:02,909 --> 01:48:06,003
Me? I'd probably be lying dead
in a gutter somewhere.

1486
01:48:07,514 --> 01:48:08,947
Oh, but not Kevin.

1487
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:12,748
No. Kevin is so much stronger
and braver than I am.

1488
01:48:14,154 --> 01:48:16,486
I know Kevin's fine.
I'm sure he is.

1489
01:48:16,523 --> 01:48:18,320
Fine.

1490
01:48:18,358 --> 01:48:20,519
But he's still all by himself
in a big city...

1491
01:48:21,895 --> 01:48:23,726
and he doesn't deserve that.

1492
01:48:23,763 --> 01:48:26,391
He deserves to be at home
with his own family...

1493
01:48:26,433 --> 01:48:28,094
around his Christmas tree.

1494
01:48:31,771 --> 01:48:33,102
Oh, dear God.

1495
01:48:34,374 --> 01:48:35,602
I know where he is.

1496
01:48:36,576 --> 01:48:38,100
I need to get
to Rockefeller Center.

1497
01:48:39,045 --> 01:48:40,171
Hop in.

1498
01:48:40,213 --> 01:48:41,737
Thank you.

1499
01:48:45,986 --> 01:48:48,045
KEVlN: I know I don't deserve
a Christmas...

1500
01:48:48,121 --> 01:48:50,089
even if I did do a good deed.

1501
01:48:51,124 --> 01:48:52,682
I don't want any presents.

1502
01:48:52,759 --> 01:48:54,488
Instead, I want to take back...

1503
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:57,190
every mean thing
I ever said to my family....

1504
01:48:57,230 --> 01:48:59,460
even if they don't take back
the things they said.

1505
01:48:59,499 --> 01:49:01,899
I don't care.
I'll love all of them...

1506
01:49:02,903 --> 01:49:04,530
including Buzz.

1507
01:49:04,571 --> 01:49:08,337
If I can only see one,
can I see my mother?

1508
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:11,902
I'll never want another thing
as long as I live.

1509
01:49:11,945 --> 01:49:13,412
I just want my mother.

1510
01:49:13,446 --> 01:49:15,346
I know I won't see her
tonight...

1511
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:17,907
but promise me
I can see her again...

1512
01:49:17,951 --> 01:49:19,942
sometime, anytime.

1513
01:49:19,986 --> 01:49:23,922
Even if it's just once and only
for a couple of minutes.

1514
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:26,288
I just need to tell her
I'm sorry.

1515
01:49:34,367 --> 01:49:35,527
Kevin?

1516
01:49:42,342 --> 01:49:43,502
Mom?

1517
01:49:46,212 --> 01:49:47,907
Wow. That worked fast.

1518
01:49:58,558 --> 01:49:59,855
KATE: Oh, Kevin.

1519
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:03,628
Mom, I'm sorry.

1520
01:50:05,165 --> 01:50:06,655
I'm sorry, too.

1521
01:50:19,546 --> 01:50:21,207
KEVlN: Merry Christmas, Mom.

1522
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:25,677
KATE:
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1523
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:28,085
Thank you.

1524
01:50:29,155 --> 01:50:30,383
Let's go.

1525
01:50:31,391 --> 01:50:32,858
KEVlN:
How'd you know I was here?

1526
01:50:32,926 --> 01:50:34,154
KATE: I know you
and Christmas trees...

1527
01:50:34,194 --> 01:50:35,786
and this is the biggest around.

1528
01:50:35,829 --> 01:50:37,023
KEVlN: Where's everybody else?

1529
01:50:37,063 --> 01:50:38,189
KATE: They're at the hotel.

1530
01:50:38,231 --> 01:50:39,892
They didn't like
the palm trees, either.

1531
01:51:02,455 --> 01:51:03,888
[Snoring]

1532
01:51:24,044 --> 01:51:26,774
Holy smokes! It's morning!

1533
01:51:28,148 --> 01:51:29,945
It's Christmas morning, man.

1534
01:51:31,384 --> 01:51:33,682
Fuller, don't get your hopes up.

1535
01:51:33,753 --> 01:51:35,243
FULLER: Huh?

1536
01:51:35,321 --> 01:51:37,255
I don't think
Santa Claus visits hotels.

1537
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:39,758
Are you nuts? He's omnipresent.

1538
01:51:39,826 --> 01:51:41,521
He goes everywhere.

1539
01:51:43,163 --> 01:51:45,063
Hey, guys, wake up!
It's Christmas!

1540
01:51:49,736 --> 01:51:50,862
Mom, Dad, it's Christmas!

1541
01:51:50,904 --> 01:51:52,064
FRANK: What?!

1542
01:51:55,675 --> 01:51:56,937
GlRL: What on earth?

1543
01:51:56,976 --> 01:51:58,466
JEFF: Come on. I wanna find out.

1544
01:52:03,983 --> 01:52:05,644
ROD: Oh, wow.

1545
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:07,687
JEFF:
Where did it all come from?

1546
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:09,780
KEVlN:
Mom! Dad! You got to see this!

1547
01:52:14,394 --> 01:52:16,294
-Gosh.
-Peter!

1548
01:52:16,329 --> 01:52:17,694
BUZZ: Are you sure
we're in the right room?

1549
01:52:19,032 --> 01:52:21,227
-Look at all this stuff!
-Yeah!

1550
01:52:21,267 --> 01:52:23,360
-Oh, wow!
-Look!

1551
01:52:24,037 --> 01:52:25,698
FRANK: Don't open any of mine.
I mean it.

1552
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:27,206
Who's Mr. Duncan?

1553
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:29,299
KATE: Duncan? I don't know.

1554
01:52:29,342 --> 01:52:30,639
All right.
Everyone just calm down.

1555
01:52:30,677 --> 01:52:33,373
Calm down. Hey, hey!

1556
01:52:33,413 --> 01:52:35,438
All right. Now...

1557
01:52:35,482 --> 01:52:40,215
if Kevin hadn't screwed up
in the first place again...

1558
01:52:40,286 --> 01:52:43,847
then we wouldn't be in this most
perfect and huge hotel room...

1559
01:52:43,923 --> 01:52:45,857
with a truckload
of all this free stuff...

1560
01:52:45,892 --> 01:52:47,519
so...

1561
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:48,686
I think it only fair...

1562
01:52:48,728 --> 01:52:51,356
that Kevin get to open up
the first present.

1563
01:52:51,998 --> 01:52:53,124
Then I'll go...

1564
01:52:53,166 --> 01:52:54,793
and the rest of you, and so on.

1565
01:52:59,272 --> 01:53:01,900
Merry Christmas, Kev.

1566
01:53:01,941 --> 01:53:03,704
Merry Christmas, Buzz.

1567
01:53:06,379 --> 01:53:07,505
PETER: Merry Christmas, Kevin.

1568
01:53:07,547 --> 01:53:09,242
FRANK: OK, Kevin!

1569
01:53:09,282 --> 01:53:11,512
All right! Merry Christmas!

1570
01:53:13,586 --> 01:53:15,611
Enough of this gooey sh--

1571
01:53:15,688 --> 01:53:17,349
show...of emotion.

1572
01:53:17,423 --> 01:53:18,515
Everyone, let's dig in!

1573
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:21,754
-All right!
-Everybody, wait.

1574
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:23,353
LESLlE: Save the paper.
We can use it next year.

1575
01:53:23,396 --> 01:53:25,455
Give me the bows.

1576
01:54:01,034 --> 01:54:02,661
Merry Christmas.

1577
01:54:05,138 --> 01:54:06,571
Kevin!

1578
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:08,266
Merry Christmas!

1579
01:54:09,275 --> 01:54:10,435
I got something for you.

1580
01:54:18,818 --> 01:54:19,910
What's this?

1581
01:54:19,986 --> 01:54:21,453
It's a turtledove.

1582
01:54:21,487 --> 01:54:23,421
I have one, you have one.

1583
01:54:23,456 --> 01:54:25,356
As long as we each
have a turtledove...

1584
01:54:25,391 --> 01:54:26,915
we'll be friends forever.

1585
01:54:30,964 --> 01:54:33,228
Oh, Kevin.

1586
01:54:36,236 --> 01:54:38,397
Thank you.

1587
01:54:39,639 --> 01:54:41,903
I won't forget you. Trust me.

1588
01:54:50,650 --> 01:54:51,810
WOMAN: Oh.

1589
01:55:10,169 --> 01:55:12,399
Mr. McCallister's
room service bill, sir.

1590
01:55:14,507 --> 01:55:15,701
Merry Christmas, sir.

1591
01:55:17,076 --> 01:55:18,236
Uh, oh.

1592
01:55:22,282 --> 01:55:23,977
Nice family.

1593
01:55:24,017 --> 01:55:25,507
Really.

1594
01:55:34,394 --> 01:55:36,328
BUZZ: Merry Christmas, indeed.

1595
01:55:37,397 --> 01:55:39,695
Oh, Dad...

1596
01:55:39,732 --> 01:55:44,567
PETER: Kevin!
You spent $967 on room service?!

1597
01:55:59,585 --> 01:56:00,882
CHOlR SlNGlNG: Merry Christmas

1598
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:02,217
Merry Christmas

1599
01:56:02,255 --> 01:56:04,849
Sing a song
for the glorious season

1600
01:56:04,891 --> 01:56:06,381
Merry Christmas

1601
01:56:06,426 --> 01:56:07,893
Merry Christmas

1602
01:56:07,927 --> 01:56:10,521
Sing a song for a happy new year

1603
01:56:10,596 --> 01:56:13,497
Sing verily merrily
loud and strong

1604
01:56:13,533 --> 01:56:15,865
Welcome the wintry season

1605
01:56:15,902 --> 01:56:19,099
Just follow along
with a holiday song

1606
01:56:19,138 --> 01:56:21,606
Santa is here again, yes

1607
01:56:21,641 --> 01:56:22,972
Merry Christmas

1608
01:56:23,009 --> 01:56:24,169
Merry Christmas

1609
01:56:24,277 --> 01:56:27,178
Sing a song
for the glorious season

1610
01:56:27,213 --> 01:56:28,441
Merry Christmas

1611
01:56:28,481 --> 01:56:29,880
Merry Christmas

1612
01:56:29,916 --> 01:56:32,680
Sing a song for a happy new year

1613
01:56:32,719 --> 01:56:35,654
Now, reindeer's fine
if you need any proof

1614
01:56:35,688 --> 01:56:38,054
Simply a matter of reason

1615
01:56:38,091 --> 01:56:41,083
Just listen, you'll hear
when they land on the roof

1616
01:56:41,127 --> 01:56:43,527
Santa is here again, yes

1617
01:56:43,596 --> 01:56:44,858
Merry Christmas

1618
01:56:44,931 --> 01:56:46,489
Merry Christmas

1619
01:56:46,566 --> 01:56:49,000
Sing a song
for the glorious season

1620
01:56:49,035 --> 01:56:50,400
