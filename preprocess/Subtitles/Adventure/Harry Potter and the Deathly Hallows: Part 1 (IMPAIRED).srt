the ball of light...

straight through me. Right here.

the three brothers on their magic...

having been clever enough to evade him.

more powerful than any in existence.

<i>So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.

1194
01:51:40,792 --> 01:51:45,092
<i>The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...

01:51:45,263 --> 01:51:49,700
<i>...and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from the grave.

Death turned to the third brother.

handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.

to a distant village...

<i>...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...

with whom he had once quarreled.

that the Elder Wand had given him...

another wizard stole the wand...

<i>...and slit the brother's throat
for good measure.

<i>And so Death took the first brother
for his own.

02:11:35,853 --> 02:11:38,253
We should close his eyes.

1440

Don't you think?

There.

1442
02:11:47,498 --> 02:11:49,932
Now he could be sleeping.
