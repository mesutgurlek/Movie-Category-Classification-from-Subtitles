That's not the issue, Delmar.

324

square with the Lord...

joined us, Everett.

Name's Everett.

away from Pete's mouth.

346

to eat for 13 years...

out here for miles.

no laughin' matter, Everett.

What'd the devil give you
for your soul, Tommy?

361
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,335
Well, he taught me to play
this here guitar real good.

362
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,711
Oh, son...

363
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,256

your everlasting soul?

364

Well, I wasn't usin' it.

365

and demons, Pete...

368
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,476
but the great Satan hisself...

369
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,770
is red and scaly
with a bifurcated tail...

370

a hay fork.

He's white.
As white as you folks.

With empty eyes
and a big, hollow voice.

Well, no, sir.
Why, that was my idea.

to sing into his can.
