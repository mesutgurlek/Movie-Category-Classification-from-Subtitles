you're not telling me, Aunt May.

1270
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,584
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

1271
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:48,977
I know you're not telling me something.
You lie to me. I know you love me.

1272
01:16:48,978 --> 01:16:51,063
- I don't lie.
- I know you love me, but you do.

1273
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:52,841
Aunt May, Aunt May.

1274

You have to tell me, May.

1275
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:57,694
That's my father.

1276
01:16:57,695 --> 01:16:59,363
Yes, he was your father.

1277
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:02,392
But that didn't seem to
stop him from leaving you...

1278
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,272
here.

1279
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:07,405
I need the truth.

1280
01:17:09,457 --> 01:17:12,042
The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.

1281
01:17:12,043 --> 01:17:14,044
You were this little boy
whose whole world

1282
01:17:14,045 --> 01:17:17,005
was turned upside down
with no explanation.

1283
01:17:17,006 --> 01:17:22,162
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.

1284
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,848
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,
and protect you and worry about you?

1285
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:27,432
Your father?

1286
01:17:27,433 --> 01:17:28,767
No.

1287
01:17:28,768 --> 01:17:33,147
I was the one who wiped your nose,
and made you brush your teeth,

1288
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:36,191
and do your homework,
or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

1289
01:17:36,192 --> 01:17:41,029
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet,

1290
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,906
who has to take nursing classes

1291
01:17:42,907 --> 01:17:46,034
with 22-year-old kids so I can
pay for you to go to college.

1292
01:17:46,035 --> 01:17:48,370
And I don't know how
to do this without Ben.

1293
01:17:48,371 --> 01:17:49,897
I don't know how. And...

1294
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:53,709
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father,

1295
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,784
who was never here. No.

1296
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,381
No, I won't tell you.

1297
01:17:59,382 --> 01:18:00,716
You're my boy.

1298
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:03,302
As far as I'm concerned,
you're my boy.

Norman Osborn was very valuable,</i>

would pay a lot for it.</i>

<i>They said he was a traitor.</i>

I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1324
01:19:32,308 --> 01:19:35,519
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us,

He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.

1334

He wore the same ratty
lab coat for 20 years.

1335

He took the D train to
work at 7 every morning.
