1
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,083
Hey, this area's restricted.

2
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:49,845
Oh, hi. Yeah, I know.
They called me down here.

3
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:51,684
Some of this wiring got screwed up.

4
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:53,205
Nobody called it down to me.

5
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:55,044
I'm going to have to see a work order.

6
00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:56,929
Yeah. Just a second.

7
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:02,083
There you are.

8
00:04:03,732 --> 00:04:05,962
Nothing personal.

9
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:12,408
I guess that wraps it up.
Good work, everybody.

10
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:17,126
Marty, I couldn't be happier
with the way this worked out.

11
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:21,040
Congratulations.

12
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:25,211
(elevator bell dings)

13
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:26,327
Hold that.

14
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:27,401
Whoa!

15
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:28,845
Ahem!

16
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:30,445
Gee, thanks.

17
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:40,409
Thanks for pushing that, Bob.

18
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:43,723
The light's on, but you never know,
it really might be broken.

19
00:04:43,812 --> 00:04:45,165
Shut up.

20
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,487
Remember, honey...

21
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:04,241
(beep beep)

22
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:37,401
Ooh!

23
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:40,001
Jesus.

24
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:42,481
Bob, what button did you push?

25
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:51,242
(sirens)

26
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:17,841
(police radio) All responding
"David Team" units respond to lot 11.

27
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:28,842
Mr Bagwell,
make sure these other elevators...

28
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:30,490
..remain locked down and empty.

29
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:31,129
Yes, sir.

30
00:06:31,212 --> 00:06:33,726
There's no other way... no doors...
no other way in or out...

31
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:35,131
..except through access panels,
is that correct?

32
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:35,849
Yes, sir.

33
00:06:35,932 --> 00:06:39,368
Gentlemen, what we have here
are 13 passengers in an express elevator...

34
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:40,726
..below floor 30.

35
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:43,564
The bomb's already taken out cables.

36
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:46,086
The bomber wants $3 million
or he blows the emergency brakes.

37
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,571
What's our clock?

38
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:49,051
He gave one hour.

39
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:52,204
That leaves us 23 minutes exactly.

40
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,601
Anything else
that'll keep this elevator from falling?

41
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:55,568
The basement.

42
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:57,404
The city would like to avoid that event,
Officer Traven.

43
00:06:57,492 --> 00:06:59,050
We can't just unload the passengers?

44
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:00,804
This is an express elevator.

45
00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:02,564
The only way in or out
is through access panels.

46
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:04,768
The bomber's also wired
the hatch to trigger the bomb,...

47
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:07,889
...which seats him
in the 'crazy but not stupid' section.

48
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:10,964
Sir, Harry volunteers to examine the device.

49
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:12,201
Yeah, right.

50
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:13,486
Fine.

51
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:15,210
The two of you check it out.

52
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:17,965
The nearest access panel's
on the 32nd floor in the lobby.

53
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:20,168
I want reports only.
We're in a holding pattern.

54
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:22,083
Worthy, Briggs,
I want you to secure the base area.

55
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:22,843
No-one in or out.

56
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:25,685
Everyone else,
I want you to affirm building evac. Move!

57
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:27,648
Looks like we're walking.

58
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:30,523
Hurry, folks, but watch your step!

59
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:31,647
29.

60
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:34,804
All the way down to the lobby!
Let's go, folks!

61
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:36,769
30.

62
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:39,924
31.

63
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:43,407
32.

64
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:04,167
(drilling)

65
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,727
Hello!

66
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:08,724
Come on, man. Get us out of here!

67
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:10,321
Hello!

68
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:14,244
Please, help us!

69
00:08:15,332 --> 00:08:16,731
Come on, man!

70
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:21,411
(drilling)

71
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:29,445
(drilling)

72
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:43,166
Help!

73
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:46,210
Please, get us out of here!

74
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,407
Please!

75
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:10,845
Please!

76
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:12,809
Get us out of here!

77
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,805
Who's up there?

78
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:17,481
Who's up there?

79
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:19,201
What's going on?

80
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,886
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the LAPD.

81
00:09:21,972 --> 00:09:24,281
- Thank God.
- What are you doing up there?

82
00:09:24,372 --> 00:09:28,570
(Traven) There's been
an elevator malfunction, so just relax.

83
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:32,446
Hey, come on!
What are you guys waiting for?

84
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:34,807
We'll have you out of there
as soon as possible.

85
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:36,727
Am I lying?

86
00:09:37,892 --> 00:09:39,371
How come they sent cops here?

87
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:41,488
Shouldn't they send repair guys?

88
00:09:41,572 --> 00:09:43,164
- Yeah.
- Makes no sense.

89
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:51,361
What do you think?

90
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:55,003
You're the expert. I just work here.

91
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:56,764
Looks pretty solid.

92
00:09:56,852 --> 00:09:58,604
Anyone we know?

93
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:01,411
I don't recognise the work, but he's a pro.

94
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:03,722
He's cutting it close.

95
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,131
I don't like it.

96
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:06,691
Well, what's to like?

97
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,569
Mac said we hold, so we hold.

98
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:19,801
All right. Pop quiz.

99
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:21,245
The airport. Gunman with one hostage.

100
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:24,130
He's using her for cover.
He's almost to a plane.

101
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:26,680
You're 100 feet away.

102
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:33,488
Jack.

103
00:10:35,372 --> 00:10:36,885
Shoot the hostage.

104
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:38,722
What?

105
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:40,370
Take her out of the equation.

106
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:42,682
Go for the good wound.
He can't get to the plane with her.

107
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:44,642
Clear shot.

108
00:10:44,732 --> 00:10:46,643
You're deeply nuts. You know that?

109
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:49,565
"Shoot the hostage." (laughs)

110
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:53,761
Harry, this is wrong.

111
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:56,161
He's going to blow it anyway.

112
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:57,321
Why?

113
00:10:57,412 --> 00:10:59,880
I don't know. Gut feeling.

114
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:03,044
Right now, Mac outranks your gut, so we sit.

115
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:05,521
This is taking way too long.

116
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:09,611
How much you think that elevator weights?

117
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:11,284
Jack, come on.

118
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:15,884
Maybe we can do something
about those hostages.

119
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:19,401
We're not going to shoot them, right?

120
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:22,721
Hey, where you going?

121
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,211
What's going on?

122
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:27,009
Don't go!

123
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:28,605
Don't leave us here!

124
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:45,129
No, we just take them out of the equation.

125
00:12:17,332 --> 00:12:18,651
Are you sure it'll hold?

126
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,085
It'll hold.

127
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:23,006
Six minutes.

128
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:26,049
I can't get any more time.

129
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:27,451
He's not talking!

130
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:29,682
I need the goddamn money now.

131
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:42,285
Tell me again, Harry. Why did I take this job?

132
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:43,771
Aw, come on. 30 more years of this,...

133
00:12:43,852 --> 00:12:46,685
..you get a tiny pension
and a cheap gold watch.

134
00:12:46,772 --> 00:12:47,682
Cool.

135
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:49,042
Ho.

136
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:21,407
God, it's hot in here.

137
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:22,607
There's no air.

138
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:24,410
Can't they just pry the doors open?

139
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:25,527
I can't breathe.

140
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:32,921
Don't fuck with daddy.

141
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:40,166
(screaming)

142
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:03,970
Grab her hand! Grab her hand!

143
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:07,681
Usually they fall down now.

144
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:08,887
Oh, my God!

145
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:14,485
Get her out of there!

146
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:19,011
He's early! Son of a bitch is early!

147
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:39,762
Mac, we need more help up here now!

148
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:41,561
Oh, please!

149
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:43,809
I don't want to die!

150
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:45,325
Please save us!

151
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,331
Open the door!

152
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:55,528
Open the doors!

153
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:56,442
Help!

154
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:58,491
Please help me!

155
00:14:58,572 --> 00:14:59,766
Get me out!

156
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:01,001
We'll get you out!

157
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:03,083
Come on. Give me your hands!

158
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:05,891
It's OK, give me your hands.

159
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:15,291
Watch your head.

160
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:16,885
OK, I've got you.

161
00:15:17,412 --> 00:15:18,162
Take it easy.

162
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,890
- Oh, thank you.
- You're fine.

163
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,890
- You're fine.
- Thank you.

164
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:23,690
Take her. Let's go. Who's next?

165
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:27,807
Thank you.

166
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:29,842
We've got you, ma'am.

167
00:15:36,532 --> 00:15:38,329
What the hell is all this?

168
00:15:38,412 --> 00:15:39,970
Help us! Hurry!

169
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:44,841
Hurry, hurry! Let's go! Go! Go!

170
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:45,887
Let's go!

171
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:47,644
Come on. Come on.

172
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:54,892
Oh, my God!

173
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:56,041
Help me out!

174
00:15:56,132 --> 00:15:57,201
Please, help me out.

175
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:00,241
Come on, lady! Come on!

176
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:01,651
No. No.

177
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:03,051
Come on, lady! Come on!

178
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:04,485
Grab my hand!

179
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:09,641
Come on!

180
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:10,642
Let's go! It's going to fall!

181
00:16:10,732 --> 00:16:11,881
No! I can't!

182
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:16,170
Just take one step, reach out,
and take my hand.

183
00:16:16,252 --> 00:16:17,207
Come on!

184
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:19,521
Come on!

185
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:23,051
Oh! Oh, God!

186
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:25,168
Don't let go of me.

187
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:26,287
You're OK.

188
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:39,047
(crash)

189
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:42,571
My... my shoe!

190
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:44,324
Let's go! Let's go!

191
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:46,885
Was it good for you?

192
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:50,089
It was great for me.
How was it for you, honey?

193
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:51,605
Elevator dropped.

194
00:16:51,692 --> 00:16:54,286
Oh, good. That's good to know.

195
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:56,481
(sigh)

196
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:00,371
Is your watch slow?

197
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,603
Uh-uh. He jumped the gun.
We had three minutes left.

198
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:05,648
Why does he do that?

199
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:07,563
He's losing his $3 million.

200
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,450
I don't know. Maybe he couldn't
hold his wad long enough.

201
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:13,365
It's a common problem
among middle-aged men.

202
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:14,851
So I'm told.

203
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:20,925
He's here.

204
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:22,491
He could've blown that thing from Pacoima.

205
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:26,765
No. He knew we were up to something.

206
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:28,205
He's close by.

207
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,806
He's not going to corner
himself in a building...

208
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:33,725
...we evacuated anyway. Come on.

209
00:17:39,252 --> 00:17:42,403
He'd want to be here,
but he'd want to stay mobile.

210
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:43,641
Right?

211
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,651
The elevators.

212
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:51,690
Passenger cars were stopped.
They checked them out.

213
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:53,683
What about the freight elevators?

214
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:15,931
(coughing)

215
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,810
Will the mystery guest please sign in?

216
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:20,563
What?

217
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:23,962
Jack!

218
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:26,207
Damn it.

219
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,245
(gunshot)

220
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,809
Get to the side!

221
00:19:17,652 --> 00:19:19,244
(moaning)

222
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:25,646
Shit! Shit! Shit!

223
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:29,682
Up! Get your ass up!

224
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:31,649
(groaning)

225
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:14,083
I don't suppose anybody
will give me 3 million...

226
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,003
..just for you.

227
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:16,804
(click)

228
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:22,530
Hold it!

229
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:25,531
Pop quiz, hotshot.

230
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:28,611
Terrorist holding a police hostage.

231
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,489
Got enough dynamite
strapped to his chest...

232
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:32,608
..to blow a building in half.
Now, what do you do?

233
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:36,401
There's gonna be 50 cops
waiting for you in the basement.

234
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:38,847
Standard flanking deployment, right?

235
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:41,571
Maybe we'll get off on the third floor, huh?

236
00:20:44,092 --> 00:20:46,367
At least that's what they'll think.

237
00:20:46,452 --> 00:20:48,522
I want a location on those goddamn shots!

238
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:50,568
Briggs! Where's Jack and Harry?

239
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:52,210
Lieutenant, we've got movement...

240
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,361
..on the freight elevator.

241
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:01,884
It's on three. Let's move!

242
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:03,405
(elevator bell dings)

243
00:21:03,732 --> 00:21:05,643
End of the line.

244
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:09,725
This day has been real disappointing,
I don't mind saying.

245
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:11,165
Why?
Because you didn't get to kill everyone?

246
00:21:11,252 --> 00:21:14,767
There'll come a time, boy,
when you'll wish you never met me.

247
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:17,082
Mister, I'm already there.

248
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:18,730
You can see I'm in charge here.

249
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:19,642
I drop this stick...

250
00:21:19,732 --> 00:21:23,202
...and they pick your friend up
with a sponge.

251
00:21:23,852 --> 00:21:25,444
Are you ready to die, friend?

252
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:26,248
Fuck you.

253
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:28,926
In 200 years, we've come from...

254
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:32,163
..."I regret but I have one life to give
for my country"...

255
00:21:32,252 --> 00:21:33,367
...to "fuck you"?

256
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:35,204
Go ahead. Drop the stick. Do it.

257
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:36,247
Shut up, Harry.

258
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:39,369
We've got all the balls
in the world here, man.

259
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:41,522
Give it up. You got nowhere to go!

260
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:44,090
Shoot the hostage.

261
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:48,320
Say goodbye, Harry.

262
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:50,004
(groans)

263
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:54,731
You fuck!

264
00:21:57,252 --> 00:21:58,241
Freeze!

265
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,371
Freeze!

266
00:22:01,452 --> 00:22:04,285
Give it up! You're out of options!

267
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,246
(applause)

268
00:22:26,652 --> 00:22:28,563
Through dedication and bravery,...

269
00:22:28,652 --> 00:22:31,371
..these next two officers
effected the rescue...

270
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:33,329
..of 13 citizens of this city.

271
00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:35,403
And thanks to them,..

272
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:38,211
..the only life taken
by the terrorist's bomb, was his own.

273
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:41,011
You shot me. I can't believe it.

274
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:44,164
They're giving you a medal
for shooting me, you little prick.

275
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:47,085
Harry, you told me to.

276
00:22:47,172 --> 00:22:48,730
The highest honour bestowed...

277
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:52,122
..upon a member
of the Los Angeles Police Department.

278
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:53,850
Officer Harry Temple.

279
00:23:02,412 --> 00:23:03,367
Congratulations.

280
00:23:03,452 --> 00:23:04,567
Thank you.

281
00:23:07,972 --> 00:23:09,803
Officer Jack Traven.

282
00:23:18,692 --> 00:23:20,125
(applause)

283
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:24,366
(clapping)

284
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:29,046
Way to go, Jack. Way to go.

285
00:23:29,132 --> 00:23:30,360
Here we go.

286
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:32,010
There you are, my man.

287
00:23:32,092 --> 00:23:33,411
Beautiful. A toast to me.

288
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:36,006
Make me feel good about myself.

289
00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:38,003
Hey, Sandy! Here we go!

290
00:23:38,092 --> 00:23:40,925
OK, so how we do... oh! Whoa, whoa.

291
00:23:41,012 --> 00:23:42,047
Shit.

292
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:43,884
I need a bib!

293
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,770
Here we go. All right!

294
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:48,205
Can't take me anywhere.

295
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:49,566
Thank you. That's mine.

296
00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:52,041
And here is to Harry...

297
00:23:52,132 --> 00:23:53,485
...for his quick thinking,...

298
00:23:53,572 --> 00:23:55,051
(laughter)

299
00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:57,043
..for his grace under pressure...

300
00:23:57,132 --> 00:24:00,090
..and for his brave and selfless act.

301
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,287
Hear! Hear!

302
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:02,646
Hear! Hear!

303
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:06,330
And to Jack, for shooting Harry.

304
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,481
Oh, no!

305
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:09,449
Something we've all wanted to do...

306
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,124
...for a very long time.

307
00:24:11,212 --> 00:24:12,327
Hey, hey!

308
00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:15,801
OK, no, no. Here it is.

309
00:24:15,892 --> 00:24:18,611
Here's to you guys for doing your job...

310
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:20,205
...and for not getting dead.

311
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,441
Mazel tov.

312
00:24:21,852 --> 00:24:22,967
Mazel tov.

313
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:31,890
I can't do that.

314
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:34,327
We're the two luckiest guys in the world,
you know that?

315
00:24:34,412 --> 00:24:37,210
We got the bad guy
and we didn't lose any civilians.

316
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:38,122
We're good.

317
00:24:38,212 --> 00:24:39,611
No! You were lucky.

318
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:41,045
No, we were lucky.

319
00:24:41,132 --> 00:24:42,531
You better understand it.

320
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:45,604
We were dealing with a total psycho.

321
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,525
This guy could've blown us up at any time.

322
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,681
Phew!

323
00:24:49,772 --> 00:24:52,047
And I got a bullet in me.

324
00:24:52,132 --> 00:24:55,363
6 inches off the mark,
and they're giving the medal...

325
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,441
...to my wife.

326
00:24:56,532 --> 00:24:57,806
Harry, come on, man.

327
00:24:57,892 --> 00:24:59,883
I mean, we won. We got him.

328
00:24:59,972 --> 00:25:01,405
Do you listen?

329
00:25:01,492 --> 00:25:04,643
Do you ever...
Because I am not going to be around...

330
00:25:04,732 --> 00:25:08,247
...to back you up,
so you better start thinking.

331
00:25:08,492 --> 00:25:10,130
Guts'll get you so far...

332
00:25:10,212 --> 00:25:12,965
...and then they'll get you killed.

333
00:25:15,772 --> 00:25:17,967
Luck runs out sooner or later.

334
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,201
Right, Chief?

335
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:20,407
That's right.

336
00:25:21,972 --> 00:25:23,087
Ho!

337
00:25:23,172 --> 00:25:25,447
I'm all right. I'm all right.

338
00:25:25,532 --> 00:25:28,285
I'm going to go home, have some sex.

339
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:31,011
Harry, you're going to go home...

340
00:25:31,092 --> 00:25:32,002
...and puke.

341
00:25:32,092 --> 00:25:34,401
Yeah, well, that'll be fun, too.

342
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,562
Come on, you gimp.

343
00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:00,486
Hey, Jack, saw you on TV.

344
00:26:00,572 --> 00:26:01,766
Congratulations.

345
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:02,523
Thanks, Bob.

346
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:03,840
Yeah. You looked fat.

347
00:26:03,932 --> 00:26:05,126
Take it easy on him, Bob.

348
00:26:05,212 --> 00:26:07,282
The boy was up late last night partying.

349
00:26:07,372 --> 00:26:08,441
Wild party?

350
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:09,885
I don't remember that well.

351
00:26:09,972 --> 00:26:12,805
Couldn't have been too great.
Woke up alone.

352
00:26:12,892 --> 00:26:14,689
Yeah? The last time I partied like that,...

353
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:17,161
...I woke up married. Huh, Vinnie?

354
00:26:17,972 --> 00:26:20,088
Hey, Jack, you forgot your muffins.

355
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:20,968
Have a good one, Bob!

356
00:26:21,052 --> 00:26:23,008
Thanks, Jack! Take care, huh?

357
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:24,161
Thanks.

358
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:37,484
See you tomorrow!

359
00:27:18,532 --> 00:27:20,170
(phone)

360
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:26,567
(ringing)

361
00:27:40,412 --> 00:27:43,085
(still ringing)

362
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:54,009
What do you think, Jack?

363
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:57,528
You think if you pick up
all the bus driver's teeth,...

364
00:27:57,612 --> 00:27:58,840
...they'll give you another medal?

365
00:27:58,932 --> 00:27:59,887
Jesus!

366
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:02,850
You think I wouldn't have been prepared?

367
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,685
Two years I spent
setting up that elevator job.

368
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:08,002
Two years I invested myself in it.

369
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:11,323
You couldn't understand
the kind of commitment that I have.

370
00:28:11,412 --> 00:28:14,131
You ruined a man's life's work
and you think...

371
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:15,247
...you can walk away?

372
00:28:15,332 --> 00:28:17,641
You got blinders on to the world,...

373
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:20,041
...but I got your attention now, didn't I, Jack?

374
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,009
Why didn't you just come after me?

375
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:23,047
This is about me!

376
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:24,690
About my money!

377
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:28,560
This is about money due me,
which I will collect.

378
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:30,722
$3.7 million.

379
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:32,211
It's mynest egg, Jack.

380
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:35,045
At my age, you've got to think ahead.

381
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:36,565
When I find you...

382
00:28:36,652 --> 00:28:38,051
Pop quiz, hotshot.

383
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:40,441
There's a bomb on a bus.

384
00:28:40,532 --> 00:28:44,764
Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour,
the bomb is armed.

385
00:28:44,852 --> 00:28:48,640
If it drops below 50, it blows up.

386
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:50,327
What do you do?

387
00:28:51,252 --> 00:28:52,082
What do you do?

388
00:28:52,172 --> 00:28:54,481
I'd want to know what bus it was.

389
00:28:54,572 --> 00:28:56,961
You think I'm going to tell you that?

390
00:28:57,852 --> 00:28:58,523
Yes.

391
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,011
Very good.

392
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:03,323
There are rules, Jack,
and I want you to get this right.

393
00:29:03,412 --> 00:29:05,243
No-one goes off the bus.

394
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:09,564
You try to take any passengers off the bus,
I will detonate it.

395
00:29:09,652 --> 00:29:10,846
I want my money...

396
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:11,921
..by 11 am.

397
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:16,010
We can't pull that kind of money in time.

398
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:17,366
Focus, Jack!

399
00:29:17,452 --> 00:29:19,249
Your concern is the bus.

400
00:29:19,332 --> 00:29:21,243
And don't try to call.

401
00:29:21,332 --> 00:29:22,651
The radio's down.

402
00:29:22,732 --> 00:29:26,407
Now, the number of the bus is 2525.

403
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:28,562
It's running downtown from Venice.

404
00:29:28,652 --> 00:29:30,290
It is at the corner of...

405
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:31,168
..Ocean Park...

406
00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:32,801
..and Main.

407
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:47,126
Sam!

408
00:29:48,132 --> 00:29:49,201
Sam!

409
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:50,930
Annie.

410
00:29:51,012 --> 00:29:51,842
Sam!

411
00:29:51,932 --> 00:29:52,808
Tell him to stop!

412
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,405
Shit. Excuse me. Coming through!

413
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:55,803
Sam!

414
00:29:57,292 --> 00:29:58,281
Wait!

415
00:29:58,372 --> 00:29:59,441
Sam!

416
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:01,204
This ain't no bus stop.

417
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:03,089
Get rid of your butt.

418
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:05,049
OK, it's gone. It's gone.

419
00:30:05,132 --> 00:30:06,963
You are a good, kind man.

420
00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:10,408
One day, people will write songs about you.

421
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:19,367
Hi.

422
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:20,282
Hi.

423
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:30,449
First time in LA.

424
00:30:31,452 --> 00:30:33,249
Oh, no. I live here.

425
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,847
No, I mean mine.
Oh, that's just funny.

426
00:30:36,932 --> 00:30:41,847
You heard me wrong. I'm sightseeing.
I hate to use the word tourist,...

427
00:30:41,932 --> 00:30:44,002
...but it's not like I can hide it.

428
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,002
Not really.

429
00:30:48,052 --> 00:30:50,850
Aw, jeez.
You know, it took me three hours...

430
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,241
...just to get here from the airport.

431
00:30:53,332 --> 00:30:54,685
I got so lost.

432
00:30:54,772 --> 00:30:56,603
LA is one large place.

433
00:30:56,692 --> 00:30:58,967
Course, you live here.
You probably don't notice.

434
00:30:59,052 --> 00:31:01,850
I'm such a yokel. There. I said it.

435
00:31:01,932 --> 00:31:05,242
You know what? I got gum on my seat.

436
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:06,447
Gum.

437
00:31:08,372 --> 00:31:09,566
Excuse me.

438
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:12,321
Good morning.

439
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:13,450
Hi.

440
00:31:13,532 --> 00:31:15,363
(horn)

441
00:31:38,852 --> 00:31:40,490
(honking)

442
00:31:41,052 --> 00:31:41,928
Hey! Watch it!

443
00:31:42,012 --> 00:31:43,491
(horn blaring)

444
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:16,645
I just couldn't handle the freeways any more.

445
00:32:16,732 --> 00:32:18,085
I got so tense.

446
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:22,450
This way,
I can just relax all the way to work.

447
00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:24,363
Yeah, well, I love my car.

448
00:32:24,452 --> 00:32:25,931
I miss my car.

449
00:32:37,452 --> 00:32:39,647
Oh, God. Look at that.

450
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:42,849
Hey, Sam!

451
00:32:42,932 --> 00:32:43,842
Shit.

452
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:45,160
- Sam!
- What?

453
00:32:45,252 --> 00:32:48,210
Why don't you just drive over
these people or something?

454
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:49,611
Don't spit on my bus, Annie.

455
00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:52,524
Such a mess.

456
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:08,728
Stop!

457
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,645
Open up!

458
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:17,882
Get off the door. This ain't no bus stop.

459
00:33:17,972 --> 00:33:19,564
He really wants on the bus.

460
00:33:19,652 --> 00:33:20,846
Open up! Stop!

461
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,400
Don't, Sam! Don't let him on!

462
00:33:23,492 --> 00:33:24,368
LAPD!

463
00:33:24,452 --> 00:33:25,771
I can't hear you!

464
00:33:25,852 --> 00:33:26,841
Stop this bus!

465
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:27,967
What?

466
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:29,405
LAPD!

467
00:33:29,492 --> 00:33:30,811
Stop the bus!

468
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:32,166
LAPD!

469
00:33:36,212 --> 00:33:36,769
Stop!

470
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:38,088
Stop!

471
00:33:39,212 --> 00:33:42,329
Stop! LAPD! Get out of the car.

472
00:33:42,412 --> 00:33:43,970
This is my car. I own this car.

473
00:33:44,052 --> 00:33:45,929
It's not stolen.

474
00:33:46,012 --> 00:33:47,525
It is now. Move over.

475
00:33:47,612 --> 00:33:48,488
Fuck!

476
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:50,449
Man, you scratch this puppy...

477
00:33:50,532 --> 00:33:52,568
..and me and you are gonna have words.

478
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:54,131
You understand?

479
00:34:11,612 --> 00:34:14,843
OK, look, man,
we don't have to go so fast.

480
00:34:14,932 --> 00:34:16,923
Just slow down a little bit. Holy shit.

481
00:34:17,012 --> 00:34:18,411
Oh, shit.

482
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:20,801
Come on, man.

483
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,008
Just don't tear up my car, all right?

484
00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:25,048
OK, OK.

485
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:27,521
Just slow down just a bit, all right?

486
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:29,921
We don't have to go so fast, do we?

487
00:34:30,012 --> 00:34:32,446
We don't have to go so...

488
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:35,171
That was a nice move, man.

489
00:34:36,732 --> 00:34:38,006
Whoo!

490
00:34:47,612 --> 00:34:49,807
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

491
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:52,360
The least you can do is slow down.

492
00:34:52,452 --> 00:34:53,328
Come on.

493
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:55,004
Oh, shit.

494
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,491
Slow!

495
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:57,402
Shit!

496
00:34:57,492 --> 00:34:59,210
(horn)

497
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:00,407
Move! Move!

498
00:35:02,932 --> 00:35:04,365
Is that that guy?

499
00:35:04,452 --> 00:35:07,808
Man sure has a hard-on for this bus.

500
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:14,086
(beep)

501
00:35:15,972 --> 00:35:17,644
(horn)

502
00:35:17,732 --> 00:35:18,721
Hey, buddy...

503
00:35:22,492 --> 00:35:25,086
Hey! I'm a cop!

504
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:26,764
What?

505
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:28,920
I'm a cop!

506
00:35:29,012 --> 00:35:31,287
LAPD!

507
00:35:31,372 --> 00:35:32,930
There's a bomb on your bus!

508
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:36,200
- What?
- There's a bomb on your bus!

509
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:37,645
There's a... What?

510
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:38,764
Fuck!

511
00:35:38,852 --> 00:35:40,683
There's a bomb on your bus!

512
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:41,921
Watch the road!

513
00:35:42,492 --> 00:35:45,370
Grab that.
I want you to write on it.

514
00:35:45,452 --> 00:35:48,569
I want you to write on the back:
"Bomb on bus."

515
00:35:50,252 --> 00:35:51,731
Write it, write it, write it!

516
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:08,524
Watch the road. Oh, shit.

517
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:22,208
Oh, shit!

518
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:23,407
No!

519
00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:25,406
Don't slow down!

520
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:27,611
(horn)

521
00:36:30,092 --> 00:36:32,890
No! No, no, no, no, no!

522
00:36:32,972 --> 00:36:34,644
Speed up!

523
00:36:35,412 --> 00:36:36,367
Op...

524
00:36:37,012 --> 00:36:38,491
Open your door!

525
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:40,725
Open the doors!

526
00:36:43,932 --> 00:36:45,001
50!

527
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:46,411
Stay above 50!

528
00:36:46,492 --> 00:36:49,131
- OK.
- All right?

529
00:36:51,932 --> 00:36:56,403
470-8000.
Ask for Detective Harry Temple.

530
00:36:58,692 --> 00:37:00,011
Harry.

531
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,401
Harry, it's Jack.

532
00:37:02,492 --> 00:37:04,289
All right. Yep.

533
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:08,888
You better not be calling in sick,
'cause I dragged my ass...

534
00:37:08,972 --> 00:37:10,690
Harry, he's alive.

535
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:11,568
What?

536
00:37:11,652 --> 00:37:14,325
The bomber. He's back.

537
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:17,290
He hit one in Venice already.
Fire Chief said there's nothing left.

538
00:37:17,372 --> 00:37:19,681
Temple! We just got a ransom demand
from your dead terrorist.

539
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:21,763
Says he's rigged a city bus.
Where's Jack?

540
00:37:21,852 --> 00:37:23,126
Where do you think?

541
00:37:23,212 --> 00:37:24,884
I gotta get on that bus.

542
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:28,009
You gotta get on...
Yeah. You get on the bus.

543
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:29,730
Drive straight!

544
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:31,404
Stay in this lane!

545
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:34,445
Watch the road.

546
00:37:37,332 --> 00:37:39,562
Wait a minute. What are you doing?

547
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:41,521
Are you insured?

548
00:37:41,612 --> 00:37:42,727
Yeah! Why?

549
00:37:42,812 --> 00:37:43,801
(brakes squeal)

550
00:37:43,892 --> 00:37:44,722
No! No!

551
00:37:48,492 --> 00:37:51,564
You broke my... my door.

552
00:37:51,652 --> 00:37:54,530
Sir, I need to take your phone.

553
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:56,170
Take the phone.

554
00:37:56,252 --> 00:37:57,571
Take the wheel.

555
00:37:57,652 --> 00:37:58,880
What are you...

556
00:37:58,972 --> 00:37:59,961
What?

557
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:01,371
Oh, oh, shit.

558
00:38:01,452 --> 00:38:03,124
Whoa, shit.

559
00:38:08,692 --> 00:38:09,886
Drive straight.

560
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:16,288
Oh, shit.

561
00:38:16,372 --> 00:38:17,646
Whoa, shit.

562
00:38:22,412 --> 00:38:23,606
Whoa, shit!

563
00:38:26,612 --> 00:38:27,965
Whoa! Shit!

564
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,770
This guy's out of his mind.

565
00:38:45,332 --> 00:38:47,323
OK, listen, you've got to stay above 50.

566
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:50,162
Excuse me, are you out of your mind?

567
00:38:50,252 --> 00:38:51,367
Whatever it takes.

568
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:52,089
Hello?

569
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:56,128
Everybody, I'm Jack Traven, LAPD.

570
00:38:56,212 --> 00:38:58,282
We have a slight situation on the bus here.

571
00:38:58,372 --> 00:38:59,930
Ma'am, if you'll please sit down.

572
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:01,365
You're scaring the shit out of these people.

573
00:39:01,452 --> 00:39:03,329
Ma'am, please!

574
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:08,366
If everybody will stay in your seats...

575
00:39:08,452 --> 00:39:09,771
..and remain calm,...

576
00:39:09,852 --> 00:39:12,286
..we should be able to defuse the problem,...

577
00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:13,327
..so sit tight...

578
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:14,811
Get away from me!

579
00:39:19,252 --> 00:39:21,846
I don't know you, man.
I'm not here for you.

580
00:39:21,932 --> 00:39:23,251
Let's not do this.

581
00:39:23,332 --> 00:39:25,129
- Stop the bus!
- He can't!

582
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:28,807
Stop the bus! Stop it!

583
00:39:28,892 --> 00:39:30,644
Listen!

584
00:39:30,732 --> 00:39:33,610
Look, I'm putting my gun away, OK?

585
00:39:36,092 --> 00:39:36,968
OK?

586
00:39:39,612 --> 00:39:40,681
Now, listen.

587
00:39:40,772 --> 00:39:43,081
I don't care about your crime.

588
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,730
Whatever you did,...

589
00:39:44,812 --> 00:39:49,647
...I'm sure that you're sorry,
so it's cool now.

590
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:50,403
It's over.

591
00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:57,328
I'm not a cop right now.

592
00:39:58,892 --> 00:40:00,041
See?

593
00:40:00,132 --> 00:40:03,886
We're just two cool guys,
just hanging out...

594
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:07,451
(gunshot)

595
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:08,567
Sam!

596
00:40:12,692 --> 00:40:14,364
I'll get the wheel!

597
00:40:14,452 --> 00:40:16,329
I've got it! Sam! Oh God, Sam!

598
00:40:18,972 --> 00:40:20,963
(horn)

599
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,566
(Annie) Come on.
You've got to move your legs.

600
00:40:23,652 --> 00:40:25,643
Somebody move his legs!

601
00:40:25,732 --> 00:40:27,165
Hold on!

602
00:40:27,252 --> 00:40:30,369
Sam, get your foot...
get your foot off the pedal!

603
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:32,363
I got to stop this thing!

604
00:40:32,452 --> 00:40:34,488
No! Don't! Stay above 50!

605
00:40:34,572 --> 00:40:37,040
Sam's been shot!
We've got to get him off!

606
00:40:37,132 --> 00:40:39,168
You slow down and this bus will explode!

607
00:40:44,052 --> 00:40:46,850
There is a bomb on this bus.

608
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:50,641
If we slow down, it'll blow.

609
00:40:52,612 --> 00:40:55,649
If anyone tries to get off, it'll explode.

610
00:40:55,732 --> 00:40:56,448
Bullshit!

611
00:40:56,532 --> 00:40:57,851
Yeah, there's a bomb.

612
00:40:57,932 --> 00:40:59,490
Some funny joke, man.

613
00:40:59,572 --> 00:41:01,767
Are we gonna have a problem now?

614
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:05,049
He's bleeding so much.
I don't know what to do.

615
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:09,808
Put pressure front and back
and keep his legs up.

616
00:41:09,892 --> 00:41:10,768
Hold on.

617
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:12,251
Sam, lift your head.

618
00:41:12,772 --> 00:41:14,251
Miss, can you handle this bus?

619
00:41:14,332 --> 00:41:16,163
Oh, sure.
It's just like driving a really big Pinto.

620
00:41:16,252 --> 00:41:17,651
I need to know! Can you handle it?

621
00:41:17,732 --> 00:41:20,963
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Just tell me what the plan is.

622
00:41:21,052 --> 00:41:22,371
Is there a plan?

623
00:41:22,452 --> 00:41:23,851
Just for you to drive.

624
00:41:23,932 --> 00:41:25,650
We're OK for now.
Just keep us above 50.

625
00:41:25,732 --> 00:41:26,642
Good plan.

626
00:41:29,212 --> 00:41:30,964
So, you're a cop, right?

627
00:41:31,052 --> 00:41:32,167
That's right.

628
00:41:32,252 --> 00:41:34,846
I should probably tell you
that I'm taking the bus...

629
00:41:34,932 --> 00:41:36,763
...because I had my driver's licence revoked.

630
00:41:37,652 --> 00:41:38,528
What for?

631
00:41:38,612 --> 00:41:40,011
Speeding.

632
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:45,848
Harry, we're on our way to the chopper.

633
00:41:45,932 --> 00:41:47,684
If anything changes, let us know!

634
00:41:47,892 --> 00:41:50,645
Anything we haven't seen
should be in here.

635
00:42:19,572 --> 00:42:21,369
...something wrong with the driver,...

636
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:23,682
...but at least one car, a Jaguar,...

637
00:42:23,772 --> 00:42:26,570
...has been driven off the road
by the speeding bus.

638
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:28,961
The bus apparently came onto the freeway...

639
00:42:29,052 --> 00:42:30,883
...at the Lincoln on-ramp.

640
00:42:30,972 --> 00:42:33,281
It began picking up speed, swerving,...

641
00:42:33,372 --> 00:42:34,691
...and hasn't slowed down since.

642
00:42:34,772 --> 00:42:36,125
Minutes ago...

643
00:42:36,212 --> 00:42:38,009
...a Los Angeles police officer
boarded the bus...

644
00:42:38,092 --> 00:42:39,491
...by jumping onto it from a moving car.

645
00:42:39,572 --> 00:42:41,369
Would that be you, Jack?

646
00:42:42,772 --> 00:42:44,524
(Jack) Where do we start?

647
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:45,965
Check the speedometer.

648
00:42:46,052 --> 00:42:48,202
Has it been fucked with or loosened?

649
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:50,089
See any wires or anything?

650
00:42:50,172 --> 00:42:51,810
Excuse me, ma'am.

651
00:42:51,892 --> 00:42:53,530
No, it's clean.

652
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,886
Then it's gonna be under the bus.

653
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,963
Probably was rigged to one of the axles.

654
00:42:57,052 --> 00:42:59,771
I can't get under the bus right now.
It's kind of in motion.

655
00:42:59,852 --> 00:43:01,251
Excuse me!

656
00:43:01,332 --> 00:43:02,481
Excuse me!

657
00:43:02,572 --> 00:43:03,368
Hold on.

658
00:43:03,452 --> 00:43:04,567
Yes?

659
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:07,325
Access panel... in the floor.

660
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:10,124
Underneath you, man.

661
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:14,809
All right, Harry.
We're in. Passenger relay.

662
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:18,407
Sir, take this.
I want you to tell him what I see.

663
00:43:19,812 --> 00:43:21,006
OK,...

664
00:43:21,092 --> 00:43:22,366
...we got a wad!

665
00:43:22,452 --> 00:43:24,329
Pretty big!

666
00:43:24,412 --> 00:43:26,482
There's a pretty big wad.

667
00:43:26,572 --> 00:43:27,561
Brass fittings!

668
00:43:27,732 --> 00:43:28,369
Brass fittings.

669
00:43:28,452 --> 00:43:30,204
I think I can reach the circuit wire.

670
00:43:30,292 --> 00:43:31,930
He can reach the circuit wire.

671
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:34,845
No, no. Don't do that.
That's a decoy. Classic.

672
00:43:34,932 --> 00:43:36,285
That's your classic decoy.

673
00:43:36,372 --> 00:43:37,043
What else?

674
00:43:37,132 --> 00:43:37,609
What else?

675
00:43:37,692 --> 00:43:38,807
Hold on.

676
00:43:38,972 --> 00:43:39,927
Hold on.

677
00:43:49,692 --> 00:43:50,966
Fuck me!

678
00:43:52,852 --> 00:43:54,410
Oh, darn.

679
00:43:56,412 --> 00:43:59,324
Harry, there's enough C-4 on this thing...

680
00:43:59,412 --> 00:44:00,811
...to put a hole in the world.

681
00:44:00,892 --> 00:44:02,723
OK, all right. Just stay calm.

682
00:44:02,812 --> 00:44:03,927
What else?

683
00:44:04,012 --> 00:44:05,968
Three triggers...
one on the axle I can't really see,...

684
00:44:06,052 --> 00:44:07,644
...a cellular remote and a timer...

685
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:09,290
...running off a wrist watch.

686
00:44:10,212 --> 00:44:12,089
A watch? What kind of watch?

687
00:44:12,172 --> 00:44:13,287
Gold.

688
00:44:13,372 --> 00:44:15,203
Gold band. Fairly cheesy.

689
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:16,361
Officer!

690
00:44:17,012 --> 00:44:19,082
- Officer!
- What's on your mind, Harry?

691
00:44:20,252 --> 00:44:22,322
Shit. What do I do? OFFICER!

692
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,084
What do I do? Which way?

693
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:25,441
Oh, shit.

694
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:26,851
Get on the shoulder.

695
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:27,842
OK.

696
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:41,608
Watch it!

697
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,163
Um, stay on or get off?

698
00:44:50,252 --> 00:44:52,208
Stay on or get off?

699
00:44:52,412 --> 00:44:54,403
- Off! Off!
- OK.

700
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:55,402
Hold on!

701
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,561
(screaming)

702
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:12,923
Oh, God.

703
00:45:19,212 --> 00:45:20,440
- Keep going.
- It's red!

704
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:22,521
Go!

705
00:45:22,612 --> 00:45:23,965
Go! Go!

706
00:45:28,212 --> 00:45:29,281
Oh, God!

707
00:45:30,212 --> 00:45:32,567
(horns blaring)

708
00:45:37,572 --> 00:45:39,642
This is much better.

709
00:45:42,012 --> 00:45:42,808
..city streets.

710
00:45:42,892 --> 00:45:44,769
The bus is on Western...

711
00:45:44,852 --> 00:45:46,683
..heading in a southbound direction.

712
00:45:46,772 --> 00:45:49,002
Now, where the bus did exit here,...

713
00:45:49,092 --> 00:45:50,810
..it had a couple of close calls.

714
00:45:50,892 --> 00:45:53,486
Yeah! Yeah! All right!

715
00:45:53,572 --> 00:45:56,609
We don't know
what authorities are planning to do.

716
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:06,689
I don't get it.

717
00:46:06,772 --> 00:46:08,569
The watch is a shitty timer.

718
00:46:08,652 --> 00:46:10,722
Why use it? What's he saying?

719
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:12,370
Lots of people have watches, Harry.

720
00:46:12,452 --> 00:46:13,885
This guy has no MO.

721
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:16,281
A bomber falls in love
with one kind of bomb...

722
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:17,805
...and they're very monogamous.

723
00:46:17,892 --> 00:46:20,167
This guy uses C-4, dynamite,...

724
00:46:20,252 --> 00:46:21,605
...different trigger every time,...

725
00:46:21,692 --> 00:46:23,330
...and now he throws in this watch.

726
00:46:23,412 --> 00:46:24,891
He's an encyclopaedia of bombs.

727
00:46:24,972 --> 00:46:26,291
He knows every kind.

728
00:46:26,372 --> 00:46:29,250
Yeah, and everything we do to dismantle it.

729
00:46:30,692 --> 00:46:32,364
Wait a minute.

730
00:46:33,572 --> 00:46:37,121
I want to look at the files
for the last 10 years.

731
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:38,770
We did the mug shots.
It's not gonna help.

732
00:46:38,852 --> 00:46:39,807
No.

733
00:46:39,892 --> 00:46:41,211
I want to look at cops.

734
00:46:41,292 --> 00:46:43,203
Come on. Let's go.

735
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:49,321
(phone)

736
00:46:49,412 --> 00:46:51,721
Yeah. Mac, where have you been?

737
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:53,689
I had to bail on the freeway.

738
00:46:53,772 --> 00:46:55,205
We're in the city.

739
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:56,611
I can see you.

740
00:46:56,692 --> 00:46:58,330
Just keep going straight.

741
00:46:58,412 --> 00:47:00,687
I'm going to try to clear the roads for you.

742
00:47:00,772 --> 00:47:02,171
Just stay on-line.

743
00:47:05,652 --> 00:47:06,687
Shit! Oh, Jesus!

744
00:47:06,772 --> 00:47:08,000
God! No!

745
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:09,081
Go left!

746
00:47:09,732 --> 00:47:11,245
Sorry!

747
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:12,931
Oh, my God!

748
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:22,041
Oh, jeez!

749
00:47:24,332 --> 00:47:25,731
People, stay out of my way!

750
00:47:25,812 --> 00:47:27,689
Stay out of my way!

751
00:47:27,772 --> 00:47:28,727
Ma'am, up to the right.

752
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:31,451
OK, OK I see it. Sh...

753
00:47:37,652 --> 00:47:41,042
Mac! Mac!
You've got to get me out of here!

754
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:42,968
Oh, yeah.

755
00:47:43,052 --> 00:47:44,007
All right?

756
00:47:44,092 --> 00:47:45,366
A few more blocks,...

757
00:47:45,452 --> 00:47:47,170
...you'll come up to a soft turn.

758
00:47:47,252 --> 00:47:48,207
Right.

759
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:49,122
Then hold straight.

760
00:47:49,212 --> 00:47:51,646
I've got some units waiting for you there.

761
00:47:51,732 --> 00:47:53,563
They're gonna lead you to the 105 Freeway.

762
00:47:53,652 --> 00:47:55,131
It's not in use.

763
00:47:55,212 --> 00:47:56,486
It'll be empty.

764
00:47:56,572 --> 00:47:57,891
You'll be totally clear.

765
00:47:57,972 --> 00:47:58,961
Got it.

766
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:04,362
In a few blocks,
we'll take a soft turn to the right.

767
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,047
OK, wait a minute. Escort to where?

768
00:48:11,132 --> 00:48:12,201
Where do we get an escort to?

769
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:12,929
Watch out!

770
00:48:16,172 --> 00:48:17,287
Oh, God!

771
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:24,165
Son of a bitch!

772
00:48:24,252 --> 00:48:26,686
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God! I hit the baby!

773
00:48:26,772 --> 00:48:28,410
(yelling)

774
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:31,245
Oh, God! I just hit the baby!

775
00:48:31,332 --> 00:48:32,208
Cans!

776
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:34,760
There was no baby. It was full of cans.

777
00:48:34,852 --> 00:48:36,251
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

778
00:48:53,092 --> 00:48:54,241
OK, let's go.

779
00:48:55,452 --> 00:48:56,043
Jeez!

780
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:57,326
No! No! No!

781
00:48:58,332 --> 00:48:59,526
Get back!

782
00:49:05,252 --> 00:49:07,049
Why aren't they in school?

783
00:49:07,132 --> 00:49:09,168
Mac, we're boned.

784
00:49:09,252 --> 00:49:11,049
I'll get you out, Jack.

785
00:49:19,572 --> 00:49:20,766
All right, listen.

786
00:49:20,852 --> 00:49:22,490
You got an entrance coming up, Jack.

787
00:49:22,572 --> 00:49:24,847
It's gonna be a real ugly turn, though.

788
00:49:26,092 --> 00:49:27,002
How ugly?

789
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:28,002
What's ugly?

790
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:30,526
We got a hard right coming up...

791
00:49:30,612 --> 00:49:31,840
..at the construction site.

792
00:49:31,932 --> 00:49:33,570
This should be it.

793
00:49:33,652 --> 00:49:34,801
That's a dead end.

794
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:36,041
I can't make that turn.

795
00:49:36,132 --> 00:49:38,407
You can make it. Keep left.

796
00:49:38,492 --> 00:49:39,163
Keep left and make it wide.

797
00:49:39,252 --> 00:49:41,607
Oh, God. We're going to tip over.

798
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:43,842
You're right. We're going to tip over.

799
00:49:43,932 --> 00:49:46,321
Everyone on this side ofthe bus now!

800
00:49:46,412 --> 00:49:48,448
On this side ofthe bus!

801
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:50,322
Hold on!

802
00:49:51,652 --> 00:49:54,883
Over here! Over here!
As far as you can! Now!

803
00:49:54,972 --> 00:49:56,724
Mac, you better clear this site out.

804
00:50:03,772 --> 00:50:05,330
Everybody hold on!

805
00:50:05,412 --> 00:50:06,481
This side of the bus!

806
00:50:06,572 --> 00:50:08,085
Hold on!

807
00:50:09,332 --> 00:50:10,321
Hold on!

808
00:50:10,412 --> 00:50:11,811
Oh, God! Here we go!

809
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:13,604
Here we go!

810
00:50:16,612 --> 00:50:18,125
Here we go!

811
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:31,891
Whoo!

812
00:50:31,972 --> 00:50:33,371
Oh, my God!

813
00:50:33,452 --> 00:50:35,249
Oh, God! ls everybody all right?

814
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,482
- Yes!
- Oh, my God.

815
00:50:37,572 --> 00:50:40,132
Take me to that interchange at the 105.

816
00:50:49,932 --> 00:50:52,048
Oh, my God. We might've died.

817
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,485
I can't think.

818
00:50:53,572 --> 00:50:54,448
It's OK.

819
00:50:54,532 --> 00:50:58,002
if you need to,
you go right ahead and vomit.

820
00:51:02,052 --> 00:51:03,041
Hold it right there!

821
00:51:13,412 --> 00:51:14,288
Hurry up!

822
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:15,843
Frank,...

823
00:51:15,932 --> 00:51:18,605
...get rid of that scaffolding
and replace it with webbing.

824
00:51:18,692 --> 00:51:19,568
OK.

825
00:51:19,652 --> 00:51:21,768
Norwood, I want aerial units up ahead.

826
00:51:21,852 --> 00:51:23,251
No obstructions in the freeway.

827
00:51:23,332 --> 00:51:25,766
We have a window here.
I want to make sure it stays open.

828
00:51:46,612 --> 00:51:48,364
Shoot.

829
00:51:48,452 --> 00:51:50,807
Could you do me a favour...

830
00:51:50,892 --> 00:51:53,452
...and hold the wheel for me for a second?

831
00:51:53,532 --> 00:51:55,363
Hold the wheel? Thank you.

832
00:51:55,452 --> 00:51:57,124
Ma'am, you did very well.

833
00:51:57,212 --> 00:52:00,648
Actually, you were incredible.
I've never seen driving like that.

834
00:52:00,732 --> 00:52:01,642
Annie.

835
00:52:01,732 --> 00:52:02,562
What?

836
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:05,007
It's my name. Annie.

837
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:06,764
Annie.

838
00:52:06,852 --> 00:52:08,604
As opposed to ma'am.

839
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:09,602
OK.

840
00:52:13,132 --> 00:52:15,009
So,...

841
00:52:15,092 --> 00:52:16,889
..why is all this happening?

842
00:52:16,972 --> 00:52:19,281
I mean, what did we do?

843
00:52:19,372 --> 00:52:21,442
Bomb the guy's country or something?

844
00:52:21,532 --> 00:52:24,171
No. It's just a guy who wants money.

845
00:52:25,212 --> 00:52:26,247
I don't buy that.

846
00:52:26,332 --> 00:52:28,687
It's not a very good way to make money.

847
00:52:28,772 --> 00:52:30,842
So, um...

848
00:52:30,932 --> 00:52:33,321
..what is this guy's deal?

849
00:52:33,412 --> 00:52:37,121
A while back,
he held some people for ransom.

850
00:52:37,212 --> 00:52:40,841
It went sour,
and now he's a little pissed at me.

851
00:52:40,932 --> 00:52:43,241
What does that have to do with us?

852
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:44,765
Nothing. It's a game.

853
00:52:44,852 --> 00:52:47,889
If he gets the money, he wins.
If the bus blows up, he wins.

854
00:52:47,972 --> 00:52:49,371
What if you win?

855
00:52:49,452 --> 00:52:51,044
Then tomorrow we'll play another one.

856
00:52:51,132 --> 00:52:54,090
But I'm not available to drive tomorrow.
Busy.

857
00:52:58,332 --> 00:53:00,687
We got no match for that description.

858
00:53:00,772 --> 00:53:03,445
No-one's lost a thumb
for at least the last 10 years.

859
00:53:03,532 --> 00:53:05,921
- He could be from anywhere.
- I can't access all that.

860
00:53:06,012 --> 00:53:07,240
Forget the files.

861
00:53:07,332 --> 00:53:09,482
I want you to start
going through the pension fund.

862
00:53:09,572 --> 00:53:10,971
This guy's drawing disability.

863
00:53:11,052 --> 00:53:13,327
He may not be LAPD,
but he's living here now.

864
00:53:13,412 --> 00:53:14,242
I want pictures!

865
00:53:15,012 --> 00:53:16,491
I've seen this asshole.

866
00:53:17,732 --> 00:53:18,721
(truck horn)

867
00:53:29,852 --> 00:53:30,762
Hey!

868
00:53:30,852 --> 00:53:31,443
Hey, Mac!

869
00:53:31,532 --> 00:53:33,011
Let's get these passengers off the bus!

870
00:53:33,092 --> 00:53:34,605
We can't do it, sir!

871
00:53:34,692 --> 00:53:36,683
There's no time for any stunts, Traven.

872
00:53:36,772 --> 00:53:39,366
We got to get these people
out of harm's way!

873
00:53:39,452 --> 00:53:41,522
I got orders!
We move these people, he'll see!

874
00:53:43,972 --> 00:53:44,688
Remember,...

875
00:53:44,772 --> 00:53:46,251
..crazy, not stupid!

876
00:53:46,332 --> 00:53:48,971
Harry's trying to find out who this guy is.

877
00:53:49,052 --> 00:53:50,883
We think maybe he's a cop.

878
00:53:50,972 --> 00:53:51,848
Lieutenant,...

879
00:53:51,932 --> 00:53:52,808
..it's him!

880
00:53:52,892 --> 00:53:54,166
He wants to talk to Jack!

881
00:53:55,212 --> 00:53:56,531
He's on the line for you.

882
00:53:56,612 --> 00:53:58,284
OK, give him the number.

883
00:53:58,972 --> 00:54:00,405
Give him the number!

884
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:03,687
How's he doing?

885
00:54:03,772 --> 00:54:05,251
The bleeding is less, but...

886
00:54:05,332 --> 00:54:06,651
Are they going to help us?

887
00:54:06,732 --> 00:54:09,200
Sure they are. They're the police.

888
00:54:09,292 --> 00:54:11,044
Your taxes are paying their salary.

889
00:54:11,132 --> 00:54:13,487
If we die, they got to take a pay cut.

890
00:54:13,572 --> 00:54:14,721
(coughs)

891
00:54:14,812 --> 00:54:17,451
I mean, you know.

892
00:54:17,532 --> 00:54:19,045
(phone)

893
00:54:20,972 --> 00:54:21,848
Yeah.

894
00:54:21,932 --> 00:54:23,285
I think we have trust...

895
00:54:23,372 --> 00:54:26,808
..but it looks on TV like you're trying
to get those passengers off the bus.

896
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:29,247
Look, you've got to let me have one.

897
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:30,685
We went over the rules.

898
00:54:30,772 --> 00:54:32,171
As an act offaith.

899
00:54:32,252 --> 00:54:33,685
We have an injured man here.

900
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:35,171
The driver's been shot.

901
00:54:35,252 --> 00:54:37,322
Jack, tell me that you haven't
been shooting the passengers.

902
00:54:37,412 --> 00:54:42,532
I thought it was customary
for a police officer to shoot the bad guys.

903
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,648
This man has no time.

904
00:54:44,732 --> 00:54:46,290
No-one gets off.

905
00:54:46,372 --> 00:54:48,886
It'll grease the wheels with the money men
if you show some charity.

906
00:54:48,972 --> 00:54:51,361
There's still gonna be plenty of us to kill.

907
00:54:51,452 --> 00:54:52,771
OK, son,...

908
00:54:52,852 --> 00:54:55,764
..you can try and unload the driver.

909
00:54:55,852 --> 00:54:57,570
You tell that wildcat behind the wheel...

910
00:54:57,652 --> 00:54:58,846
..not to slow down, though,...

911
00:54:58,932 --> 00:55:01,400
..or he won't even
get a chance to bleed to death.

912
00:55:01,492 --> 00:55:02,811
And, Jack,...

913
00:55:02,892 --> 00:55:05,122
..don't slip.

914
00:55:05,212 --> 00:55:07,009
He's letting us unload the driver.

915
00:55:07,092 --> 00:55:08,002
Norwood!

916
00:55:08,092 --> 00:55:09,650
Get us closer!

917
00:55:09,732 --> 00:55:11,962
We're going to get the driver off.

918
00:55:12,052 --> 00:55:13,041
Just him?

919
00:55:13,132 --> 00:55:14,281
For now. Gigantor!

920
00:55:14,372 --> 00:55:15,361
Ortiz.

921
00:55:15,532 --> 00:55:16,282
Ortiz,...

922
00:55:16,372 --> 00:55:18,169
..we're going to need your help.

923
00:55:18,252 --> 00:55:19,651
I need you to pass him to me.

924
00:55:19,732 --> 00:55:22,007
Keep him straight,
or I think the wound will tear.

925
00:55:22,092 --> 00:55:23,889
What about the rest of us?

926
00:55:23,972 --> 00:55:25,371
Hey, hey, hey, lady!

927
00:55:25,452 --> 00:55:27,249
I've got you.

928
00:55:27,332 --> 00:55:29,721
I can't stay! I can't stay.

929
00:55:29,812 --> 00:55:31,165
How are you feeling?

930
00:55:31,252 --> 00:55:32,605
Like I've been shot.

931
00:55:32,692 --> 00:55:33,886
Take care, Sam.

932
00:55:33,972 --> 00:55:34,768
OK, Annie.

933
00:55:36,412 --> 00:55:38,562
Drive straight! Keep it straight!

934
00:55:41,052 --> 00:55:42,770
OK, Annie, get as close as you can.

935
00:55:42,852 --> 00:55:43,807
OK?

936
00:55:43,892 --> 00:55:44,847
All right.

937
00:55:45,452 --> 00:55:46,362
Closer!

938
00:55:47,292 --> 00:55:48,850
A little closer, Annie!

939
00:55:50,492 --> 00:55:52,448
Annie, a little closer!

940
00:55:52,532 --> 00:55:53,009
OK.

941
00:55:53,932 --> 00:55:55,570
OK, how's this?

942
00:55:58,572 --> 00:55:59,925
Sorry. Sorry.

943
00:56:00,012 --> 00:56:01,411
OK, Annie. No problem.

944
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:03,210
Let's try it one more time.

945
00:56:04,892 --> 00:56:06,689
A little more!

946
00:56:06,772 --> 00:56:08,569
OK! OK! Right there! Steady!

947
00:56:08,652 --> 00:56:10,608
Hold it steady!

948
00:56:10,692 --> 00:56:12,045
I got him!

949
00:56:12,132 --> 00:56:13,406
I got him!

950
00:56:15,932 --> 00:56:16,444
Stand clear!

951
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:18,967
All right?

952
00:56:19,052 --> 00:56:21,282
I'm all right. Thanks.

953
00:56:21,372 --> 00:56:23,249
Oh, my God.

954
00:56:23,332 --> 00:56:24,845
Yes!

955
00:56:34,092 --> 00:56:35,844
(Jack) He's going to be OK.

956
00:56:37,972 --> 00:56:41,009
Come on, lady. Give me your hand.

957
00:56:41,092 --> 00:56:42,411
I have to, Annie.

958
00:56:42,492 --> 00:56:43,368
No, Helen!

959
00:56:43,452 --> 00:56:44,885
No, Helen, no!

960
00:56:44,972 --> 00:56:45,927
Come on!

961
00:56:46,012 --> 00:56:47,047
Helen, no!

962
00:56:47,132 --> 00:56:49,327
(TV) I'm here at the 105 Freeway,...

963
00:56:49,412 --> 00:56:52,370
...where the police
have successfully led the runaway bus...

964
00:56:54,972 --> 00:56:55,882
No, Helen!

965
00:57:10,972 --> 00:57:14,362
Goddamn it, Mac,
get those fucking choppers out of here!

966
00:57:14,452 --> 00:57:17,603
...was driving the bus.
Well, I couldn't tell how old...

967
00:57:17,692 --> 00:57:18,568
...an explosion.

968
00:57:18,652 --> 00:57:19,971
Some kind of an explosion.

969
00:57:20,052 --> 00:57:21,405
The bus hasn't exploded,...

970
00:57:21,492 --> 00:57:23,483
...but... Oh, my God.

971
00:57:23,572 --> 00:57:25,369
A woman caught in the blast fell.

972
00:57:25,452 --> 00:57:27,807
She was pulled under the wheels.
This is terrible.

973
00:57:27,892 --> 00:57:29,245
Interactive TV, Jack.

974
00:57:29,332 --> 00:57:31,971
Wave of the future, huh?

975
00:57:52,852 --> 00:57:54,251
I can't be here.

976
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,283
I can't, you know...

977
00:57:58,372 --> 00:58:01,330
...this is the wrong bus.

978
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:03,323
I mean, for me to...

979
00:58:04,852 --> 00:58:06,205
I can't die here.

980
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:08,647
Hey, shut up, man.

981
00:58:09,732 --> 00:58:11,131
I got a wife.

982
00:58:11,212 --> 00:58:12,406
Oh, you do?

983
00:58:12,492 --> 00:58:14,722
Hey! So if you have a wife...

984
00:58:14,812 --> 00:58:17,042
...and I don't,
does that mean I'm expendable?

985
00:58:17,132 --> 00:58:18,963
What are you talking about?

986
00:58:19,052 --> 00:58:20,405
The guy's just talking crazy.

987
00:58:20,492 --> 00:58:22,210
He gets on my nerves.

988
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:24,442
He gets on everybody's nerves.

989
00:58:24,532 --> 00:58:24,930
Oh, yeah?

990
00:58:25,012 --> 00:58:27,321
I think I have the right to be a little upset.

991
00:58:27,412 --> 00:58:29,243
What are you staring at, anyway?

992
00:58:29,692 --> 00:58:30,681
Why don't you let everybody...

993
00:58:30,772 --> 00:58:32,728
...die in peace,
if that's what's gonna happen?

994
00:58:32,812 --> 00:58:35,724
I'm sure you're a really tough guy, huh?
You're really tough!

995
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:37,564
Why don't we just step outside?

996
00:58:37,652 --> 00:58:38,641
Hey!

997
00:58:52,652 --> 00:58:54,961
How are you doing? You all right?

998
00:58:55,052 --> 00:58:56,041
Mm-mm.

999
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,565
What can I do?

1000
00:58:59,772 --> 00:59:02,081
When that bomb went off...

1001
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:03,571
I know.

1002
00:59:03,652 --> 00:59:05,449
I thought that was it.

1003
00:59:05,532 --> 00:59:07,841
I thought that was the bomb, and I was dead.

1004
00:59:07,932 --> 00:59:11,481
And when I saw her body fall under the bus,
it was like...

1005
00:59:12,452 --> 00:59:14,761
You were glad you were still alive.

1006
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:15,841
Mm-hmm.

1007
00:59:17,172 --> 00:59:18,571
I'm so sorry.

1008
00:59:18,652 --> 00:59:19,482
Don't be.

1009
00:59:19,572 --> 00:59:22,450
You should be glad. We all are.

1010
00:59:23,652 --> 00:59:25,563
It doesn't mean you don't care.

1011
00:59:25,652 --> 00:59:27,802
I know, but she was so scared.

1012
00:59:27,892 --> 00:59:30,645
She was scared. She was a nice lady
who didn't deserve to get killed,...

1013
00:59:30,732 --> 00:59:33,769
...but if she'd gotten off,
it would have killed us all.

1014
00:59:33,852 --> 00:59:37,686
He's the asshole, Annie,
the guy who put us here. Remember that.

1015
00:59:38,372 --> 00:59:39,566
Big asshole.

1016
00:59:41,092 --> 00:59:42,491
OK.

1017
00:59:45,852 --> 00:59:47,843
Are you sure?

1018
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:49,490
Well, how far?

1019
00:59:52,572 --> 00:59:54,881
Sir, we have a serious problem.

1020
00:59:54,972 --> 00:59:57,167
What?

1021
00:59:57,252 --> 00:59:59,402
This freeway isn't finished.

1022
00:59:59,492 --> 01:00:01,369
What are you talking about?

1023
01:00:01,452 --> 01:00:04,888
The aerial unit caught it.
About 3 miles ahead,...

1024
01:00:04,972 --> 01:00:06,451
..there's a section missing.

1025
01:00:06,532 --> 01:00:07,885
Section missing?

1026
01:00:12,732 --> 01:00:14,085
But it's on the map.

1027
01:00:14,172 --> 01:00:16,049
It's finished on the goddamn map!

1028
01:00:16,132 --> 01:00:19,329
I guess they fell behind.

1029
01:00:20,772 --> 01:00:21,887
Fuck!

1030
01:00:21,972 --> 01:00:24,167
You're fired. Everybody's fucking fired!

1031
01:00:25,572 --> 01:00:26,891
Get me closer!

1032
01:00:26,972 --> 01:00:28,371
Hey, get closer.

1033
01:00:28,452 --> 01:00:30,488
Watch him in the mirror.

1034
01:00:30,572 --> 01:00:32,051
Jack!

1035
01:00:34,332 --> 01:00:36,448
How big is the section?

1036
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:38,887
50 feet... at least.

1037
01:00:43,332 --> 01:00:46,085
There's a gap in the road up ahead.

1038
01:00:46,172 --> 01:00:47,048
It's big.

1039
01:00:47,132 --> 01:00:49,441
You're kidding. How big?

1040
01:00:49,532 --> 01:00:51,443
50 feet.

1041
01:00:51,532 --> 01:00:52,487
What?

1042
01:00:52,572 --> 01:00:55,325
We got to get these people
off the bus somehow.

1043
01:00:55,412 --> 01:00:56,811
You know I can't.

1044
01:00:57,532 --> 01:00:59,443
(Annie) What did... what did he say?

1045
01:01:00,692 --> 01:01:01,761
Jack?

1046
01:01:01,852 --> 01:01:05,003
Jack, what did he say?

1047
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:06,845
What's the matter?

1048
01:01:12,452 --> 01:01:13,885
There's a gap in the freeway.

1049
01:01:13,972 --> 01:01:15,007
What?

1050
01:01:16,852 --> 01:01:18,205
What do you mean?

1051
01:01:18,292 --> 01:01:19,645
How big is a gap?

1052
01:01:19,732 --> 01:01:22,371
50 feet, a couple of miles ahead.

1053
01:01:22,572 --> 01:01:23,846
This is crazy.

1054
01:01:27,332 --> 01:01:28,970
What is this?

1055
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:30,246
Jeez.

1056
01:01:31,492 --> 01:01:32,288
Jack.

1057
01:01:32,652 --> 01:01:33,801
What if I shift into neutral...

1058
01:01:33,892 --> 01:01:35,086
..and just keep the engine reving?

1059
01:01:35,172 --> 01:01:37,242
No, he'd have thought of that.

1060
01:01:37,332 --> 01:01:38,685
Well, what, then? What?

1061
01:01:38,772 --> 01:01:40,649
What? Jack?

1062
01:01:42,092 --> 01:01:42,729
Floor it.

1063
01:01:42,812 --> 01:01:43,369
What?

1064
01:01:43,452 --> 01:01:44,282
Floor it!

1065
01:01:44,372 --> 01:01:47,569
It's an interchange.
There might be an incline. Floor it.

1066
01:01:47,652 --> 01:01:48,607
Fine.

1067
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:54,602
Everybody hold onto your seats
or whatever you can.

1068
01:01:54,692 --> 01:01:57,809
When we hit the gap, heads down.

1069
01:01:57,892 --> 01:01:58,608
That's it?

1070
01:01:59,092 --> 01:01:59,842
That's it?

1071
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:02,089
That's all we can do.

1072
01:02:02,172 --> 01:02:04,208
Let's put these underneath your seat,
all right?

1073
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:07,283
Put your bags underneath the seat.

1074
01:02:11,452 --> 01:02:14,171
Hey, I didn't mean to shoot the guy.

1075
01:02:14,252 --> 01:02:15,446
Hold on.

1076
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:17,965
Is this really going to work?

1077
01:02:19,412 --> 01:02:20,686
(Annie) Jack.

1078
01:02:22,292 --> 01:02:23,202
Yeah?

1079
01:02:24,772 --> 01:02:25,727
Jack.

1080
01:02:46,492 --> 01:02:48,289
Come on, come on.

1081
01:02:48,372 --> 01:02:49,771
Oh, God.

1082
01:02:49,852 --> 01:02:50,887
Come on!

1083
01:02:50,972 --> 01:02:52,121
Oh, God.

1084
01:03:01,052 --> 01:03:02,167
Oh, shit.

1085
01:03:15,252 --> 01:03:16,924
Everybody hold on!

1086
01:03:28,692 --> 01:03:31,809
Oh, I want to see our baby.

1087
01:03:33,452 --> 01:03:34,601
Oh, God.

1088
01:03:35,252 --> 01:03:36,162
Jack.

1089
01:03:41,772 --> 01:03:42,807
Shit!

1090
01:04:04,492 --> 01:04:05,527
Yes!

1091
01:04:06,532 --> 01:04:09,604
We are way out of control!

1092
01:04:13,572 --> 01:04:15,130
(laughing and cheering)

1093
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:16,489
You OK?

1094
01:04:16,572 --> 01:04:17,084
Yeah.

1095
01:04:17,172 --> 01:04:18,048
You OK?

1096
01:04:18,132 --> 01:04:19,008
I'm OK.

1097
01:04:19,092 --> 01:04:20,491
All right!

1098
01:04:20,572 --> 01:04:22,210
Go on! Let's go!

1099
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,044
Is everybody OK?

1100
01:04:24,132 --> 01:04:25,042
Yes!

1101
01:04:28,092 --> 01:04:29,684
We did it!

1102
01:04:29,772 --> 01:04:30,727
We made it.

1103
01:04:33,572 --> 01:04:34,846
You are the man!

1104
01:04:35,332 --> 01:04:36,003
Thank you.

1105
01:04:36,092 --> 01:04:37,241
Thank you very much.

1106
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:38,765
Yes! We made it! Yeah!

1107
01:04:38,852 --> 01:04:40,490
Oh, shit.

1108
01:04:40,572 --> 01:04:42,164
I think you missed your calling.

1109
01:04:42,252 --> 01:04:43,446
Yeah? What was it?

1110
01:04:44,932 --> 01:04:47,571
Watch the road.
You should have been a pilot.

1111
01:04:47,652 --> 01:04:48,641
Ow.

1112
01:04:54,492 --> 01:04:55,686
Get off.

1113
01:04:55,772 --> 01:04:56,329
What?

1114
01:04:56,412 --> 01:04:57,447
Get off this.

1115
01:04:57,572 --> 01:05:00,245
Now, now. Get off this.

1116
01:05:04,332 --> 01:05:05,242
In there.

1117
01:05:05,332 --> 01:05:07,368
- Where? Right here?
- Yeah.

1118
01:05:07,452 --> 01:05:09,283
- Right here?
- Yeah.

1119
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:10,646
Whoa!

1120
01:05:13,092 --> 01:05:14,969
Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop!

1121
01:05:24,692 --> 01:05:26,444
He's just entered the airport.

1122
01:05:26,532 --> 01:05:28,090
There's thousands of people there.

1123
01:05:28,172 --> 01:05:28,968
That's my boy Jack.

1124
01:05:29,052 --> 01:05:31,407
He'll be able to circle the runways
and buy us some time.

1125
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:34,086
Choppers can't fly in there.
It's restricted airspace.

1126
01:05:34,172 --> 01:05:35,605
He's headed for the end of the field.

1127
01:05:35,692 --> 01:05:38,445
That must be Bravo Tango,
an emergency runway.

1128
01:05:38,532 --> 01:05:40,409
Let's hope it's built. Let's move!

1129
01:05:53,132 --> 01:05:55,566
We're at the airport.

1130
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:57,165
Yeah? So?

1131
01:05:58,652 --> 01:06:00,529
I already seen the airport.

1132
01:06:17,052 --> 01:06:18,849
(phone)

1133
01:06:20,652 --> 01:06:21,528
Yeah?

1134
01:06:21,612 --> 01:06:23,842
Very, very exciting, Jack.

1135
01:06:23,932 --> 01:06:25,843
Some close calls, huh?

1136
01:06:25,932 --> 01:06:27,490
But you've done...

1137
01:06:27,572 --> 01:06:28,766
..all right for yourself.

1138
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:29,602
What do you want?

1139
01:06:29,692 --> 01:06:31,045
I want money, Jack.

1140
01:06:31,132 --> 01:06:33,885
I wish I had some loftier purpose,...

1141
01:06:33,972 --> 01:06:37,760
..but I'm afraid in the end
it's just the money, Jack.

1142
01:06:37,852 --> 01:06:41,606
I would like large non-sequential bills...

1143
01:06:41,692 --> 01:06:44,365
..in two clear plastic bags, unmarked.

1144
01:06:44,452 --> 01:06:46,283
Can you remember all that?

1145
01:06:46,372 --> 01:06:48,442
What are you telling me for?

1146
01:06:48,532 --> 01:06:51,808
Because I want you to help me
to get it before it gets too late.

1147
01:06:51,892 --> 01:06:55,089
I hate negotiators. They talk to you
like they're your best friend...

1148
01:06:55,172 --> 01:06:57,481
..and they don't even know you.

1149
01:06:57,572 --> 01:06:59,403
Why are they messing with me?

1150
01:06:59,492 --> 01:07:01,847
Do they think I'm doing this for fun?

1151
01:07:01,932 --> 01:07:03,081
Aren't you?

1152
01:07:03,172 --> 01:07:05,208
Oh, that's unfair, Jack.

1153
01:07:05,292 --> 01:07:07,601
You don't know how I feel about this.

1154
01:07:07,692 --> 01:07:09,523
You don't even know me.

1155
01:07:09,612 --> 01:07:11,921
I know you want a shit load of money
you didn't earn.

1156
01:07:12,012 --> 01:07:13,968
Oh, I earned it.

1157
01:07:14,052 --> 01:07:16,361
I spent my life earning it.

1158
01:07:16,452 --> 01:07:18,647
I got a medal, too, Jack, a medal...

1159
01:07:18,732 --> 01:07:21,849
...and a pink slip
and a "sorry about your hand. "

1160
01:07:21,932 --> 01:07:23,285
You have to let me off.

1161
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:24,691
Oh, no.

1162
01:07:24,772 --> 01:07:26,490
That's not good.

1163
01:07:26,572 --> 01:07:27,766
You want me to help you?

1164
01:07:27,852 --> 01:07:30,286
I need to talk to these people face to face.

1165
01:07:30,372 --> 01:07:31,771
They think you're bullshit.

1166
01:07:31,852 --> 01:07:33,570
They don't think that.

1167
01:07:33,652 --> 01:07:36,120
You want the money,
I don't want anyone else to die.

1168
01:07:36,212 --> 01:07:37,440
Let me get on the ground.

1169
01:07:37,532 --> 01:07:41,207
Just me. That's not against the rules.

1170
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:43,283
All right. I want you back real fast.

1171
01:07:43,372 --> 01:07:45,283
Fine.

1172
01:07:45,372 --> 01:07:47,932
Jack, nothing tricky now.

1173
01:07:48,012 --> 01:07:49,650
You know that I'm on top of you.

1174
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,768
Do not attempt to grow a brain.

1175
01:08:01,012 --> 01:08:03,003
So I guess there's a plan now?

1176
01:08:03,092 --> 01:08:04,491
Could be.

1177
01:08:04,572 --> 01:08:05,448
Yeah?

1178
01:08:05,532 --> 01:08:06,851
He's letting me off.

1179
01:08:06,932 --> 01:08:07,842
What?

1180
01:08:07,932 --> 01:08:10,366
Just keep circling. You'll be fine.

1181
01:08:11,532 --> 01:08:14,251
Everybody, sit tight.
I'm getting off for a minute.

1182
01:08:14,332 --> 01:08:16,004
Do you think that's a good idea?

1183
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,605
Are you just gonna leave us here?

1184
01:08:17,692 --> 01:08:19,410
I would.

1185
01:08:19,492 --> 01:08:21,608
Don't worry. I won't go far.

1186
01:08:21,692 --> 01:08:23,410
Hey.

1187
01:08:23,492 --> 01:08:25,084
Don't forget about us.

1188
01:08:39,612 --> 01:08:41,762
The choppers are gone.
Let's dump the passengers now.

1189
01:08:41,852 --> 01:08:43,444
No way. He's ready for that.

1190
01:08:43,532 --> 01:08:44,885
How is that possible?

1191
01:08:44,972 --> 01:08:46,246
I don't know how. I just know he is.

1192
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:48,448
He's been a step ahead every time.

1193
01:08:48,532 --> 01:08:50,363
If we unload,
he'll take them out, I guarantee.

1194
01:08:50,452 --> 01:08:52,329
Where does that put us?

1195
01:08:52,412 --> 01:08:54,243
I have to try and dismantle that bomb.

1196
01:08:54,492 --> 01:08:58,770
(TV reporter)
After an incredible ride,...

1197
01:08:58,852 --> 01:09:01,161
...this Santa Monica bus has ended up here...

1198
01:09:01,252 --> 01:09:02,924
...at Los Angeles International Airport,...

1199
01:09:03,012 --> 01:09:04,650
...circling the runway.

1200
01:09:16,412 --> 01:09:18,846
I'm telling you, honey,
he's somewhere jerking off.

1201
01:09:18,932 --> 01:09:22,402
He didn't have to get
on the bus in the first place.

1202
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,881
Get your ass behind the yellow line.

1203
01:09:26,812 --> 01:09:28,882
What is that?

1204
01:09:33,652 --> 01:09:35,563
(Annie) I have no idea.

1205
01:09:38,612 --> 01:09:41,126
We won't be able to hold this steady
for very long.

1206
01:09:41,212 --> 01:09:44,363
I just need a few minutes.
If I can't do it by then,...

1207
01:09:44,452 --> 01:09:45,726
...I can't do it at all.

1208
01:09:46,012 --> 01:09:47,081
Harry, you with me?

1209
01:09:47,172 --> 01:09:49,083
(Harry) Yeah. You be careful, Jack.

1210
01:09:53,292 --> 01:09:54,691
What's he doing?

1211
01:09:54,772 --> 01:09:57,161
Oh, my God. He is insane.

1212
01:10:02,972 --> 01:10:03,848
OK, Jack,...

1213
01:10:03,932 --> 01:10:06,651
...this is it. Don't get dead.

1214
01:10:20,092 --> 01:10:21,571
This isn't a very good plan.

1215
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:22,880
Have faith, sister.

1216
01:10:22,972 --> 01:10:23,961
Oh, Christ.

1217
01:10:34,052 --> 01:10:36,088
Just keep it steady.

1218
01:10:36,172 --> 01:10:38,561
Thank you for the tip, Ortiz.

1219
01:10:49,492 --> 01:10:51,289
This guy is nuts!

1220
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:52,691
Gosh.

1221
01:10:52,772 --> 01:10:55,650
We'll try to bypass
the remote current with the battery.

1222
01:10:55,732 --> 01:10:57,802
Can you find the remote's tripwire?

1223
01:10:57,892 --> 01:11:00,360
I don't know. I got a few choices here.

1224
01:11:00,452 --> 01:11:01,805
Black andred?

1225
01:11:01,892 --> 01:11:03,120
And green.

1226
01:11:03,212 --> 01:11:05,043
OK, I'm gonna guess he's not gonna go...

1227
01:11:05,132 --> 01:11:06,963
...with standard copper for the remote.

1228
01:11:07,052 --> 01:11:08,405
That would be too weak.

1229
01:11:08,492 --> 01:11:09,766
I'd use a fibre alloy.

1230
01:11:09,852 --> 01:11:12,889
I need you to look at the wire.

1231
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:16,285
Harry, it's covered.

1232
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,761
I know.
You're gonna have to cut off the sheath.

1233
01:11:18,852 --> 01:11:20,046
But don't cut the wire.

1234
01:11:20,132 --> 01:11:21,645
Right.

1235
01:11:34,172 --> 01:11:35,446
Fuck me!

1236
01:11:37,452 --> 01:11:38,362
Shit!

1237
01:11:44,332 --> 01:11:45,606
- Bull's-eye!
- Great.

1238
01:11:45,692 --> 01:11:47,284
OK, I want you to clip on the battery...

1239
01:11:47,372 --> 01:11:49,203
...and then run it to the lead wire.

1240
01:11:49,292 --> 01:11:50,168
Copy.

1241
01:12:04,532 --> 01:12:05,089
(beep)

1242
01:12:06,332 --> 01:12:08,641
I can't bypass. It'll fire.

1243
01:12:08,732 --> 01:12:11,166
Oh, shit! It's a collapsible circuit.

1244
01:12:11,252 --> 01:12:14,767
Howard Payne, Atlanta PD Bomb Squad.

1245
01:12:14,852 --> 01:12:17,161
Retired in Sun Valley in 1989...

1246
01:12:17,252 --> 01:12:21,040
...when a small charge
left him with fingers numbering nine.

1247
01:12:21,132 --> 01:12:24,329
That's our scumbag! We got him.
Jack, we found him.

1248
01:12:24,412 --> 01:12:25,970
We can get to his place
inside of 15 minutes.

1249
01:12:26,052 --> 01:12:28,282
Jack, I want you
to get out ofthere and sit tight.

1250
01:12:28,372 --> 01:12:29,691
We're going to go after the source.

1251
01:12:29,772 --> 01:12:30,887
Watch your back.

1252
01:12:32,532 --> 01:12:33,885
Wait! Wait for me!

1253
01:12:33,972 --> 01:12:35,928
Mac, get me outta here.

1254
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:52,441
Somebody go to the back and check
and see if he came out the back. Go!

1255
01:13:03,452 --> 01:13:05,761
- Can you see him?
- He's not behind us.

1256
01:13:05,852 --> 01:13:07,888
- What?
- He's not back here.

1257
01:13:07,972 --> 01:13:09,325
Oh, my God. Go look!

1258
01:13:09,412 --> 01:13:12,449
Lay down and look under the bus
and see if you can see him.

1259
01:13:14,132 --> 01:13:15,451
Can you see him?

1260
01:13:15,532 --> 01:13:16,760
No.

1261
01:13:16,852 --> 01:13:19,207
You don't see him
back by the tyre or something?

1262
01:13:19,292 --> 01:13:20,645
I can't see him.

1263
01:13:20,732 --> 01:13:22,848
- Are you sure?
- I can't see him.

1264
01:13:44,332 --> 01:13:45,924
We hit him!

1265
01:13:46,012 --> 01:13:48,003
Oh, my God! Do you see him?

1266
01:13:48,092 --> 01:13:49,411
Did we hit him?

1267
01:13:49,492 --> 01:13:50,766
Look out the sides.

1268
01:13:57,892 --> 01:13:58,449
My tools!

1269
01:13:58,532 --> 01:14:00,250
Somebody get him his tools!

1270
01:14:12,012 --> 01:14:14,890
Please help him! Hurry!

1271
01:14:15,292 --> 01:14:16,645
God, we're dragging him.

1272
01:14:16,732 --> 01:14:18,051
Do you see him?

1273
01:14:18,132 --> 01:14:20,930
Where is he? Is he there?

1274
01:14:22,252 --> 01:14:23,446
(Annie) Do you see him?

1275
01:14:23,532 --> 01:14:24,408
Jack!

1276
01:14:25,532 --> 01:14:26,169
Jack!

1277
01:14:26,252 --> 01:14:27,810
I see him!

1278
01:14:27,892 --> 01:14:28,449
What?

1279
01:14:28,532 --> 01:14:29,806
I see him!

1280
01:14:29,892 --> 01:14:30,529
Is he OK?

1281
01:14:30,612 --> 01:14:32,603
He's all right!

1282
01:14:32,692 --> 01:14:34,330
What?! What?!

1283
01:14:34,412 --> 01:14:37,404
Hold my legs. Somebody hold my legs.

1284
01:14:37,492 --> 01:14:39,050
Hold his legs.

1285
01:14:40,132 --> 01:14:40,803
Hold his legs.

1286
01:14:40,892 --> 01:14:42,086
Come on!

1287
01:14:43,732 --> 01:14:46,121
Come on! I got ya!

1288
01:14:50,372 --> 01:14:51,964
Is he hurt? Is he OK?

1289
01:14:52,052 --> 01:14:52,962
Pull!

1290
01:14:53,732 --> 01:14:54,767
Pull!

1291
01:14:54,852 --> 01:14:56,365
Come on! Come on!

1292
01:14:56,452 --> 01:14:57,805
We got him now.

1293
01:14:57,892 --> 01:14:59,211
Come on, pull!

1294
01:14:59,292 --> 01:15:02,204
Jesus. I can't believe it.

1295
01:15:04,612 --> 01:15:06,125
You're a complete jerk.

1296
01:15:06,212 --> 01:15:07,247
You know that?

1297
01:15:07,852 --> 01:15:08,921
Thank God.

1298
01:15:09,012 --> 01:15:10,525
Have any luck with the bomb?

1299
01:15:10,612 --> 01:15:12,523
Yeah. It didn't go off.

1300
01:15:14,052 --> 01:15:15,167
Ortiz, thanks.

1301
01:15:15,252 --> 01:15:18,210
How many lives you got, man?

1302
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:20,442
You're not too bright, man,...

1303
01:15:20,532 --> 01:15:24,047
...but you got some big, round, hairy cojones.

1304
01:15:25,292 --> 01:15:29,001
That's... very gross, Ortiz.

1305
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:31,890
Huh. Can't even pay him a compliment.

1306
01:15:32,932 --> 01:15:34,251
How you doing?

1307
01:15:34,332 --> 01:15:36,323
You scared the shit out of me, Jack!

1308
01:15:36,412 --> 01:15:39,484
Ow! Other than that, I'm fine.

1309
01:15:39,572 --> 01:15:40,971
What is that smell?

1310
01:15:41,052 --> 01:15:42,087
It's gas.

1311
01:15:42,172 --> 01:15:43,525
We're leaking gas?

1312
01:15:43,612 --> 01:15:45,091
We are now.

1313
01:15:48,612 --> 01:15:51,206
You felt you needed
another challenge or something?

1314
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:52,922
Mac.

1315
01:15:53,012 --> 01:15:54,365
Mac here. Go ahead.

1316
01:15:54,452 --> 01:15:57,524
Can you get a fuel truck to pace us?
We're losing gas.

1317
01:15:57,612 --> 01:15:59,204
I'll see what I can find. How much time?

1318
01:15:59,292 --> 01:16:00,805
I don't know. 10 minutes?

1319
01:16:00,892 --> 01:16:02,928
It doesn't look good.

1320
01:16:03,012 --> 01:16:03,842
Gotcha.

1321
01:16:03,932 --> 01:16:05,411
Get a fuel car out here...

1322
01:16:05,492 --> 01:16:06,925
...on the double.

1323
01:16:07,012 --> 01:16:09,048
Is that going to work?

1324
01:16:09,132 --> 01:16:10,645
I don't know.

1325
01:16:14,292 --> 01:16:16,487
Come on, Harry. Save my life.

1326
01:17:20,156 --> 01:17:21,589
(electronic buzzing)

1327
01:17:39,036 --> 01:17:41,186
(phone)

1328
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,675
Harry, tell me good news, man.

1329
01:17:48,756 --> 01:17:51,429
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack. He didn't make it.

1330
01:17:53,796 --> 01:17:55,354
You fuck!

1331
01:17:56,676 --> 01:17:59,588
It was the watch
that led him to me, wasn't it?

1332
01:17:59,676 --> 01:18:03,271
It seemed a little hammy to me...

1333
01:18:03,356 --> 01:18:06,553
...to build the bomb
out of my precious retirement gift,...

1334
01:18:06,636 --> 01:18:09,434
...but I figured
a sign that said "Howard Payne"...

1335
01:18:09,516 --> 01:18:12,155
...would be pushing it.

1336
01:18:12,236 --> 01:18:16,309
I'm going to rip your fucking spine out,
I swear to God.

1337
01:18:16,396 --> 01:18:18,466
You're gonna do exactly as you're told.

1338
01:18:18,556 --> 01:18:21,309
Jack, we both know that he was the brain...

1339
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,148
...of your particular operation.

1340
01:18:23,236 --> 01:18:24,555
You can't beat me.

1341
01:18:24,636 --> 01:18:26,627
You're going to pay me every dollar.

1342
01:18:26,716 --> 01:18:28,115
Otherwise, you, the wildcat...

1343
01:18:28,196 --> 01:18:30,949
...and every innocent person on that bus...

1344
01:18:31,036 --> 01:18:33,914
...are going to end up just like your friend.

1345
01:18:33,996 --> 01:18:35,349
Are you paying attention?

1346
01:18:35,436 --> 01:18:36,789
Jack, are you listening...

1347
01:18:36,876 --> 01:18:37,831
...to me?

1348
01:18:39,636 --> 01:18:40,955
Jack? Jack?

1349
01:18:41,036 --> 01:18:42,071
Yeah.

1350
01:18:42,196 --> 01:18:43,345
Good.

1351
01:18:43,436 --> 01:18:47,270
You tell them that the drop point
is Pershing Square.

1352
01:18:47,356 --> 01:18:51,190
There's a garbage can
on the northeast corner.

1353
01:18:51,276 --> 01:18:52,834
You drop the bags and leave.

1354
01:18:54,156 --> 01:18:56,954
I don't show until all your people are gone.

1355
01:18:57,036 --> 01:19:00,073
It's getting on to 11 am, Jack,...

1356
01:19:00,156 --> 01:19:05,025
...and I think
it's going to be a very pretty day.

1357
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:14,832
Jack.

1358
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,315
Damn it!

1359
01:19:16,396 --> 01:19:17,988
Damn him! Damn it!

1360
01:19:18,076 --> 01:19:20,067
Don't give up on me!

1361
01:19:20,156 --> 01:19:22,431
Jack, stop it! Jack, come on!

1362
01:19:22,516 --> 01:19:25,588
Stop it, OK?
Don't give up on me right now, all right?

1363
01:19:27,756 --> 01:19:30,475
We're really scared
and we need you right now, all right?

1364
01:19:30,556 --> 01:19:32,911
I can't do this by myself. Please?

1365
01:19:32,996 --> 01:19:34,315
Jack, please.

1366
01:19:39,516 --> 01:19:40,187
OK?

1367
01:19:40,596 --> 01:19:41,472
Please?

1368
01:19:41,556 --> 01:19:42,466
All right?

1369
01:19:47,596 --> 01:19:48,915
We're going to die.

1370
01:19:48,996 --> 01:19:51,669
No, we're not. We got this far, OK?

1371
01:20:13,156 --> 01:20:14,794
I'll be damned.

1372
01:20:18,756 --> 01:20:19,427
Did you go to the...

1373
01:20:19,516 --> 01:20:22,076
...University of Arizona?

1374
01:20:22,156 --> 01:20:23,032
Yeah? So?

1375
01:20:23,116 --> 01:20:24,390
Good football team.

1376
01:20:24,476 --> 01:20:26,512
Yeah, I guess so.

1377
01:20:26,596 --> 01:20:28,029
I don't really know.

1378
01:20:28,116 --> 01:20:29,868
Arizona Wildcats.

1379
01:20:31,596 --> 01:20:32,426
Right.

1380
01:20:32,516 --> 01:20:34,268
He can see you.

1381
01:20:34,356 --> 01:20:35,914
What?

1382
01:20:35,996 --> 01:20:38,112
He can see you.

1383
01:20:38,196 --> 01:20:40,107
Just keep looking straight ahead.

1384
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:58,431
He called you a wildcat before.
I didn't even pick up on it.

1385
01:20:58,516 --> 01:20:59,949
Bastard's got a camera
right in your face.

1386
01:21:00,036 --> 01:21:00,946
He can see the whole bus.

1387
01:21:01,036 --> 01:21:02,947
He's been playing me from minute one.

1388
01:21:03,036 --> 01:21:04,913
Well, he can see me,
but can he hear me?

1389
01:21:04,996 --> 01:21:07,271
Doesn't look like it.
He's just watching.

1390
01:21:12,556 --> 01:21:14,911
(TV) A citybus rigged to explode
if it slows down...

1391
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:18,352
..races around literally in circles
at the Los Angeles airport.

1392
01:21:18,436 --> 01:21:20,745
The two dead are a female passenger
and the driver...

1393
01:21:20,836 --> 01:21:23,669
..of another bus,
both blown up by the bomber.

1394
01:21:23,756 --> 01:21:26,224
The other people in jeopardy are, of course,
the passengers of the bus,...

1395
01:21:26,316 --> 01:21:28,227
..held hostage at the whim of a mad man.

1396
01:21:31,036 --> 01:21:33,630
"The whim of a madman."

1397
01:21:33,716 --> 01:21:35,069
I like that.

1398
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:39,069
There's a camera on the bus
just over my left shoulder.

1399
01:21:39,156 --> 01:21:40,669
I want you to stare...

1400
01:21:40,756 --> 01:21:41,666
..straight ahead.

1401
01:21:42,036 --> 01:21:45,426
Don't make any big movements, OK?

1402
01:21:46,916 --> 01:21:47,826
It's Jack.

1403
01:21:47,916 --> 01:21:50,225
Yeah, I know about Harry.

1404
01:21:52,756 --> 01:21:54,986
Is that news van still around?

1405
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,306
Get those cameras to stop taping.

1406
01:21:58,796 --> 01:22:00,115
LAPD. I need this unit.

1407
01:22:00,196 --> 01:22:01,515
You can broadcast UHF, right?

1408
01:22:01,596 --> 01:22:02,426
Yeah, sure.

1409
01:22:02,516 --> 01:22:04,108
There's a signal going to that bus.

1410
01:22:04,196 --> 01:22:05,595
I want you to find it.

1411
01:22:06,316 --> 01:22:08,671
(officer) Emergency.
We have to take you off the air.

1412
01:22:08,756 --> 01:22:10,348
Please, sir, stop taping.

1413
01:22:10,436 --> 01:22:11,312
Come on.

1414
01:22:11,396 --> 01:22:14,194
Come on. Good! Tape off of that.

1415
01:22:17,076 --> 01:22:21,035
Remember, no big movements.
Just look whipped.

1416
01:22:21,116 --> 01:22:23,584
That ain't gonna be too hard.

1417
01:22:34,636 --> 01:22:35,751
Tape it. Good. Come on. Tape it.

1418
01:22:35,836 --> 01:22:37,394
It's taping!

1419
01:22:47,316 --> 01:22:48,192
Jack.

1420
01:22:48,276 --> 01:22:49,072
Yeah?

1421
01:22:49,156 --> 01:22:50,066
Look.

1422
01:22:53,836 --> 01:22:55,269
Mac, fuel.

1423
01:22:55,356 --> 01:22:57,153
Jack, five minutes.

1424
01:22:57,236 --> 01:22:58,794
Not enough time. Run the tape.

1425
01:22:58,876 --> 01:22:59,945
We have to unload.

1426
01:23:00,036 --> 01:23:01,913
I only have a minute of tape.

1427
01:23:01,996 --> 01:23:02,826
Do it now.

1428
01:23:02,916 --> 01:23:06,591
I want you to make a tape and loop it
so that it runs over and over, OK?

1429
01:23:09,316 --> 01:23:11,068
All right, run it. Run it!

1430
01:23:11,156 --> 01:23:12,145
All right.

1431
01:23:12,236 --> 01:23:13,908
Tape's rolling.

1432
01:23:13,996 --> 01:23:16,226
(TV) We still have no live picture,...

1433
01:23:16,316 --> 01:23:19,626
..but reports are
that the bus continues to circle...

1434
01:23:19,716 --> 01:23:21,832
(toilet flushes)

1435
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:24,225
Everyone is safe for the moment.

1436
01:23:24,316 --> 01:23:28,229
Hard to imagine what's going
through their thoughts at this time.

1437
01:23:28,316 --> 01:23:30,068
Certainly, a sense of community...

1438
01:23:46,996 --> 01:23:50,545
Rig the steering wheel and the gas pedal.

1439
01:23:52,876 --> 01:23:55,470
All right, let's get them off.

1440
01:23:55,556 --> 01:23:57,512
OK, you, you, and you.

1441
01:23:58,716 --> 01:24:01,105
(TV) Police have just issued
a general statement,...

1442
01:24:01,196 --> 01:24:03,585
..which really doesn't tell us much more...

1443
01:24:03,676 --> 01:24:06,986
Grab my wrist. That's it. Good.

1444
01:24:07,076 --> 01:24:09,465
Come on. Look straight ahead.

1445
01:24:18,556 --> 01:24:19,591
Come on.

1446
01:24:22,316 --> 01:24:25,308
(TV) The bomber snuck in here
late last night...

1447
01:24:25,396 --> 01:24:26,351
Come on.

1448
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:27,710
It's OK.

1449
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:29,707
That's good, that's good.

1450
01:24:29,796 --> 01:24:31,024
Grab my wrist.

1451
01:24:31,116 --> 01:24:33,232
Take his hand.

1452
01:24:33,316 --> 01:24:35,307
That's it. Come on.

1453
01:24:40,156 --> 01:24:40,793
Let's go.

1454
01:24:45,156 --> 01:24:47,192
Come on, buddy. I got ya.

1455
01:24:47,276 --> 01:24:49,995
Give me your hand. Your hand.

1456
01:24:50,076 --> 01:24:51,634
Hold on. Hold on.

1457
01:24:51,716 --> 01:24:53,547
Grab my hand.

1458
01:24:53,636 --> 01:24:54,432
Don't look down.

1459
01:24:57,076 --> 01:24:57,872
Shit!

1460
01:24:59,076 --> 01:25:00,111
Jack!

1461
01:25:03,396 --> 01:25:04,715
Grab my hand!

1462
01:25:05,116 --> 01:25:06,310
Grab my hand!

1463
01:25:13,476 --> 01:25:16,149
Jack, I can't hold this any more.

1464
01:25:16,996 --> 01:25:19,829
Annie! You... hold on!

1465
01:25:22,796 --> 01:25:24,468
No, no!

1466
01:25:24,556 --> 01:25:25,511
No!

1467
01:25:27,236 --> 01:25:28,828
Hold it.

1468
01:25:35,596 --> 01:25:36,585
Oh, God.

1469
01:25:36,676 --> 01:25:39,144
Wedge down the gas pedal.

1470
01:25:41,956 --> 01:25:43,275
OK, I got it.

1471
01:25:54,636 --> 01:25:55,352
You got it?

1472
01:25:55,436 --> 01:25:56,312
Yeah.

1473
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,549
I got it. OK

1474
01:26:04,996 --> 01:26:06,395
OK, Annie, get on.

1475
01:26:06,476 --> 01:26:07,033
Oh, God.

1476
01:26:07,116 --> 01:26:08,549
Jack, I can't do this.

1477
01:26:09,636 --> 01:26:10,512
Let's go!

1478
01:26:10,596 --> 01:26:11,915
Shit.

1479
01:26:11,996 --> 01:26:12,906
Shit, shit.

1480
01:26:14,436 --> 01:26:15,186
Jack.

1481
01:26:15,276 --> 01:26:16,311
Shit!

1482
01:26:17,836 --> 01:26:19,349
Hold on.

1483
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:42,110
Shit!

1484
01:27:44,156 --> 01:27:46,272
(sirens approaching)

1485
01:27:49,796 --> 01:27:51,832
Are you all right?

1486
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:53,713
No.

1487
01:27:55,116 --> 01:27:56,629
It's OK.

1488
01:27:56,716 --> 01:27:58,308
It's OK. It's over.

1489
01:27:58,396 --> 01:28:00,990
It's over. You did it.

1490
01:28:01,076 --> 01:28:02,794
You did it.

1491
01:28:07,196 --> 01:28:09,027
Oh, I hate the airport.

1492
01:28:14,436 --> 01:28:17,314
You're not going to get mushy on me,
are you?

1493
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:20,315
Maybe.

1494
01:28:20,396 --> 01:28:22,148
I think I might.

1495
01:28:24,396 --> 01:28:28,833
I hope not because relationships that start
under intense circumstances never last.

1496
01:28:28,916 --> 01:28:29,428
Oh, yeah?

1497
01:28:29,516 --> 01:28:31,029
Yeah.
They've done extensive studying on this.

1498
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:34,872
Here comes the cavalry.

1499
01:28:49,716 --> 01:28:51,513
How ya doing?

1500
01:28:51,596 --> 01:28:53,109
We're OK.

1501
01:28:53,796 --> 01:28:55,388
I just might be a nice guy...

1502
01:28:55,476 --> 01:28:57,034
...and let you have the rest of the day off.

1503
01:28:58,236 --> 01:28:59,112
Oh, boy.

1504
01:28:59,196 --> 01:29:02,632
Mac, this is Annie.

1505
01:29:02,716 --> 01:29:05,469
Annie, meet Lieutenant McMahon.

1506
01:29:05,556 --> 01:29:06,511
How you doing?

1507
01:29:06,596 --> 01:29:08,154
OK.

1508
01:29:08,396 --> 01:29:09,829
This should take care of it.

1509
01:29:09,916 --> 01:29:11,235
Ow!

1510
01:29:11,316 --> 01:29:12,226
Watch it.

1511
01:29:12,316 --> 01:29:13,510
Sorry.

1512
01:29:13,596 --> 01:29:16,793
We're going to take you guys back
and have you checked out.

1513
01:29:16,876 --> 01:29:17,831
Lieutenant!

1514
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:20,146
It's him.

1515
01:29:20,236 --> 01:29:22,067
He wants to know
when he's gonna get his money.

1516
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:25,626
Son of a bitch. I'll tell him
what to do with his goddamn money.

1517
01:29:25,716 --> 01:29:28,105
He doesn't know it blew up.

1518
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:32,032
30 minutes.

1519
01:30:09,996 --> 01:30:11,588
I'll be right back.

1520
01:30:15,356 --> 01:30:17,153
All right, here's our target. Fox!

1521
01:30:17,236 --> 01:30:18,271
Yes, sir!

1522
01:30:18,356 --> 01:30:19,914
I want you in 4-1, you in 1-2. You're in 3.

1523
01:30:19,996 --> 01:30:20,985
Let's move it.

1524
01:30:21,076 --> 01:30:23,306
Are you sure the paint bomb
is in with the money?

1525
01:30:23,396 --> 01:30:24,226
It's done, sir.

1526
01:31:20,876 --> 01:31:24,232
Too bad, Jack.
You could've made a good cop.

1527
01:31:24,316 --> 01:31:26,910
(TV) The SWATvan
followed the bus to the airport.

1528
01:31:26,996 --> 01:31:28,634
OK.

1529
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:31,276
We'll report across the landing field
when we're set up.

1530
01:31:31,356 --> 01:31:32,391
We still have no live picture.

1531
01:31:32,476 --> 01:31:35,513
Reports are that the bus
continues to circle...

1532
01:31:35,596 --> 01:31:37,154
...inside LAX.

1533
01:31:37,236 --> 01:31:38,635
...potentially a disastrous situation.

1534
01:31:38,716 --> 01:31:41,708
It's definitely been defused to some extent.

1535
01:31:44,596 --> 01:31:45,346
No!

1536
01:31:45,716 --> 01:31:47,274
No!

1537
01:32:10,196 --> 01:32:10,833
Miss.

1538
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:11,348
Hmm?

1539
01:32:11,436 --> 01:32:13,154
You can't be this close.
You need to move back.

1540
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:14,635
No. Jack Traven said...

1541
01:32:14,716 --> 01:32:17,833
Jack Traven asked
that you be brought out of harm's way.

1542
01:32:17,916 --> 01:32:18,905
Just move right over here.

1543
01:32:18,996 --> 01:32:21,066
He's running a little late.

1544
01:32:21,156 --> 01:32:23,624
He's not late.

1545
01:32:23,716 --> 01:32:24,865
What?

1546
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:26,309
He's never late.

1547
01:32:26,396 --> 01:32:28,785
Well, that money hasn't moved.

1548
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:31,151
We got 200 eyes on that can,...

1549
01:32:31,236 --> 01:32:33,352
...a bird dog in the bag.
I'd say he's covered.

1550
01:32:38,716 --> 01:32:39,671
Turn it on.

1551
01:32:39,756 --> 01:32:41,428
What for? It hasn't moved.

1552
01:32:41,516 --> 01:32:42,392
Just do it.

1553
01:32:45,596 --> 01:32:47,746
(beeping)

1554
01:32:49,796 --> 01:32:51,115
Shit. It's moving.

1555
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:52,470
He's got the money.

1556
01:32:52,556 --> 01:32:53,466
Jack!

1557
01:33:03,316 --> 01:33:04,635
Shit!

1558
01:33:21,956 --> 01:33:22,593
Freeze!

1559
01:33:23,396 --> 01:33:24,306
Pop quiz,..

1560
01:33:24,396 --> 01:33:25,511
..asshole.

1561
01:33:25,596 --> 01:33:27,746
You have a hair trigger aimed at your head.

1562
01:33:27,836 --> 01:33:29,349
What do you do?

1563
01:33:29,876 --> 01:33:31,707
What do you do?

1564
01:33:31,796 --> 01:33:33,514
Turn around.

1565
01:33:34,156 --> 01:33:36,306
Turn around!

1566
01:33:54,356 --> 01:33:55,835
Oh, no.

1567
01:33:55,916 --> 01:33:57,588
I'm sorry.

1568
01:33:59,756 --> 01:34:00,984
Be prepared.

1569
01:34:01,076 --> 01:34:03,544
It's the boy Scout marching song.

1570
01:34:03,636 --> 01:34:05,433
What are you gonna do, Jack?

1571
01:34:05,516 --> 01:34:07,791
I don't think you can shoot her.

1572
01:34:08,556 --> 01:34:09,705
Let her go.

1573
01:34:11,116 --> 01:34:13,949
No, I don't think I'm gonna do that.

1574
01:34:14,036 --> 01:34:15,355
Fill it.

1575
01:34:15,436 --> 01:34:16,915
Now.

1576
01:34:19,756 --> 01:34:22,589
Well, I think Harry
would be very disappointed,...

1577
01:34:22,676 --> 01:34:24,314
...feeling that we're right back
where we started.

1578
01:34:24,836 --> 01:34:27,145
Let her go.
You don't need her. You have the money.

1579
01:34:27,236 --> 01:34:29,670
Take it and walk. Come on.

1580
01:34:29,756 --> 01:34:32,270
Just take it and walk. You don't need her.

1581
01:34:32,356 --> 01:34:34,426
Just take your goddamn money and walk!

1582
01:34:34,516 --> 01:34:38,191
Stay right there. I'll do it. I'll let go.

1583
01:34:38,276 --> 01:34:40,153
I'll let go. Oh, yeah.

1584
01:34:40,236 --> 01:34:42,989
You still don't get it. Do you, Jack?

1585
01:34:43,076 --> 01:34:45,067
Huh? The beauty of it.

1586
01:34:45,156 --> 01:34:48,228
A bomb is made to explode.

1587
01:34:48,956 --> 01:34:50,594
That's its meaning, its purpose.

1588
01:34:50,676 --> 01:34:53,349
Your life is empty because you spend it...

1589
01:34:53,436 --> 01:34:56,872
...trying to stop the bomb from becoming.

1590
01:34:56,956 --> 01:34:59,629
And for who? For what?

1591
01:34:59,716 --> 01:35:02,833
Do you know what a bomb is, Jack,...

1592
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:04,190
...that doesn't explode?

1593
01:35:04,276 --> 01:35:06,346
It is a cheap gold watch, buddy.

1594
01:35:08,516 --> 01:35:09,551
You're crazy.

1595
01:35:09,676 --> 01:35:11,189
You're fucking crazy.

1596
01:35:12,316 --> 01:35:13,590
Oh, no.

1597
01:35:13,676 --> 01:35:15,632
Poor people are crazy, Jack.

1598
01:35:15,716 --> 01:35:17,434
I'm eccentric.

1599
01:35:17,516 --> 01:35:18,790
Get the money. Let's go.

1600
01:35:18,876 --> 01:35:20,912
Come on! Let's go! Move it! Move it!

1601
01:35:20,996 --> 01:35:22,588
You stay! Move it!

1602
01:35:22,676 --> 01:35:23,188
Move it!

1603
01:35:23,276 --> 01:35:24,231
In the door.

1604
01:35:24,876 --> 01:35:26,275
In that door! Now!

1605
01:35:27,636 --> 01:35:29,433
Bye, Jack.

1606
01:35:29,876 --> 01:35:30,353
Punk.

1607
01:35:31,436 --> 01:35:32,630
(people screaming)

1608
01:35:32,716 --> 01:35:33,751
(shouting)

1609
01:35:33,836 --> 01:35:35,428
All right!

1610
01:35:37,156 --> 01:35:38,430
Get in there.

1611
01:35:38,516 --> 01:35:39,073
Go on.

1612
01:35:39,156 --> 01:35:40,430
Get in.

1613
01:35:41,156 --> 01:35:42,350
You get back in there!

1614
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:44,996
You get this train moving! Go on!

1615
01:35:45,076 --> 01:35:46,555
Are these seats taken?

1616
01:35:47,956 --> 01:35:49,025
No. Go.

1617
01:35:49,116 --> 01:35:51,949
All aboard. Doors will be closing.

1618
01:35:52,036 --> 01:35:54,345
Come on. Back over here.
Hands around the pole.

1619
01:35:54,436 --> 01:35:56,904
All aboard. Doors will be closing.

1620
01:36:14,596 --> 01:36:15,108
No!

1621
01:36:15,196 --> 01:36:16,390
Damn.

1622
01:36:35,276 --> 01:36:37,153
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1623
01:36:42,836 --> 01:36:44,667
Please report, Westbound 501.

1624
01:36:44,756 --> 01:36:45,905
What is your position?

1625
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:53,394
Westbound 501, please check in.

1626
01:36:53,476 --> 01:36:55,671
Westbound 501.

1627
01:36:57,676 --> 01:36:59,792
We have police orders
to return to the station.

1628
01:36:59,876 --> 01:37:00,911
Do you copy?

1629
01:37:00,996 --> 01:37:01,872
You have to hold this.

1630
01:37:01,956 --> 01:37:04,868
It's like a grenade.
You have to help me now. Come on, hold it.

1631
01:37:04,956 --> 01:37:05,866
Don't let it go.

1632
01:37:06,356 --> 01:37:07,345
Huh?

1633
01:37:07,436 --> 01:37:08,391
I'm counting on you.

1634
01:37:08,476 --> 01:37:09,226
Do you copy?

1635
01:37:09,836 --> 01:37:10,552
Hey!

1636
01:37:11,316 --> 01:37:12,226
I'll take it from here.

1637
01:37:12,316 --> 01:37:13,192
No!

1638
01:37:17,236 --> 01:37:19,306
No! No!

1639
01:37:20,476 --> 01:37:21,670
(whimpering)

1640
01:37:21,756 --> 01:37:22,233
Uh-oh.

1641
01:37:22,316 --> 01:37:23,635
Uh-oh. Wait.

1642
01:37:23,716 --> 01:37:24,751
No! No!

1643
01:37:24,836 --> 01:37:26,872
Maybe you'd better
let me have this after all.

1644
01:37:26,956 --> 01:37:28,309
I'm afraid you're a bit hysterical...

1645
01:37:28,396 --> 01:37:30,512
..and you might let this go a might early.

1646
01:37:33,436 --> 01:37:36,394
Hey! Hey, buckaroo!

1647
01:37:36,476 --> 01:37:38,831
It's not 'cause you're a woman, all right?

1648
01:37:38,916 --> 01:37:40,668
Hey, it's all right.

1649
01:37:40,756 --> 01:37:43,065
Looks like we're all alone.

1650
01:37:43,156 --> 01:37:45,465
Look, you won. OK?
You beat Jack. You beat everybody.

1651
01:37:45,556 --> 01:37:48,070
Just throw me offthe train. I don't care.

1652
01:37:48,156 --> 01:37:51,353
This stick,.... huh? Works on a remote.

1653
01:37:51,436 --> 01:37:52,471
When you explode,...

1654
01:37:52,556 --> 01:37:56,151
...that's where they'll come,
but it's not where I'll be.

1655
01:37:56,236 --> 01:37:58,067
I have a different plan.

1656
01:37:58,156 --> 01:38:01,785
Mess like that,...
they don't even count body parts.

1657
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:03,468
Gives me more time.

1658
01:38:04,036 --> 01:38:05,833
It's not gonna hurt, Annie.

1659
01:38:12,916 --> 01:38:14,952
(bell ringing)

1660
01:38:16,156 --> 01:38:16,952
Jeez!

1661
01:38:18,396 --> 01:38:19,511
(metal clanks)

1662
01:38:19,596 --> 01:38:20,949
Hey, Jack, is that you?

1663
01:38:24,116 --> 01:38:26,755
He's so persistent.
He always gets his man.

1664
01:38:27,836 --> 01:38:31,033
Wouldn't be able
to interest you in a bribe, would l?

1665
01:38:31,116 --> 01:38:34,631
I've got, uh, plenty to go around.

1666
01:38:38,356 --> 01:38:40,267
My money.

1667
01:38:45,516 --> 01:38:47,347
You bastard!

1668
01:38:47,436 --> 01:38:48,312
How does that feel?

1669
01:38:50,196 --> 01:38:51,948
You like that, huh?

1670
01:38:52,036 --> 01:38:52,946
You like it,...

1671
01:38:53,036 --> 01:38:53,707
...you bastard?

1672
01:38:57,836 --> 01:38:58,905
My money!

1673
01:39:06,156 --> 01:39:07,066
Shit!

1674
01:39:08,076 --> 01:39:09,031
You!

1675
01:39:09,116 --> 01:39:11,311
I'm coming for you, Jack!

1676
01:39:29,236 --> 01:39:31,511
You know you're finished, kid!

1677
01:39:39,716 --> 01:39:41,672
Hey, I'll drop the stick, boy. You want that?

1678
01:39:43,036 --> 01:39:43,627
I got you.

1679
01:39:43,716 --> 01:39:45,229
I'm gonna get you.

1680
01:39:46,636 --> 01:39:47,864
Oh, yes!

1681
01:39:49,076 --> 01:39:50,031
Yes!

1682
01:39:52,876 --> 01:39:54,070
Yes!

1683
01:39:59,476 --> 01:40:00,352
(groan)

1684
01:40:00,436 --> 01:40:02,267
What do you do, Jack?

1685
01:40:02,356 --> 01:40:04,665
What do you do?
You're so smart. Right, Jack?

1686
01:40:04,756 --> 01:40:06,348
Piece of shit!

1687
01:40:06,436 --> 01:40:09,394
I'm the guy with a plan
'cause I'm smarter than you.

1688
01:40:09,476 --> 01:40:11,307
I'm smarter than you.

1689
01:40:15,036 --> 01:40:16,071
(grunt)

1690
01:40:19,236 --> 01:40:20,032
(bell ringing)

1691
01:40:25,316 --> 01:40:26,715
Yeah.

1692
01:40:28,116 --> 01:40:29,788
But I'm taller.

1693
01:40:31,516 --> 01:40:32,665
Jack.

1694
01:40:33,516 --> 01:40:34,710
Jack!

1695
01:40:34,836 --> 01:40:36,792
Oh, God! I thought you were dead.

1696
01:40:37,316 --> 01:40:38,669
Jack. Where did...

1697
01:40:38,756 --> 01:40:39,632
Here.

1698
01:40:39,716 --> 01:40:40,626
Turn around.

1699
01:40:40,716 --> 01:40:41,273
Where's Payne?

1700
01:40:43,116 --> 01:40:44,231
He lost his head.

1701
01:40:46,356 --> 01:40:48,267
Oh, God.

1702
01:40:48,356 --> 01:40:50,347
Let's take this off, shall we?

1703
01:40:50,436 --> 01:40:52,427
Yes. Let's take this off.

1704
01:40:52,516 --> 01:40:54,074
Ohh.

1705
01:40:55,116 --> 01:40:56,390
Take it off.

1706
01:40:56,476 --> 01:40:57,147
Hello?

1707
01:40:57,716 --> 01:40:58,228
Hello?

1708
01:40:58,316 --> 01:40:59,431
Does anyone copy?

1709
01:40:59,516 --> 01:41:00,392
(static)

1710
01:41:00,476 --> 01:41:01,511
Jack, this is Mac.

1711
01:41:01,596 --> 01:41:02,824
Can you hear me?

1712
01:41:02,916 --> 01:41:04,827
Jack, if you're there,...

1713
01:41:04,916 --> 01:41:06,588
...you've got to stop the train.

1714
01:41:07,596 --> 01:41:09,393
The track isn't finished.

1715
01:41:09,476 --> 01:41:10,272
Mac, I copy.

1716
01:41:10,356 --> 01:41:12,074
(signal breaking up) ...not finished.

1717
01:41:12,156 --> 01:41:13,475
Mac.

1718
01:41:13,916 --> 01:41:15,144
If someone can hear me...

1719
01:41:15,236 --> 01:41:15,748
Mac,...

1720
01:41:15,836 --> 01:41:16,552
...can you hear me?

1721
01:41:16,636 --> 01:41:17,546
Try the emergency brake.

1722
01:41:18,796 --> 01:41:19,945
Jack, do you copy?

1723
01:41:20,316 --> 01:41:22,307
Jack...

1724
01:41:22,396 --> 01:41:23,624
Nothing works!

1725
01:41:23,716 --> 01:41:25,547
Annie, you won't believe this.

1726
01:41:25,636 --> 01:41:26,671
What?

1727
01:41:27,076 --> 01:41:28,714
We have to jump.

1728
01:41:29,156 --> 01:41:30,828
You can't stop it?

1729
01:41:34,236 --> 01:41:38,673
Well, um, OK, undo me,
and I'd love to go with you. Come on.

1730
01:41:40,236 --> 01:41:41,351
I don't have a key.

1731
01:41:41,436 --> 01:41:42,312
What?

1732
01:41:42,396 --> 01:41:44,466
I don't have the key.

1733
01:42:03,956 --> 01:42:05,025
Shit.

1734
01:42:17,916 --> 01:42:18,871
(sob)

1735
01:42:21,876 --> 01:42:24,470
You got to get off...
You got to get off the train.

1736
01:42:25,676 --> 01:42:27,029
Please! This track dead-ends.

1737
01:42:27,116 --> 01:42:28,549
You got to get off this train.

1738
01:42:28,636 --> 01:42:29,864
This is crazy.

1739
01:42:29,956 --> 01:42:31,355
There's a curve ahead.

1740
01:42:31,436 --> 01:42:32,664
I'm gonna speed it up,...

1741
01:42:32,756 --> 01:42:34,986
...make it jump the track.

1742
01:42:35,076 --> 01:42:36,589
This is really stupid, Jack.

1743
01:42:36,676 --> 01:42:38,553
Jack, please. You can still jump.

1744
01:42:39,036 --> 01:42:39,991
Jack, please.

1745
01:42:40,396 --> 01:42:41,112
Please,...

1746
01:42:41,196 --> 01:42:41,867
...Jack?

1747
01:42:47,716 --> 01:42:49,627
(engine speeds up)

1748
01:43:35,756 --> 01:43:37,075
OK,...

1749
01:43:37,156 --> 01:43:39,306
...we have to start here.

1750
01:43:57,196 --> 01:43:58,424
(train approaches)

1751
01:43:58,516 --> 01:43:59,505
Holy shit!

1752
01:43:59,596 --> 01:44:01,314
What the hell is that?

1753
01:44:05,996 --> 01:44:07,065
Back off!

1754
01:44:32,996 --> 01:44:34,065
(metal scraping metal)

1755
01:45:15,516 --> 01:45:18,269
I can't believe he hit my van.

1756
01:45:18,356 --> 01:45:20,233
Come on. It's all right.

1757
01:45:20,316 --> 01:45:21,226
Unreal.

1758
01:45:23,876 --> 01:45:25,832
You didn't leave me.

1759
01:45:25,916 --> 01:45:27,508
I can't believe it.

1760
01:45:30,716 --> 01:45:32,149
You didn't leave me.

1761
01:45:32,236 --> 01:45:35,114
Didn't have anywhere to be just then.

1762
01:45:40,156 --> 01:45:41,748
Check it out.

1763
01:45:47,876 --> 01:45:49,753
I have to warn you.

1764
01:45:49,836 --> 01:45:51,155
I've heard relationships...

1765
01:45:51,236 --> 01:45:53,830
...based on intense experiences never work.

1766
01:45:54,836 --> 01:45:55,666
OK,...

1767
01:45:56,476 --> 01:45:59,946
...we'll have to base it on sex, then.

1768
01:46:00,036 --> 01:46:02,231
Whatever you say, ma'am.

1769
01:46:02,316 --> 01:46:03,465
(laughing)

1770
01:46:57,036 --> 01:46:59,027
# Stemmin'from a nightmare

1771
01:46:59,116 --> 01:47:01,676
# ln the middle of the road

01:47:01,756 --> 01:47:04,554
# Hell's no place for sleepin'

1773
01:47:04,636 --> 01:47:07,150

01:47:37,316 --> 01:47:39,591
