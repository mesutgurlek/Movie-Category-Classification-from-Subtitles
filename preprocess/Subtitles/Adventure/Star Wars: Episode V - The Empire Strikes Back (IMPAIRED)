do you read me?

<i>Loud and clear, kid.
What's up?</i>

4
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:41,385
I finished
my circle.

5

I don't pick up
any life readings.

on this ice cube...</i>

7

<i>to fill a space cruiser.</i>

8

<i>Sensors are placed.
I'm going back.</i>

9
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:50,322
Right.
I'll see you shortly.

10
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:52,293
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

11

No sign of life
out there, General.

Commander Skywalker
reported in yet?

No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

27

With all the meteor activity
in this system...

to spot approaching ships.

I can't stay anymore.

a price on my head.

A death mark's
not an easy thing to live with.

35

You're a good fighter, Solo.

36

decided to stay.

Well, the bounty hunter
we ran into in Ord Mantell...

46
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:13,101

am I supposed to know?

Come on!

00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:29,916
You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about me.

Yes! You're
a great help to us.

Am I? Then why are
you following me?

Afraid I was gonna leave
without giving you a good-bye kiss?

65
00:06:44,902 --> 00:06:46,301
I'd just as soon
kiss a Wookiee!

66

I can arrange that.

67

You could use
a good kiss!

68
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:54,305
I didn't ask you to turn on
the thermal heater.

69

I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

Not likely.
Are the speeders ready?

Uh, not yet. We're having trouble

Come on,
give me a sign here.

165
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,919
Not much time.

166
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,253
Ben.

167
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:24,589
Ben.

168
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:29,924
Hang on, kid.

169
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:33,194
Dagobah system.

170
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:34,271
Whew!

171
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:37,306
This may smell bad, kid...

172
00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:39,376
Yoda.

173
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:41,137
But it'll keep you warm...

174
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:43,509
till I get the shelter up.

175
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:46,105
Ben... Dagobah...

176
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:47,878
Ahhh!

177
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:53,287
Ah! I thought they
smelled bad on the outside!

178
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:38,624
Echo Base, I've got something.

179
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:41,796
Not much, but it could be a life-form.

180
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:48,176
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

181
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,179
This is Rogue Two.

182
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:52,715
This is Rogue Two.

183
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:56,445
Captain Solo,
do you copy?

184
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:05,126
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

185
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:07,663
This is Rogue Two.

186
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:09,164
<i>Han: Good morning.</i>

187
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:11,632
<i>Nice of you guys
to drop by.</i>

188
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:14,101
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

189
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:15,603
I've found them.

190
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:17,503
Repeat, I've found them.

191
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:49,102
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

192
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:50,434
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

193
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,439
Thanks, 3PO.

194

<i>[Beep Blip]</i>

195
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:54,272
R2 expresses
his relief also.

196
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:57,142
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

197
00:16:57,247 --> 00:16:58,646
You look strong enough...

198
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:00,649
to pull the ears
off a gundark.

199
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:02,150
Thanks to you.

200
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:04,846
That's two
you owe me, junior.

201
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:06,513
Well, Your Worship...

202
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:09,456
looks like you managed to keep me
around for a little while longer.

203
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,118
I had nothing
to do with it.

204
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:12,991
General Rieekan
thinks it's dangerous...

205
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:14,257
for any ships
to leave the system...

206
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:15,696
until we've activated
the energy field.

207
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,699
That's a good story.

208
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:18,995
<i>I think you just can't bear...</i>

209
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,731
to let a gorgeous guy like me
out of your sight.

210
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,138
I don't know where you get
your delusions, laser brain.

211
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:26,903
Hah hah hah!

212
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:30,145
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

213
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:33,648
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

214
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:36,219
She expressed her
true feelings for me.

215
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,651
My...

216
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:40,724
Why, you stuck-up,
half-witted...

217
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:43,384
scruffy-looking
nerf herder!

218
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:46,554
Who's scruffy-looking?

219
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:50,099
I must have hit
pretty close to the mark...

220
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:51,166
I must have hit
pretty close to the mark...

221
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:53,293
to get her all riled up
like that, huh, kid?

222
00:17:56,774 --> 00:18:00,232
Well, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

<i>Headquarters personnel,

<i>Headquarters personnel,

225
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:15,781
Take it easy.

226
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:18,259
Excuse us,
please.

227
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:23,292
Princess,
we have a visitor.

228
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,063
Picked up something outside
the base's Zone 12 moving east.

229
00:18:27,171 --> 00:18:28,297
It's metal.

230
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:29,372
Then it couldn't be
one of those creatures.

231
00:18:29,473 --> 00:18:31,134
Could be a speeder,
one of ours.

232
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:32,469
No.

233
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:33,634
Wait.

234
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:36,372
There's something
very weak coming through.

235
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,608
[Radio Static]

236
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:42,810
Sir, I'm fluent in six million
forms of communication.

237
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,650
This signal is not used
by the Alliance.

238
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:47,815
It could be
an imperial code.

239
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:53,058
It isn't friendly,
whatever it is.

240
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:55,063
Come on, Chewie,
let's check it out.

241
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:58,396
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

242
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:15,879
Grrr!

243
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,496
Gahhh!

244
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,598
<i>I'm afraid
there's not much left.</i>

245
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:35,603
What was it?

246
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:37,139
<i>Droid of some kind.</i>

247
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,141
<i>I didn't hit it that hard.
Must've had a self-destruct.</i>

248
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,006
An imperial probe droid.

249
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:44,103
<i>It's a good bet the Empire
knows we're here.</i>

250
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,182
We'd better start
the evacuation.

251
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:32,357
Admiral.

252
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:33,861
Yes, Captain?

253
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:36,159
I think we've got
something, sir.

254
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:38,325
The report
is only a fragment...

255
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:39,993
from a probe droid
in the Hoth system...

256
00:20:40,103 --> 00:20:41,536
but it's the best lead we've had.

257
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:44,471
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

258
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:45,667
I want proof,
not leads.

259
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:47,676
The visuals indicate
life readings.

260
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:48,676
It could mean anything.

261
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,076
If we followed up
every lead...

262
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,511
But, sir...

263
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:53,173
the Hoth system is supposed to be
devoid of humans.

264
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:54,477
You've found something?

265
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:55,677
Yes, my lord.

266
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:00,453
That's it.
The rebels are there.

267
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:05,017
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

268
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:06,026
It could be smugglers...

269
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:07,926
That is the system.

270
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:10,431
And I'm sure Skywalker
is with them.

271
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:13,526
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

272
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:15,832
General Veers,
prepare your men.

273
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:17,338
Admiral.

274
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:26,374
Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders.

275
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:28,041
As soon as each transport is loaded...

276
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:30,278
evacuation control will give clearance
for immediate launch.

277
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:31,354
Right, sir.

278
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,551
All right!
That's it.

279
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,684
Try it.

280
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:42,623
Oh! Turn it off!
Turn it off!

281
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,894
Turn it off!

282
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:48,665
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47 s.

283
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:49,670
Forget
the heavy equipment.

284
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:50,967
There's plenty of time...

285
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:52,666
to get the smaller modules
on the transports.

286
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:53,674
Take care, sir.

287
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:54,744
Thanks.

288
00:21:57,781 --> 00:22:00,909
Chewie, take care
of yourself, O. K?

289
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:06,353
O.K., O. K!

290
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,391
Hi, kid.

291
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:10,551
There's got to be
a reason for it.

292
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:12,026
Check it
at the other end.

293
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:13,289
Wait a second.

294
00:22:14,464 --> 00:22:15,829
You all right?

295
00:22:15,932 --> 00:22:17,229
Yeah.

296
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,938
Be careful.

297
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:27,772
You, too.

298
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:35,683
General, there's a fleet
of Stardestroyers...

299
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:38,687
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

300
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:41,690
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

301
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,693
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

302
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:46,262
Prepare for ground assault.

303
00:23:00,277 --> 00:23:02,177
What is it, General?

304
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,871
My lord, the fleet has moved out
of light speed.

305
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,141
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

306
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:08,649
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

307
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:11,380
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

308
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:14,150
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

309
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:17,158
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

310
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,160
He... He felt surprise
was wiser.

311
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:21,753
He is as clumsy
as he is stupid.

312
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:25,164
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

313
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:26,735
Yes, my lord.

314
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:35,335
Lord Vader.

315
00:23:35,445 --> 00:23:37,675
The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to...

316
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:39,408
Aaugh!

317
00:23:39,516 --> 00:23:43,179
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

318
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:44,480
Captain Piett.

319
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:46,180
Yes, my lord?

320
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:49,281
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

321
00:23:49,392 --> 00:23:52,361
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

322
00:23:52,462 --> 00:23:55,693
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

323
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,198
Thank you,
Lord Vader.

324
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,767
[Gagging]

325
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:02,137
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

326
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:05,003
The heavy transport ships will leave
as soon as they're loaded.

327
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:07,269
Only two fighter escorts
per ship.

328
00:24:07,377 --> 00:24:10,107
The energy shield can only be opened
for a short time...

329
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:12,647
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

330
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:15,149
Two fighters against
a Stardestroyer?

331
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:17,652
The ion cannon
will fire several shots...

332
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:19,255
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

333
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,756
To make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

334
00:24:20,857 --> 00:24:22,950
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

335
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:25,152
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

336
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:26,661
Understood?

337
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:28,162
Good luck.

338
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:30,165
O.K. Everybody
to your stations.

339
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:31,461
Let's go.

340
00:24:48,585 --> 00:24:51,952
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

341
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:53,647
Prepare to open shield.

342
00:24:59,462 --> 00:25:01,692
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

343
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:03,857
Good. Our first catch
of the day.

344
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:07,502
Stand by, ion control.

345
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,028
Fire.

Feeling all right, sir?

349
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:41,398
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

350
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:44,564
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

351
00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:46,801
I know what you mean.

352
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:06,287
Echo Station
Three-T-Eight.

353
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:08,125
We've spotted
imperial walkers.

354

We're on our way.

357
00:26:40,864 --> 00:26:42,855
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

358
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:45,127

I'm not set.

359

All right.
I'm coming in.

362

Hobbie,
you still with me?

363
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:24,532
That armor's too strong
for blasters.

364
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:29,172
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

365
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,045
Go for the legs. It might be
our only chance of stopping them.

366
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:35,083
All right.
Stand by, Dak.

367
00:27:35,185 --> 00:27:38,018
Oh, Luke, we've got a malfunction
in fire control.

368
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:40,112
I'll have to cut in
the auxiliary.

369
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:42,817
Just hang on.
Hang on, Dak.

370
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:45,053
Get ready to fire
that tow cable.

Dak!

374
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:18,527
Yes, Lord Vader, I've reached
the main power generators.

375
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:20,095
The shield will be down
in moments.

376

You may start your landing.

we can protect
two transports at a time.

396

It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

Sir, the possibility of successfully

00:48:23,498 --> 00:48:24,556
But we can't,
so why don't you...

654
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:26,566
Cannot get your ship out.
Hee hee hee!

655
00:48:26,668 --> 00:48:27,999
Hey, get out of there!

656
00:48:28,103 --> 00:48:29,434
Ah!

657
00:48:29,538 --> 00:48:31,563
No! Ooh!

658
00:48:31,673 --> 00:48:34,005
Hey, you could
have broken this.

659
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:36,236
Don't do that.

660
00:48:38,046 --> 00:48:39,570
Oh!

661
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:41,239
[Chuckling]

662
00:48:43,919 --> 00:48:46,444
[Groaning]

663
00:48:46,555 --> 00:48:48,523
You're making a mess.

664
00:48:49,558 --> 00:48:50,456
[Chuckling]

665
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,356
Hey, give me that!

666
00:48:52,461 --> 00:48:55,021
Mine, or I will
help you not.

667
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:56,927
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

668
00:48:57,032 --> 00:48:59,057
I'm gonna need it
to get out of this slimy mudhole.

669
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:00,566
Mudhole? Slimy?

670
00:49:00,669 --> 00:49:03,297
My home this is...

671
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:05,873
Wha... Mmm!

672
00:49:05,974 --> 00:49:07,566
R2, let him have it.

673
00:49:09,544 --> 00:49:11,910
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

674
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:13,072
R2!

675
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,748
Now, will you move along,
little fellow?

676
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:19,514
We've got a lot
of work to do.

677
00:49:19,621 --> 00:49:21,088
No! No, no!

678
00:49:21,189 --> 00:49:24,590
Stay and help you I will...
find your friend.

679
00:49:24,693 --> 00:49:26,991
I'm not looking
for a friend.

680
00:49:27,095 --> 00:49:28,357
I'm looking
for a Jedi master.

681
00:49:28,463 --> 00:49:32,729
Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.

682
00:49:32,834 --> 00:49:34,301
You seek Yoda.

683
00:49:34,403 --> 00:49:35,563
You know him?

684
00:49:35,671 --> 00:49:39,072
Mmmm.
Take you to him I will.

685
00:49:39,174 --> 00:49:43,770
Yes, yes, but now
we must eat. Come.

686
00:49:43,879 --> 00:49:45,506
Good food.

687
00:49:45,614 --> 00:49:46,979
Come.

688
00:49:56,124 --> 00:49:57,989
Come, come.

689
00:49:59,361 --> 00:50:04,162
R2... stay and watch
after the camp.

690
00:50:17,245 --> 00:50:19,907
Oh! Where is R2
when I need him?

691
00:50:20,015 --> 00:50:23,075
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

692
00:50:23,185 --> 00:50:24,846
but it has the most
peculiar dialect.

693
00:50:24,953 --> 00:50:26,978
I believe, sir, it says
that the power coupling...

694
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:28,488
on the negative axis
has been polarized.

695
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,081
I'm afraid you'll have
to replace it.

696
00:50:31,193 --> 00:50:34,424
Well, of course I'll
have to replace it.

697
00:50:34,529 --> 00:50:36,019
Here!

698
00:50:36,131 --> 00:50:37,860
And, Chewie...

699
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:42,195
I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling.

700
00:51:03,325 --> 00:51:07,261
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

701
00:51:07,362 --> 00:51:09,694
Would you please
stop calling me that?

702
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:11,891
Sure, Leia.

703
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,025
You make it
so difficult sometimes.

704
00:51:14,136 --> 00:51:16,070
I do. I really do.

705
00:51:16,171 --> 00:51:19,072
You could be a little nicer, though.

706
00:51:19,174 --> 00:51:22,041
Come on, admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

707
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:26,045
Occasionally... maybe...

708
00:51:26,148 --> 00:51:28,708
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.

709
00:51:28,817 --> 00:51:30,580
Scoundrel?

710
00:51:30,685 --> 00:51:32,175
Scoundrel?

711
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:37,048
I like the sound
of that.

712
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:38,023
Stop that.

713
00:51:38,126 --> 00:51:39,855
Stop what?

714
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:42,020
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

715
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,530
My hands are dirty, too.
What are you afraid of?

716
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:45,793
Afraid?

717
00:51:45,901 --> 00:51:47,801
You're trembling.

718
00:51:47,903 --> 00:51:49,564
I'm not trembling.

719
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:53,835
You like me because
I'm a scoundrel.

720
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:55,967
There aren't enough
scoundrels in your life.

721
00:51:56,077 --> 00:51:58,568
I happen to like nice men.

722
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,647
I'm a nice man.

723
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:01,443
No, you're not. You're...

724
00:52:04,085 --> 00:52:05,177
Sir, sir!

725
00:52:05,287 --> 00:52:07,949
I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

726
00:52:10,192 --> 00:52:11,420
Thank you.

727
00:52:11,526 --> 00:52:12,891
Thank you very much.

728
00:52:12,994 --> 00:52:14,723
Oh, you're perfectly
welcome, sir.

729
00:52:20,802 --> 00:52:24,033
And that was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.

730
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:25,663
Considering the amount of
damage we've sustained...

731
00:52:25,774 --> 00:52:26,968
they must have been
destroyed.

732
00:52:27,075 --> 00:52:29,771
No, Captain.
They're alive.

733
00:52:29,878 --> 00:52:31,812
I want every ship
available...

734
00:52:31,913 --> 00:52:33,471
to sweep
the asteroid field...

735
00:52:33,582 --> 00:52:34,879
until they are found.

736
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:40,184
Lord Vader.

737
00:52:40,288 --> 00:52:42,188
Yes, Admiral.
What is it?

738
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,689
The emperor
commands you...

739
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:45,191
to make contact
with him.

740
00:52:45,293 --> 00:52:47,124
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

741
00:52:47,229 --> 00:52:50,130
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

742
00:52:50,232 --> 00:52:51,699
Yes, my lord.

743
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,643
What is thy bidding,
my master?

744
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:14,447
There is a great
disturbance...

745
00:53:14,556 --> 00:53:16,820
in the Force.

746
00:53:16,925 --> 00:53:19,257
I have felt it.

747
00:53:19,361 --> 00:53:21,852
We have
a new enemy...

748
00:53:21,963 --> 00:53:25,990
the young rebel
who destroyed the Death Star.

749
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:29,434
I have no doubt
this boy...

750
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:33,770
is the offspring
of Anakin Skywalker.

751
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:36,139
How is that possible?

752
00:53:36,244 --> 00:53:39,736
Search your feelings,
Lord Vader.

753
00:53:39,848 --> 00:53:42,976
You will know it
to be true.

754
00:53:43,084 --> 00:53:45,552
He could destroy us.

755
00:53:45,654 --> 00:53:47,849
He's just a boy.

756
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:50,356
Obi-Wan can no longer
help him.

757
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:54,121
The Force
is strong with him.

758
00:53:55,463 --> 00:53:57,488
The son of Skywalker...

759
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,363
must not become a Jedi.

760
00:54:00,468 --> 00:54:02,698
If he could be turned...

761
00:54:02,804 --> 00:54:05,637
he would become
a powerful ally.

762
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,300
Yes.

763
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:13,507
He would be
a great asset.

764
00:54:13,615 --> 00:54:15,981
Can it be done?

765
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:19,986
He will join us
or die, master.

766
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:37,936
Look,
I'm sure it's delicious.

767
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:40,940
I just don't understand
why we can't see Yoda now.

768
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:41,940
Patience!

769
00:54:42,043 --> 00:54:43,442
For the Jedi...

770
00:54:43,545 --> 00:54:45,342
it is time
to eat as well.

771
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:47,347
Hmm? Heh heh.

772
00:54:47,449 --> 00:54:50,612
Eat, eat.

773
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:51,777
Hot!

774
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:01,486
Good food!
Mmm, good, hmm?

775
00:55:01,596 --> 00:55:04,656
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

776
00:55:04,766 --> 00:55:06,461
Not far.
Yoda not far.

777
00:55:06,568 --> 00:55:09,765
Patience. Soon you
will be with him.

778
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,832
Root leaf.

779
00:55:13,942 --> 00:55:15,307
I cook.

780
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:19,813
Why wish you
become Jedi? Hmm? Hmm?

781
00:55:19,914 --> 00:55:22,041
Mostly because of
my father, I guess.

782
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:23,378
Ah, father.

783
00:55:23,485 --> 00:55:25,885
Powerful Jedi was he.

784
00:55:25,987 --> 00:55:27,887
Hee hee.
Mmm, powerful Jedi.

785
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:29,650
Oh, come on.

786
00:55:29,758 --> 00:55:31,225
How could you
know my father?

787
00:55:31,326 --> 00:55:33,055
You don't
even know who I am.

788
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:35,061
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

789
00:55:35,163 --> 00:55:36,926
We're wasting our time!

790
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:39,864
I cannot teach him.

791
00:55:39,968 --> 00:55:42,368
The boy
has no patience.

792
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:45,098
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

793
00:55:45,206 --> 00:55:46,264
Hmm...

794
00:55:49,878 --> 00:55:52,346
Much anger in him...

795
00:55:52,447 --> 00:55:54,347
like his father.

796
00:55:54,449 --> 00:55:58,180
<i>Was I any different
when you taught me?</i>

797
00:55:59,587 --> 00:56:01,350
No.

798
00:56:01,456 --> 00:56:03,321
He is not ready.

799
00:56:03,425 --> 00:56:04,687
Yoda.

800
00:56:06,928 --> 00:56:08,293
I am ready.

801
00:56:08,396 --> 00:56:10,660
Ben...
I can be a Jedi.

802
00:56:10,765 --> 00:56:12,699
Ben, tell him I'm...

803
00:56:12,801 --> 00:56:14,200
Ready, are you?

804
00:56:14,302 --> 00:56:16,600
What know you ready?

805
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:20,072
For 800 years
have I trained Jedi.

806
00:56:20,175 --> 00:56:22,700
My own counsel will I keep...

807
00:56:22,811 --> 00:56:25,644
on who is to be trained.

808
00:56:25,747 --> 00:56:30,377
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment, hmm?

809
00:56:30,485 --> 00:56:32,350
The most serious mind.

810
00:56:34,122 --> 00:56:38,183
This one a long time
have I watched.

811
00:56:38,293 --> 00:56:41,285
All his life
has he looked away...

812
00:56:41,396 --> 00:56:44,456
to the future,
to the horizon.

813
00:56:44,566 --> 00:56:48,127
Never his mind
on where he was...

814
00:56:48,236 --> 00:56:49,328
hmm?

815
00:56:49,437 --> 00:56:51,371
What he was doing.

816
00:56:51,473 --> 00:56:53,031
Hmph!

817
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:54,199

Yes! A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

But beware

No, no.
There is no why.

01:21:07,275 --> 01:21:08,242
Hey, remember...

1149
01:21:08,343 --> 01:21:10,436
you lost her to me
fair and square.

1150
01:21:10,545 --> 01:21:12,706
And how you doin',
Chewbacca?

1151
01:21:12,814 --> 01:21:13,940
Gahh!

1152
01:21:14,049 --> 01:21:15,448
You still hanging around
with this loser?

1153
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:18,212
Gahhh!

1154
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,652
Hello.
What have we here?

1155
01:21:20,756 --> 01:21:22,053
Welcome,
I'm Lando Calrissian.

1156
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:24,955
I'm the administrator
of this facility.

1157
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,925
And who might you be?

1158
01:21:27,028 --> 01:21:28,154
Leia.

1159
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:29,821
Welcome, Leia.

1160
01:21:32,968 --> 01:21:36,369
All right, all right,
you old smoothie.

1161
01:21:36,471 --> 01:21:39,872
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1162
01:21:39,975 --> 01:21:41,442
My facilities
are at your...

1163
01:21:41,543 --> 01:21:42,840
Well, really!

1164
01:21:42,944 --> 01:21:44,809
<i>What's wrong
with the Falcon?</i>

1165
01:21:44,913 --> 01:21:46,141
Hyperdrive.

1166
01:21:46,248 --> 01:21:48,148
I'll get my people
to work on her.

1167
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:49,911
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

1168
01:21:50,018 --> 01:21:52,919
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

1169
01:21:53,021 --> 01:21:56,149
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

1170
01:21:56,258 --> 01:21:57,623
Not as well as I'd like.

1171
01:21:57,726 --> 01:21:59,887
We're a small outpost
and not very self-sufficient.

1172
01:21:59,995 --> 01:22:01,394
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

1173
01:22:01,496 --> 01:22:02,895
I've had labor difficulties.

1174
01:22:02,998 --> 01:22:04,625
Ha ha ha!

1175
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:06,291
What's so funny?

1176
01:22:06,401 --> 01:22:07,891
You. Listen to you.

1177
01:22:08,003 --> 01:22:10,028
You sound like
a businessman...

1178
01:22:10,138 --> 01:22:11,537
a responsible leader.

1179
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,835
Who'd have
thought that, huh?

1180
01:22:13,942 --> 01:22:16,502
Seeing you brings back
a few things.

1181
01:22:16,611 --> 01:22:17,669
Yeah.

1182
01:22:17,779 --> 01:22:19,542
Yeah, I'm responsible
these days.

1183
01:22:19,648 --> 01:22:21,639
It's the price you pay...

1184
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:23,650
for being successful.

1185
01:22:25,954 --> 01:22:28,422
Ooh. Nice to see
a familiar face.

1186
01:22:28,523 --> 01:22:29,922
<i>E chu ta!</i>

1187
01:22:30,025 --> 01:22:31,424
How rude!

1188
01:22:31,526 --> 01:22:32,925
<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

1189
01:22:33,028 --> 01:22:34,928
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

1190
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:36,497
I wonder if... Hello?

1191
01:22:38,266 --> 01:22:39,665
How interesting.

1192
01:22:39,768 --> 01:22:41,360
Who are you?

1193
01:22:41,469 --> 01:22:42,868
Oh, my! I...
I'm terribly sorry.

1194
01:22:42,971 --> 01:22:44,461
I didn't mean
to intrude.

1195
01:22:44,573 --> 01:22:45,665
No, please don't get up.

1196
01:22:52,147 --> 01:22:53,580
Gahhh.

1197
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:06,719
Luke, you must complete
the training.

1198
01:23:06,828 --> 01:23:08,489
I can't keep the vision
out of my head.

1199
01:23:08,597 --> 01:23:10,588
They're my friends.
I got to help them.

1200
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:12,860
You must not go.

1201
01:23:12,968 --> 01:23:16,062
But Han and Leia will die
if I don't.

1202
01:23:16,204 --> 01:23:17,728
<i>You don't know that.</i>

1203
01:23:17,839 --> 01:23:20,706
<i>Even Yoda cannot
see their fate.</i>

1204
01:23:20,809 --> 01:23:22,936
But I can help them.

1205
01:23:23,044 --> 01:23:24,534
I feel the Force.

1206
01:23:24,646 --> 01:23:26,079
<i>But you cannot
control it.</i>

1207
01:23:26,181 --> 01:23:28,706
<i>This is a dangerous
time for you...</i>

1208
01:23:28,817 --> 01:23:32,583
<i>when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.</i>

1209
01:23:32,687 --> 01:23:35,918
Yes! Yes!
To Obi-Wan you listen.

1210
01:23:36,024 --> 01:23:39,084
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.

1211
01:23:39,194 --> 01:23:42,459
But I've learned
so much since then.

1212
01:23:42,564 --> 01:23:45,965
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and to finish what I've begun.

1213
01:23:46,067 --> 01:23:47,364
You have my word.

1214
01:23:47,469 --> 01:23:48,868
<i>It is you
and your abilities...</i>

1215
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:50,232
<i>the emperor wants.</i>

1216
01:23:50,338 --> 01:23:54,206
<i>That is why your friends
are made to suffer.</i>

1217
01:23:54,309 --> 01:23:56,243
That's why
I have to go.

1218
01:23:56,344 --> 01:23:59,643
<i>Luke, I don't want
to lose you to the emperor...</i>

1219
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:01,716
<i>the way I lost Vader.</i>

1220
01:24:01,816 --> 01:24:03,306
You won't.

1221
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:05,386
Stopped they must be.

1222
01:24:05,487 --> 01:24:07,785
On this all depends.

1223
01:24:07,889 --> 01:24:10,221
Only a fully trained
Jedi knight...

1224
01:24:10,325 --> 01:24:12,122
with the Force
as his ally...

1225
01:24:12,227 --> 01:24:14,821
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

1226
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:17,057
If you end
your training now...

1227
01:24:17,165 --> 01:24:21,465
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

1228
01:24:21,569 --> 01:24:24,231
you will become
an agent of evil.

1229
01:24:24,339 --> 01:24:25,306
<i>Patience.</i>

1230
01:24:25,407 --> 01:24:27,602
And sacrifice
Han and Leia?

1231
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:31,770
If you honor what they fight for... yes.

1232
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,507
<i>If you choose to face Vader...</i>

1233
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:34,980
<i>you will do it alone.</i>

1234
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:37,108
<i>I cannot interfere.</i>

1235
01:24:38,386 --> 01:24:40,411
I understand.

1236
01:24:44,993 --> 01:24:46,221
R2.

1237
01:24:46,328 --> 01:24:47,727
<i>[Blip Beep]</i>

1238
01:24:47,829 --> 01:24:49,694
Fire up the converters.

1239
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:52,924
<i>Luke!</i>

1240
01:24:53,034 --> 01:24:56,026
<i>Don't give in to hate.</i>

1241
01:24:56,137 --> 01:24:58,935
<i>That leads to the dark side.</i>

1242
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,439
Strong is Vader.

1243
01:25:00,542 --> 01:25:03,375
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

1244
01:25:03,478 --> 01:25:04,945
I will.

1245
01:25:05,046 --> 01:25:06,775
And I'll return.

1246
01:25:06,881 --> 01:25:08,280
I promise.

1247
01:25:15,056 --> 01:25:16,990
Told you, I did.

1248
01:25:17,092 --> 01:25:18,787
Reckless is he.

1249
01:25:18,893 --> 01:25:19,951
Now...

1250
01:25:20,061 --> 01:25:21,824
matters are worse.

1251
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:24,831
<i>That boy
is our last hope.</i>

1252
01:25:24,933 --> 01:25:26,958
No, there is another.

1253
01:25:58,767 --> 01:26:00,098
The ship's almost finished.

1254
01:26:00,201 --> 01:26:02,431
Two or three more things
and we're in great shape.

1255
01:26:02,537 --> 01:26:04,129
The sooner the better.
Something is wrong here.

1256
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:06,764
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

1257
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:09,139
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

1258
01:26:09,244 --> 01:26:11,644
Relax.
I'll talk to Lando...

1259
01:26:11,746 --> 01:26:14,146
and see what
I can find out.

1260
01:26:14,249 --> 01:26:16,149
I don't trust Lando.

1261
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:18,651
Well, I don't
trust him either.

1262
01:26:18,753 --> 01:26:21,244
But he is my friend.
Besides...

1263
01:26:21,356 --> 01:26:23,256
we'll soon be gone.

1264
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:26,657
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

1265
01:26:59,928 --> 01:27:01,361
Gaahh!

1266
01:27:01,463 --> 01:27:02,521
What happened?

1267
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:04,120
Gahhh gahhh.

1268
01:27:04,232 --> 01:27:05,563
Where?

1269
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:06,964
Gahhh!

1270
01:27:07,068 --> 01:27:08,933
Found him
in a junk pile?

1271
01:27:09,037 --> 01:27:11,767
Oh, what a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

1272
01:27:11,873 --> 01:27:13,807
Gahhh!

1273
01:27:13,908 --> 01:27:15,569
Lando's got people
that can fix him.

1274
01:27:15,677 --> 01:27:17,144
No, thanks.

1275
01:27:17,245 --> 01:27:20,874
I'm sorry, am I
interrupting anything?

1276
01:27:20,982 --> 01:27:22,950
Not really.

1277
01:27:26,421 --> 01:27:28,480
You look
absolutely beautiful.

1278
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:31,923
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

1279
01:27:32,026 --> 01:27:33,459
Thank you.

1280
01:27:33,561 --> 01:27:36,462
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

1281
01:27:36,564 --> 01:27:38,122
Everyone's invited,
of course.

1282
01:27:39,567 --> 01:27:41,432
Having trouble
with your droid?

1283
01:27:41,536 --> 01:27:42,969
No, no problem.

1284
01:27:43,071 --> 01:27:44,060
Why?

1285
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,578
You see, since we're
a small operation...

1286
01:27:54,682 --> 01:27:56,673
we don't fall into...

1287
01:27:56,784 --> 01:27:59,116
the jurisdiction
of the Empire.

1288
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:02,121
So you're part of
the Mining Guild, then?

1289
01:28:02,223 --> 01:28:04,088
No, not actually. Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed.

1290
01:28:04,192 --> 01:28:06,126
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

1291
01:28:06,227 --> 01:28:08,593
since our customers
are anxious to avoid...

1292
01:28:08,696 --> 01:28:10,823
attracting attention
to themselves.

1293
01:28:10,932 --> 01:28:13,366
Aren't you afraid
the Empire's going to find out...

1294
01:28:13,468 --> 01:28:15,299
about this little operation,
shut you down?

1295
01:28:15,403 --> 01:28:17,803
It's always been a danger that looms
like a shadow over everything we've built.

1296
01:28:17,906 --> 01:28:20,272
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

1297
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:25,210
I've just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever.

1298
01:28:34,222 --> 01:28:37,020
We would be honored
if you would join us.

1299
01:28:42,497 --> 01:28:43,896
I had no choice.

1300
01:28:43,998 --> 01:28:46,296
They arrived
right before you did.

1301
01:28:46,401 --> 01:28:47,868
I'm sorry.

1302
01:28:52,106 --> 01:28:53,733
I'm sorry, too.

1303
01:28:56,010 --> 01:28:57,807
Gahhh.

1304

Lord Vader, what about Leia

They must never again
leave this city.

1329

That was never a condition
of our agreement...

to this bounty hunter.

a garrison here.

Shut up and listen!

1354
01:32:50,878 --> 01:32:53,073
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

1355
01:32:53,181 --> 01:32:55,081
They'll have to stay here,
but at least they'll be safe.

1356
01:32:55,183 --> 01:32:56,241
Leia:
What about Han?

1357
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:57,317
Vader's given him
to the bounty hunter.

1358
01:32:57,418 --> 01:32:58,942
Vader wants us
all dead.

1359
01:32:59,053 --> 01:33:00,077
He doesn't want you at all.

1360
01:33:00,188 --> 01:33:01,951
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

1361
01:33:02,056 --> 01:33:03,956
- Luke.
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.

1362
01:33:04,058 --> 01:33:06,049
And we're the bait!

1363
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,991
He's on his way.

1364

You fixed us all
real good, didn't you?

1365
01:33:11,265 --> 01:33:12,459
My friend.

1366
01:33:14,769 --> 01:33:15,895
Stop!

1367
01:33:17,939 --> 01:33:19,463
I've done all I can.

1368
01:33:19,574 --> 01:33:20,973
I'm sorry
I couldn't do better...

1369
01:33:21,075 --> 01:33:22,667
but I've got
my own problems.

1370
01:33:22,777 --> 01:33:24,142
Yeah.

1371
01:33:24,245 --> 01:33:26,076
You're a real hero.

1372
01:33:36,457 --> 01:33:39,017
You certainly have
a way with people.

1373

Ah... Ah...

1374
01:33:53,407 --> 01:33:55,534
This facility is crude...

1375
01:33:55,643 --> 01:33:58,578
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

1376
01:33:58,679 --> 01:34:01,079
for his journey to the emperor.

1377
01:34:01,182 --> 01:34:04,015
Lord Vader, ship approaching,
X-wing class.

1378
01:34:04,118 --> 01:34:06,416
Good.
Monitor Skywalker...

1379
01:34:06,521 --> 01:34:08,512
and allow him
to land.

1380
01:34:08,623 --> 01:34:11,990
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing.

1381
01:34:12,093 --> 01:34:14,425
You put him in there,
it might kill him.

1382
01:34:14,529 --> 01:34:15,928
I do not want...

1383
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:17,429
the emperor's prize
damaged.

1384
01:34:17,532 --> 01:34:20,000
We will test it
on Captain Solo.

1385
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:45,388
If only you'd
attached my legs...

1386
01:34:45,493 --> 01:34:47,427
I wouldn't be
in this ridiculous position.

1387
01:34:47,528 --> 01:34:48,927
Now remember,
Chewbacca...

1388
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:50,930
you have a responsibility for me...

1389
01:34:51,032 --> 01:34:52,863
so don't do anything foolish.

You're being put
into carbon freeze.

1393
01:35:12,153 --> 01:35:15,611
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

1394
01:35:15,723 --> 01:35:17,122
The Empire
will compensate you...

1395
01:35:17,224 --> 01:35:18,282
if he dies.

1396
01:35:18,392 --> 01:35:20,292

take care of her.

Gahhh.

1415
01:37:34,028 --> 01:37:37,429
Oh, they've encased him
in carbonite.

1416
01:37:37,531 --> 01:37:39,192
He should be quite
well-protected...

1417

if he survived the freezing process,
that is.

Well, Calrissian,
did he survive?

1419
01:37:44,305 --> 01:37:46,136
Yes, he's alive.

1420

1468
01:43:15,335 --> 01:43:19,203
Hurry! Hurry! We're trying to save Han
from the bounty hunter.

1469
01:43:20,707 --> 01:43:24,336
Well, at least you're still in one piece.

1470
01:43:24,445 --> 01:43:26,845
Look what's happened to me.

1471
01:43:38,792 --> 01:43:41,386
Oh, no! Chewie,
they're behind you!

1472
01:43:54,341 --> 01:43:56,707
You have learned
much, young one.

1473
01:43:56,810 --> 01:43:58,937
You'll find
I'm full of surprises.

1474
01:44:09,990 --> 01:44:13,619
Your destiny lies
with me, Skywalker.

1475
01:44:13,727 --> 01:44:17,026
Obi-Wan knew this
to be true.

1476
01:44:17,131 --> 01:44:17,927
No.

1477
01:44:22,369 --> 01:44:23,233
Aaah!

1478
01:44:25,038 --> 01:44:26,403
All too easy.

1479
01:44:31,678 --> 01:44:34,112
Perhaps you're
not as strong...

1480
01:44:34,214 --> 01:44:36,079
as the emperor thought.

1481
01:44:37,251 --> 01:44:38,912
Impressive.

1482
01:44:40,854 --> 01:44:42,287
Most impressive.

1483
01:44:45,192 --> 01:44:46,750
Aaah!

1484
01:44:49,763 --> 01:44:51,731
Obi-Wan has
taught you well.

1485
01:44:51,832 --> 01:44:54,198
You have
controlled your fear.

1486
01:44:55,702 --> 01:44:57,169
Now...

1487
01:44:57,271 --> 01:44:59,831
release your anger.

1488
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:03,000
Only your hatred
can destroy me.

1489
01:45:13,554 --> 01:45:14,816
Ohh!

1490
01:47:13,206 --> 01:47:15,436
The security code
has been changed.

1491
01:47:15,542 --> 01:47:17,442
R2, you can tell
the computer...

1492
01:47:17,544 --> 01:47:18,841
to override
the security systems.

1493
01:47:18,945 --> 01:47:21,345
R2, hurry!

1494
01:47:23,817 --> 01:47:25,876
Attention. This is
Lando Calrissian.

1495
01:47:25,986 --> 01:47:28,420
Attention. The Empire has taken
control of the city.

1496
01:47:28,522 --> 01:47:30,337
I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.

1497
01:47:30,372 --> 01:47:32,152
I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.

1498
01:47:38,632 --> 01:47:39,894
This way.

1499
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,400
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1500
01:47:42,502 --> 01:47:46,632
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

<i>in the Millennium
Falcon's hyperdrive.</i>

1504

With our combined strength...

1529

we can end
this destructive conflict...

1530

1531

Obi-Wan never told you...

01:51:08,341 --> 01:51:10,241
what happened
to your father.

1536

He told me enough.

01:51:14,648 --> 01:51:16,513
He told me
