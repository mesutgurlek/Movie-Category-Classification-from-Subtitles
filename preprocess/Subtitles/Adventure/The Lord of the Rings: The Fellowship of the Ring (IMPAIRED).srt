they tortured him.

inane babble, they discerned two words.:

00:52:20,962 --> 00:52:23,032
GOLLUM:
Shire!

484
00:52:23,202 --> 00:52:24,760
Baggins!

485
00:52:24,962 --> 00:52:26,714
Shire.

486
00:52:26,882 --> 00:52:29,680
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

487
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:33,397
Who goes there?

488
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:36,191
Take it, Gandalf!

489
00:52:36,602 --> 00:52:37,591
-Take it!
-No, Frodo.

490
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:40,037
-You must take it!
-You cannot offer me this ring!

491
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:43,479
-I'm giving it to you!
-Don't tempt me, Frodo!

492
00:52:44,922 --> 00:52:47,038
I dare not take it.

493
00:52:47,362 --> 00:52:49,717
Not even to keep it safe.

494
00:52:50,802 --> 00:52:52,758
Understand, Frodo...

495
00:52:53,402 --> 00:52:56,838
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

496
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:07,514
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

497
00:53:08,122 --> 00:53:10,875
-But it cannot stay in the Shire!
-No.

498
00:53:12,682 --> 00:53:14,240
No, it can't.

499
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,681
What must I do?

500
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,718
-You must leave. And leave quickly.
-Where? Where do I go?

501
00:53:25,882 --> 00:53:28,999
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

505

-And the Ring will be safe there?
-I don't know, Frodo.

I don't have any answers.

507

both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

He'll know what to do.

509

You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

Have you been eavesdropping?

00:54:36,522 --> 00:54:40,834
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

523

A little late for trimming the verge,

Nothing important.

a Dark Lord and the end of the world but--

Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
