unlike any other.

Crusading across the stars
toward a place
called UnderVerse,

Necromongers they're called.

6
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,058
And if they
cannot convert you,
they will kill you.

evil would be fought by good.

But in times like these,

16
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,894
well, it should be fought
by another kind of evil.

That's right.

The one you want
is now here.

127
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,879
And whose throat is this?

128
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,757
If you cut my throat,

129
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,219
I'll not be able to rescind
the offer that
brought you here.

130

Nor tell you
why it's so vital
that you did come.

The blade comes off
when the bounty comes off.

This is Aereon.

133
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,560
An envoy from
the Elemental race.

134
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,230
She means you no harm.

135
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,735
There are very few of us

136
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,696
who have met a Necromonger
and lived to speak of it.

137
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:48,034
So when I choose
to speak of it,
you should choose to listen.

138
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,786
Necromonger.

139
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,790
It is the name
that will convert
or kill

140
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,667
every last human life.

141
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,419
Unless Furyan
warriors are found.

142
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,839
They were the one race
that would not bow,

143
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,591
the only race
the Necromongers still fear.

144
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,343
Maybe you should pretend
like you're talking

145
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,221
to someone educated
in the penal system.

146
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,723
In fact, don't pretend.

147
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,477
IMAM: There is a story,
Riddick, of young male
Furyans

148
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,105
strangled at birth.

149
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,232
Strangled with
their own cords.

150
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,946
When Aereon told this story
to the Helion leaders,

151
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,447
I told her of you.

152
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,157
What do you know
of your early years?

153
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,119
Do you remember
your homeworld?
Where it was?

154
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,704
Have you met any others?

155
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,289
Others like yourself.

156
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,627
Sister, they don't know
what to do with
just one of me.

157
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,796
Spoken like a true Furyan.

158
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,592
I don't care where I'm from.
I want the bounty
off my head.

00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,408
(BUZZING)

324
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,250
Interesting breeder.

325
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,057
Making entry.

326
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,227
This won't take long.

327
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,607
We've entered his neocortex.

328
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,402
QUASI-DEADS: The Riddick!
MARSHAL: Regress.

329
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,405
Scanning fresh memories.

330
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,783
Thoughts of
someone called Jack.

331
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,036
Riddick!

332
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,457
She went to prison.

333
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,961
Now we find
thoughts of an Elemental.

334
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,881
The one race that would slow
the spread of Necromongers.

335
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,800
Furyans.

336
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,641
Where does he come from?

337
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,686
Who are his people?
These are the things
I need to know.

338
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,316
We find energy.

339
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,781
We find
Furyan energy.

340
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,825
He's Furyan!

341
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,661
Furyan!

342
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,580
A Furyan survivor!

343
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,207
Kill the Furyan!

344
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,459
Kill the Riddick!

345
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,506
Kill Riddick.

346
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,005
Find him. Whatever it takes.
Find him.

347
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,585
Let me guess.
A five-man crew this time.

348
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,505
TOOMBS: Couple of things
you could have done better.

349
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:11,264
First, trash the locater
beacon inside my ship,
the one you jacked.

350
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,768
And second,
and this is really
the more important part,

351
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,312
should've wasted me
when you had the chance.

352
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,315
Any questions?
Yeah.

353
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,402
What took you so long?

354
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,471
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Decoy launched.

355
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,307
In and out,
unsuspected and undetected.

356
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,725
Damn,
I love a good smash and grab.

357
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,102
It's as good as ours.

358
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,687
Preparing to
engage ion drive.

359
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,691
So where do we drop
your merc-killing ass?

360
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,029
Who's gonna pay
the most for you now?
Butcher Bay?

361
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,656
Butcher Bay?

362
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,035
Ten minutes every other day
on the dog-run.

363
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,371
Protein waffles aren't bad.

364
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,959
How about Ursa Luna?
Nice little double-max prison.

365
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:25,088
They keep a cell open for me,
just in case I drop in.

366
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,465
You know the problem
with these joints now?

367
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,801
Health clubs for
waffle-eating pussies.

368
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,846
Maybe we should think about
upping our game
here a little bit.

369
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,348
Think about
someplace truly diabolical.

370
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,267
What the hell is
he thinking now?

371
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:41,479
RIDDICK: He's thinking
a triple-max prison.
A no-daylight slam.

372
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,398
Only three of them
left in this system,

373
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,816
two of them out of range

374
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,944
for a shitty
little undercutter
like this one with no legs.

375
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,613
Leaving just one.

376
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,116
Crematoria.

377
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,995
That is what you had in mind,
right, Toombs?

378
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,039
How does he know
where we're going,
and we don't?

379
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,292
Dope it out.
I hate this run.

380
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,252
Just do it!

381
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:07,005
Don't know about
this new crew of yours.

382
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,965
They seem a bit skittish.

383
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,760
Probably
shouldn't tell them what
happened to the last crew.

384
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,522
You know,
you were supposed to be
some slick-shit killer.

385
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,026
Now look at you.

386
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,403
All back-of-the-bus and shit.

387
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,318
SCALES: I say
we attack Helion Two next.

388
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,487
Take it straight
into their teeth.

389
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,448
It'll cost you 20,000 heads,
5 Warrior Ships,

390
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:19,244
nothing more, I swear it.
While I do prize brute force

391
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,081
this approach is,
perhaps, more artful.

392
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:27,627
Start at the end.
Go straight to Helion Five,

393
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,879
the last planet
in the system.

394
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,632
We approach from
the night side.

395
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,884
Remove these cannon first,

396
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:38,012
then attack
the larger placements
at speed.

397
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,348
We'll catch them
on their rear flank.

398
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,267
And in 10 days' time

399
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,478
the rest of those worlds
will tumble before us.

400
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,480
You see, as with most,

401
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,442
their blind spot
is right behind them.

402
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:56,364
I've located an ion trail
which leads off-world.

403
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,908
Then you should be off-world,
Vaako.

404
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,619
I've deployed a tracker team.
One of the best.

405
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,621
Wherever Riddick has gone,

406
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:07,083
you lens him out
and cleanse him. You.

407
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,378
You want me to take a frigate
for one breeder?

408
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,547
Don't question it, Vaako!

409
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,760
Take it on faith.

410
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,100
He's always been unsettled
around you.

411
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:28,313
The Lord Marshal. Unsteady.

412
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,900
Perhaps because
he knows he's half
the warrior you are.

413
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,237
Some say he's too artistic
for the job.

414
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:41,326
I wouldn't be surprised
if someone promoted him soon

415
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,161
to full dead.

416
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,124
Take care what you say.

417
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,084
Should I say it softly?

418
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,421
So it sounds more
like conspiracy?

419
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,633
Why is it that
when anyone breathes
about the demise

420
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,844
of him on the throne
everyone
assumes a conspiracy?

421
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:05,600
Why isn't that
just prudent planning?

422
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,353
When he is ready,
he will name a successor.

423
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,479
Who?

424
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,523
Toal? Scales?

425
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,901

426
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,903
None of them

427
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,031
with the strength,
the dignity

428
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,991
of Lord Vaako.

429
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,162
You can keep what you kill.

430
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,415
That is the Necromonger way.

431

I've never been so popular.

434

Should probably
slip these chains
and open up a few arteries.

Got me some business
there named Jack.

439
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:04,409

I'll walk away for ever.

An Elemental. Here?

445
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:38,818
And why, after 30 years,
should it be you?

He doesn't regard her
as a captive, though.

Why else would they come
and go like the wind?

who can finish it all

802
01:32:23,829 --> 01:32:26,831
conquering or
converting all
the remaining worlds of man.

803
01:32:27,124 --> 01:32:29,292
Tell me it's true, Aereon.

804
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,963
And maybe
I'll save your home world

805
01:32:33,589 --> 01:32:34,881
for last.

806
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:40,971
The odds are good.

That Riddick is still alive.

809
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:20,552
We still have
numbers out there,
Lord Marshal.

810
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:22,220
Sweep teams,
recon ships.

811
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:25,098
They would be hard-pressed
to make it back...

812
01:33:28,894 --> 01:33:31,938
Get my armada off the ground.

813
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:38,463
You mean on Helion?
I mean here on
this very ship.

814
01:34:38,547 --> 01:34:40,298
Could you be wrong?

815
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:43,843
Mind fabricates fear.
Could you be wrong?

816
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:46,805
Not so wrong as you
when you left him alive!

817
01:34:47,056 --> 01:34:48,848
It's twice a mistake.

818
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:52,310
Not only your failure,
but now the report
of success.

819
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:55,021
How do we salvage this? How?

820
01:34:56,232 --> 01:34:58,608
Lord Marshal's
got to be warned.

821
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:01,528
You will never
see the UnderVerse!

822
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:04,781
He will kill us both
before our due time.

823
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:09,619
I say give Riddick
his chance.

824
01:35:13,999 --> 01:35:16,459
If he is half of
what you think,

825
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:18,795
he can at least wound
the Lord Marshal.

826
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:21,339
And that is
when you must act.

827
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:23,883
Just to take his place?
Just to keep what I kill?

828
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:25,552
That is the Necromonger way.

829
01:35:25,636 --> 01:35:28,805
It is not enough!
Then you do it for the faith!

830
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:31,975
If he has fear,
he has weakness.

831
01:35:32,351 --> 01:35:34,561
If he has weakness, Vaako...

832
01:35:35,938 --> 01:35:38,106
He is unworthy of Lordship.

833
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:41,568
We do it for
all Necromongers.

834

This can still be
a day of days.

836
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:51,411
But the timing must

837
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:53,788
be flawless.

If you fall here now,

853

at first.
