MARTY: My great-grandfather's name
was William. That's him. Good-looking guy.

186
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,911
DOC: McFlys, but no Browns.

187
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,468
Maybe it was a mistake.
Maybe that grave wasn't yours.

188
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,755
There could've been
another Emmett Brown in 1885.

Did you have any relatives here back then?

190
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,833
The Browns didn't come to Hill Valley
until 1908. Then they were the von Brauns.

<i>Are you sure this stuff is authentic?</i>

Of course.
Haven't you ever seen a Western?

Yeah, I have.

Clint Eastwood never wore anything like this.

- Clint who?
- Right. You haven't heard of him yet.

You have to wear the boots.

208
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,313
You can't wear those futuristic things
back in 1885.

209
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,516
You shouldn't be wearing them

MARTY: Hoverboard.
DOC: All right.

216
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,119
It's gonna be a long walk
back to Hill Valley from here.

217
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,072
It's still the safest plan.

218

We can't risk sending you back
into a populated area...

...or to a spot that's geographically unknown.

220

You don't want to crash into some tree
that existed in the past.

<i>This was all completely open country...</i>

...so you'll have plenty of runout space
when you arrive.

223
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,399
Remember, where you're going,
there are no roads.

224
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,553
There's a small cave over there which will be
a good place to hide the time vehicle.

According to my letter, I'm a blacksmith,
so I probably have a shop somewhere.

All you got to do is drive the time vehicle...

accelerating to 88 miles an hour.

- Yeah, it's not to scale. It's okay.

All right. Tomorrow night, Sunday...

627
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,111
...we load the DeLorean
onto the tracks here, on the spur...

628
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,918
<i>... by the abandoned silver mine.</i>

629
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,798
The switch track is where the spur runs
off the main line...

630
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,190
...three miles out to Clayton... Shonash Ravine.

The train leaves the station
at 8:00 Monday morning.

632
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,671

throw the switch track and then hijack...

633

...borrow the locomotive and use it
to push the time machine.

634
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,029
According to my calculations we'll reach
88 mph just before we hit...

635
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,989
...the edge of the ravine,
at which point we'll be transported back to 1985...

636
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,640
...and coast safely across the completed bridge.

That's our fail-safe point.

639

Till there, we have time to stop the locomotive
before it plunges into the ravine.
