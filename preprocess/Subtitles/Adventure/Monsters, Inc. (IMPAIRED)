Oh, Michael, I've had
a lot of birthday...

661
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,793
well, not a
lot of birthdays

662
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,871
but this is the

Hmm.

What are you
looking at?

665
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,029
I was just thinking

666
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,951
about the first time
I laid eye on you--

667
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,995
how pretty you looked.

I like everything
about you.

00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,390
Just the other day

676
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,799
someone asked me
who I thought

677
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,677
the most beautiful monster was
in all of Monstropolis.

678

You know what I said?

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,956
I said...

681
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,075
Sulley?

682
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,388
Sulley?

683
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,435
No! No, no.

684
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,748
That's not
what I was going to say.

685

Mike, you're not making sense.

SULLEY:
Hi, guys!

687
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,279
What a coincidence,
running into you here!

688

Get out of here.
You're ruining everything.

I went back to get
your paperwork

694
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,356
and there was a door.

Ruined my life, and for what?

1637
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,755
A stupid kid!

1638
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,671
Because of you,
I am now stuck

1639
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,193
in this frozen
wasteland!

1640
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,190
Wasteland?

1641
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,635
I think you mean wonderland!

1642
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,029
I mean, how about
all this fabulous snow, huh?

1643
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,509
Oh, and wait till you see
the local village.

1644
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,113
Cutest thing in the world.

1645
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,430
I haven't even mentioned
all the free yak's milk.

1646
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,953
What... what did you say?

1647
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:30,916
Yak's milk.

1648
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,638
Milking a yak
ain't exactly a picnic.

You know, once you pick
the hairs out

1650

it's very nutritious.

1651
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,277
No, no. Something
about a village.

1652
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,475
Where?
Are there kids in it?

1653
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,470
Kids? Sure.

1654

Where is it?!

1656
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,639
It's at the bottom
of the mountain.

1657
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,789
Around a three-day hike.

1658

Oh, three days?!

1659

No.

1666

Never go out in a blizzard.

1667
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,078
We need to get to Boo.

you've ignored

and now look where we are!

Oh, we were about
to break the record, Sulley.

We would have had it made!

1677

That's.... no. Good. Great.

1684
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,680
So, now the truth
comes out, doesn't it?

00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,832
Oh, would you
look at that?

1686

We're out of

Let me...just go outside

and make some more.

1689

Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?

Does that matter?
Huh?

And what about Celia?

I am never... never

I didn't mean
for this to happen.

But Boo's in trouble.

I think there might
be a way to save her
