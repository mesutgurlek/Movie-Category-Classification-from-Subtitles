Sorry I had to call you.

159
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,526
Yeah, you should have come.
You should have invited me.

160

but I am always this close to begging you

to stop training our people 
and get your ass
back in the field.

What's going on, huh?

167
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,754
It's Agent Farris.

168
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,256
She was on an operation.

169

MUSGRAVE: Ethan.
Three days ago,

179
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:12,061
Agent Lindsey Farris
was captured while on
a surveillance operation.

180
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:15,064
This is the man
she was tracking.
His name is Owen Davian.

181
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:16,816
Details are eyes-only,

182
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,985
but I can tell you
that Davian's
a black-market trafficker.

183
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,655
Extremely dangerous
and a priority for us.

184
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,156

a caravan of vehicles

186
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,162
with plates matching those
known to have been used
by Davian's operatives.

187
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,915
They stopped at a derelict
factory outside Berlin.

188
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,717
It appears
they have a hostage.

189
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,218
We believe it's Agent Farris.

190
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,671
Normally we would disavow,

191
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,640
but Lindsey may be the key
to getting us closer
to Davian,

192
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,391
and that's a risk
we need to take.

193
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,394
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

194
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,514
is to find Lindsey
and bring her home.

195
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,850
I've already
assembled a team.

196

awaiting your word.

herself to be captured.

I've got for it?

was Davian.

Mr. Musgrave,
please don't interrupt me

when I'm asking
rhetorical questions.

435
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,214
Your operation has
achieved one thing.

436
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:04,252
You have reminded Davian
that he is winning.

437
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:07,172
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go inform

there's no image.

474
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,424
Then you're not looking
in the right place.

475
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,926

am I supposed to look?

476
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,177
There's not much square
footage to this thing.

477
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,179
Why would Lindsey send me
a blank microdot?

478
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,680
I don't know.
Why would Lindsey
send you anything?

479
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,184
You were her instructor,
not her handler.

480
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:20,188
Listen, man. I don't mean
to cross the line,

481
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,224
but was there something
going on between you two?

482
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:25,727
You and Lindsey.

483
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:28,613
Lindsey was like
my little sister.

484
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,115
And you never

485
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,985
slept with your
little sister, right?

486
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,874
Hey, brother,
if I don't ask you, who will?

487
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,210
Maybe it's magnetic.
The microdot.

488
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,163
Well, that's old school.

489
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:48,166
If she was in a hurry
and only had access to
black-market gear, maybe.

Yeah. Be right there.

495
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,477
The thing about Lindsey
is she was brand-new.

496
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,979
She was sweet.

497
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,480
Remember when
you were sweet?

498
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,482
Can you remember
that far back?

499
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,484
Yeah, well, barely.

500
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,488

you asked me what
it is I see in Julia.

501
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,992

is life before all this.

502
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,994

Benji, what have you got?

504
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,166
Uh, well, these hard drive
platters are just fried.

505
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,335
Yeah.
You know, they m-m-made--
made a mess of them.

506
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,620
It's just like...
There's holes in them
and stuff.

507
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,839
And it's got scorched
all the way through.
And then...

508
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,540
Look, this one's got
a hole in it and stuff.

509
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,541
I can't believe.
I can't even look at it.

510
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,094
Benji. Did you recover
anything?
Yes. Yes.

511
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,880
Despite the aforementioned
conditions of the hard drive
you brought back,

512
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:40,601
I managed to recover
portions of, uh,
two dozen e-mail files.

513
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,437
Also made
what I believe to be

514
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,940
a thoroughly
promotion-worthy breakthrough.

515

Your Mr. Davian is
going to arrive in Rome
the day after tomorrow

516
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,563
and attend a function
at one Vatican City.

517
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,699
What the hell is Davian 
doing at the Vatican?

518
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,984
It's all got to do
with the "Rabbit's Foot."

519
00:33:56,984 --> 00:33:58,069
Rabbit's Foot?

520
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,620
Yeah, well, I'm assuming
it's like a code word

521
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,240
for something
he's about to sell
to an unspecified buyer,

522
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,625
for $850 million, by the way.

523
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,077
Or maybe
it's not a code word.

524
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,463
Maybe it's just a really,
really expensive
bunny appendage.

525
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,381
You have no idea
what it is?

526
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,217
It's interesting.
I used to have this
professor at Oxford, okay?

527
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,220
Dr. Wickham, his name was,
and he was like
this massive, fat guy.

528
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,723
You know, huge, big guy.
We used to call him...

529
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,591
You know...
Well, I won't tell you
what we used to call him.

530
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:23,594
He taught
bimolecular kinetics
and cellular dynamics,

531
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,596
and he used to sort of
scare the underclassmen

532
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,933
with this story about
how the world would
eventually be eviscerated

533
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,435
by technology.

534
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,938
You see, it was inevitable
that a--a--a compound
would be created,

535
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,441
which he referred to
as the "Anti-God."

536
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,910
It was like
an accelerated mutator,
a sort of, you know,

537
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,913
like a-a-a-an unstoppable
force of--of--of
destructive power

538
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,031
that would just lay waste
to everything.

539

To buildings and parks
and streets and children

540
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:48,753
and ice cream parlors,
you know?

541
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,923
So whenever I see, like,
a rogue organization,

542
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,927
willing to spend
this amount of money
on a mystery tech,

543
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,930
I always assume
it's the Anti-God.

544
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:05,136
End-of-the-world
kind of stuff,
you know?

545
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,306
But, no, I don't have
any idea what it is.
I was just speculating.

546
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,641
Did you brief Musgrave
on this?
Who, me? No, not yet.

547

Good. Don't.

549
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:15,696
If something goes wrong
with the operation,

550
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,232
I want Musgrave
to have deniability.

551
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:19,784
That's great work, Benji.

552
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,152

553

is a pain in my ass.

1252
01:40:06,328 --> 01:40:07,329
You told him.

1253
01:40:08,831 --> 01:40:11,333
That's how Davian knew
Lindsey was coming.

1254
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:13,168
You told him.

1255
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:17,289
I thought you could 
get her back.

1256
01:40:17,289 --> 01:40:21,293
But I wasn't gonna
let Brassel, of all people,
undo the work I'd done.

1257
01:40:21,293 --> 01:40:25,681
I took action, Ethan,
on behalf of the working
families of our country.

1258
01:40:25,681 --> 01:40:27,132
The Armed Forces,
the White House.

1259
01:40:27,132 --> 01:40:29,134
I'd had enough of Brassel
and his sanctimony.

1260
01:40:29,134 --> 01:40:32,604
IMF Executive Director. 
He's an affirmative action poster boy.

1261
01:40:32,604 --> 01:40:36,358
You grab Davian like he wanted, then what?

1262
01:40:36,642 --> 01:40:38,143
Davian's a weed.

1263
01:40:40,145 --> 01:40:44,149
You cut him out,
two more spring up
just like him the next day.

1264
01:40:44,149 --> 01:40:46,151
Arrest him? Then what?

1265
01:40:47,653 --> 01:40:49,154
You use him.

1266
01:40:50,656 --> 01:40:53,158
Collaborate with him.

1267
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:56,662
And it's Christmas.

1268
01:40:58,547 --> 01:41:01,550
In 18 hours,
the Rabbit's Foot
will be delivered

1269
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:04,970
to its Middle Eastern buyer,
and we'll have credible intel
to prove it.

1270
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:07,973
US Security Council
will get a report
by this time tomorrow.

1271
01:41:07,973 --> 01:41:11,226
We're talking a military
strike within a week.

1272
01:41:11,226 --> 01:41:13,729
And when the sand settles,

1273
01:41:13,729 --> 01:41:16,315
our country will do
what it does best.

1274

You tell me, and Julia walks.

1278

It's the only play
you have left.

1279
01:41:40,672 --> 01:41:43,959
Not till I hear her voice,
know she's alive.

1280
01:41:45,877 --> 01:41:47,379
Of course.

1281

JULIA: Ethan?

1283

When we met,
there was a lake
near the mountain.

1284
01:42:17,159 --> 01:42:19,161
What was the lake called?

1285
01:42:20,662 --> 01:42:21,663
Wanaka.

I was just thinking...

I was thinking you
might want to tell me
why we're in China.
