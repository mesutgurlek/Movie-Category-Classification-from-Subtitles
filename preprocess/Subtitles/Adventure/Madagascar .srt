1
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,046
Surprise!

2
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:49,296
Alex! Do not interrupt me
when I'm daydreaming!

3
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:51,989
When the Zebra is in the
zone, leave him alone.

4
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:54,695
Come on Marty, just wanted
to wish you a happy birthday!

5
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,907
Hey man, thanks.

6
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:03,391
I got something stuck in my
teeth. It's driving me crazy!

7
00:02:03,426 --> 00:02:07,389
- Can you help me out here? Please?
- You came to the right place, my friend.

8
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:10,426
Doctor Marty tedious is in the house!

9
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:15,194
Please hop on top of my sterilized
examination table, if you may.

10
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:18,213
I don't see anything.

11
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:23,307
Okay, just don't talk with your mouth open.

12
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:25,944
Right here.

13
00:02:26,602 --> 00:02:29,936
- What a hack is this doing in there?
- Happy birthday!

14
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:35,458
Thanks man. It was behind
the tooth! You're all right.

15
00:02:35,493 --> 00:02:37,832
It's hardly on a shelf yet.
Here, check it out.

16
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,994
Look at that, look at that.

17
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:42,605
Look at that, it's snowing.

18
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,898
Ten years old, ha!
A decade!

19
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,054
Double digits. A big 10.

20
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:53,500
- You don't like it?
- No, no. It's great!

21
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:56,318
You hate it. I should have
gotten you the Alex alarm clock.

22
00:02:56,353 --> 00:03:00,780
- That's the one, that's the big seller.
- No, no. The present is great, really.

23
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:06,200
It's just that another year's come and gone
and I'm still doing the same old thing.

24
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:10,942
Stand over here, over there. Eat
some grass. Walk back over here.

25
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,067
- I see your problem.
- Maybe I should go to law school.

26
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:16,549
You just need to break out
of that boring routine.

27
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:18,565
- How?
- Rock the old that,

28
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,287
get out there, who knows
what you're gonna do!

29
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:23,858
Make it up as you go along!
Add limb, improvise, on the fire!

30
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:28,543
- You know, make it fresh!
- Fresh? Okay.

31
00:03:28,578 --> 00:03:30,372
- I could do fresh.
- Works for me.

32
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:34,626
CENTRAL PARK ZOO

33
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:37,537
Here come the people Marty.
Oh, I love the people!

34
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:39,031
It's fun people fun time!

35
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:42,851
Let's go Gloria!
Up and down and open!

36
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,859
- What day is it?
- It's Friday! Feel tricky.

37
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,660
Yes, it's future day,
let's... get up and go!

38
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:53,579
Ten more minutes.

39
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:58,783
Come on Melman,
Melman, Melman!

40
00:03:59,091 --> 00:04:00,786
Wake up! Rise and shine!

41
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:04,344
It's another fabulous morning
in the Big Apple! Let's go!

42
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:07,735
- Not for me. I'm going in sick.
- What?

43
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,642
I found another brown spot
on my shoulder. Right here!

44
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:16,351
- See? Right there! You see?
- Melman, you know it's all in your head.

45
00:04:31,702 --> 00:04:34,646
Phil. Wake up, you funky monkey.

46
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:41,799
Oh I'm gonna be fresh.
Straight up the ground.

47
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:44,053
Tasting fresh.
Freshelicious.

48
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:47,732
Zip lock fresh!

49
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:50,384
Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages.

50
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:53,343
The Central Park Zoo proudly presents...

51
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,908
Show them the cat!
Who's the cat!

52
00:04:54,943 --> 00:04:59,837
...The King of New York city, Alex the Lion!
... Alex the Lion!

53
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:01,879
It's showtime!

54
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:21,546
Gather around people,
big show about to start!

55
00:05:22,232 --> 00:05:25,890
Check out the Zebra take
a cannon, that's right!

56
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:03,704
Just smile and wave, boys.
Smile and wave.

57
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:09,054
- Kowalski, target report.
- We're only 500 feet from the main zoo line.

58
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:11,730
- And the bad news?
- We've broken our last shovel.

59
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,180
Right. Rico, you're on lead of patrol.

60
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:19,450
We need shovels and five more popsickle sticks.

61
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:21,330
We don't want to rescue another cadet.

62
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,214
- And me, Skipper?
- I want you to look cute and cuddly, private.

63
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:28,914
Today we're gonna blow this dam.

64
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:38,297
Yeah! You don't see that on animal planet!

65
00:06:40,378 --> 00:06:43,996
Well show's over, falks!
Thanks for coming!

66
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:48,049
I hope you thought it was fresh!
I'll be here all week.

67
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:53,485
In fact I'll be here for my whole life 365 days a year,

68
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,366
including Christmas, Hanaka, Helloween!

69
00:06:57,401 --> 00:07:00,869
Please don't forget to never stay on a pet.

70
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:04,524
And tip your cabman, cause it's gross.

71
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,415
You, quadropaint.
Sprecken Sie English?

72
00:07:15,163 --> 00:07:18,371
- I sprecken.
- What county is this?

73
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:22,711
- Manhattan.
- Damn! We're still in New York.

74
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:27,267
- Aboard! Dive, dive, dive!
- Hey! You on the docks! Wait a minute!

75
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:31,407
- What are you guys doing?
- We're digging to Antarctica.

76
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:37,809
- Anhootica?
- Can you keep a secret, my monochromatic friend?

77
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:44,353
Do you ever see any penguins
running free around New York city?

78
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:49,829
Of course not. We don't belong
here, it's just not natural.

79
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:53,432
This is all some kind of
wackdown conspiracy.

80
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:57,181
We're going to the wide
open spaces of Antarctica.

81
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:58,837
To the wild!

82
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:05,611
The wild? You could actually
go there? It sounds great.

83
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:09,656
Hey! Hold up!
Where is this place?

84
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:14,723
- Tell me where it is!
- You didn't see anything.

85
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,605
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

86
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:20,010
Sorry. No, sir.

87
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:24,085
And now appearance of the day.

88
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:29,779
The King of New York city, Alex the Lion!

89
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:37,157
Thank you! Thank you very much!

90
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:39,227
You guys are great.
You're great prowl.

91
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:41,411
Give me something here. Thank you.

92
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,735
Thank you! Oh well, thank you!

93
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:50,887
Underpants!

94
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:52,259
Everybody get home safe.

95
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:07,309
This is the life.

96
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:11,404
That's the spot.
Oh, I'm in heaven.

97
00:09:21,202 --> 00:09:23,483
- Whoo, it's Marty's birthday!
- Open it, just open it!

98
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:25,792
- What is it? What is it?
- Come on, open it up!

99
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:30,017
Yeah! Thermometer! Thanks.

100
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:31,788
I love it Melman, I love it!

101
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:35,584
Yeah, I wanted to give
you something personal.

102
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:38,015
You know that was my
first rectal thermometer.

103
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,238
Happy birthday to you!

104
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:49,296
You live in a zoo.

105
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:51,397
You look like a monkey.

106
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:54,654
And you smell like one too.

107
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:57,886
I say...

108
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:04,125
Well done, you guys are just
embarrassing me! And yourself!

109
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,324
What are you talking about?
We've worked on that whole week.

110
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:09,038
Let's go, let's make a wish baby cakes.

111
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:18,003
- Come on, what did you wish for?
- No, can't tell you that.

112
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:20,731
- Come on, tell!
- No sirrey, I'm telling you!

113
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:22,702
It is bad luck! You want some bad luck?

114
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:25,146
I'll blow it out, but if you wanna be safe...

115
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:27,760
Ah, Marty would you just tell us?

116
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:30,174
- I mean really, what could happen?
- Okay.

117
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:37,397
- I wished I could go to the wild!
- The wild! Wow!

118
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:42,009
I told you it was bad luck!

119
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:48,507
The wild? Are you nuts? That is
the worst idea I've ever heard.

120
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:55,636
- Sounds amatory.
- The penguins are going, so why can't I?

121
00:10:55,671 --> 00:11:00,638
- The penguins are psychotic.
- Come on, just imagine going back to nature.

122
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:07,897
- Back to your roots, clean air, wide open spaces!
- Well I hear they have wide open spaces in Connecticut.

123
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:09,543
- Connecticut?
- Yeah, what you got to do

124
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:10,992
is you gotta go over Grand Central.

125
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:14,286
And then you gotta take
the metro north train. North?

126
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:18,458
So one could take the train?
Just hypothetically.

127
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:21,770
Marty, come on! What would
Connecticut have to offer us?

128
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:23,394
- Lion disease.
- Thank you, Melman.

129
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:26,355
- No, no, really I just wanna...
- You certainly don't have this in the wild,

130
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:32,025
this is highly refined food. Thing
that you do not find in the wild.

131
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,596
You ever thought it might be
more than life and stake, Alex?

132
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:38,428
He didn't mean that baby.
No, no, no.

133
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:44,368
Doesn't it bother you guys that you don't
know anything about life outside of the zoo?

134
00:11:46,425 --> 00:11:47,590
- Naa.
- Nope.

135
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:51,028
Well I mean come on,
that's just one subject.

136
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:54,684
You have a little smutz
right there in your mouth.

137
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:02,229
Thanks guys. Thanks for the party.

138
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:05,045
It was great! Really.

139
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:16,231
- What's eating him?
- Maybe you should talk to him, Alex.

140
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:21,692
- You know go off for there and get him a little pep talk.
- Hey, I don't get snow globe, I can't talk that.

141
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:24,994
- Alex.
- I can see where this is going.

142
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:29,205
It is getting late. I guess I'm gonna...

143
00:12:39,944 --> 00:12:44,644
- Come on, he's your best friend.
- All right, all right. Okay.

144
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,244
- Good night Marty!
- Good night Gloria.

145
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:11,848
What a day.

146
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:14,335
I mean it just really,
really I mean I tell you,

147
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,392
just doesn't get any better than this, you know.

148
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,516
It just did! Even the star's out.

149
00:13:22,757 --> 00:13:24,818
I bet if I could find a star like that in the wild.

150
00:13:24,853 --> 00:13:26,493
Helicopter.

151
00:13:30,063 --> 00:13:33,749
Marty body, listen. Everybody
has days when they think

152
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,875
the grass might be greener somewhere else.

153
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,288
Alex, look here.

154
00:13:40,011 --> 00:13:42,804
I'm ten years old, my life is half over.

155
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:48,325
And I don't even know if I'm black with
white stripes or white with black stripes.

156
00:13:54,522 --> 00:14:01,295
- Marty, I'm thinking of a song.
- Alex please, not now.

157
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,107
Yes, it's a wonderful song.
I think you're familiar with it.

158
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:07,578
Oh no!

159
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:10,645
I'm not listening.

160
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,732
- Start spreading on new.
- I don't know you.

161
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:20,156
- I'm leaving today.
- He's funny.

162
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,714
Come on, you know,
you know the words.

163
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:30,037
- Two little words.
- New York.

164
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:32,899
- New York!
- New York!

165
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:35,260
Shut up! Shut up!
I am sleeping here!

166
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:39,599
- We're not all that turtle you know!
- I'm not give turtle right off, pal!

167
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:44,803
- Yeah, you won't run on, you stripes!
- You mess with him, you mess with me, coward!

168
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:48,508
See? Mr. Grumpy Stripes.

169
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:54,057
- We make a great team. Two of us.
- We sure do. No doubt about it!

170
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:57,442
What are you gonna do? Just going
running off to the wild by yourself?

171
00:14:57,477 --> 00:14:58,482
- No.
- Good.

172
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:00,624
- You and me! Let's go.
- What?

173
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:03,707
The wild! Come on,
you and me together!

174
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:07,346
It's a straight shot down
Fifth avenue to Grand Central.

175
00:15:07,381 --> 00:15:09,108
We'll grab a train,
we'll head north!

176
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:13,892
- We'll be back by morning, no one will ever know!
- You're joking, right?

177
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:22,273
Yeah! I'm joking, of course
I'm joking! Give me a break!

178
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:24,216
How do you think we're gonna get a train?

179
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,801
Don't do that, you really
had me worried there.

180
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:34,939
- Well, I guess I'll hit the sack.
- Yeah, me too. I'll need the rest of my voice for tomorrow.

181
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:39,077
It's seniours day, you know.
I have to roar extra loud.

182
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:41,509
Give them a little jaw! You
know what I'm talking about?

183
00:15:43,591 --> 00:15:45,021
Good night, Alea.

184
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:59,748
- They forgot to turn off the ambience again!
- Don't worry, that's cool.

185
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:02,254
You know, I got it.

186
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:11,299
Much better.

187
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:38,597
Come on now baby. My little fillet.

188
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:43,294
My little fillet with a little fat
around the edges, I like that.

189
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:49,371
I like a little fat on my stake,
my sweet juicy stake.

190
00:16:49,406 --> 00:16:53,695
- You are a rare delicacy.
- Alex? Alex. Alex!

191
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,134
- What?
- You suck your thumb?

192
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:58,830
- What is it, Melman?
- Okay, okay.

193
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:02,615
You know about the blood infection,
and I have to get up every two hours.

194
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,261
Well I got up to pee, and I
looked over in Marty's bed,

195
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:09,526
which I usually don't do, I don't know why
but I did, and this time I looked over...

196
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,778
- What Melman, what's going on?
- It's Marty. He's gone.

197
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:13,682
Gone?

198
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:15,366
What do you mean, gone?

199
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,161
How long has he been working on this?

200
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:20,840
Marty? Marty?

201
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:24,824
- He wouldn't fit down there.
- Marty? Marty? Marty?

202
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,374
This doesn't make any sense.
Where would he go?

203
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,053
- Connecticut!
- He wouldn't.

204
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:33,864
Oh no! What are we gonna do?

205
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:37,124
We gotta, we gotta call somebody!

206
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:45,824
Hello? Get me missing animals!
And hurry! We've got a lost Zebra,

207
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:48,088
probably on the way to Connecticut
by now, and we're gonna need...

208
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:54,330
- Hello? Hello?
- Wait a second. We can't call the people.

209
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,919
They'll be really mad! They'll get
Marty transported for good!

210
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,897
- You don't bite the hand that feeds you.
- I know that's right.

211
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:05,637
- We gotta go after him.
- Go after him?

212
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:09,600
He's not thinking straight. We gotta stop him
from making the biggest mistake of his life!

213
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:14,947
He's probably out there
lost and cold. Confused.

214
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:17,639
Poor little guy.

215
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:42,305
- Melman, come on!
- You know, maybe one of us should wait here,

216
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,224
in case he comes back.
- Oh no, not now.

217
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:46,665
This is an intervention Melman, we all gotta go!

218
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,295
- What's the fastest way to Grand Central?
- You should take Lexington.

219
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,655
- Melman!
- Okay. We should take Lexington.

220
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,260
- What about the park?
- No, park goes two ways, you can't time the lights.

221
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:01,821
I heard Tom Wolf is speaking at Linkoln's Center.

222
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:06,351
Well of course we're going
to throw a poo at him!

223
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:17,646
I knew we should have taken park.

224
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:22,300
- Are you sure this is the fastest way to Grand Central station?
- I don't know, that's what Melman said!

225
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:27,493
Hey you guys! That room has
little things you can wash up and look!

226
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:28,890
Free mint!

227
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:32,534
This isn't a feel trip, Melman!
This is an urgent mission

228
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:35,698
to save Marty from throwing
his life away! Where's the train?

229
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:38,083
Ah! Here it comes.

230
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:45,094
What did Marty say to you?
I asked you to talk to him!

231
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:49,034
I did! I don't understand!
He said: Let's go!

232
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:51,754
And I said: What are you crazy?
And he says: I'm ten years old!

233
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:53,562
And then that he has
black and white stripes...

234
00:20:01,278 --> 00:20:04,171
What you gotta do, is you go
straight back down West 42nd.

235
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:06,469
It's now on your left
after Vander building.

236
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:09,459
You hit the Chrysler building,
you've gone too far.

237
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:10,990
Thanks a lot, officer.

238
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,964
Hey! Wait for the light! Freak.

239
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:21,840
Yeah, that's right. Zebra.
Right in front of me.

240
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:24,003
- Can I shoot it?
- Negative.

241
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:25,952
Than I'm gonna need some back up.

242
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,366
- Oh! Next loss of the game.
- I don't know what even to do.

243
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:44,950
Did that just say Grand Central
station? Or Grand Constipation?

244
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:45,778
This is it!

245
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:53,646
Grand Central station!
It's grand and it's central.

246
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:16,287
This is an emergency situation! Don't panic!

247
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:18,875
Chill out! It's not
that big emergency.

248
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,851
How do you like that!

249
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,743
Lady, what is wrong with you?

250
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,462
- Get a grip on yourselves people!
- What a bad kitty!

251
00:21:33,717 --> 00:21:36,871
Damn, I missed the express!

252
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:39,812
Looks like I'm gonna have
to take the Stanford local.

253
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:42,867
- I got him!
- He's got him!

254
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,609
He's got him!
He's got him!

255
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:46,846
I got something for you!

256
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:52,446
I'm okay, I'm okay.

257
00:21:53,472 --> 00:21:54,576
What are you guys doing here?

258
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:58,489
- Oh, I'm so glad we found you.
- We were so worrying about you!

259
00:21:58,524 --> 00:22:01,926
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look at me, I'm fine.

260
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:04,662
You're fine? Oh, he's fine! Oh, great.

261
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:07,514
Hey, you hear that, Marty's fine.
That's good to know.

262
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:09,315
Cause I was just wondering...

263
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,682
How could you do this to us, Marty?
I thought we were your friends!

264
00:22:12,717 --> 00:22:15,393
What's a big deal! I was
gonna back in the morning!

265
00:22:15,428 --> 00:22:17,179
Don't you ever do this
again. Do you hear me?

266
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:20,009
- Do you hear him?
- Guys, we're running out of time!

267
00:22:20,044 --> 00:22:24,742
- Oh Melman, you broke their clock?
- Don't you ever ever do this again!

268
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:26,505
Come here!

269
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,793
We've been randed up, boys.

270
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,378
Cute and cuddly boys.
Cute and cuddly.

271
00:22:50,663 --> 00:22:52,599
If you have any poo, fling it now!

272
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,584
It's the men.

273
00:22:58,117 --> 00:23:02,820
- Good evening, officers!
- No, no, you don't talk now, okay?

274
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:05,968
You're not so good with the putting the words
together and their coming out, good thing.

275
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:07,543
You can thss!

276
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,958
Hey! How you're doing? Yeah!

277
00:23:09,993 --> 00:23:13,693
You know what, everything's cool,
we just have a little situation here.

278
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:17,233
Little internal situation. Actually
my friend just went a little crazy.

279
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:20,166
It happens to everybody.
The city gets to us all.

280
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:23,544
- Just went a little cuckoo in the head.
- Hey! Don't be calling me cuckoo in the head!

281
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:26,969
Just shush!
I will handle this!

282
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:28,944
I got him!

283
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,559
Would you get a kind of break?

284
00:23:34,223 --> 00:23:38,288
We're just gonna take my little friend to
your home and forget this ever happened.

285
00:23:38,323 --> 00:23:40,783
All right? No harm no ballet.

286
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:46,126
Oh, no, no, no. Hey, it's cool!
It's me, Alex. Lion from the Zoo.

287
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:52,571
What's the matter with him?

288
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:05,891
Wow! I feel really really weird.

289
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:09,938
Hey! I love you guys.

290
00:24:10,596 --> 00:24:13,538
I love you so much.

291
00:24:34,684 --> 00:24:36,246
Last night event at Central Grand station

292
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:40,876
was an example of animal rights
have been shouting for years.

293
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:44,039
The animals clearly don't belong in captivity.

294
00:24:44,074 --> 00:24:46,618
Now they're to be sent back
to their natural habitat,

295
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:50,535
where they will live their lives in the
freedom they used to freely desire.

296
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,141
- Hey, little help.
- He's awake! He's awake!

297
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,068
Oh, man!

298
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,635
Oh my head!

299
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,896
Where? What?
I'm in the box!

300
00:25:19,931 --> 00:25:22,885
Oh no! No no!
Not the box!

301
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,653
Oh no, they can't transfer me! Not me!

302
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:29,039
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

303
00:25:29,074 --> 00:25:30,818
Darkness creeping in.

304
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:33,331
Can't breathe.
I can't breathe!

305
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,420
Walls closing in around me!

306
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:40,157
- So alone, so alone.
- Alex!

307
00:25:40,192 --> 00:25:42,349
- Alex are you there?
- Marty?

308
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:45,559
- Yeah! Talk to me, body!
- Marty! You're here!

309
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:48,353
- What's going on? Are you okay?
- This doesn't look good, Marty.

310
00:25:48,388 --> 00:25:51,523
- Alex? Marty? Is that you?
- Gloria! You're here too!

311
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:54,976
- I am loving the sound of your voice!
- What is going on?

312
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,968
- We're rolling in crates.
- Oh, no!

313
00:25:57,003 --> 00:26:00,992
- Oh, sleeping just knocks me out.
- Melman!

314
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:02,937
- Is that Melman?
- Are you okay?

315
00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:08,021
Yeah, I'm fine. I often doors off
while I'm getting a hemorrhoid.

316
00:26:08,056 --> 00:26:09,477
Melman, you're not getting a hemorrhoid.

317
00:26:09,512 --> 00:26:11,872
- Cat skin?
- No! No cat skin!

318
00:26:11,907 --> 00:26:15,690
- It's a transfer! It's a zoo transfer!
- Zoo transfer! Oh, no.

319
00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:19,598
I can't be transferred, I have an
appointment with doctor Goldberg at 5.

320
00:26:20,653 --> 00:26:22,550
- Melman.
- My prescriptions have to be filled.

321
00:26:22,585 --> 00:26:24,907
- Calm down, Melman.
- No other zoo can afford my medical care!

322
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:27,329
- Melman!
- I am not going nowhere.

323
00:26:27,364 --> 00:26:32,907
Easy Melman. It's gotta be okay,
we are going to be okayze.

324
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:34,454
No Marty, we're not gonna be okayze.

325
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:40,621
- Now because of you we're ruined!
- Because of me? I feel to see how this is my fault.

326
00:26:40,656 --> 00:26:43,825
- You're kidding, right Marty?
- You! You kicked off the people!

327
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,619
You bit the hand Marty,
you bit the hand.

328
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:48,563
I don't know who I am,
I don't know who I am.

329
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:53,631
- I gotta go find myself in a wild!
- Hey! I did not ask you to come after me.

330
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,703
- Did I?
- He does have a point.

331
00:26:55,738 --> 00:26:58,513
- What?
- I did say we should stay at the zoo,

332
00:26:58,548 --> 00:27:00,912
but you guys!
- Melman, just shut it!

333
00:27:00,947 --> 00:27:03,550
You're the one that suggested this
whole idea to happen in the first place.

334
00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:06,674
- Alex, leave Melman out of this please.
- Thank you, Gloria. Besides Alex,

335
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,712
it is not my fault that we're transferred!
- Melman, shut it.

336
00:27:09,747 --> 00:27:12,504
- Does anybody feel nauseous?
- I feel nauseous.

337
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,705
Melman, you always feel nauseous.

338
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:18,858
SHIP TO KENYA WILDLIFE
PRESERVE AFRICA.

339
00:27:21,085 --> 00:27:25,184
- Progress report.
- It's an older code Skipper, I can't make it out.

340
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:26,656
You, higher mammal.

341
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:32,080
- Can you read?
- No, Phil can read though. Phil!

342
00:27:36,248 --> 00:27:43,465
Ship to Kenya. Wildlife preserve Africa!

343
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,171
Africa. That ain't gonna fly. Rico!

344
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:32,083
I was the star in the greatest city on earth!

345
00:28:32,118 --> 00:28:35,653
- A King loved by my people!
- Let's just be simple!

346
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:39,888
- And you ruined everything!
- Love? If the people loved you,

347
00:28:39,923 --> 00:28:45,959
it's only because they didn't know the real you!
- Don't make me come up there, I'd get the wooping on both of you!

348
00:28:45,994 --> 00:28:49,510
- I thought I knew the real you!
- Let's talk about this calm!

349
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:52,818
- They cancel each other right after you!
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

350
00:28:52,853 --> 00:28:55,621
Hey listen! You're gonna
have to be patient!

351
00:28:56,938 --> 00:28:59,650
- Status.
- This time, Skipper

352
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:03,818
I don't know the codes!
- Don't give me excuses! Give me results!

353
00:29:03,853 --> 00:29:05,278
Navigation!

354
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:11,997
All right, let me think.
And shut him up!

355
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:16,441
I did it!

356
00:29:16,476 --> 00:29:18,478
Let's get this tin can turn around!

357
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,346
Guys?

358
00:29:49,424 --> 00:29:52,859
Gloria! Melman! Marty!

359
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:57,001

360
00:29:57,656 --> 00:30:00,753

361
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,907
No! Wait! Come back, Marty!

362
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:05,857
Don't go.

363
00:30:51,945 --> 00:30:58,436
Marty? Melman? Gloria?

364
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:06,202
Marty! Melman! Gloria!

365
00:31:08,764 --> 00:31:10,121
Marty!

366
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:13,601
Melman! Gloria!

367
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:18,261
Hey anyone! Hello!

368
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:25,018
Marty, Melman, Gloria.

369
00:31:26,564 --> 00:31:27,650
Marty, Melman, Marty.

370
00:31:28,197 --> 00:31:30,876
Marty, Melman, Gloria, Marty,
Melman, Marty, Marty, Melman.

371
00:31:35,298 --> 00:31:36,937
Hey! Help!

372
00:31:39,016 --> 00:31:41,680
Get me out of this thing, somebody! Hello?

373
00:31:42,372 --> 00:31:45,218
Get me out of this thing right now!

374
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,613
- Hello? Somebody?
- Melman!

375
00:31:49,303 --> 00:31:52,366
- Alex? Is that you?
- Melman, I got you!

376
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:54,649
Hang on, hang on, I got you.

377
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:02,831
Melman! I got you, body!

378
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:10,398
Wait a second. Wait right there.

379
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:12,838
- Aha!
- Alex, what are you doing?

380
00:32:12,873 --> 00:32:14,173
Getting you out of the box!

381
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:17,762
- Relax.
- Alex?

382
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:21,374
Giraffe quarterback!

383
00:32:22,196 --> 00:32:24,334
- Wait! Wait! Come on! Wait!
- Here comes Alex!

384
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:26,293
- Hold still!
- Wait! Wait! Wait!

385
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:29,576
- Hold still!
- No! Come on! Come on!

386
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:30,824
- Here I come!
- Look! Look!

387
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:34,373
Look, look! It's Gloria! It's Gloria!

388
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:38,009
Oh hey, it is Gloria.

389
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:40,769
Gloria!

390
00:32:50,584 --> 00:32:51,353
Gloria!

391
00:32:55,722 --> 00:32:58,056
All righty boys, fun is over.

392
00:32:58,091 --> 00:33:00,370
- Gloria!
- Alex!

393
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:05,430
- Marty?
- Marty!

394
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:19,340
You know, I don't really have
anything on me right now.

395
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,502
I'll have to get you later.

396
00:33:24,273 --> 00:33:25,276
To you too!

397
00:33:28,098 --> 00:33:30,386
Marty! Marty!

398
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:34,849
Alex!

399
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:41,195
- Marty!
- Alex!

400
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,893
- Marty!

401
00:33:43,928 --> 00:33:47,724
- Marty!
- Alex?

402
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:54,180
- Marty!
- Oh shoot, we were nice team.

403
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:57,598
- Marty! I'm gonna kill you!
- Hey! Hold on! Hold on!

404
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:09,198
Look at us! We're all here
together safe and sound.

405
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:10,685
Yeah, here we are.

406
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:14,599
Where exactly is here?

407
00:34:27,642 --> 00:34:30,854
- San Diego.
- San Diego?

408
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:35,280
White sandy beaches, cleverly
simulated natural environment,

409
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:40,045
wide open enclosures, I'm telling
you this could be the San Diego zoo.

410
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,160
Complete with fake rocks.
Wow! That looks real.

411
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:48,114
San Diego? What could be
worse than San Diego?

412
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:51,425
I don't know, this
place is crack I like it!

413
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,665
Oh, I could hang here, I could hang here.

414
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:57,316
- I'm gonna kill you, Marty!
- Take it easy! Take it easy!

415
00:34:57,351 --> 00:34:58,782
- And then string you!
- Calm down!

416
00:34:58,817 --> 00:35:01,954
Then take you up and clone you!
And kill all your clones!

417
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:04,730
- Can we take a time out?
- And then, I'll never talk to you again.

418
00:35:04,765 --> 00:35:07,146
Stop it! Look, We're just
gonna find the people

419
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:11,070
get checked in and have
this mess straighten out!

420
00:35:12,548 --> 00:35:15,252
Oh great, this is just great. San Diego.

421
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:19,342
How I have to compete with Shamu.
And a smug little grin!

422
00:35:19,377 --> 00:35:21,400
I can't top that. Can't top it!

423
00:35:21,435 --> 00:35:25,006
I'm ruined! I'm gone!
I'm out of the business!

424
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:31,374
- It's your fault, Marty! You've ruined me!
- Come on, Alex. Do you honestly think

425
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:35,332
I intended all of this to happen?
You want me to say that I'm sorry?

426
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,916
Is that what you want? Okay, I'm...

427
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:42,837
- He just shushed me!
- Marty look, just gotta be just a little bit more...

428
00:35:42,872 --> 00:35:45,392
- Shush!
- Don't you shush me!

429
00:35:45,427 --> 00:35:47,275
Do you hear that?
Don't you hear that?

430
00:35:50,865 --> 00:35:53,700
- I hear it now!
- When there's music, there's people.

431
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,241
- We go right to the head.
- A sidewalk will be nice.

432
00:35:56,276 --> 00:36:00,324
- Yeah, what a dump!
- We shall call it the San Dilemo zoo!

433
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,658
First they tell you hey! We gotta
this great open plan thing.

434
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:06,597
Let me handle it for a while!
Next thing you notice

435
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:09,234
close in your hair, and everybody's
plugging everybody.

436
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:12,297
This boy has got a gross on it!
This way guys, come on!

437
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:14,584
Oh, no!

438
00:36:40,235 --> 00:36:42,859
Okay, let's make a good
impression on the people.

439
00:36:42,894 --> 00:36:48,058
Smiles everyone, let's get it together.
Is that the best you can do, Melman?

440
00:36:48,093 --> 00:36:52,062
- Oh, I'm not smiling, it's gas.
- Okay well great. Let's make gas look good.

441
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:04,202
- It's not people. It's animals!
- California animals!

442
00:37:05,074 --> 00:37:06,586
This is like a puppy party!

443
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:10,715
I like to move it move it!
I like to move it move it!

444
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,004
You like to...

445
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:12,840
Move it!

446
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:16,308
I like to move it move it!
I like to move it move it!

447
00:37:16,343 --> 00:37:19,251
I like to move it move it!
You like to...

448
00:37:19,286 --> 00:37:20,125
Move it!

449
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,690
I like to move it move it!
You like to move it move it!

450
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:26,617
She likes to move it move it!
We like to...

451
00:37:26,652 --> 00:37:27,498
Move it!

452
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:29,518
Hi there, Julian with the word!

453
00:37:30,162 --> 00:37:32,639
Original King Julian, what a des man!

454
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:36,833
I like my jam, I love to move my body!

455
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:40,894
When you move your body,
you move it nice and sweet and sassy.

456
00:37:42,298 --> 00:37:47,349
- What kind of zoo is this?
- I just saw 26 blink hoco violations.

457
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:51,064
- I'm loving San Diego, this place is off to Shizam!
- Twenty-seven!

458
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,846
What kind the bad chimps at it?

459
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:05,162
Wait, where's Alex?
What happened to him,

460
00:38:05,197 --> 00:38:09,230
he was right behind us. Were he right behind us?
- I don't know where he's at, but he's missing one hack of a party!

461
00:38:09,265 --> 00:38:14,333
The Foosa! The Foosa!
The Foosa are attacking!

462
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:31,492
I hate spider webs.
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.

463
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:33,904
Thanks for waiting up.
I really appreciate it.

464
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:41,671
Hey hi. We just got in from New York
and we're looking for a supervisor,

465
00:38:41,706 --> 00:38:45,166
because we've been sitting on
that beach back there for hours.

466
00:38:45,201 --> 00:38:47,189
And nobody's even bothered to show up.

467
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:51,266
I don't know how things
normally run around here,

468
00:38:51,301 --> 00:38:54,050
but obviously there's been some
sort of major screw up, which is cool.

469
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:57,613
So if you just point us towards,
we've been straight to offices, or just...

470
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,348
Well how do you do?

471
00:39:07,572 --> 00:39:09,169
Spider! Spider on my back!

472
00:39:09,204 --> 00:39:13,546
- Maurice, did you see that?
- He scared the Foosa away.

473
00:39:18,437 --> 00:39:20,122
Get it! Get it! Get it!

474
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:23,588
Where did he go?

475
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:25,275
Where did he go?

476
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,961
King Julian, what are they?
What are they!

477
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:34,029
They are aliens. Savage aliens
from the savage future.

478
00:39:34,064 --> 00:39:36,584
They've come to kill us!
And take our women!

479
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:38,029
And our precious meadows!

480
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:43,091
Get up, Mort. Do not be near
the King's feet, okay?

481
00:39:43,126 --> 00:39:47,443
Shh! We're hiding. Be quiet
everyone. Including me.

482
00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:50,789
Shh! Who's making that
noise? Oh, it's me again.

483
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:53,763
- Come on boys!
- Stop it! Enough!

484
00:39:54,766 --> 00:39:56,685
I think you got it.
I thing she got it.

485
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,205
- Is it still on me? I hate spiders.
- That's okay, he's gone.

486
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,351
They are savages!
Tonight we die.

487
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:09,952
The feet! I told you!
Didn't I tell you about the feet?

488
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,954
He did tell you about the feet.

489
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:18,002
- Wait. I have a plan!
- Really?

490
00:40:18,037 --> 00:40:20,347
I have devised a gunning test.

491
00:40:20,382 --> 00:40:23,518
To see whether these are savage killers.

492
00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:26,070
No!

493
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:33,316
- Hi there!
- You let me handle it.

494
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:35,865
Alex handles it.
Marty does nothing.

495
00:40:40,998 --> 00:40:43,061
Hi there!

496
00:40:47,477 --> 00:40:50,468
- Oh, sorry. No, no!
- Oh Alex, what did you do?

497
00:40:50,503 --> 00:40:52,246
Stop, stop. It's okay.

498
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:54,984
It's okay. I'm just a
silly, just a silly lion.

499
00:40:59,474 --> 00:41:04,870
Oh, you poor little baby, did
that big mean lion scare you?

500
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:09,703
He did? He's a big bad
old puddy tad, isn't he?

501
00:41:09,738 --> 00:41:11,774
Come on, mama hold you.

502
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:15,678
They are so cute from a reasonable position.

503
00:41:15,713 --> 00:41:20,148
You're sweetest little thing,
I just wanna dump him in my coffee.

504
00:41:20,183 --> 00:41:25,309
- They are just a bunch of pansies.
- I don't know, there's still something

505
00:41:25,344 --> 00:41:29,617
about that one with the crazy
hairdo that I find suspicious.

506
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:34,875
Nonsense, Maurice! Come on everybody!
Let's go and meet the pansies!

507
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:50,842
Presenting your royal highness our illustrious
King Julian the 13 self proclaimed

508
00:41:50,877 --> 00:41:53,378
Lord of the Lemur etc. etc.
Hurray everybody.

509
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:02,333
He's got style!

510
00:42:09,505 --> 00:42:11,853
What's he like, King of the kiwi pigs?

511
00:42:13,622 --> 00:42:15,136
I think it's a squirrel.

512
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:21,410
Welcome, giant pansies! Please
feel free to bask in my glow!

513
00:42:21,445 --> 00:42:23,126
- Definitely a squirrel.
- Yep, a squirrel.

514
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:28,172
We thank you with enormous gratitude
for chasing away the Foosa.

515
00:42:28,207 --> 00:42:30,215
- The Hoosa?
- The Foosa.

516
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:34,120
They're always annoying us by
trespassing, interrupting our parties,

517
00:42:34,155 --> 00:42:36,695
and ripping our limbs off.
- Yes, sounds good. Look, we're just

518
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:41,713
- We're just trying to find where the people are.
- Oh, my! What big teeth you have! Man!

519
00:42:41,748 --> 00:42:45,750
Shame on you, Maurice! Don't you see
that you've insulted the freak?

520
00:42:46,586 --> 00:42:51,307
- You must tell me, who the hack are you?
- I'm Alex. The Alex.

521
00:42:51,342 --> 00:42:55,567
- And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman.
- Say just where are you giants from?

522
00:42:56,696 --> 00:43:01,714
- We're from New York and we...
- All hail the New York Giants!

523
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:03,570
New York Giants!

524
00:43:05,939 --> 00:43:08,102
What are we doing, some
sort of inbreeding program?

525
00:43:08,137 --> 00:43:11,441
I say we just gotta ask these
bozos where the people are.

526
00:43:11,476 --> 00:43:14,704
Excuse me, we bozos
have the people of course.

527
00:43:15,566 --> 00:43:20,095
- Hey, the bozos have the people!
- Oh. Well. Great! Good!

528
00:43:21,483 --> 00:43:22,535
They're up there.

529
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:30,416
Don't you love the people?
Not a very lively bunch though.

530
00:43:32,858 --> 00:43:38,193
- So do you have any alive people?
- No. Only dead ones.

531
00:43:38,228 --> 00:43:44,515
I mean if we had a lot alive people here,
it wouldn't be called 'The Wild', would it?

532
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,948
The wild?

533
00:43:46,618 --> 00:43:48,131
Hold up there a second.

534
00:43:49,442 --> 00:43:55,084
You mean like the living in mud hut?
Wipe yourself with leaf type wild?

535
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,009
Who wipes?

536
00:44:02,136 --> 00:44:04,029
Would you excuse me for a moment?

537
00:44:08,757 --> 00:44:11,001
Get me out of here!
We gotta get out of here!

538
00:44:11,036 --> 00:44:13,061
- Alex!
- Help!

539
00:44:13,096 --> 00:44:16,392
- What are you doing?
- I'm swimming back to New York!

540
00:44:17,227 --> 00:44:19,921
I know I can't swim, but I have to try!

541
00:44:19,956 --> 00:44:23,004
- You can't swim!
- There are more chances!

542
00:44:23,771 --> 00:44:28,705
Nature! It's all over me! Get it off!
I can't see! I can't see!

543
00:44:30,061 --> 00:44:31,520
I can see!

544
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:36,515
Okay look, there's obviously
just been a little mistake.

545
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,175
I'm sure the people didn't dump us here on purpose.

546
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,693
As soon as they realize what happened,
they will come looking for us, right?

547
00:44:43,368 --> 00:44:44,577
Yeah, right.

548
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,543
You know something?
I bet they are already on their way.

549
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,060
250 KILOMETRES PLUS SOUTH

550
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:02,744
Well boys, it's gonna be
ice cold sushi for breakfast.

551
00:45:06,062 --> 00:45:07,021
Rico!

552
00:45:10,657 --> 00:45:14,398
Well, since I'm doomed to die
on this forsaken island,

553
00:45:14,433 --> 00:45:19,961
I, Melman Mankowitz being of
sound mind and on sound body

554
00:45:19,996 --> 00:45:23,907
have divided my estate equally
among the three of you.

555
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:30,504
- Oh, sorry Alex.
- Hey! On the train. Nice work, Melman.

556
00:45:31,884 --> 00:45:35,059
No, it's not on the train, it's a grave.

557
00:45:35,094 --> 00:45:40,415
- You sent Melman to his grave, are you happy?
- Oh, come on. This is not the end.

558
00:45:40,895 --> 00:45:42,575
This is the whole new beginning!

559
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:49,983
- This could be the best thing that's ever happened to us!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

560
00:45:50,018 --> 00:45:54,256
- This is not the best thing that's ever happened to us!
- Yeah! You've abused the power of the birthday wish

561
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,205
and brought this bad luck on all of us.

562
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,822
Why did you tell your wish?
You're not supposed to do that!

563
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:01,332
Wait a minute, I didn't want to tell you. Remember?

564
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:03,747
You guys made me tell you.

565
00:46:04,716 --> 00:46:08,596
Besides, this isn't bad luck, this is good luck.

566
00:46:08,631 --> 00:46:13,239
Look around. There's no fences,
no scedules, this place is beautiful!

567
00:46:13,274 --> 00:46:16,086
Okay, I've got to stop this.

568
00:46:16,647 --> 00:46:21,165
This is your side of the island,
and this is our side of the island.

569
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,983
That is the bad side where you can jump
and skip around like a magical pixi horse.

570
00:46:26,018 --> 00:46:28,488
And do whatever the hack you
wanna do all day long. And this,

571
00:46:28,523 --> 00:46:30,125
this is the good side of the island, for those

572
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,785
who love New York and care about going home.

573
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,559
- Come on.
- No, no. Back, back. Back!

574
00:46:35,272 --> 00:46:39,657
- You know what, this isn't good.
- Okay! You all have your side,

575
00:46:39,692 --> 00:46:43,557
and I'll have mine. And if you
need me, I'll be over here.

576
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:47,776
On the fun side of the island.
Having a good old time!

577
00:46:47,811 --> 00:46:51,416
This is the fun side! This is the fun side!
We're all gonna have a great time

578
00:46:51,451 --> 00:46:55,435
surviving until we go home! I love
this side! This side is the best!

579
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:59,756
That side stinks! You're on
the Jersey side of this pool!

580
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:03,862
- Well now what do we do?
- Don't worry Melman I have a plan to get us rescued.

581
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:09,621
Can't wait to see that look on
Marty's face when he sees this!

582
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,115
Just look at him, he's helpless without us.

583
00:47:26,692 --> 00:47:28,256
Shut up, Spolden!

584
00:47:33,635 --> 00:47:36,451
I've been standing here for hours man!

585
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:39,162
How long do I have to pose like this?

586
00:47:40,223 --> 00:47:42,765
She is finito!

587
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:49,013
I define any rescuable within a
million miles to miss this baby!

588
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:53,678
When the moment is right, we will
ignite the Beacon of the Liberty!

589
00:47:53,713 --> 00:47:57,114
And be rescued from this awful nightmare!

590
00:47:57,149 --> 00:47:59,159
What do you think? Pretty cool, ha?

591
00:47:59,904 --> 00:48:02,071
How's the liberty fire going, Melman?

592
00:48:02,106 --> 00:48:04,507
- Great! Idiot.
- I heard that.

593
00:48:05,318 --> 00:48:07,939
Why can't we just borrow some of Marty's fire?

594
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:13,059
That's wild fire! We're not
using wild fire on Lady Liberty!

595
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:16,785
- Now rub, Melman!
- I've been doing, I can't!

596
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,580
I can't! I can't do it!
I can't do it!

597
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:25,690
Fire. Fire!

598
00:48:26,956 --> 00:48:28,832
Fire! Fire!

599
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,313
- Fire!
- No, no!

600
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:38,557
Fire!

601
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:44,003
Jump! Alex, jump!

602
00:48:44,038 --> 00:48:47,772
Don't worry, cats always
land on their... face.

603
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:49,917
What kind of cat are you?

604
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:02,830
You maniac! You burned it up!

605
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:07,964
Darn you! Darn you all to hack!

606
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:10,623
Can we go to the fun side now?

607
00:49:11,758 --> 00:49:14,875
Everybody calm down!
Come into this cave.

608
00:49:15,794 --> 00:49:17,282
Everybody please calm down.

609
00:49:20,661 --> 00:49:21,890
You over here and you over there.

610
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,414
FASTEN SEAT BELTS

611
00:49:23,449 --> 00:49:24,774
Calm down people, okay?

612
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:33,179
Now presenting your royal highness
bla, bla, etc. etc. Hurray, let's go.

613
00:49:33,214 --> 00:49:38,271
Now everybody! We all have
great curiosity about our guests.

614
00:49:38,306 --> 00:49:41,345
The New York Giants. Yes, Willy.

615
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,133
- I like them.
- I like them, I like them.

616
00:49:43,168 --> 00:49:46,347
I liked them first before
I even met them I liked them.

617
00:49:46,382 --> 00:49:50,131
- Yes, yes.
- You have them compare to how much I like them.

618
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:51,499
Ah shut up, you're so annoying!

619
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:56,400
Now! For as long as you can remember

620
00:49:56,435 --> 00:50:01,315
we have been abduct and
eaten by the dreaded Foosa.

621
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,621
The Foosa!
The Foosa are attacking!

622
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:08,735
TO SERVE LEMUR

623
00:50:08,781 --> 00:50:10,217
It's a good book!

624
00:50:10,252 --> 00:50:14,678
- Please, please. Maurice.
- Shh! Quiet!

625
00:50:14,713 --> 00:50:18,598
Come on yo, they ain't
attacking us this very instant.

626
00:50:20,407 --> 00:50:24,035
So my genious plan is this.

627
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:29,259
We will make the New York Giants
our friends. And keep them close.

628
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:34,390
Then with Mr. Alex protecting us, we will be safe

629
00:50:34,425 --> 00:50:39,651
and never have to worry about
the dreaded Foosa! Ever again!

630
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:45,915
I thought of that!
I thought of that! Yes! Me!

631
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,670
Hold on, hold on everybody.
I'm just thinking now.

632
00:50:48,705 --> 00:50:54,634
I mean does anyone wonder why the
Foosa was so scared of Mr. Alex?

633
00:50:54,669 --> 00:50:57,861
I mean maybe we should be scared too.

634
00:50:57,896 --> 00:51:01,285
What if Mr. Alex is even worse than the Foosa?

635
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:06,130
I'm telling you that dude
just gives me the hibichivis.

636
00:51:06,165 --> 00:51:08,317
Maurice, you did not raise your hand.

637
00:51:08,352 --> 00:51:11,460
Therefore your speech coming will
be taken from the record.

638
00:51:14,058 --> 00:51:16,494
Does anyone else have the hibigibis?

639
00:51:16,529 --> 00:51:19,172
No! Good. So shut up!

640
00:51:19,207 --> 00:51:21,905
When the New York Giants wake up,

641
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:28,275
we will make sure that
they wake up in paradise.

642
00:51:29,471 --> 00:51:31,423
Now who'd like a cookie?

643
00:51:42,022 --> 00:51:43,970
HELP

644
00:51:57,032 --> 00:52:00,370
Al, Melman and Gloria are over
there having a good time.

645
00:52:01,763 --> 00:52:05,279
- It's fun side for one more.
- No thanks.

646
00:52:05,314 --> 00:52:08,087
Look, I've been thinking.

647
00:52:08,122 --> 00:52:10,892
Maybe if you give this place
a chance I don't know.

648
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:16,302
- You might even enjoy yourself.
- Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry.

649
00:52:16,337 --> 00:52:18,500
I just wanna go home.

650
00:52:19,274 --> 00:52:23,201
Could you just give it a chance? Think about it.

651
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:27,218
It really isn't the fun side without you.

652
00:52:34,829 --> 00:52:36,040
HELL

653
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,420
NO SOLICITING

654
00:52:47,108 --> 00:52:53,938
- Shh! It's him! Who is it?
- It's the pizza man. Who the hack do you think it is?

655
00:52:53,973 --> 00:52:59,237
- Yes? Can I help you?
- Can I come to the fun side?

656
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,459
- Beg your pardon?
- I've been kind of a jerk, Marty.

657
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:11,895
But I've been thinking about
what you said and... I'm sorry.

658
00:53:19,332 --> 00:53:24,750
Welcome to castle del Voir! Take
a load off! Hey, watch your feet.

659
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:26,135
WILD SWEET WILD

660
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:34,056
- Alex!
- Me castle is you castle!

661
00:53:41,528 --> 00:53:44,411
- Very impressive.
- Hey, have a drink!

662
00:53:44,446 --> 00:53:48,971
- It's on the house!
- This is sea water!

663
00:53:50,034 --> 00:53:53,989
Oh, you don't swallow it. It's just
temporary till the plot is done.

664
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:59,613
Hey, you all look hungry. How would
you like some of nature's goodness?

665
00:54:00,681 --> 00:54:04,816
- You have food?
- The fun side special, coming up!

666
00:54:06,107 --> 00:54:08,128
See weed on a stick!

667
00:54:08,786 --> 00:54:11,405
- Sea weed?
- On a stick!

668
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,218
You don't love it till you try it!

669
00:54:24,213 --> 00:54:26,171
- So good.
- Well thanks!

670
00:54:26,206 --> 00:54:28,502
Does kind of hit the stomach, does it?

671
00:54:29,693 --> 00:54:33,186
Well maybe I could use a little lemon.

672
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:39,240
No, it's great.
It's really great.

673
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:45,383
- Does it get any better than this?
- But it does! Check this out!

674
00:54:51,363 --> 00:54:59,304
- Wow! Would you look at that.
- It's like billions and billions of helicopters.

675
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:04,786
- It's a shooter star. Make a wish! Quick!
- How about a thick juicy stake?

676
00:55:04,821 --> 00:55:11,485
You know what Alex? I promise you I'm gonna
find you a stake tomorrow that kills you.

677
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,259
- Thanks, Marty.
- It's getting late. I guess I'm gonna...

678
00:55:16,294 --> 00:55:20,102
I think I'm gonna hit the sack too.
Sweet dreams everyone.

679
00:55:50,922 --> 00:55:51,760
Alex!

680
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:06,651
- What are you doing?
- 27, 28, 29, 30.

681
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:09,713
Thirty. Thirty black and
only twenty-nine white.

682
00:56:09,748 --> 00:56:13,336
Looks like you're black with white stripes
after all. Good night to us all. Good night.

683
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:27,834
You see Maurice. Mr. Alex
was grooming his friend.

684
00:56:27,869 --> 00:56:31,452
He's clearly a tender loving thing.

685
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:35,229
How can you have the
hibijibis for Mr. Alex. Look at him.

686
00:56:35,264 --> 00:56:40,705
- He's so cute. And flashy.
- I don't think he was grooming him, Julian.

687
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:46,337
- Looked more like he was tasting him to me.
- Suit yourself, no matter. I don't care it.

688
00:56:46,372 --> 00:56:50,393
Soon we will put my excellent plan to action.

689
00:56:50,428 --> 00:56:57,175
All we have to do is wait
until they're deep in their sleep.

690
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,980
How long is this going to take?!

691
00:57:12,234 --> 00:57:13,273
ANTARCTICA

692
00:57:32,047 --> 00:57:33,760
Well this sucks.

693
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:37,563
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

694
00:57:38,794 --> 00:57:43,238
Wake up, Mr. Alex.
Rise and shining.

695
00:57:43,963 --> 00:57:48,513
Wakey, wakey Mr. Alex!
Wake up, Alex!

696
00:57:49,244 --> 00:57:50,213
You suck your thumb?

697
00:57:54,707 --> 00:57:55,848
What a hack is going on?

698
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:57,724
What is this?

699
00:57:58,436 --> 00:58:02,446
Don't be alarm, giant freaks.
While you're asleep,

700
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:06,847
we simply took your
little corner to heaven.

701
00:58:06,882 --> 00:58:10,152
- Welcome to Madagascar!
- Madawhoa?

702
00:58:10,642 --> 00:58:13,987
- What?
- Not whoa. Gascar.

703
00:58:21,973 --> 00:58:25,918
- Marty. It's...
- It's just like my meadow. Back at the zoo.

704
00:58:25,953 --> 00:58:32,662
- No fellow. That is the real deal right there.
- I think that is not a bad view.

705
00:58:32,697 --> 00:58:35,526
I mean that's the thing that
you were always looking at,

706
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:38,332
but it's actually there,
that's like the real version of...

707
00:58:38,367 --> 00:58:41,268
How about a run?
Let's get our blood pumping,

708
00:58:41,303 --> 00:58:44,364
get those lungs breathing at all
this fresh air, who's with me?

709
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:47,249
Ah, no. I really I don't
think I can. You're at!

710
00:58:47,284 --> 00:58:48,990
Hey! Wanna play around?

711
00:58:51,398 --> 00:58:53,518
- Got you there!
- Come here!

712
00:58:55,809 --> 00:58:58,425
Hey, stop that!
Hey, you're crazy!

713
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:01,207
Okay Marty, I'm at.

714
00:59:01,242 --> 00:59:06,952
- I'm at, you win.
- Come on, Alex. Get in the groove.

715
00:59:06,987 --> 00:59:10,147
I haven't eaten in two days.
My blood sugar is real low.

716
00:59:10,856 --> 00:59:13,157
- I just don't have the energy.
- I don't think that's your problem.

717
00:59:13,192 --> 00:59:16,036
First of all that's not
how you run in the wild.

718
00:59:16,071 --> 00:59:18,427
Let's go man! Put your rubber to the roll!

719
00:59:18,462 --> 00:59:20,525
You just have to let up that inner lion!

720
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,339
- Now, who's the cat?
- Marty, I really don't...

721
00:59:24,374 --> 00:59:27,208
You are! That's who!
Come on, here we go!

722
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:29,246
That's it. Now let's
build up some steam!

723
00:59:29,742 --> 00:59:32,972
- You're the cat.
- Who's the cat?

724
00:59:33,007 --> 00:59:34,287
Who's the cat?
Who's the cat?

725
00:59:34,472 --> 00:59:39,244
Who's the cat?
Who's the cat?

726
00:59:42,551 --> 00:59:44,326
I'm the cat!

727
00:59:50,592 --> 00:59:51,466
Surprise!

728
00:59:59,287 --> 01:00:02,966
You're at! You're at!
Can't you get. Cat's too quick.

729
01:00:06,485 --> 01:00:11,108
I feel like a mile high for straw me,
I'm rye I'm the fly from the Deli in the sky!

730
01:00:12,357 --> 01:00:15,511
- Let's go wild!
- Now you're talking!

731
01:00:22,296 --> 01:00:25,520
Man, I feel... great!

732
01:00:30,705 --> 01:00:34,318
Marty, Marty, Marty!
Like you said baby, it's...

733
01:00:34,353 --> 01:00:39,243
- Crack a like it! Ain't that right, Melman!
- Oh, yeah! Yeah!

734
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,934
I'm in heaven!

735
01:00:43,969 --> 01:00:48,965
You see, Maurice Alex is now a friend
and the Foosas are nowhere to be seen.

736
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,339
It could be said that my plan is
working in a very good kind of way.

737
01:00:55,374 --> 01:00:57,670
Alex, you gotta try something!

738
01:01:00,066 --> 01:01:04,314
- I feel good! I feel like a King again!
- King?

739
01:01:05,173 --> 01:01:07,202
Yeah! You should see that!

740
01:01:07,237 --> 01:01:10,535
Come on Alex, why don't
you show him some yawn?

741
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:16,598
- No, I really don't think I can... Okay.
- Ladies and gentlemen, primates of all ages,

742
01:01:16,633 --> 01:01:23,583
the wild proudly presents
the King! Alex the Lion!

743
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,532
Eat that, fellows!

744
01:01:35,438 --> 01:01:37,696
Yeah! The King is in the house!

745
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:40,414
If he's a King, then where's his crown?

746
01:01:40,449 --> 01:01:45,116
I've got the crown. Got the very
nice one! And it's still on my head!

747
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,917
The roar man, the roar!

748
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:03,905
Wow! I've never heard that one before!

749
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:06,283
Yeah go wild man, come on!

750
01:02:07,688 --> 01:02:08,816
Bring up the wild!

751
01:02:36,248 --> 01:02:40,593
Excuse me,
you're biting my butt!

752
01:02:42,196 --> 01:02:44,306
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

753
01:02:46,494 --> 01:02:48,992
- Alex, what did you do?
- He bit me on the butt!

754
01:02:49,027 --> 01:02:52,063
- No. I didn't. Did I?
- You kind of did.

755
01:02:52,098 --> 01:02:54,938
You just bit me on the butt!
What a hack is wrong with you?

756
01:02:56,919 --> 01:03:00,847
- Why did you bite me?
- Man, that's because you are his dinner?

757
01:03:00,882 --> 01:03:02,133
- What?
- Excuse me?

758
01:03:02,168 --> 01:03:04,306
That's dumb. Dumb, dumb, Maurice.

759
01:03:04,341 --> 01:03:07,570
What is the simple bite
on the buttocks among friends?

760
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,756
The party is over, Julian.

761
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:15,449
- Your brilliant plan has failed.
- What are you talking about?

762
01:03:15,484 --> 01:03:20,098
Your friend here is what we call a
deluxe model hunting and eating machine.

763
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:24,969
- And he eats stake. Which is you.
- Get out of here.

764
01:03:25,004 --> 01:03:29,855
Okey dokey, Maurice.
I admit it, the plan failed.

765
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:33,508
All is lost! We're all doomed.

766
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:36,737
The Foosas will come back and
goblbe us with their mouths!

767
01:03:36,772 --> 01:03:42,856
- Because we are all stakes.
- I'm stake! Me, me, me, me!

768
01:03:42,891 --> 01:03:46,718
Mr. Alex cannot stay here.
He belongs with his own kind.

769
01:03:46,753 --> 01:03:51,398
- On the Foosa side of the island.
- By the power invested in me,

770
01:03:51,433 --> 01:03:54,685
by the law of the jungle,
bla, bla, bla, bla.

771
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,672
- Be gone!
- What? Come on.

772
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:59,998
- Do I look like a stake to you?
- Yeah.

773
01:04:00,033 --> 01:04:01,801
See, I told you I don't look like...

774
01:04:01,836 --> 01:04:05,389
- Wait, wait, what did you say?
- Oh, yeah!

775
01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:10,565
- He's going savage.
- Run for your lives!

776
01:04:12,895 --> 01:04:13,900
Marty, run!

777
01:04:31,455 --> 01:04:35,577
- A bullseye. Excellent shot, Maurice.
- Thank you.

778
01:04:41,714 --> 01:04:46,242
Marty? I'm so sorry, Marty.

779
01:04:50,613 --> 01:04:53,049
What is wrong with me?

780
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,580
Oh, no. What have I done?

781
01:05:00,381 --> 01:05:02,395
It's true. I'm a monster.

782
01:05:03,245 --> 01:05:05,075
I gotta get out of here.

783
01:05:53,835 --> 01:05:56,177
Foosa Territory
1 Mile

784
01:07:17,024 --> 01:07:19,561
What have I done?
This is a nightmare!

785
01:07:20,221 --> 01:07:22,176
It's all my fault.

786
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:26,843
- Now because of me we've lost Alex.
- What are we gonna do?

787
01:07:26,878 --> 01:07:29,849
We're gonna find the way to help him,
that's what we're gonna do.

788
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,852
Come on, we are New Yorkers, right?

789
01:07:33,394 --> 01:07:36,967
We're tough. We're greedy.
We're adoptable!

790
01:07:37,002 --> 01:07:40,743
And we are not going to lay
down like a bunch of Melman!

791
01:07:40,778 --> 01:07:44,392
- No, we're not.
- Oh, Gloria!

792
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:49,264
That was not me, okay?
That was the boat. The boat!

793
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:51,799
The boat? The boat's come back for us!

794
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,170
Come on guys, we're gonna flag it down!

795
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,326
- Here it is!
- Over here!

796
01:08:00,741 --> 01:08:03,284
Come on, give me a lift!
Come on, lift me up, lift me up!

797
01:08:03,319 --> 01:08:06,515
- Help! Help! Help!
- Over here!

798
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:08,143
My head. My head. Guys.

799
01:08:08,178 --> 01:08:10,330
- Over here!
- Over here!

800
01:08:10,365 --> 01:08:11,829
You have no idea how much this hurts.

801
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:19,348
Look! It's turning!
It's coming back!

802
01:08:19,383 --> 01:08:21,952
- Yes, this way!
- Come on, baby!

803
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:27,550
You guys flag down that
boat, I'll go get Alex!

804
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:32,850
Hold on then. You cannot
go back there by yourself.

805
01:08:32,885 --> 01:08:38,055
Come on, I know Alex. When he hears
we're rescued, he'll snap right out of it!

806
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:43,501
- The people are coming, they can help us.
- Melman's right. The people will know what to do.

807
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,765
Now come on, we gotta flag down that boat.

808
01:09:04,428 --> 01:09:10,498
- Now this is more like it!
- You! Where are the people?

809
01:09:10,533 --> 01:09:12,562
We killed them and ate their livers.

810
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:18,209
Got you, didn't I? Just get
them all the people down.

811
01:09:18,932 --> 01:09:21,482
They are on the slow light boat to China.

812
01:09:21,517 --> 01:09:26,515
Hey! I know you two.
Where's that psychotic lion?

813
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:30,006
- And my monochromatic friend?
- Marty, he's right...

814
01:09:30,695 --> 01:09:32,635
Where did he go?
He was right behind us.

815
01:09:33,388 --> 01:09:36,442
He went back for Alex,
he's gonna get himself killed.

816
01:09:36,477 --> 01:09:39,628
Boys, my monochromatic friend is in danger.

817
01:09:39,663 --> 01:09:41,910
Looks like we have a job to do.

818
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:44,382
Captain's log. Bargain
the hostile environment.

819
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:47,959
Kowalski, we'll need to win the
hearts and the minds of the natives.

820
01:09:47,994 --> 01:09:50,686
Rico, we'll need special
technical equipment.

821
01:09:50,721 --> 01:09:53,049
We're gonna face extreme peril.

822
01:09:53,084 --> 01:09:55,505
Private probably won't survive.

823
01:10:02,774 --> 01:10:04,945
Alex, come on Alex!

824
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:07,736
Come on to here, we can go home!

825
01:10:31,822 --> 01:10:33,198
Alex!

826
01:10:34,768 --> 01:10:38,762
- Alex.
- Marty?

827
01:10:39,561 --> 01:10:43,391
Step out of it, Alex. Boat came
back. We can get out of here!

828
01:10:43,426 --> 01:10:47,491
We can go back to civilisation and
everything will be just like it has to be!

829
01:10:47,526 --> 01:10:53,436
Stay back. Please.
I'm a monster.

830
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,695
Alex, you're no monster.
You're my friend.

831
01:10:57,730 --> 01:11:00,433
We're a team, you and me, remember?

832
01:11:08,304 --> 01:11:10,666
I don't wanna hurt you.

833
01:11:42,366 --> 01:11:45,813
Alex, I can't leave without you.

834
01:12:02,271 --> 01:12:07,495
Alex, I'm thinking of a song.
It's a wonderful song.

835
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:09,448
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

836
01:12:10,553 --> 01:12:14,647
Start spreading the news.

837
01:12:15,692 --> 01:12:18,746
I'm leaving today.

838
01:12:20,365 --> 01:12:24,016
We are a great big part of it.

839
01:12:27,022 --> 01:12:30,743
Come on, you know the words.
Two little words!

840
01:12:30,778 --> 01:12:33,158
Please don't make me sing this by myself.

841
01:12:33,193 --> 01:12:36,154
You really don't wanna hear
me sing this by myself.

842
01:12:40,108 --> 01:12:41,419
Alex?

843
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:43,949
Come on here for a minute.

844
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:49,435
Hey Alex, little help.
Help me!

845
01:12:50,597 --> 01:12:51,783
Alex!

846
01:12:57,483 --> 01:13:01,394
Help me! Anybody help me! Somebody!

847
01:13:15,396 --> 01:13:16,825
- Melman?
- That's right, baby.

848
01:13:18,328 --> 01:13:19,536
Run!

849
01:13:22,617 --> 01:13:24,756
- What's the plan?
- This is the plan!

850
01:13:25,599 --> 01:13:27,565
This is the plan?

851
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,757
Foosa hold!

852
01:13:35,232 --> 01:13:37,424
Foosa ha!

853
01:13:38,927 --> 01:13:40,895
Foosa uh!

854
01:13:43,142 --> 01:13:45,021
Foosa ha!

855
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:47,586
Come and get it!

856
01:14:03,685 --> 01:14:08,410
- There's too many of them, Skipper!
- It's been a real pleasure serving with you, boys.

857
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:20,286
- Alex?
- That's my kill! Mine.

858
01:14:25,966 --> 01:14:27,715
Alex hungry.

859
01:14:28,577 --> 01:14:30,283
Alex eat.

860
01:14:44,492 --> 01:14:45,283
Pss!

861
01:14:47,159 --> 01:14:48,008
It's showtime.

862
01:14:50,243 --> 01:14:53,354
Thanks for not giving up on me, Marty.

863
01:14:53,766 --> 01:14:55,647
Man, you almost gave me a heart attack.

864
01:14:55,682 --> 01:14:57,228
You can't just come up
here and sneak upon me.

865
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,896
We're getting out of here.
Guys, just go with me on this.

866
01:15:03,931 --> 01:15:05,690
Like I said it's showtime.

867
01:15:09,829 --> 01:15:14,324
My kill! They're all mine!

868
01:15:16,237 --> 01:15:20,335
- That's the king of the beast!
- Please leave us Mr. Lion.

869
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:24,742
Beauty and savagery beyond comprehension!

870
01:15:24,777 --> 01:15:26,789
I am too young to die!

871
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,958
And you!

872
01:15:35,245 --> 01:15:39,773
Are you maximalist?
You better run for your lives!

873
01:15:39,808 --> 01:15:43,491
- Somebody call a cop!
- He's psychotic!

874
01:15:50,543 --> 01:15:53,170
This is my territory! Understand?

875
01:15:54,587 --> 01:15:57,715
I never ever wanna see you on my turf again!

876
01:16:09,135 --> 01:16:10,834
Yeah! You're the cat!

877
01:16:15,201 --> 01:16:17,869
I did it! Give me some love!

878
01:16:17,904 --> 01:16:20,623
The plan worked!
The plan worked! I'm very clever!

879
01:16:21,004 --> 01:16:23,990
I'm the one, baby!
Come on, time to robot!

880
01:16:24,025 --> 01:16:28,550
I am a very clever king.
I am supergenious.

881
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:31,206
I am robot king of the monkey kin.

882
01:16:32,627 --> 01:16:34,590
So, what's for lunch?

883
01:16:37,328 --> 01:16:39,394
- Close those eyes!
- Why do I have to close my eyes?

884
01:16:39,575 --> 01:16:40,557
- Do it!
- They're closed.

885
01:16:40,714 --> 01:16:41,858
- Higher!
- Yes, sir.

886
01:16:43,122 --> 01:16:44,686
- No peeping!
- All right, they're closed.

887
01:16:44,721 --> 01:16:45,600
Rico.

888
01:16:52,987 --> 01:16:54,199
Open that hatch.

889
01:16:55,362 --> 01:16:57,280
Fire in the hole!
Now chew!

890
01:16:58,222 --> 01:17:00,777
Chew like you mean it.

891
01:17:01,602 --> 01:17:03,910
- And?
- Well?

892
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:07,636
- Pretty good, right?
- There's always plan B.

893
01:17:09,945 --> 01:17:13,600
This is better than stake.
I love it! I love it!

894
01:17:13,635 --> 01:17:15,554
The kitty loves the fishy.

895
01:17:18,325 --> 01:17:20,793
Can I propose a toast?

896
01:17:20,828 --> 01:17:23,197
Now he may be a pain
in the butt at times,

897
01:17:23,232 --> 01:17:25,489
trust me, I know.

898
01:17:25,524 --> 01:17:28,792
But this cat, who to me without a doubt,

899
01:17:28,827 --> 01:17:32,315
he has heart as big
as his stomach! To Alex!

900
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:33,313
To Alex!

901
01:17:40,434 --> 01:17:41,506
Enough!

902
01:17:43,924 --> 01:17:46,606
Well, what do you guys think?
Shall we head back to New York?

903
01:17:46,641 --> 01:17:49,359
I don't know, Marty.
I mean this is your dream.

904
01:17:50,109 --> 01:17:52,957
- You're sure you wanna leave?
- I don't care where we are.

905
01:17:53,645 --> 01:17:56,951
As long as we're together,
it doesn't matter to me.

906
01:17:56,986 --> 01:17:59,602
Well, in that case. Yo, Rico!

907
01:17:59,637 --> 01:18:02,181
I'll take three hundred orders! To go!

908
01:18:02,216 --> 01:18:06,964
Yes, yes. But before you leave,
I have an announcement to make.

909
01:18:06,999 --> 01:18:09,623
So shut up everyone please. Thank you.

910
01:18:09,658 --> 01:18:14,447
After much profound
brain things inside my head,

911
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:20,128
I have decided to thank you
for bringing peace to our home.

912
01:18:20,164 --> 01:18:24,669
And to make you feel good, I'm gonna
give you this lovely party gift.

913
01:18:24,704 --> 01:18:27,418
No, I couldn't. Really I can't take your crown.

914
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:31,284
That's okay, I've got a bigger
crown. It's got a gecko on it.

915
01:18:31,319 --> 01:18:34,009
Look at them shake!

916
01:18:36,026 --> 01:18:38,489
- Bye, little fuzz buggots!
- Thanks for everything!

917
01:18:38,524 --> 01:18:40,397
Okay, bye-bye now.

918
01:18:41,036 --> 01:18:44,295
Bye-bye! See you later, crocodiles.

919
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:47,148
Maurice, my arm has died, wave it for me.

920
01:18:48,571 --> 01:18:50,411
Faster, you nodding it like a monkey.

921
01:18:51,048 --> 01:18:52,475
You know, by the time we get back to New York,

922
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:55,983
it's gonna be the middle of the winter.
So I was just thinking, why rush?

923
01:18:56,018 --> 01:18:59,384
Maybe we could make a
few side stops along the way?

924
01:18:59,419 --> 01:19:01,820
- Maybe Paris?
- You just read my mind!

925
01:19:01,855 --> 01:19:05,004
- Let's think, Spain.
- What about Fiji?

926
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:08,195
Cool! Canada, can we? Cheap meds.

927
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:12,153
You know, I wouldn't mind coming
back here for a visit sometime.

928
01:19:12,188 --> 01:19:14,207
- Yeah, I can do that.
- You can say that again.

929
01:19:14,242 --> 01:19:15,642
Skipper,

930
01:19:17,578 --> 01:19:20,331
don't you think we should tell
them that the boat's out of gas?

931
01:19:21,301 --> 01:19:25,597
Na, just smile and wave boys,
smile and wave.
