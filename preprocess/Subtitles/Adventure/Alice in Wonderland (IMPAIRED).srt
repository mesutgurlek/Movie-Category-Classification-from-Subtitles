1
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:17,056
Charles, you have
finally lost your senses.

2
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:18,924
This venture is impossible.

3
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:22,125
For some. Gentlemen, the only way
to achieve the impossible

4
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,098
is to believe it is possible.

5
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:25,965
That kind of thinking could ruin you.

6
00:01:26,102 --> 00:01:28,127
I'm willing to take that chance.

7
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:32,732
Imagine trading posts
in Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...

8
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:40,113
The nightmare again?

9
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:46,816
I won't be long.

10
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:51,821
I'm falling down a dark hole,

11
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,326
then I see strange creatures.

12
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,828
What kind of creatures?

13
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:05,466
Well, there's a dodo bird,
a rabbit in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.

14
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,635
I didn't know cats could smile.

(SIGHING) Neither did l.

16
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:13,246
And there's a blue caterpillar.

17
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:15,979
Blue caterpillar.

18
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:17,779
Hmm.

19
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,550
Do you think I've gone round the bend?

20
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:31,657
I'm afraid so.
You're mad, bonkers, off your head.

21
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:36,699
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.

(LAUGHING)

23
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:41,366
It's only a dream, Alice.
Nothing can harm you there.

24
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:45,346
But if you get too frightened,
you can always wake up. Like this.

25
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,677
(LAUGHING) Ow!

26
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,211
(SIGHING)

27
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,559
Must we go?

28
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,599
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.

29
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:13,369
They will notice.

30
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:17,844
Where's your corset?

31
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,045
And no stockings.

32
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,418
I'm against them.

33
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,184
But you're not properly dressed.

34
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:30,749
Who's to say what is proper?

35
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:34,092
What if it was agreed that "proper"
was wearing a codfish on your head?

36
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:36,256
-Would you wear it?
-Alice.

37
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:39,062
To me, a corset is like a codfish.

38
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,434
Please, not today.

39
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:43,529
Father would have laughed.

40
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:50,569
I'm sorry. I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.

41
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,105
Did you have bad dreams again?

42
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:54,581
Only one.

43
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,745
It's always the same,
ever since I can remember.

44
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,381
Do you think that's normal?

45
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:04,120
Don't most people
have different dreams?

46
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:06,455
I don't know.

47
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:17,805
There. You're beautiful.

48
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:20,436

At last. We thought you'd never arrive.

Alice, Hamish is waiting
to dance with you. Go.

52
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,802
You do realize it's well past 4:00.

53
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,500
Now everything will have
to be rushed through.

54
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:54,236
-I am sorry.
-Oh, never mind!

55

Forgive my wife. She's been planning
this affair for over 20 years.

My condolences.

58
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:12,822
I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision.

59
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:17,993
I hope you don't think I've taken
advantage of your misfortunes.

60
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:21,526
Of course not. I'm pleased
that you purchased the company.

61
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:27,342
I was a fool for not investing in
his mad venture when I had the chance.

62
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,812
Charles thought so, too.

Hamish, do you ever tire of quadrille?

00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:54,760
On the contrary. I find it invigorating.

No.

69
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,505
I had a sudden vision
of all the ladies in trousers

70
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:08,676
and the men wearing dresses.

71
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:11,651
I think you'll do best
to keep your visions to yourself.

Where's your head?

77
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:30,338
I was wondering
what it would be like to fly.

78
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:31,464
Why would you spend your time

79
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,736
thinking about
such an impossible thing?

80

Why wouldn't l?

81
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:38,443
My father said he sometimes believed
in six impossible things

If you're telling me,
then it's not much of a secret.

-Perhaps we shouldn't.
-We decided we should.

If we tell her, she won't be surprised.

-Will you be surprised?
-Not if you tell me.

you have to.

-In fact, we won't.

that you two swim naked
in the Havershims' pond.

-You wouldn't.

But I don't know
if I want to marry Hamish.

Who, then?
You won't do better than a lord.

You'll soon be 20, Alice.
That pretty face won't last forever.

No.

So you'll marry Hamish.

through the garden, just you and me?

Without the Jabberwocky,

Why do they adore her and not me?

You are far superior in all ways.

I don't like it in here.

She ain't great big,
this is how she normal is.
