- Are you Thomas Gates?
- Yes.

We got something
that we'd like you to take a look at.

with puzzles and riddles.

- [Gates] lt's a Playfair cipher.

00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,355 
- Playfair cipher?
- Can you decode it?

13
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,941 
Cipher's impossible to decode
without the key.

14
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:52,154 
- What do you mean by ''a key''?
- A keyword or phrase.

So recapping:

54
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,931 
The Knights of the Golden Circle
was a Southern extremist group,

55
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,142 
operating in the north
to subvert Union forces.

56
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:13,772 
Had Thomas not burned the legendary
missing pages from the Booth diary,

57
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,775 
the killers may have found
a vast treasure of gold,

58
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,778 
and the Union may well have
lost the Civil War.

59
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,197 
- Thank you.
- [applause]

Thank you.

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,877 
And say what a wonderful addition Thomas
Gates is to our civilian heroes exhibit.

63

Thank you.

64
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,382 
Thank you, Dr. Nichols.
l only wish my grandfather

65
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,718 
had been here to see this wonderful day.

66
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,304 
[man] Excuse me.
l have a question l'd like to ask.

67
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,182 
What do you think happened
to that Booth diary page

68
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,143 
- that was pulled out of the fire?
- We may never know.

69
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,644 
Perhaps.

70
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,398 
- Perhaps not.
- [crowd murmuring]

71
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,235 
You see, l have one of those
great-great-granddaddies, like you,

72
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,072 
way up in my family tree,
name of Silas Wilkinson.

73
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:08,076 
He used to tell a story
about the night Lincoln was shot.

74
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,120 
As Silas tells it,

75
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:14,416 
Booth didn't seek out Thomas Gates
regarding the treasure map that night.

76
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,294 
lt was Thomas who called the meeting.

77
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,297 
A meeting to plan
the assassination of Lincoln.

78
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,841 
- How absurd.
- That's a lie!

79
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,134 
[crowd murmuring]

80
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,095 
Ladies and gentlemen,
l present to you...

81
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,267 
...one of the missing pages from the
infamous diary of John Wilkes Booth

82
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:37,064 
with the name Thomas Gates written on
a list along with all the other killers.

83
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,654 
- And Latin?
- Booth was a student of Latin.

84
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,949 
He shouted, <i>''Sic semA<i>er tyrannis''</i></i>
after he shot Lincoln.

85
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,536 
- ''Thus always to...''
- ''Thus always to tyrants.'' We know.

86
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:55,249 
- ''Surratt, <i>coA<i>iae''?</i></i>
- Military supplies.

87
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,626 
Mary Surratt was convicted and hanged

88
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,629 
for supplying Booth with
a rifle and field glasses.

89
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:08,637 
- ''Thomas Gates, <i>artifex.''</i>
- ''Designer''

90
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,099 
- or ''mastermind.''
- l know what it means.

91
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,436 
He must have,
uh, planned the assassination.

92
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,481 
- l see.
- Could mean mastermind of anything.

93
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,193 
You see that?
Burned out right there.

94
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,864 
l can only imagine how difficult
this must be for you.

95
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,741 
- May l, Mr...?
- Wilkinson.

96
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:32,494 
l'll see if this new page
matches the Booth diary.

97
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,747 
This is an outrage.
You're calling my grandfather a liar.

98
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:39,376 
With respect, now you're calling
my great-great-granddaddy a liar.

99
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,671 
Yes, sir, l am. This isn't
some garbage from a history book.

100
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,090 
My grandfather
told me this story himself.

101
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,594 
- l saw the truth of it in his eyes.
- l'm sorry, sir. l truly am.

102
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,484 
We'll test this thoroughly,
Patrick, to authenticate it.

103
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,528 
lt can't be.

104
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,698 
Maps to presidents' houses.

105
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,285 
Keys to locks that don't exist.

106
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,498 
What's the point?
What am l looking for?

107
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,043 
Proof, proof, proof.

108
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,879 
What proof?

109
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,153 
Oh, wow. ls this a book
about the Templar treasure?

110
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:52,741 
Yes, it is about the Templar treasure,
but it's also about other things.

111
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:57,329 
Conspiracy theories, urban legends
and other myths that are true.

112
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,874 
- So the author's here signing copies?
- l'm the author.

113
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,335 
- You are?
- Yeah. See, uh...

114
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,088 
There's a picture of me right there.

115
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,925 
l think it's a pretty good picture.

116
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:13,262 
l thought that guy,
Benjamin Gates, found the treasure.

117
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:17,224 
Well, yes, Ben did,
but l am the co-finder.

118
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,352 
- Oh, l've never heard of you.
- Oh!

119
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,110 
Oh, my gosh. Are you Ben Gates?

120
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,031 
- Yes. Yes, l am.
- Do you own a red Ferrari?

121
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,287 
- Yes, l do.
- Well, it's being towed.

122
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,538 
Hm?

123
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,251 
[laughs]

124
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,925 
Wait! Wait! That's my car!

125

[wheels squeaking]

126
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,100 
Where's the Ferrari?

127
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,479 
- lRS impounded it.
- The lRS?

128
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:09,151 
Funny story.
My accountant set up a corporation

129
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,445 
on an island that didn't exist

130
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,531 
and assured me
that that's how rich people do it.

131
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:19,244 
Then l got audited and slapped
with a huge fine plus interest.

132
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,207 
Wanna know what taxes
are on five million dollars?

133
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,584 
Six million dollars.

134
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,462 
But enough about me.

135
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,881 
[sighs] What's new with you?

136
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:35,844 
Well, my girlfriend kicked me out,
l'm living with my dad,

137
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:39,014 
- my family killed President Lincoln.
- All right.

138
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,934 
l need your help.

139
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:45,229 
[man] l can't believe
you have to break into your own house.

140
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:49,024 
[Ben] l need to get Abigail's lD.
She has access to the Booth diary page.

141
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,193 
Why don't you ask Abigail for her help?

142
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,696 
She changed the alarm code, Riley.
She's not going to talk to me.

143
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:55,822 
All right.

144
00:10:55,906 --> 00:11:00,369 
We have 30 seconds after
the alert starts to disable the alarm.

145
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,831 
- Go.
- [beeping]

146
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:12,631 
l'll probably regret asking this, but
what happened with you and Abigail?

147
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:16,468 
l don't know. l don't know.
She started using the word ''so'' a lot.

148
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:17,928 
''So?''

149
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,056 
Yeah, like,
''So, l guess my opinion doesn't matter.''

150
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:25,060 
''So, you seem to always know what's
best.'' ''So, l guess l'm invisible.''

151
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,896 
Now l've moved out,
we're dividing furniture...

152
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,731 
- [beeping]
- [Riley] Oh.

153
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:34,361 
Women. Can't live with them, especially
if they change the alarm codes.

154
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,446 
You did that in 25 seconds.

155
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,032 
That's why l tell people to get a dog.

156
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,579 
- Got it.
- All right, let's go.

157
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,248 
[car approaching]

158
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,713 
[Ben] That's not Abigail's car.

159
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,758 
[Ben] She was on a date.

160
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,304 
lsn't that that guy?
The White House guy?

161
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:04,099 
The White House Easter Egg Roll
is next Monday. Maybe if you're not...

162
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,142 
He's weird!

163
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,895 
[Abigail] What happens if kids
don't find all the eggs?

164
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,689 
[man] Wow. You work in a museum,
and you live in one.

165
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,024 
[Abigail] Pretty much.

166
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,610 
What clever repartee.
She must like him.

167
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,738 
[Abigail] All right, let me give you
a tour of the house.

168
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,324 
- OK.
- That's actually kind of...

169
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,117 
Oh, Abigail.

170
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,954 
- What are you doing here?
- l just needed to get some things.

171
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,416 
- Connor, good to see you again.
- Gates.

172
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,710 
How did you get in, Ben?

173
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,341 
Riley! Come out here!

174
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,386 
What? [laughs]

175
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:47,601 
Hey! What are you doing here?
l mean, it's your house, but...

176
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,687 
l sent you a copy of my book.
Did you get a chance...?

177
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,815 
- No, l haven't read it yet.
- Mm.

178
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,860 
l know you.
You're the White House curator.

179
00:12:56,944 --> 00:13:01,490 
- l'm Riley. We met, uh, back in...
- Right. You're, uh, Ben's assistant.

180
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,242 
What?

181
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,911 
Um, maybe l should go.

182
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,623 
- Yeah, l'm really...
- Dinner tomorrow night?

183
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,918 
l... l actually already
have plans for tomorrow.

184
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,253 
You do?

185
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,173 
- Of course you do.
- But l'm free on Friday.

186
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:21,343 
- Awkward.
- Oh, great. [laughs]

187
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,555 
- Good night.
- Good night.

188
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,850 
l cannot believe you broke in.

189
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,519 
- What did you take?
- lt's just my things.

190
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,272 
Hand it over, Ben.

191
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,899 
[sighs] l need to see
the Booth diary page.

192
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:39,778 
You saw the page yourself.
There is no treasure map on it.

193
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:43,657 
No, it's a cipher leading to a map.
Anyone spectral-image the page?

194
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,035 
No need to. The ink writing
on the page is clearly visible.

195
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,288 
lt could have been erased or faded.

196
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,833 
You're the director of document
conservation. You know this.

197
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,877 
Not up to me.
lt's not my department.

198
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,504 
That department reports
to your department.

199
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,882 
Come on. One look under infrared.

200
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,884 
You can have the Boston Tea Tables.

201
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,057 
Both of them?

202
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,227 
[beeping]

203
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:15,147 
[Riley] We've been looking
at this page for hours.

204
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,815 
There's nothing there.

205
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,112 
Ben, l really don't think we're
going to find anything on this page.

206
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,615 
ln a hundred years,
no one's going to remember

207
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,951 
anyone involved in the Lincoln
assassination besides Booth.

208
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:32,206 
That's not true. Do you know
the expression, ''His name is mud''?

209
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,291 
- Yes. Of course.
- You do?

210
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:39,296 
- You know the origin of the expression?
- Does anyone but you?

211
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:43,050 
Dr. Samuel Mudd was convicted
of being a co-conspirator

212
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,762 
in the Lincoln assassination.
The evidence was circumstantial.

213
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,640 
He was later pardoned,
but it didn't matter.

214
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:54,478 
Mudd's name still lives in infamy. And l
will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud.

215
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,607 
- [Abigail] Ben.
- What?

216
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,108 
Look at this.

217
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,862 
- See that?
- Oh.

218
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:08,700 
- That's quite something, isn't it?
- Yeah. lt says ''smudge.''

219
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,911 
lt's nothing.

220
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:16,667 
Residual ink
from the facing page. Flip it.

221
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,127 
The letters are backwards.

222
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:21,213 
- lt's a cipher.
- Yes. lt is.

223
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,590 
A cipher.
See how the letters are coupled?

224
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:29,429 
Playfair ciphers encode letters
in pairs. This could prove his story.

225
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:33,892 
Unless you decode the cipher,
this does not prove a theory.

226
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,186 
That's OK.
We need a five-letter keyword.

227
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,564 
- What's the keyword?
- l don't know yet.

228
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:41,400 
- All right.
- Uh, can l get a printout of this?

229
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,361 
[Riley] There's a billion words
in the English language.

230
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,489 
Got to be a logical...
Let's start from the beginning.

231
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,157 
A. Aardvark.

232
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,203 
Don't want to rain on your parade here,
but l don't think this is gonna stop

233
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:57,249 
Dr. Nichols from announcing
the discovery of the page tomorrow.

234
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:02,129 
No, now, wait. Can't you ask him to
wait until l prove Thomas is innocent?

235
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,174 
What if he isn't innocent?

236
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,968 
[beeping]

237
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:19,521 
Sir? Looks like our old friend
Ben Gates is in the news again.

238
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,690 
What did he find now? Atlantis?

239
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,484 
A guy came forward
with a missing Booth diary page.

240
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,612 
That's not the best part.
Listen to this.

241
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,780 
''On the page are the names
of the conspirators

242
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:32,868 
in the Lincoln assassination, as well
as a previously unknown conspirator,

243
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:36,580 
Thomas Gates. Thomas Gates is said
to be the great-great-grandfather

244
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,249 
of treasure hunter
Benjamin Franklin Gates.''

245
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:43,253 
- [woman] Thought my relatives were bad.
- What do we know about this Wilkinson?

246
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:47,508 
- Sir?
- Guy claims he had this page

247
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,886 
for 1 40 years then just suddenly
comes forward with it?

248
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:55,224 
- Why?
- We'll find out.

249
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:55,807 
Better.

250
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,600 
Better.

251
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:58,769 
Bacon.

252
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,897 
[beeping]

253
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,649 
- Keep going.
- That's stupid.

254
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:11,907 
- How's he doing?
- Keep working.

255
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:16,537 
<i>[Nichols] We're grateful</i>
<i>to the Wilkinson family</i>

256
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,288 
<i>for coming forth with the A<i>age.</i></i>

257
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:23,252 
<i>On the A<i>age is a name of a A<i>reviously</i></i></i>
<i>unknown consA<i>irator, Thomas Gates.</i></i>

258
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:26,839 
- Nichols has bought into it. See?
- Would you stop watching that.

259
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:28,924 
[Nichols continues talking]

260
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,342 
lt's on the lnternet!

261
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:34,638 
- No stopping it now.
- <i>Gates may have been the architect...</i>

262
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,267 
- They have no understanding.
- You know the truth.

263
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,645 
That's all that matters.
You heard the story from Grandpa.

264
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:46,108 
The story? This guy's got evidence.
He's got everything.

265
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,985 
We have a story. We have nothing.

266
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,613 
For one brief moment,
the Gates family could hold its head up.

267
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:54,741 
- Now we're a bunch of crazies.
- But we're not liars.

268
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,036 
Wilkinson is saying that Thomas Gates

269
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:02,708 
was a mastermind to one of
the darkest hours in U.S. history.

270
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,335 
And he burned the diary page
to cover that up.

271
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,505 
You and l both know he burned the page

272
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,091 
to keep Booth's men
from finding the treasure.

273
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,968 
That's what we're going to prove.

274
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,512 
- Only one way to prove it.
- Find the treasure.

275
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:18,974 
You've got to find it. You're
going to help me find it. So come on.

276
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,727 
Let's hear the story again
from Grandpa Charles.

277
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,356 
Grandpa heard his father say,
''Treasure map.''

278
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,485 
- Then there was a commotion.
- Got all that. Anything after that?

279
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:34,156 
Anything he said,
something he did? Anything at all?

280
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,034 
- Wait a minute.
- What?

281
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:42,331 
He took his son's hand.

282
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:46,502 
He looked him in the eye, and he said,
with his dying breath,

283
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:51,423 
- ''The debt that all men pay.''
- ''The debt that all men pay''?

284
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,634 
The debt that Thomas paid.

285
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,011 
That's five letters.

286
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,638 
Oh!

287
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:58,847 
Try ''Death.''

288
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,682 
- What?
- lt's the keycode.

289
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,559 
The debt that all men pay is death.

290
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,357 
All right.

291
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,359 
[beeping]

292
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,278 
[Riley] L-A-B-O-U-L...

293
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,906 
lt's Lab-ool...

294
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:20,202 
Lab-ahl... La...

295
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,411 
lt's gibberish.

296
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,705 
- Laboulaye!
- Laboulaye!

297
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:26,416 
- What is that?
- lt's a who. Édouard Laboulaye.

298
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,543 
Where's the phone?

299
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,295 
l don't know.
Can't find anything in this mess.

300
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:34,383 
- Temporary till l find a new place.
- Find the old one. l like her.

301
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,260 
[indistinct chatter]

302
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,637 
- Hi.
- Dr. Chase.

303
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,889 
- Abigail, please.
- Abigail.

304
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,225 
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.

305
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,897 
Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

306
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:52,734 
Of course. l was actually going
to call you about the diary page.

307
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:55,070 
- Any news?
- Well...

308
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:59,449 
We actually found some
latent letter fragments on it.

309
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:03,078 
Take a look.

310
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:06,665 
[Wilkinson] Random letters. A cipher?

311
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,375 
- Maybe.
- Gates seen this?

312
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,502 
He's the one that discovered it.

313
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:11,545 
[cell phone rings]

314
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,131 
- l'm sorry.
- Not a problem.

315
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:19,219 
- l need one minute.
- Please, take your time.

316
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:20,470 
Hey. What?

317
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:23,015 
We cracked the cipher. lt's ''Laboulaye.''

318
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,808 
<i>The ciA<i>her sA<i>ells ''Laboulaye. ''</i></i></i>

319
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:28,937 
So? Laboulaye was well-known
in France. lt could be nothing.

320
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:32,691 
Or maybe there was a treasure map
like Thomas Gates said there was,

321
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,986 
and Laboulaye had it.
We only got a partial on the next word.

322
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,238 
L-A-D, lad... ladder...

323
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:39,948 
- L-A-D.
- Aladdin! Aladdin?

324
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,451 
- Lady!
- Thank you, Abigail!

325
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,538 
Laboulaye Lady. Do you know
what Laboulaye was planning

326
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:49,249 
<i>right around the time</i>
<i>Lincoln was assassinated?</i>

327
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,460 
OK, Ben, l've got to go.

328
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:54,004 
There's a map or a clue to a map
on the Statue...

329
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:57,466 
- She hung up.
- She took your call. That was good.

330
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,260 
- Dr. Gates?
- Yes.

331
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:05,516 
Sounds like he cracked the cipher.
l couldn't help but overhear.

332
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:08,644 
Laboulaye? As in Édouard Laboulaye?

333
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,313 
He seems to believe so, yes.

334
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,774 
Man who had the idea
for the Statue of Liberty.

335
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:17,069 
You're saying there's a treasure map
in the Statue of Liberty?

336
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:21,031 
Laboulaye was a Mason.
They built clues into everything.

337
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,991 
Did you learn that from my book?

338
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,664 
- Have an interest in history?
- Fascinated by it.

339
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:32,209 
Civil War, especially.
My family's descended from

340
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:35,546 
Confederate General Albert Pike.
He was a remarkable man.

341
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:39,842 
But, then again, what is history but
a marker for the deeds of great men?

342
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:45,055 
A man only has one lifetime,
but history can remember you forever.

343
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,308 
So the only question is,
which Statue of Liberty?

344
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:49,476 
Exactly.

345
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,854 
ls there more than one?

346
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,482 
There are three, actually, Riley.

347
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:59,987 
One is in New York,
one in the Luxembourg Garden.

348
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,572 
But he only referred to one
as his ''lady.''

349
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:02,865 
But he only referred to one
as his ''lady.''

350
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,426 
This is like, impossible,
what you're doing.

351
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,136 
l'm glad you're enjoying it.

352
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:28,223 
[Ben] Laboulaye had to leave a clue
somewhere on here. Move in on the torch.

353
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:31,143 
[Riley] Let me get there.
lt's not as easy as it looks.

354
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,604 
No. Believe me, l understand.

355
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,523 
[policeman speaks French]

356
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:39,401 
Excuse me, officer. May l help you?

357
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,738 
Ah, American, eh?

358
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,364 
Of course you see no problem

359
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:47,659 
in disturbing everyone's
pleasant morning

360
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:50,078 
- with your buzzing there.
- Hey!

361
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:54,458 
You know how much our constitution was
influenced by your man, Montesquieu?

362
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,251 
- You know Montesquieu?
- Got it.

363
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:58,545 
[policeman speaks French]

364
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,882 
Montesquieu, yeah. ''A government
should be set up so that...''

365
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:05,052 
[both] ''...no man need
be afraid of another.''

366
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:07,346 
- That's very good.
- Thank you.

367
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,183 
- l'm astonished.
- l got it, l got it.

368
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:14,311 
- l hope you read French.
- May l?

369

He's a cop.

371

Um... ''Across the sea
these twins stand determined...''

372
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:25,989 
- Resolute.
- ''Resolute,'' yeah.

373
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:28,992 
''...to preserve what we are looking for.

374
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:32,955 
- Uh... Laboulaye, 1 876.''
- Six.

375
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:36,542 
- lt's a clue.
- ''These twins stand resolute.''

376
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,545 
Let's see. Resolute twins.

377
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,548 
Resolute.

378
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,134 
Resolute. And then twins.

379
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:51,849 
Siamese twins? Siam? Trade routes
between France and Thailand?

380
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:55,519 
[laughs] That's ridiculous.
<i>HMS Resolute.</i>

381
00:23:56,436 --> 00:24:00,899 
A British ship that got lost
in the Arctic in the 1 800s.

382
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,946 
lt was salvaged by American whalers, and
then Congress sent it back to England.

383
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:08,448 
When the ship was finally retired,

384
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:13,495 
Queen Victoria had two desks
made from its timbers.

385
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:15,998 
Voilà. Resolute twins.

386
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,377 
- And where are those desks now?
- The closest one is in London.

387

How fast can we get
to Buckingham Palace?

388

- Yes, actually. lt is.

Graduated 1 978. Ran a private security
company which had contracts in lraq

and in the Congo in the late '90s.

These are trained mercenaries as well as
being black-market antiquities dealers.

398
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:57,831 
So why does a black market
antiquities dealer...

399
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:02,169 
...give up a rare Civil War artifact?

400
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:06,465 
Something he could sell to a private
collector for a good deal of money?

[Riley] So the queen's office is here.

00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:14,032 
The elevator shaft gets you close,

408
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:17,953 
but the only direct access
is through security.

Give me that.

Call the police. l'm coming home.

- What?
- What good would that do?

<i>They didn't take anything.</i>
<i>And besides, I'm fine.</i>

OK. We're in London.
We're going to Buckingham Palace.

Someone else is after the treasure.

422
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,196 
Of course someone else
is after the treasure.

00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:56,158 
- lt's the axiom of treasure hunting.
- We have to hurry and see that desk.

We don't want to miss that appointment.

lt's the wrong place. l'm wrong again!

Wrong about us,
wrong about Thomas Gates,

447
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,865 
wrong that you'd like
the Queen Anne chair!

448
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,950 
You're wrong to assume
l'd like the chair.

449
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:05,913 
You see? Everybody, listen to this.
This is more interesting than that.

450
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:09,458 
She thinks that even when l'm right,
l'm wrong! lsn't that right?

00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:13,420 
Abigail, just because
l answer a question quickly

doesn't make it wrong.

453
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:18,634 
Not if the answer's something
we need to figure out as a couple.

00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,385 
- That's what couples do!
- Sir.

You and your missis, take it outside.

456
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:26,600 
Now look what you've done. You've
brought the little bobbies down on us!

457
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:29,645 
You take the missis outside.
l'm staying right here.

458
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:32,231 
- Ben!
- Whee!

459
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:34,024 
- Good afternoon, sir.
- [English accent] Hello.

460
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,568 
- Been drinking, have we?
- Just a nip.

461
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:39,655 
Popped down to the pub for a pint!
Bit of all right!

462
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:41,698 
Going to arrest a man for that?

463
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:45,202 
Going to detain a blighter
for enjoying his whiskey?

464
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:46,870 
- Enough.
- Bangers and mash.

465
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,580 
Bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie.

466
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:49,665 
- Sir!
- Haggis!

467
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:53,627 
- That's it! Dismount the banister!
- l've got a lovely bunch of coconuts!

468
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,796 
Here they are, standing in a row!

469
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:58,924 
Small ones, big ones,
some as big as your head!

470
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,468 
That was brilliant.

471
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:05,931 
- What's wrong with being right?
- Nothing. You should try it sometime.

472
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:09,059 
- You're saying that l'm never right?
- l did not say that.

473
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:11,270 
Hoo! So l'm wrong again.

474
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:14,439 
- Now, see, there you are correct.
- Capital. Topper.

475
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:18,735 
- Your mother told me about you.
- [continued arguing]

476
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:24,283 
- [man] ln here, please.
- Why don't you just make a list

477
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:27,536 
of what's OK for me
to say or not write something...

478
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:30,497 
- What's right or wrong...
- You two, stay.

479
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,541 
- Right?
- No! No, no, man.

480
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:35,878 
- Don't leave me in here!
- That's great. Wow.

481
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:37,880 
What is going on?

482
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:41,925 
l'm sorry for getting you roped
into this, but you were excellent.

483
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:45,053 
- Thank you. So were you.
- When did you figure out

484
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:47,890 
- it was a fake argument?
- When'd you figure out l was

485
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,601 
- arguing during the fake argument?
- The middle.

486
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:53,604 
Where ''l assume l'm right.''
Get us out. Which l don't get.

487
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,607 
lf l'm right, after l assume l'm right,
then l'm correct.

488
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,109 
When you get to a conclusion
without asking,

489
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:02,196 
and you happen to be right,
you got lucky.

490
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,324 
l get lucky a lot.

491
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,910 
So where does that leave me, Ben?

492
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:10,245 
You guys are so great together.

493
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:12,206 
- Want to know why l'm here?
- Uh-huh.

494
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:17,628 
Think there may be a clue on
the Resolute desk in the queen's study.

495
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:20,881 
Does that help?

496
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:25,385 
Don't understand why it's difficult for
you to include others in your decisions.

497
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:29,014 
Just because you may know
what my answer is going to be

498
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:31,642 
doesn't mean you don't have to ask me.

499
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:35,103 
- <i>[Riley] Door number one, oA<i>ening.</i></i>
- [buzzing]

500
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:39,274 
OK. Let me try this out.

501
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:43,445 
Abigail, would you like
to come with me, please?

502
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,280 
Yes. Thank you.

503
00:31:45,364 --> 00:31:46,990 
Ridiculous. You're staying.

504
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:48,992 
- lt's too dangerous.
- l am so coming.

505
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:51,620 
- Door number two.
- Door two, coming up.

506
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:52,704 
[buzzing]

507
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:54,623 
- You're not coming.
- Call security.

<i>[Riley] You should be near</i>
<i>a service elevator.</i>

509
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:00,546 
What are you doing?
Are those for the queen?

510
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:04,591 
Queen's not here. There's
no flag flying. Queen's at Windsor.

511
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:07,219 
- What are you doing?
- See the desk, without you.

512
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:09,888 
- No.
- Don't let her go.

513
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:11,390 
- Abigail...
- [clicking]

514
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:14,476 
All right. Get in. Get in. Get in!

515
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:17,437 
Hold this.

516
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,904 
Will you give me
the flowers back, please?

517
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:27,030 
Yeah.

518
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,832 
- What?
- Wearing the perfume l bought you.

519
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:38,667 
So?

520
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,503 
So l think it smells kind of pretty.

521
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:45,507 
- lt's the flowers, Ben.
- No, it's not.

522
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:50,262 
Let's go.

523
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:56,894 
<i>[Riley] OK, now turn left.</i>

524
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,522 
- Dead end.
- <i>[Riley] I mean right. Go right.</i>

525
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,907 
- The flowers... petals... stamens.
- Good. Good.

526
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:19,249 
Go, go.

527
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:23,629 
[Ben] That's it.

528
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:27,216 
[Abigail] The Resolute desk.

529
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:29,718 
We're looking for...

530
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:35,599 
...writing, patterns in the carvings.
Could be anything.

531
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:40,479 
Hey, look at this.

532
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:48,695 
- ''Malcolm Gilvary, 1 880.''
- Hold on one second.

533
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:53,909 
Here we go. Malcolm Gilvary.
He didn't make furniture.

534
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:57,079 
<i>He made Chinese A<i>uzzle boxes.</i></i>

535
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:06,547 
- Oh...
- What?

536
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:12,219 
l think these drawers
work like tumblers in a safe.

537
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:15,806 
OK, four drawers...
Four-digit combination?

538
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:17,850 
What about a year?

539
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:22,646 
Uh, let me see.
Queen Victoria, born 1 81 9.

540
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,565 
So you go one...

541
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:28,485 
Eight.

542
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:34,575 
One.

543
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:39,746 
Nine.

544
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:45,294 
- Any luck?
- OK... 1 876 was on the inscription

545
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:47,713 
<i>on the statue in Paris. Let's try that.</i>

546
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:49,256 
One.

547
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:52,801 
Eight.

548
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:57,139 
Seven.

549
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:03,228 
Six.

550
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:30,964 
[Ben] Uh-oh.

551
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:32,758 
New rules.

552
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:36,887 
These markings, like lncan or Aztec.

553
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,181 
l have never seen any symbols like this.

554
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:44,645 
l mean, this looks centuries older
than Civil War.

555
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,104 
What do you think it means?

556
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:49,691 
l doubt it has anything to do
with the plot to assassinate Lincoln.

557
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:50,943 
[beeping]

558

<i>Mayday. Mayday. Ben, get out of there.</i>

560
00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:05,749 
- Oi! Where are my detainees?
- OK, let's make some noise.

561
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,836 
- [beeping]
- [alarm wailing]

562

The fire alarm's gone off.

563

Uh-oh. God save the queen.

- Haven't the foggiest.

- [indistinct chatter]
- [alarm blaring]

567
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:25,227 
Someone or something is causing this.

568

- Check your primary stations.
- This doesn't make any sense.

569
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:31,900 
Find the source terminal
and check public areas four and eight.

570
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:51,879 
[man] This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much. Keep moving.

571
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:55,591 
Keep walking until you're
on the other side of the fountain.

572

- Excuse me, excuse me. Coming through.
- l got them. They're at the main gate.

- OK. Here we go.

- See you later. Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Sit! Sorry!

00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,878 
Thanks for waiting for me.
Can l see the thing?

579
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:35,797 
Daniel, hold it.

580
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,635 
What is that?

581
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:42,387 
Went to Buckingham Palace,
all l got was this wood?

582
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:45,140 
Look at the symbols.
Never seen anything like this.

583
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:47,434 
lt's an incredible discovery.

- We're trapped!
- Hang on! Keep your heads down.

Whoa!

- What is that? Someone's phone.
- lt's him.

606
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:31,515 
- Have his number in your speed dial?
- Oh, shu...

This has to end
before someone gets hurt.

608

Give me what you got at Buckingham,
it won't be necessary.

609
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:38,272 
Tell that to my father.

00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:44,069 
- [man] Moron!
- [honking]

611
00:40:44,153 --> 00:40:46,613 
Why are they standing
in the middle of the street?

612
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:48,615 
- [honking]
- [screaming]

613
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:51,869 
- Where are these people going?
- Why's everyone running?

614
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:57,624 
- He's right there! Go!
- Move!

615
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:02,087 
- Get out of the way!
- [honking]

616
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:07,467 
- Did l just run over a man's foot?
- [Abigail] Watch the people!

617
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:17,728 
Go! Go! Faster!

618
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:32,201 
- Right over there.
- l got them.

619
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:36,371 
- They're still behind us.
- This phone have a camera?

620
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:39,917 
- No. No, it's broken.
- All right. Give me the plank.

621
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:46,131 
Hang on.
We're going to run a red light.

622
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:48,383 
- [honking]
- Ah! Ah!

623
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:00,812 
Hack into the London Police database
and get a picture from that traffic cam.

624
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:03,565 
- Okey-dokey.
- You can't do it?

625
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:06,443 
No, l can. l just don't like
that you assume that l can.

626
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:09,071 
[laughs] Why, thank you, Riley.

627
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,303 
Get it!

628
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:37,683 
Stop! Stop!

629
00:42:58,704 --> 00:43:00,581 
- He's got it.
- What is it?

630
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:01,165 
l don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

631
00:43:01,165 --> 00:43:03,041 
l don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

632
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:14,303 
- Abigail!
- Hey, Patrick.

633
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,431 
Nice to see you two together again.

634
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:19,725 
- Yeah, well, we're not.
- Yeah.

635
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:23,270 
Oh, l was hoping to get some
of these boxes out of the house.

636
00:43:32,362 --> 00:43:36,450 
l can't read the whole thing,
but l can tell you that

637
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:39,995 
these are definitely pre-colonial
Native American markings.

638
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:43,499 
- Easily 500 years old.
- Easily.

639
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:50,255 
l can identify one symbol.

640
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:53,383 
Look at this.
Do you know what that is?

641
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,427 
Sacred calendrical? l don't know.

642
00:43:55,886 --> 00:43:58,472 
That symbol is Cibola.

643
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:00,390 
That's Cibola.

644
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:03,810 
The City of Gold.

645
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:05,687 
The City of Gold.

646
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:12,653 
[Ben] ''ln 1 527, a Spanish ship
wrecked on the Florida coast.

647
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:14,613 
There were only four survivors.

648
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:19,660 
One was a slave named Estebàn
who saved a local tribe's dying chief.

649
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:22,579 
As a reward,
he was taken to their sacred city,

650
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:24,540 
a city built from solid gold.

651
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:30,587 
Later, when Estebàn tried to find
the city again, he never could.

652
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:36,301 
But the legend grew, and every explorer
came to the New World in search of it.

653
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:41,181 
When General Custer's search for gold
ended with his last stand

654
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:45,727 
at Little Bighorn, it became clear
none would ever find it.''

655
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,071 
Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates
got their hands on the City of Gold...

656
00:44:56,822 --> 00:44:58,282 
My God.

657
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:00,826 
l'm going to go talk to her.

658
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:07,082 
- You're coming with me.
- No!

659
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:11,420 
- Hey. No one else can translate it.
- There are others.

660
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:12,880 
There are several others.

661
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:15,257 
For ancient Native American?
No one better.

662
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,343 
- Who?
- Look, Ben, l can't go with you.

663
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:21,597 
- lt's been, what? Twenty-five years.
- Thirty-two.

664
00:45:23,307 --> 00:45:24,516 
That long?

665
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:28,937 
There's a reason
why we haven't spoken in 32 years.

666
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:31,732 
- We have nothing in common.
- Me?

667
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:36,236 
Yes, of course. And l'm sure
she's just as proud of you as l am.

668
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,697 
- Who?
- His mom.

669
00:45:41,658 --> 00:45:45,787 
- Will you relax? lt's gonna be fine.
- Sure. Should look at the bright side.

670
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:49,625 
Been a long time. Maybe she
lost her memory, won't recognize me.

671
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:51,877 
l hate her!

672
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:55,422 
We're in the right place.

673
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,720 
l'm gonna take myself
out of the line of fire for this one.

674
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:03,639 
- [Ben] Hi, Mom.
- [woman] Benjamin!

675
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,850 
Abigail! What a surprise!
Hello, sweetheart.

676
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:07,935 
Hi.

677
00:46:09,186 --> 00:46:10,145 
Oh.

678
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:15,359 
You see? One syllable,
a knife in the heart.

679
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:17,319 
- Oh, no.
- She can do that.

680
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:20,239 
l can also track the whereabouts
of my toothbrush.

681
00:46:20,322 --> 00:46:23,283 
l was not the one that left
the toothbrushes in Marrakech.

682
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:26,370 
l stowed them both
in the travel case, as instructed.

683
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:30,541 
Yes, and you also insisted
on loading the luggage into the taxi.

684
00:46:30,624 --> 00:46:33,710 
- Didn't insist. l loaded the luggage.
- Not the travel case.

685
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:37,005 
Travel case is not luggage.
The case goes into the luggage.

686
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:40,425 
- Who was in charge of packing?
- l couldn't get the case into

687
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:43,554 
the luggage. lt was full
with that stupid rug you bought.

688
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:45,722 
You thought it had secret stitching.

689
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:48,225 
- How stupid was that?
- Did have stitching.

690
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:51,687 
- Six phony green leather suitcases...
- Mom.

691
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:55,983 
l need you to take a look at this.

692
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:59,653 
- What is that a picture of?
- lt's interesting.

693
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:02,281 
- We think it might be Olmec.
- lt is.

694
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:06,076 
Yes, yes, definitely proto-Zoquean.

695
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,329 
We were hoping
that you could translate it.

696
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,665 
Yes, of course you were.

697
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:17,838 
Oh, this doesn't involve
another treasure hunt, does it?

698
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:20,716 
Mom, this is actually very important.

699
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:25,095 
All right. What have we got here?

700
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:30,559 
This... this glyph here,
that means ''bird.'' And that means...

701
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:37,608 
Uh, ''noble bird.''

702
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:40,903 
''Find the noble bird,
let him take you by the hand

703
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:44,239 
and give you passage
to the sacred temple.''

704
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:49,203 
[laughs]

705
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:54,082 
Oh, you think this is a treasure map
for Cibola, don't you?

706
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,502 
Well, that is exactly what it is.

707
00:47:56,585 --> 00:48:00,714 
No, this glyph doesn't mean ''Cibola.''
lt means ''the center of the world.''

708
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:04,676 
You know, you used to like it. She
fell in love with me on a treasure hunt.

709
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:08,430 
That was not love. That was
excitement, adrenaline and tequila.

710
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:10,307 
- [Ben] Mom...
- l was trying to get course credit.

711
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,894 
Treasure hunting paid off,
in case you haven't read the papers.

712
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:16,146 
Had nothing to do with you.
That was Ben.

713
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,524 
Ben found the treasure.
You did nothing.

714
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:23,487 
Patrick, Emily, please. Can we
just figure out what's on the page?

715
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:27,783 
Well, that's it, l'm afraid.

716
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:32,704 
These glyphs are only partials.
So you only have half a treasure map.

717
00:48:33,831 --> 00:48:35,123 
l'm sorry.

718
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,376 
Not that l'm surprised.

719
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:41,922 
[Ben] At least we know
where the rest of the map is.

720
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:43,924 
What?

721
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:46,760 
You know where it is?
Why didn't you tell me?

722
00:48:46,844 --> 00:48:49,471 
Obviously you have
a tendency to overreact!

723
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:56,061 
- l'm sorry.
- So am l.

724
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:57,604 
So where is it?

725
00:48:57,729 --> 00:49:02,317 
lnscription on the statue in Paris said,
''These twins stand resolute.''

726
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:05,904 
We think the map's divided
between the two Resolute desks.

727
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:09,491 
The Resolute desk.
The Resolute desk?

728
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:11,493 
President's desk?

729
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,871 
The president. What president?

730
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:16,874 
- Our president?
- Unfortunately, yes.

731
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:18,458 
But that means...

732
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:19,877 
Wait, so we have to...

733
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:22,337 
The White House?

734
00:49:23,714 --> 00:49:27,217 
The Oval Office... to be exact.

735
00:49:29,845 --> 00:49:31,638 
Why would l overreact to that?

736
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:40,147 
- That's not what l signed on for.
- Could we focus on the issue at hand?

737
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:43,275 
Thank you.

738
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:49,198 
[Nichols] lt's early, pre-Columbian.

739
00:49:49,281 --> 00:49:51,533 
- Can you translate it?
- Are you kidding?

740
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:54,912 
This is an extinct,
exceedingly rare language.

741
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:57,789 
Only a handful of people
study these languages.

742
00:49:57,873 --> 00:49:59,249 
Where are we to find them?

743
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:03,337 
Universities, l suppose.
But you don't have the whole thing.

744
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,379 
What do you mean?

745
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,675 
These glyphs here... they're cut off.

746
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:11,929 
There's more to the map?
How are we going to find that?

747
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:14,890 
We won't have to.
Gates will get it somehow.

748
00:50:15,224 --> 00:50:19,603 
The Resolute desk is near
the south wall in the Oval Office.

749
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:21,897 
Look at this. Look.

750
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:23,816 
Small door on the front of the desk.

751
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:27,361 
[Patrick] FDR had that put in so
guests couldn't see his wheelchair.

752
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:30,322 
- But...
- Guys, take a look at this.

753
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:33,575 
[Abigail] This could work.

754
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:37,412 
l believe it's time for you to make
a date with your new boyfriend.

755
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:39,915 
l think you're right.

756
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:46,463 
<i>[man] We hoA<i>e you're enjoying</i></i>
<i>the White House Easter Egg Roll.</i>

757
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:50,634 
<i>Face A<i>ainting continues at 2:00</i></i>
<i>near the south fountain.</i>

758
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:55,681 
- [Ben] That Connor in the bunny suit?
- Thank you.

759
00:50:55,764 --> 00:50:58,892 
l've never been to an Easter Egg Roll.
lt's kind of sweet.

760
00:50:58,976 --> 00:51:00,602 
Yeah, l love it.

761
00:51:02,146 --> 00:51:06,358 
l know you. Your great-great-grandfather
killed President Lincoln.

762
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:08,777 
No. That would be John Wilkes Booth.

763
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:11,029 
Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool

764
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:14,533 
in a greater conspiracy
that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet.

765
00:51:14,616 --> 00:51:16,952 
Absurd.
Eisenschiml's book is filled with

766
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:19,997 
- spotty research and false assumptions.
- Oh, yeah?

767
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,208 
Explain why Lincoln's bodyguard
left his post that night?

768
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:26,670 
Because President Lincoln
was never accompanied by guards

769
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:30,257 
when attending the theater. Listening?
Especially on Good Friday.

770
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,302 
Explain why all the bridges
out of Washington were closed

771
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:36,555 
except one,
the one Booth needed to escape?

772
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:39,600 
OK, run along now,
you impossible child. Run along.

773
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:43,770 
What is going on
with the education in America?

774
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:46,815 
- Hey! Hey!
- Connor!

775
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:49,359 
- l'm so glad you decided to come...
- Hey.

776
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:51,987 
- ...with Gates.
- Connor.

777
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,114 
- We just ran into each other.
- Oh.

778
00:51:58,118 --> 00:51:59,703 
Aren't you going to ask him?

779
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:01,288 
- Ask me what?
- Nothing.

780
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:04,500 
- No, really. What?
- l really wouldn't want to impose.

781
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,671 
Well, what she means is
she doesn't think you can.

782
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:12,883 
- Doesn't think l can what?
- She wants to see the Oval Office.

783
00:52:12,966 --> 00:52:16,845 
- No. That is way too much to ask.
- No, it's, uh...

784
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:20,015 
- l can do that.
- Really?

785
00:52:20,098 --> 00:52:21,099 
You see?

786
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:23,060 
- You can?
- Yeah.

787
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:27,439 
That is so cool, Connor. l have
always wanted to see the Oval Office.

788
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:29,191 
Connor rocks.

789
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:32,861 
Well... here we are.

790
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:35,322 
- Mm.
- Wow.

791
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:40,035 
Empire furnishings
and crenelated molding. Love it.

792
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:41,912 
Hm.

793
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:44,873 
Amazing feeling, isn't it,
standing in here?

794
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:47,960 
- Yes. Amazing, huh?
- Oh, could...

795
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:49,169 
Oh. Sorry.

796
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:55,425 
Oh, that's, uh... The Resolute desk.

797
00:52:56,093 --> 00:52:59,179 
Might recognize it from
the photo of young JFK Junior

798
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,849 
playing underneath
while his father was working.

799
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,767 
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

800
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:06,728 
But many people don't know

801
00:53:06,812 --> 00:53:10,274 
that this desk has a twin
that sits in Buckingham Palace.

802
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:12,359 
- lsn't that something?
- Who knew?

803
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:14,736 
Every president since
Rutherford B. Hayes

804
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:17,739 
has used that desk,
except, uh, Johnson and Nixon.

805
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:19,241 
And Ford, of course.

806
00:53:19,408 --> 00:53:21,827 
- Uh, no.
- Uh, yes.

807
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,912 
- No.
- Yes.

808
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:26,748 
Abigail! Did you lose an earring?

809
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:30,419 
Oh! l... l did, yes.

810
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:33,755 
Connor, these were given to me
by my grandmother.

811
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,634 
l suppose we should look for it.
Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring

812
00:53:37,718 --> 00:53:40,637 
that doesn't belong
to the first lady in the Oval Office.

813
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:42,097 
- Yes.
- Excellent point,

814
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:44,433 
considering we're not
supposed to be here.

815
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:47,769 
- Yeah.
- Why don't we, um, go over here

816
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:49,146 
and check it out?

817
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:52,858 
l'll check over here.

818
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:04,411 
- Do you think it fell down here?
- Yes.

819
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:14,463 
- Maybe here.
- Probably.

820
00:54:22,513 --> 00:54:24,181 
Oh, no.

821
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,357 
- You did sit on the sofa.
- Oh, the bunnies.

822
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:40,405 
Connor!

823
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:44,660 
- You found it.
- l did.

824
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:56,547 
Thank you so much!

825
00:54:57,005 --> 00:54:58,465 
Uh...

826
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:02,094 
You're just the best. Mm.

827
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:07,224 
Mm!

828
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:14,148 
Mm!

829
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,191 
Mm!

830
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,778 
- [clears throat]
- [moaning]

831
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:22,030 
[panting] Thank you.

832
00:55:25,284 --> 00:55:25,450 
OK.

833
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,285 
OK.

834
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:31,123 
- [Ben] Empty.
- [Abigail] Someone must've taken it.

835
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:34,793 
Brightest men in our country sat
at that desk for over a hundred years.

836
00:55:34,877 --> 00:55:37,004 
- Look.
- Course one of 'em found the map.

837
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:40,549 
- A symbol stamped into the wood.
- The presidential seal.

838
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:42,551 
lt's not the presidential seal.

839
00:55:42,593 --> 00:55:46,263 
The eagle's holding a scroll
instead of olive branches.

840
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:49,224 
- [Ben] l'm not sure what this is.
- [Patrick] What do we do?

841
00:55:49,308 --> 00:55:50,893 
Did none of you read my book?

842
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:55,063 
The eagle clutching the scroll.

843
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:57,232 
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah.

844
00:55:57,316 --> 00:55:59,443 
But it's not something l could tell you.

845
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:04,448 
lt's something that
l have to show you... in my book.

846
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:14,458 
- You didn't even open it?
- l was moving.

847
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:16,084 
Chapter 1 3.

848
00:56:20,923 --> 00:56:25,177 
- ''The President's Secret Book''?
- ''The President's Secret Book.''

849
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:29,431 
lt happens to be a collection
of documents for presidents

850
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:32,893 
by presidents,
and for presidents' eyes only.

851
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:36,688 
And l'm not just talking about
JFK here, guys.

852
00:56:36,772 --> 00:56:41,193 
The 1 8 and a half missing minutes
of the Watergate tapes.

853
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:45,989 
Did the Apollo really land
on the moon? Did it? Did it?

854
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:50,035 
And the coup de grâce... Area 51 .

855
00:56:50,118 --> 00:56:53,247 
Come on, Riley. That's...
that's an urban legend.

856
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:56,250 
ls it, Abigail? ls it?

857
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:58,460 
lt's just totally...

858
00:56:58,585 --> 00:56:59,795 
- Crazy?
- Yeah.

859
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:04,633 
Hm. 'Cause last time l checked,
we pretty much make our living on crazy.

860
00:57:04,716 --> 00:57:07,886 
- He's got a point.
- l guess so.

861
00:57:09,471 --> 00:57:10,514 
Same symbol.

862
00:57:10,597 --> 00:57:13,976 
Released in '66 under
the Freedom of lnformation Act.

863
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:15,811 
The eagle and the scroll,

864
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:20,149 
the secret symbol
in the President's Book.

865
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,985 
So you're saying that
whatever was on that plank

866
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:25,988 
is now in the President's Secret Book?

867
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:29,658 
[Riley] Ben.

868
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:32,452 
lf it was you trying to convince me...

869
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:36,957 
...you'd have less evidence,
and l'd already believe you by now.

870
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:43,380 
The eagle with the scroll?

871
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:48,177 
Conspiracy theorists like to believe

872
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:51,096 
that it's the symbol
for the President's Secret Book.

873
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,764 
You bought Riley's book.

874
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:56,226 
[laughs] Your friend writes a book
about government conspiracies.

875
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,770 
- You don't think we know about it?
- But is it true?

876
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:01,273 
Does the president have a secret book?

877
00:58:08,197 --> 00:58:09,448 
Do you like ducks?

878
00:58:10,908 --> 00:58:12,493 
[quacking]

879
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:14,119 
There is a book.

880
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:17,456 
Why are you telling me out here?

881
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:21,084 
Because inside, l'm a federal agent.

882
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:23,420 
Out here,
l'm talking to you as a friend.

883
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:27,883 
- Where's the President's Book kept?
- Only the current president knows.

884
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:30,552 
The book is passed
from president to president,

885
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:32,888 
and each one chooses
his own hiding place.

886
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:35,015 
You're the FBl.
Can't you get it for me?

887
00:58:35,098 --> 00:58:38,644 
Only way you'll ever see that book
is if you get elected president.

888
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:41,063 
Well, you never know.

889
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,192 
All l need is a few minutes with him.

890
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:47,861 
A few minutes? Really?

891
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:50,155 
Even if you were married
to the president,

892
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,491 
you wouldn't be able
to get a few minutes.

893
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:55,536 
Not when he's surrounded by handlers.
lf l get him alone...

894
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:57,913 
How do you expect
to get the president alone?

895
00:58:58,038 --> 00:59:01,124 
Before the Civil War,
the states were all separate.

896
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:04,962 
People used to say,
''The United States are.''

897
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:10,342 
Wasn't until the war ended people
started saying, ''The United States is.''

898
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:16,723 
Under Lincoln... we became one nation.

899
00:59:16,807 --> 00:59:18,976 
And Lincoln paid for it with his life.

900
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:21,562 
- So did Thomas Gates.
- Right.

901
00:59:22,688 --> 00:59:23,939 
With his life.

902
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,403 
So how am l gonna get him alone?

903
00:59:33,157 --> 00:59:34,408 
l'm gonna kidnap him.

904
00:59:36,034 --> 00:59:39,037 
l'm gonna kidnap
the president of the United States.

905
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:42,624 
[laughs]

906
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:44,793 
- That's not funny.
- l'm your father.

907
00:59:44,877 --> 00:59:48,130 
How do you expect me to respond?
l can't let you ruin your life.

908
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:50,174 
Are you out of your mind?

909
00:59:50,257 --> 00:59:53,302 
Read my book, and you'd know
you can't get to that book.

910
00:59:53,385 --> 00:59:55,804 
Exactly how do you plan on doing this?

911
00:59:57,139 --> 00:59:58,807 
- l was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

912
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:00,017 
- l was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

913
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,311 
- What?
- l'm in.

914
01:00:02,478 --> 01:00:05,230 
[man] Sir, we have to move the party.

915
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:08,192 
Some historian claims

918
01:00:14,364 --> 01:00:18,494 
They want a quote on, ''ls the president
being insensitive to minority issues?''

919
01:00:18,535 --> 01:00:21,663 
- Doesn't matter.
- Get a list of approved alternates.

920
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:24,416 
- What do you have?
- Yeah, l know it's short notice.

921
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,170 
The pipe burst in the hotel
that we previously booked.

922
01:00:28,253 --> 01:00:33,300 
- l... There is water everywhere.

The Denby Hotel is available,
and so is Mount Vernon.

926
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:46,146 
- Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver.
- The Denby is great.

927
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:49,399 
Strike that. The Denby was booked.
Mount Vernon's all we got.

928
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:51,693 
Book it before someone else does.

929
01:00:53,237 --> 01:00:56,323 
[cheering, applause]

930
01:00:56,406 --> 01:00:58,992 
And let me say
what an honor it is to be here

931
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:01,370 
and add my happy birthday to you,
Mr. President.
