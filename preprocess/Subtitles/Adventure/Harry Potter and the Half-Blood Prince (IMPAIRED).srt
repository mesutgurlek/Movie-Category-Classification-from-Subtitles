And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

It's terribly tricky to make.

384

And this is Amortentia...

385

...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

386

It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

387
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,791
For example, I smell...

388
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,399
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

389
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,757
...spearmint toothpaste.

390
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,430
SLUGHORN: Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

391
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,390
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

392
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:15,954
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

-Liquid luck.
-Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

399

Desperately tricky to make,

one sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

You knew him, didn't you, sir,

01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,793
okay, sorry. Um, kidding.

777
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,119
I'll ask someone I like.

I've never been to this part of the castle.

At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.

That's why I wear shoes to bed.

787
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,079
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

788
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:34,232
It's okay, though. He's got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.

789
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,073
-oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
-okay.

01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,913
Hermione. What are you doing?.
And what happened to you?.

791
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:55,154
I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

792
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,232
Cormac?. That's who you invited?.

793
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,789
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

than a Snarfalump plant.

-Dragon tartare?.
-No, I'm fine. Thank you.

doesn't she?.

-From Professor Dumbledore.

-You're afraid, Draco.

Positive. Why?.

837
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,996
Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

...so he could find out
what he was up to?.

Dumbledore wants it.

...what you and Ron saw in summer...

...the object
that Draco is so interested in...

882
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,113
...is a vanishing cabinet.

1241
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,956
I'm going to tell you something.

1242
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:39,673
Something others have only guessed at.

1243
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:42,993
It's true.

1244
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:44,788
I am the Chosen One.

1245
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,876
only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

1246
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:51,191
...I need to know what T om Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

1247
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,635
...and I need to know what you told him.

1248
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,629
Be brave, professor.

1249
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,191
Be brave like my mother.

1250
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:04,000
otherwise, you disgrace her.

1251
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:07,275
otherwise, she died for nothing.

1252
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:13,234
otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

1253
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:26,352
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1254
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:31,431
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

1255
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:09,274
RIDDLE:
I was in the library the other night...

1256
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,510
...in the Restricted Section...

1257
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:15,830
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1258
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:19,719
It's called, as I understand it...

1259
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,234
...a Horcrux.

1260
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,639
-I beg your pardon?.
-Horcrux.

1261
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:29,600
I came across the term while reading...

1262
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:32,638
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1263
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,472
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

1264
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:37,108
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

1265
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:38,759
Which is...

1266
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,592
...why I came to you.

1267
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:49,713
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1268
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:52,394
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1269
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:58,714
one splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1270
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:02,350
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1271
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:03,589
Protected?.

1272
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:06,832
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1273
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,549
In other words, you cannot die.

1274
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:20,477
And how does one split his soul, sir?.

1275
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:23,313
SLUGHORN: I think you already know
the answer to that, T om.

1276
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,913
Murder.

1277
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,674
Yes.

1278
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:32,910
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1279
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:38,311
RIDDLE: Can you only split the soul
once?. For instance, isn't seven...?.

1280
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,913
Seven?.

1281
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:45,714
Merlin's beard, T om. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?.

1282
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:49,475
T o rip the soul into seven pieces....

1283
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:53,512
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, T om?.
All academic?.

1284
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,354
of course, sir.

1285
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,111
It'll be our little secret.

1286
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:13,754
HARRY:
Sir.

1287
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:30,556
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1288
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:33,280
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?.

1289
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:36,432
oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1290
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:37,589
What are they exactly?.

1291
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:40,957
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1292
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,638
A ring, for example.

1293
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:47,673
or a book.

1294
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:51,195
-T om Riddle's diary.
-It's a Horcrux, yes.

1295
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,716
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1296
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:56,075
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1297
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,071
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1298
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:03,030
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1299
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:05,111
-The ring?.
-Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1300
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:10,031
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1301
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:13,909
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux....

1302
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,195
one destroys Voldemort.

1303
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:18,158
But how would you find them?.
They could be hidden anywhere.

1304
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:21,437
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1305
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:36,637
...leaves traces.

1306
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:46,111
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?.

1307
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:48,475
-When you leave the school?.
-Yes.

1308
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:52,238
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1309
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:56,313
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1310
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:02,271
once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1311
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,275
SNAPE: Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1312
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:10,954
...that you take too much for granted?.

1313
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:15,955
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?.

1314
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:18,156
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1315
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:24,552
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1316
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:43,758
oh, Harry.

1317
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:48,470
You need a shave, my friend.

1318
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:55,199
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1319
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:59,148
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1320
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,915
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1321
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,793
I'm an old man.

1322
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:06,552
You still look the same to me, sir.

1323
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:10,838
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1324
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,072
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1325
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:21,032
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1326
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:24,556
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1327
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:26,472
But there is one condition:

1328
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:29,712
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1329
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,118
Yes, sir.

1330
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:34,316
You do understand what I'm saying?.

1331
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,269
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1332
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,670
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1333
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:43,674
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1334
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:50,153
Your word, Harry.

1335
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,153
My word.

1336
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,512
Take my arm.

1337
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:59,189
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1338
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,150
Well, being me has its privileges.

1339
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:50,038
DUMBLEDORE:
This is the place.

1340
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,313
oh, yes.

1341
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:55,668
This place has known magic.

1342
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:04,839
-Sir!
-In order to gain passage...

1343
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,353
...payment must be made.

1344
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:09,990
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1345
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,272
-You should've let me, sir.
-No, Harry.

1346
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:16,314
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1347
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:41,757
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1348
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:45,117
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1349
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:48,953
Careful.

1350
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:12,589
There it is.

1351
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:16,634
The only question is,
how do we get there?.

1352
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,672
If you would, Harry.

1353
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:27,349
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?.

1354
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:29,279
oh, yes.

1355
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,433
It has to be drunk.

1356
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:44,319
All of it has to be drunk.

1357
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:48,317
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?.

1358
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,789
This potion might paralyze me.

1359
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:52,792
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1360
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:56,711
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

1361
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:58,791
You are not to indulge these requests.

1362
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:02,350
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1363
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,875
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

1364
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:07,356
-Understood?.
-Why can't I drink it, sir?.

1365
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:12,719
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.

1366
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:18,471
Your good health, Harry.

1367
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:35,188
Professor.

1368
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:38,389

01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,789
HARRY:
Professor, can you hear me?.

1372
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:51,155
Professor.

1373
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:07,029
No. Don't.

1374
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:09,430
You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?.

1375
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:20,117
DUMBLEDORE: Stop.
-It will stop. It will stop...

1376
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:24,512
-...but only if you keep drinking.
-Please, don't make me.

1377
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:26,716
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Please.

1378
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:29,075
-Kill me. Kill me!
-No!

It's my fault.

It's all my fault.

one more, and then I promise...
