1
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,357
Long ago, in ancient China,

2
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,735
the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.

3
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,365
They brought great joy
and prosperity to the city

4
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,868
for they had invented fireworks.

5
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,999
But their son, Lord Shen,

6
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,586
saw darker power in the fireworks.

7
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,298
What had brought colour and joy

8
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,845
could also bring darkness
and destruction.

9
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,807
Shen's troubled parents
consulted a soothsayer.

10
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:03,271
She foretold that if Shen
continued down this dark path,

11
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,443
he would be defeated
by a warrior of black and white.

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,197
The young lord
set out to change his fate.

13
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:18,202
But what he did next only sealed it.

14
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,086
Shen returned to his parents
full of pride.

15
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:31,382
But in their faces, he saw only horror.

16
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,970
He was banished from the city forever.

17
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,348
But Shen swore revenge.

18
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,351
Someday he would return

19
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,397
and all of China would bow at his feet.

20
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,765
It's almost done, Lord Shen,
but we've run out of metal.

21
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,854
Search the farthest villages!
Find more metal!

22
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,898
China will be mine.

23
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,245
And then the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five!

24
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,289
And they became the most
awesomest kung fu team ever!

25
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,291
Enough talk. Let's fight!

26
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:49,627
- Thirty-three...
- Listen, listen!

27
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,129
You can hear the Dragon Warrior
training right now!

28
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,714
Thirty-three. Stop him!

29
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,132
- Thirty-four.
- It's too dangerous!

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,635
- Thirty-five. Stay focused.
- Thirty-six!

31
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,470
- Thirty-seven!
- Yeah!

32
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,098
How is he doing that with his face?

33
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,437
Thirty-eight bean buns!

34
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,148
Yes! New record! You monster!

35
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,609
- Keep going! Hit 40!
- He'll never hit 40.

36
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,987
You guys wait and we'll go to 40.

37
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,280
Do it.

38
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,865
No problem!

39
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,619
Yeah!

40
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,163
Give me a minute.

41
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,833
Yeah!

42
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,044
- He did it!
- Well done, Po!

43
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,047
Your training has paid off.

44
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,426
Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!

45
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,512
You'll save those for me, right?

46
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,355
Flippety-do.

47
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,992
Inner peace.

48
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,755
Master Shifu.

49
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,633
Master Shifu, what do we got?

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,719
Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

51
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,932
Whatever it is, I will take them down.
'Cause I am in a mood.

52
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,517
I need to get something done,
you know what I mean?

53
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,687
What are you doing?

54
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,274
One of Master Oogway's final teachings.

55
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,556
Awesome!

56
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,643
How did you do that?

57
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,814
- Inner peace.
- Inner piece. That's cool.

58
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,694
- Inner piece of what?
- It is the next phase of your training.

59
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:25,324
Every master must find his path
to inner peace.

60
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:29,662
Some choose to meditate for 50 years
in a cave just like this...

61
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,834
...without the slightest taste
of food or water.

62
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,670
Or?

63
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,298
Some find it through
pain and suffering, as I did.

64
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,844
Po, the day you were chosen
as Dragon Warrior

65
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,846
was the worst day of my life.

66
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,266
By far.
Nothing else came close.

67
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:54,812
It was the worst, most painful,
mind-destroying, horrible moment...

68
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,440
- OK.
- ...I have ever experienced.

69
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:05,531
But once I realised the problem
was not you, but within me,

70
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,287
I found inner peace and was able
to harness the flow of the universe.

71
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,998
So that's it? I just need inner peace?

72
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,292
My innards are
already super, super peaceful,

73
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,879
so all I need to do
is just get this thing going.

74
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,006
Inner peace, you're going down.

75
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,966
Now show me what you were
doing there with your feet.

76
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,217
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...

77
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,387
Po! Bandits!
Approaching the Musicians Village.

78
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,638
Danger.

79
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,726
Tell those musicians to start playing
some action music because it is on.

80
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,270
Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master
inner peace as soon as I get back.

81
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,064
No snack stops this time.

82
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,941
Snack stops.

83
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,818
Wait, are you serious?

84
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,458
Get all the metal you can find!

85
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,797
Grab the metal!

86
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,638
Help, help, help, help. Help!

87
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,102
That's everything!
Let's get out of here.

88
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,395
Oh, no.

89
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,736
Wings of Justice!

90
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,923
The Dragon Warrior!

91
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,384
A panda? That's impossible.

92
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,469
My fist hungers for justice.

93
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,347
That was my... fist.

94
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,850
- Get 'em!
- Come on!

95
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,416
Take that!

96
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,428
Po! Incoming!

97
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,430
Thanks, Mantis!

98
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,700
Tigress, Double Death Strike!

99
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,543
Feet of Fury!

100
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,383
Tigress! Monkey!

101
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,510
Viper! Mantis!

102
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,512
Bunny! What?

103
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,514
Oh, sorry.

104
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,605
Help!

105
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,691
- Crane, go!
- I'm on it!

106
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,420
Is everyone OK?

107
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,006
That was awesome!

108
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,802
I got this.

109
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,398
Po!

110
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,197
Chew on that, tubby!

111
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,705
Help.

112
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,126
- Sweetie, are you OK?
- What happened?

113
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,462
I think I saw...

114
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,965
I think...

115
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,550
I gotta go.

116
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:42,141
Thank you. Thank you for coming
to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

117
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,059
- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.

118
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,979
If you need anything, just ask.

119
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,858
- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury!

120
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:55,487
The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He mopped these very floors!

121
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,991
No touching!
You'll get the mop dirty.

122
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,493
- He once waited on me.
- Awesome!

123
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,581
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it.
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?

124
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,083
He doesn't work here any more.

125
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,754
He's busy out there
protecting the Valley.

126
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,422
- The Dragon Warrior!
- There he is.

127
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,631
Po!

128
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,261
- Here. OK. Nice kid.
- The Dragon Warrior!

129
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,680
- You should've told me you were coming.
- Hi, Dad.

130
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,099
I would have saved you some stinky tofu.

131
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,771
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.

132
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:35,110
In honour of my son,
free tofu dessert for everybody!

133
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,154
With purchases.

134
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,949
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.

135
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,745
Have you lost weight? I can
almost put my wings around you.

136
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,580
Ah, well, maybe a little.

137
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:50,584
Poor you, you must feel weak.
Let me get you some soup.

138
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,336
No, that's OK, Dad.
I'm not hungry.

139
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,172
Not hungry?
Po, are you all right?

140
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,299
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...

141
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,802
Earlier today,
I was fighting these bandits.

142
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,222
Nothing too dangerous.
I mean, they were just, you know...

143
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,350
- Yeah?
- And then the strangest thing happened.

144
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,227
I had this crazy vision.

145
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:12,189
I think I saw my mom and me,
as a baby.

146
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,983
Mom? A baby?

147
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,488
- Dad?
- What...?

148
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,698
How do I say this?

149
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,202
Where did I come from?

150
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:34,878
Well, you see, son,
baby geese come from a little egg.

151
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,716
- Don't ask me where the egg comes from.
- Dad, that's not what I meant.

152
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,095
I know it's not.

153
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:48,559
I think it's time I told you something
I should have told you a long time ago.

154
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,519
OK.

155
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,523
You might have been kind of a...

156
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,695
...adopted.

157
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,697
- I knew it.
- You knew?

158
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,825
- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.

159
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,828
But if you knew,
why didn't you ever say anything?

160
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,872
Why didn't you say anything?

161
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,877
How did I get here, Dad?
Where did I come from?

162
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:20,048
Actually... you came from this.

163
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,805
It was just another day
at the restaurant.

164
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,599
Time to make the noodles.

165
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:33,896
I went out to the back, where my
vegetables had just been delivered.

166
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,773
There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.

167
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,569
Only there were no radishes.

168
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:44,156
Just a very hungry baby panda.

169
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,744
There was no note.

170
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,954
Of course, you could have eaten it.

171
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:56,126
I waited for someone to come
looking for you, but no one did.

172
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,110
I brought you inside.

173
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,989
Fed you.

174
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,159
Gave you a bath.

175
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,164
And fed you again.

176
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,252
And again.

177
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,131
And tried to put some pants on you.

178
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,686
And then I made a decision
that would change my life forever.

179
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,983
To make my soup without radishes.

180
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,404
And to raise you as my own son.

181
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:09,783
Xiao Po, my little panda.

182
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:15,330
And from that moment on,
both my soup and my life

183
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,666
have been that much sweeter.

184
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,837
And, little Po,
that's the end of the story.

185
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,174
Look at me. No, don't look at me.

186
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,846
That's it? That can't be it.
There's gotta be more, Dad!

187
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:35,225
Well, there was the time
you ate all my bamboo furniture.

188
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,394
It was imported, too.

189
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,731
One dumpling, please,
Dragon Warrior size.

190
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,948
Oh, Po, your story may not
have such a happy beginning,

191
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,617
but look how it turned out.

192
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,537
You got me, you got kung fu,
and you got noodles.

193
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,373
I know. I just have so many questions.

194
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,959
Like how did I ever fit
in this tiny basket?

195
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,794
Why didn't I like pants?

196
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,132
And who am I?

197
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,224
Good. Watch your form.

198
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,395
Good.

199
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,775
Better. Elbow.

200
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,943
Straighten it out!

201
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,930
Shen?

202
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:58,058
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

203
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:02,979
Now we've got the pleasantries
out of the way, please leave my house.

204
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,273
- Your house?
- Yes.

205
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,943
Didn't you see the peacock
on the front door?

206
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,072
There you are, Soothsayer.

207
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:17,411
It seems your fortune-telling skills
are not as good as you thought.

208
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,581
- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.

209
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,292
- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?

210
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,964
What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!

211
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,800
Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the Masters' Council,

212
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,804
and we will protect it. Even from you.

213
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:40,225
I'm so glad you feel that way.

214
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,228
Otherwise, I'd have dragged
that here for nothing.

215
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,439
What's in the box, Shen?

216
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:49,151
You want to see? It's a gift.

217
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:53,113
It's your parting gift,
in that it will part you.

218
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,823
Part of you here, part of you there

219
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,952
and part of you way over there,
staining the wall!

220
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,121
You insolent fool!

221
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,641
- Show-off.
- That is a warning.

222
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,644
You are no match for our kung fu.

223
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,772
I agree.

224
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,648
But this is.

225
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,373
Are you familiar
with the master of Gongmen City?

226
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,875
- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.

227
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,628
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.

228
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,756
And slayer of the Ten Thousand
Serpents in the Valley of Woe?

229
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,966
- He's dead.
- Whoa.

230
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,343
That's impossible.

231
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,970
Rhino's Horn Defence
is impervious to any technique.

232
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,641
It was no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon,

233
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,227
one that breathes fire and spits metal.

234
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:10,732
Unless he is stopped,
this could be the end of kung fu.

235
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,278
- But I just got kung fu!
- And now you must save it.

236
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:19,366
Go! Destroy this weapon
and bring Lord Shen to justice!

237
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,368
OK, here we go! Here we go!

238
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,247
Wait a second.
How can I do this?

239
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,041
I mean, how can kung fu stop
something that stops kung fu?

240
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,126
Remember, Dragon Warrior,

241
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,672
anything is possible
when you have inner peace.

242
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,097
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.

243
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,015
Peace on.

244
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,226
- Oh, Po?
- Peace!

245
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,520
Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.

246
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,773
I packed you food for weeks.
Cookies, buns, vegetables.

247
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,193
And I even packed
all your action figures. See?

248
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,575
I don't know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.

249
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,618
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

250
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,663
I also packed your paintings
of our best time together,

251
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,374
just in case you get lonely.

252
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,378
That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.

253
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,964
And that's me giving you
a piggyback ride.

254
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,385
That cute? On second thought,
I'll hang on to this one.

255
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,431
- Hey, they're waiting for me.
- Of course, of course.

256
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,767
You have a job to do... far from home,

257
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,646
in a strange city, filled with
strange people, and strange noodles,

258
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,567
facing horrible danger
from which you might never return!

259
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,320
- Don't go, Po!
- I gotta go.

260
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,781
I'm the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save kung fu.

261
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,910
And if I don't... what am I?

262
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,537
You're my son.

263
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,333
Right?

264
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,754
- Po, it's time.
- Goodbye.

265
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,257
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

266
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,801
He'll be back before
you can say "noodles".

267
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,517
Noodles.

268
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,776
Come on, guys, let's go!

269
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,152
Yeah!

270
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,531
Yeah...

271
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,451
Yeah, yeah. Yeah...

272
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,532
Mama?

273
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,582
Mom? Dad? Is that you?

274
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,084
Mom! Dad!

275
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,422
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.

276
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,800
Honey, what are you doing here?

277
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:06,968
But I thought...

278
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:10,096
We replaced you, dear,
with this lovely radish.

279
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:14,309
- Radish?
- It's quiet, polite, and, frankly,

280
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,853
does better kung fu.

281
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,730
No. No, no, no.

282
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,818
Wait!

283
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,076
No.

284
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,295
Radish, radish, radish, radish.

285
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,680
Inner pea...

286
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,559
Pea...

287
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,605
Inner peace.

288
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:21,793
Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace!
Inner peace! Inner peace...!

289
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,717
I'm... training.

290
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,178
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

291
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,226
- I am ready.
- OK.

292
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,395
So serious.

293
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,196
I think I prefer the mast.

294
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:55,076
Apologies. I used to punch the
ironwood trees by the palace to train.

295
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,578
Now I feel nothing.

296
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,622
That's severely cool.

297
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:03,585
Again!

298
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:10,508
So, this punching ironwood trees,
how long did you have to do that?

299
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,428
- Twenty years.
- Oh, 20, 20 years.

300
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,598
Is there any, you know, faster way?

301
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,475
You know, until you, you know,
don't feel anything?

302
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,603
No. Besides...

303
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,610
...I don't think
hard style is your thing.

304
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,742
Po, why are you really out here?

305
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,455
I just found out that my dad
isn't really my dad.

306
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,334
Your dad? The goose.

307
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,214
That must have been quite a shock.

308
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,299
Yeah.

309
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,302
- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?

310
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,472
We're warriors, right?
Nerves of steel.

311
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,599
Souls of platinum.

312
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:00,975
Like you.

313
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,102
So hard-core, you don't feel anything.

314
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,651
- I was...
- So, what are you guys talking about?

315
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,320
Nothing. Nothing.

316
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,656
Po's having daddy issues.

317
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,909
I'm so lucky.
I don't have any problems with my dad.

318
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,453
Maybe it's because Mom
ate his head before I was born.

319
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,456
- I don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.

320
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,667
Po is the one freaking out.

321
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,002
- I'm not freaking out.
- Po.

322
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,380
- I'm freaking in.
- Po!

323
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,216
- What?
- We're here.

324
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,343
Gongmen City.

325
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:54,237
My father's throne.

326
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:57,448
He used to let me play here beside him,

327
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:02,120
promising someday,
this throne would be mine.

328
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,251
A little to the left.

329
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,545
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!

330
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:14,007
Thirty years I've waited
for this moment.

331
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,677
Everything must be exactly
how I envisioned it.

332
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:21,556
And I envisioned it
a little to the left.

333
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,766
Perfect!

334
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,145
With the weapon by my si...
A little bit more.

335
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:35,069
With the weapon by my side,
all of China will bow before me.

336
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,904
We move out in three days,

337
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,908
when the moon is full
and the tide is high.

338
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,705
Now, you old goat,
why don't you tell me my...

339
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:46,914
Fortune?

340
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,793
Future. I was going to say future.

341
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:55,340
Look into your bowl
and tell me what glory awaits.

342
00:27:57,051 --> 00:28:00,595
If you continue on your current path...

343
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,934
...you will find yourself
at the bottom of the stairs.

344
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:14,233
I see...

345
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:18,446
I see pain... and anger.

346
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,616
How dare you!
That is the finest silk in the province!

347
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:22,909
Followed by denial.

348
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,620
This is not fortune-telling.
You're just saying

349
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,789
- what's happening right...
- Now?

350
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,126
The most important time is now.

351
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,797
But if you really want
to see the future...

352
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,343
Oh, what do you see?

353
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,101
A peacock...

354
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:53,481
...is defeated by a warrior
of black and white.

355
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,692
Nothing has changed.

356
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,785
That's impossible, and you know it.

357
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:09,163
It is not impossible, and he knows it.

358
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,623
Who?

359
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,793
- Lord Shen! I saw a panda!
- A panda?

360
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,339
A kung fu warrior.
It fought like a demon!

361
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,133
Big and furry.

362
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,469
Soft and squishy.
Kind of plush and cuddly.

363
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:27,265
There are no more pandas.

364
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,768
Even with his poor eyesight,
he can see the truth.

365
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,813
Why is it that you cannot?

366
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,859
Find this panda and bring him to me!

367
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,777
Yes, sir!

368
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:43,781
One panda lives.
That does not make you right.

369
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:47,785
You're right.
Being right makes me right.

370
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,331
Then I will kill him and make you wrong.

371
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,461
Will you stop that!

372
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,601
That must be Shen's palace
on the other side of the city.

373
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,312
Great. We'll march into the tower
and proclaim,

374
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,522
"We are the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five,

375
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,691
and we are here
to bring you to justice!"

376
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,780
What are you doing?
This place is crawling with wolves.

377
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,872
Hey, isn't that the guy
who hammered you in the face?

378
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,919
I do not like that guy.

379
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,714
We need to get to that tower
without being spotted by those wolves.

380
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,383
Got it. Stealth mode.

381
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,034
- Get out of the way!
- Foiled again.

382
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,871
Now, where'd those noodles go?

383
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,213
Hello. I couldn't help but...

384
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,299
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?

385
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,469
- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?

386
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,391
OK.

387
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,899
Guys! Guys?

388
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,776
- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.

389
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,444
So that was stealth mode, huh?

390
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,072
To be honest,
not one of my stronger modes.

391
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,658
...gold in there, come on!

392
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,286
This rice is raw!

393
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,997
You stole all my metal pots
for Lord Shen!

394
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,333
Either you cook my rice, or I cook you!

395
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,253
- My apologies, but...
- Po, do something.

396
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,922
How am I supposed to help her cook rice
without getting caught?

397
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,133
- Wait, I have a better idea.
- ...two...

398
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,509
...one.

399
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,303
- Hey.
- Hey.

400
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,025
We're here to liberate the city
and bring Shen to justice.

401
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,901
- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep,

402
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,528
but it's too dangerous. I can't let you.

403
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:30,865
Oh, no, not me.
It's not safe to speak here.

404
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,491
Right.

405
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,371
I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.

406
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,916
They're in Gongmen Jail
on Black Dragon Alley.

407
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,710
What? They're still alive?

408
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,879
They must be in that jail
gathering intelligence,

409
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,757
hatching a plot to use their
awesomeness to defeat the weapon!

410
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,592
OK, let's go!

411
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,845
- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey! Stop that costume!

412
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,305
- Hold it right there!
- Get them!

413
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,724
- Get them!
- Sorry!

414
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,060
Take that!

415
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,811
- Keep going!
- Faster!

416
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:02,897
Hey, stop!

417
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,086
- Look out! Watch it!
- Sorry!

418
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,337
Surround him.

419
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,257
Now!

420
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,176
Gotcha!

421
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,470
What? Where'd he go?

422
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,431
- Spread out! Search everywhere!
- What about over there?

423
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,560
- Is "there" a part of "everywhere"?
- I... I guess.

424
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,187
Then search there!

425
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:51,612
They must be close. I can feel
a kung fu chill riding up my spine.

426
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,781
Sorry, Po. It's just me.

427
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,951
Look. Gongmen Jail.

428
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,373
Aw, it's cute.

429
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,834
Cute, huh?

430
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,678
Nice work, Po.

431
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,765
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.

432
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,102
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.

433
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,646
Excuse me,
when have I ever made that noise?

434
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,774
Master Ox! Master!

435
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,486
The ferocious Master Croc!

436
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,824
And Master Storming Ox.

437
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,661
I can't believe we're rescuing
actual legends of kung fu.

438
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,830
We're gonna free you from those
bonds of injustice. No problem.

439
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,624
Gotta be a key around here. No,
they wouldn't leave a key around here.

440
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,879
Oh, good! You found it.
Come on, you guys! Yeah!

441
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,047
We're coming for you, Shen!

442
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,765
Guys, are we going or not?
Do you want to meet us there later?

443
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,683
I mean, you do want to
take back your city, right?

444
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,560
Of course we do.

445
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:08,564
But if we stand up to Shen,
he will turn the weapon on the city.

446
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,524
Listen to yourself.
You're protecting Gongmen City

447
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,485
by not protecting Gongmen City?

448
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:17,281
- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.

449
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:21,202
Oh, would it?
Then we use... a sneak attack!

450
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,954
- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...

451
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,709
...by the unstoppable weapon.

452
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,212
Nothing's unstoppable except for me
when I'm stopping you

453
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,881
from telling me something's unstoppable!

454
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,436
Master Ox,
I'm not letting you stay in this cell.

455
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,146
I'd like to see you get me out!

456
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,112
You guys see that?
It's called being awesome.

457
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,156
Come on! Whatever
happened to being heroes?

458
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:02,076
The only hero in this town
is a dead one!

459
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:10,376
Like I said, you are not
getting me out of this cell!

460
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,964
Yes!

461
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,007
All right, let's go!

462
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,093
I get the top bunk.

463
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:25,432
It's time to surrender, panda.
Kung fu is dead.

464
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,101
I...

465
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,313
You...

466
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,650
Kung fu is dead? Fine!

467
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:38,279
You stay in your prison of fear
with bars made of hopelessness.

468
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,657
And all you get are three
square meals a day of shame!

469
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,450
With despair for dessert.

470
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,787
We'll take on Shen and prove
to all those who are hungry

471
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:50,875
for justice and honour
that kung fu still lives!

472
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,418
Yeah!

473
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,672
Monkey?!

474
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,550
You! You're mine!

475
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,677
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!

476
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,763
My fist in your plush, cuddly,
super-soft face!

477
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,809
Get him!

478
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,061
- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir!

479
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,272
Stop him!

480
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,568
Faster!

481
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,157
Yeah! Go, go!

482
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,826
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!

483
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,830
- Viper!
- Hang on!

484
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,009
- What?
- Watch out!

485
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,680
Uncool! Very uncool!

486
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,850
Try this!

487
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,185
Guys, guys, guys!

488
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,025
Maybe something smaller!

489
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,694
No, no! Oh, no, no.

490
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,993
Cute bunnies, off the face.
Excuse me! OK, pardon me!

491
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,338
Fire!

492
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,548
We've lost them.

493
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,518
Again! Again!

494
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,895
Crane, catch!

495
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Gotcha!

496
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,703
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
give me a shove!

497
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,414
Mantis, now!

498
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:10,681
Is that all you got? It feels like
I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!

499
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,100
Well, this cloud is about
to bring the thunder!

500
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,438
Your turn!

501
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:23,110
Why... are... there...
so... many... signs?!

502
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,253
Come here! Alaka-squasho!

503
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,924
Yes! Taste the defeat!

504
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,468
Let me tell you something.

505
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,637
Next time you mess with a panda,
you better bring a whole a...

506
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,232
Guess nobody told you,

507
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,319
if you mess with the wolf,
you get the fangs.

508
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,698
I've hit you twice.
What are you going to do now?

509
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,536
We surrender!

510
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:22,294
You can chain my body, but you will
never chain my... warrior spirit.

511
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,963
- Hey, don't forget the little guy.
- Did you just call...?

512
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:28,300
- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...

513
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,846
No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?

514
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:36,266
Just like the ones that held Tai Lung.
The more you move, the tighter they get.

515
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,186
These are the best cuffs!

516
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,358
Greetings, panda. At last we meet!

517
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,569
No, no, no...

518
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,868
We meet at last! Yes, that's it.

519
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,538
Greetings, panda. We meet at...

520
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,793
- You are afraid for a reason.
- I am not afraid.

521
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,712
He is coming to me in chains.

522
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,382
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.

523
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,012
Don't even think about it.

524
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,987
I hope this turns out better than
your plan to cook rice in your stomach

525
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,489
by eating it raw
and then drinking boiling water.

526
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,741
This plan's nothing like that plan.

527
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,035
- How?
- 'Cause this one's going to work.

528
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,592
Keep moving.

529
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,850
Ah, my old enemy...

530
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,440
...stairs.

531
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,971
Thanks for carrying me
those last few flights. OK.

532
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,557
I threw up a little bit
on the third floor.

533
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,142
Someone might want to clean that up.

534
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,978
Is there some sort of evil janitor
or something?

535
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,730
Greetings, panda.

536
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,233
- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?

537
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:52,361
Hey.

538
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,530
You've grown up bigger than I thought.

539
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,408
Hey... enough with the poking around.

540
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,328
Strong. Healthy.

541
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,164
Look, I don't know who you are,
but please stand aside, sir.

542
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,792
- That's a lady.
- Oh! Sorry.

543
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,670
The beard threw me.
It's kind of misleading.

544
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,923
- False advertising.
- Enough of this nonsense!

545
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,758
Bring the prisoners to me.

546
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,551
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.

547
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,263
Keep your eyes peeled for the...
weapon!

548
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:24,893
Sparrow kick!

549
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,107
We did it! I just kung fu-ed it!
Did you guys see that? I was all like...

550
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:42,536
Do you actually believe this is
the warrior destined to defeat me?

551
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:45,872
I do not. I know he is.

552
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,627
Oh, look at him.
A lifetime to plot his revenge

553
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:54,298
- and he comes to me on his knees.
- What? A lifetime?

554
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,716
I did not have a lifetime.

555
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,843
We only heard about Master Rhino
a few days ago,

556
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:02,723
- and we came to avenge him!
- You've come to avenge nothing else?

557
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,392
Well, yeah.
All the pots and pans that you stole.

558
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,978
- I'm gonna want those back.
- Nothing else?

559
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,731
You probably did some other evil stuff
along the way. I don't know.

560
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,066
- What else did you do?
- You don't know?

561
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,444
Know what? What's so funny?

562
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,739
The very thing
that you clearly do not know!

563
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:22,826
OK, enough of these riddles!
Would you guys spill the beans?

564
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:26,330
First, we come in and the weapon
is tiny. Surprise, it's big.

565
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,499
And then the lady over here,
I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...

566
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,378
The only reason you are still alive

567
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:38,342
is that I find your stupidity
mildly amusing.

568
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,845
Well, thank you. But I find your
evilness extremely annoying.

569
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,889
Who do you think you are, panda?

570
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:46,767
Who do you think I am, peacock?

571
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,527
Why are we laughing?

572
00:44:58,571 --> 00:44:59,738
Take aim.

573
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,834
Fire.

574
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,716
Well, light the... thing!

575
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,468
I did!

576
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,100
Fear the bug!

577
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,610
Get the weapon!

578
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,489
Tigress!

579
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,773
You... You were there.

580
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,860
Yes. Yes, I was.

581
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:30,871
- You just let Shen get away!
- At least we destroyed the weapon.

582
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,918
Fire!

583
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:41,715
Oh. No, he's got way more.

584
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,431
- My wing!
- Help, Po!

585
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,016
Coming!

586
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:54,311
- Watch out!
- Po!

587
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:00,484
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.

588
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,194
Use the ropes.

589
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,163
Run, run, little panda!

590
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:27,511
- Po, come on. We need you to focus!
- I got it, I got it!

591
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,304
Bring it down!

592
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,060
- We're trapped!
- This way!

593
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,941
Goodbye!

594
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,320
Fire!

595
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,198
Get back!

596
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:58,250
The only way out is up.

597
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,377
What?

598
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:14,266
Follow me! Come on!

599
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,767
Where are they going?

600
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,770
- To the top!
- Come on! Keep going!

601
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,571
Here we go!

602
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,593
- You idiot!
- My nose!

603
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,180
Call in the wolves! All of them!
I want them ready to move!

604
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,976
The Year of the Peacock begins now!

605
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:01,021
Right now?
'Cause it's the middle of the year,

606
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,857
so you'd only get like
a half of the Year of the Peacock.

607
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,778
And this is the Year, of course,
of the Peacock.

608
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,947
Happy New Year, sir.

609
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:19,039
Get the wolves ready.
We're loading the ships now.

610
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,290
Now!

611
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,375
Now, now, now, now, now!

612
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,337
Move! Move, move, move, move!

613
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,355
This way.

614
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:49,569
Let's go.

615
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,244
Oh, you! What did you do?
It's chaos up there.

616
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,080
What happened to stopping Shen?

617
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,166
Yeah.

618
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,753
Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.

619
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,047
I meant for him to get away.

620
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,175
'Cause... it was a trick. It was a plot.

621
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:17,263
I was thinking...
I'll figure out his plot more.

622
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,933
That makes no sense.

623
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:21,768
What do you mean? Sure it does.

624
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:25,271
Po, the truth.
You had Shen. What happened?

625
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,482
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.

626
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:30,193
I... Yeah...
OK, he caught me off guard.

627
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:32,153
The truth.

628
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:39,285
Fine. They will keep you
far from danger.

629
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,996
- Real far.
- What?

630
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,290
You're staying here.

631
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,210
Wait! I have to go ba...

632
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,426
You're staying here!

633
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,137
I'm going. And you can't stop me.

634
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:02,684
OK. I wasn't ready that time.

635
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:04,561
Guys? Don't.

636
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:05,812
Ready.

637
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:07,480
Look!

638
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,411
Stay down.

639
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,124
- I have to get to him.
- Then tell me why!

640
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,837
He was there! OK?

641
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:34,215
The peacock was there
the last time I saw my parents.

642
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:38,011
He knows what happened.
Where I came from.

643
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,638
Who I am.

644
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,311
Look, I'm going.

645
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,355
I have to know.

646
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,566
The hard core can't understand.

647
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,443
Tigress, no!

648
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,616
The hard core do understand.

649
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,953
But I can't watch my friend be killed.

650
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:09,459
- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?

651
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,545
- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.

652
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:16,382
- No.
- Don't worry, kid.

653
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,343
You're better off here.

654
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:32,398
You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.

655
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:35,568
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

656
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:38,696
Are you certain it is the panda
who is a fool?

657
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,241
You just destroyed
your ancestral home, Shen.

658
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:46,746
A trivial sacrifice...
when all of China is my reward.

659
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,374
Then will you finally be satisfied?

660
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:53,753
Will the subjugation of the whole world
finally make you feel better?

661
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:58,299
It's a start. I might also convert
the basement into a dungeon.

662
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,930
The cup you choose to fill
has no bottom.

663
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:07,100
It is time to stop this madness.

664
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,061
Why on earth would I do that?

665
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,438
So your parents can rest in peace.

666
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:16,234
My parents hated me.

667
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,321
Do you understand?

668
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:25,869
They wronged me...
and I will make it right.

669
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,328
They loved you.

670
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:32,250
They loved you so much that
having to send you away killed them.

671
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:40,633
The dead exist in the past...
and I must tend to the future.

672
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:49,517
Set the soothsayer free.
She's no use to me.

673
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:53,313
Goodbye, Shen.
I wish you happiness.

674
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,190
Happiness must be taken.

675
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,194
And I will take mine.

676
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,844
- Hurry it up!
- Move it!

677
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,098
If all of those weapons
leave the building, China will fall.

678
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:33,561
- We bring down the building.
- Hey, guys. How about this?

679
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,358
- This will work!
- All right, let's go.

680
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,026
I can't feel my face.

681
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,461
Did you hear him call it
Year of the Peacock?

682
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,880
- Hey.
- Hey.

683
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,548
OK. So, keep it cool.
Keep it cool. Keep it cool.

684
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,176
You! Where are you going?

685
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,723
On your feet! And wipe those
stupid grins off your faces.

686
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,949
Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster! Load them all!

687
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,253
Greetings, panda.

688
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:46,843
- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?

689
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:50,013
- That night.
- Ah, that night.

690
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,182
Yes! We're talking
about the same night, right?

691
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:57,895
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched
as your parents abandoned you.

692
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:02,650
It's a terrible thing.
I believe it went something like this.

693
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,245
Here's your New Year's gift.

694
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:16,581
Hope you like it,
'cause you can't return it.

695
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:20,835
Po? What's he doing here?

696
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:23,004
Return it! Return it!

697
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:37,643
Are you willing to die
to find the truth?

698
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:41,355
You bet I am.
Although I'd prefer not to.

699
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,838
We got them. Go!

700
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,070
You looking for me?

701
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,870
I said that too soon, didn't I?

702
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,463
Po!

703
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:53,761
Po, get away from him.

704
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,888
I'll get up. Here we go.

705
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:01,352
- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.

706
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,521
Now... answers.

707
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:06,440
Oh, you want to know so badly.

708
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:10,278
You think knowing will heal you, huh?

709
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:14,490
Fill some crater in your soul?

710
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,826
Well, here's your answer.

711
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:20,079
Your parents didn't love you.

712
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:22,999
But here...

713
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25,835
...let me heal you!

714
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,634
No!

715
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,711
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.

716
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:59,220
If I wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.

717
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:03,349
- Well, why save me?
- So you can fulfill your destiny.

718
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,727
What are you talking about?
Where am I?

719
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,564
What is this place?

720
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:14,735
I'm surprised you remember so little.

721
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:18,364
But you were so little when it happened.

722
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:26,205
Perhaps you do remember.

723
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,374
What? It's just a stupid nightmare.

724
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,626
Nightmare? Or memory?

725
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:04,201
This was a thriving village.

726
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,913
Young Shen was in line
to rule Gongmen City.

727
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,915
But he wanted more.

728
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:15,838
I foretold that someone would stand
in his way. A panda.

729
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:19,967
But I never could have foretold
what came next.

730
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,565
Get them all!

731
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:44,617
Take our son and run away! Go!

732
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:01,801
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

733
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:09,803
Your story may not have
such a happy beginning,

734
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:13,098
but that doesn't
make you who you are.

735
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,809
It is the rest of your story.

736
01:04:16,645 --> 01:04:18,812
Who you choose to be.

737
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:54,348
So, who are you, panda?

738
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,024
I am Po.

739
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,778
And I'm gonna need a hat.

740
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:20,165
Such sad, sad faces.

741
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,043
But now is a time only for joy.

742
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:27,256
You are going to be part
of something beautiful.

743
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:33,512
Once we reach the harbour,
in front of all the world,

744
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,850
you and your precious kung fu will die.

745
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:44,940
Then China will know to bow before me.

746
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:46,775
Set sail!

747
01:05:58,038 --> 01:05:59,455
What is that?

748
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:23,103
Honestly, guys,
I never thought I'd die like this.

749
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:26,273
I always thought I'd meet
a nice girl and settle down and...

750
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,192
...then she'd eat my head.

751
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,778
- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.

752
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:35,491
Po would want us to remain strong.
Hard-core. Right, Tigress?

753
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:47,419
- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.

754
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,380
Fire!

755
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,432
You coward!

756
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:14,863
Po?

757
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:22,121
How many times do I have to kill
the same stinking panda?

758
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:33,132
Shen!

759
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:37,344
A panda stands between you
and your destiny.

760
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,096
What?

761
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:43,308
Prepare yourself for a
hot serving of justice.

762
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,102
Your reign of terror comes to an end.

763
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:48,522
- What?
- And now, free the Five!

764
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,774
Disc of Destruction!

765
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,788
OK. Take aim!

766
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,718
Ready?

767
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,616
You can't follow me.

768
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:41,867
Just get him!

769
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,916
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on!

770
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:57,549
- No, no, no, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

771
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:58,759
No, don't shoot!

772
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:01,345
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

773
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:03,931
- You don't shoot!
- I won't shoot if you won't shoot.

774
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,351
Yeah!

775
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:10,395
- Don't shoot! Cross fire!
- Attack!

776
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,029
- Catch of Freedom!
- Monkey!

777
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:26,578
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?

778
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:29,289
- Step one, free the Five.
- What's step two?

779
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:30,874
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

780
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,042
Po!

781
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,378
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.

782
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:40,926
Nice!

783
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:44,847
Viper, Puppet of Death!

784
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:46,598
Tigress!

785
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:57,276
- Master Ox!
- Jump!

786
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,945
- And Croc!
- Vengeance is served.

787
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:02,948
- Why did you...?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.

788
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:11,790
Master Shifu!

789
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,461
Quickly. Use their boats
to block the way.

790
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:28,307
Crane!

791
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:31,184
Wings of Justice!

792
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,479
Yeah!

793
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:41,653
What?

794
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:55,751
I love you guys.

795
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,345
Why aren't we firing?

796
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:09,932
They're taking out our gunners, sir.
They're getting close.

797
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:14,686
Fire! Fire at them!

798
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:18,941
- But, sir, we'll kill our own.
- I said fire at them!

799
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,150
Fire!

800
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:23,820
No.

801
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:32,746
Po!

802
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,449
Tigress?

803
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,001
As you wish.

804
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:02,794
Let's finish this.

805
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:27,694
Fire!

806
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:34,576
Inner peace.

807
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:03,063
Again!

808
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,404
Yeah!

809
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,659
Kill him! Somebody kill him!

810
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:40,267
What? No. No!

811
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,901
Keep firing! Keep firing!

812
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:12,048
Skadoosh.

813
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,622
How did you...?

814
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,666
How did you do it?

815
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:53,131
You know, you just keep your elbows up
and keep the shoulders loose.

816
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:56,468
Not that. How did you find peace?

817
01:15:56,636 --> 01:16:00,305
I took away your parents. Everything.

818
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:02,849
I scarred you for life.

819
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:06,978
See, that's the thing, Shen.
Scars heal.

820
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:11,149
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

821
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:13,735
Oh, yeah. What do scars do?
They fade, I guess?

822
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:18,323
- I don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.

823
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:22,410
You gotta let go of that stuff from
the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter.

824
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:27,082
The only thing that matters
is what you choose to be now.

825
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,667
You're right.

826
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,211
Then I choose... this!

827
01:17:24,015 --> 01:17:26,224
That was pretty hard-core.

828
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:36,651
- Po!
- You did it!

829
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:39,904
- Come here! Yeah!
- Don't ever do that again, please.

830
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:43,742
It seems you have found inner peace.

831
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:46,244
And at such a young age.

832
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:48,288
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

833
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:12,937
What do you mean he's not here?
It's my son's birthday.

834
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,482
All he wanted was to meet
the Dragon Warrior.

835
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,401
How about some tofu birthday cake
instead, huh?

836
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:21,404
You know, I think we'll
just try again another time.

837
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:22,947
When do you think he'll be back?

838
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:29,913
I don't know. OK, I don't know.
Maybe never.

839
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:33,416
I mean, I worry, OK?
But that's my job, I'm his dad.

840
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:35,794
At least, I was his dad.

841
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:39,631
Why did he have to go and save China?
I know why.

842
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:43,468
But why? He's just one little panda.

843
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:02,779
So, how did it go?
Did you save China?

844
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:05,156
Yep.

845
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,617
Well, I knew you would.

846
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,536
That's why I had new signs made.

847
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:11,955
"My son saved China.
You, too, can save.

848
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:14,666
Buy one dumpling, get one free."

849
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:16,167
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

850
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:19,003
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.

851
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:23,883
There's something I should tell you.

852
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:31,099
While I was gone,
I found the village where I was born.

853
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:36,187
I found out how I ended up
in that radish basket.

854
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:37,981
You did?

855
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:42,735
- I know who I am.
- You do?

856
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:46,364
I'm your son.

857
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,122
I love you, Dad.

858
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:57,041
I love you, too, son.

859
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:03,131
Delicious, fat radishes!

860
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,425
You're probably hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

861
01:20:05,593 --> 01:20:07,343
What are you talking about? I'll cook.

862
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:08,928
- No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad!

863
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:11,222
Well, it's the least I can do.
You saved China.

864
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,725
No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.

865
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:14,893
- Po.
- Dad.

866
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,519
- Po!
- OK.

867
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:19,314
Let's both cook. Together.

868
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:20,773
Together.

869
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:22,525
No, I'll cook.

870
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,854
My son is alive.

871
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:23,834
