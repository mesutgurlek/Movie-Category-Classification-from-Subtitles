1
00:00:04,728 --> 00:00:07,219
I, too, want my family safe.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,361
Is our little prince uncomfortable?

3
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:17,839
Does he want his pillow fluffed?

4
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:24,238
Special treatment for the special boy!

5
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:27,883
Isn't that what you wanted?

6
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:32,449
[Lucy] You look like Mum.

7
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:35,457
Mum hasn't had a dress like this
since before the war.

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,762
We should bring her one back.
A whole trunk full!

9
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:43,761
If we ever get back.

10
00:00:47,904 --> 00:00:50,372
I'm sorry I'm like that.

11
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:55,100
We used to have fun together, didn't we?

12
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:59,479
Yes. Before you got boring.

13
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:00,982
Oh, really?

14
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:04,484
[screaming, laughing]

15
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:14,493
- [growls]
- [screaming]

16
00:01:14,564 --> 00:01:15,997
Please don't try to run.

17
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:19,934
- We're tired.
- And we prefer to kill you quickly.

18
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:23,737
[shouting]

19
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:25,536
- [horn sounding]
- Susan!

20
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:29,971
- [screaming]
- [snarling]

21
00:01:35,785 --> 00:01:37,150
Get back!

22
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:40,055
Peter! Ah!

23
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:43,224
Come on.

24
00:01:44,194 --> 00:01:47,163
We've already been through this before.

25
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,790
We both know you haven't got it in you.

26
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:51,629
Peter! Watch out!

27
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:55,227
- [growling]
- [snarling]

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,737
[roaring]

29
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:05,376
No! Stay your weapons.
This is Peter's battle.

30
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:09,010
You may think you're a king,

31
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,383
but you're going to die...

32
00:02:11,454 --> 00:02:13,684
...like a dog!
- [Susan] Look out!

33
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:16,051
[both screaming] Peter!

34
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:22,023
[straining]

35
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:34,733
- [yelping, barking]
- After him.

36
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:38,207
He'll lead you to Edmund.

37
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:43,943
Peter.

38
00:02:44,688 --> 00:02:46,246
Clean your sword.

39
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:55,558
Rise, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane,

40
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:58,430
Knight of Narnia.

41
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:16,748
- [metal clanging]
- [indistinct chatter]

42
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:26,189
The minotaurs will take the left flanks.

43
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:29,460
We'll keep the giants in reserve
and send the dwarfs in first.

44
00:03:29,532 --> 00:03:32,057
- [growling]
- [snarling]

45
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:34,570
- [yelping]
- [hooves stomping]

46
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,366
Ah!

47
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:40,339
The prisoner!

48
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:49,944
[moaning]

49
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:58,224
[breathing heavily]

50
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:07,359
[groans]

51
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:11,199
[Ginarrbrik] You're not
going to kill me?

52
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:16,279
Not yet.

53
00:04:17,747 --> 00:04:19,612
[snorting]

54
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:21,844
We have work to do.

55
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,944
- [indistinct chatter]
- [horses whinny]

56
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:54,750
[gasps] Edmund!

57
00:05:26,683 --> 00:05:28,947
What's done is done.

58
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:33,114
There is no need to speak to Edmund
about what is past.

59
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,626
Hello.

60
00:05:57,614 --> 00:06:00,742
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little tired.

61
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:03,115
Get some sleep.

62
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:13,187
And Edmund...

63
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:16,992
...try not to wander off.

64
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,780
Narnia's not going
to run out of toast, Ed.

65
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:37,918
I'm sure they'll pack something up
for the journey back.

66
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:39,352
We're going home?

67
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,417
You are.

68
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:45,617
I promised Mum I'd keep you three safe.

69
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:48,987
But it doesn't mean
I can't stay behind and help.

70
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:51,465
But they need us.

71
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:54,832
All four of us.

72
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:56,804
Lucy, it's too dangerous.

73
00:06:56,873 --> 00:06:59,433
You almost drowned!
Edmund was almost killed!

74
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:03,043
Which is why we have to stay.

75
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:09,514
I've seen what the White Witch can do.
And I've helped her do it.

76
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,720
And we can't leave these
people behind to suffer for it.

77
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:24,423
I suppose that's it then.

78
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:27,326
Where are you going?

79
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:31,572
To get in some practice.

80
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:48,983
[laughing]

81
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:50,923
[horse whinnies]

82
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:57,657
Come on, Ed! Sword point up,
like Oreius showed us.

83
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:00,100
- [Edmund] En garde!
- [Peter] Now block.

84
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:04,865
- [Edmund] Hey!
- [Mr. Beaver] Peter! Edmund!

85
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:07,739
- [whinnying]
- Whoa, horsie!

86
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,335
- My name is Philip.
- Oh.

87
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:12,210
[stammers] Sorry.

88
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:14,876
The Witch has demanded
a meeting with Aslan.

89
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:18,551
She's on her way here.

90
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:20,757
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

91
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:22,349
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

92
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:26,691
- [male voice #1] Go away, Witch!
- Empress of the Lone Islands!

93
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:30,389
[male voice #2] You don't belong here!
Go away!

94
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,901
[growling]

95
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,961
[crowd murmuring]

96
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,784
You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.

97
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:59,657
[crowd murmuring]

98
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:03,064
His offense was not against you.

99
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,865
Have you forgotten the laws
upon which Narnia was built?

100
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:10,428
Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch.

101
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:13,600
I was there when it was written.

102
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:19,575
Then you'll remember well
that every traitor belongs to me.

103
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:22,950
- His blood is my property.
- [swords unsheathing]

104
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,317
- Try and take him then.
- [grunting]

105
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:32,756
Do you really think that mere force
will deny me my right...

106
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,159
...little King?

107
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,466
Aslan knows that unless I have blood,
as the law demands,

108
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:44,973
all of Narnia will be overturned

109
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:48,033
and perish in fire and water.

110
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:51,342
That boy will die

111
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:55,009
- on the Stone Table...
- [crowd murmuring]

112
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:59,080
...as is tradition.

113
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:03,948
You dare not refuse me.

114
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:05,826
Enough.

115
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:11,128
I shall talk with you alone.

116
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:07,320
She has renounced her claim
on the Son of Adam's blood.

117
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,324
[cheering, applause]

118
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:12,225
How do I know your promise will be kept?

119
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:13,762

[footsteps]

124
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:08,377
- Susan!
- Mm?

125
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:23,458
[horse whinnies]

126
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,633
Shouldn't you both be in bed?

127
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:05,471
We couldn't sleep.

128
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,840
Please, Aslan.

129
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,073
Couldn't we come with you?

130
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:14,275
I would be glad of the company
for a while.

131
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:17,783
Thank you.

132
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:43,473
It is time.

133
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:46,982
From here, I must go on alone.

134
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:48,482
But Aslan...

135
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:52,078
You have to trust me.
For this must be done.

136
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:54,418
Thank you, Susan.

137
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,924
Thank you, Lucy.

138
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:59,052
And farewell.

Do you want some milk?

00:15:37,593 --> 00:15:39,185
Why doesn't he fight back?

151
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,091
- Bind him!
- [snorting]

152
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:46,624
Tie him up! Get him!

153

- [moaning]
- Wait!

154
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:57,069
Let him first be shaved.

00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:06,251
[crowd cheering]

156
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:20,593
Bring him to me.

You know, Aslan,

162
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,764
I'm a little disappointed in you.

163
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:32,767
Did you honestly think by all this
that you could save the human traitor?

164
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:38,745
You are giving me your life

165
00:17:38,814 --> 00:17:40,782
and saving no one.

166
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,477
[chuckles]

167
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:45,620
So much for love.

But tomorrow,

we will take Narnia

00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:39,670

He's gone.

192
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:32,515
He must have known what he was doing.

No. Look.

196
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:35,877
We have to tell the others.

197
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:40,048
- We can't just leave him!
- Lucy, there's no time.

198
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:42,386
They need to know.

Be still, my Princes.

I bring grave news from your sisters.

She's right.

He's gone.

208
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:11,439
Then you'll have to lead us.

209
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:18,851
Peter, there's an army out there
and it's ready to follow you.

210
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:22,448
- I can't.
- Aslan believed you could.

211
00:23:25,427 --> 00:23:27,395
And so do I.

212
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:39,029
The Witch's army is nearing, sire.
What are your orders?

[screeching]

They come, Your Highness, in numbers
and weapons far greater than our own.

215
00:24:28,323 --> 00:24:30,484
Numbers do not win a battle.

No. But I bet they help.

To the death.

For Narnia and for Aslan!

Go!

Where's Aslan?

But we saw the knife. The Witch.

00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:54,132
If the Witch knew
the true meaning of sacrifice,

251
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:57,542
she might have interpreted
the Deep Magic differently.

252
00:30:57,612 --> 00:31:00,240
That when a willing victim
who has committed no treachery

253
00:31:00,315 --> 00:31:02,545
is killed in a traitor's stead,

254

the Stone Table will crack

will turn backwards.

We sent the news that you were dead.

Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.

We have to help them.

and the next he won't.

340
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,284
But you mustn't press him.

341
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,145
After all, he's not a tame lion.

342
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,054
No.

343
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:07,059
But he is good.

344
00:45:07,795 --> 00:45:09,422
Here.

345
00:45:11,031 --> 00:45:13,295
You need it more than I do.

346
00:46:05,452 --> 00:46:08,046
[breathing heavily]

347
00:46:09,023 --> 00:46:11,184
Are you all right, Philip?

348
00:46:11,258 --> 00:46:13,556
I'm not as young as I once was.

349
00:46:13,627 --> 00:46:15,561
[horse whinnies]

350
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,894
Come on, Ed.

351
00:46:18,332 --> 00:46:21,324
- Just catching my breath.
- That's all we'll catch at this rate.

352
00:46:21,402 --> 00:46:23,768
- What did he say, Susan?
- "Wait in the castle.

353
00:46:23,837 --> 00:46:27,068
- I'll get the stag myself."
- [chuckling]

354
00:46:31,378 --> 00:46:33,209
What's this?

355
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:41,119
It seems familiar.

356
00:46:43,557 --> 00:46:45,491
As if from a dream.

357
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:47,618
Or a dream of a dream.

358
00:46:50,898 --> 00:46:53,196
Spare Oom.

359
00:46:56,036 --> 00:46:58,596
- Lucy!
- Not again.

360
00:47:00,307 --> 00:47:02,798
- [Peter] Lu?
- Come on!

361
00:47:13,787 --> 00:47:15,345
These aren't branches.

362
00:47:16,857 --> 00:47:17,846
[Edmund] Ow! Ooh!

363
00:47:17,925 --> 00:47:20,985
- They're coats.
- [Edmund] Susan, you're on my foot!

364
00:47:21,061 --> 00:47:23,256
[Lucy] Peter, move off!

365
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:25,491
- [Peter] Stop shoving.
- [Edmund] Stop it!

366
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:27,397
I'm not on your toe!

367
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:30,232
[all grunting]

368
00:47:42,483 --> 00:47:44,144
[Kirke] Oh!

369
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:46,811
There you are.

370
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,154
What were you all
doing in the wardrobe?

371
00:47:54,061 --> 00:47:56,859
You wouldn't believe us
if we told you, sir.

372
00:48:02,636 --> 00:48:04,297
Try me.

373
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,764
[Kirke] I don't think
you'll get back in that way.

374
00:49:12,873 --> 00:49:17,537
You see... I've already tried.

375
00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:21,570
Will we ever go back?

376
00:49:21,648 --> 00:49:23,343
Oh, I expect so.

377
00:49:24,484 --> 00:49:27,453
But it'll probably happen
when you're not looking for it.

378
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:31,617
All the same...

379
00:49:31,691 --> 00:49:34,216
[whispers] best to keep your eyes open.

380
00:49:43,503 --> 00:49:46,199
[Aslan roars]
