<i>OLD BILBO (V.O.): My dear Frodo.</i>

3
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,871
<i>You asked me once if I had told you
everything there was to know about my...</i>

4
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:17,449
<i>adventures.</i>

5
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:21,582
<i>And while I can honestly say
I have told you the truth...</i>

6
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,500
<i>I may not have told you all of it.</i>

7
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:35,266
<i>I am old now Frodo.</i>

8
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:39,738
<i>I'm not the same hobbit I once was.</i>

9
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:47,151
<i>I think it is time for you to know...</i>

10
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:50,189
<i>what really happened.</i>

11
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:54,182
<i>It began long ago.</i>

12
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,848
<i>In a land far away to the East.</i>

13
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:04,990
<i>The like of which you will
not find in the world today.</i>

14
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,066
<i>There was the city of Dale.</i>

15
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:22,740
<i>Its market's known far and wide,
full of the bounties of fine and vail,</i>

16
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:26,298
<i>peaceful and prosperous.</i>

17
00:02:29,156 --> 00:02:34,630
<i>For this city laid before the doors
of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth...</i>

18
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,410
<i>Erebor.</i>

19
00:02:37,832 --> 00:02:42,116
<i>Stronghold of Thrór,
king under the mountain.</i>

20
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:45,385
<i>The mightiest of the dwarf lords.</i>

21
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:51,332
<i>Thrór ruled with utter surety,
never doubting his house would endure,</i>

22
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:55,041
<i>for his line lay secure
in the lives of his son...</i>

23
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,385
<i>and grandson.</i>

24
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,119
<i>Ah, Frodo. Erebor.</i>

25
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:04,593
<i>Built deep within the mountain itself,</i>

26
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,227
<i>the beauty of this fortress
city was a legend.</i>

27
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:14,138
<i>Its wealth lay in the earth,
in precious gems humed from rock,</i>

28
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:20,057
<i>and in great seams of gold
running like rivers through stone.</i>

29
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,275
<i>The skill of the dwarves was unequaled.</i>

30
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,652
<i>Fashioning object of great beauty,</i>

31
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:33,566
<i>out of diamond, emerald,
ruby and sapphire.</i>

32
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:38,359
<i>Ever they delved deeper
down into the dark,</i>

33
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:41,504
<i>and that is where they found it.</i>

34
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:50,447
<i>The heart of the mountain...</i>

35
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:54,123
<i>The Arkenstone.</i>

36
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:57,360
<i>Thrór named it the king's jewel.</i>

37
00:03:57,493 --> 00:04:02,233
<i>He took it as a sign, a sign
that his right to rule was divine.</i>

38
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:09,223
<i>All would pay homage to him.
Even the great Elven king, Thranduil.</i>

39
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:14,645
<i>But the years of peace and
plenty were not to last.</i>

40
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:18,988
<i>Slowly the days turned sour,</i>

41
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:22,400
<i>and the watchful nights closed in.</i>

42
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:33,077
<i>Thrór's love of gold
had grown too fierce...</i>

43
00:04:35,263 --> 00:04:38,910
<i>A sickness had begun to grow within him.

44
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:42,837
<i>It was a sickness of the mind.</i>

45
00:04:45,463 --> 00:04:48,273
<i>And where sickness thrives...</i>

46
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:51,898
<i>bad things will follow.</i>

47
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:05,608
<i>The first they heard was a noise like
a hurricane, coming down from the North.</i>

48
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:11,600
<i>The pines on the mountain creaked
and cracked in the hot dry wind.</i>

49
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:18,245
THORIN: Balin, sound the alarm.

50
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:22,435
Call out the guards, do it now!

51
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:23,982
BALIN: What is it?

52
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:25,358
Dragon.

53
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,784
DRAGON!

54
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,480
<i>OLD BILBO (V.O.):
He was a Firedrake from the North.</i>

55
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:44,148
<i>Smaug... had come!</i>

56
00:06:12,183 --> 00:06:15,329
<i>Such wanton death was dealt that day,</i>

57
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:18,907
<i>for this city of men was nothing to Smaug.</i>

58
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,493
<i>His eye was set on another price.</i>

59
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:34,103
<i>For dragons covet gold...
with a dark and fierce desire.</i>

60
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:08,111
NO!

61
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:19,517
<i>Erebor... was lost.</i>

62
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:29,188
<i>For a dragon will guard his plunder
as long as he lives.</i>

63
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:39,742
Run for your lives!

64
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:42,648
Help us!

65
00:07:55,291 --> 00:08:00,062
<i>Thranduil would not risk the lives of
his kin against the lawth of the dragon.</i>

66
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:04,178
<i>No help came from the Elves that day.</i>

67
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,506
<i>Nor any day since.</i>

68
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:14,647
<i>Robbed of their homeland, the dwarves
of Erebor wandered the wilderness.</i>

69
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,502
<i>The once mighty people brought low.</i>

70
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:23,913
<i>The young dwarf prince took
work where he could find it,</i>

71
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,512
<i>laboring in the villages of men.</i>

72
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:29,053
<i>But always, he remembered...</i>

73
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:35,210
<i>the mountain smoke beneath the moon,
the trees like torches blazing bright,</i>

74
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:41,419
<i>where he had seen dragon fire in the sky,
and a city turn to ash.</i>

75
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:47,756
<i>And he never forgave...
and he never forgot.</i>

76
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:57,169
<i>That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in.</i>

77
00:08:57,845 --> 00:09:00,848
<i>For quite by chance,
and the will of a wizard,</i>

78
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:05,024
<i>fate decided I would
become part of this tale.</i>

79
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:10,415
<i>It began...
well, it began as you might expect.</i>

80
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:16,789
<i>In a hole in the ground,
there lived a hobbit.</i>

81
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:23,814
<i>Not a nasty, dirty wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells.</i>

82
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:26,275
<i>This was a hobbit home.</i>

83
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:31,455
<i>And that means good
food, a warm house...</i>

84
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:34,968
<i>and all the comforts of home.</i>

85
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,233
OLD BILBO: Thank you.

86
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,636
FRODO: What's this?

87
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:17,244
That is private.
Keep your sticky paws off!

88
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:20,359
It's not ready yet.

89
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:22,458
Not ready for what?

90
00:10:22,553 --> 00:10:24,021
Reading.

91
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:29,151
OLD BILBO: What on earth are these?

92
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,172
FRODO: Replies to the party invitations.

93
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:34,903
Good gracious.

94
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:36,936
Is it today?

95
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,905
They all say they're coming,
except for the Sackville-Bagginses,

96
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:42,217
who're demanding you ask them in person.

97
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:45,429
OLD BILBO: Are they, indeed.
Over my dead body.

98
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,499
They'd probably find that quite agreeable.

99
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:50,114
They seem to think you have tunnels
overflowing with gold.

100
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:53,607
It was one small chest,
hardly overflowing.

101
00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:56,800
And it still smells of troll.

102
00:10:57,775 --> 00:10:59,554
What on earth are you doing?

103
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,916
Taking precautions!

104
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:07,200
You know I caught her making off
with the silverware once.

105
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:08,341
FRODO: Who?

106
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,960
OLD BILBO: Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

107
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:14,671
She had all my spoons
stuffed in her pockets.

108
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,557
Dreadful woman.

109
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,479
Make sure you keep an eye
on her after I'm...

110
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:22,893
When I'm... when...

111
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:25,635
When you're... what?

112
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:33,045
It's nothing... nothing.

113
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,667
FRODO: You know, some people are
beginning to wonder about you.

114
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,716
They think you're becoming odd.

115
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,622
– Odd?
– Hmm...

116
00:11:46,656 --> 00:11:47,950
Unsociable.

117
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,606
Unsociable, me?
Nonsense.

118
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:53,169
Be a good lad and put that on the gate.

119
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,050
Do you think he will come?

120
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,030
Who?

121
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:07,233
Gandalf.

122
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:11,011
Oh, he wouldn't miss a chance
to let off his wiz poppers.

123
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:13,540
He'll give us quite a show, you'll see.

124
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:14,594
FRODO: Right then. I am off.
.

125
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:15,610
FRODO: Right then. I am off.
– Off to where?

126
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:17,999
FRODO: Eastfarthing woods.
I'm going to surprise him.

127
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:21,377
OLD BILBO: Well go on then.
You don't want to be late.

128
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:28,623
<i>OLD BILBO: He doesn't approve being late.</i>

129
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:31,785
<i>Not that I ever was.</i>

130
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,114
<i>In those days, I was always on time.</i>

131
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,691
<i>I was entirely respectable...</i>

132
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:43,084
<i>and nothing unexpected...</i>

133
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:46,256
<i>ever happened.</i>

134
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:53,183
AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY

135
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:12,768
– Good morning.
– What do you mean?

136
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:14,199
Do you mean to wish me a good morning,

137
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:17,395
or do you mean that it is a good
morning whether I want it or not?

138
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:22,921
Or perhaps you mean to say that you
feel good on this particular morning...

139
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:27,481
or are you simply stating that
this is a morning to be good on?

140
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,380
All of them at once, I suppose.

141
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:39,346
Can I help you?

142
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:41,315
It remains to be seen.

143
00:13:43,338 --> 00:13:47,335
I'm looking for someone
to share in an adventure.

144
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,009
An adventure?

145
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,582
No, I don't imagine
anyone west of Bree,

146
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,046
who'd have much interest in adventures.

147
00:13:59,746 --> 00:14:03,852
Nasty, disturbing...
uncomfortable things.

148
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:06,478
Make you late for dinner!

149
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:16,227
Good morning!

150
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:21,461
To think that I should have lived to be
good-morninged by Belladonna Took's son,

151
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,967
as if I was selling buttons at the door!

152
00:14:25,103 --> 00:14:26,202
Beg your pardon?

153
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:30,332
You've changed, and not entirely
for the better, Bilbo Baggins.

154
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:31,590
I'm sorry, do I know you?

155
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:34,774
Would you know my name, although
you don't remember I belong to it,

156
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:36,655

Yes, well he could!

488
00:34:11,522 --> 00:34:14,582
In the battle of Greenfields,
he charged the goblin ranks

489
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:18,697
he swung his club so hard, it knocked
the goblin king's head clean off,

490

the air, and went down a rabbit hole.

01:12:24,675 --> 01:12:27,844
It's Radagast the Brown!

948
01:12:30,641 --> 01:12:32,381
GANDALF: What on earth are you doing here?

949
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:33,993
I was looking for you, Gandalf.

950
01:12:34,095 --> 01:12:37,850
Something's wrong.
Something's terribly wrong!

951
01:12:37,947 --> 01:12:39,067
Yes?

952
01:12:44,661 --> 01:12:46,317
RADAGAST: Just give me a minute, hm...

953
01:12:46,659 --> 01:12:47,779
No...

954
01:12:47,815 --> 01:12:49,899
I had a thought and,
now I've lost it, it was-

955
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:52,850
it was was right there,
on the tip of my tongue!

956
01:12:54,196 --> 01:12:56,873
Oh! It's not a thought at all!

957
01:12:57,389 --> 01:12:59,209
It's just only a...

958
01:13:00,246 --> 01:13:01,464
stick insect.

959
01:13:05,736 --> 01:13:08,686
RADAGAST: The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf.

960
01:13:10,281 --> 01:13:14,091
A darkness has fallen over it,
nothing glows anymore.

961
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:16,620
At least nothing good.

962
01:13:17,105 --> 01:13:19,605
The air is foul of decay,

963
01:13:20,183 --> 01:13:21,844
but worse are the webs.

964
01:13:21,978 --> 01:13:23,819
GANDALF: Webs? What do you mean?

965
01:13:24,177 --> 01:13:28,104
RADAGAST: Spiders, Gandalf.
Giant ones.

966
01:13:28,299 --> 01:13:32,374
Some kind of spawn of... Ungoliant,
or I'm not a wizard.

967
01:13:32,973 --> 01:13:34,877
I followed their trail.

968
01:13:35,246 --> 01:13:37,853
They came from... Dol Guldur.

969
01:13:40,769 --> 01:13:42,169
GANDALF: Dol Guldur?

970
01:13:43,113 --> 01:13:46,025
But the old fortress is abandoned.

971
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,410
No, Gandalf.

972
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,734
It is not.

973
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:03,374
RADAGAST (CONT'D):
A dark power dwells in there...

974
01:14:03,617 --> 01:14:07,169
such as I have never felt before.

975
01:14:08,691 --> 01:14:12,824
It is the shadow of an ancient aura.

976
01:14:19,005 --> 01:14:24,651
One that can summon
the spirits of the dead.

977
01:14:41,482 --> 01:14:43,433
I saw him, Gandalf.

978
01:14:44,098 --> 01:14:46,338
From out of the darkness...

979
01:14:46,884 --> 01:14:50,827
the Necromancer has come!

980
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:19,567
Sorry.

981
01:15:19,983 --> 01:15:21,905
GANDALF: Try a little old Toby.

982
01:15:22,577 --> 01:15:23,981
It'll help setting your nerves.

983
01:15:27,724 --> 01:15:29,206
Then out.

984
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:38,969
Now... the Necromancer.

985
01:15:39,312 --> 01:15:40,712
Are you sure?

986
01:15:54,381 --> 01:15:58,269
RADAGAST: That is not... from the world...

987
01:15:58,465 --> 01:16:00,871
of the living.

988
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:03,611
[Howlings]

989
01:16:06,272 --> 01:16:08,733
Was that a wolf? Are there-
are there wolves out there?

990
01:16:08,999 --> 01:16:10,119
Wolves?

991
01:16:10,247 --> 01:16:12,067
No, that is not a wolf.

992
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:14,342
[Growls]

993
01:16:26,229 --> 01:16:27,629
THORIN: Warg scouts!

994
01:16:27,948 --> 01:16:29,971
Which means an orc pack is not far behind.

995
01:16:29,994 --> 01:16:30,994
Orc pack?

996
01:16:31,018 --> 01:16:34,105
Who did you tell about
your quest, beyond your kin?

997
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:35,166
No one.

998
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:36,137
Who did you tell?

999
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:37,910
No one, I swear!

1000
01:16:38,362 --> 01:16:39,916
What in Dorin's name is going on?

1001
01:16:40,065 --> 01:16:41,885
You're being hunted.

1002
01:16:42,672 --> 01:16:44,094
DWALIN: We have to get out of here.

1003
01:16:44,196 --> 01:16:48,092
ORI: We can't! We have no ponies.
They bolted.

1004
01:16:48,436 --> 01:16:49,842
RADAGAST: I'll draw them off.

1005
01:16:50,026 --> 01:16:53,048
GANDALF: These are Gundabad wargs.
They will outrun you!

1006
01:16:53,087 --> 01:16:56,108
These are Rhosgobel rabbits.

1007
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,920
I'd like to see them try.

1008

Stay together. Move!

1014
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:06,779
THORIN: Ori, no!

1015
01:18:06,872 --> 01:18:08,388
Come back.

1016
01:18:11,138 --> 01:18:13,238
All of you, come on,
come on! Quick!

1017

THORIN: Where're you leading us?

1018
01:19:26,215 --> 01:19:27,066
GANDALF: Move!

1019

Run!

Quickly!

FILI: Where's Gandalf?

1026

DWALIN: He's abandoned us!

Elves.

DWALIN: I cannot see where the pathway leads.

1038
01:21:53,246 --> 01:21:54,590
Do we follow it or no?

1039
01:21:54,591 --> 01:21:56,045
BOFUR: We follow it, of course!

1040
01:22:00,068 --> 01:22:01,888
GANDALF: I think that would be wise.

1041
01:22:59,759 --> 01:23:02,319
The valley of Imladris.

1042
01:23:03,787 --> 01:23:06,780
In the common tongue,
it's known by another name.

1043
01:23:08,004 --> 01:23:09,454
Rivendell.

1044
01:23:12,152 --> 01:23:16,251
GANDALF: Here lies the last homely house,
east of the sea.

1045
01:23:18,548 --> 01:23:20,350
This was your plan all along...

1046
01:23:21,061 --> 01:23:23,161
to seek refuge with our enemy.

1047
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,973
You have no enemies here,
Thorin Oakenshield.

1048
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:31,690
The only ill-will to be found in this
valley is that which you bring yourself.

1049

THORIN: You think the Elves...
will give our quest their blessing?

1050
01:23:36,626 --> 01:23:38,149
They will try to stop us.

1051
01:23:38,376 --> 01:23:39,956
Of course, they will.

1052
01:23:40,018 --> 01:23:42,470
But we have questions
that need to be answered.

1053
01:23:46,009 --> 01:23:49,509
If we are to be successful, this
will need to be handled with tact...

1054
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:51,133
and respect...

1055
01:23:51,304 --> 01:23:53,404
and no small degree of charm.

1056
01:23:54,177 --> 01:23:56,977
Which is why you will
leave the talking to me.

Swords are named for the
great deeds they do in war.

I'm not actually sure it is a sword.

shortly before we were ambushed by orcs.

01:28:56,014 --> 01:28:57,834
It's mine to protect!

1109
01:28:58,249 --> 01:28:59,707
As are its secrets.

1110
01:28:59,817 --> 01:29:02,379
GANDALF: Save me from
the stubbornness of dwarves.

1111
01:29:02,643 --> 01:29:05,218
Your pride will be your downfall.

1112
01:29:05,822 --> 01:29:10,022
You stand here in the presence of one of the
few in Middle-earth who can read that map.

1113
01:29:10,219 --> 01:29:12,320
Show it to Lord Elrond!

1114
01:29:30,846 --> 01:29:32,265
ELROND: Erebor.

1115
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:37,028
What is your interest in this map?

1116
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,380
GANDALF: It's mainly academic.

1117
01:29:40,783 --> 01:29:44,663
As you know, this sort of artifacts
sometimes contains hidden texts.

1118
01:29:51,021 --> 01:29:53,971
You still read ancient dwarvish,
do you not?

1119
01:29:58,678 --> 01:30:01,207
ELROND: Yeah, “Cirth ithil”.

1120
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,587
GANDALF: Moon runes...

1121
01:30:04,547 --> 01:30:06,163
Of course.

1122
01:30:07,151 --> 01:30:08,891
An easy thing to miss.

1123
01:30:09,204 --> 01:30:12,842
ELROND: And in this case, that is true.
Moon runes can only be read by the light

1124
01:30:12,853 --> 01:30:18,133
of the moon of the same shape and season
as the day on which they were written.

1125
01:30:18,655 --> 01:30:20,100
THORIN: Can you read them?

1126
01:30:25,127 --> 01:30:28,273
ELROND: These runes were written
on a mid-summer's eve

1127
01:30:28,295 --> 01:30:32,839
by the light of a crescent moon
nearly two hundred years ago.

1128
01:30:33,254 --> 01:30:36,376
It would seem you were meant
to come to Rivendell.

1129
01:30:37,033 --> 01:30:39,116
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield.

1130
01:30:39,187 --> 01:30:42,414
The same moon shines upon us tonight.

1131
01:31:01,768 --> 01:31:06,375
“Stand by the grey stone
when the thrush knocks,”

1132
01:31:06,556 --> 01:31:11,358
“and the setting sun with the
last light of Durin's Day

1133
01:31:11,375 --> 01:31:14,888
will shine upon the key-hole”.

1134
01:31:14,997 --> 01:31:16,057
BILBO: Durin's Day?

1135
01:31:16,088 --> 01:31:18,182
GANDALF: It the dwarves' new year,

1136
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:22,684
when the last moon of Autumn and the first
sun of Winter appear in the sky together.

1137
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,132
THORIN: This is ill news.

1138
01:31:24,762 --> 01:31:27,666
Summer is passing.
Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

1139
01:31:27,729 --> 01:31:28,849
BALIN: We still have time.

1140
01:31:29,007 --> 01:31:29,889
BILBO: Time, for what?

1141
01:31:29,945 --> 01:31:31,116
BALIN: To find the entrance.

1142
01:31:31,617 --> 01:31:35,397
We have to be standing at exactly
the right spot, at exactly the right time.

1143
01:31:35,521 --> 01:31:39,276
Then, and only then...
can the door be opened.

1144
01:31:39,347 --> 01:31:43,151
ELROND: So this is your purpose.
To enter the mountain.

1145
01:31:44,056 --> 01:31:45,456
THORIN: What of it?

1146
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:49,108
ELROND: There are some
who would not deem it wise.

1147
01:31:50,108 --> 01:31:51,928
GANDALF: Who do you mean?

1148
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:56,906
You are not the only guardian
to stand watching over Middle-earth.

1149
01:33:59,335 --> 01:34:00,455
Bombur!

1150
01:34:03,809 --> 01:34:06,114
[Everyone laughing]

1151
01:34:07,205 --> 01:34:11,368
GANDALF: With or without our help,
these dwarves will march on the mountain.

1152
01:34:11,553 --> 01:34:14,449
They're determined to
reclaim their homeland.

1153
01:34:14,614 --> 01:34:19,525
I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield
feels that he's answerable to anyone.

1154
01:34:19,956 --> 01:34:25,202
ELROND: Nor for that matter am I,
cause it's not me they must answer to.

1155
01:34:36,897 --> 01:34:38,699
Lady Galadriel.

1156
01:34:39,646 --> 01:34:41,443
Mithrandir.

1157
01:35:00,287 --> 01:35:04,011
GANDALF: 'd no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.

1158
01:35:04,106 --> 01:35:05,506
SARUMAN: He didn't.

1159
01:35:06,168 --> 01:35:07,501
I did.

1160
01:35:16,084 --> 01:35:17,484
Saruman.

1161
01:35:17,896 --> 01:35:21,425
You've been busy of late, my friend.

1162
01:35:22,777 --> 01:35:24,597
Tell me, Gandalf...

1163
01:35:25,126 --> 01:35:30,647
Did you think these plans and schemes
of yours would go unnoticed?

1164
01:35:30,788 --> 01:35:32,188
GANDALF: Unnoticed?

1165
01:35:33,664 --> 01:35:35,064
No, I...

1166
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:37,955
I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.

1167
01:35:37,974 --> 01:35:41,533
Galadriel: The dragon...
has long been on your mind.

1168
01:35:41,925 --> 01:35:43,745
GANDALF: It is true, my Lady.

1169
01:35:43,926 --> 01:35:46,150
Smaug owes allegiance to no one.

1170
01:35:46,596 --> 01:35:48,696
But if he should side with the enemy,

1171
01:35:49,516 --> 01:35:52,316
the dragon could be used
to terrible effect.

1172
01:35:52,716 --> 01:35:54,116
SARUMAN: What enemy?

1173
01:35:54,842 --> 01:35:57,355
Gandalf, the enemy is defeated.

1174
01:35:57,855 --> 01:35:59,675
Sauron is vanquished.

1175
01:36:00,012 --> 01:36:02,112
He can never regain his full strength.

1176
01:36:02,885 --> 01:36:04,197
Gandalf...

1177
01:36:04,298 --> 01:36:08,303
for four hundred years,
we have lived in peace,

1178
01:36:08,327 --> 01:36:11,332
a hard won watchful peace!

1179
01:36:11,403 --> 01:36:13,426
GANDALF: Are we- are we at peace?

1180
01:36:15,525 --> 01:36:17,760
Trolls have come down from the mountains,

1181
01:36:17,815 --> 01:36:20,375
they are raiding villages,
destroying farms.

1182
01:36:20,625 --> 01:36:22,802
Orcs have attacked us on the road.

1183
01:36:22,951 --> 01:36:24,911
ELROND: Hardly a prelude to war.

1184
01:36:25,021 --> 01:36:26,987
SARUMAN: Always you must meddle.

1185
01:36:27,527 --> 01:36:29,524
Looking for trouble where none exist!

1186
01:36:29,712 --> 01:36:31,112
GALADRIEL: Let him speak.

1187
01:36:32,858 --> 01:36:37,702
GANDALF: There is something at work
beyond the evil of Smaug,

1188
01:36:37,972 --> 01:36:40,072
something far more powerful.

1189
01:36:41,557 --> 01:36:46,666
We can remain blind to it, but it will not
be ignoring us, that I can promise you.

1190
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,420
A sickness hides over the Greenwood.

1191
01:36:49,888 --> 01:36:54,838
The woodsmen who live there now call it
Mirkwook, and uh, they s-  they say...

1192
01:36:56,533 --> 01:37:01,958
SARUMAN: Well, don't stop now,
tell us what the woodsmen say?

1193
01:37:02,075 --> 01:37:05,473
GANDALF: They speak of a Necromancer,
living in Dol Guldur,

1194
01:37:05,488 --> 01:37:08,712
a sorcerer who would summon the dead.

1195
01:37:08,964 --> 01:37:10,282
SARUMAN: That's absurd.

1196
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:13,194
No such power exists in this world.

1197
01:37:13,351 --> 01:37:17,874
This... Necromancer is
nothing more than a mortal man.

1198
01:37:18,145 --> 01:37:20,728
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

1199
01:37:20,862 --> 01:37:23,174
GANDALF: And so I though too. But...

1200
01:37:23,665 --> 01:37:24,790
Radagast has seen-
.

1201
01:37:24,791 --> 01:37:25,905
Radagast has seen-
– Radagast?

1202
01:37:26,366 --> 01:37:29,166
Do not speak to me of Radagast the Brown.

1203
01:37:29,818 --> 01:37:31,638
He's a foolish fellow.

1204
01:37:31,839 --> 01:37:35,893
Well... he's odd, I grant you,
he lives a solitary life.

1205
01:37:36,165 --> 01:37:37,227
SARUMAN: It's not that.

1206
01:37:37,329 --> 01:37:40,623
It's his excessive
consumption of mushrooms.

1207
01:37:41,116 --> 01:37:45,004
They've addled his brain,
and yellowed his teeth.

1208
01:37:45,504 --> 01:37:46,904
I warned him.

1209
01:37:47,252 --> 01:37:50,460
It is unbefitting one of
the Istari wandering the wood...

1210
01:37:50,492 --> 01:37:52,538
GALADRIEL (V.O.): You carry something.

1211
01:37:54,476 --> 01:37:56,935
It came to you from Radagast...

1212
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:59,885
He found it in Dul Guldur...

1213
01:38:01,221 --> 01:38:02,341
GANDALF: Yes.

1214
01:38:03,969 --> 01:38:05,369
GALADRIEL: Show me.

1215
01:38:08,404 --> 01:38:11,544
[Saruman keeps on speaking]

1216
01:38:15,816 --> 01:38:18,516
What is that?

1217
01:38:19,235 --> 01:38:22,337
GALADRIEL: A relic of Mordor.

1218
01:38:32,533 --> 01:38:34,335
ELROND: A Morgul blade...

1219
01:38:34,937 --> 01:38:37,695
GALADRIEL: Made for the witch-king of Angmar,

1220
01:38:37,996 --> 01:38:40,700
and buried with him.

1221
01:38:43,096 --> 01:38:44,867
When Angmar fell,

1222
01:38:45,234 --> 01:38:48,083
the men of the North took his body,

1223
01:38:48,108 --> 01:38:51,488
and all that he possessed was sealed
within the high fells of Rhudaur.

1224
01:38:52,614 --> 01:38:55,414
Deep within the rock, they buried him...

1225
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:58,656
in a tomb so dark...

1226
01:38:59,258 --> 01:39:01,226
it couldn't have come to light.

1227
01:39:01,328 --> 01:39:03,148
ELROND: This is not possible.

1228
01:39:04,482 --> 01:39:08,761
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs,
they cannot be opened!

1229
01:39:09,135 --> 01:39:14,101
SARUMAN: What proof do we have
this weapon came from Angmar's grave?

1230
01:39:14,804 --> 01:39:16,204
GANDALF: I have none.

1231
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:18,080
SARUMAN: Because there is none.

1232
01:39:18,896 --> 01:39:20,878
Let us examine what we know.

1233
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:26,029
A single orc pack has dared
to cross the Bruinen.

1234
01:39:26,775 --> 01:39:29,748
A dagger from a by-gone
age has been found.

1235
01:39:30,281 --> 01:39:35,567
And a human sorcerer
who calls himself the Necromancer,

1236
01:39:35,762 --> 01:39:39,751
has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress.

1237
01:39:40,822 --> 01:39:43,858
It's not so very much, after all.

1238
01:39:44,593 --> 01:39:49,739
The question of this dwarvish company
however, troubles me deeply.

1239
01:39:49,802 --> 01:39:51,659
I'm not convinced, Gandalf.

1240
01:39:52,026 --> 01:39:55,297
I do not feel I can condone such a quest.

1241
01:39:55,796 --> 01:39:59,770
If they come to me, I might just
spare them this disappointment.

1242
01:40:00,254 --> 01:40:03,384
I will not pretend to understand
your reasons for raising their hopes...

1243
01:40:03,416 --> 01:40:05,236
GALADRIEL (V.O.): They are leaving.

1244
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,320
[Saruman still speaking]

1245
01:40:07,459 --> 01:40:08,579
GANDALF: Yes.

1246
01:40:11,263 --> 01:40:12,911
GALADRIEL: You knew.

1247
01:40:13,339 --> 01:40:15,202
[Saruman still speaking]

1248
01:40:18,147 --> 01:40:20,947
SARUMAN: .. I'm afraid
there's nothing else for it.

1249
01:40:22,864 --> 01:40:24,479
LINDIR: My Lord Elrond.

1250
01:40:24,643 --> 01:40:26,043
The dwarves...

1251
01:40:26,443 --> 01:40:27,843
they've gone.

1252
01:40:32,945 --> 01:40:34,739
THORIN: Be on your guard,

1253
01:40:34,919 --> 01:40:37,732
we're about to step over
the Edge of the Wild.

1254
01:40:37,923 --> 01:40:40,319
Balin, you know this path, lead on.

1255
01:40:40,491 --> 01:40:41,611
BALIN: Ah Aye.

1256
01:40:47,718 --> 01:40:49,538
THORIN: Master Baggins,

1257
01:40:49,827 --> 01:40:51,647
I suggest you keep up.

1258
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:07,380
GALADRIEL (V.O.): You will follow them.

1259
01:41:07,490 --> 01:41:08,610
GANDALF: Yes.

1260
01:41:08,716 --> 01:41:11,588
GALADRIEL: You are right
to help Thorin Oakenshield.

1261
