"Samwise the Brave."

1612
02:48:43,113 --> 02:48:45,864
I want to hear more about Sam.

1613
02:48:50,161 --> 02:48:53,163
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1614
02:48:54,499 --> 02:48:58,544
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1615
02:48:59,629 --> 02:49:01,004
So was I.

1616
02:49:09,889 --> 02:49:12,558
"Samwise the Brave."

1617
02:49:16,855 --> 02:49:18,188
FRODO:
Sméagol?

1618
02:49:18,356 --> 02:49:21,233
SAM: We're not going
to wait for you. Come on.

1619
02:49:21,401 --> 02:49:23,360
Master.

1620
02:49:23,528 --> 02:49:26,488
Master looks after us.

1621
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:30,075
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1622
02:49:30,243 --> 02:49:32,703
GOLLUM:
Master broke his promise.

1623
02:49:32,871 --> 02:49:35,038
SMÉAGOL:
Don't ask Sméagol.

1624
02:49:35,206 --> 02:49:38,417
Poor, poor Sméagol.

1625
02:49:38,585 --> 02:49:41,420
Master betrayed us.

1626
02:49:41,588 --> 02:49:44,673
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1627
02:49:44,841 --> 02:49:48,760
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

1628
02:49:48,928 --> 02:49:51,638
Kill him! Kill him!

1629
02:49:51,806 --> 02:49:53,307
Kill them both!

1630
02:49:53,474 --> 02:49:57,102
And then we take the precious...

1631
02:49:57,270 --> 02:50:00,814
...and we be the master!

1632
02:50:01,482 --> 02:50:04,151
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

1633
02:50:04,319 --> 02:50:06,987
Eyes always watching.

1634
02:50:07,155 --> 02:50:10,741
Then we stabs them out.

1635
02:50:10,909 --> 02:50:15,412
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

1636
02:50:15,580 --> 02:50:19,041
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1637
02:50:19,209 --> 02:50:21,919
Kill them both.

1638
02:50:22,086 --> 02:50:24,588
Yes. No! No!

1639
02:50:24,756 --> 02:50:28,467
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1640
02:50:29,135 --> 02:50:31,762
SAM:
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1641
02:50:31,930 --> 02:50:34,514
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
FRODO: Sméagol?

1642
02:50:34,682 --> 02:50:40,103
We could let her do it.

1643
02:50:41,064 --> 02:50:45,192
Yes. She could do it.

1644
02:50:45,360 --> 02:50:49,947
Yes, precious, she could.

1645
02:50:50,114 --> 02:50:56,161
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

1646
02:50:57,080 --> 02:50:58,914
Once they're dead.

1647
02:50:59,082 --> 02:51:02,042
Shh.

1648
02:51:04,337 --> 02:51:08,006
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

1649
02:51:08,174 --> 02:51:10,259
Sméagol will show you the way.

1650
02:51:10,426 --> 02:51:12,678
Follow me.
