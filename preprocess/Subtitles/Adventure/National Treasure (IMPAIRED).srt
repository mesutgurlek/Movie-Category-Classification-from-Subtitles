3
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:25,206
Grandpa!

4
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:29,108
You're not supposed to be up here,
looking at that.

5
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,639
I just wanted to know.

6
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:35,133
Well, you're old enough, I suppose.

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,650
You should know the story.

8
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,396
OK, here we go.

9
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:46,295
It was 1832.

10
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:50,427
On a night much like this.

11
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,152
Yah!

12
00:01:57,058 --> 00:02:03,103
<i>Charles Carroll was the last surviving</i>
<i>signer of the Declaration of Independence.</i>

13
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:07,420
<i>He was also a member</i>
<i>of a secret society known as the Masons.</i>

14
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,817
<i>And he knew he was dying.</i>

15
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:13,944
<i>He woke up his stable boy</i>
<i>in the middle of the night</i>

16
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:18,525
<i>and ordered him to take him to</i>
<i>the White House to see Andrew Jackson</i>.

17
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:21,595
<i>Because it was urgent</i>
<i>that he speak to the president.</i>

18
00:02:22,564 --> 00:02:24,058
Did he talk to him?

19
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,234
No. He never got the chance.

20
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,601
<i>The president wasn't there that night.</i>

21
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:34,046
But Charles Carroll had a secret.

22
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:38,174
So he took into his confidence
the one person he could,

23
00:02:38,244 --> 00:02:41,091
my grandfather's grandfather,

24
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,616
<i>Thomas Gates.</i>

25
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,790
What was the secret?

26
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:49,434
A treasure.

27
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:54,493
A treasure beyond all imagining.

28
00:02:58,406 --> 00:03:01,439
<i>A treasure that had been</i>
<i>fought over for centuries</i>

29
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,732
<i>by tyrants. Pharaohs</i>.
<i>Emperors. Warlords.</i>

30
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:09,372
<i>And every time it changed hands</i>
<i>it grew larger.</i>

31
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:14,686
And then suddenly...

32
00:03:15,015 --> 00:03:17,022
it vanished.

33
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,826
<i>It didn't reappear</i>
<i>for more than a thousand years</i>.

34
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:23,652
<i>When knights from the First Crusade</i>

35
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,014
<i>discovered secret vaults</i>
<i>beneath the Temple of Solomon.</i>

36
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,501
<i>You see. The knights who found the vaults</i>

37
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:33,831
<i>believed that the treasure</i>
<i>was too great for any one man</i> -

38
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,805
<i>not even a king.</i>

39
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:41,926
<i>They brought the treasure back to Europe</i>
<i>and took the name "the Knights Templar."</i>

40
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:47,263
<i>Over the next century</i>
<i>they smuggled it out of Europe</i>

41
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:50,151
<i>and they formed a new brotherhood</i>
<i>called the Freemasons</i>.

42
00:03:50,217 --> 00:03:52,900
<i>In honor of</i>
<i>the builders of the great temple.</i>

43
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:55,647
<i>War followed.</i>

44
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:59,519
<i>By the time of the American Revolution</i>
<i>the treasure had been hidden again.</i>

45
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:01,666
<i>By then the Masons included</i>

46
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:05,699
<i>George Washington</i>.
<i>Benjamin Franklin. Paul Revere.</i>

47
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,422
<i>They knew they had to make sure</i>

48
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,785
<i>the treasure would never fall</i>
<i>into the hands of the British.</i>

49
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,812
So they devised a series of clues
and maps to its location.

50
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:18,600
Over time the clues were lost or forgotten,

51
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,772
until only one remained -

52
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:26,593
and that was the secret that Charles Carroll
entrusted to young Thomas Gates.

53
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:33,410
Charlotte.

54
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:37,569
"The secret lies with Charlotte."

55
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,943
Who's Charlotte?

56
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,558
Oh... not even Mr. Carroll knew that.

57
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:45,385
Now look here, Ben.

58
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:49,708
The Freemasons
among our Founding Fathers left us clues.

59
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:51,202
Like these.

60
00:04:51,278 --> 00:04:54,409
The unfinished pyramid.
The all-seeing eye.

61
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:58,983
Symbols of the Knights Templar,
guardians of the treasure.

62
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:04,614
- They're speaking to us through these.
<i>- (man)</i> You mean laughing at us.

63
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:07,403
You know what that dollar represents?

64
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,957
The entire Gates family fortune.

65
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:14,253
Six generations of fools...
chasing after fool's gold.

66
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,614
<i>(Grandpa)</i> It's not about the money,
Patrick. It's never been about the money.

67
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,751
Come on, son. Time to go.

68
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:23,017
You can... say your goodbyes.

69
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:31,752
Grandpa?

70
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:33,417
Hm?

71
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,938
Are we knights?

72
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:39,278
<i>(chuckles)</i>

73
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:41,678
Do you want to be?

74
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:45,061
All right. Um... kneel.

75
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:58,064
Benjamin Franklin Gates,

76
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,498
you take upon yourself the duty
of the Templars, the Freemasons

77
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,384
and the family Gates.

78
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:09,065
Do you so swear?

79
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,048
I so swear.

80
00:06:32,756 --> 00:06:35,025
<i>(man)</i> I was thinking about
Henson and Peary,

81
00:06:35,092 --> 00:06:39,500
crossing this kind of terrain with nothing
more than dog sleds and on foot.

82
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:42,092
- Can you imagine?
- It's extraordinary.

83
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,961
<i>(beeping)</i>

84
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:49,834
We getting closer?

85
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,738
Assuming Ben's theory's correct
and my tracking model's accurate,

86
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,432
we should be getting <i>very</i> close.

87
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:59,981
But don't go by me -
I broke a shoelace this morning.

88
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:06,639
- It's... it's a bad omen.
- Shall we turn around and go home?

89
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,710
Or we could pull over
and just throw him out here.

90
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,687
OK.

91
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,239
Riley, you're not missing that little
windowless cubicle we found you in?

92
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,351
No, no. Absolutely not.

93
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:20,430
<i>(continuous beep)</i>

94
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:38,453
Why are we stopping?
I thought we were looking for a ship.

95
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:42,383
- I don't see any ship.
- She's out there.

00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:55,565
Look... this is a waste of time.

98
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,543
How could a ship wind up way out here?

99
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:01,618
Well, I'm no expert, but...

100
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,690
it could be that the hydrothermic properties
of this region

101
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:07,283
produce hurricane-force ice storms

102
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:11,248
that cause the ocean to freeze
and then melt and then refreeze,

103
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:15,796
resulting in a semisolid
migrating land mass

104
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:19,380
that would land a ship right around here.

<i>(man)</i> Have Viktor
check the fuel in the generators.

Two years ago, if you hadn't shown up,
hadn't believed the treasure was real,

112
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:26,715
I don't know
if I ever would have found <i>Charlotte.</i>

113
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,466
You would have found it, I have no doubt.

114
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:33,758
That's why I didn't think it was
as crazy an investment as everyone said.

115
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,106
<i>(Ben)</i> I'm just relieved that <i>I'm</i> not as crazy

You handled that well.

This is it.

125
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:40,995
It's the cargo hold.

126
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:55,455
Do you think it's in the barrels?

127
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,070
Gunpowder.

128
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,685
Ooh! Ooh! OK...

129
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:27,206
Why would the captain
be guarding this barrel?

130
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:53,214
I found something!

131
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:01,438
What is it?

132
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:20,357
Do you guys know what this is?

133
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:23,015
Is it a billion-dollar pipe?

134
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:28,031
It's a meerschaum pipe.
Ah, that is beautiful.

135
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:31,369
Look at the intricacy of the scrollwork
on the stem.

136
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:35,462
- Is it a million-dollar pipe?
- No, it's a clue.

137
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:38,182
Let me see that.

138
00:12:39,148 --> 00:12:41,286
No, don't break it!

139
00:12:41,357 --> 00:12:43,877
We are one step closer to the treasure,
gentlemen.

140
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:46,468
Ben, I thought you said that
the treasure would be on the <i>Charlotte.</i>

141
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,930
No, "The secret lies with <i>Charlotte."</i>

142
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:51,011
I said it <i>could</i> be here.

143
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:09,734
It's Templar symbols.

144
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:17,893
"The legend writ."

145
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:20,007
"The stain effected."

146
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,045
"The key in Silence undetected."

147
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:26,468
"Fifty-five in iron pen."

148
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:29,804
"Mr. Matlack can't offend."

149
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:35,368
It's a riddle.

150
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,042
I need to think.

151
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:45,351
"The legend writ."

152
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,334
"The stain effected."

153
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:50,085
What legend?

154
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:55,213
There's the legend of the Templar treasure,
and the stain effects the legend.

155
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:57,255
How?

156
00:13:57,329 --> 00:13:59,663
"The key in Silence undetected."

157
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:02,535
Wait.

158
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,272
The legend and the key...
Now there's something.

159
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,753
A map.

160
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:11,501
Maps have legends, maps have keys.

161
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,675
It's a map, an invisible map.
So now...

162
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:17,291
Wait a minute. What do you mean,
"invisible" - "an invisible map"?

163
00:14:17,363 --> 00:14:21,487
"The stain effected"
could refer to a dye or a reagent

164
00:14:21,555 --> 00:14:24,010
used to bring about a certain result.

165
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,832
Combined with
"The key in Silence undetected,"

166
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:31,688
the implication is that the effect is to make
what was undetectable detectable.

167
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:36,430
Unless...
"The key in Silence" could be...

168
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,921
Prison.

169
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,358
Albuquerque.

170
00:14:41,428 --> 00:14:43,915
See, I can do it too.
Snorkel.

171
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:46,639
That's where the map is.
Like he said, "Fifty-five in iron pen."

172
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:48,116
"Iron pen" is a prison.

173
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:53,396
Or it could be, since the primary writing
medium of the time was iron gall ink,

174
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:56,275
the "pen" is... just a pen.

175
00:14:56,341 --> 00:15:00,596
But then why not say a pen?
Why... why say "iron pen"?

176
00:15:01,397 --> 00:15:03,371
'Cause it's a prison.

177
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:07,407
Wait a minute. "Iron pen" - the "iron"
does not describe the ink in the pen,

178
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:10,963
it describes <i>what</i> was penned.

179
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,161
It was "iron" -
it was firm, it was mineral...

180
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,823
No, no, no, that's stupid.

181
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:21,131
It was... It was firm,
it was adamant, it was resolved.

182
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,748
It was resolved.

183
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:27,404
"Mr. Matlack can't offend."

184
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:30,992
Timothy Matlack was the official scribe
of the Continental Congress.

185
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:35,219
Calligrapher, not writer. And to make sure
he could not offend the map,

186
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:38,931
it was put on the back of a resolution
that he transcribed,

187
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,775
a resolution that 55 men signed.

188
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,149
The Declaration of Independence.

189
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:51,694
Oh!

190
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:58,776
Come on, there's no invisible map on the
back of the Declaration of Independence.

191
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:01,230
That's clever, really.
A document of that importance

192
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:03,444
would ensure the map's survival.

193
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:06,197
And you said there were several Masons
signed it, yeah?

194
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,396
Yeah. Nine, for sure.

195
00:16:10,714 --> 00:16:14,063
We'll have to arrange a way to examine it.

196
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,237
This is one of the most important
documents in history.

197
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:21,496
They're not just gonna let us waltz in there
and run chemical tests on it.

198
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,018
- Then what do you propose we do?
- I don't know!

199
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:29,779
We could borrow it.

200
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:32,625
Steal it?

201
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,794
- I don't think so.
- Ben...

202
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,176
the treasure of the Knights Templar
is the treasure of all treasures.

203
00:16:40,252 --> 00:16:42,837
Oh, I didn't know that.
Really?

204
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:47,834
Look, Ben... I understand your bitterness.
I really do.

205
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:50,196
You've spent your entire life
searching for this treasure,

206
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,374
only to have
the respected historical community

207
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:56,121
treat you and your family
with mockery and contempt.

208
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:58,610
You should be able to rub this treasure
in their arrogant faces,

209
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,270
and I want you to have
the chance to do that.

210
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:03,699
How?

211
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:06,743
We all have our areas of expertise.

212
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,187
You don't think mine are limited
to writing checks, do you?

213
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:13,433
In another life...

214
00:17:14,238 --> 00:17:19,704
I arranged a number of operations of...
questionable legality.

215
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:24,475
I'd take his word for it, if I were you.

216
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:30,426
So don't worry.
I'll make all the arrangements.

217
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:33,078
No.

218
00:17:38,527 --> 00:17:41,145
I'd really need your help here.

219
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:46,551
Ian... I'm not gonna let you steal
the Declaration of Independence.

220
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:48,729
OK.

221
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,996
From this point on
all you're going to be is a hindrance.

222
00:17:54,721 --> 00:17:55,484
Hey!

223
00:17:55,553 --> 00:17:59,328
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me, Shaw?

224
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:02,588
Well, you can't shoot me.
There's more to the riddle.

225
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:05,788
Information you don't have. I do.

226
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:08,792
I'm the only one who can figure it out,
and you know that.

227
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:11,102
He's bluffing.

228
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:13,722
We played poker together, Ian.
You know I can't bluff.

229
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:16,095
Tell me what I need to know, Ben,

230
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,333
or I'll shoot your friend.

231
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:19,776
Hey!

232
00:18:19,843 --> 00:18:22,079
Quiet, Riley!
Your job's finished here.

233
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:30,621
Look where you're standing.
All that gunpowder.

234
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:34,368
You shoot me,
I drop this, we all go up.

235
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:37,025
Ben...

236
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:41,244
What happens when the flare burns down?

237
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:45,309
Tell me what I need to know, Ben.

238
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:48,764
You need to know...

239
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,723
if Shaw can catch.

240
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:57,950
Nice try, though.

241
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,779
Get out, Shaw!

242
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,639
Fool!

243
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,595
Riley, get over here!

244
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:34,238
- What is this?
- Smuggler's hold. Get in!

245
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:40,933
Move! Get out of here!

246
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,593
- What?
- Move! Get out!

247
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,629
Follow me.

248
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:50,884
Let's go, let's go!
She's gonna blow!

249
00:19:57,673 --> 00:19:59,745
Get down.

250
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:32,866
OK, let's go.
Before someone sees the smoke.

251
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:46,465
<i>(Riley coughing and spluttering)</i>

252
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:05,219
There's an Inuit village
about nine miles east of here.

253
00:21:05,294 --> 00:21:09,156
- It's popular with bush pilots.
- All right.

254
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,717
<i>(Riley pants exhaustedly)</i>

255
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:17,382
- Then what are we gonna do?
- Start making our way back home.

256
00:21:17,454 --> 00:21:21,644
No, I meant about Ian. He's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence, Ben.

257
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,455
We stop him.

258
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:43,052
<i>(Riley)</i> Is it really so hard to believe

259
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,487
that someone's gonna try to steal
the Declaration of Independence?

260
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:47,919
<i>(Ben)</i> The FBI gets 10,000 tips a week.

261
00:21:47,984 --> 00:21:50,285
They're not gonna worry about
something they're sure is safe.

262
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,807
But anyone that can do anything
is gonna think we're crazy.

263
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:55,881
Anyone crazy enough to believe us
isn't gonna want to help.

264
00:21:55,953 --> 00:22:00,557
We don't need someone crazy. But one
step short of crazy, what do you get?

265
00:22:00,624 --> 00:22:02,217
Obsessed.

266
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:03,914
Passionate.

267
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,614
Excuse me.

268
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:20,586
- Dr. Chase can see you now, Mr. Brown.
- Thank you.

269
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:21,868
<i>(softly)</i> Mr. Brown?

270
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:25,168
The family name doesn't get a lot
of respect in the academic community.

271
00:22:25,234 --> 00:22:27,241
Huh. Being kept down by the man.

272
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:31,409
A very cute man.

273
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,711
Thank you.

274
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:35,851
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Hi.

275
00:22:36,403 --> 00:22:38,475
- Abigail Chase.
- Paul Brown.

276
00:22:38,547 --> 00:22:40,816
- Nice to meet you.
- Bill.

277
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:43,307
Nice to meet you, Bill.

278
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:46,510
- How may I help you?
- Your accent. Pennsylvania Dutch?

279
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,394
- Saxony German.
- Oh!

280
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,177
- You're not American?
- Oh, I am an American.

281
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:55,211
I just wasn't born here.
Please don't touch that!

282
00:22:55,285 --> 00:22:58,700
Sorry. A neat collection.
George Washington's campaign buttons.

283
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:01,326
You're missing the 1789 inaugural, though.

284
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:04,266
- I found one once.
- That's very fortunate for you.

285
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:07,189
Now, you told my assistant
that this was an urgent matter.

286
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,325
Ah. Yes, ma'am.

287
00:23:09,397 --> 00:23:12,047
Well, I'm gonna get straight to the point.

288
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:16,818
Someone's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

289
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:21,262
It's true.

290
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:24,815
I think I'd better put you gentlemen
in touch with the FBI.

291
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,709
- We've been to the FBI.
- And?

292
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:30,070
They assured us that the Declaration
cannot possibly be stolen.

293
00:23:30,135 --> 00:23:32,590
- They're right.
- My friend and I are less certain.

294
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:36,492
However, if we were given the privilege
of examining the document...

295
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:41,069
we would be able to tell you for certain
if it were actually in any danger.

296
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:43,085
What do you think you're gonna find?

297
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:49,356
We believe that there's an...
encryption on the back.

298
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,662
- An encryption, like a code?
- Yes, ma'am.

299
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:54,637
Of what?

300
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:57,582
Uh... a cartograph.

301
00:23:57,656 --> 00:23:59,860
- A map.
- Yes, ma'am.

302
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,963
A map of what?

303
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:05,553
The location of... <i>(nervously clears throat)</i>

304
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:13,208
...of hidden items
of historic and intrinsic value.

305
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:18,063
- A treasure map?
- That's where we lost the FBI.

306
00:24:18,138 --> 00:24:20,952
You're treasure-hunters, aren't you?

307
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:23,287
We're more like treasure-protectors.

308
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:28,242
Mr. Brown, I have personally seen the back
of the Declaration of Independence,

309
00:24:28,315 --> 00:24:32,439
and I promise you, the only thing there
is a notation that reads,

310
00:24:32,507 --> 00:24:34,394
"Original Declaration of Independence,
dated...

311
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:37,241
"Four of July, 1776." Yes, ma'am.

312
00:24:37,307 --> 00:24:39,030
But no map.

313
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:46,801
<i>(exasperated sigh)</i>

314
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,879
It's invisible.

315
00:24:53,948 --> 00:24:55,671
Oh! Right.

316
00:24:55,997 --> 00:24:59,990
And that's where we lost
the Department of Homeland Security.

317
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,093
What led you to assume
there's this invisible map?

318
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:06,418
We found an engraving
on the stem of a 200-year-old pipe.

319
00:25:06,493 --> 00:25:08,794
Owned by Freemasons.

320
00:25:08,861 --> 00:25:13,017
- May I see the pipe?
- Uh, we don't have it.

321
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:18,268
- Did Big Foot take it?
- It was nice meeting you.

322
00:25:18,846 --> 00:25:20,820
Nice to meet you, too.

323
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:23,803
And, you know,
that really is a nice collection.

324
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,099
Must have taken you a long time
to hunt down all that history.

325
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,136
If it's any consolation,
you had me convinced.

326
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:36,574
It's not.

327
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:40,283
I was thinking, what if we go public,
plaster the story all over the Internet?

328
00:25:40,351 --> 00:25:44,541
It's not like
we have our reputations to worry about.

329
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:48,830
Although I don't think
that's exactly gonna scare Ian away.

330
00:25:51,072 --> 00:25:54,170
180 years of searching,
and I'm three feet away.

331
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:57,560
Of all the ideas
that became the United States,

332
00:25:57,632 --> 00:26:01,658
there's a line here
that's at the heart of all the others.

333
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:05,078
"But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations,

334
00:26:05,153 --> 00:26:07,738
pursuing invariably the same object,

335
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:11,606
evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute despotism,

336
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:15,456
it is their right, it is their duty
to throw off such government

337
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:18,871
and provide new guards
for their future security."

338
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,781
People don't talk that way anymore.

339
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,759
Beautiful, huh?

340
00:26:26,274 --> 00:26:29,208
- No idea what you said.
- It means, if there's something wrong,

341
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:33,473
those who have the ability to take action
have the responsibility to take action.

342
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:40,161
I'm gonna steal it.

343
00:26:42,403 --> 00:26:44,093
<i>(scoffs)</i> What?

344
00:26:45,092 --> 00:26:48,190
I'm gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

345
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:54,879
Uh... Ben?

346
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:58,082
<i>(Riley)</i> This is... huge.

347
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,147
It's prison huge.

348
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:03,522
You are gonna go to prison,
you know that?

349
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,890
Yeah, probably.

350
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,378
So that would bother most people.

351
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:13,568
Ian's gonna try and steal it. And if he
succeeds, he'll destroy the Declaration.

352
00:27:13,638 --> 00:27:16,867
The fact is, the only way to protect
the Declaration <i>is</i> to steal it.

353
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:19,421
It's upside down.

354
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,044
I don't think there's a choice.

355
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,139
Ben, for God's sakes,

356
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:29,694
it's like stealing a national monument. OK?

357
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:31,872
It's like stealing him.

358
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:36,482
It can't be done. Not shouldn't be done.
It <i>can't</i> be done.

359
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,100
Let me prove it to you.

360
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:42,784
OK, Ben, pay attention.

361
00:27:42,856 --> 00:27:45,638
I've brought you to the Library of Congress.

362
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:49,183
Why? Because it's the biggest library
in the world.

363
00:27:49,256 --> 00:27:51,328
Over 20 million books.

364
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,767
And they're all saying
the same exact thing:

365
00:27:53,832 --> 00:27:56,101
Listen to Riley.

366
00:27:56,168 --> 00:28:00,740
What we have here, my friend,
is an entire layout of the archives.

367
00:28:00,808 --> 00:28:03,197
Short of builders' blueprints.

368
00:28:03,273 --> 00:28:07,135
You've got construction orders,
phone lines,

369
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:10,726
water and sewage -
it's all here.

370
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:13,760
Now, when the Declaration
is on display, OK,

371
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:17,281
it is surrounded by guards
and video monitors

372
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:21,151
<i>and a little family from Iowa and little kids</i>
<i>on their eighth-grade field trip.</i>

373
00:28:21,226 --> 00:28:25,798
<i>And beneath an inch of bulletproof glass</i>
<i>is an army of sensors and heat monitors</i>

374
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:29,030
<i>that will go off if someone gets too close</i>
<i>with a high fever.</i>

375
00:28:29,866 --> 00:28:32,386
Now, when it's not on display,

376
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:40,166
it is lowered into a four-foot-thick
concrete, steel-plated vault...

377
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:45,098
that happens to be equipped
with an electronic combination lock

378
00:28:45,164 --> 00:28:47,138
and biometric access-denial systems.

379
00:28:47,212 --> 00:28:50,790
You know, Thomas Edison tried and failed
nearly 2,000 times

380
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,657
to develop the carbonized cotton-thread
filament for the incandescent light bulb.

381
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,073
Edison?

382
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,147
When asked about it,
he said, "I didn't fail,

383
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,903
I found out 2,000 ways
how not to make a light bulb."

384
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:04,234
But he only needed to find one way
to make it work.

385
00:29:06,285 --> 00:29:09,318
The Preservation Room.
Enjoy. Go ahead.

386
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:13,864
Do you know
what the Preservation Room is for?

387
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:16,354
Delicious jams and jellies?

388
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,983
No. That's where they clean,
repair and maintain

389
00:29:19,054 --> 00:29:20,810
all the documents
and the storage housings

390
00:29:20,878 --> 00:29:23,049
when they're not on display or in the vault.

391
00:29:23,118 --> 00:29:27,209
Now, when the case needs work they take
it out of the vault, directly across the hall

392
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:29,034
<i>and into the Preservation Room.</i>

393
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:32,877
<i>The best time for us. Or Ian. To steal it</i>
<i>would be during the gala this weekend</i>

394
00:29:32,943 --> 00:29:35,943
<i>when the guards are distracted</i>
<i>by the VIPs upstairs.</i>

395
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:41,863
But we'll make our way to the Preservation
Room, where there's much less security.

396
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:44,554
Huh.

397
00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:46,893
Well, if Ian...

398
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,869
Uh...

399
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:51,463
Preservation... Hm.

400
00:29:51,536 --> 00:29:53,478
The gala, huh?

401
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,709
This might be possible.

402
00:29:58,384 --> 00:30:00,140
It might.

403
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,107
Ah...

404
00:30:32,562 --> 00:30:34,831
And we are in.

405
00:30:46,228 --> 00:30:48,911
There you are.
<i>(British accent)</i> Hello.

406
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,729
The hallway.

407
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:02,349
That's what I want.

408
00:31:15,478 --> 00:31:17,387
Game on.

409
00:31:50,296 --> 00:31:51,637
I'll buy that.

410
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,093
Cool.

411
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:30,870
This just came for you.

412
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,850
I hope it's not from Stan.

413
00:32:35,898 --> 00:32:40,273
"For the woman who has everything else...
Thanks for listening. Paul Brown."

414
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:17,042
<i>(insistent beeping)</i>

415
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,291
<i>(rings)</i>

416
00:33:23,198 --> 00:33:24,758
Abigail Chase.

417
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:41,205
Hey, Mike.

418
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,864
<i>- (man #1) Let's do this by the book.</i>
<i>- (man #2) Hallway is secure.</i>

419
00:33:47,936 --> 00:33:50,205
<i>- (man #1) Keep the document level.</i>
<i>- (man #2) No problem.</i>

420
00:33:50,975 --> 00:33:51,923
<i>(Abigail) What have you got?</i>

421
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:53,886
<i>(man) The heat sensor went off</i>
<i>in the Declaration frame.</i>

422
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:57,398
<i>(Abigail) Run full diagnostics</i>.
<i>Then I want them all changed out.</i>

423
00:33:57,472 --> 00:34:00,057
Our evil plan is working.

424
00:34:38,114 --> 00:34:40,056
Ben, are you sure that we should?

425
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:44,671
<i>(Ben) Riley.</i>

426
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,488
- Can you hear me?
<i>- Unfortunately. Yeah.</i>

427
00:34:47,556 --> 00:34:49,214
<i>We're all set in here.</i>

428
00:34:49,283 --> 00:34:52,479
You want to go around to the front
and present your invitation.

429
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,231
You're gonna have to show ID.
Go ahead, man.

430
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,369
Howdy.

431
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:09,085
I need your invitation
and your ID, please.

432
00:35:26,598 --> 00:35:28,769
<i>(Riley) How do you look?</i>

433
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:31,772
- Not bad.
<i>- Mazel tov.</i>

434
00:35:38,823 --> 00:35:40,732
This is it.

435
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,558
For you.

436
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:16,967
- Oh, Mr. Brown.
- Dr. Chase.

437
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:20,262
<i>- (Abigail) What are you doing here?</i>
- Is that that hot girl?

438
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:25,218
<i>- How does she look?</i>
- I made a last-minute donation. A big one.

439
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:27,842
Well, on that subject,
thank you for your wonderful gift.

440
00:36:27,914 --> 00:36:30,761
- Oh, you did get it? Good.
- Yes, thank you.

441
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:34,819
You know, I really couldn't accept
something like that normally, but...

442
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,799
I really want it.

443
00:36:36,874 --> 00:36:40,005
- Well, you needed it.
<i>- Come on. Romeo. Get outta there.</i>

444
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:43,937
I have been wondering, though,
what the engraving indicated

445
00:36:44,011 --> 00:36:47,109
- on the pipe that Big Foot took.
<i>- (man)</i> Hi.

446
00:36:47,531 --> 00:36:51,655
- Here you go.
- Oh, Dr. Herbert, this is Mr. Brown.

447
00:36:51,723 --> 00:36:52,802
- Hi.
- Hi there.

448
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:56,258
<i>- (Riley) Who's the stiff?</i>
- Here, why don't you let me take that?

449
00:36:56,332 --> 00:36:59,747
- So you can take that off his hands.
<i>- (Abigail)</i> Thank you.

450
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:02,883
A toast, yeah?

451
00:37:02,956 --> 00:37:05,028
To high treason.

452
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:08,362
That's what these men were committing
when they signed the Declaration.

453
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:13,447
Had we lost the war, they would have been
hanged, beheaded, drawn and quartered,

454
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:17,827
and - Oh! Oh, my personal favorite -
and had their entrails cut out and burned!

455
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:24,706
So, here's to the men
who did what was considered wrong

456
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:27,748
in order to do what they knew was right.

457
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:30,793
What they knew was right.

458
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:43,628
Well, good night.

459
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,833
- Good night.
- Good night.

460
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:03,501
<i>(Ian)</i> Yeah!

461
00:38:05,072 --> 00:38:06,217
OK, go! Go!

462
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:20,138
This better work.

463
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:26,988
Clear!

464
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:35,559
- On.
- Door one. 30 seconds.

465
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,992
How does it look?

466
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:51,150
It's working.
It's working...

467
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:52,593

Uh, no. Not here.

Stop chatting and get in the van.

We have a break-in.

Get the FBI on the phone.

If this is the real one, what did they get?

A souvenir.

I thought it'd be a good idea to have
a duplicate. It turned out I was right.

591
00:49:01,595 --> 00:49:07,672
I actually had to pay for the souvenir and
the real one, so you owe me $35, plus tax.

- Who were those men?

Just the guys we warned you
were gonna steal the Declaration.

And you didn't believe us.

the Declaration of Independence.

Do we have a name on the tipster?

612

There was no file opened.
We didn't find the information credible.

613

How about now?

614
00:50:19,681 --> 00:50:23,609
There is <i>not</i> a treasure map on the back
of the Declaration of Independence.

615
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,455
And there's no chance
anyone can steal this either.

I leveled with you 100 percent.
Everything I told you was the truth.

OK, my name's not Brown.
It's Gates.

I leveled with you 98 percent.

620
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:41,786
Wait a minute, did you just say "Gates"?

621
00:50:42,786 --> 00:50:44,379
Gates?

622
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,799
You're that family with the conspiracy
theory about the Founding Fathers?

623
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:51,136
- It's not a conspiracy theory.
- Per se.

624
00:50:51,203 --> 00:50:54,880
You know what? I take it back.
You're not liars. You're insane.

625
00:50:54,947 --> 00:50:57,085
There's a copy of the Declaration
on display now?

626
00:50:57,155 --> 00:50:59,260
- Yes, we decided to...
- Leave it there.

627
00:50:59,331 --> 00:51:01,818
The guests know something happened,
but they don't know what.

628
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:04,957
They got him with a Taser at the service
entrance. He doesn't remember a thing.

629
00:51:05,027 --> 00:51:07,067
Also, we found bullet casings.

630
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:08,732
Did we get a description
from the other guards?

631
00:51:08,803 --> 00:51:11,672
- Which guards?
- The guards that were fired upon.

632
00:51:11,748 --> 00:51:15,709
There weren't any other guards
on patrol down here.

633
00:51:16,004 --> 00:51:18,109
So...

634
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:21,278
who was shooting,
who were they shooting at,

635
00:51:21,348 --> 00:51:23,617
and why weren't they getting along?

636
00:51:23,685 --> 00:51:26,402
You can't seriously intend
to run chemical tests

637
00:51:26,469 --> 00:51:29,535
on the Declaration of Independence
in the back of a moving van.

638
00:51:29,605 --> 00:51:31,198
We have a clean-room environment
all set up.

639
00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:34,367
EDS suits, a particulate air filtration
system, the whole shebang.

640
00:51:34,437 --> 00:51:36,892
- Really?
- We can't go back there.

641
00:51:36,965 --> 00:51:38,655
What? Why not?

642
00:51:38,725 --> 00:51:42,402
This is the guy. Dr. Herbert said
Dr. Chase introduced him as Mr. Brown.

643
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:43,713
Not on the guestlist.

644
00:51:43,782 --> 00:51:47,743
Now, the gift-store clerk - she said
he seemed... Well, she said "flustered."

645
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:50,661
He tried to walk out with a copy
of the Declaration of Independence

646
00:51:50,727 --> 00:51:52,636
without paying.

647
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,619
He paid with a Visa.

648
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,727
"Charge to Benjamin Gates."

649
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:00,417
A credit-card slip?

650
00:52:00,487 --> 00:52:02,080
Dude, we're on the grid.

651
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:04,900
They'll have your records from forever.
They'll have my records from forever.

652
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:08,349
I know. I know. It's only a matter of minutes
before the FBI shows up at my front door.

653
00:52:08,423 --> 00:52:10,430
What do we do?

654
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:13,121
- We need those letters.
- What letters?

655
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:17,373
<i>(Ben)</i> You know, get off the road,
take a right.

656
00:52:17,448 --> 00:52:19,204
<i>(Abigail)</i> What letters?

657
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:24,863
You have the original Silence Dogood
letters? Did you steal those, too?

658
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:26,944
We have scans of the originals.

659
00:52:27,017 --> 00:52:29,766
- Quiet, please.
- How'd you get scans?

660
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:33,248
Oh, I know the person
who has the originals. Now shush.

661
00:52:36,169 --> 00:52:40,391
- Why do you need them?
- She really can't shut her mouth, can she?

662
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:43,971
I'll tell you what, look.
I will let you hold onto this

663
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:46,759
if you'll promise to shut up, please.

664
00:52:46,826 --> 00:52:49,281
Thank you.

665
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:52,263
- Ben, you know what you have to do.
- I know what to do.

666
00:52:52,331 --> 00:52:54,949
I'm just trying to think
of anything else we could do.

667
00:52:55,018 --> 00:52:57,636
Well, not to be a, uh, nudge,

668
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:01,569
but you do realize how many people
we have after us.

669
00:53:01,643 --> 00:53:04,807
We probably have
our own satellite by now.

670
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:11,146
It took you all of two seconds to decide
to steal the Declaration of Independence.

671
00:53:11,212 --> 00:53:15,009
Yeah, but I didn't think I was gonna
personally have to tell my dad about it.

672
00:53:15,084 --> 00:53:17,637
Hey, not cool! Not cool!

673
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,748
Let me go!

674
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,992
OK. You're let go. Go, shoo.

675
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,264
I'm not going. Not without the Declaration.

676
00:53:24,332 --> 00:53:27,179
You're not going <i>with</i> the Declaration.

677
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:30,758
Yes, I am. I'm not letting it
out of my sight, so I'm going.

678
00:53:30,829 --> 00:53:33,927
Wait. You're not going with us
with the Declaration.

679
00:53:33,997 --> 00:53:37,161
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

680
00:53:38,158 --> 00:53:40,263
Look, if you wanted to leave me behind,

681
00:53:40,334 --> 00:53:43,650
you shouldn't have told me
where you were going.

682
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:46,754
<i>(groans)</i>

683
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,699
<i>(police radios)</i>

684
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:00,612
Clear.

685
00:54:01,327 --> 00:54:03,498
What the...

686
00:54:04,879 --> 00:54:07,497
<i>(Sadusky)</i> Now we're getting somewhere.

687
00:54:08,463 --> 00:54:12,107
<i>(woman)</i> They're digital scans of letters
to the editor of <i>The New England Courant.</i>

688
00:54:12,175 --> 00:54:14,793
Written 1722.

689
00:54:14,864 --> 00:54:19,054
They're all from the same person.
"Your humble servant, Silence Dogood."

690
00:54:34,001 --> 00:54:35,888
Gentlemen...

691
00:54:35,953 --> 00:54:39,979
why is this word capitalized?

692
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:43,726
Because it's important?

693
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:48,111
Because it's a name.

694
00:54:48,178 --> 00:54:51,047
OK, I got it.
When Ben Franklin was only 15 years old

695
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:53,936
he secretly wrote 14 letters
to his brother's newspaper

696
00:54:54,003 --> 00:54:57,548
pretending to be a middle-aged widow
named Silence Dogood.

697
00:54:57,618 --> 00:55:00,203
These letters were written
by Benjamin Franklin.

698
00:55:06,867 --> 00:55:09,168
<i>(Riley)</i> Looks OK.

699
00:55:09,235 --> 00:55:11,755
- Park a couple of blocks away.
- Well, how long do you think we got?

700
00:55:11,828 --> 00:55:15,308
I'm gonna give them a couple of hours
at least. I hope.

701
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:19,209
What do we do about her?
I've got some duct tape in the back.

702
00:55:19,284 --> 00:55:21,455
<i>(Ben)</i> No, that won't be necessary.
She won't be any trouble.

703
00:55:21,524 --> 00:55:24,622
- Promise you won't be any trouble.
- I promise.

704
00:55:24,692 --> 00:55:26,546
See? She's curious.

705
00:55:30,229 --> 00:55:34,506
Here's what I got on Gates. A degree
in American History from Georgetown,

706
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,719
a degree in Mechanical Engineering
at MIT,

707
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:40,138
Navy ROTC and Naval Diving
and Salvage Training Center.

708
00:55:40,213 --> 00:55:41,739
Hm.

709
00:55:41,813 --> 00:55:44,431
What in the world did this guy
want to be when he grew up?

710
00:55:44,501 --> 00:55:46,410
We keep our focus on Gates.

711
00:55:46,486 --> 00:55:48,722
Run him to ground.

712
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:52,368
Compile a family-and-friends list.
Closest relative first.

713
00:55:52,854 --> 00:55:55,472
I want to find out who this guy is.

714
00:55:56,664 --> 00:55:58,573
<i>(doorbell)</i>

715
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:05,043
Dad.

716
00:56:07,353 --> 00:56:09,262
Where's the party?

717
00:56:09,785 --> 00:56:11,857
Uh, well, uh...

718
00:56:11,929 --> 00:56:14,350
I'm in a little trouble.

719
00:56:14,425 --> 00:56:16,945
- Is she pregnant?
<i>- (Ben)</i> Well, if she is,

720
00:56:17,018 --> 00:56:21,295
are you gonna leave the woman carrying
your grandchild standing out in the cold?

721
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,671
I look pregnant?

722
00:56:28,187 --> 00:56:31,285
This better not be about
that dumb treasure.

723
00:56:36,315 --> 00:56:38,868
Well, have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.

724
00:56:38,939 --> 00:56:42,648
There's some pizza.
It's still warm, I think.

725
00:56:42,715 --> 00:56:44,209
Dad...

726
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:50,874
I need the Silence Dogood letters.
Yeah, it's about the treasure.

727
00:56:50,939 --> 00:56:52,881
And he dragged you two
into this nonsense?

728
00:56:52,956 --> 00:56:55,345
- Literally.
- I volunteered.

729
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:58,518
Well, unvolunteer,
before you waste your life.

730
00:56:58,588 --> 00:57:01,490
- Knock it off, Dad.
- Sure, sure, I know, I'm the family kook.

731
00:57:01,564 --> 00:57:03,768
I have a job, a house, health insurance.

732
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:07,830
At least I had your mother, for however
brief a time. At least I had you.

733
00:57:07,901 --> 00:57:10,072
What do you have? Him?

734
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:15,254
Look, if you just give us the letters,
we're gone.

735
00:57:15,326 --> 00:57:17,180
You disappoint me, Ben.

736
00:57:17,246 --> 00:57:22,134
Well, maybe that's the real Gates-family
legacy. Sons who disappoint their fathers.

737
00:57:23,582 --> 00:57:26,102
Get out. Take your troubles with you.

738
00:57:31,295 --> 00:57:33,716
I found the <i>Charlotte.</i>

739
00:57:37,919 --> 00:57:39,828
The <i>Charlotte?</i>

740
00:57:40,671 --> 00:57:43,420
- You mean she was a ship?
- Yeah, she was beautiful.

741
00:57:43,487 --> 00:57:44,469
It was amazing, Dad.

742
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:47,194
And the treasure?

743
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:49,914
No, no. But we found another clue
that led us here.

744
00:57:49,984 --> 00:57:52,569
Yeah, and that'll lead you
to another clue.

745
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,127
And that's all you'll ever find,
is another clue. Don't you get it, Ben?

746
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,574
I finally figured it out.

747
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,771
The legend says that the treasure
was buried to keep it from the British.

748
00:57:59,841 --> 00:58:02,459
But what really happened
was the legend was invented,

749
00:58:02,529 --> 00:58:06,620
to keep the British occupied
searching for buried treasure.

750
00:58:06,689 --> 00:58:09,820
The treasure is a myth.

751
00:58:09,889 --> 00:58:12,158
I refuse to believe that.

752
00:58:17,153 --> 00:58:21,244
Well, you can believe what you want.
You're a grown person. What am I doing?

753
00:58:21,314 --> 00:58:24,412
Do what you want, Ben.
Do what you want.

754
00:58:25,858 --> 00:58:30,430
He's probably right. You don't even know
if there is another clue.

755
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:36,699
Well, I can think of a way where we could
find out. And we can find out right now.

756
00:58:54,116 --> 00:58:56,123
Looks like animal skin.

757
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:59,773
- How old is it?
- At least 200 years.

758
00:58:59,844 --> 00:59:03,422
- Really? You sure?
- Pretty darn.

759
00:59:03,492 --> 00:59:05,881
Now if this thing's in invisible ink,
how do we look at it?

760
00:59:05,956 --> 00:59:07,199
Throw it in the oven.

761
00:59:07,268 --> 00:59:08,794
<i>- (Abigail and Ben)</i> No.
- Uh-uh.

762
00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:11,422
Ferrous sulfate inks can only
be brought out with heat.

763
00:59:11,493 --> 00:59:14,559
- Yes, but this...
- It's very old.

764
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:20,096
This is very old, and we can't
risk compromising the map.

765
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:21,343
You need a reagent.

766
00:59:21,413 --> 00:59:23,998
Dad, it's really late.
Why don't you get some rest?

767
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:26,459
I'm fine.

768
00:59:26,534 --> 00:59:28,290
Lemons.

769
00:59:34,631 --> 00:59:36,867
- You can't do that.
- But it has to be done.

770
00:59:36,934 --> 00:59:41,058
Then someone who is trained to handle
antique documents is gonna do it.

771
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:43,845
OK.

772
00:59:45,608 --> 00:59:47,201
OK.

773
00:59:48,328 --> 00:59:51,262
Now, uh, if there is a secret message,

774
00:59:51,335 --> 00:59:56,420
it'll probably be marked by a symbol
in the upper right-hand corner.

775
00:59:56,488 --> 00:59:58,048
That's right.

776
01:00:01,673 --> 01:00:03,974
I am so getting fired for this.

777
01:00:34,122 --> 01:00:36,805
I told you. You need heat.

778
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:48,128
<i>(both exhale)</i>

779
01:00:54,124 --> 01:00:55,717
See?

780
01:00:58,316 --> 01:01:00,323
- We need more juice.
- We need more heat.

781
01:01:14,285 --> 01:01:16,586
That's not a map.

782
01:01:16,653 --> 01:01:19,653
- Is it?
- More clues. What a surprise.

783
01:01:19,725 --> 01:01:21,350
<i>(Riley)</i> Are those latitudes and longitudes?

784
01:01:21,421 --> 01:01:23,876
That's why we need
the Silence Dogood letters.

785
01:01:23,949 --> 01:01:26,883
- That's the key?
- Yeah. "The key in Silence undetected."

786
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:28,518
Dad, can we have the letters now?

787
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:32,867
Will somebody please explain to me
what these magic numbers are?

788
01:01:32,942 --> 01:01:35,309
- It's an Ottendorf cipher.
- That's right.

789
01:01:35,374 --> 01:01:37,130
Oh, OK.

790
01:01:37,198 --> 01:01:40,012
- What's an Ottendorf cipher?
- They're just codes.

791
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,235
Each of these three numbers
corresponds to a word in a key.

792
01:01:44,303 --> 01:01:47,020
Usually a random book
or a newspaper article.

793
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:49,159
<i>(Ben)</i> In this case,
the Silence Dogood letters.

794
01:01:49,231 --> 01:01:51,532
So it's like the page number
of the key text,

795
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,795
the line on the page,
and the letter in that line.

796
01:01:54,864 --> 01:01:57,351
So, Dad, where are the letters?

797
01:01:57,424 --> 01:02:02,246
You know, it's just by sheer happenstance
that his grandfather...

798
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,465
- Dad.
...even found them.

799
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:05,740
They were in an antique desk
from the press room...

800
01:02:05,808 --> 01:02:07,401
- Dad.
...of <i>The New England Courant.</i>

801
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:10,407
- That's a newspaper.
- Dad, where are the letters?

802
01:02:10,481 --> 01:02:13,131
I don't have them, son.

803
01:02:13,201 --> 01:02:15,851
- What?
- I don't have them.

804
01:02:20,689 --> 01:02:22,379
<i>(Ben clears throat)</i>

805
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:23,759
Where are they?

806
01:02:23,825 --> 01:02:27,174
I donated them to the Franklin Institute
in Philadelphia.

807
01:02:27,762 --> 01:02:29,671
Time to go.

808
01:02:30,674 --> 01:02:35,147
I still can't believe it. All this time
no one knew what was on the back.

809
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:36,625
- The back of what?
- Whoa!

810
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:38,731
No!

811
01:02:38,803 --> 01:02:41,192
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- I know.

812
01:02:41,267 --> 01:02:43,787
Oh, my God. What have you done?
This is... this is the...

813
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:46,509
- I know!
- This is the Declaration of Independence.

814
01:02:46,579 --> 01:02:49,612
Yes. And it's very delicate.

815
01:02:49,684 --> 01:02:51,789
You stole it?

816
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:57,010
Dad, I can explain, but I don't have time.
It was necessary. And you saw the cipher.

817
01:02:57,075 --> 01:02:59,693
And that will lead to another clue,
and that will lead to another clue!

818
01:02:59,764 --> 01:03:02,993
There is no treasure.
I wasted 20 years of my life.

819
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,809
And now you've destroyed yours.

820
01:03:06,613 --> 01:03:08,685
And you pulled me into all this.

821
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:12,177
Well, we can't have that.

822
01:03:12,245 --> 01:03:14,252
<i>(police radio)</i>

823
01:03:14,325 --> 01:03:16,234
<i>(doorbell)</i>

824
01:03:16,629 --> 01:03:19,116
<i>(Patrick)</i> Come in!

825
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,099
I'm in here.

826
01:03:22,037 --> 01:03:23,946
FBI, right?

827
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,906
You gonna untie me?

828
01:03:32,502 --> 01:03:34,869
And you have no idea where he's going?

829
01:03:34,934 --> 01:03:38,862
- Well, wouldn't I have told you if I did?
- Would you?

830
01:03:38,935 --> 01:03:40,975
He tied me to a chair.

831
01:03:41,047 --> 01:03:44,941
The garage is empty, but there's a Cadillac
De Ville registered to Patrick Gates.

832
01:03:45,015 --> 01:03:46,989
And he stole my car.

833
01:03:47,415 --> 01:03:50,928
Don't worry, Mr. Gates, we'll find your car.
And your son.

834
01:03:53,431 --> 01:03:55,700
Your dad's got a sweet ride.

835
01:03:55,768 --> 01:03:58,517
I think we should change clothes.

836
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,005
We look kind of conspicuous,
don't you think?

837
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,949
I'd love to go shopping, too,
but we have no money.

838
01:04:04,024 --> 01:04:05,998
Here, I took this from his house.

839
01:04:06,072 --> 01:04:09,585
He usually tucks a few hundred dollars
somewhere between those pages.

840
01:04:09,657 --> 01:04:13,715
<i>- Common Sense.</i> How appropriate.
- When are we gonna get there?

841
01:04:13,785 --> 01:04:17,232
I'm hungry. This car smells weird.

842
01:04:38,683 --> 01:04:40,112
<i>(faint ping)</i>

843
01:04:48,443 --> 01:04:49,620
<i>(ping)</i>

844
01:04:59,868 --> 01:05:01,908
Excuse me.

845
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,794
Excuse me. Oops, sorry, sir. Excuse me.

846
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,834
That's OK.

847
01:05:09,628 --> 01:05:11,537
<i>(car horn)</i>

848
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:15,028
S-S-A-N-D.

849

850
01:05:18,109 --> 01:05:20,694
You're sure this is right?

01:05:22,078 --> 01:05:23,387
OK.

852
01:05:23,454 --> 01:05:25,210
S-S-A...

853
01:05:26,206 --> 01:05:27,929
No, N.

854
01:05:27,998 --> 01:05:31,096
- That is an N.
- It doesn't look like an N.

855
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:36,154
You know what? Here. Last one. OK?

856
01:05:37,343 --> 01:05:39,514
- One more dollar.
- Thank you.

857
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:42,102
Go get the last four letters.

858
01:05:42,175 --> 01:05:44,509
Go get 'em, chief. Come on.

859
01:06:01,856 --> 01:06:06,111
OK. "The vision to see the treasured past

860
01:06:06,176 --> 01:06:12,373
comes as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of pass and..."

861
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:14,969
"Pass and..." what?

862
01:06:27,906 --> 01:06:30,459
"Pass and..."

863
01:06:55,427 --> 01:06:57,848
What's going on?

864
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:01,729
- I'm not sure.
- What's up?

865
01:07:04,164 --> 01:07:07,459
<i>(Abigail)</i> So you show up at your father's
door and say you're in trouble

866
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:11,233
and the first thing he assumes
is I'm pregnant.

867
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,601
Is there a question in there?

868
01:07:13,668 --> 01:07:16,123
I think there's an interesting story
in there.

869
01:07:16,197 --> 01:07:20,091
Well, my father thinks I've been
a little too cavalier in my personal life.

870
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:22,750
- I see.
- Let me ask you something.

871
01:07:22,821 --> 01:07:25,635
Have you ever told someone -
not a relative - "I love you?"

872
01:07:25,701 --> 01:07:27,839
Yes.

873
01:07:27,909 --> 01:07:30,462
More than one someone?

874
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:32,708
Yes.

875
01:07:32,774 --> 01:07:34,596
Oh. Well, then my father would say

876
01:07:34,662 --> 01:07:37,923
you've been a little too cavalier
in your personal life, too.

877
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:41,306
So you get your sense of absolute certainty
from him, do you?

878
01:07:41,383 --> 01:07:43,237
Well, I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

879
01:07:43,303 --> 01:07:47,875
Well, you're certain the treasure is real,
despite what anyone else thinks.

880
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:49,372
No, but I hope it's real.

881
01:07:49,447 --> 01:07:53,789
I mean, I've dreamt it's real
since my grandfather told me about it.

882
01:07:53,863 --> 01:07:56,994
But I want to hold it.
I feel like I'm so close, I can taste it.

883
01:07:57,064 --> 01:08:01,603
But I just... I just want to know it's not just
something in my head or in my heart.

884
01:08:05,384 --> 01:08:08,198
People don't really talk that way, you know.

885
01:08:08,264 --> 01:08:11,744
I know. But they think that way.

886
01:08:17,609 --> 01:08:18,502
Hey.

887
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:20,478
- Did you get it? Riley?
- Oh, I got it.

888
01:08:20,553 --> 01:08:24,164
"The vision to see
the treasured past comes

889
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:29,383
as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of Pass and Stow."

890
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:32,167
Now, "Pass and Stow," of course,
referring to...

891
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,982
<i>- (both)</i> The Liberty Bell.
- Why do you have to do that?

892
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:37,439
Well, John Pass and John Stow
cast the bell.

893
01:08:37,514 --> 01:08:40,612
OK. Well, then, what does
the rest of this mean?

894
01:08:40,682 --> 01:08:45,221
Wait..."The vision to see the treasured
past" must refer to a way to read the map.

895
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:46,752
Well, I thought the cipher was the map.

896
01:08:46,827 --> 01:08:49,576
No, the cipher was a way
to find the way to read the map.

897
01:08:49,643 --> 01:08:51,236
And the way to read the map can be found

898
01:08:51,307 --> 01:08:55,682
where the "timely shadow" crosses
in front of the Liberty Bell.

899
01:08:55,755 --> 01:08:58,886
Crosses in front of the "house"
of the Liberty Bell. Independence Hall.

900
01:08:58,956 --> 01:09:02,305
Right, so "timely shadow" -
it's a specific time.

901
01:09:02,796 --> 01:09:04,803
- Right.
- Uh, what time?

902
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:07,558
What time? What time?

903
01:09:08,205 --> 01:09:11,303
Wait a minute, wait.
You're gonna love this.

904
01:09:11,372 --> 01:09:14,852
Excuse me, can I see one of those
hundred-dollar bills I paid you with?

905
01:09:14,925 --> 01:09:16,451
No.

906
01:09:16,941 --> 01:09:20,257
Oh. Well, uh, here,
I have this diver's watch.

907
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:22,983
It's called a Submariner. I dive with it.
It's actually quite valuable.

908
01:09:23,053 --> 01:09:25,060
- You can use it as collateral.
- Whatever.

909
01:09:25,134 --> 01:09:26,595
Thank you.

910
01:09:26,669 --> 01:09:29,287
On the back of a hundred-dollar bill
is an etching of Independence Hall

911
01:09:29,358 --> 01:09:30,918
- based on a painting done in...
- Hello.

912
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:33,194
Thank you.
...in the 1780s, who...

913
01:09:33,262 --> 01:09:36,578
The artist was actually a friend
of Benjamin Franklin's. It's wonderful.

914
01:09:36,654 --> 01:09:38,180
<i>- (clerk)</i> Fascinating.
- Hold this.

915
01:09:38,254 --> 01:09:40,196
OK.

916
01:09:40,654 --> 01:09:42,694
I'm not going anywhere.

917
01:09:43,182 --> 01:09:46,629
Now, I think that if we look
at this clock tower...

918
01:09:47,695 --> 01:09:50,280
...we may find the specific time.

919
01:09:52,976 --> 01:09:56,042
<i>- (Abigail)</i> What do you see?
- 2:22.

920
01:09:56,112 --> 01:09:59,373
- What time is it now?
- Almost three.

921
01:10:00,559 --> 01:10:03,755
- We missed it.
- No, we didn't.

922
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:06,541
We didn't miss it because... uh...

923
01:10:06,608 --> 01:10:10,732
You don't know this? I-I know something
about history that you don't know.

924
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,742
I'd be very excited to learn about it, Riley.

925
01:10:12,816 --> 01:10:16,012
Well, hold on one second, let me just...
let me just take in this moment.

926
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,501
This is... this is cool.

927
01:10:18,577 --> 01:10:22,221
Is this how you feel all the time? Because,
you know... Except for now, of course.

928

- Riley!
- All right.

929
01:10:24,369 --> 01:10:29,486
What I know is that daylight savings
wasn't established until World War I.

930
01:10:29,554 --> 01:10:34,955

Yeah.

933
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:42,730

to suggest daylight savings was?

Just a bunch of letters.
I can't remember.

It could have been seen for miles around,
which was exactly its purpose,

943

of the crack occurred,

"The vision to see the treasured past."
Let me take this.

Aw, they're like early American
X-ray specs.

967
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,785
Benjamin Franklin invented
something like these.

Could you please be careful?

That's some story.

Well, it's the same story I tried to tell you

- By you.
- No, by Ian. I stole it to stop him.

1069
01:22:38,305 --> 01:22:41,403
I did it alone.
Dr. Chase was not involved.

And Ian still ended up with
the Declaration of Independence.

Because of you.

1072

So here's your options.

1073
01:22:50,722 --> 01:22:54,616
Door number one,
you go to prison for a very long time.

Door number two, we are going to get back
the Declaration of Independence,

1075
01:23:00,034 --> 01:23:04,638
you help us find it, and you still
go to prison for a very long time,

1076
01:23:04,707 --> 01:23:07,074
but you feel better inside.

1077
01:23:07,139 --> 01:23:10,400
Is there a door that doesn't lead to prison?

1078

- Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.
- Yeah.

So what are these for?

It's a way to read the map.

Right.

Freemasons.

Invisible treasure map.

1085
01:23:28,517 --> 01:23:32,161
- So what'd it say?
- "Heere at the wall."

1086
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:34,650
Nothing else.

1087
01:23:34,725 --> 01:23:37,114
It's just another clue.

1088
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:39,676
<i>(agent)</i> It looks like Ian Howe
could be a false identity.

1089
01:23:39,749 --> 01:23:42,302
<i>(Sadusky)</i> Follow up with ATF and INS.

1090

- Standard tap procedure.
- Let's check the signal, folks.

1092
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:49,986
- Lock it in.
- Are we set?

1093
01:23:50,054 --> 01:23:53,087
- Checking source.
- Unknown number.

<i>(cell phone rings)</i>

1095
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:57,280
Yes.

1096

<i>(Ian) Hello. Ben. How are you?</i>

1097
01:23:59,975 --> 01:24:03,291
- Um, chained to a desk.
<i>- Sorry to hear that.</i>

1098
01:24:03,783 --> 01:24:06,336
I want you to meet me on the flight deck
of the <i>USS Intrepid.</i>

1099
01:24:06,407 --> 01:24:08,381
<i>- You know where that is?</i>
- New York.

1100
01:24:08,807 --> 01:24:10,781
<i>Meet me there at ten o'clock</i>
<i>tomorrow morning.</i>

1101
01:24:10,856 --> 01:24:14,205
And bring those glasses
you found at Independence Hall.

1102
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,549
<i>Yeah. I know about the glasses.</i>

1103
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:21,255
We can take a look at the Declaration,
and then you can be on your way.

1104
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,043
And I'm supposed to believe that.

1105
01:24:23,112 --> 01:24:25,730
<i>I told you from the start</i>.
<i>I only wanted to borrow it.</i>

1106
01:24:26,184 --> 01:24:28,038
You can have it. And the glasses.

1107
01:24:28,104 --> 01:24:31,781
<i>I'll even throw in the pipe</i>
<i>from the Charlotte.</i>

1108
01:24:31,848 --> 01:24:33,506
I'll be there.

1109
01:24:33,577 --> 01:24:36,479
<i>And tell the FBI agents</i>
<i>listening in on this call</i>

1110

<i>if they want the Declaration back</i>.
<i>And not just a box of confetti</i>.

1111
01:24:40,393 --> 01:24:42,694
Then you'll come alone.

1112
01:24:55,179 --> 01:24:57,862
<i>- (Sadusky on radio) Take positions.</i>
<i>- Perimeter looks normal.</i>

1113
01:24:57,930 --> 01:25:01,159
<i>- (man) Can I get a status report?</i>
<i>- Crow's nest in position. Port side is quiet.</i>

1114
01:25:01,227 --> 01:25:02,656
<i>(man) Copy that.</i>

1115
01:25:12,364 --> 01:25:15,844
- Gates is on the flight deck.
- Eyes on Gates.

1116
01:25:15,915 --> 01:25:19,013
<i>- Do not lose sight of primary mark.</i>
<i>- Brian. You're clear with N YPD.</i>

1117
01:25:19,084 --> 01:25:21,505
- I have a visual.
- Gates.

1118
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:22,790
<i>Stay with the program.</i>

1119
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:26,024
I hope your agents are all under four feet
tall and wearing little scarves.

1120
01:25:26,092 --> 01:25:27,946
Otherwise Ian's gonna know they're here.

1121
01:25:28,013 --> 01:25:30,730
<i>As soon as he shows you the Declaration</i>.
<i>We'll move in.</i>

1122
01:25:30,797 --> 01:25:33,317
Don't try anything.
Just let us handle it.

1123
01:25:33,388 --> 01:25:37,349
You know, Agent Sadusky,
something I've noticed about fishing:

1124
01:25:37,421 --> 01:25:40,104
It never works out so well for the bait.

1125
01:25:46,414 --> 01:25:51,116
Sir, we've got some traffic incoming.
Looks like a sightseeing helicopter.

1126
01:25:51,182 --> 01:25:53,451
Unit two,
get an eyeball on that chopper.

1127
01:25:53,518 --> 01:25:56,867
Agent Michaels, get FAA flight plans
and authorization records on that craft.

1128
01:25:56,942 --> 01:26:00,138
If that's not Mr. Howe,
I want to know who it is.

1129
01:26:00,207 --> 01:26:04,265
- I got him. He's coming from the north.
- Gates. Are you with me?

1130
01:26:04,335 --> 01:26:08,012
Well, I'm sure not against you,
if that's what you're asking.

1131
01:26:25,456 --> 01:26:27,627
<i>(white noise)</i>

1132
01:26:27,697 --> 01:26:30,184
<i>(Gates drowned out by interference)</i>

1133
01:26:30,257 --> 01:26:32,591
We've got some interference
on Gates's mike, sir.

1134
01:26:32,657 --> 01:26:33,802
This I know.

1135
01:26:35,217 --> 01:26:37,638
<i>(Shaw)</i> Hello, Ben.

Thomas Edison needed only one way

1137
01:26:41,138 --> 01:26:43,439
Sound familiar?

1138
01:26:45,393 --> 01:26:47,498
<i>- Keep sightlines clear.</i>
<i>- (Sadusky) What's the devil's going on?</i>

1139
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:49,194
<i>There's a lot of commotion.</i>
<i>We can't see Gates.</i>

1140
01:26:49,266 --> 01:26:53,870
Go to the starboard observation point
behind the F-16 and here's what you do.

1141

<i>(heavy interference)</i>

<i>(Sadusky) Who's got Gates?</i>

1146

<i>- All agents. Report in.</i>
<i>- (agent) I can't see anything.</i>

1147
01:27:05,843 --> 01:27:09,007
<i>- (Sadusky) Did Gates speak to anybody?</i>
<i>- Target is moving.</i>

1148
01:27:09,075 --> 01:27:12,904
- He's heading towards the stern.
<i>- I've got him. He's coming this way.</i>

1149
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:14,987
Anyone got a view of our friend Ian Howe?

1150
01:27:15,059 --> 01:27:16,881
Ian Howe is not at the stern, sir.

1151
01:27:16,948 --> 01:27:20,079
<i>Then why is he heading there?</i>

1152
01:27:20,148 --> 01:27:23,181
<i>He's at the observation deck.</i>

1153
01:27:23,252 --> 01:27:24,266
Sadusky.

1154
01:27:24,692 --> 01:27:26,546
<i>I'm still not against you.</i>

1155
01:27:26,612 --> 01:27:30,321
But I found door number three.
And I'm taking it.

1156
01:27:30,388 --> 01:27:32,330
- What's he talking about?
- Move in!

1157
01:27:32,405 --> 01:27:34,543
<i>Move in! Move in on Gates!</i>

1158
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:45,164
<i>Divers are a go.</i>

1159
01:27:45,237 --> 01:27:47,790

1160
01:27:47,861 --> 01:27:50,511
<i>- I repeat. Pursue at own risk.</i>
- You first.

1161
01:27:50,581 --> 01:27:53,101
Holy mackerel. He set us up.

1162

Sir, it's the Hudson. Nothing is visible.

1164
01:28:21,592 --> 01:28:23,501
Smart fish.

1165
01:28:41,209 --> 01:28:44,591
Hello, Ben. Welcome to New Jersey.

1166
01:28:45,594 --> 01:28:48,015
- What'd you do with Abigail and Riley?
- Hope these fit.

1167
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:49,550
We had to guess your sizes.

1168
01:28:49,626 --> 01:28:51,600
I said, what'd you do
with Abigail and Riley?

1169
01:28:51,673 --> 01:28:53,811
He's the only one who could've
told you that line about Edison.

1170
01:28:53,882 --> 01:28:55,791
Did you bring the glasses?

1171
01:28:55,866 --> 01:28:57,622
I don't know.
Tell me what's happening here.

1172
01:28:57,690 --> 01:29:00,210
Ask your girlfriend.

1173
01:29:00,282 --> 01:29:02,616
She's the one calling all the shots now.

1174
01:29:02,682 --> 01:29:05,332
She won't shut up.

1175
01:29:06,619 --> 01:29:08,407
<i>(cell phone rings)</i>

1176
01:29:08,475 --> 01:29:10,864
Yeah, hello.

1177
01:29:10,939 --> 01:29:13,110
It's for you.

1178
01:29:13,563 --> 01:29:17,338
- Hello.
- Hi, sweetie. How's your day going?

1179
01:29:17,403 --> 01:29:19,410
<i>Uh. Interesting. Dear.</i>

1180
01:29:19,484 --> 01:29:21,851
So, what, you working with Ian now?

1181
01:29:22,428 --> 01:29:26,290
It turns out helping someone escape
from FBI custody is a criminal act.

1182
01:29:26,364 --> 01:29:27,771
And he's the only criminal we knew.

1183
01:29:27,836 --> 01:29:30,683
<i>- So we called him and made a deal.</i>
- Well, you're, um...

1184
01:29:30,748 --> 01:29:32,089
<i>(coughs)</i>

1185
01:29:32,156 --> 01:29:34,709
You're... you're... you're all right, yeah?
I mean you're safe?

1186
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:36,984
Yeah, we both are.

1187
01:29:37,053 --> 01:29:40,369
Riley's right here, doing
something clever with a computer.

1188
01:29:40,445 --> 01:29:42,452
I'm tracking him through the... Hey!

1189
01:29:42,525 --> 01:29:44,826
I'm tracking you through the GPS
in Shaw's phone.

1190
01:29:44,893 --> 01:29:48,024
They take a turn anywhere we don't want,
we'll know it. So don't worry.

1191
01:29:48,094 --> 01:29:53,364
If Ian tries to double-cross us, we can call
the FBI and tell them right where you are.

1192
01:29:53,438 --> 01:29:56,121
- And where to find Ian.
<i>- And where is that?</i>

1193
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:58,361
Right across the street
from where we're hiding,

1194
01:29:58,430 --> 01:30:00,317
at the intersection
of Wall Street and Broadway.

1195
01:30:00,862 --> 01:30:03,163
Well, you figured out the clue.

1196
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:06,328
<i>Simple. "Heere at the wall."</i>
<i>Wall Street and Broadway.</i>

1197
01:30:09,471 --> 01:30:11,478
Ben, there is a catch.

1198
01:30:11,551 --> 01:30:14,453
We made Ian believe
he could have the treasure.

1199
01:30:14,528 --> 01:30:16,437
It was the only way
we could get this far.

1200
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:18,649
He's here.

1201
01:30:25,824 --> 01:30:27,733
<i>(Riley)</i> Here we go.

1202
01:30:32,192 --> 01:30:33,174
Ben.

1203
01:30:33,248 --> 01:30:38,169
You all right? No broken bones?
A jump like that could kill a man.

1204
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,890
Naw, it was cool.
You should try it sometime.

1205
01:30:43,329 --> 01:30:46,973
The Declaration of Independence.
And the meerschaum pipe.

1206
01:30:47,489 --> 01:30:49,398
All yours.

1207
01:30:50,273 --> 01:30:53,568
- That's it?
- That's it.

1208
01:30:53,634 --> 01:30:57,660
I knew you'd keep your promise.
Now, where is it? Where's my treasure?

1209
01:30:57,730 --> 01:30:59,453
It's right here.

1210
01:30:59,522 --> 01:31:02,620
The map said "Heere at the wall,"
spelled with two E's.

1211
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:05,308
Wall Street follows the path
of an actual wall

1212
01:31:05,378 --> 01:31:08,378
that the original Dutch settlers built
as a defense to keep the British out.

1213
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:12,792
The main gate was located at a street
called De Heere, also two E's.

1214
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:15,420
Later De Heere Street was renamed
Broadway after the British got in.

1215
01:31:15,491 --> 01:31:17,946
So, "Heere at the wall."

1216
01:31:18,019 --> 01:31:21,314
Broadway, Wall Street.

1217
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:23,136
<i>(English accent)</i> Cheerio.

1218
01:31:24,516 --> 01:31:26,141
Just a moment, Ben.

1219
01:31:26,212 --> 01:31:30,816
Ian, if you break our deal, the FBI
will be only a few minutes behind you.

1220
01:31:30,884 --> 01:31:33,633
You might get away, you might not.

1221
01:31:37,029 --> 01:31:39,134
Is that all the map said?

1222
01:31:41,061 --> 01:31:43,166
Every word.

1223
01:31:45,061 --> 01:31:47,265
Oh, Ben.

1224
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:50,464
You know the key
to running a convincing bluff?

1225
01:31:50,534 --> 01:31:54,363
Every once in a while
you've got to be holding all the cards.

1226
01:32:04,742 --> 01:32:06,203
Dad.

1227
01:32:08,647 --> 01:32:11,364
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

1228
01:32:15,271 --> 01:32:18,500
Trinity Church. We have to go
inside Trinity Church.

1229
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,971
Good. Excellent.

1230
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,942
Well, why don't you ask Dr. Chase
and Riley to join us?

1231
01:32:27,016 --> 01:32:30,082
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

1232
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:37,469
Are you all right?

1233
01:32:37,544 --> 01:32:39,965
What do you think? I'm a hostage.

1234
01:32:41,417 --> 01:32:43,588
Sit. Sit down.

1235
01:32:43,657 --> 01:32:46,690
- Let him go, Ian.
- When we find the treasure.

1236
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:50,917
No, now. Or you can figure out
the clues for yourself.

1237
01:32:50,985 --> 01:32:52,773
Good luck.

1238
01:32:52,842 --> 01:32:54,216
Ben.

1239
01:32:54,282 --> 01:32:57,991
I don't think you fully appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

1240
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:08,457
Let's have a look at that map.

1241
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:44,546
It's, uh...

1242
01:33:46,509 --> 01:33:49,062
It's... it's really quite something. It's, uh...

1243
01:33:49,133 --> 01:33:51,434
It really is remarkable. Take a look.

1244
01:33:57,710 --> 01:34:01,638
<i>- (Ian)</i> "Parkington Lane."
- "Beneath Parkington Lane."

1245
01:34:01,711 --> 01:34:05,540
But why would the map lead us here,
then take us somewhere else?

1246
01:34:05,614 --> 01:34:08,003
- What's the purpose?
<i>- (Patrick)</i> Just another clue.

1247
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:12,585
Dad. No, you're right. Parkington Lane
has to be here somewhere.

1248
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:16,199
A street inside the church?

1249
01:34:16,271 --> 01:34:18,791
Not inside. Beneath.

1250
01:34:18,863 --> 01:34:20,772
Beneath the church.

1251
01:34:25,071 --> 01:34:27,492
- I'm so sorry, Ben.
- None of this is your fault.

1252
01:34:27,568 --> 01:34:28,615
- I co...
- Come on.

1253
01:34:37,937 --> 01:34:39,344
Look.

1254
01:34:40,689 --> 01:34:44,486
Cooperation only lasts as long
as the status quo is unchanged.

1255
01:34:44,561 --> 01:34:49,263
As soon as this guy gets to wherever this
thing ends, he won't need you anymore.

1256
01:34:49,329 --> 01:34:50,605
Or... or any of us.

1257
01:34:50,674 --> 01:34:54,351
So we find a way to make sure
the status quo changes in our favor.

1258
01:34:54,417 --> 01:34:58,192
- How?
- I'm still working on it.

1259
01:34:58,257 --> 01:35:01,257
Well, I guess I better
work on it too, then.

1260
01:35:01,330 --> 01:35:03,915
Hey! Par... Hey, I found it!

1261
01:35:03,986 --> 01:35:05,709
- Him!
- Ben!

1262
01:35:06,227 --> 01:35:08,136
It's a name.

1263
01:35:10,898 --> 01:35:12,588
Parkington Lane.

1264
01:35:12,658 --> 01:35:16,203
He was a third-degree master mason
of the Blue Lo...

1265
01:35:16,275 --> 01:35:18,479
Hey! Stop!

1266
01:35:32,213 --> 01:35:33,674
Easy.

1267
01:35:34,933 --> 01:35:37,038
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1268
01:35:37,109 --> 01:35:39,083
Careful no one steps in him.

1269
01:35:39,156 --> 01:35:41,196
All right, put it down.

1270
01:35:47,829 --> 01:35:52,750
OK. Who wants to go down
the creepy tunnel inside the tomb first?

1271
01:35:53,686 --> 01:35:57,941
Right. McGregor, Viktor, you stay here.

1272
01:35:58,454 --> 01:36:03,539
And if anyone should come out without me,
well... use your imagination.

1273
01:36:06,326 --> 01:36:08,235
Shall we?

1274
01:36:25,271 --> 01:36:27,954
You got a light?

Why does that never happen to me?

What's this?

It's a chandelier.

Here.

1282
01:37:57,022 --> 01:37:59,739

<i>- (Ben)</i> Look at the elevators.

1283
01:37:59,806 --> 01:38:01,366
<i>(Patrick)</i> A dumbwaiter system.

1284
01:38:01,438 --> 01:38:03,925
How do a bunch of guys with hand tools
build all this?

1285
01:38:03,998 --> 01:38:07,478
Same way they built the pyramids
and the Great Wall of China.

1286
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:10,517
Yeah. The aliens helped them.

1287
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:12,761
Right, let's go. What are we waiting for?

1288
01:38:13,150 --> 01:38:17,111
I'm not going out on that thing.
200 years of termite damage and rot.

1289
01:38:17,183 --> 01:38:20,085
Dad, do what he says.

1291

We're right under the Trinity graveyard.

1292
01:38:44,449 --> 01:38:46,969
That's probably why
no one ever found this.

Get down there!

The Declaration.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry I dropped you.
I had to save the Declaration.

1317

No, don't be. I would have done
exactly the same thing to you.

Really?

1319

it's not worth it.

Do you imagine any one of your lives
is more valuable to me than Shaw's?

1324
01:41:34,604 --> 01:41:35,847
We go on.

1325
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:41,377
The status quo.
Keep the status quo.

Well?

There isn't another clue.

The status quo has changed, son.

Don't.

1357
01:44:16,726 --> 01:44:20,403
It's part of freemason teachings.

1358
01:44:20,471 --> 01:44:23,766
In King Solomon's temple
there was a winding staircase.

1359
01:44:23,831 --> 01:44:29,548
It signified the journey that had to be made
to find the light of truth.

1360
01:44:29,623 --> 01:44:33,332
- The lantern is the clue.
- And what does it mean?

1361
01:44:33,399 --> 01:44:35,820
Boston. It's Boston.

1362
01:44:35,896 --> 01:44:37,521
The Old North Church in Boston,

1363
01:44:37,592 --> 01:44:40,941
where Thomas Newton
hung a lantern in the steeple,

1364
01:44:41,016 --> 01:44:44,791
to signal Paul Revere that the British
were coming. One if by land, two if by sea.

1365
01:44:44,856 --> 01:44:49,874
One lantern. Under the winding staircase
of the steeple, that's where we have to look.

1366
01:44:49,945 --> 01:44:53,174
- Thank you.
- Hey, you have to take us with you.

1367
01:44:53,241 --> 01:44:56,307
Why? So you can escape in Boston?

1368
01:44:56,377 --> 01:44:59,824
Besides, with you out of the picture
there's less baggage to carry.

1369
01:44:59,897 --> 01:45:02,068
What if we lied?

1370
01:45:02,137 --> 01:45:03,347
Did you?

1371
01:45:03,417 --> 01:45:06,067
What if there's another clue?

1372
01:45:06,137 --> 01:45:08,209
Then I'll know right where to find you.

See you, Ben.

1374

1377
01:45:21,211 --> 01:45:25,073
It's gonna be OK, Riley.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1378
01:45:25,147 --> 01:45:27,187
It's OK, kiddo.

1379
01:45:27,259 --> 01:45:32,660
OK, boys, what's going on? The British
came by sea. It was two lanterns, not one.

1380
01:45:32,731 --> 01:45:35,797
Ian needed another clue,
so we gave it to him.

1381
01:45:35,868 --> 01:45:38,650
It was a fake.
It was a fake clue.

1382
01:45:38,716 --> 01:45:41,203
The all-seeing eye.

1383
01:45:41,276 --> 01:45:43,643
"Through the all-seeing eye."

1384
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:47,249
That means... by the time Ian
figures it out and comes back here,

1385
01:45:47,324 --> 01:45:50,902
we'll still be trapped,
and he'll shoot us then.

1386
01:45:51,389 --> 01:45:53,942
Either way, we're gonna die.

1387
01:45:54,749 --> 01:45:57,913
Nobody's gonna die.
There's another way out.

1388
01:45:58,461 --> 01:45:59,475
Where?

1389
01:45:59,549 --> 01:46:02,069
Through the treasure room.

1390
01:46:08,574 --> 01:46:10,483
Here.

1391
01:46:19,870 --> 01:46:21,560
Riley.

1392
01:46:47,073 --> 01:46:50,368
Looks like someone got here first.

1393
01:46:51,552 --> 01:46:54,007
I'm sorry, Ben.

1394
01:46:54,081 --> 01:46:55,837
It's gone.

1395
01:46:58,241 --> 01:47:00,826
- Listen, Ben...
- It may have even been gone

1396
01:47:00,897 --> 01:47:04,639
before Charles Carroll
told the story to Thomas Gates.

1397
01:47:05,793 --> 01:47:07,833
It doesn't matter.

1398
01:47:07,905 --> 01:47:10,752
I know. 'Cause you were right.

1399
01:47:10,818 --> 01:47:13,567
No, I wasn't right.

1400
01:47:13,634 --> 01:47:16,219
This room is real, Ben.

1401
01:47:16,291 --> 01:47:18,527
And that means the treasure is real.

1402
01:47:19,011 --> 01:47:21,728
We're in the company of
some of the most brilliant minds in history,

1403
01:47:21,795 --> 01:47:25,472
because you found
what they left behind for us to find

1404
01:47:25,539 --> 01:47:28,026
and understood the meaning of it.

1405
01:47:28,099 --> 01:47:30,913
You did it, Ben. For all of us.

1406
01:47:31,875 --> 01:47:35,039
Your grandfather, and all of us.

1407
01:47:35,492 --> 01:47:39,354
And I've never been so happy
to be proven wrong.

1408
01:47:49,285 --> 01:47:51,357
I just...

1409
01:47:51,428 --> 01:47:54,395
really thought
I was gonna find the treasure.

1410
01:47:56,261 --> 01:47:58,115
OK.

1411
01:47:58,181 --> 01:48:00,831
Then we just keep looking for it.

1412
01:48:03,973 --> 01:48:05,882
I'm in.

1413
01:48:10,406 --> 01:48:12,162
OK.

1414
01:48:13,702 --> 01:48:16,735
Not to be Johnny Rain Cloud here,
but that's not gonna happen.

1415
01:48:16,806 --> 01:48:20,002
Because as far as I can see,
we're still trapped down here.

1416
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:22,459
<i>(Abigail)</i> Yeah.

1417
01:48:22,535 --> 01:48:24,357
<i>(Riley)</i> Now, Ben,
where is this other way out?

1418
01:48:24,423 --> 01:48:26,430
Well, that's it.
It doesn't make any sense,

1419
01:48:26,503 --> 01:48:29,569
because the first thing the builders
would have done after getting down here

1420
01:48:29,639 --> 01:48:32,573
was cut a secondary shaft back out for air...

1421
01:48:32,647 --> 01:48:35,680
- Right.
...and in case of cave-ins.

1422
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,967
Could it really be that simple?

1423
01:49:04,233 --> 01:49:06,371
"The secret lies with Charlotte."

1424
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:30,664
<i>(gasps)</i>

1425
01:50:30,735 --> 01:50:33,604
Scrolls from the library at Alexandria.

1426
01:50:35,632 --> 01:50:37,420
Could this be possible?

1427
01:50:54,769 --> 01:50:56,078
<i>(gasps)</i>

1428
01:50:56,145 --> 01:51:01,000
It's a big... bluish-green man,

1429
01:51:01,073 --> 01:51:03,822
with a strange-looking goatee.

1430
01:51:03,889 --> 01:51:06,572
I'm guessing that's significant.

1431
01:51:53,941 --> 01:51:54,889
Yes!

1432
01:52:06,230 --> 01:52:08,815
Riley, are you crying?

1433
01:52:08,885 --> 01:52:10,892
Look.

1434
01:52:10,966 --> 01:52:13,038
Stairs.

1435
01:52:20,023 --> 01:52:21,299
<i>(thud)</i>

1436
01:52:26,135 --> 01:52:27,728
<i>(coughs)</i>

1437
01:52:28,695 --> 01:52:30,669
Hi.

1438
01:52:30,742 --> 01:52:32,651
Do you have a cell phone I could borrow?

1439
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:48,109
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1440
01:52:48,184 --> 01:52:51,380
You do know you just handed me
your biggest bargaining chip?

1441
01:52:51,449 --> 01:52:54,613
The Declaration of Independence
is not a bargaining chip.

1442
01:52:54,681 --> 01:52:56,339
Not to me.

1443
01:52:56,408 --> 01:52:58,066
Have a seat.

1444
01:52:58,488 --> 01:53:01,270
- So what's your offer?
- Oh...

1445
01:53:01,337 --> 01:53:04,151
How about a bribe? Say, uh...

1446
01:53:05,113 --> 01:53:08,277
ten billion dollars?

1447
01:53:08,345 --> 01:53:09,938
I take it you found the treasure?

1448
01:53:10,009 --> 01:53:12,496
It's about five stories
beneath your shoes.

1449
01:53:13,945 --> 01:53:16,083
Hm.

1450
01:53:16,154 --> 01:53:18,194
You know, the Templars
and the Freemasons believed

1451
01:53:18,266 --> 01:53:22,805
that the treasure was too great
for any one man to have, not even a king.

1452
01:53:22,875 --> 01:53:26,486
That's why they went to such lengths
to keep it hidden.

1453
01:53:26,555 --> 01:53:28,856
That's right.

1454
01:53:28,923 --> 01:53:32,338
The Founding Fathers believed
the same thing about government.

1455
01:53:32,411 --> 01:53:35,542
I figure their solution
will work for the treasure too.

1456
01:53:35,995 --> 01:53:37,042
Give it to the people.

1457
01:53:37,115 --> 01:53:42,003
Divide it amongst the Smithsonian,
the Louvre, the Cairo museum...

1458
01:53:42,076 --> 01:53:45,076
There's thousands of years
of world history down there.

1459
01:53:45,148 --> 01:53:49,403
And it belongs to the world,
and everybody in it.

1460
01:53:49,468 --> 01:53:53,046
You really don't understand
the concept of a bargaining chip.

1461
01:53:53,628 --> 01:53:58,101
OK, here's what I want.
Dr. Chase gets off completely clean,

1462
01:53:58,172 --> 01:54:00,179
not even a little Post-it
on her service record.

1463
01:54:00,253 --> 01:54:01,114
OK.

1464
01:54:01,181 --> 01:54:07,161
I want the credit for the find
to go to the entire Gates family,

1465
01:54:07,229 --> 01:54:09,912
with the assistance of Mr. Riley Poole.

1466
01:54:09,981 --> 01:54:12,217
And what about you?

1467
01:54:12,286 --> 01:54:14,228
I'd really love not to go to prison.

1468
01:54:14,302 --> 01:54:19,059
I can't even begin to describe
how much I would love not to go to prison.

1469
01:54:20,254 --> 01:54:23,221
Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.

1470
01:54:23,294 --> 01:54:28,247
Well, if you've got a helicopter,
I think I can help with that.

1471
01:54:36,351 --> 01:54:38,587
<i>- (man)</i> Freeze! FBI!
<i>- (sirens)</i>

1472
01:54:40,607 --> 01:54:42,778

- Show me your hands!

1473
01:54:44,543 --> 01:54:47,859
- Put your hands up.
- Move, move, move.

1474
01:54:51,361 --> 01:54:53,183
You're under arrest, Mr. Howe.

1475
01:54:53,248 --> 01:54:56,477
We've got you on kidnapping,
attempted murder...

1476
01:54:56,544 --> 01:54:59,413
and trespassing on government property.

1477
01:55:07,425 --> 01:55:10,142
Yeah. You got it, chief.
Thank you. Bye.

1478
01:55:11,233 --> 01:55:14,102
They want us in Cairo next week
for the opening of the exhibit.

1479
01:55:14,178 --> 01:55:16,000
They're sending a private jet.

1480
01:55:16,066 --> 01:55:17,276
That's fun.

1481
01:55:17,346 --> 01:55:21,023
Yeah, big whoop. We could have had
a whole fleet of private jets.

1482
01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:24,156
Ten percent, Ben. They offered you
ten percent and you turned it down.

1483
01:55:24,226 --> 01:55:27,542
Riley, we've been over this.
It was too much. I couldn't accept it.

1484
01:55:27,618 --> 01:55:31,611
I still have this splinter that's been festering
for three months from an old piece of wood.

1485
01:55:31,683 --> 01:55:32,697
OK, I'll tell you what.

1486
01:55:32,771 --> 01:55:36,448
Next time we find a treasure
that redefines history for all mankind,

1487
01:55:36,515 --> 01:55:38,424
you make the call on the finder's fee.

1488
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:40,889
That's not as funny.

1489
01:55:40,963 --> 01:55:42,937
What do you care?
You got the girl.

1490
01:55:43,908 --> 01:55:45,533
- It's true.
- It's true.

1491
01:55:48,804 --> 01:55:50,844
Rub it in.
Enjoy your spoils...

1492
01:55:50,916 --> 01:55:53,305
while I sit on one percent.

1493
01:55:54,852 --> 01:55:57,634
One stinkin' percent.
Half of one percent, actually.

1494
01:55:58,116 --> 01:56:00,483
One percent. Unbelievable.

1495
01:56:00,548 --> 01:56:02,457
I'm sorry for your suffering, Riley.

1496
01:56:02,533 --> 01:56:06,723
For the record, Ben,
I like the house.

1497
01:56:06,789 --> 01:56:10,084
You know, I chose this estate
because in 1812 Charles Carroll met...

1498
01:56:10,149 --> 01:56:14,786
Yeah, someone that did something
in history and had fun. Great. Wonderful.

1499
01:56:14,853 --> 01:56:16,511
Could have had a bigger house.

Where does it lead to?

1504
01:56:33,831 --> 01:56:36,645
You'll figure it out.
