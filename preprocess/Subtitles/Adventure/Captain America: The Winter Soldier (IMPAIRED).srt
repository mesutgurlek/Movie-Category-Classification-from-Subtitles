Agent Romanoff had a different

Which you didn't feel
obliged to share.

I'm not obliged to do anything.

198

Those hostages could
have died, Nick.

199
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,999
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

200

Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

Not a bunch of guys running
around shooting guns.

202

Last time I trusted
someone, I lost an eye.

203

Look, I didn't want you doing anything
you weren't comfortable with.

It's called compartmentalisation.

Got good tips.

223

He'd walk home every night, a roll
of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

224
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,079
He'd say, "Hi."

People would say, "Hi" back.

Time went on, the

He'd say, "Hi."

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,959
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

229
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,442
Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

230
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,359

234
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,601
He'd show them.

235

Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

236

Yeah, I know.

239
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,761

He had a few suggestions

248
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,201
once he got an up-close
look at our old turbines.

249

These new long-range precision guns

hostiles a minute.

The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

257
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,127
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

258
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,207
For once, we're way
ahead of the curve.

259
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,884
By holding a gun to everyone on
Earth and calling it protection.

260
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,528

263
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,525
Yeah, we compromised.

264
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,883
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

265
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,439
But we did it so that
people could be free.

266

This isn't freedom. This is fear.

PIERCE: That photo was taken
five years after Nick and I met,

582
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,839
when I was at State
Department in Bogota.

583
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,519
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

584
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,164
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

585
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,599
Nick was Deputy Chief of the
S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

586
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,119
and he comes to me with a plan.

587
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,159
He wants to storm the
building through the sewers.

588
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,325
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

589
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,719
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

590
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,039
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

591
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,851
They find it empty.

592
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,759
Nick had ignored my direct order,

593
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,482
and carried out an unauthorised
military operation on foreign soil,

594
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,199
and saved the lives of a
dozen political officers,

595
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,479
including my daughter.

596

So you gave him a promotion.

597

I've never had any
cause to regret it.

598
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,522
Captain, why was Nick in
your apartment last night?

599
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,681
I don't know.

600
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,251
Did you know it was bugged?

601
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,481
I did, because Nick told me.

602
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,440
Did he tell you he was
the one who bugged it?

603
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,406
I want you to see something.

604
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,519
<i>INTERROGATOR:

605
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,839
Is that live?

606
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,608
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

607
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,879
ROGERS:
Are you saying he's a suspect?

608
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,919
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

609
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,679
PIERCE: No, no. It's more
complicated than that.

610
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,479
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the <i>Lemurian Star</i>.

611
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,362
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

612
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,971
and then the money was run
through 17 fictitious accounts.

613
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,199
The last one going
to a holding company

614
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,599
that was registered
to a Jacob Veech.

615
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,119
Am I supposed to know who that is?

616
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,519
Not likely. Veech
died six years ago.

617
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,651
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

618
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,688
When I first met Nick, his
mother lived at 1437.

619
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,648
Are you saying Fury
hired the pirates? Why?

620
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,844
The prevailing theory

621
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,519
was that the hijacking was a
cover for the acquisition

622
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,287
and sale of classified
intelligence.

623
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,930
The sale went sour and
that led to Nick's death.

624
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,845
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

625
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,162
Why do you think we're talking?

626
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,159
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

627
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,326
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

628
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,124
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

629
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,327
to build a really better world

630
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,203
sometimes means having to
tear the old one down.

631
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,885
And that makes enemies.

632
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,839
Those people that call you
dirty because you got the guts

633
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,005
to stick your hands in the mud and
try to build something better.

634
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,085
And the idea that those
people could be happy today

635
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,006
makes me really, really angry.

636
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,959
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

637
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,362
I don't think that's an accident.

638
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,524
And I don't think you do, either.

639
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,559
So, I'm gonna ask again.

640
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,769
Why was he there?

641
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,001
He told me not to trust anyone.

642
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,447
PIERCE:

966
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,559

978
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,522
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.

979
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,284
But I guess I just traded
in the KGB for HYDRA.

01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,727
It's okay.

986
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,487

And I'm always honest.

992
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,159

out they died for nothing.

If you guys eat that sort of thing.

997
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,039
So, the question is,

998
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,442
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?

Who happens to be sitting on top of the
most secure building in the world.

1001
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,559
But he's not working alone.

1002
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,281
Zola's algorithm was
on the <i>Lemurian Star</i>.

1003
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,930
So was Jasper Sitwell.

1004
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,719
So, the real question is, how
do the two most wanted people

1005
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,044
in Washington kidnap a S.H.I.E.L.D.
officer in broad daylight?

1006
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,769
The answer is, you don't.

- What's this?
- Call it a résumé.

You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.

ROMANOFF: I heard they couldn't bring
in the choppers because of the RPGs.

1013
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,879
What did you use? A stealth chute?

1014
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,327
No.

1015
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,485
These.

1016
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,599
I thought you said
you were a pilot.

1017
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,331
I never said pilot.

1018

I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

reason to get back in.

Where can we get our hands
on one of these things?

1023

The last one is at Fort Meade.

02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,602
<i>and yes, we help make it that way.</i>

1593
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:47,925
<i>But we're also the ones best
qualified to defend it.</i>

1594
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:51,528
So, if you want to
arrest me, arrest me.

1595
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:54,244
You'll know where to find me.

1596
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:32,564
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

1597
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:34,605
You get used to it.

1598
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:39,319
We've been data
mining HYDRA'S files.

1599
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:41,848
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1600
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,765
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1601
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:46,960
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1602
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,770
There's something I
got to do first.

1603
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:53,206
How about you, Wilson? Could
use a man with your abilities.

1604
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:55,964
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1605
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:58,844
All right, then.

1606
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:07,690
Anybody asks for me, tell them
they can find me, right here.

1607
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:10,879
You should be honoured. That's
about as close as he gets

1608
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,930
to saying thank you.

1609
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:15,161
Not going with him?

1610
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:16,719
No.

1611
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:19,122
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

1612
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:21,919
I blew all my covers. I got
to go figure out a new one.

1613
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:23,321
That might take a while.

1614
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:25,444
I'm counting on it.

1615
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:28,759
That thing you asked for,

1616
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:31,481
I called in a few
favours from Kiev.

1617
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:37,171
Will you do me a favour?
Call that nurse.

1618
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:38,599
She's not a nurse.

1619
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:40,843
And you're not a
S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1620
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:43,842
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

1621
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:45,601
She's nice.

1622
02:05:57,680 --> 02:05:59,844
Be careful, Steve.

1623
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:02,409
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1624
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:15,719
You're going after him.

1625
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:17,159
You don't have to come with me.

1626
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:18,641
I know.

1627
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,761
When do we start?

1628
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:24,801
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

1629
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:26,851
Everything he knows about.

1630
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,079
<i>Herr</i> Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,

1631
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:31,079
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

1632
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:33,209
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1633
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:37,044
Two sides of a coin that's
no longer currency.

1634
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,370
What we have

1635
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,051
is worth more than any
of them ever knew.

1636
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:53,366
We've only scratched the
surface and already,

1637
02:08:55,760 --> 02:09:00,006
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA'S good work around the world.

1638
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:04,399
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colourful friends,

1639
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,439
and keep them off our scent.

1640
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:08,919
What about the volunteers?

1641
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:10,679
The dead will be buried so deep

1642
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:13,208
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1643
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,520
And the survivors?

1644
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:20,165
The twins.

1645
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:26,849
Sooner or later,
they will meet the twins.

1646
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:30,759
It's not a world of spies any more.

1647
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:33,128
Not even a world of heroes.

1648
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:36,851
This is the age of
miracles, Doctor.

1649
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:41,007
There's nothing more horrifying

1650
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:42,966
than a miracle.
