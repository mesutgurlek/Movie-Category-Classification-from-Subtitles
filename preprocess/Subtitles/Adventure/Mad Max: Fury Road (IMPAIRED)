845
01:22:25,908 --> 01:22:29,944
They used to bounce messages
across the earth.

846

Shows.

847
01:22:31,247 --> 01:22:34,148
Everyone in the old world
had a show.

848

Do you think there's still
somebody out there?

849
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,522
Sending shows?

850
01:22:41,524 --> 01:22:43,157

out here.

It could be a girl.

858

You kill people with that,
do ya?

859
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:07,147
Killed everyone I ever met
out here.

860

I plant one
every chance I get.

Where?

870
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:40,681
So far, nothing's took.
Earth's too sour.

871
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:42,983
Ah, so many
different kinds.

872
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:45,319

873

Back then,
everyone had their fill.

874

Back then, there was no need
to snap anybody.

Can I talk to you?

876
01:24:27,797 --> 01:24:29,797
I've talked with the others.

a better chance

879
01:24:41,077 --> 01:24:43,077
If we leave the rig here

880
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:46,380
and load the motorcycles up
with as much as we can,

881
01:24:46,382 --> 01:24:49,917
we can maybe ride
for 160 days.

He wants to go back
from where they came.

904
01:26:58,547 --> 01:26:59,880
The citadel.

905
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:02,049
And what's there to find
at the citadel?

906
01:27:02,051 --> 01:27:03,250
Green.

907
01:27:03,252 --> 01:27:05,619
Toast: And water.

908
01:27:05,621 --> 01:27:08,855
There's a ridiculous amount
of clear water.

909

And a lot of crops.

as long as you're not afraid of heights.

Where does the water
come from?

912
01:27:14,863 --> 01:27:16,597
He pumps it up
from deep in the earth.

913
01:27:16,599 --> 01:27:18,732
Calls it aqua cola
and claims it all for himself.

914
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:21,268
And because he owns it,
he owns all of us.

915

I don't like him already.

916

It'll take two weeks
to skirt the wall of mountains.

Max: No.

918
01:27:26,442 --> 01:27:30,544
I suggest we go back
the same way we came.

It's open.
We know that. Right?

921
01:27:35,084 --> 01:27:37,417
He brought
all his war parties through.

922
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,453
So we take the war rig
and we charge it

923
01:27:39,455 --> 01:27:41,488
right through the middle
of them.

924
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:44,324
We can decouple the tanker
at the pass.

it'll be easy.
