On the horizon?

1644
03:16:25,607 --> 03:16:30,360
Why do the white gulls

1645
03:16:30,528 --> 03:16:35,991
Call?

1646
03:16:36,159 --> 03:16:41,205
Across the sea

1647
03:16:41,372 --> 03:16:46,376
A pale moon rises

1648
03:16:46,544 --> 03:16:49,338
The ships have come

1649
03:16:49,547 --> 03:16:56,887
To carry you home

1650
03:16:57,055 --> 03:17:01,934
And all will turn

1651
03:17:02,101 --> 03:17:07,606
To silver glass

1652
03:17:07,774 --> 03:17:11,902
A light on the water

1653
03:17:12,070 --> 03:17:15,864
Grey ships pass

1654
03:17:16,074 --> 03:17:21,787
Into the West
