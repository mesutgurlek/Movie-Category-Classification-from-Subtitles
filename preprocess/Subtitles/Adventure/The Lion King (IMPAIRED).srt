I was just trying to be brave,
like you.

I'm only brave
when I have to be.

Simba, being brave...

493
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,366
doesn't mean
you go looking for trouble.

494

But you're not scared
of anything.

I was today.

- You were?
- Yes.

497
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,209
I thought I might lose you.

498
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,296
Oh. I guess even
kings get scared, huh?

Mm-hmm.

- But you know what?
- What?

501
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,511
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

The great kings
of the past...

look down on us
from those stars.

- Really?
- Yes.

So, whenever
you feel alone...

just remember
that those kings...

522

to guide you...

ELTON JOHN:
* There's a calm surrender *

1631
01:24:58,307 --> 01:25:02,519
* To the rush of day *

1632
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:06,398
* When the heat
of a rolling wind *

1633
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:10,527
* Can be turned away *

1634
01:25:10,569 --> 01:25:14,239
* An enchanted moment *

1635
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:18,410
* And it sees me through *

1636
01:25:18,452 --> 01:25:22,414
* It's enough
for this restless warrior *

1637
01:25:22,456 --> 01:25:26,084
* Just to be with you *

1638
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:29,296
* And can you feel *

1639
01:25:29,338 --> 01:25:33,008
* The love tonight? *

1640
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:34,968
* Tonight *

1641
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:38,972
* It is where we are *

1642
01:25:42,392 --> 01:25:44,353
* It's enough *

1643
01:25:44,394 --> 01:25:49,024
* For this wide-eyed
wanderer *

1644
01:25:49,066 --> 01:25:53,862
* That we got this far *

1645
01:25:56,323 --> 01:25:59,117
* And can you feel *

1646
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:02,830
* The love tonight *

1647
01:26:02,871 --> 01:26:04,957
* Tonight *

1648
01:26:04,998 --> 01:26:09,336
* How it's laid to rest? *

1649
01:26:12,673 --> 01:26:14,800
* It's enough *

1650
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:19,138
* To make kings
and vagabonds *

1651
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:24,184
* Believe the very best *

1652
01:26:42,077 --> 01:26:46,123
* There's a time
for everyone *

1653
01:26:46,165 --> 01:26:50,002
* If they only learn *

1654
01:26:50,043 --> 01:26:54,006
* That the twisting
kaleidoscope *

1655
01:26:54,047 --> 01:26:58,093
* Moves us all in turn *

1656
01:26:58,135 --> 01:27:01,805
* There's a rhyme and reason *

1657
01:27:01,847 --> 01:27:06,059
* To the wild outdoors *

1658
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:10,022
* When the heart
of this star-crossed voyager *

1659
01:27:10,063 --> 01:27:15,736
* Beats in time with yours *

1660
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:19,114
* And can you feel *

1661
01:27:19,156 --> 01:27:22,534
* The love tonight? *

1662
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:24,578
* Tonight *

1663
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:28,582
* It is where we are *

1664
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:34,129
* It's enough *

1665
01:27:34,171 --> 01:27:38,634
* For this wide-eyed wanderer *

1666
01:27:38,675 --> 01:27:43,639
* That we got this far *

1667
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:48,936
* And can you feel *

1668
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:52,898
* The love tonight *

1669
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,566
* Tonight *

1670
01:27:54,608 --> 01:27:59,196
* How it's laid to rest? *

1671
01:28:01,824 --> 01:28:03,909
* It's enough *

1672
01:28:03,951 --> 01:28:08,539
* To make kings and vagabonds *

1673
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:13,752
* Believe the very best *

1674
01:28:16,964 --> 01:28:18,924
* It's enough *

1675
01:28:18,966 --> 01:28:23,137
* To make kings and vagabonds *

1676
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:30,269
* Believe the very best *

1677
