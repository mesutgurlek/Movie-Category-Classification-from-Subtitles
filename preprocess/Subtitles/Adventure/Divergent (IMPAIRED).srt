Of course.

He steps before he punches.

678
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:22,505
All right?

00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:23,572

CHRISTINA: Let's sit you down.

724
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:20,776
The game's simple.
It's like Capture the Flag.

Only lasts a couple minutes.

731
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:45,901
Two teams.
Four and I are captains.

732
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,736
You pick first.

733
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,972
Okay. Edward.

734
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:53,942
I'll take the stiff.

735
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:55,778
Oh. Picking the weak ones

736
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,860
so you've got someone
to blame when you lose.

737
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,149
Something like that.

738
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,560
CHRISTINA: Where did Eric's team go?

739
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:13,482

gone to the end.

Okay. What's your strategy?

743
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:25,441
We can hide the flag well
enough so they can't find it.

744
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:27,109
Let's send out a team to scout their
location. See if we can find their flag.

745
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,744
I say we blitz them. Just
beat them with sheer force.

746
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:29,945
AL: Yeah, that's the best
way to lose quickly.

747
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,447

come to us.

748

they won't expect it.

WILL: We don't know
where they are.

750
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:35,584
Okay, we split into two
groups, defense and offense.

751
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:36,952
EZRA: Who put you in charge?

752
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,220
CHRISTINA: Someone has to
make a decision.

753
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:39,688
EZRA: We need to be
more aggressive.

754
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:40,689

to be smart about it.

1639
02:10:50,209 --> 02:10:52,129
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

1640
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:00,518
I know exactly who you are.

1641
02:11:02,221 --> 02:11:03,554
You sure about that?

1642
02:11:05,424 --> 02:11:07,391
Yeah, I'm very sure.

1643
02:11:11,063 --> 02:11:12,230
Come here.

1644
02:11:25,577 --> 02:11:28,079
TRIS: <i>We're like
the Factionless now.</i>

1645
02:11:28,081 --> 02:11:31,048
<i>We've left everything behind,</i>

1646
02:11:31,050 --> 02:11:33,618
<i>but we found
ourselves and each other.</i>

1647
02:11:35,988 --> 02:11:39,523
<i>Tomorrow we may
have to fight again,</i>

1648
02:11:39,525 --> 02:11:42,927
<i>but, for now, we'll ride the
train to the end of the line...</i>

1649
02:11:42,929 --> 02:11:44,428
<i>And then</i>

1650
02:11:44,430 --> 02:11:45,463
<i>we'll jump.</i>
