where Miss Teller's Uncle Rudi

Your corrupt and criminal background...

233
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,404
until you were caught and the CIA
blackmailed you into working for them.

234
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,049
But what interests me,
given your profile...

235
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,882
is what would motivate you to become
the CIA's most effective agent.

to counteract the humiliation
of knowing your balls...

being a big pal of Stalin's...

I do wonder if it was your father's shame
that gave you such drive, though.

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,811
Or...

255
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,284
was it your mother's reputation?

256
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,243
I understand that she was...

257
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,210
extremely popular
amongst your father's friends...

258
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,966

He's an architect designing a resort for
heroes of the Soviet Union by the Black Sea.

281
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,803
The Russian Minister of Culture has
a weakness for classical architecture...

282
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,440
and he's sending your man there
to Rome to study.

283
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,127
He's also managed to secure a visa
for his fiancée.

284
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,006
And, naturally, you'd introduce him
to your beloved Uncle Rudi.

She's from behind the Iron Curtain.

297

she want to bring it with her.

Uh, no.

301
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,689
No, not the Dior, the Rabanne.

302
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,208
You can't put a Paco Rabanne belt
on a Patou.

303
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,408
- She's not going to wear a Patou.
- What's wrong with a Patou?

304
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,403
Nothing. If you're fat.

305
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,130
The Dior goes with the Rabanne.

306
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,801
It won't match.

307
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,243
It doesn't have to match.

GABY:
Have you seen the price of this handbag?

309
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,608
It costs more than my car.

310
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,043
You can get back

Not bad.

I like this. Yes.

314
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,321
But it's missing...

315
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,331
a little something.

So, Mr. Architect...

I'm sure you've done your homework.

Why don't you tell me a bit
about the Steps.

Good question.

The Steps were constructed in 1723...

credited to two Italian architects.

00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,730
Now, Sergei also had mother, Yagoda...

who introduced him
to classical architecture...

340
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,291
and whom he revered as his muse.

341
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,764
Unfortunately for Sergei, his mother died
in the middle of construction.

342
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,201
So in memory of his beloved Yagoda...

to celebrate every year...

Once upon a time,
there was a little boy.

930
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,171
You wouldn't describe him...

931

as a particularly special little boy.

In fact, he appeared
to be exceedingly dull.

Because of this boy's
apparent shortcomings...

he was bullied mercilessly...

and relentlessly by the other children.

as life continued to be a living hell.

939
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,691
But what the other boys didn't
understand about their victim was...

940
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,491
that he didn't see them as enemies.

941
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,681
He saw them as instruments of learning.

942
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,045
A priceless lesson was gleaned
from his tormentors.

to seize the island, secure the warhead...

when Professor Teller disappeared...

we assumed his Nazi colleagues would
come knocking at his daughter's door...

You were about to be exposed, Kuryakin.

1082

The only way she could stay in the game.

1083
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,369
She knew the ring
you gave her was bugged...

1084
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,443
and you'd be listening
to every word she said.

1085
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,931
If you can catch him.

1086
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,242
WAVERLY:
Give the average agent time to escape...

1087
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,566

are you, Kuryakin? You're special.

SOLO:
Let me translate this into English.

1089
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,968
You told Gaby to drop us in it,
so you could find her father first.

1090
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:52,125

to help find her and finish the job.

It's an aircraft carrier, Kuryakin.

01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:19,729
For a special agent, you're not having
a very special day, are you?

1100
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,289
TELLER: Reflector lens.

1101
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,001
So, what does that do?

1102
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,845
Well, it's known as a coupler.

1103
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,968
It sends a signal
which enables another missile...

01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,600
to lock onto this one
for double the impact.

1105
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,451
It's left over from when this was a warhead
that contained conventional explosives.

1106
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,321
Now that we are converting it
to nuclear, it's redundant.

We're nearly done, Victoria.

- Let's stop playing games, shall we?

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1293
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:33,451
Come in. Just finishing up.

1294
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:38,129
Fix us a couple of drinks.
I think we've earned them.

1295
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:42,164
I guess it's business as usual now.

1296
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,761
Back to how things were.

1297
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,650
Politics being what they are.

1298
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,605
You feeling okay?

1299
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:29,120
So, what now?

1300
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,049
Mission accomplished?

1301
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:36,446
Head back to Russia?

1302
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,450
Something like this.

1303
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:41,687
Yes.

1304
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:43,961
You?

1305
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:45,881
New York.

1306
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,726
Almost forgot.

1307
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:54,401
Got something for you.

1308
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,686
You know what my mission is?

1309
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,530
Same as mine was.

1310
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,249
Kill me if necessary...

1311
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:20,090
to get that.

1312

(SOLO SIGHS)

1313
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,767
Absolutely hated working
with you, Peril.

1314
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,607
You're a terrible spy, Cowboy.

(GLASSES CLINK)

1316
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:44,926
Good evening, gentlemen.

1317
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,727
Rather touching scene.

1318
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:51,360
Nice view, glass of whiskey...

1319
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,205
and a little bonfire to keep you warm.

1320
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:57,086
Rather good idea.

1321
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,364
So I have news.

1322
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:02,406
A fresh little unpleasantness
has arisen.

1323
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,884
I've spoken to your superiors,
and now that we're all such good friends...

1324
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,805
they've kindly agreed to let me keep
the team together for a while.

1325
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:11,971
- We leave in an hour.
- Where we going?

1326
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:14,487
Istanbul, Kuryakin.

1327
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:16,642
You'll need your curly-wurly shoes.

1328
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:20,123
- Oh, and you have a new code name.
- Code name?

1329
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,084
Yes, rather a good one:

1330
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:23,281
