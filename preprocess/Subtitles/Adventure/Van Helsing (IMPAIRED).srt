1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,994
Thousands.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,873
Thousands more.

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,909
VAN HELSING: No.
ANNA: You heard what he said.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,037
My life, my job is to vanquish evil.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,633
I can sense evil.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,950
VAN HELSING: This thing, man,
whatever it is...

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,429
evil may have created it,
may have left its mark on it.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,432
But evil does not rule it,
so I cannot kill it.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,876
- I can.
- Not while I'm here.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,669
Anna.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,789
Your family has spent 400 years
trying to kill Dracula.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,838
Maybe this poor creature
can help us find a way.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,154
Oh, my God. He's seen us.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,279
Now they'll come for him.

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,191
Neither you nor I
will be able to stop them.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,397
If I can get him to Rome,
we can protect him there.

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,959
And then the painting came alive...

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,758
and the two creatures
attacked each other.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,637
- What does it mean?
- I don't know.

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,393
Listen, Carl, whatever you do,
don't stare at him.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,758
I'm staring at him.

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,559
Is that a man?

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,710
VAN HELSING: Actually, seven men.
Parts, anyway.

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,314
By exposing me,
you have condemned me!

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,158
Me and all of humanity!

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,629
Nothing is faster
than Transylvanian horses.

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,392
Not even a werewolf.

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,949
Anything else, you're on your own.

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,194
- Let me go.
- Where are you going to go?

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,077
I don't know
if you've seen a mirror lately...

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,673
but you kind of stick out
in a crowd.

32
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,872
We must not let the creature
be destroyed!

33
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,914
Save him! Save the monster!

34
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,075
VERONA: Stakes!

35
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,718
No!

36
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,634
CARL: Oh, my God.

37
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,992
<i>What are you doing out here?</i>

38
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,308
<i>Right.</i>

39
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,198
<i>Don't let go!</i>

40
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,273
I can help!

41
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,713
You won't kill me?

42
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,677
Only if you don't hurry!

43
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,069
Jump!

44
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,549
Velkan.

45
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,035
Velkan.

46
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,069
Anna...

47
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,759
forgive me.

48
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,678
I will see you again.

49
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,072
ANNA: You killed him.

50
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,434
Now you know
why they call me murderer.

51
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,554
Oh, my God.

52
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,992
You've been bitten.

53
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,869
Anna!

54
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,749
Anna.

55
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,679
So much trouble to my master.
So much trouble.

56
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,155
What do you want?

57
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,556
ALEERA: The master commands a trade.

58
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,479
The monster for the Princess.

59
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,229
Somewhere public. Lots of people.

60
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,750
A place where your master
will be less inclined...

61
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,796
to expose his other side.

62
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,959
Tomorrow night is All Hallows' Eve.

63
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,196
Here in Budapest there is
a wonderful masquerade ball.

64
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,512
- Are you all right?
- No.

65
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,199
He has been bitten.

66
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,998
FRANKENSTEIN: Bitten by a werewolf.

67
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,029
Now you will become that which
you have hunted so passionately.

68
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,799
I am sorry.

69
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,076
May others be as passionate
in their hunting of you.

70
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,276
VAN HELSING: Well,
they won't find him in here.

71
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,118
I'm sure this is some sort of sin.

72
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,760
VAN HELSING: God will forgive us.
We need to save Anna.

73
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,319
You don't think
the hat's a bit much?

74
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,038
VAN HELSING: Carl, help me!
CARL: Right.

75
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,759
CARL: How many commandments
can we break in one day?

76
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,717
CARL: Anyway, according to the book...

77
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,156
you won't turn into a werewolf until
the rising of your first full moon.

78
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,559
CARL: That's two nights from now.

79
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,518
CARL: You'll still be able
to fight Dracula's hold over you...

80
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,999
until the final stroke of midnight.

81
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,752
VAN HELSING: So I have nothing
to worry about.

82
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,193
CARL: My God, you should be terrified.

83
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,508
VAN HELSING: Thanks.
CARL: Sorry.

84
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,955
CARL: We still have 48 hours
to find a solution.

85
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,153
You sure he can't get out of there?

86
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,549
VAN HELSING: Not without
some help from the dead.

87
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,353
How does it feel
to be a puppet on my string?

88
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,795
I won't let you trade me, Count.

89
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,635
I have no intention of trading you.

90
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,718
DRACULA: And if I know Van Helsing,
which I do...

91
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,268
he is not planning on
making a trade, either.

92
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,479
Neither of us
has ever settled for half.

93
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,153
There they are.

94
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,111
You make my skin crawl.

95
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,751
This is not all I could do
with your skin.

96
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,516
Carl, I need you to do something.

97
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,431
I'm not gonna like this, am I?

98
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,955
DRACULA: Don't we make a lovely couple?

99
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,753
Oh, my God.

100
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,990
DRACULA: I am looking
for a new bride, Anna.

101
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,115
Someone strong and beautiful.

102
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,390
One brief moment of pain...

103
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,076
and we can be together forever.

104
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,876
You have no heartbeat.

105
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,513
DRACULA: Perhaps it just needs...

106
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,072
to be rekindled.

107
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,833
Anna. Anna!

108
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,194
VAN HELSING: Wake up.

109
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,148
DRACULA: Gabriel.

110
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,397
Oh, Gabriel.

111
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,555
Welcome to my summer palace.

112
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,753
Master! Look, master!

113
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,436
We have him, master.

114
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,879
We have him!

115
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,875
You wretched undead...

116
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,235
I shall have my revenge!

117
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,956
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

118
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,793
"I shall fear no evil."

119
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,792
<i>You are nothing but damned bones...</i>

120
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,111
<i>and damned souls...</i>

121
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,352
<i>and will burn in the flames of Hell!</i>

122
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,155
Now that everything
is as it should be...

123
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,349
ladies and gentlemen,
I give to you...

124
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,991
Van Helsing!

125
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,114
Come on.

126
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,957
Yes!

127
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,319
Now I know what it's for.

128
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,349
- Where are we going?
- Through that window!

129
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,391
Carl, you're a genius!

130
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,674
A genius with access
to unstable chemicals.

131
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,195
Say goodbye to your friends.

132
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,158
I'll find you!
I'll get you back and set you free!

133
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,719
I swear to God!

134
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,270
- I must save him.
- No, you can't.

135
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,395
Why?

136
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,954
I cabled Rome earlier
to apprise them of our situation.

137
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,075
What did they say?

138
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,559
CARL: Even if you kill Dracula...

139
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,473
Rome orders you to destroy
Frankenstein as well.

140
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,595
He isn't evil.

141
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,272
But they say he isn't human, either.

142
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,193
Do they know him? Have they spoken
to him? Who are they to judge?

143
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,352
They want you to destroy him so he
can never be used to harm humanity.

144
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,635
What of me? Did you tell them
what I'm to become?

145
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,438
VAN HELSING: Did they tell you
how to kill me?

146
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,034
The correct angle of the stake
as it enters my heart?

147
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,554
The exact measure of silver
in each bullet?

148
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,390
ANNA: Stop!
CARL: No, I left you out!

149
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,514
I'm sorry.

150
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,679
It's starting.

151
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,230
They must have taken
all the equipment to Dracula's lair.

152
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,158
Wherever that is.

153
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,439
Look, there's still time.

154
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,318
Dracula can't bring his children
to life until the sun sets.

155
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,515
The sun sets in two hours.

156
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,989
We've been looking for him
for more than 400 years!

157
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,595
Yes, well, I wasn't around
for those 400 years, now, was I?

158
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,036
VAN HELSING: Okay, Carl,
what have you learned?

159
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,157
That Count Dracula was actually
the son of Valerious the Elder.

160
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,559
The son of your ancestor.

161
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,471
Everybody knows that. What else?

162
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,871
All right.
Well, according to this rubbing...

163
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,871
it all started
when Dracula was murdered.

164
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,518
VAN HELSING: Do you know
who murdered him?

165
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,558
CARL: No, there's just some vague reference
to the Left Hand of God.

166
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,950
And in 1462, when Dracula died...

167
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,157
- he made a covenant with the Devil.
- And was given a new life.

168
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,152
But the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood.

169
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,310
Excuse me. Are you going to
let me tell the story?

170
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,389
BOTH: Sorry.

171
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,358
And your ancestor,
having sired this evil creature...

172
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,513
went to Rome to seek forgiveness.
That's when the bargain was made.

173
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,794
He was to kill Dracula...

174
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,236
in return for eternal salvation
of his entire family...

175
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,596
right down the line
all the way to you.

176
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,272
ANNA: But he couldn't do it.

177
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,238
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor
couldn't kill his own son.

178
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,392
So he banished him
to an icy fortress...

179
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,119
sending him through a door
from which there was no return.

180
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,997
- And then the Devil gave him wings.
- Yes.

181
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,117
- All right, so where is this door?
- I don't know.

182
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,437
But when your ancestor couldn't
kill his son, he left clues.

183
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,600
So that future generations
might do it for him.

184
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,910
That must be what my father
was looking for in here.

185
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,956
Clues to the door's location.

186
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,388
The door.

187
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,989
Of course.

188
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,353
<i>You said your father spent hours...</i>

189
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,556
staring at this painting,
trying to find the lair.

190
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,392
I think you were right.
Quite literally.

191
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,517
I think this is the door.
He just didn't know how to open it.

192
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,318
Look. A Latin inscription.

193
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,516
CARL: Maybe it works
like the painting in the tower.

194
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,229
If this were a door, my father
would have opened it long ago.

195
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,996
I can't finish the inscription.
There's a piece missing.

196
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,114
- Your father didn't have this.
- Where did you get that?

197
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,758
VAN HELSING: Carl, finish it.

198
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,513
In the name of God, open this door.

199
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,468
A mirror.

200
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,388
Dracula has no reflection
in the mirror.

201
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,674
But why?

202
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,033
Maybe, to Dracula
it's not a mirror at all.

203
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,475
It's cold. And it's snowing.

204
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,476
VAN HELSING: See you on the other side.

205
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,839
Be careful.

206
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,479
Castle Dracula.

207
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,635
CARL: Do we have a plan?

208
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,995
CARL: Doesn't have to be
Wellington's at Waterloo...

209
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,308
but some sort of plan would be nice.

210
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,958
VAN HELSING: We're going to stop Dracula.

211
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,399
ANNA: And kill anything
in our way.

212
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,471
CARL: Well, you let me know how that goes.

213
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,550
Well, as grateful as I am
to be out of the cold...

214
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,710
that doesn't seem like a good thing.

215
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,751
We'd better get moving.

216
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,437
CARL: So are all of those...
ANNA: Yes.

217
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,590
- And inside them are...
- Yes.

218
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,478
Igor do this! Lgor do that!

219
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,314
How did you find...
It's impossible!

220
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,390
- Please don't kill me!
- Why not?

221
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,038
Well, I...

222
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,476
My master has awakened.

223
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,955
- There is a cure.
- What?

224
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,239
Dracula. He has a cure to remove
the curse of the werewolf!

225
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,558
Go, find the cure! Save yourself!

226
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,237
ANNA: Come on. You heard him.
Let's find it.

227
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,072
Wait. Why does Dracula have a cure?

228
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,310
- I don't care!
- I do.

229
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,235
Why does he need one? Why?

230
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,668
Because the only thing
that can kill him is a werewolf.

231
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,279
The painting. That's what it meant.

232
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,397
ANNA: Dracula's been using werewolves
to do his bidding for centuries.

233
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,597
Yes, but if one ever had the will
to turn on him, he'd need a cure...

234
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,717
to remove the curse and
make him human before it bit him.

235
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,273
You're going to take these two...

236
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,794
- and lead them to the antidote.
- No, I'm not.

237
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,199
Yes, I am.

238
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,280
Here's the plan. When the bell
begins to toll midnight...

239
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,588
you'll be able to kill Dracula.

240
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,033
We just need to find the cure...

241
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,917
and get it into you
before the final stroke.

242
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,638
Are you insane?
What kind of plan is that?

243
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,393
If they even suspect you
of misleading them...

244
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,913
clip off one of his fingers.

245
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,116
- I'll clip off something.
- The tower over there...

246
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,475
- that's where it is.
- And what about the other tower?

247
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,913
- Give me that!
- That is where...

248
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,197
we reassembled the laboratory.
Would I lie to you?

249
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,958
Not if you wanted to live.

250
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,589
Now, if I'm not cured by
the twelfth stroke of midnight...

251
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,269
- I don't think I could.
- You must.

252
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,194
Come on.

253
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,548
I don't like this plan.

254
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,154
We don't have a choice.
Just don't get killed.

255
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,913
You still don't understand.

256
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,116
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

257
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,071
We must save my family.

258
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,313
If you're late, run like hell.

259
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,879
Don't be late.

260
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,314
Now go. Go.

261
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,554
FRANKENSTEIN: Get off me,
you vermin from hell!

262
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,430
What are you complaining about?
This is why you were made!

263
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,513
To prove that God is not
the only one who can create life!

264
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,079
And now you must give that life
to my children.

265
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,755
Up!

266
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,638
There it is.

267
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,238
I'll go first.

268
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,829
Carl!

269
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,356
Stay as long as you like.

270
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,113
You try to get lgor. Igor get you!

271
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,678
- Go ahead. Grab it.
- You go ahead and grab it.

272
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,473
If there's one thing I've learned...

273
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,791
it's never to be the first to stick
your hand in a viscous material.

274
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,312
- Did I scare you?
- No.

275
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,750
Then maybe I need
to try a little harder.

276
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,348
Viscous material!
What did I tell you?

277
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,078
Get it!

278
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,670
Hot.

279
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,749
- Come on!
- Yes.

280
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,196
We've got to get the antidote
to Van Helsing! Go!

281
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,912
You can't go until I say you can go!

282
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,513
Keep running, Carl!

283
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,399
And I'll say you can go
when you're dead!

284
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,553
CARL: Oh, my God!

285
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,915
What are you doing?
You must find the cure!

286
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,639
- My friends are doing it for me.
- Friends.

287
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,358
Yes. You want one?

288
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,954
I can't unscrew the bolts.
This is gonna hurt.

289
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,837
I am accustomed to pain.

290
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,638
It lets you know you're alive.

291
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,950
Give me life!

292
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,235
One more bolt
and my young will live.

293
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,316
VAN HELSING: You're almost out, my friend!

294
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,873
Help me!

295
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,436
But you're supposed to die.

296
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,230
I want to live.

297
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,359
All right!

298
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,596
Be happy in the knowledge...

299
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,468
that I shall weep
over your dead body.

300
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,596
Hang on!

301
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,630
I'll swing you loose!

302
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,111
You are too late, my friend.

303
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,277
My children live.

304
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,111
Then the only way to kill them
is to kill you.

305
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,674
Correct.

306
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,474
So be it.

307
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,595
One.

308
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,755
No, this cannot be.

309
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,512
We are both part of
the same grand game, Gabriel.

310
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,669
But we need not find ourselves
on opposite sides of the board.

311
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,112
Go! Go and help Van Helsing!

312
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,234
Now!

313
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,839
Thank you.

314
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,672
Oh, my God!
Anna, I need a little help!

315
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,675
Hurry!

316
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,910
ANNA: Throw it to me, Carl!

317
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,469
Yes!

318
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,991
You are being used, Gabriel,
as was I.

319
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,080
But I escaped. So can you.

320
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,792
ALEERA: Anna, my love...

321
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,550
it is your blood
that shall keep me beautiful.

322
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,231
What do you think of that?

323
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,919
I think if you're going to
kill someone, kill them.

324
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,070
Don't stand there talking about it.

325
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,998
Don't you understand?

326
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,834
We could be friends. Partners!

327
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,832
Brothers-in-arms!

328
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,398
Did I mention that it was you
who murdered me?

329
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,509
It must be such a burden.
Such a curse...

330
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,829
to be the Left Hand of God.

331
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,079
All I want is life, Gabriel.

332
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,676
The continuation of my kind.

333
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,109
And perhaps the return of my ring.

334
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,878
Don't be afraid, Gabriel.
Don't be afraid.

335
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,751
I shall give you back your life,
your memory.

336
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,235
Some things
are better left forgotten.

337
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,708
For God!

338
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,799
God forgive me.

339
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,719
She's dead.

340
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,271
CARL: <i>"Eternal rest grant unto her,</i>
<i>Oh, Lord, and let perpetual light...</i>

341
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,669
<i>"shine upon her.</i>
<i>On her soul and the souls of all...</i>

342
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,799
<i>"On her soul and the souls of all...</i>

343
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,311
<i>"the dead faithful have mercy..."</i>
