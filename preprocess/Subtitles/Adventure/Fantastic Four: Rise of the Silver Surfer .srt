00:00:16,546 --> 00:00:18,904
Fantastic Four
and the Silver Surfer

7
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:57,945
Bay of Suruga, Japan

8
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:56,718
Ontém the night FAA...

9
00:01:56,793 --> 00:02:00,283
it was forced to cancel all of the flights
leaving thousands of people arrested.

10
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,070
When you fail electronic and mysterious
apagões appeared at the west of the USA.

11
00:02:05,096 --> 00:02:08,611
But the great history today is
such premature marriage...

12
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:11,771
of the fantastic couple Reed
Richards and Susan Storm...

13
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,378
that he/she will take place on this Saturday.

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,274
REED RICHARDS: Scientist or Celebrity?

15
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,059
Unbelievable.

16
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:22,228
Strange anomalies have
happened in the whole world...

17
00:02:22,264 --> 00:02:24,599
all challenging the laws
known of the physics.

18
00:02:24,638 --> 00:02:28,337
And everything that the press wants to know is
which the porcelain that we chose.

19
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:31,683
And which did you choose?
To blue with the small flowers?

20
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:34,589
- I liked them.
- Do you care?

21
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,413
- Is he/she happening again, it is not?
- Yes, clear.

22
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:41,562
No, we won't postpone
anything, no this time.

23
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,782
That will be the marriage
with that you always dreamed...

24
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:46,372
and I won't leave anything to disturb that.

25
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:50,789
Nor the mysterious transformation
of the matter in a subatomic level.

26
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:55,271
That is the most romantic thing
that you already told me.

27
00:02:55,694 --> 00:02:58,622
And that is very pathetic
when you for for thinking.

28
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,075
Dr. Richards, feel a lot, but
it seems that are filled up.

29
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:04,236
But we have rooms
in the economical class.

30
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:06,683
- Ok, there goes.
- Smile.

31
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:08,279
- Too much!
- Look at Mother!

32
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:12,141
- Great, let me more to remove one.
- Everything well.

33
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,504
That is my place.

34
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:20,210
Excuse.

35
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:34,874
With license.

36
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:48,996
The one that you find of we get
patronage of the aerial companies?

37
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,511
For that got
a private jet.

38
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:52,977
I think we already have
patronages enough.

39
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:56,929
That funny. But speaking serious...

40
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:59,163
Reed you could help myself the
to subsidize their small inventions.

41
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:01,485
- No thank you.
- With license.

42
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:05,167
- Think about that. I see you later.
- Johnny where you go?

43
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:07,767
I don't fly in the economical class.

44
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:26,188
I hope rains.

45
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,495
The snow arrived without warning,
without changes in the temperature...

46
00:04:29,524 --> 00:04:31,985
and it covered the pyramids
with 2 inches of snow.

47
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:35,498
And in Japan, some are suggesting
that the solidification of the bay...

48
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:37,594
it was due to activity
volcanic underwater.

49
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:40,728
Although any similar activity
have been registered in the area.

50
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:43,488
The scientists discarded him/it
global heating as cause...

51
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:45,760
of the extraordinary climatic events
that has been registered...

52
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,061
around of the planet.

53
00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:50,248
With the scientists' inefficiency in
to explain the extraordinary events...

54
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,657
Some begin the if perbuntar
if they would be work of God.

55
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:55,457
Now other you announce...

56
00:04:55,506 --> 00:04:59,470
Reed Richards's marriage and Susan
Storm did with that Manhattan stopped.

57
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,831
The guests include many
members of the elite of New York.

58
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:05,800
Hello dear.

59
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:08,974
The city is trying us
to collect for three patrol cars...

60
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,270
that they say that we destroyed.

61
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:12,151
It was during that
I steal of the armored car.

62
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,481
But I only remember to have
visa two cars be played.

63
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:17,801
Reed.

64
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:22,471
Everything well, I will keep.

65
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:24,218
Were you saying?

66
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,901
I will prove the dress of here the
half hour, later they are the musicians.

67
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,707
Still nor I chose where
to put the flowers...

68
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,894
it is that he/she has so many things for doing.

69
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:37,348
Don't worry, I am sure
that together we will manage to do that.

70
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:39,626
And the one that you were
doing when I entered?

71
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,464
Writing down my list
of the one that I have do.

72
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:42,553
Truth?

73
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,435
- Scout's word.
- Ei, people.

74
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:47,447
The new ones arrived
what do uniforms, find?

75
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:52,940
I think won't use that
in way any, Johnny.

76
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,389
What do you have against the capitalism?

77
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:01,856
- What is that?
- Just my hobby.

78
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,164
It would be a good toy,
or it is something, hum...

79
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:08,257
- scientific?
- A little of both.

80
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:14,827
He/she knows I was always
impressed and opposed with that.

81
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:17,386
It is, Sue said that
I am addicted in that.

82
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:19,103
Why imagine she would say that...

83
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,263
Ei, Johnny.

84
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:23,579
Be quiet but...

85
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:27,540
I analyzed and I correlated
the global disturbances.

86
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,407
They are being caused for
a cosmic radiation...

87
00:06:30,465 --> 00:06:33,820
- as the one that gave us our powers.
- Ours, that is...

88
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,125
very annoying. Then hear...

89
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,268
I have a very important subject of the
marriage that I need to discuss with you.

90
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:43,392
- Yes, clear.
- His/her farewell of single.

91
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,789
No, speaking to serious Johnny.

92
00:06:46,812 --> 00:06:48,164
John...

93
00:06:48,204 --> 00:06:51,312
Several studies show that Johnny
it is only bonitinho when if it is young.

94
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,975
Speaking to serious Johnny,
without farewell of single.

95
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:55,869
It is not my thing type.

96
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:58,054
Then make that for Ben...

97
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:01,088
that means a lot for the grandão,
you will break his heart!

98
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:03,902
He has a heart half
what of stone, is not?

99
00:07:03,938 --> 00:07:05,793
I have him/it a lot that
to do before the marriage,

100
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,596
and sincerely I think the
Sue cannot like that.

101
00:07:08,985 --> 00:07:11,495
He/she knows what I think
would not Sue like?

102
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:14,417
That somebody said her
that you were actually...

103
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:17,491
investigating disturbances
global and cosmic radiation...

104
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:20,157
instead of being
concentrating in the marriage...

105
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:22,996
like you he/she promised.

106
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:35,450
A farewell of single
it can be entertaining.

107
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,805
But without exotic dancers.

108
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,221
- Is that here?
- I don't know anybody here.

109
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:30,769
I would have guest some their friends,
but you don't have none.

110
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,672
Johnny, we made a treatment.

111
00:08:34,738 --> 00:08:37,371
They are not exotic dancers!

112
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:40,008
They are just pleasant!

113
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:47,750
You are Sr. Fantastic
it is not? That too much.

114
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:52,965
You are a lot of bonitinho.

115
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:56,194
I need a picture with the
larger dancer than you have.

116
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:57,611
Without problems.

117
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:16,284
Good night, and be well vindos to Baxter.

118
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:19,126
Can I help you?

119
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:21,709
You cannot use that elevator.

120
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:30,386
Srta. Storm will see you in one moment.

121
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:34,216
Hello?

122
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:36,384
Thank you Roberta.

123
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:41,987
- Can I help you?
- We came to see him/it Dr. Richards.

124
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:43,573
I feel a lot, but him
he/she is not here in the moment...

125
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,003
Ownership to help him/it with some thing?

126
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:48,282
Yes, it can take me
to see him/it Dr. Richards.

127
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:51,306
Right.

128
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:00,619
Excuse.

129
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:04,931
When the universe
he/she began was a ball...

130
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,001
and later: Bum!

131
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:08,600
He/she exploded.

132
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,598
And in a second trilhonésimo...

133
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,098
he expanded exponentially
until the size that we knew today.

134
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:17,007
You are very intelligent.

135
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:20,119
Thank you, that means a lot for me.

136
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:22,339
I adore that music!

137
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:23,843
- Does he/she want to dance?
- I don't want.

138
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:26,680
He/she wants yes! You will dance very well!

139
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:28,992
I don't want to pass shame.

140
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:43,101
Relax! Have fun a little!

141
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:46,380
Quite so! Yes!

142
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,598
Quite so!

143
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:03,560
- He does know as loosening!
- With certainty.

144
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:30,384
- Oh it is him.
- Yes.

145
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,083
Unhappily...

146
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,127
For him.

147
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:45,057
Do let us go?

148
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:52,583
I think is hour of giving wood.

149
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,220
Sue! The one that you are...?

150
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:00,489
General Hages.

151
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:03,202
We are going to a quieter place.

152
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:06,970
Unless you need to take
some drink in the belly of somebody.

153
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:09,994
I was explaining to the girls on...

154
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:12,069
Big Bang's theory.

155
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,948
It was idea of Johnny, me only...

156
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:16,429
I went with him.

157
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:19,731
How does Reed know the General?

158
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:23,991
There are some years he tried to approve
a system of defense anti-missile...

159
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,462
Reed testified that the
technology would not work.

160
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,607
I am here Richards because I am
under direct orders of the state bosses,

161
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,522
personally I don't like the idea
of sharing delicate information...

162
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,857
with a civil scientist.

163
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:37,479
Especially a scientist that
he/she likes to be in the news like this.

164
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:40,295
Always a pleasure to see you also General.

165
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:43,040
In what I can serve him/it?

166
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:44,152
As he/she should know...

167
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,939
...he/she has been having strange events
recently around of the world.

168
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,689
Officially we have been reducing
his/her importance for the public...

169
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:51,693
but we are worried that these...

170
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:55,638
anomalies are a threat
the national security.

171
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:59,170
Those pictures were taken by one of
our satellites spies two days ago.

172
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:03,267
What is?

173
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,773
We waited that the Dr.
Richards told us.

174
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:08,572
I fear that he/she never has
seen something similar.

175
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:10,192
Ben?

176
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,751
I would say that is a meteor...

177
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,309
but the path is all wrong.

178
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,713
This thing is using
his/her own energy.

179
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:19,486
See that.

180
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:23,087
That has spirit around of the
world since the events began.

181
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:27,151
We esteemed that he/she has one
diameter of 200 meters.

182
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,528
If we will discover what is that...

183
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:32,858
we needed to locate and
to intercept that object.

184
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:37,199
It would be possible to create a sensor one linked the
level of satellites of the building Baxter...

185
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:39,750
and we could obtain the exact
location of the object.

186
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:43,179
Good, then you will build
the sensor for us and...

187
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,548
I fear that I am not able to.

188
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:47,030
The something?

189
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:53,161
I will get married in this
Saturday, I don't have time.

190
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,216
Richards, his/her country needs his/her help.

191
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:01,831
Because you don't call for
teacher Jeff Wagner...

192
00:14:01,893 --> 00:14:04,128
he is the director of the
Department of Physics in Brown...

193
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:07,049
- I am sure that he can help you.
- He/she waited plus, Richards.

194
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:09,944
Even of you.

195
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:26,346
John Storm, Fantastic Quartet Ltda.

196
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,530
- Did he/she already make some work as model?
- I am not interested.

197
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:32,495
- You have a wonderful composition.
- I am not interested.

198
00:14:36,284 --> 00:14:38,823
You just left.

199
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,315
And me definitively
I am still speaking.

200
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:44,898
I don't believe that you ended of
to refuse a scientific project.

201
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:48,735
They can build the sensor without me.

202
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,745
The most important thing in that
moment is our marriage...

203
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:55,320
- without postponements, without interruptions.
- Thank you.

204
00:14:55,385 --> 00:14:59,307
And look, on the one that
you saw there at the bar...

205
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:02,738
Don't worry, I know you.

206
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:05,808
I am happy that he/she has if entertaining.

207
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:08,162
Thank you.

208
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:10,588
Besides...

209
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:15,192
...that nor it is compared with the one that me
I did in mine dismissed of unmarried woman.

210
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:18,250
That yes it was wild!

211
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,238
Wild?

212
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:32,825
Let us go!

213
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:07,250
Ei, what are you making here?

214
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:11,012
Anything, I just came to take an air.

215
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:14,123
He/she is making that thing
for the General, it is not?

216
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:17,397
I suppose that Susie no
he/she knows anything about that.

217
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:20,708
Don't worry, mine
lips are stamped.

218
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:23,779
Or they would be if I had some.

219
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:26,949
Don't tell Johnny.

220
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:30,867
- Don't tell Johnny the something?
- Great.

221
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:33,708
- Are you building that thing?
- It is not...

222
00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:36,769
If Sue knows, you will receive
an invisible kick in the balls.

223
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:39,819
- Ei, will maintain that in secret.
- I know.

224
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:41,283
Don't worry.

225
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:44,241
They are calling of
"The Marriage of the Century."

226
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,047
Reed Richards and Susan Storm
also known as...

227
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,492
Sr. Fantastic
and the Invisible Woman...

228
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:54,851
they will get married today in a ceremony
matter in New York...

229
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,924
- Look at those parasites.
- Unbelievable.

230
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:09,954
They are not embarrassed?

231
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:17,543
Ei! All hear! That is one day a lot
special for my sister,

232
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,471
probably the more
special of her life.

233
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:23,973
He/she only wanted to say you is for for
favor to respect our privaciade.

234
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:30,860
I am only playing, we will be auctioning
pictures of the marriage to who gives more...

235
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:34,452
Then space online and put
their bets, thank you.

236
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:38,267
What is necessary for
to date the Human Torch?

237
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:41,434
Lingerie the proof of
fire and a lot he/she will aloe-see.

238
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:43,428
Thank you.

239
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,709
SUSAN STORMS AND REED RICHARDS

240
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,636
- His/her invitation gentleman?
- I should be in that list.

241
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,539
- His/her name?
- Stan Lee.

242
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:12,988
- Yes, well good attempt.
- Serious, I am Stan Lee.

243
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,751
It was not as soon as I imagined.

244
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:20,924
It is never.

245
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,999
No, Alicia.
It is that doesn't seem to be right.

246
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:29,032
Wanted...

247
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:32,063
I think even the super-heroes...

248
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,395
they can feel nervous
in the day of the marriage.

249
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:35,949
It is more than that...

250
00:18:35,978 --> 00:18:38,500
it will be that my life
will a circus always be?

251
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:41,652
It will be that we want to create
our children with all this?

252
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,813
We are not exactly normal.

253
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,508
Ben and I are not normal...

254
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:51,857
But we didn't leave that us
to impede of we be happy.

255
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:55,250
Do you love Reed?

256
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:58,567
Plus that I already loved anybody.

257
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:02,526
Then he/she doesn't need if
to worry with anything.

258
00:19:04,888 --> 00:19:06,409
Thank you.

259
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,502
Ok.

260
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,000
- Great.
- The something?

261
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:22,459
I am with a spine.

262
00:19:22,478 --> 00:19:25,496
- Cannot it throw make-up on top?
- No, leave with me.

263
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:27,739
Avoided crisis.

264
00:19:27,806 --> 00:19:32,551
Now I only need to ponder
continually for the next 8 hours.

265
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:38,061
Reed goes!

266
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,101
- You will lose his/her own marriage!
- One minute.

267
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:44,006
Almost finishing.

268
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:50,841
General, I am putting
the sensor online...

269
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:52,825
- now!
- SYSTEM ONLINE.

270
00:19:57,786 --> 00:20:00,939
That, if there is an increase
if cosmic radiation...

271
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,663
anywhere in the
planet you will know.

272
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:03,839
Hopefully that yes Richards...

273
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:06,065
we already had registration
of more two craters.

274
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:07,499
Oh the bride comes...

275
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:10,624
Everything well, leave me just
to do a link with my PDA.

276
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:13,960
- Reed.
- Ready.

277
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:18,114
Great, now will shave and to put
his/her tuxedo, you will get married in one hour,

278
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:19,490
and it seems a ragged one.

279
00:20:19,491 --> 00:20:20,700
Clear.

280
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,181
The something?

281
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:29,470
I will get married!

282
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:35,547
Oh, ours.

283
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:39,117
I will get married.

284
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:43,363
He/she is getting afraid...

285
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:45,918
SYSTEM ONLINE

286
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,895
Hello, Johnny.

287
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:56,175
Anybody more he/she was surprised?

288
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,483
How did he/she know that was me?
I didn't say anything.

289
00:20:58,564 --> 00:21:01,176
For speaking the truth you
he/she is smelling to ashes.

290
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,009
He/she is late.

291
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:04,846
Oh, we won't speak about me today...

292
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:06,644
He/she is Reed's great day and Sue.

293
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:08,788
We will give attention to them for varying.

294
00:21:08,824 --> 00:21:11,508
Don't make that.

295
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:15,459
- He/she is perfect.
- You are perfect.

296
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:21,399
We see each other up there.

297
00:21:21,891 --> 00:21:23,938
Good-bye Johnny.

298
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:28,372
He/she seems that you and Alicia space well...

299
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:30,254
Irritatively well.

300
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,536
It is, I am a lucky guy.

301
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:34,529
Yes, you are.

302
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:36,348
But I have a pregunta for you...

303
00:21:36,413 --> 00:21:39,901
Like you...?

304
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:43,728
That is not of his/her bill!

305
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,289
He/she is well! He/she was only concerned.

306
00:21:45,323 --> 00:21:48,801
He/she would hate to wake up one day and to see
that she was killed in an avalanche.

307
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,222
I will show you an avalanche!

308
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:54,434
SATELLITE SPY OF THE EUA EPSILON

309
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:12,873
What are you?

310
00:22:22,204 --> 00:22:24,363
Thank you.

311
00:22:25,832 --> 00:22:27,931
Johnny?

312
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:30,913
You should not provoke him/it so much.

313
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:32,777
It was a joke.

314
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,671
I think really inconveniences you
to see him/it happy and passionate.

315
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:40,579
- I think you are jealous.
- Jealousies?

316
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:43,024
Did you see the women that I dated?

317
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:45,263
No.

318
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:50,770
You can only make a mistake
for a time, Torch.

319
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:55,413
Ei, is the bride of the man esticável!

320
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,792
- Don't begin.
- Ignore him/it. You are beautiful.

321
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,140
We see each other outside.

322
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:02,194
Let us go! He/she is in the hour.

323
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:04,255
Ok.

324
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:10,344
He/she knows, you don't seem completely
ridiculous in that dress.

325
00:23:10,366 --> 00:23:15,184
It is a brother's way to say
"You until that is well?"

326
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:17,839
You are beautiful.

327
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:22,482
Thank you.

328
00:23:36,492 --> 00:23:39,145
Dad would be proud.

329
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:42,820
Yes.

330
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:06,518
ALERT OF COSMIC RADIATION

331
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:11,892
- Reed, turn off that cellular one.
- Actually that is...

332
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:56,920
Dear friends, we are
gathered here for...

333
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:01,881
Sweat and Reed! Congratulations for the marriage!

334
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,700
where was I?

335
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:09,672
Dear friends, we are gathered
here today to unite this couple...

336
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:12,893
Reed Richards and Susan Storm...

337
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:17,632
with the bow...

338
00:25:17,689 --> 00:25:21,195
- of the sacred...
- ALERT OF COSMIC RADIATION

339
00:25:21,247 --> 00:25:23,496
marriage.

340
00:25:23,508 --> 00:25:26,199
I don't believe that you
he/she brought that to the marriage!

341
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:28,137
I know, but there is a good reason.

342
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:31,159
- We have to end with that soon.
- That romantic.

343
00:25:31,202 --> 00:25:34,714
- Do I continue?
- Yes, please.

344
00:25:34,804 --> 00:25:39,652
- There are many love types.
- Can it jump for final, please?

345
00:25:39,694 --> 00:25:42,793
- Reed!
- How?

346
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:45,567
IMMINENT ARRIVAL NEW YORK

347
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,259
He/she fails in the motor! We will fall!

348
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,914
Late too much.

349
00:26:18,588 --> 00:26:21,754
- Go for top!
- I am trying!

350
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:40,622
Ben!

351
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:56,890
- Johnny!
- That is a Dolce.

352
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:01,484
To catch fire!

353
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,155
Ours, he is fast!

354
00:27:30,853 --> 00:27:33,137
Oh, that is legal!

355
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,926
Boastful!

356
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,000
Hour of ending with that.

357
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:41,910
Can we talk?

358
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:53,479
Tá well...

359
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:55,351
you won.

360
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,030
To catch fire! Let us go!

361
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,921
To catch fire!

362
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:32,232
Hello.

363
00:29:44,022 --> 00:29:47,319
His/her herald calls him/it.

364
00:29:47,383 --> 00:29:50,067
Another world waits for him.

365
00:29:50,128 --> 00:29:53,487
Begin fast.

366
00:29:57,016 --> 00:29:59,122
He/she seemed a man...

367
00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:02,297
but completely covered with
silver and he flew in one...

368
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:04,993
thing type a surf board.

369
00:30:05,048 --> 00:30:07,757
- I know that seems madness.
- No, that is that.

370
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:09,815
Then, you followed brilliant man...

371
00:30:09,857 --> 00:30:12,205
until the Earth of the candies
at the end of the Rainbow?

372
00:30:12,254 --> 00:30:15,595
- Look, I know what saw.
- Thank you, it is right, Johnny.

373
00:30:15,654 --> 00:30:18,210
Be there which goes his/her aparêcia...

374
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,855
he has the power of
to transform matter and energy.

375
00:30:20,911 --> 00:30:22,438
Did he cause the anomalies then?

376
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:25,868
He seems to irradiate
energy when he/she makes an effort...

377
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,751
affecting matter aleatóriamente.
Evidently this entity, this...

378
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,828
Silvered surfer...

379
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,174
he/she didn't want to be detected.

380
00:30:36,206 --> 00:30:38,296
He/she destroyed the sensor.

381
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:41,545
- Did he know that was being watched?
- And he tracked here.

382
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:44,820
We are working with
somebody very skilled.

383
00:30:47,435 --> 00:30:49,146
Are you feeling well?

384
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:52,770
Yes, I will walk for getting better.

385
00:30:55,746 --> 00:30:59,044
We have to destroy that thing
before he attacks again.

386
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:01,451
Find other way to track him/it.

387
00:31:08,014 --> 00:31:10,485
Sweat, I feel a lot.

388
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:13,995
The only reason of me not to have you counted
it was to avoid that if it worried.

389
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:15,766
I am not angry for you
to have built the sensor.

390
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:18,900
- It was the right thing to do.
- That good.

391
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:23,412
I still didn't finish.

392
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:29,265
Certain, excuse.
Please, continue.

393
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:32,025
Did he/she see? That proves him/it exactly
that I have statement the whole time.

394
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,281
- Can you remove the field, porfavor?
- Us nor we can...

395
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:35,577
Oh, excuse.

396
00:31:35,634 --> 00:31:38,984
We are not able to nor to have a marriage
without turning to 3rd World war.

397
00:31:39,034 --> 00:31:43,362
I know, but when we are
married, everything will return to the normal.

398
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:46,973
We will never have normal lives
while we do what do.

399
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:50,686
How can we create a family like this?

400
00:31:53,331 --> 00:31:57,297
I will see how Johnny is.

401
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:11,396
Johnny?

402
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,609
Ei, are you well?

403
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,986
Johnny?

404
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:30,521
Johnny, are you well?

405
00:32:30,612 --> 00:32:32,382
I don't know.

406
00:32:32,488 --> 00:32:35,538
I feel strange from
that I found the Surfer.

407
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,932
Maybe we should examine him/it.

408
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:41,781
- Because you made that?
- Me no fize anything!

409
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:44,046
Stop, lie down and roll!
Stop, lie down and roll!

410
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:46,801
My god! Sue!

411
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:50,896
Calm! I will stick to!

412
00:32:51,392 --> 00:32:53,592
To catch fire!

413
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:56,316
Care!

414
00:33:00,665 --> 00:33:03,663
Reed!

415
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:06,432
- Help!
- Sue?

416
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:08,027
I am catching fire!

417
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:11,491
- Sue! What is having he/she?
- I am catching fire!

418
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:13,863
- You are catching fire!
- Do you find?

419
00:33:13,902 --> 00:33:16,417
- Wait!
- Pull me for inside!

420
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:21,110
It is the Human Torch!

421
00:33:21,985 --> 00:33:25,380
- I am not Johnny!
- Sue! How did this happen?

422
00:33:25,426 --> 00:33:28,218
I played Johnny and that happened!

423
00:33:28,277 --> 00:33:30,782
- Where is Johnny?
- Here!

424
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:32,878
Play her again!

425
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:41,266
Ei, come out then!

426
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:43,576
Sweat, their clothes!

427
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:47,864
Because that always happens with me?

428
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:51,403
Sue's results are normal.

429
00:33:51,475 --> 00:33:54,377
- But the one of Johnny...
- The one of Johnny the something?

430
00:33:54,443 --> 00:33:57,895
His/her encounter with the Surfer
he/she modified their molecules...

431
00:33:57,951 --> 00:34:00,854
they are floating.

432
00:34:02,371 --> 00:34:04,590
Is that bad?

433
00:34:04,655 --> 00:34:08,251
It took him temporarily the
to change of powers with Sue.

434
00:34:08,281 --> 00:34:10,992
- He/she would like to do some tests...
- Does he/she want a volunteer?

435
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:12,458
- No!
- No!

436
00:34:12,528 --> 00:34:15,282
Wait! That is serious!

437
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,302
He/she only wanted Ihe to give a hug.

438
00:34:17,366 --> 00:34:19,588
We don't know the extension
of his/her problem still.

439
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:21,636
It can be progressive,
it can be degenerative...

440
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,403
- It can be entertaining!
- Ben, not!

441
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:27,476
- Ben!
- Ei, am me!

442
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:29,608
I returned!

443
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:40,129
Oh, my God!

444
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:41,988
Ah go!

445
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:45,873
- Have just said that that was serious!
- Ah yes, serious.

446
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,065
You can only be playing!

447
00:34:51,103 --> 00:34:54,388
- Ei, is not anything badly.
- Incredible.

448
00:34:54,446 --> 00:34:58,018
- It is good that you do something about that!
- I am taking care of that.

449
00:34:58,327 --> 00:35:00,314
Ben stops with that!

450
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,196
I am beginning to see
because you like that.

451
00:35:02,212 --> 00:35:04,797
No, no, no, no, not.

452
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:09,970
- Ah, drug.
- It is not graced!

453
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:12,102
What should I make in the middle time?

454
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:15,294
Only try to maintain far away from us.

455
00:35:16,944 --> 00:35:21,569
You and I will begin to pass
a lot of time together, friend!

456
00:35:29,775 --> 00:35:34,160
Internal Fontes says
that unlucky Sue Storm...

457
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:37,377
If it turned invisible and
he/she should continue like this...

458
00:35:37,407 --> 00:35:39,808
...after the fiasco
shameful yesterday.

459
00:35:39,865 --> 00:35:43,728
To proceed, the largest mistakes
of the Invisible Woman's fashion...

460
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:48,229
and a dance choreography
of former-scientist Reed Richards.

461
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:52,534
Because you continue the
to see ese garbage? Ignore him/it!

462
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:56,074
I cannot ignore him/it Reed,
he/she doesn't have as escaping of that.

463
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:58,605
- I think he/she has!
- How?

464
00:35:59,392 --> 00:36:02,870
Did he/she see? He/she doesn't have an answer.

465
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,411
Yes, he/she has.

466
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,056
It is been...

467
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,482
after this crisis to end...

468
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:15,591
- do everything leave for behind?
- What are you speaking about?

469
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:17,789
We moved of the Edifício Baxter...

470
00:36:17,815 --> 00:36:20,618
I arrange a vacancy of
teacher somewhere.

471
00:36:20,694 --> 00:36:22,725
I return to my research.

472
00:36:22,757 --> 00:36:27,455
And we will have our lives and we will create
a family as normal people.

473
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:29,543
Would you make that?

474
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:33,444
Nothing is more important for
me of our together future.

475
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:36,973
Ah, thank you.

476
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:44,702
And as for Ben and Johnny?

477
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:46,852
They will understand.

478
00:36:46,932 --> 00:36:50,728
Besides, Johnny always
he/she liked more of acting alone.

479
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:53,200
But we won't tell to them still.

480
00:36:53,258 --> 00:36:57,694
They already have enough with the one that if
to worry with his/her altered power.

481
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,173
GLACIER RUSSELL GROELÂNDIA

482
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:58,370
You have been having been busy, friend.

483
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:01,896
Their talents are impressive.

484
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:07,173
Can you understand him/it what am speaking?

485
00:38:08,864 --> 00:38:12,729
Together, we can be unbeatable.

486
00:38:12,784 --> 00:38:16,243
Everything would have that wanted.

487
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:19,692
Everything that you know
he/she is reaching the end.

488
00:38:19,793 --> 00:38:22,570
What does with that mean?

489
00:38:22,621 --> 00:38:24,308
Wait!

490
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:26,506
I spoke for waiting!

491
00:38:50,064 --> 00:38:52,017
They will put an end to the team.

492
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,889
I heard Reed and Sue talking,
they want a normal and annoying life.

493
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,588
Nothing else of Fantastic Quartet.

494
00:38:58,617 --> 00:39:00,600
What should make?

495
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:03,353
- To continue only both of us?
- Calling us of something?

496
00:39:03,406 --> 00:39:06,647
- The Dynamic Duet?
- When did they go in the saying?

497
00:39:06,686 --> 00:39:09,498
When they are ready to say.

498
00:39:09,585 --> 00:39:11,837
It is their decision, no of you.

499
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,614
They cannot be angry with them
for they do what leave them happy.

500
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:18,434
Boys...

501
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,137
We have a serious problem.

502
00:39:21,186 --> 00:39:25,828
I compared the Surfer's radiation with
the whole base of astronomical data.

503
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:29,746
Altair 7, Rigel 3, Vega 6.

504
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:32,748
- Was he in all these planets?
- It is now they are without life.

505
00:39:32,798 --> 00:39:34,965
They are sterile, some are to the pieces.

506
00:39:35,028 --> 00:39:39,983
Where the Surfer goes,
8 days later the planet dies.

507
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,948
And how will we impede him/it?

508
00:39:44,012 --> 00:39:46,856
Us nor we know where he is.

509
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,086
And the craters?

510
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:58,640
They are appearing
in numeric sequence.

511
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:01,683
The last crater was
formed in Groelândia, then...

512
00:40:01,731 --> 00:40:04,595
the close in the sequence should be...

513
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:07,773
to 51 degrees, 30 minutes,
north latitude...

514
00:40:07,816 --> 00:40:13,379
longitude: 0 degrees,
7 minutes to west.

515
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:28,527
When the Surfer appears we have
that to move away the fight of the crowd.

516
00:40:28,573 --> 00:40:30,295
He is very fast for being contained.

517
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,880
- When I see the Silvery, I will attack!
- He/she cannot make that!

518
00:40:32,914 --> 00:40:34,809
We will follow the plan and
to work as a team.

519
00:40:34,862 --> 00:40:36,814
Are Ah, then now a team?

520
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:39,095
- What are you speaking about?
- You know what am speaking!

521
00:40:39,143 --> 00:40:41,786
- We will tell to you...
- When will they count?

522
00:40:41,825 --> 00:40:43,739
When they were removing
the things of the building?

523
00:40:43,785 --> 00:40:45,172
Johnny, really
it is not a good time.

524
00:40:45,232 --> 00:40:47,835
The boy is right Reed,
you should have us counted.

525
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:50,413
Certain, already arrives!
We will talk about that later!

526
00:40:50,455 --> 00:40:52,719
What devils do have wrong with you?

527
00:41:49,695 --> 00:41:51,745
Don't loosen!

528
00:42:01,876 --> 00:42:04,985
Move, we go!

529
00:42:20,978 --> 00:42:23,127
No! Johnny!

530
00:42:42,216 --> 00:42:46,185
People! What are making?

531
00:42:52,624 --> 00:42:57,005
- Ben! Get up higher!
- I will try.

532
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:30,128
Sue!

533
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:37,309
Be far!

534
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:39,833
Before it ends up killing somebody.

535
00:43:41,648 --> 00:43:44,481
My God!

536
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:05,928
What devils were that?

537
00:44:05,963 --> 00:44:08,772
We will make modifications.
Next time we will be ready.

538
00:44:08,807 --> 00:44:12,830
Next time?
There won't be next time.

539
00:44:12,865 --> 00:44:14,774
You are not able to
to take care of that, alone.

540
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:16,441
It is for that that I am bringing help.

541
00:44:16,476 --> 00:44:20,509
To bring soldiers and weapons will go for
innocent people in danger.

542
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,366
No more than you already put.

543
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,648
Victor?

544
00:44:29,683 --> 00:44:33,189
Which the problem?
Is he/she afraid of ghosts?

545
00:44:35,402 --> 00:44:36,837
Don't move!

546
00:44:36,872 --> 00:44:40,572
Being a ghost, he/she won't care
if I break his/her neck!

547
00:44:40,573 --> 00:44:42,491
- Loosen him/it!
- Who does know he/she he is?

548
00:44:42,526 --> 00:44:45,391
Victor Von Doom.
He is here under my orders.

549
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:53,769
Ben, loosen him/it.

550
00:44:56,848 --> 00:44:58,808
How is it possible?

551
00:45:00,727 --> 00:45:02,851
How can it still be alive?

552
00:45:02,886 --> 00:45:06,498
It was not thanks to you
four, that I guarantee.

553
00:45:06,499 --> 00:45:08,666
Von Doom made contact
with the Martian...

554
00:45:08,698 --> 00:45:10,702
...and he/she has valuable information.

555
00:45:10,703 --> 00:45:13,918
Information that can
to save the planet.

556
00:45:14,474 --> 00:45:16,100
Let us leave a very clear thing...

557
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:19,978
Right?
I hate them.

558
00:45:21,614 --> 00:45:22,938
All you.

559
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:29,388
But the world is in game and
we needed to join to survive.

560
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:33,459
We know for experience that if
to trust Victor will be sorry.

561
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:37,987
Up to now only I was sorry of
to have trusted you, Richards.

562
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:41,899
Reed, don't accept.

563
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,541
Let us see what he has.

564
00:45:49,742 --> 00:45:53,412
I made a detailed recording
of our encounter.

565
00:45:53,613 --> 00:45:56,905
Everything that knows is
reaching his/her end.

566
00:45:59,372 --> 00:46:00,747
Is it then?

567
00:46:00,782 --> 00:46:04,822
I like the part in that he drops you.

568
00:46:06,592 --> 00:46:10,919
Look at the levels of
energy when they attack me.

569
00:46:12,632 --> 00:46:14,991
There! Did they see him/it what happened?

570
00:46:17,537 --> 00:46:21,473
The energy was channeling for
him, but he/she originated from the board.

571
00:46:21,674 --> 00:46:26,311
If we separate him of his/her board,
we can cut his/her energy entirely.

572
00:46:26,512 --> 00:46:29,132
- We needed to do that.
- How?

573
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:31,815
If I not knew
he/she would need you.

574
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:36,730
You two começem already.

575
00:46:42,662 --> 00:46:46,638
I am happy of we be
working together again.

576
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,835
I will try to speak slowly,
for you to understand.

577
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:01,020
- How can we form an alliance with Victor?
- I don't understand.

578
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:04,431
It was much simpler
when it could ignore him/it.

579
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:13,984
I will pay for that!

580
00:47:14,024 --> 00:47:15,452
It is good same.

581
00:47:15,453 --> 00:47:16,999
I need to tell you, Ben.

582
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:19,264
I begin to feel that am
a complete one unsuccessful.

583
00:47:19,465 --> 00:47:22,334
Well, I not complete.

584
00:47:22,535 --> 00:47:23,824
Thank you.

585
00:47:24,504 --> 00:47:28,373
It doesn't depend more on us,
now it is with the inteligentes.

586
00:47:28,574 --> 00:47:32,477
He/she thinks Reed has
reason on the end of the world?

587
00:47:32,678 --> 00:47:35,947
He/she never wandered on those things.

588
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:39,351
And I am not one
very sentimental person.

589
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:40,910
Truth?

590
00:47:42,522 --> 00:47:45,814
But if Reed is
certain and that is the end...

591
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:50,922
How does he/she want their last minutes to pass?

592
00:47:51,531 --> 00:47:54,766
He/she leaves of me wants go struggle.

593
00:47:56,669 --> 00:47:58,580
But the truth...

594
00:47:58,615 --> 00:48:02,765
I would like to pass my last ones
minutes hugging Alicia.

595
00:48:04,544 --> 00:48:06,535
He/she seems great.

596
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,557
I want to say, it doesn't break her
of hugging Alicia.

597
00:48:09,558 --> 00:48:12,284
She is his/her girlfriend,
I don't want anything with her.

598
00:48:12,485 --> 00:48:17,289
No that it is not attractive, it is
very attractive, too attractive!

599
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:18,920
Even with...
You understand.

600
00:48:18,955 --> 00:48:21,726
I don't imagine a guy
that would not want...

601
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:24,989
The one that I want say...

602
00:48:25,498 --> 00:48:27,959
it is great to have somebody.

603
00:48:31,863 --> 00:48:33,972
You have to me, friend.

604
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:50,289
How is it going going?

605
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:52,018
I don't get to find a connection.

606
00:48:52,592 --> 00:48:54,759
- Everything will be well. You have...
- Don't go!

607
00:48:54,794 --> 00:48:57,831
Everyone bill with me and...

608
00:48:58,731 --> 00:49:01,223
Reed, you will find the solution.

609
00:49:01,224 --> 00:49:03,183
- He/she always finds.
- Yes thank you, Su.

610
00:49:03,218 --> 00:49:05,143
- He/she just needs to relax.
- Clear.

611
00:49:05,178 --> 00:49:06,471
It is true.

612
00:49:06,672 --> 00:49:09,198
Reed, needs to relax.

613
00:49:09,785 --> 00:49:11,801
Breathe bottom.

614
00:49:12,678 --> 00:49:14,379
Slowly.

615
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,848
It is that there.

616
00:49:17,617 --> 00:49:19,976
We go, again.

617
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:25,948
Did he/she see? I already get to feel
his/her pulsation decreasing.

618
00:49:27,727 --> 00:49:31,758
- He/she remembers that time...?
- A pulse.

619
00:49:33,699 --> 00:49:37,191
A pulse of Taquión.
I love you.

620
00:49:38,571 --> 00:49:39,963
I am happy in could help.

621
00:50:00,374 --> 00:50:04,487
- How does that work exactly?
- When we activate the field of force...

622
00:50:04,522 --> 00:50:07,432
it will separate him/it of his/her board
leaving him/it without being able to.

623
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:09,501
As a fish in the net.

624
00:50:09,702 --> 00:50:10,969
Yes.

625
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:12,767
At least in theory.

626
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:16,080
- How much lack to have that ready?
- Three hours.

627
00:50:16,115 --> 00:50:17,376
Three hours?

628
00:50:17,577 --> 00:50:20,445
I know, I cannot be faster,
I am working alone now.

629
00:50:20,646 --> 00:50:24,449
- What does to finish need?
- Actually, some things.

630
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,885
The engineer of the field of force...

631
00:50:37,908 --> 00:50:39,471
What is making he/she?

632
00:50:40,633 --> 00:50:42,260
Doesn't he/she beat when entering?

633
00:50:42,295 --> 00:50:44,236
He/she should be helping
to Reed in the laboratory.

634
00:50:44,437 --> 00:50:47,486
Say to calm, I will be
there to hold his hands and...

635
00:50:47,521 --> 00:50:50,197
to finish the project for him.

636
00:50:53,546 --> 00:50:55,043
Plus some thing?

637
00:50:55,078 --> 00:50:57,021
How did he/she do?

638
00:50:58,651 --> 00:51:00,885
How did it return?

639
00:51:03,689 --> 00:51:05,957
Does that scare you, not?

640
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:11,064
The things that I can do.

641
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:13,956
He/she knew that can create a field
of force inside of somebody...

642
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:16,501
and to expand him until exploding?

643
00:51:16,702 --> 00:51:19,158
Give his/her best blow.

644
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,619
Just return to the laboratory.

645
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:34,334
Sr. Storm?

646
00:51:34,587 --> 00:51:38,356
We will intercept the Silver Surfer
in 10 minutes, with or without you.

647
00:51:38,557 --> 00:51:43,874
You were waiting out of the
bathroom to try to see me of towel?

648
00:51:49,635 --> 00:51:52,437
It was game, he/she was playing.

649
00:51:52,638 --> 00:51:55,540
Why is so hard with me?
Nor he/she knows me.

650
00:51:55,741 --> 00:51:59,444
I know him/it very well, I read
his/her personality profile.

651
00:51:59,645 --> 00:52:02,380
Confident, careless, irresponsible.

652
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:05,782
Obsessed for himself,
almost narcisista.

653
00:52:06,169 --> 00:52:07,624
He/she is well, yes he/she knows me.

654
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:11,210
Everything that I saw was a face
that almost killed his/her team.

655
00:52:12,137 --> 00:52:13,999
Everything well.

656
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,930
I have been playing badly lately.

657
00:52:17,663 --> 00:52:19,931
That is not a game.

658
00:52:31,477 --> 00:52:32,578
BLACK FOREST GERMANY

659
00:52:32,613 --> 00:52:35,570
Mister, he is in one
position to the north of here.

660
00:52:35,605 --> 00:52:36,688
- Great.
- General...

661
00:52:36,723 --> 00:52:38,598
- Feel a perimeter of 2 Km.
- Forget, Richard.

662
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:40,920
He/she already had his/her opportunity
and it wasted.

663
00:52:40,955 --> 00:52:42,564
That is a military operation, now.

664
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:46,210
Block the sign, stand back and
let to do us our work.

665
00:52:46,245 --> 00:52:49,361
- You don't understand.
- No, you that doesn't understand.

666
00:52:49,562 --> 00:52:52,560
Let to explain to me to you and
his/her bunch of eccentric here.

667
00:52:52,595 --> 00:52:55,844
I am the quarterback,
you are in my team.

668
00:52:55,879 --> 00:52:57,301
Did he/she understand?

669
00:52:58,015 --> 00:53:00,893
But I think never played
American soccer in the school.

670
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,873
It is not even, Richards?

671
00:53:03,676 --> 00:53:06,255
No, he/she is right.
I didn't play.

672
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:09,412
He/she was studying, as
a good student nerd.

673
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:12,967
And 15 years later...

674
00:53:13,061 --> 00:53:16,078
I am one of the minds
more diamonds of the century 21.

675
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:19,095
I am fiancé with the girl
sexier of the world.

676
00:53:19,592 --> 00:53:22,442
And the great athlete that was
quarterback in the school...

677
00:53:22,477 --> 00:53:25,497
he/she is in front of me,
asking for me help.

678
00:53:25,698 --> 00:53:29,267
And I say that won't help
in absolutely anything...

679
00:53:29,468 --> 00:53:31,797
unless he/she does what I say.

680
00:53:31,998 --> 00:53:36,764
And begin to treat me and mine
friends with more respect.

681
00:53:44,717 --> 00:53:47,008
Give to him that he wants.

682
00:53:49,488 --> 00:53:51,389
I am burning me
so much for you, now.

683
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:54,882
- Me also!
- Care, Johnny!

684
00:54:07,094 --> 00:54:08,671
It is here.

685
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:11,017
You have their coordinates.

686
00:54:11,052 --> 00:54:14,662
Prepare their positions and
meet of turn here.

687
00:54:25,558 --> 00:54:27,826
Primero squadron, move forward!

688
00:55:00,593 --> 00:55:04,920
He/she scared me, Smonk.
He/she looks at you, as it is beautiful.

689
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:14,926
It is quite so, continue
running, Bu-Bu!

690
00:55:15,674 --> 00:55:18,544
Plush ball super developed.

691
00:55:19,512 --> 00:55:21,893
- Which is the situation?
- I am ready.

692
00:55:21,928 --> 00:55:23,381
Me also.

693
00:55:23,582 --> 00:55:24,951
I am almost.

694
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,430
Boys?

695
00:55:37,663 --> 00:55:39,498
We have a problem.

696
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:42,029
- What was?
- He is here.

697
00:55:43,186 --> 00:55:46,307
Leave then, right now!

698
00:56:07,726 --> 00:56:09,926
Why is destroying our planet?

699
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,431
I don't have choice.

700
00:56:13,632 --> 00:56:15,866
- Sue!
- Wait!

701
00:56:18,467 --> 00:56:21,272
The one that wants say with:
"Don't I have choice?"

702
00:56:21,473 --> 00:56:23,900
There is always a choice.

703
00:56:24,677 --> 00:56:26,911
Not always.

704
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:30,415
Why is trying to destroy us?

705
00:56:30,616 --> 00:56:33,908
I am not the destructor.

706
00:56:34,553 --> 00:56:37,297
We are going Richards, block
the damned sign.

707
00:56:37,332 --> 00:56:39,882
Maybe need a little persuasion.

708
00:56:41,237 --> 00:56:43,886
- Shoot one.
- Understood.

709
00:56:58,544 --> 00:56:59,936
To open fire!

710
00:57:10,556 --> 00:57:11,845
Stand back!

711
00:57:15,285 --> 00:57:17,818
- Leave me...
- No, wait!

712
00:57:18,697 --> 00:57:19,986
Reed.

713
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,832
We are going Sue!

714
00:57:24,503 --> 00:57:25,743
Ready.

715
00:57:26,129 --> 00:57:27,642
Reed!

716
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,269
I diffused him.

717
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:58,027
It is not so strong now, it is not even?

718
00:58:06,545 --> 00:58:08,904
Victor, stand back!

719
00:58:09,648 --> 00:58:11,882
You are the quarterback!

720
00:58:28,701 --> 00:58:31,902
Watch him/it.
Continue appearing for him!

721
00:58:32,705 --> 00:58:34,870
Take him.

722
00:58:39,176 --> 00:58:41,712
STATION OF INYEPTUK

723
00:58:55,688 --> 00:58:57,780
- General, we had a treatment.
- Calm down!

724
00:58:57,815 --> 00:58:59,872
The enemy was captured,
accomplished mission.

725
00:58:59,907 --> 00:59:02,400
- Where is he?
- Arrested.

726
00:59:02,601 --> 00:59:04,027
General?

727
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:07,802
Sr. Sherman.

728
00:59:09,575 --> 00:59:11,984
If they give us license,
we have work to do.

729
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:15,356
- I want to be in the interrogation.
- It won't be possible.

730
00:59:15,391 --> 00:59:18,559
Assure that our guests
be here, comfortably.

731
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,447
Yes, gentleman.

732
00:59:22,721 --> 00:59:24,489
General, and the board?

733
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:28,235
He/she is in a camera
that codifies her sign.

734
00:59:46,512 --> 00:59:51,387
There are things that I cannot do
because they violate human rights.

735
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:54,981
Happily, you no human being.

736
01:00:01,107 --> 01:00:02,805
Are we prisoners?

737
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:04,956
How did that happen?

738
01:00:05,697 --> 01:00:08,604
Seemingly, they don't want that
interfere with their methods.

739
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,164
Nor I imagine him/it that
they are doing with him.

740
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:13,100
It is what deserves.

741
01:00:13,135 --> 01:00:14,373
How can that say?

742
01:00:14,408 --> 01:00:17,064
Maybe the General was right.

743
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:20,670
The guy was about to destroy
the planet, he said.

744
01:00:20,705 --> 01:00:24,205
He/she doesn't have sense.
He protected me of the missíl.

745
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,999
- Why would make that?
- Maybe you find beautiful.

746
01:00:27,034 --> 01:00:30,455
He/she has much more something in that.
He said that was not the destructor.

747
01:00:30,656 --> 01:00:32,890
Maybe have lied.

748
01:00:35,681 --> 01:00:38,701
We needed to enter there and to speak with him.

749
01:00:39,342 --> 01:00:42,092
But without they notice.

750
01:00:46,622 --> 01:00:48,983
He/she has as it gets us some DVDs...

751
01:00:49,018 --> 01:00:50,929
or popcorn or something like that
for the time to pass?

752
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:53,444
- I will ask.
- Excellent, thank you.

753
01:00:53,645 --> 01:00:54,806
Semper Fi.

754
01:00:54,841 --> 01:00:57,515
Those are the riflemen
naval, we are the army.

755
01:00:57,716 --> 01:01:00,985
Certain, I know.
You are the army.

756
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:10,167
Captain Raye, allowed access.

757
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:28,755
General, Von Doom
he/she wants to speak with you.

758
01:01:29,462 --> 01:01:32,642
He/she should cooperate a little more.

759
01:01:32,929 --> 01:01:34,434
Sr. Sherman.

760
01:01:34,439 --> 01:01:36,845
We will make a pause.

761
01:01:53,786 --> 01:01:55,659
I know that is there.

762
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:09,595
How if he/she calls?

763
01:02:11,784 --> 01:02:14,226
He/she should have a name.

764
01:02:14,644 --> 01:02:16,620
My name is Susan.

765
01:02:20,701 --> 01:02:24,171
You said that was not who was
trying to destroy our world.

766
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:25,628
Then who is it?

767
01:02:25,663 --> 01:02:29,770
- That who I serve.
- And to who you do serve?

768
01:02:31,522 --> 01:02:36,682
I am trying to help you, but for
that, needs to tell me the truth.

769
01:02:36,717 --> 01:02:38,809
Please.

770
01:02:49,025 --> 01:02:53,565
It is known by many names,
my people called him/it of...

771
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,715
Galactus.

772
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,727
The Devouring of Worlds.

773
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:04,853
He/she has to feed of
energy to survive.

774
01:03:05,277 --> 01:03:07,007
So much thermal...

775
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:08,703
as organic.

776
01:03:08,738 --> 01:03:11,988
- How can it help him/it?
- Because I am thank you.

777
01:03:12,023 --> 01:03:16,980
He/she doesn't inconvenience to help you the
to destroy worlds and innocent people?

778
01:03:17,015 --> 01:03:21,186
When serving him/it, me safe my world.

779
01:03:21,221 --> 01:03:23,621
And the person that I love.

780
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:28,477
Why did try to protect me?

781
01:03:29,602 --> 01:03:31,282
Because...

782
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:35,679
you make to remember of her.

783
01:03:49,266 --> 01:03:52,207
You get to stop
the Destructor if he/she wants?

784
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:56,519
I am not me who he/she brings him/it
Destructor here, is the light-guide.

785
01:03:56,554 --> 01:04:00,770
- What is the light-guide?
- The source of my power.

786
01:04:00,805 --> 01:04:02,855
His/her board?

787
01:04:05,785 --> 01:04:09,495
Take advantage the last ones
hours that remain you...

788
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:13,000
because he is almost here.

789
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:33,018
I helped to give him/it
extraterrestrial, as I promised.

790
01:04:33,053 --> 01:04:36,168
It is hour of accomplishing his/her part of the treatment.

791
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:39,318
You can make the tests in the board.

792
01:04:40,238 --> 01:04:44,706
But only with guards
armed and in my presence.

793
01:04:44,741 --> 01:04:46,558
Logical.

794
01:04:53,063 --> 01:04:56,478
General Hager, allowed access.

795
01:05:19,414 --> 01:05:21,250
It is the board that attracts him/it for here.

796
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:23,318
As if it struggles with something
what can eat planets?

797
01:05:23,353 --> 01:05:26,377
We have to take the board for
far away from here before it is late.

798
01:05:26,412 --> 01:05:29,246
He/she thinks the General
will he/she agree with that?

799
01:05:29,622 --> 01:05:31,641
He doesn't have choice.

800
01:05:33,716 --> 01:05:35,801
Thank you General.

801
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,559
But I fear...

802
01:05:38,897 --> 01:05:40,860
The truth is that...

803
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:44,435
Sometimes Reed is right.

804
01:06:00,526 --> 01:06:03,330
Ei you, come here.

805
01:06:03,441 --> 01:06:05,390
Let to wonder a thing.

806
01:07:06,959 --> 01:07:09,251
Very well.

807
01:07:13,086 --> 01:07:14,945
Ah, drug!

808
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,252
Ben!

809
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:29,672
Certain, that didn't hurt.

810
01:07:29,707 --> 01:07:31,706
Where is Reed?

811
01:07:31,741 --> 01:07:33,567
Here behind.

812
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:45,660
He/she blames my.

813
01:07:52,878 --> 01:07:54,482
Reed!

814
01:07:58,461 --> 01:08:01,678
Victor. We have to recover her.

815
01:08:01,713 --> 01:08:05,141
We needed the surfer, he is
the only that he/she knows her power.

816
01:08:05,176 --> 01:08:08,613
Even if loosen him/it,
how will we reach Victor?

817
01:08:10,316 --> 01:08:11,408
Leave that with me.

818
01:08:41,188 --> 01:08:43,793
- Stopped!
- Be where they are!

819
01:08:47,031 --> 01:08:48,423
Friendly...

820
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,421
That is his/her lucky day!

821
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:57,446
That devils are happening
Where is the General Hager?

822
01:08:57,463 --> 01:08:58,726
He is dead.

823
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:01,508
And if we don't remove him
of here, all will be.

824
01:09:01,543 --> 01:09:02,886
Frankie...

825
01:09:05,162 --> 01:09:07,532
The world is literally
in game, here.

826
01:09:07,567 --> 01:09:09,931
You have to trust us.

827
01:09:10,676 --> 01:09:12,534
Please.

828
01:09:15,481 --> 01:09:18,450
We have to arrive in the roof!
He should already be here!

829
01:09:18,451 --> 01:09:20,314
What should be here he/she?

830
01:09:29,562 --> 01:09:31,691
Gee!

831
01:09:31,726 --> 01:09:33,562
Reed...

832
01:09:33,748 --> 01:09:37,402
Esssa was the thing
more legal than you already did!

833
01:09:45,967 --> 01:09:48,442
- Is a Hemi?
- Clear.

834
01:09:49,528 --> 01:09:52,283
Ben, you go there inside.
Johnny, fly behind us.

835
01:09:52,318 --> 01:09:54,566
- He/she has to let to pilot me.
- He/she can forget.

836
01:09:54,601 --> 01:09:56,815
- I am the best pilot here.
- Is he/she speaking serious?

837
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:58,073
We will have that is supplied
to tolerate his/her weight!

838
01:09:58,108 --> 01:10:00,646
I can fly in circles the
his/her turn of eye blindfolded.

839
01:10:00,681 --> 01:10:03,711
Shut up and move her!

840
01:10:03,746 --> 01:10:05,677
I pilot!

841
01:10:16,524 --> 01:10:21,342
Certain, now we are
officially enemies from the USA.

842
01:10:21,377 --> 01:10:24,291
Victor is somewhere
for oh, with being able to limitless.

843
01:10:24,326 --> 01:10:27,083
And we have a force
giant intergalática...

844
01:10:27,085 --> 01:10:32,022
that will destroy the planet in less
of 24 hours. Did I forget of something?

845
01:10:33,025 --> 01:10:35,540
I caught a trace of
energy left by Victor.

846
01:10:35,575 --> 01:10:38,055
He/she is on the southeast of China.
Sit tight!

847
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,121
Norrin Radd.

848
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,424
The something?

849
01:10:46,459 --> 01:10:50,490
I was already known as Norrin Radd.

850
01:10:50,525 --> 01:10:53,510
Norrin, will need yours
he/she helps to save our world.

851
01:10:53,545 --> 01:10:55,810
Do you understand?

852
01:11:01,086 --> 01:11:03,129
What devils were that?

853
01:11:04,369 --> 01:11:07,794
Victor, the board is
attracting the Destructor here.

854
01:11:07,829 --> 01:11:09,154
You have to open her hand.

855
01:11:09,194 --> 01:11:12,129
He/she knows that never went of the type
of opening hand of the things, Reed.

856
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:13,961
Be held!

857
01:11:27,467 --> 01:11:29,139
We are an easy objective.

858
01:11:29,147 --> 01:11:30,423
We have to separate!

859
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:33,042
- The something?
- That should be to be entertaining!

860
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:35,258
Be close to me, Sue.

861
01:12:02,615 --> 01:12:04,832
I am irritating myself of truth.

862
01:12:10,155 --> 01:12:13,022
Hour of surfing, metal head!

863
01:12:15,093 --> 01:12:18,684
Victor, just the Surfer
it can stop the Destructor...

864
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:20,190
but he needs his board.

865
01:12:20,198 --> 01:12:23,725
- Come to catch her, Richards!
- Victor!

866
01:12:27,195 --> 01:12:30,829
We will give a rotated!

867
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:10,843
Norrin!

868
01:13:13,207 --> 01:13:14,632
I caught you!

869
01:13:29,016 --> 01:13:30,364
Sue!

870
01:13:35,443 --> 01:13:36,866
My God!

871
01:13:36,967 --> 01:13:38,570
Sue...

872
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,186
Johnny doesn't play in her!

873
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:49,043
They need to discover one
way of catching the board.

874
01:13:49,078 --> 01:13:51,111
Sweat, me...

875
01:13:59,164 --> 01:14:01,244
He is here.

876
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:10,321
Reed?

877
01:14:14,343 --> 01:14:17,598
Victor should have an originator of
pulses that he/she arrests him the board.

878
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,473
If we remove the originator...

879
01:14:19,836 --> 01:14:21,845
we can separate him/it of the board.

880
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,889
- He is too strong for me.
- I could catch him/it...

881
01:14:23,924 --> 01:14:27,981
if I arrive close enough, but him
I can see myself the a mile of distance.

882
01:14:29,161 --> 01:14:31,095
We needed all of us.

883
01:14:32,964 --> 01:14:35,030
Or maybe just one of us.

884
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:41,777
We don't know him/it that that
he/she can do with you.

885
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:45,133
We won't turn that on me.

886
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,444
To mention my friend:

887
01:15:09,034 --> 01:15:10,838
It is hour of giving wood!

888
01:16:07,058 --> 01:16:09,049
He/she won't die struggling, boy.

889
01:16:10,996 --> 01:16:12,156
Not without me!

890
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,781
You have to go!

891
01:18:21,756 --> 01:18:24,962
All value the moments with her.

892
01:18:24,996 --> 01:18:27,555
And say that she was right.

893
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:32,084
We have a choice.

894
01:18:57,354 --> 01:18:59,776
I thought that was able to
to need of a help.

895
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:06,177
My God!

896
01:19:34,933 --> 01:19:36,924
Why is not working he/she?

897
01:19:37,936 --> 01:19:39,995
We arrived too late.

898
01:19:48,298 --> 01:19:52,042
No more I will serve you.

899
01:19:52,734 --> 01:19:58,090
That is the end for both of us.

900
01:21:19,347 --> 01:21:21,081
Hi.

901
01:21:22,941 --> 01:21:24,961
Hi.

902
01:21:28,948 --> 01:21:30,892
What did I lose?

903
01:21:41,828 --> 01:21:44,397
- We got!
- Good work, boy!

904
01:21:45,596 --> 01:21:49,381
He/she waits, I am not changing.

905
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:52,988
You are right.
Great!

906
01:21:54,372 --> 01:21:57,814
Certain, now you are me
leaving uncomfortable.

907
01:22:16,527 --> 01:22:19,179
Then I think is that.

908
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:22,164
Each one is going to his/her side.

909
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:24,047
No.

910
01:22:24,568 --> 01:22:25,697
No?

911
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:27,432
- No!
- No?

912
01:22:27,505 --> 01:22:29,999
If it didn't go for the team, the world
all would have finishing now.

913
01:22:30,034 --> 01:22:31,915
We cannot flee of
our responsibilities...

914
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:35,277
and of the people that we needed to protect.
That is who we are.

915
01:22:35,312 --> 01:22:38,605
- It is what I was saying.
- And his/her normal life, a family?

916
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,484
Who said that is necessary to be
normal to have a family?

917
01:22:43,387 --> 01:22:45,926
Then it is prepared for more
a marriage full of press?

918
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,794
The fifth time is the lucky.

919
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:49,486
No.

920
01:22:51,529 --> 01:22:53,554
I have a better idea.

921
01:23:05,443 --> 01:23:10,380
Dear friends, we are here gathered
here to unite Reed Richards...

922
01:23:10,414 --> 01:23:14,544
and Sue Storm in sacred matri...

923
01:23:14,552 --> 01:23:16,452
...mônio

924
01:23:16,454 --> 01:23:17,512
What was?

925
01:23:17,521 --> 01:23:19,455
Venice is sinking
in the Adriatic sea.

926
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:21,481
Ah skies, that is serious.

927
01:23:21,492 --> 01:23:23,357
Can we jump for the end?

928
01:23:25,563 --> 01:23:28,211
- The love that shares...
- No the same end..

929
01:23:28,246 --> 01:23:31,237
Excellent, does he/she have the rings?

930
01:23:40,411 --> 01:23:43,574
Now I declare them husband and
woman, and he/she can kiss the bride.

931
01:23:50,521 --> 01:23:52,990
- Certain, we should go.
- Yes.

932
01:23:53,025 --> 01:23:55,460
- I have to go.
- Everything well.

933
01:23:59,999 --> 01:24:02,190
I have to play the bouquet.

934
01:24:02,433 --> 01:24:03,881
Prepared?

935
01:24:12,741 --> 01:24:14,917
Attention, Johnny!

936
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:27,114
Excuse!

937
01:24:28,459 --> 01:24:30,346
It was a reflex!

938
01:24:38,135 --> 01:24:44,676
