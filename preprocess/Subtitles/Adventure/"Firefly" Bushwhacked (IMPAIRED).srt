00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:20,802
Anyway, we're just here to pick the
bones. You two start in the engine room.

160
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:23,931
Jayne, you take the galley.

161
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:26,669
You, um, have this on wrong.

162
00:11:30,614 --> 00:11:32,639
[ Laughs ]

163
00:11:32,716 --> 00:11:36,652
Sir, I count 16 families signed on.

164
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,984
Lifeboat wouldn't hold a third of that.

165
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:41,524
I know.
Wash, any luck?

166
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:45,357
Think I found something
that pretty well matches that class.
The layout looks about right.

167
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:48,660
Seems to me any valuables,
if there are any...

168
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:50,700
would likely be stored
somewhere...

169
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:52,701
C-Deck, aft.

170
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:55,704
Good work. Keep the engine running.
We shouldn't be long.

171
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:02,341
River? It's Inara.

172
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:06,508
Are you hungry, sweetie?

173
00:12:09,953 --> 00:12:11,944
River?

174
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:27,703
[ Simon ]
Aren't you the least bit curious?

175
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:29,500
About what?

176
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:33,304
Well, what happened here.

177
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:37,312
I mean, why would anybody abandon their ship
in the middle of nowhere like this?

178
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,248
For all sorts of reasons.
Just not mechanical.

179
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:45,152
- What?
- There ain't nothin' wrong with this.

180
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,850
Not that I can see, anyhow.

181
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:51,018
Whoo.
[ Chuckles ]

182
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:53,028
Well, there's a good one.

183
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:55,894
[ Grunts ]
Hold the bag open.

184
00:13:18,421 --> 00:13:20,412
This looks to be it.

185
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,190
[ Beeping ]

186
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,197
Locked.

187
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,962
Well, now, I'd say
that's like to be a very good sign.

188
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:42,133
[ Mal ]
Here.

189
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:46,536
Gen-seed, protein,
crop supplements.

190
00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:48,546
Everything a growing family needs...

191
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:51,549
to make a fresh start on a new world.

192
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:54,677
Hard subsidies for 14-plus families.

193
00:14:54,753 --> 00:14:57,187
- That's--
- About a fortune.

194
00:14:57,256 --> 00:14:59,690
Forget the rest.
We just take this stuff.

195
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:02,750
Gonna need a hand
hauling it out of here.

196
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:10,268
Sir, even on a lifeboat...

197
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,862
you'd think those who escaped
would find room for some of this.

198
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:18,376
[ Mal ]
Nobody escaped.

199
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:20,275
[ Zoe ]
Sir?

200
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:24,708
Nobody.

201
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:32,581
My God.

202
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:34,649
[ Speaks Chinese ]

203
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:38,095
I know what did this.

204
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:40,427
Get her out of here.
Jayne?

205
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:43,730
[ Mal ] Jayne, drop what you're doing
and get to the engine room.

206
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:46,896
Take Kaylee and the doctor
off this boat. Don't ask questions.

207
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,874
[ Yelling ]

208
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:51,739
[ Mal On Radio ]
Jayne?

209
00:15:57,115 --> 00:15:59,049
Captain?

210
00:15:59,117 --> 00:16:01,210
Captain.

211
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:03,220
Zoe!

212
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,882
Came from above, sir.

213
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,222
The galley.

214
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:10,591
- What?
-[ Kaylee ] We heard shootin'.

215
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:12,562
River, what are you--

216
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:14,622
I followed the voices.

217
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,635
- Don't ever leave the ship. Not ever.
- Handle her, will you, son?

218
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:20,672
- [ Wash On Radio ]
What in the [ Chinese ] is going on?
- Not now, dear.

219
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:38,687
What'd you see?

220
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:40,691
[ Panting ]
Didn't.

221
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,250
Came at me from behind.
Big, though.

222
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:45,523
Strong.

223
00:16:45,597 --> 00:16:47,997
- I think I might have hit him.
- You did.

224
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:08,781
[ Man ]
No. No, no.

225
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:11,152
[ Mal ]
Shh. Easy, now.

226
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,392
No one's gonna hurt you.

227
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,123
- No. No mercy. No.
- Any more than we already did.

228
00:17:19,197 --> 00:17:21,495
- No mercy.
- We got lots of mercy.

229
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,558
We got lots and lots of--

[ Groans ]

231

[ Simon ]
Oh,yes.

232
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:40,718
He's a real beast.

233
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:43,050
It's a wonder you're still alive.

234
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:46,215
Looked bigger
when I couldn't see him.

235
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:51,661
I wonder how long
he'd been living like that.

236
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,664
Don't know.

237
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:57,327
He must be real brave to survive
like that when nobody else did.

238
00:17:57,402 --> 00:18:00,838
[ Sniffs ] Yeah. Real hero,
killin' all them people.

239
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:03,841
[ Kaylee ] What?
No, we don't believe that.

240
00:18:07,245 --> 00:18:09,213
We don't, do we?

241
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:11,943
Captain wouldn't have brought him
on board, were that the case.

242
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:14,008
[ Simon ]
Pulse is rapid.

243
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:17,214
Blood pressure's high side of normal--
to be expected.

244
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:20,850
Weak. They were all weak.

245
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:24,623
Other than the bullet wound, there
doesn't appear to be any exterior trauma.

246
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:27,688
Though that crack to the head you gave
him probably didn't do him any good.

247
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:30,701
[ Grunts, Panting ]
Cattle.

248
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:33,294
Cattle for the slaughter.

249
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:37,200
Dope him.

250
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:39,539
- I don't think that--
- Just do it.

251
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:42,842
No mercy. No resistance.

252
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,954
[ Groans ]

253
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:52,217
- [ Grunting ]
- [ Needle Gun Hisses ]

254
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,920
Open up.
See what's inside.

[ Panting ]

256
00:19:04,803 --> 00:19:06,794
[ Whispers ]
No mercy.

257
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,004
So? How's our patient?

258
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,514
Uh, aside from
borderline malnutrition...

259
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:19,516
he's in remarkably good health.

260
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,313
So he'll live, then?

261
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:23,946
Which, to my mind, is unfortunate.

262
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:26,115
Not a very charitable
attitude, Captain.

263
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:29,092
- Charity'd be putting a bullet in his brainpan.
- Mal!

264
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:31,425
It'd save him the suffering.

265
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,658
All right. No one goes in here.

266
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:39,465
Nothing more we can do for him,
not after what he's seen.

267
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,235
- What do you mean?
- That ship was hit by reavers.

268
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:48,646
- Reavers?
- [ Speaks Chinese ]

269
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:55,244
[ Inara ]
Mal, how can you know?

270
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,948
[Jayne ]
He don't, that's how. No way.

271
00:19:59,124 --> 00:20:01,888
It was that other fella,
the one we run into.

272
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,897
Like I said before, he went stir crazy,
killed the rest, then took a walk in space.

273
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:10,401
- Just a second ago, you said--
- Don't matter what I said.

274
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:12,528
Wasn't reavers.
Reavers don't leave no survivors.

275
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:14,731
Strictly speaking,
I wouldn't say they did.

276
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:16,706
What are you suggesting?

277
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:19,505
Don't matter we took him
off that boat, Shepherd.

278
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:22,513
It's the place he's gonna live
from now on.

279
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:24,947
I don't accept that.

280
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,951
Whatever horror he witnessed,
whatever acts of barbarism...

281
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,681
it was done by men,
nothing more.

282
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:34,317
- Reavers ain't men.
- Of course they are.

283
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:38,658
Too long removed from civilization,
perhaps, but men.

284
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,858
And I believe there's a power
greater than men.

285
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:44,527
A power that heals.

286
00:20:44,603 --> 00:20:47,071
Reavers might take issue
with that philosophy...

287
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:49,073
if they had a philosophy...

288
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:53,077
and if they weren't too busy
gnawing on your insides.

289
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:56,376
Jayne's right.
Reavers ain't men.

290
00:20:56,448 --> 00:20:59,747
Or they forgot how to be.
Come to just nothin'.

291
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:02,753
They got out to the edge of the galaxy,
to that place of nothin'...

292
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,755
and that's what they became.

293
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:08,224
Why are we still sittin' here?
If it was reavers, shouldn't we be gone?

294
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:12,127
Work ain't done. Still substantial
money value sittin' over there.

295
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:15,132
Oh, I ain't goin' over there
with them bodies.

296
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,033
No ruttin' way.
Not if reavers messed with 'em.

297
00:21:18,103 --> 00:21:20,264
Jayne, you'll scare the women.

298
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:24,274
[ Simon ]
I'll go.

299
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:27,470
- I've dealt with bodies. They don't worry me.
- I'd like to go with him.

300
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:31,414
Maybe see what I can do
about putting those folks to rest.

301
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:34,543
Those folks are already restin' pretty
good, Shepherd. Reavers saw to that.

302
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:38,214
How we treat our dead
is part of what makes us different...

303
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,451
than those did the slaughtering.

304
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:47,721
All right.
You go say your words.

305
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,996
Jayne, you'll help the doctor
and Shepherd Book cut down those people.

306
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:54,038
- Then you'll load up the cargo.
- I don't believe this.

307
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,767
We're sittin' put for a funeral?

308
00:21:56,842 --> 00:21:58,537
Yes, Jayne, that is exactly
what we're gonna do.

309
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,773
Not gonna have these people lookin'
over my shoulder once we're gone.

310
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:04,111
I ain't sayin'
there's any peace to be had...

311
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:09,518
but on the off chance there is,
those folks deserve a little of it.

312
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:17,495
Just when I think
I've got you figured out.

313
00:22:24,002 --> 00:22:26,869
That was real pretty, Captain,
what you just said.

314
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:29,873
Didn't think you were one
for rituals and such.

315
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:33,377
I'm not. But I figure it'll keep
the others busy for a while.

316
00:22:33,445 --> 00:22:36,039
No reason to concern them
with what's to be done.

317
00:22:36,114 --> 00:22:37,249
Sir?

318

Sir?

319
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:42,384
[ Mal ] It's a real burden
being right so often.

320
00:22:42,454 --> 00:22:44,388
- What is that?
- Booby trap.

321
00:22:44,456 --> 00:22:46,720
Reavers sometimes leave 'em
for the rescue ships.

322
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:49,692
- Triggered it when we latched on.
- And when we detach?

323
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:51,524
It blows.

324
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:54,827
Okay, so we don't detach.
We just, I don't know, sit tight until--

325
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,494
What, reavers come back?

326
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:00,868
Looks like they've jerry-rigged it
with a pressure catch.

327
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:03,908
It's the only thing that'd work
with all these spare parts.

328
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:07,069
We could probably bypass that easy,
we get to the D.C. line.

329
00:23:07,145 --> 00:23:09,875
You tell me right now, little Kaylee.
You really think you can do this?

330
00:23:09,948 --> 00:23:11,677
Sure. Yeah.

331
00:23:12,984 --> 00:23:15,179
I think so.

332
00:23:15,253 --> 00:23:19,849
Besides, if I mess up, it's not like
you'll be able to yell at me.

Well, right at this particular moment,
I have to say, not a thing.

343
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:27,610
- Right?
- [ Kaylee ] Not a gorram thing.

344
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:29,619
Looked like a thing to me.

Thought we might have had a situation,
but it looks to be taken care of.

No, no, don't you say that.
It's the reavers.

- The gorram reavers come back.
- Get that stuff stored.

you are ordered to release

Prepare to dock

[ Crew Member ]
Initiate molecular run.

No mandatory registration markings
on the bow.

360

Make sure we cite them for that.

00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:45,720
Sir, we've identified the transport ship
they were attached to.

362
00:26:45,797 --> 00:26:48,857
It was licensed to a group of families
out of Bernadette.

363
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:52,528
They were due to touch down in Newhall
three weeks ago. Never made it.

364

Once we secure these vultures,
we'll send a team over, check it out.

Sir, didn't we have a flag
on a Firefly a while back?

Oh, here it is.

An alert issued
on an unidentified Firefly-class...

00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:10,485
believed to be carrying two fugitives--
a brother and sister.

What are they wanted for?

It's not available.
It's classified.

372

Forty thousand of these old wrecks
in the air, and that's all they give us.

00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,927
Well, I'm not about to have
any surprises on a routine check.

we shoot first.

Brass can sort it out later.

00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,337
- So what was it?
- Open the stash, pull out the goods.

00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,005
- I just got done putting it in.
- Now I'm telling you take it out again.

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,345
- Why for?
- I got no notion to argue this.

No.

- Can't. They're pulling us in.

382
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:52,693
If they find us, they'll send River back
to that place to be tortured.

I'd never see her again.

Stack everything in plain sight. Wouldn't want
it to seem like we got anything to hide.

00:27:59,103 --> 00:28:01,503
Might give them Alliance boys
the wrong impression.

- What?

Why? Are you gonna put her
in plain sight too?

Don't get touchy.
Just do as I say.

390
00:28:16,054 --> 00:28:19,387
Is that why you let us stay, so you
could use us as bargaining chips?

- You are not giving her to them.

I'd think we were dangerous.

- It is. Bought and paid for.
I'm Captain Malcolm Reynolds.

00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:03,824
- And is this everyone, Captain?
- By way of crew, it is.

398
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:07,393
Though in our infirmary,you're gonna find
a fella we rescued off that derelict.

00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:09,099
Saved him, guess you could say.

Straight to the back,
next to the common area.

And these items,
you rescued them as well?

[ Man Cackling ]

Looks to me like
an illegal salvage operation.

00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,060
It does? That's discouraging.

406
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:40,297
Alliance property too.
You could lose your ship.

407
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:44,137
But that is a wrist slap compared
to the penalty for harboring fugitives.

408
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:47,974
A brother and sister. When I search
this vessel, I won't find them, will I?

409
00:29:48,046 --> 00:29:49,877
No children on this boat.

410
00:29:49,947 --> 00:29:53,041
Mmm. I didn't say children.

411
00:29:53,117 --> 00:29:56,211
Siblings. Adult siblings.

412
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:58,847
- I misunderstood.
- Mmm.

413
00:30:01,526 --> 00:30:03,960
No chance
they could have stowed away?

414
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:05,962
No one would blame you
for that, Captain.

415
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:10,626
I know how these older-model Fireflies
tend to have those troublesome little nooks.

416
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:12,795
Do they?

417
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,931
Smugglers and the like tend to
prefer them just for that reason.

We will continue this conversation
in a more official capacity.

00:30:31,155 --> 00:30:33,248
I want every inch
of this junker tossed.

- "Junker"?
- Settle down, Kaylee.

422
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:39,262
But, Captain, did you hear
what that purple-belly called Serenity?

423
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,321

Shut up.

[ Man ]
Get him outta here.

425
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,490
- [ Commander ] You are a Companion.
- [ Inara ] Yes.

426
00:31:02,623 --> 00:31:05,183
And you were based for years
on Sihnon.

427
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:08,194
It's only in the last year that you've
been shipping out with The Serenity?

428
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:10,196
It's just Serenity,
and that's correct.

429
00:31:10,264 --> 00:31:13,358
In a few weeks
it will be a year.

430
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:16,699
- Why is this important?
- I'm just trying to put the pieces together.

431
00:31:16,771 --> 00:31:19,865
It's a, uh-- It's a curiosity...

00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:22,501
a woman of stature
such as yourself...

433
00:31:22,577 --> 00:31:24,374
falling in with... these types.

434
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:28,939
Not in the least. It's a mutually
beneficial business arrangement.

435
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:32,884
I rent the shuttle from Capt. Reynolds,
which allows me to expand my client base...

436
00:31:32,954 --> 00:31:36,720
and the captain finds that
having a Companion on board...

437
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39,851
opens certain doors that might
otherwise be closed to him.

438
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:43,590
- And do you love him?
- I don't see how that's relevant.

439
00:31:43,664 --> 00:31:46,132
- Well, he is your husband.
- Yes.

440
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:49,426
You two met
through Capt. Reynolds?

441
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,439
Captain was looking for a pilot.
I found a husband.

442
00:31:52,507 --> 00:31:54,202
Seemed to work out.

443
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:57,244
- You fought with Reynolds in the war?
- Fought with a lot of people.

444
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:59,609
- And your husband.
- Fight with him sometimes too.

445
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:04,814
Is there any particular reason
you don't wish to discuss your marriage?

446
00:32:04,886 --> 00:32:08,583
Don't see that it's
any of your business is all.

447
00:32:08,656 --> 00:32:10,590
We're very private people.

448
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:12,387

The legs.

00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,258
[ Chuckling ] Oh, yeah.
Definitely have to say it was her legs.

450
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:17,820
You can put that down.

451
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:22,427
Her legs, and right where her legs meet
her back. Actually, that whole area.

452
00:32:22,503 --> 00:32:24,971
That, and above it.

453
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,403
Six gerstlers crammed
under every cooling drive...

454
00:32:29,477 --> 00:32:31,968
so that you strain
your primary artery function...

455
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:35,413
and you end up having to recycle secondary
exhaust through a bypass system...

456
00:32:35,483 --> 00:32:38,748
just so's you don't end up pumping it
through the main atmofeed...

457
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:40,810
and asphyxiating the entire crew.

458
00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:42,617
Now, that's junk.

459
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,284
Have you seen what she wears?
Forget about it.

460

Have you ever been
with a warrior woman?

461
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:03,543
Pirates.

462
00:33:03,611 --> 00:33:06,102
Pirates with their own chaplain.

463
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,808
There's an oddity.

464
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:11,647
Not the only oddity
this end of space, Commander...

as on the central planets.

466
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,115
Rules can be a mite fuzzier.

467
00:33:18,192 --> 00:33:21,992
These fugitives that we're looking for--
the brother and the sister.

468
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:25,863
- They were last seen on Persephone.
- That a fact?

469
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:28,868
They also left port aboard
a Firefly-class transport...

470
00:33:28,936 --> 00:33:32,064
just about the same time
that you shipped out with Serenity.

471
00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:35,575
Well, Persephone's a big place.

472
00:33:35,643 --> 00:33:39,340
Yes. Yes, it is.
And that Firefly isn't.

473
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:41,904
And if anyone's hiding
anywhere on it...

474
00:33:41,983 --> 00:33:44,474
we will find them.

475
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:10,465
So, I figure by now you been over
to the derelict, seen for yourself.

476
00:35:10,538 --> 00:35:12,802
Yes. Terrible thing.

477
00:35:14,675 --> 00:35:17,610
If you want my advice,
you won't tow it back.

478
00:35:17,678 --> 00:35:21,136
Just fire the whole gorram thing
from space, be done with it.

479
00:35:21,215 --> 00:35:24,776
That ship is evidence. I'm not in
the habit of destroying evidence.

480
00:35:24,852 --> 00:35:27,582
Course not.
Be against the rules.

481
00:35:28,856 --> 00:35:30,790
I'm gonna make a leap here...

482
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:33,759
and figure this is your first tour
out here on the border.

483
00:35:35,596 --> 00:35:38,588
[ Sniffs ] It's a very loyal crew
you have there.

484
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,634
But then, I can tell by your record...

485
00:35:41,702 --> 00:35:47,140
you have a-- a tendency to inspire
that quality in people... Sergeant.

486
00:35:48,743 --> 00:35:52,042
It's not sergeant.
Not anymore. War's over.

487
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:54,775
For some, the war'll never be over.

488
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:56,783
I notice your ship's called Serenity.

489
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:59,786
You were stationed on Hara
at the end of the war.

490
00:35:59,854 --> 00:36:03,221
Battle of Serenity Valley
took place there, if I recall.

491
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,224
I believe you might be right.

492
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:07,556
Independents suffered
a pretty crushing defeat there.

493
00:36:07,628 --> 00:36:10,358
Some say that after Serenity
the browncoats were through...

494
00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:12,160
that the war ended in that valley.

495
00:36:12,233 --> 00:36:14,292
Hmm.

496
00:36:14,368 --> 00:36:18,065
Seems odd you'd name your ship after
a battle you were on the wrong side of.

497
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:22,337
May have been the losing side.
Still not convinced it was the wrong one.

498
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,144
Is that why you attacked
that transport?

499
00:36:28,215 --> 00:36:31,207
- What?
- You're still fighting the same battle.

500
00:36:31,285 --> 00:36:33,651
Only those weren't soldiers
you murdered.

501
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:36,212
They were civilians, families,
citizens loyal to the Alliance...

and you just can't stand that, can you?

503
00:36:39,226 --> 00:36:42,161
So we attacked that ship, then brought
the only survivor to our infirmary.

504
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:44,094
Is that what we did?

505
00:36:44,165 --> 00:36:46,099
I'd ask him...

with his tongue split down the middle.

to be concerned about right now.

- The darkness.

He probably tried to turn away.
They wouldn't let him.

You call him a survivor.
He's not.

that kind of will...

the only way to deal with it,
I suspect, is to become it.

He's following
the only course left to him.

536
