KATNISS: (WHISPERING) Start simple.

2
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,965
Start with what you know is true.

3
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,047
My name is Katniss Everdeen.
My home is District 12.

4
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,371
I was in the Hunger Games.
I escaped.

00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,567
(CRYING) Peeta... Peeta was left behind.

00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,526
You can't be in here.

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,442
I had a nightmare.
Just five more minutes.

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,361
WOMAN: You need to sleep.
We can help you sleep.

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,290
Just five more minutes.

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,161
(SOFTLY) No.

13

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,244
No, please, don't.
It's just five more...

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,689
Don't touch me! Don't!
No! No! Get off of me!

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,850

19

I wanted to go back
for Peeta and Johanna,

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,363
but I, uh...

21
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,442
I couldn't move.

22
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,123
They have Annie, too.
They took her.

23
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,446
She's, uh... (SNIFFLING)

24
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,800
She's in the Capitol.

25
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,764
I wish she was dead.

26
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,084
I wish they were all
dead and we were, too.

27
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,325
Miss Everdeen.

28
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,484
Colonel Boggs,
District 13's head of security.

29
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,451
I know you've been discharged,

30
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,841
but President Coin's
requested to meet with you first.

31
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,883
Is there any news?

32
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,928
BOGGS: I'm just here to escort you.

33
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,890
We were always told
there was nothing left of 13.

34
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,561
BOGGS: Capitol bombed
the surface to rubble.

35
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,003
But we're military,
so we learned to survive down here.

36
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,604
Preparing, training.

37
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,484
The war never stopped for us.

PLUTARCH: There she is.

39
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,170
Our Girl on Fire.

40
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,046
Madam President,
may I present you with The Mockingjay.

41
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,527
What an honor it is to meet you.

42
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,685
You're a courageous young woman.

43
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,400
I know how disorienting this must be.

44
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,327
And I can't imagine
what it's like to live through
the atrocities of those Games.

45
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,606
Katniss,

46
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,444
President Alma Coin.

47
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,290
Please know how welcome you are.

48
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,007
I hope you'll find
some comfort with us.

49
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,487
We've known loss in 13, too.

50
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,529
PLUTARCH: This is history.
Right here at this table.

51
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,720
PRESIDENT COIN: I apologize.

52
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,960
I wish you had more time to recover,
but unfortunately,
we don't have that luxury.

53
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,485
Please, have a seat.

54
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,251
Are you aware of what's happened?

55
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,285
When you fired your
arrow at the force field

56
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,328
you electrified the nation.

57
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,242
There have been riots and uprisings
and strikes in seven districts.

58
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,085
We believe that if we keep
this energy going we can unify
the districts against the Capitol.

59
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,050
But if we don't, if we let it dissipate,

60
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,124
we could be waiting
another 75 years for this opportunity.

61
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,202
Everyone in 13 is ready for this.

62
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,089
What about Peeta?
Is he alive?

63
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,130
I don't know.
And I wish that I did.

64
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,248
But there's no way for me to contact
my operatives inside the Capitol.

65
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,126
BEETEE: The Capitol has always suppressed
communication between the districts.

66
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,488
But I know their system very well.

67
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,846
I managed to break through.

68
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,401
All we need now is
the perfect message.

69
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,721
PLUTARCH: Katniss,
here's what we need to do.

70
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,485
We need to show them
that The Mockingjay's alive and well

71
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,325
and willing to stand up
and join this fight.

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,483
'Cause we need every district
to stand up to this Capitol.

73
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,164
The way you did.

74
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,927
So we're gonna
shoot a series of propaganda clips,

75
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,884
propos, I like to call them,

76
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,371
on The Mockingjay.

77
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,283
Spreads the word

78
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,091
that we're gonna
stoke the fire of this rebellion.

79
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,970
The fire that The Mockingjay started.

80
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,202
(SOFTLY) You left him there.

81
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,411
- You left Peeta in that arena to die.
- Katniss, there are so many...

82
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,289
Peeta was the one
who was supposed to live.

83
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,407
Miss Everdeen.

84
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,330
This revolution is about everyone.

85
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,243
It's about all of us.

86
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,130
And we need a voice.

87
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,521
Then you should've saved Peeta.

88
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,883
Maybe you should have
rescued the boy instead.

89
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,680
Oh, no.

90
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,530
No, listen to me.
No one else can do this but her.

91
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,728
This is not the girl you described.

92
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,844
Obviously, we need to make it personal.

93
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,490
Remind her who the real enemy is.

94
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,403
She knows who the enemy is.
That's not the issue.

95
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,403
Unless she's forgotten.

96
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,131
There's explaining and there's showing.

97
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,526
Let her see what
the Capitol did to 12.

98
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,685
She can't handle it.
The Games destroyed her.

99
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,401
This is the only choice you have.

100
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,128
People don't always show up
the way you want them to, Madam President.

101
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,331
But that anger, that anger-driven
defiance, that's what we want.
And we can redirect it.

102
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,369
We need to unite
these people out there

103
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,050
that have been doing nothing
but killing each other

104
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,565
in an arena for years.

105
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,361
We have to have a lightning rod.

106
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,728
They'll follow her.
She's the face of the revolution.

107
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,723
Let her see it.
Let her go home.

108
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,846
Send her.

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,041
or you will find another Mockingjay.

317
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,851
That's it. That's her.
Right there.

318
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,483
Isn't that who I promised you?

319
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,449
She wears the costume.

320
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,205
Gunfire in the background.
A hint of smoke.

321
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,850
Our Mockingjay.

322
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,766
Madam President, we're losing ground,
because the people are losing heart.

323
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,001
This is worth the risk.

324
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,844
She's worth the risk.

325
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,366
Pardons, tribunals.
Power of the people.

326
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,966
It can all be the bedrock
of the new Panem, but,

327
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,687
in wartime I think even
the noblest of causes
can be bent a little bit. Right?

328
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,766
Do you have any other conditions?

329
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,481
My sister gets to keep her cat.

330
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,647
EFFIE: Go away.

331
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,130
(EFFIE SIGHING)

332
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,802
Is it visiting hours again?

333
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,805
Miss Trinket,

334
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,844
you see this door.

335
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,806
It opens.
From the inside.

336
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,808
I've told you, these are the standard
living quarters. Same as everyone.

337
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,691
You're not a prisoner.
You're free to join the rest of 13.

338
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,246
Not looking like this.
Thank you very much.

339
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,403
We have a bigger issue
than wardrobe, Miss Trinket.

340
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,209
Katniss has agreed
to be The Mockingjay.

341
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,691
(SIGHING) That poor thing.

342
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,411
And your Girl on
Fire is burnt out.

343
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,767
I need you to
join this team now.

344
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,043
I need someone she trusts.

345
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,724
What about Haymitch?

346
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,650
He's drying out in
some facility a mile down.

347
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,321
Aiding rebels is
not really my forte.

348
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,803
Miss Trinket, your days
in the Capitol are over,

349
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,248
no matter what happens here.

350
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,924
If you wanna play
a prisoner of war, fine.

351
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,604
Stay here and rot.

352
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,961
I'll find someone else
to be The Mockingjay's escort.

353
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,281
Who?

354
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,925
(SCOFFS) Anyone can be replaced.

355
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,044
Not your Mockingjay.

356
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,721
There isn't a soul in this dungeon
who knows the first thing about Katniss.

357
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,931
You honestly believe
one of these cave dwellers

358
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,002
is going to take my place?

359
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,166
No.

360
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,725
Good afternoon.

361
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,721
Thank you for interrupting your schedules.

362
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,922
<i>They have already
been adjusted to compensate for the delay.</i>

363
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,640
I hardly ever see children around here.

364
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,808
<i>Please, check in with your unit supervisors
when you resume work.</i>

365
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,645
A lot of them were
lost in an epidemic a few years ago.

366
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,006
<i>I have an announcement
for the citizens of 13.</i>

367
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,570
Coin lost her family, too.

368
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,565
Daughter and a husband.

369
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,007
<i>And our welcome guests from 12.</i>

370
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,325
Katniss Everdeen has consented
to be the face of our cause

371
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,169
to help unite the districts
against the Capitol.

372
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,126
In exchange, I have promised
several concessions.

373
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,682
First, we'll assess all opportunities
for the extraction of the Victors

374
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,442
held hostage in the Capitol.

375
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,761
Peeta Mellark...

376
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,285
(CLAMORING)

377
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,525
Johanna Mason...

378
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,531
Finnick, I made the deal for Annie, too.

379
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,489
...and Annie Cresta.

380
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,966
Once freed,

381
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,964
they will be granted full pardon
for any and all crimes

382
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,451
committed against the rebel cause.

383
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,971
(ALL SHOUTING DISAGREEMENT)

384
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,081
Good.

385
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,484
That's good, Katniss.

386
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,485
If Katniss Everdeen fails
to fulfill her duties

387
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,644
the deal will be off.

388
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,729
Thank you for your attention.

389
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,326
Please, resume your daily schedules.

390
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,247
PLUTARCH: Madam President.

391
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,526
Effie Trinket.

392
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,171
Welcome to 13.

393
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,484
PLUTARCH: Madam President,
may I say you are so very

394
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,890
- concise.
- EFFIE: Mmm.

395
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,210
You believe that
there's more to be said?

396
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,881
May I speak freely?

397
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,849
You don't appear to
do anything else.

398
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,211
I'm only talking about salesmanship.

399
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,208
The thing with revolutions,
they're a tender flame.

400
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,169
They need to be nurtured
with a little kindling

401
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,561
and warmth.

402
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,241
Bit of oxygen.

403
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,685
Oxygen.

404
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,846
One sure way to put
it out is to smother it.

405
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,605
Or to use up all
the air in the room.

406
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,045
Excuse me.

407
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,321
You know what could use
a revolution? That hair.

408
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,801
KATNISS: Effie?

409
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,361
Oh!

410
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,005
What are you doing here?

411
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,651
I'm a political refugee.

412
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,811
Plutarch rescued you?

413
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,042
Rescued, yes, that's what he calls it.

414
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,206
You and I were both in the dark.

415
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,046
Now I'm condemned
to this life of jumpsuits.

416
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,401
It is wonderful to see you again.

417
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,808
Can you believe this place?

418
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,804
I miss coffee.

419
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,971
I never knew anyplace
could be so strict.

420
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,329
I mean, I thought at least
in the higher ranks there'd be some

421
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,930
side action.

422
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,243
I miss my wigs.

423
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,322
Luckily, I remembered
that this was all the rage

424
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,004
when I was coming up.

425
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,163
You know, everything old
can be made new again.

426
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,850
Like democracy.

427
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,489
Which brings me to this.

00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,210
KATNISS: Cinna.

430
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,409
He's dead, isn't he?

431
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,005
Yes, dear.

432
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,686
He made Plutarch promise
not to show you this

433
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,650
until you'd decided
to be The Mockingjay on your own.

434
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,363
He knew the risks.
As we all do.

435
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,291
He believed in this revolution.

436
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,884
He believed in you.

437
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,644
They're beautiful.

438
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,405
They have it.

439
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,281
They have the Mockingjay outfit.

440
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,441
There's not much of
a prep team here in 13

Katniss. (SIGHING)

1122

We're gonna do this,
just like District 8.

1123
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,562
Tell me about the roses.

1124
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:42,128
Tell Snow 13 is alive and well.

1125
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,805
He's gonna kill Peeta.

CRESSIDA: Let's try again.
Can you speak up?

1127
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,651
We don't have a mic on you.

1128
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,521
"13 is alive and well and so am l."

1129

1135
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,484

He's never gonna stop.

1137
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,080
Cressida, we should cut the cameras.

1138

- It's okay, Katniss.

1139

No. He warned me.
He warned me about this.

1140
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:26,004
He's doing this because
I'm The Mockingjay.

1141
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,560
He's punishing Peeta to punish me.

1142

No.

1143
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,686

I s'pose you're
just gonna hide down here forever?

1154
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,847
I can't be The Mockingjay.

1155
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,409
Not The Mockingjay.
Just Katniss.

1156
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:19,568
You know, you're the only
real friend I have down here.

(STAMMERING)

I don't suppose they gave you
any kind of medication?

1159
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,881
You're unbelievable.

1160
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,406
Okay, but I meant what I said. (SIGHING)

1161
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:36,488
Look, the reason I'm here
is to let you know

they're rescuing Peeta.

1163

What?

1164
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:45,121
The dam went down in District 5,
took out most of the power to the Capitol.

1165
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,123
Knocked out their signal defense.

1166
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:51,370
Beetee's inside their system now,
wreaking all kinds of havoc.

1167
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,280
A window is open to us.

1168
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,521
How much longer?
I don't know.

1169
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,291
I guess until the Capitol
can get the power back on.

1170
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,600
And President Coin?

1171
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,729
You know, I can never
fully support that woman

1172
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:06,840
in light of the prohibition
they have going on around this place,

1173
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,611
but Plutarch got word

1174
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:12,286
that Peeta and the others
are in the Tribute Center.

1175
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:15,683
And with the power out,
Coin sees this as an opportunity.

1176
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,530
She knows that Peeta

1177
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,001
is the Capitol's weapon.
The same way you're ours.

1178
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:23,562
And as opposed to having you two
pointing at each other,

1179
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:25,644
she's going to get him.

1180
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,521
I have to go help.

1181
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,602
(CHUCKLING) Hey, hey, whoa, kiddo.
Wait.

1182
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,888
Come on. What, are you just
gonna jump outta the vent

1183
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,246
and go storm the Capitol?

1184
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,448
Besides, it's already underway.

1185
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,409
Six soldiers went in.
Volunteer only.

1186
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:43,042
And guess who was
the first brave soul to sign up.

1187
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,131
Gale.

1188
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,524
- Okay, Finnick?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1189
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:00,806
Go in the center there.

01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,487
Yeah.

It's a lot more than that.

1205
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:46,328
Beetee's commandeered the system.

1206

Now that they're down to generator power

1207
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,402
there's a more limited
range of frequencies available to them.

1208
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,369
And I'm filling them all up with Finnick.

Not many will see it,
but whoever does

1210
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,400
will think it's another propo.

1425
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,202
Let go! (GRUNTING)

1426
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,363
(MONITOR BEEPING)

1427
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,411
(GASPING)

1428
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,687
No, Katniss.
No, you're swollen. Don't touch.

1429
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,565
No, no, no.
Calm down.

1430
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,250
Calm down.
You're okay.

1431
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:57,685
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

1432
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:58,966
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

1433
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:00,611
Tell her she's awake.

1434
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:04,690
- Don't try to talk.
- (STAMMERING)

1435
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:06,285
Peeta's okay.
I promise.

1436
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,965
I just had to get him off you.

1437
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:11,521
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1438
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:18,042
It's called hijacking.

1439
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:22,284
We don't know how long
the Capitol's been doing this to Peeta.

1440
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,770
It's fear conditioning.

1441
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:26,808
Enhanced with tracker jacker venom.

1442
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,602
You were stung your first Games.
Remember?

1443
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,689
The venom puts the subject
in a dissociative state.

1444
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,602
And they torture him.

1445
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:41,681
With shocks and beatings,
and strip down his identity.

1446
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,650
And then all of that
suffering and fear is redirected.

1447
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,327
Associated with other
memories or a person.

1448
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,444
They can change
his memories of Katniss?

1449
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,320
To make her seem
life-threatening.

1450
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,082
HAYMITCH: They turned him
into a weapon, Katniss.

1451
01:46:58,160 --> 01:46:59,491
To kill you.

1452
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:01,961
But you can reverse it?

1453
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,080
The fear is the most
difficult thing to overcome.

1454
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:06,885
We're hardwired to remember fear best.

1455
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,644
It's new terrain.

1456
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,842
But we've put together a team.

1457
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:14,842
I'm optimistic.

1458
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:22,281
(CROWD CHEERING)

1459
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,720
Good evening.

1460
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:45,724
Yesterday, I authorized

1461
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:48,963
a covert rescue mission
inside the Capitol.

1462
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,966
I am pleased to announce

1463
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:55,090
that the Victors have been liberated!

1464
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:05,651
<i>Let this day mark
an historic change.</i>

1465
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:10,002
<i>With The Mockingjay
and the Victors beside us,</i>

1466
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:13,527
<i>we have sent a clear
message to the Capitol.</i>

1467
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:17,401
That we will never
again endure injustice.

1468
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,404
(CHEERING)

1469
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:24,571
Today,

1470
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:28,008
a day on which we reunited family,

1471
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,926
friends, and loved ones.

1472
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:35,526
<i>Let all of Panem come together.</i>

1473
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:40,480
<i>Not to battle
for the amusement of the Capitol.</i>

1474
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:43,564
<i>But to join hands in this fight.</i>

1475
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,649
(CHEERING)

1476
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:53,126
Let today be
the day we promise

1477
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:56,921
never to give up,
never to give in

1478
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,004
until we have
made a new Panem,

1479
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:03,846
where leaders are elected,
not imposed upon us.

1480
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:06,568
And where the districts are free

1481
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:08,961
to share the fruits of their labors

1482
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,361
and not fight one another for scraps!

1483
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,563
(CROWD CHEERING)

1484
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,529
This new Panem is on the horizon.

1485
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,128
But we must take
it for ourselves.

1486
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:34,484
<i>The road there
leads through the sharp mountains</i>

1487
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,683
<i>and deep ravines of District 2.</i>

1488
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,842
<i>There in the heart</i>

1489
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,571
<i>of Panem's steepest
mountain range lies</i>

1490
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:45,849
the Capitol's principal military facility.

1491
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:49,241
<i>We can conquer this stronghold</i>

1492
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:52,724
because we are one people,

1493
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:56,607
one army, one voice.

1494
01:49:56,720 --> 01:50:01,248
<i>Because today is our new beginning.</i>

1495
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:05,525
Today we have freed the Victors.

1496
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:09,169
Tomorrow, Panem!

1497
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:21,604
ALL: (CHANTING) Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!

1498
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:25,524
(INAUDIBLE)

1499
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:28,042
(APPLAUSE)
