Oh, shit.
Darcy, you really
shouldn't have come.

9
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,690
Show me.

10
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,267
Site foreman: Corporate was
adamant. We keep running.

11
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,769
No stopping operations.

12
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,838
No, no, no.
You got to go through.
No cameras.

13
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,308
I don't even think
international laws
apply up here.

14
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,278
We are geologists first.

15
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,779
If this thing
has any historical
significance at all,

16
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:03,415
we are shutting down.
I'm shutting us down.

17
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,420
Oh, he's going
to shoot me?
Shoot me.

18
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,742
Site foreman:
Hey, don't kill her.

19
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,924
This is crazy stuff.

20
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:13,692
(Panting)

21
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,434
Crazy shit.

22
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,442
Well, what do you think?

23
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,545
I think history is
about to change.

28
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,884
oh, look who decided
to show up for work.

29
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,824
Lucas:

What, surf report no
good at South padre?

33
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,767
The waves are flat
and I got no gas.

34
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,935
You know that, cade.

35

(Pigs squealing)

36
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,373
Dude. Rude.

37
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,644
Look at these two junebugs.
Whoo! My, my!

38
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:40,512
Hey, you're paying
me on this one,
right, cade?

39
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,915
You know, Lucas, a lot
of guys are just happy
to have a job at all.

40
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,584
Yeah, I suppose.

41
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:46,718
You got any cash on you?
Yeah.

42
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
All right, good.

43
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,995
Hey, Lucas flannery.

44
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,800
Grandson: Place
has been in the family
since '28.

45
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,068
Granddaddy ran it all his life.

46
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,036
Ain't that right,
granddaddy?

47
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:07,873
Real soon he's going
to sign it over to me.

48
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,542
Grandfather: The movies
nowadays, that's the trouble.

49
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,911
Sequels and remakes,
bunch of crap.

50
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,314
I love that one. Oh.

51
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,882
He's deaf and senile.

52
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,950
Heard that.

53
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,752
Now these just need
some spit and Polish.

54
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,922
I believe they're digital,
possibly imax.

55
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,691
Yeah, they're not.
Mister, we'll have a look

56
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:26,958
around if you want to
leave us to it, okay?

57
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,628
You know, folks used to
come from Miles around

58
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,397
to see the dancing
girls with the big
cha-chas. (Laughs)

59
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,899
I swear to God

60
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,967
I am one diaper
change away from
poisoning his oatmeal.

61
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,536
Hey, you hang in there, buddy.

62
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:40,439
Then you tell this
kid to bring you
here every day.

63
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:41,873
Seven bucks,
I keep talking.

64
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,008
Sold.

65
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,042
(Chuckles)

66
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,979
Lucas: Remember this place
when we were kids?

67
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,221
How many girls you think you
brought here in high school?

68
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:54,953
I only remember one.

69
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:57,956
Hey, heads!

70
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,625
(Groaning)

71
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,595
Ow!

72
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,484
That's why you didn't
make the varsity team.

73
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,866
Ah.

74
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,802
All right. Go long.

75
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,004
(Crashing)

76
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,709
Leave it.

77
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,527
(Shells clattering)

78
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,934
Mortar shells?

79
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,436
What the hell happened to you?

80
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,440
Hey, snakeballs.
How much for the truck?

81
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,842
Truck?

82
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,011

(All laughing)

84
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,094
Two more weeks, girls,
till no more classes, ever.

85
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,696
Almost time to get
a tan and get wasted!

86
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,698
(All whooping)

87
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,060
Please, please.

88
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,096
(Sighs)

89
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,900
No financial aid. Great.

90
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,770
(Dog barking)

91
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,576
Yes, I know I'm home,
thank you.

<i>Intruder alert!
Back away from the premises!</i>

93

Voice recognition. It's me!
<i>I am dialing 911.</i>

94
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,717
Go right ahead.
I don't care.

95
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,520
<i>I'm still calling 911.</i>

96
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:09,855
Male reporter on TV:
<i>The battle of Chicago</i>
<i>was an event</i>

97
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:10,956
<i>that permanently
changed our world.</i>

98

Male reporter: <i> Much of</i>
<i>the city has been destroyed.</i>

99
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,094
Female reporter 2:
<i>Homeland security</i>
<i>is urging everyone</i>

100
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,576
<i>to report suspicious
alien activity.</i>

101

Female reporter 3:
<i>A swift act of congress put</i>
<i>an end to all joint operations</i>

102
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,206
<i>between the military and the
autobots, ending the alliance.</i>

103
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,908
Attinger:
<i>As this committee knows,</i>

104
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,077
<i>the invasion of Chicago
was a defining day</i>

105

<i>for our nation five years ago.</i>

106
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,947
The day millions
of people realized that

107
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,049
never again can we allow aliens

108
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,851
to fight our battles for us.

109
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,855
A handful of autobots

after joint-combat operations
were abolished.

111

Fewer than a dozen Decepticons

Timothy: <i> Hurry, let's get it</i>
<i>to my house, guys.</i>

115
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,735
As for the alien technology,

116
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,637
our objective remains to
keep it in American control.

117

This is my crew.</i>

ball turret in Chicago.</i>

<i>We just found it in the rubble
and it's all working...</i>

Attinger: Word has it
Japan, India,

121
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,048
the Israelis may have
gotten their hands on
a couple of ships.

122
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,918
Apparently the Russians
are starting a bidding war.

123
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,887
<i>We're taking $5,000 for it.
It's got 36 guns, alien shit.</i>

124
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,990
A new era has begun.

125
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,893
And the age
of the transformers is over.

126
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,583
Hey.

127
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,298
<i>Hey, I've been waiting for you.</i>

128

<i>You're looking hot today!</i>

129
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,290
Oh, yeah? How about

130
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:55,293
<i>You want me to take
my shirt off right now?</i>

131
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:58,029
<i>What the hell?
Hey, where you going?</i>

132
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,751
I cannot believe him.
I cannot believe this.

133
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,635
What the hell?

134
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,170
All the way!

135
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,841
(Sighs)

136
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,743
A truck?

137
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,379
Dad, please tell me
you didn't spend
our money on this.

138
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,947
Oh, no, don't worry,
he didn't. He spent my money.

139
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,248
A hundred and fifty bucks of it.

140
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,284
As an advance on
your regular paycheck.

141
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,126
What regular paycheck?
Which you will get back.

142
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,921
When?
Never. We're broke.

143
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,023
I knew it.

144
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,191
Sweetheart, could you
please not drive a wedge

145
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,826
between employer and employee.

146
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,894
Hold on.
I thought we were partners.

147
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,396
Look, I came up
short, okay? I had to
buy her a prom dress.

148
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,064
You want me to deny
her a prom dress?

149
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,200
You might as well.
You denied her a prom date.

150
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,002
No, I offered to take
her and chaperone.

151
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,103
Nobody wants to
go to the dance
with their dad.

152
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,371
It's weird.

153
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,905
It's not the issue.

154
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,674
Well, maybe it should be.

155
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,042
Hey, could you guys
just get off my case?

156
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,644
You know what the engine
on this runs for?

157
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:50,148
And sweetheart, your shorts
are shrinking by
the second, okay?

158
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,230
Cold water,
air dry, please.

159
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:54,886
I think she looks hot.

160
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,821
What did you say?

161
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,857
Like a hot teenager.

162
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:01,059
Oh, it's the "teenager"
thing that makes it better.
Thank you.

163
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,421
It didn't sound like
what it meant.

164
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,362
(Cade sighs)

165
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,001
Cade: That goes by
the circuit boards.
(Lucas sighs)

166
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,403
Put the zeiss lenses over there.

167
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,340
Dad, please. You can't keep
spending money on junk

168
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,375
just so you can turn
it into different junk.

169
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,878
We do not use
the "j" word in here.

170
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,980
That is a super simplex
theater projector.
It's very rare.

171
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,848
What about the smilepilot?

172
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,383
Or the exer-mower

173
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,052
that I invented?
Simply ahead
of their time.

174
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,154
Yeah, like the alleged
guard-dawg.

175
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,122
(Barking)

176
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,204
You're gonna get him upset.

177
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,826
Hey, cade! Cade!

178
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,861
This thing still work?

179
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,063
No!
Yes.

180
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,330
Yes, and still groundbreaking.

181
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,465
Go back there and
lay on the recliner

182
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,000
and just wait for a cold one.

183
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,473
Cade: Dude,
stop breaking stuff.

184
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,142
Final notice,
late notice, past due.

185
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:53,912
Lucas: Come on, come on.

186
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,282
Bring daddy the alcohol.
Come on.

187
00:11:57,284 --> 00:12:00,018
I mean, what is all this
crap people send you?

188
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,740
That's a discman
and that's an 8-track tape.

189
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,089
Music.
Never heard of it.

190
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,426
Look, I fix that,
it's 100 bucks.
I fix that, it's $250.

191
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,861
If I would have been
able to fix that

192
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,029
before you broke it even more,

193
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,297
it would have been 20 bucks.

194
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:16,067
College, as long
as you land one
of those scholarships.

195
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,189
What's the estimated
time of arrival, usually?
Average?

196
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,408
Wait. So it just brings
the beer near you?

197
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,076
That's the trick?

198
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,245
It's got a couple
kinks, man.
Lucas: Yeah.

199
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,313
Dad, you think maybe some things

200
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,181
should never be invented?

201
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,349
No, I don't.
That's backwards thinking.

202
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,751
This is a temple of technology.

203
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,219
You guys are standing
in a holy place.

204
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,154
(Laughing)
What do you think?

205
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,189
Why don't you look
at all of this?

206
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,391
This could be yours.
What about this land?

207
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:43,161
Purple people eater's
back and she looks hungry.

208
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,130
Isn't this incredible?

209
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,264
I knew you
would like it.
Cade: Hey, you!

210
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,365
Hey.

211
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,935
I own this house!
It's not for sale!

212
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,037
Six months late
on payments, Mr. yeager.

213
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,073
And I see you stealing
power at the pole.

214
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,775
Cade: Hey, that's
not your concern.

215
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:57,509
Sir, do you wanna
see the property?

216
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,210
Sure.

217
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:03,348
Then I'll crack your head
open like an egg!

218
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,983
Whoa! Whoa!
Stay back! He's crazy.

219
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,451
I told you don't
come back here anymore.

220
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,420
Don't you start with me.
Why don't you
do it yourself?

221
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:10,355
And I'll bring the police
when I come, too!

222
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,489
My brother ain't no joke!

223
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,224
Who, Jerry?

224
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,492
You bring his big ass up here,

225
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,094
he's gonna be
huffing and puffing

226
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,061
before he can squeeze
out of that car!

227
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,296
You back out on my grass,

228
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,498
you're gonna be in big trouble!

229
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,199
You tell Jerry to come see me.

230
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,433
I'll give him some pecan pie.

231
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,003
Hey!

232
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,274
(Groans) She smashed
through the fence?

233
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,578
Cade, relax.
You're going to have
an aortic infarction.

234
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,113
What is that?

235
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,548
I think it's a brain
heart attack.

236
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,349
Yeah, I've had one already.

237
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:41,085
No, we're borrowing it
from the neighbors.

238
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,454
Great. That's awesome.

239
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,056
Once I graduate and I'm gone,

240
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,124
who's gonna take care of you?

241
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,192
Oh, you take care of me?

242
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:50,295
Who taught you how
to solder a circuit?

243
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,263
Or write a program?
Or French braid your hair?

244
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,465
Or throw a spiral? Me.
That's what I do.

245
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,967
Who taught you how to
cook without ketchup,

246
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,302
or balance your checkbook?

247
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,140
Who always has to be
the grownup around here?

248
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,577
All right,
you got a point, okay?

249
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,478
But that means
we're a great team.

250
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
And I know it's been
sucky around here lately.

251
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,115
But we're gonna
be fine, sweetie.

252
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,584
You just gotta
keep believing, okay?

253
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:13,952
I mean, that's what
great inventors do.

254
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,854
I promise you, one day,

255
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,522
I'm gonna build
something that matters.

256
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,063
You know, your mom
would be very proud of you.

257
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,466
It's going to be okay.

258
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,133
Soldier 1: Spread out!
Push right!

259
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,268
Soldier 2: Roll, roll,
roll, roll.

260
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,203
Give me two. Give me two.

261
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,537
Take the beach,
nice and easy.

262
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,111
Release the mini-drones.

263
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,249
(Drones beeping)

264
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,816
Pilot on radio: <i> Vipers.</i>
<i>Eagle in sight. Cleared hot.</i>

265
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,536
Got a heat sig. Second stack.
Closest to the bow.

266
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:39,570
Gunner on radio: <i> Predator 0-1.</i>

267
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,139
<i>Captured target area.</i>

268
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,273
Savoy on radio:
<i>Set charges.</i>

269
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,314
Leader, leader,
this is gunfighter 0-1.

270
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,683
Eagles moving internal.
Second deck.

271
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,051
(Gunfighters
talking indistinctly)

272
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,120
Gunfighter 2: Frogman 83,
frogman 83.

273
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,178
Gunfighter 2:
Breached site on rooftop.

274
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,547
Breached site on rooftop.
Have echo platoon on standby.

275
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,582
Let the helo know
we're moving external!

276
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,389
Gunfighter 1: <i> Alpha, take</i>
<i>port. Bravo, take starboard.</i>

277
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,091
Gunfighter 2:
<i>Shift right. Shift right.</i>

278
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,773
(Gunfighters continue
talking indistinctly)

279
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,129
(Beeping)

280
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,630
Cracking steel!

281
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,035
(Groaning)

282
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,571
No!

283
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,133
Gunfighter 1:
Hit him, hit him, hit him!

284
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,177
Fire.

285
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,979
Soldier on radio:
<i>Missiles out. Danger close.</i>

286
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,082
(Ratchet groaning)

287
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,351
He's running! Move!

288
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,273
Gunfighter 2: <i> He's on</i>
<i>the run! He's on the run!</i>

289
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,732
(Groans)

290
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,235
No! Please!

291
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,238
Hold your fire. (Groaning)

292
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,241
Hold!

293
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,542
Hold fire!

294
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,813
Can you not see?
I've been injured.

295
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,748
(Groaning)
Gunfighter: <i> Box him in.</i>
<i>Box him in.</i>

296
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,818
Medical officer Ratchet!
I'm a friend!

297
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,521
(Continues groaning)

298
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,524
I'm an autobot!

299
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,559
Then why are you running?

300
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,395
Optimus sent
this distress message.

301
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,164
Optimus on speaker:
<i>Calling all autobots.</i>

302
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,799
<i>We are under targeted attack.</i>

303
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:50,668
<i>Cease all contact with humans.</i>

304
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,539
We're all hiding.
All autobots are
being hunted.

305
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,573
We're all in danger.

306
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,809
I lost a sister in Chicago.

307
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,178
You'll get no sympathy from me.

308
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,689
(Ratchet groaning)

309
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,827
What's wrong with you humans?

310
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:17,862
(Continues groaning)

311
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,470
No! Please.

312
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,049
Gunfighter 1:
Check fire, check fire!

313
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,755
He's mine now.

314
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,659
Lockdown.

315
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,729
Autobots, Decepticons.

316
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:56,334
Like little children,
always fighting.

317
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:59,170
Making a mess
out of the universe.

318
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,606
Then I've got to clean it up.

319
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,875
There is one way you survive.

320
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,776
Tell me where he's hiding.

321
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,746
Where is optimus prime?

322
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,749
Never.

323
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,891
(Groans)

324
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,527
Lockdown: Never is here.

325
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,596
(Lockdown transforms)

326
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,671
I must say,
it is remarkable,

327
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,374
really astounding
the success that
the CIA has had

328
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,242
since you have taken
operational control,

329
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,878
and so the president
has asked me to ask you

330
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,181
to ask him,

331
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,316
to invite you both, uh,

332
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,718
over to the white house
just to powwow,

333
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,456
where we get maybe
some more specifics
about how

334
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,526
exactly you're hunting
the enemy Decepticons left.

335
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,362
I've had my desk for two years.

336
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,198
Mr. attinger has been here

337
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,699
for 25.
He runs the projects

338
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,335
where I don't ask for specifics.

339
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,537
That's why they're
called black ops.

340
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,806
And why we all sleep
better at night.

341
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,608
Check. That is great.
So, um...

342
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,614
Any dirt on that?
Uh, how, uh, that's going?

343
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,484
Outstanding.

344
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,220
Great. Oh, great.

345
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,854
I was hoping to hear that.
The president
will be pleased.

346
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,890
'Cause, I'll tell you
right now, I've only been

347
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,858
chief of staff since Monday,

348
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,729
um, but I do know that the
alien war stuff, these are...

349
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,365
These are the only fun meetings.

350
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,434
Attinger: Look, I'm not here
to entertain the president,

351
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:39,437
but you may tell him
that the war will be over.

352
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,008
"...be over..."
In case he asks,

353
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,576
I just like to have
an exact quote.

354
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,811
"War will be over soon."

355
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,613
That is great.
Such good news.

356
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:52,650
And, um, the president
would, I know, just love...

357
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,018
Really, really love

358
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,520
to press the flesh...
Not flesh, obviously,

359
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,823
but just maybe get
a shot with, um...

360
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,391
Is it lord prime?
Sir prime?

361
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,660
We could bop on air force one.

362
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,562
It'd be just a quick bop,
then we just bop in and
bop back.

363
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,397
Attinger: I wouldn't get
his hopes up on that one.
Okay.

364
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,332
CIA director: He's called
optimus prime.

365
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:11,802
Alien combatant.
Here illegally.

366
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:16,274
But aren't they
our friends? Why?

367
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,343
Because our world will
never truly be safe

368
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,385
till all of them are gone.

369
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,948
Oh. Well, I would
hope we could do

370
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,483
a much more ceremonial farewell.

371
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,485
Especially since our military

372
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,553
has worked so closely with them.

373
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:30,554
Until you.
Attinger: It's
not their planet.

374
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,390
Never was.

375
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,627
Time we take it back.

376
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,507
All right, come on.
Come on.

377
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,810
Yes. Yes.

378
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,512
Yes. (Laughs)

379
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,681
Oh, there you go.

380
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,783
No, hold it.

381
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,785
Stop shaking!

382
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:02,753
Why are you shaking?
You have the job!

383
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,356
You forgot to eat dinner!

384
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:06,724
(Sighs)

385
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,493
You see why I worry?

386
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,065
Look, sorry, sweetie, I...

387
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,768
I almost got it working right.

388
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,472
So, listen, I'm done
with homework and set
with finals,

389
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,708
so I was just gonna
take a little drive
with some friends

390
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,576
if that was okay with you.
(Sighs)

391
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:28,679
No boys, I know.
Graduate first.

392
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,047
Exactly.

393
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,051
You do know no one
else has this rule, right?

394
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:37,421
Rule? Don't make it sound
harsh, okay. It's wisdom.

395
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:38,656
I don't think we need
to be driving around

396
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:41,125
It's already like quarter
to eight. It's almost dark.

397
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,626
Spud, will you stop it?

398
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,364
You know where I was
for my graduation?

399
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:49,100
Yes. With me, the mistake.

400
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:51,769
The surprise, Tess.
And the best thing
that ever happened.

401
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:53,537
Do we look unhappy? Huh?

402
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,106
No. It's the greatest
day of my life.

403
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,110
I made your mother
a promise before
she passed.

404
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:01,412
Our baby's gonna be
at her graduation.
That's it.

405
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,148
High school boys know nothing.

406
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,050
It's only later
they turn into men.

407
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,972
So if you were older
and wiser, I wouldn't exist.

408
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,389
That's not what I meant.

409
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,857
You know, this is
a non-dating household, okay?

410
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,458
You don't date,
I don't date. That's it.

411
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,460
Well, maybe you should.

412
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,896
Tessa, wait.

413
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,132
Tessa?

414
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,069
Look.

415
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,971
I know I've been
on you, okay?
But I have to be.

416
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,674
Twelve to seventeen
is the official teenage

417
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:33,177
danger window.
It's my job to get
you through it.

418
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,879
So you can be pissed
off all you want.

419
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,119
And, yes, you can take
a ride with your friends.

420
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,121
Okay.

421
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,523
Don't work all night.

422
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,057
And eat.

423
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,532
(Sighs)

424
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,646
Best thing that ever
happened, Emily.

425
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,481
She's the best thing
that ever happened.

426
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,616
You'd be proud.

427
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,055
(Electricity crackling)

428
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,690
Oh, no.

429
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,633
Unbelievable.

430
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,637
Unbelievable. God!

431
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,639
(Panting)

432
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,069
Something in here needs to
make this family some money.

433
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,784
Come on, you old wreck.

434
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:48,052
Judgment day.

435
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,833
Where is he?

436
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,168
I don't know.

437
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,738
(Barking) <i> Intruder alert!</i>
<i>Intruder alert!</i>

438
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,007
Asshole.

439
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,576
<i>I am dialing 911.</i>

440
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,913
Tess, I'm basically your Uncle.

441
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,681
<i>Su casa es mi casa.</i>

442
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,003
And we're going
to lose the <i> casa.</i>

443
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:20,851
Tessa: Dad!

444
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,019
Coming!

445
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,924
Are you working with lasers?
If so, I'm not coming in.

446
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:28,125
You guys have never seen
a truck like this before.

447
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,727
Get in here.
Lock that door.

448
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:32,296
It doesn't have a lock.

449
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,632
Look! Look at the hole
in the radiator.
Look at the size of it.

450
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:35,766
Something blew a hole in it!

451
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,067
Yeah, so?

452
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,536
It's not normal steel.

453
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:39,937
The shrapnel in the engine,

454
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,605
it ripped all
the connections apart.

455
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:43,941
And watch. And this took
some cade genius.

456
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:46,143
You are gonna love this.

457
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:48,012
When I hook this back
to a working battery...

458
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,850
Optimus: <i> Calling all...</i>

459
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,252
<i>Calling all autobots.</i>

460
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,321
Cade: Oh, yeah.

461
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:59,757
I don't think
it's a truck at all.

462
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,191
I think we just
found a transformer.

463
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,193
Tran... ugh!

464
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,029
Lucas: Evacuate!
Wait! Guys!

465
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,131
Dad, are you out of your mind?

466
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,832
You need to get that
thing out of here.

467
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:09,833
You don't have to worry.
I've been in there

468
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:12,603
You know what? That's not
a truck, okay? You're right.

469
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,004
It's an alien killing machine.

470
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,706
Dude. It's doa.
Jesus.

471
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,274
It's been recalled,
totaled, done.

472
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:19,109
So, listen,
there's a number
that you call.

473
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,844
You're supposed to
call the government.

474
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,580
It's the American thing to do.

475
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,081
Here we go.
You're supposed to call,

476
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,616
and if it ends up being alien,

477
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:26,984
then you win $25,000.

478
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,252
You don't win money.

479
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,653
And if you can
capture it live...

480
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,088
Like tag it like
a wild wildebeest,

481
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,823
then you get $100,000.

482
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:36,827
I've seen the commercial.
They don't say that.
That's not a guarantee.

483
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,662
You think Greg would lie to me?

484
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:40,331
Look, if that's
a transformer there from
the battle of Chicago,

485
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,266
I need to know how it works.

486
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,835
I'm an inventor.
This could be a game
changer for me!

487
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,770
If I can apply that
technology to
my inventions,

488
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,138
we'd never have to
worry about money again.

489
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,373
I've heard that before.

490
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,109
Twenty-five grand!
It pays for my college.

491
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,211
It pays for the house.

492
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,980
Besides, you used
my money to buy
the truck, right?

493
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:58,115
So technically,
that's my truck.
Don't you think?

494
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,251
You also signed a contract

495
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:02,786
regarding all
research lab I.P.

496
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,688
Research lab?
It's a barn, dude.

497
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,994
You signed it and
now you're competing.

498
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:11,862
Any idea of yours is mine.

499
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:12,997
Any thought you have, I own it,

500
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,999
so basically, I own you.

501
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,201
I don't think you
can own someone.

502
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:18,969
That was, like, a while ago,
even in Texas.

503
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,072
All right.
Bring the torch over

504
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,908
and help me with
the pulley arm.
(Lucas groans)

505
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,910
I think the shrapnel
took out its power core.

506
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,779
Oh, and, Tessa,
you see this?

507
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:30,881
(Hammering)
(Exclaims)

508
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,218
Would an alien killing
machine let me do that?

509
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,153
Look, I'll make the call.

510
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,656
We'll get the money.
Just first let me
see if I'm right.

511
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:39,690
You want to hide
in the house?
Go ahead.

512
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:40,692
Okay.

513
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:42,793
Let's go. Pulley arm.

514
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,264
I can't believe him!

515
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,135
What is that?
Looks like a missile.

516
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,202
Cade: It is! Whoa!

517
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,974
(Screaming)

518
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:57,976
(Groans)

519
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,015
(Screaming) (Pounding on door)

520
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,285
Tessa: Dad!

521
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,788
There's a missile
in the family room!

522
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,423
(Clanging)
Holy...

523
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,193
(Groans)
(Optimus growls)

524
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,729
I'll kill you!

525
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:19,731
(Grunting)

526
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,433
(Yelping)

527
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,269
No! No!

528
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:26,704
(Groaning)

529
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,392
Dad, there's a missile in...

530
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,873
(Screams)

531
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,909
(Grunting)

532
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:36,246
I'll kill you! Stay back!

533
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,449
Oh, no. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot!
Call 911! Run!

534
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,918
Lucas!
Stop!

535
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,786
(Groans)

536
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,790
Lucas? Don't move,
just calm down.

537
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,460
(Panting)

538
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:52,029
Optimus: Easy, human.

539
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,865
Stay there.
He's not going to hurt us.

540
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,836
Weapons systems damaged.

541
00:28:58,838 --> 00:28:59,903
A missile hit your engine.

542
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,740
And we took it out of you.

543
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:04,308
You're hurt really bad.

544
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,209
(Optimus groans)

545
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,811
I'm just trying to help you.

546
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:09,012
You're in my home now.
I'm an engineer.

547
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,347
My name is cade yeager.

548
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,218
Cade, I am in your debt.

549
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:18,021
My name is optimus prime.

550
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,758
My autobots.

551
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,026
They're in danger.

552
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:24,962
(Groans)

553
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,768
I need to go.
I need to go now.

554
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,130
How far you think
you're gonna get?

555
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,239
Tessa, come here.
He needs our help.

556
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,042
What happened to you?

557
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:42,913
An ambush. A trap.
Set by humans.

558
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,948
(Coughing)

559
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,087
I escaped and took this form.

560
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:51,249
Tessa: But
you're on our side.

561
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,557
Why would humans hurt you?

562
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,359
They were not alone.

563
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:01,231
My autobots can repair me.
Cade: Yeah.

564
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,134
If you can reach 'em.

565
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,109
What about me?

566
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,832
(Barking)

567
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,400
I warn you,
Mr. attinger of earth,

568
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,404
an alliance is a contract,
and contracts,

569
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,906
like humans,

570
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,442
expire.

571
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:48,545
On this planet,
we have a saying.

572
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,280
"The enemy of my enemy
is my friend."

573
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,916
I also have a saying.

574
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,618
"I don't care."

575
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,555
So what happened in Mexico city?

576
00:30:58,557 --> 00:30:59,923
I thought you had him.

577
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:02,326
Three direct hits.
A mortal wound.

578
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,194
Then your men
allowed him to escape.

579
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,898
You promised me
human intelligence.

580
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,034
Or is there such a thing?

581
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,469
You know,
you've still
never told me.

582
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,339
Why do you want him?

583
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:17,374
Who are you working for?

584
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:22,246
Every galaxy I've traveled,
all you species are the same.

585
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:25,215
You all think you're
the center of the universe.

586
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,952
You have no idea.

587
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,556
Go to the hardware store
and you get the list.

588
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,057
The whole list.

589
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,125
What, you're going
to try and fix him?

590
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,426
He's not a model
train set, cade.

591
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,095
No, that's right.
He's important.

592
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:41,298
You can't keep an alien
locked up in your barn.

593
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,067
Will you calm down?
I'm trying to,

594
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,203
but I just got hit
in the head with
a ten-foot Cannon!

595
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:48,205
If he eats you,
I get the gto.

596
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:49,539
Not a word to anybody.
Do you hear me?

597
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,674
Not a single word.

598
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:51,909
<i>Nobody.</i>

599
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,316
I think we have a lock
on a high-value target.

600
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,453
Special operations
group is ready.

601
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:07,958
Sir, special ops
just got a call
from Paris, Texas.

602
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,093
Hard match on the truck
seen leaving Mexico city.

603
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,929
Son of a bitch.
Let's go get him.

604
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,002
Took a hell of a hit,
you know.

605
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,644
The missile just missed
your power source.

606
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,640
We call it a spark.

607
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:26,009
It contains our life force

608
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,611
and our memories.

609
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,713
Yeah, we call it a soul.

610
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,951
Scramble cemetery wind.

611
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,521
Thank you for your efforts,
ladies and gentlemen.

612
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:38,588
This room is going dark.

613
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,092
Attinger: The exit
is on your left.

614
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,614
I'll take it from here.
Okay, let's go.

615
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,332
I'm with cemetery wind.
We're on the move.

616
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:49,599
On radio: <i> Repeat,</i>
<i>on the move.</i>

617
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,309
(Creaking)

618
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,212
Cade.

619
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,314
Why are you willing to help me?

620
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,651
I guess maybe
because you trust me to.

621
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,595
(Hip-hop music
playing on radio)

622
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,034
(Music stops)

623
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,370
I'm back!

624
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:28,271
Took you long enough!

625
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,639
My head hurts.
I had to go to the doctor.

626
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,742
I got a welt on my head

627
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:32,743
that makes me look
like a fricking
<i>Star Trek</i> character.

628
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,678
(Scoffs) Whatever.

629
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,590
Look! Look!

630
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,741
Pilot: <i> Viper 15 overhead.</i>
<i>Angels 1.</i>

631
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,476
(Tinkling)

632
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,223
Dad!

633
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,800
Mr. yeager,
my name's James savoy.

634
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:05,802
I'm a federal agent.

635
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:08,638
My men and I are
trying to track down
an abandoned truck.

636
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,479
It's a nice spread you got here.

637
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:16,481
Too bad she's for sale.

638
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,351
That the truck you mean?

639
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:23,787
Afraid not.

640
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,324
You know, Mr. yeager,
we received a call
from someone

641
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:28,625
concerned about this truck.

642
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,127
Oh, no.

643
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,129
That wasn't you?

644
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,464
Only thing I'm concerned
about is you being
on my property

645
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,300
You know, we got
a rule about people
messing with people

646
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,902
from Texas.

647
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:40,704
And I don't know what
truck you're talking about.

648
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:42,339
The kind that
cost American lives.

649
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,875
Search the property!

650
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:46,343
Cade: What do you mean,
"search the property"?
You don't have a warrant.

651
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,645
My face is my warrant.

652
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:51,848
Wait. But if you guys
do find a truck,

653
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,750
we get a reward, right?

654
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:55,592
Pilot on radio:
<i>Viper 15 holding, point Alpha.</i>

655
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:56,820
(Drones beeping)

656
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,861
Agent 2: <i> Lock it down.</i>

657
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:07,497
Open, open, open.
Short wall. Short wall.

658
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,266
Agent 3: Five in. Five in.

659
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:11,535
Robot: <i> Intruder alert!</i>
<i>Back away from the premises.</i>

660
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:12,602
Agent 2: What
the hell is that?

661
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:13,570
Agent 3: Just
some dumb inventor.

662
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:14,771
Agent 4: Clear.

663
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,306
Agent 5: Clear.

664
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:17,407
Agent 6: Clear right.

665
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,509
Agent 7: Clear.

666
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,478
Agent 8: 360. 720.
Heads on a swivel.

667
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,290
Let's go.
There's nothing here.

668
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,597
There's no signs.
We got nothing.

669
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,899
Sir, we have a live armed
missile in the trash.

670
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:45,302
Live? I carried that
to the trash!

671
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:46,970
You told me that
was a dud, dude.

672
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,739
I could be dead. Right?

673
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,443
Look. Okay, yes,
I found a truck, all right.

674
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,844
I towed it back for the parts.

675
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:56,680
I left it here last night.
This morning, it's gone.

676
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:58,281
When? Where? I don't know.
I swear to God.

677
00:36:58,283 --> 00:36:58,815
That's as much as
I know about him.

678
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:00,550
"Him."

679
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,553
He said, "him."

680
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,195
<i>He knows who
the son of a bitch is.</i>

681
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,960
Mr. yeager.
What?

682
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:10,962
Excuse me.

683
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:13,997
You just said, "him."

684
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,300
Take them down.
What?

685
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,537
Ow! Let me go!

686
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:21,638
They don't know about
the truck! I know!

687
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
Just let her go.

688
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,675
What kind of a man
betrays his flesh-and-blood

689
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:27,911
brethren for alien metal?

690
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,412
Get this guy
out of my sight.
Tessa: Get off!

691
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,847
Let her go! They don't
know about the truck.

692
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,449
All right! Load up!
Search the perimeter!

693
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:34,584
Lucas, you called,
didn't you?

694
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,020
No! I don't know
any of these scary guys.

695
00:37:37,022 --> 00:37:38,021
Oh, God!
You're manhandling a woman!

696
00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:39,422
I'll kick your ass!

697
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,724
Let her go!

698
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,713
Daddy! Let me go!
You're not going anywhere.

699
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,363
Daddy!
(Grunts)

700
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:47,685
No! You're not
taking me anywhere!

701
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,399
I'm an American!

702
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,302
Easy, sweetheart.
Okay, okay, okay.

703
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:53,864
All right. Okay.
All right. I was wrong.

704
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,040
Savoy. Use the girl.

705
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:58,842
Oh, my God! Ahh!

706
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,550
Now, you got ten seconds.
Where's the truck?

707
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:10,887
(Groaning)

708
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,756
You're gonna shoot
my little girl?

709
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:13,990
If I have to.

710
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:17,861
Look, I don't know.
I told you everything that
I know! He's gone.

711
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,696
He left. He was in the barn,
I swear to God!

712
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:20,897
<i>Just let her go!</i>
Tessa: <i> Ow!</i>

713
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,333
Please, please.

714
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:25,035
He was in there!
Let her go!

715
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:26,803
Seven seconds.

716
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,306
Cade: I'm telling you
the truth! He was in there!

717
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,074
(Tessa whimpering)

718
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,443
Tessa: Dad!

719
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,445
Cade: Tell him to get away
from my little girl now!

720
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:37,914
Tessa: (Sobbing) Dad!

721
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,930
Cade: You touch her
and I'll kill you!

722
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,700
Savoy: You got two seconds.

723
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,555
I need the truth.

724
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:46,623
Tessa: Please.

725
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:47,625
Shoot her.

Here I am!

Cade: Get down!
Ahh!

733
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:13,083
Optimus: Cade!
They're going to kill you!

734
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:14,551
Get out of here!

737

Push right!
Headed to the house!

738
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,447
Come on. Hurry up!
Get in the car!

739
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:45,689
Let's go!
Daddy, get in the car!

740

Perimeter,
optimus moving your way!

741
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,182
What's happening, baby?
Who are they?

742
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:21,684
It's the truck.
They want the truck!

743
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:22,819
"Who are they?"
Who are you,

744
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:24,061
and who are you calling "baby"?

745
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:25,989
I know you heard me.

746
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:27,431
I'm her boyfriend!
He's my boyfriend!

747
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:28,925
What?

748
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,527
You're not her boyfriend!

749
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:32,462
His name's Shane
and he drives, dad.

750
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,669
What kind of cars
are those?
They're so scary!

751
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,768
Cade: There's another one
coming up the back!

752
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,199
You gotta try to lose them
in the cornfield!

753
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,067
(All screaming)

754
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,672
He's coming up
behind us! Go!

755
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:17,634
Pilot on radio: <i> Viper 15,</i>

(All groaning)
(Agent screaming)

759
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:39,863
Mr. yeager, this is not
how I wanted us
to meet, okay?

760
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:41,631
I'm Shane,
and I'm a completely...

761
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,700
And I am not
talking to you!
Drive the car!

762
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,068

Watch out! Watch out!

00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,522
Man, I don't know how
I'm driving this good.

768
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:07,156
It's like, today I've gone
to a whole other level.

769
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:08,158
Road, focus!
Stop talking!

770
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:11,861

This may be
primarily my fault, okay.

773
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,272
They said they were
gonna bring a check!

774
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:24,194
I didn't know they were
gonna send a death squad!

775
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,617
Hang on!
(Tires screeching)

776

Host: Hey, we got
ourselves a winner!

777

Don's got it over here.

Man: Look out!
(People screaming)

779
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,563
We lost them!

780
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:48,085
Good job, stranger
from the cornfields!

781
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:57,941
The scary cars are back.

782
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,291
Lose them at the factory, Shane!

00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,528
I thought you knew
how to drive
this thing! Go!

787
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:24,867
I don't think
we're gonna
get that money.

788
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:25,869
Doesn't seem like it.

Do that thing, Shane!
You know it.

What we're about to do
is gonna be kind of scary.

796
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,377
(Engine revving)

797
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:09,245
Take out your guns
and shoot them!

798
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,880
(Gunfire)

799
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,050
They're shooting at us!
(Grunting)

800
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:16,119
Tessa, grab my stick!
Grab my stick!
What?

801
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:17,681
She's got
the best hands
in the business.

802
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:20,890
Ready, Tess? Pull!

803
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,826
(Tires screeching)

804
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,131
No! No! No!
No f-ing way!

805
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:33,770
(Lucas screaming)

806
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,408
(Grunts) Oh! Yeah!

807
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,145
Lucas: Yeah!

808
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,682
Tessa, you are so grounded!

809
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:46,884
Shane: Shit!
The rim's cracked.

810
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,184
(Horn honking)

811
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,254
Optimus.
Come on, move! Move!

812
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,857
My foot's stuck!
Wait, cade!

813
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,426
Lucas!
Wait! Wait! (Grunts)

814
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,762
Cade: Lucas!
Lucas, above you!

815
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,130
Run!

816
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:29,438
Shane: Come on,
get in, let's go!

817
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,897
Attinger: <i> I'll bet you wish</i>

818
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,219
<i>you could see my face right now.</i>

819
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,900
(Clattering loudly)

820
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,755
(Engine revving)

821
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:16,939
(Panting)

822
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:24,981
Lucas, we just left him?

823
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,250
He's gone.

824
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,206
My deepest sympathies
for the loss of your friend.

825
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:53,543
Stay here till I'm sure
we weren't followed.

826
00:46:53,545 --> 00:46:56,112
We are all targets now.

827
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,422
So we're hiding out now?
That's the plan?

828
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:08,391
We're taking orders
from a truck?

829
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:09,992
Well, you got a better idea?

830
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:15,097
Hey, move away from her, kid.
Don't...

831
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:17,500
Keep your hands off her.
All right? No.

832
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:21,304
You got your ass kicked
by a garage inventor
from Texas.

833
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:23,539
That goes on your resume.

834
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:26,042
Yeah, it goes on
all of yours, too!

835
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:28,284
Do I look like I'm
in the mood for any
of your shit today?

836
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,981
Washington thinks
we were chasing
a decepticon target,

837
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:33,216
but our story falls apart

838
00:47:33,218 --> 00:47:35,918
if we don't find
this yeager family first.

839
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,887
Yeah, well, what if he goes
to the cops or the FBI?

840
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:38,969
They know to hand him over.

841
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,858
His world as he knows it
is gone.

842
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,933
Well, bright side,
you guys met.

843
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,437
Where is he from?

844
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:56,105
I told you,
he's a driver from Texas.

845
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:57,107
Texas?

846
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,309
Where, dublin, Texas?
Shamrock, Texas?

847
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:02,078
So why does he sound
like a leprechaun?

848
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,480
You'd get your ass kicked
in Ireland for saying that.

849
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:06,722
Well, we're not in Ireland,
lucky charms. We're in Texas.

850
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:08,618
And so he drives?
What do you mean,
he drives?

851
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,219
Like, for a living?

852
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,622
Yeah. At least
he makes a living.

853
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:14,357
Thank you.

854
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,592
Shane: Look,
I race rally cars.

855
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:17,594
One driver.

856
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:20,496
One navigator. Her.

857
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:22,431
By the way,
I'm totally legit.

858
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:24,166
I just got picked up
by red bull.

859
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,069
And just so you know,

860
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,906
my life savings
was in that car back there.

861
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:31,040
This is not happening.

862
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:32,162
Shane: Oh, it definitely is.

863
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,150
How old are you?

864
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:43,386
20.

865
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:45,588
She's a
17-year-old girl.

866
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,423
So we can work this two ways.

867
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,292
One, I punch you
right in the mouth

868
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:50,494
and you call the police on me.

869
00:48:50,495 --> 00:48:51,495
Tessa: Dad.
Cade: Or two,

870
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,963
I just call the cops on you

871
00:48:53,965 --> 00:48:55,531
because this is illegal.
She's a minor.

872
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,533
We're protected by
the Romeo and Juliet laws.

873
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,068
Tessa: We dated
for a little while

874
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,503
I was a sophomore, and
he was a senior. It's fine.

875
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:05,041
We've got
a preexisting juvenile
foundational relationship.

876
00:49:05,043 --> 00:49:07,677
Statute 22.011.
What?

877
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,346
Texas statute?

878
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:11,547
That a real law?
Shane: Yep.

879
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:14,283
Romeo and Juliet, huh?

880
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:17,687
You know how those two ended up?

881
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:19,288
In love.

882
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,224
Dead. Do your parents
know about this?

883
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:24,460
Is your dad okay with you
dating a 17-year-old girl?

884
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,962
He took off when I was five,

885
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:27,604
but if I ever bump into him,
I'll ask him.

886
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,533
You know, Tessa,

887
00:49:30,535 --> 00:49:33,002
I trusted you.
To what?

888
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:35,504
Never have fun,
take a risk,

889
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:37,073
be a normal teenager,
like you?

890
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:40,443
And I have been
busting my ass
to take care of you.

891
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:41,644
Is that what you were doing

892
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:43,512
when you brought home the truck?

893
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:44,747
All you had to do was report it,

894
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:47,683
and now Lucas is dead.

895
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:50,019
And my life is over.
Thank you.

896
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:51,341
You've taken
real good care of me.

897
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,101
Tessa: <i> Please don't shoot me!</i>

898
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:06,335
Please! Dad!

899
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:09,505
They were willing to kill her.

900
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,008
Then they still are.

901
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,077
(Sighs)

902
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:17,046
Cade: Somebody somewhere
gave that order.

903
00:50:17,048 --> 00:50:18,448
I'm going to find
some fingerprints.

904
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,971
(Static crackles)
Ratchet on video: <i> Please!</i>

905
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,188
<i>No!</i>

906
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,526
<i>I'm an autobot!
I'm an autobot!</i>

907
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,261
Cade: <i> Grab whatever</i>
<i>you think we can</i>
<i>use for supplies.</i>

908
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:34,030
Clothes, anything.
And take that computer.

909
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,601
Let's go.

910
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,144
This is not easy.

911
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:50,146
Tessa: You know, you don't
suck at everything, dad.

912
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:54,784
(Gasps) What the...

913
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:07,129
Cade: I knew it.

914
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,608
You told me he was no one.

915
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,204
Well,

916
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,607
this "no one" has our tech.

917
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,144
(Sirens wailing)

918
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,485
(Tires screeching)

919
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:30,786
(Indistinct shouting)

920
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,761
(Sighs)

921
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,761
Optimus on radio:
<i>Calling all autobots.</i>

922
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:47,703
<i>Calling all autobots.</i>

923
00:51:58,215 --> 00:51:59,335
Whoa! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

924
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:10,526
(Transforming)

925
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,573
That was insane!

926
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:26,175
It was awesome,
but it was insane, right?

927
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:40,456
Oh, yeah! Hell, yeah!

928
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:43,359
He's back! He's alive!

929
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:46,362
Optimus is here!

930
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:58,674
At last.
There is hope after all.

931
00:52:58,676 --> 00:52:59,742
(Grunts)

932
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,428
(Laughing) Yeah.

933
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:24,600
Mr. leader of
the free galaxy is back.

934
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:27,903
I knew you'd make it.
I never doubted.

935
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:30,406
We got your warning.
We've been waiting.

936
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,442
Hell, yeah. Boom time.

937
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:34,944
We got the gang back together.

938
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:57,933
Humans have asked us
to play by their rules.

939
00:53:57,935 --> 00:54:02,271
Well, the rules
have just changed.

940
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:05,541
Human beings, bunch
of backstabbin' weasels.

941
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:07,676
Hound,
find your inner compass.

942
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:09,845
Loyalty is but a flower

943
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:12,248
in the winds of fear
and temptation.

944
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,682
What the hell are you saying?

945
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,417
It's a haiku.
Cut the crap,

946
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:16,986
before I drop a grenade
down your throat.

947
00:54:16,988 --> 00:54:18,654
Try it, you'll be dead.

948
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:21,323
Oh, please pull it.
Please do it.

949
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:23,025
<i>You know what, it'll
save us so much time.</i>

950
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:24,860
Well, raise your hand

951
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,929
if you're thoroughly
disenchanted

952
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,764
with our little
pleasant earth vacation.

953
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,000
So, who's the stowaways?

954
00:54:31,002 --> 00:54:32,701
Oh, whoa, hey,
what's with the gun?

955
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,470
Stop. Hound,
both of you.

956
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:36,472
They've risked their
lives for mine.

957
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:38,741
Optimus: <i> We owe them.</i>

958
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,412
<i>So, there's been
no sign of any others?</i>

959
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:45,781
Hound: <i> Nada.</i>
We are all that's left.

960
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,816
Crosshairs: They're
picking us off, one by one.

961
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:49,952
We're the pathetic,
dirty foursome.

962
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,053
And you make five.

963
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,757
So that's our
best-case scenario?

964
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,393
Autobot Witness Protection?

965
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,662
Hey, speed racer,

966
00:54:59,664 --> 00:55:01,830
you're welcome to leave anytime.

967
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:04,300
Well, for the record,
superdad,

968
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:05,934
I'm not hiding with you.

969
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:07,936
I'm hiding out
with that big guy.

970
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:10,572
<i>Sensei,</i> with your fate unknown,

971
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:12,741
Bumblebee has held command,

972
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:15,744
despite his complete
and total lack of anything

973
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:17,346
resembling warrior discipline.

974
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,481
He's like a child.

975
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,716
<i>This child is about
to kick your ass.</i>

976
00:55:20,718 --> 00:55:21,984
He brings us shame.

977
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:25,688
Hound: Cage fight.

978
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,556
Drift: Smartass.

979
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:28,678
What's the matter with them?

980
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,495
Am I the lone sage
who sees through

981
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:36,098
this puppy-dog eyes act?
It's beneath you.

982
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,599
Yes, I've been waiting

983
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:39,401
for them all
to dispatch each other,

984
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:41,337
so I could take charge
with no trouble at all.

985
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,405
Just me reporting to me.

986
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:45,007
Well, it sure looks like
you've been missed.

987
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:48,644
Autobots,
lockdown is hunting us

988
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:51,013
and humans are helping.

989
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:53,749
We need to know why.

990
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:54,783
Well, listen,
I don't know why,

991
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:55,951
but I have an idea about who.

992
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:02,124
This drone I stole recorded
footage of an autobot raid.

993
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,462
It's in pieces,
but watch what
happens here.

994
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,998
Hound: Oh,
that's leadfoot.

995
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,100
Cade: They rip him apart.

996
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:13,602
Savages.

997
00:56:13,604 --> 00:56:15,104
Cade: And later, this truck
comes to haul him off.

998
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:16,939
Ksi. Kinetic solutions.

999
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:19,375
Defense, aerospace,
government contracts.

1000
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:21,477
They designed this drone.

1001
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:22,811
So these government guys
just hunt you down,

1002
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:24,133
and then pass you off
to this ksi?

1003
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,416
Cade: The company is
headquartered in Chicago.

1004
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:28,951
That could be where
they were taken.

1005
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:31,153
No way to get inside
without a battle.

1006
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:33,722
Well, what if you had
some human help?

1007
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,023
What, are you two partners now?

1008
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:38,627
We need to know why or we'll
never get our lives back.

1009
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,731
I have sworn
to never kill humans.

1010
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,433
Big mistake.

1011
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:46,034
But when I find out
who's behind this,

1012
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,571
he's going to die.

1013
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:50,606
Hound: Hooah!

1014
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,022
Cade: <i> There's a full-on</i>
<i>manhunt out for us,</i>

1015
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:08,891
<i>so we have some new rules.</i>

1016
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:11,126
<i>Anyone who has got a badge
is not our friend.</i>

1017
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:13,128
<i>We're gonna divide and conquer.</i>

1018
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,530
<i>You two in charge of stealing
food and the essentials.</i>

1019
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:15,631
<i>And nothing else.</i>

1020
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,174
<i>Chicago ksi headquarters
is like a fortress.</i>

1021
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:27,576
<i>I'm gonna find a way</i>
<i>into their top-secret</i>
<i>military wing.</i>

1022
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:29,912
<i>Find something to</i>
<i>blackmail this company</i>
<i>and the government.</i>

1023
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:31,513
<i>We're gonna get
our freedom back.</i>

1024
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,191
All: Good morning, Mr. Joyce.

1025
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:45,794
(Electronic whirring)

1026
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:49,598
What was that sound?

1027
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,700
That's "the" sound.

1028
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:58,674
No, I asked for boundless.
Transcendent.

1029
00:57:58,676 --> 00:58:00,042
When you walk through
a door in this building,

1030
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:02,084
it should sound like you've
stepped into the future.

1031
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,150
(Electronic chime)

1032
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:09,852
Present.

1033
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:11,854
(Electronic whirring)

1034
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:14,957
Say it.

1035
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:17,125
All: Future.

1036
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:20,729
<i>The past is history.
The present is past.</i>

1037
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:22,698
Joshua on pa:
<i>The future is now.</i>

1038
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,233
Why can't I get
in touch with you?

1039
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,504
Don't you realize
what the arctic find means?

1040
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:32,608
You know that story
we were all told as children

1041
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:35,010
about a giant asteroid
that struck the earth

1042
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,979
millions of years ago
and wiped out the dinosaurs?

1043
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:38,146
Vaguely.

1044
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:39,982
Darcy: We were wrong.

1045
00:58:39,984 --> 00:58:42,784
This metal caused
the great extinction.

1046
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:44,720
How and why,
I can't yet say.

1047
00:58:44,722 --> 00:58:48,090
But carbon dating puts it
at 65 million years b.C.

1048
00:58:48,092 --> 00:58:49,958
This ore you've
got us digging for

1049
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,959
is a lot more dangerous
than you think.

1050
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:51,894
And my people...

1051
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:53,729
Darcy,

1052
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:56,051
I think that you've been out
in the field for far too long.

1053
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,068
Why don't we discuss
dinosaurs over dinner?

1054
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,004
Ribs?
Not a chance.

1055
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,641
You have no idea
what's been happening here.

1056
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,710
We're about to make
the quantum leap.

1057
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:11,613
A rare-earth metal.

1058
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,783
Molecularly unstable.

1059
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:17,152
Industrial uses, none.

1060
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,088
And then the aliens came.

1061
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,803
And we made the connection.

1062
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,626
It's what they're made of.

1063
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,763
Wembley: <i> It's the holy grail.</i>

1064
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:29,865
"Transformium."
That's what
we're calling it.

1065
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:31,266
Focus-grouped. Catchy.

1066
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:33,235
Trademarked.
Yeah.

1067
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:36,305
This is the greatest advance
in modern physics

1068
00:59:36,307 --> 00:59:38,040
since the splitting of the atom.

1069
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:40,742
It's programmable matter.

1070
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,110
And now,
we've mapped its genome.

1071
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,746
I.
Now you've
mapped its genome.

1072
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:48,016
And now we can begin to give it

1073
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,152
instructions.

1074
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,659
Wembley:
This is extremely good.

1075
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:00,028
Watch this.

1076
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:11,640
We can change anything
into anything.

1077
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,312
Sensual, almost.
Don't you think?

1078
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:21,183
(Laughing)

1079
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,086
Do you like music?

1080
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,288
The pill.

1081
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:31,693
Perhaps something
a little more violent?

1082
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:36,231
(Laughing)

1083
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,667
Oh, my God.
You've done it.

1084
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:41,370
In aerospace,
the military...

1085
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:43,138
We will own
the entire robotics industry.

1086
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,974
All exploration.

1087
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,710
The oceans. Space.
Everything.

1088
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,381
Wembley.
What is this?

1089
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,050
The jellyfish commercial
that you wanted.

1090
01:00:55,052 --> 01:00:56,418
You said they were

1091
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,020
erotic yet deadly,
like women.

1092
01:00:58,022 --> 01:00:59,855
I never said that.

1093
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:01,423
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.

1094
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:03,859
'cause you were talking
about your ex-girlfriend,

1095
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:05,927
who was sexy,
but a bitch.

1096
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:07,369
Joshua: Please
don't eat on the tour.

1097
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:09,264
Is that her?

1098
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,172
Cade: Hey, I found a whole
bunch of boxes of clothes.

1099
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,007
So, sweetie, you can
get some long pants,
nice, loose-fitting ones,

1100
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,175
and lose the short shorts, okay?

1101
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,177
What'd you guys get?

1102
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:26,081
It's protein.

1103
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,116
Look, I said
the essentials, okay?

1104
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:30,352
It wasn't easy.
We almost got caught.

1105
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:32,287
You stole mouthwash?

1106
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:34,529
I like to be fresh
when I'm making out
with your daughter.

1107
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,224
Tessa: That's funny.

1108
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:41,763
Yeah, that's not happening ever.

1109
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,000
Ever? (Chuckles)

1110
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:47,402
This is our military
prototype, galvatron.

1111
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,872
I don't understand it.

1112
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:53,241
This is the fifth iteration.

1113
01:01:53,243 --> 01:01:54,763
Why does he keep
turning out like this?

1114
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:57,372
It's just some bugs
in the final render.

1115
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,783
Joshua: I modeled galvatron
after optimus prime.

1116
01:02:01,785 --> 01:02:04,486
Why does he keep
looking like Megatron?

1117
01:02:04,488 --> 01:02:06,488
Man on pa: <i> Rendering sequence</i>
<i>is almost finished. Stand by.</i>

1118
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,056
Simple coding.

1119
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:12,260
Algorithms!

1120
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:15,130
Math!

1121
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:18,300
Why can't we make
what we want to make,

1122
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:19,868
the way we want to make it?

1123
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:22,404
Why?

1124
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:28,210
And does that look
like a consumer-friendly
face to you?

1125
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,419
And what about that
big hole in the chest?

1126
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:35,283
I think it's bad-ass.
I like it.

1127
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:37,352
Love it.
Joshua: Well, I hate it.

1128
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,490
Oh, here he is.

1129
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:44,025
That bald-headed
doc Frankenstein.

1130
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:46,161
Ma'am, this is not legal.

1131
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:48,029
This is illegal experimentation.

1132
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:50,098
Aliens would never
do this to people!

1133
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,933
Eat you, kill you,
maybe, but that's it.

1134
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,535
This ain't right!
Nobody puts baby in a box!

1135
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:55,437
Ahhh!
(Talking gibberish)

1136
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,007
This is worse
than waterboarding!

1137
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:01,109
This little gentleman
has been translating for us

1138
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,779
all the information that
comes from these two heads.

1139
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:06,348
Their history, their science,
everything.

1140
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:08,984
Darcy: Is that Megatron?
Joshua: Precisely.

1141
01:03:08,986 --> 01:03:10,852
Where did you get all this?

1142
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:12,788
Special government contract.

1143
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:14,790
Now we know everything
about transformers.

1144
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:17,359
And now at long last
we can build them ourselves.

1145
01:03:17,361 --> 01:03:18,994
And we can build them better.

1146
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:27,536

1149
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,557
Yeah, that's good, bee.
That'll get us in.

1150
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:48,557

<i>called "scanning."</i>

1152
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:54,496

Excuse me.

1156
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:08,543
There's no smooching
in front of me, okay?

1157
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:10,612
Tessa: You're so square.
Who even says "smooching"?

1158
01:04:10,614 --> 01:04:12,848
I tell you, no respect.

1159
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:14,449
It's just impossible sometimes.

1160
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:17,052
Yeah. I went through that
with Bumblebee.

1161
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,995
Shane: Calm down.
Calm down.

1162
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:29,464
You know, at a time like this,

1163
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:31,166
the idea is to keep cool,
not look cool,

1164
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:32,488
so why don't
you lose the glasses?

1165
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,605
About a month ago,

1166
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,573
middle of the night,
I thought I heard
noises in my house.

1167
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40,108
Was that you?

1168
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:41,243
What? Come on. No way.

1169
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:43,044
Don't lie to me, kid.

1170
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,646
You see that guy
with the gun out there?

1171
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:45,947
There's so many guys with guns.

1172
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:48,016
We're about to break in
and it's your idea,

1173
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:49,284
'cause I don't care.

1174
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:50,318
I'm old, I've already
lived long enough.

1175
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,521
Of having these conversations
at the wrong time, man.

1176
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:56,224
You want to come clean
or you want me to
make a mess?

1177
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,525
Sir, can I talk to you
for a second, please?

1178
01:04:57,527 --> 01:04:59,207
It was me, it was me,
it was me, it was me.

1179
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:02,030
(Sighing) I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1180

Uh-huh.

1181
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,235
(Electronic whirring)

1182
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,438
All right.
You're good to go.

1183
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,173
I'm literally gonna kill you.

What the hell
is going on here? Huh?

1215
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:26,448
What's with this vintage crap?

1216
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:29,084
We're not scanning

What do you think it is

It won't happen again.
It certainly won't.

1265
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:35,176
(Sighs) That was
a little bit intense.

1266
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:36,744
I need more transformium,

1267
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:39,481
and I need it now,
to build more prototypes.

1268
01:08:39,483 --> 01:08:42,317
You tell your alien
bounty hunter

1269
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:46,354
that I have staked my company
on this deal.

1270
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:48,656
And I have merely
staked my life.

1271
01:08:48,658 --> 01:08:50,692
Hey, you came to me on this,
remember?

1272
01:08:50,694 --> 01:08:52,894
You retire from the CIA,

1273
01:08:52,896 --> 01:08:55,763
you get a seven-figure piece
of my company, and you and I

1274
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:59,267
revolutionize national
defense together.

1275
01:08:59,269 --> 01:09:02,804
But, attinger, buddy,
for both our sakes,

1276
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:06,341
you need to deliver

1277
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:08,676
the seed.

1278
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:22,891
(Electronic beeping)

1279
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,495
Cade: <i> I'm in.</i>
<i>Can you see my camera?</i>

1280
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:30,431
<i>They're melting Ratchet.</i>

1281
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,902
They slaughtered Ratchet!

1282
01:09:33,904 --> 01:09:36,638
I'm gonna tear them apart!

1283
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,439
Darcy: Metal.

1284
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,096
Just metal. That's what
I always thought of them.

1285
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,379
Well, they're not.

1286
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:46,101
They're living things,
with souls like ours.

1287
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,718
Once, I spoke to one.

1288
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,854
And you're working
with transformium?

1289
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:55,957
Uh, yeah,
that's what I do. I am.

1290
01:09:55,959 --> 01:09:57,292
I'm out there digging for it.

1291
01:09:57,294 --> 01:09:58,654
There's just not
much left to find.

1292
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,330
So that's how badly
you boys need more, huh?

1293
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:04,265
Reduced to melting
evil old Decepticons down.

1294
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:07,802
No.
That's an autobot there.

1295
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,705
The ones who fought for us.

1296
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:11,472
I've got this taken care of
from here.

1297
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:13,408
Right.

1298
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:15,543
Same badge code scanned
at two separate gates.

1299
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,579
I'm having the classified area
locked down now.

1300
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:26,487
Check that guy.

1301
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:29,891
Hey!

1302
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:31,826
Stop right there!

1303
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:37,265
Stop!

1304
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:44,305
Freeze!

1305
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:47,835
(Brakes screeching)
Up against the wall.

1306
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:50,331
(Pants) All right.
(Handcuffs clicking)

1307
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:53,014
Corporate espionage.

1308
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:54,882
That's a very serious crime,
Mr. yeager.

1309
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:03,725
(Tires screeching)

1310
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:15,336
(Exhales) Wow.

1311
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:20,642
Cade: Look,
I want a lawyer.

1312
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:22,977
The justice department.
Somebody I can trust.

1313
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:25,880
Not from your company,
from the government.

1314
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:27,615
Mr. yeager,

1315
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,984
who do you think I work for?

1316
01:11:29,986 --> 01:11:32,920
You're trying to
protect your family,
that's admirable.

1317
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:35,823
I'm trying to defend
the nation from alien war.

1318
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,292
We've had a taste
of what that looks like,

1319
01:11:37,294 --> 01:11:39,054
and we are not gonna
tolerate another. Now...

1320
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:42,664
There is a version
of this conversation

1321
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:44,732
where you get to
go back to your barn,

1322
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:46,334
your daughter gets
to graduate with honors,

1323
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:48,936
and life as you know it
will go on.

1324
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,940
You have no idea what
you're involved with here.

1325
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:55,677
Really?

1326
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:59,914
What's the other version
of this conversation?

1327
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:02,817
The one when you send in
the hired help to
murder my little girl?

1328
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,886
Or you gonna man up
and do it yourself?

1329
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,424
What's your preference?

1330
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,560
I'm going to ask you this once.

1331
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:14,095
Where is optimus prime?

1332
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,731
(Engine revving)
(Tires screeching)

1333
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,547
(Gun firing)

1334
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:50,598
Bumblebee: <i> Come on.</i>
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

1335
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,567
We're moving. Basement.

1336
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:56,738
They're here.

1337
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:01,843
Optimus: Get out!
All of you!

1338
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:03,911
Hound: Science fair's over,
meatbags!

1339
01:13:03,913 --> 01:13:05,546
Optimus: Destroy the lab!
Move, move, move, move!

1340
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:06,548
Look out! Look out!

1341
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:09,717
Destroy it all!

1342
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:14,989
Danger! Security breach!
Danger... (Exclaims)

1343
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:17,392
Guys! It's me!

1344
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:18,874
Break me out of
this Frankenstein box!

1345
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,128
Joshua: Hey!

1346
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,130
Hey!

1347
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:23,998
Hey!

1348
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,767
Stop!

1349
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:27,668
That's company property!

1350
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,604
They're not your property!

1351
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:34,942
They were my friends.

1352
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:39,614
Oh, you ain't talking
so much now!

1353
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:41,115
You got hound
in front of you, huh?

1354
01:13:41,117 --> 01:13:42,850
Go ahead.

1355
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:44,886
Show us your true colors,
once and for all.

1356
01:13:44,888 --> 01:13:48,756
Just give me the word,
I'll splatter him.

1357
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,825
Why don't you
tell itchy fingers here

1358
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:53,428
that this is all the spoils
of war. Dead metal.

1359
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:59,100
Innovation. What we do
here is science.

1360
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:02,170
Because if we don't do it,
somebody else will.

1361
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:03,905
Because you cannot
stop technology!

1362
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,108
We're not your technology!

1363
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,949
Let me vaporize his ass.

1364
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:18,820
I broke the code.
I own your whole genome.

1365
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:23,024
The world will know
what you're doing here.

1366
01:14:23,026 --> 01:14:25,660
The world?
The world will approve.

1367
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,030
We can make you now.

1368
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:32,767
Don't you get it?
We don't need you anymore.

1369
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,903
Hound: That was cruel.

1370
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,176
Autobots,

1371
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:46,514
we're done.

1372
01:14:46,516 --> 01:14:49,016
We're done? We're not gonna
kick a little bit of ass?

1373
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:50,885
Hound: I've been itching
to kill something lately.

1374
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:52,253
This is our chance.
We have to stop him.

1375
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:53,754
You have to stop him.

1376
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:55,256
It's never been tested
in the field.

1377
01:14:55,258 --> 01:14:57,725
Labs, military bases,
but not on civilian streets.

1378
01:14:57,727 --> 01:14:59,193
Down there
a defense department
contract

1379
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:01,062
was just attacked
in a terrorist attack.

1380
01:15:01,064 --> 01:15:03,898
This is now a CIA military op.

1381
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,801
You're indemnified.
Respond!

1382
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,074
Let's go.

1383
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:17,011
Ksi Chicago,
closest live sat,
patch it in.

1384
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,579
Been an unprovoked
autobot attack.

1385
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:19,981
Bring up galvatron.

1386
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,819
Transforming galvatron.

1387
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:26,053
<i>Galvatron coming online.</i>

1388
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:33,667
Female voice:
<i>Stinger coming online.</i>

1389
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:42,203
Let's show
these alien terrorists

1390
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:43,285
what an upgrade looks like.

1391
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:48,747
Air force operator 1:
<i>Galvatron and stinger are</i>
<i>moving to intercept targets.</i>

1392
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:56,889
Air force operator 2: <i> Reapers.</i>
<i>Five targets in the open.</i>
<i>Good picture.</i>

1393
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:02,089
Two Miles to intercept.

1394
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:14,702
Standing air force operator:
200 meters.

1395
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:16,837
Engage.

1396
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,773
Transform.

1397
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:32,219
Whoa.

1398
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,159
(Grunting)

1399
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,299
We are programming this,
right?

1400
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:48,102
Yes. Mostly.

1401
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,303
Air force operator 3:
<i>Systems seem to</i>
<i>have malfunctioned.</i>

1402
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:52,006
Targeting five bogeys.

1403
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:54,075
Engaging rockets.

1404
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:55,643
Missiles away.

1405
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,179
Gotta haul ass, bee!
Come on!

1406
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:17,824
Air force operator 1:
<i>Stinger is in pursuit.</i>

1407
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:30,645
Misfire, misfire!
Misfire, misfire!

1408
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:32,680
System failure.
Galvatron just fired
four rockets.

1409
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:33,802
Whoa!
They're shooting at us!

1410
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:47,046
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Watch out! What are you doing?

1411
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:52,166
(Humans screaming)

1412
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:13,287
Bumblebee: <i> Argh!</i>

1413
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,432
<i>What was that?</i>

1414
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:27,034
We need a full medical team now.

1415
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:30,371
I mean, you got a lot of
people in the crossfire here.
I don't like...

1416
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:31,739
You're making history here.

1417
01:18:31,741 --> 01:18:32,973
For your country,
for the world.

1418
01:18:32,975 --> 01:18:35,176
Human freedom is at stake.

1419
01:18:35,178 --> 01:18:36,911
Innocent people die
all the time.

1420
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,152
Come on, optimus!

1421
01:18:58,867 --> 01:18:59,900
(Optimus growling)

1422
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:08,142
(Tessa panting)

1423
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:12,213
Tessa!

1424
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:19,153
(Yelping)

1425
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:23,791
Make him fight.
Don't let him go down.

1426
01:19:23,793 --> 01:19:25,392
Make him fight!

1427
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:26,327
Shane: Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

1428
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:27,895
(Grunts)

1429
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:32,366
(Panting)

1430
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,401
(Gasps)
Cade: Tessa!

1431
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:36,237
Tessa!

1432
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:37,972
Tessa, run to the field!

1433
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:42,009
(Yelping)

1434
01:19:43,545 --> 01:19:45,012
(Growling)

1435
01:19:45,014 --> 01:19:47,148
You have no soul!

1436
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:51,051
That is why I have no fear!

1437
01:19:51,053 --> 01:19:53,354
(Both grunting)
You die!

1438
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:07,134
Help me!

1439
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,173
(Groaning)

1440
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:15,843
(Panting)

1441
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:31,492
What is that?

1442
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:35,830
That's my asset.
Pull galvatron back.

1443
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:37,231
Do it.

1444
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:48,175
(Panting)

1445
01:20:58,854 --> 01:20:59,954
(Groaning)

1446
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:10,030
I got to go get her.

1447
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,098
(Panting)

1448
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:14,401
Cade: Tessa!

1449
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:17,905
Don't go out there!
He'll kill you!

1450
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:19,273
She needs my help!
She's hidden!

1451
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:21,942
Optimus! Optimus,
get up, get up!

1452
01:21:21,944 --> 01:21:24,245
I can't. Get out of here.

1453
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:30,217
I feel sorry for you, prime.

1454
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,920
Your allegiance to these humans.

1455
01:21:32,922 --> 01:21:37,057
The trouble with loyalty
to a cause is that the cause

1456
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:39,126
will always betray you.

1457
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:42,363
Who sent you here?

1458
01:21:42,365 --> 01:21:44,531
Where do you think
you came from?

1459
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:46,133
(Scoffs) You think
you were born?

1460
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:50,004
No. You were built.

1461
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:53,140
And your creators want you back.

1462
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:56,243
We all work for someone.

1463
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:08,188
No, no.

1464
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:10,257
No.

1465
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:12,293
It's got her!

1466
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:13,627
She's in the car!
Tessa!

1467
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:15,129
No!
Tessa!

1468
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:21,669
Tessa: Dad!

1469
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,138
Tessa, get out!

1470
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:26,240
Get out!

1471
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:28,375
Tessa!

1472
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,181
Get out! Tessa!

1473
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:35,482
Dad, help me!

1474
01:22:35,484 --> 01:22:37,685
Tessa!
Help me, help me!
Dad! Dad!

1475
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:44,491
Dad!

1476
01:22:44,493 --> 01:22:46,293
Dad!
Tessa!
Break the glass!

1477
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,028
Break the glass
to get out!
I'm trying!

1478
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:50,297
Tessa, I can't hold on!
Dad!

1479
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:52,433
Tessa!

1480
01:22:52,435 --> 01:22:54,201
Help me!
Just break it!
Break the glass!

1481
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:55,203
Tess...

1482
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:02,109
Optimus: Cade,
warn the autobots!

1483
01:23:02,111 --> 01:23:04,178
Dad, help me!
Don't leave me!

1484
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:07,181
No!

1485
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:38,445
Lockdown: Take that human
to the trash.

1486
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:44,218
(Siren wailing)
(Helicopter whirring)

1487
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,086
(People screaming)

1488
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:51,091
Attinger: Mr. secretary.

1489
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,063
My team is on the way.
This is a CIA operation.

1490
01:23:56,065 --> 01:23:58,732
This is my asset.

1491
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:01,502
Tell the military to stand down.

1492
01:24:01,504 --> 01:24:03,203
Hang on,
I have the white house.

1493
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:04,138
Chief of staff:
<i>Agent, hello!</i>

1494
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,706
<i>Oh, my goodness. Boy,</i>

1495
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,741
is it a flurry of excitement
over here at the white house.

1496
01:24:07,743 --> 01:24:10,577
Everybody is super,
super mad. At me.

1497
01:24:10,579 --> 01:24:12,479
So, I went over my notes
from our last meeting,

1498
01:24:12,481 --> 01:24:15,115
and I'm not sure when
you said anything about

1499
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:17,217
a "giant alien warship
over Michigan Avenue."

1500
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:18,819
Tell the president
this is not an attack.

1501
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:29,663
Remember this ship, prime?

1502
01:24:29,665 --> 01:24:31,732
Built for all you knights,
you great crusaders,

1503
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:34,435
to explore the universe.

1504
01:24:34,437 --> 01:24:37,671
Well, I commandeered it.
It's my personal prison now.

1505
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:41,575
(Machines clattering)

1506
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:56,723
(Exhales shakily)

1507
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:11,638
(Roaring)

1508
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,774
(Both screeching)

1509
01:25:13,776 --> 01:25:14,776
(Gasping)

1510
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,115
(Grunting)
(Screeches)

1511
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:24,585
(Screaming)

1512
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:35,195
Optimus?

1513
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:45,873
Welcome back to
the knights' temenos, prime.

1514
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:50,477
You have disgraced it.

1515
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:56,150
(Growling)

1516
01:25:56,152 --> 01:25:59,887
Join your fellow rebels,
fugitive scum.

1517
01:25:59,889 --> 01:26:01,655
It's for the rarest
of specimens.

1518
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:03,824
The worst of the worst.

1519
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:06,193
It's taken centuries,

1520
01:26:06,195 --> 01:26:09,663
but I've collected all
the knights but you.

1521
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:10,797
(Optimus groaning)

1522
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:20,474
The creators want to sweep
their chessboard clean.

1523
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:26,880
I'm slave to no one.

1524
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:31,885
All this species
mixing with species.

1525
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:35,489
It upsets the cosmic balance.

1526
01:26:35,491 --> 01:26:38,258
The creators,
they don't like it.

1527
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:41,628
They built you to do
what you were told.

1528
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:45,966
Shane: Why hasn't it
taken off yet?

1529
01:26:45,968 --> 01:26:48,008
Come on, bee, it's descending.
You got to get on it!

1530
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:50,237
Attinger on phone:
<i>Savoy, mission accomplished.</i>

1531
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:53,373
<i>Lockdown has prime.
The deal's going down now.</i>

1532
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:54,895
Picking up the seed
at the recon point.

1533
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:06,720
(Sirens wailing)

1534
01:27:09,424 --> 01:27:11,344
Agent on radio:
<i>Nest, talon.</i>
<i>L.Z. Appears clear.</i>

1535
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:28,408
(Panting)

1536
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:35,382
Lockdown: Much as
I've enjoyed the hunt,

1537
01:27:35,384 --> 01:27:37,818
I won't miss your
wretched planet.

1538
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:40,754
Our deal is done.
One prime for one seed.

1539
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:45,025
Handle it with care.

1540
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:51,598
I trust your species is ready.

1541
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,300
Don't worry about our species.

1542
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:56,637
Farewell, earth.

1543
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:02,009
(People screaming)

1544
01:28:06,347 --> 01:28:07,581
Cade: Come on, come on!

1545
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:20,927
Bee, come on!

1546
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:26,366
It's a bad idea.
But I'm all about bad ideas.

1547
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,368
Let's go!

1548
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:31,772
Crosshairs: Well, let's rock.

1549
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:53,393
This is crazy.

1550
01:28:53,395 --> 01:28:54,594
Look, you wanna
cut and run,
you better do it now.

1551
01:28:54,596 --> 01:28:56,563
I'm gonna die trying.

1552
01:28:56,565 --> 01:28:58,899
Hey, I'm not here to help
you get your daughter.

1553
01:28:58,901 --> 01:29:00,501
You're here to help me
get my girlfriend.

1554
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:06,373
Engage dark-matter drives.
Full power.

1555
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:18,051
Hound: We're behind
enemy lines now.

1556
01:29:18,053 --> 01:29:19,886
Lockdown's ship has booby traps.

1557
01:29:19,888 --> 01:29:21,788
Eyes open.

1558
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:24,591
Beware of his bone
grinders, brain blinders,
flesh peelers,

1559
01:29:24,593 --> 01:29:26,093
chromosomal inverters,

1560
01:29:26,095 --> 01:29:27,761
catatonic sludge,
black hole
trapdoors,

1561
01:29:27,763 --> 01:29:29,429
and, of course,
radiation.

1562
01:29:29,431 --> 01:29:32,699
We must be quick. We have
the element of surprise.

1563
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:35,102
Let's try to use violence
as a last resort.

1564
01:29:35,104 --> 01:29:36,436
(Grunts)

1565
01:29:36,438 --> 01:29:37,671
Oh, get it!

1566
01:29:37,673 --> 01:29:39,406
I kill you!
Kill you!

1567
01:29:39,408 --> 01:29:40,574
Crosshairs: Ugh.
I hate those things.

1568
01:29:40,576 --> 01:29:41,908
That's freaky.

1569
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:43,577
He's not alive anymore.

1570
01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:46,413
Well, we looked.
They're not here. Let's go.

1571
01:29:46,415 --> 01:29:48,615
What? Hey, I'm not going
anywhere without Tessa.

1572
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:50,917
I'm unclear.
What's in it for me?

1573
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:52,052
What's in it for you?

1574
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:56,590
Easy. Let's use words.

1575
01:29:56,592 --> 01:29:59,926
What's in it for you
is I don't kill you.

1576
01:29:59,928 --> 01:30:02,763
We're getting the boss back.
And the girl. Copy?

1577
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:08,468
Okay, okay.
Very persuasive.
Textbook machismo.

1578
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:11,538
Well, then. We'll need
to sabotage something.

1579
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:13,073
Better hurry.
Because dark-matter drives

1580
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:14,174
are preparing to take off.

1581
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,009
Oh, wonderful.

1582
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:17,677
I give us 10 minutes.

1583
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,913
Is that what that sound is?
The engines filling up?

1584
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:21,515
Are you telling me
that thing's gonna be...

1585
01:30:21,517 --> 01:30:22,883
This is gonna be flying out
of here in 10 minutes?

1586
01:30:22,885 --> 01:30:24,084
Drift: Uh-huh.
Ten minutes?

1587
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:25,786
Could be nine.
Worst case, seven.

1588
01:30:25,788 --> 01:30:27,421
Humans, search the cell blocks.

1589
01:30:27,423 --> 01:30:28,522
Cade: We're wasting time,
let's go.

1590
01:30:28,524 --> 01:30:29,423
Hound: We'll find
the center core.

1591
01:30:29,425 --> 01:30:30,824
Let's move.

1592
01:30:30,826 --> 01:30:32,266
We're gonna stop
this nightmare ship.

1593
01:30:40,835 --> 01:30:42,636
(Spaceship powering up)

1594
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:49,509
Cade: We're never gonna
find her in this huge ship.

1595
01:30:49,511 --> 01:30:50,944
Like a needle in a haystack.

1596
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:53,613
Tessa!

1597
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:54,981
(Echoing)

1598
01:30:54,983 --> 01:30:56,149
Great. Great.

1599
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:00,587
Oh, that was smooth.

1600
01:31:00,589 --> 01:31:01,855
No, that was really smooth,

1601
01:31:01,857 --> 01:31:03,590
letting everybody
know we're here.

1602
01:31:03,592 --> 01:31:04,992
Now they're gonna
be looking for us.

1603
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,235
Drift: Better hurry,
crosshairs,

1604
01:31:15,237 --> 01:31:17,671
before we go into space!

1605
01:31:17,673 --> 01:31:19,940
Ah. Here's the little
jujube right here.

1606
01:31:21,509 --> 01:31:23,109
Hello, mama.

1607
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:37,691
Who fired the anchors?

1608
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:44,865
Who's on my ship?
We have a loose prisoner.

1609
01:31:44,867 --> 01:31:45,966
(Speaking alien language)

1610
01:31:48,536 --> 01:31:49,569
Cade: Hurry up.

1611
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:51,204
We got like six minutes.

1612
01:31:51,206 --> 01:31:52,206
We'll find her.

1613
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:55,208
Hold up.

1614
01:31:58,646 --> 01:31:59,880
Back up.

1615
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:04,951
Come on, these
things are gonna
find us. Hurry, hide.

1616
01:32:04,953 --> 01:32:06,620
(Panting)

1617
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:17,564
(Yelping)

1618
01:32:17,832 --> 01:32:18,899
(Growling)

1619
01:32:29,577 --> 01:32:30,644
(Screams)

1620
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:48,595
(Arming)

1621
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:54,968
Whoa!

1622
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:02,208
Weapons!

1623
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:05,011
Come here. Help me.
Hurry, hurry.

1624
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:13,119
Help me up.

1625
01:33:13,121 --> 01:33:14,955
There are some weird
sounds out there.

1626
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:28,068
(Speaking alien language)

1627
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:44,217
(Panting)

1628
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:48,788
(Whimpering)

1629
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:01,368
What is that?
I don't know.

1630
01:34:01,902 --> 01:34:02,936
You ready?

1631
01:34:04,038 --> 01:34:05,038
Run.
(Weapons firing)

1632
01:34:09,744 --> 01:34:10,744
Shane: Oh!

1633
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,812
(Groans)

1634
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:16,028
All right, we're not
going down without a fight.

1635
01:34:18,886 --> 01:34:21,121
They turn that corner,
and we're gonna take them.
You ready or

1636
01:34:21,123 --> 01:34:22,722
you gonna bitch out on me?
No, I got your back.

1637
01:34:22,724 --> 01:34:23,724
Are you ready?
Absolutely.

1638
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:27,827
Cade: Don't bitch out on me.
Are you ready?

1639
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:28,862
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1640
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:32,399
Whoa, okay! I surrender!
I surrender! I surrender!

1641
01:34:38,272 --> 01:34:40,306
I'm so sorry!
I'm so, so, so sorry!

1642
01:34:40,308 --> 01:34:41,274
What'd you do?
How'd you do that?

1643
01:34:41,276 --> 01:34:42,976
I have no idea!

1644
01:34:42,978 --> 01:34:45,078
You no-good,
chickenshit little rat!

1645
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,314
Look at that.
You see that? Oh!

1646
01:34:48,316 --> 01:34:49,416
Whoa!

1647
01:34:50,284 --> 01:34:51,951
You stay here, lucky charms!

1648
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:05,365
(Yelling)

1649
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:13,073
Oh, man. I am
so gonna patent this shit.

1650
01:35:13,741 --> 01:35:15,408
(Grunting)

1651
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:27,220
Ew!

1652
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:29,055
Cade: Tess!

1653
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:31,925
Dad! Help me!

1654
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:33,426
Hey!

1655
01:35:33,428 --> 01:35:34,428
Tess?
Tess!

1656
01:35:40,801 --> 01:35:41,868
Cade: Come on, move, move!

1657
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:44,838
Tessa!

1658
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:47,040
Shane, I love you!
I love you! You saved me!
You saved me!

1659
01:35:47,042 --> 01:35:48,042
Shane: I know. I know.

1660
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:52,045
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1661
01:35:52,047 --> 01:35:53,780
Thank you. You saved me.

1662
01:35:53,782 --> 01:35:55,148
Oh, yeah,
he saved you. Yeah.

1663
01:35:55,150 --> 01:35:57,016
Yeah.

1664
01:35:57,018 --> 01:35:58,284
I think you
and Mr. "I surrender"

1665
01:35:58,286 --> 01:35:59,919
have a lot to
catch up about, sweetie.

1666
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:01,121
He saved me, too.
You should have
seen him in there.

1667
01:36:01,123 --> 01:36:03,957
I mean, our hero.
Let's go. Now.

1668
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:05,825
Eyes open.

1669
01:36:05,827 --> 01:36:06,947
Crosshairs: I almost got it.

1670
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:09,863
Hound: Big boy coming
through! Move, move, move.

1671
01:36:09,865 --> 01:36:11,464
Crosshairs: Whoa!

1672
01:36:11,466 --> 01:36:13,833
Hound: This has got to be
the supermax.

1673
01:36:13,835 --> 01:36:14,968
Watch the corners.

1674
01:36:15,803 --> 01:36:17,971
There's a lot of cages.

1675
01:36:17,973 --> 01:36:19,939
Hound: Oh, yeah.
Creepy critters in here.

1676
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:22,141
Crosshairs: I don't want to
know what's in the big cage.

1677
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:23,443
What's this?

1678
01:36:23,445 --> 01:36:25,011
Hound, don't do it.

1679
01:36:25,013 --> 01:36:26,980
Aw, you don't look
very dangerous in there.

1680
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:31,151
Oh, that's festering ugliness.

1681
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:34,354
I'm hit! I'm down!
It's melting!

1682
01:36:34,356 --> 01:36:35,356
It burns!

1683
01:36:36,824 --> 01:36:38,358
Ugh, I think it's acid!

1684
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:41,895
Ah, nuts.
It's just shizzle.

1685
01:36:41,897 --> 01:36:42,929
(Crosshairs exclaims in disgust)

1686
01:36:42,931 --> 01:36:44,931
I hope that's not contagious.

1687
01:36:44,933 --> 01:36:46,800
I got to hurt you now.

1688
01:36:46,802 --> 01:36:48,162
You're just too
disturbing to live.

1689
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:49,536
Take that, bitch!

1690
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:53,139
Oh! You're dead.

1691
01:36:53,141 --> 01:36:55,475
Optimus: Hound!
He's alive!

1692
01:36:55,477 --> 01:36:56,910
Crosshairs: Hold on, boss,
we're coming!

1693
01:36:56,912 --> 01:36:58,912
Hound: Optimus, sound off!
In here, quick!

1694
01:36:58,914 --> 01:37:00,480
Hang on,
we're coming for you!

1695
01:37:00,482 --> 01:37:02,282
The arms of this
knight ship detach!

1696
01:37:02,284 --> 01:37:03,850
We can break free!
It's a separate ship!

1697
01:37:03,852 --> 01:37:05,185
Hurry!

1698
01:37:05,187 --> 01:37:06,553
Where's the cockpit?
Right or left?

1699
01:37:06,555 --> 01:37:08,121
Right!
I'm on it, boss.

1700
01:37:08,123 --> 01:37:10,190
Hurry. We have no time.

1701
01:37:10,192 --> 01:37:11,891
Drift: <i> Sensei.</i>

1702
01:37:11,893 --> 01:37:14,460
Let's rock! I always wanted
to fly one of these things.

1703
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:16,162
I'm there, boss!

1704
01:37:18,566 --> 01:37:21,568
Hey,
yeager technologies,

1705
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:23,436
you gonna invent us
a way out of this one?

1706
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:29,843
Tessa: Oh!

1707
01:37:29,845 --> 01:37:31,444
Whoa.

1708
01:37:31,446 --> 01:37:32,912
Oh, my God.

1709
01:37:34,148 --> 01:37:36,115
I am not doing this.

1710
01:37:36,117 --> 01:37:37,483
I am not doing that.
Yes, we are.

1711
01:37:38,986 --> 01:37:40,587
No, it's good. It's stable.
Come on.

1712
01:37:41,155 --> 01:37:43,356
No way.

1713
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:44,858
Sweetie, you know
why I'm here? I'm
here to protect you.

1714
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:46,492
You've done great at that.

1715
01:37:46,494 --> 01:37:48,934
I want you to trust me
right now. We're getting
down. Let's go.

1716
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:57,103
Don't look down, okay? Step.
See, it's easy. Come on.

1717
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:02,909
Shane: Careful,
these cables are starting
to get thinner here!

1718
01:38:02,911 --> 01:38:04,510
Cade: Step. Step. There.

1719
01:38:04,512 --> 01:38:06,145
Tessa: Oh, my God!

1720
01:38:06,147 --> 01:38:08,548
Cade: See, don't look down!
All right? Don't look down.

1721
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,350
We're gonna be
at the building in no time!

1722
01:38:11,485 --> 01:38:12,619
You okay, Tess?

1723
01:38:13,654 --> 01:38:14,654
Cade: Keep stepping.

1724
01:38:15,956 --> 01:38:17,490
Tessa: Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, dad! Oh!

1725
01:38:22,496 --> 01:38:24,656
All right, sweetie. You need
to keep moving here, okay?

1726
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:26,499
Come on!
Tessa: I can't.

1727
01:38:27,134 --> 01:38:28,968
I'm freaking out.

1728
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:30,637
You need to move now!

1729
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:33,239
I'm not moving!
I'm going back to the ship!

1730
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:39,479
You can't go back
to the ship, honey!

1731
01:38:39,481 --> 01:38:41,114
Watch me!

1732
01:38:41,116 --> 01:38:42,415
You are not 18 years old yet

1733
01:38:42,417 --> 01:38:44,177
and you're gonna do
what I say! Now let's go!

1734
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:51,124
(Roaring)

1735
01:38:51,126 --> 01:38:54,260
We need to
go this way, okay.
Not that way.

1736
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:55,962
Talk to her, Romeo! Now!

1737
01:38:55,964 --> 01:38:57,196
Come on, for God's sake.

1738
01:38:57,198 --> 01:38:58,298
Do not start with me.

1739
01:39:03,504 --> 01:39:05,305
Oh, my God, what is that?

1740
01:39:05,307 --> 01:39:06,307
All right, Tessa.

1741
01:39:06,707 --> 01:39:08,441
Don't look back.

1742
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:10,576
Well, don't say that to me.
Now I want to turn around.

1743
01:39:10,578 --> 01:39:12,345
It's nothing major, sweetie.

1744
01:39:12,347 --> 01:39:14,347
Well, that means
it's totally major!

1745
01:39:14,349 --> 01:39:17,550
It's gonna feel like it's in
your direction, but I'm not.

1746
01:39:19,553 --> 01:39:21,654
You better hurry.
Are you trying to kill me?

1747
01:39:21,656 --> 01:39:23,489
I had to bust my ass to get
up here on this spaceship!

1748
01:39:23,491 --> 01:39:25,091
Shoot it!
Get down now!

1749
01:39:25,093 --> 01:39:26,093
(Screams)

1750
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:32,498
(Whimpering)

1751
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:40,173
(Cade grunting)
(Tessa yelping)

1752
01:39:44,345 --> 01:39:47,480
Tessa, wait! I'm coming
for you! Tessa! Oh!

1753
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:58,191
(Tessa screaming)

1754
01:39:58,193 --> 01:39:59,659
Tessa: Oh, my God!
Cade: I'm coming!

1755
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:01,527
Hold on!

1756
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:05,999
(Tessa screaming)

1757
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:07,333
(Men shouting)

1758
01:40:20,247 --> 01:40:21,481
(All panting)

1759
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:27,687
You're the best, bee!
You are the best.

1760
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:30,156
<i>You damn right!
And don't ever forget it.</i>

1761
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:32,458
You see that? Look at me!
We're off the ship, right?

1762
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:35,161
Crosshairs: Bumblebee!
Bumblebee! Friendly!

1763
01:40:35,163 --> 01:40:38,297
Enemy ships are coming in hot.
Get on! Get on!

1764
01:40:42,403 --> 01:40:43,403
Tessa: Oh!

1765
01:40:49,143 --> 01:40:50,643
Hold your knickers,
I'm punching it!

1766
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:03,356
They got three ships on them!

1767
01:41:03,358 --> 01:41:04,824
I'm giving it the juice!
(Grunts)

1768
01:41:08,762 --> 01:41:10,830
Come on, bee,
take them out!

1769
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:18,071
Good move, bee!

1770
01:41:18,073 --> 01:41:19,839
This one's for you,
a-holes!

1771
01:41:34,621 --> 01:41:35,721
If you're gonna
do something,
you better do it!

1772
01:41:35,723 --> 01:41:37,156
Cade: Come on!

1773
01:41:39,193 --> 01:41:42,328
I'm sick of this crap.
You fly. I shoot.

1774
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:46,099
Hey, you better let me
fire this big-ass gun

1775
01:41:46,101 --> 01:41:47,941
and make this ship go faster!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1776
01:41:49,803 --> 01:41:52,338
Listen up! Crash course.
Tracer guns.

1777
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:54,607
Punch forward to fire,
slide back to reload.

1778
01:41:54,609 --> 01:41:56,542
What?

1779
01:41:56,544 --> 01:41:58,277
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1780
01:41:58,279 --> 01:41:59,679
Wait. What're
you talking about?

1781
01:41:59,681 --> 01:42:00,780
I don't know what he means.
Good luck.

1782
01:42:00,782 --> 01:42:02,181
Where are you going?

1783
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:03,716
To lay some hate.

1784
01:42:11,692 --> 01:42:13,693
(Laughing)

1785
01:42:13,695 --> 01:42:15,194
Say it!
Okay.

1786
01:42:15,196 --> 01:42:16,462
Both: Punch, hold,
slide, repeat.

1787
01:42:16,464 --> 01:42:17,563
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1788
01:42:17,565 --> 01:42:18,565
Go!
(Grunts)

1789
01:42:30,644 --> 01:42:31,644
Yeah, I got one! Whoo!

1790
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:34,747
These alien guns kick ass!

1791
01:42:38,285 --> 01:42:39,852
Come on, he's on us!

1792
01:42:39,854 --> 01:42:41,521
Bee, you gotta move! Duck!

1793
01:42:44,725 --> 01:42:46,259
Cade: Bee, fire the gun!

1794
01:42:55,736 --> 01:42:56,903
(Gasps)

1795
01:42:57,638 --> 01:42:59,338
Bumblebee: <i> Uh-oh!</i>

1796
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,540
Shane: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1797
01:43:04,912 --> 01:43:05,945
(Tessa screaming)

1798
01:43:10,517 --> 01:43:11,584
Cade: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1799
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:16,956
Shane: That was insane!

1800
01:43:16,958 --> 01:43:18,357
Cade: (Exhales)
Tess, you okay?

1801
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:19,559
(Shane groaning)

1802
01:43:24,631 --> 01:43:26,532
(Sizzling)

1803
01:43:27,367 --> 01:43:28,968
Okay. Sir?

1804
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:33,606
You better have insurance!

1805
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:37,276
Insurance?

1806
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:39,979
It's a freaking spaceship.

1807
01:43:39,981 --> 01:43:41,741
You go get insurance
on a freaking spaceship.

1808
01:43:43,717 --> 01:43:45,618
Is this your car? Huh?

1809
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:51,657
Sweetie,
hand me my alien gun.

1810
01:43:51,659 --> 01:43:53,219
Tessa: Here you go.
(Weapon powering up)

1811
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:54,760
(Panting) Come here.

1812
01:43:55,495 --> 01:43:57,296
Trust your dad.
Okay.

1813
01:44:04,438 --> 01:44:06,973
Prepare for interstellar launch.

1814
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:17,950
We're almost ready
to separate.
We're almost there.

1815
01:44:17,952 --> 01:44:20,519
Optimus: Hurry,
he's launching!
All over it, chief.

1816
01:44:20,521 --> 01:44:23,022
Lockdown will be in
deep space before
he realizes I'm gone.

1817
01:44:23,024 --> 01:44:24,523
I'm a sucky pilot,

1818
01:44:24,525 --> 01:44:25,625
but let's give it a whirl.

1819
01:44:25,627 --> 01:44:26,627
Hell, yeah!

1820
01:44:35,636 --> 01:44:38,304
You CIA guys are really subtle.

1821
01:44:38,306 --> 01:44:40,940
What a deft hand. I'm sure
nobody noticed all that.

1822
01:44:40,942 --> 01:44:42,708
Look. In a few minutes,
there are gonna be feds

1823
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:44,277
all over this place,
and I don't want them

1824
01:44:44,279 --> 01:44:45,878
finding our holy grail.

1825
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,380
So we're gonna take all our R&D,

1826
01:44:47,382 --> 01:44:50,016
we're moving it to
our China facility. Yeah.

1827
01:44:50,018 --> 01:44:51,751
I want you to bring me the seed,

1828
01:44:51,753 --> 01:44:54,320
but I want you to
bring it to me there.

1829
01:44:54,322 --> 01:44:56,589
Mr. Joshua,
I would not describe

1830
01:44:56,591 --> 01:44:59,659
your product testing
as perfected.

1831
01:44:59,661 --> 01:45:01,581
We have plenty of time for
improvements in China.

1832
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:05,564
Sir, galvatron. He was...

1833
01:45:05,566 --> 01:45:07,433
Joshua: A fiasco.

1834
01:45:07,435 --> 01:45:10,770
A farrago.
An embarrassment.

1835
01:45:10,772 --> 01:45:13,039
And he spoke.
How did that happen?

1836
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:14,940
Do you know what a flaw
is, wembley? A flaw?

1837
01:45:14,942 --> 01:45:18,744
A flaw is a total failure.

1838
01:45:18,746 --> 01:45:20,946
I did not have control
over my prototype,

1839
01:45:20,948 --> 01:45:23,683
and I want to know why!

1840
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:44,036
Let's give Bumblebee
the good news.

1841
01:45:44,038 --> 01:45:45,738
We got a ship now.
We're leaving.

1842
01:45:46,873 --> 01:45:50,876
You humans.
After all we have done.

1843
01:45:50,878 --> 01:45:53,546
You don't know what you've
wrought upon yourselves.

1844
01:45:53,548 --> 01:45:54,880
Cade: What? What is it now?

1845
01:45:54,882 --> 01:45:56,382
What are you talking about?

1846
01:45:56,384 --> 01:45:57,817
I mean, I'm doing stuff
out of my league here!

1847
01:45:57,819 --> 01:46:01,454
You don't see
who's controlling who.

1848
01:46:01,456 --> 01:46:04,056
Within that manmade
prototype I fought,

1849
01:46:04,058 --> 01:46:06,492
I sensed the presence

1850
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:11,897
What, the decepticon that
started the Chicago war?

1851
01:46:11,899 --> 01:46:13,466
How do you think ksi

1852
01:46:13,468 --> 01:46:14,900
built those bots
in the first place, hmm?

1853
01:46:14,902 --> 01:46:16,902
They had a whole mess of

1854
01:46:16,904 --> 01:46:19,344
<i>dead decepticon heads and they
were downloading their minds!</i>

1855
01:46:20,407 --> 01:46:22,541
<i>And I was in charge
of autopsy duty.</i>

1856
01:46:22,543 --> 01:46:25,378
<i>No union, no benefits,
no nothing.</i>

1857
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:27,546
<i>They hooked me up to Megatron,</i>

1858
01:46:27,548 --> 01:46:29,415
<i>and that mind wasn't
as dead as they thought.</i>

1859
01:46:29,417 --> 01:46:31,550
<i>He fed them the science
and specs!</i>

1860
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,753
<i>All so they could build him
a brand-new body.</i>

1861
01:46:35,589 --> 01:46:38,491
<i>Then he infected it with
his evil, nasty chromosomes.</i>

1862
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:42,695
<i>They had red, beady eyes.</i>
(Exclaims)

1863
01:46:42,697 --> 01:46:43,929
<i>They got all in my lovely locks.</i>

1864
01:46:43,931 --> 01:46:45,664
<i>Oh, I can smell it right now.</i>

1865
01:46:45,666 --> 01:46:47,600
<i>Total inside custom job!</i>

1866
01:46:49,503 --> 01:46:50,970
Ksi might have named the body

1867
01:46:50,972 --> 01:46:53,472
the snappy name of galvatron,

1868
01:46:53,474 --> 01:46:56,609
but that's just
Megatron reincarnated!

1869
01:46:56,611 --> 01:46:58,477
You knew this
and you didn't warn them?

1870
01:46:58,479 --> 01:47:00,846
Little girl, you can go
to a pretty dark place

1871
01:47:00,848 --> 01:47:02,715
when you on death row.

1872
01:47:02,717 --> 01:47:05,785
He's been playing ksi
all this time,

1873
01:47:05,787 --> 01:47:07,620
all so that he could
manipulate them

1874
01:47:07,622 --> 01:47:08,754
into going after the seed.

1875
01:47:08,756 --> 01:47:09,789
(Bell ringing)

1876
01:47:10,757 --> 01:47:12,625
Wait. The seed?

1877
01:47:12,627 --> 01:47:15,094
Those nasty soldiers
that were chasing us.

1878
01:47:15,096 --> 01:47:16,629
<i>I saw them board the ship,
and they took something</i>

1879
01:47:16,631 --> 01:47:18,564
<i>that they called the seed.</i>

1880
01:47:18,566 --> 01:47:19,865
Hound: Listen.
Sixty million years ago,

1881
01:47:19,867 --> 01:47:21,767
give or take an eon...

1882
01:47:21,769 --> 01:47:24,570
Thousands of planets were
cyber-formed with seeds.

1883
01:47:25,138 --> 01:47:26,505
(Chirping)

1884
01:47:28,909 --> 01:47:32,812
<i>They turned your organic life
into our elemental metals.</i>

1885
01:47:34,714 --> 01:47:39,852
<i>Our creators destroyed
your world to make us.</i>

1886
01:47:39,854 --> 01:47:42,688
And that's what galvatron
wants to happen again.

1887
01:47:42,690 --> 01:47:44,490
He wants to detonate that seed

1888
01:47:44,492 --> 01:47:47,126
in the biggest city
and kill millions!

1889
01:47:47,128 --> 01:47:50,796
He's gonna show the world,
"baby, I'm back."

1890
01:47:50,798 --> 01:47:54,934
Optimus: The blast wave
will incinerate that city
into molten metal.

1891
01:47:54,936 --> 01:47:58,137
He'll have enough to build
a massive army

1892
01:47:58,139 --> 01:48:01,874
and annihilate
your species forever.

1893
01:48:01,876 --> 01:48:03,476
You dumb, greedy bastards

1894
01:48:03,478 --> 01:48:05,110
just brought extinction
to yourself.

1895
01:48:05,112 --> 01:48:08,814
I'm free at last.
Whole thing worked out
good for me. I'm walking.

1896
01:48:09,950 --> 01:48:11,884
We got to get the seed
before galvatron does.

1897
01:48:27,667 --> 01:48:30,147
Joshua: <i> The seed</i>
<i>is going to be the</i>
<i>salvation of our company.</i>

1898
01:48:30,770 --> 01:48:33,005
We take delivery tonight.

1899
01:48:33,007 --> 01:48:34,507
And next month,
we detonate safely

1900
01:48:34,509 --> 01:48:35,608
in the Mongolian desert.

1901
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:39,178
And we'll create
enough transformium

1902
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:40,579
for a hundred years.

1903
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:47,786
Dad, I'm tired of
running and stealing.

1904
01:48:47,788 --> 01:48:49,722
Well, a place to sleep.

1905
01:48:49,724 --> 01:48:51,257
Yeah. Just
another break-in.

1906
01:48:57,597 --> 01:48:58,997
Cade: You know,
when I was your age,

1907
01:49:00,033 --> 01:49:02,134
I liked to
get a little wild.
I liked cars, girls.

1908
01:49:02,903 --> 01:49:04,970
(Cade sighs)

1909
01:49:06,673 --> 01:49:09,108
But then there was Tessa.

1910
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:11,143
And when she was born,
all I ever wanted out of life

1911
01:49:11,145 --> 01:49:12,905
was for her to be happy
and healthy and safe.

1912
01:49:14,581 --> 01:49:16,715
Somehow I thought I'd always
be enough to protect her.

1913
01:49:18,718 --> 01:49:20,019
But I won't be.

1914
01:49:20,854 --> 01:49:22,154
I'll never be.

1915
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:25,291
So somebody better be.

1916
01:49:30,931 --> 01:49:32,598
Thanks for being here today,
lucky charms.

1917
01:49:36,136 --> 01:49:38,376
Well, thanks for not shooting
me when you had the chance.

1918
01:49:38,872 --> 01:49:39,872
Oh, I'll have more.

1919
01:49:40,006 --> 01:49:41,006
(Sighs)

1920
01:49:41,808 --> 01:49:43,175
Yeah, I can see that.

1921
01:49:44,811 --> 01:49:48,080
We've intercepted the
encrypted communications.

1922
01:49:48,082 --> 01:49:51,917
Joshua Joyce is
headed to his factory
in guangzhou, China.

1923
01:49:52,752 --> 01:49:54,153
Hey, big shot.

1924
01:49:55,989 --> 01:49:58,057
Your company's
in serious trouble.

1925
01:49:58,059 --> 01:49:59,992
You better have
a damn good lawyer.

1926
01:49:59,994 --> 01:50:01,160
<i>Really? Well,
you better have</i>

1927
01:50:01,162 --> 01:50:02,661
a great one 'cause
you're about to be

1928
01:50:02,663 --> 01:50:04,830
responsible for
the annihilation of a city.

1929
01:50:04,832 --> 01:50:08,701
<i>Your tech has been hacked.
Your prototypes are infected.</i>

1930
01:50:08,703 --> 01:50:11,103
And now galvatron
is after that seed.

1931
01:50:11,105 --> 01:50:12,771
<i>Look. I know you have
a conscience</i>

1932
01:50:12,773 --> 01:50:14,940
<i>because you're
an inventor, like me.</i>

1933
01:50:14,942 --> 01:50:17,343
<i>Do not let galvatron
anywhere near that seed.</i>

1934
01:50:17,345 --> 01:50:19,345
I control galvatron.
I created him.

1935
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:21,714
Deep down, I know you know.

1936
01:50:23,183 --> 01:50:25,084
<i>Your prototype's
been controlling you.</i>

1937
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:31,489
How fast can that thing get us
halfway around the world?

1938
01:50:31,858 --> 01:50:34,360
Very. It's a spaceship.

1939
01:50:37,063 --> 01:50:38,163
(Sirens wailing)

1940
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:54,146
If we're traveling,
now's the time.

1941
01:50:56,316 --> 01:50:58,050
All I want is
to have our life back.

1942
01:50:58,052 --> 01:50:59,372
It's your call.
Whatever you want.

1943
01:51:05,191 --> 01:51:07,191
Are we safer on our own,
or are we safer with them?

1944
01:51:16,403 --> 01:51:17,903
She's a keeper.

1945
01:51:18,972 --> 01:51:20,005
Must take after her mom.

1946
01:51:21,875 --> 01:51:23,742
I can't argue with that, kid.

1947
01:51:25,211 --> 01:51:28,714
Move!
We're retrieving the seed,

1948
01:51:28,716 --> 01:51:31,750
but then we're done
defending the humans.

1949
01:51:31,752 --> 01:51:34,286
What, done?
What do you mean,
you're done?

1950
01:51:34,288 --> 01:51:36,922
Crosshairs: Means "finished,"
"see ya," "good-bye."

1951
01:51:51,371 --> 01:51:53,405
Hijacked part of my ship?

1952
01:51:53,407 --> 01:51:55,974
How did you let this happen?

1953
01:51:55,976 --> 01:51:58,944
Shut down dark-matter drive,
reverse course at light speed,

1954
01:51:58,946 --> 01:52:00,746
and get us back!

1955
01:52:00,748 --> 01:52:03,082
Prime's taken my trophy case.

1956
01:52:03,817 --> 01:52:06,051
And he will feel my wrath!

1957
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:15,494
Welcome to China.

1958
01:52:15,496 --> 01:52:16,962
Put galvatron in containment.
Tell the techs

1959
01:52:16,964 --> 01:52:18,764
do not activate him.

1960
01:52:18,766 --> 01:52:20,406
Absolutely, sir.
(Woman speaking mandarin)

1961
01:52:24,404 --> 01:52:26,739
Joyce.

1962
01:52:26,741 --> 01:52:30,242
I cannot tell you
how enthused I am
to deliver this.

1963
01:52:33,079 --> 01:52:35,814
Top of your alien wish list.

1964
01:52:35,816 --> 01:52:38,751
It's yours. Or rather ours.

1965
01:52:38,753 --> 01:52:39,818
(Laughing)

1966
01:52:41,254 --> 01:52:43,856
I will need to see my advance.

1967
01:52:43,858 --> 01:52:46,358
Attinger: Five million shares
of the company.

1968
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:47,920
Together, we're gonna end
human warfare.

1969
01:52:49,129 --> 01:52:51,530
<i>We're about to build
a fully automated U.S. army.</i>

1970
01:52:51,532 --> 01:52:53,799
<i>Just think of all the American
lives we're gonna save.</i>

1971
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:02,941
(Man speaking mandarin)

1972
01:53:09,249 --> 01:53:11,289
So how soon until
we can start
continuous production?

1973
01:53:23,163 --> 01:53:26,865
You know, why don't we take
a beat on this for a minute?

1974
01:53:28,101 --> 01:53:30,903
I have some new data
that I discovered and...

1975
01:53:30,905 --> 01:53:32,137
You're not backing out
on me here?

1976
01:53:32,139 --> 01:53:33,906
No, I'm not backing out.
I just...

1977
01:53:33,908 --> 01:53:35,140
I want the seed.
I'm not saying I don't

1978
01:53:35,142 --> 01:53:36,875
want the seed.
I'm just saying

1979
01:53:36,877 --> 01:53:40,979
I don't know if I...
If I want the seed right now.

1980
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:43,916
Good men have died trying
to get that thing for us.

1981
01:53:43,918 --> 01:53:45,818
For you.

1982
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:47,886
I know what you did
to get that thing.

1983
01:53:47,888 --> 01:53:50,255
A lot of illegal, icky shit.

1984
01:53:50,257 --> 01:53:51,924
I can take you down,
too, Mr. black ops.

1985
01:53:51,926 --> 01:53:52,926
Don't you threaten me.

1986
01:53:54,127 --> 01:53:56,295
I started this company
when I was a boy,

1987
01:53:56,297 --> 01:53:58,964
with a dream of making
the world a better place.

1988
01:53:58,966 --> 01:54:02,835
Funny. I had
the same dream.

1989
01:54:02,837 --> 01:54:06,305
Somewhere along the way,
you made billions
of dollars.

1990
01:54:06,307 --> 01:54:08,040
So why don't you tell me
what's missing

1991
01:54:08,042 --> 01:54:09,308
from my dream? Why don't
you tell me what's missing

1992
01:54:09,310 --> 01:54:10,442
from my boyhood dream?

1993
01:54:12,212 --> 01:54:15,113
I have served my country
for decades

1994
01:54:15,115 --> 01:54:17,149
of unparalleled prosperity

1995
01:54:17,151 --> 01:54:20,285
and you are my golden parachute.

1996
01:54:20,287 --> 01:54:23,288
So you are damn well jumping
out of the plane with me!

1997
01:54:24,424 --> 01:54:25,624
(Gasping)

1998
01:54:31,464 --> 01:54:32,598
(Workers screaming)

1999
01:54:34,601 --> 01:54:37,069
I am galvatron!

2000
01:54:39,239 --> 01:54:42,608
(Both speaking mandarin)

2001
01:54:42,610 --> 01:54:44,209
What's going on?

2002
01:54:44,211 --> 01:54:45,611
Your galvatron has gone active.

2003
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:49,214
What haven't you
been telling me?

2004
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:51,483
Find Darcy, and bring a car
around downstairs. Quietly.

2005
01:54:53,019 --> 01:54:54,319
We got a factory emergency.

2006
01:54:54,321 --> 01:54:55,954
I have to get you out of here.

2007
01:54:55,956 --> 01:54:58,056
What the hell's going on?
Take them outside.

2008
01:54:58,058 --> 01:54:59,591
We had a deal.
You got what you wanted.

2009
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,227
I got what "it" wanted.

2010
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:09,101
My brothers, today
I grant you your freedom.

2011
01:55:09,103 --> 01:55:13,238
And from now on, you are
commanded by me.

2012
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:15,374
Rise up!

2013
01:55:17,610 --> 01:55:19,945
Go find my seed!

2014
01:55:34,527 --> 01:55:37,496
Detonate the seed
in the largest city.

2015
01:55:40,033 --> 01:55:41,667
Listen, princess. I don't
wanna hear, "I told you so,"

2016
01:55:41,669 --> 01:55:43,135
but this is much more dangerous

2017
01:55:43,137 --> 01:55:44,503
than I think.
Get in.

2018
01:55:48,675 --> 01:55:49,675
(People screaming)

2019
01:55:51,344 --> 01:55:52,678
Galvatron's hacked
into the others.

2020
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:54,680
What?
Joshua.

2021
01:55:54,682 --> 01:55:56,448
You have to contain this!
Drive, drive!

2022
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:57,450
Attinger: Son of a...

2023
01:56:00,653 --> 01:56:02,373
Come on. Let's move,
let's move, let's move!

2024
01:56:18,638 --> 01:56:21,073
I know how to lose them
in Hong Kong.

2025
01:56:21,075 --> 01:56:23,075
I know a military Garrison
there that will help us.

2026
01:56:24,544 --> 01:56:26,478
Threatening a professional
CIA killer.

2027
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:29,314
Possibly not my finest hour.

2028
01:56:29,316 --> 01:56:30,682
I'd like to have that one back.

2029
01:56:30,684 --> 01:56:33,251
Killer? I thought
they were your friends!

2030
01:56:33,253 --> 01:56:35,487
No. Not friends. Business.
They gave me this bomb.

2031
01:56:36,022 --> 01:56:37,689
Bomb?
Oh!

2032
01:56:37,691 --> 01:56:39,324
Is there a bomb in the bag?

2033
01:56:39,326 --> 01:56:40,726
Yes, there's a bomb in the bag.

2034
01:56:41,227 --> 01:56:42,327
Shit.

2035
01:56:53,373 --> 01:56:55,007
Cade: <i> When you said you were</i>
<i>done fighting for humans,</i>

2036
01:56:55,009 --> 01:56:57,209
you didn't mean that,
did you?

2037
01:56:57,211 --> 01:57:00,445
How many more of my kind
must be sacrificed

2038
01:57:00,447 --> 01:57:03,181
to atone for your mistakes?

2039
01:57:03,183 --> 01:57:04,216
Well, what do you think
being human means?

2040
01:57:04,218 --> 01:57:05,218
That's what we do.

2041
01:57:05,752 --> 01:57:07,319
We make mistakes.

2042
01:57:08,454 --> 01:57:09,721
And sometimes out
of those mistakes

2043
01:57:09,723 --> 01:57:11,056
come the most amazing things.

2044
01:57:16,596 --> 01:57:20,198
When I fixed you,
it was for a reward.

2045
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,768
That was it.
That was why. For money.

2046
01:57:24,437 --> 01:57:26,271
And it was me making a mistake.

2047
01:57:27,407 --> 01:57:29,274
Without it,
you wouldn't be here.

2048
01:57:32,412 --> 01:57:34,479
So even if you got
no faith in us,

2049
01:57:34,481 --> 01:57:36,615
I'm asking you to do what I do.

2050
01:57:36,617 --> 01:57:38,977
I'm asking you to look at all
the junk and see the treasure.

2051
01:57:40,286 --> 01:57:43,622
You gotta have faith, prime,
in who we can be.

2052
01:57:56,235 --> 01:57:58,315
I'm seriously pissed we're
not getting paid for this.

2053
01:57:59,338 --> 01:58:01,306
Well, at least
we get to kill him.

2054
01:58:02,675 --> 01:58:04,915
They're not getting away if
I still got him on satellite.

2055
01:58:05,678 --> 01:58:07,846
Some genius.
Thinks he can outrun the CIA.

2056
01:58:09,782 --> 01:58:11,316
Darcy: Joshua?
Joshua: Yes?

2057
01:58:11,318 --> 01:58:12,584
How lethal is that bomb?

2058
01:58:13,653 --> 01:58:14,853
Uh, I don't know.
Let me check.

2059
01:58:17,623 --> 01:58:19,124
(Laughing)

2060
01:58:20,293 --> 01:58:22,160
(Wembley whooping)
(Cell phone ringing)

2061
01:58:22,162 --> 01:58:23,829
I love this! This is
so good. Oh, hang on.

2062
01:58:25,431 --> 01:58:28,800
I'm getting a text from
il duce in Hong Kong.

2063
01:58:28,802 --> 01:58:31,203
"Need to know the seed's
estimated blast range."

2064
01:58:31,205 --> 01:58:32,205
Duh.

2065
01:58:38,311 --> 01:58:39,411
(Brakes screeching)

2066
01:58:41,647 --> 01:58:42,814
I'll do the diversion!

2067
01:58:42,816 --> 01:58:44,483
Get that thing somewhere safe!

2068
01:58:45,284 --> 01:58:46,585
(Both speaking cantonese)

2069
01:58:50,523 --> 01:58:52,003
Killers are coming!
Guys, we gotta go!

2070
01:58:52,558 --> 01:58:54,159
Guys, guys...

2071
01:58:54,161 --> 01:58:55,594
Shut up! Shut up!
All right! I'm sorry!

2072
01:58:55,596 --> 01:58:57,229
All right, go ahead,
go ahead!

2073
01:58:57,231 --> 01:58:58,551
(Both continue
speaking cantonese)

2074
01:58:59,765 --> 01:59:01,867
Okay, good?
No, don't go! Wait!

2075
01:59:03,169 --> 01:59:05,737
Okay, he's in.
Okay, okay, okay.

2076
01:59:06,672 --> 01:59:08,740
I need a raise!
I want a raise.

2077
01:59:08,742 --> 01:59:10,422
All right, yes!
I'm sure whatever you want!

2078
01:59:14,413 --> 01:59:15,413
Joshua: Go, go, go!

2079
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:18,550
Oh, no!

2080
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:23,501
Death is on our tail!
Death is on our tail!

2081
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:33,265
Get out of the way, all of
you! Get out of the way!

2082
01:59:35,468 --> 01:59:37,235
I don't want to die like this.

2083
01:59:46,212 --> 01:59:47,379
(Brakes screeching)

2084
01:59:52,752 --> 01:59:54,252
Box them in.

2085
02:00:05,831 --> 02:00:06,932
(Both groaning)

2086
02:00:08,334 --> 02:00:09,834
Hurry, hurry! Come, come.

2087
02:00:09,836 --> 02:00:12,204
Okay, yes. I'll follow you
anywhere. You're amazing!

2088
02:00:12,206 --> 02:00:13,338
We're going to
get you to the roof.

2089
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:14,340
Good, good.

2090
02:00:18,911 --> 02:00:19,844
(Bell dings)

2091
02:00:19,846 --> 02:00:20,912
Go!

2092
02:00:22,481 --> 02:00:23,481
(Grunts)

2093
02:00:25,318 --> 02:00:26,551
(Sighs)

2094
02:00:28,354 --> 02:00:30,222
(Reading)

2095
02:00:30,556 --> 02:00:31,957
(Laughing)

2096
02:00:31,959 --> 02:00:34,759
Lol. That's funny.

2097
02:00:34,761 --> 02:00:36,861
I can't...
This is really
happening.

2098
02:00:36,863 --> 02:00:41,299
A man, me, who is
worth over 20 billion
dollars is now

2099
02:00:41,301 --> 02:00:44,402
being chased by CIA
assassins. That's the truth.

2100
02:00:45,605 --> 02:00:47,539
(Laughing) And in the middle
of a robot uprising.

2101
02:00:50,643 --> 02:00:53,278
And I'm carrying what is,
in essence, a tactical nuke.

2102
02:00:54,447 --> 02:00:55,947
And the great thing is I...

2103
02:00:55,949 --> 02:00:57,315
The great thing is that I'm...

2104
02:00:57,317 --> 02:00:58,917
I'm barely feeling any jetlag.

2105
02:00:58,919 --> 02:01:00,852
Just stop it!
What?

2106
02:01:00,854 --> 02:01:02,821
You need to hide on
the roof of this building.

2107
02:01:02,823 --> 02:01:04,263
I'll get you
a helicopter extraction.

2108
02:01:06,859 --> 02:01:07,859
Okay.

2109
02:01:09,829 --> 02:01:10,829
(Sighs)

2110
02:01:11,330 --> 02:01:12,464
I like her.

2111
02:01:13,466 --> 02:01:14,766
I find her very attractive.

2112
02:01:16,702 --> 02:01:18,222
Mercenary: He's
definitely around here.

2113
02:01:18,904 --> 02:01:20,405
Come on, come on.

2114
02:01:20,407 --> 02:01:21,606
(Exhales)

2115
02:01:22,441 --> 02:01:23,708
I got a bike!

2116
02:01:24,410 --> 02:01:26,711
Check in there!

2117
02:01:26,713 --> 02:01:28,473
These are the CIA assassins
I told you about.

2118
02:01:31,517 --> 02:01:33,885
Whoa! Guys.
Mercenary: Let's go.

2119
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:36,321
Hello.

2120
02:01:42,862 --> 02:01:44,396
Hey! Okay.

2121
02:01:51,704 --> 02:01:53,338
Pick it up.
All right. I'm gonna.

2122
02:01:53,739 --> 02:01:55,640
(Groaning)

2123
02:02:06,752 --> 02:02:07,886
Wow.

2124
02:02:09,422 --> 02:02:13,325
Wow. Wow, thank you.
Wow! How did you...

2125
02:02:13,327 --> 02:02:15,026
Police training,
prior to my mba.

2126
02:02:15,995 --> 02:02:17,062
I love you.

2127
02:02:18,698 --> 02:02:19,698
Get to the roof.

2128
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:21,032
All right, okay.

2129
02:02:34,347 --> 02:02:35,380
(Grunting)

2130
02:02:48,594 --> 02:02:49,828
(Sighing)

2131
02:02:51,831 --> 02:02:52,831
Mmm!

2132
02:03:16,021 --> 02:03:19,557
Find my seed. It's here!

2133
02:03:19,559 --> 02:03:21,126
Those prototypes are
after that bomb.

2134
02:03:29,869 --> 02:03:30,869
No!

2135
02:03:31,771 --> 02:03:33,571
No, no, no, no!

2136
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:38,690
Who the hell's aboard that?

2137
02:03:39,111 --> 02:03:40,612
Impossible.

2138
02:03:41,714 --> 02:03:43,148
(People chattering excitedly)

2139
02:03:48,821 --> 02:03:52,891
Brothers, it's the autobots!
Shoot them down!

2140
02:03:58,497 --> 02:03:59,731
Cade: Joshua!

2141
02:03:59,733 --> 02:04:00,899
Hound: Hey, baldy!

2142
02:04:00,901 --> 02:04:02,734
Hey, it's me! Hey!

2143
02:04:02,736 --> 02:04:03,856
Bring it over now! Let's go.

2144
02:04:04,737 --> 02:04:06,971
Hurry up, run!

2145
02:04:06,973 --> 02:04:08,940
Hurry! Come on!
Hound: Let's go! Move it!

2146
02:04:08,942 --> 02:04:10,909
Guys! Come on.
Give it to me now!

2147
02:04:12,011 --> 02:04:13,571
Hound: Looks like
we might have company.

2148
02:04:19,819 --> 02:04:21,152
(Speaking alien language)

2149
02:04:22,188 --> 02:04:23,755
(Groans)

2150
02:04:23,757 --> 02:04:25,023
Hound: We're hit! We're hit!

2151
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:54,018
Attinger: They live,
they talk, we're dead.

2152
02:04:54,887 --> 02:04:55,887
Kill them all.

2153
02:04:55,889 --> 02:04:56,889
Pleasure.

2154
02:04:59,592 --> 02:05:01,226
Hound: I count ten below!

2155
02:05:02,928 --> 02:05:04,996
I thought you said
you had one prototype
get infected.

2156
02:05:04,998 --> 02:05:06,898
Now he's got
operational control
of my other 50.

2157
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:07,900
Come on.

2158
02:05:09,902 --> 02:05:11,836
Climb, climb!

2159
02:05:12,505 --> 02:05:14,172
Surround them.

2160
02:05:19,078 --> 02:05:20,845
I may have started
the apocalypse,

2161
02:05:20,847 --> 02:05:22,247
but you brought your family.

2162
02:05:22,249 --> 02:05:24,282
And that's, you know,
terrible parenting.

2163
02:05:24,284 --> 02:05:26,184
Oh, I'm about one
second away from
knocking you out,

2164
02:05:26,186 --> 02:05:27,285
taking the bomb,
and just leaving
you here.

2165
02:05:27,287 --> 02:05:28,553
Please,
do me a favor.

2166
02:05:29,188 --> 02:05:31,856
Optimus, autobots,
you alive?

2167
02:05:31,858 --> 02:05:33,018
Come on, bitch!
Cade: Come on!

2168
02:05:33,926 --> 02:05:34,926
(Cade grunts)

2169
02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:46,704
Hound: Evac! Evac!

2170
02:05:46,706 --> 02:05:47,872
We're getting flanked!

2171
02:05:49,875 --> 02:05:51,009
We got company below!

2172
02:05:52,845 --> 02:05:54,913
Oh!

2173
02:05:54,915 --> 02:05:57,682
(Grunts)
My fat ass is stuck!
Bee, take the shot!

2174
02:06:04,189 --> 02:06:05,256
Oh!

2175
02:06:07,326 --> 02:06:08,726
(Elevator bell dings)

2176
02:06:08,728 --> 02:06:10,061
Into the elevator! Get in.
Okay.

2177
02:06:10,063 --> 02:06:11,063
Come on.

2178
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:15,600
Get down,
get down!

2179
02:06:16,869 --> 02:06:18,069
Close the door!
Close the door!

2180
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:22,740
(Alarm blaring)
Won't go! It's not closing!

2181
02:06:22,742 --> 02:06:24,576
There's too much weight.

2182
02:06:24,578 --> 02:06:26,010
Get back down
to Bumblebee!
Dad, no!

2183
02:06:26,012 --> 02:06:28,279
Hey! You want me!

2184
02:06:39,024 --> 02:06:40,091
Center elevator.

2185
02:06:40,093 --> 02:06:41,225
<i>Center elevator.</i>

2186
02:06:42,661 --> 02:06:44,062
(All panting)

2187
02:06:45,931 --> 02:06:47,265
He's gonna be okay.

2188
02:06:49,101 --> 02:06:51,002
(People screaming)

2189
02:06:53,672 --> 02:06:54,706
(Bell dings)

2190
02:06:57,776 --> 02:06:58,776
(Screaming)

2191
02:07:00,946 --> 02:07:03,381
Alien bomb! Alien bomb,
coming through!

2192
02:07:03,383 --> 02:07:05,350
Clear the way!
Clear the... hi, kids.

2193
02:07:05,352 --> 02:07:07,218
Coming through, ladies!

2194
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:09,320
Excuse me!
Excuse me, ladies!
Excuse me!

2195
02:07:09,322 --> 02:07:11,155
Oh, my God!

2196
02:07:11,157 --> 02:07:13,357
How do you say,
"get the fuck out of
the way" in Chinese?

2197
02:07:43,922 --> 02:07:45,056
Ahhh!

2198
02:07:55,367 --> 02:07:56,401
(Panting)

2199
02:07:57,703 --> 02:07:59,771
Savoy: That's a long way down.

2200
02:08:00,339 --> 02:08:01,439
(Grunting)

2201
02:08:02,941 --> 02:08:04,061
You've got to be kidding me.

2202
02:08:05,944 --> 02:08:07,011
No!
(Grunts)

2203
02:08:20,059 --> 02:08:21,059
Come on.

2204
02:08:28,967 --> 02:08:30,168
Whoa!
(Panting)

2205
02:08:31,403 --> 02:08:32,704
(Gasping)

2206
02:08:33,172 --> 02:08:34,305
I'm coming for you!

2207
02:08:40,813 --> 02:08:42,346
(Both grunting)

2208
02:08:50,756 --> 02:08:51,756
(Screams)

2209
02:08:59,832 --> 02:09:00,832
(Groaning)

2210
02:09:05,003 --> 02:09:06,137
(Panting)

2211
02:09:10,175 --> 02:09:12,210
Never should have
hidden that truck.

2212
02:09:12,212 --> 02:09:14,078
You should have never
came after my family.

2213
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:16,347
Tough luck, yeager.
We all have family.

2214
02:09:17,516 --> 02:09:18,956
Yeah, but I'm gonna
live to see mine.

2215
02:09:29,027 --> 02:09:30,161
(Screams)

2216
02:09:39,037 --> 02:09:40,171
(Panting)

2217
02:09:43,008 --> 02:09:45,510
Lockdown on radio:
<i>Where is my escaped bounty?</i>

2218
02:09:45,512 --> 02:09:47,111
Autobots at this location.

2219
02:09:47,946 --> 02:09:49,380
Prime is close.

2220
02:09:51,350 --> 02:09:52,950
Do whatever you have to do.

2221
02:09:54,353 --> 02:09:55,853
I intend to.

2222
02:09:58,824 --> 02:10:00,792
Darcy!
Joshua!

2223
02:10:00,794 --> 02:10:01,526
Shane: We got three more
coming in from that way!

2224
02:10:01,528 --> 02:10:02,994
Cade: Bee, where's Tessa?

2225
02:10:04,163 --> 02:10:05,163
Dad!

2226
02:10:08,333 --> 02:10:09,934
We got a real
dilemma here. Okay?

2227
02:10:09,936 --> 02:10:12,036
I created incredible robots.

2228
02:10:12,038 --> 02:10:14,438
It's all designed
to kick that fat
transformer's ass.

2229
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:16,974
So, really, this is
a no-win situation.

2230
02:10:16,976 --> 02:10:18,276
It's over.

2231
02:10:18,278 --> 02:10:20,044
That was mean.

2232
02:10:20,046 --> 02:10:23,414
Hey! I'm sorry
if you can't handle
the cold-hearted truth!

2233
02:10:23,416 --> 02:10:25,983
Hound: <i> Optimus, what are</i>
<i>my orders with these humans?</i>

2234
02:10:25,985 --> 02:10:27,185
<i>Can I squish the bald guy?</i>

2235
02:10:27,187 --> 02:10:28,886
They're in trouble.

2236
02:10:28,888 --> 02:10:30,922
Nah! This isn't
our fight!

2237
02:10:30,924 --> 02:10:33,591
I'm done being
an underdog.
Underdogs suck!

2238
02:10:33,593 --> 02:10:35,359
I say they get
what they deserve.

2239
02:10:35,361 --> 02:10:37,094
What's the play, prime?

2240
02:10:37,096 --> 02:10:39,564
It's time for reinforcements.

2241
02:10:42,334 --> 02:10:45,236
Recognize one of your knights.

2242
02:10:48,207 --> 02:10:49,540
(Grunts)

2243
02:11:01,620 --> 02:11:03,321
(Growls)

2244
02:11:05,858 --> 02:11:07,138
(Optimus speaking
alien language)

2245
02:11:08,961 --> 02:11:10,428
(People screaming)

2246
02:11:15,601 --> 02:11:16,601
Come on.

2247
02:11:18,570 --> 02:11:20,271
All right, come on!
Come on, let's go!

2248
02:11:20,572 --> 02:11:21,606
Bee, go!

2249
02:11:26,311 --> 02:11:28,212
Come on, we got to move!
Let's go, move!

2250
02:11:32,584 --> 02:11:34,919
Where's Tessa?
Tessa, get over here!
Come on.

2251
02:11:34,921 --> 02:11:36,020
Get over here!

2252
02:11:37,122 --> 02:11:39,123
Hound: Stay behind me!
I'm covering you!

2253
02:11:39,125 --> 02:11:41,359
If I stop covering you,
it means I'm dead.

2254
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:42,481
But that ain't gonna happen.

2255
02:11:43,595 --> 02:11:44,962
Take that!

2256
02:11:47,532 --> 02:11:49,634
I'm a wicked warrior robot!

2257
02:11:50,535 --> 02:11:52,003
Goddamn!

2258
02:11:52,005 --> 02:11:53,045
Come on!
We gotta move now!

2259
02:11:54,573 --> 02:11:55,573
Go, go!

2260
02:11:56,675 --> 02:11:58,109
(Screaming continues)

2261
02:12:02,347 --> 02:12:03,981
We got hostiles
coming down the street!

2262
02:12:05,984 --> 02:12:06,984
Go!

2263
02:12:12,090 --> 02:12:13,658
Bee! Twelve o'clock!
Cover fire!

2264
02:12:18,330 --> 02:12:19,597
Joshua: We're surrounded!

2265
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:20,599
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

2266
02:12:21,133 --> 02:12:22,133
Rocket!

2267
02:12:23,068 --> 02:12:24,201
Go, go, go!

2268
02:12:24,203 --> 02:12:25,269
Get down!

2269
02:12:28,674 --> 02:12:30,107
Oh, this is the
perfect place to hide.

2270
02:12:30,109 --> 02:12:31,575
A big glass box!

2271
02:12:31,577 --> 02:12:32,977
Nobody will ever find us here!

2272
02:12:32,979 --> 02:12:33,979
That's...
(Grumbling)

2273
02:12:36,949 --> 02:12:39,717
You've got to be kidding me.

2274
02:12:39,719 --> 02:12:43,955
Legendary warriors,
the powers
that created us

2275
02:12:43,957 --> 02:12:47,058
now want us all extinguished.

2276
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:50,995
We must join forces,
or else forever
be their slaves.

2277
02:12:52,497 --> 02:12:55,967
So today you stand with us...

2278
02:12:55,969 --> 02:12:59,337
...or you stand
against me.

2279
02:13:00,339 --> 02:13:01,439
(Roaring)

2280
02:13:03,375 --> 02:13:04,542
(Grunting)

2281
02:13:06,645 --> 02:13:08,312
We'll let prime
figure this one out.

2282
02:13:08,314 --> 02:13:10,147
Very wise.

2283
02:13:10,149 --> 02:13:12,350
There's no friggin'
way I'm staying down
here with them.

2284
02:13:12,352 --> 02:13:13,451
No way. No way.

2285
02:13:19,257 --> 02:13:22,660
Only together can we survive!

2286
02:13:22,662 --> 02:13:24,328
(Grunts)

2287
02:13:24,330 --> 02:13:25,463
Let me lead you!

2288
02:13:37,509 --> 02:13:39,243
Oh, no.

2289
02:13:39,245 --> 02:13:41,445
I was expecting a giant car.

2290
02:13:41,447 --> 02:13:42,513
Optimus:
Come here!

2291
02:13:47,219 --> 02:13:49,186
(Roaring)

2292
02:13:49,188 --> 02:13:51,288
We're giving you freedom.

2293
02:13:51,290 --> 02:13:52,356
(Grunts)

2294
02:13:53,692 --> 02:13:55,226
(Screeching)

2295
02:14:07,539 --> 02:14:10,141
You defend my family,

2296
02:14:12,177 --> 02:14:13,711
or die.

2297
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:16,814
(Roaring)

2298
02:14:16,816 --> 02:14:18,749
Autobots,

2299
02:14:18,751 --> 02:14:21,585
we're going to prove who we are

2300
02:14:21,587 --> 02:14:23,187
and why we're here!

2301
02:14:24,623 --> 02:14:27,458
Ugh, you just want
to die for the guy.

2302
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:30,461
That's leadership.
Or brainwashing,
or something.

2303
02:14:30,463 --> 02:14:33,798
No. That's
optimus prime.

2304
02:14:40,372 --> 02:14:42,673
Autobots, we charge together!

2305
02:14:44,409 --> 02:14:45,743
Now, roll out!

2306
02:14:49,247 --> 02:14:51,447
We're getting boxed in!
We're getting
flanked everywhere!

2307
02:14:51,450 --> 02:14:52,783
Help me out here!

2308
02:14:52,785 --> 02:14:53,785
Kill anything that moves!

2309
02:14:55,153 --> 02:14:56,754
Come on, cade, shoot!

2310
02:14:58,657 --> 02:15:00,424
Come and get some,
you little bitch!

2311
02:15:00,426 --> 02:15:01,559
Incoming!
(Grunts)

2312
02:15:04,362 --> 02:15:06,597
(Growling in frustration)

2313
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:08,332
I can't believe I'm putting
my life in your hands.

2314
02:15:08,334 --> 02:15:12,536
No, I don't want the gun.
Then stay under there

2315
02:15:12,538 --> 02:15:14,305
and shut up!
All right.

2316
02:15:14,307 --> 02:15:16,227
Joshua: You're good
with the gun. So you keep it.

2317
02:15:19,778 --> 02:15:21,846
Running out of guns and ammo.

2318
02:15:21,848 --> 02:15:22,848
Ow!

2319
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:24,648
(Grunts)

2320
02:15:26,151 --> 02:15:27,151
(Groans)

2321
02:15:30,255 --> 02:15:33,157
Come and get some!

2322
02:15:33,159 --> 02:15:35,559
You're all gonna die!

2323
02:15:55,313 --> 02:15:56,547
(Screams)

2324
02:15:56,549 --> 02:15:57,781
Hound: Way to go, baby!

2325
02:15:59,184 --> 02:16:00,351
Good shooting, cade!

2326
02:16:02,454 --> 02:16:05,456
I'm like a fat ballerina

2327
02:16:05,458 --> 02:16:07,791
who takes scalps
and slits throats!

2328
02:16:14,933 --> 02:16:16,600
Got your fortune cookie!

2329
02:16:18,637 --> 02:16:19,677
Come here,
you little punk.

2330
02:16:23,508 --> 02:16:26,810
Pull the pin!
I'm dying out here!

2331
02:16:26,812 --> 02:16:28,312
Here! Take it. Take it!

2332
02:16:28,314 --> 02:16:30,347
Hound: Little help!
Little help!
(Ticking)

2333
02:16:30,349 --> 02:16:31,815
It's live! It's live,
it's live. Take it!

2334
02:16:31,817 --> 02:16:32,850
What do you want
me to do with it?

2335
02:16:32,852 --> 02:16:34,385
Just throw it!
Give, give, give!

2336
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:50,568
Hound: Got some
bad news, cade.

2337
02:16:50,570 --> 02:16:53,270
I'm out of ammo
and out of ideas.

2338
02:17:01,513 --> 02:17:02,613
(Grunts)

2339
02:17:02,615 --> 02:17:04,515
Faster! Go!

2340
02:17:07,686 --> 02:17:09,286
(Yelling)
(Roaring)

2341
02:17:12,224 --> 02:17:13,424
I'll kill you!

2342
02:17:31,543 --> 02:17:32,576
(Grunting)

2343
02:17:42,787 --> 02:17:44,455
Charge!

2344
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:58,669
No, impossible!

2345
02:17:58,671 --> 02:18:00,571
They're ruining everything!

2346
02:18:01,673 --> 02:18:02,673
Take that!

2347
02:18:05,910 --> 02:18:07,511
(Groaning)

2348
02:18:10,482 --> 02:18:11,482
Get off me.

2349
02:18:13,551 --> 02:18:15,352
Get up, hound!
Hound: I can't go on.

2350
02:18:15,354 --> 02:18:16,754
But you gotta keep fighting!

2351
02:18:16,756 --> 02:18:18,022
Tank's empty, bro.

2352
02:18:19,591 --> 02:18:20,824
There's more of 'em coming.
If you don't get up

2353
02:18:20,826 --> 02:18:22,386
and fight, we're
going to die. Let's go!

2354
02:18:22,661 --> 02:18:23,661
(Screeching)

2355
02:18:27,332 --> 02:18:28,632
Attack!

2356
02:18:32,871 --> 02:18:34,405
Hound: Optimus is here!

2357
02:18:45,684 --> 02:18:47,051
Optimus:
Bee, jump!

2358
02:18:48,019 --> 02:18:49,453
(Roaring)

2359
02:19:02,701 --> 02:19:03,901
(All grunting)

2360
02:19:09,874 --> 02:19:10,941
(Roars)

2361
02:19:36,067 --> 02:19:37,434
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

2362
02:20:06,064 --> 02:20:07,998
(Roars)

2363
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,600
<i>I hate cheap knockoffs.</i>

2364
02:20:12,003 --> 02:20:12,936
Joshua:
Awesome job!

2365
02:20:12,938 --> 02:20:15,105
You.
Who?

2366
02:20:15,107 --> 02:20:16,573
You.
Optimus: Step forward.

2367
02:20:16,575 --> 02:20:18,175
Wait. Why?

2368
02:20:18,177 --> 02:20:22,613
Your science will
be responsible for
humanity's extinction.

2369
02:20:22,615 --> 02:20:24,815
All right. I know
that you're sensitive

2370
02:20:24,817 --> 02:20:27,718
to this whole
bioethical dilemma.

2371
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:29,086
Maybe all he wants
to hear you say is

2372
02:20:29,088 --> 02:20:30,421
that some things
should never
be invented.

2373
02:20:30,423 --> 02:20:31,555
Ahhh!
(Roaring)

2374
02:20:33,725 --> 02:20:34,792
(High-pitched
screaming)

2375
02:20:34,794 --> 02:20:36,727
Okay.

2376
02:20:36,729 --> 02:20:38,462
We'll lead you out of the city.

2377
02:20:38,464 --> 02:20:40,597
Get that seed
safely to the hills.

2378
02:20:41,499 --> 02:20:43,033
Drift: Use this car.

2379
02:20:43,035 --> 02:20:44,035
Joshua:
He almost ate me!

2380
02:20:45,904 --> 02:20:47,104
(Engine starting)

2381
02:20:47,106 --> 02:20:48,205
All right, we're good!

2382
02:20:49,140 --> 02:20:50,140
All right,
let's go!

2383
02:20:52,477 --> 02:20:53,557
Shane:
Get out of that seat.

2384
02:20:55,079 --> 02:20:56,613
And you're one lucky
dad to have me.

2385
02:20:58,817 --> 02:21:00,937
Okay, lucky charms. You got
that. You drive. Let's go.

2386
02:21:10,929 --> 02:21:12,529
(Both gasp)

2387
02:21:12,531 --> 02:21:16,500
I don't know. I don't know,
but it's an issue.

2388
02:21:16,502 --> 02:21:17,534
Did you press a button?
Is it gonna blow up?

2389
02:21:17,536 --> 02:21:19,136
I don't know.

2390
02:21:19,138 --> 02:21:20,938
Your thing is beeping
now, so you must
have hit something.

2391
02:21:20,940 --> 02:21:23,106
Is it gonna blow up?
I don't know!

2392
02:21:23,108 --> 02:21:24,775
A bomb starts beeping,
that might signal a problem,
you think?

2393
02:21:24,777 --> 02:21:27,978
I'm just saying
that it's a steady
blinking light,

2394
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:29,380
which could be
a timer of some kind.

2395
02:21:30,648 --> 02:21:32,082
Unless it's signaling location.

2396
02:21:33,651 --> 02:21:34,718
To who?

2397
02:21:41,626 --> 02:21:43,126
(Speaking cantonese)

2398
02:21:43,128 --> 02:21:45,195
We've got to call the
central government for help!

2399
02:21:45,197 --> 02:21:46,197
(All speaking cantonese)

2400
02:21:50,268 --> 02:21:52,169
Lockdown:
Optimus prime.

2401
02:21:53,838 --> 02:21:56,039
Come to me.

2402
02:22:05,517 --> 02:22:07,117
(Vocalizing)
(Pop music playing on radio)

2403
02:22:14,926 --> 02:22:15,926
(Exclaims)

2404
02:22:23,635 --> 02:22:24,635
(All screaming)

2405
02:22:46,658 --> 02:22:48,025
(Crowd exclaiming)

2406
02:22:55,099 --> 02:22:56,099

2407
02:22:59,604 --> 02:23:00,604
(Speaking mandarin)

2408
02:23:01,606 --> 02:23:03,140
(All speaking mandarin)

2409
02:23:14,786 --> 02:23:15,786
There's the bridge.

2410
02:23:17,889 --> 02:23:19,022
(All roaring)

2411
02:23:23,895 --> 02:23:24,895
(All shouting)

2412
02:23:28,833 --> 02:23:30,767
(All screaming)

2413
02:23:34,606 --> 02:23:36,173
All: Back it up! Back it up!

2414
02:23:36,175 --> 02:23:37,815
Go, go, go, go!
Back up! Go back! Go back!

2415
02:23:38,776 --> 02:23:41,645
Shane: Move! Get out
of the way. I can't see!

2416
02:23:41,647 --> 02:23:43,287
Shane, drive faster!
Okay, just calm down.

2417
02:23:55,927 --> 02:23:57,567
Tessa: Shane, watch out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

2418
02:24:00,765 --> 02:24:02,099
Get cover!
Back up! Back! Back up!

2419
02:24:03,368 --> 02:24:04,401
(Groans)

2420
02:24:07,705 --> 02:24:09,106
Autobots, fall back!

2421
02:24:14,078 --> 02:24:15,912
Come on, move! Out of my way!
Get out of the way!

2422
02:24:15,914 --> 02:24:17,394
Look out!
Just hit them!
Just hit them!

2423
02:24:24,288 --> 02:24:25,989
(Roaring)

2424
02:24:37,168 --> 02:24:38,869
It's a big magnet!

2425
02:24:38,871 --> 02:24:40,351
It's sucking up metal
and dropping it!

2426
02:24:43,408 --> 02:24:44,675
Joshua: Oh!

2427
02:24:45,209 --> 02:24:46,309
(Panting)

2428
02:24:47,346 --> 02:24:50,347
Get out of the way!
It's coming! It's coming!

2429
02:24:50,349 --> 02:24:52,115
It's coming closer!

2430
02:24:52,117 --> 02:24:53,117
Go faster, Shane!

2431
02:24:58,222 --> 02:24:59,690
Watch out!
Joshua: Look out!

2432
02:25:00,124 --> 02:25:01,124
Whoa!

2433
02:25:03,895 --> 02:25:04,895
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2434
02:25:06,164 --> 02:25:08,098
Oh, no, now it's circling
back towards us! Hard right!

2435
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:09,100
Take a hard right!

2436
02:25:09,734 --> 02:25:10,734
(All shouting)

2437
02:25:11,002 --> 02:25:13,236
Oh, my God!

(All panting)

2439
02:25:28,419 --> 02:25:31,088
Oh, no. No, the magnet.
Get out, get out!

2440
02:25:31,090 --> 02:25:32,255
Come on!
Come here! Get out!

2441
02:25:33,791 --> 02:25:35,358
(Yelping)

2442
02:25:35,360 --> 02:25:37,027
Joshua: No, no, no! No,
we're going up. Grab the bomb!

2443
02:25:37,029 --> 02:25:38,729
Help me grab the bomb!

2444
02:25:38,731 --> 02:25:39,930
Shane: I can't get
the seat belt off!

2445
02:25:39,932 --> 02:25:41,398
Joshua: Pull me down!
Catch me!

2446
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:43,066
I'm going up! I'm going up!

2447
02:25:43,068 --> 02:25:44,768
Get me! Grab me!

2448
02:25:44,770 --> 02:25:46,236
(All grunting)

2449
02:25:46,238 --> 02:25:48,205
Pull me down! Pull me!

2450
02:25:48,207 --> 02:25:49,406
Shane: I can't
get the seat belt off!

2451
02:25:49,408 --> 02:25:50,874
I can't get the belt off!

2452
02:25:52,176 --> 02:25:53,410
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

2453
02:25:55,012 --> 02:25:56,413
Cade: Hold the bomb!
I can't hold on!

2454
02:25:56,415 --> 02:25:58,515
(Grunting)
Pull!

2455
02:25:58,517 --> 02:25:59,950
Guys, it's crushing me!

2456
02:26:00,418 --> 02:26:02,085

(All yelping)

Car!

2459
02:26:13,765 --> 02:26:14,798
Move!

2460
02:26:18,536 --> 02:26:20,170
Shane!

2461
02:26:20,172 --> 02:26:21,505
Shane!
I'm good! I'm good.

2462
02:26:22,406 --> 02:26:23,406
I'm good.

Bumblebee!

Bumblebee:
<i>Hey, you guys!</i>

2465
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:37,020
<i>Yee-hah!</i>

2466
02:26:37,022 --> 02:26:38,022
Come on.

2467
02:26:39,857 --> 02:26:40,857
Go find someplace safe.

2468
02:26:41,159 --> 02:26:42,259
I'm proud of you.

2469
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:49,900
(Screeching)

2470
02:26:56,841 --> 02:26:57,841

(Roaring)

2472
02:27:03,181 --> 02:27:04,181
Cade!

2473
02:27:06,484 --> 02:27:09,986
Autobots, get this
bomb over the bridge
and out of the city!

2474
02:27:09,988 --> 02:27:10,988
Dad!

2475
02:27:12,256 --> 02:27:13,256
What? Come on.

(People screaming)

2484
02:28:09,881 --> 02:28:11,181
I got it!

2485
02:28:11,183 --> 02:28:12,148
I'm getting this
bomb out of here!

2486
02:28:12,150 --> 02:28:13,183
Give me the gun.

2487

It's you and me now!

Look, optimus is
out there all alone.

What? You can't
help him.

2490
02:28:25,530 --> 02:28:26,997
I have to, Tess.
He came back for us.

2491
02:28:26,999 --> 02:28:28,398
Dad, don't leave, please.

2492
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:29,933
Look, I'll find you,
I'll get there, okay?

2493
02:28:29,935 --> 02:28:31,601
Dad, no, you'll die!

2494
02:28:31,603 --> 02:28:33,370
You gotta stay
with Shane.
You're gonna be okay.

2495
02:28:33,372 --> 02:28:36,539
Rest of her life,
until the end of time!
Promise me!

2496
02:28:36,541 --> 02:28:38,975
I promise you.

You're the best thing
I ever made, Tess.

2498
02:28:40,412 --> 02:28:42,245
All right, don't ever forget
it, it was always you.

2499
02:28:42,247 --> 02:28:43,380
I love you.
Please.

2500
02:28:44,248 --> 02:28:45,448
Get in the car, now.

2501
02:28:45,450 --> 02:28:46,516

<i>You better listen.</i>
No, you listen.

2506
02:29:30,194 --> 02:29:31,728
I'm not leaving my dad.

2507

Crosshairs: All right,
we're gonna hold the line,

2508
02:29:46,378 --> 02:29:47,378
then block the bridge!

(Groans)

2511
02:30:16,374 --> 02:30:18,675
You see, it takes
patience to make a man.

2512
02:30:18,677 --> 02:30:20,643
The patience to watch and wait,

2513
02:30:20,645 --> 02:30:22,212
to protect all of us, quietly,

2514
02:30:22,214 --> 02:30:23,713
for God and country,

2515
02:30:23,715 --> 02:30:24,955
without any recognition at all!

Cade!

2517
02:30:32,057 --> 02:30:35,025
There are no good aliens!
Or bad aliens, yeager.

2518
02:30:35,659 --> 02:30:38,361
It's just us and them.

2519
02:30:38,363 --> 02:30:39,496
And you chose them.

2520
02:30:42,433 --> 02:30:43,466
(Panting)

2521
02:30:46,070 --> 02:30:47,070
Anytime.

2522
02:30:54,445 --> 02:30:55,645
(Groaning)

2523
02:30:59,116 --> 02:31:02,185
You saved the
human instead of
saving yourself?

2524
02:31:02,187 --> 02:31:04,254
You bring shame upon us all.

2525
02:31:06,657 --> 02:31:07,657
(Optimus grunts)

2526
02:31:19,670 --> 02:31:21,538
She never listens. Never.

2527
02:31:25,142 --> 02:31:26,810
Optimus: I gave
you an order!

2528
02:31:40,825 --> 02:31:41,825
Get out of here, now!

2529
02:31:42,660 --> 02:31:43,660
Get in. Get in.

2530
02:31:44,261 --> 02:31:46,296
Hey, you! Hey!

2531
02:31:48,466 --> 02:31:51,668
Cade, get out of here!
This is my fight!

2532
02:31:55,106 --> 02:31:57,507
It's my fight,

2533
02:31:57,509 --> 02:31:58,741
and you're all gonna die!

2534
02:32:04,815 --> 02:32:05,815
(Panting)

2535
02:32:08,385 --> 02:32:09,752
Go! Go!

2536
02:32:10,621 --> 02:32:11,821
Come on! Come on!

2537
02:32:11,823 --> 02:32:13,323
(Grunting)

2538
02:32:18,429 --> 02:32:19,762
Yeah! Killer robot, my ass!

2539
02:32:24,735 --> 02:32:25,735
(Groans)

2540
02:32:28,139 --> 02:32:29,139
Whoo!

2541
02:32:38,215 --> 02:32:39,215
Come on.

2542
02:32:47,391 --> 02:32:48,691
Get away,
all of you!

2543
02:32:48,693 --> 02:32:50,460
(Grunts)

2544
02:32:50,462 --> 02:32:52,142
Come on, Tess.
Come on, Tess.
Come on, Tess.

2545
02:32:58,169 --> 02:32:59,169
(Continues grunting)

2546
02:32:59,837 --> 02:33:00,837
Drive!

2547
02:33:04,241 --> 02:33:06,543
You see my face,
your life is done!
Oh!

2548
02:33:06,545 --> 02:33:07,585
Come on, come on, come on!

2549
02:33:08,846 --> 02:33:09,946
(Yells)

2550
02:33:24,228 --> 02:33:25,228
Yeah!

2551
02:33:27,198 --> 02:33:29,232
Honor to the end.

2552
02:33:31,368 --> 02:33:32,435
You still happy we met?

2553
02:33:37,708 --> 02:33:38,708
Always.

2554
02:33:41,478 --> 02:33:42,712
(Speaking alien language)

2555
02:33:46,417 --> 02:33:47,417
Optimus: Hurry!

2556
02:33:49,253 --> 02:33:51,487
Quickly! I'm setting off
lockdown's grenade!

2557
02:33:51,489 --> 02:33:52,489
Hold tight!

2558
02:33:53,457 --> 02:33:54,724
(Electronic whirring)

2559
02:34:09,406 --> 02:34:12,342
We shall meet again, prime,

2560
02:34:12,344 --> 02:34:14,577
for I am reborn.

2561
02:34:23,487 --> 02:34:24,721
(Both panting)

2562
02:34:30,694 --> 02:34:32,334
Kind of nice being
your hero for a change.

2563
02:34:33,697 --> 02:34:34,931
(Softly) You always were.

2564
02:34:34,933 --> 02:34:36,032
All my life.

2565
02:34:37,701 --> 02:34:38,701
I love you.

2566
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:43,920
Let's go home
to graduation, huh?

2567
02:34:44,808 --> 02:34:45,808
Yeah.

2568
02:34:46,577 --> 02:34:48,645
Cade: You're okay, kid.

2569
02:34:48,647 --> 02:34:50,407
Come here,
you're all right.
You're all right.

2570
02:34:54,585 --> 02:34:56,619
We don't have a home, dad.

2571
02:34:56,621 --> 02:34:57,654
It blew up.

2572
02:35:02,526 --> 02:35:04,360
I might be able to
help you with that.

2573
02:35:10,634 --> 02:35:11,768
Optimus: Brave warriors...

2574
02:35:11,770 --> 02:35:12,935
(Roars)

2575
02:35:12,937 --> 02:35:14,637
...you are free!

2576
02:35:16,440 --> 02:35:18,374
Crosshairs: I'll ride
with you anytime, spike!

2577
02:35:20,744 --> 02:35:22,645
(Roaring)

2578
02:35:37,895 --> 02:35:39,329
Did you miss me?

2579
02:35:39,930 --> 02:35:41,064
No.

2580
02:35:43,667 --> 02:35:46,703
This seed belongs
to our creators,

2581
02:35:46,705 --> 02:35:47,937
whoever they are.

2582
02:35:48,872 --> 02:35:50,940
There remains
a price on my head.

2583
02:35:52,109 --> 02:35:54,711
I endanger you all if I stay.

2584
02:35:56,613 --> 02:35:59,449
I shall take it where
it can never be found.

2585
02:36:01,352 --> 02:36:02,985
Will we ever see you again?

2586
02:36:02,987 --> 02:36:04,420
Optimus: Cade yeager,

2587
02:36:04,422 --> 02:36:06,122
I do not know.

2588
02:36:07,358 --> 02:36:09,559
But whenever you
look to the stars,

2589
02:36:10,461 --> 02:36:12,462
think of one of them

2590
02:36:13,564 --> 02:36:15,098
as my soul.

2591
02:36:16,834 --> 02:36:19,469
Defend this family,
autobots,

2592
02:36:21,004 --> 02:36:23,005
as they have you.

2593
02:36:24,641 --> 02:36:26,709
Defend

2594
02:36:26,711 --> 02:36:29,078
all they can be.

2595
02:36:36,787 --> 02:36:38,788
Optimus: <i> There are</i>
<i>mysteries to the universe</i>

2596
02:36:38,790 --> 02:36:42,392
<i>we were never meant to solve.</i>

2597
02:36:42,394 --> 02:36:45,862
<i>But who we are
and why we are here</i>

2598
02:36:47,131 --> 02:36:48,931
<i>are not among them.</i>

2599
02:36:49,633 --> 02:36:51,667
<i>Those answers</i>

2600
02:36:51,669 --> 02:36:53,669
<i>we carry inside.</i>

2601
02:36:54,738 --> 02:36:57,740
<i>I am optimus prime</i>

2602
02:36:57,742 --> 02:37:01,010
<i>and this message
is to my creators:</i>

2603
02:37:01,012 --> 02:37:03,613
<i>Leave planet earth alone.</i>

2604
02:37:04,681 --> 02:37:06,616
<i>'Cause I'm coming</i>

2605
02:37:06,618 --> 02:37:07,850
<i>for you.</i>
