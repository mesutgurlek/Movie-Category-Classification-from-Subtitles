Where waves aren't measured in feet,

He'll cover our escape

Nine of them, you say.

00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:39,988
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.

Nine pieces of eight.

What's the significance of that,
l wonder.

Nothing can hold against the armada.

<i>Not with the Flying Dutchman
at the lead.</i>

Nothing we know of.

216
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:55,309
Did your friend mention
where the Brethren Court are meeting?

217
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:58,109
He was mum on that, sir.

218
00:21:58,182 --> 00:21:59,649
Hmm.

219
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:02,151
Then he knows the value of information.

220
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:05,017
Better keep this between ourselves.

221
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:08,388
We don't want anyone
running off to Singapore, do we?

222
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:14,994
- Ah, admiral.
- You summoned me, Lord Beckett.

223
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:17,796
Yes. Something for you there.

224
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:21,235
Your new station deserves an old friend.

225
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:38,352
- Not more requisition orders.
- No, sir.

226

[sword unsheathed]

The Brethren know they face extinction.

229
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:53,435
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

230
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:21,426
No one said anything about cold.

231

l'm sure there must be
a good reason for our suffering.

232

Why don't that obeah woman
bring Jack back the same way

233
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:33,801
- she brought back Barbossa?
- Because Barbossa was only dead.

234
00:23:35,112 --> 00:23:39,378
Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul,

235
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,615
to a place not of death, but punishment.

236
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:48,522
The worst fate a person
can bring upon himself...

237
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:51,189
...stretching on forever.

238
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:55,121
That's what awaits
at Davy Jones' Locker.

239
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:02,670
Yeah. l knew there was a good reason.

These can't be
as accurate as modern charts.

243
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:24,020
No. But it leads to more places.

244
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,624
"Over the edge.

245
00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:34,136

"Sunrise sets.

247
00:24:38,742 --> 00:24:41,734
Flash of green."

248
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:46,606
Do you care to interpret,
Captain Barbossa?

249
00:24:47,418 --> 00:24:52,287
Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?

250
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:56,918
l reckon l seen my fair share.
Happens on rare occasion.

251
00:24:56,994 --> 00:25:00,794
The last glimpse of sunset,
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

252
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:04,190
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.

253
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:07,101
Some claim to have seen it who ain't .
And some say...

254
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:11,335
lt signals when a soul
comes back to this world from the dead.

255
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:19,508
- Sorry.
- Trust me, young Master Turner.

256
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:22,916
lt's not getting to the land
of the dead that's the problem.

257

lt's getting back.

Bloody hell. There's nothing left.

262
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:22,176
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

263
00:26:22,646 --> 00:26:24,614
Fetch the chest.

264
00:26:25,316 --> 00:26:27,477
And the governor?

265
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:32,018
He's been asking questions
about the heart.

266
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,421
Does he know?

267
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:41,658
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

Steady, men.

Go. All of you.
And take that infernal thing with you.

l will not have it on my ship!

277

Oh, l'm sorry to hear that...
because l will.

278
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:18,860
Because it seems to be
the only way to ensure

279
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:22,330
that this ship do as directed
by the company.

280
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:29,972
We need prisoners to interrogate,

And its captain

when l ordered you to kill your pet.

This is no longer your world, Jones.

How long do we continue not talking?

Once we rescue Jack,
everything'll be fine.

292

Then we rescue Jack.

-Right away, sir.

325
00:33:44,988 --> 00:33:46,683
l want a fire down below!

326
00:33:49,793 --> 00:33:53,524
- Help.
- Man the yards, you filthy toads.

[muffled groaning]

[clucking]

329
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:08,308
[all] Haul! Haul!

330
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:11,245
Haul the sheets handsomely.
Scandalize the lateens.

331
00:34:11,314 --> 00:34:13,111
- Aye, sir.
- Right away, sir.

332
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,098
- Mr. Sparrow?
- Aye, cap'n .

333
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:32,596
What say you about
the condition of this tack line?

334
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:36,739
- lt be proper to my eyes, sir.
- Proper?

335
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:40,675
lt is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
lt is not acceptable nor adequate.

336
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:43,178
lt is, in obvious fact, an abomination.

337
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:46,773
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you gave a man another chance.

338
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:49,118
- Shall l?
- [unsheathes sword]

339
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,150
lt's that sort of thinking
got us into this mess.

340
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:01,762
We have lost speed and, therefore, time.

341
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:06,064
Precious time,
which cannot be recovered once lost.

342
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:07,933
Do you understand?

343
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:11,132
- [all] Aye, aye, captain.
- Do you now?

344
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:14,872
lt will all have to be redone.
All of it.

345
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:17,413
And let this serve
as a lesson to the lot of you.

346
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:20,973
Doldrums, sir,
has the entire crew on edge.

347
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:24,020
l have no sympathy
for any of you feculent maggots,

348
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:26,988
and no more patience
to pretend otherwise.

349
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:33,786
Gentlemen, l wash my hands
of this weirdness.

350
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:45,740
No wind.

351
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:48,211
Of course, there's no bloody wind.

352
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:52,314
My soul l do swear for a breeze.

353
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:57,217
Gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.

354
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,491
Yes, sir, l know, but why?
Why would he do that?

355
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:14,264
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

356
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:18,034
We shall have a magnificent
garden party and you're not invited.

357
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:32,721
Shoo.

358
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:53,003
A rock.

359
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:23,864
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.

360
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:25,163
Oh.

361
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:28,201
A rope.

[coughing and gagging]

366
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:52,012
This truly is a godforsaken place.

367
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:55,849
l don't see Jack.
l don't see anyone.

368
00:39:57,193 --> 00:39:58,820
He's here.

369
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:02,194
Davy Jones never once
gave up that what he took.

370
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:03,698
And does it matter?

371
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:06,827
We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.

372
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:15,171
Witty Jack is closer than you think.

375
00:41:10,366 --> 00:41:14,268
Slap me thrice
and hand me to me mama. lt's Jack.

376
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:26,109
- lt's the captain!
- A sight for sore eyes.

- Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye, cap'n .

379
00:41:29,352 --> 00:41:30,717
l thought so.

380
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:33,756
l expect you're able
to account for your actions, then.

381
00:41:33,823 --> 00:41:34,812
Sir?

382
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:38,918
There's been a perpetual and virulent
lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?

383
00:41:38,995 --> 00:41:41,327
- Why is that, sir?
- Sir, you're...

384
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:44,963
You're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n .

385
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:51,970
l know that.
l know where l am.

386
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:56,273
- And don't think l don't .
- Jack Sparrow.

387
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,845
Oh, Hector.

388
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:00,849
lt's been too long. Hasn't it?

389
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:05,718
Aye. lsla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.

390
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:08,988
No, l didn't .

391
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:11,151
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?

392
00:42:11,227 --> 00:42:15,129
You add an agreeable sense
of the macabre to any delirium.

393
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:18,366
He thinks we're a hallucination.

394
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:20,930
William, tell me something:

395
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:25,031
Have you come because you need my help
to save a certain distressing damsel,

396
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:28,669
or rather, damsel in distress?
Either one.

397
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:30,201
No.

398
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,714
Well, then,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

399
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:36,775
So you can't be here.
Q.E.D., you're not really here.

400
00:42:36,853 --> 00:42:38,218
[Elizabeth] Jack.

401
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,324
This is real. We're here.

402
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:55,965
- The Locker, you say?
- Aye.

403
00:42:56,406 --> 00:42:58,704
We've come to rescue you.

404
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:03,837
Have you, now?
That's very kind of you.

405
00:43:03,913 --> 00:43:07,246
But it would seem that
as l possess a ship and you don't ,

406
00:43:07,383 --> 00:43:11,479
you're the ones in need of rescuing,
and l'm not sure as l'm in the mood.

407
00:43:12,322 --> 00:43:15,849
l see my ship. Right there.

408
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:20,886
Can't spot it.

<i>Must be a tiny little thing
hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.</i>

Jack, Cutler Beckett

<i>- He controls the Flying Dutchman.

The song has been sung.
The Brethren Court is called.

413
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:37,410
Leave you alone for a minute, look
what happens. Everything's gone to pot.

414
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,142
Aye. The world
needs you back something fierce.

415
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:42,013
And you need a crew.

416
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,315
Why should l sail with any of you?

417
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:49,881
Four of you have tried to kill me
in the past. One of you succeeded.

418
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:57,066
Oh, she's not told you.

419
00:43:57,133 --> 00:43:59,966
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

420
00:44:01,337 --> 00:44:02,804
As for you...

421
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,910
Now... don't tell me
you didn't enjoy it at the time.

422
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,939
Fair enough. All right, you're in.

423
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:14,950
Don't need you. You scare me.

424
00:44:15,018 --> 00:44:18,886
Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Mm...

425
00:44:18,955 --> 00:44:20,616
- Cotton.
- [parrot squawks]

426
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:25,218
Cotton's parrot, l'm a little iffy, but
at least l'll have someone to talk to.

427
00:44:26,396 --> 00:44:27,693
Who are you?

428
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:30,062
Tai Huang. These are my men.

429
00:44:30,733 --> 00:44:34,567
- Where do your allegiances lie?
- With the highest bidder.

430
00:44:35,004 --> 00:44:38,667
- l have a ship.
- That makes you the highest bidder.

431
00:44:38,741 --> 00:44:42,768
Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.

Which way are you going, Jack?

00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:59,591
Trim that sail.

- No, what are you doing?

What are you?
Captain gives orders on the ship.

441
00:45:11,874 --> 00:45:14,035
The captain of the ship
is giving orders.

442
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,602
- My ship, makes me captain.
- They be my charts.

443
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,171
That makes you " chartman."

Stow it! The both of you!
That's an order! Understand?!

445
00:45:30,993 --> 00:45:34,190
Sorry. l just thought
with the captain issue in doubt,

446
00:45:34,263 --> 00:45:37,198
l'd throw in my name for consideration.

- Yeah?

449
00:46:20,977 --> 00:46:22,842
You left Jack to the Kraken.

He's rescued now. lt's done with.

451

Will, l had no choice.

452
00:46:32,421 --> 00:46:34,286
You chose not to tell me.

l couldn't .

454
00:46:38,294 --> 00:46:39,886
lt wasn't your burden to bear.

But l did bear it, didn't l?

456
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,332
l just didn't know what it was.

You thought l loved him.

That's downright macabre.

dropped a cannonball on one of them?

Be disrespectful, it would.

They should be
in the care of Davy Jones.

That was the duty

...by the goddess, Calypso.

471
00:48:17,093 --> 00:48:20,893
To ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

472
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,168
And every ten years...

473
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:29,096
...him could come ashore...

But the man has become a monster.

So he wasn't always... tentacley?

00:48:48,124 --> 00:48:49,284
No.

478
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:53,894

Shall we just call it square, then?

643
01:03:38,647 --> 01:03:39,807
Release her.

644
01:03:40,615 --> 01:03:44,449
- She's not part of the bargain.
- And what bargain be that?

645
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,311
You heard Captain Turner.

646
01:03:48,857 --> 01:03:51,451
- Release her!
-"Captain Turner" ?

647
01:03:51,526 --> 01:03:54,290
Aye, the perfidious rotter
led a mutiny against us!

648
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:56,922
<i>l need the Pearl to free my father.</i>

649
01:03:56,998 --> 01:03:59,489
That's the only reason
l came on this voyage.

650
01:04:00,035 --> 01:04:02,868
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning this?

651
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:05,133
lt was my burden to bear.

652
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:11,675
<i>He needs the Pearl.
Captain Turner needs the Pearl.</i>

653
01:04:11,746 --> 01:04:15,807
And you felt guilty.
And you and your Brethren Court.

654
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:19,787
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?

655
01:04:28,997 --> 01:04:30,464
l'm standing with them.

656
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:38,300
l'm sorry, Jack, but there is an
old friend who wants to see you first.

657
01:04:38,373 --> 01:04:42,002
l'm not certain l can survive
any more visits from old friends.

658
01:04:44,412 --> 01:04:46,642
Here is your chance to find out.

659
01:04:56,057 --> 01:04:57,718
Curious.

660
01:04:57,792 --> 01:05:00,955
Your friends appear
to be quite desperate, Jack.

661
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:05,557
Perhaps they no longer believe that
a gathering of squabbling pirates

662
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:07,602
<i>can defeat the Flying Dutchman.</i>

663
01:05:08,336 --> 01:05:11,772
And so despair leads to betrayal.

664
01:05:12,173 --> 01:05:16,166
But you and l are no strangers
to betrayal, are we?

665
01:05:18,947 --> 01:05:20,437
lt's not here, Jack.

666
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,249
What? What isn't ?

667
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:27,812
<i>The heart of Davy Jones.
lt's safely aboard the Dutchman,</i>

668
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:30,915
and so unavailable for use as leverage

669
01:05:30,992 --> 01:05:33,654
to satisfy your debt
to the good captain.

670
01:05:33,728 --> 01:05:36,993
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.

671
01:05:37,132 --> 01:05:39,191
[Beckett] By your death?

672
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:41,326
And yet here you are.

673
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:44,498
Close your eyes
and pretend it's all a bad dream.

674
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:46,005
That's how l get by.

675
01:05:46,908 --> 01:05:50,537
And if Davy Jones
were to learn of your survival?

676
01:05:51,146 --> 01:05:52,613
[man] Ship oars.

677
01:05:52,681 --> 01:05:54,239
[man 2] Ship oars.

678
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:56,141
Be on your guard, men.

679
01:05:58,787 --> 01:06:00,652
My men are crew enough.

680
01:06:00,722 --> 01:06:02,883
Company ship, company crew.

681
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:06,860
<i>You agreed.
The Black Pearl was to be mine.</i>

682
01:06:07,762 --> 01:06:09,161
And so it was.

683
01:06:12,233 --> 01:06:15,293
[Beckett] Perhaps you'll consider
an alternative arrangement.

684
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:20,603
One which requires absolutely
nothing from you but information.

685
01:06:27,048 --> 01:06:31,747
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.
ln exchange for fair compensation?

686
01:06:32,821 --> 01:06:34,880
Square my debt with Jones...

687
01:06:35,924 --> 01:06:37,789
...guarantee my freedom?

688
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:39,486
Of course.

689
01:06:39,561 --> 01:06:41,495
lt's just good business.

690
01:06:42,564 --> 01:06:47,365
Were l in a divulgatory mood,
what then might l divulge?

691
01:06:47,435 --> 01:06:49,630
Everything.

692
01:06:50,105 --> 01:06:51,402
Where are they meeting?

693
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:54,198
Who are the pirate lords?

694
01:06:55,176 --> 01:06:58,373
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?

695
01:06:59,014 --> 01:07:02,142
[man] Prepare the brig.

696
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:09,722
<i>Beckett agreed the Black Pearl
was to be mine.</i>

697
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:13,454
<i>He's not going to give up the only ship
as can outrun the Dutchman, is he?</i>

698
01:07:20,602 --> 01:07:24,971
Shame they're not bound to honor
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

699
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,271
Because honor's
a hard thing to come by nowadays.

700
01:07:28,943 --> 01:07:32,140
There is no honor
to remaining with the losing side.

701
01:07:32,213 --> 01:07:36,741
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.

702
01:07:36,818 --> 01:07:40,686
<i>- The losing side, you say?
- They have the Dutchman.</i>

703
01:07:40,755 --> 01:07:42,245
<i>Now the Pearll</i>

704
01:07:43,258 --> 01:07:45,192
And what do the Brethren have?

705
01:07:45,894 --> 01:07:48,954
We have Calypso.

706
01:07:56,738 --> 01:07:59,104
[laughs] Calypso.

707
01:08:01,176 --> 01:08:03,167
An old legend.

708
01:08:04,312 --> 01:08:09,249
No. The goddess herself,
bound in human form.

709
01:08:09,684 --> 01:08:14,951
lmagine all the power of the seas
brought to bear against our enemy.

710
01:08:15,023 --> 01:08:20,325
l intend to release her.
But for that l need the Brethren Court.

711
01:08:22,697 --> 01:08:24,289
All the Court.

712
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:27,862
You can keep Barbossa.

713
01:08:27,936 --> 01:08:31,997
The belligerent homunculus and
his friend with the wooden eye, both.

714
01:08:32,073 --> 01:08:34,598
And Turner. Especially Turner.

715
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:38,134
<i>The rest go with me on the Pearl.
l'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,</i>

716
01:08:38,213 --> 01:08:42,547
where l will hand you the pirates
and you will not hand me to Jones.

717
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:47,145
- Bloody fair deal, don't you think?
- And what becomes of Miss Swann?

718
01:08:49,891 --> 01:08:52,018
What interest is she to you?

719
01:08:54,562 --> 01:08:56,928
What are you proposing, captain?

720
01:08:56,998 --> 01:08:59,990
What be accepting, cap'n ?

721
01:09:01,469 --> 01:09:03,835
- The girl.
- What?

722
01:09:03,905 --> 01:09:05,463
Jack.

723
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:07,938
l've just recalled.

724
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:13,003
l've got this wonderful compass,
which points to whatever l want.

725
01:09:13,548 --> 01:09:15,812
So for what do l need you?

726
01:09:15,884 --> 01:09:17,909
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

727
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,051
Out of the question.

728
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:21,918
lt was not a question.

729
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:23,753
Points to the thing you want most.

730
01:09:23,825 --> 01:09:26,020
And that is not
the Brethren Court, is it?

731
01:09:26,094 --> 01:09:29,325
- Then what is, Jack?
- Me.

732
01:09:30,265 --> 01:09:32,426
- Dead.
- Done.

733
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,162
What? Not done.

734
01:09:35,236 --> 01:09:37,796
You got us into this.
lf it frees us, then done!

735
01:09:37,872 --> 01:09:38,964
Damn.

736
01:09:43,178 --> 01:09:46,944
Although, if l kill you,
then l can use the compass

737
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:51,509
to find Shipwreck Cove,
is it, on my own.

738
01:09:51,853 --> 01:09:54,219
Cut out the middle man, as it were.

739
01:09:54,289 --> 01:09:56,018
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

740
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:59,582
l have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

741
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:02,561
Then we have an accord?

742
01:10:04,432 --> 01:10:06,992
With me killed,
you'd arrive at the cove,

743
01:10:07,068 --> 01:10:10,265
find it a stronghold,
nigh impregnable...

744
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:13,273
...able to withstand blockade for years.

745
01:10:13,341 --> 01:10:17,903
Then you'd be wishing, "lf only there
was someone l had not killed inside

746
01:10:18,046 --> 01:10:21,482
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside."

747
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:24,250
And you can accomplish all this?

748
01:10:25,553 --> 01:10:28,613
You may kill me,
but you may never insult me.

749
01:10:28,957 --> 01:10:30,015
Who am l?

750
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:34,022
l'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

751
01:10:35,063 --> 01:10:36,792
[rumbling]

752
01:10:37,865 --> 01:10:39,025
Done!

753
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:52,837
- [man shouting]
- [cannon fire]

754
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,460
[man] Man overboard!

755
01:11:27,548 --> 01:11:28,742
You're mad.

756
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:32,281
Thank goodness.
lf l wasn't , this'd probably never work.

757
01:11:36,891 --> 01:11:39,257
[Jack shouting]

758
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:53,134
And that was without
even a single drop of rum.

759
01:12:00,648 --> 01:12:05,415
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.

760
01:12:07,655 --> 01:12:09,316
Which ship do we follow?

761
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:14,054
<i>Signal the Dutchman to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl.</i>

762
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:17,554
How soon can we have
the ship ready to pursue?

763
01:12:17,632 --> 01:12:19,964
[wood cracking]

764
01:12:20,435 --> 01:12:21,732
[man] She's going down!

765
01:12:21,803 --> 01:12:23,327
[man 2] Stand clear!

766
01:12:27,442 --> 01:12:32,345
Do you think he plans it all out,
or just makes it up as he goes along?

767
01:12:34,215 --> 01:12:35,204
Sir.

768
01:12:54,335 --> 01:12:57,463
[speaking Chinese]

769
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:23,621
By this time tomorrow, we will arrive
at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.

770
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:27,566
Calypso.

771
01:13:28,669 --> 01:13:30,136
Excuse me?

772
01:13:31,172 --> 01:13:35,268
Not a name you fancy, l imagine,
out of the many that you have...

773
01:13:35,843 --> 01:13:37,470
...but it is what we call you.

774
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:40,574
We being who?

775
01:13:45,319 --> 01:13:47,116
You confirm it.

776
01:13:48,489 --> 01:13:49,888
Confirm what?

777
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:55,755
- You've told me nothing.
- The Brethren Court, not l.

778
01:13:55,830 --> 01:14:00,426
The First Brethren Court,
whose decision l would have opposed.

779
01:14:01,536 --> 01:14:03,436
They bound you to human form

780
01:14:03,504 --> 01:14:06,962
so the rule of the seas
would belong to man and not...

781
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:08,804
To me.

782
01:14:11,379 --> 01:14:16,248
But one such as you should never
be anything less than what you are.

783
01:14:16,317 --> 01:14:18,911
Pretty speech from a captor.

784
01:14:18,986 --> 01:14:22,979
But words whispered
through prison bars lose their charm.

785
01:14:23,324 --> 01:14:26,316
Can l be blamed for my efforts?

786
01:14:28,296 --> 01:14:32,562
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

787
01:14:32,633 --> 01:14:36,433
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

788
01:14:37,472 --> 01:14:39,997
l offer simply my desire.

789
01:14:41,476 --> 01:14:42,966
And in return?

790
01:14:44,078 --> 01:14:48,014
l would have your gifts,
should you choose to give them.

791
01:14:52,086 --> 01:14:56,079
And if l should choose not?

792
01:14:57,592 --> 01:14:59,560
Then l will take...

793
01:15:00,895 --> 01:15:01,919
...your fury.

794
01:15:05,032 --> 01:15:06,761
[grunting]

795
01:15:06,834 --> 01:15:08,893
[Elizabeth panting]

796
01:15:16,878 --> 01:15:19,210
[pirates shouting]

797
01:15:27,722 --> 01:15:29,019
Sao Feng?

798
01:15:30,591 --> 01:15:31,717
Here.

799
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:33,593
Please.

800
01:15:39,467 --> 01:15:42,994
With all nine pieces of eight...

01:15:45,473 --> 01:15:47,532
...you will be free.

802
01:15:49,377 --> 01:15:50,503
Take it!

803
01:15:52,346 --> 01:15:54,177
You are captain now.

804
01:15:55,349 --> 01:15:56,373
Me?

805
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:03,616
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.

806
01:16:05,693 --> 01:16:08,287
Captain! The ship is taken.
We cannot...

807
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:13,291
Forgive me... Calypso.

Sao.

810
01:16:28,749 --> 01:16:30,444
What did he tell you?

811
01:16:35,523 --> 01:16:37,388
He made me captain.

812
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:41,890
Set! Fire!

813
01:16:47,335 --> 01:16:49,360
You are not my captain.

814
01:16:49,637 --> 01:16:50,968
Elizabeth.

815
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,397
James. James.

Thank God, you're alive.

817
01:17:00,815 --> 01:17:02,373
Your father'll be overjoyed

818
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:05,283
- to know you're safe.
- My father's dead.

819
01:17:05,753 --> 01:17:08,483
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

820
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:11,424
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

821
01:17:12,727 --> 01:17:15,491
Who among you
do you name as captain?

822
01:17:15,563 --> 01:17:17,053
Captain. Her.

823
01:17:17,131 --> 01:17:18,792
[all] Her.

824
01:17:21,669 --> 01:17:22,761
Captain?

825
01:17:22,837 --> 01:17:26,500
Tow the ship.
Put the prisoners in the brig.

826
01:17:27,808 --> 01:17:29,776
The captain shall have my quarters.

827

Well, now you do.

William.

He made it. He's alive.

And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.

Yes, Will is alive.

And he wants to help you.

He can't help me. He won't come.

But you're his father.

He spoke of you.

He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.

Me?

He won't pick me.

862

l wouldn't pick me.

863
01:20:09,403 --> 01:20:10,927
Tell him not to come.

Tell him to stay away.

Tell him it's too late.

l'm already a part of the ship...

867

He's coming for me.

You'll see.

He promised.

Ready those lines.

Sir.

880
01:21:33,053 --> 01:21:34,918
[Beckett] A breadcrumb trail.

881
01:21:34,989 --> 01:21:39,323
- And we're meant to follow.
- A betrayer among them?

882
01:21:39,393 --> 01:21:44,558
- Or a trap?
- A gambit by a skilled opponent.

883
01:21:45,866 --> 01:21:49,859
- Adjust course, lieutenant.
- Sir?

884
01:21:51,705 --> 01:21:53,969
We can only hope
to reach our destination

885
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:56,066
before they run out of bodies.

886
01:22:09,723 --> 01:22:12,783
You escaped the brig
even quicker than l expected.

887
01:22:13,727 --> 01:22:17,128
William, do you notice anything?

888
01:22:18,799 --> 01:22:20,027
Rather...

889
01:22:20,434 --> 01:22:23,961
...do you notice something
that is not there to be noticed?

890
01:22:24,738 --> 01:22:27,730
- You haven't raised an alarm.
- Odd, isn't it?

891
01:22:27,808 --> 01:22:29,275
Not as odd as this.

892
01:22:30,678 --> 01:22:33,146
Come up with this
all by your lonesome, did you?

893
01:22:33,213 --> 01:22:36,239
l said to myself, "Think like Jack."

894
01:22:36,617 --> 01:22:38,812
This is what you've arrived at?

895
01:22:38,886 --> 01:22:42,219
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust...

896
01:22:42,289 --> 01:22:44,120
...accomplish your own ends?

897
01:22:44,191 --> 01:22:45,988
lt's like you don't know me at all.

898
01:22:49,296 --> 01:22:52,390
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?

899
01:22:53,767 --> 01:22:55,098
Ah.

900
01:22:55,703 --> 01:22:58,228
You've not seen fit
to trust her with it.

901
01:23:01,608 --> 01:23:03,166
l'm losing her, Jack.

902
01:23:03,911 --> 01:23:07,847
Every step l make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

903
01:23:08,315 --> 01:23:12,012
lf you choose to lock your heart away,
you'll lose her for certain.

904
01:23:12,553 --> 01:23:15,750
lf l might lend a machete
to your intellectual thicket...

905
01:23:16,924 --> 01:23:18,892
...avoid the choice altogether.

906
01:23:19,727 --> 01:23:21,194
Change the facts.

907
01:23:22,262 --> 01:23:25,254
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

908
01:23:26,033 --> 01:23:27,364
Who?

909
01:23:31,638 --> 01:23:32,627
You?

910
01:23:34,975 --> 01:23:38,376
Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.

and bind yourself to the Dutchman...</i>

915

- ...forever?
- No, mate. l'm free forever.

916
01:23:54,628 --> 01:23:58,655
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map. Free from death itself.

917
01:23:58,999 --> 01:24:01,058
You have to do the job though, Jack.

918
01:24:01,135 --> 01:24:04,195
You have to ferry souls
to the next world.

919
01:24:04,838 --> 01:24:07,432
- Or end up just like Jones.

Quickly.

What are you doing?

[whispering in Chinese]

931
01:25:35,295 --> 01:25:39,254
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren.

932
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:41,665
l fear there may be
a traitor among them.

lt's too late to earn my forgiveness.

01:25:46,373 --> 01:25:49,171
l had nothing to do
with your father's death.

935
01:25:51,378 --> 01:25:54,370
But that does not absolve me
of my other sins.

936
01:25:57,918 --> 01:25:58,976
Come with us.

01:28:59,491 --> 01:29:02,927
Where lies Shipwreck Cove
and the town of Shipwreck.

967
01:29:02,994 --> 01:29:05,428
You heard him. Step lively.

968
01:29:05,497 --> 01:29:07,829
For all that pirates are clever clogs,

969
01:29:07,899 --> 01:29:10,732
we are unimaginative
when it comes to naming things.

970
01:29:10,802 --> 01:29:12,030
Aye.

971
01:29:12,104 --> 01:29:16,234
l once sailed with a geezer who lost
both of his arms and part of his eye.

972
01:29:16,308 --> 01:29:17,900
What'd you call him?

973
01:29:19,077 --> 01:29:20,305
Larry.

974
01:29:24,015 --> 01:29:26,984
l do not renege
on a bargain once struck.

975
01:29:27,052 --> 01:29:29,043
But we agreed on ends only.

976
01:29:29,121 --> 01:29:32,090
The means are mine to decide.

977
01:29:32,157 --> 01:29:34,648
Caution, Barbossa.

978
01:29:34,726 --> 01:29:38,958
Do not forget it was by my power
you return from the dead.

979
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:42,864
Or what it mean if you fail me.

980
01:29:46,138 --> 01:29:49,005
Don't you forget
why you had to bring me back.

981
01:29:49,074 --> 01:29:52,805
Why l could not leave Jack
to his well-deserved fate.

982
01:29:53,712 --> 01:29:56,237
lt took nine pirate lords
to bind you, Calypso.

983
01:29:56,782 --> 01:30:00,081
And it'll take no less than nine
to set you free.

984
01:30:00,152 --> 01:30:02,347
Masters Pintel and Ragetti.

985
01:30:04,189 --> 01:30:07,283
Take this fishwife to the brig.

986
01:30:09,127 --> 01:30:11,254
Right this way, Mrs. Fish.

987
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:43,083
l cannot be summoned
like some mongrel pup.

988
01:30:43,161 --> 01:30:45,095
Apparently, you can.

989
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:47,291
l believe you know each other.
