Against you.

594
00:50:28,127 --> 00:50:31,483
<i>Can you prove that you
didn't offer to save my job...</i>

595
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:34,001
if I let you blow me?

596
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:42,163
Man... you are
one twisted fuck.

597
00:50:43,527 --> 00:50:46,599
Nope. I'm just
an ordinary guy...

598
00:50:46,687 --> 00:50:49,281
with nothing to lose.

599
00:50:54,047 --> 00:50:55,924
Yeah.

600
00:51:01,207 --> 00:51:03,721
- Carolyn.
- Buddy.

601
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:07,846
- I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
- Oh. [Chuckles]

602
00:51:07,927 --> 00:51:10,202
Christy left for New York
this morning.

603
00:51:10,287 --> 00:51:13,563
Let's just say things were
a little... hectic around the house.

604
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:17,043
- What's she doing in New York?
- She's moving there.

605
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:19,004
Yes, we are splitting up.

606
00:51:19,127 --> 00:51:21,561
Buddy. I'm so sorry.

607
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:25,202
Yes. According to her, I'm...

608
00:51:25,287 --> 00:51:27,164
too focused on my career.

609
00:51:27,287 --> 00:51:30,165
- [Scoffs]
- As if being driven to succeed is...

610
00:51:30,247 --> 00:51:33,762
some sort of a character flaw.
[Chuckling]

611
00:51:33,887 --> 00:51:37,641
Well, she certainly did
take advantage of the lifestyle
my success afforded her.

612
00:51:37,767 --> 00:51:40,122
Ooh! Ha. Wow.
[Chuckles]

613
00:51:41,927 --> 00:51:44,964
- Ah, it's for the best.
- Mm-hmm.

614
00:51:45,047 --> 00:51:49,359
When I saw you two at the party the
other night, you seemed perfectly happy.

615
00:51:49,447 --> 00:51:52,007
Well, call me crazy,

616
00:51:52,087 --> 00:51:56,399
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful,

617
00:51:56,487 --> 00:51:59,126
<i>one must project
an image of success...</i>

618
00:51:59,207 --> 00:52:01,163
<i>at all times.</i>

619
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:22,645
<i>What are you doing?</i>

620
00:52:22,727 --> 00:52:26,163
<i>- I was filming this dead bird.
- Why?</i>

621
00:52:26,287 --> 00:52:28,403
<i>Because it's beautiful.</i>

622
00:52:30,807 --> 00:52:34,322
I think maybe you forgot
your medication today, mental boy.

623
00:52:36,207 --> 00:52:38,084
<i>[Ricky]
Hi, Jane.</i>

624
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:40,442
I want you to stop filming me.

625
00:52:42,407 --> 00:52:44,204
Okay.

626
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,761
Well, whatever. This is boring.

627
00:52:46,847 --> 00:52:49,441
Let's go.

628
00:52:49,527 --> 00:52:52,724
<i>- Do you need a ride?
- Are you crazy?</i>
