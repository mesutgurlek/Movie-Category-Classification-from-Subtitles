01:15:58,774 --> 01:16:01,277
COME ON.

810
01:16:01,277 --> 01:16:03,779
COME ON.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

811
01:16:03,779 --> 01:16:05,665
COME ON. THAT'S IT.

812
01:16:06,165 --> 01:16:08,668
THAT'S IT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

813
01:16:08,668 --> 01:16:11,170
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

814
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,541
WHAT'S SHE THINKING OF,

815
01:16:15,541 --> 01:16:18,544
GOING OFF LEAVING
YOU LIKE THIS?

816
01:16:18,544 --> 01:16:21,047
YOU MUST ADMIT
THAT SHE WAS...

817
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:27,053
SHE WAS HAPPY
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED.

818
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,943
SHE BLOSSOMED...

819
01:16:33,943 --> 01:16:36,445
DIDN'T SHE?

820
01:16:42,818 --> 01:16:44,820
I CAN'T JUST
LIE HERE.

821
01:16:48,324 --> 01:16:51,827
I CAN'T EVEN
MAKE LOVE TO HER.

822
01:16:53,579 --> 01:16:55,581
SHE'S GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

823
01:16:57,583 --> 01:17:00,586
SHE'S GOT TO GET ON
WITH LIFE.

824
01:17:01,087 --> 01:17:02,588
HELP ME
SET HER FREE.

825
01:17:09,478 --> 01:17:11,981
SHE'D DO ANYTHING
FOR YOU, JAN.

826
01:17:11,981 --> 01:17:13,983
YOU KNOW THAT.

827
01:17:13,983 --> 01:17:16,485
SHE DON'T CARE
ANYTHING ABOUT HERSELF...

828
01:17:18,487 --> 01:17:20,489
BUT SHE'D DO
ANYTHING FOR YOU...

829
01:17:21,991 --> 01:17:24,994
JUST TO SEE A SMILE
ON YOUR FACE.

830
01:17:25,995 --> 01:17:27,496
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

831
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,002
YEAH.

832
01:17:33,002 --> 01:17:35,004
RIGHT.

833
01:17:37,006 --> 01:17:39,125
THANKS
FOR TELLING ME.

834
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:40,626
NO TROUBLE.

835
01:17:43,629 --> 01:17:46,132
DO YOU WANT ME
TO READ TO YOU?

836
01:17:46,132 --> 01:17:48,134
HMM?

837
01:17:51,137 --> 01:17:52,638
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

838
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,101
[FOOTSTEPS]

839
01:18:41,103 --> 01:18:43,606
THEY TOOK HIM BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

840
01:18:46,993 --> 01:18:48,494
Dodo: BESS.

841
01:18:48,995 --> 01:18:49,996
BESS,
WHAT IS GOING ON?

842
01:18:49,996 --> 01:18:52,498
HE WENT UNCONSCIOUS.
WE HAD TO BRING HIM
BACK HERE.

843
01:18:52,498 --> 01:18:54,500
AT HOME ANYMORE--

844
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,002
NOT IF YOU'RE
GOING TO GO
RUNNING OFF

845
01:18:56,502 --> 01:18:57,503
AND LEAVING HIM
LIKE THAT.

846
01:18:57,503 --> 01:18:59,005
I'M SORRY.

847
01:18:59,005 --> 01:19:01,007
WELL, IT'S JUST NOT
GOOD ENOUGH!

848
01:19:01,007 --> 01:19:03,509
I'M NOT--
I'M NOT EVEN ALLOWED
TO KISS HIM ANYMORE.

849
01:19:03,509 --> 01:19:07,013
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
LISTENING TO WHAT
HE SAYS, BESS?

850
01:19:07,013 --> 01:19:08,514
IT'S UP TO YOU.

851
01:19:09,015 --> 01:19:11,017
HE AIN'T GOT
ANYONE ELSE.

852
01:19:11,017 --> 01:19:13,019
YOU COULD GIVE HIM
THE WILL TO LIVE.

853
01:19:13,019 --> 01:19:15,521
THAT'S MORE THAN
ANY DOCTOR CAN DO.

854
01:19:30,036 --> 01:19:32,538
BESS?

855
01:19:32,655 --> 01:19:34,657
I'M SORRY.

856
01:19:37,043 --> 01:19:39,045
NO, IT WAS MY FAULT.

857
01:19:39,045 --> 01:19:40,546
COME HERE.

858
01:19:49,171 --> 01:19:50,673
HI.

859
01:19:50,923 --> 01:19:52,425
HI.

860
01:19:59,682 --> 01:20:02,184
LOVE IS
A MIGHTY POWER...

861
01:20:03,686 --> 01:20:05,187
ISN'T IT?

862
01:20:09,191 --> 01:20:11,193
IF I DIE...

863
01:20:11,193 --> 01:20:15,448
IT WILL BE
BECAUSE LOVE CANNOT
KEEP ME ALIVE.

864
01:20:16,449 --> 01:20:18,951
BUT I CAN HARDLY
REMEMBER

865
01:20:19,085 --> 01:20:22,088
WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO MAKE LOVE...

866
01:20:22,588 --> 01:20:25,091
AND IF
I FORGET THAT,

867
01:20:25,091 --> 01:20:27,209
THEN I'LL DIE.

868
01:20:31,097 --> 01:20:35,101
REMEMBER WHEN
I PHONED YOU
FROM THE RIG?

869
01:20:35,601 --> 01:20:38,604
WE MADE LOVE
WITHOUT BEING
TOGETHER.

870
01:20:38,604 --> 01:20:40,606
DO YOU WANT ME
TO TALK TO YOU
LIKE THAT AGAIN?

871
01:20:40,606 --> 01:20:41,607
I'D LOVE TO.

872
01:20:41,607 --> 01:20:43,109
BESS.

873
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:49,115
I WANT YOU TO FIND
A MAN TO MAKE LOVE TO

874
01:20:49,615 --> 01:20:53,119
AND THEN
COME BACK HERE
AND TELL ME ABOUT IT.

875
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:56,622
IT WILL FEEL LIKE
YOU AND ME BEING
TOGETHER AGAIN.

876
01:20:56,622 --> 01:21:00,126
NOW, THAT...
THAT WILL KEEP ME ALIVE.
