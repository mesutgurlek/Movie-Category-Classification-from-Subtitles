No. No. No! No!

That's not what I meant.

182
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:21,081
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

183
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:24,748
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?

184
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:27,792
Would you like
to sit down?

185
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,918
Right here.

186

O.K. We'll both stand up.

187

Oh, I see.

188

Very good.
You got me there.

189
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:52,282
Could you
look at me, please?

190
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:55,286
If you don't
look at me, I can't...

191
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:58,551
So, um...
Dr. Franklin tells me

192
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:01,717
that you've been here
since you were 5.

193
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:04,888
Mm-hmm.

194
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:07,556
Um...

195
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,099
when did you graduate?

196
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:17,909
And, uh, now... now...
now you work here?

197
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:23,406
Are you reading
my lips?

198
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:30,713
I don't think that
you are reading my lips.

199
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:33,247
Ohhh...

200
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,453
Gee, that was quick of me,
wasn't it?

201
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:40,164
You could've told me.

202
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,794
Why? I don't know.

203
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:45,132
How about common courtesy?

204
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:47,865
How about me
getting out of here

205
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:50,373
so you can
mop the floor?

206
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:54,804
Man...

207
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:58,782
you know,
if you let me,

208
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:02,617
I bet I could teach you
how to speak.

209
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,288
And you could teach me...

210
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:10,261
but I don't want
to mop the floor.

211
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:12,160
Gee, that was quick.

212
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:18,129
And you don't
want to speak.

213
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:21,967
Brilliant.

214
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:26,471
Schmuck.

215
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:18,195
It's a damn shame.

216
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:19,993
Costly, too.

217
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:22,192
Resodding
is damn costly.

218
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:24,702
No. I'm talking
about Sarah Norman.

219
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,705
Right. Sarah.
Look at this, will you?

220
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,206
What a mess.

221
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:31,209
Has she ever
tried speaking?

222
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:33,211
Sarah's not
hard of hearing.

223
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:35,713
She's totally deaf.
Born that way.

224
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:37,214
That makes it tough.

225
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:39,217
The rain's
lousing up the fields.

226
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:41,719
It's a shame
that a bright woman

227
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:43,220
is stuck here
cleaning toilets.

228
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:44,722
Doesn't bother her.

229
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,722
Oh, no?

230
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:46,723
Look, hotshot,

231
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:49,226
not everyone
wants to be a star.

232
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:50,728
Sarah is content.

233
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:53,230
She had
a rotten childhood.

234
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:55,233
She was diagnosed
as retarded

235
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:56,734
until she was 7.

236
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:59,168
We let her know
how smart she was.

237
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:00,170
For what?

238
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,672
She's productive.
Pays taxes.

239
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,071
Oh, brother.

240
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:07,879
All right.
You want to try?

241
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:09,437
I'll talk to her.

242
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:10,675
Huh?

243
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:12,182
I'll talk to her.

244
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:15,186
Look at this.
Will you look at this?

245
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:16,312
Damn!

246
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:19,289
It's going to cost
$2,000 or $3,000 at least.

247
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:20,825
Oh, brother.

on S's, though.

to give you an hour.

She's really
looking forward to it.

forward to it, aren't you?

think I was a scream.

try to remember that.

00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:20,803
O.K.?

335
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:23,677
I mean, can we stop this?

336
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,877
I mean, why can't we...

337
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:31,687
I mean, why can't we just...

338
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,521
why don't we...

339
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:38,228
why don't we...

340
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:42,965
go out and have
some dinner tonight?

341
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:49,774
Huh? Just give me
a yes or a no.

342
00:28:58,283 --> 00:28:59,841
Yes?

343
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:01,215
Good.

344
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:03,186
I think.

345
00:29:03,255 --> 00:29:04,517
O.K. Um...

346
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:07,149
I will meet you
behind, uh...

347
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:10,524
the girls' dormitory,
8:00.

348
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,724
I will whisper
your name.

349
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:18,560
Hey!

350
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:21,071
I know that sign.

351
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:23,801
That's the first sign
I ever learned.

352
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:35,018
It's in Italian.

353
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,281
Can I suggest something?

354
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:43,093
Will you
give me a break?

355
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:47,621
My Italian is worse
than my signing.

356
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:51,032
The veal piccata
is very good.

357
00:29:53,138 --> 00:29:54,537
Look. I'm sorry.

358
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:59,942
V-E-A-L P-I-C-C-A-T-A.

359
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:01,342
I mean, you see,

360
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:03,347
by the time I finish,

361
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:06,009
they may be out of it.

362
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:08,779
It's veal. It's, uh...

363
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:12,153
sauteed in lemon
and butter.

364
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,684
What's veal?

365
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:20,219
Uh... God.
What the hell is veal?

366
00:30:20,265 --> 00:30:21,289
Um...

367
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:22,993
Good evening.

368
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:25,669
Something to drink
this evening?

369
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,036
You want something
to drink, Sarah?

370
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:34,711
Our house wine
is very nice.

371
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:36,178
You want some wine?

372
00:30:36,248 --> 00:30:38,682
Yeah. It's O.K.

373
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,274
Uh, white wine.

374
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:42,513
We'll take a carafe,
please.

375
00:30:47,058 --> 00:30:48,958
He doesn't think
you're stupid.

376
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:50,756
He thinks
you're deaf.

377
00:30:53,632 --> 00:30:57,625
No. Only stupid
hearing people

378
00:30:57,702 --> 00:31:01,604
think that deaf
people are stupid.

379
00:31:09,915 --> 00:31:13,942
Do you really like
being a cleaning woman?

380
00:31:15,086 --> 00:31:16,018
Why?

381
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,582
Yeah. I mean,
there are other jobs

382
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:25,994
where a person can
work alone in silence.

383
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,125
Not with toilet bowl
cleaner?

384
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,600
You should have told me
that was the attraction.

385
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:39,542
You are smart as hell,
you know?

386
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:42,879
You want to dance?

387
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,411
Can you feel it?

388
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:48,951
Vibrations...

389
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,317

00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:22,429
Lydia does not
talk like that.

Don't you want to be able to
get along in the world?

481
00:37:14,946 --> 00:37:17,346
Mrs. Norman?
I'm James Leeds.

482
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:18,939
I didn't call again...

483
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:21,918
because I would've
hung up again.

484
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:24,181
It's 60 miles
here and back.

485
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:25,654
Please,
just five minutes.

486
00:37:25,723 --> 00:37:27,657
I just got home
from work.

487
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:30,159
This is my time
to relax.

488
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:32,162
Discussing Sarah
is hardly relaxing.

489
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,288
Five minutes.

490
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,348
Well.

491
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:56,082
Well. Uh... let's see.

492
00:37:56,154 --> 00:37:59,487
You haven't seen Sarah
in eight years?

493
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:01,183
Let's get this straight.

494
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:03,159
Sarah doesn't want
to see me.

495
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:05,457
Has she said why?

496
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,590
We don't communicate
very well.

497
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:10,600
Did you ever learn
to sign?

498
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,431
Some of the parents...

499
00:38:12,503 --> 00:38:15,131
I'm really sick

Her sister Ruth had
a bunch of boys hanging around,

asking Sarah out

1163
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:49,303

1164
01:28:57,746 --> 01:28:59,179
I think that helped.

1165
01:29:19,267 --> 01:29:22,168
Yeah? What have
you just decided?

1166
01:29:25,573 --> 01:29:28,508
No one's ever going
to speak for you again?

1167
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,134
Come on.

1168
01:29:30,245 --> 01:29:32,110
How are you
going to manage?

1169
01:29:34,215 --> 01:29:36,979
Everyone's always
told me who I am,

1170
01:29:37,052 --> 01:29:38,280
and I let them.

1171
01:29:38,353 --> 01:29:39,945
"She wants, she thinks."

1172
01:29:40,055 --> 01:29:42,990
And most of the time
they were wrong.

1173
01:29:43,058 --> 01:29:47,722
They had no idea what
I said, wanted, thought.

1174
01:29:47,796 --> 01:29:49,127
And now they won't.

1175
01:29:49,197 --> 01:29:50,596
Well, that's all right.

1176
01:29:50,699 --> 01:29:52,132
I'll buy that.

1177
01:29:53,902 --> 01:29:55,927
No, I won't.
How could I?

1178
01:29:56,037 --> 01:29:57,436
Because I love you.

1179
01:30:01,342 --> 01:30:05,073
Love has nothing
to do with it?

1180
01:30:05,146 --> 01:30:06,113
That's wonderful.

1181
01:30:06,181 --> 01:30:10,914
Then what the hell
have we been doing?

1182
01:30:16,858 --> 01:30:18,155
Watch your hands?

1183
01:30:18,226 --> 01:30:20,023
It's hard to avoid them.

1184
01:30:21,563 --> 01:30:23,622
This sign...

1185
01:30:23,765 --> 01:30:25,027
to connect...

1186
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:26,158
simple.

1187
01:30:27,569 --> 01:30:30,504
But it means
so much more

1188
01:30:30,572 --> 01:30:31,971
when I do this.

1189
01:30:34,209 --> 01:30:36,973
Now it means...

1190
01:30:37,045 --> 01:30:39,445
to be joined
in a relationship.

1191
01:30:39,514 --> 01:30:41,106
Separate, but one.

1192
01:30:42,884 --> 01:30:44,283
That's what I want.

1193
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:47,287
But you think for me,

1194

there were no "I."

1195
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:52,388
She will be with me,

1196
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:54,257
quit her job,

1197

learn how
to play poker,

1198
01:30:56,264 --> 01:30:57,424

That's all you, not me.

1201
01:31:11,045 --> 01:31:15,277
Until you let me
be an "I,"

1202
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:17,147
the way you are,

1203
01:31:17,218 --> 01:31:20,449
you can never come
inside my silence

1204
01:31:20,522 --> 01:31:21,989
and know me.

1205
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:27,988
And I won't let
myself know you.

1206
01:31:28,062 --> 01:31:30,155
Until that time...

1207
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:34,400
we can't be like this...

1208
01:31:35,470 --> 01:31:36,937
joined.

1209
01:31:55,490 --> 01:32:00,120
Well... that's
all very moving.

1210
01:32:00,195 --> 01:32:01,287
But...

1211
01:32:01,329 --> 01:32:05,265
how are you
going to manage?

1212
01:32:08,203 --> 01:32:10,763
You can lock yourself

1213
01:32:10,872 --> 01:32:15,639
back in your
precious silent castle...

1214
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,772
I heard.

1215
01:32:20,915 --> 01:32:23,782
I heard every word,
goddamn it.

1216
01:32:23,885 --> 01:32:25,284
I translated
for myself.

1217
01:32:25,353 --> 01:32:27,150
It went
from your hands

1218
01:32:27,222 --> 01:32:28,450
into my brain

1219
01:32:28,523 --> 01:32:29,990
and out my mouth.

1220
01:32:30,058 --> 01:32:31,457
And you know what?

1221
01:32:31,526 --> 01:32:33,926
I think
you're lying.

1222
01:32:33,995 --> 01:32:36,555
I don't think
that you think

1223
01:32:36,631 --> 01:32:40,089
being deaf is so
goddamn wonderful.

1224
01:32:41,803 --> 01:32:45,739
I think that you're
scared to death to try.

1225
01:32:45,807 --> 01:32:48,776
I think it's nothing
but stupid pride

1226
01:32:48,877 --> 01:32:51,107
that's keeping you
from speaking right.

1227
01:32:51,179 --> 01:32:53,647
You want to be
on your own.

1228
01:32:53,715 --> 01:32:55,706
You don't want
to be pitied.

1229
01:32:55,783 --> 01:32:58,479
Then you learn
to read my lips

1230
01:32:58,553 --> 01:33:00,953
and use your mouth
for something

1231
01:33:01,022 --> 01:33:02,956
besides showing me
you're better

1232
01:33:03,024 --> 01:33:05,117
than hearing girls in bed.

1233
01:33:05,193 --> 01:33:07,286
Read my lips.

1234
01:33:07,328 --> 01:33:08,886

1236
01:33:12,133 --> 01:33:14,431
You want to talk to me,

1237
01:33:14,502 --> 01:33:17,471
then you learn my
language.

1238
01:33:17,538 --> 01:33:18,971
Did you understand that?

1239
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,770
You've probably been
reading lips for years.

1240

But that's the great
control game, isn't it?

since you
were a little girl.

You didn't want
to hurt again,

used your anger...

01:52:04,664 --> 01:52:06,894
to push me away.

But you
learned from me.

1412
01:52:36,563 --> 01:52:39,191
You learned
that you can hurt...

1413
01:52:47,274 --> 01:52:50,437
and you won't shrivel up
and blow away.

1414
01:53:44,564 --> 01:53:48,159
I don't want to be
without you, either.

1415
01:53:52,072 --> 01:53:54,006
Do you think...

1416
01:53:54,074 --> 01:53:58,135
that we could
find a place...

1417
01:53:58,211 --> 01:54:00,736
where we can meet...

1418
01:54:03,583 --> 01:54:06,643
not in silence...

1419
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,915
and not in sound?
