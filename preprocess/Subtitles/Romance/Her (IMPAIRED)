Um...

Well, actually, I think the thing I
always found frustrating about my mom...

I do need a name."</i>

curious how I work?</i>

<i>Do you want to know how I work?</i>

Yeah, actually. How do you work?

198
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,687
<i>Well, basically, I have intuition.</i>

199
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,205
<i>I mean, the DNA of who I am...</i>

200

since they met eight years ago.

The first letter I ever wrote
for him was for her birthday.

Hey, why didn't you
call me back last week?

You went shopping.
Get anything good?

Um, just come cables
and a fruit smoothie.

277
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,889
Ugh! Always the fruit. Don't
you know what people say?

278
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,010
You've got to eat your fruits
and juice your vegetables.

I didn't know that.

280
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,364
Yeah, by juicing the fruit,
you lose all the fibers.

281
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,126
That's what your body wants.
That's the important part.

- Otherwise it's all just sugar.
- THEODORE: It makes sense.

00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,202
Or maybe he just likes the
way that it tastes...

284
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,570
and then that brings him pleasure
and that's good for his body too.

- Am I doing it again? Heh.
- Maybe.

I've cut some stuff over
the past few months.

288
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,407
I mean, no. Not over the past few
months, but, um, no, I haven't.

289
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,602

- Ugh.

291

You only have so much
energy, you know?

292
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,048
And to divide yourself between doing
what it is that you have to do...

293
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,171
and then doing what you love,
it's so important to prioritize.

294
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,489
I can't even prioritize between
video games and Internet porn.

call me like the other guys, right?

No, not at all. No.

Um, I have my goddaughter's
birthday next weekend, but, um...

605

You know what? At this age, I just feel
like I can't let you waste my time...

- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

613
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,011
I have to go home.

Well, the room's spinning

<i>It's just that...</i>

<i>earlier I was thinking
about how I was annoyed...</i>

<i>and this is gonna sound strange...</i>

<i>but I was really
excited about that.</i>

668

<i>And then I was thinking about the
other things I've been feeling...</i>

669
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,963
<i>and I caught myself
feeling proud of that...</i>

670

<i>you know, proud of having my
own feelings about the world.</i>

<i>Like the times I was
worried about you...</i>

<i>and things that hurt
me, things I want.</i>

<i>And then...</i>

674
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,045
<i>I had this terrible thought.</i>

675
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,485
<i>Like, are these feelings even real?</i>

676
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,806
<i>Or are they just programming?</i>

677
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,886
<i>And that idea really hurts.</i>

678
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,921

myself for even having pain.</i>

just the tips of my fingers.

690

I was like, "I'm fucking trying, you know?"
And he's like, "You're not trying."

889
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,723
All I'm doing is trying, but I'm
not trying the way he wants...

890
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,726
and he's, like, trying to control
the way that I'm trying.

Yeah, I just want to
get it done, you know?

01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,771
Sign the papers, be divorced

No, but, you know...

we fell in love together and
we got married together...

No, I'm really glad
you suggested it.

1091
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,002
I signed all the papers.

1092
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,442
I put them for you to sign.

Yeah, I know.

I'm a really slow

But you don't have
to do it right now.

I can just get it out of the way.

Yeah, but everything makes you cry.

Yeah, she's been really
good for me, you know?

So, what's she like?

Well, her name is Samantha,
and she's an operating system.

1135

She's not just a computer.
She's her own person.

can't handle real emotions, Theodore.
