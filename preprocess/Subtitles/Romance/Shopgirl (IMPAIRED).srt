1
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,520
Mirabelle Buttersfield moved from Vermount, hoping
to begin her life

2
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,160
And now she is stranded in the vast openness of L.A.

3
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
She keeps working to make connections..

4
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,120
But the pile of near misses is starting to overwhelm her

5
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,190
What Mirabelle needs is an ominationed voice to illuminate
and spotlight her.

6
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,880
And to inform everyone..

7
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,940
..that this one has value.

8
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,120
This one, standing behind the counter in the glove department.

9
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,150
And to find her counterpart..

10
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,010
..and bring him to her.

11
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,560
Come on.

12
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,160
Come on out.

13
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,250
You want something ? You wanna eat?

14
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,290
There's some food out here.

15
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,260
Here it is.. It's in the kitchen !

16
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,610
Good night, Sylvia.

17
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,680
So..

18
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,520
You have a student loan of $49,452..

19
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,400
..and you're currently paying off at the rate of..

20
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,870
..45 dollars a month.

21
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:18,800
Yes.

22
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,400
Do you think you could increase that amount to--

23
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,240
Just a sec..

24
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,100
$160 a month ?

25
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,430
Well. I..

26
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,420
I would love to, but..

27
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,830
That's just not gonna happen.

28
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,190
- Really?
- Yeah.

29

[LAUNDERLAND: COIN-OP LAUNDRY]

30
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,950
Hey !

31
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,180
I mean: hello.

32
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,010
Hi.

33
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,520
Do you need change ?

34
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,710
No, I'm fine.

35
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,350
Okay.

36
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,730
Where do you work ?

37
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,870
Saks.

38
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,750
Oh. Saks.

Cool.

Sex with Avenue ?

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,330
Where do you work ?

43
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,800
In my studio. I'm an artist.

44
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

45
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,080
- Me too.
- Oh really ? What kind?

46
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,690
I draw. What do you do?

47
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm involved in stencilling.

48
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,030
You know Holy Dog Amplifiers?

49
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,180
I do the logo.

Yeah, I'll show you.

51
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,400
This is, like, some thumbs I did.

52
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,480
It's all, you know. Like, soon they'll all find them obviously and..

53
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,600
This is my favourite one.

54
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I've called this Font Los Angeles because..

55
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,400
This is Los Angeles. This is my favourite one.

56
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,360
I'm an okay guy, by the way.

57
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,840
You didn't have to tell me that.

58
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,420
I didn't have to come.

59
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,030
I could tell.

60
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,630
Well, how could you tell?

61
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,200
'Cause I'm a really poor judge of character.

62
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,930
I am a poor judge of character as well.

63
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,980
The worst.

64
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,540
Excuse me, young lady.

65
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,170
Two things.

66
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,400
One: I was wondering if I could have a change from you..

67
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,640
..because my stuff's still damp.

68
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,440
And two:

69
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,640
I was wondering if I could, please..

70
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
..have your phone number, so that I could..

71
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,260
..give you a call.

72
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,850
I'm Jeremy.

73
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,920
I will call you.

74
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,350
[If you do want me..]

75
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,000
[..give me little sugar]

76
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,680
[If you don't want me..]

77
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,900
[..don't lead me on, girl]

78
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,740
[But if you need me..]

79
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,360
[..show me that you love me]

80
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,170
[And when I'm feeling blue]

81
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,400
[And I want you]

82
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,080
[There's just one thing that you should do.]

83
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,010
[Just give me some kind of sign, oh baby..]

84
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,720
[To show me that you're mine, girl.]

85
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,570
[Oh, yeah!]

86
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,000
[To show me you're mine..]

87
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,420
Sorry.

88
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,020
I'll get it.. I'll get it next time, okay?

89
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,300
Sorry.

90
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,650
- Hi.
- Hi.

91
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,500
You look nice.

92
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,340
Yeah ?
Yeah. . thanks.

93
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,280
Are you ready..

94
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,520
..to have the time of your life?

95
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,150
Okay!

96
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,900
I'm ready.

97
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,060
All right, young lady.

98
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,420
It's fantastic, isn't it ?

99
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,470
Yeah.

100
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,600
Are we going in ?

101
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,020
Go in?

102
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,820
Oh no.

103
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,740
I stop and look at it.

104
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,450
So.. we would just sit here, then ?

105
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,550
Yeah.

106
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,330
Or walk around.

107
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,890
This place is called 'seawalk'.

108
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,060
You got to eat and attend to my date book.

109
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,880
It's not called city-going-to-see-a-movie.

110
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,490
Ticket's like 10 bucks.

111
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,650
I like it here.

112
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,710
Peaceful.

113
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,180
I come here to think about thumbs.

114
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,300
I've actually been working on a thumb for you.

115
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,690
It's my most favourite.

116
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,880
The Ls go like that.

117
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,280
- We could split it.
- Okay, let's split it.

118
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,990
- Okay.
- Okay, could you, can I borrow a few bucks ?

119
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,000
Congratulations, you've officially gone on a date with Jeremy.

120
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,850
Don't forget to hold the handle when you lock the door.

121
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,750
52 steps!

122
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,660
- Well, thanks for driving me.
- Can I see your place?

123
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,690
I think I should go to bed.

124
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,500
I'm tired.

125
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:12,950
Cool.

126
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,090
So.

127
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,880
- Good night.
- Oh, okay, okay, okay.

128
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,120
Well, let me give you my number.

129
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,080
Have you got a pen ?

130
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,290
Oh.

131
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,150
Yeah.

132
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,350
I do.

133
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,190
You got a paper ?

134
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,430
Yeah.

135
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,200
How high is that ? You ever jumped off that ?

136
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,320
I would jump it.

137
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,370
Mirabelle ?

138
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,080
Yup.

139
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,880
Can I kiss you or what ?

140
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,390
The point being ?

141
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,500
Thank you.

142
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,510
Oh, hey, you.. you look good too.

143
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,640
Hey, Jeremy!

144
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,620
Yeah ?

145
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Are you the kind of person that takes time to..

146
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,800
..to get to know and then once you get to know them..

147
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,200
..they're fabulous ?

148
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,200
Yes.

149
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,100
- Yes, absolutely.
- Fuck.

150
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,220
What ?

151
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes.

152
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,970
- Okay.
- Okay.

153
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,220
No.. Okay.

154
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,110
I love you. Okay, Good night!

155
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,090
Good night.

156
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,430
[Good night!]

157
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,050
[Good night..!]

158
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,400
You see, Susan.

159
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,480
Your husband doesn't understand that it's..

160
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,200
- ..afterglow that's important to a woman.
- Uh huh.

161
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,400
- Much more important than the sex act itself.
- Cool.

162
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,220
A woman needs to be held..

163
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,480
..even if, and science has shown this, it's by someone she
doesn't care about.

164
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,720
Protective hormones are released and the amount of hormones..

165
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,320
..released depends on the degree to which she is held.

166
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,330
The first in best is the complete surround.

167
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,600
He wraps you in those arms, whispers how beautiful you are ..

168
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,700
Second best is the arm around.

169
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,750
He's next to you but with one arm around you.

170
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,880
Third is he's just next to you on his elbow.

171
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,730
But he rests his hand on your stomach and looks at you.

172
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Fourth is you snuggling up to him with your head on his chest.

173
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,290
Well, he looks away into space.

174
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,350
But when the first best happens you feel completely wonderfully..

175
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,450
..like a woman.

176
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:26,820
God..!

177
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,880
Jeremy ?

178
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,570
Jeremy?

179
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,960
Jeremy ?

180
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,230
Jeremy !!

181
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,360
Wow.

182
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,830
Jeremy !!

183
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,450
- Hello ?
- Hello ?

184
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,700
- Hey.

185
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,820
Is this.. Is this Jeremy ?

186
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:28,950
Yeah.

187
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,560
Do you know who this is.

188
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:31,950
Yeah.

189
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,850
It's Mirabelle.

190
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,340
Did you just dial me ?

191
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,350
Yeah.

192
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,650
Did you know that..

193
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,490
Um.

194
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,650
- What?
- Uhh..

195
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,970
- That you what ?
- That, uhh..

196
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,130
- Oh..
- What ?

197
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,360
Nothing.

198
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,490
Oh God!

199
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,570
Okay, well.

200
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,900
Mirabelle.

201
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,340
I was wondering if you wanted me to come over.

202
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:03,950
Yeah.

203
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,220
Yeah ?

204
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,350
Yeah!

205
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,100
I'm just..hanging out, really.

206
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,920
- All right.
- Yeah.

207
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,440
- Okay, I'm gonna come over.
- Okay.

208
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,600
Uh, like, when ?

209
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,250
Well, um ..

210
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,000
Um. I'm in the middle of a lot of things right now..

211
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,420
..so..

212
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,680
Maybe like ten minutes ?

213
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,080
Hi !

214
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,210
Hi.

215
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,520
I brought fries.

216
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,770
I can tell.

217
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,400
How could you tell ?

218
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,140
I can see through the bag.

219
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,760
Oh yeah.

220
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,610
You're really good.

221
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,760
- Come on in.
- Yeah? Great!

222
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,430
Oh great!

223
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,740
Uh! Sorry ! Sorry!

224
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,300
It's okay.

225
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,800
Okay, hey, is that the bedroom ?

226
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,220
What ?

227
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah ?

228
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,880
Have you got a condom ?

229
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,770
Oh, I've got one. I've got.

230
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:58,960
Oh shit.

231
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,220
What ?

232
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,640
It's a mint!

233
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,220
What ?

234
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,040
I.. I grabbed the wrong package.

235
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,370
It's a mint, it's not a condom.

236
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Do you have one ?

237
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,330
No.

238
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,150
Yeah!

239
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,220
Do you have a ..um, baggy?

240
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,420
What ?

241
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,280
If you had, like, a jiffy baggy..

242
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,780
..well, I could , I could, like, use it, you know.

243
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,770
Oh God.

244
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,600
You will have to go and get one.

245
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,370
Okay. Cool.

246
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,680
Where do you keep them ?

247
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,100
What ?

248
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,560
The jiffy baggies ? Where do you keep them ?

249
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,030
No, a condom.

250
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,650
Kinda breaks the romantic mood.

251
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,960
Do you wanna just talk ?

252
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,150
Yeah.

253
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,200
Say, 'scuse me, bro.

254
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,850
That was quick.

255
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,150
Yeah.

256
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,600
Where'd you get it ?

257
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,710
Well, I was..

258
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,600
..out there, and bumped on the neighbour Kenny.

259
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,980
I just asked him if had any, uhh..

260
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,050
- Oh God!
- And it was like.. that.

261
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,080
Do you still want to do it ?

262
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,540
Do you want a massage?

263
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,320
- Ow!
- What! What happened?

264
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:19,530
Ow.

265
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,070
- Someone's hitting my balls.
- Someone ?

266
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,440
Bad Sylvia !

267
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry. Ow, are you okay ?

268
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,280
Yeah, it's like someone's throwing marshmallows at me.

269
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,490
Ow.

270
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,720
Are you okay that--?

271
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,150
Yeah.

272
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,560
Does this happen often ?

273
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,060
Yeah, every night.

274
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,910
Maybe we should just go home.

275
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,330
No.

276
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,950
No, stay.

277
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,770
Amplifiers are so underappreciated.

278
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,700
What ?

279
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,320
They could be so cool, okay? But nobody cares about design,
you know.

280
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,200
It pisses me off.

281
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,680
Mac designs a cool computer, everybody goes out
and they buy it!

282
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,370
And.. a band! A rock n' roll band..

283
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,000
..lives or dies.

284
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Bother amplifiers.. and they're sold..

285
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,320
..like fridgerators.

286
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,080
Hell, it's that ridiculous, come on!

287
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,040
The amp should have a stick!

288
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,990
I mean: yeah.

289
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,600
I mean: amp should still be like cool things!

290
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
You know, like cars.

291
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,440
Like swords!

292
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,600
Not like appliances.

293
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,200
And that is why..that is why my boss, my business is going under.

294
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,000
Because..he, he, he's used his all his merch.

295
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,330
That's merchandise.

296
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,930
Maybe you should do something about it?

297
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,470
Huh ?

298
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,320
He's never coming to my party again.

299
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,420
- Never.
- Pather's so .. fat.

300
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,400
- Uh, at worst.
- That was like he was going to lose his grip.

301
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,600
You want something ?

302
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,200
- Seeing anything you want?
- No, thank you.

303
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,280
But I saw some people who were dressed good.

304
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,520
- Excuse me ?
- Oh..yes, I'm sorry ?

305
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,580
Is he famous ?

306
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,680
I'm not sure.. Extraterrestrials?

307
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,340
- Haven't seen that.
- Neither have I.

308
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,960
How'd you know who he was then ?

309
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,840
Osmosis.

310
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,630
Would you like to see something ?

311
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,300
Yeah..

312
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,970
Those, uh..

313
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,800
..gray ones and those black ones.

314
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,150
Okay.

315
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,600
How does it work? Is it one size fits all or..?

316
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,800
They come in different sizes, but mostly they'll fit anybody.

317
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,060
Unless.. you know.

318
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,090
She's..

319
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,080
Big.

320
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,400
I don't know. What do you think ?

321
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Well, it depends on the dress.

322
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,150
What color is the dress ?

323
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:02,870
Um ..

324
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,720
I'll just ..

325
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,110
I'll just take the gray ones.

326
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:08,950
Safe.

327
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,540
Safe ?

328
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,150
Why, do you think the black ?

329
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,470
I like the black.

330
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,140
Okay. I'll take the black.

331
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,470
Okay.

332
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,150
$145.

333
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,620
I'll just put it in there.

334
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,700
Thank you.

335
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,900
Thank you.

336
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,240
Okay.. Chet!

337
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,020
What ?

338
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,000
Hey!

339
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
You know what I've been thinking ?

340
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,250
I have no idea.

341
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,520
Well, how could you.

342
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,400
I'm doing the thinking, always.. Listen!

343
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,110
Chet. Who hangs out with rock musicians on the road ?

344
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,090
- Who ?
- Other rock musicians.

345
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:24,750
And ?

346
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,640
If you had someone on the road..

347
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,400
..with the band, you know, one of the bands that uses our stuff..

348
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,480
..with someone, who looks real sharp, you know..

349
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,720
..someone who is musicians-related..

350
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,000
..then you could sell a lot of stuff that way.

351
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,880
And do you have someone in mind ?

352
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,230
Yeah.

353
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,410
Me.

354
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,970
Think about it.

355
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,920
Okay. Smell.

356
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,050
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
DINNER WITH YOU...

357
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,270
- Arigato!
- Arigato.

358
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,950
- Arigato!
- Arigato.

359
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,350
- Arigato.
- Arigato.

360
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,740
- Arigato..
- Arigato.

361
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,470
- Arigato.
- Arigato.

362
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,370
- Did you get my package?
- Oh!

363
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,200
I always seem to be sneaking up on you but I'm not.

364
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,490
Right, I was.. distracted by.. global commerce.

365
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,010
So.

366
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,600
Did you get my package?

367
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,000
Uhh, yes. Thank you.

368
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:33,670
And ?

369
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,190
Who are you ?

370
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,890
Good point.

371
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,880
I'm Ray Porter, hi.

372
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,280
- How are you?
- Hi.

373
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,480
Look, I know you can't be seen chatting up customers, so..

374
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,120
..why don't you just meet me on Friday, for dinner..

375
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,310
..at 8 o' clock ?

376
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,200
While Ray Porter explains his presumption and getting her address..

377
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,000
..and sending her the gloves..

378
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,570
..Mirabelle sighes him up and no alarm bell sounds.

379
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,600
She asks him several questions and gets a particular kind of checklist..

380
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,000
..for a man over 50.

381
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,360
Divorced, two houses, one in L.A. and one in computer-oriented Seattle..

382
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,160
..which is source of his wealth.

383
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,700
What time?

384
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,140
8.

385
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,280
But the one question she does not ask him..

386
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,800
..which is foremost in her mind is..

387
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,920
.."why me?".

388
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,080
Hey!

389
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,490
Hi.

390
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,130
Mind if I join you?

391
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,690
We see each other but we don't know each other.

392
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,680
- I'm Lisa.
- Mirabelle.

393
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,560
You ever have men ask you out of the store ?

394
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,220
Daily.

395
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,120
And do you ever go out with them ?

396
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,680
Depends.

397
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,810
Somebody asked you out?

398
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,870
You want some advice?

399
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,450
You never call him.

400
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
But if he calls you you talk to him..

401
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,400
..then act like you have another call.

402
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,360
Keep him on for a long time.

403
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,400
Like the longer than you think it is possible.

404
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
And break dates.

405
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,730
Always break dates.

406
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,930
Right there on the holidays, and then he is just stuck.

407
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,230
And fellatio.

408
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,120
The sooner the better.

409
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,820
And a lot.

410
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,790
Act like you love it.

411
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,440
After he's addicted cut him off.

412
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,480
That's when you got him.

413
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,430
Yeah, I couldn't do all that.

414
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,180
How come ?

415
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,180
I'm from Vermount.

416
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,380
Oouch.. Fudge!

417
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,320
- Hi.
- Hey.

418
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,360
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, please.

419
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,400
- You know, I, I think I can see your apartment from my house.
- Really?

420
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:55,490
Yes, because I live near the observatory and I can see
the observatory from your steps.

421
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,400
- Well, do you want to go or stay or..
- Um, well..

422
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,760
- Do you want to sit down?
- Yes. Great, thanks.

423
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:05,880
Oww!

424
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,280
Do you want something to drink ?

425
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,050
Pardon me ?

426
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,910
Drink ?
- Uh, yeah. What do you have?

427
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,040
White wine ?

428
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,510
That's great.

429
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
It's nice.. nice, uhh, neighbourhood.

430
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,810
Yeah, I really like it.

431
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,300
Thank you.

432
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,710
Should we go?

433
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:02,750
Yeah.

434
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah. Let's go.

435
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,280
Wow.

436
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,110
You know.

437
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,130
- That's, uhh. foot-ton, right?
- Yeah.

438
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,660
You'll like the Cha-cha-cha, it's fun.

439
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:24,610
So.

440
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,800
You know what you're gonna have?

441
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,250
Yeah, I always get the jag chicken.

442
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,450
Is that an order or a command ?

443
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,680
Okay, so we need some, uhh.. date questions.

444
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,430
So let's see.

445
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,000
Where does your family live ?

446
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,630
Vermount.

447
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,950
Good relationship with your father ? I hope ?

448
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:48,950
Well.

449
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,290
My dad doesn't speak very much.

450
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,060
After Vietnam.

451
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:00,950
Okay.

452
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,430
Be honest. Maybe. If this were a TV dating show..

453
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,600
..would I be kicked off already and you'd be on to the next guy?

454
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,690
You'd still be on the show.

455
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,750
Good.

456
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,780
I like your watch.

457
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,100
Thank you.

458
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,400
It's a pretty Timex.

459
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah, but I'm out of date questions and..

460
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,820
..I'm on to date comments.

461
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,530
Now I'm your watch.

462
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,580
Very nice.

463
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,910
- Was I boring ?
- No. Was I?

464
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,830
A little bit.

465
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,290
Well, okay.

466
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,310
I don't think you should come in.

467
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,060
I'm not asking to.

468
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,740
- Meaning..?
Meaning..

469
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,480
I'll see you again ?

470
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:27,610
Oh.

471
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,270
Okay.

472
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,430
I'll be out of town about a week.

473
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,680
But would you like to have dinner on Friday?

474
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,550
We could eat at my place.

475
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,670
Okay.

476
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,420
[Here she comes, breaking through my window..]

477
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,850
[..in the early morning hours.]

478
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,260
[For the moment..]

479
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,460
[..I'm disrupted.]

480
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,050
[But in time she'll make me smile.]

481
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,550
[All the wondrous anim--]

482
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,890
[--bring us songs of calm.]

483
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,730
[They do no wrong.]

484
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,250
[They do no wrong.]

485
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,940
[You don't know just how much I miss you.]

486
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,470
[Yeah, my stomach aches in your absence.]

487
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,650
[I don't know what I'd do without you.]

488
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,080
- Hey, man, you saved our ass tonight.
- Oh, no sweat.

489
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,320
- What was that in?
- This is Holy Dog, it's the amp comp.

490
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,050
You know, it's one of those tiny bands.

491
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,590
I'm going to see you on the bus, man.

492
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,000
You want some dawg ?

493
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,200
Oh, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to just say no.

494
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,040
Good answer.

495
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,650
I'm into athletics.

496
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,400
Whatever. You wanna route us? Ride with us.

497
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:53,750
What?

498
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,000
We've got an extra bunk. Come on.

499
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,320
- Ride with you?
- Come on. We're leaving tomorrow morning.

500
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,930
Yeah? Great. All right.

501
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,520
- Come on.
- Let me get my gear and I've got to deal with some things but..

502
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,130
- Come on!
- All right.

503
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:23,820
Hello.

504
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,130
[Hey, it's Jeremy.]

505
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,230
[Jeremy. What are you doing?]

506
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,780
Meaning, now ?

507
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,640
[Yeah. Come over, I'm waiting for you to come over.]

508
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,300
It's too late.

509
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,320
[It's not too late.]

510
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,480
It is for me, I have to get up.

511
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,180
Come over.

512
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:44,960
I can't.

513
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,560
Come on.

514
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,410
No.

515
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,190
Oh, come on, I'm leaving town for a couple of months.

516
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,880
I can't.

517
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,830
Why not ?

518
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,890
Because I'm seeing someone.

519
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,340
You have a nice house.

520
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,400
Do you think it's too done ?

521
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,230
- No. It's nice.
- I didn't do it, it was like this when I bought it.

522
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,950
Do you want to sit down ?

523
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,800
Or do you want to go outside?

524
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,150
Okay.

525
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,090
Do you want some wine ?

526
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,700
Later.

527
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,570
Okay, yeah.

528
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,600
Okay, there's the termite sign.

529
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,840
And then, there's the mall. Yes!

530
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,520
I can see your building but not your apartment.

531
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,360
Take a look.

532
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,250
See the blue sign ?

533
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,150
Yeah.

534
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And right below that Silverlake boulevard.

535
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,280
- And just go over.
- Oh yeah!

536
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,630
See ?

537
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,130
- You all right?
- Yes.

538
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,980
Aperture ?

539
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,720
There's a dealer who takes my drawings..

540
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,110
..and he sells them occasionally.

541
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,280
How often do you do it ?

542
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,890
About every six months.

543
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,370
Why so few?

544
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,550
I don't know. Really.

545
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,930
You sure you don't want some wine ?

546
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,750
I'm sure.

547
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,980
Thank you.

548
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,270
You wanna see the rest of the house ?

549
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,430
Let's go.

550
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,710
Let's see.You've got all three types of recycle bins.

551
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,880
And the whole, uhh..

552
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,750
battery, all the closets.

553
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,090
This, just.. You see, you just put things over.

554
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,630
A garage.

555
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,760
Bedroom.

556
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,700
Nice view.

557
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,570
Let me turn off the phones.

558
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,380
[Hi, it's Ray Porter, leave a message after the beep.]

559
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,120
All right, okay.

560
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,400
- All right, here's where you sleep.
- Okay, cool.

561
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,100
All right.

562
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,370
Here's your headphones. Go to sleep with the music.

563
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,460
Come on, we're gonna make mohitos.

564
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,570
What's mohito ?

565
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,640
Fancy drink.

566
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,020
All right.

567
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,390
I wanna fly !

568
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:26,820
Yeah !

569
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:29,820
Yeah !

570
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,360
[Relax.]

571
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,100
[Relax your toes and breathe.]

572
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,920
[Relax your ankles and breathe.]

573
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,950
[Feel your hands, flex them.]

574
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,750
[Fix your eyes on an object in front of you.]

575
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,310
[Quiet your mind. Feel the sensation of being alive.]

576
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:41,600
Hey.

577
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,310
Is it okay that I make a speech ?

578
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,150
Okay.

579
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,600
I wasn't really looking for anything permanent right now.

580
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,910
Though I really liked seeing you.

581
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,540
I'm just travelling so much right now.

582
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,600
But I thought maybe we should just..

583
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,280
..keep our options open.

584
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,530
Do you understand ?

585
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:08,950
I do.

586
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,920
Yes, Mirabelle, the fourth floor. How do things go with the glove man ?

587
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,020
Oh yeah! Tell us all about it!

588
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,800
Spill it ! You like him ? Does he like you ?

589
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,720
What.. He said he was surprised he was interested in me.

590
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,080
I told her there was no possibility that this was a long-term
relationship.

591
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,440
She's.. you know, she's really too young for me.

592
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,400
But you wanted to sleep with her.

593
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:40,960
Oh yeah.

594
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,660
He said he wants to give it a try.

595
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,320
And I said that even if I know that this is not long-term
I still want to see her.

596
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,720
And she understood ?

597
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,360
Oh yeah.

598
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,320
He said he wants to cut down on his travelling..

599
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,920
..I recently said that I like to sleep with her when I'm in town.

600
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,280
Is it he might..you know, stop travelling-- completely..

601
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,280
..and then we'd decide what to do it at that point.

602
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,000
Even though it's a sexual relationship..

603
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,320
..we still should be able to meet other people.

604
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,630
So he was really taking with you?

605
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,600
Yeah, it seemed like it.

606
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,280
So you were really clear with her that this
relationship has no future ?

607
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,050
Absolutely.

608
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,600
Well. You know how to find out if he really loves you ?

609
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:26,950
How ?

610
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,170
You call him sweetheart and watch what he does.

611
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,880
[I don't know what it is that makes me love you so..]

612
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,680
[I only know I never wanna let you go..]

613
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,080
['Cause you started something..]

614
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,550
[Oh, can't you see..]

615
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,490
[..that ever since we met you've had a hole on me.]

616
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,280
[It happens to be true.]

617
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,010
[I only wanna be with you.]

618
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,830
[It doesn't matter where you go and what you do.]

619
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,440
[I wanna spend each moment of the day with you.]

620
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,960
[Oh, look what has happened with just one kiss.]

621
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,630
[I never knew that I could be in love like this.]

622
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,690
[It's crazy but it's true.]

623
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,290
[I only wanna be with you.]

624
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,050
[You stopped and smiled at me.]

625
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,550
[Asked if I'd care to dance.]

626
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,100
[I fell into your open arms..]

627
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,040
[..and I didn't stand a chance.]

628
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,250
[Now listen, honey, I just wanna be beside you everywhere.]

629
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,280
[As long as we're together, honey, I don't care.]

630
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,200
['Cause you started something..]

631
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,740
[..oh, can't you see?]

632
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,230
[That ever since we met you've had a hole on me.]

633
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,150
[No matter what you do..]

634
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,550
[..I only wanna be with you!]

635
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,280
Hey, Luther, we've been listening to the same tapes for weeks.

636
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,400
What do you say we get some new stuff ?

637
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,940
And what do they got ?

638
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,520
Mostly yoga, piattis, Chreotechnics.

639
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,060
And look at these.

640
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,820
- Hell of a woman.
- Yeah.

641
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,290
- You need that woman.
- What ?

642
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,630
There's more relationships stuff.

643
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:25,670
Here.

644
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,260
We're getting it ?

645
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,270
Let's just get them all. We're on the road till February.

646
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,070
- Okay.
- All right ?

647
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,430
I guess we'll love women now.

648
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,650
Happy birthday.

649
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,320
- Thank you, mister!
- Anything you don't like it, you know, you can take back.

650
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,320
You know I never return anything you give me.

651
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:52,000
Yeah but there are a lot of women, just waiting
for me so it's okay.

652
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,910
You're sweet.

653
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,820
By the way, you know, my birthday is tomorrow.

654
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,300
It is really ?

655
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,480
Okay, you know, I'll take it as a computer error.

656
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,880
I'm going to fix that and next year..

657
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,200
..everything will be good.

658
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:05,900
Next year?

659
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,640
Next year ?!

660
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,830
Next year you'll be dead.

661
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,600
Well, do you want to open 'em tomorrow or you don't want to wait?

662
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,790
No, I love gifts.

663
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:24,980
Oh my God!

664
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,320
It's beautiful !

665
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,800
- You like it?
- I love it!

666
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,060
Thank you so much.

667
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,880
Should I try it on ?

668
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,160
Yes.

669
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,480
Hey, I've got to go to New York in about six weeks for e-Vent weekend.

670
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,320
You wanna go? You think you could get off ?

671
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,370
Oh my God, yes!

672
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,740
You're gonna need a dress.

673
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,810
What kind of dress?

674
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,400
Well, it's a tuxedo thing so whatever that is.

675
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,990
I could take you to Armani next week.

676
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,930
You look beautiful.

677
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,300
Excuse me.

678
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,820
Ray..?

679
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:56,940
What ?

680
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,610
I've never had a dress fitted on me before.

681
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,800
[Feel the sensation of being alive.]

682
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,310
[Feel what it means to be alive.]

683
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,970
[Only from this place, of pure existence can you begin to change..]

684
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,560
[..to turn yourself into a being, capable of loving another person.]

685
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,140
Hey, you're gonna be late.

686
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,060
You're all right ?

687
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,270
Good.

688
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,640
I feel good too.

689
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,800
I think I like the look of the brown ones.

690
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,920
Would you like--

691
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,930
Are you all right ?

692
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,270
Yes. Fine, thank you.

693
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,630
I'll be back in five minutes.

694
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,780
Hey, it's Ray.

695
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,200
You haven't returned my call. Are you all right ?

696
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:10,830
I'm fine.

697
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,270
You don't sound fine.

698
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,630
I'm okay.

699
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:20,490
Hey, guess what. I'm not hanging up until you tell me what's wrong.

700
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,180
Have you ever taken anti-depressants ?

701
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:27,530
No.

702
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,150
I do.

703
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,260
But I stopped.

704
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,150
And ?

705
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:40,980
And, uhh..

706
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,820
The doctor says that.. maybe I shouldn't have.

707
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:51,480
All right. I'm gonna come over there and get you
and we're gonna go to the doctor.

708
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,490
You call him and let him know we're coming.

709
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,590
Here, I've got something for you.

710
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,720
What's this?

711
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,750
I know it's not on the way but it's your ticket to New York city.

712
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,410
Thanks.

713
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:43,850
[LOVE, RAY]

714
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,090
Hello ?

715
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,170
You there ?

716
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:09,750
Just.

717
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,030
Hey, umm.

718
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,600
- Do you have plans for tonight ?
- Someone.

719
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,000
Could you cancel 'em ?

720
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,240
I could be there in three hours.

721
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,610
I could cancel 'em.

722
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:23,430
Good.

723
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,080
Have you eaten yet ?

724
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,600
No.. I wanted to wait.

725
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,400
Well, I'll bring some food from the plane.

726
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,850
- Plane food?
- Private plane food.

727
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,400
Hi, it's Mirabelle. Leave your name and number
and I'll call you back.

728
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,880
Oh, hey, Mirabelle in machine, it's Jeremy.

729
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,400
I'm calling you from..

730
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,170
..the road.

731
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,120
And I was calling to wish you a happy thanksgiving..

732
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,170
..and all that.

733
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:05,740
And ..

734
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:15,000
I think I might have directivied you instead of
treating you like the unique being of nature.

735
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,830
And even better I get to use the-roady-cellphone for free. No charge.

736
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,770
So, uhh.. I'm calling for free!

737
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,800
- Why are you leaving for work at 7:45?
- I've gotta go home to change.

738
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,280
Oh.. That could take an hour.

739
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:32,770
I know.

740
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,460
Do you want to stay at my place sometime ?

741
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,320
You know, I live 10 minutes from Saks, next time you come over..

742
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,730
..just leave some clothes here and you'll go to work from here.

743
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,230
Okay.

744
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,880
You know, I won't be able to see you till after thanksgiving.

745
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,820
Don't stuff yourself with all that turkey.

746
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,680
See you, sleepyhead.

747
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:45,320
I'm glad you called. You saved me from a dinner at Old Cakes N' Peanut Butter.

748
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,400
Hey, who always used to take me out of nice restaurants ?

749
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,320
Why don't you take yourself ?

750
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,370
Not in my club.

751
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,830
I ought to have brought food.

752
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,750
It's a little tricky.

753
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,230
Eat some.

754
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,240
Cholesterol.

755
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,320
- It's fish.
- It's eggs.

756
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,580
5,000 little eggs.

757
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:08,290
Please.

758
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,350
Are you seeing somebody ?

759
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:20,680
Yes.

760
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:22,810
No.

761
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,050
Is it serious ?

762
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,070
It's hard to say.

763
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,600
I've been really clear with her.

764
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,420
Are you in love with her ?

765
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,340
Question of the night.

766
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,390
How would you like to just lie there?

767
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,140
What do you mean ?

768
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,030
Tonight..

769
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,880
..how would you..

770
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,860
..Ray Porter..

771
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,140
..like to just lie there ?

772
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,720
And pretend like you're in Thailand.

773
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,060
And when it's all over I'll just slip away into the night.

774
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,700
Remember ?

775
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,900
Hi! What you're doing, Mister?

776
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,340
Just calling to say hello.

777
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,200
When you're coming down?

778
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:55,500
I mean, uhh.. we could have one of our nights.

779
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,020
Okay. Well, have a good night.

780
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:00,800
Bye.

781
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,050
Dear Mirabelle.

782
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,200
I suppose the only way to say this..

783
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,390
..is to say that.

784
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,550
I slept with someone.

785
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,240
It was not romantic or intimate.

786
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,720
And if I had it to do it all over again..

787
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,630
..I wouldn't.

788
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,880
I am not telling you this because I want our relationship
to change.

789
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,800
I am telling you this only because..

790
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,340
..you deserve to know.

791
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,570
I am sorry.

792
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,080
Ray.

793
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,200
I put it in a letter because I didn't want to change my mind..

794
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,370
..in the middle of telling you.

795
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,800
I can't go to New York with you now.

796
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,640
Oh, sweet ..

797
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,250
I can't go.

798
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,650
How can I go ?!

799
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:13,760
Hey.

800
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,280
You want to hear the stupidest thing of all?

801
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,400
I somehow thought it would be all right.

802
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,000
[Ray, it's counsellor--]

803
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,320
[Hey, Ray--]

804
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,670
[This is a call for Mr. Ray Porter--]

805
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,360
Hi, dad.

806
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,620
- Hi, mom.
- Hello, honey.

807
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,130
Dinner's ready!

808
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,740
I'll be there in a second!

809
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,880
You getting along okay ?

810
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:18,890
Out there ?

811
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:20,160
Yes.

812
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,060
Saks is fine and..

813
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,690
I sell a drawing sometimes.

814
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,520
--a new formula is much denser, much quicker to respond..

815
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,970
..and taking way more information--

816
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:03,900
Hello.

817
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,280
Mirabelle, it's for you.

818
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:16,700
Hello.

819
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:18,490
Hi.

820
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:22,210
Hi.

821
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,500
I'm sorry.

822
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,120
Why don't you come to New York ?

823
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:56,870
Okay.

824
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,180
[Eight weeks on tonight still]

825
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,450
[But all the other winters I spent]

826
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,760
[She lived in a house..]

827
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,450
[..where mission street bends.]

828
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:26,990
- Hey.
- Hey.

829
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,510
What's that ?

830
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,070
It's a homeling suit.

831
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,750
Homeling suit, what for ?

832
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,690
It's for the New York city.

833
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,750
A white suit for we're hitting New York city.

834
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:44,230
Cool.

835
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,930
You look like an angel.

836
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,090
I'm not ready to make love.

837
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,310
That's right.

838
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,020
I'm just glad you're here.

839
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,600
So, thank you for coming in..

840
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,120
We do need you to sign a few things.

841
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,670
Okay. What are they ?

842
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,200
Just some papers finishing off your loan.

843
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:23,550
Okay.

844
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:29,150
What do you mean: finishing off my loan ?

845
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,600
What do you mean ? Your loans were paid off.

846
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,800
Just need you to sign here..

847
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,570
..and here.

848
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:42,030
And congratulations. That must be quite a relief.

849
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,270
You are the sweetest man!

850
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,600
That's something I am able to do for you.

851
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,000
You do a lot for me.

852
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,000
I don't give you very much..

853
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,400
Financial things - yes.

854
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,150
But.. that's easy for me.

855
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,110
I know it's hard for you to be close.

856
01:11:58,920 --> 01:11:59,340
Sorry.

857
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,250
--there's one other.. this one.

858
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,960
It's made of saman, raw.

859
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,260
It's fabulous.

860
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,000
Caroline, it's Lisa.

861
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,400
Did you sell one of those flower-print dresses this week ?

862
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,240
Besides two.

863
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,660
Uh, yeah. Some guy came in, bought one for his girlfriend.

864
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,400
What is the name on the credit card?

865
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,290
Okay, hang on for a second.

866
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,160
Ray Porter ?

867
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,800
- Hello ?
- Hi, it's Ray, I'm just about to land.

868
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,920
I'll be about half an hour late, can I meet you at the gallery?

869
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:05,270
Okay.

870
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,540
Excuse me, young lady!

871
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,500
Mirabelle.

872
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,480
It's me.

873
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:28,760
Jeremy ?

874
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,700
- Nice to see you again.
- Hi!

875
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,340
I.. You look so different.

876
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,310
Yeah, I know.

877
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,630
Uhh, changes!

878
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,400
Do you realise that I've been on the road for a very long time now--

879
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,520
I guess you have, yeah.

880
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,000
Yeah, and .. I've been trying to break into the moment.

881
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,400
That's been my work.

882
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,600
I don't get paid for it but it's my unwork.

883
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:52,950
Work.

884
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,520
I feel unprepared to see you.

885
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,900
But it's so nice to see you again.

886
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,000
Are you going to the road to gallery ?

887
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:03,980
Yeah. Are you?

888
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm..

889
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,400
..leaving town tomorrow and I wasn't sure if I get the chance
to see the show before it closes...

890
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:14,000
..and I'm a huge fan of the..artist. Had a big influence
on my stencil.

891
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:14,420
Great.

892
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,800
- Two things.
- Yes.

893
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,080
One.

894
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,250
You look great.

895
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:20,650
And second.

896
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,510
Would you walk in there with me ?

897
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:24,930
- Sure.
- Yeah.

898
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,830
- Okay.
- Well, let's go.

899
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,270
You look amazing!

900
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,880
Well, you look amazing!

901
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:32,600
Are you taller?

902
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,200
- I'm on great heels.
- Really?

903
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:34,550
Yeah.

904
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,480
He's younger than I thought.

905
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,520
Are you going there alone ?

906
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,920
- I'm meeting a friend.
- Oh, she's ..

907
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:01,270
He's.

908
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,410
He's ..

909
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,600
You want something at the bar ?

910
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,080
- Not yet.
- I'm gonna get something so..

911
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:13,800
..see you in a minute ?

912
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,200
- Okay. I'll just be walking around.
- Okay.

913
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,250
Bye, Mirabelle.

914
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:24,810
Hi.

915
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,210
Can I have the mohito ?

916
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:28,370
Mohito.

917
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:35,480
For you.

918
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,690
Oh, my God.

919
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,080
I have never seen anyone else wore.. one of those.

920
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,670
Yeah, I just.. I just love the color.

921
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,120
Good.. I mean ..

922
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,370
- Yeah.
- Wait.

923
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,920
You have to take a first sip with your eyes closed.

924
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:53,620
Like this.

925
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:58,830
Go ahead.

926
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:00,630
See ?

927
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,080
Nothing to distract you from the very first taste.

928
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:04,920
How was it ?

929
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:06,500
Noisy.

930
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,520
I have a secret.

931
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:15,830
Go ahead.

932
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,930
I know who you are.

933
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,140
How do you know who I am ?

934
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,170
I hear about people who are working in the art.

935
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,180
I'm Lisa. Ray.

936
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,640
Hi Lisa Ray.

937
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,000
Sense of humour.

938
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,470
It's good, it's good.

939
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,500
You, uhm..

940
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,150
Do you ..

941
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,640
What is it ?

942
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,230
- I can't, I can't--
- What ?

943
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,080
- I can't--
- Just tell me.

944
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:49,710
I'm shy..

945
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,400
Stop.. Look, I'm shy.

946
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,290
Do you want a drink later ?

947
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:54,560
Yes.

948
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:56,820
Great.

949
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,520
When do you wanna leave ?

950
01:16:59,520 --> 01:16:59,800
Now!

951
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,690
You know what else I like ?

952
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,740
I think I like Ray Porter.

953
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,550
Oh, I can't wait to meet him.

954
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,220
Okay, bye!

955
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:16,480
Hey!

956
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:19,880
Sorry I'm late, you want to take a walk ?

957
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:20,230
Sure.

958
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,720
I don't have a car, could you give me a ride ?

959
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,260
Yeah, mine's in a lot.

960
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:33,520
- Hey, do you want to go to the IV? It's still early and everything.
- Sure.

961
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,690
Why don't we just go home ?

962
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:18,150
Okay.

963
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,860
Those handcuffs..?

964
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,270
We're gonna find out.

965
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,090
Mmm, Ray ..

966
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:40,900
Oh, Ray ..

967
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:43,950
Oh, Ray !

968
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,870
- Oh, Ray!
- Oh, Ray!

969
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,670
- Oh, Ray!
- Oh, Ray!

970
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,670
- Oh, Ray!
- Oh, Ray!

971
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,400
Well, we missed the Lakers.

972
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,310
Do you care ?

973
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,710
I wish I did - I'd be such a guy.

974
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:34,080
I'm gonna get some water.

975
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:37,000
- Oh, let me get you something!
- No, I'll get it. You want some ?

976
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:37,280
Yes.

977
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:40,650
Sweetheart.

978
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:41,740
What ?

979
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,160
Nothing.

980
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,000
Do you want a toast or toaster waffle ?

981
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,050
Toaster waffle.

982
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,370
Toaster waffle.

983
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,410
Hello ?

984
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,000
Oh, did I wake you ?

985
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,840
It's Jeremy.

986
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:17,350
Who ?

987
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,310
Sorry, speakerphone. It's Jeremy.

988
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,850
Oh.. Who's Jeremy ?

989
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,200
What do you mean: who's Jeremy ?

990
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,110
Have we met ?

991
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,700
This is Jeremy, we met last night.

992
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,200
Was that you, girl ?

993
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,400
Oh, you mean we met at the gallery ?

994
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,990
At the gallery, yes. We did all the--

995
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:47,420
I don't believe we did all the positions and you called me big daddy..

996
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:48,980
Oh, Ray ..

997
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:51,630
Oh, Ray !

998
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:54,890
Oh Ray.

999
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,490
Oh Ray, Oh Ray, Oh Ray, Oh Ray!

1000
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:00,940
What ?

1001
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,160
You don't know who this is ?

1002
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:09,350
Yeah.

1003
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,850
This is Ray Porter from last night.

1004
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:17,070
Okay. Who is Ray Porter ?

1005
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,270
Your waffle is ready.

1006
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,800
- Hey, guess what.
- What ?

1007
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,400
I'm moving into New York next week.

1008
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,000
I've decided to look for an apartment there.

1009
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,280
- You'll move there?
- No, it's just a place to stay when I'm there.

1010
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,960
No more luggage, woohoo!

1011
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,710
Like a crash-pad.

1012
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,510
You lucky mister.

1013
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,390
After I've looked for a three-bedroomed in case I meet someone
and have kids.

1014
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:54,780
I'm sorry.

1015
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,480
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

1016
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:05,680
Ray.

1017
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:11,890
Why don't you love me ?

1018
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,810
Are you just buying your time with me ?

1019
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,690
I thought you'd understood.

1020
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:43,270
So ..

1021
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,130
I can either hurt now..

1022
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,200
..or hurt later.

1023
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:01,910
Now, I guess.

1024
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,830
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
DINNER WITH YOU. RAY PORTER.

1025
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,990
[I had stayed in there, watching you]

1026
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,960
[hanging holds of cigarette]

1027
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,410
[She tells me her name]

1028
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,120
[And once again I'm with her 'cause]

1029

[Is a love that--]
- Goodbye, Mirabelle.

1031
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,060
And good luck.

1032
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,800
[This card comes with LOTS and LOTS and LOTS..
..of LOVE]

1033
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:18,030
Wait-- add another "LOTS" to that
I would like to have dinner with you, Jeremy (my treat)

1034
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,040
So can I borrow only two bucks ?

1035
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,390
I'm just kidding.

1036
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:44,950
Here.

1037
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:50,580
This is the only thing that really means to me in my life.

1038
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:51,690
Thanks.

1039
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,670
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1040
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:20,230
Okay.

1041
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,280
I've been reading a lot of books on tape..

1042
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:28,980
..about ..

1043
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:31,320
..getting into the moment.

1044
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:31,600
And.

1045
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:32,960
I think.

1046
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,050
This is the moment. And in the moment..

1047
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,940
..this moment.. I, I..

1048
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,750
..I think we should kiss.

1049
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:40,560
And, um.

1050
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,280
I've stood right here before and I've been hurt!

1051
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,170
I've been rejectifying you.

1052
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:50,280
And I'm gonna ask you to kiss me again.

1053
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:51,120
And .. um ..

1054
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:52,820
A-- And ..

1055
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,210
Will you just kiss me ?

1056
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:18,770
Jeremy.

1057
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,630
So what made you do all of this ?

1058
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,540
All of this what ?

1059
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:28,770
All this ..

1060
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:30,640
.. success ?

1061
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,780
Well, you did.

1062
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,250
- I did?
- Mhm.

1063
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:38,750
How ?

1064
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,900
Well, you said.. "just do it".

1065
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,840
So I did it.

1066
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,670
That's not very much.

1067
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,370
Yeah, but..

1068
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,270
I'll protect you.

1069
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,160
I will !

1070
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,650
Some nights alone he thinks of her.

1071
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,800
And some nights alone..

1072
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,200
..she thinks of him.

1073
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:50,400
Some nights these thoughts occur at the same moment.

1074
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:54,600
And Ray and Mirabelle are connected without ever knowing it.

1075
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:11,800
But Mirabelle, now feeling the warmth of her first reciprocal love..

1076
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,690
..has broken away from him.

1077
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,200
And as Jeremy offers her more of his heart,

1078
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:19,700
Mirabelle offers equal parts of herself in return.

1079
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,800
One night, sooner than she would have liked..

1080
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,800
..which made it irresistible..

1081
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,300
..they make love for the second time in 14 months.

1082
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,330
At this point..

1083
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:37,600
..Jeremy surpasses Ray Porter as a lover of Mirabelle..

1084
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,600
..because what he offers her..

1085
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,510
..is tender..

1086
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,570
..and true.

1087
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,320
[CURRENT EXHIBITION]

1088
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:08,000
So.

1089
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,320
- The night we'll go from influe--, one of those
- Yeah.

1090
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:12,400
- read of.. uhh, um..
- Yeah.

1091
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,430
- D, D, D, D.. Do ?
- Doobie.

1092
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,580
- Doobie?
- Doobie? I don't.. Dobiah ?

1093
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,130
What is it called ?

1094
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,080
I'm just gonna go talk to my friend.

1095
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,830
I'll be back in a second.

1096
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:39,000
My girlfriend did these.

1097
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,880
- Did you get my birthday present ?
- I did!

1098
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:44,230
Yeah.

1099
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,920
Did you get my thank-you note ?

1100
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:49,020
Oh. Yeah. Yes, yes. I'm sorry.

1101
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,470
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

1102
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:53,980
You look nice.

1103
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:54,980
Thank you.

1104
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,330
Are you happy ?

1105
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:58,750
I am.

1106
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,320
- A lower intensity is nice.
- Yeah.

1107
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,600
Who's your girlfriend ?

1108
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:06,930
Uh, she's a doctor.

1109
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,610
Hypochondriac no more ?

1110
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:10,800
Shall take you out!

1111
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,760
Well, she's a gynaecologist.

1112
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,180
Then you'll have a lot to discuss.

1113
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:18,530
Are you happy ?

1114
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:19,270
Yeah.

1115
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:22,080
I'm.. I'm always a low edgy.

1116
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,430
Restless.

1117
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:26,250
That's a good word.

1118
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,080
I want you to have a drawing of me sleeping.

1119
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:34,880
It's in the gallery.

1120
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,200
You don't have to do that.

1121
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,020
No, I want you to have it.

1122
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:42,020
I made it while we were seeing each other.

1123
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,300
Thank you.

1124
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:47,220
And , uh..

1125
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,510
Just so you know.

1126
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,720
I'm sorry for the way I treated you.

1127
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:55,890
I know.

1128
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,450
I did love you.

1129
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,300
All right.

1130
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:02,280
As Ray Porter watched his Mirabelle walk away..

1131
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,540
..he feels a loss.

1132
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,910
How is it possible.. - he thinks.

1133
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:09,480
..to miss a woman whom he kept at a distance..

1134
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,000
..so that when she was gone..

1135
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,680
..he would not miss her.

1136
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,600
Only then did he realise how wanting part of her..

1137
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,000
..and not all of her..

1138
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,540
..had hurt them both..

1139
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,280
..and how he cannot justify his actions..

1140
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,330
..except that..

1141
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:26,360
..well..

1142
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:28,300
..it was life.
