No, actually,
this little boy's name is Tim.

816
00:53:47,505 --> 00:53:49,990
I like the name Tim.

Go on.

818
00:53:51,993 --> 00:53:54,662
<i>Tim's little brother</i>
<i>was always pestering Tim</i>

819
00:53:54,663 --> 00:53:56,914
to make him paper airplanes,

820
00:53:56,915 --> 00:54:00,217
uh, because he was
really good at it.

821
00:54:00,218 --> 00:54:03,787
But Tim had much bigger
dreams than that.

00:54:03,788 --> 00:54:06,657
Okay. Then what happened?

823
00:54:06,658 --> 00:54:09,693
Uh, one day, Tim went out
to the backyard

824
00:54:09,694 --> 00:54:14,765
and he put leaves and--
And taped branches to his arms

825
00:54:14,766 --> 00:54:17,100
and started climbing
the big oak tree.

826
00:54:17,101 --> 00:54:20,854
<i>His little brother said,</i>
<i>"Tim, you can't fly."</i>

827
00:54:20,855 --> 00:54:23,407
<i>And he said,</i>
<i>"Yeah? You just watch."</i>

828
00:54:23,408 --> 00:54:27,695
He got all the way to the top
and jumped.

829
00:54:29,397 --> 00:54:32,265
How tall was this tree?

830
00:54:32,266 --> 00:54:34,518
<i>Um-- Uh, it was--</i>
<i>It was pretty tall.</i>

831
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:35,936
<i>He broke his arm.</i>

832
00:54:35,937 --> 00:54:38,839
Oh, my God--
This is a horrible story.

833
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,191
Oh, no, no. It gets better.

834
00:54:40,192 --> 00:54:41,559
Uh, from that experience,

835
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:46,330
Tim realized that
he wanted to fly.

836
00:54:46,331 --> 00:54:50,667
So he dedicated his life
to making spaceships.

00:54:50,668 --> 00:54:53,336
I thought you said
this was a good story.
