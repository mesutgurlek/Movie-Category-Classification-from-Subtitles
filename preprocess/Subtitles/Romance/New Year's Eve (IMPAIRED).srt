617
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,062
Because they have something
to be excited about.

618
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,394
I have something to be excited about.

619
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,934
Oh, oh, oh.

620
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,315
Who were you gonna kiss at midnight?

621
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,817
Oh. And then it's one big giant letdown.

622
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,950
See, that's the problem with New Year's.

623
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:52,660
Everybody builds up such high expectation
that they're inevitably, utterly disappointed.

624
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,871
Hey, can you get through
that ceiling hatch?

625
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,458
I am not Spider-Man.

626
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,918
Clearly. Clearly.

627
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:04,043
If I just climb right through there,
get out that window.

628
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,632
And we're gonna be out of here.
I am gonna do it.

629
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,556
Lift me up. Lift me up.
I don't have all day.

630
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,391
RANDY: There you go.
- Oh.

631
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,767
It's a lock.

632
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,726
Oh, I have a nail file.
I'll file it with my nail file.

633
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,356
I'll file through it.

634
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,810
Ugh. You're a groupie?

635
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,156
Put me down.

636
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,536
MARVIN: I got hats and horns and hazarai.
I got streamers--

637
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,823
- Hey, Marvin. Hi. Happy New Year.
- Hey, Kim.

638
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,617
HAILEY: Mom, can I go tell my friends?
KIM: Sure, yeah.

639
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,830
Go ahead.

640
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,995
So Hailey and I
are having a party tonight.

641
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,538
SETH:
Hey, wait up.

642
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,458
- Hey. Um...
- Hey.

643
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,001
I can't come.

644
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,513
What? Hailey, what do you mean?
Half the history class is going.

645
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,094
- I know. It's just my mom won't let me.
- You serious?

646
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,555
I know. I sound like I'm 12, I know.

647
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:57,437
All right, where's your mom? Maybe I--

648
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,644
- Hi. Hi, Mrs. Doyle.
- Hi.

649
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,149
You look lovely today.

650
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:04,357
You seem like a nice boy.
I'm just not comfortable with Hailey...

651
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,773
...spending tonight in Times Square
unsupervised.

652
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,488
Right. With all due respect...

653
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,529
...supervision is for kids, you know?
We're young adults.

654
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,036
Who are you calling?

655
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,166
- You're Rose Anderson's son, right?
- Yeah.

656
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:22,250
Yeah, we serve together on your
school's academic booster club.

657
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:27,338
Oh. You know, I think she left her cell
phone at home. She gonna go out tonight.

658
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,219
- Oh.
- Yeah.

659
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,841
Okay.

660
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,176
Happy New Year.

661
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,841
Yeah. Happy New Year.

662
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,092
KIM:
You wanna say goodbye?

663
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,095
So?

664
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,229
Hailey, I tried. But she fights dirty.

665
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,900
Yeah, I know. Welcome to my life.

666
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,777
- Bye.
- Bye.

667
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,985
Ladies, let's go. Yo. Ladies, let's roll out!

668
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,403
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:17,054
INGRID:
What is this neighborhood? Is it safe?

670
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,810
PAUL:
Give it a chance.

671
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:22,347
That should be on your resolution list:
"Give Paul a chance."

672
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,354
INGRID:
I don't like it here.

673
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,937
Maybe this is a really bad idea.
I'll just give you the tickets.

[SINGING]
Give Paul a chance

675
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,026
Just give me a chance and I'll show you

676
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,781
What I can do.

677
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,238

678
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,708
...go to Bali.

00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,223
It's Bali.

680
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,016
It's Brooklyn.

681
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,767
It's a spa.

683
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,002
Thank you.

RISA: I'm sorry. We really can't take you
this early yet.

685
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,961
Dr. Morriset says that you're not ready.
You'll have to come back in a few hours.

686
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,926
We may not have been ready,
but now she's eating anchovies...

00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,090
...which the Internet claims induce labor.

688
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,759
If only you can keep it down.

Yeah, but it really doesn't go that fast.

- No. I can't do it. I can't do it.
- Excuse me.

692
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,153
I'm sorry.

00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,939
I tried. I can't do it anymore.

You need a breath mint.

Hey, Risa. So we are ready
to check in now.

TESS:
They're checking in?

Hey. Good to see you again.

698
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:10,630
You must be joking, because inside
I'm laughing really, really hard.

You really think you can come into this
at the last minute and steal our money?

I'm sorry, are you being serious?

You are even a bigger numbnuts
than you look.

00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,842
This little fish won't save you.

704
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,642
You probably don't even know
that yams can kick-start labor.

705
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,227
Well, yeah, actually, we do.

706
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,359
In fact, at this moment, my wife is
full of yams, but thank you.

Crammed with yams.

Snap. It doesn't.

709
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,110
It stops pre-term labor.

- Did he just snap me in a maternity ward?
- Yes.

711
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,036
You're a really hostile guy.

712
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,080
Where do you work, the DMV?

713
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,832
No, I run a charm school.

Oh, yeah? Where's your charm school
Guantanamo?

It's on 48th and Madison,

Because you could really
use some charm.

Well, actually,

so you'll all have to come back later.

Yes, Piper's mom.

- Come on. I'm not that bad.
- Mom, you've stopped trying.

You're being clingy and mean,
because you don't have a man in your life.

supposed to take me to the rental car shop!

So you can get your car back.
Right there. Initials.

Keep the pen, it's got my name on it.

all the rental places close at 3?
