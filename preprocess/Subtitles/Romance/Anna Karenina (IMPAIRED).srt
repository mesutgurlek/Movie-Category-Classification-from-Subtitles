No. Very well.

I've never been in Moscow society, really.

But you know my name.

Have you guessed who she is?

98
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,854
I... I have a suspicion.
Why didn't you propose when you were here?

I decided it was impossible.

Kitty is of the heavens, an angel.
And I am of the earth.

Let's say, 5:30 at l'Angleterre.

I owe them more than the Hermitage,

989
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:34,552
I went to the market in person.

990
01:16:37,681 --> 01:16:39,265
An extra place.

991
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:44,688
I've come to tell you
our connection must be severed.

992
01:16:45,855 --> 01:16:47,440
I'm going to divorce your sister.

993
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:49,943
Divorce?

(GASPS)

995

Oh, dear me, what are you
talking about? (CHUCKLES)

996
01:16:53,863 --> 01:16:55,573
Well, don't be in a hurry. Stay to dinner.

997
01:16:55,615 --> 01:16:56,616
And later, you can talk it over with Dolly.

998
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,952
Prince Oblonsky,
everything is over between our families.

999
01:16:59,035 --> 01:17:01,955
Alexei, divorce is one thing.
Dinner is quite another.

PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY: You
Petersburgers think yourselves so  <i>de bon ton</i>

1001
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:09,254
compared with dull, old-fashioned Moscow.

1002
01:17:09,462 --> 01:17:11,631
But we know how to do things.

1003
01:17:11,756 --> 01:17:12,841
Only the other day,

1004
01:17:12,924 --> 01:17:15,844
I hear Vasya Pryachnikov
fought a duel with Kvitsky and killed him.

1005
01:17:15,927 --> 01:17:17,012
Well, what...

1006
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:18,763
What was the challenge about?

1007
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:20,306
Pryachnikov's wife, naturally.

1008
01:17:20,348 --> 01:17:22,934
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY: It was a matter
of honor, defending a woman's honor.

1009
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:25,979
Sounds like barbarism to me.
What if the lover had killed the husband?

1010
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:28,648
Would that have preserved
the wife's honor, too?

1011
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:31,234
Still, not many of us can say
our lover died for love.

1012
01:17:31,443 --> 01:17:32,652
Love?

1013
01:17:32,902 --> 01:17:35,822
"Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife."

1014
01:17:45,373 --> 01:17:48,543
Would you die for love,
Konstantin Dmitrievich?

1015
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:51,004
I would. But not for my neighbor's wife.

1016

(LAUGHS)

1017
01:17:55,091 --> 01:17:57,594
An impure love is not love to me.

1018
01:17:58,261 --> 01:18:00,847
To admire another man's wife
is a pleasant thing,

1019
01:18:01,723 --> 01:18:04,517
but sensual desire indulged
for its own sake is greed,

1020
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:06,519
a kind of gluttony,

1021
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:09,606
and a misuse of something sacred,
which is given to us

1022
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:13,026
so that we may choose the one person
with whom to fulfill our humanness.

1023
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:17,906
Otherwise, we might as well be cattle.

1024
01:18:17,989 --> 01:18:19,616

01:18:31,336 --> 01:18:33,963

Look at me.

You will have no peace of mind
until you forgive her.

1032

It was Anna who taught me that.

1033
01:18:47,018 --> 01:18:48,561
I do not wish to forgive.

It was only a word or two.

1308
01:45:30,538 --> 01:45:31,998
I have a word or two for some people

1309
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:33,875
one didn't expect
to be rubbing shoulders with.

1310
01:45:35,001 --> 01:45:38,546
She has a nerve,
flaunting herself like a slut in society.

1311
01:45:42,842 --> 01:45:44,219
Yes, why don't you?

1312
01:45:44,302 --> 01:45:46,638
Rescue her and put your seal on the fiasco.

1313

BETSY: Alexei,

1314
01:46:04,072 --> 01:46:06,032
you see why she must divorce.

1315
01:46:06,991 --> 01:46:10,370
Marriage will solve everything.
When will it be?

1316
01:46:10,412 --> 01:46:12,455
As far as I'm concerned, she's my wife.

1317
01:46:12,539 --> 01:46:14,541
As you saw, she isn't.

1318
01:46:16,793 --> 01:46:18,461
We're going to Moscow,
then to my place in the country.

1319
01:46:19,045 --> 01:46:20,547
That sounds like a good idea.

1320
01:46:20,714 --> 01:46:22,298
But, for a day or two, Anna will be at home.

1321
01:46:24,718 --> 01:46:25,760
Then...

1322

I'll say goodbye now.

Well, you had an excellent night.

1324
01:46:53,621 --> 01:46:56,207
Does your mother want you
to marry the widow or the child?

1325
01:46:57,083 --> 01:46:59,252
-Either one.
-Don't joke about it.

1326
01:46:59,336 --> 01:47:03,131
If you loved me, you would have locked me
in to stop me going!

1327
01:47:19,064 --> 01:47:20,857
Yes, it was my fault.

1328
01:47:34,329 --> 01:47:35,830
I won't sleep.

1329
01:47:39,793 --> 01:47:41,920
I know how to make you sleep.

Anna, I am very glad to see you.

1332
01:48:40,353 --> 01:48:42,689
Are you well? How is your little one?

1333
01:48:44,524 --> 01:48:47,610
Stiva wanted to invite you
and Count Vronsky to the house,

1334
01:48:47,694 --> 01:48:49,279
but it's impossible.

1335
01:48:49,362 --> 01:48:50,864
No, I understand.

1336
01:48:50,947 --> 01:48:52,866
No. No, you don't.

1337
01:48:53,742 --> 01:48:55,869
Kitty and her husband are with us.

1338
01:48:55,952 --> 01:48:57,871
She's in Moscow to have the baby.

1339
01:48:57,912 --> 01:49:01,207
Kitty! Tell her how pleased I am.

1340
01:49:01,916 --> 01:49:04,210
Perhaps I'll wait a year or two.

1341
01:49:06,171 --> 01:49:07,213
Love.

1342
01:49:09,090 --> 01:49:10,425
Yes, love.

1343
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:17,891
Don't you disapprove of me
for what I've done?

1344
01:49:18,433 --> 01:49:21,561
No. I wish I'd done the same.

1345
01:49:22,062 --> 01:49:23,813
But no one asked me.

1346
01:49:25,148 --> 01:49:28,651
Well, I wouldn't have been brave enough.

1347
01:49:30,153 --> 01:49:31,988
Stiva, you know,

1348
01:49:32,614 --> 01:49:34,282

(BABY CRYING IN DISTANCE)

I had an inspiration.

1352
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,850
Why do we have to wait here?

1353
01:50:41,933 --> 01:50:43,727
Why can't we wait in the country?

1354
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:46,062
I don't want to hear
any more about a divorce or think about it.

1355
01:50:46,146 --> 01:50:47,772
Good, I'm bored here. When should we go?

1356
01:50:48,231 --> 01:50:50,150
If I bore you here, I'll bore you in the country.

1357
01:50:50,316 --> 01:50:52,861
I didn't say you bore me, Moscow bores
me. When should we go? Tomorrow?

1358
01:50:53,236 --> 01:50:54,571
I can't be ready by tomorrow.

1359
01:50:54,654 --> 01:50:55,822
-The day after, then.
-If you like.

1360
01:50:55,905 --> 01:50:58,825
No, wait, that's Sunday. I have to see  <i>Maman.</i>

1361
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:00,493
That's 20 minutes away on the train.

1362
01:51:00,994 --> 01:51:02,829
You could go to see her tomorrow.

1363
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:06,833
Or was it that you wanted
to spend Sunday with Princess Sorokina?

1364
01:51:07,083 --> 01:51:09,336
Please. Don't spoil everything.

1365
01:51:09,836 --> 01:51:11,171
I can't see  <i>Maman </i> tomorrow

1366
01:51:11,212 --> 01:51:12,756
because she won't have
read the papers she has to sign.

1367
01:51:13,381 --> 01:51:15,050
In that case, let's not bother.

1368
01:51:15,133 --> 01:51:17,010
-I'll leave on Sunday or not at all.
-That's absurd.

1369
01:51:17,093 --> 01:51:19,846
It's absurd to you because you have
no understanding of my life here.

1370
01:51:20,388 --> 01:51:22,766
-Anna.
-No, you've stopped loving me.

1371
01:51:23,516 --> 01:51:26,144
You've given up everything for me
and it's turned you against me.

1372
01:51:26,269 --> 01:51:28,021
-Why lie about it?
-Stop!

1373
01:51:28,104 --> 01:51:30,690
I put off our departure for a day or two
and you tell me I don't love you.

1374
01:51:31,066 --> 01:51:32,942
Because I've been living off your love
and there's none left.

1375
01:51:33,026 --> 01:51:34,110
So this is over. Finished.

1376
01:51:48,208 --> 01:51:49,542
I'm sorry.

1377
01:51:59,594 --> 01:52:00,929
I don't mind when we go.

1378
01:52:01,012 --> 01:52:03,223
I'll telegraph  <i>Maman. </i> We'll go on Sunday.

1379
01:52:03,556 --> 01:52:05,183
I'll do anything you want.

1380
01:52:05,308 --> 01:52:08,395
-You should leave me.
-I don't want to. I love you.

1381
01:52:09,104 --> 01:52:10,188
Why?

1382
01:52:11,398 --> 01:52:14,401
You can't ask "why" about love.

1383
01:52:40,468 --> 01:52:42,595
So, will you be all packed?

1384
01:52:43,263 --> 01:52:45,390
I'll be out today making the arrangements.

1385
01:52:45,432 --> 01:52:47,267
Is that your way of telling me
you'll be at your mother's

1386
01:52:47,308 --> 01:52:48,643
with that simpering little princess?

1387
01:52:48,727 --> 01:52:51,604
No. I'll be at my lawyer's,
waiting for some documents.

1388
01:52:51,646 --> 01:52:53,565
Then I'm having dinner
to say goodbye to old comrades.

1389
01:52:53,606 --> 01:52:54,649
I know what that means.

to dine in society, I won't eat with the band.

Who was the telegram from?

1394

I didn't show you because Stiva keeps
telegraphing what we already know.

01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:14,961
I told you I don't care about the divorce,
so why hide the telegram?
