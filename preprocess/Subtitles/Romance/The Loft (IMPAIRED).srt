but you have to admit...

6
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:04,457
your version of events
does sound pretty bizarre,
don't you think?

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,894
Look. It was a setup, okay?
The whole thing was staged.

Where were you this morning,

I was at home, alone.
My wife's taken the kids

Actually your wife's
on her way back,
as we speak.

Apparently, she has, uh,
quite a few questions
of her own.

Uh, 9:00, 9:30.

He said I had to come.

[ Man ]
Where were you supposed to go?

35
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:31,797
To the loft. He told me
to come to the loft.

36
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,532
Did he say
why he was panicking?

00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:35,801
- No.
- Did you know why
  he was panicking?

Oh, fuck.

- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.

44
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,924
What do you mean?
You just-- What, you--

45
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:34,627
I walked in,
she was lying there.

46
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,995
Oh, fuck.

47
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,201
- Have you called the others?
- Chris and Marty are on
  their way.

haven't reached Philip.

Okay, well, uh, keep calling.
We need everybody here.

50

[ Luke ]
Do you know who she is?

51
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,911

who's lying there?

52
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,846
What?

53
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,849
No, of course not.

54
00:06:56,882 --> 00:07:00,085
How the fuck did they get in?
Was it a window, a door or--

55
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:03,789
Windows are sealed,
the door was locked, and
the alarm was turned off.

56
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:05,858
That's impossible.

57
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:05,858
I'm telling you,
the door was locked.

58
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:07,993
And the alarm was turned off.

59
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:12,632

No.

64

The new residential one
by the Sports Arena?

65
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,611
Designed, I believe,
by your good friend
Vincent Stevens.

66
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:28,848
Vincent runs a very large firm.
He's done a lot of buildings.

67
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,517
There's a loft on the ninth
floor, Mr. Seacord.
Have you ever been there?

68
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,952
No.

69
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,888
Strange, because according
to our information,

70
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:39,925
you and four friends are
sharing this loft secretly,
without your wives' knowledge.

71
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,827
That is ridiculous.

72
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,029
Don't the five of you
bring women up there?

73
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:47,666
Girlfriends, mistresses,
one-night stands,
catch of the day.

74

Five pals just looking
for privacy and fun...

without the hassle of
Visa statements and hotel
bills the missus might find.

76
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,875
That is preposterous.

77
00:07:55,908 --> 00:08:00,613
Maybe, Mr. Seacord,
but one of your friends
already made a full confession.

78
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,884
You want to know who?

79
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,884
Listen, I don't do things
like that. You know?

[ Woman ]
You love your wife.

00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:10,222
I love my wife, yes.

83
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:12,858
What happened to your face,
Mr. Seacord?

84
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:15,728
- I walked into a door.
- Or were you in a fight?

85
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,230
- I said I walked into a door.
- Where were you this morning?

86
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:20,566
Out with Chris,
having breakfast.

87
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,835
There will be a lot of people
in the restaurant
to verify that.

88
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:25,304
By Chris, you mean
Dr. Chris Vanowen,
the psychiatrist?

89
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:27,273
- That's right.
- One of your loft buddies?

90
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,775
Chris is married.
He's got two kids.

91
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:32,011
And he's not a guy
who cheats on his wife either.

00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:05,077
You think your brother
has something to do
with this?

98
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,279
No. We gotta call the cops.

99
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:10,015
You realize what'll happen
if we call the cops?

100

- There's a dead woman here,

Why do we think Philip
is involved?

102
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,123
- Chris, you know
  what he's capable of.
- Yeah, I know.

Do you know where he is?
Was he here last night?

No. Wait,
what are you doing?

what happened here, and we
will figure a way out.

Well, it's bold and focused,
as always.

- Great. You made it.

Hi.

135
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:01,326
- Hi, Barbara. How are you?
- Want to buy yourselves
  a little condo?

136
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,929
I think Vincent's little condos
are a little out of our league.

137
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:06,265
Right. You and your puny
psychiatrist's salary.

138
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,767
You guys grab a drink
and we'll catch up
with you later.

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,770
All right.
Congrats, bud.

One hour tops,
and then we're
out of here.

Come on, hon.
We just got here.

Man, check out
all these babes. So hot!

144

Having too much fun?

Nope. Just checkin' out

Mm-hmm. Yeah, if you
embarrass me, I'll leave
you here all by yourself.

00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,132
Oh, don't raise my hopes
only to dash them.

[ Laughing ]
Hi, Luke.
Where's Ellie?

152
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:46,438
She was just feeling dizzy.
Ducked out to check
her blood sugar.

153

Hi, Elle.
Do you feel okay?

154
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:52,745
Oh, I started to feel
not so great before,

- What do you mean?
- A place where
  no one hassles you.

Latin. Do you know Latin?

I took it premed, yeah.

 Fatum nos iungebit.

 Yeah, I know.
 Fatum nos iungebit.

259
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:17,202
I can read that.
What's it mean?

260
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:19,805
I'm guessing you already
know what it means.

261

No. We would like
to hear you say it.

think is that somebody

reached over
with this young lady's hand...

266
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:37,256

on the wall.

267
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,660
 "Fatum nos iungebit"
 is wrong.

How so, Doctor?

269
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,665
The future imperfect tense
of the verb unite, iungere...

270
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,333
is not iungebit,
it's iunget.

271
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:50,402
 It should say
 "Fatum nos iunget."

you're looking for made

00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:42,894
Someone got in using a key,
and yours is missing!

459
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,696
Is that right, Vincent?

460
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,165
Then how do you account
for the fact that the alarm
was shut off?

461
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:51,036
So let's just cut the bullshit,
'cause it definitely had to be
one of us five.

462
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:55,740
Unless--

463
00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:57,175
Unless what?

464
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,911
Unless she let him in.

465
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:02,880
Oh, yeah?
Then how'd she get in, Vincent?

466
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:05,983
Any way you look at it,
it keeps coming back down
to us.

467
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,187
And I, for one,
would like to know
who's hiding something.

468
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,025
[ Mimi ]
Where did you learn that?
I seriously don't believe it.

469
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:16,160
There's a word for that?

470
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:16,160
Yes. Polyamory.

471
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:18,796
It's a philosophy,
some sort of belief system...

472
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:21,466
about being romantically
involved with more than
one person at the same time.

473
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,935
Uh-huh. And your boss
gets away with that?

474
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,904
Yes. He says that
he's in love with his wife
and his girlfriend,

475
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:28,740
so why should
he have to choose?

476
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:31,409
- And his wife is
  amazingly cool with it.
- Oh, really?

477
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:33,778
Is she special needs?
Maybe oxygen-deprived? What?

478
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:36,013
- Explain. I'd like to know.
- This sounds like my kinda
  philosophy.

479
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:38,349
Barbara,
what's it called again?
Polly and Marie?

480
00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:40,852
Please. Spare us, Tubs.
You can barely handle
one woman.

481
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,822
What would you do
with two?

482
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,822
Mmm. Bury one.

483
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,358
I would make up something,
some sort of game...

484
00:28:47,391 --> 00:28:49,293
that involves two ladies
and one guy.

485
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:51,229
Start a trapeze act
or somethin'.

Could you at least
fake some enthusiasm?

488
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,339
It's your party.
Anyway, I'm cooking.

489
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:05,176
If you absolutely have to
invite your friends over,

490
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:07,212
could you at least try
to make it home on time?

491
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,350
Look, they're never here, okay?
Will you just join us?

[ Marty Cackling ]

493
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,923
I just hope the pudgy clown
doesn't puke on the rug.

494
00:29:18,956 --> 00:29:21,125
He's been chugging vodka
like it's Evian.

495
00:29:21,158 --> 00:29:23,528
I mean,
doesn't his wife see that?

496
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,998
Actually, she was just
cool with it long enough
to catch him in the act.

497
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:30,234
She hired a detective.
Cell phone records,
credit card receipts.

498
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:32,370
Audio, video, the works.

499
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:36,340
And in a heartbeat,
my poor boss went from
polyamory to alimony.

500
00:29:36,373 --> 00:29:39,177
[ Mimi Laughing ]
Oh.

501
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,512
[ Marty ]
Man, your boss sounds
mentally retarded.

502
00:29:41,545 --> 00:29:43,848
So, what--
what happened to him?

503
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:48,085
Oh. Uh, he and his concubine
are now cramped in
a tiny one-bedroom condo.

504
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:50,021
But I'm guessing he's happy.

505
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,090
She's blonde, 23,
with a brand-new pair
of fake breasts.

506
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:55,459
Oh! How can men
stand fake breasts?

507
00:29:55,492 --> 00:29:59,831
Ah! Why are women always
talking about "fake tits"
this, "fake tits" that?

508
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,532
I mean, listen.

509
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:04,202
Girls,
if it's a decent boob job,
who fuckin' cares. You know?

510
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:07,538
My mom-- My mom,
she's got, uh, false teeth.

511
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:10,241
Okay? When she smiles,
do people give her shit
and say,

512
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:11,509
"Oh, my God! Look! Fake!"

513
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:14,312
No, they don't.
They say, "Wow!

514
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:17,481
You look way better now.
It's an improvement."

515
00:30:17,514 --> 00:30:21,118
You know, you women,
you're so catty,
so competitive.

516
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:22,887
Calm down, Tubby dearest.

517
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,256
You know what?
No, it's nothin' to be
calm about, Mimi.

518
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:28,226
I mean, a glorious,
big set of fuckin' tits...

519
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,494
and a nice piece of ass,
it's-it's thrilling!

00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:33,297
It's thrilling!

521
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:38,903
This is all a little
too highbrow for my teeny,
tiny, catty female mind.

522
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:41,239
Oh, well, you know what?
You should have that enlarged.

523
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:44,008
Huh? And while you're under,
you should have the corners
of your mouth lifted...

524
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:46,010
so you can smile
every once in a while.

No, you're a class act, Marty.

Mimi, would you like to get
your husband another drink
or should I do the honors?

You should do it.
And I want it chilled.

- And then you go
  with her and stir.
- Honey?

532
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,065
The problem with your boss,
Barbara,

533
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:10,001
is he didn't
have his shit together.

00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,169
I mean, apart.
Apart, I mean.

He did-- No, I mean
he didn't compartmentalize.

You guys agree?

00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:21,178
All right, Marty.
How would you compartmentalize?

00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:23,381
How? Okay.
Well, since you ask.

539
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:26,350
First thing first is
I wouldn't have a place
that you could get caught.

540
00:31:26,383 --> 00:31:29,654
Not a hotel,
not your girlfriend's crib.

That's key, right?
Am I right, Vinnie boy?

But it-- Okay, first of all--
Sorry, baby.

a little-- you know,

tends to talk out of his ass
when he's been drinking. Yeah?

all up in your nose
and shit.

Why would you even feel it?

607
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,188
I've never cheated
on my wife before.

fall in love easily.

you to love me.

Why are you doing this?

626

The people you love,

627
00:36:08,732 --> 00:36:10,935
they're the only ones
who can hurt you.

628
00:36:13,303 --> 00:36:15,539
I would never
hurt you, Anne.

what you're talking about.
Would you--

Stop it, okay?
You don't know me.
That's the end of it. No.

632

- Would you give me
  a chance, at least--
- I'm a whore.

What?

635
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:28,886
I'm a prostitute.

Do you get it now?

638
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:38,762
Don't worry, Doctor.
I won't bill you
for the past few months.

639

Please, Anne, would you wait?
Would you wait a minute?

640

Chris, please stop it.
You don't know the half
of it. Just go home.

Go home to your wife
and your kids.

642

Is your friend Chris Vanowen
cheating on his wife,
Mr. Landry?

643
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:58,449
Oh, I doubt that. Chris
is a very devoted husband
and, um--

644
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,352
And a model dad, just like
all the rest of your pals,
right?

Except for you.
You're not exactly
squeaky clean, are you, Marty?

646
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,523
Um, I don't know
what you mean.

647
00:37:06,556 --> 00:37:09,627
- Why does your wife
  want a divorce?
- Divorce? That's not right.

648
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,296
What we're going through
is a separation.
It's a trial separation.

649
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:14,031
Why?

650
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:16,934
Because she found out
something that she, uh,
wasn't too happy about.

651
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:20,471
- You fucked around on her.
- If you wanna be technical.

652
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,473
How'd she find out?

653
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:26,711
- The woman with whom I--
- Fucked around?

654
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:30,281
Yeah.

655
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:34,285
Apparently expected something
a little more, and she showed
up on our front porch.

656
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,353
The bitch started to--

657
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:38,055
The woman in question
started saying things.

658
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:42,826
And my only hope is that Mimi
will come around eventually,
because I love her very much.

659
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:44,561
Did you go with this woman
up to the loft?

660
00:37:44,594 --> 00:37:46,597
What? No.
This happened in San Diego.

661
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,066
Oh, that's where you
met the woman, right?
In San Diego.

662
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:50,901
- Yeah.
- Why were you there?

663
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:53,470
A commercial real estate
convention. Vince had
a couple extra tickets.

664
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:55,739
A VIP thing, you know.

665
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:58,375
It's a couple nights
in a fancy hotel and a chance
to get away for a couple days.

666
00:37:58,408 --> 00:37:59,944
And nights.

667
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:03,747
Yeah. Nights too.

668
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,351
Man, do you see that?
Jesus, Vince. Those girls
are drooling all over you.

669
00:38:07,384 --> 00:38:10,721
Invite 'em over.
You got first dibs.
I'm happy with second best too.

What? What, are you
fucking crazy? Why wouldn't
you invite them over?

I'd rather dive for some rare

don't you think?

Hi, Dana. I'm Vincent.
This is, uh, Marty, Luke.

buy you a drink?

I wasn't trolling for
free booze.

685

- No, I mean, I didn't think--
- Since you asked,
  what are you drinking?

686
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:58,001
Oh, champagne?
A girl can dream.

- Champagne?
- Please.

has a good-looking friend.

on her way down right now.

Okay. Yeah,
well, what if she
is the good-looking friend...

and the really fat chick's
on her way down?

But that ain't Mrs. Steel.

Maybe. Not mine.

a part of the plan.
And the Latin on the bed?

No, Vincent,
you're not gonna die.

01:20:23,651 --> 01:20:26,020
Sarah lured you here
and drugged you.

Then she killed herself,
with you by her side.
"Fate will unite us."

'Cause we're friends,
aren't we?

1383
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:53,448
[ Vincent ]
So, you see, it was a setup.

1384
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:57,185
Sarah and I were set up.
The whole thing was staged.

1385
01:20:57,218 --> 01:20:59,287
Still sounds
a little unbelievable.
Don't you think?

1386
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,089
Unbelievable?
But it's the truth.

1387
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,089
Yeah.

1388
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:03,024
My line of work,
you gotta prove the truth,

1389
01:21:03,057 --> 01:21:04,993
and you prove it
with facts and findings.

1390
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:07,896
Fact is,
we only found your prints
and those of Sarah Deakins.

1391
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:11,065
Yeah, because they
wiped the place clean.

1392
01:21:11,098 --> 01:21:15,036
And we have the DVDs of all
your sexual exploits with
your prints all over them.

1393
01:21:15,069 --> 01:21:17,572
Luke made those DVDs.
I never even saw 'em,
let alone touched 'em.

1394
01:21:17,605 --> 01:21:19,941
Yeah, but we got
no DVDs of your friends.

1395
01:21:19,974 --> 01:21:23,478
No DVDs of Marty's wife.
No DVDs of Philip's sister.

1396
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:26,080
No DVDs of Chris's girlfriend.
All right?

1397
01:21:26,113 --> 01:21:28,049
Facts and findings,
Mr. Stevens.

1398
01:21:28,082 --> 01:21:30,919
And we got no evidence
that you were being set up.

1399
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,023
All right.
Is there anything
we've forgotten?

1400
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,992
Yeah. To follow the fuckin'
plan. Why didn't you just
handcuff her?

1401
01:21:38,025 --> 01:21:40,962
- She was already dead.
- That's still no reason
  to mutilate her.

1402
01:21:40,995 --> 01:21:43,464
She killed herself!
I just made it more dramatic.

1403
01:21:43,497 --> 01:21:46,101
Well, you better hope
your dramatics
don't put us in jail.

Maybe Luke too.

how to do my work.
We've questioned them all.

01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:05,119
I got no reason to believe
they've been lying.

01:22:05,152 --> 01:22:06,955
Plus, all your friends
have alibis.

Not for this morning,
they don't.

[ Male Detective ] We got
Luke Seacord and Chris Vanowen
together at breakfast.

At his office?

1413

Look, for at least
an hour this morning,
we were all in the loft.

1414
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:22,236
So was Phil.
What about Phil?

1415
01:22:22,269 --> 01:22:24,739
He's downstairs right now
with his father-in-law.

1416
01:22:24,772 --> 01:22:27,241
Fry? What the fuck's
Fry doing here?

1417
01:22:27,274 --> 01:22:30,611
He just gave a statement
saying that he was with
his son-in-law all day.

1418
01:22:30,644 --> 01:22:33,047
That is bullshit!
That is a false statement!

1419
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,683
And why would he lie?
Hiram Fry brings
a lot of credibility.

with some bimbo! Okay?

Phil knew that. He knew
I pressured Fry into giving me
a waterfront contract.

There's just...

one thing that's bothering me.

Why does Vincent Stevens
keep accusing his best friends?

Hmm.

Could it be-- I just--
I just wonder--

1439
01:23:46,687 --> 01:23:48,656
Do you think he's trying to
hide something else?

1440
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:54,295
Wh-What would he be hiding?

1441
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:54,295
Sarah Deakins's murder.

Murder?

1443
01:24:00,768 --> 01:24:03,805
But the detective
in the interrogation
called it a suicide.

1444
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:05,573
Well, that's what
it looked like.

1445
01:24:05,606 --> 01:24:08,810
But the autopsy report
revealed that sleeping pills
didn't kill her.

1446
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:11,712
And her wrist was cut,
but not by Sarah.

but it's not there anymore.

it's unfortunate that you lost

I had nothing to do with that.

to ask who put our loft
