I don't know why you do
anything you do, Burt.

No, Burt.

different depending on various co-factors?

I don't want to hear that.

wouldn't use the word "co-factors."

No, I said I wouldn't misuse it.

Yeah, it is.

50
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,432
Burt, cobbling is shoes.

51
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:31,871
That's why the people that make shoes
are called cobblers.

you're carving.

00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,853
Lily, my old boss in Chicago.

316
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:29,910
Right.

317
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,551
What do you
think of that?

318
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,694
Yeah, they could be
our friends in Phoenix.

319
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,526
They weren't really
our friends in Chicago.

320
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:43,261
I know, but they could be
when we live in Phoenix.

321
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,606
They could be our new good friends
when we live in Phoenix.

322
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,375
Well, we wouldn't need a
space heater in Phoenix.

323
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,444
Burt, are we fuck-ups?

324
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,508
No.

325
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,687
What do you mean?

326
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,726
I mean, we're 34.

327
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:08,817
33.

328
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,795
We don't even have this basic
stuff figured out.

329
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,059
Basic, like how?

330
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,998
Basic, like how to live.

331
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,835
We're not fuck-ups.

332
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,772
We have a cardboard window.

333
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,006
We're not fuck-ups.

334
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,444
(WHISPERING) I think
we might be fuck-ups.

335
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,043
(WHISPERING)
We're not fuck-ups.

336
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,532
Are we nuts?

337
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,832
Well, look around.

338
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,568
We both agree we need to be
near some kind of family.

339
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:02,547
Some friends, something.
Some connection, someone we know, so...

340
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,139
We'll look at Phoenix,
see my sister.

341
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,445
Your closest friends.

342
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,712
Lily and Lowell.

343
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,720
And then to Madison
for your job interview.

344
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,016
My what?

345
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,785
God. Your interview.

346
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,920
Your interview
with Mutual Choice.

347
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:20,431
To see if they'll give you a better commission?
You set it up.

348
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,093
Okay. So then from Madison, we go home.

349
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,568
No. Did you look at the itinerary?

350
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,003
I stapled it to the inside
of your jacket.

351
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,339
See? From Madison,
we go to Montreal.

352
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,935
Montreal is where I think we should
live if we don't live in Phoenix.

353
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,810
Okay, Montreal.

354
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:42,116
See? This is exciting,
if you think about it.

355
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,883
We're completely
untethered, Burt.

356
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,118
This is a dream scenario.

357
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,063
What are you doing?

358
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,758
LILY: Honey,
let me tuck you in.

359
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,768
(SCREAMING)

360
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,795
God, look at you!
You're only 6 months in!

361
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:39,867
Jesus, you're huge!
And your face, it's so fat!

362
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,345
Come here, give us a hug!

363
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,745
Lowell, come and give a hug to the
most beautiful woman in the world.

364
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,878
Look at that.
Nice to see you, Lowell.

365
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,388
Come on,
don't be such a pill.

366
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,219
He's upset 'cause
we didn't get into the club.

367
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,657
Hey, how are you?

368
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,217
Good, I was almost out.
I'll get an opener.

369
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,856
Verona and I were
desk buddies in Chicago.

370
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:05,029
I hired her at the agency.
That was before she
broke out on her own.

371
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:09,233
I still have no idea where you learned how
to paint the insides of dead people.

372
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,870
So fucking disgusting, girlfriend!
Come on, let's get a drink.

373
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,039
She's so talented,
our little artiste.

374
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,116
(SINGING) For the land

375
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,944
Of the free

376
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,045
(IMITATING OPERATIC SINGING)

377
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:30,128
And the home of the brave

378
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,525
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

379
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,697
Play ball.

380
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,071
Wow. So, you're
in Arizona now.

381
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,505
Cheers.
Cheers.

382
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,338
To the Arizonans.
You got it.

383
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,743
God. I can't believe it.
I can't believe how big the kids are now.

384
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,304
Right?
And Taylor's so handsome.

385
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,317
Well, thanks. We're gonna
do something about those ears.

386
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,684
Do you see them?
He looks like a trophy.
You know what I mean?

387
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,882
One of those trophies
with the arms on it.

388
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,549
Oh, my God.

389
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,097
And this one has
that dyke look.

390
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,099
She walks like a teamster,
doesn't she?

391
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,227
I mean, it's weird.
She's only 12, and I know she's a dyke.

392
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,000
Ashley! Ashley!

393
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,774
Show Verona your tough-girl walk.
Come on. Go butch on us.

394
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,270
Come on! Come on!

395
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,510
Oh! Now she's shy.
Did you see her ass?

396
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,519
She's got like...
What is it? What is it?

397
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,952
What?
Junk in the trunk.

398
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,287
(IN DEEP VOICE)
She's got junk in her trunk!

399
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,849
(LAUGHING) Oh, my God!

400
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,726
It looks like a duffel bag
full of bricks.

401
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,527
I don't know if dykes
go for that or not.

402
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,125
Do they?
Burt, you worked with
a lesbian, didn't you?

403
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,601
Oh!

404
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,899
Yes. Yes, I did.

405
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,837
I can't hear you!

406
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:53,370
I just don't think we should be talking
about it right in front of the children.

407
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:57,142
Please. Burt, it's just white noise
to them. Listen, watch this.

408
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,479
Taylor? Taylor?

409
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:04,648
Taylor? Taylor?
Taylor? Taylor?

410
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,185
I can keep going on and on.
They don't hear us. Seriously.

411
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,421
So tell me about the dyke.

412
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,861
ANNOUNCER: The greyhounds have reached the
starting box for this afternoon's first race.

413
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,459
They are ready to go
over the 550-yard course.

414
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,333
What's your line again, Burt?

415
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,167
Insurance.

416
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,706
Like life insurance?

417
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:23,798
Sometimes.

418
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:29,245
But it's mostly
insurance futures.
It's pretty cool, actually.

419
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,310
Similar to how an individual or
a family might get insurance,

420
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,183
insurance companies
need insurance themselves.

421
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,687
It's sort of this hedge against...

422
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,747
Goddamn.

423
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,224
Of course it would come to this.

424
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,954
Yeah. What?

425
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:47,092
They made us afraid
of everything.

426
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:50,657
Insurance for insurance,
for insurance.

427
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:51,793
(LAUGHS)

428
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,498
This country is just such a...

429
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,440
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
it is now race time.

430
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,807
Well, anyway,
if this country is shit,

431
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,846
everyone else is just
the flies on our shit.

432
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:02,971
Am I right?

433
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,811
ANNOUNCER: And away
they go and to the inside.

434
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,215
157 powers out to the front,
followed by the...

435
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,617
Go! Go!

436
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,985
...now on the inside turn...

437
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,284
MAN: Pick it up, pal!
Pick it up!

438
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,790
LILY: Hey, Lowell!

439
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,061
I used to have nice tits, right?

440
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,157
Verona doesn't seem to remember,
I don't think.

441
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,793
I had nice jugs, right?

442
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,737
They sucked me dry.
I don't even need a bra.

443
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,367
Now I just tuck them into my socks.
You ready for that, Burt?

444
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,469
They'll look like
an old man's nut sack.

445
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:41,243
They even grow hair on them.
A hairy old man's nut sack.

446
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,449
(LAUGHING)

447
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,114
ANNOUNCER:
In Some Time and Queen Anne...

448
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,657
In Some Time!
Queen Anne is second.

449
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,522
MAN: Look at them go!

450
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,462
Pathetic.

451
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,057
So, Burt, you excited about all this?

452
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,157
Yeah.

453
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,134
This might be the best
one I've ever seen.

454
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:02,833
No, the baby, dummy.
Does this mean you guys
will finally get married?

455
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,603
They're not married?
I told you that.

456
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,702
Burt wants to, Verona doesn't
see the point.

457
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:12,739
Insurance, for one. If anyone,
you should understand that, Bart.

458
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,753
Anyone ever call you Bart?
It'd be kind of funny.

459
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,789
We didn't have insurance
when Ashley was born.

460
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:21,314
Well, we thought we did, and then
we didn't. And then I couldn't get it.

461
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:25,386
Pre-existing condition.
I'm crazy!

462
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,760
Look, whatever.

463
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,301
I don't know. I...

464
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,360
I guess I just never gave that much
thought to "marriage" marriage.

465
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,430
Well, at the very least, it'll keep you from
taking off in the middle of the night

466
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,532
when there's trouble.

467
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:42,342
I almost left Lowell about a dozen times.
Kids don't know that.

468
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:46,783
And then you start thinking about
the wedding and all that money...

469
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,116
$46,000 for ours.

Like the biblical flood, but in reverse.

00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,399
You got lucky, sister.

629
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,329
Yeah, I know.

630
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,304

(ALL GASP)

632
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,235
Yeah. No, I did.

633
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,741
What is it?
I'd put a wager on it.

634
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,877
So what are you looking for?
A Jacuzzi-type thing? Or a "tub" tub?

635
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,381
Jacuzzi.

636
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,117
So how do you feel?
Do you feel different?

637
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,648
No. No, I feel the same.

638
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,192
Maybe I should feel different.

639
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,286
Maybe it's just late coming to me.

640
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,853
Like everything else.

641

(CHUCKLES) Join the club.

642
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:38,599
Can you believe Mom was just 25
when she had you?

643
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:39,761
Hmm.

644
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,778
Get in.

645
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,007
I don't need to get in.
It's a nice tub.

646
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,812
Come on. I'll wash your hair.

647
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,450
If I can get in.

648
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,454
It's nice. I like it.

649
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,393
(SIGHS)

650
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,535
So when was the last time
you went back home?

651
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,039
You know it's been a long time.

652
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,834
When are you gonna
sell that place, anyway?

653
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:25,076
You mean, when are we gonna sell it?
I don't know. Not yet.

654
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,878
We've had good luck
with renters.

655
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,387
Selling it just seems
like the last thing.

656
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,521
Can you imagine how excited Mom and Dad
would be if they could see you now?

657
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,222
Stop. You're doing it again.

658
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,286
What?

659
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,127
You're just getting all...

660
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,702
Trying to get me
to talk about them.

661
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,897
It's only because
you never do.

662
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:51,100
I do. You know I do.
I just did.

663
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:55,874
I just want to talk more.
You're the big sister.
You remember more.

664
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,481
Fine. What do you
want to know?

665
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,920
You know that baby's gonna have
something of them in her.

666
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:07,981
I mean, what if she's got Mom's
crazy green eyes or something?

667
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,886
What if it's one of those features
that skipped you and me

668
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,988
and jumps onto the face
of that little baby?

669
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,492
You're bringing them back, you know.
In a little way.

670
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,936
I know.

671
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:31,872
Are you trying to make me cry
in a bathtub?

672
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,076
In a bathtub showroom?

673
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,554
You're gonna be a great mom.

674
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,980
Like our mom.

675
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,061
Hi.
Hello.

676
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:58,836
You know you can't fly after
8 months. Airline policy.

677
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,343
Oh! I'm only 6 months.

678
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:04,006
Dana, come here for a second.

679
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,917
Do you have a note
from the doctor?

680
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,385
What? Really?

681
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,547
It's okay. You're supposed to
have a note from the doctor

682
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,250
if you want to fly
after 8 months.

683
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,783
But I'm only 6 months, so...

684
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,253
Uh-huh.

685
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,560
Carrie?
You got a minute?

686
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,069
She says she's only 6 months.

687
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,433
(SIGHS) Can you turn to the side?

688
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,543
BURT: I think this is better, actually.

689
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:40,146
This is the railroad.
The romance of the rails.

690
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,113
'Rona, it's like Casey Jones
or Thomas the Train.

691
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:47,021
Hey, you know what?
We might see some buffalo.

692
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,663
I'm so tired of being big.

693
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,663
I'm tired of not having sex.

694
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,399
BURT: Do you want to have sex?

695
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,633
No.

696
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,568
We haven't done it in a month.

697
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,613
And you don't want to now?

698
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,669
VERONA: No.

699
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,851
I just... I feel so ugly.

700
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,762
No, no, no. Don't be sad.

701
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:33,068
You're not that big.
You're still super-sexy.

702
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,627
Hot, even.

703
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:40,104
Oh! No. Honey... Hey.

704
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,243
I'll always love you.

705
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,786
Even if you're enormous.

706
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,982
Even if it takes you months
to lose this weight. A year.

707
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,891
Even if you gain weight
after having the baby.

708
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:06,126
Even if you gain so much weight
that I can't find your vagina.

709
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,736
(SCREAMING)

710
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:13,239
You go ahead and write
that in stone in your heart.

711
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:18,004
I will love you.

712
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:24,213
(WHISPERING) Even if
I can't find your vagina.

713
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,854
Her heart rate's pretty slow.

714
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,917
What is it?

715
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,258
It's like 115.

716
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,524
That seems normal
enough, right?

717
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,499
Well, it's supposed to be
between 120 and 160.

718
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,128
She's just mellow.
Mellow's good.

719
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:43,537
I don't want mellow now.
I want lively now, mellow later.

720
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,767
I think it's fine.

721
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,469
That's 'cause you
don't want to fight.

722
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,377
We should fight more,
just get riled up.

723
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,641
Didn't we fight last night?

724
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,272
No, we discussed.

725
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,443
We need to fight.
You never raise your voice.

726
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,381
Okay.

727
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,188
You've done something wrong,
and I'm really bothered by it.

728
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,251
Man, am I cross.
Real mad.

729
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:08,321
(LAUGHS) No, it has to be convincing.

730
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,388
Like, should I swear?

731
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,230
No, just raise your voice.

732
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,202
(SHOUTS) You cuntsucker!

733
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,562
I didn't mean now.

734
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,370
But the element of surprise
is so crucial.

735
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,604
You've never heard me say
"cuntsucker" before, have you?

736
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,476
No.
See?

737
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:28,545
And I will get that heart rate up.
I know what I'm doing.

738
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,353
VERONA: Wow, look at this.
This is really nice.

739
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,792
BURT: Yeah, it is.

740
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:43,493
So, is Ellen a full
professor or an associate?

741
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,331
And wait, which side is she on?
She's a first cousin, right?

742
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:49,372
She's not technically
my cousin, actually.

743
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,206
Her mom was an old friend of my dad's.
I've no idea how.

744
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,638
Anyway, they started calling us
cousins when we were kids.

745
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:59,945
BURT: She always used to make me
take pictures of her.

746
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,041
Excuse me.
Yes?

747
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,484
Do you know where Ellen
Fisher-Herrin's office is?

748
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:06,853
Ellen Fisher-Herrin.
Yes, I do know.

749
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,721
As a matter of fact,
she's in William Stone Hall.

750
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,817
Room 340, about halfway down.

751
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,829
Thanks.
Yeah.

752
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,627
She'll be the mom
without the stroller.

753
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,334
She doesn't have a stroller?

754
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,633
I thought you said she got
some sort of big trust fund.

755
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,674
She did. Oh! Here it is.

756
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,504
I thought her name was Ellen.
What does "L-N" stand for?

757
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,013
(GASPS) No!

758
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,343
Don't say anything. Please.

(WHISPERING) All right.

I'll give it right back.

So great to have you.
It's good to see you. Hi.

Of course.

Yeah.

And, well, it's a boy.

No.

Really? With those hips and that shape?
Who told you it was a girl?

00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:53,952
Right.

788
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:55,757
LN: Should we go?

789
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,130
Yes.

790
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,793
BURT: Sorry we're late.
I tried to call.

791
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,771
Oh! Right. Yeah, I don't answer
the phone when I'm nursing.

792
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,171
It's not fair to the children.

793
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,835
I gotta get this one to crafting.

794
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,609
We got directions from this really
nice lady who seemed to know you.

795
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,674
She was... Had brown hair,
wearing a blazer and glasses.

796
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:15,741
She had a baby.

797
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,252
LN: Ruby. Oh!

798
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,518
Poor Ruby. She hates me.

799
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,058
I breastfed her baby.

800
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,593
Pardon?
Can you do that?

801
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:27,062
Well, I was baby-sitting and
the child was fussing. Starving.

802
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:31,500
Wouldn't take the bottle. So I fed him,
and he took to me right away.

803
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:35,595
But, you know, I think my mistake was...
I shouldn't have told her.

804
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,404
She's got lactation problems,
and she couldn't appreciate it.

805
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:42,741
And now she won't let me baby-sit,
she won't let me near her husband,

806
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:47,750
and I think there's something
strangely paranoid about that, right?

807
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:53,484
So, dinner. Should we go out,
or do you want to eat in?

808
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,184
Let's eat in.
We've had train food all day.

809
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,750
(GROANS) Train food.

810
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,529
Okay, let me think.
What do I have?

811
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:02,758
Let us get the food.
We have a car.

812
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,063
We can get the groceries.
I mean, it's the least that we can do.

813
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:08,696
Look at you, so helpful.

814
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:12,139
Oh, Burtie.
I'm really proud of you, babe.

815
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,275
And I have to say I'm so glad
you guys got pregnant so easily.

816
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:20,441
I was concerned when I heard
about your tilted uterus.

817
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,656
VERONA: You told her
I have a tilted uterus?

818
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,626
I don't know.
Maybe it was my mom.

819
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,218
Is your tilted uterus a secret?

820
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,924
Yeah, my tilted uterus
is a fucking secret.

821
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,730
Oh, really,
you fucking bitch!

822
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:41,532
(SHOUTING) Your fucking uterus
is a motherfucking secret?

823
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:42,731
Well, fuck you!

824
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,841
VERONA: You know, it was really nice of you
to think of getting them a stroller.

825
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,749
BURT: Yeah. I had no idea how
expensive it would be.

826
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:56,808
VERONA: I told you.

827
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,514
No, like, really expensive.

828
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,578
I know.

829
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,920
Well, let me just hide this.
There we go.

830
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,425
You ready?
Yeah.

831
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,555
(DOORBELL BUZZES)

832
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:08,354
You think we got them a good one?

833
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:10,329
Hi.
Hi.

834
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,331
(GREETING IN HINDI)

(VERONA GREETING IN HINDI)

836
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:15,836
You, too.

837
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:20,207
Oh, fabulous. Great.

838
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,643
If you don't mind, there are
slippers just there.

839
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,341
Just any of these?

840
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,813
LN: Uh-huh.

841
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:43,932
I like those.

842
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,228
(WHISPERING)
Go get the stroller.

843
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,293
(WHISPERING) Okay.

844
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,504
We brought you something.

845
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,776
Oh, my God. How...

846
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:07,349
Oh, my God.

847
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,361
(EXHALES) Okay,
all right, I'm sorry.

848
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,395
Why don't we just
put it on the porch?

849
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,565
Okay.

850
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,041
They had it in blue. But...

851
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,337
(LAUGHS)

852
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,049
Just a little further away.

853
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:47,285
LN: Okay.

854
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,854
All right, come on.

855
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,490
Okay.

856
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,626
Let's go upstairs
and meet Roderick.

857
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,059
Okay.

858
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:58,974
Hello.

859
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:00,541
(SHUSHING)

860
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,280
Honey.

861
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:18,886
Hi.

862
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:19,986
Hey.

863
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:21,686
I don't think we've met.

864
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,426
Oh, yes, we have.

865
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,096
Burning Man, '97.

866
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,006
This is a big bed.

867
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,903
We are a Continuum home.

868
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,944
VERONA: What is that?
Continuum?

869
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,143
Continuum?

870
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,242
VERONA: Yes.

871
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,954
Continuum.

872
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,011
Yes.

873
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,451
(SOFTLY) The Continuum
movement recognizes that

874
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:55,829
the world will give your baby plenty of
alienation and despair in good time,

875
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:58,197
so while we can, we should
hold them close.

876
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:03,535
So, it's the 3 "S's," no separation,
no sugar, no strollers.

877
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,004
They gave us a stroller.

878
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,066
Oh!

879
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,578
(SNICKERING)

880
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,680
What is wrong with strollers?

881
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:16,810
Burts, I love my babies.

882
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:19,879
Why would I want to push them
away from me?

883
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,284
And you wonder why this country
is so dysfunctional.

884
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:26,829
Because of strollers?

885
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,762
Mama,

886
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:32,199
in this house
we carry our babies.

887
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,662
We hold them close.

888
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:35,898
What about sleeping?

889
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:40,937
This is where they sleep.
We practice family bed.

890
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:45,346
So what if the two
of you want to,

891
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,110
you know? Be alone?

892
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,453
Do you go out to the car?

893
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,152
No, Verona.

894
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,380
We don't go out to the car.

895
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,054
Are you planning on hiding
your lovemaking from your kids?

896
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,490
Are you guys making love?

897
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:07,062
It can be so great in the 6th month.

898
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,161
Hmm.

899
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:11,036
And it is so important to expose
your kids to sexuality,

900
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,076
especially in utero.

901
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,169
Do you know what
it does to a child

902
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,680
to have their parents' expression
of love kept a secret?

903
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:20,205
No.

904
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,410
Oh! Well,

905
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,613
that's why I have an Electra complex.

906
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,246
Oh, babe.

907
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,190
It is okay.

908
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,090
(WHISPERING)
Which one's that, again?

909
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,096
I think that is when a woman
wants to do her father.

910
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:37,096
Do you mean "Oedipal complex"?

911
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,936
Don't... Don't try
and diagnose me, Verona.

912
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,871
Why the seahorses, Rod?

913
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,842
In the seahorse community,

914
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:51,709
the males give birth.

915
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:57,777
The female inserts her ovipositor
into the male's brood pouch.

916
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:00,482
That's where she
deposits her eggs.

917
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,252
If I could,

918
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:07,085
I would lay my eggs
in your brood pouch.

919
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,688
I know you would.

920
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,730
Don't...

921
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:18,563
Don't, don't, don't.

922
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,352
So, have you chosen a doula?

923
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,048
I already had one.
A little weird, but good.

924
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,353
A doula, Burtie, not a dolma.

925
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,824
(ALL LAUGH)

926
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,827
We are not using a doula.

927
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:41,295
Really?
Who is your midwife?

928
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:45,661
Oh, no, no. Midwives and doulas are
for when the husband is clueless

929
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:46,724
or doesn't want to be involved.

930
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:49,271
And I'm neither of those things.

931
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,307
I'm really looking
forward to being involved.

932
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:54,400
That's great, Burtie. I totally understand,
and I think that's great,

933
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:57,606
but don't you think Verona
might want someone there

934
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,616
who really understands
the female experience?

935
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:04,245
Oh! There's this great
Simone de Beauvoir quote.

936
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:05,913
I can't remember the book,
but I'll find it for you.

937
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:10,983
It's something like, "One is not born,
but becomes, a woman."

938
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:14,188
What does that have to do with...

939
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,561
But it is worth it.

940
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:19,032
The pain is so enlightening.
And now, having experienced childbirth,

941
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:23,300
I watch CNN and I really
feel like I understand war.

942
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:28,869
On top of which, when I had Wolfie,
I had the most enormous orgasm.

943
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,247
It was so beautiful.

944
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,977
This soup is delicious.

945
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:43,651
Alice Walker said, "There's nothing more
important than how we enter this world."

946
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,718
And I agree with her.

walk into a dry cleaner's without vomiting.

Okay, can that maybe be the last bit
of parental advice we get tonight?

interview tomorrow?

No, not really.

955
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:14,546
Because I'm already doing fine.

956
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:17,115
This would just be
a better commission rate.

that you do, Rod?

How do I "make my living"?

Yes. That's exactly
what I mean.

Don't worry, Wolf. You won't ever
have to do anything like that.

963

Oh, you poor thing.

977
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,670
I was just wondering how much your
mama was able to pass on to you

Now what's...

1115
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,275
Hi!

1116
01:00:58,354 --> 01:00:59,651
Hi, Munch.

1117
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:05,086
Oh, Verona. Look at you!
You look so good!

1118
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,219
Thanks.

01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:07,523
I can't believe you are 6 months in.
I know.

1120
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:08,825
You look amazing.
Where's Burt?

1121
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:10,058
You do, too.

1122
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:12,835
I think he's been
taken hostage over here.

1124
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:15,559
Are you okay?

1125
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:19,205
Yeah, I have all this gear at home.
I do this to relax.

1126
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:27,412
This is the family I want.
Every part of it. All those kids.

1127
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:30,884
All those ages. Everyone draped over
each other, just taking care of each other.

1128
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,784
So, you want to adopt?
Yeah.

1129
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,847
All right. So we will just trade this one in
and we will get whatever we want.

1130
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:39,486
No, I want her and them, too.
This is a family.

1131
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,223
Yeah, it works.
It's real.

1132
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:44,425
We should move here.

find time to go out?

We're out a lot, I guess.

1138

You have to find the balance

but not all the time.

I think we're moving here.

was good. Marriage is great.

Stop.

1200
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,287
Okay, so you kiss, you do other things
and then you make a baby.

1201
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,753
The baby comes in there
and he nestles in.

1202

And you guys hug and get real tight.
And then we do this.

And this. There...

1204

And this...
Are those the bedposts?

1205

It's your house.
Now what is this?

1206
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:41,273
Is that a home? Is that a family?
BURT: Yeah.

No. No, of course not.
That's just the raw material.

1208
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,910
The people, the walls, the furniture.
Okay, so that's the basics.

1209
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,577
But that's not a home.
That's not a family.

1210
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,984
What binds it all together is this.

1211
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,386
Awesome. That's awesome.

1212
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:57,515

consideration, your better selves.

Man, you just have no idea
how good you can be.

1217
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,431
But you have to use all of it.
All of it.

1218

It's not like simple masonry,

1219
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:14,374
where you use a little layer of mortar
between each row of bricks.

1220
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,434
No. With this,
you have to use tons of it.

1221
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:19,242
For every brick, there's
a half-ton of mortar.

1222
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:20,776
I thought we were doing syrup.

1223
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:26,278
Mortar, syrup. Syrup, mortar.
It is all the same. It's the glue.

1224
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,587
It's all those good
things you have in you.

1225
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,487
The love,

1226
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,061
the wisdom, the generosity.
The selflessness.

1227

awake because Ibrahim is sick

01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,664
and he can't find the bathroom and
he just puked in Katya's bed.

1230
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,901
Patience when you blink...
It was awful.

"What happened to swimming naked
off the coast of Greece?"

the family out of whatever you have.

Is this just dudes?

No, no, no. It's not that those
guys weren't enjoyable.

have been selfish.

People like us,
we wait until our 30s,

1265
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:02,567

babies aren't so easy to make anymore.

It's terrible feeling this helpless, man.

You just watch these babies grow,
and then...

Then fade.

supposed to name them

COURTNEY: I told her
it was a business trip.

1305
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:21,108
I made the mistake of
telling her she'd be 5 days.

1306
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:22,734
I actually thought that
was a conservative estimate.

1307

I thought I would have
it figured out by then.

1308

she wants to know where her mom is.

really gone for good,

I gotta know
what to tell Belle.

1317
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:47,427
And it is wrong to say that her mom
was murdered, right?

1318
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:51,804
Yes. I think that
would be traumatic.

01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:04,178
I mean, what if I'm walking by a
construction site and something falls,

1415
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:08,018
and then my frontal lobe gets chopped
off and my personality's altered

1416
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,251
and then I'm not a good dad?

1417
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:12,651
What happens then?

1418
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:16,027
Well, be careful walking near
construction sites.

1419
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:19,556
What about Munch?

1420
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:22,799
She'll be careful walking
near construction sites, too.

1421
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:24,303
No, really.

1422
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,371
I mean, don't you just look at her
and want to give her

1423
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,842
everything that
she's ever wanted?

1424
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,444
It is so incredibly
unfair that she can't...

1425
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:35,608
Yeah, you're right.

1426
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:39,287
It's unfair that
she can't have a baby

1427
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:43,518
and that bad parents
still get to be parents

1428
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:48,495
and good parents die when their
daughters are in college. So what?

1429
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,225
I'm sorry, 'Rona.

1430
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:54,166
Look, all we can do is be good
for this one baby.

1431
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:58,698
We don't have control
over much else.

1432
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:02,634
Will you marry me?
At least.

1433
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:07,641
Never.

1434
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:18,484
I will never leave you.
Yeah.

1435
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:22,024
I promise.

1436
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,291
No, I know.

1437
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,434
You...

1438
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:33,198
You promised never to marry me
because you don't want to get married

1439
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:35,971
without your parents there.
I get that.

1440
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:40,074
You promise
never to leave me.

1441
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:46,615
Do you promise to never leave
this baby that we are having?

1442
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:50,185
I promise.

1443
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:53,788
I do.

1444
01:18:58,133 --> 01:18:59,293
Do you promise

1445
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:07,772
to stop talking about your ability to find
or not find my vagina after I give birth?

1446
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:12,437
I do.

1447
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:18,612
Do you promise
to let me cobble...

1448
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:19,711
Carve.

1449
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:23,246
...to carve in my spare time,

1450
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:26,586
and teach our daughter the lore
of the great Mississippi?

1451
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:29,423
I do.

1452
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,868
Do you promise never to
develop a thing for seahorses?

1453
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:39,267
I do.

1454
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:41,268
Good.

1455
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:44,108
(EXHALES)

1456
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:54,815
Do you promise to let our
daughter be fat or skinny

1457
01:19:55,824 --> 01:20:00,056
or any weight at all? Because we want
her to be happy, no matter what.

1458
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:04,496
Being obsessed with weight is just
too clich for our daughter.

1459
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,827
Yes, I do.

1460
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:12,497
Do you promise, when she talks,

1461
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:17,209
you'll listen?
Like, really listen,

1462
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:20,710
especially when she's scared?

1463
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:25,646
And that her fights
will be your fights?

1464
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:28,316
I do.

1465
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:41,699
And do you promise that if I die some
embarrassing and boring death

1466
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:46,469
that you're gonna tell our daughter
that her father was killed

1467
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:51,410
by Russian soldiers in this intense
hand-to-hand combat

1468
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:57,076
in an attempt to save the lives
of 850 Chechnyan orphans?

1469
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,514
I do.

1470
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,014
Chechnyan orphans. I do.

1471
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:06,753
I do.

1472
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:34,146
We had an orange tree.

1473
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:36,748
Who?

1474
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:37,944
When we were kids.

1475
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:42,014
My dad was really
proud of it.

1476
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:47,860
He planted it one spring, and he used to
go out there first thing every morning,

1477
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:50,489
see if any oranges had grown.
But nothing ever grew.

1478
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,897
The thing was sickly or something,
or the soil wasn't right.

1479
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:02,302
One morning, my mom woke Grace
and me up really early,

1480
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:03,776
like, at 5:00,

1481
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:10,780
and she led us out to the tree with these
2 grocery bags filled with oranges,

1482
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:15,545
and pineapples and grapes
and melons, for some reason.

1483
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:21,488
And we just hung all the fruit from
the tree using tape and string.

1484
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:24,824
It worked, actually.

1485
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:29,732
And then we all ran into the truck
and we slouched down

1486
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:32,272
and we just waited
for my dad to come out.

1487
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,398
What did he say?

1488
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:35,943
Well, he stared
at it for a full minute,

1489
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,776
just staring at it.

1490
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:44,818
I think at first
he thought they were real,

1491
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:47,047
like the tree had burst
into fruit overnight,

1492
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:53,425
and then, I guess he saw the
pineapples or something,

1493
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:59,926
and he just started laughing harder
than we'd ever heard him laugh.

1494
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:06,068
And Grace and I just ran
out of the truck, squealing.

1495
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:09,937
And my mom just...

1496
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:20,846
And from then on,

1497
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:25,289
every once in a while one of us
would hang fruit from there.

1498
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:30,797
Usually something plastic, like pears

1499
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:34,832
or strawberries or bananas.

1500
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:13,666
BURT: Is this starting
to look familiar?

1501
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:17,537
VERONA: I think so.
God, I want it to.

1502
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,910
But I want it to be new.
You know?

1503
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:21,812
New for us.

1504
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:25,608
New enough to feel like we found it.

1505
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,920
Does that make sense?

1506
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:30,850
Yeah.

1507
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:18,432
You ready?

1508
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:22,502
I am.

1509
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:24,939
Are you?

1510
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:27,546
Yes, I am.

1511
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:48,932
(SIGHING) God, I forgot
how beautiful it is.

1512
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,800
Subtitles: Arigon

1513
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:23,152
This place is perfect for us.

1514
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:28,058
Don't you think?

1515
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:36,800
I hope so.

1516
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:44,137
I really fucking hope so.
