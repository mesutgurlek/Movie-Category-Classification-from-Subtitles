FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Once upon a time,

3
00:00:50,438 --> 00:00:53,747
there was a girl
called Ella.

4
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:56,977
And she saw the world
not always as it was,

5
00:00:57,002 --> 00:01:02,260
but as perhaps it could be,
with just a little bit of magic.

6
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,403
Ah, my darling!

7
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:09,604
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
To her mother and father,
she was a princess.

8
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:13,179
True, she had no title,
nor crown, nor castle,

9
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:16,441
but she was the ruler
of her own little kingdom,

10
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:20,300
whose borders were the house
and meadow on the forest's edge

11
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:23,306
where her people
had lived for generations.

12
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,887
With Mr. Goose.

13
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,041
and all their animal family.

14
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:32,435
Hello, there.

15
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,042
What do you think
you're doing?

16
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:36,068
Let the little ones
have their share.

17
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:38,811
We don't want you getting
an upset stomach.

18
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:39,767
<font color="#b39f84">Gus-Gus: (Found my snack.)</font>

19
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:40,710
Oh, Gus-Gus,

20
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:43,098
you're a house mouse,
not a garden mouse.

21
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,752
Isn't he, Jacqueline?

22
00:01:44,777 --> 00:01:47,441
And you mustn't eat
Mr. Goose's food.
- <font color="#b39f84">(Hungry.)</font>

23
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:48,656
Isn't that right, Mummy?

24
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:50,946
Do you still believe
that they understand you?

25
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:52,324
Don't they, Mother?

26
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,138
Oh, yes.

27
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,465
I believe that animals listen
and speak to us

28
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:58,190
if we only have
the ear for it.

29
00:01:58,215 --> 00:01:59,985
<font color="#b39f84">- Gus-Gus: (Well, you're right.)
- Matida: (And she could.)</font>

30
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,610
That's how we learn
to look after them.

31
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:03,097
Who looks after us?

32
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:05,451
Fairy godmothers, of course.

33
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:07,062
And do you believe in them?

34
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:08,414
I believe in everything.

35
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,096
Then I believe
in everything, too.

36
00:02:13,186 --> 00:02:15,038
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Her father was a merchant

37
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:16,236
who went abroad

38
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:20,073
and brought tribute back from
all of Ella's subject lands.

39
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,119
Ella!

40
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:25,724
Where are my girls,
my beautiful girls?

41
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:29,415
Where are my darlings?

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,027
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  Ella missed
him terribly when he was away.

43
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,069
But she knew
he would always return.

44
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:36,212
- ELLA'S FATHER: There she is!
- Papa, welcome home!

45
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:38,378
ELLA'S FATHER:
How are you?

46
00:02:38,564 --> 00:02:40,190
You've grown!

47
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:41,435
Look at you.

48
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,976
Haven't you, now?

49
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,647
- MAN: There you go, sir.
- What was that?

50
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:46,554
Oh, this?

51
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,718
I found it hanging
on a tree.

52
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:50,370
I think

53
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:53,215
there may be something inside.

54
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:00,366
Oh, it's so pretty.

55
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,121
In French,
that is un papillon. (a butterfly)

56
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:06,505
- Un papillon. (A butterfly)
- Un papillon! (A butterfly)

57
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,679
Voulez vous danse avec moi, Mademoiselle?
(Will you dance with me, Miss)

58
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:11,389
- S'il vous plaît.     (My pleasure)
- Merci beaucoup.  (Thank you very much)

59
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:13,758
Ouch.
Ouch.

60
00:03:13,783 --> 00:03:15,329
You're standing
on my feet.

61
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:16,871
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Ha-ha-ha.

62
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,285
Shall we?

63
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:22,738
Look, Mummy!
I'm dancing!

64
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:26,603
Whee!

65
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:27,824
Look out, 
Mr Goose.

66
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:31,076
My darling wife.
Come here.

67
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:36,930
Little  papillon.

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,925
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
All was just as it should be.

69
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,631
They knew themselves to be the most
happy of families to live as they did

70
00:03:44,656 --> 00:03:46,599
and to love each other so.

71
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:49,362

77
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:12,628
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  But sorrow
can come to any kingdom,

78
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,336
no matter how happy.

79
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:24,353
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
And so it came to Ella's home.

80
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:28,415
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry.

81
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,389
ELLA'S FATHER:
Thank you, Doctor.

82
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:33,343
This must have been
very difficult for you.

83
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:37,352
Come.

84
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,650
Ella.

85
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:55,896
ELLA'S MOTHER:
Ella, my darling.

86
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,501
I want to tell you a secret.

87
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,051
A great secret

88
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:03,807
that will see you through all
the trials that life can offer.

89
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:06,994
You must always
remember this.

90
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:12,087
Have courage and be kind.

91
00:05:12,356 --> 00:05:14,788
You have more kindness
in your little finger

92
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:17,813
than most people possess
in their whole body.

93
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:20,922
And it has power,

94
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:23,270
more than you know.

95
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:26,046
- And magic.
- ELLA: Magic?

96
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:28,130
Truly.

97
00:05:28,623 --> 00:05:32,733
Have courage and be kind,
my darling.

98
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:34,996
Will you promise me?

99
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:36,782
I promise.

100
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,403
ELLA'S MOTHER: Good.

101
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:39,645
Good.

102
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,201
And...

103
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:47,023
I...
I must go very soon, my love.

104
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:50,253
Please forgive me.

105
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,284
Of course
I forgive you.

106
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:01,915
ELLA'S MOTHER:
I love you.

107
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:05,616
ELLA'S FATHER:
I love you, my darling.

108
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:07,524
ELLA'S MOTHER:
I love you.

109
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:24,388
FAIRY GODMOTHER: Time passed,

110
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:28,265
and pain
turned to memory.

111
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:42,802
In her heart,
Ella stayed the same.

112
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:46,001
For she remembered
her promise to her mother.

113
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:49,792
Have courage,
and be kind.

114
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,130
Father, however,
was much changed.

115
00:06:56,163 --> 00:06:59,086
But he hoped
for better times.

116
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:02,528
"And thence home,

117
00:07:02,553 --> 00:07:06,064
"and my wife and I singing,
to our great content,

118
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:08,904
"and if ever there were a man
happier in his fortunes,

119
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,398
"I know him not."

120
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,198
Thus ends Mr. Pepys
for today.

121
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:16,698
I do love a happy ending,
don't you?

122
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:19,838
They're quite
my favorite sort.

123
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,374
As well they should be.

124
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,199
Ella...

125
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:26,428
I have come to the conclusion
that...

126
00:07:26,453 --> 00:07:28,940
 it's time,
perhaps...

127
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:31,197
to begin a new chapter.

128
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,866
Indeed, Father?

129
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:34,886
You'll recall that some
time ago, in my travels,

130
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,336
I made the acquaintance
of Sir Francis Tremaine.

131
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:38,602
Yes.

132
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:41,368
The Master of
the Mercer's Guild, is he not?

133
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:42,824
Was.

134
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:45,403
The poor man
has died, alas.

135
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:47,174
His widow,

136
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,234
an honorable woman,

137
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:52,568
finds herself alone,

138
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:55,141
though still in the
prime of her life.

139
00:07:57,134 --> 00:07:59,348
You're worried
about telling me.

140
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:01,914
But you mustn't be.

141
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:04,738
Not if it will lead
to your happiness.

142
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:06,668
Yes.

143
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:08,727
Happiness.

144
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,209
Do you think I

145
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:13,708
may be allowed
one last chance,

146
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:16,830
even though I thought
such things were done with for good?

147
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:20,045
Of course I do, Father.

148
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:25,503
She'll merely be
your stepmother.

149
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:28,893
And you'll have two lovely
sisters to keep you company.

150
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:40,206
Have courage, be kind.

151
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:51,729
ELLA'S FATHER:
Welcome, ladies. Welcome!

152
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:54,713
ANASTASIA: She's skinny as a broomstick!
DRISELLA: And that stringy hair!

153
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:56,568
You're very nice.

154
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:58,473
ELLA: Welcome.
I'm so happy to meet you.

155
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:00,424
You have
such pretty hair.

156
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:01,975
- Thank you.
- You should have it styled.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,703
Oh.
I'm sure you're right.

158
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:05,370
- Would you like a tour of the house?
- What did she say?

159
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:06,930
She wants to show us
around her farmhouse.

160
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:09,927
- She's proud of it, I think.
- Do they keep animals inside?

161
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,299
STEPMOTHER: How charming.
How perfectly charming.

Lucifer.

163
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:21,876
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Her stepmother-to-be

164
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:25,166
was a woman of keen feeling
and refined taste.

165
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:28,251
And she, too,
had known grief.

166
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,773
But she wore it
wonderfully well.

167
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:02,676
You did not say your
daughter was so beautiful.

168
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,723
Oh, she takes after her...

169
00:10:05,658 --> 00:10:07,380
Her mother.

170
00:10:08,543 --> 00:10:10,007
Just so.

171
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,642
What does Mummy mean?
What's so charming about it?

172
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,448
DRISELLA: She's lying.
That's just good manners.

173
00:10:13,473 --> 00:10:14,610
ANASTASIA:
Shut up.

174
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:17,132
DRISELLA:
How long has your family lived here?

175
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:18,154
Over 200 years.

176
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:20,109
And in all that time,
they never thought to decorate?

177
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:23,924
STEPMOTHER:
Anastasia, hush.

178
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:26,684
They'll think
you are in earnest.

179
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,078
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Ella's stepmother,

180
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:31,073
high-spirited lady
that she was,

181
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:34,799
set out to restore life
and laughter to the house.

182
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:39,791
STEPMOTHER:
Oh, you are awful, Baron.

183
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:44,732
BARON:
Ah, fortune favors me again.

184

having a party of their own.

186
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:58,986

Just...

190
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,699
Yes, what do you think
you're up to, Lucifer?

191
00:11:07,724 --> 00:11:11,528
Jacqueline is my guest,
and the eating of guests is not allowed.

192

194
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:15,823
You've plenty of cat
food to keep you happy.

<font color="#b39f84">Jacqueline: (Or put it to sleep.)</font>

196

<font color="#b39f84">Jacqueline: (Oh, and I thank you.)</font>

198

You're missing the party.

199
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:28,485
Oh, I imagine it's much
like all the other ones.

200
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,382
And I'm leaving
first thing, El.

201
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:32,897
No. But you're...

202
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:35,508
You're hardly back
from the last trip.

203
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:38,016
Do you have to go?

204
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:40,380
It's just a few months,
my darling.

205
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:44,750
What would you like me
to bring you home from abroad?

206
00:11:44,783 --> 00:11:46,059
You know, your sisters...

207
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:48,550
uh, stepsisters,
have asked for

208
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,760
parasols and lace.
What...

209
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,758
What will you have?

210
00:11:54,517 --> 00:11:59,159
Bring me the first branch
your shoulder brushes on your journey.

211
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:01,785
That's a curious request.

212
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:03,451
Well, you'll have
to take it with you

213
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:05,110
on your way...

214
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:07,808
and think of me
when you look at it.

215
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:12,046
And when you bring it back,
it means that you'll be with it.

216
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:15,631
And that's
what I really want.

217
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,486
For you to come back.

218
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,646
No matter what.

219
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:24,978
ELLA'S FATHER: I will.

220
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:30,464
Ella, while I'm away,

221
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:32,853
I want you to be good
to your stepmother

222
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,294
and stepsisters,
even though they may be...

223
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:38,326
trying...
 at times.

224
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,800
- I promise.
- Thank you.

225
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,305
I always leave
a part of me behind, Ella.

226
00:12:44,643 --> 00:12:46,696
Remember that.

227
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:52,195
And your mother's here, too,
though you see her not.

228
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,280
She's the very heart
of this place.

229
00:12:55,395 --> 00:12:57,363
And that's why we must
cherish this house,

230
00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:59,938
always, for her.

231
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:04,582
I miss her.

232
00:13:05,188 --> 00:13:07,266
Do you?

233
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,323
Very much.

234
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:25,751
ANASTASIA: Remember the lace!
I simply must have it!

235
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:26,990
DRISELLA:
And my parasol!

236
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,054
For my complexion!

237
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,344
That means skin,
if you don't know!

238

ELLA: Bye!

239

ELLA'S FATHER:
Bye, Ella!

240
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,058
ELLA:
I love you!

241

STEPMOTHER:
Ella, dear.

244
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:19,325
Now, now.
Mustn't blub.

245
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,494
Yes, Stepmother.

246
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,744
Oh, you needn't
call me that.

247
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:26,109
"Madam" will do.

248
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:28,094
DRISELLA: There isn't room for me
and all of your clothes!

249
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:30,341
Well, then make
yourself smaller!

250
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:31,928
Anastasia and Drisella

251
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:33,361
have always shared a room.

252
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:36,199
Such dear,
affectionate girls.

253
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:39,263
ANASTASIA: Or...
Or better yet, disappear entirely!

254
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:40,527
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

255
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:42,964
Sometimes I could scratch
your eyes out!

256
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:46,861
I think they're finding
the sleeping quarters rather confining.

257
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:47,888
Oh, well,

258
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:51,013
my bedroom's the biggest,
besides yours and Father's.

259
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:53,237
Perhaps they'd like
to share it.

260
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,245
What a wonderful idea.

261
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,188
What a good girl you are.

262
00:14:58,663 --> 00:15:01,443
- I can stay in the...
- The attic.

263
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,228
Quite so.

264
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:06,158
The attic?

265
00:15:06,183 --> 00:15:07,235
Yes.

266
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,890
Oh, only temporarily, while I have
all the other rooms redecorated.

267
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:13,516
The attic's
so nice and airy

268
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,697
and you'll be away from
all of our fuss and bother.

269
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:22,958
You'd be even more cozy if you kept
all this bric-a-brac up there with you.

00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:25,218

FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Ella's great comfort

330
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:17,952
were the letters that Father
would send from his travels.

331
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:20,181
The weeks away
lengthened to months,

332
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:23,315
but every day would bring his thoughts
 from some distant part.

MAN: Miss Ella,
it's the mail coach!

334

FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Until late one afternoon...

335
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:30,440
ELLA: Farmer John?

336
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:32,949
FARMER JOHN: Miss Ella.

337
00:19:32,982 --> 00:19:35,096
It's your father, miss.

338
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:38,079
He took ill on the road.

339
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:42,559
He's passed on, miss.

340
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:44,818
He's gone.

341
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:49,534
To the end,
he spoke only of you, miss.

342
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,642
And your mother.

343
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,043
I was to give you this.

344
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:57,622

But what about my lace?

346
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,286
Can't you see?
None of that matters.

347
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:06,388
We're ruined.

348
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,925
How will we live?

349
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,201
Thank you.

350
00:20:19,743 --> 00:20:22,573
It must have been
very difficult for you.

351
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:10,855
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
How indeed to live.

352
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:12,942
Economies had to be taken.

353
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:16,549
Ella's stepmother dismissed
the household.

354
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:34,590
Her stepmother
and stepsisters

355
00:21:34,623 --> 00:21:37,136
ever misused her.

356
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:39,999
And by and by
they considered Ella

357
00:21:40,024 --> 00:21:43,503
less a sister than a servant.

358
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,143
And so Ella was left
to do all the work.

359
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:51,641
This was a good thing,

360
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,960
for it distracted her
from her grief.

361
00:21:53,985 --> 00:21:57,011
At least that was what
her stepmother said.

362
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:01,725
And she and her two daughters
were more than happy

363
00:22:01,758 --> 00:22:06,832
to provide Ella with lots
and lots of distraction.

364
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:17,512
In their defense, they did share
with her the very food they ate,

365
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:21,215
or rather,
the scraps from their table.

366
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,705
She had little
in the way of friends.

367
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,541
Well, her friends
were very little.

368
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:28,785
There you are.

369
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,832
Have dinner with me,
won't you?

370
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:33,568


371
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:36,754
But those friends she had,
she treated with an open heart

372
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:39,133
and an open hand.

373
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,520

FAIRY GODMOTHER: Sometimes,

378
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,230
by the end of the day,

379
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:08,523
the drafty attic was too cold
to spend the night in,

380
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:11,425
so she lay by the dying
embers of the hearth

381
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:13,524
to keep warm.

382
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:32,398
I thought breakfast
was ready.

383
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:33,798
It is, madam.

384
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:36,106
I'm only mending the fire.

385
00:23:36,168 --> 00:23:39,701

on your face?

Madam?

389
00:23:49,065 --> 00:23:51,554
It's ash from
the fireplace.

390
00:23:51,706 --> 00:23:53,615
Do clean yourself up.

391
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,101
You'll get cinders
in our tea.

392

bear to look so dirty.

Who's this for?

399
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:15,742
Is there someone
we've forgotten?

00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:17,015
It's my place.

401

Oh. It seems too much to expect
you to prepare breakfast,

402
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:22,191
serve it and
still sit with us.

00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:25,121
Wouldn't you prefer to eat
when all the work is done, Ella?

404
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:28,004
Or should I say,
"Cinderella"?

405
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:30,284

Names have power,
like magic spells.

408
00:25:18,238 --> 00:25:20,238
And of a sudden,
it seemed to her

409
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:22,205
that her stepmother
and stepsisters

410
00:25:22,238 --> 00:25:24,139
had indeed transformed her

411
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:26,305
into merely a creature
of ash

412
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:28,435
and toil.

as well that Ella's stepsisters were cruel.

421

For had she not run
to the forest,

422
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:23,644

Who?

436
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:52,892
The stag.

437
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:54,106
What's he
ever done to you

438
00:26:54,143 --> 00:26:56,223
that you should
chase him about?

439
00:26:56,654 --> 00:26:59,554
I must confess I've
never met him before.

440
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:01,114
He is a friend of yours?

441
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:02,717
An acquaintance.

442
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:05,082
We met just now.

443
00:27:05,546 --> 00:27:07,775
I looked into his eyes,
and...

444
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,489
and he looked into
mine, and I just felt

445
00:27:09,514 --> 00:27:11,825
he had a great deal left
to do with his life.

446

That's all.

You don't know
who I am?

They call me Kit.

455
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:32,942
Well, my father does

456
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:35,117
when he's in a good mood.

457
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:37,306
And...

458
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,276
where do you live, Mr. Kit?

459
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:40,356
At the palace.

460
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:42,848
My father's
teaching me his trade.

461
00:27:42,881 --> 00:27:44,422
You're an apprentice?

462
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:45,989
Of a sort.

463
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:47,649
That's very fine.
Do they...

464
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:49,409
Do they treat you well?

465
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:52,042
Better than I deserve,
most likely.

466
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:53,669
And you?

467
00:27:54,649 --> 00:27:57,282
They treat me
as well as they're able.

468
00:27:58,048 --> 00:27:59,811
I'm sorry.

469
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:02,184
It's not your doing.

470
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:05,100
Nor yours either, I'll bet.

471
00:28:06,883 --> 00:28:08,583
It's not so very bad.

472
00:28:08,616 --> 00:28:11,191
Others have it worse,
I'm sure.

473
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:12,836
We must...

474
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:17,619
simply have courage
and be kind, mustn't we?

00:28:17,975 --> 00:28:19,610
Yes.

476

00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:30,852
Please don't
let them hurt him.

480
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:33,967
But we're hunting, you see.
It's what's done.

481
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:37,381
Just because it's what's done
 doesn't mean it's what should be done.

482
00:28:37,406 --> 00:28:39,232
Right again.

483
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,484
Then,

484
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:44,518
you'll leave him alone,
won't you?

485
00:28:46,832 --> 00:28:48,596
I will.

486
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,918
Thank you very much, Mr. Kit.

487
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,573
CAPTAIN: Ah.

488
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:55,746
There you are, 
Your High...

489
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:57,335
It's Kit! 
Kit!

490
00:28:57,372 --> 00:28:59,971
Kit! I'm Kit.
I'm on my way.

491
00:29:00,287 --> 00:29:02,520
Well,
we'd better get a move on,

492
00:29:02,553 --> 00:29:04,762
Mr. Kit.

493
00:29:04,787 --> 00:29:06,629
As I said.

494
00:29:06,654 --> 00:29:08,582
On my way.

495
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:24,434
I hope to see
you again, miss.

496
00:29:25,821 --> 00:29:27,765
And I,
you.

497
00:30:05,724 --> 00:30:08,542
You sound as if you're the first fellow
ever to meet a pretty girl.

498
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:10,200
She wasn't a
"pretty girl."

499
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,544
Well, she was a pretty girl,

500
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:13,233
but there was
so much more to her.

501
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:15,362
How much more?
You've only met her once.

502
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:16,739
How could you know
anything about her?

503
00:30:16,764 --> 00:30:18,637
You told me you knew right away
when you met Mother.

504
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:20,691
That's different.
Your mother was a princess.

505
00:30:20,716 --> 00:30:21,796
You would have
loved her anyway.

506
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:22,855
KING: I would
never have seen her,

507
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,813
because it wouldn't
have been appropriate.

508
00:30:24,838 --> 00:30:28,431
And my father would have told me
what I'm telling you

509
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:30,017
- and I would have listened.
- No, you wouldn't.

510
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:30,966
- Yes, I would.
- No, you wouldn't.

511
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:31,784
- I would.
- You wouldn't.

512
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:33,394
You're right.

513
00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:40,390
Well, how is he?

514
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,626
Your Majesty...

515
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:46,940
KING: Never mind.

516
00:30:46,965 --> 00:30:49,130
If it takes that long to
work out a way to say it,

517
00:30:49,155 --> 00:30:51,584
I already know.

518
00:30:53,628 --> 00:30:55,518
Father...

519
00:30:56,728 --> 00:30:59,061
Way of all flesh, boy.

520
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:01,562
Come.

521
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:03,418
We shall be late.

522
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:07,579
And punctuality is the...

523
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:09,996
BOTH:
...politeness of princes.

524
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:11,075
ROYAL CRIER:
His Majesty, the King!

525
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,478
GRAND DUKE: I'm sure your father spoke
 to you of your behavior in the forest.

526
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:15,107
Is it any business of yours, 
Grand Duke?

527
00:31:15,132 --> 00:31:18,004
Your business is my business,
Your Royal Highness.

528
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:20,063
It will not do to
let the stag go free.

529
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:22,676
Just because it's what's done
doesn't mean it's what should be done.

530
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:24,200
Or something like that.

531
00:31:24,225 --> 00:31:26,297
MAN: Master Phineus,
master of the paintbrush,

532
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,232
patiently awaits.

533
00:31:27,257 --> 00:31:29,290
KING: Make him look marriageable,
Master Phineus.

534
00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:31,356
We must attract
a suitable bride,

535
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:33,684
even if he won't listen
to a word I say.

536
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:36,383
MR. PHINEUS: I shall endeavor to
please, Your Majesty.

537
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:38,239
But I can't work miracles.

538
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:40,333
A splendid canvas,
Master Phineus.

539
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:41,531
MR. PHINEUS: Thank you.

540
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:43,264
As if he knows
anything about art.

541
00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:44,431
PRINCE:
So, these portraits

542
00:31:44,464 --> 00:31:45,797
will really be sent abroad?

543
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:49,328
To induce the high and mighty 
to attend this ball you insist upon.

544
00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:51,463
Which is a tradition.
Which is beloved.

545
00:31:51,488 --> 00:31:54,255
At which you will
choose a bride.

546
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,282
Ah, fascinating.

547
00:31:55,307 --> 00:31:59,073
If I must marry, could I not wed,
 say, a good, honest country girl?

548
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:02,897
How many divisions will this
"good, honest country girl" provide us?

549
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,033
How will she make
the kingdom stronger?

550
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:08,733
We are a small kingdom amongst
great states, Your Royal Highness.

551
00:32:08,766 --> 00:32:11,042
And it's a dangerous world.

552
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,002
Listen, boy.

553
00:32:13,027 --> 00:32:15,312
- MAN: Taking you up, Master Phineus.
- MR. PHINEUS: Good.

554
00:32:15,337 --> 00:32:19,639
I want to see you
and the kingdom safe.

555
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:21,827
All right, Father,

556
00:32:22,267 --> 00:32:24,322
on one condition.

557
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:27,022
Let the invitations
go to everyone,

558
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:28,862
not just the nobility.

559
00:32:28,887 --> 00:32:31,049
The wars have brought
sorrow on us all.

560
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,343
What do you think?

561
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:33,818
Would that please the people?

562
00:32:33,843 --> 00:32:36,768
It's beyond my wit,
Your Majesty. But...

563
00:32:36,793 --> 00:32:39,524
I wouldn't mind
a bit of a jolly.

564
00:32:40,368 --> 00:32:43,033
I think we might have
made a bargain.

565
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:45,569
A ball for the people,

566
00:32:45,602 --> 00:32:47,210
and a princess
for the prince.

567
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:49,850
Sounds like a step
in the right direction, if you ask...

568
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,660
We didn't ask you.

569
00:32:51,685 --> 00:32:54,670
MR. PHINEUS: I'm so sorry.
Naughty paint, naughty brush.

570
00:32:54,703 --> 00:32:56,444
Down, please, 
Samson.

571
00:32:56,469 --> 00:32:58,050
Haven't even got a cushion.

572
00:32:58,075 --> 00:32:59,906
Right, down, down.
Not that... Oi!

573
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:01,581
I'm on the ground.

574
00:33:01,636 --> 00:33:05,348
I am literally on the ground.
Sorry.

575
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,357
Actually this is a
very good angle for you.

576
00:33:07,382 --> 00:33:10,309
Great nostrils.
Could I have a longer brush?

577
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,846
WOMAN:
You don't look well, miss.

578
00:33:24,871 --> 00:33:26,770
Not at all.

579
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:30,027
Why do you stay there,
when they treat you so?

580
00:33:30,372 --> 00:33:33,072
Because I made my mother
and father a promise

581
00:33:33,105 --> 00:33:35,439
to cherish the place
we were so happy.

582
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,681
They loved our house...

583
00:33:38,572 --> 00:33:41,372
and now that they're gone,
I love it for them.

584
00:33:41,405 --> 00:33:42,873
It's my home.

585
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:46,489
Hear ye! 
Hear ye!

586
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:48,014
Quiet!

587
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:49,414
"Know,

588
00:33:49,439 --> 00:33:52,407
"on this day,
two weeks hence,

589
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,073
"there shall be held,
at the palace,

590
00:33:55,106 --> 00:33:57,374
"a Royal Ball.

591
00:33:57,407 --> 00:34:00,330
"At said ball,

592
00:34:00,355 --> 00:34:03,409
"in accordance
with ancient custom,

593
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:07,915
"the prince shall choose
a bride.

594
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,146
"Furthermore,

595
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:11,149
"at the behest
of the prince,

596
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:15,408
"it is hereby declared
that every maiden in the kingdom,

597
00:34:15,441 --> 00:34:18,183
"be she noble or commoner...

598
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:22,137
"is invited to attend.

599
00:34:23,275 --> 00:34:29,080
"Such is the command
of our most noble king."

600
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,548
CINDERELLA:
Excuse me, madam.

601
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:33,789
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Ella was enormously excited

602
00:34:33,814 --> 00:34:36,699
to see Kit, 
the apprentice.

603
00:34:36,717 --> 00:34:38,862
And her stepsisters
were mildly intrigued

604
00:34:38,988 --> 00:34:42,052
by the notion
of meeting the prince.

605
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:44,510
DRISELLA: I shall trick him into loving me.
              See if I don't!

606
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:47,477
ANASTASIA: This is the
most hugest news!

607
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,608
Calm yourselves.

608
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:51,018
Now listen to me.

609
00:34:51,043 --> 00:34:53,217
One of you must win
the heart of the prince.

610
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:55,452
Do that, and we can unwind the debt
in which we were ensnared

611
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:57,417
when we came to
this backwater!

612
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:59,248
I, a princess?

613
00:34:59,273 --> 00:35:00,613
ANASTASIA:
Or rather, I,

614
00:35:00,638 --> 00:35:02,473
a princess?

615
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:04,945
Having delivered your news,

616
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,557
why are you still here?

617
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:08,516
You must return
to town right away

618
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:11,987
and tell that seamstress
to run us up 3 fine ball gowns.

619
00:35:12,012 --> 00:35:13,713
3 ?

620
00:35:14,157 --> 00:35:16,420
That's very
thoughtful of you.

621
00:35:16,445 --> 00:35:17,661
What do you mean?

622
00:35:17,712 --> 00:35:19,179
CINDERELLA:
To think of me.

623
00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:20,548
Think of you?

624
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:22,693
DRISELLA: Mummy, she believes
the other dress is for her.

625
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,883
Poor, slow,
little Cinders.

626
00:35:23,908 --> 00:35:25,650
How embarrassing.

627
00:35:25,675 --> 00:35:27,581
You're too ambitious
for your own good.

628
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:30,936
Oh, no.
I only want to see my friend.

629
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:33,355
Let me be very clear.

630
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,613
One gown for Anastasia,

631
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:37,181
one for Drisella,

632
00:35:37,215 --> 00:35:39,078
and one for me!

633
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,755
Et là mode Parisian.
(In the fashion way of Parisian.)

634
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,641
She doesn't know
what that means.

635
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:45,273
Mai bien sûr (I know of course)
Que Ce qui est là mode Parisian.
(what is the fashion way of Parisian.)

636
00:35:45,298 --> 00:35:47,311
Et je avoir à préparer.
(And I shall be ready.)

637
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:50,714
Good.
Right.

638
00:35:50,747 --> 00:35:51,748
That's settled then.

639
00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:52,990
Now go!

640
00:35:53,021 --> 00:35:55,114
Every girl in the kingdom
will be chasing the prince.

641
00:35:55,114 --> 00:35:58,854
You must get there first before
the seamstress is drowning in work!

642
00:35:58,879 --> 00:36:00,138
Tell me what
she said, Drisella.

643
00:36:00,163 --> 00:36:02,602
I speak French,
not Italian!

644
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:21,076
CAPTAIN: Wake up, Your Royal Highness.
You're in a daze.

645
00:36:21,101 --> 00:36:22,305
I'm sorry.

646
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,487
You've been off
since the hunt.

647
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:26,383
It's that wonderful girl.
I can't stop thinking about her.

648
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:27,950
But there are
plenty of girls.

649
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:30,416
But her spirit,
her goodness...

650
00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:31,884
You don't suppose she has a sister,
do you?

651
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:33,092
I don't know.

652
00:36:33,117 --> 00:36:34,824
I don't know
anything about her.

653
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:38,890
Perhaps your mystery girl
may come to the ball.

654
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:41,075
That is why you threw
the doors open, is it not?

655
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,993
Captain.

656
00:36:42,018 --> 00:36:43,151
It was for the benefit
of the people.

657
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:44,285
Of course.

658
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:45,412
How shallow of me.

659
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:47,085
And if she comes,
then what?

660
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,680
Then you will tell
her you're a prince.

661
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:51,393
And a prince may
take whichever bride he wishes.

662
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:51,393
Ha!

663
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:52,096
Ha?

664
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:53,460
Yes, "ha."

665
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:54,852
You know my father
and the Grand Duke

666
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:56,506
will only have me
marry a princess.

667
00:36:56,531 --> 00:37:00,056
Well, if this girl from the forest 
is as charming as you say,

668
00:37:00,081 --> 00:37:02,033
they may change
their minds.

669
00:37:04,886 --> 00:37:06,753
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
The day of the ball arrived

670
00:37:06,786 --> 00:37:08,686
and the entire kingdom

671
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:11,520
held its breath
in anticipation.

672
00:37:11,553 --> 00:37:13,120
ANASTASIA:  You want
me to be your queen?

673
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:15,612
Who? Me?

674
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:17,291
Tighter.

675
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:19,276
Tighter!

676
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,154
Tighter.

677
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,791
That's it!

678
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,275
A vision, sister.

679
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,492
Likewise.

680
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:27,233
ANASTASIA: We must compete
for the prince's hand.

681
00:37:27,258 --> 00:37:29,792
But let it not mean we harbor
dark thoughts against each other.

682
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:32,129
DRISELLA:
Of course not, dear sister.

683
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:34,991
I wouldn't dream of poisoning you 
before we leave for the ball.

684
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:38,245
Oh, nor I of pushing you
from a moving carriage on the way there.

685
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:42,563
Or I of dashing your brains out on the
palace steps as we arrive.

686
00:37:42,588 --> 00:37:44,372
We are sisters, after all.

687
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,997
And blood is so much
thicker than water.

688
00:37:47,022 --> 00:37:48,989
We shall let
the prince decide.

689
00:37:49,022 --> 00:37:51,354
What will he be like,
I wonder?

690
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:54,151
What does it matter
what he's like?

691
00:37:54,176 --> 00:37:56,802
He's rich beyond reason.

692
00:37:56,984 --> 00:38:00,072
Wouldn't you like to know a bit about him
before you marry him?

693
00:38:00,097 --> 00:38:02,503
Certainly not.
It might change my mind.

694
00:38:02,528 --> 00:38:05,285
I bet you have never
ever spoken to a man.

695
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,345
Have you, 
moon-face?

696
00:38:07,423 --> 00:38:09,083
I have, once.

697
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:11,224
To a gentleman.

698
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:12,998
Some menial, 
no doubt.

699
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:14,288
Some a'pprentice.

700
00:38:14,313 --> 00:38:15,734
He was an apprentice, yes.

701
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:18,133
All men are fools,
that's what Mama says.

702
00:38:18,158 --> 00:38:19,459
The sooner you learn that,
the better.

703
00:38:19,484 --> 00:38:21,823
ANASTASIA:
The first dance, milady?

704
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:25,060
Prince Charming,
you're so naughty!

705
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:33,173
- I want to try it.
- No, I'm wearing it.

706
00:38:33,198 --> 00:38:34,746
BOTH: No! No!

707
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:38,894
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Not for the first time,

708
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:42,372
Ella actually felt pity
for these two schemers,

709
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:47,464
who could be every bit as ugly within
as they were fair without.

710
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,445
DRISELLA: My prince!

711
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,365
ANASTASIA: He will love me!

712
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,175
DRISELLA:
But I will be his queen!

713
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,760
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  If her
stepmother would not have

714
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,302
a 4th dress made,

715
00:38:57,327 --> 00:39:00,161
it seemed to Ella that
there was no reason why

716
00:39:00,194 --> 00:39:02,894
she would not try
to run it up herself.

717
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:07,289
And besides,
she did have a little help.

718
00:39:07,314 --> 00:39:10,328
<font color="#b39f84">- Teddy: (That's our shoe)
- Jacqueline: (No it isn't, you dim nut.)</font>

719
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,354
Whoa!

720
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:28,287
My dear girls.

721
00:39:28,321 --> 00:39:31,478
To see you like this...

722
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:35,805
it makes me believe
one of you might just snare the prince.

723
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:39,475
And to think I have
two horses in the race!

724
00:39:39,863 --> 00:39:44,911
I daresay no one in the kingdom
will outshine my daughters.

725
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,681
STEPMOTHER:
Cinderella?

726
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:50,964
It cost you nothing.

727
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:53,164
It was my mother's
old dress, you see.

728
00:39:53,197 --> 00:39:54,598
And I took it up myself.

729
00:39:54,631 --> 00:39:55,798
DRISELLA: Ooh-la.

730
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:57,142
Cinderella
at the ball!

731
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:59,301
No one wants
a servant for a bride.

732
00:39:59,326 --> 00:40:00,708
STEPMOTHER:
After all I've done...

733
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:02,040
I don't want
to ruin anything.

734
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:03,340
I don't even want
to meet the prince.

735
00:40:03,365 --> 00:40:04,511
Oh, and you won't,

736
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,332
because there's no
question of your going.

737
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:09,755
But..., all of the maidens
of the land are invited,

738
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,099
by order of the king.

739
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:14,084
It is the king
I am thinking of.

740
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,170
It would be an insult
to the royal personage

741
00:40:16,195 --> 00:40:19,520
to take you to the palace
dressed in these old rags.

742
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,408
Rags?

743
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:23,318
This was my mother's.

744
00:40:23,343 --> 00:40:27,015
Oh, I'm...
sorry to have to tell you...

745
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,801
but your mother's taste
was questionable.

746
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:33,347
This thing...
is so old-fashioned

747
00:40:33,372 --> 00:40:36,697
it's practically
falling to pieces.

748
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,868
The shoulder's frayed.

749
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:40,777
- It's falling to bits.
- DRISELLA: And this!

750
00:40:40,802 --> 00:40:43,829
It's a ridiculous,
old-fashioned joke!

751
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:47,286
How could you?

752
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,848
STEPMOTHER:
How could I otherwise?

753
00:40:48,873 --> 00:40:52,707
I will not have anyone associate 
my daughters with you.

754
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:54,002
It would ruin
their prospects

755
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,868
to be seen arriving
with a ragged servant girl.

756
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:59,577
Because that
is what you are.

757
00:40:59,602 --> 00:41:01,770
And that is what
you will always be.

758
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:03,710
Now mark my words!

759
00:41:03,735 --> 00:41:06,264
You shall not
go to the ball!

760
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:08,446
MAN: Go on, get going!

761
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,718
Giddyup.
Giddyup.

762
00:41:36,505 --> 00:41:38,523
I'm sorry, Mother.

763
00:41:40,772 --> 00:41:42,600
I'm sorry.

764
00:41:43,205 --> 00:41:45,606
I said I'd have courage,
but I don't.

765
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,715
Not anymore.

766
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:51,131
I don't believe anymore.

767
00:42:08,273 --> 00:42:10,354
Excuse me.

768
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,568
Can you help me, miss?

769
00:42:12,593 --> 00:42:14,423
Just a little crust of bread,

770
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,982
or better,
a cup of milk?

771
00:42:17,007 --> 00:42:18,536
Yes.

772
00:42:18,981 --> 00:42:20,289
Yes, yes, yes.

773
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:22,738
I think I can find
something for you.

774
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:31,526
Why are you crying?

775
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,415
Oh, it's nothing.

776
00:42:36,442 --> 00:42:38,009
Nothing?

777
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:39,367
Nothing.

778
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:42,143
What is a bowl of milk?
Nothing.

779
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:45,726
But kindness
makes it everything.

780
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,714
Now, I don't mean to hurry you,
but...

781
00:42:57,739 --> 00:42:59,861
you really haven't
got long, Ella.

782
00:42:59,886 --> 00:43:02,003
How do you know me?

783
00:43:02,327 --> 00:43:03,361
Who are you?

784
00:43:03,386 --> 00:43:04,852
Who am I?

785
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:07,430
I should think you'd
have worked that one out.

786
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,486
I'm your hairy dogfather.

787
00:43:10,511 --> 00:43:12,479
I mean, 
fairy godmother!

788
00:43:13,744 --> 00:43:15,519
You can't be.

789
00:43:15,544 --> 00:43:16,619
Why not?

790
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:18,851
They don't exist.

791
00:43:19,162 --> 00:43:21,247
They're just made up
for children.

792
00:43:21,272 --> 00:43:23,393
Didn't your own mother
believe in them?

793
00:43:23,418 --> 00:43:25,453
Don't say no,
because I heard her.

794
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:26,606
You heard her?

795
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:28,722
Oh, fiddle-faddle,
fiddle-faddle.

796
00:43:28,747 --> 00:43:31,575
Right!
First things first.

797
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,792
Let me slip into
something more comfortable.

798
00:43:35,915 --> 00:43:37,979
Heh-heh-heh...

799
00:43:48,197 --> 00:43:49,384
Mmm.

800
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:50,766
Haa.

801
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:52,328
That's better.

802
00:43:53,147 --> 00:43:55,059
Now, where was I?

803
00:43:55,084 --> 00:43:56,222
CINDERELLA:
How did you...

804
00:43:56,247 --> 00:43:58,402
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Oh, yes. Let's see.

805
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:02,648
What we need is something
that sort of says, "coach."

806
00:44:02,883 --> 00:44:04,117
Um...

807
00:44:04,157 --> 00:44:05,990
CINDERELLA:
Oh, that trough?

808
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,129
Doesn't really say "coach."

809
00:44:08,215 --> 00:44:10,734
No, no, I'm liking
fruit and veg.

810
00:44:10,759 --> 00:44:12,568
Do you grow watermelons?

811
00:44:12,593 --> 00:44:13,435
No.

812
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,349
Cantaloupe?

813
00:44:14,382 --> 00:44:15,516
I don't even know
what that is.

814
00:44:15,549 --> 00:44:16,683
Artichoke?

815
00:44:16,716 --> 00:44:18,015
Kumquat?

816
00:44:18,048 --> 00:44:19,712
Beef tomato?

817
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:21,916
We do have pumpkins.

818
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:23,596
Ah.

819
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:25,616
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Pumpkins?

820
00:44:25,649 --> 00:44:27,117
This will be a first for me.

821
00:44:27,149 --> 00:44:29,034
Always interesting.

822
00:44:29,245 --> 00:44:30,717
I don't usually
work with squashes.

823
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,361
Too mushy.

824
00:44:34,602 --> 00:44:36,028
Let me see.
Oh, that'll do.

825
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:38,146
Yes.
Knife?

826
00:44:38,324 --> 00:44:41,097
- There you are.
- Thank you, darling.

827
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:44,266
Hello, my strangely
orange vegetable friend.

828
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:45,810
A quick snip for you.

829
00:44:45,835 --> 00:44:46,792
Ah, lovely!

830
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,767
Ooh, heavy pumpkin!

831
00:44:48,792 --> 00:44:50,867
Look out, mices!

832
00:44:52,499 --> 00:44:53,776
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Oh, well. Never mind.

833
00:44:53,801 --> 00:44:54,796
Let's do it here.

834
00:44:54,821 --> 00:44:56,151
Do what here?

835
00:44:56,184 --> 00:44:58,177
Turn the pumpkin
into a carriage.

836
00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:00,719
You're making me
nervous, actually.

837
00:45:00,744 --> 00:45:01,741
Shall I shut my eyes?

838
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:03,323
It might be better.

839
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:07,322
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Let's just go for it.

840
00:45:09,214 --> 00:45:10,561
Ah.

841
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:12,186
Well, something's
definitely happening.

842
00:45:12,219 --> 00:45:14,352
You see, the trick is...

843
00:45:14,385 --> 00:45:16,609
Actually, I've forgotten what the trick is.
Hmm.

844
00:45:18,386 --> 00:45:20,120
CINDERELLA:
I just thought, if it...

845
00:45:20,153 --> 00:45:22,335
If it does get much bigger...

846
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,779
Yes?

847
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:25,724
Hang on.

848
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:30,470
Is that what
you meant to do?

849
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,648
Do you think that's
what I meant to do?

850
00:45:32,687 --> 00:45:35,634
Run! 
Run, darling!

851
00:45:40,347 --> 00:45:42,673
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Take cover!

852
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:03,590
There!
One carriage.

853
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:06,490
You really are
my fairy godmother.

854
00:46:06,523 --> 00:46:07,552
Of course.

855
00:46:07,577 --> 00:46:10,605
I don't go about transforming pumpkins
for just anybody.

856
00:46:10,657 --> 00:46:12,724
Now, where are those mice?

857
00:46:12,757 --> 00:46:14,373
- Mice?
- Yes.

858
00:46:14,398 --> 00:46:15,818
Mice, mice, mice.

859
00:46:15,843 --> 00:46:16,952
There they are.

860
00:46:16,977 --> 00:46:17,930
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

861
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:19,219
<font color="#b39f84"> Gus-Gus: (Whoa!)
 (What?)</font>

862
00:46:29,124 --> 00:46:31,221
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
4 white chargers.

863
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,499
CINDERELLA: Gus-Gus,
how fine you look!

864
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,184
But how did you...

865
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,948
Now, where are we?

866
00:46:36,973 --> 00:46:40,967
Got carriage, horses...
Uh, footmen!

867
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:42,789
Footmen?

868
00:46:42,814 --> 00:46:44,710
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Hello, lovely Mr. Lizard.

869
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,797
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

870
00:46:49,692 --> 00:46:51,359
Hello!

871
00:46:55,817 --> 00:46:57,664
You called?

872
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,757
Now, I need that coachman.

873
00:47:01,782 --> 00:47:02,883
Coachman?

874
00:47:02,908 --> 00:47:05,223
Did I say "coachman"?
I meant "goose."

875
00:47:11,403 --> 00:47:14,047
I can't drive.
I'm a goose.

876
00:47:15,193 --> 00:47:17,111
Now, shoo!

877
00:47:17,136 --> 00:47:19,936
Everyone into place,
no time to be lost!

878
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:22,223
Come on!

879
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,459
Oh.
Fairy Godmother!

880
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:27,188
Yes, what?

881
00:47:27,395 --> 00:47:28,827
My dress.

882
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:30,532
I can't go
in this dress.

883
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:32,205
- Can you mend it?
- Mend it?

884
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:33,697
No, no. I'll turn it
into something new.

885
00:47:33,722 --> 00:47:35,756
Oh, no, please don't.

886
00:47:35,781 --> 00:47:38,700
This was my mother's.

887
00:47:38,725 --> 00:47:41,814
And I'd like to wear it
when I go to the palace.

888
00:47:42,937 --> 00:47:45,438
It's almost like
taking her with me.

889
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:47,260
I understand.

890
00:47:48,596 --> 00:47:51,597
But she wouldn't mind
if I gee it up a bit?

891
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,231
Wouldn't mind
a nice blue?

892
00:47:53,264 --> 00:47:54,965
No.

893
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,966
There.

894
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:37,938
It's beautiful.

895
00:48:37,963 --> 00:48:39,815
She'd love it.

896
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:42,510
Now, come on.
Off you go. Quick!

897
00:48:42,535 --> 00:48:44,646
You'll be late!

898
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,926
MR. GOOSE:
I'm very new at this!

899
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,883
Oh, boy.

900
00:48:49,934 --> 00:48:52,612
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Stop that blooming coach!

901
00:48:52,637 --> 00:48:54,445
MR. GOOSE:
Whoa!

902
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:00,778
Thank you.

903
00:49:00,935 --> 00:49:02,659
Just a moment!

904
00:49:03,703 --> 00:49:05,787
Are those the 
best you have?

905
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:07,389
It's all right.
No one will see them.

906
00:49:07,401 --> 00:49:09,468
No, they'll ruin the whole look.
Quick, quick.

907
00:49:09,501 --> 00:49:11,568
Take them off.
Really quite hideous.

908
00:49:11,601 --> 00:49:13,636
Let's have something
new for a change.

909
00:49:13,669 --> 00:49:16,055
I'm rather good at shoes.

910
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,423
But...

911
00:49:26,637 --> 00:49:28,737
They're made of glass?

912
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,570
Yes.

913
00:49:30,603 --> 00:49:32,840
And you'll find
they're really comfortable.

914
00:49:32,865 --> 00:49:34,995
Ella, you really
must go now.

915
00:49:35,437 --> 00:49:36,404
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

916
00:49:36,437 --> 00:49:37,760
What is it?

917
00:49:37,785 --> 00:49:39,246
My stepmother
and the girls?

918
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:40,366
Don't worry.

919
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:42,948
I'll make sure they
don't recognize you.

920
00:49:43,937 --> 00:49:45,472
Now, off you go.

921
00:49:45,505 --> 00:49:48,025
For you shall
go to the ball.

922
00:49:48,784 --> 00:49:50,190
Ha.
Ha.

923
00:49:50,215 --> 00:49:52,738
MR. LIZARD: Ha, ha. In you get.
                   Ha. Oh, so lovely.

924
00:49:52,763 --> 00:49:54,582
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Do stop wittering on.

925
00:49:56,502 --> 00:49:58,079
Phew.

926
00:49:58,314 --> 00:49:59,579
Hww.
Ella!

927
00:49:59,604 --> 00:50:00,652
I almost forgot.

928
00:50:00,677 --> 00:50:01,605
Remember,

929
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:04,006
the magic will
only last so long.

930
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:06,473
With the last echo
of the last bell,

931
00:50:06,506 --> 00:50:08,137
at the last stroke
of midnight,

932
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,241
the spell will be broken

933
00:50:10,266 --> 00:50:13,203
and all will return
to what it was before.

934
00:50:13,228 --> 00:50:14,426
Midnight?

935
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:15,609
Midnight.

936
00:50:15,634 --> 00:50:17,818
That's more
than enough time.

937
00:50:18,262 --> 00:50:19,996
- Off you go then.
- Thank you.

938
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:21,714
Thank you.

939
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:24,378
Goosey, go!

940
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,309
CINDERELLA: Goodbye!

941
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,697
MAN: Chandeliers, aloft!

942
00:51:34,086 --> 00:51:37,988
ROYAL CRIER:
Princess Mei Mei of Fujian.

943
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:43,107
Princess Shahrzad
of the Seljuqs.

944
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:44,930
Woman: Yeah.
Your Highness.

945
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,989
ROYAL CRIER:
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa!

946
00:51:50,014 --> 00:51:54,170
Princess Imani of Shona!

947
00:51:56,392 --> 00:52:00,943
Princess Hiina
of the Chrysanthemum Throne!

948
00:52:04,614 --> 00:52:07,392
Lady Tremaine
and her daughters.

949
00:52:09,654 --> 00:52:13,014
The Lady Tremaine
and her daughters.

950
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:14,056
I'm Drisella.

951
00:52:14,081 --> 00:52:15,844
And I'm Anastasia.
People will want to know.

952
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:18,126
- I'm the clever one.
- I'm very beautiful.

953
00:52:18,151 --> 00:52:21,267
The very clever
Miss Drisella,

954
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:25,072
and the very
beautiful Anastasia.

955
00:52:25,097 --> 00:52:27,449
Do come on!

956
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:34,615
ROYAL CRIER:
The Lord Veneering.

957
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,197
KING:
Who are you looking for?

958
00:52:38,116 --> 00:52:39,823
No one.

959
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:42,817
It's that girl in
the forest, isn't it?

960
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:45,291
That's why you were
so generous with the invitations.

961
00:52:45,316 --> 00:52:46,796
Father, it was
for the people.

962
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:49,766
I know you love
the people, Kit.

963
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:53,721
But I also know that
your head's been turned.

964
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,285
But you've only met
her once, in the forest.

965
00:52:57,317 --> 00:53:00,142
And you would have me marry
someone I met once, tonight.

966
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:01,618
A princess.

967
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:04,704
It's a princess or nothing.

968
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,247
DOORMAN: Hold the doors!
One more coming in.

969
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:24,574
May I present
Her Royal Highness,

970
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:28,165
the Princess Chelina
of Zaragosa.

971
00:53:32,286 --> 00:53:34,920
You are as handsome
as your picture.

972
00:53:34,953 --> 00:53:38,319
And your little kingdom
is enchanting.

973
00:53:38,469 --> 00:53:43,218
I hope the princess will not
find our "little kingdom" too confining.

974
00:53:47,554 --> 00:53:49,515
Miss Ella.

975
00:53:49,678 --> 00:53:51,367
Thank you.

976
00:54:02,988 --> 00:54:05,402
I'm frightened,
Mr. Lizard.

977
00:54:06,012 --> 00:54:07,041
Huh?

978
00:54:07,066 --> 00:54:10,297
I'm only a girl,
not a princess.

979
00:54:10,322 --> 00:54:13,905
And I'm only a lizard,
not a footman.

980
00:54:14,066 --> 00:54:16,920
Enjoy it while it lasts.

981
00:54:39,335 --> 00:54:42,381
ROYAL CRIER: Your Majesty,
Your Royal Highness,

982
00:54:42,406 --> 00:54:45,553
My Lords, ladies
and gentlemen,

983
00:54:45,578 --> 00:54:49,927
distinguished visitors
and people of our land,

984
00:54:49,952 --> 00:54:54,485
the prince shall now
choose his partner for the first dance.

985
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:58,271
Let our ball commence!

986
00:55:28,261 --> 00:55:29,922
Excuse me.

987
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:32,795
GRAND DUKE: A thousand apologies,
Your Royal Highness.

988
00:55:32,828 --> 00:55:34,932
I don't know
what happened.

989
00:56:36,802 --> 00:56:38,675
Mr. Kit.

990
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,511
It's you,

991
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:44,857
isn't it?

992
00:56:44,938 --> 00:56:46,786
Just so.

993
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:50,340
Your Highness...

994
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,461
If I may...

995
00:56:53,486 --> 00:56:54,996
that is...

996
00:56:57,234 --> 00:57:00,067
it would give me
the greatest pleasure,

997
00:57:00,092 --> 00:57:03,576
if you would do me the honor of
 letting me lead you through this...

998
00:57:03,601 --> 00:57:05,316
the first...

999
00:57:08,413 --> 00:57:10,210
Dance?

1000
00:57:10,235 --> 00:57:12,149
Yes, dance.

1001
00:57:12,552 --> 00:57:14,320
That's it.

1002
00:57:34,769 --> 00:57:36,757
They're all looking at you.

1003
00:57:36,782 --> 00:57:38,698
Believe me,

1004
00:57:38,723 --> 00:57:41,129
they're all looking at you.

1005
00:58:46,976 --> 00:58:48,845
Who is she?

1006
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,842
I have no idea.

1007
00:59:50,647 --> 00:59:51,960
ANASTASIA:
Who's that, Mama?

1008
00:59:51,985 --> 00:59:54,444
I'm not exactly sure,
but this does not bode well.

1009
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:55,764
That's a lovely dress
she's got on.

1010
00:59:55,789 --> 00:59:57,756
- And how pretty she is.
- Concentrate!

1011
00:59:57,781 --> 01:00:00,449
You must turn the prince's head, you fools!
 Now, get out there!

1012
01:00:00,474 --> 01:00:01,958
But no one's
asked us to dance.

1013
01:00:01,983 --> 01:00:03,068
- STEPMOTHER: Gentlemen.
- MAN: Oh!

1014
01:00:03,093 --> 01:00:04,216
May I present my daughters,

1015
01:00:04,241 --> 01:00:06,302
- Anastasia, Drisella.
- MAN:  Mademoiselle.

1016
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:08,409
STEPMOTHER:
Off you go!

1017
01:00:20,504 --> 01:00:22,359
Smile.

1018
01:00:27,614 --> 01:00:29,782
Come with me.

1019
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:33,563
STEPMOTHER: Over there. 
           Smile.

1020
01:00:36,848 --> 01:00:39,223
So, you're the prince!

1021
01:00:39,949 --> 01:00:42,788
Not "the prince," exactly.

1022
01:00:42,813 --> 01:00:44,117
There are plenty of princes
in the world.

1023
01:00:44,142 --> 01:00:46,078
I'm only a prince.

1024
01:00:46,116 --> 01:00:48,076
But your name's
not really Kit.

1025
01:00:48,101 --> 01:00:50,242
Oh. Certainly it is,
and my father still calls me that,

1026
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:52,756
when he's especially
un-peeved at me.

1027
01:00:52,781 --> 01:00:55,139
But you're no apprentice.

1028
01:00:55,164 --> 01:00:56,617
I am.
An apprentice monarch.

1029
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:58,594
Still learning my trade.

1030
01:00:58,917 --> 01:01:00,417
Oh, gosh!

1031
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:02,026
PRINCE:
Look, please forgive me.

1032
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:04,014
I thought you might treat me
differently if you knew.

1033
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:06,417
I mistook you for a good,
honest country girl,

1034
01:01:06,442 --> 01:01:09,609
and now I see you didn't want to
overawe a plain soldier.

1035
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,285
Little chance of that.

1036
01:01:11,318 --> 01:01:13,248
No more surprises?

1037
01:01:14,939 --> 01:01:16,786
No more surprises.

1038
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:19,618
Is that you?

1039
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:22,621
I hate myself in paintings.
Don't you?

1040
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:24,483
No one's ever painted
my portrait.

1041
01:01:24,508 --> 01:01:27,598
No?
Well, they should.

1042
01:01:30,052 --> 01:01:31,085
GRAND DUKE:
Who is she?

1043
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:32,401
ROYAL CRIER:
She gave no name, Your Grace.

1044
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:33,305
You didn't ask?

1045
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:34,519
I was out of breath,
Your Grace,

1046
01:01:34,544 --> 01:01:37,344
on account of introducing
Princess Blodwyn of Llanfairpwllgwyngyll...

1047
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:40,411
- Shut up, will you?
- "Shut up." Absolutely.

1048
01:01:43,753 --> 01:01:45,334
MAN:
I don't believe this!

1049
01:01:47,487 --> 01:01:49,809
No! Not her!

1050
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,772
CINDERELLA: Won't they
miss you at the ball?

1051
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:58,263
Maybe.

1052
01:01:58,288 --> 01:02:00,734
But let's not
go back just yet.

1053
01:02:03,688 --> 01:02:05,430
What's wrong?

1054
01:02:06,755 --> 01:02:10,823
When I go back, they will try to
pair me off with a lady of their choosing.

1055
01:02:10,854 --> 01:02:13,291
I'm expected to marry
for advantage.

1056
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:15,122
Oh.
Well, whose advantage?

1057
01:02:15,155 --> 01:02:17,765
That is a good question.

1058
01:02:18,439 --> 01:02:21,906
Well, surely you have
a right to your own heart.

1059
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:24,332
And I must weigh that
against the king's wishes.

1060
01:02:24,357 --> 01:02:28,337
He's a wise ruler
and a loving father.

1061
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,114
Well, perhaps he'll
change his mind.

1062
01:02:35,923 --> 01:02:38,858
I fear he hasn't
much time to do so.

1063
01:02:39,974 --> 01:02:41,976
Poor Kit.

1064
01:02:43,357 --> 01:02:45,924
CAPTAIN: People are saying
she's a princess.

1065
01:02:45,957 --> 01:02:48,324
Our prince seems
quite taken with her.

1066
01:02:48,357 --> 01:02:50,417
She went
straight for him.

1067
01:02:50,442 --> 01:02:52,536
You have to appreciate
her efficiency.

1068
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:56,698
But surely, if she is a princess,
this may be good.

1069
01:02:57,758 --> 01:03:00,488
I've already promised
him in marriage,

1070
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:02,467
to the Princess Chelina.

1071
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:03,814
But...

1072
01:03:05,013 --> 01:03:06,034
Oh.

1073
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:07,780
Forgive me, Your Grace.

1074
01:03:07,805 --> 01:03:10,615
I did not mean to intrude.

1075
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,129
No, it's you who have
to forgive me, madam.

1076
01:03:14,623 --> 01:03:17,129
Your secret
is safe with me.

1077
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,431
I've never shown
this place to anyone.

1078
01:03:37,066 --> 01:03:39,680
A secret garden.

1079
01:03:41,987 --> 01:03:43,814
I love it!

1080
01:03:50,695 --> 01:03:52,161
Please.

1081
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,060
No, I shouldn't.

1082
01:03:54,085 --> 01:03:55,099
You should.

1083
01:03:55,124 --> 01:03:56,158
- I shouldn't.
- You should.

1084
01:03:56,183 --> 01:03:57,436
- I shouldn't.
- You should.

1085
01:03:57,461 --> 01:03:59,245
I will.

1086
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:09,197
May I?

1087
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:10,850
Please.

1088
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:26,193
Oh!

1089
01:04:36,632 --> 01:04:38,674
It's made of glass.

1090
01:04:38,699 --> 01:04:40,640
And why not?

1091
01:04:40,665 --> 01:04:41,832
Allow me.

1092
01:04:41,865 --> 01:04:43,515
Thank you.

1093
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:56,068
There.

1094
01:04:56,221 --> 01:04:57,622
There.

1095
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:04,738
Won't you tell me
who you really are?

1096
01:05:04,763 --> 01:05:07,892
If I do, I think everything
might be different.

1097
01:05:07,934 --> 01:05:11,621
I don't understand.
Can you at least tell me your name?

1098
01:05:11,646 --> 01:05:13,774
My name is...

1099
01:05:18,101 --> 01:05:20,134
I have to leave.

1100
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,030
It's hard to explain.

1101
01:05:22,055 --> 01:05:25,742
Lizards and pumpkins,
and things.

1102
01:05:27,968 --> 01:05:29,448
Wait!

1103
01:05:30,902 --> 01:05:32,512
Where are you going?

1104
01:05:32,537 --> 01:05:34,463
You've been awfully nice.

1105
01:05:34,488 --> 01:05:36,631
Thank you for a wonderful evening.
I've loved it.

1106
01:05:36,656 --> 01:05:38,471
Every second!

1107
01:05:46,331 --> 01:05:48,732
"Lizards and pumpkins."

1108
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:08,875
Oh.
Excuse me.

1109
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,128
Sorry! Terribly sorry.

1110
01:06:11,173 --> 01:06:12,714
MAN: 
Oh. My goodness!

1111
01:06:12,739 --> 01:06:14,144
Your Highness.

1112
01:06:14,732 --> 01:06:16,549
My prince!
May I...

1113
01:06:17,508 --> 01:06:18,901
DRISELLA:
You've got the wrong one!

1114
01:06:18,926 --> 01:06:21,092
You've got the wrong one!

1115
01:06:21,339 --> 01:06:22,265
MAN 1:
He needs her name!

1116
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:23,279
MAN 2:
I know he needs her name.

1117
01:06:23,304 --> 01:06:25,210
Her name, you ninny.
Get her name!

1118
01:06:25,235 --> 01:06:27,440
Ooh, 
that really hurt!

1119
01:06:27,465 --> 01:06:28,919
Oh, Your Majesty.

1120
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:30,190
Young lady.

1121
01:06:30,215 --> 01:06:30,941
I am so sorry.

1122
01:06:30,966 --> 01:06:33,822
Oh, think nothing
of it, my dear.

1123
01:06:35,073 --> 01:06:36,833
I wanted to say,
Your Majesty,

1124
01:06:36,858 --> 01:06:39,382
your son Kit is the most lovely
person I ever met.

1125
01:06:39,407 --> 01:06:41,439
So good and brave.

1126
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:44,137
I hope you know
how much he loves you.

1127
01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:46,841
Excuse me!

1128
01:06:58,692 --> 01:07:00,656
Mmm.

1129
01:07:04,977 --> 01:07:06,450
PRINCE:
Wait!

1130
01:07:10,707 --> 01:07:12,595
Wait!

1131
01:07:12,822 --> 01:07:14,179
Where are you going?

1132
01:07:14,204 --> 01:07:15,516
CINDERELLA:
Hurry, hurry!

1133
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:17,212
Eh? Ah!

1134
01:07:17,758 --> 01:07:19,560
PRINCE:
Come back!

1135
01:07:21,627 --> 01:07:23,230
CINDERELLA:
Hurry!

1136
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:27,286
Hurry, please, 
Mr. Goose!

1137
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,014
Wait!

1138
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:35,320
MR. GOOSE:
Watch out!

1139
01:07:40,667 --> 01:07:41,819
Captain, my horse.

1140
01:07:41,844 --> 01:07:43,023
GRAND DUKE: No!

1141
01:07:43,048 --> 01:07:45,878
This may be some intrigue to lure you
from the palace.

1142
01:07:45,903 --> 01:07:48,004
Your father
needs you here.

1143
01:07:48,761 --> 01:07:50,186
Captain!

1144
01:07:50,211 --> 01:07:51,609
I was having
a fine old time.

1145
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:54,110
You had to go and
choose that one, didn't you?

1146
01:07:55,597 --> 01:07:57,569
Yes, I did.

1147
01:08:22,447 --> 01:08:23,747
Hurry, Mr. Goose!

1148
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,686
Come on!

1149
01:08:27,247 --> 01:08:28,491
MR. GOOSE: Hee-ya!

1150
01:08:28,516 --> 01:08:29,787
CINDERELLA:
Be careful, Mr. Goose!

1151
01:08:29,812 --> 01:08:31,036
MR. GOOSE: Oh!

1152
01:08:31,061 --> 01:08:32,457
Whoa!

1153
01:08:34,397 --> 01:08:36,045
Oh, my goodness!

1154
01:08:44,315 --> 01:08:47,270
GRAND DUKE: You there!
Stop in the name of the king!

1155
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:50,201
Such bad timing.

1156
01:08:53,611 --> 01:08:54,603
GRAND DUKE: Halt there!

1157
01:08:54,628 --> 01:08:56,156
MR. LIZARD: I know what to do!

1158
01:08:56,181 --> 01:08:57,149
Yes!

1159
01:08:57,182 --> 01:08:59,404
Oh, yes!

1160
01:08:59,429 --> 01:09:01,411
GRAND DUKE:
Get this thing open!

1161
01:09:05,616 --> 01:09:06,961
Oh, dear!

1162
01:09:06,986 --> 01:09:08,275
Ah!

1163
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,447
Oh.

1164
01:09:11,059 --> 01:09:12,520
Oh no.

1165
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,736
No.
No.

1166
01:09:16,751 --> 01:09:19,045
Oh, no, no...

1167
01:10:28,722 --> 01:10:30,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

1168
01:10:31,255 --> 01:10:34,087
You'll find it's
very comfortable.

1169
01:10:41,048 --> 01:10:42,553
Oh...

1170
01:10:58,357 --> 01:11:00,088
STEPMOTHER:
Do shut up!

1171
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:03,491
ANASTASIA:
Cinderella!

1172
01:11:03,524 --> 01:11:06,026
DRISELLA: Cinderella!
We'll have to wake her up.

1173
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:08,533
Cinderella!

1174
01:11:08,558 --> 01:11:10,458
Wake up, lazy bones!

1175
01:11:10,483 --> 01:11:12,279
Tea and a plate
of biscuits.

1176
01:11:12,304 --> 01:11:13,676
CINDERELLA:
Welcome back!

1177
01:11:13,701 --> 01:11:16,128
- ANASTASIA: You look cheerful!
- DRISELLA: And wet!

1178
01:11:16,153 --> 01:11:18,344
Oh, uh, I took a walk
in the rain to cheer myself up.

1179
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:19,418
Typical.

1180
01:11:19,451 --> 01:11:20,842
Tea.

1181
01:11:20,867 --> 01:11:22,901
DRISELLA: We did not communicate
through mere words.

1182
01:11:22,926 --> 01:11:24,001
Our souls met.

1183
01:11:24,026 --> 01:11:26,636
ANASTASIA: Precisely.
My soul and the prince's soul.

1184
01:11:26,661 --> 01:11:28,135
Your soul was over
by the banquet tables.

1185
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,872
You didn't see
him dance with me.

1186
01:11:29,897 --> 01:11:30,993
Dance with you?

1187
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:33,087
He didn't even speak to you.

1188
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:35,514
It was not our fault, Mother.
It was that girl.

1189
01:11:35,539 --> 01:11:37,180
The mystery princess.

1190
01:11:37,205 --> 01:11:39,202
Mystery princess?

1191
01:11:39,227 --> 01:11:40,829
My, what a charming notion.

1192
01:11:40,854 --> 01:11:42,636
STEPMOTHER:
Oh, she was no princess.

1193
01:11:42,661 --> 01:11:45,627
She was a preening interloper who made
a spectacle of herself.

1194
01:11:45,652 --> 01:11:46,973
Oh?

1195
01:11:47,027 --> 01:11:49,345
A vulgar, young hussy
marched into the ball,

1196
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:51,386
unaccompanied, if you will,

1197
01:11:51,411 --> 01:11:53,922
and to the horror of everyone,
threw herself at the prince.

1198
01:11:53,954 --> 01:11:56,158
ANASTASIA: And he actually
danced with the ugly thing.

1199
01:11:56,183 --> 01:11:57,315
- Yes?
- DRISELLA: Yes.

1200
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:58,525
It was pity.

1201
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:01,306
He was too polite to send her packing in
front of everyone, you see.

1202
01:12:01,331 --> 01:12:04,865
But not wanting to expose us
to the presumptuous wench any further,

1203
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:06,703
- he took her apart.
- ANASTASIA: And told her off.

1204
01:12:06,728 --> 01:12:08,137
But she refused to leave

1205
01:12:08,162 --> 01:12:11,536
and the palace guards
chased her from the party!

1206
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:13,693
I pity the prince.
Such bad taste.

1207
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:15,263
They belong
with each other.

1208
01:12:15,296 --> 01:12:16,835
Well, it's no matter, girls.

1209
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:19,292
The ball was a mere diversion.

1210
01:12:19,329 --> 01:12:21,653
The prince is not free
to marry for love.

1211
01:12:21,697 --> 01:12:25,324
He's promised to the
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa.

1212
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,467
The Grand Duke
told me himself.

1213
01:12:27,492 --> 01:12:29,799
DRISELLA: It's so very unfair.

1214
01:12:29,824 --> 01:12:31,728
Yes.

1215
01:12:31,753 --> 01:12:34,678
The way of the world.

1216
01:12:37,964 --> 01:12:40,344
Oh, hello again.

1217
01:12:51,032 --> 01:12:53,046
Thank you for your help.

1218
01:12:53,365 --> 01:12:55,774
It really was like a dream.

1219
01:12:55,799 --> 01:12:58,135
Better than a dream.

1220
01:13:12,966 --> 01:13:14,862
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Ella couldn't wait to write down

1221
01:13:14,887 --> 01:13:16,575
all that had happened,

1222
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,300
so that she might remember
every single bit of it

1223
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:22,901
just as if she were telling
her mother and father

1224
01:13:22,934 --> 01:13:27,818
about the palace ball
and her time with the prince.

1225
01:13:31,435 --> 01:13:34,152
Above all, the prince.

1226
01:13:56,769 --> 01:13:58,645
Oh, you've come.

1227
01:13:59,196 --> 01:14:00,826
Good.

1228
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,347
Oh, Father.

1229
01:14:04,002 --> 01:14:05,696
Don't go.

1230
01:14:06,498 --> 01:14:08,189
I must.

1231
01:14:08,737 --> 01:14:11,354
You needn't be alone.

1232
01:14:11,404 --> 01:14:13,553
Take a bride.

1233
01:14:13,578 --> 01:14:16,125
The Princess Chelina.

1234
01:14:16,268 --> 01:14:19,653
What if I commanded
you to do so?

1235
01:14:20,838 --> 01:14:24,223
I love and respect you,
but I will not.

1236
01:14:26,071 --> 01:14:30,134
I believe that we
need not look outside of our borders

1237
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,659
for strength or guidance.

1238
01:14:32,972 --> 01:14:35,835
What we need
is right before us.

1239
01:14:35,905 --> 01:14:39,477
And we need only have courage

1240
01:14:39,502 --> 01:14:41,763
and be kind to see it.

1241
01:14:44,206 --> 01:14:46,082
Just so.

1242
01:14:48,106 --> 01:14:50,748
You've become your own man.

1243
01:14:50,773 --> 01:14:52,589
Good.

1244
01:14:54,106 --> 01:14:57,207
And perhaps,
in the little time left to me,

1245
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,697
I can become
the father you deserve.

1246
01:15:03,474 --> 01:15:06,832
You must not
marry for advantage.

1247
01:15:08,874 --> 01:15:11,350
You must marry for love.

1248
01:15:14,908 --> 01:15:17,283
Find that girl.

1249
01:15:17,308 --> 01:15:18,924
Find her.

1250
01:15:18,942 --> 01:15:21,376
The one they're
all talking about.

1251
01:15:21,409 --> 01:15:22,612
The forgetful one

1252
01:15:22,637 --> 01:15:25,326
- who loses her shoes.
- ...loses her shoes.

1253
01:15:30,717 --> 01:15:33,441
Oh, be cheerful, boy.

1254
01:15:35,509 --> 01:15:37,694
Thank you, Father.

1255
01:15:37,877 --> 01:15:40,372
Thank you, Kit.

1256
01:15:44,643 --> 01:15:46,936
I love you, son.

1257
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:50,169
I love you, Father.

1258
01:16:21,813 --> 01:16:24,413
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  Once the time
for mourning had passed,

1259
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:26,834
a proclamation was sent out.

1260
01:16:26,859 --> 01:16:30,493
ROYAL CRIER:
Hear ye! Hear ye!

1261
01:16:30,518 --> 01:16:33,272
Hear ye!

1262
01:16:38,062 --> 01:16:40,323
Know that our new king

1263
01:16:40,348 --> 01:16:45,111
hereby declares
his love for... for...

1264
01:16:46,114 --> 01:16:49,356
the mysterious princess...

1265
01:16:49,381 --> 01:16:50,701
as wore...

1266
01:16:50,726 --> 01:16:53,512
glass slippers to the ball.

1267
01:16:53,537 --> 01:16:59,010
And requests that
she present herself at the palace,

1268
01:16:59,035 --> 01:17:03,411
whereupon,
if she be willing,

1269
01:17:03,436 --> 01:17:07,345
he will forthwith...

1270
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:09,279
marry her...

1271
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:13,286
...with all due ceremony.

1272
01:17:47,806 --> 01:17:50,091
Are you looking for this?

1273
01:17:50,752 --> 01:17:53,351
There must be quite
a story to go with it.

1274
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:55,087
Won't you tell me?

1275
01:17:55,252 --> 01:17:56,890
No?

1276
01:17:57,023 --> 01:17:58,449
All right then.

1277
01:17:58,474 --> 01:18:01,202
I shall tell you a story.

1278
01:18:01,553 --> 01:18:03,444
Once upon a time,

1279
01:18:03,469 --> 01:18:06,461
there was a beautiful
young girl

1280
01:18:06,486 --> 01:18:08,662
who married for love.

1281
01:18:08,687 --> 01:18:11,720
And she had
two loving daughters.

1282
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:13,609
All was well...

1283
01:18:13,634 --> 01:18:17,555
but, one day, her husband,

1284
01:18:17,588 --> 01:18:20,695
the light of her life, died.

1285
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:22,294
The next time,

1286
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:25,279
she married for the sake
of her daughters.

1287
01:18:25,321 --> 01:18:29,065
But that man, too,
was taken from her.

1288
01:18:29,088 --> 01:18:35,303
And she was doomed to look every day
upon his beloved child.

1289
01:18:36,355 --> 01:18:39,310
She had hoped to marry off
one of her beautiful,

1290
01:18:39,335 --> 01:18:42,133

stupid daughters to
the prince.

1291
01:18:42,155 --> 01:18:46,423
But his head was turned
by a girl with glass slippers.

1292
01:18:46,448 --> 01:18:47,998
And so...

1293
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:52,150
I lived unhappily ever after.

1294
01:18:53,823 --> 01:18:56,939
My story would appear
to be ended.

1295
01:18:57,057 --> 01:19:00,110
Now, tell me yours.

1296
01:19:00,454 --> 01:19:02,426
Did you steal it?

1297
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:04,018
No.

1298
01:19:04,538 --> 01:19:05,647
It was given to me.

1299
01:19:05,672 --> 01:19:07,490
Given to you?
Given to you?

1300
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:08,658
Nothing is ever given.

1301
01:19:08,683 --> 01:19:10,484
For everything,
we must pay and pay.

1302
01:19:10,524 --> 01:19:12,733
That's not true.

1303
01:19:12,992 --> 01:19:14,887
Kindness is free.

1304
01:19:14,912 --> 01:19:15,934
Love is free.

1305
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:18,374
Love is not free.

1306
01:19:18,492 --> 01:19:22,258
Now, here is
how you will pay me,

1307
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:25,330
if you are to have
what you desire.

1308
01:19:25,392 --> 01:19:30,035
No one will believe you,
a dirty servant girl without a family,

1309
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,500
if you lay claim
to the prince's heart.

1310
01:19:32,525 --> 01:19:34,960
But with a respectable
gentlewoman to put you forward,

1311
01:19:34,993 --> 01:19:37,068
you will not be ignored.

1312
01:19:37,093 --> 01:19:38,360
When you are married,

1313
01:19:38,393 --> 01:19:41,909
you will make me the head
of the royal household.

1314
01:19:41,934 --> 01:19:44,993
Anastasia and Drisella
we will pair off with wealthy lords.

1315
01:19:45,026 --> 01:19:48,505
And I... 
shall manage that boy.

1316
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:50,935
But he's not a boy.

1317
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,893
And who are you?

1318
01:19:52,926 --> 01:19:55,332
How would you
rule a kingdom?

1319
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:57,038
Best to leave it to me.

1320
01:19:57,063 --> 01:19:59,835
That way we all get
what we want.

1321
01:20:00,604 --> 01:20:02,322
No.

1322
01:20:05,536 --> 01:20:07,307
No?

1323
01:20:07,695 --> 01:20:09,728
I was not able to protect
my father from you,

1324
01:20:09,761 --> 01:20:12,457
but I will protect the prince
and the kingdom...

1325
01:20:12,928 --> 01:20:14,782
no matter what becomes of me.

1326
01:20:14,807 --> 01:20:18,728
Well, that is a mistake.

1327
01:20:19,136 --> 01:20:20,321
No!

1328
01:20:20,346 --> 01:20:22,361
But why?

1329
01:20:23,096 --> 01:20:25,869
Why are you so cruel?

1330
01:20:26,066 --> 01:20:27,896
I don't understand it.

1331
01:20:27,929 --> 01:20:29,989
I've tried to be kind to you.

1332
01:20:30,029 --> 01:20:31,483
You? Kind to me?

1333
01:20:31,508 --> 01:20:32,930
Yes.

1334
01:20:32,963 --> 01:20:35,196
And though no one
deserves to be treated

1335
01:20:35,229 --> 01:20:37,405
as you have treated me.

1336
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:39,335
Why do you do it?

1337
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:41,664
Why?

1338
01:20:41,697 --> 01:20:43,200
Why?

1339
01:20:43,225 --> 01:20:48,131
Because you are young,
and innocent, and good.

1340
01:20:48,164 --> 01:20:50,190
And I...

1341
01:20:54,211 --> 01:20:55,504
CINDERELLA: No!

1342
01:20:55,529 --> 01:20:56,837
No!

1343
01:21:01,498 --> 01:21:03,466
GRAND DUKE:
May I ask where you got this?

1344
01:21:03,499 --> 01:21:06,402
From a ragged
servant girl in my household.

1345
01:21:07,232 --> 01:21:10,508
The mystery princess
is a commoner.

1346
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:15,924
You could imagine when I discovered
 her subterfuge how horrified I was.

1347
01:21:15,949 --> 01:21:17,582
You told no one else?

1348
01:21:17,607 --> 01:21:20,308
Not even my own daughters.

1349
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:23,302
No one need ever
know the truth.

1350
01:21:23,366 --> 01:21:27,392
You've spared the kingdom
a great deal of embarrassment.

1351
01:21:27,485 --> 01:21:30,548
And I should like
to keep it that way.

1352
01:21:30,618 --> 01:21:32,708
Are you threatening me?

1353
01:21:32,733 --> 01:21:34,670
Yes.

1354
01:21:40,668 --> 01:21:42,459
So what do you want?

1355
01:21:42,801 --> 01:21:45,447
I should like
to be a countess.

1356
01:21:45,579 --> 01:21:49,480
And I require advantageous marriages
for my two daughters.

1357
01:21:50,771 --> 01:21:52,415
Done.

1358
01:21:54,502 --> 01:21:55,679
And the girl?

1359
01:21:55,704 --> 01:21:56,744
Oh.

1360
01:21:56,769 --> 01:21:58,803
Do with her
what you will.

1361
01:21:59,852 --> 01:22:01,711
She's nothing to me.

1362
01:22:02,703 --> 01:22:04,977
- Where?
- Abandoned on the side of the road.

1363
01:22:05,002 --> 01:22:06,522
- And have you found her?
- The girl?

1364
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:08,145
No, she's disappeared.

1365
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:10,216
There must be some
reason she vanished.

1366
01:22:10,236 --> 01:22:11,923
Perhaps she has been
prevented from speaking.

1367
01:22:11,948 --> 01:22:13,148
CAPTAIN:
Do not lose heart, Kit.

1368
01:22:13,173 --> 01:22:16,345
On the contrary,
lose heart and gain wisdom.

1369
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:19,279
The people need to know
that the kingdom is secure.

1370
01:22:19,304 --> 01:22:22,807
That the king has a queen,
and the land may have an heir.

1371
01:22:22,832 --> 01:22:24,671
They want to face the
future with certainty!

1372
01:22:24,704 --> 01:22:26,638
Agreed!
Then let us be certain.

1373
01:22:26,671 --> 01:22:28,112
I am king.

1374
01:22:28,137 --> 01:22:30,772
I say we shall seek out
the mystery princess,

1375
01:22:30,805 --> 01:22:32,505
even if she does
not want to be found.

1376
01:22:32,538 --> 01:22:34,338
I have to see her again.

1377
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:36,380
But if she's not found...

1378
01:22:36,405 --> 01:22:40,442
then for the good of the kingdom,
you must marry the Princess Chelina.

1379
01:22:41,072 --> 01:22:43,199
For the good of the kingdom.

1380
01:22:54,073 --> 01:22:55,839
Very well, agreed.

1381
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,935
CAPTAIN:
But Your Highness...

1382
01:23:02,407 --> 01:23:04,274
But you will
spare no effort.

1383
01:23:04,307 --> 01:23:05,974
Your Majesty, of course.

1384
01:23:06,007 --> 01:23:07,708
You have my word.

1385
01:23:26,575 --> 01:23:28,592
- MAN: Next.
- Oh.

1386
01:23:32,579 --> 01:23:36,235
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  The slipper traveled
the length and breadth of the kingdom,

1387
01:23:36,875 --> 01:23:38,925
visiting every maiden
both high and low,

1388
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:41,460
and every sort in between.

1389
01:23:41,485 --> 01:23:42,550
Oh, Lord!

1390
01:23:42,575 --> 01:23:43,861
GRAND DUKE:
You first, madam.

1391
01:23:43,886 --> 01:23:46,405
Well, I'll give it a go.

1392
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:49,218
Right. I say.
Where do you want me?

1393
01:23:49,243 --> 01:23:50,384
Oh!

1394
01:23:50,409 --> 01:23:51,910
Up! Up I go.

1395
01:23:51,935 --> 01:23:53,769
Oh, careful,
my foot's a bit swollen.

1396
01:23:53,794 --> 01:23:55,518
I've been...

1397
01:23:57,767 --> 01:23:59,793
It's the yeast.

1398
01:23:59,844 --> 01:24:02,829
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  The Grand
Duke was true to his word.

1399
01:24:02,854 --> 01:24:05,811
He spared no effort to
demonstrate to the prince

1400
01:24:05,844 --> 01:24:09,180
that the mystery princess
was not to be found.

1401
01:24:09,205 --> 01:24:10,974
- WOMAN: It fits!
- It doesn't fit you.

1402
01:24:10,999 --> 01:24:12,302
- It does fit!
- It doesn't fit.

1403
01:24:12,327 --> 01:24:13,307
- WOMAN: It's mine!
- No, it's not your's.

1404
01:24:13,332 --> 01:24:15,339
- I am the mystery princess!
- Give back the shoe.

1405
01:24:15,364 --> 01:24:16,561
Take the shoe
away from her!

1406
01:24:16,605 --> 01:24:18,172
Don't take the shoe
away from me, please, please!

1407
01:24:18,197 --> 01:24:19,821
Please, it's my shoe!

1408
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:21,821
MAN:
Make way for the slipper!

1409
01:24:30,312 --> 01:24:31,446
Can I try the other foot?

1410
01:24:31,479 --> 01:24:33,409
I don't think so.

1411
01:24:33,513 --> 01:24:35,122
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
But whatever they tried,

1412
01:24:35,147 --> 01:24:39,374
the magical slipper refused to fit
even the most eligible of maidens.

1413
01:24:39,399 --> 01:24:42,497
MAN: We found the mystery
princess for ya!

1414
01:24:51,902 --> 01:24:53,920
What's wrong, Captain?

1415
01:24:54,513 --> 01:24:56,476
We haven't found the girl.

1416
01:24:56,501 --> 01:24:57,988
I'm disappointed
for our king.

1417
01:24:58,013 --> 01:25:00,415
Oh, come on, now!
Don't lose heart.

1418
01:25:00,448 --> 01:25:02,611
There's one more house.

1419
01:25:02,636 --> 01:25:05,593
We must leave
no stone unturned.

1420
01:25:06,481 --> 01:25:07,947
- ANASTASIA: Horses!
- DRISELLA: Horses!

1421
01:25:07,972 --> 01:25:10,278
ANASTASIA:
Mother, it's our chance!

1422
01:25:10,303 --> 01:25:12,034
Quick, quick, quick...

1423
01:25:13,916 --> 01:25:16,064
Let them in!

1424
01:25:24,126 --> 01:25:25,602
<font color="#b39f84">Gus-Gus: (Someone at the window.)</font>

1425
01:25:27,516 --> 01:25:30,743
STEPMOTHER: Gentlemen!
What a wonderful surprise.

1426
01:25:30,783 --> 01:25:32,468
GRAND DUKE:
A moment of your time, good lady.

1427
01:25:32,493 --> 01:25:34,508
STEPMOTHER:
Of course, Your Grace.

1428
01:25:34,533 --> 01:25:37,637
Please. 
This way.

1429
01:25:37,783 --> 01:25:40,284
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  Ella did not
know who was downstairs.

1430
01:25:40,317 --> 01:25:41,782
Nor did she care.

1431
01:25:41,807 --> 01:25:42,717
Gus-Gus.

1432
01:25:42,751 --> 01:25:44,375
For surely no one
had come to see her.

1433
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,180
CINDERELLA:
Jacqueline, stop it!

1434
01:25:52,551 --> 01:25:54,325
It shrunk.

1435
01:25:54,664 --> 01:25:56,320
Try again.

1436
01:26:04,552 --> 01:26:06,551
Oh, enough!

1437
01:26:07,186 --> 01:26:08,879
♪ You must love me... dilly, dilly ♪
♪ For I love you ♪

1438
01:26:08,904 --> 01:26:10,387
FAIRY GODMOTHER:
Though Ella was sad,

1439
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:12,244
her spirit was not broken.

1440
01:26:12,269 --> 01:26:13,761
She knew that the ball,

1441
01:26:13,786 --> 01:26:15,279
and her time
with the prince,

1442
01:26:15,304 --> 01:26:17,753

Cinderella's stepmother
and her daughters

1537
01:33:24,949 --> 01:33:27,236
would soon leave
with the Grand Duke,

1538

myself in paintings.

1549
01:34:27,586 --> 01:34:31,168
FAIRY GODMOTHER:  And so Kit
and Ella were married,

1550
01:34:31,193 --> 01:34:34,171
and I can tell you,
as her fairy godmother,

1551
01:34:34,196 --> 01:34:35,754
that they were counted to be

1552
01:34:35,787 --> 01:34:40,432
the fairest and kindest rulers
the kingdom had known.

1553
01:34:40,487 --> 01:34:44,898
And Ella continued to see
the world not as it is,

1554
01:34:44,923 --> 01:34:46,809
but as it could be,

1555
01:34:46,834 --> 01:34:49,698
if only you believe
in courage...

1556
01:34:49,723 --> 01:34:53,025
and kindness
and occasionally...

1557
01:34:53,055 --> 01:34:54,798
just a little bit...

1558
01:34:54,823 --> 01:34:56,846
of magic.

1559
01:34:57,728 --> 01:35:02,815
