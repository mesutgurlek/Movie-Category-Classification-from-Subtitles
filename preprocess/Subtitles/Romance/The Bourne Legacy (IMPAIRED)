Uh, meaning what?

161
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,214
Meaning we will burn the

It's about half-a-mile up.

630
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,111
Thanks.

631
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,907
Dr. Shearing?
Uh-huh.

632
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,084
Hi, I'm Dr. Connie Dowd.

633
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,881
Hi, how are you?
Well, thanks.

634
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,751
This is Special
Agent Larry Hooper.

635
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:10,914
Hello.
Hello.

636
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,288
Please. Come in.

637
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,326
DR. DOWD: Thanks for
letting us come out.

638
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,498
It's a remarkable property.
What a project.

639
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:21,829
Yeah, I really don't want
to talk about the house.

640
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:24,097
Not unless you want to buy it.

641
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:30,308
Sit, I guess. Please.

642
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,905
MARTA: Just so you know, okay,

643
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:37,577
I didn't know anything about
this meeting until an hour ago.

644
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,119
And nobody last night
said to make time

645
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:41,951
or pick a time,
or anything like that.

646
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,858
And then, this morning, I buy a
plane ticket to see my sister

647
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:47,690
and suddenly it's like
DEFCON 4 around here.

648
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:49,489
And that is not paranoia, okay?

649
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,292
That is pretty much
directly in my face!

650
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:52,355
DR. DOWD: Understood.

651
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,128
Should we not be
paying attention?

652
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,793
Can you leave us alone, Larry?

653
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:02,533
Look.

654
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,441
You’ve just been through an
extremely traumatic experience.

655
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:08,481
Yeah. Doctor of what?

656
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:10,173
What are you?

657
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,685
Clinical psychology.

658
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:14,285
Oh. So, what do you do?

659
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:17,482
You give grief
counseling to spies?

660
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,991
You have a very unusual
security clearance, Marta.

661
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:21,491
You should expect
that buying a ticket

662
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:24,054
to Montreal without telling
anyone would set off some bells.

663
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:28,134
Yeah, I've got some bells
of my own going off, okay?

664
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,736
I mean, are you going to be
the person who tells me

665
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,500
what the hell is going on here,

666
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,541
or are you just the next
mystery babysitter?

667
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:35,677
What do you think is going on?

668
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,403
What I'm trying
to do is not think.

669
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,274
I just... I want
to stop thinking.

670
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:42,405
Have you discussed those
feelings with anyone else?

671
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:43,880
Your sister? Friends?

672
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,075
Are you for real?

673
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,654
What about Peter Boyd?

674
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:49,990
Wow.

675
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:51,651
Okay.

676
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:55,058
So, we're into everything, is that it?
Is anything off-limits here?

677
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:58,498
Have you ever read your
employment security contract?

678
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,328
Have I read my...

679
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,663
If you're asking me whether I
understand my disclosure restrictions,

680
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:06,603
yes, I have a PhD
in biochemistry

681
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:09,405
with postdoctoral fellowships
in virology and genetics.

682
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:10,840
I know how to read!

683
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:14,341
What I don't understand
is why my colleague

684
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:18,546
has a psychotic episode
and shot everyone in the lab.

685
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:23,185
Are you aware of what
we do in there?

686
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,522
Are you?

687
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,696
I mean, how do I know that you're
even cleared for this conversation?

688
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:30,889
Have you discussed anything
to do with the incident

689
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:33,127
with anyone other
than the investigators?

690
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,536
Peter Boyd moved
out eight months ago.

691
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,265
But I guess you
already know that.

692
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:40,101
And, no, I haven't
spoken to him.

693
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:44,712
You stated that you and Dr. Foite had
no relationship outside of work.

694
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,470
None.

695
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:51,178
There was material in his
apartment that indicates he had

696
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,084
an unusual fixation with you.

697
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:58,482
Photographs, journal entries. They
found several articles of clothing.

698
00:56:58,848 --> 00:56:59,849
What?

699
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,760
Did you ever rebuff him
in any way?

700
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:03,820
No.

701
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,256
No, no, I...

702
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:11,328
I always thought he was gay.

703
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:15,067
Look, no one is suggesting that
you're responsible for what happened.

704
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:16,199
Oh. Thank you.

705
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,974
Survivors often experience
feelings of guilt.

706
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:21,340
Those feelings can be amplified

707
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:25,511
by the realization
that he let you live.

708
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:30,485
That he let me live?

709
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,791
Have you seen the video?

710
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,831
Do you really think
that's what it shows?

711
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,628
You are asking all
the wrong questions!

712
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:42,895
What should I be asking, Marta?

713
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,530
Has anyone looked at
Dr. Foite's blood work?

714
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:46,696
Have they?

715
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:49,605
I mean, that is the only thing that
is going to make any sense, here.

716
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,143
His behavior was...

717
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,543
Look, there are
projects at Sterisyn,

718
00:57:54,604 --> 00:58:00,179
defense projects that could
explain why he did what he did.

719
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:06,285
And people there are working
on behavioral design.

720
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:10,388
It's programmable behavior,
neural design.

721
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:15,336
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

722
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,796
I think he was exposed
to something at the lab.

723
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,375
Found it.

724
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,646
What are you doing?

725
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:30,543
That's my gun.
What the hell is this?

726
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,209
You're a potential
suicide risk.

727
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:33,945
No. Wait a minute.
How did you...

728
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,683
How did he find that?
Marta...

729
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,189
No, no. Okay.
This meeting is now over.

730
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:41,422
I want you both out of here, right now!
Marta...

731
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,361
No! He has been
snooping around my house!

732
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,695
Marta, I want to
sign off here today!

to help us out!

We have got to go through this.

737
00:58:56,366 --> 00:59:00,143
I need to know that you are calm
and safe before I leave here

738
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:04,117
and I need to know that you understand
the rules before you get on that plane.

Please, sit down and let us
get through our questions.

ask yourself this.

No, nobody. I have no idea.

910

the burn rates, dosage
panels, tissue stress.

and we would never do it here.

Okay. On-site, where? Where?

919

feel physically degraded.

medication last year.

What?

Jesus. They viraled everyone
off greens eight months ago.

They infected you
with live virus,

which means that,
physically, you're stable.

You don't need to take greens.

939
01:12:51,126 --> 01:12:53,265
They locked it in.

940
01:12:53,428 --> 01:12:57,274
Any physical enhancement
is now permanent.

941
01:12:57,632 --> 01:12:59,407
So, you infected me?

942
01:13:00,135 --> 01:13:02,012
When was this?

943
01:13:03,572 --> 01:13:04,778
Is this when I was sick?

944
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:07,113
The mystery flu?
That was you?

945
01:13:07,676 --> 01:13:10,589
Well, it wasn't me.
I didn't do it.

on purpose, right?

01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,254
When I almost died.

948
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,620
I'm sorry, but it wasn't me.

949
01:13:16,785 --> 01:13:19,026
Why am I still taking
green pills, then?

950
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:21,633
I don't know.
I thought you had stopped.

951
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:23,827
Why am I asking you anything?

952
01:13:23,992 --> 01:13:26,199
Or to keep us
on a leash, right?

953
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:27,999
Is that it?
To keep a hold on us?

954
01:13:28,163 --> 01:13:30,143
To keep us dependent?

955
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,711
Who tells you
that this is okay?

956
01:13:33,869 --> 01:13:35,371
No one... I do...

957
01:13:35,437 --> 01:13:36,438
Who says it's okay?

958
01:13:36,505 --> 01:13:37,916
I do research.

959
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:42,613
I design, I survey.
I don't administer meds.

960
01:13:42,778 --> 01:13:44,223
I don't make policy!

961
01:13:44,813 --> 01:13:46,383
No, you just load the gun.

962
01:13:46,548 --> 01:13:48,528
Oh, God.

963
01:13:49,284 --> 01:13:52,026
Look, I was there
for the science.

964
01:13:52,187 --> 01:13:55,293
We were all there for science.

965
01:13:56,658 --> 01:13:59,070
And I know you don't care,
but I made a huge sacrifice.

966
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:00,831
I couldn't publish,
I couldn't conference.

967
01:14:00,896 --> 01:14:03,467
I couldn't tell a single
person what it was I did.

968
01:14:03,632 --> 01:14:07,079
But I thought I was helping my
country, and I know that's...

969
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:08,908
Tell me you can
viral off blues.

970
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,517
Can you viral off blues?

971
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:15,385
Theoretically, yes.

972
01:14:15,544 --> 01:14:16,648
Yeah.

973
01:14:16,812 --> 01:14:19,156
Pills allow for temporary adhesion.
Okay.

974
01:14:19,314 --> 01:14:22,124
To lock it in, you need live culture.
Live virus!

975
01:14:22,684 --> 01:14:24,891
You know how to do that.

976
01:14:25,053 --> 01:14:26,930
Do you know how to do that?

977
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,396
Yes.
Okay.

978
01:14:28,557 --> 01:14:31,766
Yes, but I told you, it's on
the other side of the planet.

979
01:14:32,694 --> 01:14:34,833
Well, guess where we're going?

980
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:41,409
WOMAN:<i> Welcome to Washington. Welcome
to Candent World Headquarters.</i>

981
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:43,481
<i>We want to make sure
that over the next few days</i>

982
01:14:43,538 --> 01:14:46,883
<i>you have a chance to connect with the
people who have made Sterisyn Morlanta</i>

983
01:14:46,942 --> 01:14:49,513
<i>the crown jewel in the
Candent group of companies.</i>

984
01:14:49,678 --> 01:14:52,682
Final Phase 3 testing approval
is expected this month

985
01:14:52,747 --> 01:14:54,886
for both reQuiel
and Supressolyn.

986
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:58,189
Confidence is high that we're coming in
on schedule, and we want to be ready.

987
01:14:58,553 --> 01:15:00,089
We know the market is eager.

988
01:15:00,155 --> 01:15:01,566
We know, globally,
the kind of...

989
01:15:07,062 --> 01:15:08,439
What the hell don't
I know about this?

990
01:15:08,597 --> 01:15:09,598
You're directing that at me?

991
01:15:09,664 --> 01:15:12,008
That was a D-Trac team
we sent in there.

992
01:15:12,067 --> 01:15:13,068
I don't know what that means.

993
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,238
It means they're
good at what they do.

994
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:15,440
I was told that
they were missing.

995
01:15:15,604 --> 01:15:17,379
They don't just go missing.

996
01:15:17,539 --> 01:15:19,075
What didn't you tell us
about this woman?

997
01:15:19,241 --> 01:15:21,152
Nothing. She is who she is.
There's nothing to tell.

998
01:15:21,309 --> 01:15:22,617
You vetted her up and down.

999
01:15:22,777 --> 01:15:23,949
Then what the hell
are we looking at?

1000
01:15:24,112 --> 01:15:25,455
INGRAM: She has
a registered gun.

1001
01:15:25,814 --> 01:15:26,918
TURSO: They knew that
going in.

1002
01:15:26,982 --> 01:15:28,393
She's got building permits.

1003
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:30,962
Propane, welding tanks.
A stray bullet?

1004
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:32,223
You want to keep guessing?

1005
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,424
We've got to get in there.

1006
01:15:33,488 --> 01:15:35,434
I've got a dozen people
waiting on the perimeter.

1007
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:36,591
We don't control the site?

1008
01:15:36,725 --> 01:15:37,760
DITA: Not yet.

1009
01:15:37,926 --> 01:15:38,927
Getting the picture now?

1010
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:40,061
Okay, stop!

1011
01:15:40,228 --> 01:15:41,332
I can't run this from here.

1012
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:43,908
I need a crisis suite. I need
integrated grids and comms.

1013
01:15:43,965 --> 01:15:44,966
I need all of it.

1014
01:15:45,033 --> 01:15:46,910
NSA, or Pentagon,
or Liberty Crossing.

1015
01:15:46,968 --> 01:15:48,914
I don't care, just
get me something now.

1016
01:15:49,037 --> 01:15:50,539
Pack up your codes
and your drives,

1017
01:15:50,605 --> 01:15:51,743
and whatever else
you're going to need.

1018
01:15:51,806 --> 01:15:53,194
We're going to move
and we're going to stay there.

1019
01:15:53,275 --> 01:15:56,620
Dita, how am I putting a net over that house?
There's locals all over it.

1020
01:15:57,078 --> 01:15:58,113
We go with germs.

1021
01:15:58,947 --> 01:16:00,085
She took samples from work.

1022
01:16:00,248 --> 01:16:02,353
Pathogens, viruses.
It's national security.

1023
01:16:02,417 --> 01:16:03,828
Good, okay,
I like that, it plays.

1024
01:16:03,952 --> 01:16:05,363
Now, get it out there,
get it out there.

1025
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:08,026
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Everybody find another gear, okay?

1026
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:09,793
Because I want to
be out of here in 20.

1027
01:16:11,826 --> 01:16:14,204
MARTA: So, let's say you want
to change the human body.

1028
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:15,705
You want to fix a mistake.

1029
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:19,334
You want to repair something,
improve something.

1030
01:16:19,501 --> 01:16:22,243
Well, if you're going to reprogram
human genetic material,

1031
01:16:22,304 --> 01:16:25,717
you need a delivery system, and
nothing works better than virus.

1032
01:16:25,941 --> 01:16:27,284
It's like a suitcase.

1033
01:16:27,342 --> 01:16:30,448
You pack in genetic mutation,

1034
01:16:30,512 --> 01:16:35,518
infect the body and the vector
unloads into the target cells.

1035
01:16:35,884 --> 01:16:40,060
But getting it where you
want it, how you want it,

1036
01:16:40,121 --> 01:16:41,225
is the nightmare.

1037
01:16:41,289 --> 01:16:43,496
Unless you have a map.

1038
01:16:44,292 --> 01:16:48,672
There was this terrible accident
at Fort Detrick in 1985.

1039
01:16:49,464 --> 01:16:53,776
Five researchers dropped dead in the
lab, and it was such a catastrophe

1040
01:16:53,835 --> 01:16:55,246
that they brought in
Dan Hillcott

1041
01:16:55,303 --> 01:16:58,011
from Stanford
to assess the damage.

1042
01:16:58,173 --> 01:17:02,644
He got in there and he realized
that, underneath it all,

1043
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:07,717
was this incredible breakthrough
in viral-receptor mapping.

1044
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:09,721
He had a map.

1045
01:17:11,386 --> 01:17:14,424
You've had some
very minor alterations

1046
01:17:14,489 --> 01:17:16,196
made to two different
chromosomes.

1047
01:17:16,391 --> 01:17:18,337
The green side,
the physical side,

1048
01:17:18,393 --> 01:17:20,532
is nothing more
than a 1.5 percent rise

1049
01:17:20,595 --> 01:17:23,303
in your mitochondrial
protein uptake.

1050
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:25,208
But with 1.5 percent,

1051
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:29,715
you see this immediate
increase in cellular tempo,

1052
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:32,513
muscle efficiency,
oxygenation...

1053
01:17:32,707 --> 01:17:33,708
And the blue side?

1054
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:36,253
Intelligence, obviously,
but it's more than that.

1055
01:17:36,311 --> 01:17:39,690
It's neural regeneration
and elasticity.

1056
01:17:39,748 --> 01:17:43,696
Sensory function.
Pain suppression.

1057
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:47,327
It's the most exciting
development in genomic targeting

1058
01:17:47,389 --> 01:17:49,699
in the history of the science.

1059
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:11,923
My God.

1060
01:18:16,785 --> 01:18:19,891
Hey, how do I get monitor
71 up on the big screen?

1061
01:18:20,055 --> 01:18:21,295
Coming up.

1062
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:26,432
They found a body.

1063
01:18:26,594 --> 01:18:29,131
They're pretty sure it's a woman,
and it's not Marta Shearing.

1064
01:18:29,297 --> 01:18:30,674
They found dog tags.

1065
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:32,470
They think she was shot.

1066
01:18:48,016 --> 01:18:49,290
Hey.

1067
01:18:49,451 --> 01:18:50,589
Hey.

1068
01:18:53,455 --> 01:18:55,332
Marta, I...

1069
01:18:57,158 --> 01:18:59,195
You can't call anyone.

1070
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:05,810
There are people that care about
you that think you're dead.

1071
01:19:05,967 --> 01:19:07,378
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

1072
01:19:07,535 --> 01:19:10,345
Anyone you contact
becomes a target.

1073
01:19:12,207 --> 01:19:16,986
So, you need to put aside any normal
emotional response that you have.

1074
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:22,826
The only edge we've got right now
is they think we're both gone.

1075
01:19:24,519 --> 01:19:25,520
All right?

1076
01:19:26,788 --> 01:19:28,392
All right.

1077
01:19:32,227 --> 01:19:33,968
So,

1078
01:19:34,028 --> 01:19:36,065
you're going to want
to go through this.

1079
01:19:46,474 --> 01:19:49,011
You know, just
be familiar with it.

1080
01:19:58,653 --> 01:20:00,257
June Monroe.

1081
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:02,697
Who is June Monroe?

1082
01:20:03,324 --> 01:20:04,860
You are.

1083
01:20:11,699 --> 01:20:14,236
Do you know her?

1084
01:20:18,573 --> 01:20:20,052
Not any more.

1085
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,190
Why do you have
to stay enhanced?

1086
01:20:32,287 --> 01:20:34,460
Why is it so important to you?

1087
01:20:41,329 --> 01:20:42,330
Come here.

1088
01:21:05,954 --> 01:21:07,262
What is this?

1089
01:21:07,422 --> 01:21:09,459
This was me.

1090
01:21:12,126 --> 01:21:13,571
Was.

1091
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:17,506
My army recruiter

1092
01:21:19,234 --> 01:21:20,542
was looking to make his quota.

1093
01:21:20,602 --> 01:21:22,411
He added 12 points to my IQ.

1094
01:21:26,608 --> 01:21:29,282
Twelve points to make
the minimum.

1095
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,630
You ever seen a cognitive
degrade, Marta?

1096
01:21:41,923 --> 01:21:44,631
Sensory withdrawal?
You ever do that?

1097
01:21:45,326 --> 01:21:48,603
Pull someone's blues and watch
them drop off their meds?

1098
01:21:48,763 --> 01:21:50,037
No.

1099
01:21:50,465 --> 01:21:53,810
Because they paint a pretty
graphic picture in training.

1100
01:21:56,604 --> 01:21:58,845
Hell of a long way to fall.

1101
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:05,021
If I can't keep it together,
we won't make it.

1102
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,828
They bit.
Who?

1103

Either she had a car waiting for
her, or somebody picked her up.

There are security cameras on the

Hartford, because she can get it.

I'm good, I'm good.

Welcome back.
Thanks.

1230
01:31:24,605 --> 01:31:27,017
I'm sorry. I just don't have
you on my list arriving.

1231
01:31:27,174 --> 01:31:29,120
That's because we had
to change our schedule.

1232
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:30,812
Yeah, we took
an earlier flight.

1233
01:31:30,978 --> 01:31:34,050
Joseph, I'm Dr. Brundage, by the way.
It's nice to meet you.

1234
01:31:34,215 --> 01:31:38,129
Pleased to meet you, too, but Dr. Pumaloy
is not here, he went to Singapore.

1235
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:39,355
He just left yesterday.

1236
01:31:39,887 --> 01:31:42,026
The girls have gone home.
No one told me anything.

1237
01:31:42,189 --> 01:31:44,499
Right. Well, I understand.

1238
01:31:44,658 --> 01:31:46,296
Well, look, we're going
to be here all week,

1239
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:47,737
and we have
a lot of work to do,

1240
01:31:47,862 --> 01:31:49,273
so we need to get
in there tonight

1241
01:31:49,330 --> 01:31:50,365
and get things started, okay?

1242
01:31:50,531 --> 01:31:52,169
Yeah, of course,
it's just that...

1243
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:53,971
You can call
Dr. Pumaloy if you want.

1244
01:31:54,034 --> 01:31:55,240
I just don't want to
put you on the spot.

1245
01:31:55,302 --> 01:31:57,509
No, we don't have to do that.

1246
01:31:57,805 --> 01:31:59,216
Okay, great.

1247
01:32:02,476 --> 01:32:04,319
It's just the two of you?

1248
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:05,650
Yeah.

1249
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:08,389
Yes, correct.

1250
01:32:08,516 --> 01:32:09,824
Correct.

1251
01:32:11,585 --> 01:32:12,859
Yes, I will hold.

1252
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,830
Get it up there. Put that
up on the big screen.

1253
01:32:17,191 --> 01:32:18,829
