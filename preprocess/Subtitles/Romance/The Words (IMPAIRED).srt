and perhaps even live well.

1114
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:42,019
Everyone has to sleep at night.

1115
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:48,025
What really happened, Clay,
after he tells himself all that?

1116
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:51,529
I just told you.
No, tell me the truth.

1117
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:56,951
He goes on. He lives,
he writes, as well as he can,

1118
01:30:57,119 --> 01:30:58,577
he's a big success.

1119
01:30:58,745 --> 01:31:00,246
Bullshit.

1120
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:03,833
I'm not talking about the book.
You're just avoiding.
Tell me the truth.

1121
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,668
What are you afraid of, Clay?

1122
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:07,628
Look, why don't you tell me?

1123
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:10,840
What?
I wanna know what you think.

1124
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:13,843
You're so smart, you got yourself in here,
you got me talking.

1125
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:17,763
Acting so precocious,
throwing your little ass around,

1126
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:20,474
quoting Shakespeare,
batting your eyelashes.

1127
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:22,852
Why don't you tell me?
I wanna know what you think.

1128
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:25,604
What happens to them?

1129
01:31:28,108 --> 01:31:30,860
I...
No, no, no.

1130
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:36,532
You tell me what happens to Rory
and Dora or you can get the hell out.

1131
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:54,341
He's fucked.

1132
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:09,398
Now go on.

1133
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:15,362
Maybe he can forget,
maybe he can write, create,

1134
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:18,199
but it doesn't matter
because he'll never, ever believe it.

1135
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:21,493
He's robbed himself
of the chance to find out.

1136
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:23,162
Not bad.

1137
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:26,207
Or maybe he can't write, although
he's been able to fool a few people.

1138
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:28,167
Even better.

1139
01:32:28,335 --> 01:32:31,378
Maybe his marriage falls apart
because for him and his wife
to look at one another

1140
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:33,255
is for them to look at the truth.

1141
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:35,466
Maybe when he goes in public,

1142
01:32:35,634 --> 01:32:38,844
he can wear that mask of confidence
and sophistication,

1143
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:42,014
but back when he's alone
late at night, he can't sleep,

1144
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:46,936
because when he closes his eyes
he still sees the face of that old man.

1145
01:32:53,652 --> 01:32:55,236
Maybe

1146
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:57,988
he sees his own face,

1147
01:32:58,198 --> 01:33:01,408
and the old man
is just a story he made up.

1148
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:08,415
Or maybe he finds himself in his
beautiful New York apartment

1149
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:12,670
overlooking the park, with a girl
who's much too young for him,

1150
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:17,007
and he's telling her what he knows
to be are tired old stories.

1151
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:23,055
Because for some reason she believes
that he has something to give her.

1152
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:33,482
You're very talented, Daniella.

1153
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:40,572
But at some point, you have to choose
between life and fiction.

1154
01:33:41,074 --> 01:33:45,160
The two are very close,
but they never actually touch.

1155
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:48,998
They're two very,
very different things.

1156

1157
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:12,730
What?

1158
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:14,773
What's wrong?

You don't want me?
No, no, no.

Look, it's not like you're corrupting
anything here.

1162
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:37,546
I want this. I want you.

1163
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:41,967
I, um....

1164
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:49,016
You should leave.

1165
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:58,692
Is that what you really want...

1166
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:01,028
Clay?

1167
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:07,201
What do you really want?
