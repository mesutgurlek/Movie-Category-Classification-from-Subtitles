1
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,459
(street traffic blaring)

2
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,327
(soft creaking)

3
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,997
(zipper zips)

4
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,212
(phone ringing)

5
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,254
(ringing continues)

6
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,753
(grunts)

7
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,627
Oh!

8
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,325
- Oh my God, oh my God.
- (beeps)

9
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,232
Automated voice: Hello.
No one is available to take your call.

10
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,566
Please leave a message
after the tone.

11
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,129
- (beeps)
- Woman: Sammy boy.

12
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,506
Big day today.
It's going to be great.

13
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,410
Will you call me after your meeting?
I need you to talk me down.

14
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,380
You're going to wear
the blue shirt, right?

15
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,542
Ugh, this happens to me
every time I host a party.

16
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,212
There's this moment beforehand
where I prepare myself to learn

17
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:03,017
that I'm not nearly as well-liked
as I thought I was.

18
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,184
Tuck tuck.
Don't forget to tuck.

19
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,660
Ugh, this is weird, Sam.

20
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,630
You've got to admit,
I'm having a weird party.

21
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,565
Okay, why am I still talking?
You're probably gone by now.

22
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,364
- (beeps)
- Oh look, you're calling me.

23
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,892
- Hello?
- This is bad.

24
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,235
- What? What happened?
- I overslept.

25
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,104
Sam, the meeting's not till 10:00.
You'll be fine.

26
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,133
Oh, I fear success.
Why do I fear success?

27
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,576
What are you talking about?

28
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,775
I went out last night trying to
fuck up my life and it worked.

29
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,646
Wait, before we get to you,
can you come early tonight?

30
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,173
I'm convinced no one's
going to show.

31
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,685
You're wrong,
but I'll get there early.

32
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,153
- When?
- First thing.

33
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,348
Oh, I fucked this up bad.

34
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,981
- I'm so fucked.
- Sam, breathe for me.

35
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,685
- Take deep breaths.
- Whew.

36
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,216
Good.
Now listen to me.

37
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,195
It's going to go amazing.
Because you know why?

38
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,787
- Why?
- Because it has to.

39
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,629
You're the voice of our generation.

40
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,465
- That's a lot of pressure.
- Sorry.

41
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,471
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

42
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,497
(folk rock music playing)

43
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,400
#Do I believe in this #

44
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:29,568
#Or is this the only way
to get around in my life? #

45
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,710
#Do I deserve this? #

46
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,375
#No, you deserve
much better #

47
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,817
#In your life #

48
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:43,845
#In your life #

49
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:55,295
#Thinking of you,
thinking of you #

50
00:03:55,335 --> 00:04:00,898
#So what can I do
when I'm thinking of you? #

51
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,779
#Do I believe in this #

52
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,916
#Or is this the only way
to get around in my life? #

53
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,025
#Do I deserve this? #

54
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:28,193
#No no, you deserve
much better in your life #

55
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:32,796
#In your life #

56
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:43,706
#Thinking of you,
thinking of you #

57
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,619
#So what can I do
when I'm thinking of you? #

58
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,648
#Thinking of you? #

59
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,489
Woman: Stop.

60
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,300
I said stop.

61
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,021
Man: Stopping 14th Street.
Next stop 23rd.

62
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,053
Stand clear of the closing doors.

63
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,819
(sniffles)

64
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,687
It's okay.
We'll just, um...

65
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,715
it'll be okay.

66
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,555
Uh, hey.

67
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,224
This... this kid got separated
from his mom on the train.

68
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,632
- So?
- So? I gotta... what do I do?

69
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,502
Well, take him to the police station...
21st and Third.

70
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,439
Thanks. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

71
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,466
(police sirens wailing)

72
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,241
Hey, what are you doing?
They're going to help you.

73
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,151
I gotta leave you here, dude.
I don't know what else to do with you.

74
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:32,624
Fuck!
Don't swear.

75
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,683
Do you know your address?

76
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,991
Come on, dude, help me out.
I am so late.

77
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:40,260
What's your name?
My name's Sam.

78
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,290
Look, I... I know it's not good
to talk to strangers,

79
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,860
but I'm clearly a good citizen
or something.

80
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,600
I'm trying to help you.

81
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,974
Subway's two blocks that way.

82
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,009
Good luck.

83
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,606
- (elevator dings)
- (phone rings)

84
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,633
Woman:
Smith-Crowley.

85
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,738
Hi. I am ridiculously late

86
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,340
for my meeting
with Paul Gertmanian.

87
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,318
- Your name?
- Sam Wexler.

88
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,343
Just take a seat.

89
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,961
- (phone rings)
- Smith-Crowley.

90
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,966
Hey, um, when I go in there,

91
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,998
would you mind
keeping an eye on him?

92
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,977
What's his name?

93
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,538
Ask him.
He likes to chat.

94
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,255
Paul: Susan speaks
very highly of you.

95
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,757
She told me, "The one thing
about Sam is he's always on time

96
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,919
for an important meeting."

97
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,553
(chuckles)

98
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,089
Well...

99
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,728
No, this is... this is tightly paced.
It's funny.

100
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,761
Engaging characters
that sound like real people.

101
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,296
It's...

102
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,969
But... how to put this?

103
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,739
Your protagonist Alan...

104
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,143
- Alex.
- Right.

105
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,047
I don't know if you want people
to love this guy or hate this guy.

106
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,052
He's kind of ambitious.
He's kind of mature.

107
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,954
He's kind of just kind of.
Novels are tricky, Sam.

108
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,981
Susan says your short stories
are wonderful.

109
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,617
But it seems to us
that you haven't

110
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,720
entirely adapted
to the longer form.

111
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,823
The novel requires a different kind
of commitment than the short story.

112
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,231
Excuse me for one second.

113
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,463
(huffs)

114
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,235
Hey hey!
Where are you going?

115
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,443
(thuds)

116
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:16,617
Ah. Question: who is he?

117
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,716
He's just, uh...

118
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,886
just a kid.

119
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,919
Thanks for coming in.

120
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,122
(elevator beeps)

121
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,738
- Receptionist: Bye, Rasheen.
- Bye.

122
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,608
- Rasheen: Where are we going?
- Toy store.

123
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,311
- Yes!
- Kidding.

124
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,286
We're getting you back home
and out of my hair.

125
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,017
You're not my responsibility.

126
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,618
Dude, come on.

127
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,291
(sighs)

128
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,596
Not cool, dude.
Not cool.

129
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,467
Hey, can we stop running?
I'm almost 30.

130
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:10,133
So look, you're obviously
having some family issues.

131
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:13,373
But whatever.
It's childhood. It ends.

132
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,471
Don't look at me like that.
You fucked... you screwed up

133
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,573
a very important meeting
for me back there.

134
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,084
I think I've been
more than accommodating.

135
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,745
Now come on.
We gotta get you home.

136
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,344
Your mom's probably
worried sick about you.

137
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,822
She's not my mom.

138
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,348
That woman on the train...
that wasn't your mom?

139
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,428
Were those your brothers
and sisters?

140
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,400
So... where's your mom?

141
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,199
Were you... what's going on?
Were you living with that woman?

142
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,633
Like in foster care?

143
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,973
(sighs)

144
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,145
Come on.

145
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,213
- I'm thirsty.
- Yeah, I know.

146
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,192
I'm taking you to the place
with the best water in the city.

147
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,189
Stay here.

148
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,667
Come here.
Come on.

149
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,872
Come on.

150
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,709
Good. Look cute.

151
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,514
Cuter. Come on.

152
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,748
There, that's it.

153
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,493
Hey!
Sorry, that was loud.

154
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,292
Didn't mean to scr...

155
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,821
- are you guys open?
- No, not yet.

156
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,460
Can, uh, he get
a glass of water?

157
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,935
Yeah sure.

158
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,368
- So who's this?
- He's my little brother.

159
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,402
Not my actual brother.

160
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,415
I'm his big brother like...

161
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,145
like Big Brother, Big Sister
kind of thing, you know?

162
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,585
- That's great. Good for you.
- Yeah yeah.

163
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,054
Good deeds.
Good deeds.

164
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,389
It's nice to know there are still
good men in the world.

165
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:11,260
- They're hard to find.
- That's what Flannery said, right?

166
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,363
- So, uh, what's your name?
- Mississippi.

167
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,965
- That's your real name?
- It's what everyone calls me.

168
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,634
I'm assuming it's also
where you're from?

169
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,166
Yes, sir.

170
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,076
Wow, what are the odds
of that, right?

171
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,740
(both laugh)

172
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,443
So great.
You're... you're here a lot?

173
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,146
Sadly, yes.

174
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,677
Okay, that's enough.
Say thank you for the water.

175
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,190
- Thank you for the water.
- Oh, look at that.

176
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,250
You're welcome.

177
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,591
Great, so we're going to...
we gotta...

178
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,494
(clicks tongue)

179
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,932
But... come on.
It was great meeting you.

180
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,903
I'll come back here
and, you know,

181
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,929
drink your alcohol
at some point.

182
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,374
- That'd be nice.
- Great.

183
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,777
- I'm Sam.
- Hi, Sam.

184
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,416
(folk music playing)

185
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,789
- Sam: You hungry?
- Yeah.

186
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,732
All right.

187
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,133
Let's get a little snack.

188
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,472
Then we'll get you back home.

189
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,575
#Hobos and tacos
and broken down Hondas... #

190
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,277
- Why can't I stay here?
- You can't stay here.

191
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,309
- Why not?
- Because you can't.

192
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,981
- Why can't I?
- Because I said so.

193
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,651
- I wanna stay here.
- You've made that very clear.

194
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:47,716
You can't stay here.

195
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,227
- Please?
- No.

196
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,319
- Please?
- No.

197
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,351
- Please?
- No.

198
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,421
- Please?
- No.

199
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,728
- I really wanna stay here.
- Ahh.

200
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,530
- We'll have fun.
- I can't hear you.

201
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,093
- Please?
- I can't hear you.

202
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,434
- Please?
- I can't hear you.

203
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,770
#Palm trees, exposed knees,
I punched Mickey Rourke #

204
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:07,973
#But I miss New York. #

205
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,406
(car horn honks)

206
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,620
Fuck!
Don't swear.

207
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,485
Let's go.

208
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,990
(muffled music playing)

209
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,222
Look at the time.

210
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,356
Oh, early meaning late.

211
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,696
- I am so sorry.
- I forgive you. Get in here.

212
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,827
Wait, this is Rasheen.

213
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,397
Oh. Okay.

214
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,878
- Hi, Rasheen. I'm Annie.
- Hi.

215
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,777
You'll explain later?

216
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,406
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

217
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,246
Oh, how was the meeting?

218
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,412
Okay, we'll talk.
Go get drunk.

219
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,445
None for the kid.

220
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,785
- Man: Hey, Sam.
- Hey, what's up?

221
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,728
- Hey.
- Hi.

222
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,192
- Can I have a cookie?
- Dude, it's a party.

223
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,329
You can have, like, 10 cookies.

224
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,363
Go crazy.

225
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,200
- Hey.
- Hi.

226
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,907
- What the fuck?
- Come on. Child.

227
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,939
Rasheen, this is my cousin
Mary Catherine.

228
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,747
We're not really cousins.
Parents... best friends.

229
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,983
Look, he's riveted.
What's going on?

230
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,014
I'm just... you know,
I'm looking after him for a while.

231
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,356
And you thought,
"I know what kids love...

232
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,952
alopecia awareness parties."

233
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,656
Kind of.
How are you?

234
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,858
- Horrible.
- Nice. Where's Charlie?

235
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,367
He's in LA.
He's back tomorrow.

236
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:40,463
- I like that Charlie.
- So do I. I'm a mess without him.

237
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,672
This is fishy. Why do you have
a small child with you, Sam?

238
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,110
We're going to mingle.
It was great to see you.

239
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,205
I'm calling you tomorrow.

240
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,085
Annie: Okay, I promise
this won't take long.

241
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,952
It's actually just
an excuse to get drunk

242
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,855
with the people that I love.

243
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:04,158
So as a little extra dash of fun,
whenever anyone says...

244
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,790
oh I don't know..."follicle,"
we could all drink.

245
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,732
- (laughter)
- Follicle!

246
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,463
(all cheering)

247
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:15,872
Okay, now the first thing

248
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,900
most people notice about me
is that I am hot.

249
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:22,072
- Man: Whoo!
- Yes! That is correct.

250
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,672
I am superhot.

251
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:28,119
I am also, in addition
to being superdrunk, hairless.

252
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,644
And unlike some of the hot
gay men here, I do not wax.

253
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:33,055
I have a very awesome
autoimmune disorder

254
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,892
that we're all going
to learn about right now.

255
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,726
The word "alopecia"
comes from the Greek...

256
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,164
- (cell phone ringing)
- (people giggling)

257
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,862
Uh, could everyone please
turn off their cell phones?

258
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,700
- I'm really sorry.
- Annie: What?

259
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,536
- I am so so so sorry.
- What? That is so rude.

260
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,338
- (thumps)
- (laughter)

261
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,402
I need a drink.
Follicle.

262
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,606
Crowd: Whoo!

263
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,638
- Hey.
- Charlie: Oh my God, baby,

264
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,777
I wish you were here
with me right now.

265
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,982
I got Dave's jeep
and I'm driving on the PCH

266
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,321
and the sun is about to set.

267
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,656
It is fucking unbelievable!

268
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,322
- How's Dave doing?
- Dave is amazing!

269
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,493
You know I haven't encountered
a single mosquito since I've been here?

270
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,559
It's like a no-mosquito zone.

271
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,468
They're outlawed or something.

272
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,838
Charlie, come home right now.
I miss you.

273
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,276
Huh? Oh, baby,
you're breaking up.

274
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,974
Charlie? Charlie?

275
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,415
Annie:
No, one more fun fact.

276
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:36,114
- Wait, is everyone having fun?
- Crowd: Yeah! Whoo!

277
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,350
...how much things cost.
- Every time.

278
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,723
- Hey, thanks.
- Bye. Thanks for coming.

279
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,354
- Great party.
- Both: Mwah!

280
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,886
I never noticed
you didn't have hair.

281
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,126
- Really? I never mentioned it?
- No.

282
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,294
- Love you.
- Love you too.

283
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:54,465
#Remind me again
just what you were saying #

284
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,408
#When you walked in the room
when the music was playing #

285
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,639
#When I was lost too #

286
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,412
#But in my own thoughts
and I could not find you #

287
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:10,518
#Tell me your story,
I'm listening this time #

288
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,547
- # I can get us some glasses... #
- Thanks.

289
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,149
#And a bottle of wine #

290
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,718
#We can sit on the carpet #

291
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:22,029
#Sit on the table
or sit on the moon #

292
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:26,197
#You can reach for my hand,
you can say what you like #

293
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,105
#Or just what you can't stand #

294
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:32,838
- # Be a boy or a little old man... #
- (sighs)

295
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,937
#Be what you want,
even nothing... #

296
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,675
- Say cheese.
- (camera shutter clicks)

297
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,649
Ah.
(laughs)

298
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,481
Don't worry.
I'll destroy that.

299
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,350
Here, let me try this.

300
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,617
(grunts)
There.

301
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,349
Did you have a rough night?

302
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,220
I got a question.

303
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,699
Um... why aren't we better friends?

304
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,196
Um, I wasn't aware
we were friends.

305
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:04,266
Oh, I... I think we would
get along really well.

306
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,300
Well...

307
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:12,914
my best friend's name
is Sam, Sam.

308
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:17,786
I mean, seriously,
how many Sams

309
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,450
can a girl have in her life?

310
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,958
Well, you can call me Sam 2.

311
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,689
(laughs)
Sounds like a sequel.

312
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,924
(dramatic voice)
"In a world of Sams,

313
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,592
Sam 2 is so much better."

314
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,628
Oh, that was cheesy.
May I?

315
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,681
Help me out with
something here, Sam #2.

316
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:55,284
- You work in legal, right?
- Yes, I do. Yes.

317
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,490
- Seventh floor.
- Mm-hmm.

318
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,658
Why are you always
lurking around down here?

319
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,498
Oh, come on, everybody knows
the party's on five.

320
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,937
Philanthropic giving!
Whoohoo!

321
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,204
(laughing)

322
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,872
- Annie: Oh God.
- Oh.

323
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,006
- Can you...
- (camera shutter clicks)

324
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,610
Oh, that's good.
That was a good one.

325
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,280
- One...
- (camera shutter clicks)

326
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,813
Got it.
(giggles)

327
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,593
Annie:
Oh my God.

328
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,486
Sorry.
Here, sit.

329
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,162
Listen, they're going
to deal with you,

330
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,033
get you back home
or wherever.

331
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,867
If they ask any questions,

332
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,806
um, just tell them you've been
walking around or something.

333
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,207
You know, don't...
don't mention my name.

334
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,702
I don't want to get
in any trouble.

335
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,215
It was nice meeting you.

336
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,554
(faucet running)

337
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,228
So Dave thinks he's going to get
this thing off the ground.

338
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,935
- Mary Catherine: That's great.
- Yeah.

339
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,705
He was the happiest
I've seen him in a long time.

340
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,407
- (faucet stops)
- LA seems to agree with him.

341
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,642
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

342
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,551
He says he doesn't
miss New York at all.

343
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,420
I knew he'd bail.

344
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,551
He was always way too much of a wimp
to stay here forever.

345
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,585
- Do you want to know what I want?
- Hmm?

346
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,497
- An omelet.
- Oh, wait. I'm just curious.

347
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:45,799
Why do you hate
Los Angeles so much?

348
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,101
Because it's the epicenter
of all that is awful.

349
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,042
- Wait.
- Feed me.

350
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,047
Dave told me this awesome thing
about LA. No, listen.

351
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:59,244
He says the whole town
is like this blank canvas,

352
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:03,243
and whatever you bring to it...
that's what it is.

353
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:06,553
It's just this random collection
of neighborhoods where it's always sunny

354
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:10,550
and it basically reflects
wherever you're at back at you.

355
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,029
So if you're happy, LA is great.

356
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,090
If you're not, LA sucks.

357
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,601
But it has nothing to do
with Los Angeles

358
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,537
because... get this...

359
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,767
there's no such thing.

360
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,434
And?

361
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,606
And that's it.

362
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:35,750
If you don't feed me soon,
I'm going to eat your face.

363
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,778
Let's go.

364
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,532
Okay, what's going on?

365
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,935
Dave said what?

366
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:57,840
He wants to partner
with me, 50/50.

367
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,970
But...

368
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:04,812
we'd have to be out there.

369
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,448
When?

370
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,547
End of the month.

371
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,581
And you want to do it?

372
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:44,021
What I'm missing, I think,
is a great subject.

373
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:48,048
Like... like the novel,
that which is new, you know?

374
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,859
Where's my...
what do I draw upon?

375
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,431
- I don't know.
- Exactly.

376
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,526
I mean my great shame
as a writer

377
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:01,232
is that I'm just this suburban kid
with good parents.

378
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,970
You know,
I was fed, clothed,

379
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,002
carpooled...
hardly Dickensian.

380
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,514
- You know what I'm saying?
- Totally.

381
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,143
I mean you...
with your situation...

382
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,675
(clicks tongue)
That's a gold mine.

383
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,415
You got, like, tons of material

384
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,017
all at the ripe old age
of whatever.

385
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,926
How old are you anyway?

386
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,362
I don't know.

387
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,059
You don't know how old you are?

388
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,830
When's your birthday?

389
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,635
(sighs)

390
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,216
What are you so afraid of?

391
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,984
I'm afraid my brain
is going to melt.

392
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:57,051
I'm afraid we will never
walk anywhere ever again.

393
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:00,690
I'm afraid we won't care
about things anymore

394
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:04,133
except opening
weekend grosses

395
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,899
and Pilates classes.

396
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:10,430
Yeah, but you know they'd be,
like, the best Pilates classes.

397
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,636
There's no art there.

398
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,975
- That's ridiculous.
- They have no culture.

399
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,844
New York has everything...

400
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:20,113
the best restaurants,
best theater, museums...

401
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,949
Right, and how many museums
do you go to in an average week?

402
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,615
- I'm just curious.
- That is not the point.

403
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,021
- Yes, that is the point.
- Not the point.

404
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,547
I mean, what good is paying
out the nose to live here

405
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,184
if we never
take advantage of it?

406
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,889
We might as well live somewhere else
and just visit every once in a while

407
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,420
and actually do things.

408
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:36,059
You know, hit the Met,
take in a Broadway show,

409
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,830
Carnegie Deli.

410
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,269
"Wow, that's a really big sandwich.

411
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,705
- I don't know if I can eat all that."
- I love New York.

412
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,299
You're miserable more than not.

413
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,402
Yes, but that is not
New York's fault.

414
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,473
New York is...

415
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,010
Charlie: What?

416
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,790
...home.

417
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:03,089
You're asking me to leave home.

418
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,333
You know this is my job,
don't you?

419
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,068
I have to sit here and write things.

420
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,508
It's... it's not easy
with you staring at me.

421
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:33,620
Sorry I don't have a television.

422
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,416
What's your thing?
What do you like?

423
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,861
You like art, huh?
You like to draw?

424
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,229
Really?

425
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,869
Here, draw yourself a television.

426
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,895
(folk rock music playing)

427
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:00,507
#So I have under two minutes
to sing you this song #

428
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,578
#It's quite the challenge actually
because I've loved you so long #

429
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,523
#And I know I'm always writing
so you think I'm good with words #

430
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,652
#But I can hardly express
how I feel #

431
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,595
#'Cause words aren't why
love is real #

432
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,590
#And I don't know why
I love you, I just do #

433
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,196
#There was a message in a bottle
at the bottom of the sea #

434
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,333
#Somebody mistook rock
for paper accidenta-dentally #

435
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:27,243
#So their letter never made it
to the lover they adore #

436
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,247
#I had to fish it
from the ocean floor #

437
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:33,375
#And I know you won't believe me,
but I swear to God it's true #

438
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,182
#The letter said "I love you,
but I don't know why I do" #

439
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,281
#That's exactly when it hit me,
that's exactly how I feel #

440
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,623
#'Cause though
my love is real... #

441
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,390
Sam:
Amazing, right?

442
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:45,953
Annie: Are you sure
you don't like these

443
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,862
just because they're
a lot of pictures of you?

444
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,389
No.

445
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,801
But I do look
incredibly handsome

446
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,361
in this one.

447
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,964
Look at me.

448
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,237
I'm like a dashing
Russian aristocrat.

449
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,903
Annie: Oh.

450
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,444
Annie: What do you think
was going on?

451
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,506
I don't know.
Something bad.

452
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,984
He says he won't go back.

453
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:12,853
Well, he's supercute.
I say we keep him.

454
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,382
I'm kidding.
We can't keep him.

455
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:18,555
- Sam, don't keep him.
- I'm not keeping him.

456
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,587
Calm down.

457
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:35,009
Sorry about the ball.
It's all I got.

458
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,316
(cell phone ringing)

459
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,650
Hello?

460
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,228
Okay.

461
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,666
No, it's not like I didn't
see this one coming.

462
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,903
So that's the last of them, huh?

463
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:08,307
No, I'm, uh... I'm fine.
Thanks.

464
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,015
- (grunts)
- (leaves rustle)

465
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,025
Charlie: Did you know that my three
most financially successful years

466
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,662
in New York City
were when I was dealing pot?

467
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,474
You don't need Dave
or some crappy town

468
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,999
to do something great.

469
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:42,877
- I believe in you.
- Why?

470
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,542
'Cause you're my man.

471
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:49,144
You're my big, funny,
floppy-haired man.

472
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:54,055
We don't need to know everything
in advance, okay?

473
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:58,461
You'll figure out your thing
and we'll have money eventually.

474
00:29:58,496 --> 00:29:59,986
That's how it works.

475
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,431
No, not here.

476
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,162
Not always.

477
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,933
I just want to feel like the crap
I put myself through is...

478
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,775
I don't know.

479
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,872
Woman: No no, yeah, I did.
I called him yesterday.

480
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,978
I'm just tired.

481
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,927
- Both: Oh.
- Sorry.

482
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:37,264
So I'm... I'm generally not
a happy hour kind of guy,

483
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:40,999
- but I thought you might like...
- Oh, uh, yeah sorry. I can't.

484
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,700
- It's a school night.
- Oh, yeah.

485
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,731
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

486
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:48,041
Oh. Two ships, two ships.

487
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,240
- Hey, Beth.
- Hey.

488
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,208
(cell phone chimes)

489
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,411
(door opens, closes)

490
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,446
(rock music playing)

491
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,867
- What?
- What do you mean?

492
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,602
Why did you want
to see me so bad?

493
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,633
I just... does there have
to be a reason?

494
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,711
I don't know.

495
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,682
I still...

496
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,111
Whatever.
It's just been a while.

497
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:06,487
Have a drink with me.
Please?

498
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,396
(rock music playing)

499
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,943
- She hated me.
- Not true.

500
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,888
- She hated me.
- She didn't hate you.

501
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,618
She just thought
you needed a haircut.

502
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,717
Yeah well, I couldn't have been
nicer to that woman.

503
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,060
I... I brought her flowers.
I even tucked my shirt in.

504
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,532
Wow, shocking that
that didn't win her over.

505
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,797
- Nothing would have.
- I'm her daughter.

506
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,428
She didn't want me to get hurt.

507
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,031
But I guess in fairness, you know,
she was wrong about you.

508
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,599
Oh no, wait.
She was totally right.

509
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,976
- Come on.
- Mothers are always right.

510
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,674
I fuckin' hate that.

511
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:10,544
I can handle your mother
hating me.

512
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,022
I can't stand the thought
that you hate me.

513
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:28,072
- Hey.
- Hey.

514
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:31,269
- You're back.
- A man of my word.

515
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,300
- Mississippi.
- Sam.

516
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:39,112
- M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I?
- Very good.

517
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,380
- How's your little brother?
- Who?

518
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,512
- The kid?
- Oh, good.

519
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,044
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
He's good.

520
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,249
Well, it's great that you do that.

521
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,952
You know, you're...
you're really good at your job.

522
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,893
- Am I?
- Yeah, I've been...

523
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,919
I've been watching you
do your thing.

524
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,432
- You're good.
- Wow.

525
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,696
I must be a really good actress

526
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,999
because I fucking hate my job.

527
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,699
- You're an actress?
- No.

528
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:02,967
What do you do
when you're not here?

529
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,305
- I sing.
- Sing? Songs?

530
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:09,211
- Yeah, songs. Cabaret.
- Ah.

531
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,511
- What do you do?
- I write.

532
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,575
- Words?
- Yeah, words.

533
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,846
So you sing.
Are you... you any good?

534
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,188
Well, you come listen
and then tell me.

535
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,659
No, I... I could never
come hear you sing.

536
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:26,822
- Why not?
- Because I like you.

537
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,456
That makes no sense.

538
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,702
You happy to see me?

539
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,735
I don't know yet.

540
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,387
(Annie laughs)

541
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,482
This is bad.

542
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,789
I have to work in the morning.

543
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,524
- Some people work.
- Hey, I work.

544
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,328
Playing bass in a shitty band

545
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:05,893
and considering applying
to grad school is not a job.

546
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,598
You think the band is shitty?

547
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,309
Well, you were front row
at every show.

548
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,334
I was your girlfriend.

549
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:18,337
That, like, contractually obligated me
to be a groupie.

550
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:21,977
Yeah, but you always...

551
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,113
you just looked like you were
enjoying yourself, that's all.

552
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,031
I was.

553
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,057
I did.

554
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,008
All right, let's do this.
Tell me things.

555
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,738
When, Mississippi,
did you leave Mississippi

556
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,109
and come to New York City?

557
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,671
- When I was 17.
- Oh great.

558
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,307
So you've been here,
what, two years?

559
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,581
- Aw, nice.
- Ooh wait, where's your accent?

560
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,178
Oh, it's here...

561
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,451
(Southern accent)
when I need it.

562
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,787
- Drink this.
- (glass thuds)

563
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,692
Yes, ma'am.
Cheers.

564
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,719
Mm!

565
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,424
What the fuck, man?

566
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,228
Why won't you come
hear me sing?

567
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,758
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

568
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,702
Because I once dated
this girl in college

569
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,228
who desperately wanted
to be an actress.

570
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:16,797
I mean it was all she talked about.

571
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,901
And I finally went
to see her in this play.

572
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,104
Bad?

573
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:25,013
So unburdened with talent
it was amazing.

574
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:28,109
- I mean I had to break up with her.
- Because she was a bad actress?

575
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,642
No, I didn't care
if she was good or not.

576
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,315
It was... she so believed she was good
and it made me feel like,

577
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:36,053
wow, this girl doesn't
know herself at all.

578
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:39,221
And I think you're terrific.
I do.

579
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:40,753
Therefore, I could never
come hear you sing

580
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,732
because it'll change everything
if I learn you can't.

581
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,598
- What if I'm amazing?
- What if you aren't?

582
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,967
- What if you suck as a writer?
- I don't.

583
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:50,940
Whoa, you are bad news.

584
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,940
Sammy, I'm calling you
because you're my sponsor

585
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,180
and I'm about to fall
off the wagon.

586
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,156
It happens, right?
Don't be mad.

587
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,351
Okay, I'm going to take
your not picking up to mean

588
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,587
that the universe wants me
to fuck up badly right now.

589
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:13,028
I'll call you tomorrow
and confess.

590
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,196
(sighs)

591
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,733
Fuck!

592
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,023
What's wrong?

593
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:50,466
- I got bad news today.
- What?

594
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,163
I'm a fuckin' failure.

595
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,865
Aw.

596
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:58,636
Fuck, I was impressive once.

597
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,338
I'm telling you,

598
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:04,473
parent-teacher conferences
back in the day...

599
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,506
I was unstoppable.

600
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,848
- Little Sammy Wexler.
- I'll bet you were.

601
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,376
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

602
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,895
It's okay to not
say anything, right?

603
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:26,767
I always want to...
I always want to talk.

604
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,433
I don't always have to be talking.

605
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,174
You gotta stop me
because I'm just gonna keep...

606
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:38,545
I'm just gonna keep going.
I don't know how those things...

607
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,000
Shh.

608
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,401
(laughing)

609
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,740
(both moaning)

610
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,768
This way. Come.

611
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,303
Wait wait, shh!

612
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,181
Listen, there might be
a small black child

613
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,980
sleeping on my couch,
so we have to be quiet.

614
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,509
Might?

615
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,044
There's definitely
a small black child

616
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,613
sleeping on my couch,
so we have to be quiet.

617
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,955
Okay.

618
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:24,324
Shh shh!

619
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,762
- Look look, it's my bedroom.
- Oh.

620
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,527
- How nice is it in here?
- Amazing.

621
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:36,035
- Hey.
- Hey. What?

622
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,633
- I'm not going to sleep with you.
- Sure you are.

623
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,635
- No, I can't.
- Come on, that's defeatist.

624
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,807
You can do anything
you set your mind to.

625
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,817
(laughing)
Ow!

626
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,409
- Shh!
- Ah.

627
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:51,114
- The children.
- Oh.

628
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,156
- Does he stay with you a lot?
- Well, occasionally.

629
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,525
You know, rough home life.

630
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,497
Sam, I'm serious.
I'm not going to sleep with you.

631
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,022
(groans)

632
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,830
Does this have something
to do with Jesus?

633
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,770
- Is that what this is?
- No.

634
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,933
- I made a New Year's resolution.
- To what?

635
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,535
To not be such a whore.

636
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,137
How's that been going for you?

637
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,205
Well...

638
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,683
- Come on.
- No no no no, I barely know you.

639
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,278
All I know is you've got all these
sort of idiotic theories, okay?

640
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,982
I'm not going to spend
the night with you.

641
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,992
Okay, fine. I don't...

642
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,017
I don't think you should spend
the night with me either.

643
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,996
You don't?

644
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,499
I think you should spend
the next three nights with me.

645
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:40,231
- What?
- I'm serious!

646
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,102
Stay with me.
Three days.

647
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,403
I've got an extra set of keys.
You come and go as you please.

648
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,740
I knew that last shot
was a bad idea.

649
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,836
What? Come on.
This will be awesome.

650
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:53,145
Look, I totally agree...
one-night stands are the worst.

651
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,175
So you want to have
a three-night stand?

652
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,379
Yeah.

653
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,978
What is this,
like your line or something?

654
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,751
No.

655
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,156
You've said that
to other girls before!

656
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:05,321
I've never even thought this before,
but it's totally genius, isn't it?

657
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:08,092
No, it's like the worst idea ever.

658
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,568
Hey hey hey, you stay here
for three days.

659
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,729
Who knows what could happen?

660
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,363
We sleep together once...
let's be honest,

661
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,567
the odds are I'm never
gonna call you.

662
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,599
You just said that out loud.

663
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,804
Come on. Come on!

664
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,246
- No way.
- Move in with me for three days.

665
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,772
My mother warned me
about guys like you.

666
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:30,719
Seriously.
It'll be an adventure, huh?

667
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,585
We'll cook.

668
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,217
We'll make
obscene amounts of love.

669
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,386
We'll play with the adorable kid
on the couch

670
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,726
out there in the living room.

671
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,323
Is this for real?

672
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,493
- Yeah.
- We just met.

673
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,231
- Isn't it going to be awkward?
- Yeah.

674
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:52,273
This is... you're not going
to want me here for three days.

675
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,607
Yes, I will. I do.
I wouldn't be asking you if I didn't.

676
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,203
Yeah, now you do
because you're drunk.

677
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,839
Are you going to be drunk
for three days?

678
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,316
- Possibly.
- You're crazy.

679
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,978
You're going to move in
with me for three days.

680
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,317
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

681
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,255
Making it official.

682
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,815
- Paperwork. Terms.
- (pen scratching)

683
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,918
Hey.

684
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,485
I don't get to weigh in
on the terms?

685
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,658
(pen scratching)

686
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,362
Okay, fine.
What are your terms?

687
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:23,134
If I'm going to stay here
with you for three days

688
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,971
I need you to be nice.

689
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,774
Okay.

690
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,803
But I'm going to need you
to be naked.

691
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,248
Sam...

692
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,313
I've been feeling
a little fragile these days.

693
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,785
I need you to be nice.

694
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,421
Okay.

695
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,561
Sign it.

696
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,486
#By the time you get
the postcard #

697
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:17,016
#I'll say I didn't mean
the things I said #

698
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,586
#The time you wanna
touch me #

699
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:24,329
#I'll say I didn't really read
the books I said I read #

700
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:27,701
#Go ahead, ring the doorbell,
I'll answer the door #

701
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:30,070
- # But what do you wanna talk... #
- (door slams)

702
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,597
#To me... #
- (Mary Catherine vomiting)

703
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:34,975
#40 hours ago
I was feelin' one way #

704
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,072
#Now I'm feeling another #

705
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:42,415
#Is there supposed to be
one thing to latch onto? #

706
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:47,117
#I'm feelin' echo and blue
silhouettes upon my shoe #

707
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:50,024
#Of the person
I once really knew... #

708
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,119
Hey.

709
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,630
We should do this again
sometime.

710
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:58,931
- You think?
- Yeah, like a lot.

711
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:02,132
Yeah, 'cause that always
works out great.

712
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,935
Come on.

713
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,408
Ira, why would I torture myself?

714
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:09,173
- Come here.
- I have to go.

715
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:12,808
You can be 45 seconds
late for work.

716
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,579
(sighs)

717
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:35,099
You're worried you're going
to get hurt, right?

718
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:38,540
But aren't we past all that?
We're great together.

719
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:40,600
We should just...

720
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:45,878
It's a bad idea.

721
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,851
Look...

722
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,320
I'm kind of seeing someone

723
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:55,985
which I...
I think makes this safe

724
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,757
because we can't get too into it,
which was the problem last time.

725
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:02,027
But we're not exclusive,

726
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:06,662
so you and I can still,
you know, whatever.

727
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,538
Ann.

728
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,237
(huffs)

729
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:18,976
Always making me the bad guy.

730
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,506
(sighs)

731
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,987
(crying)

732
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,534
5206?

733
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,162
Sam: 5208.

734
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,104
- Damn it.
- What?

735
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,471
I thought I had
another set of keys.

736
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,533
- Are you working tonight?
- I'm singing.

737
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:50,707
- Oh great. Where?
- I go on at 10:00.

738
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,739
What time are you done?

739
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,041
Okay, great.

740
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:59,783
So, um, I gotta get some keys made
and I'll call you after.

741
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:05,757
- Bye.
- Bye.

742
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:16,801
(sighs)

743
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,635
Sam: Hey.

744
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:23,145
- Did that girl leave?
- Yeah.

745
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:32,518
- Did she say anything?
- Nope.

746
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,046
You like French toast?

747
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,649
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

748
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:38,525
All right, let's make some.
Come on.

749
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,860
We'll get all Kramer v. Kramer.

750
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,306
Hey.

751
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,438
You okay?

752
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,608
(voice breaks)
Yeah, totally.

753
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,777
Can I, uh... can I...
can I do anything for you?

754
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,514
(sniffles)
Nope.

755
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,986
- Weren't you wearing that yesterday?
- Please go away.

756
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:09,219
Sure, yeah.

757
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,749
(sniffles)

758
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:15,288
Ugh! He's a fucking 29-year-old
12-year-old.

759
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,129
That's what he is.
That's all I meet.

760
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:21,069
If there's a 29-year-old 12-year-old
within 100' of me,

761
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:24,562
I will find that motherfucker
and I will sleep with him.

762
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,542
It's my one gift.

763
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:30,206
And they never call.
They just text... all of them!

764
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:32,374
"Hey, what's going on?
I haven't seen you in a while.

765
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:35,874
You wanna come over and fuck?"
"Well, fuck you!"

766
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,678
(groans)

767
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:46,058
I'm so sick of optimism.

768
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,997
It's fucking exhausting.

769
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:52,591
Listen.

770
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:58,430
Why do you give a shit
what people like Ira think of you?

771
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:00,340
Ira...
(spits)

772
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,140
You should give a shit
what people like me think of you.

773
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:05,671
And I think you're one of the greats.
I always have.

774
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,014
Everyone who loves you
thinks that, okay?

775
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,575
- Okay?
- I love you, Sam.

776
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,612
Are you listening to me?
I love you too.

777
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:16,649
- Now get out there and...
- Oh. And get 'em.

778
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,752
...philanthropic give.

779
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:24,328
That was an uplifting lunch hour.

780
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,996
We're dealing
with the kid thing tonight.

781
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:31,496
- This is getting ridiculous.
- Okay.

782
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:34,635
Hey, Ann.

783
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:38,307
You don't have to
keep it together all the time.

784
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:43,479
Yeah, the world will love a bald girl
who can't stop crying.

785
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,292
Bye.

786
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,226
You know, I'm not crazy
about that shirt.

787
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,668
- Why?
- I'm your boyfriend.

788
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,366
That makes me down.
I don't want to be down.

789
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:06,843
- It's not about you.
- Who else are you dating?

790
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:09,846
It's just nothing.
Who cares?

791
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,876
Yeah well, what about the one
that says "I love nerds"?

792
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,216
- I do love nerds.
- Well, it makes me feel weird.

793
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,155
Well, Chuck, if you find
the "My man's a hot stud" t-shirt,

794
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,658
Christmas is right around
the corner.

795
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:26,129
I just don't know what you're trying
to announce, that's all.

796
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,199
(Charlie laughs)

797
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,168
That's perfect.

798
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:36,172
Are you going to throw a jacket
down over that or what?

799
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,506
Grumpy.

800
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:45,142
Okay, this... awesome.

801
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,446
And you know the Clash?

802
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,611
Dude, you don't know
the Clash?

803
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,554
I have so much to teach you.

804
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:56,958
(cell phone vibrating)

805
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,825
(exhales)

806
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:00,227
(vibrating stops)

807
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,163
Hi, Sam.
It's Mississippi.

808
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:07,728
Remember me?
The girl from last night?

809
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:12,868
Um, just wanted to remind you
I go on at 10:00 tonight.

810
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,469
I... I promise not to suck.

811
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,072
No pressure.

812
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,549
I never heard from you
about the keys, so...

813
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:23,747
I don't know.
I'll see you later, I guess.

814
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,584
Okay, bye.

815
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:32,193
#What are you so afraid of? #

816
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,595
#Why are you feeling scared? #

817
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:37,930
#What's the worst
that's gonna happen? #

818
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,503
#Standing in the moonlight #

819
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:47,442
#I can tell you feel doomed
though nothing is wrong #

820
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,809
#No, nothing #

821
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:55,648
#You say maybe a crane
will fall from the sky #

822
00:50:55,685 --> 00:51:00,145
#Maybe a dove will dive #

823
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:07,062
#And die before your eye #

824
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,358
#It's too early to say #

825
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:17,806
#It's too early
to say good night #

826
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,833
#Good night #

827
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,277
#It's too early to read #

828
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:29,309
#It's too early to read
by the firelight #

829
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,388
#What are you so afraid of? #

830
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,655
#Why are you feeling scared? #

831
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,891
#What's the worst
that's gonna happen? #

832
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:47,393
#Standing in the meadow
with sunlight in your eye #

833
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:52,397
#And a sense
of so much sorrow #

834
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:58,039
#You say maybe a plane
will fall from the sky #

835
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:02,450
#Maybe a lover will lie #

836
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:09,483
#And die before your eye #

837
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,656
#It's too early to say #

838
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:19,829
#It's too early
to say good night #

839
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,964
#Good night #

840
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,065
#It's too early to read #

841
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:31,343
#It's too early to read
by the firelight #

842
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,351
#It's too early to say #

843
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:39,583
#It's too early
to say good night #

844
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:42,615
#Good night #

845
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,025
#It's too early to read #

846
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:51,296
#It's too early to read
by the firelight. #

847
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:56,067
(vocalizing)

848
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:11,083
Hi.

849
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:13,112
Hi.

850
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,789
I'm here.

851
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:21,285
I can see that.

852
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:24,425
I don't know why exactly.

853
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,731
You didn't want to get sued.

854
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,795
Right?

855
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,708
Oh.

856
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:37,941
- Hi.
- Hi.

857
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,619
So I just had a little talk
with Rasheen.

858
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:47,818
I asked about you being
his big brother.

859
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,552
He had no idea
what I was talking about.

860
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,720
Okay. Okay, wait.

861
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:55,162
He said you met on the subway.
What the fuck is going on?

862
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:56,790
Hold... hold... hold... hold on.
Hold on.

863
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,858
- Just wait.
- Who is he? Why is he here?

864
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,633
He got separated from his...
he had nowhere else to go.

865
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,003
- How old is he?
- I don't know.

866
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,838
- He doesn't know either.
- And...

867
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:08,366
oh my God,
do you like little boys?

868
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:11,471
What? No!
He's... he's in foster care, okay?

869
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:13,448
He's been in seven
foster homes in his life.

870
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:16,384
I... I think something was going on.
He says he won't go back.

871
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,979
- Why didn't you go to the police?
- I did!

872
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,183
Look, I... I realize
I'm in some trouble here,

873
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,316
but I don't know what else to do.

874
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:25,226
I'm just... I'm letting him stay here
until I can figure something out.

875
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,720
- How long has he been here?
- Three, four days.

876
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:33,259
You find a child on the subway
and you think you can just...

877
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:35,737
just keep him here without letting
anyone know where he is?

878
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,831
- That's...
- And you left him here

879
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,364
while you were out
the other night.

880
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,809
No, he was fine.
I... I put on some Leonard Cohen.

881
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,836
He just knocked him right out.

882
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:49,046
I have the worst taste in men.

883
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:51,076
(glass breaks)

884
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,517
Sorry.

885
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:08,665
Hold on.
I have some, uh...

886
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,070
It's okay, honey.

887
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,967
Hey, um, can you...

888
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,070
I'm not good with blood.

889
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,514
Congratulations, Sam.

890
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:25,180
You've just become the most
unattractive man in the world.

891
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,876
Hey. Hey hey hey.

892
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:27,473
- You're really leaving?
- Yeah.

893
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,007
- Why?
- I'm not a babysitter.

894
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,953
- He's totally mellow. You...
- I was talking about you.

895
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,117
You have to let someone
know where he is.

896
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,991
- I will.
- Today.

897
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:41,292
- He's...
- He's a child.

898
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:49,430
I can't get involved with this
right now, Sam.

899
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:52,441
I'm trying to get my life together,
not fuck it up more.

900
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:56,172
Look, I'm sorry that I lied to you.

901
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,373
I'm a good person.

902
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,145
- I'm trying to do the right thing here.
- You're going to take care of him?

903
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:04,085
- For now, until I can...
- You're a mess.

904
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:08,822
What, you don't need a project?

905
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:15,928
I'm a mess too.

906
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:17,956
Trust me.

907
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,736
So let's...

908
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,138
let's clean each other up.

909
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,403
Bye, Sam.

910
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,681
(sighs)
Sam.

911
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:10,687
- Sam: Come home soon.
- (laughs)

912
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,479
Sorry.

913
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:16,754
- Hey.
- Are you crazy?

914
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:19,387
- Why is he still with you?
- I'm helping him.

915
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,897
Well, I talked to my friend Jill,
who's a social worker,

916
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:24,729
and according to New York state law,
you've kidnapped him.

917
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,964
Are you okay?
Do you miss your family?

918
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,562
Is he feeding you?

919
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:31,335
- What are you eating?
- Don't answer that.

920
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:34,901
Look, I get that this is
killer material for a novel.

921
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:38,539
Sensitive white guy learns life lessons
by taking in small black...

922
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:42,381
- You actually think that I'm...
- Are you writing about him, Sam?

923
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,477
This is a big deal.

924
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:48,013
You can't just keep him.
He's not a goldfish.

925
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:50,787
You need to let someone
know where he is.

926
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:54,253
Look at these.

927
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:00,392
I'm anxious to see
what will happen

928
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:03,405
if I give him more than two pens
and a highlighter.

929
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,637
Come on.

930
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:21,456
Please fix this.
Your mom would be so upset.

931
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:24,585
And then she's going to call my mom
and my mom's going to call me,

932
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:26,595
and I don't have the energy.

933
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:30,395
It's okay.
I'm on it, I promise.

934
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:32,993
Okay.

935
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,731
- I think you're good.
- Great.

936
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:37,001
- Hey, Rasheen, say thank you.
- Thank you.

937
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,543
Thank you.

938
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,739
Come on, let's go.

939
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,771
- Hey, Sam.
- Yep?

940
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,386
- You've spent time in Los Angeles.
- Yeah.

941
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,684
- Do you like it?
- It's okay.

942
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,917
Would you ever want
to live there?

943
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:57,290
No. Okay.

944
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,817
Come on.

945
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,831
Go.

946
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,848
People shouldn't be able
to give him so much shit.

947
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:28,015
The man's made
some of the best movies of all time.

948
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:30,082
He just makes too many of them.

949
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:33,994
One every year?
Why not one every other year?

950
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,726
Take some time off
to recharge,

951
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:42,727
spend a little quality time
with the wife-slash-daughter.

952
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,967
Get out there,

953
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:49,411
live a little, you know?

954
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:52,312
- Marry me.
- What?

955
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:55,442
- Let's get married.
- What?

956
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,350
Marry me, baby.

957
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:00,948
- Be my wife.
- What?

958
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,016
I'm serious.
Let's do it.

959
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:08,394
I'm sorry.
You're asking me to marry you?

960
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:10,422
Yes.

961
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,073
So?

962
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:34,646
- You want to marry me?
- Totally.

963
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,659
Marriage.

964
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:47,168
- I'm not buying it.
- What?

965
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,967
- There's something off about this.
- Wait, what are you talking about?

966
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:54,804
Did you... did this just occur to you,
like, 60 seconds ago?

967
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,106
- "Let's get married"?
- No.

968
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:58,670
I've been giving it
a lot of thought

969
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,616
and I think we should do it.

970
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:06,054
Uh-huh.
You got a, you know, ring?

971
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:10,022
Well, I will.

972
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,926
I mean you will... get one.

973
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:16,125
I didn't know you'd be
a stickler for protocol.

974
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,326
Come on, Mary Catherine,

975
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,858
we're not those people.

976
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,393
Just say yes.

977
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:24,269
If we're not those people,
why even get married?

978
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:26,775
We make fun of married people.

979
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:28,834
And didn't I tell you,
like, first thing

980
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:31,278
I didn't think I should
ever get married?

981
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,839
- That I come from a long line...
- You come from a long line...

982
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:35,714
- Both: of divorced people.
- That's right.

983
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:39,279
I'm not genetically wired for it
and you said you felt the same.

984
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:42,018
So why this?
Why now?

985
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,356
Love.

986
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,233
Huh.

987
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,566
Wow.

988
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,402
You really want out, don't you?

989
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:09,480
So I'm trying to let go
of the whole idea of... I don't know...

990
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:14,456
that we have to pay for our joy
with sorrow or tragedy,

991
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:17,653
that there has to be
some sort of karmic balance.

992
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:20,355
But it sure feels that way.
You know what I mean?

993
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,796
Mm, absolutely.

994
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:25,164
You're really smart.

995
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:32,537
I do this thing...

996
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:36,208
I can't believe I'm telling you this.

997
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:37,872
Oh, come on, come on,
come on.

998
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:39,745
Anytime you want
an embarrassing story about me,

999
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:43,878
just let me know.
I have tons... tons.

1000
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,289
Okay, um...

1001
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:51,350
about a year ago,
I was in this cab

1002
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:54,852
and the cab driver, this Indian guy,
started telling me...

1003
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:58,025
he started telling me
all sorts of stuff.

1004
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:02,367
He... he was just looking at me
in the rearview mirror

1005
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:07,672
and he said, "Bliss...
bliss is your birthright."

1006
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:11,043
And I was like,
"Uh, 45th and Madison?"

1007
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,741
(laughs)

1008
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:17,014
And he said, "You have
great potential in this lifetime.

1009
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:21,683
The key to your life is gratitude.
You do not give enough thanks."

1010
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,851
And I said,
"Well, how do I do that?"

1011
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:27,090
And he said, "Simple.
Say thank you."

1012
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:29,120
And I said, "Well, when?"

1013
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:32,328
And he said, "All the time.
Right now."

1014
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:36,361
And he said after I say "thank you,"
I should say "more please."

1015
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,668
- Wait. "Thank you. More please"?
- Yeah.

1016
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:45,147
That with gratitude the universe
is eternally abundant.

1017
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:51,983
So I've been giving
gratitude a shot.

1018
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,613
Thank you.
More please.

1019
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,817
Thank you. More please.

1020
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,416
Thank you.
More please.

1021
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,951
- How crazy am I sounding here?
- Oh, no no no no no.

1022
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:03,124
No, not at all.
Not at all.

1023
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:06,601
Have... have you noticed
a difference?

1024
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,627
- No.
- No?

1025
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:11,970
I mean yes, but whatever.

1026
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:16,604
Anyway, what got you
into photography?

1027
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:19,206
Oh, I wouldn't... I wouldn't
call it photography.

1028
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,239
What would you call it?

1029
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:24,310
- Well, taking pictures, I guess.
- Okay.

1030
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:27,186
Well, why do you take pictures?

1031
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,555
Um, I don't know.

1032
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,720
When I... when I see
something I like looking at, I...

1033
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,126
I get to keep looking at it.

1034
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,672
You shouldn't be flattered
that I came back.

1035
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:57,208
- Why?
- It's a bad sign.

1036
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:01,952
The men I fall for
are horrible and cruel.

1037
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:08,193
And if I'm here,
you must be one of them.

1038
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:19,664
I like having you here.

1039
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:22,041
Well, that's nice.

1040
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:27,274
For the record
I still don't trust you.

1041
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:30,774
- You should trust me.
- Why should I?

1042
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,922
Because someone has to.

1043
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,725
There was...
there was one time

1044
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:41,389
when I was in the...
in the second grade

1045
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,796
and we all got these pictures
of Santa Claus

1046
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,528
that, you know,
were left empty and blank

1047
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,536
and we were supposed to,
you know, color them in.

1048
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,869
And so I colored Santa's clothes
the way I wanted

1049
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:54,672
and my teacher, Mrs. Porter,
she was just...

1050
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:58,407
ugh, she was just this miserable
miserable woman.

1051
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:01,348
She grabbed my paper
off my desk

1052
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:03,784
and she held it up to the class
and she said,

1053
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:07,755
"Samuel here colored
Santa's pants blue.

1054
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:11,089
And we all know
that Santa's pants are red."

1055
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,118
And she ripped up the paper,

1056
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:15,596
gave me a new one
and made me start over.

1057
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:18,099
- Mrs. Porter!
- I know.

1058
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:19,897
So I ran home
screaming and crying.

1059
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,459
I told my parents what happened.

1060
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:24,837
And my dad... my dad came to school
with me in the morning.

1061
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,967
He barged
into the teachers' lounge

1062
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,909
and he started screaming
at Mrs. Porter,

1063
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,935
"Who says Santa's pants
have to be red?!"

1064
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:34,040
- Yes! Go, Dad!
- Right? That was awesome.

1065
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:35,380
- That was awesome.
- Wow.

1066
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:36,817
And that was like a...
from that point on,

1067
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:38,683
that was like a battle cry
in my house, you know.

1068
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,053
(high-pitched)
"Who says Santa's pants have to be red?"

1069
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:43,650
- Yeah, who says?
- I know. I know. I know.

1070
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,956
So that was awesome.
But that's my pop.

1071
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:48,156
What about your dad?
How's... what's he like?

1072
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:49,892
- Uh, he's great.
- He's great?

1073
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:52,366
- Yeah, he's the best.
- Mm.

1074
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,494
- This is me.
- Ooh.

1075
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,528
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1076
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:01,042
- This was nice.
- Mm.

1077
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:04,240
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

1078
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,305
More please?

1079
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,921
Right.

1080
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:16,447
I'll see you at work.

1081
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,187
- See ya.
- See ya.

1082
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:41,911
Dude.

1083
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,283
This is really good.

1084
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:57,129
- Sam?
- Yeah?

1085
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,157
You're my best friend.

1086
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:08,833
Thanks, man.

1087
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:12,337
You're mine too.

1088
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,210
So how can I help you?

1089
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:20,120
Well, I have some questions
about foster care.

1090
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,488
Okay. Uh...

1091
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,686
Well, I might be interested
in taking someone in

1092
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,718
or on or whatever.

1093
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:29,560
- Okay. Are you married?
- No.

1094
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:32,192
- Job?
- Yeah. Well, freelance.

1095
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,225
But I should tell you I don't
really know how any of this works,

1096
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,569
but I'm interested in taking someone in
who's been in foster care.

1097
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:41,269
He's been staying with me and I think
the situation he was in wasn't great.

1098
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,938
Wait, you have this child
with you now?

1099
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,344
Yeah.

1100
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:48,817
A child who was in foster care
in the state of New York?

1101
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,682
Yeah, but he...

1102
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,779
And he's living with you,
yet you're not his legal guardian?

1103
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:56,222
Why is that?

1104
01:09:56,258 --> 01:10:00,126
And where is this child right now
while you're sitting here talking to me?

1105
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:05,327
No no no no. No.

1106
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,733
I'm sorry.

1107
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,705
I'm a writer and I just...

1108
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:13,867
you know, I... I had some questions
about the whole deal.

1109
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:17,470
Mr. Wexler,
is this your current address?

1110
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:21,415
I'm sorry, there's been... it's fine.
Thank you for your time.

1111
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,441
Mr. Wexler?

1112
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:45,940
He looks like he should be
making balloon animals

1113
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,636
at birthday parties.

1114
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:49,940
Why do I have to be
with balloon animal guy?

1115
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:53,574
You don't have to do anything.
You just... he sounds great, that's all.

1116
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:55,948
I want you to be happy.

1117
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:59,386
And his name's Sam.
Come on, that's a strong name.

1118
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,855
And this coming from the guy
who likes his girls

1119
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:05,189
with belly button rings
and the lower back tattoos...

1120
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:07,491
- That is outrageous!
...spending half their lives

1121
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:09,793
- doing spinning classes.
- What?

1122
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:13,461
And I'm sure Alabama is a homely
fat girl with a kickin' personality.

1123
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:16,471
- Mississippi.
- Whatever. Red states.

1124
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:19,099
(laughs)

1125
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,747
Sammy,

1126
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:33,152
you said you were going to deal
with the kid thing yesterday.

1127
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:35,315
Everyone's getting worried.

1128
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:37,348
I know. I'm...

1129
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:41,019
I will. It's...

1130
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:49,166
- Hi.
- Sam: Oh, hey.

1131
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:53,402
Um, Mississippi, Annie.
Annie, the famous Mississippi.

1132
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:56,411
- And I'm not famous?
- Shut up.

1133
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:59,141
- It's so nice to meet you.
- You too.

1134
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:02,378
So, uh, you're from Mississippi?

1135
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,113
Yep.

1136
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,713
What's that like?
Don't answer that.

1137
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:11,988
I'm just talking
and this is me leaving.

1138
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:15,292
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

1139
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,925
(mouthing words)

1140
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:24,329
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

1141
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,864
- I didn't see you sit down.
- Yeah, hi.

1142
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:30,141
Mary Catherine:
Do you remember what you said to me

1143
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,613
- the first night we kissed?
- Charlie: No.

1144
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:36,345
I was wearing
this little black cocktail dress.

1145
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:40,515
It was way too fancy
for the bar we were at,

1146
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:42,990
but I thought I could pull it off.

1147
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:45,459
You know, like,
"Oh, this little number?

1148
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:48,429
Just threw this on.
No big deal."

1149
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:52,199
You came and met us.

1150
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:58,302
I was all excited to see you.

1151
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:03,107
And you sat down
next to me at the table.

1152
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:09,217
- You really don't remember this?
- No.

1153
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:14,781
You looked at the dress
and you said,

1154
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:17,792
"Where are you going, prom?"

1155
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:19,987
I'm sorry.

1156
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:22,656
No, it was perfect

1157
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:25,690
because finally here he was...

1158
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,635
the guy who wouldn't let me
get away with anything.

1159
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:37,271
I always thought of that
as the moment you came into focus.

1160
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:43,308
Like, oh, there you were.

1161
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,880
And now...

1162
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:56,463
it's like you're out of focus
all of a sudden,

1163
01:13:56,498 --> 01:14:01,629
ever since you got back...
just fainter and fainter to me.

1164
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,164
And I'm...

1165
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:14,775
just sad to see you go,
that's all.

1166
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:23,389
I don't know if I'm going to go.

1167
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:29,159
Yes, you do.

1168
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:33,558
Make sure you get there
kind of early.

1169
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,229
I'm going to try
and reserve you a table,

1170
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,034
but it gets kind of crowded
and I don't want you to have to stand.

1171
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:40,166
- So get there kind of early.
- We're gonna get there kind of early.

1172
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:42,268
Okay. Are you sure you know
where you're going?

1173
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:46,372
Uh, the city's on a grid,
so yeah, we'll figure it out.

1174
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:48,940
I'm so excited.
I'm kind of excited.

1175
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,815
- I'm totally excited.
- We are too.

1176
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:53,947
- Okay. Bye.
- All right, bye.

1177
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:57,925
See you tonight.
Break a leg thing.

1178
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:07,257
- Ah.
- Ah.

1179
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:15,641
What do we say if she's terrible?

1180
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:18,168
Tell her she looked pretty.

1181
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,613
That's a great idea, my friend.

1182
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,709
We're going to do that.

1183
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:27,210
(police siren chirps,
car approaches)

1184
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:32,992
- Officer: Sam Wexler?
- Yeah?

1185
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:36,657
Sam: What... what's...
um, what's going on?

1186
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,359
You have the right
to remain silent.

1187
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,301
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1188
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:43,065
- What's going on?
- You have the right to an attorney.

1189
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:45,096
All right, what's going to happen...
what's going to happen to the kid?

1190
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:47,131
If you refuse that right,
the court will provide one for you.

1191
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:49,405
Okay okay.
Rasheen, it's going to be fine.

1192
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,577
He didn't do anything bad.

1193
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:02,613
(siren wailing)

1194
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:09,662
Hey.

1195
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,459
I want you to read
lots of books, okay?

1196
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:18,738
I don't want you
to ever stop drawing.

1197
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:21,572
Just... just keep doing it, okay?

1198
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:25,876
- Promise me.
- I promise.

1199
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,849
And I'll come to one
of your art shows in 20 years

1200
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:33,412
and I won't be able
to afford anything, but you'll, like...

1201
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:35,446
you'll, like, sketch something
on a napkin for me

1202
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:37,481
and that'll be
my retirement fund, okay?

1203
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:41,121
- Okay.
- Okay.

1204
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:49,260
(siren wailing)

1205
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:19,900
Sam? Sam.

1206
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:14,318
#One and one
is through, you know #

1207
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,256
#The lily grew #

1208
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:18,225
- # Between the snow... #
- Well...

1209
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:21,661
#I thought you knew
the lily grew #

1210
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:25,633
#I thought you knew,
I thought you know #

1211
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:29,330
#Under cover we read plays #

1212
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:32,670
#Molire,
those were the days #

1213
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:36,337
#Robespierre,
the Reign of Terror #

1214
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:41,111
#No underwear,
no wonder we're afraid #

1215
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:42,639
#My love, what gives? #

1216
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,174
Mary Catherine:
I don't want to make you

1217
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,687
stay here with me
if you want out.

1218
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,520
I want you to be happy,
even if I'm miserable.

1219
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,026
I am not going to be the person
who ruins your life

1220
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:56,963
and shackles you to a city
or a woman you don't want.

1221
01:18:56,998 --> 01:18:59,967
Oh God. Oh God,
this feels so awful,

1222
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:02,799
like some sort of
grand manipulation

1223
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:05,773
when it should be
a happy thing maybe.

1224
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:09,004
But I'm totally freaked out
and I don't know who else to tell

1225
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:11,205
- and you're my best friend...
- Okay okay. Shh shh.

1226
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:15,148
...in the whole world and...
- Hey hey. Shh.

1227
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:17,048
Will you breathe?

1228
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:21,215
- Please please.
- (gasping)

1229
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:23,247
(deep breaths)

1230
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:29,593
Good.

1231
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:32,065
That's good.
Sit down.

1232
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:39,464
Now tell me what is going on.

1233
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:42,272
I can't.

1234
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:45,404
I'm afraid of what will happen
when it hits the air.

1235
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,814
You can say anything to me.

1236
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:51,182
You threw a vase at my head
three years ago

1237
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:53,687
- and I stuck around, didn't I?
- You ducked.

1238
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:55,883
Fuck yeah, I ducked.
I have great reflexes.

1239
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:58,722
That's what I'm saying.
I can take it.

1240
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:06,060
Whisper it to me.

1241
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:38,660
I will live wherever you want.

1242
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:41,567
- I'll move to LA.
- I'll stay in New York.

1243
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:45,403
- We can move to Los Angeles.
- We can move to Iceland.

1244
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,635
- Fuck it. Let's move to Poland.
- (laughs)

1245
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,837
Beirut! I don't care.

1246
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:55,217
(kisses)

1247
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:06,522
Did you get my message?

1248
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:08,586
I got 12 of them.
Were there more?

1249
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,621
Look, I... I don't know
what else to say.

1250
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:12,155
I don't care that
you weren't there, Sam.

1251
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,724
Well, what... what
do you want from me?

1252
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:15,895
I want you to go away!

1253
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,441
You're making me sad, okay?
And I want you to leave.

1254
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:32,352
You know how long
we knew each other?

1255
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:34,981
A week.

1256
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:37,583
One week.

1257
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:41,892
I mean we were playing house
and it was fun, but...

1258
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:45,192
I'm sorry about Rasheen,

1259
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,895
but what did you expect
was going to happen?

1260
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:53,741
I realized the problem.

1261
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:59,473
You write short stories

1262
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:02,779
and I think you like
living short stories.

1263
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:09,490
But I'm kind of ready
for the novel, you know?

1264
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:20,528
Sam #2:
All right.

1265
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:23,128
Okay, what are we feeling,
red or white?

1266
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,733
- Sam?
- Hmm?

1267
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,176
We need to talk.

1268
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:35,482
(laughs)

1269
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:38,247
You mean the talk
where you tell me how great I am,

1270
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:41,414
but you can't get involved
and it's not me, it's you,

1271
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:43,481
and you're damaged
and you wish you could and...

1272
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:46,551
(coughs)

1273
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:49,529
I refuse to have that talk.

1274
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:52,226
Now would you like red
or would you like white?

1275
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:55,592
Sam...

1276
01:22:57,605 --> 01:23:01,837
look, I... I'm not...
I'm not good for you.

1277
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:07,108
What?

1278
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:08,638
Are you happy?

1279
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:13,017
No, I'm not happy.

1280
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:15,318
I could make you happy.

1281
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,654
Seriously, let me love you.

1282
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:25,530
I am totally up to the task.

1283
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:28,400
Actually, I've already started.

1284
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:30,028
- I can't... I can't do this.
- No no no no.

1285
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:32,198
Don't... come on, don't walk out
on this before it even started.

1286
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,800
Please.

1287
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,834
Look at me.

1288
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:45,719
I get it, okay?

1289
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:48,086
I get it.

1290
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:50,591
I'm not the guy you had in mind.

1291
01:23:52,994 --> 01:23:55,394
But what if you don't know
what's best for you?

1292
01:23:57,365 --> 01:24:00,232
- And you do?
- I believe I do.

1293
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:05,638
Where did you come from,
Sam #2?

1294
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:07,903
Westchester.

1295
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:13,412
Do you want to know why
I hang out on the fifth floor?

1296
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:17,952
The first time I saw you...

1297
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:23,253
God, I thought, "Wow!

1298
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:28,024
Her... the girl
with the funny headwrap.

1299
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:31,829
I want to be near that girl."

1300
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:35,427
Trust me, I don't
normally talk this way,

1301
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,700
but I am gone over you.

1302
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:39,604
- Stop, okay? Shut the fuck up.
- Why? Why?

1303
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:41,506
Just stop, please. Just stop.
Don't say that.

1304
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:43,511
You can hear this.

1305
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:49,816
- Close your eyes.
- What?

1306
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:52,081
I just want you to listen to me.

1307
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:56,087
Humor me, please?

1308
01:24:57,792 --> 01:25:00,056
(sighs)

1309
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:07,932
It's not easy to be adored.

1310
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:12,338
You in particular... you have
a tougher time with it than most.

1311
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:16,707
I get that.
But I want you to give it a try.

1312
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:19,110
Think of it as an experiment.

1313
01:25:21,049 --> 01:25:25,145
I promise I will be very wonderful
at adoring you, Annie.

1314
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:28,519
It's an area where I think I've got
a great deal of talent.

1315
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:31,024
(chuckles)

1316
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:34,152
You're worth the adoration, Annie.

1317
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:36,186
You're worth it.

1318
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:38,062
And the fact that
you don't believe it

1319
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:40,329
has nothing to do with
whether it's true or not.

1320
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:43,337
It is true for me

1321
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:46,101
and that is all that matters.

1322
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,272
(rock music playing)

1323
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:37,215
#I was sleeping in the lilies #

1324
01:26:37,258 --> 01:26:39,283
#Or was I up all night? #

1325
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:44,959
#These days it's hard to tell
what's half-asleep from fully alive... #

1326
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:46,626
Charlie: Wexler!

1327
01:26:46,668 --> 01:26:50,570
#We were loving
like a landslide #

1328
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:54,542
#Or were we in a fight? #

1329
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:58,171
This writer that I know
once told me this great thing.

1330
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,477
He said every five years
he realizes

1331
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:03,678
what an asshole he was
five years ago.

1332
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:05,777
Every five years,
like clockwork, he goes,

1333
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:10,154
"Man, I was such an asshole
five years ago."

1334
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:14,694
So if we accept this,
that means everything

1335
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:17,755
we think and feel
and say now

1336
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:22,099
in five years
will just be embarrassing.

1337
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:24,570
- This conversation?
- The worst.

1338
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:26,267
We're going to hate
this conversation.

1339
01:27:26,307 --> 01:27:28,298
- I hate it now.
- We're going to hate it in four years.

1340
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:30,106
(laughs)

1341
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:37,474
(sighs)

1342
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:43,014
Did you play sports
when you were a kid?

1343
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:44,684
Yeah.

1344
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:46,921
You remember "Walk it off"?

1345
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:48,952
No matter what happened, right?

1346
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:51,522
I mean your eyeball could be,
like, hanging out of its socket.

1347
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:53,898
Coach would run over,
scoop you up.

1348
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,335
"Eh, you're all right, kid.
Just walk it off."

1349
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:58,532
Yeah.

1350
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:01,474
And I'm sure a few of those times
I was legitimately hurt.

1351
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:03,875
But just having this concept...
walk it off...

1352
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:09,281
as a way to, I don't know,
heal myself... it worked.

1353
01:28:09,317 --> 01:28:12,013
I just walked that shit off.

1354
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:20,022
I've been feeling lately
I'm maybe more resilient

1355
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:22,052
than I had thought.

1356
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:25,326
But who knows?

1357
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:28,164
Maybe I'll feel differently
in five years.

1358
01:28:30,104 --> 01:28:32,095
Who knows?

1359
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:36,273
(phone rings, beeps)

1360
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:39,610
Automated voice: Hello.
No one is available to take your call.

1361
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:41,444
Please leave a message
after the tone.

1362
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:42,574
(beeps)

1363
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:45,518
All right, I'm guessing
you're there,

1364
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:47,817
but you're sad
and you can't be bothered.

1365
01:28:47,855 --> 01:28:52,349
But I have a tale to tell, Samuel,
and you need to hear it.

1366
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:54,554
So listen up.

1367
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:57,587
The scene: dinner with #2.

1368
01:28:57,632 --> 01:29:01,193
Trying to cut him loose.
No such luck.

1369
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:02,725
So get this.

1370
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:05,136
You know how people say
beauty's on the inside?

1371
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:06,834
Well, that's total bullshit.

1372
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:11,106
Beauty is on the outside,
and I love me some beauty.

1373
01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:12,635
I mean who doesn't?

1374
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,807
But here's the crazy thing,
Sammy boy.

1375
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:16,942
I'm listening to Sam #2.

1376
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:21,819
Listening because he made me
close my eyes... so hot.

1377
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:25,758
And he's making a total case
for me and him to be an item.

1378
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:30,526
And as he's talking,
it's like the molecules on his face

1379
01:29:30,565 --> 01:29:33,466
must have
rearranged themselves,

1380
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:35,662
because I open my eyes
and suddenly

1381
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:41,141
I am in front of the most beautiful,
gorgeous man...

1382
01:29:41,175 --> 01:29:43,268
like, a total hottie.

1383
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:46,280
And who knew? Sammy 2.
That rhymes.

1384
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:49,408
And you were right, by the way.
It is a strong name.

1385
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:52,886
So here's what I have to say to you
before the damn beep cuts me off.

1386
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,683
Sadness be gone.

1387
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:58,522
Let's be people who deserve
to be loved, who are worthy.

1388
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:01,255
Because we are worthy.
We really are.

1389
01:30:01,295 --> 01:30:05,391
You've been telling me that for years
and now I get to spit it back at you.

1390
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:07,196
(Annie sighs)

1391
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:09,465
You're a good man,
Sam Wexler.

1392
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:11,563
Go get yourself loved.

1393
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:14,439
That's all I got.

1394
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:17,467
(folk music playing)

1395
01:30:35,296 --> 01:30:37,890
#Hey, Jo Jo #

1396
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:40,594
#Yeah, I know your name... #

1397
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:43,468
Jill. Hey, it's Sam Wexler.

1398
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:45,495
I think Mary Catherine
told you I'd be calling.

1399
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:49,408
#Thought I saw you
jump the Utah train... #

1400
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:51,776

(paper rustling)

1402
01:30:53,848 --> 01:30:57,181
#Could be as well... #

1403
01:30:58,686 --> 01:31:02,850
- Thank you.
- # I cannot tell #

1404
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:06,121
#Oh no, I cannot tell. #

1405
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:23,065
Okay, this... this last song...

1406
01:31:24,378 --> 01:31:30,146
it's a happy song
about a happy song.

1407
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:35,281
It's kind of what I need
to hear right now.

1408
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,314
Thanks, y'all.

#Sing me a happy song #

01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:52,062
#About robins in spring #

1411
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:58,202
#Sing me a happy song #

1412
01:31:58,246 --> 01:32:03,343
#With a happy ending #

1413
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:08,787
#Some cheerful roundelay #

1414
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:12,884
#About catching the ring #

1415
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:19,628
#Sing happy #

1416
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:26,537
#Sing me a sonnet
all about rolling in gold #

1417
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:32,240
#Some peppy melody
about rainbows blending #

1418
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:37,240
#Nothing with phrases saying
you're out in the cold #

01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:43,190
#Sing happy #

#Tell me tomorrow's gonna be
peaches and cream #

#Assure me clouds are lined
with a silver lining #

#Say how you realize
an impossible dream #

1423
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:03,772
#Sing me a happy song #

1424
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:12,017
#No need reminding me
that it all fell apart #

1425
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:18,322
#I need no lyric singing
of stormy weather #

1426
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:25,263
#There's quite enough around me
that's breaking my heart #

1427
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:27,733
#Sing #

1428
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:33,263
#Sing a hallelujah #

1429
01:33:33,307 --> 01:33:36,504
#And get up and shout #

1430
01:33:36,544 --> 01:33:41,572
#Tell me the sun is shining
around the corner #

1431
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:46,553
#Whoever's interested
in helping me out #

1432
01:33:46,587 --> 01:33:52,685
#Please keep it happy #

1433
01:33:58,099 --> 01:34:03,230
#I'm only in the market
for long, loud laughter #

1434
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:07,764
#I'll let you serenade me
till dawn comes along #

1435
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:11,244
#Just make it a happy #

1436
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:18,275
#Keep it a happy song. #

1437
01:34:22,923 --> 01:34:26,256
(applause, cheering)

1438
01:34:27,862 --> 01:34:30,854
Man:
Bravo! Whoo!

1439
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:36,092
Man: Yeah!

what is wrong #

1442
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:59,186
#Well, I've been happy now
for way too long #

1443
01:34:59,226 --> 01:35:02,559
#And oh #

1444
01:35:02,596 --> 01:35:06,828
#We got a lot more to go #

1445
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:16,769
#I put a trash can
by the road #

1446
01:35:16,811 --> 01:35:21,510
#And filled it up
just to lighten my load #

1447
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:25,041
#But oh #

1448
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:29,045
#I got nowhere to go #

1449
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:38,698
#Someone's alone,
fell asleep on the phone #

1450
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:44,035
#Waiting like a dog
for a bone #

1451

#And how could it be
that a fish in the sea #

1452
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:55,339
#Can feel like
it's completely alone? #

1456

#I know it hurt you,
'cause you cried #

1457

#I know it killed you,
but nobody died #

#And oh #

1459

#The city ain't nothing
but show #

1460
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:38,487
#I found a needle
in the hay #

1461
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:43,327
#I found the sunshine
at the end of the day #

1462
01:36:43,364 --> 01:36:46,697
#And oh #

1463
01:36:46,734 --> 01:36:50,727
#I found a pearl
in the snow #

fell asleep on the phone #

that a fish in the sea #

#There Trudy writes
this song #

1475

#There's no need for an escape,
you've never been here all along #

but you never came to get me #

#Oh, you never got me #

1480

#And I hope you don't haunt
these dreams ever again #

#And the long walk to never #

#Surely takes forever
and ever. #
