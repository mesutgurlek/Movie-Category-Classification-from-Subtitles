and study hard

268
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,929

Drive carefully l'm going in...

324
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,129
Did you...
just say yes?

325
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,129
l said to drive carefully

326
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,227
Doesn't that mean yes?

327
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,230
Well, that's how l heard it

328
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,611
Miss my text messages
you're dead

329
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,714
Miss my calls
you're really dead

330
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:35,812
See you

331
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,315
mm, l...

332
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,619
Sis, congrats!
Be happy with Hae-won!

333
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,426
But why'd you play
so hard to get?

334
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,228
What?

335
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,937
Hae-won called me
said you two were going out

336
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,531
What? You think l'm crazy?
Go out with him?

337
00:32:58,676 --> 00:32:59,836
No way

338
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,843
l see

339
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,909
Yeah... lt is a little crazy
to go out with Hae-won

340
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,218
Right? You think so too, right?

341
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:13,415
Sis, you gotta be careful
from now on

342
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,924
Why, would he hit me?

343
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,722
When people find out about you

344
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,831
all those girls around Hae-won...

345
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:25,527
Last year, a girl Hae-won liked got hit by
a rock and ended up in the hospital

346
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,535
Bam!

347
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,335
That probably hurt

348
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,227
Why are you all leaving me...

349
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:58,725
Mom... Dad...

350
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,839
Now even grandma

351
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,532
grandma

352
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,910
Why are you all leaving me alone...

353
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,714
The phone is off right now

354
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,415
after the connection...

355
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,910
The phone is off right now

356
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,214
after the connection...

357
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,633
Sis!

358
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,033
Sis, if Hae-won tries to kiss you
pretend to give in and...

359
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,835
His chin line is really awesome!

360
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,709
What am l thinking?

361
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:22,110
When l see him today l'll return
his phone and set him straight

362
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:25,713
Han-kyung! Are you sick?

363
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:29,124
- No
- What happened yesterday?

364
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,528
You're the first girl
who didn't answer my phone

365
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,928
l know nothing of forgive or mercy
so remember that

366
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,832
- Wait, l...
- Let's go eat!

367
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,637
- Hae-won...
- Watcha looking at!

368
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,810
Tae-sung...?

369
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,115
Follow me, follow me

370
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,623
Bastard! Come here!

371
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,035
Your turn

372
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,136
Tae-sung, you bastard

373
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,546
Bastard, got some respect
for us now?

374
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,808
Oh no, Hae-won...
Tae-sung... What do we do?

375
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,320
- Got money for a cab?
- what?

376
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,221
l'll block them
you take him and run

377
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,724
Hae-won...

378
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,030
- What's this?
- Hey, hey...

379
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,034
Now this isn't fair, to 4 to 1

380
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,532
- Here, take him...
- You wanna die?!

381
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,606
Hurry and take him, Han-kyung!

382
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,914
- Hae-won... what do l do?
- Nuna

383
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,413
Nuna... you came...

384
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,524
You're only in the way! Go!

385
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,518
Look at your face...

386
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,825
My God...

387
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,439
- Nuna
- Look at you!

388
00:37:56,674 --> 00:38:00,440
- What do l do?
- Can you get me some water?

389
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,513
Yes, water

390
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:29,533
Big baby...

391
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:34,043
This is a nice house
You live alone?

392
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,541
Lucky...

393
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:44,816
l lived with my grandmother
But she died recently...

394
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,926
You didn't eat yet, right?

395
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,029
That's why you got so beat up

396
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,730
l'll make some porridge

397
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,636
Don't be surprised at how good it is

398
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:20,713
Tae-sung, Tae-sung

399
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:27,225
Are you asleep?

400
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,608
Tae-sung... l'm going now

401
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,110
l made some porridge
have some later

402
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:08,630
lf it's bright then dark
you can't see anything

403
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,433
But if it's dark from the start

404
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,241
you get used to it
and can see

405
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,812
l'm okay, dad

406
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:59,922
Hey! Stop pretending and get up!
You don't even come to school?

407
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,528
- Hi
- Hey...

408
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:17,436
Who beat you up, huh?
l can't believe it, really l can't

409
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:21,242
Sis! What were you doing
while he got beat up, huh?

410
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:25,109
Your sis ran away while l got beat
ln a cab, no less

411
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:28,411
Really?
Really, sis?

412
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,715
Stupid, you believe that?

413
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,224
What kind of wife would
leave her husband and run away?

414
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:40,323
Yeah, right
Your face is like a monster's

415
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:45,732
- Go and study or something
- Huh?

416
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,634
Right... l gotta go study

417
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:55,843
- Where are you going?
- Um, l'm a little busy

418
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,817
ls Tae-sung alright?

419
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,427
Um, yeah, he is now

420
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:19,436
Hae-won, you hate me, don't you?

421
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,934
Even if l did
what can l do?

422
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,132
l see you and all l can do is smile

423
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,735
Man, l'm an idiot

424
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,407
Sorry l'll be good to you from now

425
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:37,614
- How are you gonna be good to me?
- Well

426
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:41,713
call me when you
get beat up

427
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:47,027
l'll take the beating instead

428
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,529
Another way?

429
00:42:57,274 --> 00:43:00,038
Still... this isn't right

430
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:13,312
Get it , Get the phone

431
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,327

- You want me to tell him?
- Nuna, nuna

437
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,114
You're going out with Hae-won?

438
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:46,712
Why? Can't you believe it?
She says she likes you like a brother

439
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:51,324
What can l do? l hate you but
my girl thinks of you like a brother

440
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:56,229
You can't, nuna, This jerk's
relationships have always been messy

441
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:59,433
That's right
l've been pretty popular

442
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,532
Han-kyung, did you know this?

443
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:05,733
Seniors chased after Tae-sung
even in junior high

444
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:09,835
Oh, so you were popular then too...

445
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:14,113
That's right...
But the thing is they were boys

446
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,120
Calm down

447
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:20,815
Hearing you guys talk
you were friends back then, huh?

448
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,721
Never

449
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:27,719
Hae-won, l won't give you my nuna

450
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:32,927
You can beat me to death but l won't
give her to you. So don't even try

451
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,534
Your nuna?

452
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,337
Since when is Han-kyung your sister?

453
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,711
She's not your nuna

454
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,814
Before she's your girlfriend

Tell me, are you?

458
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:20,706
Nuna, is it Hae-won or me?

459
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,112
- What?
- Han-kyung, is it him? Or me?

460
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,721
Um, well, that's...

00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,131
You afraid she's gonna say my name?

465
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,839
Nuna likes me a lot

466
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,012
She took care of me all night
and made me porridge

467
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:55,917
Have you had some?
Porridge?

468
00:45:56,954 --> 00:46:00,617
Tae-sung, stop

469
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,521
Where are you going?

470
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,736
Seeing you two now
you fit with him more than me

471
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,640
Hae-won...

472
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,044
Hae-won...

473
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:29,618
- Tae-sung...

Hae-won...

478
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,813
What are you doing here?

479
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,312
Why'd you come out?

480
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,516
To grab you

481
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,420
Where's your shoe?

482
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,223

01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:09,331
You looked so...

609
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:22,237

617
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:59,307
My mother and grandmother...

But you'd be good at kidnapping too

626
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,329
You coming to a hospital
empty-handed?

627
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,536
Don't pick a fight with me

805
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:35,936
 I wiII aIways Iove onIy you...

806
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,507
Nuna! My singing rocks, right?

807
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:49,116
That jerk...

808
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:53,712
- Hae-won
- We had dinner, isn't that enough?

809
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,015
Hey!

810
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,127
Huh? Tae-sung...

811
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,325
What are you doing right now?

812
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:09,530
This is Han-kyung's friend

813
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:16,133
That's right l'm her friend
Don't get the wrong idea

814
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,109
You're her friend?

815
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:20,605
Then why is she

816
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:26,118
looking at you like that?

817
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:29,918
- You wanna move that hand?
- What's it to you?

818
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,427
- What?
- What's it to you!

819
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:41,627
l got my hand on my sister's shoulder
What of it?

820
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,936
What does this look to you?

821
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:52,409
- Move your hand! You bastard!
- l can't give you my sister!

822
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:58,311
No, l won't!
lt's better l take her

823
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:01,115
What? Say that again

824
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:04,923
Nuna... Let's go

825
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:13,434
No!

826
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:17,632
Tae-sung, this isn't part of the plan!

827
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:25,606
- Who are you? Do you know me?
- Huh? Right...

828
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:28,910
No, l don't know you

829
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,314
S-sorry

830
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:33,421
Bastards, mind your own business!

831
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,328
You guys have the wrong idea

832
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:46,031
Sorry, Han-kyung
l just...ran into him

833
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:48,226
l'm going

834
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:51,635
Han-kyung, even you don't believe me?

835
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:54,737
Let's talk tomorrow

836
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:57,802
Hey, l'm not finished talking!

837
01:21:58,346 --> 01:21:59,711
Han-kyung!

838
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:12,515
This... Didn't you send this by mistake?

839
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:17,830
Forgive me, Han-kyung! Sorry!

840
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:21,026
Tae-sung asked me to break you two up

841
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:22,534
l never thought it'd get so big...

842
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:26,334
Don't lie! Tae-sung wouldn't

843
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:31,502
Who are you?

844
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:36,814
Tae-sung, he's your brother, right?
He asked me to do it

845
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:41,019
Tae-sung and l are old friends

846
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:45,124
Boy, he could sure act yesterday

847
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,727
Why the hell are you doing this to me?

848
01:22:48,863 --> 01:22:53,027
Why? You'd have to ask him

849
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:56,036
To love your own sister

850
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:58,435
What kind of cruel joke is that?

851
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:01,736
Don't you feel sorry for him?

852
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:06,006
lt's all lies, isn't it?
You! Why... Why...

853
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:07,614
Han-kyung!

854
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:10,918
What are you doing?

855
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:14,512
l said, what are you doing!

856
01:23:14,756 --> 01:23:18,522
- Hae-won, look at this
- Bo-jung, are you okay?

857
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,128
- Bo-jung Lee!
- Enough! Didn't you see

858
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:23,025
her fall and hit her head!

859
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:26,625
Yo-won, take her to the infirmary

860
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:30,338
Tae-sung, that bastard
l knew this would happen!

861
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:34,841
She's acting right now!
Why don't you believe me?

862
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:36,534
Believe you? Believe you

863
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:39,907
after you left yesterday like that?

864
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,408
Bo-jung's tricking you right now!

865
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:45,018
Whatever kind of girl she is

866
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:47,713
whatever her game is with me

867
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:52,725
l don't care about people
l have no interest in

868
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:54,123
What makes me mad is you!

869
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:55,722
Han-kyung, you!

870
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:59,925
Are you still suspicious
of me and Tae-sung?

871
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:03,829
You still don't know
who l really like?

872
01:24:03,972 --> 01:24:06,941
Me?! To be honest, it's hard for me

873
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,639
to watch you two

874
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:15,908
ls that how little you trust me?

875
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:19,411
You really can't trust me?

876
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:23,818
Go be with the person you really like!

877
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:25,721
lt'd be easier for both you and me

878
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,530
Alright

879
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:34,330
l'm also really tired of you

880
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,334
thinking of Tae-sung and me that way

881
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:42,239
Go to Bo-jung who likes you...

882
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:14,534
Bo-jung Lee!

883
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:19,206
You dare make my sister cry!

884
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:32,016
Are you really okay?

885
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,128
Should we go to the hospital?

886
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:35,729
Tae-sung...

887
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:39,826
You really don't know a Bo-jung Lee?

888
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:43,537
don't know?

889
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:48,230
No... Why?

890
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:59,113
Tae-sung, it's Bo-jung!

891
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:01,613
Who are you?

892
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:05,423
Tae-sung, it's me, Bo-jung

893
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,926
Han-kyung and Hae-won finally broke up

894
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:12,624
l did good so buy me a dinner
like you promised, See you later!

895
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:14,132
What the hell are you talking about?

896
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:16,637
Hey, hey

897
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:34,217
[l got beat up cause of you
so you owe me lots of drinks! Bo-jung]

898
01:26:36,658 --> 01:26:37,920
You

899
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:42,225
Are you really the Tae-sung l know?

900
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:46,932
How can you do this to me?

901
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:53,029
What's this about you and Hae-won
breaking up? And this text...?

902
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:56,541
Even if you liked me
more than a sister...

903
01:26:56,644 --> 01:26:58,202
This is wrong

904
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:00,314
l don't know what's going on!

905
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:01,710
l'm going now

906
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:05,512
Nuna!

907
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:13,422
Nuna! Nuna!

908
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:18,223
You think l broke you two up?

909
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:20,732
l trusted you l really did

910
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:25,032
lt wasn't me! You're wrong!
Why don't you believe me?

911
01:27:25,173 --> 01:27:26,834
Let's talk later

912
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:43,317
Guess you are young
Soaking in the rain

913
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:47,123
Hey! Where's this Hae-won jerk?

914
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:50,028
- Go ask someone else
- Come here...

915
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:53,727
These youngsters, they never learn

916
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:10,013
Man, you got a temper...

917
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:14,820
Cheer up

918
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:17,517
Wanna hear some good news?

919
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:21,324
Tae-sung, he got totally beat up
and they're dragging him away

920
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:23,521
Those thugs beat him like a wet dog

921
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:47,218
Hey

922
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:48,720
Yo, Hae-won, welcome!

923
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:51,418
We were waiting for you

924
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,025
Chicken shit...

925
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:57,722
Watcha doing beating on a kid?

926
01:28:57,865 --> 01:28:58,923
Hey

927
01:29:12,647 --> 01:29:14,205
How'd you get here?

928
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,215
Heard you got the crap
beat outta ya, stupid!

929
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:21,812
You guys here to fight?
Or chat?

930
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:25,625
That bastard's mine

931
01:29:44,345 --> 01:29:45,505
Tae-sung!

932
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:48,410
You okay, Tae-sung?

933
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:06,927
Tae-sung, you alright?

934
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:16,336
You okay?

935
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:39,015
Bo-jung Lee...
Who the hell is she?

936
01:32:54,468 --> 01:32:58,234
That's cool
When are you coming back?

937
01:32:59,473 --> 01:33:00,735
Well...

938
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:04,107
Maybe l won't?

939
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:06,904
Please don't!

940
01:33:07,548 --> 01:33:09,015
Exactly what l was hoping

941
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:15,413
Hae-won, l have a favor to ask

942
01:33:17,858 --> 01:33:19,018
What?

943
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:23,020
While l'm gone...

944
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:27,531
Take good care of my sister

945
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:32,739
You don't need to ask, idiot...

946
01:33:35,576 --> 01:33:37,908
Go running to her when she calls,

947
01:33:40,047 --> 01:33:43,915
buy her lots of food
and call her often...

948
01:33:47,755 --> 01:33:49,916
and call her nuna!

949
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:55,722
Well, that might be a problem

950
01:33:58,866 --> 01:34:00,231
And also...

951
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:05,135
Man, we'll see each other again
Why are you asking all at once?

952
01:34:06,173 --> 01:34:07,538
And also what?

953
01:34:09,176 --> 01:34:10,803
And...

954
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,016
Han-kyung Jung!

955
01:34:22,456 --> 01:34:25,914
Ooh, that must hurt

956
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:29,518
l told you to stay away from Hae-won

957
01:34:30,364 --> 01:34:34,323
She can't trust her boyfriend
she can't trust her brother...

958
01:34:34,468 --> 01:34:38,131
How can a guy love his sister?

959
01:34:38,272 --> 01:34:42,436
Right? That's really whacked...

960
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:48,907
- l can't forgive you, l can't
- So you won't forgive, so what!

961
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:52,918
- Ooh! Bo-jung's really mad
- Why do you think l'm here?

962
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:57,923
- See this?
- Hey! You bitches!

963
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:03,023
Damnit

964
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:06,530
You bitch! You wanna die, huh!

965
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:08,430
l just did what Jae-hee told me to!
