which would have been so embarrassing,
being on cable and everything.

gonna leave for college still dating you?

Just about how you're not--
you're not afraid to be dark.

that it might be a good

00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:03,055
Think about it.

157

- [Bell Rings]
- [Students Chattering]

158
00:09:12,776 --> 00:09:15,616
Well, check it out. That's it for another day, earthquakes.

159
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:20,737
By the way, my condolences go out to a certain
individual who got dissed and dismissed...

160
00:09:20,818 --> 00:09:23,818
by his longtime, magically delicious girlfriend.

161
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:26,058
Relax, man. No one knows it's you.

162
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:29,419
[Deejay] Hey, hang in there,
Zack. it happens to the best of us.

163
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:31,660
Keep that head up, all right, son?

164
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:35,740
As far as the other dude, if it doesn't kill you,
it only makes you stronger. All right?

165
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,980
Yeah. You better do something, man,
'cause your legacy's in jeopardy here.

166
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:42,421
I mean, one second you're
Zack Siler, class president,

167
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:45,301
standout athlete, all-around
bad-ass mamba- jahamba.

168
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:47,741
The next thing you know,
you're Zack Siler, bitch-boy.

169

- # Give it to me, baby?
- [Girls Screaming]

170
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:56,383
Hey, how are you guys? Hey. Hey.

171
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,184
- Brock.
- Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

172
00:09:59,263 --> 00:10:01,704
- Hi!
- Hey. Hey, baby.

173
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:14,186
[Chuckles] What's up? How's it going?

174
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:17,467
Who the hell does she think she is?

175
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:21,067
There are 2,000 girls in this school, and
I can bump monkeys with every one of 'em.

176
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:25,067
- Taylor Vaughan is totally replaceable.
- Spare me this wax shit...

177
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:26,988
about replaceable, because we're
talking about Taylor Vaughan here.

178
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:29,509
- Sorry, man. He's-- He's right.
- Of course Im right.

179
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:31,429
I mean, the girl's an institution in this place.

180
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:34,109
Every girl wants to be her,
and every guy wants to nail her.

181
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:37,430
- Basically, she's you... with tits.
- [Laughs]

182
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,950
Nah, nah, you're wrong, you see.

183
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,110
The Taylor Vaughan you just
described is an illusion, a myth.

184
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:46,511
You strip away all that attitude and makeup...

185
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:49,392
and basically all you have is a
C-minus G. P. A. with a wonder bra.

186
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:51,312
Oh, give it up.

187
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:54,233
Take, uh?
Take her for example.

188
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:56,233
Short, decent rack,

189
00:10:56,312 --> 00:10:59,193
kind of a Chelsea Clinton thing going on.

190
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:01,833
But given the right look,

191
00:11:01,914 --> 00:11:03,914
the right boyfriend, bam!

192
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:06,474
in six weeks, she's the one
being crowned prom queen.

193
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:09,395
- You're serious?
- As a heart attack.

194
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:13,716
You're clearly delusional.
But how about a chance to prove me wrong?

195
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:17,356
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Dean, Dean, Dean. The boy's buggin' here.

196
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:20,277
You're taking advantage of a
friend in a vulnerable situation.

197
00:11:20,317 --> 00:11:23,437
Gee, that's swell, Preston. A fifth of Chivas
and a uterus and you could be my mom.

198
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:27,918
No, seriously. The guy thinks he
could do anything. Let him prove it.

199
00:11:27,998 --> 00:11:30,678
- What do you say, Zack?
- A bet?

200
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:34,159
Yeah. Unless, of course, you're too heartbroken.

201
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,520
- Just name the terms.
- All right, it's simple.

202
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,120
I'll pick the girl, and you got six
weeks to turn her into the prom queen.

203
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:47,281
Okay, okay, we get it, okay?

204
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,721
- Everybody has a big jimmy. Now
can we just- - - You got it.

205
00:11:49,802 --> 00:11:55,282
- All right. Let's go shopping.
- [Laughing]

206
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:58,163
Oh, man, this is gonna be so much fun.

207
00:11:58,202 --> 00:12:01,043
- [Preston] What about her?
- [Dean] Nah, I don't think so.

208
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,003
- [Girl] I mean it's still scabbing. See, I saved it.
- How about this one?

209
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,084
A-Are you sure about Bubbles?

210
00:12:06,163 --> 00:12:08,484
Nah, we can do better than that.

211
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:11,124
[Zack] What about her?

212
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:14,525
Rectal archaeology. Very nice.

213
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:19,966
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.

214
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:22,047
[Gasps]

215
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:25,687
Gentlemen, we have a winner.

216
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,247
[Zack] What, Laney Boggs?

217
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:30,368
Uh-uh! No. No, no, no, no.

218
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:32,408
Hey, a bet's a bet. Right, Preston?

219
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:34,728
Hey, man, this is between you guys.

220
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:37,968
- [Laughing]
- [Exhales]

221
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,490
Look, fat I can handle.

222
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,130
Weird boobs, bad personality,
maybe some sort of fungus.

223
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,611
Come on. Scary and inaccessible is another story.

224
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:53,052
Hey, man, if I were you,
I wouldn't be wasting my time,

225
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:55,772
'cause by my calculations
you got six weeks until the prom.

226
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:58,212
And if-- if Laney
Boggs is gonna be queen,

227
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:01,093
Id say you pretty much
got your work cut out for you.

228
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:06,573
- Hi, Laney. You got a second?
- [Boy] Here comes Zack.

229
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,294
What's up, Spaz?

230
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:11,454
He knows my name.

231
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:14,375
That's not your name.
That's not his name.

232
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:16,335
Oh. Sorry.

233
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:19,896
So, Laney, listen.

234
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:23,056
- I was wondering if maybe you'd wanna...
- Let's go, Simon.

235
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,217
embarrass me horribly in front of all these people?

236
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:30,217
- Laney?
- Come on. Dad's waiting. Let's go.

237
00:13:30,297 --> 00:13:33,778
[Laughter]

238
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:39,698
Wait! Watch this.

239
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,419
- [Farts]
- Oh! Damn it, Brock.

240
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:49,580
Relax, man. Smells like roses.

241
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,460
I will not relax. You--
You are being disrespectful.

242
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,181
You are disrespecting me,
and you are disrespecting Harmony.

243
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:58,101
Its not about disrespect. Its just gas.

244
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:02,702
- That's about enough of this.
- How's the queen of The Real World?

245
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:05,423
How did you know about that?

246
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:08,783
Please. They've only run that spring
break thing like a zillion times.

247
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:12,984
- So who's the lucky rebound skank?
- Rebound skank?

248
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:18,025
- Well, there's gotta be somebody, right?
- Well, I wouldn't say somebody.

249
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:20,625
But there is sort of a project.

250
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:22,866
- Project?
- Yeah.

251
00:14:22,906 --> 00:14:27,147
To tell you the truth, she kind of, uh?
she kind of blew me off.

252
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:29,226
I like her already.

253
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:31,787
Well, the only thing I can figure is
it's gotta be some kind of mistake.

254
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:34,587
Zack, I realize it's a difficult concept...

255
00:14:34,668 --> 00:14:36,988
for a bitch magnet such as yourself to grasp,

256
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:41,389
but did it ever occur to you to make a little effort?

257
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:44,588
- What do you mean?
- Find out where she hangs out.

258
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:47,229
- Find out what she likes.
- [Door Closes]

259
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,110
Oh, crap. Mom and Dad are home.

260
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,951
lf they ask, Im at Ashley's.

261
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,951
Her brother's home. He's so cute.

262
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:59,631
He just got kicked out of military school.

263
00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:05,312
Zachary, how was the first day back?

264
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:07,232
Ah. School is school.

265
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:09,913
Taylor and the girls have a good time in Florida?

266
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:13,234
- I guess so.
- There's still no word on the Dartmouth application?

267
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:15,154
Obviously not.

268
00:15:15,193 --> 00:15:17,554
You haven't heard from a single university yet.

269
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:20,755
- Isnt that a bit unusual at this point in the year?
- Not really.

270
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,155
You know maybe I ought to give Ken
Wortham in the alumni office a buzz.

271
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:28,316
- I owe him a call anyway.
- Nah, nah, let's give it a couple of days.

272
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:31,197
Probably hear something by Friday.

273
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:35,277
We'll give it till the end of the week.

274
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:15,603
Does my tattoo look red to you?

275
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,884
- Come on, girl. Don't you care about anything anymore?
- What are we spewing about?

276
00:16:19,964 --> 00:16:24,445
Well, two weeks ago, we were helping you
plan your prom queen acceptance speech.

277
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,485
Now all of a sudden, everything's like
"Brock this" and "Brock that"...

278
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:29,445
and "my tattoo. ?

279
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:32,446
Taylor, the last thing you wanna
do five weeks before the election...

280
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:34,486
is alienate people.

281
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,727
- And what is that supposed to mean?
- I think...

282
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:40,327
what she's trying to say is
you should be careful. Right?

283
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:42,248
Careful of what? Okay.

284
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:44,768
l can win this thing in fluorescent lighting...

285
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:47,688
on the first day of my period,
cloaked in tacky rags. Okay?

286
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:49,969
My mother was prom queen in '71.

287
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:52,209
My cousin, prom queen in '82.

288
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,890
And my sister would have been prom queen in '94...

289
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,810
if it wasn't for that scandal
on the Color Me Badd tour bus.

290
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,090
Okay, I am a goddamn legacy. All right?

291
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,730
And besides, not to be a bitch,
but who's gonna beat Taylor Vaughan?

292
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:05,371
God, I hope that's not your acceptance speech.

293
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:11,012
Okay, sir, that will be one tahina
kebab with a side of spiced hummus salad.

294
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:13,133
Would you like to super-size those falafel balls?

295
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:16,733
Hmm. Let me see.

296
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:21,734
- Laney. - Exactly what
does this super-size entail?

297
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:24,535
Stalking is illegal in all 50 states.

298
00:17:24,614 --> 00:17:27,815
- Come on. I just wanna talk.
- I find myself torn.

299
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:30,095
Perhaps I could see a sample ball...

300
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:33,615
to better equip myself for such a decision.

301
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:37,256
- Don't you have a break coming up?
- One moment, sir.

302
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:39,656
Uh, uh, miss?

303
00:17:39,697 --> 00:17:41,777
One moment, sir.

304
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:44,177
Im not smart.

461
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:46,723
- Would you excuse us a minute?
- What did I do?

462
00:28:46,802 --> 00:28:50,363
- Not you, him.
- What did I do?

463
00:28:50,444 --> 00:28:52,884
Hey, give me a hand here, will ya?

464
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:56,204
- Yeah, sure.
- Look, you can't just keep showing up like this.

465
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:59,325
And you can't keep avoiding me.
Like the other night. What was that?

466
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,405
- I was busy.
- Yeah. Busy wiggin'.

467
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:05,526
- Excuse me. I did not wig.
- There was major wiggage.

468
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:10,487
- So, you wanna go to the beach?
- No.

469
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:14,647
- You hate the beach?
- Yes. No.

470
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,847
- I don't have time for this.
- Fine.

471
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,928
- Im leaving.
- Fine.

472
00:29:20,168 --> 00:29:23,848
- Hey, Simon, how about that Sega?
- Yeah.

473
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,609
- What are you doing?
- Im getting ready to play some Sega.

474
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:29,010
- No, you're not.
- Well, I believe I was invited.

475
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:31,209
- I am uninviting you.
- You're not the boss of him.

476
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,691
The man does have a point.

477
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,611
[Exhales]

478
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,051
Yep, looks like a long afternoon of Sega.

479
00:29:41,131 --> 00:29:45,372
And, hey, maybe your dad can show me some more pool stuff.

480
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:47,933
I'll get my suit.

481
00:29:52,453 --> 00:29:55,253
[Zack] Well, once the clouds lifted,

482
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:57,654
it turned out to be a pretty okay day.

483
00:29:59,414 --> 00:30:01,414
Check out that water.

484
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:06,335
Do you know how many gallons of chemicals
are dumped into the oceans each year?

485
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:08,896
Don't you ever just kick back?

486
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:11,976
I mean, I know the world has its problems.

487
00:30:12,056 --> 00:30:15,936
- But would it hurt you to smile once in a while?
- I smile.

488
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:19,857
its just you mentioned the ocean,
and I saw this thing on CNN--

489
00:30:19,937 --> 00:30:23,298
- No, forget CNN.
- [Dean] Hey, yo, Siler, what's up?

490
00:30:23,378 --> 00:30:25,698
[Zack] Great. Okay.

491
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:30,179
Listen. lf we're gonna be friends, we have
to deal with them sooner or later, right?

492
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:34,860
Come on.

493
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,780
Yeah, so I called your house,

494
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,101
and they said you were at the beach,

495
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,182
so I figured you must be at your spot.

496
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,342
- You know, many a woman has lost it here.
- Shut up, Dean.

497
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:49,782
You have to forgive our man here.
His shorts are kind of tight.

498
00:30:49,862 --> 00:30:53,103
Cuts off the circulation to his brain. Im Preston.

499
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,143
I know who you are.

500
00:30:55,183 --> 00:30:59,624
- Hey, Laney. it is Laney, right?
- Yeah.

501
00:30:59,703 --> 00:31:01,784
Well, come on, Zack, help us get
the rest of the stuff from the car.

502
00:31:01,864 --> 00:31:03,704
Yeah.

503
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:12,706
So, think the mourning period's over yet?

504
00:31:12,786 --> 00:31:15,226
Please. its way over.

505
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,227
Mourning period?

506
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:20,587
Yeah, without Taylor, Zack's available now.

507
00:31:20,627 --> 00:31:23,867
Yeah, but what's the deal? I mean,
don't tell me you guys are on a date.

508
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:27,828
- No, we're just?
- Friends?

509
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:35,829
Hey, now, check out the bobos on super freak.

510
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:39,950
You know, Zack, from up here, she almost looks normal.

511
00:31:44,311 --> 00:31:47,871
So, is this what you ladies are gonna do all day?

512
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:51,312
No. in 15 minutes, I have every intention of turning over.

513
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:55,392
- All right. Just thought you all might wanna play.
- No, thanks.

514
00:31:55,473 --> 00:32:00,793
- So, what about you, Laney?
- No, um, I don't think so.

515
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:05,274
- is your name Laney?
- No. Thank God. No offense.

516
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:07,194
None taken.

517
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:10,235
its just Ive seen you in gym class. You run like a girl.

518
00:32:10,315 --> 00:32:13,716
- I am a girl.
- Oh, you know what I mean.

519
00:32:13,756 --> 00:32:15,796
Obviously, I don't.

520
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:21,076
So, uh, you in or out?

521
00:32:24,237 --> 00:32:25,517
in.

522
00:32:25,637 --> 00:32:27,278
Ah, lovely.

523
00:32:28,718 --> 00:32:31,439
- Me too.
- [Girl] Really?

524
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:40,080
[Rock]

525
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,201
- Got it!
- Mine! Mine!

526
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:51,202
Just like that.

527
00:33:12,445 --> 00:33:15,045
So, Zack, my house tonight?

528
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:17,086
Uh, yeah.

529
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:19,806
So what about you, Laney? See you at Preston's tonight?

530
00:33:19,886 --> 00:33:22,646
- I don't think so.
- Aw, come on. You gotta be.

531
00:33:22,727 --> 00:33:25,207
Yeah, you should. Preston's parties are the best.

532
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:27,127
- Booze, tunes, hotties.
- Dean--

533
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:30,168
No, seriously. His house is enormous.
His dad owns Harrison Ford.

534
00:33:30,248 --> 00:33:32,288
- The actor?
- No, the car dealership.

535
00:33:32,328 --> 00:33:34,608
So, what do you say?

536
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:37,328
Uh, sure.

537
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:39,409
Good things.

538
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:43,610
- Well, this should be interesting.
- Will you shut up?

539
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:49,010
What? Even if they are broken up, if Zack
shows up with her, Taylor's gonna shit Frisbees.

540
00:33:49,091 --> 00:33:51,851
[Dean] Zack, Laney, always a pleasure.

541
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:54,531
- Okay, man, see ya.
- Later.

542
00:33:54,611 --> 00:33:56,772
- See you guys later.
- See ya.

543
00:33:56,852 --> 00:33:58,732
Bye. See you later.

544
00:34:02,012 --> 00:34:05,694
Well, we survived, right?

545
00:34:08,134 --> 00:34:11,774
So, about Preston's thing tonight...

546
00:34:11,854 --> 00:34:15,015
- I can't.
- But you just said that--

547
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,495
l-- I know.
l just...

548
00:34:17,575 --> 00:34:20,135
forgot I have to clean the house.

549
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:24,936
its really dirty. Almost... unlivable.

550
00:34:26,456 --> 00:34:28,537
Sorry to hear that.

551
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:43,820
[Alex Trebek] Thomas Welch invented this drink in 1859...

552
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,980
as an alternative to wine.

553
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:48,380
- What is nonalcoholic wine?
- [Man] What is grape juice?

554
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,300
- No.
- [Trebek] That's right.

555
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,540
- [Jesse] You said no?
- Mm-hmm.

556
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:55,421
- Why?
- I said I had stuff to do.

557
00:34:55,502 --> 00:34:57,702
Laney, sitting around with your father...

558
00:34:57,782 --> 00:35:01,462
while he watches Jeopardy! in his
underwear hardly qualifies as stuff to do.

559
00:35:01,543 --> 00:35:05,022
- Who is Lou Rawls?
- You know me too well.

560
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,903
l think you're afraid to let anything good happen to you.

561
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:10,903
l mean, did it ever occur to you
that maybe Zack really likes you?

562
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,224
- Trust me. He doesn't.
- [Knocking At Door]

563
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:16,304
- I gotta go.
- The youngest of the Marx brothers,

564
00:35:16,384 --> 00:35:19,745
- he retired from the act following 1933's...
- Who is Lamo?

565
00:35:19,825 --> 00:35:23,545
- [Man] Who is Zeppo?
- [Trebek] That's correct.

566
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:27,506
- Hello.
- I thought I said I was busy.

567
00:35:27,587 --> 00:35:30,587
Zack. Mi compadre con queso.

568
00:35:32,707 --> 00:35:35,227
- I, uh-- I believe you said
you were cleaning. - I am.

569
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:37,907
I was. I... will be.

570
00:35:37,948 --> 00:35:42,068
Tell you what. How about
I save you some time?

571
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:45,589
- I'll take the kitchen.
- All right, then I got the bathroom.

572
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:49,110
- Isnt that the soccer team?
- Its J. V.

573
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,711
- I need the vacuum cleaner.
- [Dad] its over there in the corner.

574
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:57,671
- Go get dressed.
- I can't. I mean-- Look at you.

575
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:01,992
You look great.
I-- I have nothing--

576
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:03,912
Oh, God.

577
00:36:07,473 --> 00:36:09,673
Im a mess.

578
00:36:11,073 --> 00:36:14,754
That's where I come in.
Mackenzie Siler, hair and makeup.

579
00:36:14,794 --> 00:36:16,674
You can call me Mack.

580
00:36:16,714 --> 00:36:19,555
You know, if you guys need us, we'll be upstairs.

581
00:36:21,835 --> 00:36:23,875
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

582
00:36:25,756 --> 00:36:28,716
[Trebek] This city's French
Quarter encompasses about 70 blocks.

583
00:36:28,796 --> 00:36:31,076
- What is Paris, France?
- [Woman] What is New Orleans?

584
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,997
Ow!

585
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:36,957
Laney, no offense, but when
was the last time you tweezed?

586
00:36:37,037 --> 00:36:39,598
- What?
- As in your eyebrows.

587
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:41,518
Never. Why?

588
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:44,519
Well, do you ever watch Sesame Street?

589
00:36:44,598 --> 00:36:46,439
Uh-huh.

590
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:48,359
- You know Bert?
- Ow!

591
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:51,359
So, Zack, can I get you a drink?

592
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,039
Yeah, sure. What do you got?

593
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,681
Let me check.

594
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,761
[Trebek] Along with presidents
Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln,

595
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:03,801
his face appears on South Dakota's Mount Rushmore.

596
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:06,202
- [Dad] Who is President Rushmore?
- [Man] Who is Roosevelt?

597
00:37:06,282 --> 00:37:08,762
[Trebek] That's right. Now you select again.

598
00:37:08,843 --> 00:37:10,962
[Man] The Cinema for 300.

599
00:37:11,043 --> 00:37:14,884
[Trebek] Here's the clue.
This 1951 Elia Kazan film...

600
00:37:14,923 --> 00:37:17,123
marked Warren Beatty's screen debut.

601
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:19,724
- What is Shampoo?
- [Man] What is Splendor in the Grass?

602
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,684
You really never wear makeup?

603
00:37:21,764 --> 00:37:24,965
No. My mom died before
l was old enough for this stuff.

604
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:27,525
- Im sorry.
- it was a long time ago.

605
00:37:27,605 --> 00:37:30,086
l mean, God, Simon was practically a baby.

606
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:33,927
Nothing personal, Laney, but this particular coif...

607
00:37:33,966 --> 00:37:36,846
doesn't really go with your face shape.

608
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,447
What do you have in mind?

609
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:41,848
Well, I have an idea.

610
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,847
What kind of idea?

611
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,768
You'd really have to trust me.

612
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:50,609
[Trebek] in 1987, a copy of the Old

00:58:47,448 --> 00:58:49,289
What's wrong with you?

924
00:58:50,449 --> 00:58:52,289
Jesse, am I kissable?

925
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:54,130
Okay, about these chips.

926
00:58:56,610 --> 00:59:00,130
I don't know, Laney. You're... you.

927
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:05,932
But maybe if I didn't know you my whole life,

928
00:59:06,011 --> 00:59:08,171
- and I just met-- -
Fresh ground pepper?

929
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:19,173
- Fresh ground pepper?
- He must be crazy.

930
00:59:19,254 --> 00:59:21,174
Who, Simon?

931
00:59:21,254 --> 00:59:22,854
Zack.

932
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,255
[Simon] Fresh ground pepper, anyone?

933
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:29,055
Fresh ground pepper?

934
00:59:30,335 --> 00:59:32,175
What, too cold?

935
00:59:37,217 --> 00:59:39,097
Whoa!

936
00:59:39,137 --> 00:59:41,497
If it isn't the little rain, rain, rain man himself.

937
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:43,417
What's up, Semen? Huh?

938
00:59:43,457 --> 00:59:46,218
State your purpose or die.

939
00:59:46,297 --> 00:59:48,138
- Ive got work to do.
- Sure you do.

940
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:50,899
But I wanna show you something first.

941
00:59:50,978 --> 00:59:53,018
You're gonna love this one.

Ooh. Ooh! Look, look, look, look.

Oh, look at her. Ooh. What about that one?

946
01:00:06,941 --> 01:00:09,862
isnt that your mommy?

947
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:11,862
- My mom's dead.
- Let him go.

948
01:00:14,502 --> 01:00:17,023
Let me tell you guys what you're gonna do.

Sorry.

No way, man. Those are his pubes.

Well, I guess you should've thought about that...

before you picked on my friend Simon, huh?

973

Thanks.

Yeah. I'll take it from here.

Anybody wanna try messin' with me
again? Either of you? Both of you?

You hear what he said? You were listening.

982
01:02:39,245 --> 01:02:42,205
Hey, Laney!

983
01:02:43,806 --> 01:02:46,647
Listen, uh, I stopped by.

984
01:02:46,687 --> 01:02:49,327
Well, look, I was-- I was
hoping maybe we could talk.

985
01:02:51,927 --> 01:02:54,168
l know I don't come off as the nicest guy in the world,

986
01:02:54,247 --> 01:02:56,888
but I was hopin' maybe you could
just forget about that for a second.

987
01:02:56,968 --> 01:02:58,968
Because, uh, l
was thinkin'--

988
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:01,409
actually l
was hopin'--

989
01:03:01,489 --> 01:03:03,329
that...

990
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:05,249
maybe we can go out sometime.

[Groans]

992
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:09,490
And not just "out" out.

993
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:12,370
A specific out. Like the prom, maybe?

994
01:03:12,451 --> 01:03:14,971
[Sarcastically] Yeah, right.

995
01:03:15,051 --> 01:03:17,651
- So that's a no?
- That's a hell no.

996
01:03:20,212 --> 01:03:23,612
Well, that's fair. I mean, why should you say yes? Right?

997
01:03:24,773 --> 01:03:29,173
l just hope this isn't
about Zack, because--

998
01:03:29,253 --> 01:03:31,094
Why?

999
01:03:32,894 --> 01:03:36,055
Well... he doesn't care about you like that.

1000
01:03:38,054 --> 01:03:40,575
He told everybody he still has this thing for Taylor.

1001
01:03:43,255 --> 01:03:45,135
But I don't know. I mean, maybe I got it all wrong.

1002
01:03:45,216 --> 01:03:47,056
Has the guy asked you to the prom?

1003
01:03:50,216 --> 01:03:53,377
Well, just-- just
head's up, okay?

1004
01:03:53,457 --> 01:03:55,938
I mean, there's no sense in gettin' hurt for no reason.

1005
01:04:00,178 --> 01:04:03,499
Oh, yeah, and, Laney? Think about the prom some more.

1006
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:07,139
'Cause, uh, we'd have an okay time, I think.

1007
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:09,100
I'll see ya.

1008
01:04:26,222 --> 01:04:28,863
- Dad.
- You wanna explain this to me?

1009
01:04:28,942 --> 01:04:31,183
- Aw, could we talk about this?
- Have you got any idea...

1010
01:04:31,263 --> 01:04:33,264
how much you are jeopardizing your future?

1011
01:04:33,343 --> 01:04:37,024
- Half of these acceptance deadlines have lapsed!
- Its not that easy, Dad.

1012
01:04:37,104 --> 01:04:39,825
Im not like you. I just can't pick a letter out of a stack.

1013
01:04:39,904 --> 01:04:43,265
Of course you can. That's what being
an adult is all about. Making choices.

1014
01:04:43,345 --> 01:04:44,985
- Really.
- Yeah.

1015
01:04:45,066 --> 01:04:46,905
What about your choices, Dad?

1016
01:04:46,986 --> 01:04:49,026
- This is not about me.
- Aw, come on.

1017
01:04:49,106 --> 01:04:51,186
Look, you're never home. You're pissed off half the time!

1018
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:52,826
That's enough!

1019
01:04:55,106 --> 01:04:58,788
Im sorry. But you can't fix your mistakes through me.

1020
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:04,269
Is that what you think Im doing?

1021
01:05:04,308 --> 01:05:07,509
Well, Im sorry, but that was never my intention.

1022
01:05:09,229 --> 01:05:11,909
And blaming me isn't going to change the fact...

1023
01:05:11,989 --> 01:05:14,029
that the future is going to happen,

1024
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:16,751
whether you are ready for it or not.

1025
01:05:29,913 --> 01:05:32,593
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Welcome to the homestretch, earthquakes.

1026

time-honored combination of crepe paper,

[Chuckles] cleavage and crystal.

1029
01:05:40,714 --> 01:05:42,555
Prom. You know what Im talkin' about.

1030
01:05:42,634 --> 01:05:45,355
And, speaking of the big night,
word has it the recent support...

1031
01:05:45,435 --> 01:05:48,795
of Simon's big sister has left the prom queen race...

1032
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:51,316
tighter than those little dresses
Taylor's been wearing around campus.

1033
01:05:51,396 --> 01:05:55,037
[Laughs] So vote early, vote often.

1034
01:05:55,116 --> 01:05:57,157
Here's a little, uh, campaign music for you.

1035
01:06:03,197 --> 01:06:05,238
Aw, come on, hon.
In the name of sportsmanship.

1036
01:06:05,318 --> 01:06:08,479

[Scoffs] Oh, out of my way, fool.

1038
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,679
I think I touched her boob!

1039
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,880
Top of the stairs, please.

1040
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,880
- Zack?
- What do you want, Taylor?

1041
01:06:20,961 --> 01:06:23,801
Well, I was trying on this little
Richard Tyler dress the other day,

1042
01:06:23,881 --> 01:06:26,722
and I remembered that we haven't finalized our plans.

1043
01:06:26,801 --> 01:06:29,202
- What plans?
- For the prom, silly.

1044
01:06:29,282 --> 01:06:32,242
I mean, we said we'd always go together, right?
Even if we were just friends?

1045
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:35,043
What happened to Lord of the Dance?

1046
01:06:35,122 --> 01:06:38,283
That is so over. I mean, God, don't even get me started.

1047
01:06:40,164 --> 01:06:42,364
Actually, Taylor, I had other plans in mind.

1048
01:06:42,404 --> 01:06:46,964
Oh? You're not talking about Laney Boggs, are you?

1049
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:49,244
What if I am?

1050
01:06:49,325 --> 01:06:53,925
Well, if Im not mistaken, Zack, she's already taken.

1051
01:06:55,726 --> 01:06:58,446
- [Dean] So what do you think?
- [Laney] Yeah, what do you think?

1052
01:06:58,527 --> 01:07:02,127
- I think it would be cool.
- Well, this goes up here.

1053
01:07:02,207 --> 01:07:05,128
- It definitely lights?
- Dean? What the hell are you trying to pull?

1054
01:07:05,207 --> 01:07:09,168
- Well, it's nice to see you, too, brother.
- Did he ask you to the prom?

1055
01:07:09,248 --> 01:07:10,928
- Yes, I did.
- I--

1056
01:07:11,009 --> 01:07:12,529
Its bullshit!

1057
01:07:12,608 --> 01:07:14,769
Wait, wait. Someone asking me is bullshit?

1058
01:07:17,249 --> 01:07:19,090
I thought we were going together.

1059
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:21,530
All right, Zack, enough's enough. This
isn't cool anymore. I like this girl.

1060
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:24,331
And you gotta stop this whole bet thing.

1061
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:31,572
- Bet?
- Yeah. it was so stupid, Laney.

1062
01:07:31,651 --> 01:07:34,332
Zack said he can make any girl prom
queen, and you were the one picked.

1063
01:07:34,412 --> 01:07:38,252
So he thinks that if he takes you
to the prom, it'll help you win.

1064
01:07:40,653 --> 01:07:42,533
People have feelings, man.

1065
01:07:48,615 --> 01:07:50,454
Is that true?

1066
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:57,736
Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a fucking bet?

1067
01:08:02,337 --> 01:08:04,177
Yes.

1068
01:08:08,297 --> 01:08:11,618
You didn't think you became popular for real, did you?

1069
01:08:12,658 --> 01:08:15,538
Oh, you did. That's so sweet.

1070

- [Humming]
- Laney, are you there?

1080
01:09:01,426 --> 01:09:03,546
[On Machine] Laney, I know I made a mistake,

1081
01:09:03,626 --> 01:09:05,987
but I've been doin' some thinking,
and if I could just get, like--

1082
01:09:06,067 --> 01:09:08,987
Stop calling, asshole.

1083
01:09:09,067 --> 01:09:13,228
- # lf I can move it with you will you let me take you
- Wrong number.

1084
01:09:13,307 --> 01:09:17,349
# I'll be down on my knee screaming, take me #

1085
01:09:17,428 --> 01:09:21,229
# Take me, take me, take me #

1086
01:09:21,309 --> 01:09:23,989
# I'm yours #

1087
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:30,750
# I never felt so good

1088
01:09:30,831 --> 01:09:35,311
Fridge is kind of empty. I'm gonna go
to the store later if you need anything.

1089
01:09:35,391 --> 01:09:37,232
Sounds good.

1090
01:09:40,512 --> 01:09:42,792
[Sighs]

1091
01:09:42,873 --> 01:09:45,313
Did you know that some people think being a pool man...

1092
01:09:45,392 --> 01:09:48,114
is not a very respectable way to earn a living?

1093
01:09:48,193 --> 01:09:51,553
- People suck, Dad.
- I don't get it, personally.

1094
01:09:51,634 --> 01:09:54,234
I own my own company and my own home,

1095
01:09:54,314 --> 01:09:56,634
put the food on the table.

1096
01:09:56,715 --> 01:09:58,995
Granted, you and Simon help out.

1097
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:02,675
We're a team.

1098
01:10:02,756 --> 01:10:07,756
Right. Maybe this team thing is
helping to create confusion...

1099
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:10,717
as to who the real parent is around here.

1100
01:10:10,797 --> 01:10:13,237
What do you mean, Dad?

1101
01:10:13,317 --> 01:10:17,358
Well, you know I appreciate
everything you do, pumpkin-nose.

1102
01:10:17,438 --> 01:10:22,158
It's just that sometimes I think you take on so much...

1103
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:26,760
so you don't have to deal with the business of being a kid.

1104
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:33,400
I can't imagine being 17 is easy,

1105
01:10:33,481 --> 01:10:37,241
especially with your mom not around.

1106
01:10:37,321 --> 01:10:42,002
I'm just afraid that if you keep
putting off your life like this...

1107
01:10:43,482 --> 01:10:47,682
you're gonna wake up 85 years old,

1108
01:10:47,723 --> 01:10:51,043
sittin' on a porch somewhere lookin' for your teeth.

1109
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:56,244
Thanks, Dad. That was, uh, graphic.

1110
01:10:56,324 --> 01:10:59,005
[Sighs]

1111
01:10:59,084 --> 01:11:01,925
Don't you have a-- a prom or
something to go to tonight?

1112
01:11:02,005 --> 01:11:05,005
- Ah, I'm not going.
- Oh, you're not.

1113
01:11:05,085 --> 01:11:08,766
- What, do you got laundry to do?
- Worse. I don't have a date.

1114
01:11:08,846 --> 01:11:12,447
No date? See, now, that's weird, because...

1115
01:11:12,526 --> 01:11:15,727
I'm pretty sure there's a handsome
young man actually upstairs...

1116
01:11:15,807 --> 01:11:18,807
at the front door waiting for you now.

1117
01:11:24,048 --> 01:11:27,850
Have fun, Laney. And...

1118
01:11:27,929 --> 01:11:31,490
for you, not for someone else.

1119
01:11:45,732 --> 01:11:47,572
Hi, Laney.

1120
01:11:51,693 --> 01:11:55,654
Like, uh, you don't trust me,

1121
01:11:55,733 --> 01:11:58,254
and I respect that.

1122
01:11:58,334 --> 01:12:02,054
But just look at it this way,
I didn't ask anyone else...

1123
01:12:02,135 --> 01:12:04,695
on the chance that I'd come
here tonight and you'd say yes.

1124
01:12:05,976 --> 01:12:08,495
l mean, that's gotta
count for something. Right?

1125
01:12:14,337 --> 01:12:16,217
You don't even have to
change if you don't want to.

[Both Laugh]

- No, I won't leave it alone. Did you know about this?

1136
01:12:56,823 --> 01:12:58,664
Well, you're the one who nominated her.

1137

For crying out loud, smile!

1138
01:13:02,384 --> 01:13:06,784
- Next. - Okay, I know I nominated
her, but I don't understand--

All right. Big, gaping smiles, both of you. And...

Yeah.

1228
01:20:31,336 --> 01:20:34,016
- Excuse me. Pardon me.
- [Principal] Zack, say a few words.

1229
01:20:34,056 --> 01:20:36,456
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. Pardon me.

1230
01:20:36,496 --> 01:20:38,857
[Girl] I voted for you, Laney.

1231
01:20:41,417 --> 01:20:45,137
[Zack] You know, for a lot of
us, this is as good as it gets.

1232
01:20:45,218 --> 01:20:48,818
We aced the test, made the big shot,

1233
01:20:50,898 --> 01:20:52,779
got a crown.

1234
01:20:55,859 --> 01:20:58,019
- But the truth is...
- Excuse me, excuse me.

1235
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:00,100
- we're just getting started.
- [Softly] Zack!

1236
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:04,261
- We can be anything we wanna be.
- Zack!

1237
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:07,781
- And I don't know about the rest of you,
- Zack, over here!

1238
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:09,701
but I'm hopin' I never forget that.

1239
01:21:09,742 --> 01:21:12,622
[Shouting Together] Zack!

1240
01:21:12,662 --> 01:21:15,422
- [Whispering] Zack!
- [Taylor] Hello. Can you hear me?

1241
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:17,622
- [Panting] I was?
- Tell him!

1242
01:21:17,703 --> 01:21:22,343
Okay. First of all, I'd just like
to thank all of you who voted for me.

1243
01:21:22,423 --> 01:21:25,984
Okay? You did the right thing.

1244
01:21:26,064 --> 01:21:27,904
As for the rest of you,

1245
01:21:27,984 --> 01:21:29,824
- [Microphone Turns Off]
- what were you thinking?

1246
01:21:29,905 --> 01:21:32,905
[Panting]
Dean-- Th-The key--

1247
01:21:32,985 --> 01:21:34,866
- Say it.
- A hotel--

1248
01:21:34,905 --> 01:21:37,946
- He's taking Laney somewhere.
- Room 4-0-9!

1249
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:40,306
[Taylor, Microphone Off] This isn't funny anymore!
Who turned this thing off?

1250
01:21:47,827 --> 01:21:50,748
Yeah, Beverly Hills Hotel?

1251
01:21:50,828 --> 01:21:54,069
Yeah, do you have a Dean Sampson
registered in room 4-0-9?

1252
01:21:55,389 --> 01:21:57,229
Do you have a room 4-0-9?

1253
01:21:59,909 --> 01:22:02,630
- Shit.
- [Dialing]

1254
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,511
Yeah. Sunset Marquee, please.

1255
01:22:10,071 --> 01:22:14,472
And that is the kidney-shaped pool.

1256
01:22:14,551 --> 01:22:16,392
- Hello?
- Mmm?

1257
01:22:16,472 --> 01:22:18,633
If you're gonna help me out this summer,
you're gonna have to know this stuff.

1258
01:22:18,712 --> 01:22:20,673
Okay? What shape is that?

1259
01:22:20,753 --> 01:22:22,593
- Kidney?
- Thank you.

1260
01:22:22,673 --> 01:22:27,834
They come in a lot of different
shapes and sizes. Here's--

1261
01:22:27,914 --> 01:22:30,035
Hey, pumpkin-nose, how did it go?

1262
01:22:31,434 --> 01:22:35,555
Fine. You were right. I did have fun.

1263
01:22:35,635 --> 01:22:37,836
Well, hey, uh, come here a second, will ya?

1264
01:22:40,596 --> 01:22:44,797
I don't know, Dad. I'd really
just rather go upstairs and--

1265
01:22:52,038 --> 01:22:54,599
Okay. Well, I gotta get up pretty early.

1266
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:58,439
We're getting up early to, uh, install a spa.

1267
01:22:58,519 --> 01:23:00,759
So, we'll head to bed now.

1268
01:23:00,839 --> 01:23:03,959
If you two wanna talk, maybe you
can go in the backyard, hmm? [Kiss]

1269
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,120
- Sure, Dad.
- Good night.

1270
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:15,761
Listen, Zack. Uh, sorry
about that whole asshole thing.

1271
01:23:15,842 --> 01:23:18,242
It's cool.

1272
01:23:25,123 --> 01:23:27,003
Are you all right?

1273
01:23:30,283 --> 01:23:32,284
Jesse told me he heard Dean
talking about how he wanted to--

1274
01:23:32,364 --> 01:23:35,644
I just figured it out a little late is all.

1275
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:48,087
You know, sexual harassment
is still a big issue these days.

1276
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:50,007
It's on my walls downstairs.

1277
01:23:52,888 --> 01:23:55,208
That's why--

1278
01:23:55,288 --> 01:23:57,768
why I carry this.

1279
01:23:57,848 --> 01:24:01,008
You push a little button, and
it makes a noise like a foghorn.

1280
01:24:01,089 --> 01:24:04,169
You can hear it about half a mile away.

1281
01:24:04,249 --> 01:24:07,049
l put it up to his ear.

1282
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:11,850
- I just hope it doesn't cause any permanent damage.
- [Chuckles]

1283
01:24:20,891 --> 01:24:23,012
So how long have you been here anyway?

1284
01:24:23,052 --> 01:24:24,932
A while.

1285
01:24:27,093 --> 01:24:30,133
- You missed your prom?
- Yeah.

1286
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:37,294
[Sighs] You know, I made that
bet before I knew you, Laney.

1287
01:24:38,494 --> 01:24:40,335
Before I really knew me.

1288
01:24:43,055 --> 01:24:46,536
What was it for anyway? I mean, what did you end up losing?

1289
01:24:48,536 --> 01:24:50,897
My best friend.

1290
01:24:53,617 --> 01:24:55,458
She taught me a lot.

1291
01:24:55,537 --> 01:24:57,898
Before her,

1292
01:24:57,978 --> 01:25:00,818
I thought we had to have all the answers right now.

1293
01:25:02,338 --> 01:25:04,179
And now?

1294
01:25:04,258 --> 01:25:07,979
I'm kind of liking the fact that I don't.

1295
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:14,460
So can I have the last dance?

1296
01:25:18,061 --> 01:25:19,901
No.

1297
01:25:23,582 --> 01:25:25,503
You can have the first.

1298
01:25:56,747 --> 01:26:01,428
I feel just like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.

1299
01:26:01,508 --> 01:26:03,468
You know, except for the whole hooker thing.

1300
01:26:07,908 --> 01:26:09,869
So... what now?

1301
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:14,950
I don't know. Art school. You?

1302
01:26:15,029 --> 01:26:17,471
I've been kind of thinking about art school myself.

1303
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:21,591
- Art? You don't take art.
- Yeah.

1304
01:26:21,671 --> 01:26:25,432
Yeah, but I'm thinkin' more along
the lines of performance art.

1305
01:26:25,512 --> 01:26:28,192
- Be silent, be still. Be silent?
- Zack.

1306
01:26:28,272 --> 01:26:31,873
- What?
- Shut up.

1307
01:26:47,915 --> 01:26:50,236
- Zack?
- What?

1308
01:26:50,276 --> 01:26:52,636
- About the bet.
- Yeah.

1309
01:26:52,676 --> 01:26:55,956
- What were the terms, anyway?
- You'll see.

1310
01:26:56,037 --> 01:26:57,436
I never back out on a bet.

1311
01:26:57,957 --> 01:27:00,558

Dean Sampson, Junior.

1322
01:27:31,722 --> 01:27:34,723
- What?
- They're calling you.

1323
01:27:34,803 --> 01:27:37,603
- Huh?
- Dean Sampson, Junior?

1324
01:27:38,603 --> 01:27:41,404
- Oh.
