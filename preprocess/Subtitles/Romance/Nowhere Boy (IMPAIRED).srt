01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:26,155
- New Zealand, maybe. I don't know.
- Not round the corner, like you?

757
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,395
He was in the merchant navy.

758
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,314
No letters, no money. He abandoned us.

759
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,277
Then you abandoned me!

760
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,079
It was a temporary thing. Mimi agreed.

761
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,515
Temporary? I'm still living with her.

762
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,388
- I always wanted you back.
- Oh, I believe you. Honest.

763
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,948
She never gave you back.

764
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,237
But surely I'm not Mimi's to give.

765
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,197
You're my mum.

766
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,753
She... She loves you so much.

767
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,397
Yeah, more than you.

768
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,676
<i>(girl)</i> Mummy? I'm tired now.

769
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,358
- Are you sad again?
- Mummy's not sad. Look.

770
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,795
I'm coming in now, honey.

771
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,472
Go on.

772
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,318
I do love you. Believe me.

773
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,073
Believe me, I would love to.

774
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,555
- John, where are you going?
- Away from you.

775
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,034
- <i>(door shuts)</i>
- <i>(John)</i> Mimi.

776
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,991
You said you'd be back.

777
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,071
I think I'll just...
I've got some work to finish.

778
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,470
It was meant to be a surprise.

779
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,029
A Hoffner!

780
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,553
Mimi.

781
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,909
Ooh, you stink of alcohol.

782
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,195
Mum threw a party for me.

783
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,792
Oh.

784
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,995
That's a waste, isn't it?

785
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,394
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

786
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,358
<i>(Mimi)</i>
Tell your friends the party's over.

787
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,191
No, thanks.

788
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,394
- We've got a gatecrasher.
- I need to talk to John.

789
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,471
Oh, more talking? Wow!

790
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,358
You see, me and Mum
have had a bit of a heart-to-heart.

791
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,353
Yes, she told me things about...
Oh, what's his name...? Alf.

792
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,716
Oh, and about you, funnily enough.
Yeah, she said you stole me.

793
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,792
- What do you reckon, Mimi?
- I never said that.

794
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,270
You said, quote, "She," as in you,
Mimi, "never gave you back."

795
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,955
When I don't give things back,
I've got to admit, I'm usually stealing.

796
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,918
What on earth have you
been telling him, Julia?

797
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,195
Did she say why I stole you?

798
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,669
Well, there she is. Ask her yourself.

799
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,116
Did she mention having another man's
child to deal with? A daughter?

800
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,394
Mimi, please.

801
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,075
<i>(Mimi)</i> Please what? Stop? Look at him.

802
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,673
Do you think we can stop now?

803
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,192
Whose child?

804
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,549
<i>(Mimi)</i> Go on, tell him, as you're
so keen for him to know the truth.

805
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,356
What daughter?

806
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,072
Your mother has always needed company.
Do you understand what I mean?

807
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,911
Rock'n'roll, eh, Mum?

808
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:38,237
And she found it, with a young soldier
whilst your father was away at sea.

809
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,675
You have another sister. Victoria.

810
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,597
Where is she? Where?

811
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,275
We don't know. Salvation Army took her.

812
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,992
<i>(sobs)</i>

813
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,877
<i>(Mimi)</i> Then, after that,

814
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:02,238
your mother decides to shack up
with another fancy man, Bobby.

815
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,515
Still married to your father,
I might add,

816
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,036
and then bring you up as if that was
acceptable, as if that was normal.

817
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,235
When your father came home
after the war,

818
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:16,108
he wanted to try and save the marriage,
but she'd have none of it.

819
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,191
She told him to get lost.

820
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,033
But Alf wasn't giving up that easily.
Was he, Julia?

821
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,510
Hmm? Oh, feel free
to join the conversation.

822
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,391
No, I didn't think she would.

823
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,597
You were staying here with me
at Mendips

824
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,875
when Alf turned up out of the blue.

825
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,789
He said he wanted to take you
into Liverpool.

826
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,714
I thought he was genuine but he took you
to Blackpool instead. He kidnapped you.

827
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,553
Turned out he'd organised
a passage to New Zealand.

828
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,030
Got himself a job out there.
Wanted to take you with him.

829
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,958
We hadn't a clue where you were.
I was distraught!

830
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,677
The Seaman's Mission had an address
for a relative in Blackpool

831
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,796
so we went to find you,
to bring you back.

832
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,159
<i>(Mimi) Alf wouldn't let me in. Said</i>
<i>it was between him and your mother.</i>

833
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,118
<i>He pleaded with her</i>
<i>to give the marriage another chance,</i>

834
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,159
<i>to keep the family together,</i>
<i>but, again, it was of no use.</i>

835
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,755
But what to do with you?

836
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,277
So, in all their great wisdom...

837
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,238
Who do you want to be with,
me or your mum?

838
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,273
<i>(Mimi)</i>... they decided to ask you,
a five-year-old boy,

839
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,158
who you wanted to spend
the rest of your life with.

840
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,708
And you said...

841
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:42,755
My daddy.

842
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,039
Daddy.

843
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:58,510
<i>(Mimi) So knowing that Alf was planning</i>
<i>to take you to New Zealand</i>

844
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,273
<i>and knowing she</i>
<i>would probably never see you again,</i>

845
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,793
your mother walked out.

846
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:09,113
Mum! Please! Stop.

847
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,278
<i>(Mimi) And that is when I stole you!</i>

848
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,189
And if that's stealing, I'm a thief!

849
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,271
I had no choice!

850
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,876
Oh, you had a choice.

851
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,829
You chose to take my son.

852
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,110
Oh, John,
I was never going to leave you.

853
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,192
You walked out the fucking house,
down the street!

854
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,555
Yes, yes, I did, but I was ill.

855
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,949
- I get ill.
- You left because you were ill?

856
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,429
I don't think straight. I don't sleep.

857
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,034
I've seen doctors
but they don't understand.

858
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,918
I don't understand.
But I am here now.

859
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,355
I am here. I never meant to leave you.

860
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,433
Please, John, please. I love you, John.
I love you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

861
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,476
- No... No!
- Please, John.

862
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,959
I said no!

863
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,118
Can't you see what you're doing to me?

864
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:09,398
I'm going out of my brain
and that's not fair!

865
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,918
Is it?

866
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,675
This is your fault and yours.

867
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,871
So, why should I go mad?

868
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,598
Fuck it, it's over!

869
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,198
Go home, Julia.

No chance. Get to fuck.

- Right place for it.

880
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,397
Did you?

881
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,869
Well, that's a horrible thing to say.

882
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,157
- You never showed it.
- <i>(Mimi)</i> You just didn't see it.

883
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,630
With my eyesight, possibly.

01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,591
I'm not going to hold it against her,
what she did in Blackpool.

- Forgive and forget, I suppose.
- <i>(John)</i> Forget?

886
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,633
I wish.

887
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:26,474
There's just no point
hating someone you love.

888
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,791
I mean, really love. Is there, Mimi?

889
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,434
- I should move out.
- <i>(Mimi)</i> What?

890
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,988
The house seems a bit crowded
all of a sudden.

891
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:46,914
Who knows, with me gone,

892
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,549
maybe you and Mum might remember
you were sisters once.

893
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,589
- Have you ordered?
- Yes, tea.

894
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,313
It's good to see you.

895
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,995
- Here you are.
- Oh, lovely. Do you have any Earl Grey?

896
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,868
You're confusing us with Buckingham
Palace, love. It's easily done.

897
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:03,592
I am not here to say I was wrong, Julia.
Not about John.

898
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,671
I want that to be perfectly clear.

899
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,599
But...

900
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,595
Perhaps I haven't always been right.

I do love you.

Everything feels so different

Yes, usually warmer.

907
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,392
How was college?

908
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,597
A woman came in, took her kit off
and we painted her breasts.

909

- Not actually physically.
