I may live here forever. That's fine.
Not everybody needs to be with someone.

1162
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:38,837
I don't know, for a lot of people,
living alone is a nasty hang.

Not for me.
My music is all the juice I'll need.

1164
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:48,267
I'm a self-contained unit.
I'm a solo artist.

Well, I better get going.
I'm going out tonight.

That's a very nice hat, and I don't mean
that in an Eddie Haskell kind of way.

Thanks.
