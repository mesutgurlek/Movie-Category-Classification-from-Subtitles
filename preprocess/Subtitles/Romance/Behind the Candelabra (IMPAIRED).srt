We can do it,

20
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,024
but we need to do it
in two separate pieces.

21
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:57,193
We need to prep the dogs
separately for the attack.

22
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:59,228
I just don't understand
why we can't get it in one.

23
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:01,663
Because he's got the bite
suit on under his clothes,

24
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:05,266
so the dogs see him
as a big old chew toy.

I mean, it's fun for
them, they love it.

00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:30,406
- All right.
- Liberace: I'm not going to have one.

162
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,741
I still have
another show to do.

163
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:35,076
What... you're going to
do that all over again?

164

I don't know
how you do that.

165

Oh, aren't you sweet!

166
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:40,783
It's not bad
for an old bag, huh?

167
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,718
Bob:
<i>Oh, you look fantastic!</i>

168

172

I'll tell you, when I was
working saloons in my youth--

173
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:56,798
back in Milwaukee,
they called them saloons.

174

That's how old I am.

175

No! You are?

Well, this
must be fate.

178
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:07,741
<i>One night,</i>
<i>this audience asked me</i>

179
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:11,311
to play this popular hit parade
song called "Three Little Fishes".

180
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:12,879
It barely had a melody,

181
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:15,181
it wasn't a challenge
at all...

182
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,117
but I played it, you know,
and they were happy.

183
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:21,186
And then, I don't know
where it came from...

184
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:23,389
<i>but I got this inspiration</i>
<i>to play it</i>

185
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:26,459
<i>as if it was composed</i>
<i>by Strauss.</i>

186
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:28,327
And they loved it!
They ate it up!

187
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:31,897
- You would have thought that I invented the piano.
- ( Laughter )

188
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:33,432
And I knew
right then

189
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:35,600
it was all about
giving them a good time.

190

Ray: <i>Lee, why don't we have the
boys over for brunch tomorrow?</i>

195
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:51,815
Bob: <i>No, that's
too much for you.</i>

196
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,717
No, no.
That's a great idea!

197
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:55,051
Of course!
Let's do it.

198

- The Liberace of Bavaria.

No.

Oh, really?

And I have two sisters...
and a brother,

to state-run homes...

we'd live with her for a while,</i>

<i>and sent to foster homes.</i>

decide what's important.

315
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:06,633
You know, you'd be
doing me a great favor

316
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,435
if you'd fly up here
this evening.

317
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:11,638
<i>And I promise you I'll fly
you right back to L.A.</i>

318
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:13,506
<i>after my first show.</i>

319
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:17,043
- <i>I promise.</i>
- Okay.

320
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:24,050
Alone at last.

321
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:27,186
Thank you so much for
bringing my baby's medicine.

322
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:31,022
No problem.
He's going to be fine.

323
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:34,492
What would you like to do
with your life, Scott?

324
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:36,895
What's your dream?

325
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:38,463
I want to be
a veterinarian.

326
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:41,633
Oh, don't you
just love animals?

327
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,534
So do I.

328
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:47,537
You know, because they
love you, no matter what.

329
00:18:47,572 --> 00:18:51,441
That's what makes them
dumb animals, I guess.

330
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:53,177
<i>If they really knew</i>
<i>who we were,</i>

331
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:56,280
they'd have nothing
to do with us.

332
00:18:59,717 --> 00:19:02,452
Scott, I...

333
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:04,453
I feel like
I can trust you.

334
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:08,158
<i>And I have to talk</i>
<i>to someone.</i>

335
00:19:10,427 --> 00:19:13,396
I've got myself
in a terrible mess.

336
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,899
What is it?

337
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:20,035
It's Billy.
My protégé.

338
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:23,405
I've created a monster.
A monster!

339
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:25,240
I gave him everything.

340
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:28,310
- I put his name in lights-- I made him famous.
- What did he do?

341
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:31,280
Well, he's out of control!
He's ruining me!

342
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:34,516
He's ruining my image!
I can't stand bad publicity!

343
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,150
My fans, you know?

344
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:39,554
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>they're not dumb animals.</i>

345
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:41,556
He's just... he's done
terrible things!

346
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,191
He's breaking
my heart.

347
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:46,427
It's just he's drinking heavily,
he's getting into fights.

348
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:47,929
And I can't
get rid of him!

349
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:50,832
He's under contract
for six months!

350
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:52,834
I'm going to be ruined!

351
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:55,837
I just wish his wife
would come and take him away.

352
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,672
His <i>wife?</i>

353
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,075
Hand me a towel, please.

354
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:06,046
Thank you.

355
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,517
I never know whether
people like me for me,

356
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:13,486
or what they can get
out of me.

357
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,922
You know,
because I'm Liberace.

358
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:19,524
Walter <i>Liberace,</i>
<i>for God's sakes!</i>

359
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,426
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>can you imagine?</i>

360
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:23,795
<i>I mean, Walter's fine</i>
<i>for Pidgeon,</i>

361
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,465
but Liberace?

362
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:29,335
It was the only thing
my father gave me.

363
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,236
He was
a French horn player.

364
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,771
He left us
for an oboist.

365
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:37,942
So that's why
you're so musical?

366
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:39,844
No, that man had
nothing to do with it.

367
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:42,914
My talent
comes from God.

368
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:44,715
Everybody wants
a piece of me,

369
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,184
a piece
of the action.

370
00:20:47,218 --> 00:20:50,787
My brother George, he
performs in some small club.

371
00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:52,289
You know what
the marquee says?

372
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:54,892
"Liberace",
in big letters.

373
00:20:54,926 --> 00:20:57,327
I built that name.
It's my name.

374
00:20:57,362 --> 00:20:59,496
That's not his.

375
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:03,499
"Gimme, gimme, gimme."

376
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:07,303
No one I can trust,
no one I can talk to.

377
00:21:07,337 --> 00:21:11,007
I hate my life sometimes.
I really do.

378
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,175
- No.
- No, it's true.

379
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,845
No matter how many people are
around, I'm all by myself.

380
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,314
Like, I'm with people--

381
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:21,449
they're not really
my family or my friends.

382
00:21:21,483 --> 00:21:24,185
You know what
that feels like?

383
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,389
Yeah. I do.

384
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:31,026
Yes.

385
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,128
Yes, you do.

386
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:37,731
You've been good
for me, Scott.

387
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:39,633
When?

388
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,568
Now.
Just now.

389
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:44,138
- Oh, you mean talking and--
- Yes, you know.

390
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:45,705
And listening.

391
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,207
You're very good
at listening.

392
00:21:47,242 --> 00:21:50,377
People... take...

393
00:21:51,312 --> 00:21:53,712
You know what?

394
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:56,849
I have a great idea.

395
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:01,087
Why don't you come
work for me?

396
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:03,856
As what?

397
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,992
Well, you could be
my secretary.

398
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,361
I don't type.

399
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:12,164
<i>Hell, Scott, I can</i>
<i>pay people to type.</i>

400
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:14,732
I need a companion.
A bodyguard.

401
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,269
Someone to keep people
off my back.

402
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:20,638
Someone I can talk to
the way we talked tonight.

403
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,674
<i>You'd be</i>
<i>my right-hand man.</i>

404
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,677
You can take care
of the animals.

405
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:28,812
Please.

406
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,016
Say yes, Scott.

407
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,920
Liberace: Would you close the
drapes on the window, Scott?

408
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,222
Yeah.

409
00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:42,658
It's really pretty
at night.

410
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:44,627
- ( Yelps )
- I'm sorry.

411
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:47,563
I didn't mean to
scare you like that.

412
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:49,699
Yeah, I just...

413
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:54,204
( Stuttering ) Things
are moving really fast.

414
00:22:54,238 --> 00:22:56,438
Maybe I should just get
a room for tonight.

415
00:22:56,473 --> 00:22:57,572
Oh, nonsense.

416
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:00,575
Look, I completely
understand

417
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,578
and I promise I'll stay
on my side of the bed.

418
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:05,247
I promise.

419
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:45,784
Good morning.

420
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,595
Well, look who's up!

421
00:24:07,073 --> 00:24:09,507
( Sighs )

422
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:11,383
Joe: <i>You're making a mistake here.
Listen to me.</i>

423
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,979
- <i>I worked for that old fag in his Hollywood house!</i>
- Rose: <i>Joe!</i>

424
00:24:15,013 --> 00:24:16,746
Oh, I'm not saying it
for that.

425
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:20,451
I'm saying it's not
a fit place for Scott!

426
00:24:20,485 --> 00:24:22,586
You don't know him
like I know him.

427
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,355
Rose: <i>Is this the kind of
life you want for yourself?</i>

428
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,124
It's a job, Rose.

429
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:28,758
And it pays better
than getting two.

430
00:24:28,793 --> 00:24:31,260
Yeah, and you know what
they call that kind of job.

431
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:33,463
( Sighs )
That's not what this is.

432
00:24:33,497 --> 00:24:34,897
<i>Look, he's old.</i>

433
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,700
He doesn't like me
just for that.

434
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:39,935
Do you even like
this man?

435
00:24:41,838 --> 00:24:44,707
Yeah. I really do.

436
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:46,775
He's lonely.

437
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,011
I can take care
of him.

438
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:51,746
And he can
take care of me.

439
00:24:53,449 --> 00:24:55,850
My eyes
are open, Rose.

440
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:58,553
I promise.

441
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:35,320
Mr. Thorson!

442
00:25:35,355 --> 00:25:36,955
Seymour Heller,
Lee's manager.

443
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:38,723
Lee's expecting you.

444
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:47,932
Is it any good?

445
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:50,001
It's amazing.

446
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,837
I love to cook.

447
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:57,975
We'll be a couple
of fat biddies in no time.

448
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:00,278
Great,
'cause I love to eat.

449
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:06,917
Come here, you.

450
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:22,765
She's going to see us.

451
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,235
People only see
what they want to see, Scott.

452
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:35,344
Liberace:
Oh, God! Oh, God!

453
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:36,878
Oh, my God.

454
00:26:36,913 --> 00:26:39,380
( Both panting )

455
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:48,889
We'll go shopping
tomorrow.

456
00:26:50,593 --> 00:26:52,893
After cooking and sex,

457
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:56,697
I think shopping's the reason
to get up every day.

458
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:59,466
And it helps
so many people.

459
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:04,003
Do you mind if I ask you
something?

460
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:07,140
How do you stay hard
for so long? I mean...

461
00:27:07,174 --> 00:27:10,076
that was the fourth time
since lunch.

462
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:13,412
You make me feel
so young.

463
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:17,316
And I've had implants.

464
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:22,722
I've had quite a drive,
you know, as well

465
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:27,459
and... you know,
I've had problems.

466
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:30,562
And it's a terrible thing
when you have such a desire

467
00:27:30,596 --> 00:27:32,664
and the equipment
doesn't work.

468
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:34,566
It's like

469
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,068
wanting to sing
and being tone deaf.

470
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:39,471
And no one knows.

471
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:41,339
You're the only one

Lee, I think--
just a minute.

474
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:46,810
I should
just tell you...

475
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,347
I'm bisexual.

476
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:52,783

477
00:27:53,818 --> 00:27:56,520
Well, good for you.

478

479
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:00,757

that flexible.

480

Make things
so much easier.

481
00:28:03,794 --> 00:28:06,396
I am so sick
of getting fan mail

482
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,265
about my engagement
to Sonja Henie.

483
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,100
As if I would marry
an ice skater.

484
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:12,769

I mean, those thighs.

He was
a Green Bay Packer.

488
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:24,113
He came to hear me play
at one of my saloons.

489
00:28:24,147 --> 00:28:25,380
I couldn't miss him--

490
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:28,450
the guy was
the size of the door.

491
00:28:28,484 --> 00:28:31,053
That's how I lost
my virginity.

- Isn't that romantic?
- ( Both chuckle )

493
00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:37,525
You know, I tried
to make myself love women.

494
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,061
I'd stare at women's bosoms
and their backsides,

495

496

You see, I knew...
from being Catholic

497
00:28:46,635 --> 00:28:49,536
what happened
to boys like me.

498
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,104
And I went
to confession.

499
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:55,375
Of course, I couldn't
confess everything.

500
00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:57,878
The problem was,
according to Catholics...

501
00:28:57,912 --> 00:29:01,781
not confessing a sin
is also considered a sin...

502
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:05,684
so, you know, I was damned
if I do, damned if I didn't.

503
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:09,488
I can't believe
you're still Catholic.

504

Devout.

505
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:14,793
The turning point
for me...

506
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:18,297
was Kennedy
getting assassinated.

507
00:29:18,332 --> 00:29:22,734
<i>I was working non-stop</i>

509
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:26,371

510

<i>I wear get dry cleaned...</i>

511

<i>tetrachloride solution.</i>

512
00:29:32,644 --> 00:29:34,913

513
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:39,116

<i>and shut down my kidneys.</i>

<i>So I'm watching</i>
<i>the assassination on TV</i>

517
00:29:46,023 --> 00:29:48,358
<i>and I think... at least</i>
<i>I'll have a few days off.</i>

518
00:29:48,393 --> 00:29:51,661
<i>I mean, nobody's going to come</i>

519
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:56,132
<i>But, no.</i>
<i>No, Seymour made me work.</i>

520
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:58,435
<i>They thought</i>
<i>I was dying.</i>

521
00:29:58,469 --> 00:30:01,136
<i>They couldn't figure out</i>
<i>what was wrong.</i>

522
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,772
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>everything's bloated.</i>

523

<i>I'm drowning</i>

525
00:30:07,911 --> 00:30:11,547
<i>the only thing that's going to
get me through this is prayer.</i>

526
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:14,016
<i>Sometime within these</i>
<i>36 hours of treatment...</i>

527
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,050
<i>I wake up,</i>
<i>and there's this nun</i>

528
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:20,488
<i>in an all-white habit</i>
<i>sitting beside my bed.</i>

529
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:21,956
<i>I said</i>
<i>I wanted to pray,</i>

530
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,959
<i>and she told me</i>
<i>not to waste my strength.</i>

531
00:30:24,993 --> 00:30:28,296
<i>And she assured me</i>
<i>I would live.</i>

532
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,266
<i>Next day, my kidneys</i>

533
00:30:32,301 --> 00:30:34,468
<i>The doctors were amazed!</i>

534
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:36,971
<i>They admitted to me</i>
<i>they had given up hope.</i>

535
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:39,506
<i>So I asked</i>
<i>to see the nun...</i>

536
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:42,076
<i>to thank her</i>
<i>for giving me strength,</i>

537
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,878

if being gay was the sin
that the Church said it was.

543

Doesn't he get insulted when you
don't invite him over for dinner?

723
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,365
He gets 10% of every

724

I don't have to
take him out for dinner.

Why go through all of the
work and the money...

just to have it all
fall down within a year?

time after time.

he was as good as you are.

748
00:43:42,575 --> 00:43:44,276
I'm going to recommend
a deep face peel

749
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,677
after the face lift.

750

You're going
to look fabulous!

751
00:43:48,313 --> 00:43:50,347
You'll look as young
as Scott here.

Oh, thank you!

00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:54,952

755
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:00,257
But what about
the press?

756
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:02,793
How do we keep this
a secret?

757
00:44:02,827 --> 00:44:05,796
We rent you a fully furnished
apartment under an alias

758
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,731
until the bandages
come off.

759
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:09,166
No one will know.

760
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,569
After that, you can
recuperate as you like.

761
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:14,838
Jack, I wish
I'd met you sooner.

762
00:44:14,872 --> 00:44:17,173
I would still have
had a movie career!

763
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:20,109
That was my real dream--
to be a movie star.

764
00:44:20,143 --> 00:44:23,445
Now, Jack, I want
to talk to you

765
00:44:23,479 --> 00:44:25,948
about doing some surgery
on Scott here.

766
00:44:25,982 --> 00:44:27,216
What?

767
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,283
Fine.

768
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:30,619
What would you like me
to do with Scott?

769
00:44:33,189 --> 00:44:36,591
I want you to make Scott
look like this.

770
00:44:37,593 --> 00:44:39,293
Can you do that?

771
00:44:42,164 --> 00:44:43,598
Oh, I see.

772
00:44:43,632 --> 00:44:46,267
Yes, I think
I can do what you want.

773
00:44:47,236 --> 00:44:49,369
He's going to need
a nose job.

774
00:44:49,403 --> 00:44:52,172
And I'm going to have to
restructure his cheekbones

775
00:44:52,207 --> 00:44:54,541
and his chin
with silicone implants,

776

<i>but it's not</i>
<i>impossible.</i>

777
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,913
But first we have to
slim him down!

778
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:03,784
I have a terrific diet.

Oh, I don't know, man.

795
00:45:55,732 --> 00:45:57,967

and not recognizing
myself?

797
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:02,272

Not entirely.

Just keep

Disgusting is in the eyes

There's nothing wrong with
any part of the human body.

It's all
God's creation.

Well, God didn't make certain
parts for certain things.

1109

It's variety, Scott.

It's what keeps
a relationship fresh.

1248

Good.

1249
01:12:57,652 --> 01:13:00,188
I had some
positive feedback.

1250
01:13:00,222 --> 01:13:02,423
When are you going to let me
hear one of your songs?

1251
01:13:02,457 --> 01:13:04,926
- I don't know.
- Why?

1252
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,328
'Cause I'm afraid
you wouldn't like it.

1253
01:13:07,363 --> 01:13:09,296
But I'm proud
of what you're doing!

1254
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:10,931
I'm like a proud papa!

I think it's great!

1256
01:13:14,835 --> 01:13:16,904
Maybe when I'm done with
this one, you can hear it.

1257

1258
01:13:31,251 --> 01:13:33,653
Scott, we should talk.

1259
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:37,457
I think
our relationship

1260
01:13:37,491 --> 01:13:39,893
is in a really
good place, don't you?

1261
01:13:39,927 --> 01:13:42,861
- Mm-hmm.
- I do.

1262
01:13:42,896 --> 01:13:45,931
So I think it'd be
a good thing for us...

1263
01:13:45,965 --> 01:13:48,700
if we were able to see
other people, too.

1264
01:13:48,735 --> 01:13:50,936
I don't mean
like you and me.

1265
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:54,506
I mean, nothing
will ever be like us.

1266
01:13:54,541 --> 01:13:57,942
I just know there are things that
I like to do that you don't...

1267
01:13:57,976 --> 01:14:00,645
and things that you like
to do that I don't.

1268
01:14:00,679 --> 01:14:03,347
And I just think that
we're in such a good place

1269
01:14:03,381 --> 01:14:07,485
that we can allow each other...
you know, to do that

1270
01:14:07,519 --> 01:14:12,156
and still love each other
and stay together.

1271

What do you think?

1272
01:14:17,428 --> 01:14:20,831
Okay. You know,
if that's what you want.

1273
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,367
I think it'd be
good for us.

1274
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:26,670
I really do.

1275
01:14:26,704 --> 01:14:29,872
Lee, he is
just a friend!

1276
01:14:29,906 --> 01:14:31,574
He is helping me
with my songs!

1277
01:14:31,608 --> 01:14:33,141
I told you I had
meetings with him!

1278

You're just like
the rest of them.

All I do is give
and give and give.

All you want is what
you can get out of me.

1281

not gifts?

1701
01:39:28,778 --> 01:39:31,012
Well, this is what I do
with all my homes.

1702
01:39:31,046 --> 01:39:34,182
I furnish all my homes
for people to use.

1703
01:39:34,216 --> 01:39:36,450
But that does not mean
they can take the furniture

1704
01:39:36,485 --> 01:39:38,051
with them
when they leave.

1705
01:39:38,086 --> 01:39:40,721
It's my property.

1706
01:39:40,756 --> 01:39:43,758
Did you make a gift of any
furs to Scott Thorson?

1707
01:39:43,792 --> 01:39:46,260
- <i>Yes.</i>
- What furs?

1708
01:39:46,294 --> 01:39:51,063
<i>Uh, a raccoon,</i>
<i>a black mink trenchcoat,</i>

1709
01:39:51,098 --> 01:39:54,467
<i>a leather</i>
<i>and black mink coat...</i>

1710
01:39:54,502 --> 01:39:57,670
<i>and um, that's it.</i>

1711
01:39:57,705 --> 01:40:01,007
And what other gifts have
you made to Scott Thorson?

1712
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:02,809
<i>Jewelry.</i>

1713
01:40:03,677 --> 01:40:05,077
<i>What form of jewelry?</i>

1714
01:40:05,112 --> 01:40:07,946
A ring with
his initial on it...

1715
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:11,784
and two Krugerrands
made up the ring.

1716
01:40:12,852 --> 01:40:15,253
Gold chains.

1717
01:40:15,288 --> 01:40:19,391
Australian opal ring.

1718
01:40:19,426 --> 01:40:21,660
Bracelets,
things like that.

1719
01:40:21,694 --> 01:40:24,896
Lawyer #2: <i>Okay, first off, you
have to understand something.</i>

1720
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:26,697
<i>You're not getting</i>
<i>any of your property back.</i>

1721
01:40:26,732 --> 01:40:27,965
<i>You're not getting a dime...</i>

1722
01:40:27,999 --> 01:40:29,767
unless you sign
this agreement.

1723
01:40:29,802 --> 01:40:31,436
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1724
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:33,237
- All right.
- ( Sniffs )

1725
01:40:33,271 --> 01:40:35,406
You're going to get
$75,000 in cash,

1726
01:40:35,441 --> 01:40:37,241
three of your cars,
three dogs

1727
01:40:37,275 --> 01:40:38,675
and all
your clothes.

1728
01:40:38,709 --> 01:40:40,477
$75,000?
That's it?

1729
01:40:40,511 --> 01:40:42,345
In return for the
money, the cars,

1730
01:40:42,379 --> 01:40:44,080
the dogs and the
personal property...

1731
01:40:44,114 --> 01:40:45,415
you're going to
sign over the title

1732
01:40:45,449 --> 01:40:47,349
of your Las Vegas home
on Laramore to Lee.

1733
01:40:47,383 --> 01:40:49,819
And that's estimated value
right now at $200,000.

1734
01:40:49,853 --> 01:40:52,120
You're going to give over
all the <i>contents</i> to Lee,

1735
01:40:52,155 --> 01:40:54,189
estimated at $50,000.

1736
01:40:54,223 --> 01:40:56,291
In addition,
you will be required

1737
01:40:56,326 --> 01:40:59,595
to sign over the titles
of your Chevrolet van,

1738
01:40:59,629 --> 01:41:01,696
the antique Cadillac
and your Auburn

1739
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:03,364
to Mr. Liberace.

1740
01:41:03,398 --> 01:41:04,966
You will also give up
any other claims

1741
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,069
against Mr. Liberace
of any kind in the future.

1742
01:41:08,103 --> 01:41:12,306
So assault, battery,
palimony-- out.

1743
01:41:12,341 --> 01:41:15,042
And you're going to sign
a clause prohibiting you

1744
01:41:15,077 --> 01:41:17,478
from revealing the true
nature of your relationship

1745
01:41:17,512 --> 01:41:18,745
to anybody,
public or private.

1746
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:20,080
This is the best
we could do?

1747
01:41:20,114 --> 01:41:24,585
They're shortchanging
me $250,000.

1748
01:41:24,619 --> 01:41:27,153
Well, there's nothing in here
about the jewelry he gave you,

1749
01:41:27,188 --> 01:41:28,889
- so you get to keep that.
- I had to sell the jewelry!

1750
01:41:28,923 --> 01:41:33,026
- For what?
- For legal, uh, fees and other things.

1751
01:41:34,828 --> 01:41:37,830
I don't care...
what the judge says,

1752
01:41:37,865 --> 01:41:39,599
we were
fucking married!

1753
01:41:39,633 --> 01:41:42,568
Well, the law says
you weren't.

1754
01:41:42,603 --> 01:41:45,805
And a contract for sex
can't be enforced.

1755
01:41:45,839 --> 01:41:49,375
Scott, listen to me.
You're a drug addict.

1756
01:41:49,409 --> 01:41:51,442
<i>This is all</i>
<i>you're getting.</i>

1757
01:41:51,477 --> 01:41:53,344
<i>Sign it.</i>

1758
01:41:55,681 --> 01:41:57,448
You know, I called
Billy Leatherwood.

1759
01:41:57,483 --> 01:41:59,250
He got more.

1760
01:42:09,293 --> 01:42:11,261
Thank you.

( Sniffles )

1823
01:47:34,733 --> 01:47:37,034

Man:
<i>At 2:05 p.m. today...</i>

1825
01:47:48,646 --> 01:47:52,515
Liberace died
of cardiac arrest...

1826
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:54,951
caused by
cardiac failure.

1827
01:47:54,985 --> 01:47:57,987
His body will be
taken to Los Angeles,

1828
01:47:58,021 --> 01:48:00,456
where it will be
prepared for burial.

1829
01:48:00,490 --> 01:48:02,658
In an unusual
twist of events...

1830
01:48:02,692 --> 01:48:04,526
the Riverside County
Health Department

1831
01:48:04,561 --> 01:48:06,528
has rejected
the death certificate...

1832
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:09,531
by Liberace's attending
doctor, Ronald Daniels,

1833
01:48:09,566 --> 01:48:10,932
and has ordered
an autopsy.

1834
01:48:10,967 --> 01:48:15,336
This request
is unseemly.

1835
01:48:15,371 --> 01:48:17,805
Mr. Liberace died
of heart failure...

1836
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:21,308
due to an anemia caused
by a watermelon diet.

1837
01:48:21,343 --> 01:48:24,545
The body has already
been embalmed!

1838
01:48:24,580 --> 01:48:27,849
With respect to Liberace's
family during this time,

1839
01:48:27,883 --> 01:48:31,284
we have asked that the request
for autopsy be rejected.

1840
01:48:31,318 --> 01:48:34,488
Since Mr. Liberace
has already been embalmed,

1841
01:48:34,522 --> 01:48:37,724
it was necessary
to take tissue samples.

1842
01:48:37,759 --> 01:48:39,626
Along with the medical
records of blood tests

1843
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:42,061
during his recent stay at the
Eisenhower Medical Center...

1844
01:48:42,096 --> 01:48:46,032
it is the conclusion of the Riverside
County Health Department...

1845
01:48:46,066 --> 01:48:48,734
that Mr. Liberace
died of complications

1846
01:48:48,769 --> 01:48:50,703
due to the AIDS virus.

1847

Seymour: <i>Thank you
all for coming.</i>

1848

<i>I think that what should be</i>

<i>was a great professional...</i>

<i>a great showman,</i>
