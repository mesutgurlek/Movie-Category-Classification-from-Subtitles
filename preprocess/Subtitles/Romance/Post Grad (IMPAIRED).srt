00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,699
No. I don't want your pity hug.

460
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,102
Come on. Ryden.

461
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:02,844
[Sighs] It's okay, you poor,
poor, no-talent screw-up.

462
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,882
- [Stammers]
- Oh, shut up! You can joke about it.

463
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,883
You already got into law school.

464
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,943
- So?
- So, you're set. You're good. Whatever.

465
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,582
Yeah, maybe I'm set and I'm good,
but does that mean I'm gonna be happy?

466
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,892
- Come here.
- Screw you. I'm not going in.

467
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,728
You don't have to go in. Just...

468
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,632
come out here so I can tell you something.

469
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,571
- I don't think two people can be on
this thing. - Quit bitching and come here.

470
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,735
[Sighs]

471
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,143
Okay.

472
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,309
- Come all the way to the edge.
- What?

473
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,646
I'm celebrating.

474
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,985
I'm opening at The Mint on Friday.

475
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,024
- You are?
- Yeah.

476
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,957
- Shut up! Really?
- Yeah.

477
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,622
Adam, so you're going into music then.
Why don't you just say that?

478
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,222
Well, because I'm not
saying that necessarily.

479
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,995
So you're going to law school?

480
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,093
No, I'm not saying that either necessarily.

481
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,298
- Then what are you saying, necessarily?
- I don't know what I'm saying.

482
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:06,434
All I'm saying is that I'm opening
at The Mint on Friday. Yea!

483
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:13,145
Look, you got the hard part figured out.
You know what you wanna do.

484
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,085
Now you can just spend
the rest of your life going after it.

485
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,414
This one's popular with all the
college kids. And this one...

486
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,290
- No, no.
- If you like 'em, you sell 'em all...

487
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,192
- I got plenty more... even higher quality.
- That's fantastic.

488
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,359
- Almost unbelievable.
- I am Hugo, the vampire.

489
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,029
- Not now, Hugo.
- Then help me build my boxcar.

490
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,572
I'm doing business now. Doing business.

491
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,438
<i>It's so lifelike. It is. That's real snake.</i>

492
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,842
<i>- All made right here in the country?
- All here.</i>

493
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,474
Geez, that's fantastic.
I'll call you about the rest of them.

494
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:45,802
All right, buddy.
Thank you. All right.

495
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,719
Hey, who was that guy?

496
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,948
Here, honey.
Grab that box for me, would you?

497
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,855
Carry it inside.
That's Gary. Gary the Buckle Man.

498
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,259
So these are the buckles, huh?

499
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,262
Yep, first shipment.

500
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,821
Hey. Question.

501
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,834
As vice president...

502
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:07,838
how would you like to spearhead
the marketing campaign?

503
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:12,570
- The marketing campaign?
- Yeah. You know, ads and slogans and...

504
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,136
you know, maybe some clever ideas
for some of the buckles, like...

505
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,239
I don't know. What do we got here?

506
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:22,753
Look at this. Look at that one there. That
could be the... like, the Cobra, you know?

507
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,755
Or, uh... I don't know. Here.

508
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,688
Look... Here. This could be the...

509
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,157
Uh...

510
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,251
It's just the flag of
Delaware. I don't know.

511
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:35,061
But you know what I mean.
Just some thoughts. Just ideas.

512
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,096
You know what I want...
as vice president, Dad?

513
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,105
I want my car back.

514
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,734
I want to stop having to call a taxi
every time I have to leave the house.

515
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,007
I told you. The part hasn't come in from
the factory yet. It's... It's a curveball.

516
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,605
You're gonna get thrown curveballs.
Life and work are like baseball.

517
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,117
You can't rest at the plate.
You gotta keep trying.

518
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:58,349
But I am trying hard.
I mean, I... I am scouring the job market.

519
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:02,792
I... I am. I'm getting up early,
and I'm searching for something, anything...

520
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,795
to get my foot in the door.

521
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,388
And do you have any clue
what these interviews are like?

522
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:10,298
I mean, I'm constantly having to gauge
how I'm coming across...

523
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,666
all the while without a consistent form
of transportation...

524
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,968
because you turned my car
into your latest science project.

525
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,703
So I really don't need to hear
that I'm not trying right now.

526
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:23,770
Well, maybe you're setting
your sights too high.

527
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:27,716
Oh, really? Well, where do you think
I should be setting my sights?

528
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,419
[Sighs]

529
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,716
If you just give this one a chance,
I know you're gonna love it.

530
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,785
You just have to open it up,
get in there, check out all the pockets.

531
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,661
Ma'am? Sir?
[Sighs]

532
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,928
It's on clearance!

533
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,807
Eye contact. Remember? We talked about it.

534
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,809
You gotta bring 'em in. Okay?

535
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,311
<i>Honey, come on.</i>

536
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,974
You gotta have a positive attitude
if you want to sell the suitcases.

537
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,246
Here. Let me show you something.
Hey, how you doing?

538
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,484
- Fine. - You headed out of town,
if you don't mind me asking?

539
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:08,525
- Yeah.
- Really? Where you going?

540
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,084
- Maui.
- Oh, wow! Hawaii. That's fantastic.

541
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,096
You going there for business, pleasure?

542
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,257
- Business.
- No, don't say business.

543
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,925
- Don't say business. Say pleasure.
Who go... - Pleasure.

544
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,333
- Why do you ask me the question then?
- I'm try... Here. Look.

545
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,862
Let me show you, honey. Do a little
demonstration, you know, right in here.

546
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,205
Like this. You point at the
wheels or something, you know.

547
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,938
<i>- It's like, you know what? Those
girls from Deal or No Deal. - Mm-hmm.</i>

548
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:32,039
You do that. Maybe not so slutty,
but show with a hand thing.

549
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,640
Here. Go ahead.

550
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,652
Remember... eye contact.

551
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,086
- Okay. Look at the wheels.
- There you go.

552
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,716
- Look how they roll. Oh, it's so nice.
- Yeah.

553
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,386
Here we go. Hot potato.
Right here. Right here.

554
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,362
Are you in the market for some lug...
Oh, crap!

555
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,058
- Hi.
- Hi.

556
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,295
- I didn't know you worked here at
The Luggage Shack. - I don't work here.

557
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,303
Uh...

558
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,636
I, um... It's... It's temporary.

559
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,505
Right.

560
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:03,377
Um, how's Happerman & Browning?

561
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,678
Uh, great. Really, really great.

562
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,650
They're sending me to New York
next week for a conference.

563
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,744
- Hence the need for a new briefcase.
- Sounds so great.

564
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,982
Yeah, I saw one over here
last week that I loved.

565
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,251
- Let me take a look at that black one.
- Up there?

566
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,555
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. Um...

567
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,962
There we go.

568
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:26,527
Ah... You know what? I want to take a look
at the one right next to it.

569
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,765
<i>Nope. I gotta trust my
instincts on this one.</i>

570
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,741
I'm saying no to that one.
I'm going back to the original.

571
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:41,042
You know, things are moving
outlandishly quick for me right now.

572
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,053
Unbelievably fast.

573
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,715
I'll need a good team.
I need people around me I can trust.

574
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,781
This is a no.

575
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,687
Let me take a look at this gray one here.

576
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,629
I thought you wanted a briefcase.

577
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,065
<i>- I'm gonna need both.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

578
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,365
- Lot of traveling.
- Right.

579
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,563
Okay.

580
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,369
That's the one.

581
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,313
You know, Ryden, I think
we've got really good synergy, you and I.

582
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,314
I know you're in a tough place right now...

583
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:15,216
but I want you to remember that
struggle and strife come before success.

584
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,356
Even in the dictionary.
[Chuckles]

585
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,222
I'm not gonna take this one.
Can I see that black one up there?

586
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,819
You know what?

587
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,333
Dad! All yours!

588
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,074
Hunty, can't ride Mama's shoe
when she's trying to make waffles.

589
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,078
- Giddyap.
- Come on, honey.

590
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,137
<i>Go play. Go.</i>

591
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:48,083
- Ride like the wind.
- [Sighs] Honey.

592
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,744
What do you want, Maureen? What?

593
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,348
<i>- Hunter is a very unique little boy.
- I don't want you to coddle him.</i>

594
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:58,327
I am not coddling him, okay?
I'm just a little concerned...

595
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,098
that he's weird.

596
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:05,260
Well, of course he's weird!

597
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:08,965
He's a Malby. Weird is good.

598
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,770
Weird indicates a creative force.

599
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,311
<i>[Mother] You have no idea what
I go through, okay? Trust me.</i>

600
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,438
- Hey, come on. I wanna show you
something. Come on. - Huh?

601
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,985
# Bum, bum, bum, bum #

602
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,648
# Bum, bum, bum, bum
bum, bum, bum, bum #

603
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,453

01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:14,957
Life sucks without you.

01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:25,504
"Hey, we had some great times...
you know, keep in touch" kind of thing.

01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:30,601
It's... It was more like,
"I can't eat... I can't sleep...

kind of thing.

1366
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:38,785
And I really think that when you left...

1367
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:41,185
you took my heart with you.

1368

Um...

1369
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:56,127
I- I probably should've called first.

1375

She's my R.A.

1376
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:24,689

- No.
