00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:07,142
Patrick! Baby boy.

318
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,423
<i>What you doing here, baby?
[Patrick] Just came to surprise you.</i>

319
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,392
Let me know if you need
something, sir. You look good.

320
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,394
<i>- [Patrick] Hi.
- [Kiss]</i>

321
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,556
<i>How are you? [Clementine] Pretty
good. Pretty bored. Pretty tired.</i>

322
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,566
<i>[Patrick]
Uh-huh.</i>

323
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,762
<i>[Clementine] I so want
what's in your suit. Oh, good.</i>

324
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:33,100
[Panting]

325
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,312
Why?

326
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,874
Why would she do that to me?

327
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,281
Hey, does anybody want a joint?

328
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,953
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.

329
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,962
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.

330
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,964
I know, honey.
For being honest.

331
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,296
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.

332
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,303
<i>No! No, no, no. You don't wanna go
there, man. You don't wanna go there.</i>

333
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,737
Get off. It's too...

334
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,741
<i>Right.
Yeah.</i>

335
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,743
I don't want to seem desperate.

336
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:10,407
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign,
make a clean break. Right?

337
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,610
<i>Right?
[Joel Groans]</i>

338
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,754
<i>All right, Joel,
look, man, seriously.</i>

339
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,757
<i>[Woman] Rob! Here's the deal.</i>

340
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,988
Don't do that. Rob, what are
you doing? No, no, no, no.

341
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,224
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?

342
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,823
You're gonna make this about our
shit now? This isn't about us.

343
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,961
<i>I agree. It's not about us. It's
aboutJoel, who's an adult. Okay?</i>

344
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,029
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

345
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,276
<i>- What are you...
- That's your laundry!</i>

346
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:44,237
<i>That's great. That's good. [Dog Barks]</i>

347
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,250
Okay.

348
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:07,467
<i>What is it? [Rob] I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.</i>

349
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,377
<i>[Woman]
Good morning. Lacuna.</i>

350
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,379
<i>No, I'm sorry. That offer
expired after the new year.</i>

351
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,287
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

352
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,661
How about on the fifth?

353
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:37,133
<i>That's a Wednesday. All right,
great. Could you spell that, please?</i>

354
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,736
<i>Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.</i>

355
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:45,401
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

356
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,411
May I help you?

357
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,414
<i>I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?</i>

358

<i>I'm Joel. Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...</i>

360
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:59,420
- Here. Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.

361
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,482
You still need to fill
the form out, sir. Really?

362
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,654
- Thank you.
- [Mutters] Great.

363
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,663
I don't have a pen.

364
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,825
<i>There's a pen right there.
[Phone Rings]</i>

365
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,835
<i>Good morning. Lacuna.
Oh.</i>

366
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:15,771
<i>Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now.
That expired after the new year.</i>

367
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,831
Mr. Barish?

368
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,145
How are we today?

369
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,147
Not too good, actually.

370
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,149
<i>Boo!
Oh, my God! Stan!</i>

371
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:29,152
Sorry. Sorry, I was just... I'm working!

372
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,519
[Mutters]
Sorry. Sorry.

373
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,582
[Whispers] Here, Doctor. Thank you.

374
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,528
You should not
have seen this.

375
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,587
I apologize.

376
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,902
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...

377
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,804
<i>I assure you, no. [Woman] No.</i>

378
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,976
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.

379
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,680
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

380
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,221
so I can't show you evidence.

381
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:10,023
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

382
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,154
and she wanted to move on.

383
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,164
<i>[Dr. Mierzwiak]

386
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,906
What the hell is that?

387
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,909
Nicest guy

388
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,911
<i>[Rob]
Oww! Fuck!</i>

389
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,413
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

390
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,416
It's okay.
It's all right.

391
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,180
Carrie, I am making
a birdhouse.

392
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,955
<i>What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.</i>

393
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,823
She's impulsive.

394
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:46,455
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

395
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,300
[Sighs]

396
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,302
A lark.

397
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,806
[Sobbing] Why? Why?
Why? Why did you do that?

398
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,140
<i>[Woman]
Wait, wait, wait, wait!</i>

399
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,147
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.

400
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:07,207
Okay. I want it done. I told him
pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.

401
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,652
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.

402
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,657
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.

403
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:17,286
<i>And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs.
Woo. Good-bye, Mrs. Woo. Yes, of course.</i>

404
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,027
Now, the, uh...

405
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:27,037
the first thing
we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

406
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,039
<i>is to go home...</i>

407
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:34,545
<i>and collect everything you own
that has some association with Clementine.</i>

408
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,842
<i>Anything.</i>

409
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:42,548
<i>And we'll use these items to create
a map of Clementine in your brain.</i>

410
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,214
<i>Okay?</i>

411
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:50,353
<i>So we'll need, uh,
uh, photos, clothing, gifts,</i>

412
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:55,388
<i>books she may have bought you,
CDs you may have bought together,</i>

413
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,095
<i>journal entries.</i>

414
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,932
<i>We want to empty your home...</i>

415
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:04,338
<i>We want to empty your life
of Clementine.</i>

416
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,903
<i>And after the mapping is done, our technicians
will do the erasing in your home tonight.</i>

417
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,313
<i>That way, when you awake
in the morning,</i>

418
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:16,820
<i>you'll fixind yourself in your own bed
as if nothing had happened...</i>

419
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,379
<i>a new life awaiting you.</i>

420
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,852
[Tires Screech] [Driver] Wake up, buddy!

421
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,832
<i>[Mary]
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.</i>

422
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:36,067
<i>You can't have the procedure done
three times in one month.</i>

423
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,737
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

424
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,474
<i>Hello. I'm right here.</i>

425
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,747
I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything
we can... We can fit you in on the first of March.

426
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,256
<i>Maybe you could talk to the doctor,
a- and he...</i>

427
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:56,589
<i>All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like to come in this week?</i>

428
00:29:56,661 --> 00:30:00,097
Mr. Barish. Um, he's
really busy this afternoon.

429
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:04,124
<i>Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15? Can you do that?</i>

430
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,071
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

431
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,300
[Chuckles]

432

<i>[Dixieland Jazz]</i>

00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,942
<i>one of our most experienced

He'll be handling

438
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,023
Great to meet you,
Mr. Barish.

439
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,025
My name is Joel Barish,

440
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:33,655
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

441
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:38,759
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.

442
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,362
Uh, I was...

443
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:45,239
living with this woman, Naomi,

444
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,870
uh, a couple years ago,

445
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:53,179
and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to
this party at the beach... I don't like parties.

446
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:56,482
<i>Naomi couldn't go, but I went...</i>

447
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:59,717
<i>and I, uh, met Clementine.</i>

448
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,783
<i>[Pencils Clattering On Floor]
I'm sorry.</i>

449
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,796
Let's start with
your most recent memories...

450
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,459
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

451
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,468
There's an emotional core...

452
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,470
to each of our memories,

453
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,304
and when you eradicate that core
it starts its degradation process.

454
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,809
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

455
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,609
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared,

456
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,706
as in a dream upon waking.

457
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:29,082
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

458
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:32,145
Well, uh, technically speaking,

459
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,157
<i>the procedure is brain damage,</i>

460
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,058
but it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

461
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,062
Nothing you'll miss.

462
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,530
Comfortable?

463
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:47,230
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish,
is actually creating a map of your brain.

464
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,637
<i>[Mierzwiak]
Okay, let's get started.</i>

Tangerine. Joel. Ducks. Quack-quack.

How does he know to call
you that? How did who know?

<i>Oh, my God. Clem? [Mary]
This is pretty cool.</i>

That's what
they called themselves.

The Clash...

They called themselves that
for a reason.

It's amazing, isn't it? Like social

It's beautiful.

You look at a baby, and it's so
pure and so free and so clean.

778
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:21,424
And adults are, like,
this mess of sadness...

I'm lost, I'm scared,

I feel like I'm disappearing.

<i>Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.</i>

Nothing makes any sense. Nothing

Nothing makes any sense.

Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
It's okay. It's okay.

Hey, let's go out dancing. Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?

Montauk?
Yeah.

No! Come up to Boston with me.
Sure. Yeah. We can go next weekend.

No, no. Now. Now.
Yeah. I have to go now.

794
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,548
I have to see

Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.

Don't worry about it. I got it under
