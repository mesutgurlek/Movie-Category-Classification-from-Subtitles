to say 

1298
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,633
 to say 

1299
01:56:48,635 --> 01:56:53,638
 I never looked away 

1300
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:59,211
 I never looked away 

1301
01:56:59,213 --> 01:57:04,950
 and though
I'm feeling you inside 

1302
01:57:04,952 --> 01:57:10,455
 my life is rolling
with the tide 

1303
01:57:10,457 --> 01:57:16,895
 I'd like to see it
be an open ride 

1304
01:57:16,897 --> 01:57:21,900
 along with you 

1305
01:57:21,902 --> 01:57:27,105
 going along with you 

1306
01:57:56,402 --> 01:58:02,074
 the time we borrowed
from ourselves 

1307
01:58:02,076 --> 01:58:06,812
 can't stay
within a vaulted well 

1308
01:58:08,281 --> 01:58:13,952
 and living turns
into a lender's well 

1309
01:58:13,954 --> 01:58:17,923
 so let me come with you 

1310
01:58:19,759 --> 01:58:24,796
 and let me come with you 

1311
01:58:24,798 --> 01:58:30,302
 and when we came out
into view 

1312
01:58:30,304 --> 01:58:35,040
 and there I found myself
with you 

1313
01:58:36,576 --> 01:58:40,378
 when breathing felt like
something new 

1314
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:42,447
 new 

1315
01:58:42,449 --> 01:58:46,151
 along with you 

1316
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:53,291
 going along with you
