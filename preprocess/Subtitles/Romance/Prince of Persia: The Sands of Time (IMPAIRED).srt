And only the holder of the dagger
is aware of what's happened.

- You destroyed my city!

Our invasion wasn't
about weapon forges.

396
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,599
It was about this dagger.

397
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,397
After the battle,
Tus asked for this dagger as tribute.

398
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,317
I didn't think anything of it,
but now I see.

399
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,395
With it he could change anything.

400
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,431
He could change the course
of a critical moment in battle.

401
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,436
He could foresee the blade of a rival.

402
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,714
He wouldn't just be king, he'd be the
most powerful ruler Persia's ever seen.

00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,432

Step aside, Princess.

00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,114
and left his blood on my hands.

Without the right sand,
it's just another knife.

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,948
Not even very sharp.

438
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,876
This sand, is there more of it?

439
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,679
Of course not.

440
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,513
Well, how can I get some?

Try standing on your head

See what you were looking for, Prince?

443
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,713
Start walking.

(EXHALES)

why in the world would he believe you?

It's not your problem, Princess.

448
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,352
You know, you really walk like one.

449
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,238
Head held high, chest out,
long, stomping strides.

450
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,873
The walk of a self-satisfied
Persian prince.

451
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,758
No doubt it comes from being told
since birth the world is yours,

452
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,279
(SCOFFS) and actually believing it.

453
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,356
I wasn't born in a palace like you.

454
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,597
I was born in the slums of Nasaf,

455
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,949
where I lived if I fought
and I clawed for it.

456
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,557
Then how did you become a prince?

457
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,388
The King marched into the market
one day, and he...

458
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,313
I don't know. He...

459
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,233
He found me.

460
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,958
He took me in. He gave me a family.
He gave me a home.

461
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,359
What you're looking at

462
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,472

who just lost everything.

463

DASTAN: Welcome to
the Valley of the Slaves, Your Highness.

464
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,836
I'm desperate for a drop of water.

465
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,633
That's more than we have, since you
emptied our canteen hours ago.

466
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,795
I wasn't born of this desert
like you Persians,

467
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,432
all shrivelled and angry.

468
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,836
My constitution is much more delicate.

469
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,918
I think you mean "spoiled."

470
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,999
The wells of Alamut are famed
for their clean, cold water.

471
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,079
Perhaps less time admiring your wells
and more time guarding your walls,

472
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,919
and you wouldn't be here.

473
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,995
(LAUGHS)

474
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,950
Ah! A miracle!

475
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,277
I've silenced the Princess!

476
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,795
Tamina?

477
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,635
Tamina?

478
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,075
Can you hear me?

479
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,269

Persian!

639
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,235
Dastan!

640
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,389
(GRUNTING)

641
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,029
Persian!

642
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,389
(GRUNTING)

643
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,878
Looking for this? Key? Huh?

644
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,395
Oops!

645
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,399
Next time, you!

646
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,635
(YELLS)

647
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,798
They've all come for my father's funeral.

648
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,995
(URGES HORSE)

649
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,520
TAMINA: There are 100 Persian soldiers
watching that gate.

650
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,314
Maybe more.
If you want to stay close to this dagger,

651
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,998
you're going to have
to help me into Avrat.

652
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,311
All these foreign dignitaries,

653
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,471
I'm guessing you know a few.

654
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,875
Couldn't you have found
somebody lighter?

655
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,516
The Mughals of the Hindu Kush
are a noble people.

656
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,152
You should be honoured.

657
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,632
Oh, yes. Terribly.

658
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,153
Dastan, where's the dagger?

659
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,236
You're welcome to search me for it.

660
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,157
You'll have to be very thorough.

661
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,193
Tus isn't here.
He must still be in Alamut.

662
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,595
The sand that fuels the dagger,

663
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,676
there's more of it hidden
somewhere in Alamut, isn't there?

664
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,558
That's why Tus stays there.

665
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,995
That's what he's got our army
searching for.

666
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,156
I have to get a message
to my uncle to meet me.

667
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,074
That's impossible.

668
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,355
(MAN SHOUTING
IN LOCAL LANGUAGE)

669
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,479
Difficult, not impossible.

670
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,839
Or more proof you're insane.

671
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,757
Then why do you look so impressed?

672
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,911
Out of the way! Make way!

673
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,188
- Oh!
- Oh!

674
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,955
- Turn around.
- What?

675
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,035
Turn around!

676
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,075
You used to buy those for me
when I was a boy.

677
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,755
You used to spit the seeds at Garsiv.

678
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,391
You should not have
brought me here, Dastan.

679
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,828
I had no choice, Uncle.

680
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,235
Follow me.

681
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,119
I didn't kill Father.

682
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,393
You know I would never do
such a thing.

683
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,271
Your actions speak otherwise.

684
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,151
But I had no choice but to flee.

685
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,277
Tus gave me that cloak.

686
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,192
- He was the one who poisoned it.
- Dastan.

687
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,673
Well, he's not here, is he?

688
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,836
At his father's funeral.
Instead, he remains in Alamut.

689
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,155
Our allies will see our invasion was just.

690
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,430
The search for
Alamut's weapons forges is important.

691
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,436
Yes, but not if there are none.

692
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,911
The invasion of Alamut was a lie.

693
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,873
Tus is after power.
That's why he murdered Father.

694
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,912
And now he searches not for weapons,

695
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,475
but for the sand
that fuels a mystical device.

696
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,954
This is why you brought me here,
Dastan? Mystical devices?

697
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,069
Do you remember, after the battle,

698
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,076
you stopped Tus
from taking the dagger I'd won?

699
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,155
Mmm-hmm.

700
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,158
That dagger is the reason
he invaded Alamut.

701
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,638
This dagger, you have it with you?

702
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,594
Yes.

703
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,798
It has incredible powers.

704
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,790
Is this some sort of a joke, Dastan?

705
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,431
What? No, it was in there.

706
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,879
Then where's your so-called evidence?

707
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,039
Tamina.

708
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,675
I...

709
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,030
(STAMMERING)

710
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,479
Your hands are burned.

711
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,315
Yes.

712
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,393
From trying to pull
the poisoned cloak off your father.

713
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,954
- Is something wrong, Dastan?
- No, no.

714
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,195
You're certain?
You know you can trust me, boy.

715
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,712
It's just that, uh,

716
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,593
Tus is my brother.

717
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,997
How could he betray me like this?

718
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,235
I can't say, Dastan. Perhaps he

719
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,832
never respected you as you deserve,

720
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,632
only saw you as someone he could use.

721
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,398
Someone to keep his wine glass filled?

722
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,396
My service to your father was different.

723
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,556
We shared the same blood, Dastan.

724
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,991
How many times did Father speak
of you saving him from that lion?

725
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,919
- That was his favourite story.
- One of many, yes.

726
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,718
- (CEILING CREAKING)
- No, that was his favourite.

727
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,990
I'm afraid you're
speaking in riddles, Dastan.

728
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,914
Wait! Dastan!

729
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,474
(CROWD CLAMOURING)

730
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,715
Over here!

731
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,033
GARSIV: Murderer!

732
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,592
I didn't kill Father!

733
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,079
(ROARING)

734
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,719
DASTAN: Out of the way!
Get out of the way!
