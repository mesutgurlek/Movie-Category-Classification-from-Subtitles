I'm bigger,

It's like we're really flying.

Adolf Hitler...

00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,077
builds the German
military machine...

79
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,205
and drags
all of Europe into war.

80
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,624
But even while France
falls to Hitler...

81

America still refuses
to join the fighting.

chicken with you.

Now don't be a baby.
I'll tell you what--

88
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,535
- I'm not doing it, Rafe.
- Well, I'm coming right at you.

89
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,286
You can turn, or you can hit me.
It's up to you.

Which way you goin'?

94
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,345
I guess I'll go right.
No, uh, left. I'll go left.

95
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,932
OK, we're goin' left, right?

96
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,308
RAFE: Ri--uh, right. Right?

97
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,394
Right like we're goin' right,
or right like we're goin' left?

98
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,020
Well, now you got me
all mixed up!

99
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,064
I don't know.
Make up your mind.

100
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,361
God, Rafe, we're going right!

00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,081
Those are some smooth aces.

105
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,250
Did you say something?

106
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,544
'Cause let me tell ya,
those farm boys are grounded!

107
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,879
Yes, sir, an entirely
unacceptable use...

108
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,632
of m-m-military aircraft, sir.

109
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,552
- Get my hat.
- Yes, sir.

110
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,638
Get those hedge-hoppers
in Doolittle's office.

111
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,057
After two years of training...

112
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,435
you believe that
a $45,000 airplane...

113
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,978
is there for your amusement?

114
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,271
RAFE: No, sir.
I was just trying...

115
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,606
to keep my edge, Major.

116
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,482
And when you did
the outside loop last week...

117
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,985
what did you think that was?
Honing your skills?

118
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,278
DOOLITTLE:
That's not training, McCawley.

119
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,571
That's a stunt.

120
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,907
And I personally
consider it to be reckless...

121
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,452
and irresponsible.

122
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,703
Major...

123
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,665
How could that be,
when you're famous...

124
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,417
for being the first man
in the world ever to do it?

125
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,585
Don't get cute with me, son.

126
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,129
No, sir, I don't mean
to be disrespectful.

127
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,924
I just think that--
well, I--

128
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,175
It is reckless
and irresponsible...

129
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,468
if you're just doing it
to be a show-off.

130
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,180
But I was doing it to try
to inspire the men, sir...

131
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,556
in the way that
you've inspired me.

132
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,725
I believe the French
even have a word for that...

133
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,602
when the men get together
to honor their leaders.

134
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,978
They call it an homage, sir.

135
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,897
- A what?
- An homage, sir.

136
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,607
That's bullshit, McCawley!

137
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,988
But it's very,
very good bullshit.

138
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,239
Thank you, sir.

139
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,992
[Clicking teeth]

140
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,704
McCawley, you remind me
of myself fifteen years ago.

141
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,748
Which is why we need
to discuss this.

142
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,792
Have a seat, son.

143
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,302
The British have accepted you
into the Eagle Squadron.

144
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,763
You're on your way
to England tomorrow...

145
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,932
if you still want to go.

146
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,476
Huh. Wow.

147
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,478
Just a few British pilots
are all that stand...

148
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,855
between Hitler
and total victory in Europe.

149
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,941
They're gonna need
all the help they can get.

150
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,401
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm on my way.

151
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,820
Just for the record...

152
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,738
I'm supposed to ask you
to reconsider.

153
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,323
Sir?

154
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,367
Sooner or later
we're gonna be in this war...

155
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,369
whether we like it or not.

156
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,746
And I'm gonna need
all of my best pilots.

157
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,624
So it's my duty
to ask you to stay.

158
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,836
Major, what would you do?

159
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,881
If it was me...

160
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,177
I'd go.

161
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,596
Get out. Am I going bald
right back here?

162
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,806
Ooh!

163
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,101
Man, I am one good-lookin'
son of a bitch.

164
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,769
Don't you ever die.

165
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,439
[Snaps fingers]
Die. That's exactly...

166
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,525
the concept
you gotta work tonight.

167
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:49,029
You put a drop of this clove oil
under your eyes...

168
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,072
and you let 'em sting
and well up.

169
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,492
You get your nurse alone,
take a breath...

170
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,911
let her see your eyes glisten...

171
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:01,416
and say, "Baby,
they're training me for war...

172
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,377
"and I don't know
what'll happen...

173
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,672
"but if I die tomorrow,
I want to know...

174
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,718
"that we lived
all we could tonight."

175
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,720
Come on, guys!
We got nurses waitin'.

176
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,556
PILOT: Come on, before the rest
of his hair falls out.

177
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,101
How could you do this?

178
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,644
Well, Doolittle assigned me.

179
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,939
He wanted me to get some real--
real combat training in.

180
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,149
Well, guess what?

181
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,401
It's not training over there.
It's war.

182
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,695
Where the losers die,
and there aren't any winners--

183
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:31,905
just guys who turn
into broken-down wrecks...

184
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,114
like my father.

185
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,407
Yeah, I understand that, Danny.

186
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,742
But I feel like
I got a duty to go.

187
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,827
Don't preach to me
about duty, damn it.

188
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,746
I wear the same uniform you do.

189
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,582
Now, if trouble wants me,
I'm ready for it.

190
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,792
But why go looking for it?

191
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,919
God, Danny, come on.

192
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,379
I'm gonna be twenty-five.
I might as well be an old man.

193
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,465
They're gonna have me bein'
a flight instructor.

194
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,967
I don't wanna teach
loops and barrel rolls.

195
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,302
I wanna be a combat fighter.

196
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,512
PILOT: Hey, come on!

197
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,723
The nurses can't
d-d-dance by themselves.

198
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,517
Let's go.

199
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,021
[Whistle blows]

200
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,362
WOMAN: If the call of duty
means seeing 150 men...

201
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,905
in their underwear every day...

202
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,240
we are here to serve.

203
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,449
[Giggling]

204
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,659
I can't believe it.

205
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,744
Saturday night
in New York City.

206
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,454
Do you know what they're doing
where I come from?

207
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,914
Nothing.

208
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,749
Cow-tipping.

209
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, that's why
you joined the Navy, hon'.

210
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,294
To get out of that dusty
little town and see the world.

211
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,964
May I remind you, Barbara,
we're Navy nurses, not tourists.

212
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,800
I joined to do
my patriotic duty and...

213
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,052
to meet guys.

214
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,512
Me, too.

215
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,305
Girls, we're gonna have
so much fun tonight in the city.

216
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,849
You've gotta tell them
the story, Evelyn.

217
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,851
What?

218
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,060
Oh, come on. Tell us.

219
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,645
Oh, it's such a long story.

220
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,689
We got time.

221
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,566
I saw it happen.

222
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,359
EVELYN: Well, it was
about four weeks ago...

223
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:51,818
EVELYN: Well, it was
about four weeks ago...

224
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,945
What do you think
is b-b-better?

225
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,364
All in the one cheek,
or spreading them out?

226
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:58,825
OK.

227
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,202
Fusco, Anthony.

228
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,834
You all right, buddy?

229
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,086
Sweetie, do you really
have to do this?

230
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,172
I'm not gonna get yellow fever
in my barracks.

231
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,259
No? If you'd rather,
she can do it.

232
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,763
[Inhales sharply]

233
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,183
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just gimme a minute.

234
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,519
[Sighs] Honey, the government
says stick 'em, we stick 'em.

235
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,770
Uh!

236
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,191
RAFE: Hey, Red, you allright?

237
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,989
EVELYN: Eye exam number four?

238
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,659
MAN: Listen, Doc, I have passed
a dozen medical checks.

239
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,912
You write that,
they won't let me fly.

240
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,456
Sorry, son.

241
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,916
I'm gonna fail.

242
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,542
They're gonna
take my wings away.

243
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,878
No, they won't. Just relax.

244
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,463
Read the bottom line, please.

245
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,881
Just keep practicin'
the bottom line.

246
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,716
And don't worry.
I'm right behind you.

247
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,552
J-L-M-K-P-O--

248
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,512
[Muttering]

249
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,016
Next.

250
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,476
Ma'am.

251
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,523
J-L-M-K-P-O-E-T-X.

252
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,025
Eyes like an eagle, ma'am.

253
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,944
Slow down, flyboy.

254
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,738
And, instead of the bottom,
read the very top. Both eyes.

255
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,908
Yeah.

256
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,411
"C"--sorry, "J."

257
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,413
Ahem. "C"...

258
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,706
- [Whispering] "W."
- "W."

259
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,000
- "Q."
- Uh, "Q."

260
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,752
RAFE: Uh, "'Q."'

261
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,507
Read the bottom line
again, please.

262
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,594
But read it right to left
and every other letter.

263
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,936
"E."

264
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,563
Heh. "'X."'

265
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,941
- [Whispering] X-E.
- X-E.

266
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,402
RAFE: X-E, ma'am.

267
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,071
Ma'am, I know how this looks.

268
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,781
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
I really am.

269
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,950
But Army and Navy
requires 20/20 vision.

270
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,661
Oh, i--it's--it's not
a problem with my eyes.

271
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,954
I mean, I can see.

272
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,789
I mean, I can hit a running
rabbit with a $3.00 pistol.

273
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,374
I got a problem with letters,
that's all.

274
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,001
Well, maybe after
some schooling...

275
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,669
you could come back
and take the test again.

276
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,962
No, I had schooling.

277
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,338
I mean, I--the teachers
just never knew...

278
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,340
what to make of it.
It's just letters.

279
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,883
I mix 'em up sometimes.
That's all.

280
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,262
I mean, I just get 'em
backward sometimes.

281
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,765
L-look here. Uh, my--my math
and--and spacial reasoning...

282
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,183
and my verbal scores
are all excellent.

283
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,060
But you barely passed
the written exam.

284
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,271
Yeah, but he did pass it.
So, is it my turn now?

285
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,649
- No, you'll wait your turn.
- Yes, ma'am.

286
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,901
Ma'am, I-I'm never gonna
be an English teacher.

287
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,446
But I know why I'm here.

288
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,989
To be a pilot.

289
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,699
And you don't dogfight
with manuals.

290
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,743
You don't fly with gauges.

291
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,077
I mean, it's all about
feeling and speed...

292
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,495
and lettin' that plane
become like a part...

293
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,122
of your body.
And that manual...

294
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,458
says that a guy who's a slow
reader can't be a good pilot.

295
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,543
That file says I'm
the best pilot in this room.

296
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:04,510
Ma'am, please,
don't take my wings.

297
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,972
Well, I felt so bad.

298
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,767
Evelyn, rotate to station three.

299
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,143
EVELYN: I had no choice.

300
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,187
I passed him.

301
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,563
- Good.
- Uh-huh.

302
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,566
EVELYN: So, then this
cocky pilot comes back.

303
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,860
- Say, fella, are you enlisted?
- Yeah.

304
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,029
"Yeah"? Boy,
you're talking to an officer.

305
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,363
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

306
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,698
- Give me that file.
- Yes, sir.

307
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,076
- Parade rest.
- Yes, sir.

308
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,869
Ma'am, I didn't get
a chance to thank you.

309
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,120
Drop your skivvies.

310
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,207
Ah, oh, OK.

311
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,043
Just like this?

312
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,920
That's fine.

313
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,672
EVELYN: He did have
a very cute butt.

314
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,216
You know, I know
you didn't have to pass me...

315
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,550
and you did. And I just--

316
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,387
I didn't think
you'd understand, and you did.

317
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,098
You know, you still
haven't said thank you.

318
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,307
Thank you.

319
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,392
You're welcome.

320
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,437
Why'd you do it?
I mean, I'm just curious.

321
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,231
You're like my hero now.

322
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,066
Actually, my father was a pilot.

323
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,443
And, um, I've seen
first-hand what happens...

324
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,112
when a pilot loses his wings.

325
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,321
You know what?

326
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,698
Your father's my hero,
then, too.

327
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:11,285
Infact, as an officer,
I think it'd by my duty...

328
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,746
to take my new hero's
daughter out tonight...

329
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,082
Just to--aah!

330
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,458
Gosh, did I poke too deep?

331
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,169
I think you hit the bone there.

332
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,587
[All giggling]

333
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,005
You are so mean.

334
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,216
[Sighs]

335
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,927
What? So is--
is there any chance...

336
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,221
that you might,
kind of, sort of...

337
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,890
you know, like me, or...

338
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:37,145
Oh, how did you guess?

339
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,729
[Whispering]
They never taught us...

340
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,274
how to deal with this...
feeling.

341
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,570
Wh-what feeling?

342
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,948
Well, it's kind of like... this.

343
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,616
Ow!

344
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,411
Well, he was getting fresh,
so I poked him again.

345
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,745
[All giggling]

346
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:58,082
All right, Romeo.
I want to get this over with.

347
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,334
Hold on a second.

348
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,460
Miss...

349
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,880
I really, really lick you.

350
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,840
[Gasps]

351
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,466
What did he mean?

352
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,218
Like you.

353
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,511
I didn't mean to say that.

354
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,804
And I just, um...

355
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,307
I just want to ask you, please,
if I can donate dinner.

356
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,434
EVELYN: He started
to act very strange.

357
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,520
Or, well, buy you dinner.

358
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,147
This isn't your chart.

359
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,274
Whoa.

360
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:27,361
No. That's the, uh, this,
uh, fellow over here's.

361
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,571
I think he left.

362
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,281
Have you already had this shot?

363
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,201
Yeah, well, once... already.

364
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,996
Well, I wanted--
I mean, can I ask you out?

365
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,081
- No!
- [Groans]

366
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,292
And he just went wham!

367
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,921
Unh! [Groans]

368
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,714
Oh! What'd you do to him?

369
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,340
Oh! What'd you do to him?

370
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,051
- Poor guy.
- [Giggles]

371
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,761
[Chattering]

372
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,430
Hey!

373
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,432
Hey!

374
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,892
Oh, my God.
Are you OK?

375
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,102
Uh, yeah.

376
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,646
I'm fine. I feel great.

377
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:06,150
This is just standard
precautionary... thing.

378
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,654
Look, I got some, uh,
genuine French champagne...

379
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,947
from France.

380
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,699
I thought, you know,
maybe we could celebrate.

381
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,076
Celebrate what?

382
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,914
Oh, I don't know. Uh, well,
you being my hero, for one.

383
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,211
OK. Why not?

384
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,798
So, uh, ahem...

385
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,299
I wanted to thank you.

386
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,134
And I just wanted to, uh...

387
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,720
put your mind at ease
about passing me...

388
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,890
because I really do think
you did this country a service.

389
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,352
I mean, I'm--
I am a great flier.

390
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,397
And if you have a fault,
which you obviously don't...

391
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,066
it's modesty.

392
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:51,028
No. If I have a fault,
it's candor.

393
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,490
You are just so--

394
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,576
[Gasps]

395
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,662
Uhh. Cork just got away from me.

396
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,919
[Groans]

397
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,504
[Chuckles]

398
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,089
God, oh, it hurts.

399
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,843
It hurts something fierce.

400
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,094
I'm sorry.

401
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,679
- Ohh...
- Oh, it's bleeding.

402
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,848
- God.
- Oh!

403
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,933
- Ohh!
- Lay still.

404
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,143
I ruined everything.

405
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,561
- Lay still.
- Oh, it hurts.

406
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,730
- Ow! It's cold.
- It'll stop the bleeding.

407
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,398
Yeah. I can't breathe.

408
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,026
- Lay still.
- [Sighs]

409
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,282
You are so beautiful it hurts.

410
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,452
It's your nose that hurts.

411
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,913
No. I think it's my heart.

412
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,382
EVELYN: And then I kissed him.

413
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,926
MARTHA: Oh, Evelyn.

414
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,637
That's the most romantic story
I ever heard.

415
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:04,268
It's been the most romantic four
weeks and two days of my life.

416
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,145
Oh, I'm so jealous.

417
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,163
[Giggling]

418
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,874
Hello, Lieutenant.

419
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,251
- It's good to see you.
- You, too, Lieutenant.

420
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,504
Pick a hand.

421
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,218
It's beautiful.

422
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,055
What's in your other hand?

423
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,598
Mine.

424
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,561
Well, it took me six hours
to fold these.

425
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,356
Oh!

426
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,858
[Laughs]

427
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,944
I want you to meet my friends.

428
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,197
Rafe, this is Martha,
Barbara, Sandra--

429
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,033
- Hi. I'm Betty.
- Hi.

430
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,369
Would you happen
to have any friends?

431
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:06,789
Huh. Take your pick.

432
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,457
Hi.

Whoo!

436
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,234
We ever get in this war
and somethin' happens to me...

437
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:39,280
I can't tell you how good
it makes me feel to know...

438
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,782
that someone as sweet
as you will be there...

439
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,534
to nurse me back to health.

440
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,953
Good, but we're not
in the war yet.

441
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,539
- Ahem.
- OK. That was a bad line.

442
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,916
- Hi.
- [Laughing]

443
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,586
I'm--I'm Red.

444

Red-- [Snorting]
S-s-s-s-strange.

Heh heh.
Your last name's Strange?

446
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,553
Yeah. She's all yours, soldier.

No. It--it's Winkle.

[Laughs]

449
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,517
Red is such a ladies' man.

450
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,727
Do you always stutter?

451
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,522
No. Only when I'm--
[Snorting]

452
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,774
She's totally buying it.

453
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,776
- Nervous?
- Yeah.

454
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,486
Why can't I get
something like that?

455
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,995
Hello.

456
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,622
Hi.

457
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,249
Danny seems kind of shy
around the girls.

458
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,753
Tsk. It's not that he's shy.

459
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,087
He's just, ahem...

460
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,590
a little unsure of himself,
you know.

461
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,550
His old man used to
run him down a lot.

462
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:45,304
Get him in a plane,
he's sure of himself.

463
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,598
He's like my brother.
He's like my best friend.

464
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,309
He's my right hand.

465
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:54,814
Which at the moment is
a long way south of my waist.

466
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,482
Oh, I'm sorry.

467
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,151
I guess I lost
a little altitude.

468
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,195
Yeah, I guess you did.

469
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,738
Excuse me.

470
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,713
You and me, we got to talk.

471
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:23,384
So, the rumor is the Navy's
shipping us to Pearl Harbor.

472
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,427
Well, won't be so bad.

473
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,097
It's about as far from
the fighting as you can get.

474
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,015
You'll get a sun tan.

475
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,686
So maybe the Army'll
post you guys there, too.

476
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,815
You... are a super special woman.

477
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,275
And, and, well...

[Sniffs]

479
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,736
Well, they're--
they're training me...

480
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,950
to be a big bad warrior,
and, well...

481
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,496
So, I mean, you never know
what might happen tomorrow...

482
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:58,085
or... or any day
after that, you know?

483
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,671
So...

484
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,841
God, we need to make
tonight super special.

485
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,510
Why are you crying?

486
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,220
I guess it's the thought...

487
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,723
that I might not ever
get to see you again.

488
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,516
Dry your eyes, toots.

489
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,726
Tonight, you're mine.

490
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,936
I don't want to be
with a crowd tonight.

491
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,564
I just want to be
alone with you.

492
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,566
Well...

493
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,485
How does New York Harbor
by moonlight sound?

494
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,738
Ohh! Heh heh!

495
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,282
EVELYN: Are you gonna be
a bad influence?

496
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,784
Of course I'm a bad influence.

497
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,786
Let's see if we can
commandeer this vessel...

498
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,080
'cause we're, uh, officers
of the U.S. Government.

499
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,874
Not for long, we won't be.

500
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,262
One day, we'll take a trip
on a boat like that.

501
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,680
Would you like that?

502
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:55,934
We'll be dressing for cocktails
and walk into the grandsalon.

503
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,603
No one's talking about war.

504
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,939
They're just dancing
to Cole Porter.

505
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,608
- I'll have to get a tux.
- Yeah.

506
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,740
Come on. There you go.
All aboard.

507
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,867
- You're out of your mind.
- Oh, yeah.

508
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,243
Careful now.
Here, sit down.

509
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,455
Now let's see here.

510
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,169
Ah! There we go.

511
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,882
See, this is as close as I
could get you to your ship.

512
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,093
So, at least I tried, right?

513
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,013
Actually, you know what?
This is better.

514
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,932
Yeah, it is.

515
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,476
God, you're pretty.

516
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,456
What's gonna become
of us all, Rafe?

517
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:05,963
Well, the future's not
exactly in our hands, is it?

518
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,674
No. I guess you're right.

519
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,558
[Both screaming]

520
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,394
- Aah!
- Aah!

521
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,021
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

522
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,356
Yeah, are you?

523
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,025
That was not part of the date.

524
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,198
[Evelyn giggles]

525
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,366
RAFE: Watch your step.

526
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,036
[Laughs] Oh, thank you.

527
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,370
BARBARA: Evelyn!

528
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,123
Guys, come up! Come on up!

529
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,084
Come up! We're in 321.

530
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,086
There's something
I got to tell you.

531
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,297
Well, you got no secrets
from me, Lieutenant.

532
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,923
I've seen your medical chart.

533
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,425
Here we go.

534
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,385
[Sighs]

535
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:00,726
This can't be good, or it
wouldn't be so hard to say.

536
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,352
[Sighs] Yep.

537
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,855
I got to go away.

538
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,357
We're all going away.

539
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,193
Yeah...

540
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,905
but I'm going to the war...
tomorrow.

541
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,908
I'm flying with
the Eagle Squadron.

542
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:20,245
It's an outfit the British
started for American pilots.

543
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:24,374
I don't understand.

544
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,377
You're in the U.S. Army.
How could they order you to go?

545
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,880
They didn't order me.

546
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,049
I volunteered.

547
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,970
Huh.

548
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,223
But I passed you.

549
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,975
I let you through.

550
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,727
And now you volunteer...

551
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,896
for the most dangerous place
you could go?

552
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,942
It's not your responsibility,
not your choice.

553
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,861
Flying's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.

554
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:57,241
I mean, everything in my life
has led me up to this point.

555
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,620
Meeting you.

556
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,458
I love you.

557
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,710
[Sighs]

558
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,921
I love you so much.

559
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,759
RAFE: Let's go inside.

560
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,727
All right. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

561
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,437
Just--I--I can't do this.

562
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:31,191
This just--it's not right.
I'm sorry. I just--

563
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,734
See, I can't do this.

564
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,863
I mean, I mean, I can.
I--I want to.

565
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,782
I'm not trying to be noble,
you know.

566
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,034
Or not saying
I know what would happen...

567
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,162
or just--
I need to stop talking.

568
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,038
I just--I just don't want--

569
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,832
I just don't want it
to be like everybody else.

570
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,876
I don't want you to have
anything about tonight...

571
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,752
that you regret.

572
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:54,173
I mean, it's been the most
incredible night of my life...

573
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,592
and I don't want to ruin that.

574
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,635
Oh, you couldn't ruin it.

575
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:05,976
If I had one more night to live,
I'd want to spend it with you.

576
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,352
[Sighs]

577
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,730
See, that's what I want
to come home to.

578
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,192
That's what I want to have
to think about and dream about.

579
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,861
I want to know that
the best part of my life...

580
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,779
is still ahead of me.

581
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,532
Look.

582
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:26,371
Don't, um... could you...
not come see me off?

583
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,958
Because, uh... saying good-bye
to you once is hard enough.

584
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,422
[Whispering] Here.

585
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,218
Take this.

586
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,887
Why?
You think it looks good on me?

587
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,722

589
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,393
I will come back.

590
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,182
I thought you said
you told her not to come.

591
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,517
Yeah, I did.

592
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,269
Why you looking for her then?

593
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,021
It's my test.

594
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,190
If I tell her not to come,
and she comes anyway...

595
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,609
then I--I know she loves me.

596
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,903
All aboard! Track 57!

597
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,536
If, uh, anything
happens to me...

598
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,955
I want you to be the one
to tell her.

599
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,540
All right?

600
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,293
You just make sure and come back
for the both of us, all right?

601
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,838
OK.

603
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,935
Yeah.

Good.

We'll get you settled
into your quarters.

625
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,704
And then introduce you
to the crate you'll be flying.

to get themselves killed,

the world is not at war?

What they really need
are tanks, planes...

Hitler and his Nazit hugs...

How many sailors per ship?

657
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,048
It depends.
More on a battleship than a sub.

But say, on average... 2,000?

659

Then there's the flyers,
the marines, base personnel.

00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:46,950
Can I get a minute?

970
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,412
What's the matter, you sick?

971
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,749
Can a guy propose?!

972
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:57,419
Oh! Thank you!

973
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,296
DANNY: Am I talking too much?

974
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,965
Sometimes I do that, I'm sorry.

975
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,260
BARBARA: Hold up!

976
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:06,970
Look at this.

977
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:08,597
Hello!

978
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,183
OK, let's get out of here.

979
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,434
OK.

980
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,564
I guess I should go.

981
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,317
Don't let it be three months
before I see you again.

982
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,735
I had a good time.

983
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,070
Yeah, me, too.

984
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,490
Do you want me
to walk you home?

985
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,158
No, I'll be fine.

986
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,118
No... of course.

987
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:32,329
- Good night.
- Good night.

988
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,553
I was just wondering if maybe
I could come by some time...

989
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:50,347
get a cup of coffee
or a piece of pie?

990
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,141
What am I doing?

991
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,019
OK.

992
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,567
Oh! You were asleep. I'm sorry.

993
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,360
Danny?

994
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,695
Is something wrong?

995
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,864
No! Nothing's wrong.
No problem. Hi!

996
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,491
It's just Danny.

997
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,493
I... just... you...

998
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,662
you forgot this.

999
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:17,875
Oh... thanks.

1000
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,835
It was good of you
to take the trouble...

1001
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,879
to drop it over... now.

1002
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,381
I... well, I thought
you might need it.

1003
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:27,301
You know...
maybe tomorrow morning.

1004
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,552
If...

1005
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,345
not that you wear this
to work, but...

1006
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,389
No... it's a hankie.

1007
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,644
Right, right. Yeah.

1008
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:44,318
Listen, I was thinking maybe...
I could come by some time...

1009
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,029
if I gave you a call,
could I come by?

1010
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,867
Once, maybe...
if you're not busy?

1011
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,202
Yeah, maybe.

1012
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:56,788
- Maybe?
- Maybe.

1013
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,081
OK, all right.

1014
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,000
Thanks.

1015
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,251
Good-bye. Good night.

1016
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:02,836
You are such an idiot!

1017
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,551
Did you have fun last night?

1018
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,054
It wasn't how it looked.

1019
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,972
And if it was,
it'd be all right.

1020
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,058
It's been months.
It's time to move on.

1021
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,893
I am moving on.

1022
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,478
BETTY: Ev, don't lie.

1023
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:22,064
All I know is, I hear you crying
when you think I'm asleep.

1024
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,149
When my dad left...

1025
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,401
I was too much
for my mom to handle...

1026
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,445
so she sent me
to live with my aunt.

1027
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,489
I thought my life was over...

1028
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,075
But you don't know
where it's all gonna lead.

1029
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,410
If I hadn't run away
and lied about my age...

1030
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:36,745
and enlisted in the Navy...

1031
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,456
I wouldn't have met Red, and...

1032
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,291
now he's my fiance.

1033
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,587
Oh, God, I can't
get used to that word.

1034
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,798
- It's only been twelve hours.
- Oh, Betty!

1035
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,591
Little Betty
beat us all to the post.

1036
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:50,842
MARTHA: And this is ward three.

1037
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,428
As you can see, no patients.

1038
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,806
Welcome to Hawaii.
Come on, I'll show you the bar.

1039
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,975
Sandra, new recruits to torture.

1040
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:59,851
Come on. Excuse me, ladies?

1041
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,103
Hi!

1042
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,690
We're gonna wait two years
until I'm nineteen...

1043
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,316
and Red can buy me a ring.

1044
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,360
[Laughs]

1045
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,029
Rafe sent his best friend
to tell you...

1046
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:14,116
so you would be OK,
so you can move on.

1047
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,452
You gotta go on living, Ev.

1048
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:25,794
Red!

1049
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,880
Whoo! Sorry!

1050
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,649
[Whispers] Bye, Rafe.

1051
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,029
VICEADMIRAL:
The Japanese Fleet is missing.

1052
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,948
They're operating
under radio silence.

1053
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:59,578
This footage was shot
four days ago on October 28th.

1054
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,584
OFFICER: We're sending
scout planes in wider vectors...

1055
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,086
all over the Pacific,
but they get nothing.

1056
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,380
They could be anywhere in here.

1057
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:13,550
I don't understand how
two whole carrier divisions...

1058
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,094
can just disappear.

1059
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,976
Clear!

1060
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,196
Aw, we're all over the page.

1061
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,072
We got one wall-eyed
and one pigeon-toed.

1062
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:38,784
Anthony, tap in number six.
All right.

1063
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,827
Gooz, tap in number three.

1064
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,162
All right.

1065
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:45,207
Hey. We got a visitor.

1066
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,210
Oh... that ain't
no Navy issue uniform, eh?

1067
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,045
BILLY: Danny, it's Evelyn.

1068
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,588
Jesus!

1069
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,216
You allright?

1070
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,218
Yeah. Yeah.

1071
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,886
No.

1072
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:00,430
I think I'm fallin' for her.

1073
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,265
Wow. You know,
I saw this coming.

1074
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:03,642
[Chuckles]

1075
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,268
I didn't want this to happen.

1076
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:07,354
It just kind of did.
Can't help it.

1077
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:08,980
Well, Danny,
she's gotta be with somebody.

1078
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,565
It might as well be you.

1079
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:11,858
You telling me
if you were dead...

1080
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,902
and you saw your best buddy
doin' your girl...

1081
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:16,530
you wouldn't come back and beat
the living crap outta him?

1082
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,032
- Tony, back off.
- I'd be back so fast.

1083
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:21,785
Danny's being a better friend
taking care of her himself.

1084
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,787
I got a girlfriend.

1085
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,417
That's great.

1086
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,795
Come on, fellas.
Let's split.

1087
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:35,132
Danny, whatever happens now
is just about you and her.

1088
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:37,300
You gotta try
and forget about Rafe.

1089
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,469
GOOZ: Be careful, allright?

1090
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:42,597
Ladies... cloud the mind.

1091
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,684
- Thanks, Gooz.
- You're welcome.

1092
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,478
Hey, Danny.

1093
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,524
Where's everybody going?

1094
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,695
Just bein' discreet.

1095
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,655
Does it seem like everybody's
acting a little strange?

1096
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,448
No. Nah.

1097
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:01,825
Right.

1098
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:06,621
Well, maybe--maybe a little.
Yeah.

1099
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,665
Well, people in this outfit...

1100
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,834
have way too much time
on their hands.

1101
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,210
Oh, yeah.

1102
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:13,503
I just hope they don't think
there's been something...

1103
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:14,880
goin' on between us,
that's all.

1104
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,382
Oh, no. I mean, no.
That would be...

1105
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,842
embarrassing, right?

1106
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:20,385
Forgot my wrenches.

1107
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,970
That would definitely
be embarrassing.

1108
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,430
Yeah.

1109
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,682
Ha. Forgot my wrenches.

1110
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,894
Hey. He really
doesn't have to leave.

1111
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:30,478
No.

1112
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:34,482
I, uh, I'm just goin'
out with the girls, so...

1113
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:37,402
I guess I'll see you later.

1114
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,696
- Yeah.
- All right.

1115
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,531
Yeah, all right.
I'll see you around.

1116
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,201
Shit.

1117
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,203
Evelyn.

1118
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,331
Have you ever seen
Pearl Harbor at sunset?

1119
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,374
Of course.

1120
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,793
Well... from the air?

1121
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,550
You know, I could get kicked
out of the military for this.

1122
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:03,053
- Really?
- Yeah. Stay down.

1123
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:24,908
DANNY: The Hawaiians called
this harbor Wai Momi.

1124
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,785
It means "water of pearls."

1125
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,495
It's so beautiful.

1126
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,248
My dad took me up
a couple of times.

1127
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:32,707
Just don't do what he did.

1128
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,334
What do you call it
when you flip over?

1129
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,543
DANNY: A barrelroll?

1130
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:36,878
EVELYN: Yeah.

1131
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,255
I won't.

1132
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,507
Aah!

1133
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:49,641
- Oh!
- Ha ha ha ha!

1134
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,435
- Oh, God.
- What do you think?

1135
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,145
I like that.

1136
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,323
MAN: Hey!

1137
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:07,659
That plane was supposed
to be back here an hour ago!

1138
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,744
Quick, hide
in the parachute hangar.

1139
01:03:49,284 --> 01:03:51,661
My heart is pounding.

1140
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,211
Danny, last night...

1141
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,254
No, that's terrible.

1142
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,926
Danny, we need
to talk about this.

1143
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,388
Sir. Evelyn!

1144
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,890
- Danny.
- Hey. Hi.

1145
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,434
Hi.

1146
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,355
I didn't sleep a wink
last night.

1147
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,899
I had to see you.

1148
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,485
Last night was crazy,
I know, but...

1149
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,779
I'm not sorry. Are you?

1150
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,408
I don't know.

1151
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:17,288
Danny, I had a wonderful
time last night. I--

1152
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,957
It's just all too fast.

1153
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,626
Listen, Evelyn, I was just down
at the beach this morning...

1154
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,503
and I watched the sun rise...

1155
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,547
and I knew that everything
was gonna be different.

1156
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,217
That this was the start
of something new.

1157
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,220
In this place, in this moment.

1158
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:35,557
And I don't care what
anybody else says, you know?

1159
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,601
How can I not feel this way?

1160
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:41,980
I kinda like you.

1161
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:46,442
Oh, you do?

1162
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,241
You have your tie on crooked.

1163
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:59,789
Everything's
gonna be all right, OK?

1164
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,251
Everything's
gonna be all right.

1165
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:16,431
Do you have any airtours going
through the valley of Oahu?

1166
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,017
You do?

1167
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:34,324
MALE RADIOHOST: Aloha.
This is KGMB in Honolulu...

1168
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:37,619
on another beautiful
fall day here in paradise.

1169
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,875
SPY:
We have enough information.

1170
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,046
We are returning home.

1171
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:17,992
EVELYN: Do you ever wonder...

1172
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:19,869
if this war's
gonna catch up with us?

1173
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:23,373
DANNY: Nota whole lot.

1174
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:27,544
Every moment we're not together,
you're upthere training for it.

1175
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:32,715
Yeah, well, I'm training
for moments like these...

1176
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,384
'cause I have no idea...

1177
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:37,011
how I'm gonna get this car
out of the sand.

1178
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,554
Evelyn, can you please
come out of the bathroom?

1179
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,640
You've been there for an hour.

1180
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,226
Evelyn! What are you
trying to do, look like me?

1181
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,477
[Women giggle]

1182
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:47,563
BARBARA: Are you OK?

1183
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:48,773
Yeah.

1184
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,358
What's the matter?
No, you--

1185
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,944
D'oy.

1186
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,904
They call it the vacant sea.

1187
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:56,948
None of the major sea lanes
go through it...

1188
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,909
and you can bury the entire
land mass of Asia there...

1189
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:01,828
and nobody would know.

1190
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:05,039
ADMIRAL: From there,
they could attack anywhere.

1191
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:06,582
VICEADMIRAL:
Our last signals intercept...

1192
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:09,335
indicate that the Japanese
taskforce is heading south...

1193
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,212
towards the Philippines
or southeast Asia.

1194
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:13,589
But Captain Thurman
of Naval intelligence here...

1195
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,425
has his own theory
about the missing ships.

1196
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:19,095
Sir, I believe
they'll try to hit us...

1197
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:21,139
where it'll hurt us the most--
Pearl Harbor.

1198
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:24,225
It's over 4,000 nautical miles
from Japan to Pearl.

1199
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:28,604
That's a long distance
to steam a navy, Captain.

1200
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,940
Your theory is based on what?

1201
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:33,609
Well, it's what I would do.

1202
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:36,612
ADMIRAL: That's not exactly
hard evidence, Captain Thurman.

1203
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:38,072
Well, Admiral,
if I had hard evidence...

1204
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:39,490
we'd already be at war.

1205
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:41,284
Sir, we can read
their diplomatic codes...

1206
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:42,618
faster than they can type them.

1207
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,287
But Captain Thurman's
cryptology team...

1208
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,122
is still trying
to crack the naval codes.

1209
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:49,083
The intercepts have missing
words and garbled lines...

1210
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:52,879
so to explain the decrypts,
we have to try to interpret...

1211
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:54,047
what we think
they're trying to do.

1212
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:57,300
Interpret?
You mean guess.

1213
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:59,844
They use
their informed intuition, sir.

1214
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:02,305
We guess.

1215
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:03,806
It's like playing chess
in the dark.

1216
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:06,476
Any rumor, troop movement,
ship movement...

1217
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,811
spine-tingle, goose bump,
we pay attention to it.

1218
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,813
When I was in
the Asiatic Fleet...

1219
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:13,024
the locals used to try
to get outside of a problem...

1220
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:14,484
to try to see the inside.

1221
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,110
Well, I see a strike on Pearl.

1222
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:17,779
It's the worst thing
that could happen.

1223
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:18,988
A blow to Pearl
would devastate...

1224
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,366
the Pacific Fleet's
ability to make war.

1225
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:24,702
So, sir, you would have us
mobilize the entire fleet...

1226
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,789
at the cost
of millions of dollars...

1227
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:30,249
based on this spine-tingling
feeling of yours?

1228
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:34,170
No, sir. My job is to gather
and interpret material.

1229
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:36,422
Making difficult decisions...

1230
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:37,965
based on
incomplete information...

1231
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:40,843
from my limited
decoding ability...

1232
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,346
is your job, sir.

1233
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:45,807
Then break the damn naval code,
Captain...

1234
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,642
so I can make a better decision.

1235
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:50,687
Aye, sir. We are trying.

1236
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,623
I wonder if we shouldn't put
the Pacific Fleet on full alert.

1237
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,131
ADMIRAL KIMMEL:
In case the optimism...

1238
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,092
of the "Honolulu Advertiser"
proves unfounded, gentlemen...

1239
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:23,428
what are General Short
and the Army...

1240
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,263
going to do
about protecting my ships?

1241
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:27,807
Within a ten-mile radius
of your harbor...

1242
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,767
we have fighterplanes
here at Wheeler...

1243
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:32,103
bombers at Hickam, and
a trainingstrip at Haleiwa.

1244
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,405
[Ding ding]

1245
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,948
We've recently established
a radar station here...

1246
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:47,076
that can detect planes
125 miles out.

1247
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,412
Which is a month old, Admiral,
and untested.

1248
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:52,248
I've seen
these new radar screens, Major.

1249
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,875
There's no way of telling
whether they're ours, theirs...

1250
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,626
or a flock of damn birds.

1251
01:10:57,879 --> 01:10:59,464
LISTENER: I'm intercepting
a call from Tokyo...

1252
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,591
to somewhere close by Pearl.

1253
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,092
DENTALASSISTANT:
There's a call from Tokyo.

1254
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,469
They say they don't know you.

1255
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,764
Hello? Hai.

LISTENER:
It's a local dentist.

1259
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:19,692
He can see Pearl Harbor
from his office.

1260
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,778
Are there many sailors around?

1261

[Speaking Japanese]

1262
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:29,285
LISTENER: Uh, the dentist
says that the flatships...

1263
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:31,078
are not in port.

1264
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,831
They're talking about
the weather.

1265
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:36,083
He doesn't seem to know
who he's talking to.

1266
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:37,835
- Hello?
- [Dial tone]

1267
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,087
Hello? Moshi moshi.

1268
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,881
Hello?

1269
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,300
That was a strange call.

1270
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:48,304
Admiral,
may I speak to you in private?

1271
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,349
ADMIRAL KIMMEL:
Why would a spy use a phone?

1272
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,059
They know we tap
all international lines.

1273
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,311
Our listeners feel
it's probably not code talk.

1274
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:57,063
It sounds like someone in Japan
is sneaking around...

1275
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,273
asking a local citizen
the location of our carriers.

1276
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,651
Well, that makes me feel
all warm inside.

1277
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:04,529
Get the FBI on it immediately.

1278
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:06,864
Have we found
the goddamn Japanese Fleet yet?

1279
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:09,450
No, Admiral. The bases are
looking all over the Pacific.

1280
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,494
So the entire fleet could be
rounding Diamond Head...

1281
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:13,538
and we wouldn't know
a thing about it.

1282
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:14,789
Get on it.

1283
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:51,284

1441
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:46,813
Hey...

1442
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:48,357
we got a large haze.

1443
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:53,237
That's too big
to be planes, right?

1444
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,993
Is that what you wanna do?
Knight to knight five?

1445
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:01,662
Boom! Wrong move.

1446
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,580
CLERK: Lieutenant,
radar's picking up...

1447
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:05,624
a large return
moving in from the northeast.

1448
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,543
Hang on.

1449
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,127
Relax.

1450
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:11,588
It's a flight of B-17s
coming in from the mainland.

1451
01:24:13,507 --> 01:24:15,259
Nothing to worry about.

1452
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:16,885
A heck of a lot of B-17s.

1453
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:20,889
Good shot, Hop.

1454
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:26,019
This better be good, Commander.

1455
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:29,690
One of our destroyers reports
having fired and sunk...

1456
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:33,819
enemy submarine attempting
to enter Pearl Harbor at 0653.

1457
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:34,987
It's 7:20!

1458
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,446
We had decoder delays, Admiral.

1459
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:38,198
Relay this to Washington.
Recall the staff.

Do you read that?
Acknowledge.

The Japanese
are expecting a war.

1475

Should we?

"Broken relationship.

But where?

1480
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:58,422
Did you ever lose a fight,
Miller?

1481
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,551
I been lucky so far, Captain.

1482
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,219
From what I hear, it ain't luck.
