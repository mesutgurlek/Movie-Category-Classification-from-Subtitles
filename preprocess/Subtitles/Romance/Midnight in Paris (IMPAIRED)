1
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,350
This is unbelievable!
Look at this!

2
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,410
There's no city like this in the world.
There never was!

3
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,740
You act like you've never been here before.

4
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,600
I don't get here often enough.
That's the problem.

5
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,890
Can you picture how drop-dead
gorgeous this city is in the rain?

6
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,220
Imagine this town in the '20s.
Paris in the '20s,

7
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,570
in the rain; the artists and writers.

8
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,730
Why does every city have to be in the rain?

9
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,150
What's wonderful about getting wet?

10
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,810
I mean, could you ever picture us
moving here after we're married?

11
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,470
Oh God, no.

12
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,710
I could never live out of the United States.

13
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,480
You know, if I'd stayed here and written novels,

14
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,970
and not gotten, you know, caught up in that,
just, grinding out movie scripts...

15
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,750
I'll tell you something:

16
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,120
I would drop the house in Beverly Hills,

17
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,100
the pool, everything,
in a second.

18
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,610
I mean, look:
This is where Monet lived and painted.

19
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,610
We're 30 minutes from town.

20
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,610
Imagine the two of us settling here.

21
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,140
We could do it, I mean,
if my book turns out.

22
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,730
You're in love with a fantasy.

23
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,420
I'm in love with you.

24
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,370
We should get back to town.
We're meeting Mom and Dad for dinner.

25
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,610
Let's meet 'em.

26
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,640
<i>There are our sightseers.</i>

27
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,240
If I never see another charming
boulevard or bistro again, I...

28
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,590
- What a town!
- Yes. To visit.

29
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,190
I could see myself living here!

30
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,210
I feel like the Parisians kind of "get me."

31
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,410
I can see myself just strolling
along the Left Bank with a,

32
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,350
you know, baguette under my arm,

33
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,020
headed to Café de Flore
to scribble away on my book.

34
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,830
What did Hemingway say?
He called it a "moveable feast."

35
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,610
In this traffic, nothing moves.

36
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
Well, a toast to John's new business venture here!

37
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,890
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

38
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,180
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

39
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,530
Well, I'll be perfectly frank.

40
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:42,320
I'm excited about this corporate merger between
our folks and the French company, but otherwise,

41
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,990
I'm not a big Francophile.

42
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,040
- John hates their politics.
- Certainly been no friend to the United States.

43
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,990
Well, I mean, you can't exactly blame them

44
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,880
for not following us down that rabbit's hole in Iraq.

45
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,040
- The whole Bush, you know,...
- Oh, please. Let's not get into this

46
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,080
- bad discussion again and again.
- Honey, honey. We're not getting into-- By the way, it's

47
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,150
fine for your father and I to disagree.

48
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,360
That's what a democracy is.

49
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,090
Your father defends the right-wing of the Republican party,

50
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,210
and I happen to think you almost got to be

51
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,530
- like, a demented lunatic, but it's like...
- Okay. Okay!

52
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,320
But it doesn't mean we don't
respect each other's views, am I right?

53
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,840
- Can we talk about the wedding plans?
- Yes! Please.

54
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,950
Let's do that.

55
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,520
- Your father is just...
- Inez?

56
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,270
- Huh? Carol?
- Hi.

57
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,670
Oh my G... What are you doing here?

58
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,730
- Nice to see you! Hi.
- Hey!

59
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,890
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.

60
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,100
Paul and Carol Bates, this is my mother

61
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,650
- and father, and, of course, you know Gail.
- Hi. Very nice to meet you.

62
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,340
Well, you... you didn't mention
you were going to be here.

63
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,540
No, it was sudden. Um...

64
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,600
Paul got invited to lecture at
the Sorbone.(sic.) <i>Sorbonne.</i>

65
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,270
Oh, how wonderful!

66
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,520
Well, uh, Dad's here on business,
and we just decided to

67
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,280
- freeload along. - Yes.
- Oh.

68
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,310
That's great. We can spend some time together.

69
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,990
Well, I think we have a
lot of commitments, but I'm sure it's...

70
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,000
- What?
- Well, what are doing tomorrow?

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,910
- We're driving to Verrsailles. (sic.)
- Versailles...

72
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,990
- Versailles.
- Oh,

73
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,990
- I'm dying to see Versailles.
- Yeah!

74
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,690
But it's too...uh...
We're late...I think what we're...

75
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,800
Tomorrow we're locked in
to a lunch at Brasserie Lipp.

76
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,700
- Oh no, that's just...
- Yeah. Yeah, we are. That's already...

77
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,460
You know I actually had
a professor that dined there,

78
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,440
and saw James Joyce!

79
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,540
Yeah, you know, like a
million years ago, and

80
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,240
apparently, Joyce was eating
sauerkraut and frankfurters.

81
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,580
Is that...
That's the end of the story?

82
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,540
Well, I mean it's not a story.
It's like a detailed...

83
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,630
- We would LOVE to go to Versailles. Yes.
- Oh, good.

84
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,450
I hope you're not going to be
as antisocial tomorrow at Versailles.

85
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,880
- How was I antisocial?
- Oh, please!

86
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,280
I mean, you could totally tell you didn't want to go.

87
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, I mean, they're your
friends, and I have to admit

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,920
I'm not quite as taken with them as you are.

89
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,340
He's brilliant.

90
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,900
You know, I had such a crush on him
in college, and Carol's very bright.

91
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,140
Well, he's a pseudo-intellectual.

92
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,930
- Just a little bit.
- Uh, Gil,

93
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:11,900
I hardly think he'd be lecturing at
the Sorbonne if he's a pseudo-intellectual.

94
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,510
You should give him your book to read.

95
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,090
Oh, come on. Why?

96
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,150
No, because he could critique your writing,

97
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,580
and maybe show you why you're
having so much trouble.

98
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,300
I'm having trouble because
I'm a Hollywood hack

99
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,460
who never gave actual
literature a real shot.

100
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,700
- Until now.
- Please...Gil...

101
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,160
Honey, just promise me something.

102
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,880
If this book...doesn't pan out,

103
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,150
that you'll stop
eating your brains out,

104
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,130
and just go back to doing
what you do best.

105
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,950
I mean, the studios adore you.
You're in demand...

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,480
Do you really want to give
it all up just to struggle?

107
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,570
- Well...
- Mmm?

108
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,420
Mmm?

109
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,130
Why would you...want to do that?

110
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,470
I believe Louis moved his court here,

111
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,810
uh, in 1682.

112
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,900
Originally, all this was swampland.

113
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,780
In fact, if I'm not mistaken,

114
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,110
uh... in Old French, the word "versailles"

115
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,400
means, uh, something like,

116
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,770
- "terrain were the weeds have been pulled."
- Is that right?

117
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,480
Uh... The... uh, middle section here

118
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,370
uh... is... uh, French classical style at its height.

119
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,500
Uh... The work, I believe, of...
uh, "Louis Vau" (Louis le Vau)

120
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,360
- Yes.
- Uh...Mansart...I think...

121
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,660
- Manzard. (sic.)
- ...and Charles le Brun, I believe.

122
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,670
Yes, that's right.

123
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,790
I could get used to a summer home like this.

124
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,710
- I know you could.
- Me, too,

125
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,880
except, remember: in those days,

126
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,970
they only had baths,
and I'm definitely a shower man.

127
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,760
Where are you two planning on
moving after you get married?

128
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,060
Uh...Malibu.

129
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,730
- Really?
- We're thinking about Malibu, yeah.

130
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm pushing for a little
attic in Paris with a skylight.

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,590
- La bowhem? (sic.)
- Yeah,

132
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,310
all that's missing is the tuberculosis.

133
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,890
Exactly. Thank you.

134
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,780
I mean, you know, the problem
is that he's not exactly sure

135
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,780
- he can write a novel.
- Really?

136
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,480
- Well...
- I mean, honey, so far your track record's-- you know, and...

137
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,870
well, everyone loves your movies.

138
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,440
- Yeah, well scripts are easier, so...
- Wow.

139
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,120
Why don't you tell them about the lead
character that you're working on right now?

140
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,990
- Yes!  - Oh, come on.
- I don't like to discuss my work.

141
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,690
Well, dear, you don't have to tell
them the whole plot, just the character.

142
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,680
- No, no, no.
- Okay.

143
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,420
He works in a nostalgia shop.

144
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,790
- What's a-- What's a nostalgia shop?
- Oh, not one of those stores where they sell

145
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,400
Shirley Temple dolls and old radios?

146
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,370
- And I never know who buys that stuff. Who'd want it?
- Exactly.

147
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,730
- I don't know.
- Well, people who live in the past,

148
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,590
people who think that
their lives would be happier

149
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,980
if they lived in an earlier time.

150
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,680
And just which era

151
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,990
would you have preferred
to live in, Miniver Cheevy?

152
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,090
Paris in the '20s, in the rain.

153
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,960
- Wouldn't have been bad.
- And the rain was an acid rain.

154
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,970
Oh, I see! And no global warming,

155
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,050
no TV and suicide bombing,

156
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,150
and nuclear weapons, drug cartels!

157
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,860
Usual menu of clichéd horror stories.

158
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,980
You know, nostalgia is denial.

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,370
- Denial of the painful present.
- Oh, whoa!

160
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,180
Gil is a complete romantic.
I mean, he would be

161
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,270
more than happy living in a
complete state of perpetual denial.

162
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,470
- Really?
- And the name for this fallacy

163
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,840
is called "golden-age thinking."

164
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,540
- Touché.
- Yeah, the erroneous notion that

165
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,990
a different time period is better
than the one one's living in.

166
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,820
It's a flaw in the Romantic
imagination of those people who...

167
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,030
who find it difficult to
cope with the depressive.

168
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,330
<i>- Yes.
- This is the nicest ring we saw.</i>

169
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,840
Diamonds for a wedding band.

170
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,430
That's the way you'd have to go.
And then, everyone will see

171
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,000
it in the back row when
he puts it on my finger.

172
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,050
Oh, Inez. It's gonna be such an event!

173
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,260
- I only wish that...
- I don't want to keep going over it.

174
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,380
It's your choice. What can I say?

175
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:53,030
Gil is-- he's smart,
and he's very successful.

176
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,890
- He talks about giving that all up and moving here!
- Oh, yeah, he TALKS about it.

177
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,400
Well, that frightens me.

178
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,050
This is, of course, Rodin's most famous statue.

179
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,480
A cast of this work was placed next to his tomb.

180
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,980
Rodin wished it to serve as his headstone and epitaph.

181
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,310
- Is that true?
- It would be in Moudon. He died of the flu,

182
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,660
if I'm not mistaken. In 1917, I believe.

183
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,420
- Very good, sir.
- He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?

184
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,700
Yeah. So much of Rodin's work was influenced by his wife, Camille.

185
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,710
Yes, she was an influence, though
Camille was not the wife, but his mistress.

186
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,950
- Camille? No.
- Yes.

187
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,970
- Yes. Rose was the wife.
- No, he was never married to Rose.

188
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,830
Yes, he did marry Rose,

189
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,390
- in the last year their lives.
- I think you're mistaken.

190
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,660
Are you arguing with the guide?

191
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,820
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. No, I'm certain, monsieur.

192
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,140
Yeah, actually, she's right.

193
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,770
I recently read a two-volume
biography on Rodin, and

194
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,620
Rose was definitely the wife.
Camille, the mistress.

195
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,320
- Yeah. You read that? Where did you...
- Yeah, I just read it.  I was surprised

196
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,270
because I mistakenly thought, like you, that it was, yeah,

197
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,850
the other way around.
It's an easy mistake.

198
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,030
So, Dad invited you guys for a wine-tasting.

199
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,030
- Oh, it'll be so French!
- Yeah, yeah.

200
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,650
Paul is an expert on French wine.

201
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:14,350
- You're joking. Really?
- Yes, of course.

202
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,810
When did you read the biography on Rodin?

203
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,070
Me? Why would I read
a biography on Rodin?

204
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,410
I will always take a California wine, but,

205
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,080
Napa Valley's 6,000 miles away.

206
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,210
John, old boy, how are you, buddy?

207
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,740
Oh, hey! What're you doing here?

208
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,310
Come on. I can't stand that guy.

209
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,670
Um...How 'bout

210
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,310
- we try some more wine?
- Yes! Let's start here.

211
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,910
Now, which would you prefer here?

212
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,720
Well, I think we need to be scientific and just

213
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,890
start drinking them all again. I don't know.

214
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,470
- Why are your cheeks so red?
- What do you mean?

215
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,130
- They're not red.
- They're bright red.

216
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,440
Oh, maybe it's because of the
pheromones that you're giving off.

217
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,400
These pheromones are driving me mad!

218
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,500
- Stop it! Stop!
- Ahh-- Sex and alcohol.

219
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,270
- Yeah.
- It fuels the desire

220
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,270
but kills the performance,
according to the Bard.

221
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,930
Have you tasted the '61?

222
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,480
It is divine!

223
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,290
- Though, Paul picked it out. I didn't...
- What?

224
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,890
- What's happening? What's happening?
- Slightly more tannic than the '59,

225
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,190
and I prefer a smoky feeling
to a fruity feeling.

226
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,040
So, Carol-- Carol and I
are gonna go dancing.

227
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,310
We heard of a great place. Interested?

228
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,850
- No... I don't want to be a killjoy,
- Come on!

229
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,980
but I need to get a little fresh air.

230
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,500
Oh, come on! Come on!

231
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,040
Although if you're just gonna sit there and obsess

232
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,010
over where the fire exits are, then...

233
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,010
Hey! If Gil doesn't want to go,
I'll share Paul with you.

234
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,230
I am very democratic,

235
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,270
and Paul is a marvelous dancer.

236
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,350
If it's OK with you,
I think I just want to take a little walk,

237
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,000
go to bed, and then we'll do it another night.

238
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,990
OK. Alright, well I can go, though, right?

239
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,320
- You want to go?
- Well, yeah,

240
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,110
Yeah, I mean, I'm not tired,
and I've been dying to go dancing,

241
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,150
and I'll just meet you back at the hotel.

242
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,520
- I'll take good care of her.
- OK.

243
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,240
I'll get a cab. Taxi!

244
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,330
- OK, but you should take a cab.
- No, I'm not taking a cab.  I'm walking.

245
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,400
- No, you'll get lost.
- OK, I'm gonna walk.

246
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,990
Is he a good writer?
I mean, have you read his prose?

247
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,970
- Well, he won't let anybody.
- He won't let?

248
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,690
Oh look, I mean, if he wants, I'd be glad to
look over his novel and critique it for him.

249
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,930
- That would be great!
- Would you?

250
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,280
- You know, I think that's what he needs!
- Yeah?

251
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,820
- Well, it helps.
- To have it read by someone. Yeah!

252
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,430
- And you wouldn't pull any punches?

253
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,290
- Well, I certainly won't be letting
you know I won't do that.
-No.

254
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,510
I do that about you.

255
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,340
See, but, the problem is,
when it comes to his writing,

256
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,980
he has absolutely no respect
for anybody else's opinion.

257
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,330
Really?

258
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,550
Oh, excuse me! <i>Parlez-vous...</i>
Do you speak English?

259
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,820
- Uh...Hôtel Bristol?
-  <i>Parle pas anglais. Désolé.</i>(We don't speak English. Sorry.)

260
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,230
<i>(Hey! Get in! Come on!)</i>

261
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,020
<i>Montez! On va vous laisser!</i>
(Get in! We're going to leave you!)

262
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,390
- What?
- Come on, guy.

263
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,690
- I didn't hear you.  What?
- Come on!

264
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,770
Come on, guy!
Get in the car!

265
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,610
Guys, I think you've got me mixed up.

266
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,610
<i>Vous allez me faire fatigué. Venir!</i>
(You're making me tired. Come on!)

267
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,660
I can't understand you.
I'm a little drunk! I can't...

268
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,500
What is this, an old Peugeot?
I have a friend who collects these in Beverly Hills.

269
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,900
Come on, have a drink. Come on!

270
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,820
- Come on, buddy! Come on!
- OK.

271
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,350
<i>Give me your hand. OK.
Sit down, here.</i>

272
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:08,760
- Let's go in. Paris, the city of lights.
- <i>Allez! On y va!</i>(Let's go! We're off!)

273
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,420
OK, now, where are
you guys taking me?

274
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,400
<i>On va faire la fête!</i>
(We're going to party!)

275
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,790
Yeah, this isn't quite fair,
'cause I've already had a lot of red wine tonight.

276
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,100
<i>Mais détendez-vous! Vous voulez du champagne.</i>
(Relax! Have some champagne.)

277
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
I do like champagne, yeah...

278
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,330
<i>Santé! Santé!(Cheers! Cheers!)</i>
- The night is young. Drink up!

279
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,850
- I'm drinking!
- Have a drink!

280
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,070
Yeah, drink up!

- Oh, yeah!

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,030
- You're an American?
- If you count Alabama as America, which I do.

296

- Me? I'm a writer.
- Who do you write?

298

- Oh, yes?

299

I'm Zelda, by the way.
Oh, Scott! Scott!

300
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,200
- Yes, what it is, sweetheart?
- Here's a writer, from, um... where?

301
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,340
- California.
- Scott Fitzgerald, and who are you, old sport?

302
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:38,610
Gil...the...
You have the same names as...

303
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,350
As what?

304
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,650
Scott Fitzgerald and...

305
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:47,050
Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. The Fitzgeralds.
Isn't she beautiful?

306
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:54,150
Yes. Yes! Yeah, that's...
that's a coincidence...like....uh...

307
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:01,460
You have a glazed look in your eye.
Stunned. Stupefied. Anesthetized. Lobotomized.

308
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,810
I...I...keep looking at the man playing piano, and I

309
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:11,240
believe it or not, recognize his
face from some old sheet music.

310
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,300
I know I can be one of the great writers
of musical lyrics - not that I can write melodies, and I try,

311
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,240
and then I hear the songs he writes,
and then I realize:  I'll never write a great lyric,

312
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,970
- and my talent really lies in drinking.
- Sure does.

313
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,700
Yeah, but, he didn't write the music, did he?

314
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,900
That's not possible...

315
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,760
So...um...

316
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,670
- What kind of books do you write?
- I...I...I'm working on a...um...

317
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,670
Where am I?

318
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,630
Oh, I'm sorry.  Don't you know the host?

319
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,780
Some friends have gotten together
a little party for Jean Cocteau.

320
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,880
Hey, lady. What...
Are you kiddding me?

321
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,740
I know what you're thinking.
This is boring. I agree!

322
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,770
I'm ready to move on. Let's do Bricktop's!

323
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,770
- Bricktop's?
- I'm bored! He's bored! We're all bored.

324
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,850
We. Are. All. Bored.

Liked? I loved!
All your work.

344
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,040
Yes, it was a good book,
because it was an honest book,

345

and that's what war does to men.

you think my friend is making a tragic mistake.

I don't like the thought
of her with that Spaniard.

375
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,450
May I?

376
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,890
Yeah, I'm actually a huge Mark Twain fan.

377
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:58,660
I think you can even make the case
that all modern American literature

378
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,230
comes from Huckleberry Finn.

379

- You box?
- No. Not really. No.

380
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,200
What're you writing?

381
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,560
- A novel.
- 'Bout what?

382
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,080
It's about a man who works
in a nostalgia shop.

383
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
What the hell is a nostalgia shop?

384
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,110
A place where they sell old things. Memorabilia.

385
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:24,320
and... Does that sound terrible?

386
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,120
No subject is terrible if the story is true.

387
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,640
If the prose is clean and honest,
and if it affirms grace and courage under pressure.

388
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,260
No good.

389
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,410
Can I ask you the biggest favor in the world?

390
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,540
- What is it?
- Would you read it?

391
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,630
- Your novel?
- Yeah, it's like

392
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:50,320
400 pages long, and I'm just
looking for, you know, an opinion.

393
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,520
My opinion is I hate it.

394
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,780
I mean, you haven't even read it.

395
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,080
If it's bad, I'll hate it
because I hate bad writing,

396
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,410
and if it's good, I'll be envious and hate it all the more.
You don't want the opinion of another writer.

397
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,760
Yeah. You know, it's just...
You know what it is?

398
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,920
I'm having a hard time,

399
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,870
you know, trusting somebody to evaluate it.

400
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,750
Writers are competitive.

401
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,300
I'm not gonna be competitive with you.

402
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,730
You're too self-effacing.
It's not manly.

403
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,460
If you're a writer,
declare yourself the best writer!

404
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,930
But you're not, as long as I'm around.
Unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it?

405
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,600
No, I don't.

406
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,890
Hey, I'm not gonna read your novel,
but I'll tell you what I'll do.

407
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,040
Yes?

408
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,210
I'll bring it to Gertrude Stein's.

409
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,740
She's the only one I trust with my writing.

410
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,930
You'll show my novel to Gertrude Stein?

411
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,800
- Give it to me.
- I'll bring it to you.

412
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,500
- And she gets back from Spain tomorrow.
- Great.

413
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,790
I'm gonna go get it.
I'm gonna...

414
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,010
I can't tell you how excited I am!
This is gonna be such a lift!

415
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,130
My heart is just racing right now!

416
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,110
I'm gonna get it, and I'll be back.

417
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,790
Whoa, whoa, Gil!
Take it easy!

418
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:12,270
You had a big night.
Fitzgerald. Hemingway!

419
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,700
Papa!
You gotta...

420
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,580
OK, we never said where
we were gonna meet.

421
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:01,520
Good thing you didn't go last night.
You would've hated the music, and the crowd,

422
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
but I had fun.

423
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,620
What're you thinking about?
You seem like you're in a daze.

424
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,150
If I was to tell you that I spent

425
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,790
last night with Ernest Hemingway
and Scott Fitzgerald,

426
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,270
- what would you say?
- Is that what you were dreaming about?

427
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,270
Your literary idols?

428
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,520
Yeah, but if I wasn't dreaming...

429
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,520
What does that mean?

430
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,810
If I was with Hemingway,
and Fitzgerald,

431
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,360
and Cole Porter.

432
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,360
I'd be thinking brain tumor.

433
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,660
And when I tell you,
Zelda Fitzgerald is exactly

434
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:40,390
as we've come to know her through
everything we've read in books and articles.

435
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,450
You know, charming, but all over the map.

436
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,320
You know, she does not like
Hemingway one bit.

437
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,700
and Scott knows Hemingway is right about her,
but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her!

438
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,910
Come on! Get up! We should

439
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,850
quit the idle chatter,
because we're gonna be late.

440
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,190
You know, I'm not gonna...

441
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,820
I think I'm gonna stay here
and do some work on my novel,

442
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,820
'cause there's a little polishing I wanna do.

443
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,400
No. You can do that later.
Mom said we can use her decorator's discount. Get up!

444
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,110
Come look at these, Inez.

445
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,570
Wouldn't these be charming in a Malibu beach house?

446
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,840
- <i>Combien, monsieur</i>? (How much, sir?)
- <i>Dix-huit mille</i>. (€18,000)

447
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,660
- <i>Merci</i>. (Thanks.)
- What is that?

448
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,120
There a steal at $18,000.

449
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,620
$18,000 for this?

450
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,620
Oh wait. It's Euros, so it's more.

451
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,580
- So that's like 20. $20,000.
- Even more, I think. Yeah.

452
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,960
I know, but it's very hard
to find anything like this at home.

453
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,030
- She's right, Gil.
- I know, but we haven't even found a house yet,

454
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:44,950
and we're trying to keep expenses down,
so I don't have to take any crummy rewrite jobs.

455
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,230
Well, you get what you pay for.

456
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,710
- Nice.
- Cheap is cheap.

457
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,410
OK, you guys want to walk back?

458
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,010
Walk? No, it's starting to rain.

459
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,030
Oh, it'll be nice walking in the rain!
It's beautiful!

460
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,390
No, there's nothing beautiful
about walking in the rain.

461
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,970
No, don't forget.
We're taking you to dinner tonight.

462
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,410
Oh, right. Yes. Great.

463
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:10,580
And then, also, I have a big
surprise for you after dinner.

464
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:15,120
- What? No. I don't like surprises.
- I have an incredible...Trust me, you're gonna love this.

465
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,990
- What is it?
- Are you sure you don't want to walk in the rain?

466
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,320
This is our last chance.
It's not that bad out.

467
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,320
Okay.

468
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,060
I don't understand.
Where are we going?

469
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,060
But, you made us rush through dinner,

470
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,540
and Dad wasn't finished with his profiteroles.

471
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:38,140
Profiteroles? You're going to have
the most amazing adventure of your life!

472
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,800
- Where?
- Just, Inez, please.

473
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,450
- Why are you carrying that manuscript around?
- You'll see, and when you do,

474
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,450
your jaw is gonna drop.

475
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,870
OK. You know I wouldn't hide anything,
so if I'm saying it's incredible,

476
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,630
- it's...
- OK.

477
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,790
- It's just, I don't understand!
- I know. You've been wondering why I've been acting strange all day?

478
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,060
- Yeah.
- Well, you're about to find out,

479
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:12,900
and you're gonna wonder why I wasn't
acting more strange, when you find out.

480
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,400
- This is very...
- I know. I know.

481
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,930
Well, I don't know what you're carrying on about,
but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure.

482
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,450
I am tired from the gym and a massage,
so I'm gonna get this cab.

483
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,930
- Taxi!
- Inez, wait!

484
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,060
- Let's just wait a little longer.
- Look,

485
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,550
you want to walk the streets of Paris,
and take it in by night,

486
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,370
that's fine. You go ahead.
But I'm in the middle of a great book that Carol lent me.

487
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,230
Come on, just 10 more minutes,
and then we can walk home.

488
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:50,550
If I'm asleep when you get in,
don't wake me up.

489
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,700
What am I doing wrong?

490
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,170
Unless she's right,
and I need to see a neurologist.

491
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,530
OK, you left the wine-tasting, a little drunk,
but not out of control.

492
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:11,330
Lost, you walk along...
this is the spot...

493
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,940
I mean, it's just like a one-shot deal.

494
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,670
The clock struck midnight...

495
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,040
Hello!

496
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,780
Oh, hi, Mr. Hemingway. Here.

497
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,780
Let me just jump in.

498
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:53,670
The assignment was to take the hill.
There were 4 of us.

499
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:57,130
5 if you counted Vicente, but he had
lost his hand when a grenade went off

500
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,610
and couldn't fight as he could when I first met him.

501
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,610
And he was young, and brave.

502
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,780
And the hill was soggy from days of rain,
and the hill sloped down toward a road,

503
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,260
and there were many German soldiers on the road.

504
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,370
And the idea was to aim for the first group,

505
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:13,530
and if our aim was true, we could delay them.

506
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,480
- Were you scared?
- Of what?

507
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,200
Getting killed?

508
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,750
You'll never write well
if you're afraid of dying.

509
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,460
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do. I'd say it's probably...

510
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,630
maybe my greatest fear, actually.

511
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:31,220
Well, that's something all men before
you have done. All men will do.

512
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,230
- I know. I know.
- Have you ever made love to a truly great woman?

513
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:38,680
Actually, my fiancée is pretty sexy.

514
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,650
And when you make love to her,
you feel true, and beautiful

515
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,820
passion, and you, for at least that moment,
lose your fear of death.

516
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,100
No. That doesn't happen.

517
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,100
I believe that love that is true and real
creates a respite from death.

518
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,670
All cowardice comes from not loving,
or not loving well, which is the same thing.

519
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:00,640
And when the man who is brave and true
looks Death squarely in the face

520
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,020
like some rhino-hunters I know,
or Belmonte, who's truly brave.

521
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:10,150
It is because they love with sufficient
passion, to push death out of their minds,

522
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,020
until it returns, as it does, to all men.

523
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,240
And then you must make really good love again.

524
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,580
Think about it.

525
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,850
- Alice. How the hell are you?
- Hi!

526
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,080
Good? Good. Ah, she's here. Follow me.

527
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,650
- <i>Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.</i>(No. I don't agree.)
- <i>Mais pourquoi</i>? (But why?)

528
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,980
<i>Parce-que</i>... (Because...)

529
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,470
This is Gil Pender, Miss Stein.

530
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,040
He's a young American writer.
I thought you two should know each other.

531
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,520
I'm glad you're here.

532
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,540
You can help decide which of us is right,
and which of us is wrong.

533
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,940
I was just telling Pablo that
this portrait doesn't capture Adriana.

534
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,220
It has a universality, but no objectivity.

535
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,480
<i>Non, non, non. Vous ne le comprenez pas correctement.</i>
(No, no ,no. You don't understand correctly.)

536
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,210
<i>Connaisez pas Adriana. Regardez...</i>
(You don't know Adriana. Look...)

537
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,730
<i>Regardez le mouvement, le tableau.</i>
(Look at the motion, the painting.)

538
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,490
<i>C'est exactement ce qu'elle représente!</i>
(It's exactly what she represents!)

539
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,530
<i>Non. Tu n'as pas raison.</i>(No. You're wrong.)
Look how he's done her:

540
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,920
dripping with sexual innuendo,

541
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,980
carnal to the point of smoldering,
and, yes, she's beautiful, but

542
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,940
it's a subtle beauty;
an implied sensuality.

543
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,650
I mean, what is your first
impression of Adriana?

544
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,220
Exceptionally lovely.

545
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,550
<i>Belle, mais trop subtile. Plus implicite</i>, Pablo!
(Beautiful, but too subtle. More defined, Pablo!)

546
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,930
Yes, you're right, Miss Stein.
'Course...uh...

547
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,220
you can see why he's lost all objectivity.

548
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,280
He's made a creature of Place Pigalle.

549
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,000
A whore with volcanic appetites.

550
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,570
<i>Non, non! C'est ce qu'elle vraiment si vous la connaissez!</i>
(No, no! It's true if you know her!)

551
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,720
Yes, <i>avec toi, au privé</i>,
(Yes, with you, in private,)

552
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,670
because she's your lover,
but we don't know her that way!

553
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:50,590
So you make a petit-bourgeois judgment
and turn her into an object of pleasure.

554
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:54,590
- It's more like a still-life than a portrait.
- <i>Non.</i>

555
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,290
<i>Non. Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.</i>
(No. No. I do not agree.)

556
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,430
And what's this book of
yours I've been hearing about?

557
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,490
Is this it?

558
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,370
- Yeah, this is...uh...
- I'll take a look.

559
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,190
Have you read it, Hemingway?

560
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,810
No, this I leave to you.
You've always been a fine judge of my work.

561
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,630
" "Out of the Past" was the name of the store,"

562
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,060
"and its products consisted of memories."

563
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,360
"What was prosaic and
even vulgar to one generation,"

564
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,450
"had been transmuted by
the mere passing of years"

565
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,700
"to a status at once magical and also camp."

566
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,880
I love it.

567
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,470
I'm already hooked.
Hooked!

568
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,940
I'll start it tonight,

569
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,860
but first, you and I
have something to talk about.

570
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,450
<i>I've been waiting for two months
for a reply from that editor.</i>

571
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,510
<i>I sent him the piece you and I
looked at, plus four others,</i>

572
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,280
<i>plus four shorter pieces.
And this guy, I gave him a copy of the...</i>

573
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:53,290
<i>- Nevertheless, two months: nary a word.
- Right.</i>

574
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,280
So were you really hooked
with those opening lines?

575
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:05,300
Oh, the past has always had a
great charisma for me.

576
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,690
Oh, me, too.
Great charisma for me.

577
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,510
I always say that I was born too late.

578
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,250
<i>Mmm. Moi aussi.</i>
(Mmm. Me, too.)

579
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,630
For me, <i>la Belle Époque Paris</i>
would have been perfect.

580
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,760
- Really? Better than now?
- Yes.

581
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:26,370
Another whole sensibility,
the street lamps, the kiosques,

582
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,690
the...horse and carriages,

583
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,480
and Maxim's then.

584
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,060
You speak very good English.

585
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,640
- No, not really.
- No, you do!

586
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,100
How long have you been dating Picasso?

587
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,120
My God, did I just say that?

588
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,640
Pardon?

589
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:52,790
I don't mean to...I didn't mean to pry....
Were you born in Paris?

590
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,210
I was born in Bordeaux.

591
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,340
I moved here to study fashion.

592
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,200
But you don't want to hear all this.

593
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Yes, I do.

594
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,800
Yes, continue.
You moved here to study fashion...

595
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,240
I...came here to study with Coco Chanel,

596
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,940
and I fell in love with <i>Paris</i>,

597
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,010
and also,

598
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:22,700
a very dark-eyed, haunted
Jewish-Italian painter.

599
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:31,390
And I knew Amedeo had another woman, but still,
I couldn't resist moving into his apartment when he asked,

600
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:34,180
and it was a beautiful six months.

601
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,310
M..M...Modigliani?

602
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:41,810
You lived with...
You lived with Modigliani?

603
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:46,850
You asked me,
so I'm telling you my sad story.

604
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,840
With Braque, though, there was another woman.

605
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,280
Many.

606
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:57,040
And now,

607
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,040
with Pablo.

608
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,800
I mean, he's married,
but...

609
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:06,440
every day, it's on-again, off-again.

610
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,690
I don't know how any woman
can stay with him. He's so difficult.

611
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:17,130
My God, you take "art groupie"
to a whole new level!

612
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,400
- Pardon?
- Nothing. I was just saying that...

613
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
But tell me about yourself.

614
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,460
- What? Well, what can I say...
- So, have you come to Paris to write?

615
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,940
Because, you know,

616
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:35,940
these days, so many Americans
feel the need to move here.

617
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,580
Isn't Hemingway attractive?

618
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,580
I love his writing.

619
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,280
I know. Actually, I'm just here visiting.

620
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
Oh, you must stay here.

621
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,580
- Really?
- Yeah. It's a wonderful city, for

622
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:59,080
- writers, artists.
- I know. I'd like to, but it's not that easy.

623
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,080
And,

624
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:06,060
I didn't fall in love madly with your book...

625
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,760
- Really?
- ...so I want to hear the rest of it.

626
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:13,490
- You really like? Because I'm still kind of tinkering...
- Pender?

627
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:17,870
- Yeah, let's go up to Montmartre. Let's get a drink, OK?
- Uh...yeah.

628
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:22,300
I'll discuss your book with you as soon as I've finished it.
Where can I reach you?

629
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,680
Why don't I drop back by, instead of you
trying to find me, if that's all right?

630
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,010
- We run an open house.
- Are you coming with us?

631
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,680
I wish that I could.
I cant, but

632
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,640
hopefully I'll see you again eventually.

633
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,850
That would be nice.

634
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,120
- Let's go!
- One of these days, I plan to steal you away from this genius

635
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,750
who's great, but he's no Miró.

636
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,850
I'm Gil Pender.

637
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:09,110
I was with Hemingway, and Picasso.

638
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:13,430
Pablo Picasso, and Ernest Hemingway.

639
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,820
I'm Gil Pender, from Pasadena!

640
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:22,410
Cub Scouts. I failed freshman English.

641
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:26,220
Little old Gil Pender has his novel

642
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,960
with Gertrude. Stein.

643
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,400
Boy, that girl was so...

644
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,100
lovely.

645
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,440
Well, it's a shame you two didn't
come to the movies with us last night,

646
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,370
We saw a wonderfully
funny American film.

647
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,060
Who was in it?

648
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,900
Oh, I don't know.
I forget the name.

649
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,600
Wonderful but forgettable.
That sounds like a picture I've seen.

650
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,290
I probably wrote it.

651
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:57,120
Well, I know it was moronic and infantile, and

652
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,950
utterly lacking in any wit or believability,

653
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:03,380
- but John and I laughed in spite of all that.
- Have we been down this way yet?

654
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,320
Was it?

655
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,310
What time did you get in last night?

656
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:11,130
Not that late...uh...
I was...uh...

657
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,620
I'm really finding these midnight strolls
great for me creatively,

658
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,840
without the distractions of the day.
I'll probably end up going on another little

659
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,040
- hike tonight.
- Well, we'll see.

660
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,580
Yeah. We'll see.

661
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:27,240
Oh, look at those wonderful glass figures.

662

00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,820
Yes. Very beautiful.

667
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,910
- Oh. You're American.
- Yeah.

668
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,060
You like Cole Porter?

669
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:56,160
I do. I'm a big fan.
I like to

670
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,280
kind of think I'm a member
of Linda and Cole's inner circle.

671
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,280
I'm kidding.

672
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,820
Very pretty lyrics.

673
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,840
- Very amusing.
- Charming.

674
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,550
Gil?

675
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:17,010
- Gil? Hi.
- Yeah? Yes.

676
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,470
- Yeah. We should go.
- We're going now?

677
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:22,910
Yeah. We're meeting Paul and Carol
at the museum for the private showing.

678
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,490
- OK. Yeah. Right.

679
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,000
You know, Paul happens to be an expert in Monet,

680
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
so you'll find it enlightening, I think.

681
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,290
Yeah. OK.

682
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,160
Let's get some culture.

683
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,860
The juxtaposition of color is amazing.

684
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,460
This man was the real father

685
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,410
of abstract expressionism.

686
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:43,670
I take that back.
Maybe Turner.

687
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,610
I mean, I love Turner,

688
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,610
but, I just find this...

689
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:49,860
overwhelming.

690
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:53,120
If I'm not mistaken,
it took him 2 years to complete this.

691
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,330
He worked out of Giverny,
where he was frequently...

692
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:59,580
I heard that Monet,
one of the things that he used to try to...

693
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,240
Shh! I'm trying to hear Paul say it.

694
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,540
Well, he was frequently
visited by Caillebotte,

695
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:07,690
an artist who I personally feel was underrated.

696
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,950
Ah. Now.

697
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,290
Here's a superb Picasso.

698
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:16,420
If I'm not mistaken, he painted
this marvelous portrait of his

699
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:20,130
French mistress
Madeleine Brissou in the '20s.

700
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:23,580
Paul, I'm gonna have to
differ with you on this one.

701
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,870
- Really.
- Gil, just pay attention.

702
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,470
You might learn something.

703
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:29,580
OK, well, if I'm not mistaken,

704
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,100
this was a failed attempt to capture

705
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,910
a young French girl named Adriana,

706
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:38,070
from Bordeaux, if my art history serves me,

707
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:42,160
who came to Paris to study
costume design for the theater.

708
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,090
I'm pretty sure she had an affair
with Modigliani, then Braque,

709
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:48,750
which is how Pablo met her.
Picasso.

710
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,830
Of course, what you don't get

711
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:53,600
from this portrait
is the subtlety,

712
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,120
and her beauty.
She was just a knock-out.

713
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,080
What have you been smoking?

714
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:02,990
I'd hardly call this picture marvelous,

715
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:05,200
it's more of a petit-bourgeois statement

716
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,210
on how Pablo sees her. Saw her.

717
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,860
He's distracted by the fact
that she was a

718
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,790
absolute volcano in the sack.

719
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,610
Too rich for me.

720
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,680
Where'd Gil run off to?

721
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,340
Work.

722
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,880
Been walking around Paris. You know,

723
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,990
the way the city's lit up at night
allegedly inspires him, so...

724
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:40,540
But that's OK,
because I'm going dancing with Paul.

725
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,350
Where's Carol?

726
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,470
uh...She's in bed with a bad oyster,

727
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:46,870
so I'll see you guys later.

728
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,870
Thanks for dinner, Daddy.

729
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:51,030
Bye, sweetie.

730
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,830
Where do you think
Gil goes every night?

731
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:58,800
You heard her.
He walks, and gets ideas.

732
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,930
- You sound skeptical.
- No.

733
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:04,610
I've seen what he earns,
but sometimes I think he's got a...

734
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:06,090
got a... part missing,

735
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,090
and I didn't like his remark about

736
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:10,310
Tea Party Republicans.
They are decent

737
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,230
people trying to take back the country.

738
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,230
They are not
crypto-fascist

739
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:16,230
airhead zombies.
You hear him say that?

740
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:18,890
Nevertheless, I don't think
your idea of having him followed

741
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:21,170
- is very practical.
- No?

742
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:23,030
I'd like to know where he goes every night.

743
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:24,790
Well, we know one thing:

744
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,550
he doesn't go dancing.

745
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,520
Oh! Excuse me!

746
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,510
- Is this gentleman bothering you?
- Hello, Gil!

747
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:48,160
Hey! How are you?
I was hoping we'd see you here.

748
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,780
- What a great party!
- Oh, good.

749
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,780
- It's nice to see you here.
- Thank you.

750
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,780
Oh, Delfine?

751
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,380
- Gil, we'll catch up with you later, OK?
- Sure, sure.

752
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,380
<i>Bon soir, Madame.</i>
(Good evening, Madame.)

753
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,960
- What a surprise!
- It was just a total fluke.

754
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,700
I was at Gertrude Stein's,

755
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,960
she's almost finished with my novel,
and I run into this guy.

756
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,300
Turns out he's Archibald MacLeish.
He says he's on his way over here,

757
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,100
come on over. Oh, I'm not
going to crash the Fitzgeralds,

758
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,930
but then he said you'd be here.
You and Pablo, and...

759
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,540
Oh, Pablo's home.

760
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:17,970
- We had a...bit of a quarrel.
- Oh no!

761
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,850
- You look like you were having fun with Djuna Barnes, dancing.
- Oh, yeah!

762
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:23,850
Wait. That was Djuna Barnes?

763
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,390
- Yeah.
- Wow. No wonder she wanted to lead.

764
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:30,200
Isn't this a wonderful
place to throw a party?

765
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,670
- It's so great!
- Only the Fitzgeralds can do that!

766
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,820
- I want to show you something. Come with me.
- OK.

767
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:42,130
- So, what about your book?
- It's coming along. Yeah!

768
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,080
Look at that!

769
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,640
- Wow!
- It's from the turn of the century.

770
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,910
Isn't it beautiful?
It's my favorite era.

771
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:55,000
I love it so much.
Everything was so perfect.

772
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,020
It's so nice to see you tonight.

773
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,830
- I was hoping to...
- It's so nice to see you!

774
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,180
<i>Voilà, ma petite Adriana!</i>
(There she is, my little Adriana!)

775
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,950
Isn't this little Parisian
dream a moveable feast?

776
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:08,260
Mark my words.
I'm going to steal you away

777
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:11,260
from that fugitive from
Málaga one way or another.

778
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,080
Between Belmonte and myself,
whom would you choose?

779
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,690
<i>Vous êtes tous deux parfaits.</i>
(You are both perfect.)

780
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,520
But he has more courage.
He faces death more often, and

781
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,700
more directly, and if you chose him,
I'd be disappointed, but I'd understand.

782
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,380
<i>Ella ha elegido Pablo.>
(She chose Pablo.)</i>

783
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:25,920
Yes, she's chosen Picasso,
but Pablo thinks

784
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,610
women are only to sleep
with or to paint.

785
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,180
What about you?

786
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,840
I think a woman is equal
to a man in courage.

787
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,410
Have you ever shot
a charging lion?

788
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,250
Never.

789
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,580
Would you like to know
how that feels?

790
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,590
- I don't think so.
- You ever hunted?

791
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:42,990
- No.
- You?

792
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:45,230
Only for bargains.

793
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:48,790
<i>Tomémonos otra copita.</i>
(Let's take another drink.)

794
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,860
You know, it's so loud,
I wonder if we can go some place

795
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:55,970
- where we can hear ourselves think a little bit?
- Sure! Bye.

796
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:58,100
Who wants a fight?

797
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:01,510
Well, I hope it was nothing
serious with you and Pablo.

798
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:04,180
He's moody and possessive.

799
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,010
Artists are like children.

800
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:09,250
Well, you certainly understand why
all these guys want to paint you,

801
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,390
'cause you have just about
one of the best faces ever.

802
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:15,460
- It's so interesting...
- Oh?

803
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,890
- You're interesting, too, in a lost way.
- Lost?

804
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,620
Well, I guess I am lost.

805
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,620
Tell me more about your book.

806
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:27,880
My book is kind of a...

807
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:32,420
You know what?
I couldn't care less about my book tonight.

808
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,650
I just want to walk around Paris with you.

809
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,690
I keep forgetting you're just a tourist.

810
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,750
That's putting it mildly.

811
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,980
I can never decide whether

812
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,600
Paris is more beautiful by day or by night.

813
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,780
No, you can't.
You couldn't pick one. I mean,

814
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,570
I can give you a checkmate
argument for each side.

815
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:54,770
You know, I sometimes think,
"How's anyone gonna come up with a

816
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,770
book, or a painting, or a

817
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,260
symphony or a sculpture that can
compete with a great city?"

818
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,760
You can't, 'cause, like,
you look around, every...

819
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,630
every street, every boulevard
is its own special art form.

820
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:09,990
And when you think that in the cold,

821
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:14,320
violent, meaningless universe,
that Paris exists, these lights...

822
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,390
I mean, come on, there's nothing
happening on Jupiter or Neptune,

823
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:21,420
but from way out in space
you can see these lights,

824
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,590
the cafés, people drinking, and singing...

825
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:30,120
I mean, for all we know,
Paris is the hottest spot in the universe.

826
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,340
- <i>Vous êtes un poète.</i>(You are a poet.)
- Aw, come on.

827
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:37,730
It's just... You're very kind,
but I wouldn't call my babbling poetic.

828
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,510
Although I was on a pretty good roll there.

829
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,610
See anything you like?

830
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:46,230
Yeah. I'm ashamed to admit
I'm attracted to all of them.

831
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:49,540
I like cheap sexy.
That makes me shallow.

832
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,470
When I was in Catholic school,
one weekend

833
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:56,960
my roommate and I,
we paid a girl from Pigalle

834
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,390
to come and teach us all her tricks.

835
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,510
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

836
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:04,530
Wow. That's...

837
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:10,990
That's...That's...
I'm going to be thinking about that one.

838
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:20,340
I love walking with you.

839
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:23,610
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

840
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,410
God, is that who I think it is?

841
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,140
What is she doing here,
staring into the water?

842
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,570
Oh my God!

843
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:36,930
Zelda, what are you doing?!

844
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:39,500
- Please? I don't want to live!
- Stop!

845
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,540
- What is it?
- Scott and that beautiful countess.

846
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,300
They were-- It was so obvious
they were whispering about me,

847
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:48,810
and the more they drank,
the more he fell in love with her!

848
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:50,640
He...Scott loves only you.

849
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,960
- I can tell you that with absolute certainty.
- No.

850
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,650
- He's tired of me!
- You're wrong. You're wrong. I know.

851
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,380
- How?
- Trust me. I know.

852
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,820
- Sometimes you get a feel for people, and I get...
- My skin hurts!

853
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,230
- What do you mean?
- I don't wanna...I hate the way I look!

854
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:08,230
Don't do that!

855
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,720
- Here. Take this.
- What is this?

856
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,720
It's a Valium.
It'll make you feel better.

857
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,150
- You carry medicine?
- No, not normally.

858
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,000
It's just since I've been engaged to Inez,

859
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,750
I've been having panic attacks,
but I'm sure they'll subside after the wedding.

860
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,210
I've never heard of Valium.
What is this?

861
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:28,730
It's the...pill of the future.

862
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,280
You never said you were getting married.

863
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,600
Yeah. You know,
it's still a....

864
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,320
ways in the future.

865
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:45,580
- Well, good luck with your book, and your wedding.
- Thank you.

866
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,090
I think you'd like Inez.
She has a...

867
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:50,630
has a very sharp sense of humor, and

868
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:54,960
she's attractive. She doesn't say
that we agree on everything, but...

869
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,210
But the important things.

870
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:59,340
Yeah, or...actually,

871
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,300
maybe the small things. The...

872
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,850
Sometimes there's a little bit
of a disconnect with the big things.

873
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:07,320
She wants to live in Malibu, and

874
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,210
wants me to work in Hollywood, and....

875
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,480
But I will say that we both like

876
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:17,040
Indian food.
Not all Indian food, but the...

877
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,190
you know...the pita bread.

878
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:22,460
We both like pita bread.
I guess it's called naan.

879
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:25,480
I should go.

880
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,480
Pablo will be missing me.

881
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,790
- Come on. I'll walk you home.
- No. No. No.

882
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:32,100
Just finish your drink.
I live just around the corner.

883
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:36,510
- No. Come on. I'm not gonna...
- Well, I...I...prefer to be by myself for a while,

884
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:40,520
but thank you for the evening.
Bye.

885
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:45,900
<i>Monsieur? C'est un dommage.</i>
(Sir? It's a shame.)

886
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,900
<i>C'est un dommage.</i>
(It's a shame.)

887
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:50,630
We met, earlier tonight...

888
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,970
At the party!

889
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:54,970
<i>Dalí, sí?</i>
(Dalí, yes?)

890
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,370
- Yes...
- Dalí!

891
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:00,450
- I remember!
- Dalí. Ya.

892
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,120
<i>Un bouteille de vin rouge!</i>
(A bottle of red wine!)

893
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:07,410
It can't be...
Yeah....

894
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,540
So?

895
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,930
<i>Un autre verre pour monsieur, s'il vous plaît.</i>
(Another glass for this man, please.)

896
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,750
I love the language!

897
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:20,080
The French!
The waiters? No.

898
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:24,500
You like the shape of the rhinoceros?

899
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,400
The rhinoceros? Uh...

900
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:30,360
Haven't really thought about it.

901
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,920
I paint the rhinoceros.
I paint you.

902
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,090
<i>Sí.</i> Your sad eyes.

903
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:42,670
Your big lips, melting over the hot sand,

904
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,000
with one tear.

905
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:49,630
Yes! And in your tear,
another face.

906
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,240
The Christ's face!

907
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,430
Yes, in the rhinoceros.

908
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:58,600
Yeah. I mean, I probably do look sad. I'm in...

909
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,930
a very perplexing situation.

910
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:07,030
<>Diablo...Luis! Oye, Luis!
(Damn. Luis! Hey, Luis!)

911
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,620
My friends.

912
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:12,590
This... Señor Buñuel.

913
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,600
- Buñuel?
- Sí. Buñuel...and...Mr. Man Ray.

914
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,590
- Man Ray? My Gosh!
- How 'bout that?

915
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:23,360
This is Pen-der. Pen-der.

916
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,560
Pender!

917
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,810
- Yes. And I am Dalí!
- Dalí. Yes.

918
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,810
You have to remember.

919
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,120
Pender is in a perplexing situation.

920
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,200
It sounds so crazy to say.

921
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,800
You guys are going to think I'm drunk, but

922
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,920
I have to tell someone. I'm...

923
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,930
from a...

924
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:46,310
a different time. Another era.

925
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:49,180
The future. OK? I come...

926
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,000
from the 2000th millenium to here.

927
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,990
I get in a car, and I slide through time.

928
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:57,800
Exactly correct.

929
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,910
You inhabit two worlds.

930
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:02,810
- So far, I see nothing strange.
- Why?

931
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,440
Yeah, you're surrealists!

932
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,040
But I'm a normal guy.
See, in one life,

933
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,540
I'm engaged to marry a woman I love.

934
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,800
At least, I think I love her.

935
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,520
Christ! I better love her!
I'm marrying her!

936
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,010
The rhinoceros makes love

937
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:19,770
by mounting the female.

938
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:21,710
But...

939
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,010
is there a difference

940
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:27,650
in the beauty between two

941
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:30,130
rhinoceroses?

942
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,360
There is another woman?

943
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,800
Adriana. Yes, and I'm...

944
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:38,110
very drawn to her.

945
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:41,430
I find her extremely alluring.

946
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:45,140
The problem is that other men,

947
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:49,140
great artists - geniuses -
also find her alluring,

948
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,630
and she finds them.
So, there's that...

949
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:56,610
A man in love with a woman
from a different era.

950
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,490
I see a photograph.

951
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,700
I see a film.

952
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,840
I see an insurmountable problem.

953
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,700
I see...

954
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,670
...a rhinoceros.

955
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:10,420
Did you get any work done last night?

956
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,350
Yeah...I just....
I'm starting to think that maybe my

957
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:14,900
book is too realistic.

958
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,270
That I'm missing some chances
to let my imagination kind of

959
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:22,550
go crazy, and not be so
damn logical.

960
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:26,160
- Why do you always look so good in the morning?
- No. No. No. No!

961
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,590
- We have to get dressed!
- Just for a second!

962
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:31,540
Come here! I've been working like a demon.
I gotta get this stuff done, but

963
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:36,050
I can't resist you any more.
You're so fetching in the morning.

964
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:38,220
Paul said we have to go to the countryside.

965
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,770
You know? He said he's taking us
to this beautiful little inn for lunch.

966
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:45,060
But, I mean, if you don't want to go,
don't go.

967
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:47,180
I'm not missing it because of you.

968
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:07,110
Hello! <i>Bonjour!</i>

969
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,840
- Hello! I have a quick question for you about Rodin.
- Hello.

970
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,850
OK, now, I understand
he loved his wife

971
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,070
and he also loved his mistress.

972
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:17,770
- Yes.
- But do you think that's possible,

973
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,770
to love two women at once?

974
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:23,270
Well, he loved them both,
but in a different way.

975
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:25,240
You know...

976
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,620
That's very...
That's very French.

977
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,440
You guys are way...
you know...much...

978
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:33,380
more evolved in that department
than we are.

979
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,640
Do you remember me?
I was in the...

980
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,910
- was in the group that...
- Yes!

981
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,360
The group with the pedantic gentleman.

982
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:44,450
Pedantic? Yes.
That's a perfect word.

983
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:56,150
Here is ... his photo.

984
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:58,240
I want to know where
he goes each night.

985
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,100
What is your suspicion? Hm?

986
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:02,650
He's engaged to my daughter.

987
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,690
To marry. I want to make sure
that she's making the right decision.

988
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:08,070
Naturally, discretion is paramount.

989
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:10,530
Well, you've come to the
right place, <i>Monsieur</i>.

990
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:14,640
Monsieur Tisserant will personally
keep track of the gentleman,

991
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,730
and report about his whereabouts at night.

992
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:39,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

993
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,770
Hey! Thank you for stopping.

994
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:45,890
- Gil Pender.
- Tom Eliot.

995
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:49,250
Tom Eliot?
Tom Stearns Eliot?

996
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:52,590
T.S Eliot? T.S. Eliot?

997
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:56,070
- Pender.
- <i>Prufrock</i>'s like my mantra!

998
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:58,070
OK. Sorry. Sorry.

999
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:06,690
Listen. Where I come from,

1000
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:11,380
people measure out their lives
with coke spoons.

1001
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:14,090
- Hello? Ms. Stein?
- Oh, Pender.

1002
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:16,170
I'll get to your book in a moment.
I finished it.

1003
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:18,490
We're just in the middle
of a little personal crisis.

1004
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:21,090
Oh, OK. Should I come back?
I don't want to interrupt.

1005
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,150
No, it's no secret.

1006
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:26,600
Adriana has left Pablo,
and has flown to Africa with Hemingway.

1007
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,370
<i>Sabía que tenía obsesión con este fanfarrón!</i>
(I knew that I had an obsession with that bully!)

1008
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:30,930
<i>Ya hemos hablado de todo esto!</i>
(We talked about all this!)

1009
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:34,550
<i>Estoy segura de que ella regresará muy devoto.</i>
(I'm sure that she'll come back very devoted.)

1010
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:38,010
<i>Muy devoto.</i> Oh, he took her hunting kudu,
but she'll be back to him.

1011
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:42,960
The sound of hyenas in your ears at night when
you're trying to sleep in a tent just drives you crazy.

1012
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,340
Mount Kilimanjaro is not Paris.

1013
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,770
- What are you saying, that he took her to Mount Kilimanjaro?
- Now, about your book,

1014
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,780
it's very unusual, indeed.

1015
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:54,430
I mean, in a way, it's almost like science fiction.

1016
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:58,170
We all fear death,
and question our place in the universe.

1017
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:01,510
The artist's job is not to succumb to despair,

1018
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:05,250
but to find an antidote for
the emptiness of existence.

1019
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,860
You have a clear and lively voice.
Don't be such a defeatist.

1020
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:16,830
Tell Gil to bring his suit, 'cause we're
going to be dining formal tomorrow night.

1021
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:20,710
I forgot to tell you, actually.
Gil isn't coming to Mont Saint-Michel.

1022
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:23,470
Why not?
I don't understand it!

1023
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:25,490
Because, he writes.
He rewrites.

1024
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,400
He rewrites the rewrites, you know?

1025
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,260
He says, "Picasso never left his studio."

1026
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:32,180
I said, "Gil, you have absolutely
nothing in common with Picasso."

1027
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,900
He just looks at me.

1028
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:37,140
Well, he's gonna miss a great weekend.

Can you translate this?

1053
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:18,460
Do you speak any English?

1054
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:21,560
OK. Alright, thank you.

Earrings....

Whoa! Oh my God!
What are you guys doing?

1078
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,140
Daddy had chest pains.

1079
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:55,340
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. I'm sure it's just indigestion.

1080
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,090
- We can't take that chance.
- You know he had an angioplasty 3 years ago.

1081
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:00,500
Yeah. Right.

1082
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,500
They put a balloon in me.
Big deal.

1083
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:06,370
- Balloon?
- I would like the hotel doctor, please, in room 728.

1084
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,520
Don't call the doctor!

1085
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:10,280
Gil, why are you so dressed up?

1086
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,190
Me? No, no, no, I'm not.
I've been writing.

1087
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:14,980
I was just doing a little writing.

1088
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:18,220
Wh...You dress up and
put on cologne to write?

1089
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,140
No, no. I jumped in the shower,

1090
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:23,070
just for a second. You know
how I think better in the shower,

1091
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:25,760
and I get the positive ions going in there?

1092
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,470
So, we were halfway to Mont Saint-Michel

1093
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:29,880
when Daddy just...
he went pale as a ghost.

1094
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,070
- That's terrible!
- I mean, it was so scary, so we just

1095
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:34,570
- turned right around and came back.
- Yeah. You had to.

1096
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:38,430
John, is there anything I can get,
for your color to me looks

1097
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,880
- like it's OK, but I'm not a doctor.
- Naw, I'm fine.

1098
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,440
I'm sure it's the
beef bourguignon she made me have.

1099
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,240
- What is that?
- Where?

1100
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,550
- That in your hand.
- Nothing.

1101
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:52,010
- That was a present!
- I know. I know.

1102
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:54,840
I mean, it's not...It...It is!

1103
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,050
- <i>Pour moi</i>? (For me?)
- Yes.

1104
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:59,060
It's not...incredible....
It's from the flea market.

1105
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:00,460
- Well, can I open it?
- No, no no,

1106
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:05,050
That's what I'm saying.
Honey, it's for a special dinner

1107
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:07,050
that we're gonna have,
then I'm going to give it to you.

1108
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,590
- Is it jewelry? I hope it's my taste, if it's jewelry, because...
- Well...

1109
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:15,120
- ...that moonstone necklace?
- But I thought you liked the moon?

1110
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,070
Because it's understated, but elegant.

1111
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:20,070
That's what you always say.

1112
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:22,310
Cheap is cheap,
is what I always say.

1113
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:23,900
Yeah. You didn't see this necklace.

1114
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:27,760
I've never actually even worn it.
I'll show you. You'll see why immediately.

1115
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:31,590
- Everybody's down on moonstone, all of a sudden.
- Well...

1116
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,130
- they are...
- A little simple.

1117
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:36,660
I think... I thought
you loved their simplicity.

1118
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:39,190
Yeah, that's the problem.
They're too simple.

1119
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:42,040
Well, what do I know?
Too simple.

1120
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,430
Where are my pearl earrings?

1121
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:49,250
Did...Did you bring them?

1122
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,740
I don't even remember you packing them.

1123
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:54,490
Yes, I did, because I've worn them here!

1124
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:56,990
No, you didn't.
Oh, they must've fallen out!

1125
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:59,580
Both of them?
Gil, my ears are pierced.

1126
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:02,760
Inez, I told you to keep
everything in the hotel safe!

1127
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:05,230
- Do you think it was the maid?
- It's always the maid.

1128
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:07,230
I...I know I saw them
here this morning.

1129
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:09,630
Well, I would report the theft right away.

1130
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:12,050
You know, she was so snotty
yesterday when I asked her...

1131
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:14,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's not
jump to any conclusions, OK?

1132
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,620
- You don't just level a charge of theft against somebody.
- Yes, I'd like to report a theft.

1133
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:20,980
- Shh, Inez, no!
- Could you call the house detective?

1134
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:23,380
- Send him up. Thank you.
- This is turning into a witch hunt!

1135
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:25,240
You don't do this to people!

1136
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,880
Yes, you do,
if they've stolen.

1137
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,540
I didn't like that maid.
I didn't like her from the beginning.

1138
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,110
She was sweet. She was pleasant.
She was upbeat!

1139
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,810
You always take the
side of the help, as usual!

1140
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:37,480
That's why Daddy says you're a communist.

1141
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:41,080
<i>Bon soir.</i> (Good evening.)
I'm Doctor Gérard.

1142
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,410
- Do you want some more water?
- I'm fine.

1143
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,930
- He's had angioplasty.
- I didn't need it.

1144
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:54,330
Look! Are these them?

1145
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:56,330
I don't know.

1146
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:59,760
- Where did you find them?
- They were just in the bathroom.

1147
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,760
- In the bathroom?
- Yeah. On the sink.

1148
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,090
What the hell were they
doing in the bathroom?

1149
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:07,150
I don't know.
They were just...

1150
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,560
But maybe you dropped them, and

1151
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:14,750
when you were putting them away,
and the housekeeper must've picked them up.

1152
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:17,510
and placed them there, out in
the open where we could see them easily.

1153
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:19,510
That was really thoughtful of her.

1154
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:21,420
I didn't drop them.
I wouldn't drop them.

1155
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,420
The important thing is
they're not stolen.

1156
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:53,320
<i>C'est l'un de vos meilleurs, jusqu'au présent.</i>
(It's one of your best, until now.)

1157
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:55,980
<i>J'ai parlé à Leo. Je pense qu'il va l'acheter</i>
(I talked to Leo. I think that he'll buy it.)

1158
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:58,260
Oh, Pender!
I was just telling Matisse

1159
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:01,620
we're going to buy one of his
paintings for our personal collection.

1160
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:04,020
I think 500 Francs is fair.

1161
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,460
500 Francs for a Matisse?

1162
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,250
Yeah, I think that sounds fair.

1163
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,890
You know, I was wondering if
maybe I could pick up 6 or 7.

1164
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:12,720
- What have we got here?
- Yeah. Oh.

1165
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,640
OK, now, I've brought a rewrite over
of the first few chapters of my book,

1166
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:20,040
and if you could just tell me if I'm
heading in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.

1167
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,900
- Leave it with me.
- OK. Great.

1168
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:23,860
and have you heard from Hemingway?

1169
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:26,260
Oh, they've been back for days, now.

1170
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:29,500
The trip didn't work out.
I knew they wouldn't hit it off.

1171
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,500
It's over. With Picasso, too.

1172
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,090
She's at Deyrolle, by herself.

1173
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:34,980
By herself?

1174
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:37,970
Oh, one of those crazy
Surrealist painters is getting married.

1175
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:39,810
They're doing it up there.

1176
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:42,160
She'll be glad to see you.

1177
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:47,180
<i>Eh bien, mes chers amies, je propose de porter un toast...</i>
(Well, my dear friends, I propose to raise a toast to...)

1178
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:19,060
Oh. What are you doing here?

1179
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:21,060
I came to find you.

1180
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:25,170
- You did?
- Yeah. Maybe this is coming out of left field, but

1181
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:28,990
let's just say, as a writer,
I'm pretty good at

1182
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:32,830
picking up on vibrations from people-
women in particular.

1183
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:37,490
I sense that there are
some complicated feelings, maybe,

1184
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:40,370
that you have for me.

1185
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:42,540
Aren't you gonna get married?

1186
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:45,420
Well, everything's a little
up in the air right now.

1187
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:48,250
I don't know what is gonna happen.

1188
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:51,710
Is there some place that we
can talk? Maybe more quiet?

1189
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:54,380
- Sure.
- Come on.

1190
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,790
Oh, Mr. Buñuel!

1191
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:59,280
I had a nice idea
for a movie for you.

1192
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,720
- Yes?
- A group of people attend a

1193
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:07,300
very formal dinner party. At the end of dinner,
when they try to leave the room, they can't.

1194
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,460
Why not?

1195
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:12,920
They just can't seem to exit the door.

1196
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:16,560
- B...But why?
- Well, <i>momento</i>,

1197
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,740
when they're forced to stay together,
the veneer of civilization

1198
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:23,480
quickly fades away,
and what you're left with is

1199
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,570
who they really are:  animals.

1200
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:28,360
But I don't get it.

1201
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,360
Why don't they just
walk out of the room?

1202
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,870
All I'm saying is just think about.
Who knows?

1203
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:35,540
Maybe when you're shaving one day,
it'll tickle your fancy.

1204
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:39,550
I don't understand.
What's holding them in the room?

1205
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:19,940
What are you doing?

1206
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,730
I don't know!

1207
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,500
I did feel,
for a minute there,

1208
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,630
while I was doing it, like I was immortal.

1209
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:40,190
But you look so sad.

1210
01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:43,540
Because life is too mysterious.

1211
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:46,060
This is the time we live in.

1212
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:49,020
Everything moves so fast.

1213
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,990
Life is noisy and complicated.

1214
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:56,690
I've always been a logical person.
I've never

1215
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:58,340
I never acted too crazy.

1216
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:01,840
I didn't stay here.
When I first came out here,

1217
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,900
I didn't take a real shot at being a writer.

1218
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:09,820
I'd just, kind of, be a hired Hollywood hand.

1219
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:13,000
Don't laugh. I just want to...

1220
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,120
I feel like I just want to let it go.

1221
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,570
- Here.
- Oh!

1222
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:27,790
Oh! This is...
This is remarkable!

1223
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:30,220
Go on. Here, put in on.

1224
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:32,220
They're so beautiful!

1225
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:40,840
Look!

1226
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:48,420
<i>Monsieur, Mademoiselle, on y va!</i>
(Sir, Miss, away we go!)

1227
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:52,530
- <i>Qui est vous?</i> (Who are you?)
- <i>Allez monter. Nous allons trop tard.</i> (Come up. We're too late)

1228
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:55,800
- <i>Allez!</i>
- Come on! Come on!

1229
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,040
Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>,
this is so beautiful!

1230
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:19,820
It's unbelievable!
All the pictures I've seen...

1231
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:21,820
Here it is: <i>La Belle Époque</i>!

1232
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:25,450
Wow! I don't know
what it is about this city!

1233
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:29,740
It's like, I've got to write a note
to the Chamber of Commerce.

1234
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:35,670
<i>Bon soir!</i>
(Good evening!)

1235
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,910
<i>Bon soir! Bienvenue.</i>
(Good evening! Welcome.)

1236
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:40,910
Thank you.

1237
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:43,940
<i>Oh, mon Dieu! Quelle robe magnifique!</i>
(Oh, my God! What a magnificent dress!)

1238
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,740
<i>Tellement avant-garde!</i>
(So ahead of the time!)

1239
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:51,890
<i>S'il vous plaît, prenez un boire du champagne. C'est la fête!</i>
(Please, have a drink of champagne. It's a party!)

1240
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:54,370
<i>Champagne.</i>

1241
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:27,020
Isn't it amazing? The first time we met,
I told you about this place,

1242
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:29,020
and the <i>Belle Époque,</i>

1243
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,020
and here we are!

1244
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:34,080
I don't know why,
but I have this feeling that...

1245
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,080
I don't know, like I can't...

1246
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:38,690
believe my luck.

1247
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:42,510
Well, I can. I know exactly where I want to go next.

1248
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:44,510
You lead the way.

1249
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,310
Look!

1250
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,060
Oh, my God!

1251
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:30,890
Pablo admires him so much!

1252
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:32,970
- I have to say hello.
- No, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

1253
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:34,770
- Come with me! I'm nervous.
- Really? OK.

1254
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:37,160
But, we know he's a lonely man.

1255
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:41,280
- I'm sure he would love some company.
- OK, let's go.

1256
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,000
Monsieur Lautrec?

1257
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,280
- <i>Oui?</i> (Yes?)
- <i>Bon soir. Nous sommes de grands amateurs.</i>(Good evening. We are great fans.)

1258
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,700
- <i>Merci, Madame.</i> (Thank you, Madame.)
- <i>Pouvons-nous vous offrir un verre?</i> (May we offer you a drink?)

1259
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:55,410
<i>Je serais enchantée. Prenez un siège.</i>
(I would be delighted. Have a seat.)

1260
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:57,410
He's asking us to sit down with him.

1261
01:18:57,410 --> 01:19:00,920
This much French I do
understand, and the gesture.

1262
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,120
<i>Vous êtes Americain?</i>
(You are American?)

1263
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,620
Yes, I'm an American.

1264
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:06,950
<i>Je vous devine à l'accent.</i>(I could tell from the accent.)
- Yeah. Oui. Oui.

1265
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:10,400
<i>Vos dessins! Votre attention! Nous admirons tout que vous faites.</i>
(Your drawings! Your attention! We admire everything that you do.)

1266
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,860
- I love your drawings, also.
- <i>Bon soir!</i>
- Merci.

1267
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:19,310
<i>Savez que moi je présenter Monsieur Gaugin</i>and <i>Monsieur Degas</i>.
(May I present Mr. Gaugin and Mr. Degas.)

1268
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:22,170
- Bon soir.
- Enchantée.
- Bon soir. Enchantée.

1269
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:26,890
- Paul Gaugin.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1270
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:29,910
See the sketch he's made?
Nobody can draw like this today.

1271
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:31,910
Not Picasso. Not Matisse.

1272
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:34,280
Unbelievable. <i>Parlez-vous anglais</i>?

1273
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,280
- <i>Non, monsieur.</i> (No, sir.)
- <i>Il parle un petit peu.</i>(He speaks a little.)

1274
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:40,420
<i>Non, non</i>. I speak well. <i>Parle très bien. Bien oui. Tu veut voir? </i>
(No, no. I speak very well. Absolutely. You want to see?)

1275
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:43,990
Degas and I were just
talking about how this...

1276
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:49,420
um...this...<i>cette...génération est plus vide, et il manque d'imagination.</i>
(...this generation is empty, and is missing imagination.)

1277
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,780
He said...He says that

1278
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:56,170
this generation is empty,
and has no imagination.

1279
01:19:56,430 --> 01:20:00,410
Better to have lived during the...
<i>la Renaissance</i>.

1280
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:03,540
No! This is the golden age.

1281
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,100
- Non.
- <i>C'est l'âge d'or!</i>(It's the golden age!)

1282
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:08,030
<i>Pas de tout. La Renaissance, c'est beaucoup mieux.</i>
(Not at all. The Renaissance is much better.)

1283
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,190
<i>Qu'est-ce que vous faites dans la vie?</i>
(What is it you do?)

1284
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:13,710
<i>J'étudie la haute-couture.</i>
(I study high fashion.)

1285
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:15,950
<i>C'est pour ça vous êtes ****</i>(That's why you're dressed like that.)

1286
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,460
<i>Je comprends maintenant!</i>
(I understand now!)

1287
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,460
<i>Les vêtements tres jeune.</i>
(The youthful clothes.)

1288
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,740
<i>Voulez vous de lui présenter à Richard?</i>
(Would you introduce her to Richard?)

1289
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:29,220
- <i>Ah, oui!</i> (Oh, yes!)
- <i>Ah, oui.</i> He wants to have you meet his friend Richard.

1290
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:32,720
He's looking for someone
to do costumes for the new ballet.

1291
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,270
So, <i>vous intéresse</i>?
(So, you're interested?)

1292
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:36,270
- Ballet costumes?
- Yes.

1293
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:38,080
Oh my God! I...

1294
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,180
I don't live here.

1295
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:41,990
I mean, I do, but I don't. I...

1296
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:44,130
It's best not to go
into too many details. We're...

1297
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:47,100
We're temporarily
passing through.

1298
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,870
Can I speak with you a minute?

1299
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:54,870
<i>Permitée</i>?
(May I?)

1300
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:57,710
<i>Enchanté.</i>.

1301
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:02,080
Wow, it didn't take
Gaugin long to start steaming in.

1302
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,240
Let's never go back to the '20s!

1303
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,240
- What are you talking about?
- We should stay here.

1304
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,810
It's the start of La Belle Époque!

1305
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:13,600
It's the greatest, most
beautiful era Paris has ever known.

1306
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,560
Yeah, but about the '20s,
and the Charleston,

1307
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:19,560
and the Fitzgeralds,
and the Hemingways?

1308
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,900
I mean, I love those guys.

1309
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:25,940
But it's the present.
It's dull.

1310
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,270
Dull?

1311
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:30,650
It's not my present.

1312
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:32,990
I'm from 2010.

1313
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:37,530
What do you mean?

1314
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:41,950
I dropped in on you the same way
we're dropping in on the 1890s.

1315
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:44,340
You did?

1316
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:47,800
I was trying to escape my present
the same way you're trying to escape yours,

1317
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,960
to a golden age.

1318
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:54,950
Surely you don't think
the '20s are a golden age!

1319
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:57,400
Well, yeah. To me they are.

1320
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:01,750
But I'm from the '20s, and I'm
telling you the golden age is La Belle Époque.

1321
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:07,170
And look at these guys. I mean, to them,
their golden age was the Renaissance.

1322
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:11,630
You know, they're trade <i>Belle Époque</i>
to be painting alongside

1323
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:13,410
Titian and Michelango.

1324
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:15,440
And those guys probably imagined

1325
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,480
life was a lot better
when Kublai Khan was around.

1326
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:22,310
You see, I'm having an insight right now.
It's a minor one, but

1327
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:25,650
it explains the anxiety in my dream that I had.

1328
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:28,260
- What dream?
- I had a dream the other night, where

1329
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,950
it was like a nightmare,
where I ran out of Zithromax.

1330
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:34,160
And then I went to the dentist,
and he didn't have any Novocaine.

1331
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:36,160
You see what I'm saying?

1332
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:39,730
These people don't have any antibiotics.

1333
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:41,990
What are you talking about?

1334
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:45,280
Adriana, if you stay here,
and this becomes your present,

1335
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:50,400
then, pretty soon, you'll start
imagining another time was really your,

1336
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,790
you know, was really the golden time.

1337
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:55,040
That's what the present is.

1338
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:59,760
That it's a little unsatisfying,
because life's a little unsatisfying.

1339
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,880
That's the problem with writers.

1340
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,450
You are so full of words.

1341
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:08,150
But I am more emotional,

1342
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,820
and I'm going stay,

1343
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:13,850
and live in Paris' most glorious time.

1344
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:17,900
You made a choice to leave
Paris once, and you regretted it.

1345
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:20,350
Yeah, I did regret it.
It was a bad decision,

1346
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:21,690
but at least it was a choice.

1347
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:25,330
I mean, it was a real choice.
This way, I think, is,

1348
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:27,950
I don't know, crazy.
It doesn't really work.

1349
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:31,920
If I ever want to write
something worthwhile, I have to,

1350
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,050
you know, get rid of my
illusions, and then I'd be

1351
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:38,570
happier in the past,
as where I want a home.

1352
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:41,510
So...

1353
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,480
Goodbye, Gil?

1354
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,400
Goodbye.

1355
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:03,490
Pender, I read your rewrite,
and you're nicely on the right track.

1356
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,210
You understood me clearly.

1357
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:07,300
If the rest of the book
reads as well when you're done,

1358
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:09,860
- you'll have something of value.
- That is the best news!

1359
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:12,250
I really did listen to you,
so I'm happy to hear that it

1360
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,840
You know, it seems like I'm
moving forward.

1361
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,620
I mean, it just means
the world to me that you

1362
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:18,740
- Hemingway read the chapters, too, and he thinks...
- He read it?

1363
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:20,740
...he thinks it's going to be a fine book.

1364
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:22,830
but he did have one plot suggestion.

1365
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:24,060
What's the suggestion?

1366
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,010
Well, he doesn't quite believe
that the protagonist

1367
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:30,500
doesn't see that his fiancée is
having an affair right before his eyes.

1368
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:34,030
- With?
- The other character. The pedantic one.

1369
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:42,380
That's called denial.

1370
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:44,380
Thank you.

1371
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:46,620
You're crazy!

1372
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:48,620
Paul and I?

1373
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:51,360
Where did you get such an insane notion?

1374
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,360
Where? From Ernest Hemingway.

1375
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,200
He figured it out, and, guess what,
it makes perfect sense.

1376
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,280
Gil, your brain tumor's acting up again.

1377
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:00,730
- No. No!
- There's nothing crazy about Hemingway,

1378
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:03,680
or Fitzgerald, or Gertrude Stein,
or Salvador Dalí!

1379
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:06,160
Yeah, except that they've been dead for years!

1380
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,090
No, no. The past is not dead.

1381
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:10,810
Actually, it's not even past.
You know who said that?

1382
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:12,960
Faulkner. And he was right.
And I met him, too.

1383
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,480
I ran into him at a dinner party.

1384
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,260
- You're a raving lunatic!
- No, I'm not.

1385
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,580
- Yes, you are.
- No. I'm too trusting.

1386
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:20,580
I'm jealous,
and I'm trusting.

1387
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:22,160
It's cognitive dissonance.

1388
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,400
- Scott Fitzgerald talked about it.
- Gil. Gil.

1389
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,260
Inez, you can fool me,
but you cannot fool Hemingway.

1390
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:29,110
- I know.
- Jesus Christ, I'm dealing with a madman here.

1391
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:31,600
OK. Yes! I did.

1392
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,190
I was with Paul for a few nights,

1393
01:25:34,190 --> 01:25:37,460
because he's romantic,
and he speaks French,

1394
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:42,010
and you were always working, and maybe it's
the mystique of this corny city, but...

1395
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:44,010
get over it, Gil.

1396
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:47,250
You just put this in perspective
when we get home.

1397
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,120
I'm not...I'm not going back.

1398
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:55,290
- I'm sorry. What?
- I'm staying here, and it has nothing to do with,

1399
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:57,900
you know, your romantic fling;
Paris is Paris.

1400
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:00,240
Inez, you and I, it's obvious we're not...

1401
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,730
I don't think we're right for each other.

1402
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,960
What?

1403
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:07,970
What are you saying?

1404
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:10,690
What are you even talking about?

1405
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,250
- You ready to go swimming?
- Hi!

1406
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,870
We're breaking up.

1407
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:19,080
- What?
- Yeah. Gil's moving to Paris.

1408
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,080
- I knew it. I told you.
- What's going on?

1409
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,800
No, no, I'm going to stay in Paris, but

1410
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,320
just because we're...

1411
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:28,110
If I'm unhappy, I'll move back.
But for the time being, yes.

1412
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:30,740
W...W...With who?...
With who, Gil?

1413
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:33,590
- No one, I...
- One of your crazy hallucinatory friends?

1414
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:35,590
I mean, Mom's right about you.

1415
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:37,480
You have this part missing.

1416
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,860
Yeah, I said that first.

1417
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,160
Anyone whose protagonist
makes a living

1418
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,520
selling old cap pistols
and Joan Crawford cutout books...

1419
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,200
- Honestly...
- Look, I'm not trying to be

1420
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,980
a martyr, but I think
you'll be better off without me.

1421
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:52,640
- I really do.
- But we would!

1422
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,770
- I can't believe you're moving.
- Go ahead. Go ahead!

1423
01:26:55,770 --> 01:27:01,090
Walk the streets. Gush over the
Parisian light and the rooftops.

1424
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:03,090
Goodbye, Inez.

1425
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:06,080
- Say hi to Trotsky.
- Yeah.

1426
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:10,920
- Unbelievable!
- You know, I had...

1427
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:14,850
a private detective follow him.
I knew he was up to no good.

1428
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:17,010
- You did?
- You bet I did.

1429
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:19,030
He saw him get into a car
at midnight every night,

1430
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:21,030
and he followed him very closely.

1431
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:24,340
- And what happened?
- I don't know.

1432
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:28,440
The detective agency says
the detective is missing.

1433
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:30,760
<i>À qui dois-je l'honneur?</i>
(To whom do I owe the honor?)

1434
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:33,230
<i>Je...Je suis perdu.</i>
(I...I'm lost.)

1435
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:35,230
<i>J'ai detournée la mauvaise endroit.</i>
(I made a wrong turn.)

1436
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:38,410
<i>Gardes! Gardes!</i>
(Guards! Guards!)

1437
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:40,410
<i>Lui coupe la tête!</i>
(Off with his head!)

1438
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:42,410
<i>Lui coupe la tête!</i>
(Off with his head!)

1439
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:52,350
- Hey! Hi!
- Hey!

1440
01:28:53,530 --> 01:28:55,970
Wow! What...

1441
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:59,100
Good to see you.

1442
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,180
What are you doing here?

1443
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:03,350
I'm returning from dinner with friends.

1444
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:05,350
- Oh. OK.
- I live here.

1445
01:29:05,350 --> 01:29:08,410
And you? What are you doing here?

1446
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:10,800
I was just out for a walk.

1447
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:14,080
Yeah, I'm actually...I decided.
I'm moving to Paris.

1448
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:17,690
- Really? Wow. I'm sure you will love it.
- Yeah.

1449
01:29:17,690 --> 01:29:20,590
- Yeah. You think so?
- Yeah.

1450
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,930
You know, I thought about
you the other day.

1451
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:24,720
- Really?
- Yeah, because

1452
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:28,470
my boss got a whole
new album of Cole Porter songs.

1453
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:30,770
That made you think about me?

1454
01:29:30,850 --> 01:29:33,740
I like to be thought of that way.

1455
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:37,980
You're on your way home right now?

1456
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,980
Yes.

1457
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:44,200
Can I walk with you,
or, I'll buy you a cup of coffee?

1458
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:47,210
Oh, OK, now it's starting to rain.

1459
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:52,110
No, but that's OK.
I don't mind getting wet.

1460
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:55,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

1461
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:59,810
Actually, Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.

1462
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,150
I feel that's what
I'm always saying.

1463
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:04,700
I couldn't agree more with you.

1464
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:08,010
Yes, it is more beautiful.

1465
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:10,810
By the way, my name is Gabrielle.

1466
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:13,160
- Gil.
- Nice to meet you.

1467
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:16,230
That's a pretty name.
