1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
-On September 3, 1973
at 6.28pm and 32 sec.

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
..a blue fly
of the Calliphorides species,..

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
..whose wings can flutter
14 670 times per minute..

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
..landed in Saint-Vincent Street,
Montmartre.

5
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,000
At the exact same second,
outside a restaurant,..

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
..the wind was sweeping in
under a tablecloth,..

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
..causing the glasses to dance
without anybody noticing it.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
At the same time, on the fifth floor
of 28, avenue Trudaine,..

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
..Eugène Koler, erased the name
of his best friend, Émile Maginot,..

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
..in his adress-book
after coming home from his funeral.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Still at the same second,
a spermatozoon..

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
..containing an X-chromosome
and belonging to M. Raphaël Poulain..

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
..was reaching the ovum
of Mrs Poulain,..

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
..born Amandine Fouet.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,800
9 months later a girl was born:..

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,000
..Amélie Poulain.

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
-Amélie's father was a former
army doctor,..

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
..and was working at the hydropathic
establishment of Enghien-les-Bains.

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Raphaël Poulain doesn't like..

20
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
..peeing next to somebody else.

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He doesn't like..

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
..noticing people laughing
at his sandals...

23
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
...coming out of the water with
his swimming suit sticking to his body

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Raphaël Poulain likes..

25
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
..to tear big pieces of wallpaper
off the walls..

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
..to line up his shoes
and polish them with great care..

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
..to empty his toolbox,..

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
..clean it thoroughly,..

29
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
..and, finally, put everything away carefully.

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Amélie's mother, Amandine Fouet,..

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
..was a Primary School teacher
from Gueugnon,..

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
..she had always been
unstable and nervy.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She doesn't like to have her fingers
all wrinkled by hot water.

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
She doesn't like it when
somebody she doesn't like..

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
..touches her,..

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
..to have the marks of the sheets
on her cheek in the morning.

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
She likes the outfits of
the ice-skaters on TV.

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
..to shine the flooring.

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
to empty her handbag..

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
..clean it thoroughly,..

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
..and, finally, putting everything away carefully.

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Amélie is 6 years old.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
She would like her father to hold her
in his arms from time to time.

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But the only contact they have
is during the monthly medical check-up.

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Moved by this intimacy,
the little girl..

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
..can't stop her heart
from beating wildly.

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
As a result,..

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
..her father believes she suffers
from a heart disease.

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Because of this fictitious illness,
she doesn't go to school.

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Her mother acts
as her private tutor.

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
-"The... chicken... often...

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
..hatch... in... the... convent."

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
-"The chicken..."

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
-Very good.

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
-hatch often.
-No !

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
-With no contact with
other children,..

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
..and mollycoddled by her parents,..

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
..Amélie's only refuge
is the world she makes up.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
In that world, vinyls are made
the same way as pancakes,..

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
..and the neighbour's wife, who has been
in a coma for months,..

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
..just decided to do all
her sleeping at once.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
-This way, I'll stay awake
night and day for the rest of my life.

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
-Amélie's only friend
is called "the Cachalot".

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But the atmosphere at home turned it
into a neurasthenic and suicidal fish.

65
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
-Since these suicide-attempts
only increased her mother's stress,..

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
..a decision is taken...

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
-ENOUGH !!!

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
-In order to comfort Amélie,..

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
..her mother gives her
a second-hand Kodak.

70
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
-What have you done?

71
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
-A neighbour makes her believe that
her camera causes accidents to happen.

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Since she's been taking pictures
all afternoon,..

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
..Amélie finds herself in deep worry
in the evening.

74
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
She collapses in front of the televison,
feeling guilty ..

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
..for a fire,..

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
..2 derailments
and the crash of a Boeing 747.

77
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Later on, Amélie realizes
that the neighbour had made fun of her,..

78
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
..and decides to take her revenge.

79
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
-But, what the...

80
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You be careful!

81
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
-and then, one day,
tragedy struck her.

82
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Like every year, her mother
had taken her to church to lit a candle..

83
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
..so that Heaven would
send her a little brother.

84
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The divine answer
came 3 minutes later

85
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Alas, it wasn't a newborn
that fell out of the sky..

86
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
..but a tourist from Quebec,
determined to end her life.

87
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Amandine Poulain, born Fouet,
is killed outright.

88
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
After her mother's death,..

89
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
..Amélie finds herself alone
with her father.

90
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The latter withdraws into himself
even more.

91
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He starts to build
a miniature mausoleum,..

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
..for the ashes of his beloved wife.

93
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Days, months,
then years go by...

94
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The outside world seems so dull..

95
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
..That Amélie prefers to dream her life
until she's old enough to leave.

96
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
5 years later, Amélie is a waitress
in a bar in Montmartre,..

97
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
.."les Deux Moulins".

98
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Today's 29 August,..

99
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
..in 48 hours, the destiny of
Amélie Poulain will take a different turn.

100
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
but right now, she has no idea
of what's going to happen.

101
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
For her, life goes on
with her collegues and the regulars.

102
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This is Suzanne, the landlady.

103
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
She limps a little, but has
never spilled the slightest drop.

104
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
When she was young, she used to be
a horse-dancer. She likes..

105
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
..sportsmen who cry
from disappointment.

106
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
She doesn't like it when a man
is humiliated in front of his kid.

107
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The tobacconist is Georgette,
the hypochondriac.

108
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
When it's not a migraine,
it's the sciatic nerve that's trapped.

109
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
She doesn't like to hear..

110
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,400
.."le fruit de vos entrailles
est béni."

111
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This is Gina, Amélie's colleague,
granddaughter of a healer.

112
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
She likes to crack her fingers.

113
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Here you can see her bringing a Kir
to Hipolito, the not-successful writer.

114
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What he likes
is to see a bullfighter getting gored.

115
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This is Joseph.
Gina's jealous ex-lover.

116
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He spies on her
to see if she's replaced him.

117
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The only thing he likes..

118
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
..is to pop the bubbles
of plastic wrappings.

119
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And finally, there's Philomène,
the air hostess.

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Amélie looks after her cat
when she's away. She likes..

121
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
..the sound of the bowl with water on the floor.
As for the cat,..

122
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
..he likes to listen to
children's stories.

123
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
-No thanks, ma'am, 
I never work on Sundays.

124
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
-Amélie often goes to see her father,
during the WE, by train.

125
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
-Why don't you enjoy your retirement, and...
-Do what?

126
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
-Travel,
you never left Enghien.

127
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
-When we were young,
your mother and me,..

128
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
..we'd have liked to travel,
but we never could.

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Because of your heart.
-Yes, I know.

130
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
-And now,...
Now...

131
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
-Sometimes, Amélie goes to the movies.

132
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
-I like to turn around in the dark
to see the faces of the people around.

133
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And I also like to spot the little
detail nobody will ever see.

134
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But I don't like it
when the driver doesn't watch the road.

135
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
-Amélie doesn't have a boyfriend.

136
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
She tried, but it didn't
live up to her expectations.

137
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
On the other hand, she enjoys
all sorts of little pleasures,..

138
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
..putting her hand
in a bag of seeds,..

139
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
..piercing the crust
of crème brûlée..

140
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
..with the tip of a spoon.

141
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And play at ducks and drakes
on the Saint-Martin-canal.

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
-This is the cristal-man.

143
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Because of an illness, his bones
break like cristal.

144
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
All his furniture is fleece-lined.

145
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,920
A hand shake is enough
to break his finger-bones,..

146
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,800
..so he never goes out.

147
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Time hasn't changed anything. Amélie still
shelters in solitude..

148
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
..and asks herself silly questions
about the world or about this town.

149
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
For example, how many couples are
having an orgasm right now?

150
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
-Fifteen...

151
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
-And finally, the night of
30 August 1997.

152
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
This is what will change
the life of Amélie Poulain totally.

153
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
*-Good evening.

154
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The Princess of Wales, Lady Di
died this afternoon in a car crash.

155
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
She was with her friend...

156
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Only the first man to enter
the grave of Toutankhamon..

157
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
..may understand how
Amélie felt..

158
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
..when she discovered the treasure
that had been hid by a little boy.

159
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
On the 31st of August,
at 4 in the morning..

160
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
..Amélie suddenly has
a luminous idea.

161
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
She is going to find the owner
of this box..

162
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
..and return his treasure to him.

163
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If he's moved, that's it, she'll
start to mingle with other people's lives.

164
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
If not, well, too bad.

165
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
-Oh, the young missie of the 5th floor.
We don't often see you.

166
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
-Excuse me. Did a little boy use to live
in my flat in the 50ies ?

167
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
-Come in
and have a drink.

168
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
-No, thanks.
-Yes, come in. Close the door.

169
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh, kids...
I've known so many!

170
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
At first, they're cute, and then
they start throwing snowballs..

171
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I know.
-How long have you been here?

172
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
-Since 64.

173
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,800
People must have told you.

174
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
-No.

175
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Sit down.

176
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
My husband used to work
at Coccinelle Insurance.

177
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
People liked to say
he slept with his secretary.

178
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
They certainly did stop at
all the hotels in Batignolles...

179
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And not the little ones.

180
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
'cause the bitch
would certainly spread her legs,..

181
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,600
..but only in satin cheets!

182
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
My husband started to steal
from his firm.

183
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,600
First only a little,
then 50 million at once.

184
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And there they went! Flew away, both of 'em.

185
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Drink !

186
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So, on January 20 1970,..

187
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
..the doorbell rings. Well...

188
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
"Ma'am, your husband died
in a car crash in South America."

189
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
My life just stopped.

190
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Black Lion died of sorrow.

191
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Poor thing!

192
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
See how he still looks at his master..

193
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
..with love in his eyes.

194
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll read his letters to you.

195
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,800
Don't move.

196
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You can spare me 5 min, can't you?
There, he was in the army.

197
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
"Mado my love..."
My name is Madeleine.

198
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
"I can't sleep. I can't eat.

199
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
"I left my only reason
to live in Paris.

200
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
"I will see her again on friday 15,..

201
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
"..when I'll see my beloved weasel
at the station,..

202
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
"..in her blue dress with straps.

203
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
"(the one you find
too transparent.)

204
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
"Love."
There you are.

205
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Have you ever received
letters like these?

206
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,590
-No. I'm nobody's
little weasel.

207
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
-My name is Madeleine Walace.

208
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
There's this saying: "Pleurer comme
une madeleine", isn't it?

209
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,590
-Yes.
-And Walace...

210
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The Walace Fountains...

211
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You see, tears
were my destiny!

212
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
For that business of yours...

213
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Go and ask the grocer.

214
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Collignon has always lived
in this building.

215
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
-Ah, good morning, Amélie-mélo !

216
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
A fig and 3 nuts,
as usual?

217
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
-The people who lived
in my flat, in the 50ies...

218
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Do you remember them?
-Tough question!

219
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I was 2 in the 50ies.
Just like this moron today.

220
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
-The moron is Lucien.
He's not a genius,..

221
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
..but Amélie likes him.

222
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He holds the endives
as if they were precious,..

223
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
..'cause he likes a job well done.

224
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
-Come on, look at him!

225
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's as if he's picking up
a bird that's fallen from the nest!

226
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You're lucky you
don't want grapes,..

227
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
..you'd have gotten it on Monday!

228
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Come on, move, you retard!

229
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,800
The lady has other things to do!

230
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,000
Right.

231
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Go and see my mother.

232
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
She's got
a memory like an elephant.

233
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Mum-ephant!

234
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
-Thanks.

235
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
-Bredoteau.

236
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
-Excuse me ?

237
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
-That's the name you're looking for.
But it doesn't count if I say it,..

238
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
..I am senile.

239
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
-Don't listen to him,
he's senile.

240
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,800
Look at my oleanders!
-Why, what?

241
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
-Before the grocery,
he used to be a ticket puncher.

242
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
-What's wrong with that?!

243
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
-At night, he gets up..

244
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
..and punches my oleanders!

245
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
-I'd have preferred lilacs.
But that's life!

246
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Everyone his way to calm down!

247
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
-With me, it's ducks and drakes!

248
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
- Ducks and drakes!
- There you are !

249
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I write down everything.

250
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
-You write down what?

251
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
-Your son's almost 50.

252
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And I still do his accounting!

253
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
-When he was 15, you still got his
toothbrush ready! That's the result!

254
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
-So, Camus, 2nd on the right...

255
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
-No, that's not it!

256
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
-No, staircase B,
that was Brossard...

257
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That's it, I've got it!

258
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Bredoteau, 5th on the right.

259
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,200
They were from the Pas-de-Calais.
-Bredoteau...

260
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's all I have to say!

261
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
-This young man who rummages
about under the photo machine..

262
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,400
..is called Nino Quincampoix.

263
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,400
Amélie was denied the company
of other children,..

264
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,800
..but little Nino,
would rather have done without.

265
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Often, at the same moment,
9 km away from each other,..

266
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,800
..one was dreaming about a sister
and the other about a brother,..

267
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,800
..with whom they'd play
all the time.

268
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
-Hello, dad.

269
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,400
Made yourself a new friend?

270
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,000
-No, I've had it for ages.

271
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But since your mother
hated it,..

272
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
..I had put it away in the shed.
Let's reconcile them with each other.

273
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
There! Not bad, eh?

274
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
-Say, dad.

275
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
If you found something from
your childhood, a treasure for you,..

276
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
..would it make you happy, sad,
nostalgic? How would you feel?

277
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
-I didn't have the dwarf
when I was a kid.

278
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It was a present
when I retired.

279
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
-No, the things you keep a secret
as if it was of great value.

280
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
-I should varnish it
before the fall.

281
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
-I'm gonna make tea.
Do you want some?

282
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
-Don't move.

283
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
-You're OK? Better?

284
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,400
-Hey, close the door !

285
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,000
-It's not like Siberia.

286
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
-You're not allergic
to carbon monoxyde!

287
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I coughed so much last night
that my pleural membrane almost broke!

288
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
-Yes, of course!
-What's the menu today?

289
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
-Endive "au gratin"

290
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
-They'll bring you to your knees.

291
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
-So they're good?
-Depends on where you fall...

292
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
True, if it's in the toilet..
-They're no good!

293
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
-12.15am, burst of laughter
reminiscent of an orgasm..

294
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,800
..to please the dominating male.

295
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
-I can't take it anymore.
-Yes, true.

296
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Why does he insists?

297
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
There's other bars!

298
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
-Goodbye.
Mrs Suzanne !

299
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
-Yes ?

300
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,560
-Is there béchamel sauce,
in your endives?

301
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,000
-Of course, why?

302
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
-Béchamel sauce
doesn't agree with me.

303
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Just like horse-meat for you.

304
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
-That's got nothing to do
with digestion, but with memories.

305
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'd rather eat
human flesh.

306
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
-Come on!

307
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
-Mrs Suzanne ?

308
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Can I leave earlier today?

309
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,600
-What's his name?

310
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
-Dominique Bredoteau.

311
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
-Hello !

312
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
-Dominique Bredoteau ?

313
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
-Yes...

314
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Can I help you?
-Well... It's for the petition.

315
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,800
-The petition ?

316
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
-Yes... The pétition... for...

317
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,000
For the canonization of Lady Di.

318
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
-O, yes. Er, no, thanks!

319
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
-Hello!
*-Yes?

320
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Dominique Bredoteau ? It's for the census
of the European Union.

321
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
*-Come up. 3rd floor.

322
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Hello, kitten.

323
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Earl Grey ? Bergamot ? Jasmine ?

324
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Can I offer you
something to drink?

325
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
-No. I have work to do.

326
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
-Yes, yes! Coming!

327
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
-Good afternoon, madam.
I'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau.

328
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
-Oh, my poor girl!
You've just missed him.

329
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
See, he's coming down.

330
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
-Bretodeau.

331
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Not Bredoteau.

332
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You look like you can use
some hot wine with cinnamon. Come in!

333
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
-I've lived here for five years now,
it's the 1st time bump into you.

334
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
-I never come out.

335
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I don't want to meet
just anybody.

336
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,600
And there's only rascals out there!

337
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But come in. There. Come in...

338
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You know,
They call me the cristal man.

339
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But my name
is Raymond Dufayel.

340
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,000
Amélie Poulain..
I'm a waitress...

341
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
-At the "Deux Moulins", I know.
And you're coming back empty-handed..

342
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
..from your hunt for Bretodeau.

343
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Because it's not "do",
it's "to".

344
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Like "toto".
-Thanks.

345
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I really like this painting.

346
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
-It's "The rower's lunch".

347
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,800
By Renoir.

348
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I paint one every year,
for 20 years now.

349
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
The hardest is the eyes.

350
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Sometimes, they change
their moods on purpose,..

351
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
..when I'm not looking.

352
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
-They look happy here.
-They better be!

353
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
This year, they had
hare with morel..

354
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
..and waffles with jam
for the children.

355
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Let's see, where did I put..

356
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,800
..that little note?

357
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I see you're looking at
my camera at the window.

358
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's a gift from my sister-in-law.

359
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh, I just put it there, this way..

360
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
..no need to wind up
my clock anymore.

361
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
After all these years,..

362
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
..the only character I
can't quite figure out,..

363
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
..is the girl with the glass of water.
She's in the middle..

364
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
..and yet, outside.

365
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
-Maybe she's just
different from the others.

366
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
-How different?

367
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,600
-I don't know.

368
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
-As a kid, maybe she didn't often
play with other children.

369
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Maybe even never...

370
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Here you are.

371
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Dominique Bretodeau.
27, rue Mouffetard.

372
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It's for you.

373
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
-This morning,
like every Tuesday,..

374
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
..Dominique Bretodeau goes out
to buy a chicken.

375
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Usually, he cooks it in the oven
with baked potatoes.

376
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
After cutting off the legs,
the breast and the wings,..

377
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
..he'll clean up the bones
with his fingers,..

378
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
..starting with the oyster.

379
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
No, Bretodeau won't buy..

380
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
..a chicken today.

381
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
He won't go any further..

382
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,600
than that telephone booth.
There...

383
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
-In one second, Bretodeau
remembers everything.

384
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Bahamontes' victory
in the Tour de France 1959...

385
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Aunt Josette's corselets...

386
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And, especially,
that tragic day..

387
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
..when he won all the marbles
of his classmates during playtime.

388
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
-Bretodeau !

389
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
-Bretodeau !!

390
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
The Claw, Bretodeau !
Does he know it, the claw?

391
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
-One cognac, please.

392
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I can't believe,
what just happened to me.

393
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It must've been my guardian angel.
Can't be anything else.

394
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's as if
the telephone booth was calling me..

395
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
..it rang, and rang...

396
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
-Well my,
there's the microwave calling!

397
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
-Can I have another cognac?

398
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It's weird, life.

399
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
When you're a kid,
time creeps slowly and then one day,..

400
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
..you're 50.

401
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And childhood,
whatever's left of it,..

402
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,800
..fits into
a little rusty box.

403
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You don't have children
yet, do you,..

404
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,600
..miss?

405
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I have a daughter.
She must be about your age.

406
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
We haven't spoken to each
other for years now.

407
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I heard she has a child,
a little boy.

408
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
His name is Lucas.

409
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's about time
I went to pay them a visit..

410
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
..before I end up in a box myself.

411
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Don't you think?

412
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
-Amélie suddenly feels
in perfect harmony with herself.

413
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
everything's perfect:
the softness of the light,..

414
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
..that little scent in the air,
the peaceful sounds of the city...

415
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Life seems so simple
and cristal-clear that she's swept..

416
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
..by this desire to help
the all mankind.

417
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
-I'll help you.
We go down and there we go!

418
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
There's the widow
of the drummer of the brass band.

419
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Hey, the horse's lost one ear!

420
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The husband of florist is laughing.

421
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
There's lollipops
in the shop window!

422
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Can you smell his scent?

423
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
This man is offering melon
to his clients to taste.

424
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
There, they make
wonderful ice-cream!

425
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We're passing
in front of the butcher's.

426
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Ham on the bone costs 79 !

427
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Here we're at the cheese merchant's...

428
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
12,90 for a Picodon d'Ardèche !
At the butcher's,..

429
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
..a baby's looking at a dog,
that's looking at the chicken.

430
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Here you are, now
we're at the metro station.

431
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'll leave you here, goodbye.

432
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
"She was never able to enter
into relationships with others..."

433
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
"As a kid, she was
always on her own."

434
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
*-On the evening of a bright
day in July,..

435
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
..while holiday-makers
enjoy themselves on the beach..

436
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
..in the carefreeness of the
sunny days and while in Paris,..

437
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
..the strollers, overcome by the heat
gaze at the trails of smoke..

438
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
..of the fireworks,..

439
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
..Amélie Poulain, also known
as "the godmother of the rejected",..

440
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
..or "the madonna of the cast-offs"
succumbs to exhaustion.

441
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
In the streets of Paris,
struck with grief,..

442
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
..millions of mourning anonyms
gather for the funeral cortège..

443
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
..to show in silence..

444
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
..their great sorrow
of being forever orphans.

445
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
What a strange fate,
that of this young woman..

446
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
..deprived of herself,..

447
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
..yet so sensitive to the charm
of the little things in life.

448
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Like Don Quichotte,
she was determined to grapple..

449
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
..the unforgiving grinder
of all the human sorrows.

450
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,600
An impossible fight
that consumed..

451
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
..her life prematurely.
At 23, Amélie Poulain..

452
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
..let her life deteriorate
in the swirls of universal pain.

453
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And there she was struck by the regret
of having let her father die,..

454
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
..without ever being able to give
back to this suffocated man..

455
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
..the breath of air
she'd been able to give..

456
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
..to so many others.

457
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
-Hey, Mister !

458
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Hey, Mister !

459
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Sir !!

460
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Wait!

461
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Wait!!

462
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
-Pages
full of failed identity photos..

463
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
..that their owners had
thrown away..

464
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
..and that had been re-assembled
and classified by some eccentric.

465
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Some family-album!

466
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
-One Gauloises blondes.

467
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
-There's so much smoke.
Where are they?

468
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I can't see anything.
-More to the left.

469
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
A bit further. There you are.
-There? Thanks.

470
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Where are my 1F coins?

471
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Never mind.

472
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
-Yes?
-One Moresque.

473
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
On Kir, one Moresque
and two and 2 peppermint cordials.

474
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
-That cooing, is it pre-nuptial
or post-coital ?

475
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
-And your bloody stupidity,
is it congenital?

476
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
-Pre-nuptial.
-Don't worry.

477
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You'll find the right one in the end.

478
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
They all dream about sleeping
on a man's shoulder.

479
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
-I wouldn't mind,
but men snore.

480
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I have a sensitive ear!

481
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
-I was operated, I got rid of it.

482
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
-How romantic !

483
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
-It's clear you've never known
true love.

484
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
-If I hadn't known it, they wouldn't
have shortened my right leg.

485
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
-Wasn't it a horse?

486
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
-Yes, precisely.

487
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I was in love
with a trapeze artist.

488
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I should've known, they dump you
at the last moment!

489
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
He dumped me
as I was going into the circus ring.

490
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I was so upset,
and as a result, so was the horse.

491
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Unfortunately, I was under it!

492
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,710
Right ! The Moresque.

493
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
-Love at first sight, it does exists.

494
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
-I'm not sayin' it doesn't.
But after 30 years behind the bar,..

495
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
..I can even give you the recipe!

496
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Take two regulars, make them
believe they like each other,..

497
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
..let it simmer..

498
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,600
..works every time.

499
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
-Excuse me!

500
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Excuse me!

501
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
-No !
-I'll go.

502
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Don't you think you've done
enough harm already?

503
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
-Gina's old enough to
defend herself.

504
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
-I'm not thinking about Gina,
but about Georgette.

505
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
-Georgette ?

506
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
-Open your eyes !
She's hoping for you..

507
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
..and you're only looking at Gina !

508
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Poor thing !
Look at all she's doing..

509
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
..to try and attract
your attention.

510
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You're blind !

511
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
-I'm off, I have a date.
Bye!

512
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

513
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I don't know
how the new one will be,..

514
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
..but'll never be worse than
that freak there with his tape recorder.

515
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
-Joseph's not really a freak.

516
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
He's hurting, that's all.

517
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
-It's been two months
since they broke up,..

518
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
..and he still shows up every day.
He likes to suffer !

519
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
-Don't tell me you
haven't noticed anything?

520
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
-What do you mean ?

521
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
-He always sits there?
-Well, yes.

522
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
-Sit down.

523
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Sit down, Georgette.

524
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
What can you see, from here?
-My shop.

525
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
-And there's nothing missing?
-Well, no.

526
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
-Think harder.

527
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
-Well, no.
Really, I can't see!

528
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
-I'll let you think about it.
Good night.

529
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Good morning...

530
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
"A Swiss octogenarian has received
a letter 30 years later.

531
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
"The mail was found by
mountaineers on the Mont-Blanc,..

532
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
"..in a bag
of the Malabar Princess,..

533
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
..a plane that crashed
at the end of the 60ies."

534
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
-What a pity !
Such a young and pretty princess...

535
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
-You mean, old and ugly,
that wouldn't have been that bad?

536
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
-Well, yes... Look at Mother Theresa.

537
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And him?
Still after Gina ?

538
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,800
-No, after somebody else.

539
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
-Tell me,
is it someone I know ?

540
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
-Yes. It's funny,
that story about the mountaineers.

541
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
-Somebody from the Deux Moulins ?
Not you!

542
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
-No !

543
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
-Not Mme Suzanne...

544
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
No !

545
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
-Yes !

546
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Look, he's there again.
-Yes... How strange.

547
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
-And here.
-"Still him."

548
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Lyon Station.

549
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
-And here, again.

550
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
March 5, Austerlitz.

551
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
-And still the same expression.

552
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Isn't it ? So neutral.

553
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
-12 times in total.

554
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I counted.
It's strange, isn't it?

555
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Why would he go across the whole
town to take photographs,..

556
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
..and then throw them away?

557
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
-Especially since they're
in perfect condition!

558
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
-Looks like some sort of ritual.

559
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
-Maybe he's obsessed..

560
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
..by the fear of getting old
and this is his way to relax.

561
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
-He's dead!

562
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
-Dead?

563
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
-He's afraid
of being forgotten.

564
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
He uses those machines
to remind the living of his face.

565
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
As if he were faxing
his image from the hereafter.

566
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
-A dead man who'd be
afraid of being forgotten...

567
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,800
Well, these ones don't
have to worry about that!

568
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
They died long time ago.

569
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
But they'll
never be forgotten.

570
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
You know,
that girl with the glass,..

571
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
..maybe she's thinking about someone.

572
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
-Somebody on the picture?

573
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
-No.

574
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Rather a young man
she saw some place else.

575
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,800
She feels like they're
the same, the two of 'em.

576
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,520
-She prefers to imagine a relationship
with somebody who's away,..

577
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
..than to create bonds with..

578
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
..those who are there?

579
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
-No...

580
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Maybe she's doing everything she can
to sort out other people's lives.

581
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
-But her ?

582
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Her life,..

583
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
..who's going to take care of that?

584
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
-In the meantime,..

585
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
..it's better to devote yourself
to others than to a garden-dwarf.

586
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
-2,8 g of alcohol in his blood
for a chauffeur!

587
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I'm not the only one to employ
an irresponsible moron.

588
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
-M. Collignon.

589
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Your keys...
-Just a minute!

590
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
No rush!

591
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Look at Lucien.

592
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
At work, there's no chance
he'll exceed the speed limits.  Is there?

593
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
-You shouldn't, M. Collignon.

594
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,800
It's not his fault.

595
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
-You're right.

596
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It's not his fault,
it's Lady Di's fault !

597
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Do you know
what I found this morning?..

598
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
..The 3 Suisses catalogue
open at the page with the nighties.

599
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
He'd stuck the picture of Lady Di
on the bodies of the models.

600
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
So, this time,
a bunch of asparagus,..

601
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
..or the neighbourhood records?

602
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
-Nothing.

603
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,320
"KEYS WHILE YOU WAIT"

604
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
-Thanks. Well, looks like those
migraines are gone.

605
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
-Yes, but I haven't slept all
night because of my sciatic nerve.

606
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
-You're looking good !

607
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
-Really ?

608
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
-A woman without love, it's
like a flower without sun. It dies.

609
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
-Strange weather today!

610
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Did I say something wrong?

611
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
-No.
Everyone gives me the weather forecast.

612
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
-Talking about the weather
to forget that time goes by.

613
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
-No, to avoid talking nonsense.

614
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
-You can write nonsense,
but not publish it...

615
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
-Still nothing?
-30th rejection.

616
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
-What about your cousin, the critic?
-What do you think?

617
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
They're like the cactus..

618
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
..they live to sting...
-And your book ?

619
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,600
Is it a love-story ?

620
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
-No, it's about a guy
who keeps a diary.

621
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
But instead of writing it
as things happen,..

622
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
..he writes the worst-case scenario
beforehand.

623
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
As a result, he's depressed,
and he doesn't do anything.

624
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,400
-It's the story of a guy
who doesn't do anything.

625
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,000
-Look, Mme Suzanne,..

626
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
..I'll sign you the manuscript.

627
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,400
-Yes, and you forget
about his bill.

628
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,000
-I exchange his masterpieces
for my "pièces-de-résistance!"

629
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

630
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
-Thanks, Mme Suzanne.

631
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
-How long
did it take you?

632
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Have you seen the time?
Jesus, this one,..

633
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
..they never got him finished!
