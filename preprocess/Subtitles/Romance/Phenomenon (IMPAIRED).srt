- D-Did you hear it?
- No.

150
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:57,702
[ Doc ] Could we finish
the game, George?

151
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:01,544
Man. I-I-It was like-- like--
like an explosion.

152
00:12:01,615 --> 00:12:02,900
- A-A-And-- And it was a flash--
- Like a plane?

153
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,265
- A-A-And-- And it was a flash--
- Like a plane?

154
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:06,996
No. It was bigger than that.
I-I-It was farther away.

155
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,698
Oh, you mean
like a star, George?

156
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:11,934
Man, it knocked me
off my feet.

157
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:14,944
- [ Doc ] You fell?
- Yeah, I fell! I was hit right--

158
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:19,346
- [ Laughing ] The man's inebriated.
- I warned you.

159
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:23,443
- I'm not drunk, Nate.
- I'm takin' your queen,
George. Now pay attention.

160
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:27,649
Isn't that checkmate?

161
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:31,057
That's checkmate, isn't it?

162
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:33,028
You mean he beat you?

163
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:37,226
- You let him win, Doc?
Birthday present?
- I-I didn't let him win anything.

164
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:39,826
You're a little pissed off
about that, aren't you?

165
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:43,339
- Play another one?
- You can get your revenge
on me tomorrow, all right?

166
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:45,375
- You feeling okay?
- Yep.

167
00:12:45,442 --> 00:12:47,433
- Can you drive, George?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

168
00:12:47,511 --> 00:12:50,503
Hey. Thanks, everybody.

169
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,071
- Happy birthday, buddy.
- Happy birthday, George.

170
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,516
That was a good party.

Duermes. Tu duermes.

172
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:08,798
Duerme. Duerme.

00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:35,355
- What?
- I figured it out.

179
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:38,553
Jesus, George! What are you doing
calling me? It's late.

180
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:40,926
I thought that farmers
got up when it was still dark.

181
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:43,592
That's if you have cows.

182
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,431
I don't have any cows, George.

183
00:13:46,503 --> 00:13:50,701
- Now, look. There's only one
explanation for that rabbit.
- What!

184
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:54,232
You see, when I built that fence higher
and deeper, he was already in there.

185
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:58,372
See? He was hiding.
I fenced him in! [ Laughs ]

186
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:02,782
- There's only one thing
I can do now, just let him out.
- Good night, George.

187
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:04,718
Good night.

Here's Roger.

00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:07,281
George, can I
have my Bronco back?

192
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,841
I don't have any cash right now,
but I need my car.

193
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,889
Well, I need some solar panels
installed on my roof.

I don't know anything
about solar.

Well, Charlie Shipper does. And, uh--
He needs a well dug on his property.

196
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:21,725
You help him dig the well, he'll help me
with the panels, and I'll fix your car.

197
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:25,461
- Deal?
- Yeah, deal!

198
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:29,962
I'll, uh--
I'll call Charlie.

Hi. I just called about,

- Tito. He speaks Spanish
better than I do now.

Yeah. Better than me too.

Right. Where is the owner
and operator of this vehicle?

00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:36,696
- You a cop?
- Our mom's in the store.

Mm-hmm. You got
the brake on, sport?

Well, I'm George.
Pop the hood, Al.

00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:51,019
Why?

213
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:54,545

- Mm, sorry. Gotta go.

Where? You're not, uh,
leavin' town, are you?

218
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:08,066
No. Just San Francisco
for the day.

219
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:10,936
Oh, I used to live there. Ask--
Ask me directions on where you're going.

220
00:17:11,007 --> 00:17:14,465
As a matter of fact, ask me
anything at all. You could
even ask me to come along.

221
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:16,512
I'd show you the sights, the hazards.
What do you think?

I think your idle's too fast.

- But you were born here, right?
- How'd you know I was born here?

224
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,517
Just now, in the store. Someone said,
'I've known George Malley all my life.

And if he said he saw a UFO,
he saw one.'

- But I didn't say what I saw.

- Well, it could've been!

is goin' on here? What?

Look, you know, I don't know, Doc.
I-I-I really don't know.

And books. I can't
stop feeding myself.

237
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:09,662
I-I read two-- two,
three books a day. Imagine that.

00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:13,931
And-- And-- You know, I can't stop,
and I-I-I can't sleep.

- And a boom.
- Now, did you hear it?

Well, no.
Anybody?

245
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:36,325
About nine days ago,
right outside here?

246
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:40,454
Was that 12:00, George?

247
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,658
George, come in
for a physical. Okay?

00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:54,309
- Two or three books a day?

- About what?
- About everything.

You know, all the things
I've wanted to know about and learn.

[ Chuckles ]
Well, you tell me, Rog.

254
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:05,853
I mean, what have you always
wanted to know about and learn?

255
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:08,584
Hmm?

I'm waiting for ignition

00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:27,601
I'm looking for a spark

259
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:32,740
Any chance collision
and I light up in the dark

260
00:19:32,816 --> 00:19:35,080
Such a nice emotion

All those introductions

So before a doubt

- Hey, George.
- Now, look, Nate.

283
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:05,596
You haven't sat 'til you've
put your ass on one of these
homemade willow chairs. Okay?

284
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:08,162
Now, I brought you a pair
so you can put your feet up,

285
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,937
or if you, uh, want a friend
to sit in there, if you decide
one day and invite someone over.

I don't think they go, George.

Oh, what would you know?
Looks like a swap meet blew in here.

289
00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:24,254
Talk about needin' a woman's touch.
This is an emergency.

290
00:21:24,323 --> 00:21:28,384
Hey, Nate. I've been workin'
on that solar kit you gave me.

291
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,020
I am telling you, the whole
field of photovoltaics is--

00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:33,030
is just in baby land!

293
00:21:33,098 --> 00:21:36,693
I mean-- You know--
The-- The idea that plants
have been storing and--

294
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:39,704
and using the sun's energy
since the birth of the world!

295
00:21:39,772 --> 00:21:43,765
I mean, photosynthesis is--
is a model for us, and we're
just scratching the surface...

296
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:46,037
of what we could do
with these silicon cells.

297
00:21:46,111 --> 00:21:48,773
I'm telling you.

'Watering the golds... Friday.'

be sending a coded message
like that in simple Morse?

Oh, man, look. I pick up, like

It still repeats.
Listen.

- Berto, onde esta?

00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:47,426
He's trying to tell us
something about Berto.

00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:50,527
- [ Groaning ]
- That's the little one.
It's a little boy.

600
00:41:50,604 --> 00:41:52,572
All right, some of you search
around here for the kid.

601
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,574
I'm gonna tell you right now
he could be pretty darn sick.

602

Now, Bonnie, wait.
Uh--

603

George Malley over here.

604
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,407
Tell him what's going on and
tell him to stop at the library
for a English-Portuguese book.

605
00:42:03,484 --> 00:42:08,547
Tell him to find out how to ask
where a lost boy is. Got that?

606
00:42:08,622 --> 00:42:11,887
- George Malley?
- You bet. [ Chuckles ]

607
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:14,154

- Not when I'm working.

00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:27,507
I been farmin' all my life,

611
00:42:27,575 --> 00:42:30,408
- [ Ringing Continues ]
- but this growth is amazing, George.

[ Laughs ]
This is embarrassing.

613
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:36,879
You know, I want to try
this fertilizer in your south 40.

614
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:39,977
You just sprayed my boots.
It's the worst soil in the county.

615
00:42:40,054 --> 00:42:42,284
I can't even get weeds
to grow in that field.

616
00:42:42,356 --> 00:42:44,722
But I bet we can get corn
to grow in that field.

617
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:47,989
You bet? You don't have
any money to bet.

618
00:42:48,062 --> 00:42:50,087
You spent all your money
on chairs, remember?

- Yeah, I'm George Malley.

00:43:07,781 --> 00:43:11,979
I-I'm John Ringold.
We talked on the phone the other day.

623
00:43:12,052 --> 00:43:14,987
- John Ringold? From Berkeley?
- Yes. Yes.

624
00:43:15,055 --> 00:43:16,989
- [ Laughs ] Right! Hi.
- Yeah.

625
00:43:17,057 --> 00:43:19,992
- Hey, I'm glad you came by.
- Will your dog let me step out?

626
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,257
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he just
has a thing for seismologists.

627
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,264
Now, come on out.

628
00:43:25,332 --> 00:43:27,596
- Thank you.
- Yeah, this is my friend, Nate Pope.

629
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:29,602
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

630
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:32,036
- L-Let me get you
a cold drink. Come on in.
- From the university, huh?

631
00:43:32,106 --> 00:43:34,040
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

632
00:43:34,108 --> 00:43:38,408
And, uh, we are very interested
in how you were able to predict
that earthquake, Mr.Malley.

633
00:43:38,479 --> 00:43:40,413
Oh, that.

634
00:43:40,481 --> 00:43:43,882
You see, I-I just picked up
the subsonic frequency waves, right?

635
00:43:43,951 --> 00:43:46,579
And, of course, I was standing
on the fault, so that made it easier.

636
00:43:46,654 --> 00:43:50,181
- What instrumentation did you use?
- Just me.

637
00:43:50,257 --> 00:43:53,488
If you think that's something,
you should see him move stuff
with his brain.

638
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,758
Nate! Never mind that. You see,
I felt the ultralow frequency waves.

639
00:43:57,831 --> 00:44:01,790
And they kind of made me dizzy
and nauseous, right? And
that's how I perceived all this.

640
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:05,999
We've been studying quake
prediction for ten years.

641
00:44:06,073 --> 00:44:10,100
There's no record of any person
ever feeling the prequake activity.

642
00:44:10,177 --> 00:44:12,270
Now there is.

643
00:44:14,081 --> 00:44:17,278
We have some ULF equipment
in our labs.

644
00:44:17,351 --> 00:44:19,285
Could you come in
for an experiment?

645
00:44:19,353 --> 00:44:21,287
- Come to Berkeley?
- Yes.

646
00:44:21,355 --> 00:44:24,017
[ Laughs ]
Yes.

647
00:44:24,091 --> 00:44:26,821
Well, my department would like
to interview you and clear this up.

648
00:44:26,894 --> 00:44:30,091
I-I would be-- I would be
so glad to come to Berkeley.

649
00:44:30,164 --> 00:44:33,133
D-Do you think that I could meet with--
with some other departments as well?

650

I'd like to show you. Come with me.

They're nice.

00:44:42,042 --> 00:44:44,013
All right.
Well, uh, let's see.

653
00:44:44,146 --> 00:44:48,082
Um. Oh, oh, yes, here.
Okay, now, look, um--

654
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:51,085
I've taken solar panels, and I've
actually germinated the seeds...

655
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:53,314
th-that made these--
th-th-these plants grow.

656
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:55,380
I'm trying to change the
electromagnetic field, right?

657
00:44:55,457 --> 00:44:58,620
- Uh, Mr.Malley?
- I took, uh, incandescent light...

658
00:44:58,694 --> 00:45:00,628
- Mr.Malley.
- and turned it into sunlight,

659
00:45:00,696 --> 00:45:02,630
which actually made these--
these plants grow.

660
00:45:02,698 --> 00:45:05,997
- Mr.Malley.
- Oh. Now look,
I-I-I took pig manure...

661
00:45:06,068 --> 00:45:10,027
and I turned it into a fuel, which I-I
believe will actually run an automobile.

662
00:45:10,105 --> 00:45:12,300
All I'm interested in
is the earthquake.

663
00:45:12,374 --> 00:45:15,366
We need to know
if that was a fluke.

A coincidence.

something with your mind?

got my garden out there, and
that acts like a lab, right?

He's gonna be fine, George,
but his grandson is missing.

686
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,560
Now, if they ate the same thing,
the boy could be a lot worse off.

- You brought the book?
- Yeah, I have it.

Okay. Ask him
where the boy is.

for work, man.

Thank you, George.

- Do you know what kind
of work she was lookin' for?

- All right, Nate.
- Thanks, George.

I found a housekeeper for you.
A Portuguese woman. She cooks too.

I think she's perfect for you.

I don't know if I could eat
Portuguese food, George.

Well, she'll cook you
anything you want, Nate.

All right. Well, let's try it.
What do you wanna say?

How about, uh, something like, um, um,
'Can you come twice a week?'

01:09:27,977 --> 01:09:30,343
I mean, I want my life.

1048
01:09:30,413 --> 01:09:33,075
I-I want my life.

1049
01:09:33,149 --> 01:09:36,585
[ Sighs ]
What do you want?

1050
01:09:36,653 --> 01:09:40,521
- It's not what I want.
- What do they want?

1051
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:43,354
They want to feel safe.

1052
01:09:43,426 --> 01:09:45,724
They don't feel safe
with you out there.

1053
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:50,095
Whoa. Why would they? They've been
havin' me break codes all night.

1054
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:52,100
Secret codes.
I mean-- There--

1055
01:09:52,168 --> 01:09:54,898
I shouldn't be listening to a code
from Britain to Saudi Arabia.

1056
01:09:54,971 --> 01:09:58,930
These are our allies! I-If you guys
are gonna accuse me of a crime...

1057
01:09:59,008 --> 01:10:02,375
or keep me here,
uh, I'll tell the press.

1058
01:10:02,445 --> 01:10:04,879
Or I'll call London
or Riyadh.

1059
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:09,077
I know all the, uh,
capitals now, by the way.

1060
01:10:09,152 --> 01:10:11,712
You can test me.

1061
01:10:11,788 --> 01:10:16,191
My interest in Mr.Malley has to do
with seismology and geology.

1062
01:10:16,259 --> 01:10:19,387
It has nothing to do
with security issues.

1063
01:10:19,462 --> 01:10:22,920
Oh, I know. But that's
not the point. Mr.Malley has
been released without charges.

1064
01:10:22,999 --> 01:10:26,230
But he is considered
a security risk.

1065
01:10:26,302 --> 01:10:28,930
I'll be frank with you.
He's an unknown quantity.

1066
01:10:29,005 --> 01:10:31,997
We'd feel better,
for the time being,

1067
01:10:32,075 --> 01:10:34,339
if he wasn't granted any access
to the institutions...

1068
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:36,901
where sensitive government projects
are in the works.

1069
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:40,471
- Access?
- Access even to personnel.

[ Knock At Door ]

1071
01:10:45,088 --> 01:10:47,056
- [ George ] Lace!
- Oh.

1072
01:10:47,123 --> 01:10:49,956
- I-It's me.
- [ Sighs ]

1073
01:10:57,567 --> 01:10:59,432
- Hi.
- Hi.

1074
01:10:59,502 --> 01:11:02,027
Sorry I-- I didn't come
through the front door,

1075
01:11:02,105 --> 01:11:05,199
- but I was so afraid
I'd wake the kids.
- Oh, that's okay. That's okay.

1076
01:11:05,274 --> 01:11:08,869
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I wanted to see you.

1077
01:11:08,945 --> 01:11:12,244
- [ Sighs ]
Nate told me about the FBI.
- [ Groans ]

1078
01:11:12,315 --> 01:11:15,250
- I'm so glad they let you go.
- Yeah, well, they had no choice.

1079
01:11:15,318 --> 01:11:18,082
But they-- they are
watching me so closely.

1080
01:11:18,154 --> 01:11:20,850
I think I scare them.

1081
01:11:24,193 --> 01:11:26,593
You scare me too.

1082
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:30,154
I do?

1083
01:11:30,233 --> 01:11:32,827
Hmm.

1084
01:11:32,902 --> 01:11:36,929
[ Sniffles ]
Listen, George.

1085
01:11:37,006 --> 01:11:40,237
It's getting really
complicated. I just--

1086
01:11:40,309 --> 01:11:43,107
I just don't know
what's gonna happen next.

1087
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:50,446
I should probably
leave you alone, shouldn't I?

1088
01:11:55,224 --> 01:11:57,158
I-- I guess so.

1089
01:12:06,302 --> 01:12:08,236
I'll see you.

1090
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:11,373
[ Whispers ]
Good-bye.

1091
01:12:22,585 --> 01:12:24,519
[ Sighs ]

1092
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:27,522
Hey.

1093
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:31,822
- You want a beer, George?
- Yup.

1094
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:35,057
Look, Nate.

1095
01:12:35,131 --> 01:12:38,430
I am really sorry
for what happened. Okay?

1096
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:41,368
I told them everything, George.

1097
01:12:41,437 --> 01:12:45,498
I told them everything
about you. Everything.

1098
01:12:45,575 --> 01:12:49,136
Well, you know, that's
supposed to happen. Okay?

1099
01:12:49,212 --> 01:12:52,477
- I mean, you know, it's, uh--
- You just think you're
not gonna be so scared.

1100
01:12:52,548 --> 01:12:55,949
And you're just sittin' there.
You don't know what's gonna happen.

1101
01:12:56,018 --> 01:12:59,044
And then all of a sudden,
something happens inside you, right?

1102
01:12:59,121 --> 01:13:01,817
You don't know
what it is, but--

1103
01:13:01,891 --> 01:13:05,088
It's all right.
I-It was my game. You know?

1104
01:13:11,085 --> 01:13:13,019
What'd they do to you, George?

1105
01:13:13,087 --> 01:13:16,523
[ Exhales ]
They tested me.

1106
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:19,058
Wh-What'd they find out?

1107
01:13:20,628 --> 01:13:23,597
[ Sighs ]
I'm pregnant.

1108
01:13:23,664 --> 01:13:25,757
- [ Chuckles ]
- That's how it feels.

1109
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:30,133
- How what feels?
- You know, to be full of ideas
and you can't deliver. Okay?

1110
01:13:30,204 --> 01:13:32,900
I mean, you know, you're ready
to break out, and you can't deliver!

1111
01:13:32,973 --> 01:13:36,704
Y-You know, uh, this professor,
he won't even talk to me.
He won't even talk to me.

1112
01:13:36,777 --> 01:13:40,042
- You're not going
to Berkeley, George?
- Come on. Me at Berkeley?

1113
01:13:40,114 --> 01:13:44,448
- That's a thought, huh?
- I'm sorry, buddy.

1114
01:13:44,518 --> 01:13:46,452
You mean inventions?
You got inventions?

1115
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,681
No, no, ideas. Okay?
I got a thousand ideas a day.

1116
01:13:48,756 --> 01:13:53,056
E-Every d-damn minute! Okay?
B-Big 'holy cow' kind of ideas.

1117
01:13:53,127 --> 01:13:55,061
And little 'what if' ideas, all right?

1118
01:13:55,129 --> 01:13:57,290
I-I got you-- ideas for you,
Jimmy. Look at this.

1119
01:13:57,364 --> 01:13:59,298
Look at this. Your parking lot.
It's laid out all wrong, okay?

1120
01:13:59,366 --> 01:14:01,857
Now, if you just
follow this, right?

1121
01:14:01,936 --> 01:14:04,097
You can put six more cars in,
and nobody gets fender benders.

1122
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:06,196
All right? Where's Paulette?
Where is she?

1123
01:14:06,273 --> 01:14:09,436
Bonnie. Here. Take this.
It's a new route for her mail, okay?

1124
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:12,308
Now, if she does this, she can
save an hour a day and everybody
gets their mail by 3:00.

1125
01:14:12,379 --> 01:14:16,816
Imagine! 3:00. Oh, and I got
a 'holy shit' idea too. Look at this.

1126
01:14:16,884 --> 01:14:20,320
Now, this may be the most
efficient way to store solar
energy. Okay? Take it!

1127
01:14:20,387 --> 01:14:22,287
- Well, what am I gonna do with it?
- What the hell...

1128
01:14:22,356 --> 01:14:24,290
am I supposed to do
with it, huh?

1129
01:14:24,358 --> 01:14:26,292
You know what that light was?
You know what that sound was?

1130
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,225
- Tell us. Well, tell us!
- I'm gonna tell you what it was.

1131
01:14:28,295 --> 01:14:30,786
- It was a damn alien!
- Don't say that.
You don't know what it was.

1132
01:14:30,864 --> 01:14:33,389
- I know what it is, Nate.
- You don't know what it was!
Don't say that!

1133
01:14:33,467 --> 01:14:35,992
- Well, tell us!
- It's a goddamn mistake is what it is!

1134
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:40,097
Okay? It was supposed
to happen to someone smart.
Someone-- Someone scientific.

1135
01:14:40,174 --> 01:14:43,610
Someone who's a leader.
But it didn't. It happened
to me, George freakin' Malley!

1136
01:14:43,677 --> 01:14:46,339
Look at him!
Now, look at him! Look!

1137
01:14:50,351 --> 01:14:52,945
[ Sighs ]

1138
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,954
Jimmy.

1139
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:58,558
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1140
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,528
- I'm sorry.
- Well, i-it's all right.

1141
01:15:02,596 --> 01:15:05,588
- I-I-I'll pay for it.
- All right.

1142
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:10,694
Bonnie. Bonnie, please.
I-It's okay.

1143
01:15:12,206 --> 01:15:14,140
Oh, man.

1144
01:15:25,686 --> 01:15:28,917
Mm-hmm.

1145
01:15:28,989 --> 01:15:33,289
- Okay.
- Who was that? A customer?

1146
01:15:34,728 --> 01:15:37,288
It's Banes. He says
he can't work here no more.

1147
01:15:37,364 --> 01:15:39,764
Sorry.

1148
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:41,801
Well, why didn't he
talk to me?

1149
01:15:41,869 --> 01:15:43,803
Little bit scared, I guess.

1150
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:47,705
- Jesus Christ.
- Look, George. It'll wear off.

1151
01:15:47,775 --> 01:15:50,369
They'll forget. Their cars
are gonna break down--

1152
01:15:50,444 --> 01:15:52,378
- Hi.
- Hey, Doc.

1153
01:15:52,446 --> 01:15:54,380
Hi.

What is it?

1155
01:15:58,485 --> 01:16:00,646
- I don't know.
- Telekinesis? What?

1156
01:16:00,721 --> 01:16:03,349
- Yeah, maybe. Uh, maybe, yeah.
- Think it's gettin out of hand?

1157
01:16:03,424 --> 01:16:07,485
Look, look. I-- I was mad,
all right? I was pissed off,
and I'm not mad now, okay?

1158
01:16:07,561 --> 01:16:11,759
Good. I'll sound the all clear,
call off the paratroopers. [ Laughs ]

1159
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:14,665
Jesus, George.
Now, listen.

1160
01:16:14,735 --> 01:16:17,863
- You owe me a CAT scan.
I want more blood.
- Mm-hmm.

1161
01:16:17,938 --> 01:16:23,308
- Also, you look like hell.
- Aah. That's good. Doc, what's
the matter with everybody?

1162
01:16:23,377 --> 01:16:25,777
They won't give me a chance
to explain anything.

1163
01:16:25,846 --> 01:16:29,441
I look-- I look at them,
and they-- they look at me like
I'm a green bug or something!

1164
01:16:29,516 --> 01:16:31,780
- Give them some time, George.
- Now, look! I have an idea.

1165
01:16:31,852 --> 01:16:33,786
Now, you look at this.
Now, look at this.

1166
01:16:33,854 --> 01:16:36,914
Now, look at that. Now, I-I'm
a big deal at the Harmon library.

1167
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:39,049
I-I can take up to 30 books
a night. Okay?

1168
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:42,220
And I told them I'd be part of this.
I said that I-I'd put out a table.

1169
01:16:42,296 --> 01:16:44,389
- Pressure is way up there.
- Then I would sit there, and
they could ask me questions.

1170
01:16:44,465 --> 01:16:47,025
You know, 'Meet George Malley.'
What do you think?

1171
01:16:47,101 --> 01:16:50,366
- Uh, like a circus attraction.
- Oh, God, Doc. Please?

1172
01:16:50,437 --> 01:16:54,373
You know, I-- See, I-I can explain
to them once and for all.

1173
01:16:54,441 --> 01:16:58,275
I-I could share my ideas with
them. Y-You know. And then I-I
could get my life back together.

1174
01:16:58,345 --> 01:17:01,906
Come see me for that scan.
Take it easy on sugar and salt. Okay?

1175
01:17:01,982 --> 01:17:06,180
And do like I told you all your life:
Breathe in and out. Okay, George?

1176
01:17:06,253 --> 01:17:08,619
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.

- [ Glory ] Come on, give it.
- [ Al ] No.

1180
01:18:34,374 --> 01:18:37,309
- Give it! Come on!
- No! You're not careful.
You'll break it.

- [ Glory ] Please,
I just wanna look at it.

Hey. That's dangerous, sweetie.

- He bought it.
- What?

1184
01:18:50,123 --> 01:18:54,389
It's a piece of the mirror George broke.
Richard Smick is selling them at school.

1185

- Oh, you're kidding.
- It's hot! Feel it.

1186
01:18:57,431 --> 01:19:01,765
- That's not hot!
- Richard said the aliens probably
took George Malley away...

1187
01:19:01,835 --> 01:19:05,202
- and put this man in his place.
- This man?

01:19:05,272 --> 01:19:07,672
Like he's not human.

1189
01:19:07,741 --> 01:19:11,438
That's really dumb.
And it's really mean.

1190
01:19:11,512 --> 01:19:15,539
Can't they just look in his eyes
and see who he is? Can't you?

1191
01:19:15,616 --> 01:19:20,451
Do you remember when Daddy left,
how people treated us differently?

1192
01:19:20,521 --> 01:19:22,785
Even our so-called friends?

1193
01:19:25,058 --> 01:19:29,586
Remember how much it hurt?
You don't do that to people.

1194
01:19:31,532 --> 01:19:33,466
How much you pay for that?

1195
01:19:33,534 --> 01:19:36,560
- A... quarter.
- A dollar.

1196
01:19:36,637 --> 01:19:41,370
- What's the truth, Al?
- I paid a dollar. I was gonna
check it with my magnets.

1197
01:19:41,441 --> 01:19:43,705
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1198
01:19:43,777 --> 01:19:46,541
- Do you see something
really strange in there?
- What?

1199
01:19:46,613 --> 01:19:49,514
- What?
- A sucker.

1200
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,947
- No.
- You paid a dollar for nothing.

- You're a goner!
- Nice job, Al! [ Giggles ]

Hi.

I just--
I just called you.

- You did?
- Mmm. Come in. Come in.

- [ Clears Throat ]
- I'm so-- so glad you came.

Well, I was just--

1211

Why-- Why were you calling?

1212
01:20:53,246 --> 01:20:57,046
I found some things out, Lace.

1213
01:20:57,117 --> 01:21:00,518
Things, uh,
are coming clearer to me.

1214
01:21:00,587 --> 01:21:02,612
Or at least they're--
they're starting to.

1215
01:21:02,689 --> 01:21:04,987
- Things?
- Mmm.

1216
01:21:06,326 --> 01:21:08,419
I want to talk
to the people, Lace.

1217
01:21:08,495 --> 01:21:10,895
I-I don't want them to be
scared of me or-- or frightened.

1218
01:21:10,964 --> 01:21:15,765
I-I mean, I wanna--
I wanna tell them what I know.

1219
01:21:15,836 --> 01:21:20,330
So I've-- I've decided
to speak at the library fair.

Do you-- Do you think that
they'll listen to me?

What would they do?
[ Chuckles ] Throw stones?

1222

Oh, my God. Please, sit down.
I can't believe this.

1223

- Would you like something
to drink? A beer?
- No.

What? What can I get you?

I can hear her heartbeat

From a thousand miles

And the heavens open up

living organism in the world is?

Okay. It's a grove of aspen trees
in Colorado, acres of aspens.

1329
01:28:06,589 --> 01:28:09,251
Okay. Now, they thought
they were disconnected, separate.

But, indeed, they found out
that they weren't.

with the same root system.

is that this would not be

and, uh, do this operation...

what would, uh--

an autopsy. That's all we'll do.

as useful.

The study of a living,
active brain would tell us volumes.

1452
01:36:31,491 --> 01:36:34,016
All right, so, if you were
to do this operation, wouldn't
it most likely kill me...

- I might prolong his life, yes.
- Bullshit.

Nope.

Never. No, never.

He didn't want anything from anybody!

And you people have to tear him down
so you can sleep better tonight?

01:53:04,673 --> 01:53:07,039
Now, you have to listen to me now.

1640
01:53:07,109 --> 01:53:09,043
What?

1641
01:53:12,782 --> 01:53:14,716
It's happening.

1642
01:53:14,784 --> 01:53:17,184
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

1643
01:53:17,253 --> 01:53:20,086
No. Wait, George. Wait.

1644
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:25,117
- No.
- And it's gonna be okay.

1645
01:53:26,195 --> 01:53:29,562
- George.
- It's okay.

1646
01:53:29,632 --> 01:53:32,226
It's gonna be okay.

1647
01:53:33,302 --> 01:53:35,236
Okay.

1648
01:53:38,073 --> 01:53:42,567
- Good-bye, honey.
- No.

1649
01:53:55,524 --> 01:53:57,458
Oh.

1650
01:54:01,063 --> 01:54:02,997
Oh.

1651
01:54:27,857 --> 01:54:31,588
Hello. I'm John Ringold.
I'm here to see George Malley.

1652
01:54:33,829 --> 01:54:36,320
Oh! I'm sorry, John.

1653
01:54:36,398 --> 01:54:40,027
George Malley
passed away last night.

1654
01:54:41,437 --> 01:54:44,964
Wh--
I-I'm sorry.

1655
01:54:50,713 --> 01:54:53,238
He left these for you.

1656
01:54:57,753 --> 01:55:00,847
He said they're not finished.

1657
01:55:00,923 --> 01:55:02,857
You'll have to do it.

1658
01:55:07,229 --> 01:55:09,356
I'll do my best.

1659
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:13,800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1660
01:55:16,972 --> 01:55:21,136
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

1661

[ Sighs ]

1664
01:56:45,628 --> 01:56:47,562
Thank you, sweetie.

- [ Chuckles ]

1666
01:57:37,317 --> 01:57:40,150
- Nate, they'll be waiting for you.
- We're comin'. We're comin'.

1667
01:57:44,123 --> 01:57:47,718
If I could reach the stars

1668
01:57:49,062 --> 01:57:52,225
Pull one down for you

1669
01:57:53,933 --> 01:57:56,959
Shine it on my heart

1670
01:57:58,871 --> 01:58:02,898
So you could see the truth

1671
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:08,709
That this love
I have inside

1672
01:58:08,781 --> 01:58:12,123
- Is everything it seems
- [ Nate ] Beautiful.

1673
01:58:12,123 --> 01:58:12,612
- Is everything it seems
- [ Nate ] Beautiful.

1674
01:58:13,757 --> 01:58:16,248
But for now I find

1675
01:58:16,327 --> 01:58:19,592
- Whoo. Whoo.
- [ Speaking Portuguese ]

1676
01:58:19,663 --> 01:58:22,655
- It's only in my dreams
- It's okay. It's okay.

1677
01:58:22,733 --> 01:58:27,136
- But I can't change the world
- [ Jimmy ] Hey, Nate!

1678
01:58:27,204 --> 01:58:31,504
- Hi, Ella!
- You look beautiful.
What am I gonna do with this?

1679
01:58:31,575 --> 01:58:37,275
- What am I gonna do?
- You would think my love
was really something good

1680
01:58:37,348 --> 01:58:40,545
- [ Everyone Chattering ]
- Baby, if you knew that I

1681
01:58:40,618 --> 01:58:44,076
- Could change
- Not here.

1682
01:58:44,155 --> 01:58:46,089
- The world
- It's not here.
Tell you where it is.

1683
01:58:46,157 --> 01:58:49,786
- It's right there!
- How did you do that?

1684
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:52,328
- How did I do that? It's magic.
- [ Bonnie ] Good job.

1685
01:58:52,396 --> 01:58:54,330
Can you hear her?
She just kicked.

1686
01:58:54,398 --> 01:58:56,332
- [ Tito ] Baby, huh?
- Yeah.

1687
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:59,233
- Change the world
- Have a cold one.

1688
01:58:59,303 --> 01:59:01,931
- You gettin' any rest?
- [ Sighs ] Not much.

1689
01:59:02,006 --> 01:59:05,442
Well, get it now, because there's
no sleepin' once the baby gets here.

1690
01:59:05,509 --> 01:59:09,468
- You would think my love
was really something good
- Check.

1691
01:59:09,547 --> 01:59:12,778
Baby, if I could

1692
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:17,651
- Change
- Go on now. Think it through.
Think it through.

1693
01:59:17,721 --> 01:59:21,384
The world

1694
01:59:21,458 --> 01:59:24,586
[ Everyone Chattering ]

1695
01:59:45,515 --> 01:59:49,679
Ah, ah

1696
01:59:56,826 --> 01:59:59,488
I was thinkin' out loud

1697
02:00:01,865 --> 02:00:06,768
One life's such a short time
for love

1698
02:00:06,836 --> 02:00:11,170
When a match made in heaven
arrives

1699
02:00:11,241 --> 02:00:15,337
Eternity is never enough

1700
02:00:17,847 --> 02:00:20,975
I need to dance

1701
02:00:21,051 --> 02:00:22,985
With life

1702
02:00:23,053 --> 02:00:27,888
Sweep you away
into the night

1703
02:00:27,958 --> 02:00:33,362
When there is no one else around

1704
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:38,197
I will make every day count

1705
02:00:38,268 --> 02:00:41,704
We need to dance

1706
02:00:41,771 --> 02:00:43,705
With life

1707
02:00:43,773 --> 02:00:48,836
Swim in the soul
of your eyes

1708
02:00:48,912 --> 02:00:54,009
'Til we melt
into the ground

1709
02:00:54,084 --> 02:00:59,545
Oh, we need to dance
with life

1710
02:00:59,623 --> 02:01:05,118
And leave a brilliant light

1711
02:01:05,195 --> 02:01:07,561
Behind

1712
02:01:07,631 --> 02:01:12,261
It's no secret
how I feel

1713
02:01:12,335 --> 02:01:15,202
This special moment
I love you

1714
02:01:15,271 --> 02:01:19,173
You seem to cover me up

1715
02:01:19,242 --> 02:01:22,211
And hide me deep

1716
02:01:22,278 --> 02:01:24,803
Deep in me

1717
02:01:24,881 --> 02:01:28,339
To dance with life

1718
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:40,358
Breathe the sweet, fresh air

1719
02:01:42,365 --> 02:01:47,393
And make every second
your last

1720
02:01:47,470 --> 02:01:51,839
And I'll touch you
A full moon shall wake you

1721
02:01:51,908 --> 02:01:56,277
Make the most of the present
and the past

1722
02:01:58,515 --> 02:02:01,609
I need to dance

1723
02:02:01,685 --> 02:02:03,619
With life

1724
02:02:03,687 --> 02:02:08,715
Sweep you away
into the night

1725
02:02:08,792 --> 02:02:14,492
When there is no one else
around

1726
02:02:14,564 --> 02:02:19,024
I will make every day count

1727
02:02:19,102 --> 02:02:22,299
We need to dance

1728
02:02:22,372 --> 02:02:24,306
With life

1729
02:02:24,374 --> 02:02:29,539
Swim in the soul
of your eyes

02:02:29,612 --> 02:02:35,175
'Til we melt
into the ground

Oh, we need to dance
with life

1732
02:02:40,056 --> 02:02:45,653
And leave a brilliant light

1733
02:02:45,729 --> 02:02:50,757
Leave a brilliant light

1734
02:02:50,834 --> 02:02:56,170
Leave a brilliant light

1735
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:58,264
Behind
