I can't.

when they'd hit one,
the desert would rain oil.

Yeah.

687

the following is the...

- Eye.

Behind the eye is the rest
of the surveillance team,

who cannot see the rabbit
but follow the eye.

As the rabbit travels,

747
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:21,573
the teammates will rotate
themselves into the eye position

748
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,739
so that the rabbit doesn't
realize he's being followed.

Rabbit, don't forget,
your choke points

I wanted you to see this.

of Worcester, Mass.

However, her real last name
isn't Moore... it's Nasari.

Birth mother is Algerian,
father's French.

It's all there...

She's a mole, James.

I don't believe it.
This is crazy.

938

How the hell
did she get into the farm...

939
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:13,346
We wanted her in.

940
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:16,257
We want her to burrow in
as deep as she can,

941
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:18,795
because then, she'll lead us
to her handlers.

942
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,420
We know exactly
what she wants.

943
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:24,058
It's who she's giving it to...
that's what we need to know.

944
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:27,126
Layla's gonna take us
right up the food chain.

945
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,831
I won't do it.

946
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,271
You won't do it?

James...

948
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:37,105
why do you think I came
to Cambridge to recruit you?

949
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:39,274
Nobody's chasing CTs anymore.

950
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,580
I mean, our applications
are through the roof.

951

No accidents.

953
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,024
You and Layla were matched.

954
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:50,856
She's an orphan.

955
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:53,192
You're a young man
searching for a father.

956
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:56,062
You're both highly motivated,
you're both highly independent.

957
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:58,658
You even look good together.

958
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:02,965
We paired you at the farm, son.

959
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,440
We paired you, remember?

960
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:07,534
The Blue Ridge barhop?

961
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:10,102
The lie detector session?

962
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,239
The choke point test?

963
00:54:12,316 --> 00:54:14,807
And it worked, didn't it?

964
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:16,750
She trusts you.

965
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,253
Loves you, maybe.

966
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:21,655
And you're gonna take
that trust and that love

967
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:24,421
and you're gonna use it to
find out who she's working for.

968
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,399
James...

969
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:36,598
My first posting was
in Italy... Trieste.

970
00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:39,768
A physics conference
met there every summer.

971
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:43,609
So I meet this local girl...
beautiful, sweet.

972
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:47,344
She's working for the Russian
group as a secretary.

973
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:50,945
Anyway, I did my job.
I worked her. I turned her.

974
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,546
Pretty soon, she's giving me
everything, you know...

975
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,559
I mean,
really high-grade stuff...

976
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:59,596
and, uh, I'm a hero.

977
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,860
But I'm still a kid, two years,
fresh out of Ocala, Florida.

978
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:05,663
I got this perfect Italian girl,
and she's crazy for me,

979
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:07,226
and we're falling in love.

980
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:11,035
I knew the Russians were
getting close to her.

981
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:14,077
I knew she was
in jeopardy, but...

982
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,941
material was valuable.

983
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:19,012
I could've warned her.

984
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:23,076
I could've saved her.

985
00:55:24,455 --> 00:55:27,185
But the information
was more important.

986
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,221
You understand?

987
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:34,788
The information was more
important than she was...

988
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:37,993
more important than I was.

989
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,867
It is what we do.

990
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:50,579
I need to think about it.

991
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:53,138
Oh, come on.
"Think about it."

992
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:56,582
You got 24 hours.
