- Yes! That's how you move the ball.

Listen to this, the leitmotiv.
It's beautiful.

305
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:36,276
Ooh, yeah, unbelievable.
Turn the page, Thomas. Turn the page.

Okay, fold that out

Hey, could we muzzle
this Mario Lanza guy?

It's Franco Corelli, for God's sakes!

Neither of you
bets on the horses?

You... Talk to anyone

Well, your son has been
seen at the track.

He's telling the story...

That old battle-ax has no idea how to
handle a precocious child like Thomas.

Thomas has a serious problem. He blames
everything on these imaginary people!

I've been saying for years we should
get him proper care, and you know it!

343

come we're stuck to him? Tell me that.

So, what? What, we don't
let him see us or hear us?

What, we never even
talk to him?

okay? It will be a secret.

451
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,137
- What?
- [Equipment Drilling Continues]

452
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:26,404
Look, I'm not bankrupt.
I'm just behind a little.

453
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:31,141
A little behind,
6.4 million, $6,429,089.

454
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:35,914
We're gonna reorganize under chapter 11,
so it's gonna take some time.

455
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:40,480
So you and the others are just
gonna have to wait for your money.

456
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:42,821
See, we have waited,

457
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:47,455
and we've watched you drain
more money out of this company.

458
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:50,295
Think you can
take me on, Reilly?

459
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:54,326
If you think you have
a case for reorganization,

460
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,498
convince the judge.

461
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:02,372
[Milo] How many more years of this?
Huh? When's he gonna retire?

462
00:33:04,114 --> 00:33:07,675
It's amazing these things
can get off the ground.

463
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:17,588
Look, Tim, I paid you 185 bucks
to detail my car, and you know what l...

464
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:20,789
No. I'm seeing streaks, streaks
on the windshield, streaks on the dash,

465
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:23,765
so I'm gonna bring it back in
Saturday, waste my weekend...

466
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:26,200
allowing you to explore
your incompetence, all right?

467
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,602
Oh, by the way...
[Dial Tone]

468
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:32,904
- I hate that phone. He's always on it.
- Saves him time.

469
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:35,968
Doesn't save him enough time to call
his mother and his father, does it?

470
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:38,412
[Telephone Rings, Beeps]

471
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:40,575
- Yeah?
- Hi, it's Noelle.

472
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,950
- What do ya got for me?
- A staff meeting this afternoon,
and Anne called.

473
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:46,615
- She cancelled your lunch at Post Trio.
- She did? Why?

474
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,158
She found this great new place,
nobody knows about it.

475
00:33:49,226 --> 00:33:51,558
You should just meet her there.
Here's the address.

476
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:56,155
[Penny] Oh, I know this place.
I used to come here when I was a kid.

477
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:59,566
- Isn't it beautiful?
- But it isn't a restaurant, is it?

478
00:33:59,636 --> 00:34:02,264
[Milo] Nah, it's full of plants
and flowers and stuff.

479
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:06,241
You know what? I broke into this joint.
Mid-50s, Valentine's Day.

480
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,244
My girlfriend needed flowers.

481
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:11,543
[Harrison] At least it's not crowded.
I hate it when people walk through me.

482
00:34:11,615 --> 00:34:13,879
- Wow!
- [Milo] It depends on who it is.

483
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,545
[Harrison] That's another place
where we're different, Milo.

484
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,283
I always considered it
an invasion of my personal space.

485
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:25,353
[Thomas]
Sorry I'm late, honey.

486
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:31,434
- God, how did you get them
to let you use this place?
- They owe me.

487
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:35,131
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I did the P.R.
For their fund-raiser last year.

488
00:34:35,205 --> 00:34:37,469
Mmm.

489
00:34:43,747 --> 00:34:46,511
Stop it with your
"What's she getting me into?" look.

490
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:49,279
Oh, come on, Anne. You know,
you're... you're doing something here.

491
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,446
Yeah, lunch.

492
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:56,058
Well, it looks good.

493
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:59,289
[Clears Throat, Sighs]

494
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:03,959
- Ahhh, Barbados.
- Right. Very good.

495
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:07,162
Yeah, it was the closest
I could come on my lunch break.

496
00:35:07,237 --> 00:35:10,536
[Sighs]
So... relax, eat.

497
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,503
I'm just trying to get us
out of our routine.

498
00:35:17,314 --> 00:35:19,748
- Barbados?
- Where they first met.

499
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,808
Don't you remember anything?

500
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:28,957
I like this girl. Much better
than little Miss "Look At My Butt.

00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:31,756
- Everybody, Thomas, look at my butt."
- [Men Laughing]

502
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:35,595
What about the other one with the legs?
I'm telling you...

503
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:38,066
this is the one.

504
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:41,798
You don't think she's getting
fed up with him already, do you?

505
00:35:41,872 --> 00:35:45,467
Just because we do the same thing over
and over again doesn't, you know...

506
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:47,567
You call that routine?

507
00:35:47,644 --> 00:35:52,377
Well, yeah, sure, anybody would.
I mean, so would... my parents.

508
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:54,383
- Speaking of my parents,
- Uh-huh?

509
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:57,852
They're gonna be in town tomorrow night,
and we'd love you to stop by.

510
00:35:57,921 --> 00:36:02,449
- It's no big deal. If you're around.
- Uh-huh.

511
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:05,290
Bingo. Thirty seconds,
he's out of here.

512
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:08,388
No! It's high time
he should meet her parents.

513
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:10,865
Oh, God.
The parent moment, right?

514
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:14,836
Come on, Thomas. She's not gonna
wait around forever. Don't blow it.

515
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:18,397
- Marry her, don't marry her.
- Phone me when it's over.

516
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:20,841
Okay, the parent moment.

517
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,111
I don't have any problem
with meeting your parents.

518
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:29,709
- At some point.
- "At some point"?

God, you know,
listen to you.

520

Any time things get remotely
serious, you start...

521
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,553
I don't know,
wiggling around.

522
00:36:40,697 --> 00:36:42,631
Hmm?

523
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:45,600
I thought you liked it
when I wiggled around.

God, where did I go wrong?

525

Guy likes to play the field,
you know. Takes after me.

takes after you.

Oh, Julia, you're killin' me.

You're killin' me. Oh, yeah,

[Clears Throat]
You guys. Oh.

It... is... time, whoo.

"It's time, whoo"?

All right, all right, all right.
I'm a little late. L...

535
00:37:42,158 --> 00:37:45,150
I should have picked you up
about 15 or 20 years ago,

536
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:48,459
but, you know, up there,
time's a little relative.

537
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,995
Let's go, dead people.

538
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,444
Time to, you know,
t-t-to go.

[Bus Driver]
I'm taking you onwards.

540

I know you.

541
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:12,414
You're the bus driver.

00:38:12,488 --> 00:38:15,582
Very good. Now come on.

You're the idiot
that got us all killed.

Yeah.
You lousy bastard.

coolin' my heels
with Mr. Excitement here.

I, I can't get a decent meal,
I can't get a smoke...

and especially,
I can't get laid.

You've turned me
into a goddamn monk!

Hey, back off!
I died in that crash too.

551

We are so sorry.

Aren't you even gonna
apologize for what you did?

553
00:38:47,356 --> 00:38:51,656
Well, I-I'm doin' penance. I'm drivin'
this bus around for the next 500 years.

554
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:53,752
Believe me, I'm sorry.

555
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:58,062
- It's not like they gave me
the opportunities that you got.
- Opportunities?

556
00:38:58,134 --> 00:39:02,901
- For what?
- We know we're not dead.
We know we're not alive.

00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:07,170
We know we're not there.
For that matter, we're not here.

What, what is... What is this?
What am I, in the Twilight Zone here?

561
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:20,322
I'm talking about the opportunity
to resolve your lives.

562
00:39:22,692 --> 00:39:27,720
You know, you get to do the one thing
you would've done before you died...

563
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:31,358
except you didn't get to do it
on account of some guy...

unintentionally cut your lives
a little... short.

We haven't done anything.
We haven't resolved anything!

I mean, you were told
about this?

568
00:39:46,616 --> 00:39:51,485
The angel, he came down, he explained
it to you? That, that you would...

569
00:39:54,824 --> 00:39:58,487
Okay, hold it.
A-all right, hold it.

570
00:39:58,561 --> 00:40:01,553
All right, back off, back off.

[Sighs]

575
00:40:16,712 --> 00:40:18,839
Well, you see, what you're
supposed to have done...

576
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:22,373
is to take care of the one thing that
would have made your lives complete.

577
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:25,284
You know, I mean I'm not talkin'
about makin' a million dollars,

578
00:40:25,354 --> 00:40:28,551
- or shackin' up with some
pinup girl or something.
- Shackin' up with some pinup...

579
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:30,558
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

580
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:32,890
Well, how in the world are we
supposed to do that? We're spirits.

581
00:40:32,962 --> 00:40:34,987
We can't make a phone call.
We can't...

582
00:40:35,064 --> 00:40:38,124
Punch some bus driver
in the chops.

583
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,498
Your corporeal being.

584
00:40:42,271 --> 00:40:45,069
You're supposed to use him
as a vehicle.

585
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:48,008
And if he won't do it, you enter
his body and you make him do it.

586
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:51,410
- Enter his body?
- We can take him over?

587
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,643
Well, that would've
been helpful to know.

588
00:40:54,717 --> 00:40:57,845
I knew there was a reason
for all of this.

589
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,789
Yeah, yeah, sure. It's all part
of the grand scheme of things.

590
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:07,488
Which is worth diddly if someone
doesn't get his halo down here
and tell you what's goin' on.

591
00:41:07,563 --> 00:41:11,329
Oh, thank God. I thought we were
gonna be stuck here forever!

592
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,334
Oh, this is great.

My kids!
I can find out about my kids!

594

No. No, no. No, no, no.
Wait a second now.

595
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:20,901
It's too late now. I mean,
I got the bus. It's right here.

596
00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:23,070
What?
You can't take us now.

597
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:26,376
- Now that we know?
- I gotta take you now. It's time.

598
00:41:26,449 --> 00:41:29,680
And there are new babies on the way,
and you guys are my responsibility.

599
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:33,279
It's your fault we're here!
I mean, don't you have a conscience?

600
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:36,749
Everybody gets cancellations.

601
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:39,351
- Not everybody.
- Oh, come on, please!

602
00:41:39,428 --> 00:41:41,055
Think of your guilt.

603
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,792
Just a little while longer.
You're in charge!

604
00:41:43,866 --> 00:41:45,891
- Look at your schedule.
- Think about your guilt.

605
00:41:45,968 --> 00:41:48,300
All right.
Maybe I can hold off...

606
00:41:48,371 --> 00:41:51,204
until each one of you
is actually needed.

607
00:41:51,273 --> 00:41:53,434
Would you? You would.

608
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:58,037
I would, but it's not gonna be long,
I'm warning you.

609
00:41:58,114 --> 00:42:02,778
[Groaning] I can't believe
I'm even doing this. It's crazy.

610
00:42:02,852 --> 00:42:05,116
You know, I'm stickin'
my neck out here,

611
00:42:05,187 --> 00:42:08,384
and when I come back for ya,
you better be ready.

612
00:42:08,457 --> 00:42:12,416
- I got first dibs on him.
- [Julia] Oh, no, you don't!

613
00:42:14,363 --> 00:42:16,695
- Hey, Thomas! Hey, man!
- Thomas!

614
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:20,497
Remember me? It's Milo.
Long time, no see, huh?

615
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:23,037
...the greatest times of my life.
- Long time, still no see.

616
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:26,506
[Arguing] You're not
doing it right. Let me try!

617
00:42:26,575 --> 00:42:31,012
- [Arguing Continues]
- When we met, you had this... spark.

618
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,014
- Sure.
- What is she talking about?

619
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:35,277
- I'm just trying to bring that back.
- Thomas, can you hear us?

620
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:38,081
- I'll meet your parents tomorrow night.
- We're screwed.

621
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:40,918
- The guy's brain dead.
- Are you concentrating like we used to?

622
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,481
- [Arguing Continues]
- Yes, I'm concentrating!

623
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:48,496
- How are we gonna get through to him?
- We don't just scream at him.

624
00:42:48,564 --> 00:42:51,465
Thomas!
Hey, wake up!

625
00:42:51,534 --> 00:42:53,468
- Milo, shhh.
- [Horn Honks]

626
00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:56,130
- Stop it. Sit down!
- You can't just yell at him.

627
00:42:56,205 --> 00:42:58,833
Come on, we have to concentrate
together like we used to.

628
00:42:58,908 --> 00:43:01,775
It's a lot easier
to disappear than to appear.

629
00:43:01,844 --> 00:43:03,937
Sing "Walk Like A Man."

630
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:06,914
- "Walk Like A Man"?
- Good idea.

631
00:43:06,982 --> 00:43:11,419
- Concentrate.
- Okay. Okay, okay, concentrate.

632
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:15,924
Walk like a man
Talk like a man

633
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:20,519
Walk like a man
my son

634
00:43:20,596 --> 00:43:24,555
No woman's worth
crawling on the earth

635
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:27,227
- So walk like a...
- This isn't working.

636
00:43:27,303 --> 00:43:32,172
Oooh

637
00:43:32,241 --> 00:43:36,905
[Yelling Together]
Thomas! Thomas!

638
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:42,349
Thomas, it's me.
It's Milo.

639
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:44,852
It's not, not the radio.
It's me! [Growls]

640
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,115
[Grunting]

641
00:43:51,393 --> 00:43:53,327
Ohhh!

642
00:43:53,395 --> 00:43:56,262
- Contact.
- Hope he doesn't take this badly.

643
00:43:56,332 --> 00:43:59,324

[Indistinct Shouting]

646
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:09,206
- You yelled at him in a moving car!
- I did not! I was just a bit loud.

647
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:12,270
You did. You always
yell everything!

648
00:44:12,348 --> 00:44:15,283
It wasn't even my idea, okay?
It was Penny's. She was the one goin'...

649
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:17,653
As if... Don't try
to blame me, boy.

650
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:21,153
- How long's he gonna be out?
- Do I look like an anesthesiologist?

651
00:44:21,223 --> 00:44:24,215
- We've lost a whole night already!
- Nice.

652
00:44:25,527 --> 00:44:28,963
[Groaning]

653
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:36,137
My car. Uhh,
what happened to my car?

654
00:44:36,204 --> 00:44:39,765
- Thomas?
- Ah, he may be a tad upset.

655
00:44:40,842 --> 00:44:43,310
Thomas?
Sweetie pie,

656
00:44:43,378 --> 00:44:45,312
can you hear us?

657
00:44:47,883 --> 00:44:51,250
We're so sorry, Thomas.
Don't worry, you're gonna be okay.

658
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:54,345
- What have they got me on?
- How are ya?

659
00:44:56,558 --> 00:44:59,857
You just cracked a couple of ribs,
but you're gonna be okay.

660
00:45:06,201 --> 00:45:09,170
- Oh, my God!
- Thomas, it's been a very long time.

661
00:45:09,237 --> 00:45:12,798
We hope you haven't forgotten us.
We really need your help.

662
00:45:12,874 --> 00:45:15,775
[Gasping]

663
00:45:22,184 --> 00:45:25,176
- God, they're back.
- He remembers us!

664
00:45:25,253 --> 00:45:27,721
- [Shouting]
- He remembers us!

665
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:30,155
The hallucinations are back.

666
00:45:30,225 --> 00:45:33,023
I never thought of us
as hallucinations.

667
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:35,495
- Me, neither. Where's he going?
- Wait!

668
00:45:35,564 --> 00:45:37,498
- Thomas?
- Where are you going?

669
00:45:37,566 --> 00:45:40,330
- Bathroom down here?
- We finally figured out
what we're supposed to do.

670
00:45:40,402 --> 00:45:42,563
You're supposed to stay
deep, deep in my subconscious.

671
00:45:42,637 --> 00:45:44,571
Don't run away from us!

672
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:46,698
- [Arguing]
- Don't jabber at him.

673
00:45:46,775 --> 00:45:50,336
[Arguing Continues]

674
00:45:50,412 --> 00:45:52,346
- [Elevator Bell Rings]
- [Indistinct Chattering]

675
00:45:52,414 --> 00:45:55,349
- He's completely ignoring us!
- Pretending he don't know us.

676
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:58,318
- [Muttering]
- Oh, straitjacket city!
Thomas, you're not crazy!

677
00:45:58,386 --> 00:46:00,320
- We're real, in our way.
- Hi, guys.

678
00:46:00,388 --> 00:46:03,551
He's a lucky one.
He gets visitors.

679
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:06,025
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.
- I never get visitors.

680
00:46:17,305 --> 00:46:19,239
[P.A.]
Dr. Singer, please call the operator.

681
00:46:19,307 --> 00:46:21,241
Dr. Singer, please call the operator.

[Sirens Wailing]

683
00:46:28,183 --> 00:46:30,378
Hi.

684
00:46:30,452 --> 00:46:33,387
No, not today.
I'm off medication.

685
00:46:40,462 --> 00:46:43,397
[Sighing, Whispering]
This is gonna sound crazy.

686
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:45,160
Hmmm?

687
00:46:45,233 --> 00:46:48,361
- Do you see any other people with me?
- No.

688
00:46:48,436 --> 00:46:53,373
- [Sighing]
- Nobody... besides those four.

689
00:46:58,046 --> 00:47:00,037
Do you really see them?

690
00:47:00,115 --> 00:47:02,049
Yes.

691
00:47:02,117 --> 00:47:04,745
What do they look like?

692
00:47:06,288 --> 00:47:10,122
There's a gentleman in a brown hat,
a nice-looking black lady,

693
00:47:10,192 --> 00:47:12,183
a blonde lady
with a pink dooley...

694
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,990
and a young buck
in a leather jacket.

695
00:47:15,063 --> 00:47:18,260
I'm available.

696
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:21,302
Oh, and the naked guy
with the nose ring.

697
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:27,937
- Hmmm? No, there's no naked guy...
- I know that!

698
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:30,204
You double-check me;
I double-check you.

699
00:47:30,278 --> 00:47:33,372
[Laughing]

700
00:47:33,448 --> 00:47:37,976
You're lucky. Well,
the ones I see aren't real.

701
00:47:38,053 --> 00:47:42,319
The ones I see come in the daytime,
and sometimes they stay around.

702
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:46,793
Like other planets. The stuff they send!
I mean, people from other places.

703
00:47:46,862 --> 00:47:50,764
- Things from other places.
- You're real.

704
00:47:50,832 --> 00:47:52,925
We've always thought so.

705
00:47:53,001 --> 00:47:54,935
Yeah. I mean,
we can't do much.

706
00:47:55,003 --> 00:47:58,097
- We can't do much.
- No.

707
00:48:00,175 --> 00:48:03,872
[Sighing] See, I thought I had
these serious emotional problems.

708
00:48:03,945 --> 00:48:07,073
- So I convinced myself I'd made you up.
- No, no.

709
00:48:07,148 --> 00:48:09,912
We've been here right beside you
all the time, Thomas.

710
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:13,819
We were supposed to have you help finish
things for us, things we needed to do.

711
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:19,193
This is so amazing.

712
00:48:19,261 --> 00:48:22,162
- [Laughing]
- Isn't it wonderful, Thomas?

713
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,927
The way the pieces all fit,
you and us... I mean...

714
00:48:31,907 --> 00:48:34,899
What on earth makes you think I
would do anything to help you?

715
00:48:34,976 --> 00:48:37,570
Thomas Kenneth Reilly,
you get back here!

716
00:48:37,646 --> 00:48:41,047
I told ya, I told ya!
Don't leave him, he's gonna be mad!

717
00:48:41,116 --> 00:48:43,880
Whoa! Help me. Oh!

718
00:48:43,952 --> 00:48:47,752
[Milo] I'm real sorry. Really.
You have insurance, right?

719
00:48:47,822 --> 00:48:51,883
- [Thomas] You may not ride in the car.
- [Penny] You drive too fast anyway.

720
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,485
Look, I said I was sorry,
and I have a name, you know.

721
00:48:54,562 --> 00:48:58,157
I am not going to run all over
the place trying to fix things
you should have fixed years ago.

722
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:02,192
- Find some other kid
and screw up his life.
- Sorry, we're stuck to you.

723
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:06,104
Where do you get off being so pissed?
We had great times together.

724
00:49:06,174 --> 00:49:08,802
That's true. You did things with us
no other kid ever got to do.

725
00:49:08,877 --> 00:49:10,970
Yeah, right. And then
you left me all alone!

726
00:49:11,046 --> 00:49:13,014
- [Julia] No, we didn't leave you.
- Oh, yeah, well...

727
00:49:13,081 --> 00:49:15,641
you disappeared
when I was seven years old.

728
00:49:15,717 --> 00:49:19,517
- We felt we had to.
- God, I've had no privacy.
You've been with me on my dates.

729
00:49:19,587 --> 00:49:21,521
- Well, we didn't look.
- Yes, we did.

730
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:24,990
I was in therapy for years trying to
figure out what the hell happened to me.

731
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:28,359
- We know. We were there.
- I got more out of it that you did.

732
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:31,160
- You got something out of his therapy?
- That whole "self-esteem" thing.

733
00:49:31,232 --> 00:49:34,133
- I really got in touch...
- Could you not speak for an hour?

734
00:49:34,202 --> 00:49:37,262
- I have a life to lead here.
- Huh, is that what you call it?

735
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:40,740
Do me a favor,
fade out again.

736
00:49:43,745 --> 00:49:45,679
He's not that
happy to see us.

737
00:49:45,814 --> 00:49:51,309
Let's table that till next week and give
Jim a chance to analyze the prospectus.

738
00:49:51,386 --> 00:49:53,320
Now, Thomas. Thomas!

739
00:49:53,388 --> 00:49:56,118
We're gonna be with you forever
unless you help us!

740
00:49:56,191 --> 00:49:58,455
- He's speaking to you!
- Yeah?

741
00:49:58,526 --> 00:50:02,326
Where are we with Stellar Aviation?
Are we still going for liquidation?

742
00:50:02,397 --> 00:50:05,457
Oh, yeah, well, if we want

00:59:47,014 --> 00:59:48,777
Is there a problem,
Officer?

893
00:59:48,849 --> 00:59:51,340
I'd say so.
Doesn't seem to be your day.

894
00:59:51,419 --> 00:59:53,751
You're parked next to
a fire hydrant.

- [Sighs]
- [Laughing]

896
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:58,324
Is that all?

897
00:59:58,392 --> 01:00:03,022
It would be, except for the $2,600
you have in outstanding parking tickets.

898
01:00:03,097 --> 01:00:05,895
Ya see?
You get in trouble without me too.

899
01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:07,935
- Shut up.
- What?

900
01:00:09,603 --> 01:00:12,037
[Harrison] Milo, if it weren't
for you, I would never have...

901
01:00:12,106 --> 01:00:14,199
- gotten to ride on one of these.
- Ya see?

902
01:00:14,275 --> 01:00:17,244
Something good
comes outta everything.

903
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,946
[Man] That's $2,600
for the tickets.

904
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:30,616
With interest and penalty fees
that comes to $3,228.

905
01:00:30,691 --> 01:00:33,182
[Thomas] Ten percent interest?
In this economy?

906
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:36,161
- Just say, "Thank you, Sergeant."
- Thank you, Sergeant.

907
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:38,095
Thank you
for shopping with us.

908
01:00:38,165 --> 01:00:40,759
[Milo]
So far, so good, huh?

909
01:00:40,835 --> 01:00:43,827
[Thomas] Shut up!
I'm out $3,000!

910
01:00:43,904 --> 01:00:47,533
- [Milo] Put it on my tab, Tommy.
- Tab? What tab?

911
01:00:47,608 --> 01:00:50,771
By the way, don't call me Tommy!
You are not my friends!

912
01:00:50,845 --> 01:00:53,643
[Harrison] It's exactly that attitude
that alienates people.

913
01:00:53,714 --> 01:00:56,182
[Thomas]
I forgot about Anne! Her parents!

914
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:59,845
[Harrison] Does it bother anyone else
that this is a one-way street?

[Anne]
He gets so busy.

917
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:08,026
He never knows what
his schedule's gonna be.

918
01:01:08,095 --> 01:01:12,361
- They really rely on him at work.
- Don't worry about it, darling.

919
01:01:12,433 --> 01:01:14,424
- Maybe we'll meet him tomorrow.
- Hmm.

920
01:01:14,502 --> 01:01:16,868
- Bye.
- Yeah, he really wants to meet you.

921
01:01:16,937 --> 01:01:18,871
- Bye-bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

922
01:01:18,939 --> 01:01:21,407
It must have been some kind
of emergency at work.

923
01:01:21,475 --> 01:01:24,410
- Bankruptcies can be unpredictable.
- Relax, honey.

924
01:01:24,478 --> 01:01:28,471
- We'll give him another chance.
Then we'll kill him.

927
01:01:42,163 --> 01:01:44,097
[Milo] How long
is this gonna take?

928
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:47,430
Hey. I happen to care about
this woman. Okay?

929
01:01:47,501 --> 01:01:50,061
Do you mind if I keep
one thing in my life on track?

930
01:01:50,137 --> 01:01:54,904
Anne!
Hi. I'm sorry.

931
01:01:54,975 --> 01:01:57,671
- I'm really sorry. You're angry.
- Don't be sorry.

932
01:01:57,745 --> 01:01:59,679
- I can tell.
- I was angry.

933
01:01:59,747 --> 01:02:02,341
I've been through concern,
worry, annoyance.

934
01:02:02,416 --> 01:02:05,249
- Where are you now?
- I'm fine.

935
01:02:05,319 --> 01:02:08,550
- I had a great time with my parents.
- Uh-huh.

936
01:02:08,622 --> 01:02:11,250
- You could have called.
- I know, I should have called.

937
01:02:11,325 --> 01:02:13,623
- I'm sorry I didn't.
- Let's just face it.

938
01:02:13,694 --> 01:02:16,561
We get along okay,
but things are not going...

939
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:19,565
Wait. What do you mean,
"okay"?

940
01:02:19,633 --> 01:02:22,830
I think there's more here
than just "okay." For me.

941
01:02:22,903 --> 01:02:24,837
Things aren't
going anywhere.

942
01:02:24,905 --> 01:02:27,533
Our relationship is not proceeding
along normal lines.

943
01:02:27,608 --> 01:02:33,240
- What is that supposed to mean?
- When normal people get involved,

944
01:02:33,314 --> 01:02:36,545
they just naturally
take a natural course.

945
01:02:36,617 --> 01:02:39,814
Yeah.
It's like your keys.

946
01:02:39,887 --> 01:02:41,821
My keys.

947
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:44,119
Yes. I don't even have
the keys to your apartment.

948
01:02:44,191 --> 01:02:48,457
- Okay, you want my keys.
- No. No, it's a symbol.

949
01:02:48,529 --> 01:02:51,794
A symbol of a relationship
that is going somewhere.

950
01:02:51,866 --> 01:02:53,891
- Are you listening?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

[Snaps Fingers]
I'm here, I'm here.

We meet,
we are attracted,

953
01:02:59,306 --> 01:03:01,934
we trade keys
and you meet my parents.

954
01:03:02,009 --> 01:03:04,341
I'm aware of the significance
of parent-meeting.

955
01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:09,314
You think that I haven't screwed up
enough relationships to know that?

956
01:03:11,585 --> 01:03:15,453
- I want to meet your parents.
- You do?

957
01:03:15,523 --> 01:03:16,956
Mm-hmm.

958
01:03:17,024 --> 01:03:19,959
They have tickets
to a concert tomorrow night.

959
01:03:20,027 --> 01:03:21,961
- Great.
- No way. We can't.

960
01:03:22,029 --> 01:03:25,430
- Thomas, we need you.
- Mmm, I can't do it tomorrow night.

961
01:03:25,499 --> 01:03:28,400
- Aw, Jesus.
- Anne, please.

really complicated for me.

01:03:33,374 --> 01:03:35,672
Okay? Th-There are
these people in town.

965
01:03:35,743 --> 01:03:39,873
Four very pushy and annoying people,
okay, from this damn bankruptcy.

966
01:03:39,947 --> 01:03:42,211
But I swear to god
I wanna meet your parents.

967
01:03:42,283 --> 01:03:45,446
I'll walk to San Diego
on my knees to meet them.

968
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:48,420
- On your knees?
- Yes.

969
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:50,480
In a new suit, I hope?

970
01:03:50,558 --> 01:03:54,050
Yes, in a new suit. You have no idea.
They're... You know.

971

- I'm still mad.
- You have every right to be.

- Good night. I'll call you.

I like her.
She's strong without being pushy.

975
01:04:11,212 --> 01:04:13,840
I like her too,
but I gotta return these stamps.

976
01:04:13,914 --> 01:04:17,543
- I'm sorry. Let's go. I'll be brief.
- Very nice.

- Okay, you stay in bed.
- God, I hope it's the right guy.

could there be?

Wasn't that great?

- Oooh
- You did a good thing. Smile!

991
01:05:28,122 --> 01:05:31,250
You remember smiling?
Open your lips, show your teeth.

forget about it, girl

Why don't you come back
when we're all done...

1026
01:07:51,766 --> 01:07:54,030
and then you could take us
all at once, you know?

1027
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:56,661
- Save you a lot of mileage.
- Hey, look, pal.

1028

I bought you every second I could,

Hey, buckaroo.

back there. That meant a lot to me.

Who's next? Excuse me.

Excuse me. I know I'm in the minority,
being the only living person here,

01:08:51,425 --> 01:08:54,690
[Harrison Clears Throat]
I'm, uh... I'm not really comfortable.

1042
01:08:54,762 --> 01:08:57,128
[Julia]
Will you stop making excuses?

1043
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:00,031
There are plenty of places
to sing.

1044
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,831
- There's jazz clubs, karaoke.
- [Clearing Throat]

1045
01:09:03,904 --> 01:09:07,169
- Shoot, we could crash a wedding.
- It's 7:30 in the morning.

1046
01:09:07,241 --> 01:09:09,175
The only people singing
are drunk.

1047
01:09:09,243 --> 01:09:12,770
So look, we'll postpone
the singing, all right?

1048
01:09:12,847 --> 01:09:15,213
What about you two?
Penny, Julia?

1049
01:09:15,282 --> 01:09:18,774
John's farm is a couple hours drive.
Let's find Penny's kids.

1050
01:09:18,853 --> 01:09:21,048
- It's okay?
- [Julia] Yeah.

1051
01:09:21,121 --> 01:09:24,682
Okay, let's go for it. Nothing could
be harder than gettin' those stamps.

1052
01:09:24,758 --> 01:09:28,785
Adoption records
from the 1950s are sealed.

1053
01:09:28,863 --> 01:09:31,388
Even the adopted children
themselves...

1054
01:09:31,465 --> 01:09:34,366
need a court order
to open them.

1055
01:09:34,435 --> 01:09:36,960
- If they're lucky.
- A court order.

1056
01:09:37,037 --> 01:09:41,098
- How long does that take?
- Too long.

1057
01:09:41,175 --> 01:09:43,473
Plus a month.

1058
01:09:45,145 --> 01:09:48,512
- [Thomas] Do you live around here?
- Who are you, the man?

1059
01:09:48,582 --> 01:09:52,245
I'm not a cop. I'm trying to
help this lady find her kids.

1060
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,253
What lady?

1061
01:09:54,321 --> 01:09:57,654
She lived here in the '50s.
Her name is...

1062
01:09:57,725 --> 01:10:00,717
[Harrison] This is something.
A bunch of people that don't exist...

1063
01:10:00,794 --> 01:10:02,728
Looking for children
that don't exist.

1064
01:10:02,796 --> 01:10:06,789
- We'll never find her kids.
- Here she comes. Shh!

1065
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:10,701
It's no use. Nobody here will
ever remember me or my children.

1066
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:12,705
Oh, Penny, come on.
We just started.

1067
01:10:12,773 --> 01:10:14,866
We'll try
a couple of other places.

1068
01:10:14,942 --> 01:10:17,001
Was there a store
you went to a lot?

1069
01:10:17,077 --> 01:10:19,671
We could go by, ask there.
Or church.

1070
01:10:19,747 --> 01:10:22,443
- Did you go to church?
- [Cats Meowing]

1071
01:10:27,555 --> 01:10:30,285
Could she
still be alive?

1072
01:10:34,194 --> 01:10:36,924
I know
where the girls are.

1073
01:10:36,997 --> 01:10:38,862
- [Gasps]
- Where?

1074
01:10:38,933 --> 01:10:42,266
They sent me birthday cards
for a while.

1075
01:10:42,336 --> 01:10:44,896
- What sweet children.
- Yes, they are.

1076
01:10:44,972 --> 01:10:48,066
- Especially Diane. She's so thoughtful.
- Where?

1077
01:10:48,142 --> 01:10:51,236
Oh, they sent them
to Sacramento.

1078
01:10:51,312 --> 01:10:54,076
There was
a nice family there.

1079
01:10:55,482 --> 01:10:57,916
Name of, uh...

1080
01:10:57,985 --> 01:11:00,545
Name of...

1081
01:11:00,621 --> 01:11:03,715
Timmer... Timmerson.
That's it, Timmerson.

1082
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:10,887
Little Billy, though,
I lost track of him.

1083
01:11:10,965 --> 01:11:14,401
- They put him in a foster home.
- Oh!

1084
01:11:14,468 --> 01:11:17,335
And then they kept
moving him around.

1085
01:11:17,404 --> 01:11:21,135
Thomas, what are we
gonna do about Billy?

1086
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:24,302
Those girls might know
where he is, though.

1087
01:11:31,418 --> 01:11:33,352
[Horns Honking]

1088
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,820
I don't believe
this damn traffic!

1089
01:11:38,492 --> 01:11:40,858
- W-Where are they all going?
- [Julia] Don't worry, Penny.

1090
01:11:40,928 --> 01:11:43,021
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get there.

1091
01:11:43,097 --> 01:11:47,090
This is silly. We can't drive two hours
to Sacramento. It's not fair to you.

1092
01:11:47,167 --> 01:11:51,160
- It's not fair to Harrison.
- Don't worry. I'm happy to go last.

1093
01:11:51,238 --> 01:11:53,502
In fact, I've always
wanted to see Sacramento.

1094
01:11:53,574 --> 01:11:58,477
I can't believe you're trying to wiggle
out of it. Talk about your last chance.

1095
01:11:58,545 --> 01:12:01,070
W-What do you mean?
John's farm is on the way, isn't it?

1096
01:12:01,148 --> 01:12:04,276
- I've always wanted to see John's farm.
- Wait a minute. Thomas.

1097
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:07,320
Find someplace to pull over.
Come on, pull over.

1098
01:12:07,388 --> 01:12:09,822
Look where
these people are going.

1099
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:12,358
[Harrison] I don't wanna be here.
I don't feel that well.

1100
01:12:12,426 --> 01:12:15,190
I-I think I have
a cold coming on. A flu!

1101
01:12:15,262 --> 01:12:17,992
- [Harrison Clears Throat]
- [Julia] Stop complaining.

1102
01:12:18,065 --> 01:12:20,397
- Nah. They're sold out.
- Oh, sh...

1103
01:12:20,467 --> 01:12:22,435
- That's it, let's go.
- Will you stop it?

1104
01:12:22,503 --> 01:12:26,132
- They're sold out! We can't get in.
- We gotta find another place.

1105
01:12:26,206 --> 01:12:28,572
No, we don't.
No, we don't.

1106
01:12:28,642 --> 01:12:30,576
- You just need a little help.
- No, no, no.

1107
01:12:30,644 --> 01:12:32,612
- Do it!
- Don't look at me like that.

1108
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,614
- Do it!
- Not without my permission.

1109
01:12:34,682 --> 01:12:37,446
- May I please?
- Oh, God. No!

1110
01:12:37,518 --> 01:12:39,509
- Aaaah!
- It's sold out!

1111
01:12:49,797 --> 01:12:53,096
Excuse me. If you're gonna be back here,
you have to have a pass.

1112
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:55,328
A pass?

1113
01:12:55,402 --> 01:12:58,064
A pass!

1114
01:12:58,138 --> 01:13:00,129
I'm gonna pass
some information onto you.

1115
01:13:00,207 --> 01:13:04,075
Youse bozos outside got their trucks
blockin' my car in. My Rolls Royce.

1116
01:13:04,144 --> 01:13:07,113
- Where did you park?
- Are you listenin' to me?

1117
01:13:07,181 --> 01:13:11,743
I said I parked between your trucks!
That's why I can't move.

1118
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:15,516
Don't you give me attitude.
I'm a mother!

1119
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:19,252
No, I mean, I'm a...
I'm a doctor!

1120
01:13:19,326 --> 01:13:22,955
I'm a surgeon. I come down here
as a favor to Mr. King.

1121
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:25,965
His hands are insured for $1,000,000.
The insurance company's not gonna...

1122
01:13:26,033 --> 01:13:28,866
let him walk out on stage until
they had him checked out by me!

1123
01:13:28,936 --> 01:13:33,464
Meanwhile, I got a medical emergency,
but I can't get my damn car out!

1124
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:36,065
- Sir, just calm down.
- Calm down? I am calm.

1125
01:13:36,143 --> 01:13:39,601
You want loud?
I will get loud...

1126
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,671
- if you want me to get loud!
- No, no, no! I, uh...

1127
01:13:41,749 --> 01:13:45,742
You get that manager right now, get his
butt down here and I might calm down.

1128
01:13:45,819 --> 01:13:48,617
- Fine. I'll take you to him.
- I'm not goin' anywhere!

1129
01:13:48,689 --> 01:13:52,056
You bring him to me.
I'm a doctor!

1130
01:13:52,126 --> 01:13:55,562
I'll be right back.

1131
01:13:55,629 --> 01:13:57,597
[Laughing]

1132
01:14:06,705 --> 01:14:09,731
- Not bad.
- Drama class, City College.

1133
01:14:09,808 --> 01:14:13,972
- You got us in.
- Harrison, take it away!

1134
01:14:14,046 --> 01:14:17,277
What? You expect me to get up
in front of all those people?

1135
01:14:17,349 --> 01:14:20,785
- They don't wanna see me.
- They can't see you!

1136
01:14:20,853 --> 01:14:24,619
- Yeah, but I can see them!
- Penny, what exactly is your plan?

1137
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:26,817
My plan was to
get you in here.

1138
01:14:26,892 --> 01:14:29,759
You're in, now you two
get out there and sing!

1139
01:14:29,828 --> 01:14:31,989
The second I walk out there,
they're gonna grab me.

1140
01:14:32,064 --> 01:14:33,998
We should be in Sacramento.

1141
01:14:34,066 --> 01:14:36,626
Thomas, you gotta
make him do it.

1142
01:14:36,702 --> 01:14:39,671
It's very important to him,
whether he admits it or not.

1143
01:14:39,738 --> 01:14:42,002
It's not that important.

1144
01:14:47,413 --> 01:14:50,871
What? No! No!
Ooooh, no!

1145
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:53,612
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
- [Crowd Murmuring]

Please rise
for our national anthem.

01:14:55,955 --> 01:14:59,220
You gotta be kiddin'!

1148
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:02,988
Dear God, Thomas, that's
an incredibly difficult piece!

1149
01:15:03,062 --> 01:15:07,055
[Julia] Perfect! Sing it right,
they're gonna know you're good!

1150
01:15:07,132 --> 01:15:10,533
[Murmuring Continues]

1151
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:13,563
They bought it.

1152
01:15:17,376 --> 01:15:20,174
- You're on.
- Okay, Harrison, I'm all yours.

1153
01:15:20,245 --> 01:15:22,941
- I can't even remember the words.
- Get your butt in there.

1154
01:15:28,554 --> 01:15:32,217
- Come on, man!
- To see B.B. King!

1155
01:15:32,291 --> 01:15:35,226
- Come on, man!
- Let's go!

1156
01:15:35,294 --> 01:15:37,159
I can't.
I can't!

1157
01:15:37,229 --> 01:15:39,629
What are you doing?

1158
01:15:39,698 --> 01:15:43,259
Look at me. I'm not even alive
and I'm perspiring!

1159
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:46,600
You better not do this, Harrison.
Listen! This is it!

1160
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:49,004
Who came up with this
ridiculous concept anyway?

1161
01:15:49,074 --> 01:15:52,373
Resolve your entire life in
one bold stroke? What if I fail?

1162
01:15:52,444 --> 01:15:56,505
And I will, I'll fail.
I'm telling you, I always fail.

1163
01:15:56,582 --> 01:15:59,779
Then my whole life
will be a complete failure.

1164
01:15:59,852 --> 01:16:03,447
No offense, Harrison, but you died
a failure because you never tried.

[Murmuring Continues]

What so proudly we hailed.

1170

What so proudly we hailed

At the twilight's
last gleaming

1172

O'er the ramparts
we watched

Were so gallantly streaming

Brave

1189
01:18:36,909 --> 01:18:39,104
- Bravo!
- Harrison, you did it!

1190
01:18:50,389 --> 01:18:54,018
Bravo!
Bravo, Harrison!

[Band:
"The Thrill Is Gone"]

1192
01:19:09,374 --> 01:19:13,708
Thank you, Thomas.
Thank you for believing in me.

1193
01:19:33,632 --> 01:19:35,862
I'm going on tour,
you know.

1194
01:19:38,003 --> 01:19:39,937
Thrill is gone

1195
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:46,071
The thrill is gone away

1196
01:19:49,181 --> 01:19:54,118
The thrill is gone, baby

1197
01:19:54,186 --> 01:19:59,681
The thrill is gone away

1198
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:03,785
You done me wrong, baby

1199
01:20:03,862 --> 01:20:07,764
You'll be sorry

1200
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:11,200
Don't get him mad.
Be really nice, Thomas.

1201
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:14,205
We have to
get out of here fast.

1202
01:20:16,375 --> 01:20:19,572
Welcome back, Mr. Reilly.
How's show biz?

1203
01:20:19,645 --> 01:20:23,172
I assure you, Sergeant.
I'm not drunk, I'm not on drugs.

1204
01:20:23,248 --> 01:20:27,048
Your blood test shows that.
So what is wrong with you?

1205
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:31,579
- [Phone Ringing]
- It was just... somethin' I had to do?

1206
01:20:31,657 --> 01:20:35,184
I'm going to assume that you've gotten
whatever it is out of your system.

1207
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:38,423
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm gonna release you.

1208
01:20:38,497 --> 01:20:40,632
- Thank you, Sergeant.
It's the last you'll see of me.
- Bail is set at $300.

1209
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,293
- Thank you, Sergeant.
It's the last you'll see of me.
- Bail is set at $300.

1210
01:20:42,367 --> 01:20:46,497
- All right. Can I get something to eat?
- It has to be to go.

1211
01:20:46,571 --> 01:20:48,869
- God!
- Oh, Thomas.

1212
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:53,138
Anne! Hi!
God, what a night! God...

1213
01:20:53,211 --> 01:20:56,009
- How did you know I was here?
- I saw you get arrested.

1214
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:59,516
I was at the concert
with my mother and father.

1215
01:20:59,584 --> 01:21:03,020
- This is really unfair.
- How could you do that to me?

1216
01:21:03,087 --> 01:21:05,351
- Baby...
- Don't call me baby.

1217
01:21:05,423 --> 01:21:08,756
- I have hung in there a long time.
- I know!

1218
01:21:08,826 --> 01:21:11,158
- You lied to me!
You said you had to work.
- I'm sorry.

1219
01:21:11,229 --> 01:21:13,754
You didn't say you had to sing
the national anthem and get arrested!

1220
01:21:13,831 --> 01:21:15,765
But I didn't know
I was gonna do that!

1221
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:18,563
It was just
a spur of the moment thing?

1222
01:21:18,636 --> 01:21:21,230
Yeah! Actually,
actually, it was.

1223
01:21:21,305 --> 01:21:25,139
And how come I don't even know
you can sing like that?

1224
01:21:25,209 --> 01:21:28,337
- You keep that a secret.
- Because, because...

1225
01:21:28,413 --> 01:21:32,816
Because I don't do it
very often. That's why!

1226
01:21:32,884 --> 01:21:37,514
- Was it okay?
- Yeah, it was good. It was really good.

1227
01:21:37,588 --> 01:21:42,355
It's like you're leading a double life:
Banker, lunatic, performance artist.

1228
01:21:42,427 --> 01:21:44,691
Damn it, Anne, are you
gonna let me explain?

1229
01:21:44,762 --> 01:21:47,856
Yes! Explain.
I'm ready.

1230
01:21:52,403 --> 01:21:55,998
- Well, that clears it up for me!
- Anne, come on.

1231
01:21:56,074 --> 01:21:58,406
- Oh, God, I feel like such a jerk.
- Sweetheart.

1232
01:21:58,476 --> 01:22:00,740
You're acting like this is
Days Of Our Lives!

1233
01:22:00,812 --> 01:22:03,212
[Penny] Thomas, do not argue.
Just apologize!

1234
01:22:03,281 --> 01:22:05,442
- Anne, I'm sorry. I apologize.
- Good-bye, Thomas.

1235
01:22:05,516 --> 01:22:09,008
- Yeah, do this to me. Go away. Anne.
- [Car Engine Starting]

1236
01:22:09,087 --> 01:22:11,954
Anne, let's be grown-ups.

1237
01:22:12,023 --> 01:22:14,491
- Anne!
- [Tires Screeching]

1238
01:22:19,564 --> 01:22:21,498
Shit!

1239
01:22:21,566 --> 01:22:23,591
- You let her go.
- I did not let her go.

1240
01:22:23,668 --> 01:22:25,636
- You did.
- You did.

1241
01:22:25,703 --> 01:22:28,570
What am I supposed to do?
Jump in front of the car?

1242
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:30,869
You guys are a lot of help.
Come on.

1243
01:22:32,443 --> 01:22:35,037
- Maybe you should call her.
- We think you should call her.

1244
01:22:35,113 --> 01:22:37,343
- No. Enough!
- You'd feel better.

1245
01:22:37,415 --> 01:22:40,578
Have you forgotten your basic problem?
We've gotta keep moving.

1246
01:22:43,621 --> 01:22:48,058
- [Gasps]
- Oh, boy. Bad sound.

1247
01:22:48,126 --> 01:22:53,655
That's all right. I'll be quick.
I'll just give him the rest of my money.

1248
01:23:02,473 --> 01:23:06,170
Mr. Reilly, is it
something genetic with you?

1249
01:23:15,019 --> 01:23:18,079
Tell me you're not insured,
and you'll be three for three.

1250
01:23:18,156 --> 01:23:22,252
- No, I'm heavily insured, I promise.
- Ouch! Aaah!

1251
01:23:27,698 --> 01:23:30,724
- Penny, I'll tell him to take me.
- No, no.

1252
01:23:30,802 --> 01:23:32,736
I am so sorry.

1253
01:23:32,804 --> 01:23:35,170
- All right, you're sorry.
Can we get on with this?
- [Baby Crying]

1254
01:23:35,239 --> 01:23:38,436
- [Woman] She wants you.
- It's all right, sweetheart.

1255
01:23:39,744 --> 01:23:41,939
- Mr. Hug-a-bug
- I really have to go.

1256
01:23:42,013 --> 01:23:44,538
- Hug-a-bug, Hug-a-bug Bear
- Can I give you
my license and insurance?

1257
01:23:44,615 --> 01:23:49,314
- You can mail 'em to me.
- When you try and find him

1258
01:23:49,387 --> 01:23:52,413
He won't be there

1259
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:57,621
But when you're feeling blue
and a little bit scared

1260
01:23:57,695 --> 01:24:00,095
- Thomas! That's...
- He'll be right beside you

1261
01:24:00,164 --> 01:24:02,962
- That's the song
you used to sing to Thomas.
- Mr. Hug-a-bug Bear

1262
01:24:03,034 --> 01:24:06,003
- I remember.
- I-I made that up!

1263
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:09,233
I used to sing it to my kids before
I put 'em to bed. They loved it.

1264
01:24:09,307 --> 01:24:12,470
- Especially Billy.
- And a little bit scared

1265
01:24:12,543 --> 01:24:16,104
He'll be right beside you

1266
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:18,614
Mr. Hug-a-bug Bear

1267
01:24:18,683 --> 01:24:22,084
- Why? Wait a minute. We had a deal.
- Wait.

1268
01:24:22,153 --> 01:24:24,121
- Come on.
- Give her a minute.

1269
01:24:24,188 --> 01:24:28,921
- What is the matter with him?
- I have only myself to blame.

1270
01:24:28,993 --> 01:24:32,656
I put him
back out on the street.

1271
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:35,426
Ask him.
Ask him if he's Billy!

1272
01:24:35,499 --> 01:24:39,026
Are you... Billy?

1273
01:24:39,103 --> 01:24:43,540
- Is your name Billy? Your first name?
- To my friends.

1274
01:24:43,608 --> 01:24:46,600
Ask him, Thomas.
Ask him if he was adopted.

1275
01:24:46,677 --> 01:24:49,840
Sgt. Barclay, I was wondering if you
ever might happen to, maybe, be adopted.

1276
01:24:49,914 --> 01:24:52,644
If you don't shut up I'm gonna
take you back inside.

1277
01:24:52,717 --> 01:24:57,279
- He was! You can tell, Thomas!
- I know I sound absolutely nuts.

1278
01:24:57,355 --> 01:25:00,620
Was your mother's name
Penny Washington?

1279
01:25:00,691 --> 01:25:04,388
- Billy!
- [Screams]

1280
01:25:04,462 --> 01:25:07,397
This is my...
This is...

1281
01:25:07,465 --> 01:25:08,898
What is this about?

1282
01:25:08,966 --> 01:25:11,867
You've got two older sisters,
Shirley and Diane?

1283
01:25:11,936 --> 01:25:15,633
- Am I right?
- Who are you?

1284
01:25:15,706 --> 01:25:20,837
Is this some sort of sick joke? Did
I lock your brother up or something?

1285
01:25:20,912 --> 01:25:22,846
Do you know where
your sisters are?

1286
01:25:22,914 --> 01:25:25,314
- No.
- I do.

1287
01:25:25,383 --> 01:25:27,317
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

1288
01:25:27,385 --> 01:25:30,479
I've tried to find my sisters
for 20 years. The records
are sealed, even for a cop.

1289
01:25:30,554 --> 01:25:35,218
But remember this lady? This lady
with a million cats? Agnes Miller?

1290
01:25:35,293 --> 01:25:38,421
She still lives in
your old neighborhood.

1291
01:25:38,496 --> 01:25:41,056
- I do remember a lady with cats.
- I know you remember Agnes.

1292
01:25:41,132 --> 01:25:45,398
Call her. Then call a family
named Timmerson in Sacramento.

1293
01:25:45,469 --> 01:25:47,403
That's where
your sisters grew up.

1294
01:25:47,471 --> 01:25:51,407
- How can you possibly know any of this?
- This is my grandbaby!

1295
01:25:51,475 --> 01:25:54,239
My goodness!
Look at that child.

1296
01:25:54,312 --> 01:25:57,179
- Julia, she's so cute.
- She's adorable.

1297
01:25:57,248 --> 01:25:59,443
That's his wife.
Come here.

1298
01:25:59,517 --> 01:26:02,782
- Come. This is... Come here.
- No, I don't wanna get involved.

1299
01:26:02,853 --> 01:26:05,686
- But this is who l...
- No, really. I'm gonna... Come on.

1300
01:26:05,756 --> 01:26:09,487
Your mother and my mother wound up
in the same emergency room.

1301
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,552
My parents told me
that before she died,

1302
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,962
she was talkin' about
her kids...

1303
01:26:15,032 --> 01:26:18,729
and all she wanted was to make sure
that her kids were all right.

1304
01:26:18,803 --> 01:26:21,397
And she sang that song.

1305
01:26:21,472 --> 01:26:24,066
- I guess she was delirious by then.
- Hug-a-bug

1306
01:26:24,141 --> 01:26:26,666
- But my mom taught it to me.
- Hug-a-bug Bear

1307
01:26:26,744 --> 01:26:29,110
So when I heard you singing it,
I just knew.

1308
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:33,139
When you try and find him
he won't be there

1309
01:26:33,217 --> 01:26:35,947
Your mother loved you
very much.

1310
01:26:38,022 --> 01:26:40,149
She would have been
real proud of you.

1311
01:26:40,224 --> 01:26:42,818
- Thomas, I have to do this.
- No.

1312
01:26:48,499 --> 01:26:50,899
I never left you.

1313
01:26:57,508 --> 01:27:00,341
Can you just get off of me?

1314
01:27:00,411 --> 01:27:02,709
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That was... Eee.

1315
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:05,578
It's an emotional time
for us all.

1316
01:27:05,649 --> 01:27:08,174
I'm gonna check this out,
Reilly.

1317
01:27:08,252 --> 01:27:10,584
- And if it isn't true...
- It's true.

1318
01:27:10,654 --> 01:27:14,556
Believe me, it's true.

1319
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:17,321
Come on, sweetheart.

1320
01:27:18,262 --> 01:27:20,492
He's such a cop!
"I'm gonna check this out."

1321
01:27:20,564 --> 01:27:22,794
That was really humiliating.

1322
01:27:26,704 --> 01:27:29,867
- [Sighing]
- [Car Engine Starting, Revving]

1323
01:27:32,376 --> 01:27:35,277
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Finally.

1324
01:27:35,346 --> 01:27:39,544
- Good-bye, darlin'.
- [Julia Laughing]

1325
01:27:39,617 --> 01:27:42,518
You take care.

1326
01:27:42,586 --> 01:27:46,113
I'll remember you,
Julia.

1327
01:27:47,658 --> 01:27:49,455
I'm really gonna miss you.

1328
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:55,394
I'm saying good-bye
to both my sons.

1329
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,707
- Thomas, don't work too hard.
- Okay.

1330
01:28:05,776 --> 01:28:09,047
And it's okay
to be a good guy.

Pay more attention to what
you're eating. Julia, hi to John.

01:28:12,617 --> 01:28:15,745
You stop driving so fast
and call your mother once in a while.

01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:18,618
I love you guys!

01:29:09,574 --> 01:29:12,566
- Think it's okay?
- Uh, yeah. It's good.

1339
01:29:12,643 --> 01:29:15,635
- He'll believe it?
- He's gotta recognize your handwriting.

1340
01:29:15,713 --> 01:29:19,308
Let's go.

1341
01:29:19,383 --> 01:29:22,648
Here's what we'll do. I'll tell him
that after the bus accident,

1342
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:26,087
your stuff got mixed up with
my mom's stuff at the hospital, and...

1343
01:29:26,157 --> 01:29:29,126
I just happened
to find this letter.

1344
01:29:31,629 --> 01:29:35,326
- What?
- He'll buy it. I'll be convincing.

01:29:35,399 --> 01:29:38,232
Aw, shit!

1346
01:29:44,075 --> 01:29:46,441
They're trying to lose me?

1347
01:30:07,365 --> 01:30:09,299
Come on.

1348
01:30:15,373 --> 01:30:19,673
- I do you a favor,
you run from me like rabbits.
- Five minutes, okay?

1349
01:30:19,744 --> 01:30:23,180
- Just give us five minutes!
- No! It's time on the big clock.

1350
01:30:23,247 --> 01:30:25,738
- You take her over my dead body!
- Great. I got the bus right here.

1351
01:30:25,816 --> 01:30:29,274
- I don't care. Come on.
- Don't threaten me.
We're talking about right and wrong!

- Look, you watch it, mortal.
- I can't believe you.

You've got eternity on your hands,
she's asking for five lousy minutes.

1354
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,196
- I find it hard to believe
you can't find five minutes.
- I don't have the authority.

1355
01:30:39,263 --> 01:30:42,960
- Authority for what?
- I can't just change everything.
How do you think I can do that?

1356
01:30:43,034 --> 01:30:47,903
- Be creative. Stall.

Stall Him?

My name's Thomas Reilly and I have
a personal letter for John McBride.

Oh, well... I bought this place
from him seven years ago.

- Do you know where he is now?
- Sorry to have to say it,

1368
01:31:23,808 --> 01:31:29,303
- but he died
soon after he sold it to me.

Are you sure?

1370

Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm sure about that.

1371
01:31:33,918 --> 01:31:37,752
He wasn't well. I guess things
were kinda rough on him.

1372
01:31:37,822 --> 01:31:40,757
This place was kinda
falling apart when I got it.

1373
01:31:40,825 --> 01:31:44,556
Anyway, he moved down to San Leandro
and rented a little apartment.

01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:46,927
Well...
that's where they found him.

- What is this crap?
- What? I beg your pardon?

- It always works.
- No!

It might seem like these things
are going down to the wire,

- Wrong!
- But they always work out.

- What to you mean, that can't be?

1386
01:32:36,947 --> 01:32:40,246
No, you know what?
Or he had to be the wrong guy.

No, it's not the wrong guy!
It's not the wrong guy, you idiot!

It's you.

- What's me?
- You and Anne.

1392
01:33:00,971 --> 01:33:04,429
- That's what I'm supposed to do.
- Meaning?

1393
01:33:04,508 --> 01:33:08,569
I made the same mistake with John
that you're making with Anne.

1394
01:33:08,646 --> 01:33:12,412
I pushed him away, kept him at arms
length and finally, he just left.

01:33:12,483 --> 01:33:15,782
Only you've got the chance
to fix it.

01:33:15,853 --> 01:33:18,754
No. See, Julia,
th-this isn't about me.

01:33:18,823 --> 01:33:21,986
Yes, it is.

1398
01:33:22,059 --> 01:33:25,460
I've watched you
all these years.

1399
01:33:25,529 --> 01:33:28,896
You know how painful it's been
to know who you really are,

1400
01:33:28,966 --> 01:33:33,699
and watch you
keep it hidden from people?

1401
01:33:35,339 --> 01:33:38,240
I don't hide. I protect myself.
I'm cautious.

1402

You're so afraid of being hurt,
you're gonna end up all alone.

It doesn't matter
if she says yes or no.

1404
01:33:48,819 --> 01:33:53,483
Don't let her go without telling her
how you really feel.

01:33:53,557 --> 01:33:56,287
Promise me
you're gonna go to her.

1406
01:33:56,360 --> 01:34:01,320
Promise me you're gonna live the life
that I didn't get to live.

just give you a big hug.

in 50, 60 years.

1417

I was afraid
you weren't gonna come.

1418
01:36:30,881 --> 01:36:33,281
Well,
I wasn't going to...

1419
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:37,684
but... it was hard to ignore
the three phone messages,

1420
01:36:37,755 --> 01:36:41,987
the fax, telegram,
homing pigeon.

1421
01:36:44,361 --> 01:36:46,795
I, uh,
I got you this.

1422
01:37:07,384 --> 01:37:10,683
I've loved people before
and they went away.

1423
01:37:10,754 --> 01:37:15,885
So a long time ago, I made a decision
that I wasn't gonna need anyone anymore.

1424
01:37:15,959 --> 01:37:19,759
I wasted most of my life
that way.

1425
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:24,494
And I know I'm late
and I know I don't deserve it.

1426
01:37:27,004 --> 01:37:30,804
I need you.

1427
01:37:30,874 --> 01:37:34,640
And I love you.

1428
01:37:34,711 --> 01:37:36,702
I love you.

- Gonna get along somehow
- Ooh-wa-ooh-wa, ooh-wa-ooh

1436
01:39:14,945 --> 01:39:16,879
- Soon you'll be cryin'

Oh, yeah
just look who's laughing now

1439
01:39:21,484 --> 01:39:24,942
I'm gonna walk like a man

1440
01:39:25,021 --> 01:39:26,955
Fast as I can

1441
01:39:27,023 --> 01:39:30,982
Walk like a man
from you

1442
01:39:31,061 --> 01:39:34,997
I'll tell the world
forget about it, girl

1443
01:39:35,065 --> 01:39:39,559
And walk like a man
from you

1444
01:39:39,636 --> 01:39:41,763
Oooh

1445
01:39:48,745 --> 01:39:51,680
Mmmm

1446
01:39:55,785 --> 01:40:00,552
The years
they come and go

1447
01:40:02,959 --> 01:40:07,623
And change will come
I know

1448
01:40:09,366 --> 01:40:12,699
You won't

1449
01:40:12,769 --> 01:40:16,466
Be there

1450
01:40:16,539 --> 01:40:20,031
My heart

1451
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:24,547
And soul

1452
01:40:24,614 --> 01:40:29,313
Different time and place

1453
01:40:31,621 --> 01:40:37,287
But time cannot erase

1454
01:40:38,662 --> 01:40:43,656
The smile
that lights your face

1455
01:40:45,368 --> 01:40:49,031
As you gaze in mine

1456
01:40:49,105 --> 01:40:52,370
It will always shine

1457
01:40:52,442 --> 01:40:56,538
And you

1458
01:40:56,613 --> 01:41:00,208
Will always be

1459
01:41:00,283 --> 01:41:03,616
An angel making sure I care

1460
01:41:03,687 --> 01:41:07,248
A memory that's always there

1461
01:41:07,324 --> 01:41:14,025
You dreams won't die
They live inside of me

1462
01:41:14,097 --> 01:41:18,056
You know you'll always be

1463
01:41:18,134 --> 01:41:24,664
My heart and soul

1464
01:41:24,741 --> 01:41:28,074
Oooh

1465
01:41:29,446 --> 01:41:35,646
Oooh

1466
01:41:35,719 --> 01:41:41,282
If the years
can make you wise

1467
01:41:42,826 --> 01:41:48,196
Now I finally realize

1468
01:41:49,933 --> 01:41:55,235
That if I just close my eyes

1469
01:41:57,006 --> 01:42:00,669
I can see you there

1470
01:42:00,744 --> 01:42:03,838
And the love we share

1471
01:42:03,913 --> 01:42:08,043
And you

1472
01:42:08,118 --> 01:42:11,747
Will always be

1473
01:42:11,821 --> 01:42:15,188
A dream so real
it cannot die

1474
01:42:15,258 --> 01:42:18,853
The trust and faith
that lets me fly

1475
01:42:18,928 --> 01:42:25,697
A love so strong
it just belongs to me

1476
01:42:25,769 --> 01:42:29,569
You know you'll always be

1477
01:42:29,639 --> 01:42:36,670
My heart and soul

1478
01:42:36,746 --> 01:42:44,016
Oooh

1479
01:42:44,087 --> 01:42:47,614
An angel making sure I care

1480
01:42:47,690 --> 01:42:51,217
A memory that's always there

1481
01:42:51,294 --> 01:42:55,697
You'll always be my heart

1482
01:42:55,765 --> 01:43:00,566
And soul

1483
