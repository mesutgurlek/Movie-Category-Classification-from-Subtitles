1
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,154
Snuggle in, sweetie! It's cold out there.

2
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,037
Why is it snowing, Grandma?
Where does it come from?

3
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,909
Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.

4
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,912
- I wanna hear.
- Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep.

5
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,751
I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please.

6
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,831
Well, all right.

7
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,271
Let's see...

8
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,429
I guess it would have to start with... scissors!

9
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,511
Scissors?

10
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,115
Well, there are all kinds of scissors.

11
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,750
And once there was even a man
who had scissors for hands.

12
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,717
- A man?
- Yes.

13
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,395
- Hands scissors?
- No, scissor hands.

14
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,991
You know the mansion
on top of the mountain?

15
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,112
It's haunted.

16
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,191
Well...

17
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,791
A long time ago...

18
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,800
...an inventor lived in that mansion.

19
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,919
He made many things, I suppose.

20
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,711
<i>He also created a man.</i>

21
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,071
<i>He gave him insides,
a heart, a brain, everything.</i>

22
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,191
<i>Well, almost everything.</i>

23
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,229
<i>You see, the inventor was very old.</i>

24
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,676
<i>He died before he got to finish
the man he invented.</i>

25
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,753
<i>So the man was left by himself...</i>

26
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,756
<i>... incomplete and all alone.</i>

27
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,311
<i>(girl) He didn't have a name?</i>

28
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,991
<i>Of course he had a name.</i>

29
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,751
<i>His name was Edward.</i>

30

32
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,477
- Weren't you just here?
- No, not since last season!

33
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,755
Today I've come to show you our exquisite
new line of softer colours, in shadows...

34
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,512
...blushes and lipstick.

35
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,149
Everything you need to accent and highlight
your changing look.

36
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,437
<i>My changing look... That's good! (laughs)</i>

37
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,876
I also have a complete selection
of your old favourites...

38
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,192
...those tried and true products we've all
come to depend on year in and year out.

39
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,748
Come on, Peg,
I never buy anything from you.

40
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,876
I know. Bye, Helen.

41
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,911
Um, you didn't have to call me, ma'am.
You could have taken care of this by yourself.

42
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,991
I could? I don't think so.

43
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,753
It's easy. Your food trap's clogged, that's all.

44
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,195
See this bolt here? You just unscrew this...

45
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,838
Mm-hm...

46
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,592
And out she pops.

47
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,114
On TV they say you repairmen
are a lonely bunch.

48
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,751
Housewives get lonely too, though you may
not realise it since they haven't made an ad.

49
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,517
And then you just take this and put it back in
here nice and easy. Be careful not to force it.

50
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,750
And then you just screw this back on.

51
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,673
<i>- (doorbell)
- Oh, now who could that be?</i>

52
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,431
Will you excuse me for a moment?

53
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,079
Now, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
This is fascinatin'!

54
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,469
I wouldn't wanna miss a moment of it!

55
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,032
- Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling!
- Why, Peg...

56
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,192
Have you gone blind?
Can't you see that vehicle in my drive?

57
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,799
Oh. Yes.

58
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,269
Don't you realise that means I'm busy?

59
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,394
OK, now we should decide on lipsticks.

60
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,951
OK, dear, did you like the Winsome Wahini,
which looked charming on you...

61
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,349
...or the Bahimini Bliss?

62
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,431
- I like 'em both.
- Well, great!

63
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,517
You don't actually think
I have any money, do you?

Peg drove by. She had somebody with her.

- Did you get a good look at him?
- No, I didn't.

Do you know what bowling is?

141
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,632
Bowling?

142
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,518
No. Well... Here they are
down at the lake, fishing.

00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,358
...but she'll be back in a few days.
You can meet then.

Come along.
I'll show you the rest of the house.

152

00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,558
- It hangs on the dashboard.
- I've never seen that.

623
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,551
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi, Edward.

624
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,632
Sorry, dear, we had to go ahead without you.
There you go.

625
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,314
So, Edward, did you have a productive day?

626
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,789
Mrs Monroe showed me
where the salon will be.

627
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:09,316
- You could have a cosmetics counter.
- Wouldn't that be great?

628
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,314
Great.

629
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,631
Then she showed me the back room
where she took all her clothes off.

630
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,229
Edward, I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
I'm as pleased as punch.

631
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,709
This venture's gonna teach you volumes.

632
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,633
There's nothin' like
running your own business.

633
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,472
I've never done it myself...

634
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,519
...but I gather it's the greatest satisfaction
a working man can have.

635
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,152
So I guess the bank's
gonna be your next step, huh?

636
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,798
The bank?

637
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,190
Yeah. Take out a loan, get yourself started.

638
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,869
Nothin' to worry about. With your talent
and reputation, it's gonna be a snap.

639
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,595
Yeah.

640
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,638
No credit...

641
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,029
...no record ofjobs you've held...

642
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,872
...no savings...

643
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,951
...no personal investments...

644
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,956
No social security number -
you may as well not even exist...

645
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,033
- There is no collateral.
- No, we already have a second on the house.

646
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,270
But don't the testimonials count?

647
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,069
Did you see here the mayor's wife
can't wait to become a client?

648
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,037
We simply can't do it.

649
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,069
Now, get yourself a social security card,
establish credit and buy yourself a car.

650
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,948
You have a decided advantage.
You can get a handicapped placard...

651
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,792
...and park anywhere you like.

652
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,518
I can't believe it. It's just an outrage.

653
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:34,230
But don't you worry. This isn't the end of it.
We'll get your money somehow.

654
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:40,590
<i>- (Kim) But that's breaking and entering.
- (Jim) My parents have insurance up the rear.</i>

655
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:44,070
What'll it cost them?
A little hassle, that's about it.

656
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,197
- We can't.
- This guy'll give us cash for the stuff.

657
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,793
I don't want to.

658
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,192
You don't want us to have our own van where
we can be alone? And a mattress in the back?

659
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,759
<i>Why can't you do it?</i>

660
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,832
Because the room's locked
and we need Edward to get us in.

661
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,115
Can't you take the key when he's sleeping?

662
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,192
The only thing he hangs on to tighter
is his dick.

663
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,551
- Razor Blades'll do anything for you.
- That's not true.

664
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,234
- Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?
- That's not fair.

665
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:12,756
- So what? There isn't any other way.
- There's gotta be.

666
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,797
Look, I've racked my brain.

667
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,996
Don't you want us to have our own van?

668
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,196
Well... yeah.

669
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,438
<i>(Kim) Jim, the lights are on!</i>

670
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:28,195
Those go on automatically.
They're gone for the weekend, I told you.

671
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,952
<i>(Denny) In case of burglars.</i>

672
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,349
<i>- (Kim) You turned off the alarm?
- Yes. Let's go.</i>

673
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,237
<i>(Kim) I hate this.</i>

674
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,596
<i>(girl) Are you sure he doesn't know
this is Jim's house?</i>

675
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,669
- This person stole from you?
- Shh! Keep it down!

676
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,716
I told you he stole it, OK? Let's go!

677
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,519
Tell his parents
and they'll make him give it back.

678
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,912
Listen, I already tried that.
Now, you told Kim you'd do this. Let's go.

679
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,718
Come on!

680
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,071
Come on!

681
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,311
OK, come on. Come on.

682
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,069
Come on, come on, come on! Now! Come on!

683
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,111
<i>(alarm sounds)</i>

684
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,988
The bastard had it wired separately.
Come on!

685
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,230
No, Jim, we can'tjust leave him here!

686
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,718
- Come on.
- I'm not gonna do this!

687
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,791
- Just come on, Kim.
- Stop!

688
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,351
Put me down!

689
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,758
Put me down!

690
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,831
<i>(alarm continues)</i>

01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:19,151
<i>We're in the process of deactivating

694
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,151
<i>(alarm stops)</i>

695
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,438
- Denny, turn around!
- No way.

696
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,512
Jim, they can't arrest you
for setting off your own alarm.

697
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,352
We'll tell 'em we freaked and ran.

698
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,635
- I'm not going back there, OK?
- We have to!

699
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,472
No. My father would prosecute.

700
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,630
- His own son?
- Especially his own son.

701
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,790
And if Edward tells I'll kill him!

702
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,431
- Denny, turn around!
- No!

703
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,953
You have to!

704
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,669
<i>We want your hands high in the air
where we can see them!</i>

705
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,711
<i>Put your hands up!</i>

706
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,108
He's holding something. Looks like knives.

707
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,918
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

708
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,668
<i>I repeat- drop your weapons!</i>

709
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,356
<i>I'm gonna ask you one more time.
This is your last warning. Drop your weapons.</i>

710
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:27,275
<i>If you fail to do so we'll have to open fire.
Don't make us do that, buddy.</i>

711
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,318
<i>Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!</i>

712
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,628
<i>Now!</i>

713
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,551
Looks like we got a psycho.

714
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,596
<i>- Prepare to fire!
- (Marge) No! No!</i>

715
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,639
- Stand back, ladies!
- Those aren't weapons, those are his hands!

716
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,711
Please. We know him.

717
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,878
All right. Cuff him.

718
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,189
- But we can see him now?
- We're going to have to hold him overnight.

719
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,717
- He has to stay in prison all night?
- You can pick him up in the morning.

720
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,791
Oh, Edward!

721
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,036
Hello, Edward.

722
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,554
Oh, Edward, dear. I blame myself.

723
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,837
<i>(Bill) What in God's name
was going through your mind, son?</i>

724
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,357
<i>(Peg) Why didn't I set a better example?
You saw how I envied Jim's parents.</i>

725
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,556
What were you gonna do with that stuff?

726
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,871
I blithely say "We'll get money
for the salon somehow"...

727
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,791
...but I never meant stealing.

728
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:26,078
Dear, stealing's not the way to get it.
Stealing's not the way to get anything.

729
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,755
<i>(Bill) Uh-uh. Except trouble.
And you're in a serious heap of that.</i>

730
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,354
Oh, Edward. Why ever did you do this?

731
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,876
- Damn those TV programmes!
- Damn them all to hell!

732
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,030
Or did somebody put you up to this?

733
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,915
Will he be OK, doc?

734
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,835
The years spent in isolation have not given
him the tools to judge right from wrong.

735
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,117
He's had no context.
He's been completely without guidance.

736
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,988
Furthermore his work, the garden sculptures,
hairstyles and so forth...

737
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,799
...indicate that he's a highly imaginative...

738
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,199
...character.

739
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,273
His awareness of what we call reality
is radically underdeveloped.

740
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,193
But will he be all right out there?

741
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,591
Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.

742
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,793
Listen, it could keep me up all night worrying
about ya. You watch yourself, you hear?

743
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,439
I happened to be up,
so I heard all this noise...

744
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,229
All along I felt in my gut
there was somethin' wrong with him.

745
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,956
- It could have been my house.
- Or any of our houses, but...

746
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:50,033
I warned you, didn't I?
I saw the sign of Satan on him.

747
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:54,750
You didn't heed my warning, but now
you will. Because now you can see it too.

748
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,638
Edward, you stay here.

749
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,757
<i>- (man) What do you say in your defence?
- (Edward) Nothing.</i>

750
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:18,037
<i>- He doesn't want to talk.
- (woman) You have to say something.</i>

751
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,476
- He can't talk right now.
- No comments? No remarks?

752
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,757
<i>(man) So, were you set up?
What was going through your mind?</i>

753
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,479
Huh? What do you have to say for yourself?

754
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,757
<i>- (woman) One comment. One comment.
- (Peg) Later.</i>

755
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,830
Goodness, Lois, it looks like
I'll see you at our Christmas party...

756
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,115
...before I get you over for your haircut!

757
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,433
Well, of course we're gonna have it this year.
We have it every year. Why wouldn't we?

758
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,953
Well!

759
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,713
You may think that, but you're wrong.

760
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,191
You're here.

761
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,951
They didn't hurt you, did they?

762
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,192
Were you scared?

763
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:11,071
I tried to make Jim go back,
but you can't make Jim do anything.

764
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,629
Thank you for not telling them that we...

765
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,918
You're welcome.

766
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,390
It must have been awful
when they told you whose house it was.

767
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,191
I knew it was Jim's house.

768
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,831
You... you did?

769
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,192
Yes.

770
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,031
Well, then why'd you do it?

that's what you should do, but it's not.

It's a much nicer thing to do.

learn right from wrong, living in this family!

811
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,158
Well, did you hear
what he did to Peg's curtains?

812
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,994
It's unbelievable they're having
their party anyway. Are you going?

He practically raped Joyce,
threatening her with those knives.

821
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,276
I said I hoped we could make it.

822
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,191
I lied too.

823
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,158
Edward? Do you want to
give me that new haircut?

824
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,915
- Again?
- Yeah, sure!

825
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,198

- Hi.

- Kevin, want to play scissors, paper, stone?
- No.

828
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,637
- Why?
- It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.

829
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,757
- People's feelings, please. A few manners!
- I'll be outside.

01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,199
Just do it!

925
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,631
<i>Jesus. Maybe she was right about you.</i>

926
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:57,711
- Just drive!
- Relax!

927
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,713
<i>- (Max) See you tomorrow. Call me.
- All right.</i>

928
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,395
Have they caught him yet?

929
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,237
- Who?
- Him! That... that cripple.

930
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,597
Let me know when they do.

931
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,591
Let us all know, OK?

932
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,591
Like a good boy.

933
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,719
Kevin.

934
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,115
- Urgh!
- Are you OK?

935
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,633
- It's OK.
- Ow!

936
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,671
<i>(Kevin) Ow! Ow!</i>

937
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,390
- Edward, stop!
- I'm your friend.

938
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,233
<i>(Helen) Help us!</i>

939
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:26,399
What are you doing? Get away from him!

940
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,994
<i>(hysterical shouting)</i>

941
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,594
Hey...

942
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,477
- Let go of me!
- What?

943
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,278
Kevin!

944
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,071
<i>(shouting)</i>

945
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:47,678
- Get away!
- Edward, come home. Come home!

946
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,151
<i>(screaming)</i>

947
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,758
<i>(siren)</i>

948
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,109
Run.

949
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,996
Kevin's all right!
It was just the tiniest scratch!

950
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:53,198
He's gone. Let's not bother him, all right?
Let's just leave him alone.

951
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,598
<i>(gunshots)</i>

952
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,351
Go on, run.

953
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,359
- What happened? Is he dead?
- Did you get him?

954
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,992
It's all over. Go on home.
There's nothing more to see.

955
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:18,517
What happened out there?
I want to know! I want some answers!

956
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,591
It is all over.

957
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,478
<i>(Helen) Where is he? Where is he?</i>

958
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,877
<i>(woman) Get back here!
I wanna ask you something!</i>

959
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:36,030
Look at that! I don't believe this.

960
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,191
They don't have him. I'm goin'.

961
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,271
No! That's not a good idea.

962
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,031
They're coming?

963
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,391
Did I hurt Kevin?

964
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,870
No, he's OK. Mostly he was just scared.

965
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,360
Edward, I was so afraid.

966
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:01,110
I thought you were dead.

967
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:09,999
I didn't.

968
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:19,873
No!

969
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,672
No!

970
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,671
Jim, stop!

971
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,159
No!

972
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:49,909
No!

973
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:56,113
Stop it. Or I'll kill you myself.

974
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,592
Aagh!

975
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,439
Hey! I said stay away from her!

976
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,276
<i>(shouting in distance)</i>

977
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,872
<i>(whispers) Goodbye.</i>

978
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:21,472
<i>(whispers) I love you.</i>

979
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,991
<i>(screaming)</i>

980
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,517
<i>(man) l-ls he in there?</i>

981
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,272
He's dead.

982
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,991
The roof caved in on him.

983
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,991
They killed each other.

984
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,308
You can see for yourselves.

985
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,834
See?

986
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,591
<i>(Helen) I'm goin' home.</i>

987
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,071
Joyce...

988
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,551
She never saw him again.

989
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:14,316
Not after that night.

990
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,111
How do you know?

991
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,591
Because I was there.

992
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:29,835
You could have gone up there.
You still could go.

993
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,395
No, sweetheart.

994
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,471
I'm an old woman now.

995
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,073
I would rather him remember me
the way I was.

996
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:14,111
How do you know he's still alive?

997
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,830
I... don't know.

998
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:21,229
Not for sure, but...

999
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,995
I believe he is.

1000
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,999
<i>You see, before he came down here...</i>

1001
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,871
<i>... it never snowed.</i>

1002
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,355
And afterwards...

1003
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:48,431
...it did.

1004
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:54,310
If he weren't up there now,
I don't think it would be snowing.

1005
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,110
Sometimes you can still catch me
dancing in it.
