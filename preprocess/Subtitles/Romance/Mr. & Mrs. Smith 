1
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,320
Закуска, Господин Смит

2
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:43,871
Какво правите?

3
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:46,006
Тя е под завивките,
той играе карти.

4
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,051
- Ти погледна през ключалката?
- Не можеш да видиш нищо и без това.

5
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:50,483
Аз просто слушах.

6
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:56,848
Къщата на Смит.

7
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,951
Не, Г-н Къстър, те още не са излезли.

8
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:02,122
Те отвориха вратата за закуската,
но не освободиха приборите.

9
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:03,529
Започват да ми свършват приборите.

10
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,358
Стоят там вече три дни.

11
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,428
Колко наи-дълго
they've kept this thing up?

12
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:11,367
Осем?

13
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:14,443
Сами дойде ли вече?

14
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,803
Тъкмо влиза. Г-н Къстър е.

15
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,305
Да, Г-н Къстър.

16
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:22,583
Сега слушай,Сами
тези документи трябва да бъдат подписани...

17
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:25,644
така че не напускай,
докато не са подписани, ясно ли е?

18
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:27,314
Завися от теб, Сами.

19
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:30,415
Ще се върна с подписани документи, Г-н Къстър.

20
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,857
Заведи ме до стаята.

21
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,839
Г-н Смит,аз съм Сами 
от офиса.

22
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,770
Г-н Къстър казва,че трябва да подпишете това.

23
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:51,075
Не можем да продължаваме да отлагаме делото.

24
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,544
Пъхни го под вратата.

25
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,477
Мушкам го под вратата, Г-н Смит.

26
00:03:57,754 --> 00:03:58,778
Видя ли?

27
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,620
- Подписахте го с молив.
- Свърши ми мастилото.

28
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:07,595
- Не може с молив.
- Повторете го с химикалка.

29
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:11,098
- Но това е подправяне.
- Не, не е .

30
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,865
Както и да е,никои няма да разбере.

31
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,997
Но аз завършвам адвокатурата си следващия юни.
Може да си навлека проблеми.

32
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:21,066
Дай ми химикалка.

33
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:30,281
Благодаря Ви,Г-н Смит.

34
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,460
Помисли си,че бих си тръгнал huh?

35
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:22,870
Какво би направил
ако изляза през тази врата?

36
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:25,137
Да ме напуснеш?

37
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,137
Завинаги?

38
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:30,972
Докато сме живи,
никога не трябва да променяме това правило.

39
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:32,105
Точно така.

40
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:35,014
Ако всяка женена двоика го имаше
никога нямаше да има разводи.

41
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,075
Те би трябвало да го сложат
в сватбената церемония.

42
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:39,951
Не мога да напусна спалнята
след кавга освен,ако не си се сдобрила.

43
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:41,684
Евентуално ще трябва ти да се сдобриш.

44
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,421
Повечето мъже не могат да си позволят да стоят извън
офиса три дни след crack.

45
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:47,622
Помниш ли осем дневното заседание?

46
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,298
- И шестото?
- Имаше две шестици.

47
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:51,355
Две?

48
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,265
Една коледна седмица...

49
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:56,062
и другата
уикенда на игрите в Йейл.

50
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:59,973
Това наистина беше пет и половина.
Започнахме на обед.

51
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:03,241
Какво ще кажеш за малко закуска мамо?

52
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:04,774
Няма ли да сме смели?

53
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,477
Уважавай всеки един като личност,
това е нашият голям номер.

54
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:12,252
Мъж и жена са добре...

55
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:15,848
но човек към човек,
това е важно също и в брака.

56
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:17,483
Направи така.

57
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:23,456
Мисля,4е бихме били приятели
ако бяхме мъже или жени не мислиш ли?

58
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:31,401
Уважавай всеки като индивид,
това е което се брои.

59
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,705
Винаги да казваш истината,
независимо от последствията.

60
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:36,870
Мисля,че ако си бяхме казали поне една лъжа един на друг...

61
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:39,380
Трябваше да признаем,4е сме се провалили
нали?

62
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,976
Какво би ни останало?
Брак като на другите хора.

63
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:47,686
Съмнение,недоверие. Да продължаваме да сме един с друг
защото това е най-лесният начин.

64
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:54,385
Твоят бръснар те бръсне твърде близко,
Бих искала да поговориш с него.

65
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:00,531
Вината беше изцяло моя.

66
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:04,065
- Не, скъпи, беше моя.
- Вината беше моя, скъпа.

67
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:06,202
Моя, скъпа.

68
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:10,075
Не биваше да съм толкова ревнива,
трябва6е да lay off твоето семейство.

69
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:13,115
Съпругата трябва да държи на себе си
да задоволява съпруга си.

70
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,941
Това е едно от правилата,което мисля да направя.

71
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,286
Друго?

72
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:22,255
- Какъв ден е днес?
- Скъпа,по-добре да тръгвам.

73
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:25,852
Не,скъпи. Не още.
Помниш ли правило номер седем?

74
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:29,959
Мислех,че се отказахме от това.
То винаги ни навлича проблеми.

75
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,795
Ако се откажем от едно,то това означава да...

76
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,836
толкова много
от нашето прекрасно съжителство.

77
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:36,133
Затова че се отказваме.
Искаш да усетя това?

78
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:38,799
Но въпросите,които задаваш всеки месец.

79
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:42,241
За пътуването,което направих до Париж
годината,когато завурших колежа.

80
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:43,801
Бях само на 21.

81
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,743
Тогава ти простих.

82
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:50,812
Стреляй.

83
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:57,056
Ако можеше да започнеш всичко отначало,
щеше ли да се омъжиш за мен?

84
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,863
Честно? Не.

85
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:05,601
Не че искам да съм женен
за някои друг.

86
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:09,468
Но когато мъж се жени, тои губи
малко свобода и независимост.

87
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,475
Ако можех да започна всичко отначало,
мисля,4е 6тях да остана сам.

88
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,440
Искаше да ти отговоря откровено
защото се уважаваме един друг.

89
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:19,708
Ние сме честни един с друг.

90
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:23,512
- Чувствата ти не са наранени, нали?
- Не. Всичко е перфектно добре.

91
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:27,254
Достатучно за това.
Забурках се в неприятности.

92
00:08:27,323 --> 00:08:29,450
Не съм ядосана поне.

93
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,853
Не,адосана си. Ти не разбираш.

94
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,421
Просто отговарях на хипотетичен въпрос
какво бих направил...

95
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,899
ако можех да започна наново.

96
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:42,663
Ако искаш свободата си,
аз не искам да съм от вида съпруги...

97
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:45,832
която се притиска до съпруга си
когато не е желана.

98
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:49,702
Скъпа,аз искам да съм женен за теб.
Обичам те. Обожавам те.

99
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,406
Свикнал съм с теб.

100
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:54,238
Как така винаги стигаме до тези неща?

101
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:57,013
Ако да си до мен е само
защото си свикнал...

102
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,053
Разбрала си всичко погрешно.

103
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,613
Не знам какво бих правил без теб.
Ти си моето малко момиче

104
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,397
Сега,недей да плачеш.

105
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:14,868
Прости ми? Кажи,че ми прощаваш.

106
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:21,873
А сега мога ли да отида на работа?

107
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:35,087
Ще се прибера рано.

108
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,689
- И имам впредвид рано.
- Не се пресилваи скъпи.

109
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:50,903
- Добро утро.
- Добро утро Г-н Смит.

110
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:03,682
- Добро утро Дейвид.
- Добро утро Джеф.

111
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,852
Знаеш как си.
Трябва да я глезиш.

112
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:12,951
Не ми се извинявай.
Завиждам ти от дъното на сърцето си.

113
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,521
- Иска ми се да бях в твоите обувки.
- Дам,тя е прекрасно дете.

114
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,897
Истинско бедствие нали?

115
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:22,798
- Какво има?
- Г-н Дийвър чака да говори с вас.

116
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,602
Не ми казва за какво става въпрос.
Казва,че е поверително.

117
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:26,972
Прати го.

118
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,738
Ще те оставя на нещастието ти.

119
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:31,041
Какво ще кажеш за обяд в клуба,
ако успееш?

120
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:32,944
Ще се опитам да се справя,Джеф.

121
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:37,016
Г-н Дийвър.

122
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,920
Как сте?

123
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,664
Няма ли да седнете?

124
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,944
Какво мога да направя за вас?

125
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,750
Не сте ли бил женен в Бийчъм
през март 1937?

126
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,884
Да бях.

127
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:15,918
Знаете,че Бийчъм е от другата 
страна на реката
...

128
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:18,960
и винаги е било обединено
в Брендър...

129
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:22,327
но нали разбиратече това е в Айдахо.

130
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,963
И...

131
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:27,959
Ще ме последвате нали?

132
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,264
Да.

133
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:32,038
Ние в Бийчъм намерихме...

134
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,339
че не е трябвало да се обединяваме 
с Брендър Коунти...

135
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:38,911
защото от другата страна на
реката Бас...

136
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:40,573
ние принадлежим на Невада.

137
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,577
Добре тогава.

138
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:44,917
Ние просто открихме...

139
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:49,447
че всеки който се е оженил
от 1936 досега...

140
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:52,661
със свидетелство от Айдахо в Невада...

141
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:55,159
е,не е легално.

142
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:57,290
Какво имате впредвид?

143
00:11:57,366 --> 00:12:00,927
Не искам да сте уплашен,
или разтроен, или нещо друго.

144
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:03,965
Но е станала някаква грешка.

145
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:06,333
Не сте легално женен.

146
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,439
Какво?

147
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:12,072
Вие наистина сте женен и всичко останало.

148
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:14,815
но има една техническа подробност.

149
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,851
наистина е добре разбирате ли...

150
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:21,184
обществен закон и всичко.

151
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,684
но го измислихме...

152
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:27,058
в случай на смърт, завещание раждане...

153
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:28,954
нали разбирате деца...

154
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:33,832
ние мислим,че ще е по-добре
ако всеки по някакъв начин се ожени отново...

155
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,430
просто за да бъдете на сигурната страна.

156
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,670
И Chamber of Commerce...

157
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:41,801
ме изпращат да казвам на всички наоколо


158
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,705
И ви връщаме вашите 2 долара.

159
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,408
Можете да го използвате да си извадите ново свидетелство.

160
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:53,855
Смешно е нали?

161
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,149
Да.

162
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:58,621
Заминавам се с това,вече две седмици,
само в Ню Йорк.

163
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:01,058
Много двойки дойдоха в Ню Йорк.

164
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,223
Беше ми много трудно да ги открия.

165
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:09,564
Мисля да тръгвам Г-н Смит.

166
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:13,404
Надявам се да не държите това
срещу Бийчъм.

167
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:16,445
- Наистина не беше наша вината.
- Не,изобщо.

168
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:21,174
Това съпругата ви ли е?

169
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:23,142
Да не е Ани Краусхаймър?

170
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:25,913
Да,тя живее отсреща на Бийчъм.

171
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,114
Ето как се случи
да се оженим там.

172
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,249
- Познавахте ли я?
- Дали съм я познавал?

173
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:35,286
Тя и моята по-малка сестра ходеха да тичат заедно
из къщата постоянно.

174
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,831
Помня го сякаш беше вчера.

175
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,636
Не мога да го преживея.
Мисля,че се е променила малко?

176
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:45,797
Променила се е малко.

177
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:50,000
Веднъж тя преследваше един хващач на кучета.
половин миля с бейзболна бухалка.

178
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:53,114
Не се е променила
колкото си мислите.

179
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,185
Разбира се тя е една добре изглеждаща жена.
Предайте и че съм питал за нея,нали?

180
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,620
- Старият Хари Дийвър. Тя ще ме запомни.
- Нещо повече аз ще я помня. Благодаря ви.

181
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:02,623
Довиждане Г-н Смит.

182
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,424
- Можете да намерите изхода нали?
- Да благодаря.

183
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,602
<i>- Да госшподин Смит?</i>
- Набери ми вкъщи.

184
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,735
Здравей скъпа. Кажи скъпи.

185
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:57,006
Къде мислиш,че ще те заведа на вечеря
довечера?

186
00:14:58,781 --> 00:14:59,839
Незнам.

187
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:05,611
Мама Луси.

188
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,482
Скъпа!

189
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:11,556
Не мислех,че дори помниш 
името на мястото.

190
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:14,892
Не сме ходили там
оше от преди да се оженим.

191
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,722
Обичам те.

192
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:19,829
Искаш ли да ме вземеш в 6?

193
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:22,836
Чао скъпа.

194
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,260
Шофйор ще сляза тук.

195
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,238
- Скъпи трябва да тръгвам.
- Добре мамо.

196
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,205
Г-н Хари Дийвър.

197
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:03,073
Тои казва че го помниш
от реката Биичъм.

198
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:04,772
Да покажи му Лили.

199
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:07,509
- Хари Дийвър?
- Братът на Берта Дийвър.

200
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:13,080
- Хари Дийвър, това е изненада.
- Здравеи Ани.

201
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:14,721
Здравейте госпожо Краусхаймър.

202
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,123
- Не мислех,че ще ме помниш.
- Какво правиш в Ню Йорк?

203
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:20,058
- Тук съм по работа.
- Как е съпругата ти?

204
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,653
- Добре е благодаря.
- А Берта?

205
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,392
Цъщо е добре
Женена за фермер от Бойс.

206
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:27,697
- Има 4 деца. Всичките момичета.
- Радвам се за нея.

207
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,671
- Седни и пийни малко чай.
- Не благодаря.

208
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,833
Имам много работа.
Отбих се само за няколко секунди.

209
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,442
Наистина ме прави щастлива
да срещна някой...

210
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,480
от преди.

211
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:41,778
Кажи това е град.
Всяка вечер е събота.

212
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:45,953
Ани никак не си се променила
от малкото моми4е...

213
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:48,251
което тичаше из цялата къща

214
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:52,157
- Бих те познал на минутата.
- Това е наи-милото нещо,което можеше да кажеш.

215
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:54,485
Познах те.

216
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:56,656
Само като видях снимката
на бюрото на мъжа ти...

217
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:59,565
and recognized you right off.
He's a good-looking fellow.

218
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:01,830
What were you doing with my husband?

219
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,904
You know, Beecham is on the other side
of the river...

220
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:09,972
and it was always incorporated
in Brender County...

221
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:14,673
...between 1936 and now,
you're not legally married.

222
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:16,947
Why, that's terrible.

223
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:18,646
It's nothing.

224
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:20,985
I gave your husband his $2 back...

225
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:23,616
and you don't lose a cent
on the whole thing.

226
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:26,986
- You just get married again.
- I should hope so.

227
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,991
Mother, don't get excited.

228
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:31,123
It's really nothing, Mrs. Krausheimer.

229
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,828
Nothing? How does it look?

230
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:37,300
Don't worry, David will do all right
by your little girl.

231
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:40,739
- How do you know?
- Because David's already called up...

232
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,277
and wants us to have dinner for two
at Momma Lucy's.

233
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:46,109
- He'll marry me tonight.
- I hope so.

234
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:48,515
Can I drive you somewhere?

235
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:50,882
Thanks, Mrs. Krausheimer.
I'd appreciate it.

236
00:17:50,953 --> 00:17:53,217
Give my love to Bertha
and those four girls.

237
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:55,415
Thanks. And goodbye, Annie.

238
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:58,518
I do hope everything will be all right.

239
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:02,496
- Mother, what are you talking about?
- You call me up if anything happens.

240
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:05,055
- Lf nothing happens.
- Don't worry, darling.

241
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:06,499
Goodbye.

242
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,662
Lily?

243
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,942
You know that little bolero suit
that's hanging in the closet?

244
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:19,305
I was married in that suit,
and I want to wear it tonight.

245
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,748
- Isn't that wonderful?
- You know that better than I do, ma'am.

246
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:24,012
Get it, Lily.

247
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,181
Inhale, Mrs. Smith.

248
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:30,323
I can't understand anything hanging
in a closet...

249
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:32,121
shrinking so much.

250
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:38,695
- How are you?
- Fine.

251
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,394
Mrs. Smith's here.

252
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,969
Hello, darling.

253
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:49,068
I thought you weren't going to buy
any more new clothes.

254
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,509
You look kind of cute.

255
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,648
I can't wait to see Momma...

256
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,446
- Do you think we'll get the same table?
- Sure.

257
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,612
It'll be covered in a checkered tablecloth...

258
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,883
and there'll be a candle
in an old Chianti bottle.

259
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:03,618
And Rosa, the fortune teller.

260
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:06,320
You know,
I even love the smell of the place.

261
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,199
Either our noses have changed...

262
00:19:17,272 --> 00:19:20,264
or they've built a livery stable
around here somewhere.

263
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:23,675
It's not exactly Chanel No. 5. Let's go in.

264
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:52,871
The place has changed a little.

265
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:55,040
Customers.

266
00:20:03,685 --> 00:20:05,414
Is Momma Lucy here?

267
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:08,447
I am Momma Lucy.

268
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:13,727
You've changed a little, too.

269
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:15,791
She went back to the old country.

270
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:18,458
Wait a minute. We'd like to eat here.

271
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,632
You want to eat here?

272
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,701
Yes, if you haven't any objections.

273
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:26,673
If you've got no objection,
I've got no objection.

274
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:28,073
Where you like to sit?

275
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,306
We used to come here years ago
and there used to be tables outside.

276
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,747
Would it be too much trouble
to have it the way it used to be?

277
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,411
Are you going to have a 45-cent
or a 65-cent dinner?

278
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,284
- Sixty-five.
- Okay.

279
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:55,296
Table cloth isn't checkered.

280
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:57,735
It's dirty enough so it looks checkered.

281
00:20:57,806 --> 00:21:01,139
Candle stuck in the beer bottle
isn't the same, is it?

282
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:12,348
Haven't they ever seen anybody
eat before?

283
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:16,016
Let's just outstare them.
That'll make them embarrassed.

284
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:23,727
Eat your soup, dear.

285
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:27,663
- There's something wrong with that soup.
- It's your imagination.

286
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:30,000
Why doesn't the cat eat the soup?

287
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:33,633
Animals know what's good for them.
You notice he ate the olives.

288
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,836
- The pits, too.
- That's roughage.

289
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:39,310
Make the best of it.
Don't let it spoil our evening.

290
00:21:39,414 --> 00:21:41,405
That cat knows something.

291
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:45,481
Where shall we go after this?

292
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:46,813
Home.

293
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:53,550
Aren't we supposed to go someplace
before we go home?

294
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:57,591
Altogether, it would make it too late.

295
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:03,334
I'd give $5 to see that cat
take a sip of that soup.

296
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:07,407
- David?
- Yes, dear?

297
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:11,142
Tell me what you do a day in the office,
just a simple day like today.

298
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:14,512
From the time you came in
till you went home, what happened?

299
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:19,616
Just a lot of schmooze.
It's duller than dishwater, really.

300
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:23,624
No, it isn't. I'm very interested.
What sort of things go on in a day?

301
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:26,520
Who did you see?
Please try and remember.

302
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:29,319
Let me see. Oh, yes.

303
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,627
Some sucker came in
and wanted his alimony reduced.

304
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:37,434
Another guy wanted me to rub out a name
in his grandmother's will.

305
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:43,303
And that's about all. I spent
most of the day in conference with Jeff.

306
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:45,740
Things pile up in three days.

307
00:22:47,716 --> 00:22:50,344
I wonder if he'll take a little soup.

308
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,014
Come on.

309
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:54,210
No?

310
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:56,055
No, he won't.

311
00:22:56,858 --> 00:22:58,849
Doesn't that mean something?

312
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:00,792
I want a stomach pump.

313
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:05,192
- Nice cat, eh?
- Yeah.

314
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,528
I'm unlucky with cats here.

315
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:09,704
The third cat this week.

316
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:11,733
They get run over.

317
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,035
I think.

318
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:16,372
- Your name Mrs. Smith?
- Yes, how did you know?

319
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:19,042
Your mother is in the kitchen.

320
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,383
On the phone.

321
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:25,853
It must be about our Red Cross group.

322
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:38,789
Hello, Mother.

323
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,869
Not exactly.

324
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,076
He's teasing me.
He thinks he's being romantic about it.

325
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:53,141
Mother, are you crying?

326
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:56,378
My poor baby.
Thank heaven your father is dead.

327
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:57,643
Listen to me.

328
00:23:57,719 --> 00:24:00,745
Under no conditions, do you hear me,
are you to...

329
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,116
Why, Mother, of course not!

330
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,524
Yes, Mother.

331
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:13,662
Worse comes to worst,
I'll spend the night with you.

332
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:16,227
Good night, my love.

333
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:32,950
Everything all right?

334
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:36,650
Darling, I have a little secret to tell you.

335
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,159
It's about time. What is it, dear?

336
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:42,225
You're a great kid.

337
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:48,927
It's getting rather late
if we have to go anyplace...

338
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:50,733
if you know what I mean.

339
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:52,272
I get it.

340
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,132
Waiter, check.

341
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:04,378
Glasses, dear.

342
00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:09,080
Don't want to drink out of the bottle,
do you?

343
00:25:39,854 --> 00:25:41,481
Get going, Annie.

344
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,288
Keep twirling it, honey.

345
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:55,089
You beast, you know we're not married.
You weren't going to tell me.

346
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:57,927
- I was going to tell you later.
- How much later?

347
00:26:57,999 --> 00:26:59,626
There's no need in going on like this.

348
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,396
You were going to wait until...

349
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:03,630
And then throw me aside
like a squeezed lemon.

350
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,797
Don't dramatize this.

351
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,775
I've given you the best years of my life,
and you were willing to go on and on...

352
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:12,244
Mother and I were always suspicious.
Your forehead slants back too much.

353
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:13,713
- Let me say...
- Don't touch me.

354
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:15,647
- But, Annie, l...
- Get out of here.

355
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,947
Go on, you're not staying here.

356
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:20,010
We can't leave the bedroom
till we've made up.

357
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:22,352
- You're not in the bedroom. Get out!
- Listen to me.

358
00:27:22,424 --> 00:27:24,892
I know you for what you are.
I'm lucky I found you out.

359
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,586
- You're going out of here.
- My clothes!

360
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:27,889
Never come back.

361
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:30,590
I never want to see you again
as long as I live.

362
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:32,428
What are you doing?

363
00:27:55,023 --> 00:27:57,924
- Good evening, Mr. Smith.
- Good evening, Thomas.

364
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,523
Have you a room
for a member who pays his dues?

365
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,792
I'm sure we have.
Quite a novelty seeing you, sir.

366
00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:06,390
Don't remember you spending a night here
in three years.

367
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:07,696
Here you are, sir.

368
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,805
Look out.

369
00:28:22,717 --> 00:28:24,912
- Are you hurt?
- Hello, Smith.

370
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,112
Chuck Benson. Don't you remember me?

371
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:30,919
We played in a foursome
in last year's golf tournament.

372
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:33,358
- Yeah. How are you?
- Fine, how are you?

373
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:36,259
I've got kind of a little crick in my neck...

374
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:38,595
and I thought this might work it out.

375
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,961
I had a fight with my wife, too.

376
00:28:41,035 --> 00:28:42,969
It wasn't exactly a fight.

377
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:44,834
You know what I can't understand?

378
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:47,602
Whenever people fight,
the woman always goes to her mother.

379
00:28:47,675 --> 00:28:51,372
But when my wife and I have a fight,
I have to get out of the house.

380
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:54,176
How do you get back?

381
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:57,377
Simplest thing in the world. Ignore it.

382
00:28:57,452 --> 00:29:00,478
Ignore the whole thing.
The next day, they're dying to see you.

383
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:03,524
Take it from me, brother.
I've had experience.

384
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:06,616
You're right.

385
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:10,431
Just go to the office, don't even telephone.

386
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:13,767
She worries, why don't I come back?

387
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:16,733
And when I do get back, why...

388
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,365
Thank you, Joe.

389
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,720
- What can I do for you?
- What can you do for me?

390
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,389
- What's this?
- A chain to keep people out.

391
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:45,398
Open it up.

392
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:49,130
- Miss Krausheimer's not at home.
- I'm going to come in and wait.

393
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:50,770
Open that up or I'll fire you.

394
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,501
You're not firing me.
I was the midwife when she was born.

395
00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:55,475
I know how you've been acting
towards her...

396
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,671
and all I can say of what she's done
is it's about time.

397
00:29:59,347 --> 00:30:00,974
What about my pen?

398
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,304
Thank you for a wonderful evening.

399
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:27,364
- I'll take you upstairs.
- No. That's quite all right, Mr. Flugle.

400
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:29,967
- I had a wonderful time.
- I did, too, Miss Krausheimer.

401
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:32,444
Good night. No, Mr. Flugle.

402
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:36,106
- They can't rule you out for trying.
- That's right. Good night.

403
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:39,513
Better luck next time. Good night.

404
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:06,809
Open that door. I know you're in there.

405
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:11,149
This is ridiculous. I saw you
with that old goat. Open that door.

406
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:12,846
I'm not going to stand for this.

407
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:14,513
There's your pen.

408
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:19,383
Annie, you open that door.

409
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:34,071
When they come back a second night,
things are bad.

410
00:31:49,424 --> 00:31:51,085
Go on.

411
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,918
- Now...
- Now what?

412
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,962
Are you going to stop this silly farce?

413
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:57,554
I've got a lot of work piled up for me
at the office.

414
00:31:57,632 --> 00:31:59,998
I've been through a 3-day session
of this nonsense...

415
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:02,559
and I haven't any more time
for these games of yours.

416
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:05,367
Come home now,
and I'm willing not to discuss it anymore.

417
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,635
Very generous.
Who do you think you're talking to?

418
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:09,768
- My wife.
- We're not married.

419
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,506
Are you out of your mind?
Certainly we're married.

420
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,105
What do you mean, after three years,
we're not married?

421
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,675
- Legally, we're not married.
- All right, we'll get married.

422
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:21,381
- Does that satisfy you?
- "We'll get married."

423
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:23,252
That's a nice, snarly proposal.

424
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:26,919
It was hard enough getting me to
marry you before, and I didn't know you.

425
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:31,022
But I do now. And how I know you.
And if anyone asks, you're no bargain.

426
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:32,691
What's the matter with me?

427
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:36,203
I don't want this discussion
to run into hours. I'm very busy.

428
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,864
Name one thing about me you don't like.

429
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,602
One thing? My, aren't we vain.

430
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:43,803
One thing I am not is vain.

431
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,210
What about that tar stuff
you rub in your hair...

432
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,747
that smells up my whole bedroom?

433
00:32:47,815 --> 00:32:52,149
I am only trying to save my hair for you.
And you're a fine one to talk...

434
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,711
going to bed with those aluminum clips
in your hair.

435
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:57,952
You turned over one night
and cut me in 20 places.

436
00:32:58,026 --> 00:33:00,358
You needn't worry.
You won't be cut anymore.

437
00:33:00,428 --> 00:33:03,625
I'm not gonna stand any more of this,
and that's my final word.

438
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:05,222
Nice to have met you.

439
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,766
I won't support you.
What do you think of that?

440
00:33:12,473 --> 00:33:13,531
Fine.

441
00:33:13,775 --> 00:33:16,141
No. I mean it.
You're not gonna get any more money.

442
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,734
Who asked you?

443
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,879
I want you to know
that I'm doing this reluctantly.

444
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,747
Suits me. Keep the change.

445
00:33:24,852 --> 00:33:28,379
You're not being very practical.
How do you think you're going to live?

446
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:30,924
I said, how do you think
you're going to live?

447
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:33,984
- Good morning.
- Where are you going, bud?

448
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:06,222
- Are you looking for something?
- Yes.

449
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,728
- Can I help you?
- Yes, you take this aisle here...

450
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,354
No. I'll find it myself.

451
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:13,764
I might be able to save you trouble.
I know the merchandise well.

452
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:16,269
No. I'd just rather run across it myself.

453
00:34:16,337 --> 00:34:20,330
- Something in ladies' lingerie?
- Yes, something in ladies' lingerie.

454
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:23,138
Don't tell me. It's a game I'm playing.

455
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:25,205
That's perfectly all right.

456
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:40,686
I see you. You might as well come up.

457
00:34:41,963 --> 00:34:44,864
- Anything I can do for you, sir?
- Are you crazy?

458
00:34:44,932 --> 00:34:46,763
Please do me a favor and come home.

459
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,734
I'm supposed to be in court this morning.

460
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:51,829
You have the wrong department.
We have nothing here for you.

461
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:54,841
Will you come peacefully,
or will I have to carry you?

462
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,242
The most wonderful feature of these,
you don't have to launder them.

463
00:34:58,312 --> 00:35:01,440
- You merely throw them away.
- That suits me.

464
00:35:01,983 --> 00:35:03,917
No! Leave me!

465
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,679
What are you doing to the customer?

466
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:09,723
I'm not doing anything.
Look who's got who.

467
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:11,554
Release our sales clerk.

468
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:13,787
Do you want to try
and make me release her?

469
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,591
If you're not pleased with this clerk,
I'll get you another.

470
00:35:16,664 --> 00:35:19,929
I'm pleased with her, but she's no clerk.
She's my wife.

471
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:23,300
- I am not.
- We understood you were a single woman.

472
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,932
As an aid to the unemployment crisis,
we do not employ married women.

473
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,033
- And quite right, too.
- I'm not married.

474
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,134
She's married all right.

475
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,736
- We have to go to the head of the firm.
- Take me to him.

476
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:35,180
- Let's all go.
- This way, please.

477
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:52,422
This gentleman claims he's married
to Miss Krausheimer.

478
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,525
- We're not married.
- We're married, all right.

479
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:58,299
You understand it is not our policy
to employ married women?

480
00:35:58,372 --> 00:35:59,430
I told her that.

481
00:35:59,507 --> 00:36:01,941
- I tell you, we are not married.
- She's married.

482
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:04,500
- Where did you meet this monkey?
- Sylvia introduced me.

483
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,740
That's the last time
I want you to talk to Sylvia.

484
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:09,112
- I never liked her.
- I tell you, I'm a single girl.

485
00:36:09,183 --> 00:36:10,411
She is not, you old goat.

486
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:12,611
What do you mean
by taking out innocent girls...

487
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:14,279
the night before you give them a job?

488
00:36:14,355 --> 00:36:16,653
- I'm not innocent.
- She admits it. She's my wife.

489
00:36:16,724 --> 00:36:19,750
- I didn't admit anything.
- Are you referring to me as an old goat?

490
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:21,522
- Sit down.
- Store detectives.

491
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,224
Yes. I'll get the store detectives.

492
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:32,636
Are you satisfied now?

493
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:35,608
I have an appointment at the office.
Will you make up with me?

494
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:37,541
No. I'm not going
to make up with you ever.

495
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,876
For heaven's sake,
what's the matter with you?

496
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:43,178
I said that if I had to do it all over again,
I wouldn't marry you.

497
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:46,220
Now I can do it all over again,
and I want to come back.

498
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,881
Doesn't that convince you
I want to stay married to you?

499
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:52,824
I believe you, and I'm very flattered,
but I don't want to marry you.

500
00:36:52,894 --> 00:36:55,692
- I'm not interested.
- What's the matter with me?

501
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:59,893
I don't like your temper. You're jealous.
You're always knocking people down.

502
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,696
If you're referring to New Year's Eve...

503
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:05,296
that drunk didn't have any right
to pick up your garter and wave it around.

504
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:06,738
I showed you both my garters.

505
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:10,106
- After you'd gotten Julie's garters.
- They were my garters.

506
00:37:10,177 --> 00:37:12,645
- They were Julie's garters.
- How do you know?

507
00:37:12,713 --> 00:37:14,112
I know they weren't yours.

508
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:17,673
Do you two have a license
to get this crowd around?

509
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,309
What do you mean, license?
Run on about your business.

510
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:23,380
Go on and hit him, why don't you?
Knock him down. Go ahead.

511
00:37:23,457 --> 00:37:26,449
I wouldn't advise your friend
to strike an officer in this town.

512
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:28,995
Officer, I'm on your side.
I don't even know this man.

513
00:37:29,063 --> 00:37:32,123
Beat it, buddy. You go this way.
And you go visit Columbus Circle.

514
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:34,099
Go on, scatter. Break it up.

515
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,033
Wait. You can't do this to me.

516
00:37:43,978 --> 00:37:45,240
Come in.

517
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:48,114
Hello, David.

518
00:37:50,418 --> 00:37:52,045
I postponed the Amanda case for you...

519
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:54,144
and set back the Duffy hearing...

520
00:37:54,221 --> 00:37:57,281
and asked for a continuance
against the streetcar company.

521
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,053
That's fine. Just fine.

522
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,189
I'd like to ask you to do something.

523
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,028
I'll get my work cleaned up
in no time at all.

524
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:08,328
I can't seem to get my mind
on it right now.

525
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:09,892
That's all right.

526
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:11,939
You don't know
what I'm going to ask you yet.

527
00:38:12,006 --> 00:38:14,474
Sure. Anything you want. You know.

528
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:18,945
I'd like to have you drop in
at your own home tonight...

529
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,680
after dinner.

530
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,847
What do you mean?

531
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:31,584
I took matters in my own hands
and asked Ann to have me to dinner.

532
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:34,753
She's fond of me,
and she knows I'm fond of her.

533
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:38,093
I think I can straighten this thing out.

534
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,193
I hope it is something I can straighten out.

535
00:38:41,268 --> 00:38:44,101
It's nothing at all.
It's just a little marital quarrel.

536
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:45,536
It's nothing at all, really.

537
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:49,064
I imagined it was that.
You're too fine to do anything shoddy.

538
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:53,313
I'd like to have you
just drop in unannounced...

539
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:56,316
at, shall we say, 9:00?

540
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:02,717
That's all right.

541
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:06,051
- You're the best friend a man ever had.
- We're partners.

542
00:39:06,127 --> 00:39:08,118
You're the best partner a man ever had.

543
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:09,628
We were school chums.

544
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:11,790
You're the best fullback
that Alabama ever had.

545
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:14,061
I thought Henkel was great...

546
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:17,394
but Henkel couldn't touch you.

547
00:39:19,006 --> 00:39:20,496
Thanks, David.

548
00:39:40,227 --> 00:39:42,252
- May I come in?
- I'll see.

549
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:50,166
It's all right.

550
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,232
Hello, Ann.

551
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:03,414
David, I want you to talk to my lawyer.

552
00:40:04,385 --> 00:40:05,511
Your lawyer?

553
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,351
What lawyer?

554
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:09,685
Ann has asked me
to represent her in this matter.

555
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:10,883
What for?

556
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:13,552
I've been telling her
she doesn't need a lawyer.

557
00:40:13,627 --> 00:40:14,685
I'll say she doesn't.

558
00:40:14,762 --> 00:40:18,323
She just told me all about it,
and as I understand the facts of the case...

559
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:19,661
you two aren't married at all.

560
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:21,462
- There you are.
- What?

561
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:23,435
So there's nothing for the court to decide.

562
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,472
It happened before,
in <i>Peterson v. Peterson.</i>

563
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:27,234
They threw it out of the Supreme Court.

564
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:28,605
What's the matter with you?

565
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,373
He said you're lucky it isn't the South,
and that I'm not his sister.

566
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,744
Why, you hillbilly ambulance chaser.

567
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:36,578
Now, there's no need to lose our temper.

568
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,948
We're married.
If not legally, then by common law.

569
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,452
That's just as good. It's better.

570
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,251
I don't deny there's
a common-law relationship between you.

571
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:44,791
Tell him the whole thing.

572
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,657
The woman is given the benefit
of any difficulties arising...

573
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:50,595
out of such a relationship.
For instance, should you die...

574
00:40:50,664 --> 00:40:53,326
as a wife, she's entitled
to share in the husband's estate.

575
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,368
Great. When I die, she'll get the furniture.

576
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:57,836
You're entitled to hold yourself forth
as the husband.

577
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:00,738
I am holding myself forth as the husband.

578
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:03,102
I wish you'd tell me something
I don't know.

579
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:05,873
Should the woman, however,
care to halt the relationship...

580
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:08,073
and marry someone else,
she's entitled to do so.

581
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:10,083
<i>Peterson v. Peterson, Adams v. Kelly...</i>

582
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:12,278
and <i>Gimbel v.</i>
<i>New Pennsylvania Coal Company.</i>

583
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:15,720
You are supposed to be my best friend,
and you're telling her this?

584
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:18,815
I have never taken advantage
of our friendship by word or deed...

585
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,088
and it's only
because you're standing here...

586
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:23,096
that I can now ask Ann.

587
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:25,556
Would you have dinner
with me tomorrow night?

588
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:28,363
I'm asking you to come to your senses
and marry me tomorrow.

589
00:41:28,435 --> 00:41:31,063
If you have dinner with him, this is final.
We're through.

590
00:41:31,138 --> 00:41:32,469
What time?

591
00:41:32,673 --> 00:41:34,834
We're through.
From now on, we're just friends.

592
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,001
That's not necessary.

593
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,341
- Is the Florida Club all right?
- Anywhere you say.

594
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:55,061
- I'll call for you at 8:00.
- That'll be fine.

595
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,693
- Good night, Jeff.
- Good night.

596
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,264
- Good night, Ann.
- Good night.

597
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:52,108
Comparing yourself to Henkel
as a football player.

598
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:54,347
You couldn't carry Henkel's water bucket.

599
00:42:54,421 --> 00:42:55,911
Good night, David.

600
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:17,268
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

601
00:43:25,419 --> 00:43:28,411
- Who is it?
- Could I see you a moment, please?

602
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:29,751
Just a minute.

603
00:43:37,097 --> 00:43:39,930
Good night, David. Your nose is bleeding.

604
00:43:45,005 --> 00:43:47,200
Are you sure that stuff is good
for a nosebleed?

605
00:43:47,274 --> 00:43:50,004
Best thing in the world. I always use it.

606
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:54,073
I don't know. I use it for everything.

607
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:02,554
Yeah. Oh, boy!

608
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,458
I guess I am a kind of a dummy.

609
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,188
The last thing in the world I should do
is chase her.

610
00:44:09,263 --> 00:44:11,925
Leave her alone for a week or 10 days.

611
00:44:12,466 --> 00:44:14,058
She's used to me.

612
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:17,766
She can't get to sleep until I get home.

613
00:44:19,373 --> 00:44:23,036
I'll have fun for a couple of nights.
Play a little poker with the boys.

614
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,270
Gloria?

615
00:44:27,514 --> 00:44:29,072
I thought there was a woman in here.

616
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:30,582
Hiya, Gloria.

617
00:44:32,453 --> 00:44:34,284
And I'm kissing you back.

618
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,016
Jimmy?

619
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,289
This is no Jimmy, this is Chuckie.

620
00:44:43,397 --> 00:44:45,228
Been missing your Chuckie, honey?

621
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:48,427
She's a wonderful girl.
Society girl. Real class.

622
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:51,027
How about tomorrow night?

623
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:52,770
Attagirl.

624
00:44:52,873 --> 00:44:55,034
Listen, I got a friend. How about Gertrude?

625
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,771
- You'll like Gertrude.
- Me? Gertrude?

626
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,346
He's a wonderful fella.
Society fella. Real class.

627
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:03,849
Did you ever see the girl
in the Camel advertisements?

628
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:05,282
Is she as good-looking as that?

629
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:09,550
Gertrude, I got a nice little dinner partner
for you tomorrow night...

630
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:12,989
but he kind of needs cheering up.
Know what I mean?

631
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:17,788
She wants to talk to you.

632
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,362
Hello?

633
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,368
- She's kissing at me.
- Kiss back at her.

634
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:32,642
- I don't know her.
- It's all for a laugh. She's a great kid.

635
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,787
It feels kind of silly.

636
00:45:44,858 --> 00:45:47,520
How do you know you're crazy about me?

637
00:45:50,697 --> 00:45:52,858
It's just an ordinary voice.

638
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,200
I used to sing a little.

639
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:58,629
Didn't I tell you? He's a great fella.

640
00:45:58,705 --> 00:45:59,899
8:00?

641
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:02,270
Where do we make it?

642
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:05,638
The Florida Club.

643
00:46:05,712 --> 00:46:07,612
How about the Florida Club?

644
00:46:07,748 --> 00:46:09,443
Okay. Goodbye.

645
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,746
Wait till you see her.

646
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:14,578
What has Gertrude got to do with Camels?

647
00:46:14,655 --> 00:46:15,986
She smokes them.

648
00:46:16,056 --> 00:46:18,786
But you said something about
the advertisements.

649
00:46:19,393 --> 00:46:22,760
She looks like that girl.
She's a dead ringer for her.

650
00:46:22,963 --> 00:46:24,453
She likes my voice.

651
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,829
That isn't all she'll like.

652
00:46:28,902 --> 00:46:31,894
Yes, I'll take care of that, Mr. Rondell.
I'll do the best...

653
00:46:31,972 --> 00:46:34,031
I'll be there in a minute.

654
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,732
Mr. Chuck Benson's party.

655
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:38,539
Yes, sir. They're expecting you.
Right this way.

656
00:47:24,224 --> 00:47:27,955
Not there, Davey. Not there.
Over here, Davey.

657
00:47:28,061 --> 00:47:30,757
Davey, my boy. The one and only!

658
00:47:31,365 --> 00:47:33,663
Here he is, kids, in the flesh.

659
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,094
What's been keeping you?

660
00:47:35,168 --> 00:47:36,658
Hello, there.

661
00:47:37,337 --> 00:47:38,998
What's held you up, Davey?

662
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:42,735
The girls have been waiting here for you
for more than an hour.

663
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,303
I've been a little busy at the office.

664
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,907
No, not there. That doesn't go there.
Keep your hands off of Gloria.

665
00:47:49,983 --> 00:47:53,817
This is Gertie, here.
No, right here is where the chair goes.

666
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,422
Gloria O'Day and Gertie Schultz,
this is Davey Smith.

667
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:57,821
How do you do?

668
00:47:57,891 --> 00:47:59,552
What are you gonna have to drink?

669
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,322
- Try an Old Fashioned.
- Yeah, have an Old Fashioned.

670
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:04,762
Waiter, bring us another Old Fashioned.

671
00:48:08,101 --> 00:48:10,592
Isn't it a little crowded in here?

672
00:48:10,671 --> 00:48:13,003
Couldn't we go someplace
where it was quieter...

673
00:48:13,073 --> 00:48:15,473
- maybe a little darker?
- Hold it, cookie.

674
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:18,033
We'll go to one of them dark,
romantic places later.

675
00:48:18,111 --> 00:48:21,239
- We're eating first. You ever been here?
- Yes, often.

676
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,341
That's why I wanted to go someplace
where it was darker.

677
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:25,976
I don't get it.

678
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:41,495
It's awfully hot in here.
I know a place that's very cool.

679
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:44,059
Don't rush it.
We're stuck for the cover charge anyway.

680
00:48:44,137 --> 00:48:48,005
- Say, Davey, a couple more hours of this...
- I beg your pardon.

681
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,434
Your pheasant, <i>madame.</i>

682
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,670
- Dish it out. I'm starved.
- I could eat a horse.

683
00:48:51,745 --> 00:48:54,475
- Remember to take the feathers off.
- Ours'll be right here.

684
00:49:02,889 --> 00:49:04,379
David's here.

685
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:06,653
Yes, so I see.

686
00:49:08,228 --> 00:49:09,889
Who's he with, I wonder?

687
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,001
So you wanna wrestle, huh?

688
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:39,290
She's rather pretty, isn't she?
Do you know her, Jeff?

689
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,792
No, I don't.

690
00:49:52,105 --> 00:49:54,266
- I want to dance.
- Fine.

691
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:30,043
- Would you care to dance, dear?
- Yes, indeed.

692
00:50:32,846 --> 00:50:35,314
You're looking for trouble, buddy.

693
00:50:35,515 --> 00:50:37,210
You know what this pheasant is?

694
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:40,082
Nothing but chicken,
and tough chicken at that.

695
00:50:40,153 --> 00:50:43,748
$3 for this, with a couple of French fries.
What a racket.

696
00:50:44,057 --> 00:50:47,993
Gertie doesn't seem to like the food here.
Maybe we better go somewhere else.

697
00:50:48,061 --> 00:50:50,393
It's getting better.
You gotta work on it a little.

698
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,658
Relax.

699
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:53,795
I think Gertie's right.

700
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:55,698
We should've ordered some chop suey.

701
00:50:55,769 --> 00:50:57,964
What's the matter, baby?
Don't you like pheasant?

702
00:50:58,038 --> 00:51:01,371
- No, I'd like some chop suey.
- Just pour some ketchup on it.

703
00:51:01,441 --> 00:51:05,104
- Waiter, bring us some ketchup.
- But I don't like ketchup.

704
00:51:05,178 --> 00:51:07,703
Then scrape the gravy off.
That ought to fix it.

705
00:51:07,781 --> 00:51:10,079
I still think
we should've ordered some chop suey.

706
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,313
Just eat it up, honey. Maybe Davey
will invite us over to his house.

707
00:51:13,386 --> 00:51:15,354
Yeah? Swell.

708
00:51:15,756 --> 00:51:17,656
- Eat it up.
- All right.

709
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,229
My nose has started bleeding.
I've got to go home again.

710
00:52:36,303 --> 00:52:38,931
- That's all right. I can stop a nosebleed.
- Wait a minute.

711
00:52:39,005 --> 00:52:41,667
- Just lie right down.
- No, wait.

712
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:45,810
- Chum, give me a hunk of ice, will you?
- Here you are.

713
00:52:47,447 --> 00:52:49,415
Just take it easy. I know how to stop that.

714
00:52:49,482 --> 00:52:51,882
I used to fix two of these a night
at the dance hall.

715
00:52:51,952 --> 00:52:53,977
Why don't you try
a cold knife under his nose?

716
00:52:54,054 --> 00:52:55,954
- Good idea.
- Let me up.

717
00:52:56,790 --> 00:53:00,157
Don't talk. Waiter, put that chicken back
on the stove, will you?

718
00:53:00,227 --> 00:53:02,661
It's nothing, folks.
Stand back and give him some air.

719
00:53:02,729 --> 00:53:04,356
He should've ordered chop suey, too.

720
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,059
I knew the way he was acting
he'd get a punch in the nose.

721
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:09,601
Maybe he saw something
that made him dizzy.

722
00:53:09,669 --> 00:53:11,034
Come, Ann.

723
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:15,140
- Give me another knife. This one's hot.
- Okay.

724
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:17,335
Just cut my throat with it.

725
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,307
- Lf you're upset, I'll gladly take you home.
- Upset? Why?

726
00:53:24,384 --> 00:53:26,875
Because I saw David
with Florence Nightingale?

727
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,716
I don't care who holds a knife to him...

728
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,814
although I'd certainly like
the chance myself.

729
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:36,887
Is there someplace you'd like to go?

730
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,759
Yes. I feel like staying up all night tonight.

731
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:43,331
I know. Let's go to the fair.

732
00:53:43,937 --> 00:53:44,926
Good idea.

733
00:54:56,609 --> 00:54:59,703
I was never so happy in all my life.
Wonderful evening.

734
00:55:17,297 --> 00:55:18,662
Wonderful!

735
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:20,732
So happy and carefree.

736
00:55:35,382 --> 00:55:39,250
They're being very clever.
They're making believe we're stuck.

737
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,743
We are stuck.

738
00:55:42,555 --> 00:55:44,455
That's what I thought.

739
00:55:49,963 --> 00:55:54,297
- Why don't they do something about it?
- Keep calm, don't be frightened.

740
00:55:54,734 --> 00:55:57,396
It's much better to stay where we are.

741
00:56:22,362 --> 00:56:25,331
- You're soaked through.
- It's nothing.

742
00:56:30,537 --> 00:56:33,904
- You're catching cold.
- It's only a little sniffle.

743
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,739
You know what David does
if he sneezes twice in one evening?

744
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,874
He goes to bed
with four hot water bottles...

745
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:47,181
a quart of brandy,
and a red woolen cap over his head.

746
00:56:47,253 --> 00:56:50,654
You ought to see him in bed
with that red woolen cap.

747
00:56:51,524 --> 00:56:53,822
The moment we get down,
we go to your apartment...

748
00:56:53,893 --> 00:56:55,884
and get you into some dry clothes.

749
00:56:55,962 --> 00:56:57,429
My apartment?

750
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,570
Excuse me.

751
00:57:17,984 --> 00:57:19,884
What a beautiful room.

752
00:57:20,954 --> 00:57:23,252
No wonder you've never gotten married.

753
00:57:23,323 --> 00:57:26,053
- Who did it for you, Jeff?
- I did it myself.

754
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:29,118
- Do you like the color scheme?
- You did?

755
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:32,030
David couldn't even tell you
the color of our walls.

756
00:57:32,098 --> 00:57:34,328
He could be living in a tent.

757
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:40,536
It's the most tasteful man's bedroom
I've ever seen.

758
00:57:41,574 --> 00:57:42,939
Thank you.

759
00:57:44,978 --> 00:57:46,206
What about your hair?

760
00:57:46,279 --> 00:57:49,680
Don't worry about it.
I'll just dry it in front of the fire.

761
00:57:49,749 --> 00:57:51,341
Would you excuse me?

762
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:53,942
I'm going to get
into something more comfortable.

763
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:13,531
Is that your idea
of something more comfortable?

764
00:58:14,374 --> 00:58:16,171
I only have one dinner coat.

765
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:19,006
Don't tell me you expect
to go out again in your condition.

766
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:21,012
This hasn't been
much of an evening for you.

767
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,640
Don't you ever think about yourself?

768
00:58:23,883 --> 00:58:26,443
What you need, young man,
is a little medical attention.

769
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:28,544
I feel fine, really.

770
00:58:28,621 --> 00:58:32,057
Two big swallows of this, there'll be
one less pneumonia case tomorrow.

771
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:33,820
There. Now, sit right over there.

772
00:58:33,893 --> 00:58:36,760
- Is that for me?
- Yes. All in one big gulp.

773
00:58:37,063 --> 00:58:40,191
I don't drink liquor. I just keep it for David.

774
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,094
- And friends.
- You never drink liquor at all?

775
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:45,637
I haven't anything against
other people drinking it...

776
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:48,265
but I just never seem to get around
to breaking training.

777
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:51,469
- I eat four different vegetables a day.
- Really?

778
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,910
When I was a young fella,
I attended a temperance lecture...

779
00:58:54,981 --> 00:58:57,916
and it was very instructive.
I've never forgotten it.

780
00:58:57,984 --> 00:59:00,475
This man was explaining
the evils of liquor...

781
00:59:00,553 --> 00:59:03,545
and there was a drunk in the audience
who kept interrupting him.

782
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,683
Finally, the lecturer asked the drunk
to come up on the platform.

783
00:59:06,759 --> 00:59:08,852
When he got there,
he asked him to open one eye.

784
00:59:08,928 --> 00:59:10,088
Do you know what he did?

785
00:59:10,163 --> 00:59:13,655
He took an eyedropper full of whiskey
and squirted it into that man's eye.

786
00:59:13,733 --> 00:59:16,668
You never heard such hollering
in all your life.

787
00:59:16,736 --> 00:59:20,502
Of course, his whole eye got inflamed,
and the lecturer pointed out...

788
00:59:20,573 --> 00:59:22,370
that the lining in your stomach...

789
00:59:22,442 --> 00:59:25,570
is exactly the same composition
as your eyeball.

790
00:59:27,347 --> 00:59:29,315
I've never been able to forget that.

791
00:59:29,382 --> 00:59:31,475
It's rather a dirty trick.

792
00:59:32,852 --> 00:59:34,114
Then you know what happened?

793
00:59:34,187 --> 00:59:36,985
The drunk left the hall
and came back a few minutes later...

794
00:59:37,056 --> 00:59:41,152
and went up on the platform
and asked the lecturer to open his eye.

795
00:59:41,227 --> 00:59:43,195
- And do you know what he did?
- What?

796
00:59:43,263 --> 00:59:46,596
He jammed a whole handful
of corn crinkles in that man's eye...

797
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,963
and said to the audience:

798
00:59:48,034 --> 00:59:50,867
"That's what corn crinkles do
to the lining of your stomach."

799
00:59:50,937 --> 00:59:52,734
It served him right.

800
00:59:55,608 --> 00:59:58,406
This isn't alcohol, it's medicine.

801
01:00:02,482 --> 01:00:05,974
- Lf you think I ought to...
- Yes, I do. One big gulp, now.

802
01:00:19,999 --> 01:00:23,298
Don't you feel it?
Doesn't it burn you or anything?

803
01:00:24,137 --> 01:00:25,195
No.

804
01:00:25,972 --> 01:00:29,203
I've tried this before,
and it's very interesting.

805
01:00:29,342 --> 01:00:31,037
I don't mind the taste of it.

806
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:33,305
Only thing is,
my metabolism must be very high...

807
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,438
because unfortunately
I'm not one of those...

808
01:00:35,515 --> 01:00:37,483
strong, silent men
who can hold their liquor.

809
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,245
I never saw anyone hold it as well.

810
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:42,345
I don't think one is going
to do you any good.

811
01:00:42,488 --> 01:00:45,218
I think another one would be a mistake.

812
01:00:45,491 --> 01:00:48,221
It's just medicine. It kills the germs.

813
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,359
All in one gulp, now.

814
01:00:51,964 --> 01:00:53,625
Your good health.

815
01:00:58,504 --> 01:01:00,267
What a constitution.

816
01:01:21,961 --> 01:01:24,486
Maybe that second one was too much.

817
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:28,098
Miss Ann...

818
01:01:31,871 --> 01:01:33,133
may I...

819
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,268
beg your leave for a moment?

820
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:39,075
Certainly.

821
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:59,789
Are you feeling all right?

822
01:02:05,204 --> 01:02:08,037
You come right over here and sit down.

823
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:14,639
- I wouldn't want to get bold.
- We'll keep the table between us.

824
01:02:14,714 --> 01:02:18,047
That's right. Right over here.
You sit right there.

825
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:22,144
I'll sit right over here.

826
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,528
My only fear is that I may not act
like a gentleman.

827
01:02:39,806 --> 01:02:42,036
I always say
a man's true character comes out...

828
01:02:42,108 --> 01:02:44,133
when he's had one drink too many.

829
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:46,838
Do you know the basic difference
between you and David?

830
01:02:46,913 --> 01:02:49,609
You give him one too many,
and he tilts forward at you.

831
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:52,150
And you, Jeff, you lean backwards.

832
01:02:53,319 --> 01:02:54,581
Thank you.

833
01:02:54,654 --> 01:02:57,555
I'll tell you something else.
All evening I've been waiting...

834
01:02:57,623 --> 01:02:59,614
for just one little suspicious move
from you.

835
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,284
There isn't one man in a thousand...

836
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,227
who wouldn't take out a girl
in my position and try something.

837
01:03:04,297 --> 01:03:06,857
No matter how faint,
it would still be something.

838
01:03:06,933 --> 01:03:09,663
And look how wonderfully you're acting.

839
01:03:10,736 --> 01:03:12,033
Thank you.

840
01:03:12,104 --> 01:03:16,063
The very first time I went out with David,
he ruined a brand new $85 dress I had.

841
01:03:16,142 --> 01:03:19,578
He was just awful. Didn't change
the whole first year we were married.

842
01:03:19,645 --> 01:03:21,738
I used to think
maybe it was the things he ate.

843
01:03:21,814 --> 01:03:24,942
I tried changing his diet around
and everything.

844
01:03:26,118 --> 01:03:27,483
Thank you.

845
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:30,454
I had a wonderful evening.
I'm going to leave you now.

846
01:03:30,523 --> 01:03:32,991
You cover up warm in bed
and get a good night's sleep.

847
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,789
You'll feel much better in the morning.

848
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,234
I intend taking you home, Ann.

849
01:03:43,302 --> 01:03:45,566
- Absolutely not, Jeff.
- Thank you.

850
01:03:45,638 --> 01:03:47,606
- Good night.
- Good night.

851
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:54,211
You're probably dying to kiss me,
and haven't got the nerve.

852
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,180
- That's true.
- You may.

853
01:03:58,518 --> 01:04:00,042
I have a cold.

854
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:02,210
That's very considerate.

855
01:04:07,126 --> 01:04:08,150
Thank you.

856
01:04:08,227 --> 01:04:10,354
That's another difference
between you and David.

857
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,659
Colds never stopped him.
He had the measles once.

858
01:04:12,732 --> 01:04:15,758
How I didn't get the measles
I'll never know.

859
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:18,630
Good night, Jeff.

860
01:04:19,639 --> 01:04:21,266
Good night, Ann.

861
01:04:32,351 --> 01:04:34,012
Here we go again.

862
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:44,024
I hope she's not going to visit her mother
out on Long Island again.

863
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:46,860
- I don't think so.
- My wife don't like me to do this.

864
01:04:46,933 --> 01:04:50,494
This is like driving private.
I don't get any freedom.

865
01:04:50,703 --> 01:04:53,695
- You're getting paid, aren't you?
- You owe me some more money.

866
01:04:53,773 --> 01:04:57,869
- I gave you $20 day before yesterday.
- You used that up two days ago.

867
01:04:57,944 --> 01:05:00,105
I'll pay you later. Don't lose her.

868
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:02,613
How did you ever become
a private detective anyway?

869
01:05:02,682 --> 01:05:04,946
My whole family are private detectives.

870
01:05:05,017 --> 01:05:07,884
This must be costing her husband
a pile of dough.

871
01:05:07,954 --> 01:05:09,683
- You want to hear my opinion?
- What?

872
01:05:09,755 --> 01:05:12,485
You ain't gonna catch her at anything.
She's pretty foxy.

873
01:05:12,558 --> 01:05:13,923
I don't know.

874
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,257
- You know what we ought to do?
- What?

875
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,092
Let's go to a burlesque show.

876
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,428
This dame ain't gonna
do nothing this afternoon.

877
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:24,026
- In the afternoons is when you catch them.
- No kidding?

878
01:05:24,704 --> 01:05:26,638
- That's funny.
- What is?

879
01:05:27,206 --> 01:05:29,868
Where does my wife go every afternoon?

880
01:05:31,143 --> 01:05:33,407
Look, she's going to visit me.

881
01:05:49,795 --> 01:05:51,194
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

882
01:05:51,263 --> 01:05:54,824
- Someone's waiting for you.
- That's perfectly all right.

883
01:05:56,102 --> 01:05:58,900
Mr. Smith, it's about time.

884
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:02,769
- How do you do, Mister...
- You've even forgotten my name.

885
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,870
I'm a client of yours.

886
01:06:04,944 --> 01:06:08,903
I paid you a $1,000 retainer fee
to sue my brother-in-law.

887
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:11,711
- My name is Conway.
- Yes, of course, Mr. Conway.

888
01:06:11,784 --> 01:06:13,547
Won't you sit down?

889
01:06:13,753 --> 01:06:16,916
I made up my mind I was going to see you
if it took me all week.

890
01:06:16,989 --> 01:06:19,514
- And it has. Where were you?
- Relax, Mr. Connolley.

891
01:06:19,592 --> 01:06:22,186
We've got your brother-in-law
right where we want him.

892
01:06:22,261 --> 01:06:24,252
If you'll lie down, I'll get the files.

893
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:25,524
My name is Conway.

894
01:06:25,598 --> 01:06:28,431
I've been sleeping here so much,
I can't sleep at home.

895
01:06:30,336 --> 01:06:32,634
- Where's my wife?
- She's in Mr. Custer's office.

896
01:06:32,705 --> 01:06:35,265
Mr. Custer's parents surprised him.

897
01:06:35,808 --> 01:06:37,935
The truth is, we're going to Lake Placid.

898
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:41,446
We always talked about a vacation
in the snow, now we're going to do it.

899
01:06:41,514 --> 01:06:44,347
But we didn't know there'd be nearly
two hours between trains.

900
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,476
Is there no chance
that you two can join us?

901
01:06:48,854 --> 01:06:51,015
- They're all in there?
- Yes.

902
01:06:57,563 --> 01:06:59,428
What about Mr. Conway?

903
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,595
Hello, Jeff.

904
01:07:06,238 --> 01:07:07,603
Excuse me.

905
01:07:13,979 --> 01:07:15,742
About poor old Conway...

906
01:07:15,815 --> 01:07:20,616
his brother-in-law has him where it hurts.
I've been thinking about it a great deal.

907
01:07:20,686 --> 01:07:23,883
- Why, you're David Smith.
- Jefferson's partner.

908
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:26,124
David Smith. My parents.

909
01:07:26,192 --> 01:07:29,161
How do you do, sir? I'm glad to see you.

910
01:07:29,228 --> 01:07:30,286
The pleasure is all mine.

911
01:07:30,362 --> 01:07:33,092
We know so much about you.
Jefferson's written and written.

912
01:07:33,165 --> 01:07:36,760
You're like one of the family.
This is Mr. Smith. Miss Ann Krausheimer.

913
01:07:36,836 --> 01:07:40,033
- We met some time ago.
- We know each other very well.

914
01:07:40,106 --> 01:07:42,404
You've probably seen a great deal of her.

915
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,375
Yes, I have. A great deal.

916
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:47,079
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

917
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,614
Sit right down, boy.
We'll all get acquainted at once.

918
01:07:49,682 --> 01:07:51,877
Mother and I have just met Miss Ann...

919
01:07:51,951 --> 01:07:55,682
and we find out now
they're both mighty sweet on each other.

920
01:07:55,855 --> 01:07:58,289
David probably knows it better
than we do, don't you?

921
01:07:58,357 --> 01:08:01,451
Yes, if it hadn't been for me,
they'd never have gotten together.

922
01:08:01,527 --> 01:08:05,224
- That's so romantic.
- Any of your family from the South?

923
01:08:05,564 --> 01:08:07,532
No, not exactly...

924
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,661
but I had a relative in the Civil War
who didn't fight at all. He was a slacker.

925
01:08:11,737 --> 01:08:14,797
A great many Northerners saw it that way,
and I give them credit.

926
01:08:14,874 --> 01:08:17,240
- You know what I was thinking?
- What, Mrs. Custer?

927
01:08:17,309 --> 01:08:21,302
If two people wanted to go on honeymoon,
they could take the boat to New Orleans...

928
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,610
and motor right up through the South
to our home.

929
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:27,675
- A boat's a wonderful place for two people.
- That wouldn't be very good... Excuse me.

930
01:08:27,753 --> 01:08:29,050
That wouldn't be good for Ann.

931
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:31,817
She was very sick
when we took the night boat to Albany.

932
01:08:31,891 --> 01:08:33,085
She's not a very good sailor.

933
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:35,627
I can give you some good practical
advice on that, too.

934
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:39,357
Whenever she gets on a boat,
don't let her have anything to eat.

935
01:08:39,431 --> 01:08:41,991
Put her to bed,
put a hot-water bottle on her stomach...

936
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:44,092
and hold it there,
no matter how she hollers.

937
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:45,102
It settles her stomach.

938
01:08:46,138 --> 01:08:48,436
He considers himself
quite a medical authority.

939
01:08:48,507 --> 01:08:49,474
Yes.

940
01:08:49,575 --> 01:08:51,543
How do you like New York?

941
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:55,569
Fine. It's so big, though,
with everybody rushing around.

942
01:08:55,648 --> 01:08:58,845
That's rather deceiving.
We're really one big happy family here.

943
01:08:58,918 --> 01:09:02,786
There are a thousand and one little things
that go on underneath the surface...

944
01:09:02,855 --> 01:09:05,881
That reminds me. What about my laundry?

945
01:09:06,358 --> 01:09:08,451
I haven't any more shorts.

946
01:09:09,662 --> 01:09:12,563
Ann kind of took care of his things
around the house.

947
01:09:12,631 --> 01:09:14,690
Little household things.

948
01:09:14,767 --> 01:09:16,735
One of the best housekeepers
you ever saw.

949
01:09:16,802 --> 01:09:19,669
I suppose you're wondering about us.
It's quite simple.

950
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,332
I've known Ann for a long time
and wanted to marry her.

951
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:26,504
Still do, as a matter of fact,
but, well, fortunes of war.

952
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:29,808
- I see.
- Let me tell you something.

953
01:09:29,882 --> 01:09:33,318
I know of no finer compliment
I could pay to any girl than to say this:

954
01:09:33,452 --> 01:09:35,920
When a man's been sitting
across the breakfast table...

955
01:09:35,988 --> 01:09:38,388
from the same woman
for three solid years...

956
01:09:38,457 --> 01:09:42,553
and still wants to marry her,
she's quite a girl.

957
01:09:46,732 --> 01:09:49,929
Jeff, may I see you in private, please?
Come, Mother.

958
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,336
- Excuse us, please.
- Certainly.

959
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,575
Excuse me a minute, Ann.

960
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,911
- We can go in here, Father.
- In here, Jefferson.

961
01:10:05,885 --> 01:10:08,115
What kind of white trash
have you taken up with?

962
01:10:08,187 --> 01:10:10,849
- I know it sounded very confusing.
- I wasn't confused.

963
01:10:10,923 --> 01:10:13,050
What's she doing with a bottle
on her stomach?

964
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,855
- Sending his shorts to the laundry?
- Three years, breakfast?

965
01:10:15,928 --> 01:10:18,362
- They had a peculiar relationship.
- Were they married?

966
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:21,228
- Not exactly.
- I thought so.

967
01:10:22,334 --> 01:10:24,427
The plumbing isn't very good
in this building.

968
01:10:24,503 --> 01:10:26,471
Don't jump to any conclusions about Ann.

969
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:28,500
Are you satisfied now?

970
01:10:29,108 --> 01:10:31,303
To take two fine people like that...

971
01:10:31,377 --> 01:10:34,210
whose lives are wrapped up in their son
and make them unhappy?

972
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,113
- What about me being unhappy?
- You only think about yourself.

973
01:10:37,182 --> 01:10:39,707
How could you have associated
with Jeff for so long...

974
01:10:39,785 --> 01:10:41,616
and not gotten some of his fine qualities?

975
01:10:41,687 --> 01:10:45,589
- What's fine about them?
- He's kind and simple and gentle.

976
01:10:45,724 --> 01:10:48,215
You're in one
of your romantic moods again.

977
01:10:48,294 --> 01:10:50,228
That's been the trouble
since the beginning.

978
01:10:50,296 --> 01:10:53,060
And since when have you been so crazy
about the gentle act?

979
01:10:53,132 --> 01:10:56,363
Shall I recall to you how I got this?
A bed lamp.

980
01:10:56,602 --> 01:10:58,001
When you get to know Ann...

981
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:00,630
you'll find she's everything
a man wants in a wife.

982
01:11:00,706 --> 01:11:02,697
Can't you get an office
with better plumbing?

983
01:11:02,775 --> 01:11:05,938
I'm going to bring Ann up to Lake Placid
next weekend to visit you.

984
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:07,740
Maybe we're being too hasty, Ashley.

985
01:11:07,813 --> 01:11:09,781
We'll make reservations for the children.

986
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:11,543
I don't want to seem too harsh.

987
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:14,916
All right, Jefferson,
we'll try and forget all this.

988
01:11:31,236 --> 01:11:32,931
How do you do?

989
01:11:33,906 --> 01:11:37,501
- Is it too late to go skiing?
- Lf you hurry you'll get a couple of hours in.

990
01:11:37,576 --> 01:11:39,203
We'll hurry. Just make an "X," Jeff.

991
01:11:39,278 --> 01:11:42,338
Mr. Custer, I have a message for you
from your parents.

992
01:11:42,414 --> 01:11:44,405
They're on an excursion trip on the lake.

993
01:11:44,483 --> 01:11:46,644
They won't be able to get back
until tonight.

994
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,448
The snow's blocked all the roads.

995
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,714
I see.

996
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:53,620
- What floor are we on?
- Your rooms are not in the lodge.

997
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:55,287
I thought they were.

998
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:57,955
- They were changed to one of the cabins.
- That's funny.

999
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:00,294
I'm sure you'll find it very satisfactory.

1000
01:12:00,366 --> 01:12:03,392
There's more privacy,
and a great many people prefer that.

1001
01:12:03,469 --> 01:12:05,403
That'll be all right, Jeff.

1002
01:12:05,471 --> 01:12:06,699
How far is it from here?

1003
01:12:06,772 --> 01:12:10,264
It's only half a mile, and the sleigh
brings you back and forth for meals.

1004
01:12:10,342 --> 01:12:12,333
It gives you quite an appetite.

1005
01:12:13,812 --> 01:12:17,111
- They're not connecting rooms, are they?
- No, they're separate suites.

1006
01:12:17,182 --> 01:12:19,810
I guess we better stay here for lunch
before we go.

1007
01:12:19,885 --> 01:12:22,718
Yes. Boy, they'll be in Cabin McKinley.

1008
01:12:22,788 --> 01:12:26,087
- Each cabin is named after a president.
- How very patriotic.

1009
01:12:30,629 --> 01:12:32,824
Clean, cold air.

1010
01:12:33,365 --> 01:12:35,424
I love the smell of snow.

1011
01:12:36,502 --> 01:12:39,096
- No one can smell the snow.
- I can.

1012
01:12:45,144 --> 01:12:46,736
It isn't snow.

1013
01:13:02,161 --> 01:13:05,130
Those two bags go in one room,
and the rest in the other.

1014
01:13:06,331 --> 01:13:07,423
Pardon me.

1015
01:13:15,841 --> 01:13:18,036
Don't catch cold, now.

1016
01:13:20,345 --> 01:13:22,813
- There you are, boys.
- Thank you, sir.

1017
01:13:22,881 --> 01:13:26,180
Phone when you want dinner,
the sleigh will be here in a few minutes.

1018
01:13:26,251 --> 01:13:28,879
The sleigh service
is discontinued after 10:00 at night.

1019
01:13:28,954 --> 01:13:31,616
So are the telephones.
We try to make this a real retreat.

1020
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:33,214
That suits me.

1021
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:48,703
A man has no right
to ask anything more beautiful.

1022
01:13:48,941 --> 01:13:52,342
- Someone else has the other suite.
- I'm glad of that.

1023
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,810
Well, on with our skis.

1024
01:14:00,219 --> 01:14:01,709
Why, it's David.

1025
01:14:01,787 --> 01:14:03,550
What are you doing here?

1026
01:14:09,728 --> 01:14:11,889
- He's fainted.
- What happened to him?

1027
01:14:11,964 --> 01:14:15,661
- He's terribly ill.
- He's got quite an even pulse.

1028
01:14:15,734 --> 01:14:18,225
Don't let him soak here. Carry him inside.

1029
01:14:19,505 --> 01:14:20,870
Easy, Jeff.

1030
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:33,747
Ann, would you hold his arms?

1031
01:14:33,819 --> 01:14:37,084
- But you...
- No, his arms.

1032
01:14:37,289 --> 01:14:38,950
Then maybe I can do it.

1033
01:14:42,294 --> 01:14:43,955
Let me see, now.

1034
01:14:44,429 --> 01:14:46,954
Ann, you hold his legs.

1035
01:14:47,032 --> 01:14:48,727
All right.

1036
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:52,002
That's fine.

1037
01:14:54,339 --> 01:14:55,704
Too heavy for you, honey?

1038
01:14:55,774 --> 01:14:57,969
No. I guess I better go first.

1039
01:14:58,677 --> 01:15:00,076
Easy, Jeff.

1040
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,978
One step, honey.

1041
01:15:10,556 --> 01:15:12,547
Set his legs down, honey.

1042
01:15:15,961 --> 01:15:17,929
Let's rest a minute.

1043
01:15:20,566 --> 01:15:22,261
All right?

1044
01:15:26,205 --> 01:15:28,036
Now we've got him.

1045
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:34,668
Easy.

1046
01:15:34,913 --> 01:15:36,608
I better go first.

1047
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:39,409
Mind the stairs, now.

1048
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:42,579
That's fine.

1049
01:15:43,388 --> 01:15:44,377
Careful.

1050
01:15:45,724 --> 01:15:47,248
That's a girl.

1051
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,550
In here.

1052
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:54,155
Mind the chair.

1053
01:15:57,102 --> 01:15:58,501
I better go.

1054
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:05,199
Hang on. Swing. One, two, three!

1055
01:16:09,748 --> 01:16:11,306
This is his room.

1056
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,985
He doesn't seem to be breathing.

1057
01:16:17,055 --> 01:16:19,455
Don't worry, now. Control yourself.

1058
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:23,386
- He's frozen. He's blue with cold.
- He's breathing fine.

1059
01:16:23,462 --> 01:16:25,623
Maybe he ought to have a little brandy.

1060
01:16:25,697 --> 01:16:28,257
No, I'm afraid not.
I think that's what did it.

1061
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:30,392
Yes, I can see he's been at it all week.

1062
01:16:30,469 --> 01:16:34,405
- A few hours' sleep will bring him around.
- Do you really think so?

1063
01:16:34,773 --> 01:16:37,503
We better get these wet clothes off him.

1064
01:16:37,576 --> 01:16:40,841
Come on now, old man. That's fine.

1065
01:16:40,912 --> 01:16:44,370
We will go away
the first two weeks in December.

1066
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:48,812
What's he saying?

1067
01:16:49,388 --> 01:16:52,789
We were supposed to come here
the first two weeks in December.

1068
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,224
You'll be crazy about it, Ann.

1069
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,921
He must've been here the whole week,
torturing himself.

1070
01:16:58,997 --> 01:17:01,090
He shouldn't have come here.

1071
01:17:01,933 --> 01:17:04,834
Playing in the snow.
We'll have a lot of fun.

1072
01:17:04,903 --> 01:17:07,428
Let's get these wet things off him.

1073
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,231
Look out!

1074
01:17:11,243 --> 01:17:12,676
You'll fall.

1075
01:17:13,912 --> 01:17:15,846
He thinks we're skiing.

1076
01:17:22,321 --> 01:17:24,346
You're very graceful, Ann.

1077
01:17:26,591 --> 01:17:30,925
Just don't go so fast the next time.
I don't want you to hurt yourself.

1078
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:32,992
Isn't that terrible?

1079
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:38,101
Look out! Look out for that tree!

1080
01:17:44,876 --> 01:17:47,845
- You better go to your room now.
- Why? What's the matter?

1081
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:50,245
- I want to get him undressed.
- Go ahead.

1082
01:17:55,487 --> 01:17:57,250
If you need me, call me.

1083
01:17:59,157 --> 01:18:01,489
The first two weeks in December.

1084
01:18:06,064 --> 01:18:08,294
Take a little walk in the snow,
you'll feel better.

1085
01:18:08,367 --> 01:18:10,130
He'll get delirious again and want water.

1086
01:18:10,202 --> 01:18:13,194
He's sleeping like a baby.
There's nothing we can do for him now.

1087
01:18:16,675 --> 01:18:18,506
I think I'll look once more.

1088
01:18:44,603 --> 01:18:46,036
He's asleep.

1089
01:18:47,539 --> 01:18:49,734
He's trying to say something.

1090
01:18:50,942 --> 01:18:53,308
The first two weeks in December.

1091
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:56,272
What's he saying?

1092
01:18:56,348 --> 01:18:59,374
He's still at the first two weeks
in December.

1093
01:19:00,485 --> 01:19:02,385
He's opening his eyes.

1094
01:19:02,888 --> 01:19:04,321
Hello, David.

1095
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,600
Hello, Ann.

1096
01:19:18,069 --> 01:19:20,333
My, he is in bad shape.

1097
01:19:20,405 --> 01:19:24,000
Don't you remember me?
Try and think, David. This is Ann. Annie.

1098
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:28,207
This is Jeff.
Your old school chum, Jefferson.

1099
01:19:29,448 --> 01:19:32,645
I'll never forget you
in that little blue dress.

1100
01:19:33,985 --> 01:19:36,453
That's the dress I was wearing
when I first met him.

1101
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:40,082
The one I told you about, the one he tore.
He liked me in that.

1102
01:19:41,126 --> 01:19:43,253
We ought to let him rest a while.

1103
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:46,258
That isn't a rattle, is it?

1104
01:19:46,331 --> 01:19:49,391
I don't think so.
I wish I could hear it again, though.

1105
01:19:53,438 --> 01:19:55,838
No. He's just clearing his throat.

1106
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,875
- He looks awful.
- He'll look better when he gets a shave.

1107
01:19:59,945 --> 01:20:02,709
- That's what I was thinking.
- We'll send for a barber tomorrow.

1108
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:22,563
Are you expecting me to shave him?

1109
01:20:22,634 --> 01:20:23,760
No. I can do it.

1110
01:20:23,835 --> 01:20:26,702
You? That's something
only a barber can do.

1111
01:20:26,771 --> 01:20:28,432
It's difficult to shave someone else.

1112
01:20:28,507 --> 01:20:31,237
- I've always shaved him.
- You shaved him?

1113
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,557
He's going to speak.

1114
01:20:58,637 --> 01:21:01,162
That barber has just ruined his skin.

1115
01:21:02,173 --> 01:21:04,641
Boy. Boy, I want a shine.

1116
01:21:04,709 --> 01:21:07,143
He thinks he's in the barber shop.

1117
01:21:13,018 --> 01:21:14,849
Look. He's lifting his hand.

1118
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,979
He thinks he wants a manicure.

1119
01:21:17,055 --> 01:21:18,545
What shall I do?

1120
01:21:19,391 --> 01:21:21,916
Maybe we better humor him. Hold it.

1121
01:21:26,565 --> 01:21:28,226
You think we're doing the right thing?

1122
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,167
Yes. We mustn't do anything to shock him.

1123
01:21:37,509 --> 01:21:40,137
He thinks I'm a manicurist, doesn't he?

1124
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:44,080
He's squeezing my hand.

1125
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:47,175
In a few minutes,
he'll ask you for your phone number.

1126
01:21:47,252 --> 01:21:50,153
Will you get me his lotion
out of the bathroom?

1127
01:22:17,048 --> 01:22:18,345
Sit down.

1128
01:22:24,556 --> 01:22:27,423
A woman can't control herself
entirely by her head...

1129
01:22:27,492 --> 01:22:29,926
which is probably why we love you.

1130
01:22:30,128 --> 01:22:32,153
You and David have had
three years together...

1131
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:35,222
and whether you realize it or not,
there's a bond between you...

1132
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,564
and it's not easily broken.

1133
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:39,331
People get divorced.

1134
01:22:39,404 --> 01:22:43,238
It's true that I think you'll be better off
with me, but then I'm prejudiced.

1135
01:22:43,308 --> 01:22:45,208
My first wish is to see you happy.

1136
01:22:45,276 --> 01:22:47,369
And it's possible, it's more than possible...

1137
01:22:47,445 --> 01:22:51,245
that as peculiar as David is,
you still couldn't be happy without him.

1138
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:54,418
Tell you what I'd like you to do.

1139
01:22:55,887 --> 01:23:00,324
Take back your promise to marry me,
and think about it for a few days.

1140
01:23:00,859 --> 01:23:03,919
If you find you can't go on without David...

1141
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:06,690
you know I'll wish you every happiness
in the world.

1142
01:23:06,765 --> 01:23:08,062
That's very kind of you.

1143
01:23:08,133 --> 01:23:10,795
Don't you think we ought to see
how he's getting along?

1144
01:23:10,869 --> 01:23:12,166
We'll only wake him up.

1145
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,729
I'll go see if he's still asleep.
I'll look through the window.

1146
01:24:11,229 --> 01:24:14,164
I will never forget you
in that little blue dress.

1147
01:24:14,232 --> 01:24:17,326
Little blue dress!
You've been found out, you beast.

1148
01:24:17,402 --> 01:24:19,768
I should've known your being here
was too convenient.

1149
01:24:19,838 --> 01:24:20,862
Look here...

1150
01:24:20,939 --> 01:24:22,907
Big sympathy act,
pretending you're on a bat.

1151
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:25,135
- But I love you.
- Pick up and get out of here.

1152
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:28,668
I never want to see you again.
You're just making a nuisance of yourself.

1153
01:24:28,747 --> 01:24:31,614
- Get your hands off me.
- You're in love with me.

1154
01:24:31,683 --> 01:24:32,741
And I know you're crazy.

1155
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:34,341
You're mine and you belong to me.

1156
01:24:34,419 --> 01:24:37,081
You can't be with
that pile of Southern fried chicken.

1157
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:40,181
- That's what you think.
- You couldn't let him lay a hand on you.

1158
01:24:40,258 --> 01:24:42,556
Not after what we've been to each other.

1159
01:24:42,627 --> 01:24:46,085
He's going to lay a hand on me,
and we're going to get married.

1160
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:50,768
Okay. If that's the way you feel about it,
I won't stand in your way.

1161
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:53,463
I've been thrown out of my own home,
threatened by cops...

1162
01:24:53,538 --> 01:24:55,130
chased around in taxi cabs...

1163
01:24:55,206 --> 01:24:58,937
and neglected my job, because I loved you
and wanted you back again.

1164
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:01,979
Now I'm finished. It's all washed up.

1165
01:25:02,947 --> 01:25:05,074
Go ahead and marry the guy.

1166
01:25:05,817 --> 01:25:07,978
I hope you'll be very happy.

1167
01:25:14,826 --> 01:25:16,384
You heard.

1168
01:25:17,028 --> 01:25:19,656
He liked me in that little blue dress.

1169
01:25:21,099 --> 01:25:24,159
- Jeff, will you marry me?
- Why, I'd be honored.

1170
01:25:24,736 --> 01:25:26,897
Is it wise to make a decision in anger?

1171
01:25:26,971 --> 01:25:28,836
You can be considerate of him even now?

1172
01:25:28,907 --> 01:25:32,206
- Your happiness is my only concern.
- I'm not good enough for you.

1173
01:25:32,277 --> 01:25:35,644
Why, you're making me
the happiest man in the world.

1174
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,947
I know what you'd like. Some nice dinner.

1175
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:42,050
How about some nice
Southern fried chicken?

1176
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,324
Hello? Is that the porter?

1177
01:25:48,293 --> 01:25:51,126
What's the first train
I can get back to New York?

1178
01:25:51,262 --> 01:25:52,593
10:30?

1179
01:25:53,531 --> 01:25:57,467
All right. Have a sleigh up here
half an hour before, will you?

1180
01:26:07,478 --> 01:26:09,343
It was a very nice dinner, wasn't it?

1181
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:11,382
I wasn't very hungry.

1182
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:15,780
Hope he has the decency to leave tonight.

1183
01:26:15,854 --> 01:26:19,187
Who, David? He won't stay around
where he's not wanted.

1184
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:22,385
I bet you he'll be gone
by the time we get back.

1185
01:26:23,494 --> 01:26:25,519
You know the real reason
he keeps chasing me?

1186
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:27,121
He's still so much in love with me.

1187
01:26:27,198 --> 01:26:30,429
He's such an egotist that he can't bear
letting someone else kiss me.

1188
01:26:30,501 --> 01:26:34,767
- He doesn't believe I'll marry you.
- He'll have to, after we're married.

1189
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:44,915
It's getting colder.
Could you tell the driver to go faster?

1190
01:26:44,983 --> 01:26:47,952
Driver, go straight to Cabin McKinley...

1191
01:26:48,019 --> 01:26:50,419
and take the shortcut, if there is one.

1192
01:26:53,258 --> 01:26:56,625
- You know, I'm worried about him.
- Who?

1193
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:58,223
David, yes.

1194
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,230
He may have been
putting on an act today...

1195
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:02,289
but he'll really take to drinking
from now on.

1196
01:27:02,367 --> 01:27:05,768
I don't think so.
He'll probably find someone else.

1197
01:27:05,837 --> 01:27:08,897
David's the type
that always gets married again.

1198
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:12,634
I'm so afraid he'll ruin his life
on account of me...

1199
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:14,507
spoil a brilliant future.

1200
01:27:14,579 --> 01:27:18,606
He is brilliant, you know.
If I could only make him...

1201
01:27:18,683 --> 01:27:23,245
I mean, if I could only disillusion him,
make him hate me, do something.

1202
01:27:23,454 --> 01:27:27,515
If he'd only hate me, that would be
the solution. Listen, it would work, too.

1203
01:27:27,592 --> 01:27:31,153
Those walls are paper-thin,
and he could hear everything.

1204
01:27:31,629 --> 01:27:35,929
- Why, what are you suggesting?
- It's a wonderful idea.

1205
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,299
- Hurry, driver, hurry.
- Yes, ma'am. Giddyup.

1206
01:27:49,614 --> 01:27:51,343
Good night.

1207
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,312
It's a wonderful thing you're doing.

1208
01:27:55,386 --> 01:27:57,911
He'd be on my conscience otherwise.

1209
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:10,692
Come on in, Jeff.

1210
01:28:15,406 --> 01:28:16,930
It's early yet.

1211
01:28:31,322 --> 01:28:33,085
Put me down.

1212
01:28:33,424 --> 01:28:35,449
Put me down this instant.

1213
01:28:38,896 --> 01:28:40,557
Now, Jeff...

1214
01:28:44,268 --> 01:28:48,329
Now, you know I've had enough to drink,
Jeff, and so have you.

1215
01:28:55,947 --> 01:28:57,676
Jeff, are you hurt?

1216
01:28:58,649 --> 01:29:01,846
Don't talk so loud. Let me help you up.

1217
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:08,282
My, aren't you strong?

1218
01:29:20,505 --> 01:29:23,133
My, what a heavy shoe it is.

1219
01:29:32,216 --> 01:29:33,205
No.

1220
01:29:36,054 --> 01:29:37,783
What are you doing?

1221
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:46,027
Unless you stop, Jeff,
I'll have to ask you to leave.

1222
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:48,164
Jeff, behave yourself.

1223
01:29:59,911 --> 01:30:01,538
You haven't even got any pride.

1224
01:30:01,612 --> 01:30:04,945
I only did this for you, so you'd realize
it was all over between us.

1225
01:30:05,016 --> 01:30:06,779
There's only one way to handle you.

1226
01:30:06,851 --> 01:30:08,910
Let go of me.

1227
01:30:11,389 --> 01:30:15,655
Let go. Jeff, I'm not acting.
This is real. Come in, Jeff.

1228
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:24,464
Hit him, Jeff.

1229
01:30:25,103 --> 01:30:28,300
- I don't need it.
- Do you want to make anything out of it?

1230
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:35,168
- I forgive you, David.
- You mean you're not gonna hit him?

1231
01:30:36,581 --> 01:30:39,914
Ann, you're so attractive
that I take it for granted that other men...

1232
01:30:39,984 --> 01:30:42,475
less disciplined,
will always take liberties with you.

1233
01:30:42,553 --> 01:30:44,418
Violence shows a lack of character.

1234
01:30:44,489 --> 01:30:46,081
You won't do anything to him?

1235
01:30:46,157 --> 01:30:48,557
Would you respect me more
if I knocked him down?

1236
01:30:48,626 --> 01:30:52,062
Would I? You big blubber,
what kind of a man are you?

1237
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:54,496
How could you love a woman
and let someone paw her?

1238
01:30:54,565 --> 01:30:57,227
Now, let's not say anything in anger
we'll be sorry for.

1239
01:30:57,301 --> 01:30:58,825
Haven't you any self-respect?

1240
01:30:58,903 --> 01:31:01,463
- Surprise.
- Isn't it wonderful up here?

1241
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:03,734
Are you children having a good time?

1242
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:06,106
Do you realize you're raising your voice?

1243
01:31:06,177 --> 01:31:08,577
- Raising her voice?
- Certainly I'm raising my voice.

1244
01:31:08,646 --> 01:31:12,047
I never saw you act like this before.
I always thought you were gentle.

1245
01:31:12,116 --> 01:31:14,710
Very gentle. How do you think I got this?

1246
01:31:14,785 --> 01:31:18,744
Jefferson, I forbid you
to marry this woman.

1247
01:31:18,823 --> 01:31:20,916
You forbid him to marry me?

1248
01:31:21,325 --> 01:31:23,054
Listen to me, you stuffed shirt.

1249
01:31:23,127 --> 01:31:25,755
Even a mouse has enough backbone
to fight sometime.

1250
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:28,993
Taking your hat off on that elevator
doesn't make a man out of you.

1251
01:31:29,066 --> 01:31:32,900
You can teach a monkey to do that,
and I'll take a monkey anytime...

1252
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:35,029
whether he's a dipsomaniac
or beats his wife...

1253
01:31:35,106 --> 01:31:37,131
over a lump of jelly like you.

1254
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:38,800
But I'm not taking you.

1255
01:31:38,876 --> 01:31:41,208
Go out and get a Girl Guide
and go camping together.

1256
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:44,271
Let me out of here
before I forget I'm a lady.

1257
01:31:54,292 --> 01:31:57,591
You have just seen her
in one of her quieter moods.

1258
01:32:21,185 --> 01:32:22,618
What are you doing?

1259
01:32:22,687 --> 01:32:25,622
The telephone is disconnected,
and there's no transportation...

1260
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:27,658
and I'm gonna spend the evening
at the lodge.

1261
01:32:27,725 --> 01:32:31,354
But that's ridiculous.
Why don't you spend the night here?

1262
01:32:31,429 --> 01:32:33,090
Not on your life.

1263
01:32:34,198 --> 01:32:36,894
How are you gonna get there?
You can't ski.

1264
01:32:37,001 --> 01:32:39,561
If necessary, on my hands and knees.

1265
01:32:40,371 --> 01:32:43,272
You're not doing me any favor
by staying here.

1266
01:32:43,341 --> 01:32:46,868
- I'd just as soon you get out.
- We see eye to eye.

1267
01:32:48,012 --> 01:32:50,310
In fact, I'll help you get out.

1268
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:00,284
Sorry.

1269
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:03,657
Thank you.

1270
01:33:17,942 --> 01:33:20,968
I'm warning you, I'll kill you in cold blood.

1271
01:33:21,746 --> 01:33:25,443
Sometime, someday,
when your back is turned, I'll stab you.

1272
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:28,480
I'm telling you, don't you try anything.

1273
01:33:30,421 --> 01:33:32,685
David, get me out of these things.

1274
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:35,386
Get me out of here!

1275
01:33:49,407 --> 01:33:53,673
David, get me out of these,
or I'll break every bone in your body!

1276
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:55,594
English
