Hey, Andy!
What`s up, dude'

Hey, Joe. Hey, Sara.
How you doing'

00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,346
When you going to
get a car'

00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,618
Hey, why don`t you
get a car'
I can`t afford it.

We on'
See you then.

00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,027
I`ll bring a soda.
Hey, enjoy your orange.

12
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,089
okay, take care.
See you. Bye-bye.

Tell me something

Good morning, Paula.
Andy.

22
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,349
Excuse me.
I have a question.

23
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:13,791
What is the difference between
Hi8 and Digital video tapes'

24
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,457
I`m not a salesman,
so, I could probably--

25
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,225
Welcome to Smart Tech.
How can I be of service
to you'

26
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,866
Well, I was just
wondering...

27
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,459
what is the difference
between these'

28
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,205
(Jay)
Well, if l`m photographing
someone as fine as yourself...

29
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,036
I`d probably go Digital.

30

/`ve been /ied to!!

31
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,157
My God.
Sorry l`m late, man.
No problem.

32
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,523
oh, man.

33
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,595
I had a weekend.
Yeah'

34
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,024
We went to Tijuana, Mexico,
you know...

35
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,035
and we thought
it would be fun, you know,
to go to this show.

36
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,435
Everyone`s, ``You gotta
check out one of these shows.``

37
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,030
And, you know,
it`s a woman fucking a horse.

38
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,573
We get there,
and, you know, we think
it`s gonna be awesome...

39
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:09,046
and it is not as cool
as it sounds like
it would be, man.

40
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,610
It`s kind of gross.
Yeah.

41
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,345
You think,
``A woman fucking a horse``...

42
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,011
and you get there
and it`s...

43
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,953
a woman fucking a horse.
Yeah.

44
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,014
It was really
giving it to her.

45
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,451
And you know what...

46
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,154
to be honest, I felt
bad for her. We all
just felt bad for her.

47
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,890
Yeah.
Kind of felt bad
for the horse.

48
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,195
Wow, that`s something.
So what did you get up to'

49
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,300
You know, I just kind
of hung out. I was....

50
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,270
God, Friday,
when I went home...

51
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,638
I really wanted
an egg-salad sandwich.

52
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,700
And I was just obsessing
about it and I was like:.

53
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,769
``Man, l`m gonna
make one of those.``

54
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,339
So Saturday I went out
and I got, like,
a dozen eggs...

55
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,011
and I boiled them all
and then I just...

56
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:50,055
I spent, I don`t know,
probably three hours...

57
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,719
Iike, three-and-a-half hours
making...

58
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,854
you know, the mayonnaise
and the onions and paprika...

59
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,989
and, you know,
all the accoutrement.

60
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,533
And then, by the time
I was done...

61
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,193
I just really didn`t feel
like eating it.

62
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,829
I can imagine.
And I didn`t have any bread.

63
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,738
So, you know,
it was pretty good.
It was a good weekend.

64
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,871
Sounds pretty awesome.
Yeah, it was fine.

65
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,344
Sounds really fun.

66
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,872
Cool.
Cool.

67
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,348
Cool, cool.

68
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,045
Hey, Paula.
Yeah.

69
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,613
I gotta tell you something.
I`m really excited about it.

70
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,093
For the first time today,
I woke up...

71
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,488
I came to the store,
and I feel confident
to say to you...

72
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,191
that if you don`t take
this Michael McDonald DVD...

73
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,635
that you`ve been playing
for two years straight, off...

74
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,400
I`m going to kill everyone
in the store...

75
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,338
and put a bullet
in my brain.

76
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,143
David, what do you suggest
we play'
I don`t care. Anything.

77
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,212
I would rather watch
Beautician and the Beast.

78
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,842
I would rather listen
to Fran Drescher
for eight hours...

79
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,715
than have to listen
to Michael McDonald.

80
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:57,017
Nothing against him,
but if I hear Yah Mo B There
one more time...

81
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,524
I`m gonna yah mo
burn this place
to the ground.

82
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,493
You`re such a smart ass.
Get back on the floor.

83
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,959
[garbled]
Fuck you.

84
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,123
[clears throat]

85
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,961
This is a great TV.
Nothing beats a plasma.

86
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,628
What are you doing'
That`s my customer.

87
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,901
It certainly is not.
When I came upon her,
she was unattended.

88
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,635
No, that`s my--
Wait.

89
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,768
Go to the checkout there.
Pick up there, please.

90
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,642
She was unattended
because I went to the back...

91
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,510
to get the brochure
that she requested.

92
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,072
I apologize,
but it`s too late.

93
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,674
The transaction
has been completed.

94
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,481
Then you`re gonna give me
half the commission.

95
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,020
You`ll receive
none of the commission.

96
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,555
I need to talk to Paula.
This is crazy.

97
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:31,647
This is bullshit.

98
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,589
Every time I make a sale,
you go crying to Paula.

99
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,958
How about Jesse Jackson'
old Jesse needs a cause.

100
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,587
Sick of you poaching
my customers.

101
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,154
I`m sick of your
crybaby bullshit.

102
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,225
You wanna take this
shit outside' Just take it
outside and squash it'

103
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,567
Let`s stay inside,
so everybody can see
what a pussy you have, okay'

104
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,097
Because when I remove
the blade I keep in my boot
from its sheath...

105
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,009
I can`t return it
until it has spilled blood.

106
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,344
Look, listen to me.
You are fucking
with the wrong nigger.

107
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,350
Hey! You`re fucking with
the wrong sun-nigger, okay'

108
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,911
Dude, I will hang your old ass
by your turban.

109
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,181
Turban now' Do you see
any fucking turban here'

110
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,920
Do I talk like a turban guy'

111
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,895
Do I say, ``Hey, Jay,
do you want a Slurpee'
You want a Slurpee'``

112
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:14,194
Fuck you, okay'
I was born in Brooklyn.

113
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,325
Brooklyn, okay'

114
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,996
My accent is a fucking
Brooklyn accent, okay' okay'

115
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,402
All right, man.
Calm down, dude.

116
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,634
Look, you still covering
my shift on Friday or what'

117
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,643
If I can keep this commission,
with pleasure.

118
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,578
Cool, then. All right, pop.
No problem.

119
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,178
How about Andy'
No.

120
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,111
Come on, man.
We need, what,
five guys...

121
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,712
to play a decent
poker game, right'
Yeah.

122
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,347
If we cancel this,
l`m gonna have to go...

123
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,358
to some stupid-ass
birthday party with Jill...

124
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,688
and that shit
ain`t happening.

125
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,228
No.
(David)
Why not'

126
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,123
He`s a really nice guy and all
but l`m pretty sure that...

127
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,565
he is a serial murderer.

128
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,363
Who cares, man'
He`s a nice guy.

129
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,734
I just wanna get drunk,
fucked up,
and play some cards.

130
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,932
That`s great.
Look, I don`t wanna
end up a lampshade...

131
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,032
in some creepy apartment,
that`s what l`m saying.

132
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,134
I don`t really see
any other options.

133
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,772
Andy. My man.

134
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,613
You got any plans
later on tonight'

135
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,914
Why, do we have to unload
the Sony truck'

136
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,080
No, the guys
are getting together,
we`re playing some poker...

137
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,147
thought, you know,
you`d wanna play.

138
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,687
With you guys'

139
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,762
Yeah, sure.
That would be cool.

140
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,228
You know how to play, right'
Yeah, I play online sometimes.

141
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,598
We`re gonna play
in the store.
Great.

142
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,293
Are we allowed
to do that'

143
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,998
Absolutely not.
Yeah.

144
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,195
oh.

145
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,375
Well, so l`m gonna
go tell Paula.

146
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,044
I`m just kidding.

147
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,240
I`m kidding.
That sounds great. Cool,
l`ll see you guys tonight.

148
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,339
okay.
All right.

149
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,077
[clattering]
oops.

150
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,045
I almost feel guilty.
No, you don`t.

151
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,869
Going down!

152
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,302
Going down!

153
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,602
Dumbass.

154
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,943
And a full house.

155
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,743
oh, my dukes!
What'

156
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,245
How much fucking online poker
do you play, dawg'

157
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,341
For like an hour or two
a night, when l`m not
playing Halo.

158
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,320
Why did you invite this guy'
He`s a fucking ringer, man.

159
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,582
This is hog shit.

160
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,851
You, you`re a fucking asshole
to tell me to come here.

161
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,756
You tell me he was a nice guy,
didn`t you'

162
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,158
Well, fuck you people,
and fuck you, you and you...

163
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,221
fuck and kiss my big brown
fucking ass, okay'

164
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,664
(Jay)
l`m gonna see you tomorrow.

165
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,791
Peace.
All right, man.

166
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,062
(Mooj)
Fuck a goat.

167
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,364
[all laughing]

168
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,268
Good night.
I love that guy.

169
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,274
Dude, you totally....
oh, shit, I gotta go. Damn.

170
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,003
About to go see Ellen
in a little bit.

171
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,544
Going now'
Late-night action, huh'

172
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,704
Dude, you know
how it goes.

173
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,271
Does your girlfriend know
about all these
late-night visits'

174
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,907
It`s like an unspoken
agreement. Yeah.

175
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:48,044
It`s like a completely
and utterly unspoken
agreement.

176
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,281
If you knew her, if you knew
who I was dealing with...

177
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,584
you wouldn`t be
saying this shit.

178
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,557
There`s nothing you can`t do
with this woman...

179
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,719
straight up and down.
I`ve done
every single thing...

180
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,695
I could possibly create.
I`ve literally lubed up...

181
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,129
and made love to the arches
of her feet. All right.

182
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,291
Wow!
(Jay)
Yeah.

183
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,028
Foot fuck!
That`s sick, man.

184
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,626
Wow.
That is not sick.

185
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,971
I will give you sick.
oh, shit.

186
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,837
I was sleeping with a woman
recently, she had the....

187
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:13,208
Her tits were unbelievable.
oh, man, I love titties.

188
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,373
And so we`re doing it
and l`m about to finish...

189
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,474
and her dog starts
licking my ass.

190
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,885
I swear to God, I have
to decide, do I finish
or do I stop the dog'

191
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,855
I know your nasty ass.
He finished.

192
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,290
I finished.
And then I stole the dog.

193
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,222
No, I didn`t, but....

194
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,964
You know, sometimes,
Amy and I would make love...

195
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,159
till it was almost like
we weren`t two people...

196
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,896
but we were two spirits
or something.

197
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,167
our souls were
connected in this way,
I can`t describe it.

198
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,835
Time stood still.
It was like we were
sharing the same heart.

199
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,710
Stop, man! Why do you
always come and kill the vibe
with those things'

200
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,749
``Sharing the same heart,``
that`s like some...

201
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,942
Britney Spears shit, man.

202
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,010
This is three grown ass men,
don`t nobody want to hear
that shit.

203
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,351
Yeah, man, come on,
nobody wants to
hear that shit.

204
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,983
Thank you, Andy.
Dude, you broke up
two years ago.

205
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,493
You get over it
at some point.
Two years, man.

206
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,119
You need to get past that...

207
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,427
because no ass
is worth thinking
that much about...

208
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,995
I always say.

209
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,701
Andy, do me a favor.

210
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,171
Would you please help him
redeem himself by telling
a real sex story'

211
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,229
Yes.

212
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,943
I don`t.... You know what,
l`m a gentleman
and I don`t....

213
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,810
I don`t kiss and tell.

214
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,214
Fuck it, I raise you.
Nastiest shit
you`ve ever done.

215
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,179
I`m talking about nasty.

216
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,445
Wow.

217
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,614
So many stories
are running through
my head right now.

218
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,184
I dated this girl...

219
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:40,357
for a while, and she was
really a nasty freak.

220
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:45,302
She just loved to get down
with sex all the time.

221
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,931
She was like, any time of day,
she was like:.

222
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,737
``Yeah, let`s go.
I`m so nasty.``

223
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,140
And l`d be nailing her.

224
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,439
oh, shit.
She`d be like:.

225
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,878
``oh, you`re nailing me. Cool.``

226
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,551
She talk dirty to you'
She loved to dirty-talk.

227
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,449
Totally into it.
She`d be like:.

228
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:07,481
``Yeah, let`s screw, let`s....
I wanna fuck.``

229
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,121
God, it was so dirty.

230
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:14,692
She`d be like, ``Me so horny,
me love you long time.``

231
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:15,991
So....

232
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,969
(Jay)
So what were the titties like'
Yeah, describe her....

233
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,131
Yeah, she had great tits.

234
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,401
No, I mean, like, detailed.
Did she have, like,
you know...

235
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,274
them little pink
teeny nipples.
oh, yeah.

236
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,836
(Jay)
or like the long
Nationa/ Geographic nipples.

237
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,474
You have like
the bumpy Braille nipples,
the Stevie Wonders.

238
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,915
(Andy)
Yeah, they were nice.

239
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:36,216
You know, when you, like,
you grab a woman`s breast
and it`s....

240
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,750
And you feel it and...

241
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:43,517
it feels like a bag of sand
when you`re touching it.

242
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,196
Bag of sand'

243
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,459
You know what I mean.
Why don`t we just play'

244
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,197
Why don`t you just
deal the cards'

245
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,898
What are you
talking about'

246
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,032
Have you ever felt
a breast before, man'

247
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,097
Yes.

248
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,736
Dude, are you gay'
No, l`m not gay.

249
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,439
I`ve been with
tons of women.

250
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,539
I touched a guy`s balls
at Hebrew school once.

251
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,584
Dude, it`s not a big deal.
You like to fuck guys.

252
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,279
I`m cool. I got friends
who fuck guys, in jail.

253
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,715
No, l`m not gay.

254
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,781
No, l`ve borked a lot of women
in my day.

255
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:13,984
You`ve ``borked``'

256
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:17,024
Hold up.
Yo, answer this question:

257
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,428
Are you a virgin'

258
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,365
Are you a virgin'

259
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,799
Yeah, not since I was 10.

260
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,430
It all makes sense.
You`re a virgin.

261
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,031
I am.... Shut up.
How does that happen'

262
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,542
He`s a fucking virgin.

263
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,909
I knew it. That makes
so much sense, man.
Look, he`s a virgin.

264
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,278
You guys are hilarious.
All right, come on,
don`t be mean.

265
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,442
I`m not being mean.
I`m trying to
help the partner out.

266
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,247
I`m trying to say
I wanna get you laid, dude.

267
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,514
I understand
what`s going on.

268
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,421
You guys are so up your asses.

269
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:49,025
From now on,
your dick is my dick.
I`m getting you some pussy.

270
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,993
[men laughing]

271
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:03,908
A bag of sand! Come on, man!
You could do better than that.

272
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,801
God, me so horny'
Me so stupid!

273
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,274
[yelling]

274
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,410
oh, come on.

275
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,381
[laughing]

276
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,182
It`s gonna be fine.
They don`t even remember.

277
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,023
Those guys are cool.

278
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,465
[alarm buzzing]

279
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,327
This is gonna be bad.

280
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,131
(Andy)
Yeah, well,
virgin`s not a dirty word.

281
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,232
You know what`s a dirty word,
is asshole...

282
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,799
and that`s what you guys are.

283
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,109
You know,
I may not have had sex,
but I could fuck you up.

284
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,344
Yeah.

285
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,017
Come on.

286
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,857
Hey, David.
Hey, Andy.

287
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,091
What`s up'
Cal, good morning.

288
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,163
(Haziz)
Hey, Andy.
Hey.

289
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,175
We`re gonna have to get you
some punani.

290
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,642
[both guffawing]

291
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,113
Andy, it`s going down,
partner. We`re gonna be....

292
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,479
[moaning]

293
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,749
This for you, partner,
this for you.

294
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,789
Waves of them coming at you
on Friday, Saturday.

295
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,451
By Sunday,
your nuts gonna be drained.

296
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:31,155
Hey, Andy, don`t let him
bother you. It`s okay
not to have sex.

297
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,664
Not everybody
is a pussy magnet.

298
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:37,668
What are you' 25'
l`m 40.

299
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,464
Holy shit, man.
You`ve got to get on that.

300
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,871
Life isn`t about sex.
Life is about children
and passion.

301
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,266
Yeah.

302
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,438
And spirit.
Yeah, life`s about passion.

303
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,074
It`s not about fucking
and balls and pussy.

304
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,449
It`s about love.

happened yet.

didn`t happen...

I went out with this girl
for four months...

a bunch of times...

and then they move

You ain`t got to think
on this one.

461
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,754

is use your instinct.

one time, all right'

All you doing
is using your instinct.
That`s it.

469

That`s how a tiger know
he got to tackle a gazelle.

470
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,443
There`s a code
written in his DNA.

471
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,206
It says,
``Tackle the gazelle.``
okay.

472
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,443
And believe it or not,
in every man, there`s
a code written that says:

473
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,450
``Tackle drunk bitches.``
No.

474

You know what,
I don`t feel comfortable...

First of all,

some kind of bad thing.

479
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,498
I didn`t use bitches
in a derogatory sense.
You did.

480
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,262
It just does....
This doesn`t feel right.

481
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,202
of course it don`t feel right.
What has felt right for you
didn`t work.

482
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,865
You need to try
some wrong, dawg.

483

okay, how do I tell
which ones are drunk'

Now you`re talking.
All right, check this out.

over here'

With the big old titties.
I`m not gonna
stare at a woman.

487
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,346
Dawg, l`m not telling you
to stare at nobody.

488
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,253
I`m telling you to use
your peripherals.
Now look at me.

489
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,792
See. Look. See'
Yeah.

You see, over by the post.

It looks like a....

It`s either a ficus....

501

It might be
a rubber tree plant.

502
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,729
All right, if you`re
making a joke, dawg,
it`s not funny.

503
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,392
I see a blonde
and she`s very pretty.

504

Better, okay. All right.

Now with your peripherals...
Yeah.

506
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,540
...you got to scope out
a hot, drunk chick.

507
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,039
And then you should
make your move.

508
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,941
okay' All right.
Yes.

509
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,943
And remember, it`s
more important that she`s
drunk than she`s hot.

00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,482
For this first one.
Go get her.

525
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,956
I met a girl and she`s here
with a bachelorette party...

to party with them.

I am in a bad mood.
okay.

617
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,653
I`m so tired.

618
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,789
Hey, whoa!

619
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,848
[glass shattering]

620
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,360
oh, God! Turn away!

621
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,857
Hey, get off the wheel.

622
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:11,160
You`re not gonna
get in my pants
acting like that.

623
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,794
I`m starving.

624
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,562
Let`s get some
fucking French toast.

625
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,335
[tires screeching]

626
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:21,271
okay, here we are.
oh, God, we made it.

627
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,711
Home sweet home.

628
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,676
oh, mommy!

629
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,739
[screeching]

630
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,481
[panting]

631
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:33,354
Are you okay'
The fucker came
out of nowhere.

632
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,125
okay. We`re okay.

633
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,490
[laughing]

634
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:40,286
[crying]

635
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,696
Are you okay'

636
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,494
Well, are you....
What`s the matter'

637
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,195
[gasps]

638
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,436
I`m sorry.

639
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,468
That`s okay.
I think I kind of
had that coming.

640
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,408
I`ll still have sex with you
if you want.

641
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:01,509
You know what, I think
l`m gonna pass on the sex,
if you don`t mind.

642
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,077
At least I don`t have
to work out tomorrow.

643
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,722
Did you have
a daiquiri tonight'
Yeah.

644
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:07,849
I thought you might.

645
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,791
It was a very bad night.

646
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:10,850
[all laughing]

647
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:12,788
Yeah, laugh.

648
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,196
You know what,
you guys wouldn`t be
laughing right now...

649
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,758
if some girl had just
vomited shellfish sandwich
into your mouth.

650
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,894
[grunts]

651
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,836
You know what, you`re right,
it`s my bad.

652
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,897
Let me apologize to you
first of all...

653
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:27,809
for not mentioning in detail
that when you pick up
a drunk woman...

654
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,541
who`s falling down
on her way out of the bar...

655
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,448
that you should
probably drive.
I drive a bike.

656
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:37,079
okay,
Mr. Schwinn-fucking-Armstrong,
who asked you to drive a bike'

657
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,316
You know what,
l`m not the only person
in the world...

658
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,550
who rides a bike.

659
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,321
Yeah, everyone rides a bike,
when they`re fucking six.

660
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,521
Why don`t you kiss something'

661
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,724
Because this is over,
you guys, okay'

662
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,461
Can I just interject
for a second'

663
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,934
[stuttering]
Let me just say...

664
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,402
you`re putting the pussy up
on this pedestal.

665
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,996
You`re just building
the pussy up, man.

666
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,473
What are you even
talking about'

667
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,510
``Building the pussy up,``
what does that mean'

668
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:04,276
You making the pussy into
this great big Greek goddess
named Pussalia...

669
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,543
and what you`re doing is...

670
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:08,915
you`re psyching yourself
into thinking
it`s some impossible feat.

671
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,352
Yeah, I think
you`re right.

672
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,389
I`m putting the pussy up
on a pedestal.

673
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,856
Right.
That`s it.

674
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,855
It`s ``Pussalia,`` right'

675
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,395
Look where you going.
I don`t wanna say
the word anymore.

676
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,727
Say what word'
``Pussy.`` I don`t wanna say it.

677
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,062
Fuck it.
``Pussy`` is a scientific word.

678
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,260
Dude! New pants, man.

679
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:26,792
You know what, Dave'

680
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,431
You know, you said
there wasn`t gonna be
any pressure at all.

681
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,134
(David)
l`m not pressuring you.
Excuse me.

682
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,836
Can one of you guys
help me, please'

683
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,468
No hab/o English, lady.

684
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,178
I actually am helping
a customer right now.

685
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,615
okay, well--
l`m on break.

686
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,245
But our stock supervisor
is very knowledgeable.

687
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,812
He can answer
all of your questions
and he`d love to help you.

688
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,948
Thank you.

689
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,583
Have a nice day.
You, too.

690
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:53,760
Great, okay. Hi, l`m Trish.
Hi, Andy is my name.

691
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,459
This one looks pretty good.
You don`t wanna buy that VCR.

692
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,524
I don`t'

693
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,400
No, actually to be
totally honest with you...

694
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,802
you don`t wanna buy
any VCR.

695
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,568
It`s a dead technology.

696
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:07,771
It`s like getting
an eight-track player.

697
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,245
Yeah.
or a Betamax.

698
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,373
You know what, actually
l`d recommend this one.

699
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,576
This is a dual.

700
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,711
You`ve got the VCR
and DVD combo.

701
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:20,315
So, you know,
that technology would be
probably pretty good for--

702
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:21,717
Six months or so'
Yeah.

703
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,090
That`s good.

704
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,161
At best. Sorry.

705
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,662
No.
As good as it gets.

706
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:28,993
okay, that sounds good,
then.

707
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,159
okay, all right.

708
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,258
[Cal speaking Spanish]

709
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:32,393
It`s perfect.
Sorry.

710
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,732
Coming through.

711
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,164
okay.

712
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,969
God, you know,
it`s so funny, I work
right across the street...

713
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,475
and l`ve never been
in this place.

714
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:40,977
Really' Where at'
Yeah.

715
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,673
The
``We Sell Your Stuff on eBay``
store.

716
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,177
Yes.
And that`s the name'

717
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,783
Yeah, I was
looking for something...

718
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,820
you know, obvious.
So I chose that.

719
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,084
I don`t understand.
So, what, you do what'

720
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,427
Well, I take the stuff
that you don`t want...

721
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,587
and then I ``sell`` it
on eBay.

722
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,154
But you don`t actually
sell anything in the store'

723
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,691
No. I don`t.

724
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,528
So why do you have a store'

725
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,901
I don`t know.

726
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:11,237
No, I think it`s because,
you know, I wanna maybe
look professional...

727
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,278
and not like a crazy person
who`s just gonna
steal all your shit.

728
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,711
Sure. I didn`t
mean anything by that.

729
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,248
No, it`s okay.

730
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:22,113
You know what,
you should come by sometime
if you want, you know...

731
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,983
see it for yourself,
check it out.

732
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,613
I`ll check out
your empty store.

733
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,921
Yeah, it`s the one
across the street
that`s not empty.

734
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,751
Here`s my number. So....

735
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,764
All right.
So, just anytime.

736
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,300
Why do I need your number
if you`re across the street,
though'

737
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,562
I don`t really have
a good answer for that, Andy.
I just....

738
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,608
Sorry.
Just giving it to you.

739
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,936
So l`ll write you up,
and l`ll meet you over
at the register.

740
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,673
okay.
And check you out....
Check out.

741
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,078
okay, see you over there.
okay.

742
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,138
okay.

743
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,609
Awful chatty.
Hey....

744
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,180
Look, I think she gave me
her number.

745
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,780
She wrote down her number,
but I think she gave me
her number.

746
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,222
No, she gave you.
Dude, man.

747
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,884
See, you still mad at me'

748
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,825
No, I was never.
Right, you see what I mean'

749
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,796
Yeah, we gonna
celebrate it, man. Yeah.

750
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,297
This is pretty cool.
Yeah.

751
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,300
Unbelievable.
Come on,
give him some credit, man.

752
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,562
The man pulled a number.

753
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,196
It`s just.... I was in....
I can`t believe that happened.

754
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,739
What you did
with you`s own hand.

755
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,967
Man, she just gave me
her number.

756
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:22,772
That`s great, man.
I`m telling you,
love is a mysterious fig.

757
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,871
It is.

758
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,712
okay, here`s a question.
When should I call her'

759
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,580
You like her'
Yeah.

760
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,120
You definitely
don`t want to call her.

761
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,815
When is the next olympics'

762
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,254
(Jay)
So what you just
got to do is...

763
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,053
just get you a bunch
of these hood rats...

764
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,559
run through them,
just knock them out.

765
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:37,685
Boom, boom, boom.

766
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:40,322
And once you`ve done
slayed like 20,
30 of them hood rats...

767
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:43,128
now you ready to go up
to the upper echelon type ho.

768
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,328
You know what I mean'
l`m not a big ho runner.

769
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,200
My uncle used to drive

Screw these analogies.
What he`s saying is...

771
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,232
you are going to be so bad
at sex the first time...

772
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,243
you don`t want to have sex
with someone you like...

773
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,745
`cause they`ll think
you`re a weirdo for being
so lame at it.

You want to have sex
with hood rats first...

you get to the girl
you do like...

776
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,542
you`re not terrible at sex,
you`ll be mediocre at it.

777
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,355
Probably still
pretty bad, though.

Let`s put it up for my man

I`ve got a mental block
about it.

I don`t want to be in here.
It`s a soundproof room.

Yo, is Paula back'
No. She`s not here.

This is hard to talk about.

Yeah.
I think you`re
a good-looking cat.

I don`t think
that anybody knows it...

anybody can see it.

928
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,418
I`m not joking.

929
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,787
Hey!
Sorry. Shoot. Sorry, sorry.

930
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,189
Don`t worry. There`s a lot of
padding in these.

931
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,625
I could hurl it
off the balcony,
it would be fine.

932
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,424
Yeah. It will be fine.
We couldn`t break this...

933
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,555
if we tried.
No problem.

934
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,724
Look, you shouldn`t listen
to Dave and Jay, okay'

935
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,894
Those guys are crazy.
You should listen to me, okay'

936
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,939
Look, there is a hot-ass girl
who works right there.

937
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,339
There she is,
in the bookstore.
You should ask her out, man.

938
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,142
Something wrong
with her underpants.

939
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:44,714
(Cal)
Yeah, they`re not in my mouth.

940
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,750
You know, I kind of...

941
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,180
Iike the woman
from the eBay store.

942
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,378
That`s great, but...

943
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,752
you`re not gonna
get with anyone...

944
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,450
unless you play
the odds on this, man.

945
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,425
You need to plant
a lot of seeds.

946
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,985
It`s like this.
When I was growing pot,
I realized...

947
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,625
that the more seeds
I planted...
Thank you.

948
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:06,032
...the more pot
I could ultimately smoke.

949
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:09,334
I think I have all the advice
that I can handle right now.

950
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,498
Don`t get bitter.

951
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:13,441
I`m not bitter.
I almost lost a nipple, okay'

952
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,307
That was Jay`s idea, okay'

953
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,973
And I wasn`t going to
say anything,
but waxing your chest is...

954
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,539
Iike the gayest thing
you could possibly do, okay'

955
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:24,348
Look at me.
Looks are not important.
Really look at me.

956
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,390
I am ugly as fuck
by traditional standards...

957
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,892
but I get with women.

958
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,087
Aren`t you curious
as to how that`s possible'

959
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,392
I am not ugly as fuck.

960
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,296
I didn`t say you were
ugly as--

961
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,833
Well, you implied it.
okay.

962
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,495
It doesn`t matter if
you`re ugly as fuck
or you`re ugly as shit.

963
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,665
It`s about talking to women,
and I know how to do that...

964
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,108
because I observe,
because I am a novelist.

965
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,678
What' You never
told me that before.

966
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,545
That`s because I am not
an arrogant prick, Andy.

967
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,049
okay' The problem
most men have is...

968
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:56,875
they don`t know
how to talk to women.

969
00:45:56,954 --> 00:46:00,651
You know what my problem is'
I am not interesting.

970
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,385
What am I supposed to say'
``l went to magic camp'``

971
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,558
``l`m an accomplished
ventriloquist'``

972
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,757
``l am a seventh-degree
imperial yo-yo master.``

973
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:09,821
[exclaims]

974
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,925
Do me, yo-yo master.

975
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:15,802
I want you to do me,
`cause you`re the yo-yo guy.

976
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,368
Are you done' Listen.

977
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,375
The problem
most men have is...

978
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,901
they just plain straight up
have no clue
how to talk to women.

979
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:26,214
Just ask a question, okay'
That`s it.

980
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,547
Because women do not care
about what you have to say...

981
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,087
at all anyway, you know.

982
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,180
And all they want to do
is talk about themselves.

983
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:34,986
So you`re just gonna
let them do that.

984
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:36,685
okay' So remember.

985
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,991
Questions, be cool,
and be kind of a dick.

986
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:43,191
Here, be David Caruso
in Jade.

987
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,861
okay. I know exactly
what you`re talking about.

988
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,426
You do. That`s good.

989
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,638
(Cal)
There she is.

990
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,206
Go plant that seed, man.

991
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,576
Plant it with your finger.

992
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,226
Can I help you'

993
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,890
I don`t know. Can you'

994
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,535
Are you looking
for something'

995
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,531
Is there something
I should be looking for'

996
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:25,102
[laughs]

997
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,368
We have
a lot of books.

998
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:31,906
So, maybe it depends
on what you like.

999
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,387
What do you like'

1000
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:42,147
We have a great section of...

1001
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,126
do-it-yourself.

1002
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,560
Do you like to
``do it yourself``'

1003
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,658
Sometimes. I mean...

1004
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:53,795
if the mood strikes.

1005
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,233
How is the mood
striking you now'

1006
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,073
[laughing]

1007
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,939
[tittering]

1008
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,648
What`s your name'

1009
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,577
What`s your name'

1010
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,710
I`m Beth.

1011
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:13,548
Andy.

1012
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:15,951
Andy.

1013
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:21,223
Don`t tell on me,
okay, Andy'
I wont.

1014
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:25,265
Unless you want
to be told on...

1015
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:27,125
Beth.

1016
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,532
Wow. That totally worked!

1017
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:33,735
I literally said nothing.
And she found me fascinating.

1018
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,641
I would`ve thought
you were doing that for years.

1019
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,441
Should I have asked her out'
No. That`s the key.

1020
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,947
You wait for it
to grow into a plant...

1021
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,506
and then you fuck the plant.

1022
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,646
okay.

1023
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:47,751
This is easy.

1024
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,923
All right.

1025
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:53,055
Hello, Trish.
How you doing'
What`s going on'

1026
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,386
[laughing]

1027
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:55,858
Good joke.

1028
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,696
This is a fun conversation.

1029
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,134
Just grow a backbone
and call her.

1030
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,864
She asked you to call her.
She wants you to call her.

1031
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:09,976
[telephone ringing]

1032
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:11,014
Hello.

1033
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:12,913
Hey, how you doing'

1034
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:16,648
How you doing'
/`m we//.

1035
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,487
Who is this?

1036
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:22,215
This is James.
James. Do / know you, James?

1037
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,452
[grunting]

1038
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,819
I was wondering whether
you had a few minutes...

1039
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,796
to talk about
a little laundry detergent.

1040
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,991
Are you a telemarketer, James'

1041
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,257
Yep.

1042
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:32,666
Are you at the top
of a ta// bui/ding?

1043
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,170
Can you get to a roof quick/y?
Jump off!

1044
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:36,398
I mean, you people are sick.

1045
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,270
Get a real fucking job,
why don`t you'

1046
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,900
Go shoot yourse/f
in the fucking head.

1047
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,810
Hey, why don`t you just,
you know,
get a knife and run into it'

1048
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,278
Why don`t you do that, huh?

1049
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:45,645
okay.
/`// see you /ater, James.

1050
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:49,049
Nice to talk to you.
Fuck your mother, okay?
Bye-bye.

1051
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:51,776
oh.

1052
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:53,083
[doorbell ringing]

1053
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,358
Hey, man.
Got a big box of porn for you.

1054
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,461
Can I come in'
Yeah.

1055
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:03,256
[sighs]

1056
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,300
Sweet video game chair.

1057
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,501
So what`s in the box'

1058
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,940
It`s my personal collection
of erotica.

1059
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,469
I want to give it to you.

1060
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:17,479
I think there might be
a few tapes in there
that just might open up...

1061
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:19,071
Pandora`s box of love.

1062
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,173
okay.

1063
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:23,048
Amy and l,
we used to watch
Harry Twatter...

1064
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:24,643
and we`d put it on
the television...

1065
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:26,655
and then act it out
as it was going on...

1066
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:28,350
and it was....

1067
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,918
She`s adorable.

1068
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,296
Fucking bitch.

1069
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,389
Well, you know,
this is really gracious
and kind...

1070
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:37,626
and generous and everything.

1071
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,431
But I just don`t want
a big box of porn
in my apartment.

1072
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,938
There`s some really
great stuff in here.

1073
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:45,372
Really great movies in here,
man.

1074
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,166
Hey, did you ever see
Schoo/ of Rock?

1075
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,711
Yeah.
Well, this is....

1076
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:50,406
It`s called Schoo/ of....

1077
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:51,873
You know....

1078
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:55,549
That`s nice.
But it stars Jack Black Cock.

1079
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,614
That makes sense.

1080
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:59,518
Dude, here it is.

1081
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,149
Boner Jams `03.
It`s a mixed tape I made.

1082
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:06,321
All these great scenes
that I was really into

I think you`d really dig it.
Yeah. Now I can see that.

This is...

That`s probably
not supposed to be....

1087
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,068
This is a good show.
I just tape it sometimes.

Well, I don`t think
you understand something,
Dave.

1089
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:22,735
I don`t want this stuff, okay'
Because I don`t do that,
that much.

Yeah.

Are you kidding me' Why not'
lt`s not a hobby of mine.

Well, then,
that`s the only hobby
you don`t have.

No, seriously,
I just don`t feel comfortable

You need to.
You`re wound up.

Don`t take it out!

1100
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,229
I`m sorry.
You know what, it`s just....

1101
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:50,066
It loses its value if you
take it out of its packaging.

1102
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,268
I`m just saying, let it out.
Give it some air, man.
Play with it.

I`m not taking it.

fucking around
with my friend, okay'

him hope, and it`s driving
the man crazy.

I grew up in a town
outside of Minneapolis...

1241
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:47,821
with a population of, like,
500 people. Really small.

1242

Yeah, it`s like
the Land of a Thousand Lakes.

1243

What about you'
You`re used to, like,
a really big city.

Really.... God, yes.

1245
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:59,765
The town that I grew up in
was really small. I mean...

1246
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,770
you know, it was just so safe.
There was no crime.

1247
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:06,036
I mean, a girl could just walk
from one end of town
to the other...

1248
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:08,942
and just, you know,
feel completely safe.

Did you write this stuff'

1263
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:54,617
My girlfriend, Jill,
found your
speed-dating card.

1264

Yeah, right.

Thank you so much
for bringing it to me.

So, you actually wrote
that one girl looked like...

1268
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,932
she was
``hurting for a squirting``'

Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
Hurting for a squirting,
I wrote that.

So you wrote
``ho fo show.``

1271

Yeah, I remember that girl.
She was a ho.

I work with him and that`s it.

talk to people, too.

1383
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:28,187
Yes.

1384
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:30,357
okay, well, how do you know
that she was a man'

1385
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:33,368
Because her hands were
as big as Andre the Giant`s.

1386
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,399
And she had an Adam`s apple
as big as her balls.

1387
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,663
So you have no proof.

1388
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,706
You know what'
Just leave me alone.

1389
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:42,835
Just stay away from me.
or l`m gonna tell Paula...

1390
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,846
that you`re all stealing
the recordable CDs.

1391
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:48,176
Come on.
That`s like we were
paid to do it.

1392
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,310
We did this
`cause we`re your friends...

1393
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:53,150
and we didn`t think you have
the balls to do it yourself.

1394
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,484
Really'
(David)
Yeah.

1395
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,055
okay, watch this.

1396
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,726
Yo, Andy,
it`s just CDs, man.

1397
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,693
That`s a third strike
for me, dawg.

1398
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:05,393
[brakes screech]

1399
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:07,026
[man shouting]

1400
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,669
[grunts]

1401
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,313
[bells chiming]

1402
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:24,275
Hi.

1403
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:27,114
Andy. Hi.
Right, yeah.

1404
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,087
You remember my name.
I did.

1405
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:31,649
How you doing'
l`m great.
I like your store.

1406
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:34,287
That`s good, yeah.
If you have time,
look around. It`s....

1407
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,455
okay.

1408
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:37,229
How`s business been'

1409
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,269
You know, it`s coming along.
I mean, it takes a while.

1410
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:43,362
Do you want to
go out sometime'
Yes.

1411
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,330
Yes, I would like that.
That would be great.

1412
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:50,175
I think l`m maybe free
this weekend,
if that`s okay.

1413
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:53,044
or you could call me tomorrow
and we can just firm it up.

1414
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,639
okay. Great.
Great.

1415
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:58,312
okay, so l`ll call you,
and yeah, that`ll be good.

1416
01:05:58,387 --> 01:05:59,877
How you doing'
Congratulations.

1417
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,856
okay, so l`ll.... Yeah.

1418
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,488
Can I help you'

1419
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:06,084
Yeah, these are wonderful.
I`ll take these.

1420
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:09,891
Thanks, they are.
They`re great. The goldfish
just crack me up.

1421
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,056
Funny.

1422
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,225
Yeah, they are.
Yeah.

1423
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,495
Yeah.
They`re cute.

1424
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:16,732
I don`t actually
sell anything here.
I just sell them on eBay.
