1
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,456
<i>Dear Friend...</i>

2
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,371
<i>I am writing to you because
she said you listen and understand...</i>

3
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,424
<i>...and didn't try to sleep with
that person at that party...</i>

4
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:08,956
<i>...even though you could have.</i>

5
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:12,012
<i>Please don't try to
figure out who I am...</i>

6
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:13,890
<i>...I don't want you to do that.</i>

7
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:16,974
<i>I just need to know that
people like you exist.</i>

8
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:20,798
<i>Like if you met me,
you wouldn't think I was...</i>

9
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:24,144
<i>...the weird kid who spent
time in the hospital.</i>

10
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,701
<i>And I wouldn't make you nervous.</i>

11
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:32,579
<i>I hope it's okay for me to think that.</i>

12
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:38,244
<i>You see, I haven't really talked to
anyone outside of my family all summer.</i>

13
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:41,430
<i>But tomorrow is my first
day of high school ever...</i>

14
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:43,577
<i>...and I need to turn things around.</i>

15
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:46,508
<i>So, I have a plan.</i>

16
00:02:47,143 --> 00:02:48,858
<i>As I enter the school for the first time...</i>

17
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:53,758
<i>...I will visualize what it will be like on
the last day of my senior year.</i>

18
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:56,611
<i>Unfortunately, I counted, and that's...</i>

19
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,744
<i>Hop, freshman toads.
Hop! Let's move it, boys!</i>

20
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,042
<i>...1385 days from now.</i>

21
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:05,524
<i>Worked out all summer.
Rock hard.</i>

22
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,374
<i>You know,
Why don't you guys get a room?</i>

23
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:11,698
<i>Just 1385 days.</i>

24
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:16,225
<i>In the meantime, I'd hoped that my
sister Candace and her boyfriend Derek...</i>

25
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:18,489
<i>...would have let me eat
lunch with their Earth Club.</i>

26
00:03:18,524 --> 00:03:19,632
<i>Seniors only.</i>

27
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,355
<i>What are you doing
with that plastic spork?</i>

28
00:03:23,356 --> 00:03:25,158
<i>I don't want to bring back silverware.</i>

29
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:29,447
<i>Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer.
Come on.</i>

30
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:31,778
<i>When my sister said no...</i>

31
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:35,676
<i>...I thought maybe my old friend Susan
would want to have lunch with me.</i>

32
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,944
<i>In middle school, Susan
was very fun to be around, but...</i>

33
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:43,251
<i>...now she doesn't like
to say hi to me anymore.</i>

34
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:45,266
<i>And then there's Brad Hays.</i>

35
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:48,412
<i>Before my brother went to
play football for Penn State...</i>

36
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:49,962
<i>...he and Brad played together.</i>

37
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,759
<i>So, I thought maybe he'd say hi to me.</i>

38
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:57,110
<i>But Brad's a senior and I'm me,
so, who am I kidding?</i>

39
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,756
<i>On the bright side,
one senior decided to...</i>

40
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:02,598
<i>...make fun of the teacher
instead of the freshmen.</i>

41
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:07,387
<i>He even drew on Mr. Callahan's
legendary goatee with a grease pencil.</i>

42
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:13,208
<i>The prick punch is not a toy.</i>

43
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:16,137
<i>I learned that back in 'Nam in '68.</i>

44
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,888
<i>"Callahan," the sergeant said...</i>

45
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,106
<i>..."you put down that prick
punch, you go kill some gooks."</i>

46
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:22,276
<i>And you know what happened?</i>

47
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:26,255
<i>That prick punch killed my best friend
in a Saigon whorehouse.</i>

48
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:28,971
<i>I heard you were gonna be in my class.</i>

49
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:33,979
<i>Are you proud to be a senior having to
take freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?</i>

50
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,300
<i>Look. My name is Patrick.</i>

51
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:38,618
<i>Either you call me Patrick
or you call me nothing.</i>

52
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,803
<i>Okay, Nothing.</i>

53
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,521
<i>I felt really bad for Patrick.</i>

54
00:04:44,556 --> 00:04:47,887
<i>He wasn't saying the impersonation
to be mean or anything.</i>

55
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:51,128
<i>He was just trying to make us
freshmen feel better.</i>

56
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:54,457
<i>Nothing, why don't you read first?</i>

57
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:56,638
<i>Alright. Chapter 1.</i>

58
00:04:57,087 --> 00:05:01,034
<i>Surviving your fascist shop teacher,
who needs to put kids down to feel big.</i>

59
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,096
<i>Oh, wow. This is useful guys.
We should read on.</i>

60
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,277
<i>My last class of the
day is advanced English...</i>

61
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:11,407
<i>...and I'm really excited to finally learn
with the smartest kids in the school.</i>

62
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:15,312
<i>Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.</i>

63
00:05:15,313 --> 00:05:18,432
<i>Believe it or not she's gotten
straight A since kindergarten.</i>

64
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:23,371
<i>I'm Mr. Anderson.</i>

65
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,800
<i>I'm going to be your
teacher for freshman English.</i>

66
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:28,975
<i>This semester, we're going to be learning
Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

67
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:30,261
<i>Genius book.</i>

68
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:33,690
<i>Now, who'd like to get out
of the first pop quiz?</i>

69
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,671
<i>I'm shocked.</i>

70
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:37,710
<i>Alright.
Well, you can skip the quiz...</i>

71
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:40,803
<i>...if you tell me which author
invented the paperback book.</i>

72
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:42,030
<i>Anyone?</i>

73
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:43,678
<i>He was British.</i>

74
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:45,959
<i>He also invented the serial.</i>

75
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:50,651
<i>In fact, at the end of
the third chapter of his first novel...</i>

76
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:54,880
<i>...he had a man hanging
from a cliff by his fingernails.</i>

77
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:56,907
<i>Hence, the term cliffhanger.</i>

78
00:05:58,167 --> 00:05:59,413
<i>Anybody?</i>

79
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:01,420
<i>- Yeah.
- Shakespeare.</i>

80
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:04,565
<i>That's a great guess, but no,
Shakespeare didn't write novels.</i>

81
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:07,011
<i>Anybody else?</i>

82
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:10,899
<i>The author...</i>

83
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,016
<i>...is Charles Dickens.</i>

84
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:19,912
<i>However, if you and I
had gone to a Shakespeare play...</i>

85
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,772
<i>...it would have cost us 4 pennies.</i>

86
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,252
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>

87
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:25,518
<i>We would have put those
pennies in a metal box...</i>

88
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:27,596
<i>...the ushers would lock in the office.</i>

89
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:29,500
<i>And that's where we get the term...</i>

90
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:30,726
<i>Cash register.</i>

91
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,297
<i>I'll give you a free "A" on anything till
the final term paper if you get it right.</i>

92
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:43,033
<i>Box office.</i>

93
00:06:45,016 --> 00:06:46,661
<i>You should learn to participate.</i>

94
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:51,995
<i>Why didn't you raise your hand?</i>

95
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:56,560
<i>They call you teacher's pet?</i>

96
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:58,864
<i>Freak? That kind of things?</i>

97
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:02,501
<i>I used to get spaz.
I mean, come on, spaz?</i>

98
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:09,040
<i>You know, I heard
you had a tough time last year.</i>

99
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,204
<i>But they say if you make...</i>

100
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:14,166
<i>...one friend on your first day,
you're doing okay.</i>

101
00:07:14,698 --> 00:07:15,398
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

102
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,197
<i>But if my English teacher is
the only friend I make today...</i>

103
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:20,583
<i>...that would be sort of depressing.</i>

104
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:22,917
<i>Yeah. I could see that.</i>

105
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:25,117
<i>Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.
I'm okay.</i>

106
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:26,832
<i>Thanks.</i>

107
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:35,499
<i>I would happily not take shop...</i>

108
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,287
<i>Hey, Freshman Toad.</i>

109
00:07:38,882 --> 00:07:43,821
<i>Well, I have 1384 days to go.</i>

110
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,103
<i>Just so I say it to someone...</i>

111
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:50,867
<i>...high school is even
worse than middle school.</i>

112
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:56,122
<i>If my parents ask me about it,
I probably won't tell them the truth...</i>

113
00:07:56,157 --> 00:08:00,355
<i>...because I don't want them to
worry that I might get bad again.</i>

114
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,499
<i>If my Aunt Helen were still here,
I could talk to her.</i>

115
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,574
<i>And I know she would understand
how I am both happy and sad...</i>

116
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:10,747
<i>...and I'm still trying to
figure out how that could be.</i>

117
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:13,338
<i>I just hope I make a friend soon.</i>

118
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:16,510
<i>Love always, Charlie.</i>

119
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:19,260
<i>Charlie, come on.</i>

120
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:23,824
<i>This chicken paprikash is delicious.</i>

121
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,917
<i>Thank you, Derek.
It's Charlie's favorite.</i>

122
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:28,061
<i>He was a little nervous about
starting high school today...</i>

123
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:29,397
<i>...so I made it for him.</i>

124
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:32,144
<i>You feel a little silly about
being nervous now, huh, champ?</i>

125
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:34,550
<i>Yes, sir. I do</i>

126
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:35,602
<i>I told you.</i>

127
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:38,189
<i>Just give 'em a smile and be yourself.</i>

128
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,017
<i>- That's how you...
- "...make friends in the real world."</i>

129
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:42,606
<i>You're cruisin' for a bruisin'</i>

130
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:44,792
<i>Freshman year is tough, but...</i>

131
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:46,943
<i>...you really find yourself.</i>

132
00:08:52,202 --> 00:08:53,586
<i>Thanks, Derek.</i>

133
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:56,497
<i>You know, you could be
a little nicer to Derek.</i>

134
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:59,002
<i>I'm sorry. The kid's a pussy.
I can't stand him.</i>

135
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:02,594
<i>- I really hope you love the mix tape I made.
- I do.</i>

136
00:09:03,003 --> 00:09:05,306
<i>- The cover is hand-painted.
- Oh. Wow.</i>

137
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:12,149
<i>Hey, Charlie, you want this?</i>

138
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:14,459
<i>Are you sure?</i>

139
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,259
<i>He gives me one every week.</i>

140
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:23,276
<i>Hey, Babe.
This next one might be a little sad...</i>

141
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:25,351
<i>...but it reminded me of your eyes.</i>

142
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:47,763
<i>Did you already do the term paper
on To Kill a Mockingbird?</i>

143
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,985
<i>Let's go, Devils!</i>

144
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:07,546
<i>Come on.</i>

145
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,528
<i>- Hey, Nothing.
- Hey, Nothing.</i>

146
00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:11,298
<i>Oh, suck it, virginity pledges!</i>

147
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,362
<i>Suck it!</i>

148
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,795
<i>Hey, Patrick.</i>

149
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,366
<i>Hey! You're in my shop class, right?</i>

150
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,017
<i>How's your clock coming?</i>

151
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:37,836
<i>My dad's building it for me.</i>

152
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:40,423
<i>Yeah. Mine looks like a boat.</i>

153
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:43,096
<i>You wanna sit over here,
or are you waiting for your friends?</i>

154
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:44,334
<i>Oh, no, no, I'll sit.</i>

155
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,836
<i>Thanks for not calling
me "Nothing" by the way.</i>

156
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:51,125
<i>It's an endless nightmare.</i>

157
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,456
<i>And these assholes,
they actually think they're being original.</i>

158
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:59,136
<i>- So, uh... do you like football?
- Love it. Love football.</i>

159
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:00,453
<i>Maybe you know my brother, then.</i>

160
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:01,691
<i>Hey, Sam.</i>

161
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:05,282
<i>Question. Could the bathrooms here
be more disgusting?</i>

162
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,284
<i>Yes, they call it the men's room.</i>

163
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,259
<i>So, I finally got hold of Bob.</i>

164
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:12,717
<i>Party tonight?</i>

165
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:16,528
<i>He's still trying to shag that
waitress from the Olive Garden.</i>

166
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:18,690
<i>Oh, he's never tossing that salad.</i>

167
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:22,868
<i>Come on!</i>

168
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,609
<i>Patrick!</i>

169
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,850
<i>- Yeah.
- Who's this?</i>

170
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:30,736
<i>This is...</i>

171
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:34,823
<i>- Charlie... Kelmeckis.
- Kelmeckis! No shit!</i>

172
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:37,139
<i>- Your sister's dating Pony Tail Derek, isn't she?
- God!</i>

173
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,555
<i>Is that what they call him?</i>

174
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:40,551
<i>Would you leave Pony Tail Derek alone?</i>

175
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:42,727
<i>You put the "ass" in "class," Patrick.</i>

176
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,404
<i>I try, Sam. I try.</i>

177
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,837
<i>It's nice to meet you, Charlie.
I'm Sam.</i>

178
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:50,471
<i>So, Sam, what's the plan?
Are we going to Mary Elizabeth's tonight?</i>

179
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:54,265
<i>Nope. She got caught watering down
her parent's brandy with iced tea.</i>

180
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:55,547
<i>Let's just go to Kings.</i>

181
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:58,406
<i>Alright. We're going to Kings
after the game if you wanna come.</i>

182
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:19,499
<i>Do you have a favorite band?</i>

183
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:22,354
<i>Well, I think The Smiths are my favorite.</i>

184
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,787
<i>Are you kidding?
I love The Smiths!</i>

185
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:27,429
<i>The best breakup band ever.
What's your favorite song?</i>

186
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,878
<i>Asleep.
It's from Louder Than Bombs.</i>

187
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,612
<i>I heard it on Pony
Tail Derek's mix tape.</i>

188
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,326
<i>Oh, that works on so many levels.</i>

189
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:36,166
<i>I can make you guys a copy if you want.</i>

190
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:37,971
<i>What about Eide's?
You love Eide's, right?</i>

191
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:39,802
<i>Yeah, of course.
They're great.</i>

192
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,417
<i>Not a band, Charlie.</i>

193
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:43,258
<i>It's a record store downtown.</i>

194
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:44,957
<i>I think it sounds
so much better on the Vinyl.</i>

195
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,785
<i>You know, I used to be popular
before Sam got me some good music.</i>

196
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,767
<i>So, you should be careful.
She'll ruin your life forever.</i>

197
00:13:50,895 --> 00:13:51,950
<i>That's okay.</i>

198
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,203
<i>- Hey, Nothing.
- Hey, Nothing.</i>

199
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:58,287
<i>Let it go! Jesus!
It's an antique joke!</i>

200
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,576
<i>It's over!</i>

201
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:01,779
<i>So, what are you gonna do
when you get out of this place?</i>

202
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:04,258
<i>Well, My Aunt Helen said
I should be a writer, but..</i>

203
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,211
<i>I don't know what I'd write about.</i>

204
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,103
<i>- You could write about us.
- Yeah.</i>

205
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:11,779
<i>Call it Slut and The Falcon.</i>

206
00:14:12,012 --> 00:14:13,441
<i>Make us solve crimes.</i>

207
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,794
<i>You guys seem really happy together.</i>

208
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:17,757
<i>How long have you been
boyfriend and girlfriend?</i>

209
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:23,538
<i>He's not my boyfriend.
He's my step-brother.</i>

210
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:28,235
<i>My mom finally left my worthless dad and
married his nice dad when we moved here.</i>

211
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,629
<i>But She's not bitter or anything.
Make no mistake.</i>

212
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:31,856
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

213
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:35,713
<i>Charlie, I'm not a bulimic.
I'm a bulim-ist.</i>

214
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,912
<i>I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know what that is.</i>

215
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:39,849
<i>She just really believes in bulimia.</i>

216
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,634
<i>I love bulimia.</i>

217
00:14:46,982 --> 00:14:48,606
<i>Hey, thanks for paying, Charlie.</i>

218
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:50,701
<i>Oh, no problem.
Thank you guys for the ride.</i>

219
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:52,715
<i>Maybe I'll see you around in school?</i>

220
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:55,427
<i>God, would you turn that down?
You're gonna make us deaf.</i>

221
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,359
<i>So be it!
It's Rock and roll.</i>

222
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:00,632
<i>- Bye, Charlie.
- Bye, Charlie.</i>

223
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,055
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

224
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,733
<i>Your mom says Don't go
to Columbia with Candace.</i>

225
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,158
<i>- Don't go to Columbia...
- Shut...</i>

226
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:19,413
<i>Do you always want to
be a mama's boy, Derek?</i>

227
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:21,117
<i>- I am not a mama's boy.
- Yes, you are!</i>

228
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:24,125
<i>Because Every single time I go to
your house, every single time...</i>

229
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:25,388
<i>Shut up, Candace!</i>

230
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:28,333
<i>...and you stand there
like a little beach...</i>

231
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:32,333
<i>Charlie, Charlie, just go.
I can handle it.</i>

232
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:34,471
<i>Just don't wake up mom and dad.</i>

233
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:05,576
<i>Hey, look who's here.</i>

234
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:08,119
<i>Welcome home, Aunt Helen!</i>

235
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:12,891
<i>Oh. Look at you guys,
dressed so nice.</i>

236
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:22,555
<i>Candace...</i>

237
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:26,204
<i>...what are you doing?</i>

238
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:29,705
<i>Look, I egged him on.</i>

239
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,122
<i>You saw it.
He's never hit me before.</i>

240
00:16:33,157 --> 00:16:36,314
<i>And I promise you he'll
never hit me again.</i>

241
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:38,969
<i>Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?</i>

242
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,892
<i>Charlie, this is Pony Tail Derek.</i>

243
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,553
<i>I can handle him.</i>

244
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:51,205
<i>Do you trust me?</i>

245
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:56,144
<i>Please, don't tell mom and dad.</i>

246
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:39,505
<i>Oh, my God.
They're playing good music.</i>

247
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,234
<i>Holy shit. Holy shit.
They are! They're playing good music.</i>

248
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,329
<i>Living room routine?</i>

249
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:45,538
<i>Living room routine!</i>

250
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:46,997
<i>- Yes!
- I'm sorry.</i>

251
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,608
<i>- Excuse us! Excuse me!
- I'm sorry!</i>

252
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:49,528
<i>- Pardon me.
- Sorry.</i>

253
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:52,631
<i>Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!</i>

254
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:26,077
<i>God, it's freezing.</i>

255
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:27,877
<i>Ho, but you wore that toasty costume.</i>

256
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:30,399
<i>It's not like it's cute or original
you'd hope it'd be warm.</i>

257
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:32,901
<i>Yeah, piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.</i>

258
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:34,450
<i>Are you sure it's okay that I come?</i>

259
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:36,773
<i>Yeah, of course.
Just remember, Charlie...</i>

260
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,061
<i>- Bob's not paranoid.
- "He's sensitive."</i>

261
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:40,479
<i>Sam...</i>

262
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:44,642
<i>...that waitress from the Olive Garden,
she was such a tease.</i>

263
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,566
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

264
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:49,440
<i>- Only with Patrick's blessing.
- Patrick?</i>

265
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:52,709
<i>You're a hopeless stoner who
attends the culinary institute.</i>

266
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,593
<i>So, I'm gonna have to say
"no" on that, but nice try.</i>

267
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:57,160
<i>- Charlie?
- Oh, touché.</i>

268
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:09,976
<i>So, Charlie... this is a party.</i>

269
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:20,333
<i>This is what fun looks like.</i>

270
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,205
<i>Are you ready to meet
some desperate women?</i>

271
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:25,643
<i>Here, have a seat.</i>

272
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,113
<i>Hey, ladies, meet Charlie.</i>

273
00:20:25,811 --> 00:20:27,709
<i>- Hi.
- Meet ladies.</i>

274
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,446
<i>Hey.</i>

275
00:20:28,481 --> 00:20:29,741
<i>- Mary Elizabeth.
- Alice.</i>

276
00:20:29,776 --> 00:20:30,839
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

277
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:32,314
<i>This is Charlie's first party ever.</i>

278
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:37,325
<i>So, I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt
blow jobs from both of you.</i>

279
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,542
<i>- Patrick, you're such a dick.
- Where the hell did you go?</i>

280
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:41,768
<i>The dance was a little boring,
don't you think?</i>

281
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,959
<i>You're so selfish.
We looked everywhere for you.</i>

282
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,148
<i>You could have told someone.</i>

283
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,805
<i>Cry me a river.</i>

284
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:49,759
<i>How is it that you've got meaner
since becoming a Buddhist.</i>

285
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,056
<i>Just lucky I guess.</i>

286
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:53,043
<i>No, you're doing
something wrong, I think.</i>

287
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:54,995
<i>- Or something very right.
- Yeah, well...</i>

288
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,017
<i>Hey!</i>

289
00:20:56,586 --> 00:20:58,071
<i>Look who's here!</i>

290
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:01,484
<i>Is that Brad Hays?</i>

291
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,212
<i>Yeah. He comes here sometimes.</i>

292
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:05,315
<i>But he's a popular kid.</i>

293
00:21:05,793 --> 00:21:06,782
<i>Then, what are we?</i>

294
00:21:08,153 --> 00:21:11,643
<i>Oh, Charlie, you look like
you could use a brownie.</i>

295
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:13,676
<i>Thank you.</i>

296
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:17,433
<i>I was so hungry at the dance.
I was gonna go to King's...</i>

297
00:21:17,468 --> 00:21:19,004
<i>...but I didn't really have any time.</i>

298
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,522
<i>Thanks.</i>

299
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:36,354
<i>Have you guys felt this carpet?</i>

300
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:38,671
<i>This carpet feels so darn good.</i>

301
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:47,483
<i>Charlie. Charlie, what do you
think about high school?</i>

302
00:21:47,518 --> 00:21:48,541
<i>High school?</i>

303
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:50,303
<i>Bullshit.</i>

304
00:21:51,592 --> 00:21:53,549
<i>Cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center.</i>

305
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:57,020
<i>People wear their letter jackets
even when it's 98 degrees out.</i>

306
00:21:57,055 --> 00:22:00,214
<i>And why do they give out
letter jackets for marching band?</i>

307
00:22:00,591 --> 00:22:03,961
<i>It's not a sport, we all know it.</i>

308
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:05,733
<i>This kid is crazy.</i>

309
00:22:06,703 --> 00:22:09,462
<i>Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really
gonna regret that, you know...</i>

310
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:13,090
<i>...haircut when you
look back at old photographs.</i>

311
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:17,690
<i>I'm really sorry.
It sounded like a compliment in my head.</i>

312
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:19,419
<i>- God!
- Well, it's kind of true.</i>

313
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:20,826
<i>Shut up!</i>

314
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,831
<i>Bob, did you get him stoned?</i>

315
00:22:24,866 --> 00:22:27,462
<i>Come on, Sam.
He likes it. Just look at him.</i>

316
00:22:28,007 --> 00:22:29,841
<i>How do you feel, Charlie?</i>

317
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:32,826
<i>I just really want a milkshake.</i>

318
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,076
<i>Sam...</i>

319
00:22:45,754 --> 00:22:48,704
<i>...you have such pretty brown eyes.</i>

320
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:51,546
<i>The kind of pretty that deserves
to make a big deal about itself.</i>

321
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:52,541
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

322
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:58,255
<i>Okay, Charlie.
Let me make the milkshake.</i>

323
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:01,907
<i>What a great word. Milkshake.</i>

324
00:23:01,942 --> 00:23:05,996
<i>It's like when you say your name
over and over again in the mirror...</i>

325
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:07,846
<i>...and after awhile, it sounds crazy.</i>

326
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,608
<i>So, I'm guessing
you've never been high before?</i>

327
00:23:10,643 --> 00:23:12,375
<i>No. No, no, no.</i>

328
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,894
<i>My best friend Michael.
His dad was a big drinker.</i>

329
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:18,481
<i>So, he hated all that stuff.</i>

330
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:19,692
<i>Parties, too.</i>

331
00:23:19,957 --> 00:23:21,775
<i>Well, where is Michael tonight?</i>

332
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,593
<i>Oh, he shot himself last May.</i>

333
00:23:28,735 --> 00:23:31,372
<i>Kinda wished he'd left a note.
You know what I mean?</i>

334
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:40,370
<i>Where's the bathroom?</i>

335
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:44,503
<i>- It's up the stairs.
- Thanks, Sam.</i>

336
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:45,896
<i>You're so nice.</i>

337
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,602
<i>Charlie.</i>

338
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:04,993
<i>Weird.</i>

339
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,060
<i>Oh!</i>

340
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:13,700
<i>Charlie?</i>

341
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:18,012
<i>- Who is that kid?
- Relax.</i>

342
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,890
<i>Relax. He's a friend of mine.</i>

343
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,600
<i>Stay here.</i>

344
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:22,997
<i>I didn't see anything.</i>

345
00:24:23,032 --> 00:24:26,140
<i>Yeah, I know you saw
something, but it's okay.</i>

346
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,128
<i>Okay, listen...</i>

347
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,428
<i>Brad doesn't want anyone to know.</i>

348
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:34,914
<i>Wait...</i>

349
00:24:35,152 --> 00:24:37,616
<i>- Are you baked?
- "Like a cake."</i>

350
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:39,911
<i>That's what Bob said.</i>

351
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:42,764
<i>And how you can't have 3 on a
match because then they'd find us.</i>

352
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,922
<i>And everyone laughed,
but I don't understand what's funny.</i>

353
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,607
<i>Okay, Charlie, listen.</i>

354
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,565
<i>I need you to promise...</i>

355
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:56,890
<i>...that you're not gonna say
anything to anyone about me and Brad.</i>

356
00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:00,574
<i>Okay?
This has to be our little secret.</i>

357
00:25:01,118 --> 00:25:02,771
<i>Our little secret.</i>

358
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:04,388
<i>Agreed.</i>

359
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,309
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

360
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:09,004
<i>We'll talk later.</i>

361
00:25:11,872 --> 00:25:13,396
<i>I look forward to that big talk.</i>

362
00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:21,667
<i>Isn't this the best milkshake ever, Alice?</i>

363
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:24,538
<i>It's even better than the first one.</i>

364
00:25:26,837 --> 00:25:28,197
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

365
00:25:30,271 --> 00:25:32,983
<i>Charlie just told me that
his best friend shot himself.</i>

366
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,364
<i>I don't think he has any friends.</i>

367
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:48,699
<i>Hey. Everyone. Everybody.</i>

368
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:52,004
<i>Everyone.</i>

369
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,423
<i>Raise your glasses to Charlie.</i>

370
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:59,636
<i>- What did I do?
- You didn't do anything.</i>

371
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:02,870
<i>We just wanna toast to our new friend.</i>

372
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:04,060
<i>You see things.</i>

373
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:06,001
<i>And you understand.</i>

374
00:26:07,874 --> 00:26:09,235
<i>You're a wallflower.</i>

375
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:14,219
<i>What is it? What's wrong?</i>

376
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:17,470
<i>I didn't think anyone noticed me.</i>

377
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:23,912
<i>Well, we didn't think there was
anyone cool left to meet.</i>

378
00:26:23,952 --> 00:26:26,577
<i>So, Come on, everyone.</i>

379
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:31,305
<i>- To Charlie.
- To Charlie.</i>

380
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:38,167
<i>Welcome to the island of misfit toys.</i>

381
00:26:48,522 --> 00:26:51,800
<i>- Oh, my God. What is this song!?
- Right? I have no idea.</i>

382
00:26:52,226 --> 00:26:53,608
<i>Have you ever heard this before?</i>

383
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:55,398
<i>Never.</i>

384
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,207
<i>Patrick, We've gotta
go through the tunnel!</i>

385
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:02,089
<i>- Sam, it's freezing.
- Patrick, it's the perfect song!</i>

386
00:27:02,124 --> 00:27:03,691
<i>No. Mama Patrick says no.</i>

387
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:07,548
<i>Patrick. Patrick, it's Sam.
It's Sam speaking to you...</i>

388
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,816
<i>- ...I'm begging you to...
- I concede!</i>

389
00:27:13,268 --> 00:27:14,334
<i>What is she doing?</i>

390
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:16,674
<i>Don't worry.
She does it all the time.</i>

391
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:22,054
<i>Turn it up!</i>

392
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:23,765
<i>You got it, your highness.</i>

393
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:04,942
<i>What?</i>

394
00:28:06,624 --> 00:28:08,583
<i>I feel infinite.</i>

395
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,049
<i>Dear Friend...</i>

396
00:28:27,988 --> 00:28:32,019
<i>I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but
I've been trying hard not to be a loser.</i>

397
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:36,224
<i>For example, I am trying to participate...</i>

398
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:40,676
<i>...by listening to Sam's collection of big
rock ballads and thinking about love.</i>

399
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,410
<i>Sam says they are kitschy and brilliant.</i>

400
00:28:44,754 --> 00:28:46,013
<i>I completely agree.</i>

401
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:54,220
<i>I am also writing essays and
studying extra books outside of class.</i>

402
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,734
<i>As it turns out,
Mr. Anderson is a writer.</i>

403
00:28:57,256 --> 00:29:01,002
<i>He even had a play put up in New York once,
which I think is very impressive.</i>

404
00:29:02,905 --> 00:29:05,459
<i>He and his wife might
go back there after this year.</i>

405
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,517
<i>I know this is selfish,
but I really hope he doesn't.</i>

406
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:14,544
<i>My favorite time, though, is lunch
because I get to see Sam and Patrick.</i>

407
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,296
<i>We spend the time working
on Mary Elizabeth's fanzine...</i>

408
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:20,702
<i>...about music and
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.</i>

409
00:29:20,788 --> 00:29:23,019
<i>It's called Punk Rocky.</i>

410
00:29:23,197 --> 00:29:27,596
<i>Mary Elizabeth is really interesting
because she is a Buddhist and a punk...</i>

411
00:29:27,597 --> 00:29:31,929
<i>...but somehow she always acts like
my father at the end of a "long day."</i>

412
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:36,375
<i>Her best friend Alice loves vampires
and wants to go to film school.</i>

413
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:38,459
<i>She also steals jeans from the mall.</i>

414
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,104
<i>I don't know why because
her family is rich...</i>

415
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:43,197
<i>...but I'm trying not to be judgemental.</i>

416
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:46,912
<i>Especially since I know that they
were all there for Patrick last year.</i>

417
00:29:47,717 --> 00:29:51,701
<i>Patrick never likes to be serious,
so it took me awhile to get what happened.</i>

418
00:29:52,652 --> 00:29:57,516
<i>When he was a junior, Patrick started
seeing Brad on the weekends in secret.</i>

419
00:29:57,551 --> 00:29:58,844
<i>I guess it was hard, too...</i>

420
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:01,956
<i>...because Brad had to get drunk
every time they fooled around.</i>

421
00:30:02,774 --> 00:30:04,965
<i>Then, Monday in school,
Brad would say:</i>

422
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,690
<i>"Man, I was so wasted.
I don't remember a thing."</i>

423
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:10,504
<i>This went on for 7 months.</i>

424
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:14,970
<i>When they finally did it,
Brad said he loved Patrick.</i>

425
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,857
<i>Then, he started to cry.</i>

426
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:21,454
<i>No matter what Patrick did,
Brad kept saying his dad would kill him.</i>

427
00:30:21,715 --> 00:30:23,713
<i>And saying that he was going to hell.</i>

428
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:27,760
<i>Patrick was eventually
able to help Brad get sober.</i>

429
00:30:28,503 --> 00:30:32,985
<i>I asked Patrick if he felt sad
that he still had to keep it a secret...</i>

430
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:34,688
<i>...and he said no...</i>

431
00:30:35,211 --> 00:30:38,656
<i>...because at least now, Brad
doesn't have to get drunk to love him.</i>

432
00:30:40,052 --> 00:30:43,546
<i>I think that I understand
because I really like Sam.</i>

433
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:46,078
<i>I asked my sister about her...</i>

434
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,375
<i>...and she said that
when Sam was a freshman...</i>

435
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:51,883
<i>...the upper classmen used to
get her drunk at parties.</i>

436
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:53,422
<i>I guess she had a reputation.</i>

437
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:54,970
<i>But I don't care.</i>

438
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:59,227
<i>I'd hate for her to judge me
based on what I used to be like.</i>

439
00:31:00,045 --> 00:31:03,335
<i>So, I've been making her a mix tape
so she will know how I feel.</i>

440
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,406
<i>Ah, shit!</i>

441
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:07,897
<i>- C!
- C!</i>

442
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,574
<i>- Give a K!
- K!</i>

443
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:11,417
<i>- Gimme a Y!
- Y!</i>

444
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,795
<i>- What's that spell!?
- R-O-C-K-Y!</i>

445
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,149
<i>- I can't hear you!
- Rocky!</i>

446
00:31:16,184 --> 00:31:18,504
<i>- One more time!
- Rocky!</i>

447
00:31:39,635 --> 00:31:43,680
<i>¶¶ Whatever happened to Fae Wray? ¶¶</i>

448
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:50,225
<i>¶¶ That delicate, satin draped frame? ¶¶</i>

449
00:31:52,553 --> 00:31:55,832
<i>¶¶ As it clung to her thigh</i>

450
00:31:57,145 --> 00:32:02,115
<i>how I started to cry ¶¶</i>

451
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,296
<i>¶¶ 'cause I wanted to be dressed</i>

452
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:10,854
<i>just the same. ¶¶</i>

453
00:32:12,437 --> 00:32:15,252
<i>¶¶ Give yourself over</i>

454
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:18,850
<i>to absolute pleasure ¶¶</i>

455
00:32:19,427 --> 00:32:22,525
<i>¶¶ Swim the warm waters</i>

456
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:26,088
<i>of sins of the flesh ¶¶</i>

457
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,346
<i>¶¶ Erotic nightmares</i>

458
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,725
<i>beyond any measure ¶¶</i>

00:32:33,364 --> 00:32:37,256
<i>¶¶ And sensual daydreams</i>

460
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:41,333
<i>to treasure forever ¶¶</i>

461
00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:46,392
<i>¶¶ Can't you just see it? ¶¶</i>

462
00:32:47,403 --> 00:32:49,302
<i>¶¶ Woah oh oh! ¶¶</i>

463
00:32:56,939 --> 00:32:59,345
<i>¶¶ Don't Dream It</i>

464
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,282
<i>Be It ¶¶</i>

465
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:10,414
<i>That picture is gorgeous, Craig.
What did you use?</i>

466
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,976
<i>Oh, I know, thank you.</i>

467
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,007
<i>Color film, but black and
white paper for the printing.</i>

468
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:19,354
<i>Yeah. My professor gave me an "A,"
but for all the wrong reasons.</i>

469
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:20,762
<i>Most of them are idiots.</i>

470
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,112
<i>You'll see what I mean
when you get to college.</i>

471
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,563
<i>How did your SAT's go by the way?</i>

472
00:33:25,564 --> 00:33:26,929
<i>1150.</i>

473
00:33:27,223 --> 00:33:29,490
<i>- I think I'll get into NYU.
- Yeah, I hope so.</i>

474
00:33:29,749 --> 00:33:32,436
<i>1490. Harvard. Face!</i>

475
00:33:35,453 --> 00:33:37,716
<i>So, Are you okay?</i>

476
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:40,389
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

477
00:33:41,298 --> 00:33:43,801
<i>But I got my SAT results back.</i>

478
00:33:44,728 --> 00:33:45,651
<i>Oops.</i>

479
00:33:46,072 --> 00:33:48,271
<i>You can take them again, you know.</i>

480
00:33:48,968 --> 00:33:51,514
<i>Yeah, it's just if I'm going
to Penn State main campus...</i>

481
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:52,961
<i>...I have to do much better.</i>

482
00:33:53,862 --> 00:33:55,745
<i>I wish I would have
studied freshman year.</i>

483
00:33:57,014 --> 00:33:58,739
<i>I was a bit of a mess.</i>

484
00:34:00,911 --> 00:34:02,864
<i>I'll help you study for the next one.</i>

485
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:05,846
<i>- Will you?
- Yeah, of course.</i>

486
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,091
<i>Thanks, Charlie.</i>

487
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:22,695
<i>What's this?</i>

488
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,604
<i>Just a mix tape.
No big deal.</i>

489
00:34:26,515 --> 00:34:28,626
<i>My parents have a pretty good stereo, so...</i>

490
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,208
<i>It's all about that night in the tunnel.</i>

491
00:34:32,652 --> 00:34:35,018
<i>I couldn't find that song
we were listening to...</i>

492
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:37,384
<i>...but, you know, I'm still
searching for it, so...</i>

493
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:38,794
<i>It's okay.</i>

494
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:41,360
<i>These are great.</i>

495
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:46,018
<i>Nick Drake. The Shack's.</i>

496
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:49,491
<i>You have really good taste, Charlie.</i>

497
00:34:49,997 --> 00:34:51,026
<i>Really?</i>

498
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:54,386
<i>Yeah.
Way better than me as a freshman.</i>

499
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:56,953
<i>- I used to listen to the worst top 40.
- No.</i>

500
00:34:56,954 --> 00:34:57,956
<i>Yeah, I did.</i>

501
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:01,373
<i>Then I heard this old song.</i>

502
00:35:03,242 --> 00:35:05,005
<i>Pearly Dew Drops Drop.</i>

503
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:09,288
<i>And I thought someday I would be
at a party in college or something.</i>

504
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:13,866
<i>And I'd look up and see
this person across the room.</i>

505
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:19,329
<i>And from that moment, I'd know
everything was going to be okay.</i>

506
00:35:20,804 --> 00:35:22,117
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

507
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:25,332
<i>Yeah.</i>

508
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:44,269
<i>- I hope it works out.
- I don't know.</i>

509
00:35:45,035 --> 00:35:48,038
<i>Craig would be a big
step up from her last boyfriend.</i>

510
00:35:48,073 --> 00:35:48,934
<i>No, shit.</i>

511
00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:51,553
<i>Who could forget Mr. Car Wash Loser?</i>

512
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:54,348
<i>I just hope she could stop
playing dumb with these guys.</i>

513
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:58,018
<i>I keep telling her...
don't make yourself small.</i>

514
00:35:59,672 --> 00:36:01,315
<i>You can't save anybody.</i>

515
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:06,173
<i>Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid.</i>

516
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,288
<i>How about something
a little bit more upbeat, huh?</i>

517
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:13,578
<i>So, Sam tells me
you want to be a writer.</i>

518
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:15,987
<i>Yeah.</i>

519
00:36:16,094 --> 00:36:18,059
<i>Don't you write poetry, Craig?</i>

520
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:24,435
<i>Poetry writes me.
You know?</i>

521
00:36:25,594 --> 00:36:27,374
<i>Let's get this party started.</i>

522
00:36:51,324 --> 00:36:52,868
<i>That was fast.</i>

523
00:36:53,437 --> 00:36:55,244
<i>- You want another one?
- Yeah.</i>

524
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,943
<i>Alright.</i>

525
00:37:05,909 --> 00:37:07,160
<i>Mr. Anderson.</i>

526
00:37:09,321 --> 00:37:11,485
<i>- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.</i>

527
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:18,336
<i>Why do nice people choose
the wrong people to date?</i>

528
00:37:19,808 --> 00:37:22,212
<i>Are we talking about anyone specific?</i>

529
00:37:28,272 --> 00:37:30,799
<i>We accept the love we think we deserve.</i>

530
00:37:31,628 --> 00:37:33,777
<i>Can we make them know
that they deserve more?</i>

531
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,704
<i>We can try.</i>

532
00:37:54,219 --> 00:37:55,905
<i>- Hey.
- Hey! Hey, Sam.</i>

533
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,592
<i>I didn't see you come in.
How's it going?</i>

534
00:37:58,211 --> 00:38:00,886
<i>You want to work on
probabilities and statistics?</i>

535
00:38:01,102 --> 00:38:01,990
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

536
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:05,329
<i>Page 391 on your book.</i>

537
00:38:07,445 --> 00:38:09,280
<i>Hey, I ordered you some breakfast...</i>

538
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,381
<i>Dad, Can I have 30 dollars?</i>

539
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,716
<i>20 dollars?
What do you need 10 dollars for?</i>

540
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:35,306
<i>Sam is doing secret santa.</i>

541
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:36,574
<i>It's her favorite thing in the world.</i>

542
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:37,436
<i>Please.</i>

543
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:41,956
<i>Have fun.</i>

544
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:44,969
<i>Thanks.</i>

545
00:38:57,278 --> 00:38:58,090
<i>Charlie!</i>

546
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:00,955
<i>This was my favorite book growing up.</i>

547
00:39:01,557 --> 00:39:04,768
<i>This is my copy,
but I want you to have it.</i>

548
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:07,301
<i>Thanks.</i>

549
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,918
<i>Have a great Christmas break.</i>

550
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,626
<i>You too, Mr. Anderson.</i>

551
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,302
<i>Terrible stain.</i>

552
00:39:18,298 --> 00:39:22,017
<i>That's pretty good, Charlie.</i>

553
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:29,966
<i>You've gotta be kidding me.</i>

554
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:32,928
<i>If you fail me,
you get me next semester.</i>

555
00:39:40,232 --> 00:39:41,460
<i>C Minus!</i>

556
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:43,978
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I am below average!</i>

557
00:39:43,979 --> 00:39:46,312
<i>- Below average!
- Below average!</i>

558
00:39:46,313 --> 00:39:48,630
<i>- Guys.1210.
- What?</i>

559
00:39:50,485 --> 00:39:52,374
<i>No more applications!</i>

560
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:54,202
<i>No more SAT's!</i>

561
00:39:54,237 --> 00:39:55,611
<i>Thank you, Charlie!</i>

562
00:39:56,518 --> 00:39:58,347
<i>Alright. Alright, guys. I got...</i>

563
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,986
<i>...multiple pairs of blue jeans.</i>

564
00:40:02,168 --> 00:40:04,197
<i>Wow. This is a really tough one, but...</i>

565
00:40:04,198 --> 00:40:06,170
<i>...I'm gonna have to guess... Alice.</i>

566
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:10,888
<i>Wait, guys... a receipt!
She actually paid!</i>

567
00:40:10,923 --> 00:40:12,453
<i>- Impossible!
- I'm so touched.</i>

568
00:40:12,488 --> 00:40:15,162
<i>- Where's Craig?
- Oh, he went home to Connecticut.</i>

569
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,820
<i>But he'll be back for New Year's Eve.</i>

570
00:40:17,552 --> 00:40:19,810
<i>I'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.</i>

571
00:40:20,535 --> 00:40:23,016
<i>Alright, big brother by 3 weeks.</i>

572
00:40:23,307 --> 00:40:25,895
<i>- Who's your secret santa?
- I'll tell you, Sam.</i>

573
00:40:26,464 --> 00:40:27,726
<i>This one's tough.</i>

574
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:32,099
<i>I have received a harmonica,
a magnetic poetry set...</i>

575
00:40:32,134 --> 00:40:34,311
<i>...a book about Harvey Milk...</i>

576
00:40:34,312 --> 00:40:37,544
<i>...and a mix tape
with the song "Asleep" on it...</i>

577
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:39,240
<i>...twice.</i>

578
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,837
<i>I mean, I have no idea.</i>

579
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:43,070
<i>This collection of presents is so gay...</i>

580
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:45,872
<i>...that I think I must
have given them to myself.</i>

581
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:48,204
<i>But despite that distinct possibility...</i>

582
00:40:48,205 --> 00:40:50,272
<i>...I'm gonna have to go with...</i>

583
00:40:50,654 --> 00:40:52,729
<i>...drum roll...</i>

584
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:54,806
<i>Charlie.</i>

585
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:57,428
<i>- Obviously.
- Beautifully done.</i>

586
00:40:58,071 --> 00:41:00,532
<i>Alright, Charlie. It's your turn.</i>

587
00:41:02,674 --> 00:41:04,309
<i>Okey dokey.</i>

588
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:07,958
<i>Uh, I have received...</i>

589
00:41:08,756 --> 00:41:12,739
<i>...socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt.</i>

590
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:14,704
<i>I was ordered to wear them all tonight.</i>

591
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:18,760
<i>So, I'm guessing my secret
santa is Mary Elizabeth.</i>

592
00:41:19,712 --> 00:41:21,524
<i>- Huh. Now, why do you say that?
- I don't know.</i>

593
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:24,719
<i>You know,
She bosses people around sometimes.</i>

594
00:41:25,077 --> 00:41:27,223
<i>- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Sorry.</i>

595
00:41:27,224 --> 00:41:31,011
<i>You'll be surprised to know that
your secret santa is actually... me.</i>

596
00:41:31,873 --> 00:41:32,892
<i>Why all the clothes?</i>

597
00:41:33,036 --> 00:41:35,876
<i>Well, all the great writers
used to wear great suits.</i>

598
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:39,988
<i>So, your last present is on
a towel rack in the bathroom.</i>

599
00:41:40,023 --> 00:41:41,830
<i>Delve into our facilities.</i>

600
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,684
<i>Emerge a star.</i>

601
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:45,537
<i>Oh, Perfect!</i>

602
00:41:45,897 --> 00:41:47,595
<i>Will you hand these out while I'm gone?</i>

603
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,514
<i>Wait a second.
There's only secret santa presents.</i>

604
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,822
<i>There's rules, Charlie.</i>

605
00:41:50,823 --> 00:41:53,548
<i>Mary Elizabeth, why are
you trying to eat Christmas?</i>

606
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:55,058
<i>Hand them out, Sam.</i>

607
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:57,762
<i>Alright.
Mary Elizabeth, for you.</i>

608
00:41:59,177 --> 00:42:01,445
<i>- Alice.
- Thanks.</i>

609
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,712
<i>Bob.</i>

610
00:42:05,026 --> 00:42:06,809
<i>And this one's for me.</i>

611
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,466
<i>"Alice, I know you'll get into NYU."</i>

612
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:11,082
<i>40 dollars.</i>

613
00:42:11,117 --> 00:42:14,261
<i>"To print Punk Rocky in color next time."</i>

614
00:42:15,301 --> 00:42:16,705
<i>He knows me.</i>

615
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,139
<i>He really knows me.</i>

616
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:36,398
<i>Alright, Charlie.</i>

617
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:39,521
<i>- Come on out.
- Get out here, buddy.</i>

618
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:41,674
<i>- Come on! Charlie! Charlie!
- Charlie!</i>

619
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:43,846
<i>- Charlie! Charlie!
- Don't be shy.</i>

620
00:42:44,788 --> 00:42:45,821
<i>Come out when...</i>

621
00:42:54,843 --> 00:42:56,105
<i>Yeah!</i>

622
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:01,128
<i>What a display of man
I have ever seen!</i>

623
00:43:01,689 --> 00:43:04,693
<i>- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.</i>

624
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,482
<i>Is this your room?</i>

625
00:43:13,288 --> 00:43:14,791
<i>It's so cool.</i>

626
00:43:15,398 --> 00:43:16,468
<i>Thanks.</i>

627
00:43:21,281 --> 00:43:22,954
<i>You got me a present?</i>

628
00:43:23,585 --> 00:43:25,829
<i>After all your help on my
Penn State application?</i>

629
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,102
<i>Of course I did.</i>

630
00:43:30,186 --> 00:43:31,090
<i>Open it.</i>

631
00:43:36,757 --> 00:43:39,161
<i>- I don't know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything.</i>

632
00:44:00,716 --> 00:44:03,642
<i>I'm really sorry we
can't be here for your birthday.</i>

633
00:44:03,677 --> 00:44:04,673
<i>No, that's okay.</i>

634
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,821
<i>I'm just sorry you have to
go back and visit your dad.</i>

635
00:44:06,856 --> 00:44:09,584
<i>I'm in such a great mood,
I don't think even he could ruin it.</i>

636
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:11,464
<i>I feel like I'm finally doing good.</i>

637
00:44:12,195 --> 00:44:14,969
<i>- You are.
- Well, what about you?</i>

638
00:44:16,136 --> 00:44:19,557
<i>When I met you,
you were this scared freshman.</i>

639
00:44:21,195 --> 00:44:22,681
<i>Now look at you in that suit.</i>

640
00:44:22,716 --> 00:44:25,594
<i>You're like a sexy English school boy.</i>

641
00:44:26,088 --> 00:44:28,600
<i>- I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out.
- No.</i>

642
00:44:29,303 --> 00:44:30,465
<i>Innocent.</i>

643
00:44:31,106 --> 00:44:32,588
<i>Worst kind of guys.</i>

644
00:44:32,813 --> 00:44:35,507
<i>Never see you coming.
And parents love you.</i>

645
00:44:36,164 --> 00:44:37,286
<i>That's like...</i>

646
00:44:38,688 --> 00:44:40,101
<i>...extra danger.</i>

647
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:42,190
<i>Yeah, well, it hasn't worked so far.</i>

648
00:44:42,225 --> 00:44:44,243
<i>You've never had a girlfriend?</i>

649
00:44:44,244 --> 00:44:47,504
<i>- Not even a 2nd grade valentine?
- No.</i>

650
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:49,244
<i>Have you ever kissed a girl?</i>

651
00:44:49,576 --> 00:44:50,538
<i>No.</i>

652
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,410
<i>What about you?</i>

653
00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:01,326
<i>- Have I ever kissed a girl?
- No, no! Your first kiss...</i>

654
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:04,330
<i>I was 11.</i>

655
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:06,684
<i>His name was Robert.</i>

656
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:09,268
<i>He used to come over to
the house all the time.</i>

657
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:10,811
<i>Was he your first boyfriend?</i>

658
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:13,656
<i>He was my...</i>

659
00:45:14,267 --> 00:45:16,070
<i>He was my dad's boss.</i>

660
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,790
<i>You know Charlie, I used
to sleep with guys who...</i>

661
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,626
<i>...treated me like shit.</i>

662
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,472
<i>And get wasted all the time.</i>

663
00:45:27,629 --> 00:45:29,157
<i>But now I feel like...</i>

664
00:45:30,044 --> 00:45:31,652
<i>...I have a chance. Like I...</i>

665
00:45:32,216 --> 00:45:33,969
<i>I could even get into a real college.</i>

666
00:45:34,202 --> 00:45:36,156
<i>Well, it's true. You can do it.</i>

667
00:45:41,221 --> 00:45:42,853
<i>You really think so?</i>

668
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:48,383
<i>My Aunt...</i>

669
00:45:49,665 --> 00:45:53,421
<i>...had that same thing done to her, too.</i>

670
00:45:54,074 --> 00:45:56,804
<i>And she turned her life around.</i>

671
00:45:58,112 --> 00:45:59,498
<i>She must have been great.</i>

672
00:46:00,814 --> 00:46:03,140
<i>She was my favorite person in the world...</i>

673
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:05,236
<i>...until now.</i>

674
00:46:13,253 --> 00:46:14,586
<i>Charlie...</i>

675
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,295
<i>I know that you know I like Craig.</i>

676
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,600
<i>But I want to forget
that for a minute. Okay?</i>

677
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,270
<i>Okay.</i>

678
00:46:27,043 --> 00:46:31,264
<i>I just wanna make sure that
the first person who kisses you...</i>

679
00:46:32,024 --> 00:46:33,276
<i>...loves you.</i>

680
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:35,024
<i>Okay?</i>

681
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:40,018
<i>Okay.</i>

682
00:46:58,688 --> 00:47:00,168
<i>I love you, Charlie.</i>

683
00:47:03,676 --> 00:47:05,334
<i>I love you, too.</i>

684
00:47:20,475 --> 00:47:21,811
<i>Have a good time at your mom's.</i>

685
00:47:21,812 --> 00:47:24,408
<i>Thanks. And listen, Charlie...</i>

686
00:47:24,971 --> 00:47:27,247
<i>...because your birthday
is on Christmas Eve...</i>

687
00:47:27,282 --> 00:47:29,416
<i>...I figure you don't get
that many birthday presents.</i>

688
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,788
<i>I thought you should have my clock.
From the heart.</i>

689
00:47:33,824 --> 00:47:35,278
<i>Thank you, Patrick.</i>

690
00:47:37,514 --> 00:47:38,676
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

691
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:41,112
<i>Have a good one, guys!</i>

692
00:47:42,222 --> 00:47:43,962
<i>I love you guys!</i>

693
00:47:51,184 --> 00:47:52,264
<i>Hey!</i>

694
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:54,710
<i>Look who's here!</i>

695
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,663
<i>- Come here, little sister.
- Hey, Chris.</i>

696
00:47:59,607 --> 00:48:00,904
<i>Hey, honey.</i>

697
00:48:02,249 --> 00:48:04,224
<i>Ma, you look so thin!</i>

698
00:48:04,225 --> 00:48:05,001
<i>Thank you.</i>

699
00:48:06,223 --> 00:48:07,190
<i>Charlie...</i>

700
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,842
<i>- Come I got dinner ready.
- Oh, good.</i>

701
00:48:08,877 --> 00:48:10,684
<i>- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.</i>

702
00:48:11,904 --> 00:48:13,707
<i>Make a wish, honey.</i>

703
00:48:25,225 --> 00:48:27,194
<i>Can you see it, Charlie?</i>

704
00:48:27,711 --> 00:48:31,242
<i>The luminaria is a landing
strip for Santa Claus.</i>

705
00:48:31,824 --> 00:48:33,393
<i>Why don't you keep an eye out for him...</i>

706
00:48:33,428 --> 00:48:35,339
<i>...and I'll be right back, okay?</i>

707
00:48:37,374 --> 00:48:39,014
<i>I'm going to get your birthday present.</i>

708
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:52,536
<i>Hey.</i>

709
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,801
<i>Hey.</i>

710
00:48:56,786 --> 00:48:58,444
<i>God, I missed mom's cooking.</i>

711
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:00,572
<i>You have no idea how good you have it.</i>

712
00:49:02,846 --> 00:49:04,710
<i>I'm actually beginning to hate pizza.</i>

713
00:49:06,622 --> 00:49:08,420
<i>So how are you liking school?</i>

714
00:49:08,421 --> 00:49:11,520
<i>Well, I'm no brainiac like you or Candace.</i>

715
00:49:12,502 --> 00:49:13,713
<i>But I'm doing okay.</i>

716
00:49:13,714 --> 00:49:16,675
<i>Okay?
You're playing in a Bowl Game.</i>

717
00:49:24,576 --> 00:49:26,152
<i>How are you feeling, Charlie?</i>

718
00:49:28,989 --> 00:49:30,140
<i>Good.</i>

719
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:31,272
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

720
00:49:32,173 --> 00:49:34,107
<i>Is it bad tonight?</i>

721
00:49:34,618 --> 00:49:36,636
<i>No. No.</i>

722
00:49:39,065 --> 00:49:41,070
<i>I'm not picturing things anymore.</i>

723
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:44,109
<i>And even if I do, I can just shut it off.</i>

724
00:49:46,918 --> 00:49:49,754
<i>Well, you know, mom did say that
you have good friends now.</i>

725
00:49:50,522 --> 00:49:53,585
<i>And maybe if it does get bad again...</i>

726
00:49:54,274 --> 00:49:56,384
<i>- ...you can just talk to them, yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

727
00:49:58,187 --> 00:49:59,569
<i>Especially Sam.</i>

728
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,636
<i>She's great.</i>

729
00:50:02,118 --> 00:50:04,291
<i>I'm gonna ask her out at New Years.</i>

730
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:06,691
<i>Yeah, I think the time is right now.</i>

731
00:50:40,569 --> 00:50:42,367
<i>How long does this take to work?</i>

732
00:50:57,935 --> 00:50:59,167
<i>Shoveling snow, huh?</i>

733
00:51:00,548 --> 00:51:03,023
<i>I have to get this driveway clean.</i>

734
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:06,566
<i>And then, I'm going
to congratulate you...</i>

735
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:09,664
<i>...on being happy
because you deserve it.</i>

736
00:51:11,182 --> 00:51:14,782
<i>- You said that an hour ago.
- Was that tonight?</i>

737
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:21,674
<i>Oh, I just saw this tree,
but it was a dragon...</i>

738
00:51:22,518 --> 00:51:24,802
<i>...and then it was a tree again
and it just lied to me.</i>

739
00:51:24,828 --> 00:51:27,062
<i>Okay, Charlie. Don't freak out.
Give me the...</i>

740
00:51:28,004 --> 00:51:29,088
<i>Calm down.</i>

741
00:51:33,052 --> 00:51:33,984
<i>Look up.</i>

742
00:51:37,116 --> 00:51:38,218
<i>Isn't it quiet?</i>

743
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:43,953
<i>Sam, do you think that if people knew...</i>

744
00:51:43,988 --> 00:51:47,776
<i>...how crazy you really were,
no one would ever talk to you?</i>

745
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,222
<i>All the time.</i>

746
00:51:55,418 --> 00:51:57,502
<i>So, you wanna wear these glasses?</i>

747
00:51:59,946 --> 00:52:01,429
<i>They'll protect you.</i>

748
00:53:23,883 --> 00:53:27,627
<i>10-9-8-7-6...</i>

749
00:53:27,628 --> 00:53:31,372
<i>...5-4-3-2-1...</i>

750
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,201
<i>It's gonna be our little secret.</i>

751
00:53:35,934 --> 00:53:38,205
<i>...Happy New Year!</i>

752
00:54:33,563 --> 00:54:35,444
<i>Did your older friends pressure you?</i>

753
00:54:35,445 --> 00:54:37,945
<i>No one pressured me, officer.</i>

754
00:54:38,536 --> 00:54:41,770
<i>I would never do drugs. Never.</i>

755
00:54:41,805 --> 00:54:45,386
<i>Then, how did you happen to be passed out
on the ground at 6 in the morning?</i>

756
00:54:46,748 --> 00:54:50,746
<i>Well, I... you know, I was really tired...</i>

757
00:54:51,227 --> 00:54:53,902
<i>...and I was feeling feverish.</i>

758
00:54:54,045 --> 00:54:58,959
<i>So, I went outside for a walk,
just to get some cold air.</i>

759
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,264
<i>I started seeing things.
So, I passed out.</i>

760
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,406
<i>You're seeing things again, Charlie?</i>

761
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:05,847
<i>Not... Not really.</i>

762
00:55:12,703 --> 00:55:14,054
<i>Nice suit.</i>

763
00:55:15,786 --> 00:55:17,561
<i>It was a Christmas present.</i>

764
00:55:22,378 --> 00:55:23,847
<i>Did you have fun on your break?</i>

765
00:55:24,482 --> 00:55:27,257
<i>More fun than you're
gonna have today, Sinatra.</i>

766
00:55:30,229 --> 00:55:32,164
<i>Nice look, jag off.</i>

767
00:55:35,078 --> 00:55:36,600
<i>I called him 30 times.</i>

768
00:55:36,635 --> 00:55:39,085
<i>Well what are we supposed to do?
We're going on in 10 minutes!</i>

769
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:41,488
<i>- They said in health class...
- Hello?</i>

770
00:55:41,523 --> 00:55:44,248
<i>I know. They say that
about LSD just to scare you.</i>

771
00:55:44,283 --> 00:55:45,156
<i>Are you sure?</i>

772
00:55:45,814 --> 00:55:47,217
<i>Charlie, you're fine, man.</i>

773
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:49,833
<i>Guys, we have an emergency.</i>

774
00:55:49,868 --> 00:55:52,688
<i>Craig has flaked out on us again.
So, I need a Rocky.</i>

775
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,439
<i>- Brad?
- No, No way.</i>

776
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,407
<i>No, I'm not...
There are people out here. No.</i>

777
00:56:01,322 --> 00:56:02,768
<i>Charlie...</i>

778
00:56:03,143 --> 00:56:04,326
<i>...take off your clothes.</i>

779
00:56:10,955 --> 00:56:16,768
<i>¶¶ Then if anything grows
while you pose ¶¶</i>

780
00:56:16,803 --> 00:56:22,354
<i>¶¶ I'll oil you up and drop you down ¶¶
¶¶ Down, Down Down ¶¶</i>

781
00:56:22,576 --> 00:56:27,864
<i>¶¶ And that's just one small
fraction of the main attraction ¶¶</i>

782
00:56:28,521 --> 00:56:30,870
<i>¶¶ You need a friendly hand ¶¶</i>

783
00:56:31,364 --> 00:56:33,587
<i>¶¶ And I need action ¶¶</i>

784
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:36,263
<i>¶¶ Touch a touch a touch me ¶¶</i>

785
00:56:36,557 --> 00:56:38,831
<i>¶¶ I wanna be dirty ¶¶</i>

786
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:41,490
<i>¶¶ Thrill me. Chill me. Fulfill me ¶¶</i>

787
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,550
<i>¶¶ Creature of the night ¶¶</i>

788
00:56:44,808 --> 00:56:46,200
<i>¶¶ Creature of our night ¶¶</i>

789
00:56:47,296 --> 00:56:48,773
<i>¶¶ Creature of our night? ¶¶</i>

790
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:51,687
<i>¶¶ Creature of our night ¶¶</i>

791
00:56:52,598 --> 00:56:54,528
<i>¶¶ Creature of our night ¶¶</i>

792
00:56:55,262 --> 00:56:56,887
<i>¶¶ Creature of our night ¶¶</i>

793
00:56:57,819 --> 00:57:00,359
<i>¶¶ Creature of our night ¶¶</i>

794
00:57:00,646 --> 00:57:02,093
<i>¶¶ Creature of our night ¶¶</i>

795
00:57:03,705 --> 00:57:05,161
<i>¶¶ Creature of our night ¶¶</i>

796
00:57:13,551 --> 00:57:16,076
<i>Maybe I could join the cast as an
alternate or something?</i>

797
00:57:16,736 --> 00:57:19,239
<i>Well, we're filled up now, but...</i>

798
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,944
<i>...they're gonna need people
when we go to college.</i>

799
00:57:21,979 --> 00:57:24,709
<i>I could put in a good word for you.</i>

800
00:57:24,995 --> 00:57:27,060
<i>- That'd be great. Thanks.
- Yeah.</i>

801
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:32,141
<i>Charlie...</i>

802
00:57:32,848 --> 00:57:35,656
<i>Have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance?</i>

803
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,879
<i>The one where the girl asks the guy.</i>

804
00:57:38,161 --> 00:57:42,085
<i>Obviously, it is completely
stupid and sexist.</i>

805
00:57:42,086 --> 00:57:44,443
<i>I mean it's like,
"Hey, thanks for the crumb."</i>

806
00:57:44,444 --> 00:57:48,725
<i>And normally, I'd just blow it off
because school dances suck torture.</i>

807
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,373
<i>But, you know, it's my last year, and...</i>

808
00:57:55,756 --> 00:57:59,486
<i>- Would you maybe wanna go with me?
- You wanna go with me?</i>

809
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:01,696
<i>I'm sick of macho guys.</i>

810
00:58:02,183 --> 00:58:04,513
<i>Plus, you looked
really cute in your costume.</i>

811
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,437
<i>So, what do you say?</i>

812
00:58:11,315 --> 00:58:13,931
<i>- You must be Mary Elizabeth.
- Yes.</i>

813
00:58:13,966 --> 00:58:17,268
<i>- It's so nice to meet you.
- You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis.</i>

814
00:58:17,303 --> 00:58:19,357
<i>Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist.</i>

815
00:58:19,882 --> 00:58:21,850
<i>- Please come in.
- Okay.</i>

816
00:58:22,587 --> 00:58:25,159
<i>A little closer together.
That looks nice.</i>

817
00:58:25,638 --> 00:58:28,935
<i>Buddhist, I need you to smile
a little bit more. There you go. Nice.</i>

818
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:05,049
<i>Are you having a good time?</i>

819
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,916
<i>Not really. How about you?</i>

820
00:59:11,511 --> 00:59:13,188
<i>I mean, I don't know.</i>

821
00:59:13,223 --> 00:59:15,714
<i>It's my first date,
I don't know what to compare it to.</i>

822
00:59:16,848 --> 00:59:18,307
<i>You're doing fine.</i>

823
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:23,524
<i>I'm sorry Craig couldn't come.</i>

824
00:59:25,233 --> 00:59:29,596
<i>Yeah. He said he didn't want to
go to some stupid high school dance.</i>

825
00:59:29,597 --> 00:59:31,050
<i>Can't say I blame him, really.</i>

826
00:59:32,324 --> 00:59:35,554
<i>I don't know.
If you like it, he should come.</i>

827
00:59:41,071 --> 00:59:42,797
<i>Thanks, Charlie.</i>

828
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:48,518
<i>Have a beautiful first date.
You deserve it.</i>

829
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,262
<i>I'll try not to make you too jealous.</i>

830
01:00:05,286 --> 01:00:06,454
<i>Now, just let it breathe.</i>

831
01:00:18,744 --> 01:00:20,240
<i>This is sure a nice house.</i>

832
01:00:20,849 --> 01:00:21,970
<i>Thanks.</i>

833
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:28,620
<i>Don't you just love old music?</i>

834
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,016
<i>Yeah.</i>

835
01:00:31,475 --> 01:00:33,829
<i>Good. Because I made you a mix of it.</i>

836
01:00:36,013 --> 01:00:39,173
<i>I'd love to expose you to great things.</i>

837
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:42,106
<i>Like Billie Holiday and foreign films.</i>

838
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:44,747
<i>This merlot is really fancy.</i>

839
01:00:45,098 --> 01:00:47,601
<i>Yeah. My dad collects wine,
but he doesn't drink.</i>

840
01:00:48,042 --> 01:00:49,625
<i>It's kinda weird, isn't it?</i>

841
01:00:49,835 --> 01:00:50,837
<i>I guess.</i>

842
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:53,030
<i>Where are your parents?</i>

843
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:56,120
<i>Their club is hosting
a cotillion or something racist.</i>

844
01:00:58,056 --> 01:01:00,078
<i>They'll be gone all night.</i>

845
01:01:06,194 --> 01:01:08,001
<i>That's sure a nice fire.</i>

846
01:01:09,297 --> 01:01:10,299
<i>Yeah.</i>

847
01:01:10,966 --> 01:01:12,492
<i>When I'm done being a lobbyist...</i>

848
01:01:12,493 --> 01:01:15,025
<i>...I wanna move to a house
like this in Cape Cod.</i>

849
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,726
<i>- Sounds nice, doesn't it?
- Yeah.</i>

850
01:01:23,811 --> 01:01:25,594
<i>Your heart is beating really fast.</i>

851
01:01:25,965 --> 01:01:27,227
<i>Is it?</i>

852
01:01:27,587 --> 01:01:29,400
<i>Here, feel.</i>

853
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:36,709
<i>- Charlie?
- Uh-huh.</i>

854
01:01:38,645 --> 01:01:40,783
<i>- Do you like me?
- Uh-huh.</i>

855
01:01:40,818 --> 01:01:41,801
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

856
01:01:42,422 --> 01:01:43,493
<i>I think so.</i>

857
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:45,567
<i>Don't be nervous.</i>

858
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:24,941
<i>Charlie...</i>

859
01:02:27,716 --> 01:02:30,100
<i>...I didn't know how tonight
was gonna go tonight, but...</i>

860
01:02:30,973 --> 01:02:33,676
<i>- ...it was really nice, wasn't it?
- Yeah.</i>

861
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,843
<i>I just can't believe it.</i>

862
01:02:39,185 --> 01:02:40,737
<i>You of all people.</i>

863
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,021
<i>I just can't believe you're my boyfriend.</i>

864
01:02:48,796 --> 01:02:51,141
<i>Shit!
My parents! Shit!</i>

865
01:02:51,176 --> 01:02:54,063
<i>- Here, zip this up!
- Okay. No, no, I got this. Yeah.</i>

866
01:02:54,345 --> 01:02:56,821
<i>- Just zip it up, like a normal zipper!
- Stuck. It's just...</i>

867
01:02:56,993 --> 01:02:57,755
<i>Thank you.</i>

868
01:02:58,771 --> 01:02:59,873
<i>See you Monday.</i>

869
01:03:01,251 --> 01:03:02,673
<i>Dear Friend...</i>

870
01:03:03,498 --> 01:03:06,269
<i>I'm sorry I haven't
written for awhile, but...</i>

871
01:03:06,822 --> 01:03:09,457
<i>...things are a total disaster.</i>

872
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,138
<i>We're literally making out,
and I'm in my bra.</i>

873
01:03:13,173 --> 01:03:15,256
<i>Hello! And the front door
opens. It's my parents!</i>

874
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,975
<i>I probably should have been
honest about how I didn't...</i>

875
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:20,660
<i>...want to go out with Mary
Elizabeth after Sadie's, but...</i>

876
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:23,244
<i>...I really didn't want
to hurt her feelings.</i>

877
01:03:24,472 --> 01:03:26,916
<i>You see, Mary Elizabeth
is a really nice person...</i>

878
01:03:26,951 --> 01:03:29,361
<i>...underneath the part of
her that hates everyone.</i>

879
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:30,362
<i>Hey!</i>

880
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:33,086
<i>And since I heard that having
a girlfriend makes you happy...</i>

881
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:35,748
<i>...I tried hard to love her
like I love Sam.</i>

882
01:03:35,783 --> 01:03:38,059
<i>Can you believe it's almost
our two week anniversary?</i>

883
01:03:38,094 --> 01:03:39,246
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

884
01:03:39,887 --> 01:03:41,521
<i>So, I took her on double dates.</i>

885
01:03:41,811 --> 01:03:43,644
<i>Your first foreign film.</i>

886
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:48,673
<i>- Do you want butter in your popcorn?
- Vegans don't eat butter.</i>

887
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,368
<i>And I tried not to mind that
she loves to hold hands...</i>

888
01:03:51,403 --> 01:03:53,232
<i>...even when her hands are sweaty.</i>

889
01:03:57,010 --> 01:04:00,815
<i>And I had to admit something
really upsetting. But...</i>

890
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:04,279
<i>I'm tired of touching her boobs.</i>

891
01:04:05,114 --> 01:04:08,222
<i>I thought maybe if she
would just let me pick...</i>

892
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:11,301
<i>...the make-out music once in awhile,
we might have a chance.</i>

893
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:16,170
<i>And maybe if she didn't put down the
books that Mr. Anderson gives me.</i>

894
01:04:17,411 --> 01:04:20,252
<i>Walden?
I read this in 7th grade.</i>

895
01:04:21,227 --> 01:04:23,756
<i>I would have called it
"On Boring Pond."</i>

896
01:04:24,002 --> 01:04:27,719
<i>Or if she would stop calling me
the minute I get home from school...</i>

897
01:04:27,754 --> 01:04:32,760
<i>...when I have absolutely nothing to talk
about other than the bus ride home.</i>

898
01:04:34,284 --> 01:04:36,779
<i>Somehow she finds me things to say.</i>

899
01:04:36,979 --> 01:04:39,969
<i>That dairy just sits with you.
You know, it walks with you.</i>

900
01:04:40,004 --> 01:04:41,376
<i>She's on the phone right now?</i>

901
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,414
<i>Charlie, you've gotta break up with her.</i>

902
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:44,621
<i>I can do that?</i>

903
01:04:44,656 --> 01:04:46,848
<i>For Christ's sake...
I need to use the phone!</i>

904
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,443
<i>I'll give you this book.
It's really how I became a vegan...</i>

905
01:04:49,478 --> 01:04:51,026
<i>I know I should have been honest...</i>

906
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:54,530
<i>...but I was getting so mad,
it was starting to scare me.</i>

907
01:04:56,128 --> 01:04:59,469
<i>I just wish I could have found
another way to break up.</i>

908
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:02,965
<i>- Um... Mary Elizabeth. Can I talk to you...
- Charlie. Please, don't interrupt.</i>

909
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:03,749
<i>You know I hate that.</i>

910
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,439
<i>In hindsight, I probably
could not have picked...</i>

911
01:05:06,474 --> 01:05:08,589
<i>...a worse way to be honest
with Mary Elizabeth.</i>

912
01:05:08,979 --> 01:05:11,219
<i>- Truth or dare?
- Who are you talking to?</i>

913
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:15,724
<i>I dare you... to kiss Alice.</i>

914
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:20,504
<i>Courage your lions, procreator.</i>

915
01:05:23,235 --> 01:05:24,042
<i>Mary Elizabeth?</i>

916
01:05:24,043 --> 01:05:26,080
<i>Samantha told me that
you got into Harvard.</i>

917
01:05:26,115 --> 01:05:28,602
<i>- Congratulations.
- Thank you.</i>

918
01:05:28,637 --> 01:05:30,883
<i>This one still hasn't gotten me flowers.</i>

919
01:05:31,196 --> 01:05:32,527
<i>But I forgive you.</i>

920
01:05:34,172 --> 01:05:36,431
<i>Hey, don't worry about Penn State.</i>

921
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,672
<i>- You're just wait-listed.
- Yeah.</i>

922
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:43,858
<i>You guys are about to miss
some severely hot "fag on goth" action.</i>

923
01:05:50,907 --> 01:05:53,001
<i>- Get a room!
- You're a monster!</i>

924
01:05:53,455 --> 01:05:56,159
<i>My turn. Um... let's see...</i>

925
01:05:56,937 --> 01:05:59,093
<i>Let's think... Charlie?</i>

926
01:05:59,674 --> 01:06:02,238
<i>- Truth.
- How's your first relationship going?</i>

927
01:06:02,749 --> 01:06:04,612
<i>It's so bad...</i>

928
01:06:04,647 --> 01:06:08,681
<i>...that I keep fantasizing that
one of us is dying of cancer...</i>

929
01:06:08,682 --> 01:06:11,857
<i>...so that I don't have to
break up with her.</i>

930
01:06:13,737 --> 01:06:14,808
<i>Charlie?</i>

931
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:17,692
<i>Truth or dare?
Hello?</i>

932
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:21,661
<i>- Dare.
- Okay.</i>

933
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:27,119
<i>I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl
in the room on the lips.</i>

934
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:29,805
<i>And notice I charitably
said girl and not person...</i>

935
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,456
<i>...because let's face it,
I'd smoke all you bitches.</i>

936
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,056
<i>Now that's fucked up.</i>

937
01:06:48,574 --> 01:06:51,077
<i>Mary Elizabeth...</i>

938
01:06:51,078 --> 01:06:52,418
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

939
01:06:53,582 --> 01:06:55,605
<i>It was a mistake. I'm sorry.</i>

940
01:06:56,526 --> 01:06:58,298
<i>Sam! Sam!</i>

941
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:00,543
<i>I really didn't mean
anything by it. I'm sorry.</i>

942
01:07:01,996 --> 01:07:03,648
<i>What the hell is wrong with you?</i>

943
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,748
<i>I should go back and apologize.</i>

944
01:07:07,783 --> 01:07:10,779
<i>No, Charlie, Trust me.
You don't want to go back there.</i>

945
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:12,057
<i>But, I'm really sorry.</i>

946
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:13,973
<i>I didn't mean to do anything...</i>

947
01:07:14,008 --> 01:07:15,462
<i>I know you didn't...</i>

948
01:07:15,914 --> 01:07:17,271
<i>...but look.</i>

949
01:07:20,389 --> 01:07:22,322
<i>I hate to be the one to break this...</i>

950
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:26,344
<i>...but there's history with
Mary Elizabeth and Sam.</i>

951
01:07:26,379 --> 01:07:28,057
<i>Other guys.</i>

952
01:07:28,092 --> 01:07:29,895
<i>Things that have nothing
to do with you.</i>

953
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:33,827
<i>But it's best if you stay away for awhile.</i>

954
01:07:35,741 --> 01:07:37,119
<i>Oh, Okay.</i>

955
01:07:41,947 --> 01:07:43,884
<i>How long do you think?</i>

956
01:07:51,654 --> 01:07:56,701
<i>Dear friend, I have not seen
my friends for 2 weeks now.</i>

957
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:06,425
<i>I am starting to get bad again.</i>

958
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:14,899
<i>Charlie. Come on, get dressed.</i>

959
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,713
<i>We're going to be late for Easter Mass.</i>

960
01:08:16,748 --> 01:08:19,512
<i>I'll... I'll be there in a minute.</i>

961
01:08:22,247 --> 01:08:24,501
<i>Our Father who art in Heaven.</i>

962
01:08:24,502 --> 01:08:27,687
<i>Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come.</i>

963
01:08:27,897 --> 01:08:30,854
<i>Thy will be done on
earth as it is in Heaven.</i>

964
01:08:30,855 --> 01:08:33,039
<i>Give us this day our daily bread.</i>

965
01:08:33,237 --> 01:08:38,344
<i>And forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.</i>

966
01:08:42,099 --> 01:08:45,011
<i>And lead us not into temptation.
But deliver us...</i>

967
01:08:45,046 --> 01:08:46,121
<i>Mary Elizabeth...</i>

968
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:49,241
<i>I've been listening to the
Billie Holiday CD like every night...</i>

969
01:08:49,276 --> 01:08:50,976
<i>It's too late, Charlie.</i>

970
01:08:51,011 --> 01:08:54,461
<i>Look, I know. I just feel really
bad about what I did.</i>

971
01:08:55,037 --> 01:08:58,469
<i>I just get so messed up inside
like I'm not there or something.</i>

972
01:08:58,504 --> 01:08:59,812
<i>Tell it to someone who cares.</i>

973
01:08:59,847 --> 01:09:02,969
<i>I know. I'm sorry. I just...
We've all become such good friends...</i>

974
01:09:03,004 --> 01:09:04,287
<i>Good friends?</i>

975
01:09:04,288 --> 01:09:07,115
<i>Do you mean the people that
I've known since kindergarten...</i>

976
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:10,465
<i>...and you've known for 6 months?
Those good friends?</i>

977
01:09:10,466 --> 01:09:12,629
<i>Yeah. I mean I just don't want to
do anything to ruin our relat...</i>

978
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:15,837
<i>It's ruined. Okay?
So, stop calling everyone.</i>

979
01:09:15,872 --> 01:09:17,823
<i>Stop embarrassing yourself.</i>

980
01:09:17,858 --> 01:09:20,413
<i>Okay. I will. Goodb...</i>

981
01:09:25,764 --> 01:09:27,294
<i>Something's wrong with me.</i>

982
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:28,816
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

983
01:09:30,926 --> 01:09:33,986
<i>Hey, you heard from Patrick?</i>

984
01:09:33,987 --> 01:09:36,146
<i>No. He told me to stay away.</i>

985
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:38,777
<i>Oh. You don't know?</i>

986
01:09:39,135 --> 01:09:41,526
<i>Why? Why? What happened?</i>

987
01:09:41,527 --> 01:09:43,957
<i>Brad's father caught them together.</i>

988
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:52,239
<i>- Some kids jumped him outside the O.
- It was some kids from North Hills.</i>

989
01:09:52,669 --> 01:09:53,682
<i>Did you see his face?</i>

990
01:09:54,853 --> 01:09:56,545
<i>- What happened?
- It's not what I heard.</i>

991
01:09:59,471 --> 01:10:02,944
<i>- Are you okay?
- Not now, Charlie. I'm sorry.</i>

992
01:10:11,859 --> 01:10:12,749
<i>Hey, nothing.</i>

993
01:10:22,258 --> 01:10:23,813
<i>Sorry, Nothing.</i>

994
01:10:35,213 --> 01:10:37,879
<i>- You gonna do anything?
- What are you talking about?</i>

995
01:10:37,914 --> 01:10:40,517
<i>I'm talking about your
pet ape just tripped me.</i>

996
01:10:40,518 --> 01:10:42,252
<i>Are you gonna say something?</i>

997
01:10:43,482 --> 01:10:45,963
<i>- Why would I?
- You know why.</i>

998
01:10:46,382 --> 01:10:49,049
<i>This is pathetic, man.
Your fixation on me.</i>

999
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:51,635
<i>Do you want your friends to know
how you got those bruises? Really?</i>

1000
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:54,865
<i>- I got jumped in a parking lot.
- Where? Schenley Park?</i>

1001
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,971
<i>Do you guys know about Schenley Park?</i>

1002
01:10:57,803 --> 01:11:00,050
<i>I don't know what kind of
sick shit you're trying to pull.</i>

1003
01:11:00,051 --> 01:11:02,080
<i>But you better walk away now...</i>

1004
01:11:04,156 --> 01:11:05,490
<i>...Nothing.</i>

1005
01:11:06,233 --> 01:11:07,486
<i>Fine.</i>

1006
01:11:08,827 --> 01:11:10,669
<i>Say hi to your dad for me.</i>

1007
01:11:13,778 --> 01:11:15,330
<i>Whatever, faggot.</i>

1008
01:11:18,949 --> 01:11:21,137
<i>- What did you just call me?
- I called you a faggo...</i>

1009
01:11:36,031 --> 01:11:38,683
<i>Say that shit again!
Say that shit again!</i>

1010
01:11:38,718 --> 01:11:39,871
<i>It's Patrick!</i>

1011
01:11:41,499 --> 01:11:43,176
<i>No! No!</i>

1012
01:11:51,636 --> 01:11:54,450
<i>Stop! Please, they don't stop!</i>

1013
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:32,143
<i>Touch my friends again
and I'll blind you.</i>

1014
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:44,206
<i>- Charlie?
- Yeah?</i>

1015
01:12:46,019 --> 01:12:47,219
<i>Thanks for stopping them.</i>

1016
01:12:49,853 --> 01:12:50,870
<i>Sure, Brad.</i>

1017
01:13:12,892 --> 01:13:14,464
<i>How you doing, Charlie?</i>

1018
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:16,369
<i>I don't know.</i>

1019
01:13:16,854 --> 01:13:19,707
<i>I keep trying, but I can't
really remember what I did.</i>

1020
01:13:21,077 --> 01:13:22,413
<i>Do you want me to tell you?</i>

1021
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:25,656
<i>Yeah.</i>

1022
01:13:25,691 --> 01:13:27,738
<i>You saved my brother.</i>

1023
01:13:28,888 --> 01:13:30,453
<i>That's what you did.</i>

1024
01:13:31,054 --> 01:13:33,356
<i>- So, you're not gonna scare of me?
- No.</i>

1025
01:13:36,471 --> 01:13:37,730
<i>Can we be friends again?</i>

1026
01:13:37,765 --> 01:13:39,382
<i>Of course.</i>

1027
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:48,682
<i>Come on.</i>

1028
01:13:51,365 --> 01:13:52,687
<i>Let's go be psychos together.</i>

1029
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,128
<i>I'm dating Peter now.</i>

1030
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,865
<i>He's in college with Craig.</i>

1031
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:07,297
<i>He's opinionated, and we
have intellectual debates.</i>

1032
01:14:07,606 --> 01:14:11,236
<i>You were very sweet, but our
relationship was too one-sided.</i>

1033
01:14:11,754 --> 01:14:13,570
<i>I know this is hard for you.</i>

1034
01:14:14,852 --> 01:14:16,876
<i>I'm just glad you're happy.</i>

1035
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:17,847
<i>Okay.</i>

1036
01:14:23,223 --> 01:14:26,186
<i>Hey, Craig, Sam will be down soon.</i>

1037
01:14:27,431 --> 01:14:28,619
<i>We're gonna miss the movie.</i>

1038
01:14:28,654 --> 01:14:31,307
<i>Yeah, I'll go put
some pep in her step.</i>

1039
01:14:34,592 --> 01:14:37,395
<i>Hey, do you wanna get out of here?</i>

1040
01:14:37,717 --> 01:14:39,474
<i>Sure, Patrick</i>

1041
01:14:42,192 --> 01:14:44,261
<i>I'll tell you something, Charlie.
I feel good.</i>

1042
01:14:44,262 --> 01:14:45,229
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

1043
01:14:45,264 --> 01:14:48,268
<i>And maybe tomorrow I'll take you
to this karaoke place downtown.</i>

1044
01:14:48,678 --> 01:14:51,034
<i>And this club off the strip.
They don't card.</i>

1045
01:14:51,035 --> 01:14:52,519
<i>And the Schenley Park scene.</i>

1046
01:14:52,995 --> 01:14:55,352
<i>You have to see the
"fruit loop" at least one time.</i>

1047
01:15:07,926 --> 01:15:09,087
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1048
01:15:09,122 --> 01:15:11,969
<i>My life is officially
an after school special.</i>

1049
01:15:12,401 --> 01:15:13,579
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

1050
01:15:14,563 --> 01:15:15,523
<i>It really is.</i>

1051
01:15:16,422 --> 01:15:17,734
<i>It so is.</i>

1052
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:24,805
<i>So, you ever hear the
one about Lily Miller?</i>

1053
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,691
<i>- I don't know.
- Really?</i>

1054
01:15:27,416 --> 01:15:29,753
<i>I thought your brother would
have told you. It's a classic.</i>

1055
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,683
<i>- Maybe.
- Okay.</i>

1056
01:15:31,912 --> 01:15:35,068
<i>Lily comes here one night
with this guy Parker.</i>

1057
01:15:35,103 --> 01:15:38,642
<i>And this was to be the night that
they were gonna lose their virginity.</i>

1058
01:15:38,677 --> 01:15:41,536
<i>So, she did it really proper.
She packed a picnic.</i>

1059
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:43,140
<i>Stole a bottle of wine.</i>

1060
01:15:43,597 --> 01:15:47,798
<i>Everything was perfect,
and they're just about to 'do it'...</i>

1061
01:15:48,331 --> 01:15:50,858
<i>...when they realize they
forgot the condoms.</i>

1062
01:15:50,893 --> 01:15:53,415
<i>- So, what do you think happened?
- I don't know.</i>

1063
01:15:54,288 --> 01:15:56,237
<i>They did it with one of the sandwich bags.</i>

1064
01:15:56,983 --> 01:15:58,211
<i>Ew!</i>

1065
01:15:59,785 --> 01:16:02,871
<i>- Oh, that's disgusting!
- Yes! It is!</i>

1066
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:05,609
<i>Come on.
Let's keep the train rolling.</i>

1067
01:16:05,953 --> 01:16:08,035
<i>Suburban legend. Charlie!</i>

1068
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:09,902
<i>Well...</i>

1069
01:16:09,937 --> 01:16:12,692
<i>There was this girl named
Second Base Stace.</i>

1070
01:16:13,182 --> 01:16:16,660
<i>And... well, She had boobs
in the like 4th grade...</i>

1071
01:16:16,695 --> 01:16:18,926
<i>Mosquito bites. Promising. Go.</i>

1072
01:16:18,961 --> 01:16:22,331
<i>And she let some
of the guys feel them.</i>

1073
01:16:23,988 --> 01:16:26,032
<i>That's your suburban legend?</i>

1074
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:28,753
<i>- Did you at least cop a feel?
- Yeah.</i>

1075
01:16:28,754 --> 01:16:30,355
<i>- No.
- No, of course not.</i>

1076
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:34,288
<i>You went home,
listened to "Asleep", wrote a poem...</i>

1077
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:36,727
<i>Fine! Okay. Your turn.</i>

1078
01:16:41,872 --> 01:16:43,124
<i>Yeah, I've got one.</i>

1079
01:16:45,525 --> 01:16:46,707
<i>Well...</i>

1080
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:51,371
<i>There was this one guy.
Queer as a 3 dollar bill.</i>

1081
01:16:52,102 --> 01:16:54,432
<i>The guy's father
doesn't know about his son.</i>

1082
01:16:55,608 --> 01:16:58,736
<i>So, he comes
into the basement one night...</i>

1083
01:16:58,737 --> 01:17:00,476
<i>...when he's supposed to be out of town.</i>

1084
01:17:01,257 --> 01:17:03,819
<i>Catches his son with another boy.</i>

1085
01:17:04,842 --> 01:17:06,641
<i>So, he starts beating him.</i>

1086
01:17:06,642 --> 01:17:10,032
<i>But not like the slap kind.
Like the real kind.</i>

1087
01:17:13,828 --> 01:17:17,764
<i>And the boyfriend says,
"Stop. You're killing him."</i>

1088
01:17:19,527 --> 01:17:22,091
<i>But the son just yells "Get out."</i>

1089
01:17:23,796 --> 01:17:24,807
<i>And...</i>

1090
01:17:25,292 --> 01:17:26,915
<i>...eventually...</i>

1091
01:17:28,031 --> 01:17:31,276
<i>...the boyfriend just did.</i>

1092
01:17:38,078 --> 01:17:39,776
<i>Why can't you save anybody?</i>

1093
01:17:42,274 --> 01:17:43,782
<i>I don't know.</i>

1094
01:17:46,314 --> 01:17:47,754
<i>Forget it.</i>

1095
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:49,767
<i>I'm free now, right?</i>

1096
01:17:51,019 --> 01:17:53,548
<i>I could meet the
love of my life any second.</i>

1097
01:17:54,734 --> 01:17:57,774
<i>Things will be different now,
and that's good.</i>

1098
01:17:57,775 --> 01:17:59,843
<i>I just need to meet a good guy...</i>

1099
01:18:01,497 --> 01:18:02,729
<i>Yeah.</i>

1100
01:18:16,068 --> 01:18:17,379
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1101
01:18:17,414 --> 01:18:18,690
<i>It's alright.</i>

1102
01:18:19,742 --> 01:18:21,038
<i>It's alright.</i>

1103
01:18:25,591 --> 01:18:28,300
<i>I've been spending
a lot of time with Patrick.</i>

1104
01:18:29,089 --> 01:18:31,107
<i>He begins every night really excited.</i>

1105
01:18:32,473 --> 01:18:36,016
<i>He always says he feels free,
and tonight is his destiny.</i>

1106
01:18:36,854 --> 01:18:39,802
<i>But after awhile, he runs out
of things to keep himself numb.</i>

1107
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:45,214
<i>Then, Sam got her letter from Penn State.</i>

1108
01:18:51,983 --> 01:18:55,016
<i>"We will require you to take our
summer session at the main campus...</i>

1109
01:18:55,051 --> 01:18:57,449
<i>...immediately following your
high school graduation."</i>

1110
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:02,670
<i>She got in, Charlie.</i>

1111
01:19:14,163 --> 01:19:18,316
<i>After that all Patrick could talk about
was college and all their futures.</i>

1112
01:19:19,074 --> 01:19:21,804
<i>Alice did get into NYU Film School.</i>

1113
01:19:21,839 --> 01:19:24,189
<i>Patrick is going to the
University of Washington...</i>

1114
01:19:24,224 --> 01:19:26,539
<i>...because he wants to be
near the music in Seattle.</i>

1115
01:19:27,922 --> 01:19:32,359
<i>But he wasn't going to leave without
organizing the best senior prank ever.</i>

1116
01:19:39,124 --> 01:19:41,917
<i>Sam is going to leave
right after graduation.</i>

1117
01:19:41,918 --> 01:19:44,098
<i>It all feels very exciting.</i>

1118
01:19:44,133 --> 01:19:46,045
<i>I just wish it were happening to me.</i>

1119
01:19:46,925 --> 01:19:50,899
<i>Especially because ever since
I blacked out in the cafeteria...</i>

1120
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,617
<i>...it's been getting worse.</i>

1121
01:19:52,652 --> 01:19:54,746
<i>And I can't turn it off this time.</i>

1122
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:59,584
<i>Guys, you want to pass your copies
of Gatsby up to the front please?</i>

1123
01:20:00,105 --> 01:20:01,378
<i>And I know it's the last day...</i>

1124
01:20:01,413 --> 01:20:04,106
<i>...but if we could just
keep it to a dull roar...</i>

1125
01:20:04,107 --> 01:20:05,195
<i>...I'd appreciate it.</i>

1126
01:20:06,276 --> 01:20:07,169
<i>Thank you.</i>

1127
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:10,462
<i>Guys, guys,
Thank you for such a great year.</i>

1128
01:20:10,497 --> 01:20:12,507
<i>I had a blast.
I hope you did, too.</i>

1129
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:15,237
<i>And I hope you have a great time
this summer on your vacations.</i>

1130
01:20:15,272 --> 01:20:17,932
<i>Now, who here is gonna read
for pleasure this summer?</i>

1131
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,454
<i>Charlie, Very good.</i>

1132
01:20:31,421 --> 01:20:33,153
<i>Last day.</i>

1133
01:20:33,188 --> 01:20:34,886
<i>Yeah.</i>

1134
01:20:35,637 --> 01:20:39,173
<i>So, I know it's none of my business,
but have you decided?</i>

1135
01:20:39,965 --> 01:20:41,597
<i>I mean, are you going to New York?</i>

1136
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:46,696
<i>Well, my wife and I like it here.</i>

1137
01:20:48,336 --> 01:20:50,923
<i>And I think I might be better
at teaching than writing.</i>

1138
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:54,068
<i>You know, Charlie.
I was thinking that...</i>

1139
01:20:55,896 --> 01:20:58,169
<i>...Maybe I could still give
you books next year.</i>

1140
01:20:58,405 --> 01:20:59,945
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

1141
01:21:00,448 --> 01:21:02,601
<i>I think you could write
one of them one day.</i>

1142
01:21:03,974 --> 01:21:04,946
<i>Really?</i>

1143
01:21:05,331 --> 01:21:06,332
<i>I do.</i>

1144
01:21:09,409 --> 01:21:11,356
<i>You're the best teacher I've ever had.</i>

1145
01:21:12,137 --> 01:21:13,179
<i>Thank you.</i>

1146
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:27,224
<i>10, 9, 8, 7, 6...</i>

1147
01:21:27,225 --> 01:21:29,706
<i>...5, 4, 3, 2...</i>

1148
01:21:29,741 --> 01:21:31,810
<i>- Let's get the hell out of here!
- One!</i>

1149
01:21:38,487 --> 01:21:39,745
<i>Dear Friend...</i>

1150
01:21:40,157 --> 01:21:42,304
<i>I wanted to tell you about us running.</i>

1151
01:21:42,745 --> 01:21:44,623
<i>There was this beautiful sunset.</i>

1152
01:21:44,658 --> 01:21:47,120
<i>And just a few hours
before, everyone I love...</i>

1153
01:21:47,155 --> 01:21:49,462
<i>...had their last day
of high school ever.</i>

1154
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,675
<i>And I was happy
because they were happy...</i>

1155
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:53,878
<i>...even though I counted,
and I have...</i>

1156
01:21:54,604 --> 01:21:57,326
<i>...1,095 days to go.</i>

1157
01:21:58,769 --> 01:22:01,095
<i>I kept imagining what school
would be like without them...</i>

1158
01:22:01,096 --> 01:22:03,285
<i>...as they they were all
getting ready for their prom.</i>

1159
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:07,223
<i>My sister finally decided
to break up with Derek...</i>

1160
01:22:07,224 --> 01:22:09,543
<i>...and go stag with her
girlfriends instead.</i>

1161
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:14,215
<i>And then there was Sam.</i>

1162
01:22:14,422 --> 01:22:16,615
<i>I've looked at her
pictures since that night.</i>

1163
01:22:17,749 --> 01:22:20,374
<i>I like to see how happy
she was before she knew.</i>

1164
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:24,502
<i>They were in a hotel suite after prom
when the truth came out...</i>

1165
01:22:25,248 --> 01:22:28,728
<i>Basically, Craig has been
cheating on Sam the whole time.</i>

1166
01:22:28,947 --> 01:22:33,385
<i>When I heard that, I kept thinking
about the happy girl in these pictures.</i>

1167
01:22:33,755 --> 01:22:37,548
<i>Because she doesn't
have 1,095 days to go.</i>

1168
01:22:37,979 --> 01:22:38,989
<i>She made it.</i>

1169
01:22:39,428 --> 01:22:40,800
<i>This is her time.</i>

1170
01:22:41,939 --> 01:22:44,477
<i>And no one should be
able to take that away.</i>

1171
01:22:47,378 --> 01:22:49,214
<i>- Congratulations.
- Oh, Charlie! Charlie's here!</i>

1172
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:50,442
<i>Guys, group photo!</i>

1173
01:22:50,477 --> 01:22:51,786
<i>We should all take a group photo.</i>

1174
01:22:51,821 --> 01:22:53,910
<i>Oh, get against the railing
and try to look suave!</i>

1175
01:22:54,045 --> 01:22:56,549
<i>Yeah, this is the one.
That's gonna be a great angle.</i>

1176
01:23:04,735 --> 01:23:06,155
<i>At her going away party...</i>

1177
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:09,635
<i>...I wanted her to know about that night
we went through the tunnel.</i>

1178
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:13,797
<i>And how for the first time,
I felt like I belonged somewhere.</i>

1179
01:23:15,804 --> 01:23:17,774
<i>And tomorrow, she's leaving.</i>

1180
01:23:18,705 --> 01:23:20,668
<i>So, I wanted to give her a part of me.</i>

1181
01:23:23,341 --> 01:23:25,388
<i>Are these all your books, Charlie?</i>

1182
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:38,448
<i>- Thanks for staying up with me.
- Sure.</i>

1183
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:44,077
<i>My brother said Penn State has this
restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner.</i>

1184
01:23:44,778 --> 01:23:47,150
<i>You have to get a grilled
stickie on your first night.</i>

1185
01:23:47,185 --> 01:23:48,935
<i>It's a tradition.</i>

1186
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:52,112
<i>- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah.</i>

1187
01:23:55,295 --> 01:23:57,926
<i>Pretty soon, you'll have a whole
new group of friends, you know.</i>

1188
01:23:59,572 --> 01:24:01,425
<i>You won't even think
about this place anymore.</i>

1189
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:05,333
<i>Yes, I will.</i>

1190
01:24:19,365 --> 01:24:20,756
<i>I had lunch with Craig today.</i>

1191
01:24:22,743 --> 01:24:23,586
<i>Yeah?</i>

1192
01:24:24,023 --> 01:24:25,499
<i>He said he was sorry and that...</i>

1193
01:24:25,713 --> 01:24:27,348
<i>...I was right to break up with him.</i>

1194
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:34,418
<i>I'm driving away,
and I'm just feeling so small.</i>

1195
01:24:34,799 --> 01:24:39,236
<i>Just asking myself
why do I and everyone I love...</i>

1196
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:43,559
<i>...pick people who
treat us like we're nothing?</i>

1197
01:24:48,793 --> 01:24:51,083
<i>We accept the love we think we deserve.</i>

1198
01:24:57,988 --> 01:25:00,502
<i>Then, why didn't you ever ask me out?</i>

1199
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:08,345
<i>I, uh...</i>

1200
01:25:09,517 --> 01:25:11,230
<i>I just didn't think that you wanted that.</i>

1201
01:25:12,168 --> 01:25:13,483
<i>Well, what did you want?</i>

1202
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,825
<i>I just want you to be happy.</i>

1203
01:25:18,789 --> 01:25:20,362
<i>Don't you get it, Charlie?</i>

1204
01:25:21,697 --> 01:25:23,392
<i>I can't feel that.</i>

1205
01:25:24,457 --> 01:25:26,377
<i>It's really sweet and everything, but...</i>

1206
01:25:27,410 --> 01:25:30,527
<i>...you can't just sit there and
put everybody's lives ahead of yours...</i>

1207
01:25:30,562 --> 01:25:32,051
<i>...and think that counts as love.</i>

1208
01:25:32,413 --> 01:25:34,671
<i>I don't wanna be somebody's crush.</i>

1209
01:25:36,143 --> 01:25:38,609
<i>I want people to like the real me.</i>

1210
01:25:42,391 --> 01:25:44,135
<i>I know who you are, Sam.</i>

1211
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:51,906
<i>I know I'm quiet...</i>

1212
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:55,773
<i>...and I know I should speak more...</i>

1213
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,387
<i>...but if you knew the things that...</i>

1214
01:25:58,388 --> 01:26:01,394
<i>...that were in my head
most of the time, you'd know...</i>

1215
01:26:01,665 --> 01:26:03,266
<i>...what it really meant.</i>

1216
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:07,245
<i>How much we are alike.</i>

1217
01:26:08,647 --> 01:26:10,743
<i>And how we've been
through the same things.</i>

1218
01:26:12,330 --> 01:26:13,983
<i>And you're not small.</i>

1219
01:26:14,871 --> 01:26:15,966
<i>You're beautiful.</i>

1220
01:26:42,737 --> 01:26:45,274
<i>- What's wrong, Charlie?
- Oh, nothing.</i>

1221
01:27:12,245 --> 01:27:13,709
<i>Promise you're gonna call.</i>

1222
01:27:14,251 --> 01:27:16,153
<i>You know I'm gonna call you all the time.</i>

1223
01:27:16,188 --> 01:27:18,442
<i>- We'll all see each other in New York.
- All the time.</i>

1224
01:27:21,405 --> 01:27:22,735
<i>Come on, Sam.</i>

1225
01:28:05,093 --> 01:28:06,476
<i>What's wrong, Charlie?</i>

1226
01:28:10,037 --> 01:28:12,739
<i>- Put your seat belt on.
- We'll meet you there.</i>

1227
01:28:36,598 --> 01:28:37,988
<i>Don't wake your sister.</i>

1228
01:28:50,914 --> 01:28:53,165
<i>It'll be our little secret, okay?</i>

1229
01:28:55,249 --> 01:28:57,575
<i>Look, Charlie.
She's fast asleep.</i>

1230
01:29:00,628 --> 01:29:02,364
<i>Don't wake your sister.</i>

1231
01:29:08,615 --> 01:29:11,489
<i>My fault.
My fault.</i>

1232
01:29:12,088 --> 01:29:14,756
<i>My fault.
It was all my fault.</i>

1233
01:29:15,814 --> 01:29:17,266
<i>It'll be our little secret, okay?</i>

1234
01:29:17,301 --> 01:29:18,719
<i>Stop it.</i>

1235
01:29:20,198 --> 01:29:21,205
<i>Stop.</i>

1236
01:29:25,264 --> 01:29:26,725
<i>Stop crying.</i>

1237
01:29:27,422 --> 01:29:29,055
<i>Stop crying.</i>

1238
01:29:36,273 --> 01:29:37,859
<i>It'll be our little secret.</i>

1239
01:29:44,447 --> 01:29:46,343
<i>Candace, your brother's on the phone.</i>

1240
01:29:49,171 --> 01:29:50,044
<i>Hello.</i>

1241
01:29:50,487 --> 01:29:52,533
<i>- Hey, Candace.
- Charlie?</i>

1242
01:29:52,568 --> 01:29:54,499
<i>Sam and Patrick left, and...</i>

1243
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,496
<i>...I just can't stop
thinking about something.</i>

1244
01:29:57,531 --> 01:29:58,845
<i>What?</i>

1245
01:29:58,880 --> 01:29:59,958
<i>Candace...</i>

1246
01:30:00,999 --> 01:30:03,069
<i>...I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I?</i>

1247
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:07,456
<i>She died getting my birthday present,
so I guess I killed her, right?</i>

1248
01:30:08,645 --> 01:30:10,848
<i>I've tried to stop
thinking that, but I can't.</i>

1249
01:30:10,883 --> 01:30:12,039
<i>She keeps driving away...</i>

1250
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:14,369
<i>- ...and dying over and over.
- Call the police and send them to my house.</i>

1251
01:30:14,404 --> 01:30:17,740
<i>- And I can't stop her. I'm crazy again.
- No, Charlie, listen to me.</i>

1252
01:30:17,775 --> 01:30:19,637
<i>Mom and dad are going to be
home with Chris any second.</i>

1253
01:30:19,672 --> 01:30:24,559
<i>I was just thinking...
what if I wanted her to die, Candace?</i>

1254
01:30:24,594 --> 01:30:28,276
<i>What? Charlie? Charlie!</i>

1255
01:31:03,252 --> 01:31:04,444
<i>Charlie?</i>

1256
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:06,982
<i>I'm Dr. Burton.</i>

1257
01:31:11,912 --> 01:31:13,244
<i>Where am I?</i>

1258
01:31:13,475 --> 01:31:15,077
<i>Mayview hospital.</i>

1259
01:31:19,253 --> 01:31:22,461
<i>You have to let me go.
My dad can't afford it.</i>

1260
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:24,977
<i>- Don't worry about that.
- No.</i>

1261
01:31:26,395 --> 01:31:28,393
<i>I saw them when I was little.</i>

1262
01:31:28,394 --> 01:31:30,980
<i>And I don't want to be a Mayview kid.</i>

1263
01:31:30,981 --> 01:31:33,076
<i>Just tell me how to stop it.</i>

1264
01:31:33,557 --> 01:31:34,849
<i>Stop what?</i>

1265
01:31:36,221 --> 01:31:37,774
<i>Seeing it.</i>

1266
01:31:40,128 --> 01:31:43,468
<i>All their lives. All the time.</i>

1267
01:31:43,503 --> 01:31:46,808
<i>Just... how do you stop seeing it?</i>

1268
01:31:46,843 --> 01:31:48,552
<i>Seeing what, Charlie?</i>

1269
01:31:49,183 --> 01:31:54,241
<i>There is so much pain.</i>

1270
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:58,598
<i>And I don't know
how to not notice it.</i>

1271
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,201
<i>What's hurting you?</i>

1272
01:32:01,236 --> 01:32:04,989
<i>No! Not me.
It's them. It's everyone.</i>

1273
01:32:05,537 --> 01:32:07,152
<i>It never stops.</i>

1274
01:32:08,612 --> 01:32:10,157
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1275
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:17,830
<i>What about your Aunt Helen?</i>

1276
01:32:22,888 --> 01:32:24,200
<i>What about her?</i>

1277
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,454
<i>You see her?</i>

1278
01:32:29,892 --> 01:32:30,988
<i>Yes.</i>

1279
01:32:32,073 --> 01:32:33,977
<i>She had a terrible life.</i>

1280
01:32:36,961 --> 01:32:38,395
<i>But... I mean, what am I...</i>

1281
01:32:38,396 --> 01:32:40,616
<i>You said some things
about her in your sleep.</i>

1282
01:32:41,063 --> 01:32:42,711
<i>I... I don't care.</i>

1283
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,964
<i>If you want to get better...</i>

1284
01:32:46,116 --> 01:32:47,598
<i>...you have to.</i>

1285
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,441
<i>She...</i>

1286
01:32:57,341 --> 01:32:58,697
<i>She was insane.</i>

1287
01:33:02,513 --> 01:33:03,555
<i>She...</i>

1288
01:33:05,257 --> 01:33:09,144
<i>Charlie, are you gonna
let me help you here?</i>

1289
01:33:12,043 --> 01:33:13,120
<i>Okay.</i>

1290
01:33:14,613 --> 01:33:17,417
<i>Do you remember anything
before you blacked out?</i>

1291
01:33:20,365 --> 01:33:22,875
<i>I remember leaving Sam's house...</i>

1292
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:26,249
<i>...and walking home and...</i>

1293
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:30,428
<i>I was in the hospital for awhile.</i>

1294
01:33:32,236 --> 01:33:34,616
<i>I won't go into detail about all of it.</i>

1295
01:33:35,670 --> 01:33:38,652
<i>But I will say there were
some very bad days.</i>

1296
01:33:39,794 --> 01:33:42,695
<i>And some unexpected beautiful days.</i>

1297
01:33:45,764 --> 01:33:47,634
<i>The worst day was the time...</i>

1298
01:33:47,635 --> 01:33:51,567
<i>...my doctor told my mom and
dad what Aunt Helen did to me.</i>

1299
01:33:57,924 --> 01:33:59,400
<i>Honey?</i>

1300
01:34:01,821 --> 01:34:03,414
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1301
01:34:17,908 --> 01:34:20,345
<i>The best days were those
when I could have visitors.</i>

1302
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:23,390
<i>My brother and sister
always came for those...</i>

1303
01:34:23,391 --> 01:34:25,769
<i>...until Chris had to
go to training camp.</i>

1304
01:34:26,409 --> 01:34:28,415
<i>He's going to be first string this year.</i>

1305
01:34:30,963 --> 01:34:34,371
<i>And my sister told me
she met a nice guy at her summer job.</i>

1306
01:34:39,089 --> 01:34:40,194
<i>There he is.</i>

1307
01:34:41,752 --> 01:34:46,219
<i>So, I'll see you Thursday at 6, right?</i>

1308
01:34:46,949 --> 01:34:49,989
<i>My doctor said we can't
choose where we can come from...</i>

1309
01:34:50,024 --> 01:34:52,433
<i>...but we can choose
where we go from there.</i>

1310
01:34:53,999 --> 01:34:55,496
<i>I know it's not all the answers...</i>

1311
01:34:55,497 --> 01:34:58,804
<i>...but it was enough to start
putting these pieces together.</i>

1312
01:35:00,378 --> 01:35:02,509
<i>God bless food
we are about to receive.</i>

1313
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:05,489
<i>We thank You for this bounty in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i>

1314
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:07,558
<i>- Amen.
- Amen.</i>

1315
01:35:16,432 --> 01:35:19,087
<i>So, how do you think the Penguins
are gonna do this year, dad?</i>

1316
01:35:21,303 --> 01:35:22,717
<i>God damn Penguins.</i>

1317
01:35:22,889 --> 01:35:25,215
<i>I think they're allergic
to God damn defense.</i>

1318
01:35:28,942 --> 01:35:31,597
<i>What do the players call a puck again?</i>

1319
01:35:31,787 --> 01:35:33,138
<i>A biscuit.</i>

1320
01:35:33,139 --> 01:35:35,387
<i>Are you sure it's not
a "God damn biscuit?"</i>

1321
01:35:35,388 --> 01:35:37,049
<i>You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.</i>

1322
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:39,796
<i>Honey, I think we're gonna have
to do a little shopping for you...</i>

1323
01:35:39,797 --> 01:35:40,984
<i>...before you take off, huh?</i>

1324
01:35:41,229 --> 01:35:42,782
<i>I need some books...</i>

1325
01:35:50,431 --> 01:35:52,187
<i>Can Charlie come out and play?</i>

1326
01:35:58,112 --> 01:36:00,413
<i>That first night, we had grilled stickies.</i>

1327
01:36:00,448 --> 01:36:01,793
<i>It was so good.</i>

1328
01:36:01,828 --> 01:36:03,880
<i>You have to visit in the Fall.
We'll have some. Okay?</i>

1329
01:36:03,915 --> 01:36:04,863
<i>Definitely.</i>

1330
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:09,374
<i>Oh, sorry. Charlie has
a breakdown scheduled for October.</i>

1331
01:36:10,599 --> 01:36:12,683
<i>Well, can I tell you something?</i>

1332
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:14,835
<i>I've been away for two months.</i>

1333
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:18,591
<i>It's another world.
And it gets better.</i>

1334
01:36:19,385 --> 01:36:22,476
<i>And my roommate Katie
has the best taste in music.</i>

1335
01:36:28,997 --> 01:36:30,765
<i>I found the tunnel song.</i>

1336
01:36:33,809 --> 01:36:35,041
<i>Let's drive.</i>

1337
01:36:39,581 --> 01:36:42,341
<i>I don't know if I will have the
time to write any more letters...</i>

1338
01:36:42,376 --> 01:36:45,258
<i>...because I might be too
busy trying to participate.</i>

1339
01:36:48,727 --> 01:36:51,431
<i>So, if this does end up
being the last letter...</i>

1340
01:36:51,466 --> 01:36:55,393
<i>...I just want you to know that I was in a
bad place before I started high school.</i>

1341
01:36:55,428 --> 01:36:57,154
<i>And you helped me.</i>

1342
01:36:58,169 --> 01:37:00,433
<i>Even if you didn't know
what I was talking about.</i>

1343
01:37:00,468 --> 01:37:02,359
<i>Or know someone who's gone through it.</i>

1344
01:37:02,737 --> 01:37:04,720
<i>It made me not feel alone.</i>

1345
01:37:07,409 --> 01:37:11,062
<i>Because I know there are people who
say all of these things don't happen.</i>

1346
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:16,714
<i>And there are people who forget what
it's like to be 16 when they turn 17.</i>

1347
01:37:17,409 --> 01:37:19,913
<i>I know these will all
be stories someday.</i>

1348
01:37:19,914 --> 01:37:22,688
<i>And our pictures will
become old photographs.</i>

1349
01:37:23,167 --> 01:37:25,990
<i>And we'll all become
somebody's mom or dad.</i>

1350
01:37:27,261 --> 01:37:30,972
<i>But right now,
these moments are not stories.</i>

1351
01:37:31,356 --> 01:37:34,935
<i>This is happening.
I am here.</i>

1352
01:37:35,303 --> 01:37:36,607
<i>And I am looking at her.</i>

1353
01:37:37,673 --> 01:37:39,529
<i>And she is so beautiful.</i>

1354
01:37:49,849 --> 01:37:50,993
<i>I can see it.</i>

1355
01:37:52,051 --> 01:37:55,830
<i>This one moment when you
know you're not a sad story.</i>

1356
01:37:56,175 --> 01:37:58,030
<i>You are alive.</i>

1357
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:01,713
<i>And you stand up and see
the lights on buildings...</i>

1358
01:38:01,714 --> 01:38:03,790
<i>...and everything that makes you wonder.</i>

1359
01:38:04,909 --> 01:38:07,259
<i>And you are listening to
that song on that drive...</i>

1360
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:10,641
<i>...with the people
you love most in this world.</i>

1361
01:38:13,157 --> 01:38:15,587
<i>And in this moment, I swear...</i>

1362
01:38:17,719 --> 01:38:19,695
<i>...we are infinite.</i>
