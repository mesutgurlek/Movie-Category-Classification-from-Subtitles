1
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:06,198
(thunder rolls)

2
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:40,529
(retching)

3
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:46,591
(toilet flushing)

4
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,059
(water running)

5
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:21,094
(engine starts)

6
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:41,027
Woman: Evening, handsome.

7
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,264
Man: Hi, Lucille.
How you've been?

8
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,232
Lucille: Okay.

9
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,959
- Waitress: Evening, Hank.
- Hey, Betty, how's your mama now?

10
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,522
She's good.

11
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,891
Lucille: Here you go.

12
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,657
So...

13
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,597
How you been?

14
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:16,360
- Pretty good, and you?
- Pretty good.

15
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,724
How's Sonny?

16
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,557
He's all right, I guess.

17
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:30,497
(humming)

18
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,123
(knock on door)

19
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,326
Vera, how are you doing?

20
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,230
- I'm good, how are you?
- I'm good.

21
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,288
Here.

22
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,190
It's all right.

23
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:47,162
- You want a drink?
- Oh yeah, thanks hon.

24
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:48,858
Sonny: Wild Turkey.

25
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:00,662
Vera: I'm sore,
so go easy, darling.

26
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:01,960
Yes ma'am.

27
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,656
(panting)

28
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,697
- Thanks, Vera.
- You're welcome.

29
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:47,027
Yeah.

30
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:09,395
What's the matter, hon?
You look so sad.

31
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,265
Sonny: I'm fine.

32
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:13,822
Hey?

33
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,822
You wanna get something to eat?

34
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,497
- Talk?
- Take care, Sonny.

35
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,727
(folk music playing)

36
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,560
Morning, Pop.

37
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,395
This shit's cold.
I'm gonna get some more.

38
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:41,698
Pop: What the hell are
those niggers doing out there?

39
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,564
I said something to you.
Did you hear me?

40
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:50,422
Yeah.

41
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,659
Damn porch monkeys.
Be moving in here soon.

42
00:08:56,167 --> 00:09:00,429
Sitting next to me...
watching my TV.

43
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,163
There was a time
when they knew their place.

44
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,428
Wasn't none of this
mixing going on.

45
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,265
Your mother,
she hated them niggers, too.

46
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:33,991
Tell them to get
the hell off my property.

47
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,292
- You put that thing down.
- Boy: We came by to see Sonny.

48
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:40,299
I don't give a damn
who you come by to see.

49
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:42,060
Get them out of here
right now.

50
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,621
Hank: They're your buddies.
Tell them to get out of here.

51
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,065
What are you standing there for?

52
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,662
You watch your ass, all right?

53
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,123
(TV playing)

54
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,722
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah.

55
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,330
- Hank: Be careful walking around.
- Yeah, yeah.

56
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,825
(TV playing)

57
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,527
Man:
You see these two boys here?

58
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:46,523
They're my sons.

59
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:49,427
They were on my property.

60
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,932
No need to be scared of no little boys.
They ain't come to hurt you.

61
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,091
No need to be letting off no shotgun
to tell them to leave, either.

62
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,231
You understand?

63
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,329
Then keep 'em off my property.

64
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:06,195
They're friends to your son, okay?
He invited them here.

65
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:08,358
They ain't trespassing,
they ain't hurting nobody.

66
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:13,661
Man: Next time you wanna play cowboy,
I'm over here all the time.

67
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,792
Well, you keep them
off my property.

68
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:19,264
- I think you heard me, sir.
- I think you heard me too.

69
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:20,425
All right?

70
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:23,298
Come on boys, let's go.

71
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,632
Aw, shit!

72
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,360
- You're all right, Dappa.
- Yeah, I'm all right.

73
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,490
- You're sure?
- Yeah. It was loose.

74
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:51,589
Yeah.

75
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:56,464
Did you see what you did, Sonny?

76
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,897
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It was my mistake.

77
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:01,865
- Yeah, it was.
- It won't happen next time.

78
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:04,930
Let's just keep going
till we get it right.

79
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,057
(laughter)

80
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,564
That's none of your business.

81
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:18,531
- (more laughter)
- Woman: Woo!

82
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:21,565
I'm surprised you're
talking like that to me.

83
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:24,895
- You being a woman, you know?
- I'm a liberated woman.

84
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:26,160
Better watch out,
Georgia Ann,

85
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,392
Tommy's gonna sue you
for sexual harassment.

86
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:29,625
Georgia Ann:
Oh, that's okay.

87
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:35,956
Booter, how you doing?

88
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,031
Just give me the $2.50, Sonny.

89
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,327
I got it, Booter.

90
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,754
- You keep the rest of it.
- Thanks, Mr. Grotowski.

91
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,831
Hank: Just like I said,
no more mistakes, all right?

92
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,696
I wanna make damn sure nobody
makes any mistakes, especially you.

93
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:03,926
So when it gets time for us to do it...

94
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,166
you can't mess up.

95
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,127
That goes for me too,
and the rest of them.

96
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:18,327
You ain't no different then us,
you can't screw it up.

97
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,326
- (Dappa mumbles)
- Yeah.

98
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:24,763
- That's Hank's boy.
- Georgia Ann: It's in the genes.

99
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,094
Yeah, but he's a boy.

100
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,826
- Yes, he is.
- He will be a man tomorrow.

101
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,060
Man: In England, they give
the guy a party the night before.

102
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,456
They call it the Monster's Ball.

103
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:44,128
They don't want no lawyer, no preacher,
or anything like that around...

104
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,995
So, it's just you and me.

105
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:52,964
We can't think about what he did
or anything else about him.

106
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,999
It's a job.
We have to do our job right.

107
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:44,762
- (buzz)
- (gate opens)

108
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,089
Man: I've been drawing a lot.
What about you?

109
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,962
Boy: Yeah.

110
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:01,958
Look here,
we ain't got a lot of time.

111
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:05,031
I'm going to give you
all my drawings...

112
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:08,559
all my clothes.

113
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:09,997
When you get older,

114
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:13,790
they may fit you and you may
want to wear them.

115
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,164
I'm not gonna
see you again after this?

116
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,892
No.

117
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,330
Why?

118
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,493
- 'Cause I'm a bad man.
- Who says?

119
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,226
I do.

120
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,557
But I want you to know something.

121
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,065
What?

122
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:36,796
You ain't me.

123
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:40,628
- Yes I am.
- No, you're not.

124
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,224
You're everything
that's good about me.

125
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:49,198
You're the best of what I am,
that's what you are.

126
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:52,858
This man you see sitting
here today, you ain't.

127
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,856
Hey, baby.
You look nice, today.

128
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:03,865
You always look nice.

129
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:09,524
Tyrell, did you tell your daddy
what you won at school?

130
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,031
Oh yeah, right.

131
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,759
My drawing's getting used
for the school magazine cover.

132
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,799
- You know what I did?
- What did you do?

133
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:20,889
Go on, just tell him.
Don't be playing no guessing games.

134
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:22,432
Tyrell:
I made a picture of you...

135
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:24,431
sitting alone...

136
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:26,226
in jail.

137
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,929
The theme was solitude.

138
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:37,626
Way to go, Ty. Way to go.
Put it there, boy.

139
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,760
Not too bad.

140
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:52,255
What's going on with the car?

141
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,930
It's leaking radiator fluid.

142
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,126
Take it in right away.
Have them check the hoses.

143
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,825
The car get too hot,
you're gonna be in trouble.

144
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,993
The house?

145
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,099
I'm losing it.

146
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,065
I can't afford to make
the payments no more.

147
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,498
Not no more.

148
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,898
Man: I'm sorry, baby.

149
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:34,025
Ty, let me and your mama
talk for a second.

150
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,156
Okay.

151
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:44,922
Man: Come on, now.

152
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,829
Only reason I'm here,
so you can say goodbye to your son.

153
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:53,591
Okay.

154
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:57,530
I been coming here
for damn near 11 years, Lawrence.

155
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,263
And I'm tired.

156
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,322
I'm tired of coming here.

157
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:07,696
- Officer #1: Time.
- So soon?

158
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,223
I got to get going, baby.

159
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:31,456
Time for me to go, Ty.

160
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:34,931
I'm gonna call you.
You wait by the phone, okay?

161
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,989
Come on now.
You got to let go.

162
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:40,657
Woman:
Come on, Tyrell.

163
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:48,893
For every time
I hurt you, I'm sorry.

164
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:50,024
Officer #1: Come on.

165
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,631
Officer #2: Ma'am, let's go.

166
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,097
Let's go.

167
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,929
Officer #2: Ma'am, let's go.

168
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,090
- (door closes)
- I know my way out of here.

169
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,291
Come on.

170
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:19,562
Hank: He don't have
any outstanding appeal, so...

171
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:22,098
looks like we're definitely
gonna do it tonight.

172
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,063
Everybody okay?

173
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:27,598
- You all right, Georgia Ann?
- I'm okay.

174
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:31,828
Hank:
Dappa, is that hood ready?

175
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,092
Yeah, it's fixed
and ready to go.

176
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,223
All right.

177
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:38,658
Anybody got anything to say?

178
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:39,756
Hank: Tommy?

179
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,890
Tommy: He likes to draw.
It calms him down.

180
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,330
Draw?

181
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:46,922
- Yeah.
- Okay.

182
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:50,659
Phil, will you make sure he's got
whatever it is he needs to draw with?

183
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:51,255
Yes, sir.

184
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,592
Hank: Tommy, why don't you
lead us in prayer?

185
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,654
Okay.

186
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,894

187
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,094
I'm here for your stuff, man.

188
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,996
Tommy: ...that the Lord
save us his anointing.

189
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:18,931
Ye will hear Him
in His holy Heaven,

190
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:21,261
and the saving strength
of His right hand.

191
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:27,090
Be careful with this.

192
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,894
Don't worry about it, man.

193
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:31,933
- Close 1 3!
- (buzz)

194
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,632
Worry's all I've got.

...some in chariots,
some in horses.

196
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:41,391
but we remember
the name of the Lord, our God.

197
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:47,358
They're brought down and fallen,
but we are risen and stand upright.

198
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:50,797
Save us, Lord. Let the King
hear us when we call Him.

TV host:
Sky surfing is when you skydive,

200
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:56,888
with a board attached to your feet,
and try to do different maneuvers.

201
00:20:56,966 --> 00:21:00,989
A camera flyer flies
with a camera on top of a helmet,

202
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:02,225
filming the sky surfer...

203
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:05,561
and flies with the sky surfer
for capturing the moves.

204
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:08,030
My camera flyer is my husband,
Craig O'Brien.

205
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,766
Sonny: I'm gonna put
these on nice and loose.

206
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:17,857
Everything's gonna
be okay, right?

207
00:21:17,932 --> 00:21:19,296
Yes, sir.

208
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:27,592
What about my last phone call?

209
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,029
Warden says it's a bad idea.

210
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:34,726
Turn around.

211
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,724
Maybe you could call my son
and tell him that I tried.

212
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:45,797
I don't think so.

213
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:47,989
Sonny: Okay.

214
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:53,792

is usually around 60 seconds,

216
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:12,630
and the normal altitude
we jump from is 1 2,500 feet.

217
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,092

TV ad: Starting to feel a little
cramped by your present surroundings?

220
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:36,926
Maybe it's time
to expand your horizons.

221
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:39,261
Maybe it's time
to think about ReMax.

222
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,629
ReMax Associates
lead the real estate industry--

223
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,359
I'm going to be right back.
Stay right there.

a new home that meets all your needs,

to someone who will find it
absolutely perfect.

If you're looking for results,
look for ReMax.

228
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:58,097
Nobody sells more real estate.

Where's my paper and pencil?

It's my right to have
my paper and pencil.

233
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:28,689
Hank: I know.

234
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:30,890
Your paper and pencil's
on the way.

235
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:33,228
I promise you it is.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

240
00:25:21,232 --> 00:25:23,425
Here you go, Lawrence.

241
00:25:27,132 --> 00:25:28,893
Is that done?

242
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,824

243
00:25:36,499 --> 00:25:39,158
Wow.
That's nice.

It's real nice.

I don't look
this good in person.

Sonny.

250
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:06,896
- Just breathe.

251
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,259
Sonny, sit down.

252
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:16,026
I said, sit down.
Sit down.

253
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:27,794
Come on, Lawrence.
Come on, buddy.

254

Let's go.
It's all right.

255

Just let go.

Let go. Come on.

00:26:35,832 --> 00:26:37,355
Come on.

Lawrence:
I've always believed

260
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:55,988
that a portrait
captures a person...

261
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:59,157
far better
than a photograph.

262
00:27:03,865 --> 00:27:08,491
It truly takes a human being
to really see a human being.

263
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:27,925
Wait a minute.

264
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:29,692
Come here.

265
00:27:40,966 --> 00:27:43,932
What the hell is this,
Tyrell?

266
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:46,624
What did I tell you
about eating this shit?

267
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,688
Didn't I tell you
don't be eating that shit?

268
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:51,560
Look at this.
Look all this fat!

269
00:27:51,632 --> 00:27:54,757
This fat ass!
Look all this nasty fat!

Where they at?!

271

Look at all this candy!

272
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:02,490
You ain't eating all this candy!
You crazy?!

273
00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:04,827
Look at this room!
It's a mess!

274
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:09,264
Why is it a mess?
'Cause a fat piggy lives in this room!

275
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,424
Get your ass
on this scale!

276
00:28:11,498 --> 00:28:14,623
Get on the scale!
What does it say?

You ain't lost
no weight!

(Tyrell cries)

280
00:28:30,465 --> 00:28:32,329
Come on.

281
00:28:33,632 --> 00:28:35,394
Come on.

282
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,522
Let's go wait

It is ordered and adjudged

as provided by statute,

287
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:17,693
shall be executed
at this time.

00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:38,631
Lawrence Musgrove,

289
00:31:38,699 --> 00:31:41,460
do you have anything
you'd like to say?

290
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:52,531
Push the button.

291

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,697
Hank: Hey.
Do you know what you did?

293
00:33:09,765 --> 00:33:11,492
Do you know what you did?

294
00:33:11,565 --> 00:33:13,463
Are you listening to me?

295
00:33:13,532 --> 00:33:15,430
Do you know
what you did?!

296
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:17,158
Do you know
what you did?!

297
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:20,686
You fucked him up!
You fucked up that man's last walk!

298
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,788
How would you like it
if somebody fucked up your last walk?!

299
00:33:23,865 --> 00:33:26,353
You're like a woman,
like your fucking mother!

300
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,996
You shouldn't have done that,
you son of a bitch!

301
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:33,657
Get up,
you fucking pussy!

302
00:33:33,732 --> 00:33:36,096
You are a piece
of fucking shit!

303
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:38,064
Do you understand me?!

304
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:44,154
- Easy, easy!
- Get your fucking hands off me,

305
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,789
- you fucking nigger!
- Hank! Hank!

306
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:51,888
- This ain't you!
- This is me, Phil! This is me!

307
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:54,329
And I'm the man
who could have your job!

308
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:58,194
Don't let me catch you touching
anybody that outranks you again!

309
00:33:58,265 --> 00:34:01,129
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir!

310
00:34:01,198 --> 00:34:02,926
"Yes, sir"?

311
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,022
- I don't want to hear you.
- I just keep the peace.

312
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:06,894
You piece of shit!

313
00:34:11,665 --> 00:34:14,222
You got-- bleeding.

314
00:34:15,298 --> 00:34:16,924
Sonny.

315
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,688
Get up!
Get out of my goddamn house!

316
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:53,861
You get out!
Come on!

317
00:34:57,231 --> 00:34:59,493
You lousy piece of shit!

318
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:02,656
Get up!

319
00:35:02,732 --> 00:35:06,858
What are you
gonna do, huh?

320
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:09,363
What are you gonna do?!

321
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:16,763
See? How do you like
that, huh?

322
00:35:16,832 --> 00:35:19,127
Are you a tough guy now?
Are you tough?

323
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,695
Say something.

324
00:35:27,765 --> 00:35:29,958
Say something!

325
00:35:44,198 --> 00:35:46,130
Get up.

326
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:57,497
You hate me.

327
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,427
Answer me.

328
00:36:12,632 --> 00:36:15,063
Sonny:
You hate me, don't you?

329
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,461
Yeah, I hate you.

330
00:36:20,598 --> 00:36:22,461
I always did.

331
00:36:23,966 --> 00:36:26,591
Well,
I always loved you.

332
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:38,359
Hand me the scissors.

333
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:12,961
Hold on a minute.

334
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:17,157
- Where are you going?
- I want to put these up.

335
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:50,627
- How much?
- That'll be $2.85.

336
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:12,591
Billy, I'm moving
as fast as I can.

337
00:39:12,665 --> 00:39:14,722
I'll put this dress on
and I'll be right there.

338
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:17,264
- You don't need to.
- Damn car still acting up.

339
00:39:17,332 --> 00:39:20,492
It's not just your car.
You've been late every day.

340
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:23,429
I've been trying.
I need this money.

341
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:25,157
- I'll lose my house.
- Look,

342
00:39:25,231 --> 00:39:28,322
go home, relax.
Take some time off.

343
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:29,954
You shouldn't be here
right now anyway.

344
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:33,122
That's why you should have
given me the week off.

345
00:39:33,198 --> 00:39:36,562
- With some pay.
- We already got a new girl.

346
00:39:58,265 --> 00:39:59,855
Hank?

347
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,459
- Let's get this over with quick.
- Is there a passage

348
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:07,623
- You'd like me to read?
- No.

349
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:11,324
All I want to hear is
that dirt hitting that box.

350
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:19,223
He was weak.

351
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:29,364
You can say something if you want,
once we've covered him up.

352
00:41:50,764 --> 00:41:52,526
- How are you doing?
- All right.

353
00:41:52,598 --> 00:41:56,121
- You want to see a menu?
- No, I know what I want.

354
00:41:58,031 --> 00:42:00,327
What you gonna have?

355
00:42:00,398 --> 00:42:02,626
A bowl of chocolate
ice cream...

356
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:05,397
and a cup of coffee.

357
00:42:06,664 --> 00:42:09,597
- Black, sugar, cream?
- No, black.

358
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:14,361
- That's it.
- Is that it?

359
00:42:21,565 --> 00:42:23,792
(dialing)

360
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:31,063
Hey, Vera, it's Hank.

361
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,858
Is it too late?

362
00:42:36,332 --> 00:42:40,094
Chocolate ice cream.
Here you go.

363
00:42:40,165 --> 00:42:43,961
I'll take a plastic spoon
for the ice cream.

364
00:42:45,131 --> 00:42:48,427
Oh, Goddamn!
Sorry about that.

365
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:50,589
- It's all right.
- Shit!

366
00:42:50,664 --> 00:42:52,789
I didn't mean to do that.
I'm sorry.

367
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:55,092
Bring me some napkins
or something.

368
00:42:55,165 --> 00:42:58,188
I'm sorry about that.
And you said a what--

369
00:42:58,265 --> 00:42:59,594
Plastic spoon.

370
00:43:02,764 --> 00:43:06,458
- Where's Lucille?
- I'm trying to fill in for her.

371
00:43:22,664 --> 00:43:25,426
- Hank: I'm ready to pay this.
- Yep.

372
00:43:34,664 --> 00:43:37,529
- (machine beeps)
- What's the deal here?

373
00:43:37,597 --> 00:43:41,189
I don't know.
I just overrang this thing.

374
00:43:43,898 --> 00:43:45,625
If you can't get it open,

375
00:43:45,698 --> 00:43:48,892
tell me how much it is,
and I'll pay you for it.

376
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:50,897
$3.92.

377
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:55,423
Here's $4.00.
Keep the change.

378
00:43:57,365 --> 00:43:59,490
Thanks.

379
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:03,156
Vera: Hey, cowboy, feel like
some late-night pussy?

380
00:44:03,231 --> 00:44:04,662
Hank: I guess so.

381
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:07,788
Haven't seen you
in a while.

382
00:44:07,864 --> 00:44:10,422
Yeah, well...

383
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:12,986
I ain't been
feeling too good.

384
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:17,031
Busy with this and that
and the other.

385
00:44:21,864 --> 00:44:23,727
- How have you been?
- All right.

386
00:44:23,798 --> 00:44:25,525
Good.

387
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:33,494
So how's Sonny?

388
00:44:41,965 --> 00:44:44,227
I can't do this tonight,
Vera.

389
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:48,253
- Are you sure, hon?
- No, not tonight.

390
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:52,661
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be. Some other time.

391
00:44:54,131 --> 00:44:55,461
All right.

392
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:01,661
You can keep that money.

393
00:45:01,731 --> 00:45:03,526
Vera:
I'm going to.

394
00:45:06,698 --> 00:45:08,164
Adios.

395
00:47:02,664 --> 00:47:05,824
- Man: Have a seat, Hank.
- Thank you, sir.

396
00:47:05,898 --> 00:47:08,728
I appreciate you seeing me.

397
00:47:08,798 --> 00:47:10,889
Man:
What brings you here?

398
00:47:10,965 --> 00:47:14,022
Sir, I'm resigning

399
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:18,121
and I wanted to come by
and tell you personally.

400
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:24,590
I appreciate that,
Hank.

401
00:47:28,131 --> 00:47:32,324
Why don't we wait a few weeks
before we submit the paperwork?

402
00:47:32,397 --> 00:47:34,795
That wouldn't do anybody
any good to wait on that.

403
00:47:34,864 --> 00:47:36,727
I've got
my mind made up.

404
00:47:38,497 --> 00:47:40,157
All right.

405
00:47:41,898 --> 00:47:44,023
We're gonna miss you.

406
00:47:50,131 --> 00:47:52,722
I brought
my badge in and...

407
00:47:55,431 --> 00:47:59,693
- Why don't you keep it?
- I ain't got no use for it.

408
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:29,028
Hank:
There you are, Pop.

409
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:37,626
We got each other...

410
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:39,891
son.

411
00:48:41,564 --> 00:48:44,291
- Remember that.
- Yes, sir.

412
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:55,687
I quit the team.

413
00:49:08,731 --> 00:49:11,197
That was a mistake.

414
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:20,858
I can't do it anymore.

415
00:49:23,364 --> 00:49:26,262
You're reminding me
of your mother.

416
00:49:30,331 --> 00:49:32,661
I guess that's bad,
right?

417
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:37,162
Your mother wasn't shit.

418
00:49:38,497 --> 00:49:41,020
That woman failed me.

419
00:49:45,497 --> 00:49:49,486
I got more pussy
after she killed herself...

420
00:49:50,731 --> 00:49:53,754
than I did when
she was living as my wife.

421
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,459
The point is...

422
00:50:02,531 --> 00:50:04,929
she quit on me.

423
00:50:06,065 --> 00:50:08,690
You're doing the same.

424
00:50:12,431 --> 00:50:14,659
Leticia:
Goddamnit!

425
00:50:16,331 --> 00:50:19,786
Let's go.
Hand me my purse.

426
00:50:19,864 --> 00:50:21,454
Come on. Get out!

427
00:50:21,531 --> 00:50:24,258
- Why, Mama, what's wrong?
- We've got to walk.

428
00:50:47,098 --> 00:50:48,996
(honking)

429
00:50:49,065 --> 00:50:51,428
Tyrell,
get off that street!

430
00:50:51,497 --> 00:50:54,089
You'll get yourself killed.

431
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:57,130
Don't do that!
Don't do that!

432
00:51:00,031 --> 00:51:03,463
Hank: This is jim-dandy.
This is just what I'm looking for.

433
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:06,964
Hank: At the same time,
it's the most expensive one.

434
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:10,326
But if you're willing
to talk price a little...

435
00:51:10,397 --> 00:51:12,556
Attendant:
We put quite a bit of work into it.

436
00:51:12,631 --> 00:51:14,529
We could talk about it.

437
00:51:14,597 --> 00:51:17,757
Hank: Let me think it over.
You have my number.

438
00:51:17,831 --> 00:51:19,990
- Attendant: All right.
- It was a pleasure.

439
00:51:20,065 --> 00:51:22,690
- Hank: Nice seeing you.
- Nice talking to you.

440
00:51:22,764 --> 00:51:24,559
See you.

441
00:51:36,097 --> 00:51:39,120
Come on, T.
Let's go.

442
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:43,487
That's what you think
your mama looks like?

443
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:45,291
Yeah, sort of.

444
00:51:45,364 --> 00:51:47,024
- See you in the morning?
- Yeah.

445
00:51:47,097 --> 00:51:48,427
- You too, young man.
- Bye.

446
00:51:48,497 --> 00:51:49,463
Bye-bye.

447
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:23,559
Come on, T.
Get up!

448
00:52:26,064 --> 00:52:28,758
Come on, T.
Get up!

449
00:52:28,831 --> 00:52:31,820
Leticia: Help me!

450
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:34,386
Help me! Wait!

451
00:52:34,464 --> 00:52:35,555
Wait!

452
00:52:38,097 --> 00:52:40,256
Come back here!

453
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:42,320
Help us!

454
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:47,258
Please, help us!

455
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,297
Help us!

456
00:52:59,698 --> 00:53:02,095
Come on, T.

457
00:53:02,164 --> 00:53:04,858
Come on, baby.
Wake up!

458
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,089
Wake up!

459
00:53:07,164 --> 00:53:10,062
- He was hit by a car!
- It's okay.

460
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,426
We need to get him
to the hospital.

461
00:53:12,497 --> 00:53:15,088
Right now! Right now!

462
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:50,830
We'll need a gurney out here.
There's a kid. I think it's bad.

463
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,921
Hank:
We'll need some help.

464
00:54:01,798 --> 00:54:04,787
Are you the boy's mother?
Please, follow me.

465
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:09,656
Is that your boy?

466
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,596
No.

467
00:54:12,664 --> 00:54:14,220
Guard:
What happened?

468
00:54:15,564 --> 00:54:17,291
I think
he got hit by a car.

469
00:54:17,364 --> 00:54:19,455
That was his mother.

470
00:54:19,531 --> 00:54:22,019
- She said he was hit by a car.
- Hit and run?

471
00:54:22,097 --> 00:54:24,723
I don't know.
I picked them up--

472
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:28,025
Guard: I need you to file a police
report if it was a hit and run.

473
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:31,825
Hank: Shit, I don't even know them.
I wouldn't know what to write.

474
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:35,022
Guard: Just stay, tell the police
what you did and saw.

475
00:54:35,097 --> 00:54:36,654
It'll be five minutes.

476
00:54:55,064 --> 00:54:56,462
Wait!

477
00:54:57,564 --> 00:55:01,690
Wait!
That's my baby!

478
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:09,161
Wait!
That's my baby!

479
00:55:11,664 --> 00:55:14,061
That's my baby!

480
00:55:15,564 --> 00:55:18,428
Hank: I know you're not
supposed to move people,

481
00:55:18,497 --> 00:55:21,793
but I didn't know
what else to do.

482
00:55:21,863 --> 00:55:23,988
The boy
was laying there...

483
00:55:24,064 --> 00:55:26,758
and the woman
was hysterical.

484
00:55:26,831 --> 00:55:29,921
I did the best I could do.
I just lugged him in the car

485
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:33,054
to come here as quick as I could.
That's what I did.

486
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,857
Detective:
You did a good job.

487
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,692
So you were
just passing by?

488
00:55:38,764 --> 00:55:41,821
Yeah, I don't know
the lady at all.

489
00:55:43,897 --> 00:55:46,420
Detective:
I'll give you my card.

490
00:55:46,497 --> 00:55:50,054
We'll do a follow-up
if we get anything.

491
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:53,119
We might call you as well,
if we need to.

492
00:55:53,197 --> 00:55:55,527
- That'd be all right?
- Whatever you need me to do.

493
00:55:55,597 --> 00:55:58,119
I got your number
right there.

494
00:56:01,364 --> 00:56:03,353
Is that it?
Can I go?

495
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,489
Yeah. Thanks.

496
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,522
Will that boy
make it all right?

497
00:56:14,597 --> 00:56:17,392
No, he died.

498
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:48,058
Mrs. Musgrove,
I'll give you my card

499
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,688
and you feel free
to call me anytime

500
00:56:50,763 --> 00:56:53,389
that you can remember
anything about this.

501
00:56:53,464 --> 00:56:55,487
I'm so sorry.

502
00:56:55,564 --> 00:56:57,723
Can I get something
to clean that off?

503
00:56:58,797 --> 00:57:00,786
That's mine.

504
00:57:08,531 --> 00:57:11,395
- Here's your purse.
- He's gone.

505
00:57:11,464 --> 00:57:13,623
- My baby.
- Yes, ma'am.

506
00:57:13,698 --> 00:57:16,528
He's gone. He's gone.

507
00:57:17,863 --> 00:57:19,693
(Leticia sobs)

508
00:57:22,097 --> 00:57:23,858
Will you
take her home?

509
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:28,158
I don't really know her.

510
00:57:30,064 --> 00:57:33,087
- I'll take her home.
- That's a good idea.

511
00:57:33,164 --> 00:57:34,425
Hank: Yeah,
I'll take her home.

512
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:45,386
Could you do me a favor
and throw that away for me?

513
00:57:45,464 --> 00:57:47,861
- Yes, sir.
- I'd appreciate that.

514
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:06,729
Hank:
Where do you live?

515
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:12,463
Ma'am, you'll have to tell me
where you live.

516
00:58:14,797 --> 00:58:16,922
Now, I'll go
in your purse.

517
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:19,156
I'm letting you know
I'm going in your purse

518
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,196
to find
an address on you.

519
00:58:59,997 --> 00:59:02,259
You should call
some of your kin people

520
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:04,126
or a friend or something.

521
00:59:12,464 --> 00:59:15,191
I'm going to have to go.

522
00:59:15,264 --> 00:59:17,025
You gonna be all right?

523
00:59:18,564 --> 00:59:22,587
They told me to call
the Coroner's Office in the morning.

524
00:59:24,197 --> 00:59:26,060
I'm sorry?

525
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:29,426
They told me to call
the Coroner's Office.

526
00:59:29,497 --> 00:59:32,327
They said
they gonna do an autopsy.

527
00:59:33,596 --> 00:59:36,892
I don't know why
they'll do an autopsy.

528
00:59:38,064 --> 00:59:40,189
He was hit by a car.

529
00:59:45,863 --> 00:59:48,761
I imagine that'll help them
find out who did it.

530
00:59:50,264 --> 00:59:52,786
You really believe
they'll do that?

531
00:59:53,863 --> 00:59:56,489
I believe
they'll try their best.

532
00:59:57,564 --> 01:00:00,223
He's a Black kid.

533
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:02,490
You think
they'll do that?

534
01:00:10,964 --> 01:00:14,294
Here's your bag.
I'll leave it on the floor.

535
01:00:21,264 --> 01:00:23,492
I'm real sorry.

536
01:01:11,663 --> 01:01:13,289
Mr. Grotowski?

537
01:01:13,364 --> 01:01:15,795
Just want to say
sorry about Sonny.

538
01:01:15,863 --> 01:01:20,125
- We liked him a lot.
- We feel bad, sir.

539
01:01:24,164 --> 01:01:26,527
Which one of you is Willie
and which's one's Harry?

540
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:28,960
He's Willie.

541
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:30,825
He's Darryl.

542
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,860
I'll see ya.
I appreciate that.

543
01:01:50,364 --> 01:01:54,194
I'm going over to the cafe.
Do you want a ride?

544
01:01:56,064 --> 01:01:58,461
You sure
you don't mind?

545
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:00,792
I'm going
that way anyway.

546
01:02:02,763 --> 01:02:05,423
(country music playing)

547
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,921
Is this music
all right with you?

548
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:22,319
- 'Cause I can change it.
- No, it's cool.

549
01:02:24,364 --> 01:02:26,829
You ain't got a car?

550
01:02:26,897 --> 01:02:29,159
It's broke.

551
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:31,321
I'm saving
to get me another one.

552
01:02:43,264 --> 01:02:46,457
Leticia:
$8.64. Thank you.

553
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:48,689
Hank: Thank you.

554
01:02:48,763 --> 01:02:51,286
You have
a good shift, okay?

555
01:02:51,364 --> 01:02:53,193
Leticia: Thanks.

556
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:58,396
- Leticia: Thank you.
- You're welcome.

557
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:31,525
Hey, Pop?

558
01:03:31,596 --> 01:03:34,790
- Look it here.
- What are those for?

559
01:03:34,863 --> 01:03:37,590
I bought a gas station.

560
01:03:38,964 --> 01:03:41,691
- That right?
- Mmm-hmm.

561
01:03:44,297 --> 01:03:46,286
It's all bought and paid for.

562
01:03:46,363 --> 01:03:48,125
- We own it.
- (Buck sneezes)

563
01:03:50,663 --> 01:03:54,255
Don't say ''we.''
You own it.

564
01:03:55,797 --> 01:03:57,660
I didn't buy it.

565
01:03:59,164 --> 01:04:04,460
- Yeah, well...
- I wouldn't have bought no gas station.

566
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:06,655
Is that right?

567
01:04:09,964 --> 01:04:12,794
I would have stuck
to what I knew best.

568
01:04:12,863 --> 01:04:16,852
- What's that?
- Corrections Officer.

569
01:04:18,363 --> 01:04:20,386
Right.

570
01:04:20,463 --> 01:04:22,861
Well, I ain't
a Corrections Officer no more.

571
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:25,021
I'm a gas-station owner.

572
01:04:26,297 --> 01:04:29,286
I already made the deal.
It's too late, Pop.

573
01:04:29,363 --> 01:04:31,556
You want me
to fix you something?

574
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:33,119
No.

575
01:04:38,663 --> 01:04:39,856
Hey.

576
01:04:59,697 --> 01:05:01,287
Here you go.

577
01:05:03,563 --> 01:05:05,189
How are you doing?

578
01:05:06,263 --> 01:05:10,196
I'm doing all right.
Tired.

579
01:05:10,263 --> 01:05:13,457
- You gonna eat something?
- Chocolate ice cream.

580
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:16,257
Plastic spoon.

581
01:05:17,964 --> 01:05:19,623
You got it.

582
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:25,056
Thank you.

583
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:31,161
- You're all set?
- Mmm-hmm.

584
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:35,320
- About time for you to get off?
- Mmm-hmm.

585
01:05:36,697 --> 01:05:39,095
Did you want me
to give you a ride?

586
01:05:40,363 --> 01:05:41,693
No...

587
01:05:41,763 --> 01:05:44,025
I really couldn't ask you
to do that.

588
01:05:44,097 --> 01:05:46,358
It's right on the way home.

589
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:55,756
- You sure you don't mind?
- No, I'd be happy to.

590
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:57,728
Okay.

591
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:03,484
- Hank: It's right on Prospect Street.
- Leticia: Clement's?

592
01:06:03,563 --> 01:06:05,927
- Yeah, Clement's.
- You bought Clement's?

593
01:06:05,997 --> 01:06:07,519
Yeah.

594
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,562
Leticia:
I know Clement.

595
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:13,858
- I can't stand that man.
- He ain't going to be running it.

596
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:16,021
Leticia:
Well, that's good.

597
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,562
Thanks for the ride.

598
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:20,892
Can I ask you
a question?

599
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,188
Why did you help me?

600
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:32,860
- What do you mean?
- When you took us to the hospital.

601
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:34,862
Why did you do that?

602
01:06:41,196 --> 01:06:43,719
I don't know. I guess--

603
01:06:43,797 --> 01:06:45,456
I just--

604
01:06:48,064 --> 01:06:51,154
doing the right thing,
I guess.

605
01:06:59,064 --> 01:07:01,222
My son died.

606
01:07:04,363 --> 01:07:06,091
And--

607
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:11,254
well, he--

608
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:13,421
he died and then--

609
01:07:16,463 --> 01:07:19,395
I never was
a very good father.

610
01:07:25,496 --> 01:07:27,485
He was a good kid.

611
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:34,589
I guess that somehow
I just--

612
01:07:37,097 --> 01:07:40,187
when I see what you're going
through there

613
01:07:40,263 --> 01:07:44,593
it made me think about something.
I don't know.

614
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:49,591
You know when you feel
like you can't breathe?

615
01:07:59,396 --> 01:08:03,056
And you can't
get out to--

616
01:08:05,797 --> 01:08:07,786
from inside yourself,
you know?

617
01:08:07,863 --> 01:08:09,351
Really.

618
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,819
Do you want
to come inside?

619
01:08:24,363 --> 01:08:26,727
I like these curtains.

620
01:08:30,196 --> 01:08:33,219
I got these here curtains
on credit.

621
01:08:33,296 --> 01:08:37,592
I never heard of anybody
getting curtains on credit before.

622
01:08:40,263 --> 01:08:43,286
What do you think?
Ain't they cute?

623
01:08:43,363 --> 01:08:46,227
I love these curtains.

624
01:08:46,296 --> 01:08:48,728
Hank: They're good
and red all right.

625
01:08:48,797 --> 01:08:50,888
I got--

626
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:55,658
I got these curtains right here
on credit.

627
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:58,696
And the man told me...

628
01:08:58,763 --> 01:09:01,524
that I wasn't supposed
to get this deal.

629
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:03,289
But I think
he liked me,

630
01:09:03,363 --> 01:09:06,727
and he told me I could have
these curtains on credit.

631
01:09:06,797 --> 01:09:08,729
I said,
what the hell?

632
01:09:08,797 --> 01:09:11,024
Red curtains
will be great for my place.

633
01:09:11,096 --> 01:09:12,960
So I said,
I'll take it.

634
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:16,826
- So I got me some red curtains.
- Damn straight.

635
01:09:19,496 --> 01:09:21,985
You sure suck
that whiskey down.

636
01:09:22,063 --> 01:09:24,996
I mean,
Lord have mercy.

637
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:33,589
My husband used to love him
some Jack Daniel's.

638
01:09:35,163 --> 01:09:37,993
Like I said,
it's a good drink.

639
01:09:42,029 --> 01:09:45,427
- Wait. I'll show you something.
- Okay.

640
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,393
Sit right here.

641
01:09:58,363 --> 01:10:02,295
What you got?
Some kind of a school annual?

642
01:10:02,363 --> 01:10:03,886
No.

643
01:10:03,963 --> 01:10:05,759
These pictures
right here--

644
01:10:08,697 --> 01:10:12,151
these are my husband's
drawings right here.

645
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:15,757
Lawrence.

646
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:19,193
My husband,
he drew those.

647
01:10:24,029 --> 01:10:28,428
He got himself electrocuted
over there in Jackson.

648
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:32,388
He got himself--

649
01:10:36,229 --> 01:10:40,059
These right here,
these are my son Tyrell's.

650
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:45,592
He drew these.

651
01:10:45,663 --> 01:10:47,856
He drew all of these
right here.

652
01:10:52,096 --> 01:10:55,494
He got his talent
from the old man, I guess.

653
01:10:55,563 --> 01:10:56,926
Didn't he?

654
01:10:56,996 --> 01:10:59,724
That's the only thing
that negro ever gave that boy,

655
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,695
was some drawing.

656
01:11:01,763 --> 01:11:03,729
Taught him
how to draw.

657
01:11:03,797 --> 01:11:06,956
It runs in the family,
sounds like it.

658
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,655
You know...

659
01:11:11,663 --> 01:11:13,720
he was a good kid.

660
01:11:13,797 --> 01:11:15,955
He was
a really good kid.

661
01:11:16,029 --> 01:11:18,154
He was so good.

662
01:11:18,229 --> 01:11:19,786
He was--

663
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:22,556
he really--
he loved me.

664
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:24,891
He really loved me.

665
01:11:24,963 --> 01:11:26,691
I understand.

666
01:11:29,663 --> 01:11:32,151
He was so fat.

667
01:11:33,396 --> 01:11:35,624
You saw how fat he was.

668
01:11:37,996 --> 01:11:40,360
I don't care what
I brought in this house,

669
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,055
he just ate it up!

670
01:11:42,129 --> 01:11:43,755
I don't care
what it was I brought in.

671
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:45,796
I bring
some Popeye's chicken,

672
01:11:45,862 --> 01:11:49,522
that boy eat the whole thing
before I can get a bite!

673
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:53,221
He would eat
his ass off!

674
01:11:54,296 --> 01:11:57,729
You haven't seen
nobody eat like--

675
01:11:59,563 --> 01:12:03,154
He would eat candy
and gumballs.

676
01:12:03,229 --> 01:12:06,354
He'd make me take him
to the Super K-Mart

677
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:09,918
and he put them quarters
in that gumball machine.

678
01:12:09,996 --> 01:12:12,690
He had to wait
till he get the red gumball.

679
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,455
He always had to get
the red gumball.

680
01:12:18,797 --> 01:12:21,558
He sounds like a character,
I guess.

681
01:12:24,029 --> 01:12:25,892
He'd get
that red gumball

682
01:12:25,963 --> 01:12:28,895
and he'd just eat
on that red gumball.

683
01:12:35,896 --> 01:12:37,226
Hey.

684
01:12:38,763 --> 01:12:40,661
I was a good mother.

685
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:45,560
I did-- every single thing
I can think to do--

686
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:48,562
I was really good.
I was really good.

687
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:51,790
- I was a good mother.
- I understand.

688
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:55,453
I didn't want him
to be fat like that.

689
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:57,927
I did not want my baby
to be fat like that,

690
01:12:57,996 --> 01:13:00,258
'cause I know,
a Black man in America,

691
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:02,818
you can't be like that!
And I tried to--

692
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:06,820
I was trying
to tell him,

693
01:13:06,896 --> 01:13:09,556
''You can't be like that,

694
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:11,653
you can't be like that
in America, and a Black man.''

695
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:13,491
I was just...

696
01:13:16,229 --> 01:13:19,820
I'm not sure
what you want me to do.

697
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:23,362
I want--

698
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:26,123
I want you
to make me feel better.

699
01:13:26,196 --> 01:13:29,094
I want you
to make me feel better.

700
01:13:30,163 --> 01:13:33,493
I want you
to make me feel good.

701
01:13:35,129 --> 01:13:37,254
I want you
to make me feel good.

702
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,558
Can you make me
feel good?

703
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:41,925
Can you make me
feel good?

704
01:13:41,996 --> 01:13:44,224
Can you make me
feel good?

705
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:47,592
Make me feel good.

706
01:13:50,196 --> 01:13:52,560
I don't know
what to feel good's about.

707
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:56,823
Just make me feel good!
Just make me feel good!

708
01:14:44,496 --> 01:14:46,961
(Leticia wails)

709
01:15:26,862 --> 01:15:28,590
(wailing)

710
01:15:36,463 --> 01:15:38,690
(Hank grunts)

711
01:16:19,296 --> 01:16:21,727
I felt it too.

712
01:16:23,729 --> 01:16:25,457
I needed you.

713
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:27,859
I needed you so much.

714
01:16:30,063 --> 01:16:32,495
I needed you so much.

715
01:16:33,996 --> 01:16:36,860
I hadn't felt anything
in so long.

716
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:42,688
Leticia: Thank you.

717
01:17:26,063 --> 01:17:28,393
(retching)

718
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,957
You okay?

719
01:17:45,363 --> 01:17:48,692
Me getting sick doesn't have
anything to do with you.

720
01:18:01,363 --> 01:18:03,295
Pop?

721
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:08,225
Hey, Pop?

722
01:18:09,296 --> 01:18:12,262
Buck:
I'm in the damn bathroom!

723
01:18:15,996 --> 01:18:17,791
Hank: What the hell
happened to you?

724
01:18:17,862 --> 01:18:20,828
I twisted my ankle
trying to take a bath.

725
01:18:21,896 --> 01:18:25,192
Damn it,
I told you to be careful.

726
01:18:28,862 --> 01:18:30,691
Buck: Goddamn!

727
01:18:32,163 --> 01:18:33,958
Hank:
Wiggle your toes.

728
01:18:38,762 --> 01:18:40,251
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

729
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:42,057
Yeah?

730
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:47,588
I'm sinking.

731
01:18:47,662 --> 01:18:51,220
- What are you talking about?
- I ain't worth shit.

732
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:56,755
- You stop that.
- I can't clean myself.

733
01:18:56,829 --> 01:19:00,125
Can't walk to the kitchen
without falling.

734
01:19:00,196 --> 01:19:04,026
Can't get to the phone
before it stops ringing.

735
01:19:05,196 --> 01:19:08,287
I don't feel
like a man anymore.

736
01:19:10,296 --> 01:19:12,285
You're a man, Pop.

737
01:19:13,363 --> 01:19:17,022
Can't even remember
what a woman smells like.

738
01:19:22,196 --> 01:19:24,355
(hammering in background)

739
01:19:42,529 --> 01:19:44,722
Girl:
There's a man here.

740
01:19:44,796 --> 01:19:46,092
Man: Where?

741
01:19:48,996 --> 01:19:50,393
Man: Thank you.

742
01:19:53,063 --> 01:19:56,052
- How are you doing?
- Hey, how are you doing?

743
01:19:56,129 --> 01:19:57,685
All right.

744
01:19:59,296 --> 01:20:01,921
What can I do for you?

745
01:20:01,996 --> 01:20:05,894
I got this '89 Comanche
out there...

746
01:20:07,129 --> 01:20:09,526
it needs a lube job,
new points and plugs.

747
01:20:09,595 --> 01:20:11,891
I was wondering
if you'd work on it for me.

748
01:20:13,296 --> 01:20:16,228
Yeah.
When do you need it by?

749
01:20:16,296 --> 01:20:18,625
Just as quick
as you can, really.

750
01:20:19,929 --> 01:20:21,451
Maggie!

751
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:23,893
Leave that alone, baby.
Put that down.

752
01:20:28,429 --> 01:20:31,691
I can get that to you
about tomorrow afternoon,

753
01:20:31,762 --> 01:20:33,319
late tomorrow then?

754
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:36,259
I'd appreciate it.

755
01:20:37,762 --> 01:20:41,990
Maybe them boys of yours can--
if they're not doing anything--

756
01:20:42,063 --> 01:20:44,654
wash it and wax it
and everything?

757
01:20:44,729 --> 01:20:46,354
I'm selling it.

758
01:20:46,429 --> 01:20:47,622
All right.

759
01:20:49,163 --> 01:20:51,390
I'll ask them.
I'll tell them about it.

760
01:20:51,462 --> 01:20:53,258
I'm sure
they wouldn't mind.

761
01:20:55,829 --> 01:20:58,022
I can't take this.

762
01:21:00,362 --> 01:21:02,124
It was my son's.

763
01:21:02,196 --> 01:21:06,628
It'd mean a lot to him.
He'd want somebody to use it.

764
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:08,992
I ain't saying
I don't want it.

765
01:21:10,362 --> 01:21:12,988
I just can't take it.

766
01:21:13,063 --> 01:21:15,222
I want you to have it.
I really do.

767
01:21:15,295 --> 01:21:17,159
It'd mean a lot to me.

768
01:21:22,662 --> 01:21:25,185
Let's just take it
for a little spin.

769
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:29,285
Come on.

770
01:21:32,063 --> 01:21:36,722
- I ain't even got my shoes on.
- We won't go far. Let's go.

771
01:21:40,163 --> 01:21:42,152
You see how it drives.

772
01:21:52,196 --> 01:21:55,719
- What the hell is this?
- Stick shift.

773
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:27,828
Hank:
Here's the insurance and title,

774
01:22:27,896 --> 01:22:30,124
and all the papers you need.
It's all set.

775
01:22:30,196 --> 01:22:34,252
- Okay.
- I'd like to see you tonight.

776
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:38,887
- We should do that.
- Is that all right?

777
01:22:45,762 --> 01:22:48,626
- I'll see you later.
- See you.

778
01:25:15,963 --> 01:25:17,656
Hank?

779
01:25:19,662 --> 01:25:21,026
Hank: That's good.

780
01:25:21,095 --> 01:25:23,152
Hello?

781
01:25:24,262 --> 01:25:25,193
Hank!

782
01:25:27,963 --> 01:25:30,224
It's Leticia.

783
01:25:35,762 --> 01:25:37,751
I'm coming on in,
Hank.

784
01:25:44,796 --> 01:25:46,489
Hank?

785
01:25:47,629 --> 01:25:49,458
Buck:
Who are you?

786
01:25:52,228 --> 01:25:55,524
You just walked
in my house?

787
01:25:55,595 --> 01:25:57,117
My bad.

788
01:25:57,195 --> 01:26:00,093
- I--
- Hank?

789
01:26:00,162 --> 01:26:03,458
- You're looking for Hank?
- Yes.

790
01:26:03,529 --> 01:26:05,791
Is he here?

791
01:26:05,862 --> 01:26:07,623
Who are you?

792
01:26:08,762 --> 01:26:12,285
My name
is Leticia Musgrove.

793
01:26:12,362 --> 01:26:13,726
And...

794
01:26:13,796 --> 01:26:16,125
me and Hank is...

795
01:26:17,995 --> 01:26:19,689
friends.

796
01:26:20,762 --> 01:26:22,989
Musgrove?

797
01:26:27,028 --> 01:26:29,221
Please,
little darling...

798
01:26:30,462 --> 01:26:32,984
have you got
a cigarette?

799
01:26:33,062 --> 01:26:34,961
Yeah.

800
01:26:36,062 --> 01:26:39,222
But it look to me like
you don't need to be smoking.

801
01:26:43,729 --> 01:26:45,695
Come on.

802
01:26:45,762 --> 01:26:47,819
Have you got one?

803
01:27:03,562 --> 01:27:05,187
Match?

804
01:27:16,829 --> 01:27:20,784
So, is Hank here?

805
01:27:22,295 --> 01:27:25,090
Yeah.
He'll be back shortly.

806
01:27:25,162 --> 01:27:27,685
I'm Buck, his father.

807
01:27:29,862 --> 01:27:32,259
Is that for Hank?

808
01:27:32,329 --> 01:27:33,761
Yeah.

809
01:27:33,829 --> 01:27:35,488
It's a gift.

810
01:27:38,395 --> 01:27:40,759
I'll see he gets it.

811
01:27:51,562 --> 01:27:53,585
Buck: Woo!

812
01:27:56,329 --> 01:27:57,693
Damn!

813
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:05,487
Hank must have done
something right

814
01:28:05,562 --> 01:28:08,027
to deserve
a fine hat like this.

815
01:28:10,495 --> 01:28:12,688
I guess he did.

816
01:28:12,762 --> 01:28:17,353
In my prime, I had a thing
for nigger juice myself.

817
01:28:19,062 --> 01:28:21,085
Hank's just
like his daddy.

818
01:28:22,162 --> 01:28:25,094
He ain't a man
till he split dark oak.

819
01:28:42,928 --> 01:28:46,122
Hey, Leticia?
Hang on.

820
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:47,821
Where are you going?

821
01:28:47,895 --> 01:28:50,657
Hey!
Where are you going?

822
01:28:50,729 --> 01:28:53,286
- What happened?
- I met your daddy.

823
01:28:53,362 --> 01:28:55,590
- Get off me!
- You can't do that.

824
01:28:55,662 --> 01:28:58,253
Give me a chance.
Whatever he did--

825
01:28:58,329 --> 01:29:00,352
It don't matter
a whole lot, do it?

826
01:29:00,429 --> 01:29:03,224
- Give me a chance to talk to you.
- Get off me!

827
01:29:22,228 --> 01:29:24,717
Buck:
We're family.

828
01:29:24,796 --> 01:29:27,626
I'm your father.
Remember that.

829
01:29:31,329 --> 01:29:32,693
Hank?

830
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:37,427
What's your problem?

831
01:29:41,962 --> 01:29:45,122
- Hank: I believe that's it.
- Thank you.

832
01:29:46,195 --> 01:29:49,161
I didn't date
that thing at the bottom.

833
01:29:49,228 --> 01:29:50,717
No problem.

834
01:29:50,795 --> 01:29:53,489
Anything below that line,
I didn't do.

835
01:29:56,729 --> 01:30:00,525
Now, you will take
good care of him?

836
01:30:00,595 --> 01:30:04,083
- Woman: Oh, yes.
- Hank: 'Cause...

837
01:30:05,595 --> 01:30:08,152
I want him
to go out in peace.

838
01:30:09,228 --> 01:30:11,750
You must love him
very much.

839
01:30:14,761 --> 01:30:16,591
No, I don't.

840
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:20,719
But he's my father.
So, there it is.

841
01:30:41,362 --> 01:30:44,658
They'll get you
a TV set tomorrow.

842
01:30:45,728 --> 01:30:48,217
Finally getting rid
of me, huh?

843
01:30:48,295 --> 01:30:51,022
They'll
take care of you.

844
01:30:51,095 --> 01:30:54,584
There's a telephone at the end
of the hall. You can call me.

845
01:30:54,662 --> 01:30:57,423
This is it.

846
01:30:57,495 --> 01:30:58,960
I guess so.

847
01:31:01,362 --> 01:31:03,021
I'm stuck.

848
01:31:05,095 --> 01:31:07,186
Me too.

849
01:31:09,662 --> 01:31:11,525
Buck: I don't want
to go out like this.

850
01:31:14,095 --> 01:31:15,958
Me neither.

851
01:31:20,529 --> 01:31:22,324
Goodbye, Pop.

852
01:32:19,628 --> 01:32:21,060
What?

853
01:32:23,861 --> 01:32:25,759
You want your car back?

854
01:32:25,828 --> 01:32:28,556
No, I don't
want the car back.

855
01:32:28,628 --> 01:32:30,595
I mean for you to keep that.

856
01:32:30,661 --> 01:32:32,321
What?

857
01:32:32,395 --> 01:32:35,361
I want you to know
I sent him away.

858
01:32:38,661 --> 01:32:40,957
I ain't got time to talk.

859
01:32:41,028 --> 01:32:43,823
I wish you would talk to me.

860
01:32:46,262 --> 01:32:48,251
Y'all ready to order?

861
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:24,225
- Hank: How are you doing, Ryrus?
- All right. How are you?

862
01:33:24,295 --> 01:33:27,022
- I'm all right.
- Who's Leticia?

863
01:33:29,162 --> 01:33:31,151
My girlfriend.

864
01:33:35,329 --> 01:33:38,658
Sheriff's Department.
Hello?

865
01:33:51,995 --> 01:33:54,586
- Who's banging on my door?
- The Sheriff's Department.

866
01:33:54,661 --> 01:33:58,150
- Time to go, lady.
- No, no wait.

867
01:33:58,228 --> 01:34:00,091
- Time to go.
- No. Here.

868
01:34:00,162 --> 01:34:02,128
No, I don't take
anything.

869
01:34:02,195 --> 01:34:04,218
You settle with your landlord,
then I go away.

870
01:34:04,295 --> 01:34:05,783
No,
I got the money.

871
01:34:05,861 --> 01:34:07,759
I suggest
you get fully dressed.

872
01:34:07,828 --> 01:34:11,920
- I'm going to put you out.
- You ain't putting me out.

873
01:34:12,995 --> 01:34:15,688
I 'bout got the money.
I'm still saving--

874
01:35:21,895 --> 01:35:23,918
I painted
the ceiling and the wall

875
01:35:23,995 --> 01:35:26,586
and fixed it up
a little bit.

876
01:35:26,661 --> 01:35:28,889
I figured I ought to.

877
01:35:28,962 --> 01:35:31,757
I'll move your stuff here
so you don't have to worry with it.

878
01:35:35,561 --> 01:35:38,721
I'm going to the kitchen
to get a thing or two

879
01:35:38,795 --> 01:35:43,353
so if you want to relax,
make yourself comfortable.

880
01:35:43,428 --> 01:35:45,054
Whatever you want to do.

881
01:36:33,228 --> 01:36:37,058
- This is Tyrell's.
- I thought I'd put it up there.

882
01:36:37,128 --> 01:36:39,151
That's my boy's room.

883
01:36:41,561 --> 01:36:43,323
All right. Here.

884
01:36:44,962 --> 01:36:47,087
You can go up
if you want to.

885
01:36:53,428 --> 01:36:55,258
Can I look at these?

886
01:36:55,329 --> 01:36:57,261
Yeah, go ahead.

887
01:37:04,661 --> 01:37:06,684
That's him right there.

888
01:37:10,028 --> 01:37:11,891
He don't look like you.

889
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:15,426
He got his mother in him.

890
01:37:29,328 --> 01:37:32,556
Hank: I don't mind sleeping
across the hall if you want me to.

891
01:37:32,628 --> 01:37:34,617
- Maybe you should sleep by yourself.
- No...

892
01:37:34,695 --> 01:37:36,957
I wouldn't feel good

893
01:37:37,028 --> 01:37:39,516
if you left me in here
all by myself.

894
01:37:40,594 --> 01:37:43,117
I just want you
to be comfortable here.

895
01:37:45,628 --> 01:37:48,355
I want you
to be comfortable too.

896
01:38:14,394 --> 01:38:16,587
Hank:
I want to take care of you.

897
01:38:18,062 --> 01:38:19,994
Leticia: Good.

898
01:38:20,062 --> 01:38:23,687
'Cause I really need
to be taken care of.

899
01:39:00,795 --> 01:39:03,352
Can I touch you?

900
01:39:07,828 --> 01:39:08,987
Yeah.

901
01:40:11,028 --> 01:40:13,459
Did you feel that?

902
01:40:15,261 --> 01:40:16,852
Oh yeah.

903
01:40:26,661 --> 01:40:28,684
Did it feel good?

904
01:40:33,561 --> 01:40:35,186
Yeah.

905
01:40:39,661 --> 01:40:42,126
I didn't hurt you
or anything?

906
01:40:44,127 --> 01:40:46,753
Not in a bad way.

907
01:41:02,895 --> 01:41:04,861
What?

908
01:41:07,028 --> 01:41:09,994
Nothing, I just--

909
01:41:12,995 --> 01:41:15,790
I want to go out
and buy some ice cream.

910
01:41:19,761 --> 01:41:21,784
- Now?
- Yeah.

911
01:41:24,494 --> 01:41:26,687
It just feels right.

912
01:41:32,494 --> 01:41:35,324
- Okay.
- Well...

913
01:41:38,094 --> 01:41:40,287
Can you buy me some?

914
01:41:40,361 --> 01:41:42,259
Yeah.

915
01:41:42,328 --> 01:41:44,487
What kind do you want?

916
01:41:46,628 --> 01:41:48,287
Chocolate.

917
01:44:55,927 --> 01:44:57,325
Hey.

918
01:44:58,428 --> 01:45:00,758
I bought
some chocolate ice cream.

919
01:45:03,761 --> 01:45:05,522
Are you okay?

920
01:45:08,894 --> 01:45:11,053
You sure?

921
01:45:17,127 --> 01:45:19,093
You look real pretty.

922
01:45:21,494 --> 01:45:23,551
Let's go out on the steps.
You want to?

923
01:45:25,161 --> 01:45:27,150
Let's go.

924
01:46:56,227 --> 01:46:59,625
I went by our station
on the way home.

925
01:46:59,695 --> 01:47:01,887
I like the sign.

926
01:47:18,461 --> 01:47:20,790
I think
we'll be all right.
