Sorry to keep you waiting.

We're looking for

How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?

73
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:17,053
But I understand
that you speak a little English.

- Yes.
- You do?

75
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:23,402
I hope you don't mind if I eat
while we talk. I've a bit of bad news.

76
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,530
Your country has suspended
all traveling privileges

77
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:29,302
on passports issued
by your government.

78
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:32,402
And our State Department
has revoked the visa

79
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,970
that was going to allow you
to enter the US.

80
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:37,846
That's it in a nutshell, basically.

81
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:42,377
While you were in the air there
was a military coup in your country.

82
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:45,549
Most of the dead were members
of the Presidential Guard.

83
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,219
They were attacked
in the middle of the night.

84
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:50,592
They got it all on GHN, I think.

There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.

Mr. Navorski, your country
was annexed from the inside.

00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,967
The Republic of Krakozhia
is under new leadership.

- Krakozhia.
- Right. I don't think he gets it.

00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:14,749
Er... Let me... OK. Look.

91
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:17,289
Imagine that these potato chips
are Krakozhia.

93

- Yes.

94
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:23,452
- Krakozhia.
- OK.

95
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,523
Er... So the potato chips are Krakozhia.

96
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,297
- And this apple...
- Big Apple. Big Apple.

97
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:34,169
...Big Apple represents
the Liberty Rebels.

98
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:36,965
OK?

99
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:41,111
No more Krakozhia! OK?

100
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:45,948
New government.
Revolution. You understand?

101
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,352
All the flights in and out
of your country have been suspended.

102
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:53,552
The new government has sealed all
borders, so your visa's no longer valid.

103
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:57,289
So, currently
you are a citizen of nowhere.

104
00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:59,354
Now, we can't process you new papers

105
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:05,428
until the US recognizes your country's
new diplomatic reclassification.

106
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:08,167
You don't qualify for asylum,
refugee status,

107
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:11,142
temporary protective status,
humanitarian parole,

108
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:15,307
or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.

109
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:17,372
You are at this time simply...

110
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:23,381
...unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

111
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,822
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

113
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:36,097

Cats has closed.

114
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:38,034
OK. OK.

115
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:41,198
Now I go New York City. Thank you.

116
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:45,438
No, Mr. Navorski. I cannot allow you
to enter the United States at this time.

117
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:49,073
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.

118
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:52,949
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.

119
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:58,480
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?

120
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:01,891
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.

121
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:04,361
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.

122
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,455
Really? It's not important.

123
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,934
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?

124
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:12,631
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.

125
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:14,969
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.

126
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,875
You have no right to enter the US
and I have no right to detain you.

127
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:21,505
You have fallen through
a crack in the system.

128
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:25,483
- I am crack.
- Yes. Until we get this sorted out,

129
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:29,818
I will allow you to enter
the International Transit Lounge.

130
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:33,484
I'm going to sign a release form
that is going to make you a free man.

131
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,824
- Free?
- Free. Free.

132
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:41,925
Free to go anywhere you like
in the International Transit Lounge.

133
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:43,992
- OK?
- OK.

134
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,470
- OK.
- OK.

135
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:47,699
OK.

136
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,436
Uncle Sam will have this
sorted out by tomorrow,

137
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,035
and welcome
to the United States. Almost.

138

[Dixon laughs]

139

This, in case we need to contact you,
is a pager.

151
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:47,130
You must keep this
with you at all times.

152
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,797
Here is an ID badge for you
to get into CBP. Beyond those doors...

I'm going to need you to look at me.

Beyond those doors is American soil.

155

Mr. Dixon wants me to make it clear

156
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:05,080
that you are not
to enter through those doors.

157
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:09,554
You are not to leave this building.

No. No food. I stuffed.

00:43:53,044 --> 00:43:55,512
OK. All right.

542
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:56,841
Thank you.

543
00:43:56,914 --> 00:44:00,680
So, Mr. Navorski,
I have some very good news for you.

544
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:02,548
What?

545
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,147
I've figured out a way
to get you out of this airport.

546
00:44:06,223 --> 00:44:07,850
How?

547
00:44:07,925 --> 00:44:12,123
Well, we have laws here
that protect aliens

548
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:15,825
who have a credible fear
of returning to their own country.

549
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,425
If we can establish this fear with you,

550
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:24,031
then the CBP will be forced
to begin Expedited Removal Procedures,

551
00:44:24,108 --> 00:44:29,978
to bring you to an immigration judge
and let you plead your case for asylum.

552
00:44:30,047 --> 00:44:32,208
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.

553
00:44:32,283 --> 00:44:37,346
Unfortunately, the courts
are so backed up with asylum cases

554
00:44:37,421 --> 00:44:42,324
that the soonest you'd get before
a judge would be six months from now.

555
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:46,090
Yes, and we would have no choice

556
00:44:46,163 --> 00:44:51,396
but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law. You'd be released.

557
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:54,666
You would be free to wait
in New York until your court date.

558
00:44:54,739 --> 00:45:00,075
But, believe it or not, most people
never show up before the judge.

559
00:45:00,144 --> 00:45:04,046
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.

560
00:45:04,115 --> 00:45:06,481
You can go to New York City tonight.

561
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:11,613
But, you only get to go
if we can establish a credible fear.

562
00:45:11,689 --> 00:45:13,384
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.

563
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:14,947
- Fear.
- Fear.

564
00:45:15,026 --> 00:45:17,256
From what?

565
00:45:17,328 --> 00:45:19,159
That's the best part.

566
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,724
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.

567
00:45:23,801 --> 00:45:26,326
So I'm going to ask you one question,

568
00:45:26,404 --> 00:45:30,704
if you give me the correct answer, I can
get you out of this airport tonight.

569
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:35,068
So, I answer one question.

570
00:45:36,447 --> 00:45:38,915
Go to New York City. Tonight.

571
00:45:38,983 --> 00:45:40,280
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

- Tonight.
- Tonight.

- [laughs] OK.
- OK.

574
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:49,886
All right.

575
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,624
Do you, at this time, have any fear
of returning to your own country?

576
00:45:54,698 --> 00:45:56,689
No.

577
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:03,906
OK. Let me try it again.

578
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:07,876
- Your country's at war.
- Yes. War.

579
00:46:07,945 --> 00:46:11,437
There are men in the streets
with guns. Political persecution.

580
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:13,915
- Yes. It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.

581
00:46:13,984 --> 00:46:16,179
And God only knows
what could happen.

582
00:46:16,253 --> 00:46:18,881
Innocent people
are torn from their beds.

583
00:46:18,956 --> 00:46:21,857
On Tuesdays. I hate Tuesdays.

584
00:46:21,926 --> 00:46:24,019
So you're afraid.

585
00:46:24,095 --> 00:46:27,292
- From what?
- Krakozhia.

586
00:46:27,364 --> 00:46:30,197
You're afraid of Krakozhia.

587
00:46:30,267 --> 00:46:32,292
Krakozhia?

588
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:38,865
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.

589
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:44,781
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.

590
00:46:44,849 --> 00:46:45,838
Human rights.

591
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:50,785
Viktor, please don't be afraid
to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.

592
00:46:51,722 --> 00:46:56,284
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.

593
00:46:58,262 --> 00:47:02,221
So? I go to New York City now?

594
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:05,825
- No.
- No?

595
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:09,562
OK.

596
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,770
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.

- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.

I'm afraid from Wolfmens,
afraid from sharks.

599
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,951
Thanks a lot.

- Damn.

- Nobody read the sign in America.

I change my schedule to meet you.

Don't lie to me, OK?

- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.

634
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:38,149
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,

635
00:49:38,222 --> 00:49:41,555
I just stare at him over room service.

636
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:43,957
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.

637
00:49:45,562 --> 00:49:50,397
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.

638
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:54,630
That we belong together.

639
00:49:57,408 --> 00:50:01,902
This... man... has you.

640
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:07,479
Why he need... puzzle?

641
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:11,450
This is my problem.

642
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:13,956
I always see men
the way I want to see them.

643
00:50:19,463 --> 00:50:22,455
Do I know you from someplace?

644
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:25,434
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes. Second floor.

645
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:30,803
Oh...

646
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:32,865
You headed for home?

647
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:36,774
Er... No, no. I am...

648
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:41,113
I am delayed a long time.

649
00:50:41,185 --> 00:50:45,246
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?

650
00:50:45,322 --> 00:50:50,817
I go from one building
to another building.

651
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:54,057
I have beeper.

652
00:50:54,131 --> 00:50:58,693
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.

653
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:04,167
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.

654
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:05,469
What's "BH"?

655

- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?

658
00:51:16,387 --> 00:51:18,514
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

659
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:20,580
Nice to see you again.

660
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,828
You like Italian food?

661
00:51:25,896 --> 00:51:28,888
I know, it's late
and you've probably got other plans,

662
00:51:28,966 --> 00:51:33,630
but if you'd like to grab some dinner,
we can run right out and catch a cab.

663
00:51:33,704 --> 00:51:37,196
I know a place
that has the greatest cannelloni.

664
00:51:37,274 --> 00:51:38,798
Erm...

665
00:51:38,876 --> 00:51:41,344
No, I... I can't.

666
00:51:41,412 --> 00:51:43,277
- You married?
- No.

667
00:51:43,347 --> 00:51:46,282
- Girlfriend?
- No.

668
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:51,879
I... I can't go out... with you.

669
00:51:55,092 --> 00:51:58,823
God. I am so... I'm so sorry.

670
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:00,158
I am so sorry.

671
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:03,063
I must come off
like a complete nut job or something.

672
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:06,432
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.

673
00:52:06,503 --> 00:52:08,494
Wet floor. Wet floor.

674
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:11,836
- [Viktor] I...
- [Amelia] You don't have to explain.

675
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:12,910
No, I... Please, I...

In New York restaurant,

680
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:28,216
I don't know. Maybe 15 bucks.

00:52:28,292 --> 00:52:30,522
- Dollars?

Two people, 40 dollars.

684
00:52:43,207 --> 00:52:46,108
Two people, 40 dollars.

685
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:55,485
I... I... help you?

686
00:52:55,552 --> 00:53:00,148
I'm so sorry, sir.
The position has already been filled.

687
00:53:05,796 --> 00:53:09,596
- Do you live nearby?
- Yes. Gate 67.

688
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:14,968
Because we are very particular
about punctual... Did you say Gate 67?

689
00:53:15,038 --> 00:53:16,903
Gate 67.

00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:18,805
[laughs]

691
00:53:20,878 --> 00:53:22,869
You got to be kidding.

You got to help me help you.
I don't see a Social Security number...

...mailing address,
even a phone number.

694
00:53:30,487 --> 00:53:35,288
Telephone? You need? I get.
I get. I get phone.

All right.
When's the best time to reach you?

698
00:53:57,614 --> 00:53:58,706

707
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:53,429
Yeah, so could you please
go sit someplace else?

708
00:54:53,503 --> 00:54:56,404
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.

709
00:54:56,473 --> 00:54:57,838

- Who are you?
- [worker] It's no one.

715
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:36,313
[worker] There's no one here for
two weeks. This isn't one of my guys.

716
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:44,455
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.

717
00:56:44,529 --> 00:56:47,362
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?

718
00:56:47,432 --> 00:56:49,593
Does Harry think
he's running this job?

719
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:51,862
- [Viktor] I go now.
- Go? Go where?

720
00:56:51,936 --> 00:56:54,496
- Gate 67.
- 67?

721
00:56:54,572 --> 00:56:56,699
We're ten months away from 67.

722
00:56:56,775 --> 00:57:00,302
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...

723
00:57:00,378 --> 00:57:02,778
Harry's trying to make me look bad.

724
00:57:02,847 --> 00:57:05,372
I've got to slow him down
before he gets to 67.

725
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:08,248
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.

- Here.

Come on, sit down.

00:58:23,895 --> 00:58:28,355
- Who invited him?
- I did. We needed a fourth, right?

742
00:58:28,433 --> 00:58:31,596
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?

743
00:58:31,669 --> 00:58:34,695
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?

744
00:58:34,772 --> 00:58:39,436
He could be recording
everything we say. A wire in his shirt.

745
00:58:39,511 --> 00:58:41,877
A microphone up in his ass.

00:58:43,314 --> 00:58:48,047
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.

00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:50,849
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.

748
00:58:52,724 --> 00:58:54,715
Close your eyes.

- OK. So you are clean.
- Good. Let's play cards.

I will have money.
But... Friday.

It might be the blues.

Yeah. Cher.

I checked it out.
There were witnesses.

- Hurry up.

781
