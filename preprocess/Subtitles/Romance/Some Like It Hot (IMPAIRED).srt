Oh... How about it? Has Poliakoff got
anything for us? We're desperate.

156
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,668
Well, it just so happens
he is looking for a bass.

157
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,586
And a sax.

158
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,171
Right?

159
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,048
Right.

160
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,008
- What's the job?
- Three weeks in Florida.

161
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,219
- Florida?
- At the Seminole-Ritz in Miami.

162
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,930
Transportation and expenses all paid.

163
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,975
Isn't she a bit of terrific?
Let's see Poliakoff.

164
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,936
Hold on. He's got people with him.
You'll have to wait, boys.

165
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,062
All right, we'll wait.

166
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,565
Look, Gladys,
it's three weeks in Florida.

167
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,317
Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.

168
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,279
They need a couple of girls
on sax and bass.

169
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:28,116
Whaddaya mean, who is it?
It's Poliakoff. I got a job for ya.

170
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,159
Gladys. Are ya there?

171
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,953
Gladys!

172
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,124
<i>Meshugeneh.</i>
Played 112 hours at a marathon dance.

173
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,876
Now she's in bed
with nervous collapse.

174
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,795
- Tell her to move over.
- What about Cora Jackson?

175
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,299
Last I heard, she was playin'
with the Salvation Army.

176
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,509
Drexel 9044.

177
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,761
Oh, those idiot broads.

178
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,974
Here we are, packed and ready to leave
for Miami, and what happens?

179
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:58,229
The sax runs off with a Bible salesman
and the bass fiddle gets pregnant.

180
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,356
Bienstock, I oughta fire you.

181
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,818
Me? I'm the manager,
not the night watchman.

182
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,571
Hello. Let me talk to Bessie Malone.

183
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,324
What's she doing in Philadelphia?

184
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,910
On the level?

185
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,495
Bessie let her hair grow
and is playing with Stokowski.

186
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:18,666
- Black Bottom Bessie?
- Schpielt zich mit der Philharmonic.

187
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,793
How about Rosemary Schultz?

188
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,754
Slashed her wrists when Valentino died.

189
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,466
We might as well all slash our wrists
unless we round up two dames by tonight.

190
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,052
You know the kind of girls we need.
We don't care where you find them.

191
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,012
Just get them on
that train by 8 o'clock.

192
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,889
[speaks foreign language]

193
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,266
The moment anything turns up,
I'll give you a tinkle.

194
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,186
Bye, Sig. I wonder
if I've got room for another ulcer.

195
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,688
Nellie, get me long-distance.

196
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,815
- Look, Sig, we wanna talk to you.
- What is it?

197
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,360
- About the Florida job.
- The Florida job?

198
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,612
- Nellie told us about it.
- We're not too late, are we?

199
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,281
What are ya? Couple of comedians?
Get out of here.

200
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,992
Long distance? Get me the
William Morris Agency in New York.

201
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,702
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?

202
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,704
The instruments are right
but you're not.

203
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,373
I wanna speak to Mr. Morris.

204
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,584
- Wait, what's wrong with us?
- You're the wrong shape. Goodbye.

205
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,962
Wrong shape? What are you looking for?
Hunchbacks or something?

206
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,048
- It's not the backs that worry me.
- What kind of a band is it?

207
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,384
- You gotta be under 25.
- We could pass for that.

208
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,094
- Gotta be blond.
- We could dye our hair.

209
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,345
And you gotta be girls.

210
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,263
- We could...
- No, we couldn't.

211
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,058
- Mr. William Morris.
- You mean this is a girls' band?

212
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,686
Yeah, that's what he means. Good
old Nellie. I could wring her neck.

213
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,853
I'm holding on.

214
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,481
Let's talk this over.
Why couldn't we do it?

215
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,609
Last year when we worked in the
gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.

216
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,570
Remember when you booked us with
the Hawaiian band, we wore grass skirts.

217
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,741
- What's with him? He drinks?
- No, he ain't eatin' so good.

218
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,576
Got an empty stomach
and it's gone to his head.

219
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,912
Joe, this is three weeks in Florida.

220
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,914
We could borrow clothes
from the chorus girls.

221
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,916
- You've flipped your wig.
- Now you're talking.

222
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:46,045
Now he is talking! We get
second-hand wigs, a little padding.

223
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,840
We call ourselves
Josephine and Geraldine.

224
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,926
- Josephine and Geraldine... Come on.
- Yeah.

225
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,013
Look, if you wanna pick up
a little money tonight,

226
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,183
at the University of Illinois
they're havin' a St. Valentine's dance.

227
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,728
- We'll take it.
- You got it. $6 a man.

228
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,771
Be on the campus
at Urbana at 8 o'clock.

229
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,649
All the way to Urbana
for a one-night stand?

230
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,819
It's $12. We can get
one of the overcoats out of hock.

231
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,072
Hello. Mr. Morris?
This is Poliakoff in Chicago.

232
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,701
You wouldn't happen to have a couple
of girl musicians available, would you?

233
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,244
A sax player and a bass?

234
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,038
Look, if William Morris
doesn't come through...

235
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,457
Come on, Geraldine.

236
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,420
It's 100 miles. It's snowin' outside.
How do we get there?

237
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,130
- I'll think of something.
- Like what?

238
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,674
- Don't crowd me.
- "Don't crowd me..."

239
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,470
- How'd it go, girls?
- Ooh, you! I oughta wring your neck.

240
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,264
Please, Jerry. That's no way to talk.

241
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,225
Nellie baby, what are you doin' tonight?

242
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:45,438
- Tonight? Why?
- 'Cause I've got some plans.

243
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:49,067
- I'm not doing anything.
- Really?

244
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:53,112
I just thought I'd go home
and have some cold pizza.

245
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,031
Then you'll be in all evening?

246
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,075
Yes, Joe.

247
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,243
Good. Then you won't
be needing your car.

248
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,413
My car? Why, you...

249
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,418
Isn't he a bit of terrific?

250
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,797
[wind howls]

251
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,514
We coulda had three weeks
in Florida, all expenses paid.

252
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,934
Lyin' in the sun,
palm trees, flyin' fish...

253
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,519
Knock it off, will ya?

254
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,526
Possible straight, possible nothing,
and a pair of eights.

255
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,531
All right, drop 'em, you guys.

256
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,991
- Drop what?
- We came for a car.

257
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,744
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

258
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,666
Musicians.

259
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,376
Wise guys.

260
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,920
OK, let's go. Aces bet.

261
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,006
It's a '25 Hupmobile,
green, coupe... sir.

262
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,425
- It's over here.
- [Jerry] Yeah, over here.

263
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:01,556
- Want some gas?
- Yeah, about 40 cents' worth, please.

264
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,892
- Put it on Miss Weinmeyer's bill?
- Uh... Yeah. Why not?

265
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,019
And while you're at it, fill it up.

266
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,689
[tires screech]

267
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,740
All right, everybody. Hands up.

Face the wall.

269
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,332
You too, Toothpick.

270
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:33,796
Come on.

271
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,436
Hey. Join us.

272
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,657
OK, boss.

273
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,256
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.

274
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,550
What is it, Spats?
What are you doin' here?

275
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,636
[Spats]
I just dropped in to pay my respects.

276
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,971
- You don't owe me nothin'.
- I wouldn't say that.

277
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,641
You were nice enough to recommend
my mortuary to your friends.

278
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,142
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

279
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,311
Now I got all
those coffins on my hands.

280
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,981
- And I hate to see 'em go to waste.
- I had nothin' to do with it.

281
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,902
Oh, too bad, Charlie.
You woulda had three eights.

282
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,117
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- No, Spats, no.

283
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,869
No, Spats. Please, no.

284
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,835
I think I'm gonna be sick.

285

[liquid gushes]

286
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,678
All right, come on outta there.

Come on.

288
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:13,145
- We didn't see anything. Did we?
- What? No. Not a thing.

289
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,524
Besides, it's none of our business
if you guys wanna bump each other off.

290
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,529
Say... Don't I know you two
from somewhere?

291
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,323
Oh, no. We're just
a couple of musicians.

292
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,201
We came to pick up a car.
Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

293
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,370
There's a dance tonight.

294
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,872
- Come on, Jerry.
- Wait a minute.

295
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,207
Where do you think you're goin'?

296
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,627
Urbana. It's about
100 miles from here, so don't...

297
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,879
You're not goin' nowhere.

298
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,884
- We're not?
- [Spats] I don't like no witnesses.

299
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,388
- [Joe] We won't breathe a word.
- You won't breathe nothin'.

300
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,682
Not even air.

All right, boys, let's blow out of here.
We'll take care of those guys later.

I think they got me.

If they catch us, there'll be blood
all over. Type O. Come on.

- As far away as possible.

It's not far enough. Those guys know us.
Every hood in Chicago will be after us.

00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,986
- Gimme a nickel.
- All right.

You're gonna call the police?

314

Police? We'd never live to testify
against Spats Colombo.

Joe, we gotta get out of town.
Maybe we should grow beards.

317
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,331
We are getting out of town,
but we're gonna shave.

- Shave?
- Shave.

319

At a time like this? They wanna blast
our heads off, and you wanna shave.

- Shave our legs, stupid.

What's the matter now?

How do they walk in these things?
How do they keep their balance?

331
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,222
Must be the way the weight

- I feel naked.

My name is Josephine, and this was
your idea in the first place.

Look at that. Look how she moves.

That's just like JELL-O on springs.

Nobody's asking you to have a baby.

00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,832
This is just to get us out of town.

Once we get to Florida,
we'll blow this whole setup.

Joe, this time, I am not gonna
let you talk me into something...

Extra. Extra. Seven slaughtered

- Are you two from the Poliakoff Agency?

- Yes. We're the new girls.
- Brand new.

356

And I'm Sweet Sue.

you girls. You saved our lives.

- You're welcome.

Oh! The feeling's mutual.

- Upsy-daisy.
- Fresh.

Looks like Poliakoff came through
with a couple of real ladies.

- Oh, I don't wear one myself.

00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,992
- Don't you bulge?
- Huh? Bulge? Me?

384
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,371
I have the most divine seamstress.
Comes in just once a month.

385
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,831
- She is so inexpensive and she told...
- Come on, Daphne.

Oh, all right.

387
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,586
Say, do you know the one
about the girl tuba player

388
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,547
who was stranded on a desert island
with a one-legged jockey?

389
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,590
No. How does it go?

390
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,093
[Bienstock] Cut it out, girls.
No rough talk.

391
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,845
They went to a conservatory.

00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:13,148
- Like fallin' into a tub of butter.
- Watch it, Daphne.

396
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:17,361
When I was a kid, Joe, I dreamed I was
locked up overnight in a pastry shop.

397
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,363
And there was goodies all around.

398
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:24,368
Jelly rolls, mocha éclairs, sponge cake,
and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts...

399
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,955
Listen to me: no butter, no pastry.
We're on a diet.

400
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,124
Yeah, sure, Joe.

401
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,377
Not there. That's the emergency brake.

402
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,214
Now you've done it.
Now you have done it!

403
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,592
- Done what?
- You tore off one of my chests.

404
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,887
- You'd better go get it fixed.
- You'd better come help me.

This way, Daphne.

407
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,860
Now you tore the other one.

408
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,911
Hm...!

409
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,248
Terribly sorry.

410
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,834
It's OK. I was scared it was Sweet Sue.

411
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,545
- You won't tell anybody, will you?
- [Josephine] Tell what?

412
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,090
If they catch me once more,
they'll kick me out of the band.

413
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,886
Are you the replacement
for the bass and sax?

414
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,888
That's us. And I'm Daphne.

- I'm Sugar Cane.
- Hi.

418
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,522
- Sugar Cane?
- I changed it from Sugar Kowalczyk.

419
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,526
- Polish?
- Yes. I come from this musical family.

420
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,112
My mother's a piano teacher.
My father was a conductor.

421
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,449
- Where did he conduct?
- On the Baltimore and Ohio.

422
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,075
Oh.

423
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,955
- I play the ukulele, and I sing, too.
- [Daphne] Sings, too...

424
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,709
I don't have much of a voice,
but this isn't much of a band, either.

425
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,836
I'm only with them
'cause I'm running away.

426
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:01,799
- Running away from what?
- Oh, don't get me started on that.

427
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,259
Hey, you want some? It's bourbon.

428
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,846
I'll take a rain check.
[nervous chuckling, snorts]

I don't want you to think I'm a drinker.

430
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,185
I can stop any time I want to,
only I don't want to.

431
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,687
- Especially when I'm blue.
- [Josephine] We understand.

432
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:19,900
All the girls drink. But I'm the one
that gets caught. Story of my life.

433
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,778
I always get the
fuzzy end of the lollipop.

434
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,743
Are my seams straight?

435
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,411
I'll say.

436
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,999
- See you around, girls.
- Bye, Sugar.

437
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,419
[giggling] We have been playing
with the wrong bands.

438
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,256
- Down, Daphne.
- See the shape of that liquor cabinet?

439
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,259
Forget it. One false move
and they'll toss us off the train.

440
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,762
Then it's the police,
the papers and the Mob in Chicago.

441
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,974
Boy, would I love to
borrow a cup of that Sugar.

442
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,600
Look...

443
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:57,020
No pastry, no butter - and no Sugar.

444
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,440
You tore 'em again.

Playing square dances?

No. Funerals.

This is the last straw. In Kansas you
smuggled liquor in a shampoo bottle.

could I have my flask, please?

Sure. Pack your things.
At the next station... Your flask?

Yes. Just a little bourbon.

about saxophone players.

But you're a girl - thank goodness.
That's why I joined this band.

they're borrowing money from you,

Then one morning you wake up,
the guy's gone, the saxophone's gone.

all squeezed out.

<i>George White's Scandals opened,</i>

760
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,255
she packed me off to Florida.

761
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:56,427
Right now she thinks I'm out
on my yacht, deep-sea fishing.

762
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:01,682
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding.
You're barking up the wrong fish.

763
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:06,062
If I promise not to be a naughty boy,
how about dinner tonight?

764
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,273
- I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.
- Oh, of course.

765
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,942
- Which instrument do you play?
- Bull fiddle.

766
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,527
Oh, fascinating.

767
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,988
Do you use a bow,
or do you just pluck it?

768
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,076
Most of the time, I slap it.
[chuckling]

769
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,994
You must be quite a girl.

770
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,622
- Wanna bet?
- [both chuckling]

771
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:28,501
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.
You know, sort of a contortionist.

772
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:32,088
She could smoke a cigarette
while holding it between her toes.

773
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,631
Zowie!

774
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,800
- But Mama broke it up.
- Why?

775
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,260
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

776
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,473
- Bye-bye, Mr. Fielding.
- Bye-bye?

777
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:45,684
- This is where I get off.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

778
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,853
You don't get off that easy.

779
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,564
All right, driver.
Once around the park, slowly.

780
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,858
And keep your eyes on the road.

781
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,496
What kind of a girl
do you think I am, Mr. Fielding?

782
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:10,084
- Oh, please. It won't happen again.
- I'll say.

783
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,753
- Please, come back.
- I'll walk, thank you.

784
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,005
Oh, please, miss...

785
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,135
Zowie!

786
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,179
All right, girls. Here are
your room assignments.

787
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:25,099
My glasses. Where are my glasses?

788
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,060
Olga and Mary Lou are in 412.

789
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,021
And, Mary Lou, will you keep your kimono
buttoned when you ring for room service?

790
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,482
- Well!
- Josephine and Daphne are in 413.

791
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,860
- Thank you.
- Dolores and Sugar in 414.

792
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,194
Me and Sugar?

793
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,697
What did you expect?
A one-legged jockey?

794
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,699
Rosella and Emily in 415...

795
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,910
- I wish they'd put us in the same room.
- So do I.

796
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:48,581
But don't worry about it, Sugar.
We'll see a lot of each other.

797
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:54,211
414... That's the same room number
I had in Cincinnati,

798
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,463
my last time around with a male band.

799
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,215
What a heel he was.

800
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:02,136
- A saxophone player?
- What else? Was I ever crazy about him.

801
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,264
At two in the morning he sent me down
for hot dogs and potato salad.

802
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,017
They were out of potato salad,
so I brought coleslaw.

803
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:12,104
- So he threw it right in my face.
- Forget saxophone players.

804
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,773
You're gonna meet
a millionaire - a young one.

805
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:18,777
- What makes you so sure?
- [chuckles] My feminine intuition.

806
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,246
- Oh. Are these your bags?
- Mm-hm.

807
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:33,292
- And that one, too.
- OK, doll.

808
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:37,463
- I suppose you want a tip.
- Ah, forget it, doll.

809
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,882
After all, you work here
and I work here.

810
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,927
Believe you me, it's nice to
have you with the organization.

811
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,054
- Bye-bye.
- Listen, doll.

812
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,140
- What time do you get off tonight?
- Why?

813
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,560
I'm workin' the night shift and
I got a bottle of gin stashed away.

814
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,645
When there's a lull...

815
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,231
Don't you think you're
a little young for that, sonny?

816
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:58,984
Oh, you wanna see my driver's license?

817
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,445
Get lost, will you?

818
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:04,990
That's the way I like 'em -
big and sassy.

819
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,369
Oh, and, uh... get rid of your roommate.

820
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,666
[sighs]

821
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,302
- Dirty old man.
- What happened?

822
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,764
- I just got pinched in the elevator.
- Now you know how the other half lives.

823
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,099
Look at that. I'm not even pretty.

824
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,309
They don't care,
so long as you're wearing a skirt.

825
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,395
It's like waving a red flag
in front of a bull.

826
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,064
Really? Well, I'm sick of being
the flag. I wanna be a bull again.

827
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,274
What do you say? Let's get outta here.

828
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,525
- Let's blow.
- Blow where?

829
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,028
You promised me that the minute
we hit Florida we were gonna beat it.

830
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:47,241
- How can we? We're broke.
- We can find another band. A male band.

831
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,409
Look, stupid...

832
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:52,538
Right now, Spats Colombo is looking for
us in every male band in the country.

833
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,791
- It's so humiliating.
- So you got pinched. So what?

834
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,751
Would you rather be
picking lead out of your navel?

835
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:00,754
All right, all right. But how long
do you think we keep this up?

836
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,632
- What's the beef? We're sittin' pretty.
- Huh?

837
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,094
Look. We get room and board.
We're getting paid every week. Look.

838
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,722
Look at the palm trees, flying fish...

839
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,016
What are you givin' me with flyin' fish?

840
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,476
I know why you wanna stay.
You're after Sugar.

841
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,855
- Me, after Sugar?
- I saw the both of you in that bus.

842
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,025
All lovey-dovey and whisperin'
and borrowin' each other's lipstick.

843
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,067
I saw you!

- What are you saying? Me and Sugar?
- You and Sugar.

- We're just like sisters.
- Well, I'm your fairy godmother.

And I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

- [Bienstock] Are you decent?

848
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,960
Come in.

849
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,964
You girls seen a brown bag
with a white stripe and my initials?

850
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,633
- A what?
- My suitcase with my resort clothes.

851
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:49,261
- No, we haven't.
- I can't understand it.

First my glasses disappear,
then one of my suitcases.

- Where's my ukulele?
- Now a ukulele.

854
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,768
There must be a
sneak thief around here.

Oh! Here it is. Hi, Sug.

A bunch of us girls are gonna
go for a swim. Wanna come along?

A swim. Oh, you betcha.

Just a minute, Daphne.
You haven't got a bathing suit.

She doesn't need one.
I don't have one either.

See? She doesn't have one either.
You don't?

861
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,534
We can rent some at the bathhouse.
How about you, Josephine?

862
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,204
No, thanks. I think I'll stay in
and soak in a hot tub.

863
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,957
- On a day like this? It's lovely out.
- Yeah, well, let her soak. Come on.

Cheerio.

908
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:48,000
- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- Not very likely.

909
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,794
- Are you staying at the hotel?
- Not at all.

910
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,671
Your face is familiar.

911
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,132
Possible you've seen it
in newspapers or magazines.

912
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,552
<i>- Uh... Vanity Fair.</i>
- That must be it.

913
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,180
Would you mind moving just a little,
please? You're blocking my view.

914
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,557
Your view? Of what?

915
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:07,519
They run up a red-and-white flag on
the yacht when it's time for cocktails.

916
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,855
You own a yacht?

917
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,066
Which one is it? The big one?

918
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,485
Certainly not.
With all the unrest in the world,

919
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:18,530
I don't think anybody should have
a yacht that sleeps more than 12.

920
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,366
I quite agree.

921
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,744
Tell me, who runs up that flag?

922
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,038
- Your wife?
- No, my flag steward.

923
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:29,416
Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?

924
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,044
No, my cocktail steward.

925
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,838
Look, if you're interested
in whether I am married or not...

926
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,883
- Oh, I'm not interested at all.
- Well, I'm not.

927
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,177
That's very interesting.

928
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,683
- How's the stock market?
- Up, up, up.

929
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:49,519
I'll bet while we were talking,
you made $100,000?

930
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,688
Could be. You play the market?

931
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:55,067
- No, the ukulele. And I sing, too.
- For your own amusement?

932
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:57,069
A bunch of us girls
are appearing at the hotel.

933
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,904
Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.

934
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:03,825
- Oh! You're society girls.
- Oh, yes, quite. Bryn Mawr, Vassar...

935
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,203
We're just doing this for a lark.

936
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:10,874
Syncopators. Does that mean you play
that very fast music... jazz?

937
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:13,627
Yeah. Real hot.

938
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:17,464
I guess some like it hot.
I personally prefer classical music.

939
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,132
Oh, I do, too.

940
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:23,720
As a matter of fact, I spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

941
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:28,392
Good school. Your family
doesn't object to your career?

942
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,895
They do indeed. Daddy threatened
to cut me off without a cent.

943
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,271
But I don't care. It was such a bore.

944
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,982
- You know. Coming-out parties.
- Inauguration balls.

945
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,443
- Opening at the opera.
- Riding to hounds.

946
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:41,446
And always the same 400.

947
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:44,324
You know, it's amazing we never
ran into each other before.

948
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:47,452
I'm sure I would have remembered
anybody as attractive as you.

949
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:51,331
You're very kind. I'll bet
you're also gentle and helpless.

950
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,874
I beg your pardon?

951
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,460
You see, I have a theory
about men who wear glasses.

952
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:59,005
- What theory?
- I'll tell you when I know you better.

953
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:01,800
- What are you doing tonight?
- Uh... Tonight?

954
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,678
Maybe you could come
to the hotel and hear us play.

955
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,139
I would like to, but that
would be rather difficult.

956
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,223
Why?

957
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,476
I only come ashore twice a day
when the tide goes out.

958
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:14,521
It's on account of these shells.
That's my hobby.

959
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,482
- You collect shells?
- Yes, so did my father and grandfather.

960
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:20,152
You might say we had
a passion for shells.

961
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,946
That's why we named
the oil company after it.

962
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:28,910
- Shell Oil?
- Please, no names. Just call me Junior.

963
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,455
Sugar! Sugar!

964
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:32,998
Come on, dear.
Time to change for dinner.

965
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,750
Run along, Daphne dear.
I'll catch up with you later.

966
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,251
Oh. OK.

967
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,179
No...

968
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:49,389
What is it, young lady?
What are you staring at?

969
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,349
This happens to me
all the time in public.

970
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:53,852
I recognized him, too.
His picture was in Vanity Fair.

971
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:54,978
<i>Vanity Fair?</i>

972
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,440
- Would you move along, please?
- Yes. You're in his way.

973
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,484
He's waiting for a signal
from his yacht.

974
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,444
His yacht?

975
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:06,740
It sleeps 12. This is my friend Daphne.
She's a Vassar girl.

976
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,158
I'm a what?

977
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,368
Or was it Bryn Mawr?

978
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:15,373
I heard a very sad story
about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.

979
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,209
She squealed on her roommate

980
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:20,128
and they found her strangled
with her own brassiere.

981
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:25,300
Yes. We have to be very careful
whom we pick for a roommate. Hm?

982
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,928
Well, I think I'd better be going.

983
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:30,680
It was delightful meeting you both.

984
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,558
- You will come and hear us play?
- If it's at all possible.

985
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:36,144
Oh, do come. Don't disappoint us.
It'll be such fun.

986
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:39,231
- And bring your yacht.
- Come on, Daphne.

987
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:49,407
- How about that guy?!
- Hands off. I saw him first.

988
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:54,788
Sugar, a little advice. If I were
a girl, and I am, I'd watch my step.

989
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:57,290
If I'd been watching my step,
I never would have met him.

990
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:01,545
- I can't wait to tell Josephine.
- Yeah, Josephine...

991
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,297
I can't wait to see her face.
Will she be surprised.

992
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:06,967
Neither can I. Let's run up
to the room and tell her right now.

993
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:09,719
- We don't have to run.
- Oh, yes, we do.

994
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:21,231
Josephine. Yoo-hoo. [chuckling]

996
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:25,610
I can't imagine where she'd be.

997
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:28,154
- I'll be back later.
- Oh, no. You wait.

I have a feeling
she'll show up any minute.

Yes. This is one for Ripley.

- Shopping. That's it.

It's a member of the herring family.

1206
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,322
A herring?

1207
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:10,369
Isn't it amazing how they get those
big fish into those little glass jars?

1208
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:12,496

1209

- I don't mind if I do.

1210
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:17,543
Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.

1212

- Uh... trophies.

1213
01:19:26,803 --> 01:19:30,306
You know. Skeet shooting,
dog breeding, water polo.

1214
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:32,308
Isn't water polo terribly dangerous?

1215
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:35,269
I'll say. I had two ponies
drowned under me.

1216

- Hm...

1217

Yes, of course.
Where could they have put it?

1218
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:42,485
You see, on Thursdays
I'm sort of lost around here.

1219
01:19:42,652 --> 01:19:45,362

- It's the crew's night off.

1220
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:49,325
- You mean we're alone on the boat?
- Completely.

1221
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:52,953
I've never been completely alone
with a man in the middle of the night,

1222
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,873
- in the middle of the ocean.
- Oh, it's perfectly safe.

1223
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:58,751
We're well-anchored.
The ship's in shipshape shape.

1224
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:01,879
The coastguard promised to call me
if there were any icebergs around.

1225

It's not the icebergs.

1226

But certain men would try to
take advantage of a situation like this.

It's just that I'm... um... harmless.

- I don't know how to put it,

but I've got this thing about girls.

1232
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:24,652
- What thing?
- They just sort of leave me cold.

1233

You mean, like, frigid?

1234

Well, it's more like a mental block.

1235
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:32,451
When I'm with a girl,
it does absolutely nothing to me.

1236
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:37,289
- Have you tried?
- Have I. I'm trying all the time.

- Complete washout.

- Oh, my dear, it's not your fault.

1240

Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.

- Not anymore.

1243
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:04,441
I was in love once,
but I'd rather not talk about it.

- What happened?

Well...

1247
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:15,744
It was my freshman year at Princeton.

1248
01:21:15,912 --> 01:21:18,205
There was this girl.
Her name was Nellie.

1249
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:21,041
Her father was
the vice president of Hupmobile.

1250
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:22,960
She wore glasses, too.

1251
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:26,297
That summer we were
at the Grand Canyon.

1252
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:29,300
We were on the highest ledge
watching the sunset,

1253
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:31,927
when suddenly we got
this impulse to kiss.

1254
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:35,472
I took off my glasses.
She took off her glasses.

1255
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,141
I took a step toward her.

1256
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:40,895
- She took a step toward me.
- Oh, no!

1257
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:45,274
Yes. Eight hours later
they brought her up by mule.

1258
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:49,486
I gave her three transfusions.
We had the same type blood - type O.

1259
01:21:49,654 --> 01:21:51,280
But it was too late.

1260
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,491
Talk about sad.

1261
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:56,660
Ever since then,

1262
01:21:56,828 --> 01:22:00,331
numb, no feelings, like my heart
was shot full of Novocain.

1263
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:02,833
You poor, poor boy.

Yes. All the money in the world,
and what good is it?

1265
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:07,838
Mint sauce or cranberries?

1266
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,675
How can you think about food
at a time like this?

1267
01:22:11,843 --> 01:22:13,844
What else is there for me?

1268
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:17,348
- Is it that hopeless?
- My family did everything they could.

1269
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:20,184
Hired the most beautiful
French upstairs maids.

1270
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:23,479
Got a special tutor to read me
books that were banned in Boston.

1271
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,898
Imported a troupe of Balinese dancers

1272
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:29,360
with those bells on their ankles
and long fingernails.

1273
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:31,528
What a waste of money.

1274
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:34,323
Have you ever tried American girls?

1275
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:35,699
Why?

1276
01:22:41,873 --> 01:22:43,582

1278

You should see a doctor - a good doctor.

1279
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:56,095
I have. I spent six months in Vienna
with Professor Freud, flat on my back.

1280
01:22:56,262 --> 01:23:00,975
Then there were the Mayo brothers,
injections, hypnosis, mineral baths.

1281
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:03,727
If I wasn't such a coward,
I'd kill myself.

1282
01:23:04,896 --> 01:23:07,064
Don't say that.

1283
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,817
There must be some girl
someplace that could...

1284
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:14,571
If I ever found a girl that could,
I'd marry her just like that.

1285
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,992
- Would you do me a favor?
- Certainly. What is it?

1286
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,912
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo brother
or one of those French upstairs girls,

1287
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,207

01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:41,495
- Jerry, there's another problem.
- Like what?

1358
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:45,582
- Like your honeymoon.
- We've been discussing that.

1359
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:49,920
He wants to go to the Riviera,
but I kinda lean towards Niagara Falls.

1360
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:56,718
Jerry, you're outta your mind.
How are you gonna get away with this?

1361
01:31:56,886 --> 01:32:00,764
I don't expect it to last. I'll tell him
the truth when the time comes.

1362
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:03,642
- Like when?
- Like right after the ceremony.

1363
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:07,229
Then we get a quick annulment,
he makes a nice settlement on me

1364
01:32:07,396 --> 01:32:10,607
and I keep gettin' those
alimony checks every month.

1365
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:16,947
Jerry... Jerry, listen to me.

1366
01:32:17,114 --> 01:32:20,492
There are laws, conventions.
It's just not been done.

1367
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:24,287
Shh! Joe, this may be my last chance
to marry a millionaire.

1368
01:32:24,455 --> 01:32:28,458
Jerry, will you take my advice?
Forget about the whole thing, will you?

1369
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:32,337
Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.
You're a boy.

1370
01:32:32,505 --> 01:32:35,632
- I'm a boy.
- That's the boy.

1371
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,468
Oh, I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a...

1372
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:43,223
[sighs] I wish I were dead.
I'm a boy. Boy, oh boy, am I a boy.

1373
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:45,684
What am I gonna do
about my engagement present?

1374
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:49,396
- What engagement present?
- Osgood gave me a bracelet.

1375
01:32:51,107 --> 01:32:52,691
Hey, these are real diamonds.

1376
01:32:52,858 --> 01:32:55,527
Of course they're real.
You think my fiancé is a bum?

1377
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:57,487
I guess I'll have
to give it back to him.

1378
01:32:57,655 --> 01:32:59,990
Wait a minute, Jerry.
Let's not be hasty.

1379
01:33:00,157 --> 01:33:02,659
After all, we don't wanna
hurt Osgood's feelings.

1380
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:05,495
- Huh?
- [knock on door]

1381
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:09,666
- [as Josephine] Just a minute.
- It's me. Sugar.

1382
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:17,841
Come in.

1383
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:22,220
I thought I heard voices.
I had to talk to somebody.

1384
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:23,930
I don't feel like going to sleep.

1385
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:27,851
- What you need is a slug of bourbon.
- Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.

1386
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:31,229
- Did you have a nice time?
- Nice?

1387
01:33:32,064 --> 01:33:35,025
It was suicidally beautiful.

1388
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:36,192
Did he get fresh?

1389
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:39,613
Of course not. As a matter of fact,
it was just the other way around.

1390
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:42,449
- You see, he needs help.
- What for?

1391
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:45,368
Talk about elegant.
You should see the yacht.

1392
01:33:45,536 --> 01:33:49,039
Candlelight, mint sauce and cranberries.

1393
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:51,416
Gee, I wish I'd been there.

1394
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:54,586
I'm going to see him again
tonight - and every night.

1395
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:56,212
I think he's going to propose.

1396
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:59,341
- As soon as he gets up his nerve.
- That's some nerve.

1397
01:33:59,508 --> 01:34:01,718
Daphne got a proposal tonight.

1398
01:34:02,428 --> 01:34:04,721
- Really?
- From a rich millionaire.

1399
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:06,514
That's wonderful.

1400
01:34:06,682 --> 01:34:08,933
- Poor Josephine.
- Me?

1401
01:34:09,101 --> 01:34:10,852
Well, Daphne has a beau,
I have a beau...

1402
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,521
If we could only find somebody for you.

1403
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,276
Here I am, doll.

1404
01:34:20,863 --> 01:34:22,530
Ohhhh...

1405
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,217
Hey!

1406
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:47,639
"Friends of Italian Opera" - that's us.

1407
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:49,933
Register over there.

1408
01:34:59,151 --> 01:35:02,696
Spats Colombo. Delegate from Chicago.
South Side Chapter.

1409
01:35:03,614 --> 01:35:05,031
Thanks.

1410
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:07,325
Hiya, Spats.

1411
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:10,578
- We was layin' 8-1 you wouldn't show.
- Why wouldn't I?

1412
01:35:10,746 --> 01:35:13,873
We thought you was all broken up
about Toothpick Charlie.

1413
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:18,294
- We all gotta go sometime.
- Yeah. You never know who's next.

1414
01:35:18,462 --> 01:35:20,797
OK, Spats.
Report to the sergeant at arms.

1415
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:24,634
- What for?
- Orders from Little Bonaparte.

1416
01:35:29,473 --> 01:35:32,225
- All right, Spats, get your hands up.
- What's the idea?

1417
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:34,769
Little Bonaparte don't want
no hardware around.

1418
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:37,147
All right, you're clean.

1419
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:39,941
You're not.

1420
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,953
It ain't loaded.

1421
01:36:00,463 --> 01:36:03,339
Next. What's in here?

1422
01:36:03,507 --> 01:36:07,469
My golf clubs.
Putter, niblick, No.3 iron.

1423
01:36:07,887 --> 01:36:10,346
- What's this?
- My mashie.

1424
01:36:15,352 --> 01:36:17,187
See you at the banquet, Spats.

1425
01:36:18,814 --> 01:36:21,316
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?

1426
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:23,902
Come on, boys.

1427
01:36:25,404 --> 01:36:27,655
Well. Spats Colombo, if I ever saw one.

1428
01:36:27,823 --> 01:36:30,033
Hello, copper.
What brings you to Florida?

1429
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:32,243
I heard you opera-lovers
were having a little rally.

1430
01:36:32,411 --> 01:36:35,371
Thought I'd better be around
in case anybody decided to sing.

1431
01:36:35,539 --> 01:36:36,706
Big joke.

1432
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:39,209
Where were you at 3pm
on St. Valentine's Day?

1433
01:36:39,376 --> 01:36:42,378
- Me? I was at Rigoletto.
- What's his first name and address?

1434
01:36:42,546 --> 01:36:44,547
- It's an opera, you ignoramus.
- Where'd they play it?

1435
01:36:44,715 --> 01:36:47,926
- In the garage on Clark Street?
- Clark Street? Never heard of it.

1436
01:36:48,093 --> 01:36:50,804
Ever hear of Deluxe Cleaners
on Wabash Avenue?

1437
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:51,888
Why?

1438
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:54,933
The day after the shoot
you sent in spats with blood on 'em.

1439
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,893
I cut myself while shaving.

1440
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:59,729
- You shave with spats on?
- I sleep with my spats on.

1441
01:36:59,897 --> 01:37:03,233
Stop kidding. You vulcanized
Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.

1442
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,692
You and who else?

1443
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:08,738
Me and those two witnesses your lawyers
have been lookin' for all over Chicago.

1444
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:11,741
Boys, know anything about
any garage or witnesses?

1445
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:14,536
Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.

1446
01:37:14,703 --> 01:37:16,579
Honest.

1447
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:22,752
Don't worry, Spats. One of these days
we're gonna dig up those two guys.

1448
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:25,421
That's what you'll have to do -
dig 'em up.

1449
01:37:34,974 --> 01:37:36,683
I feel like such a tramp,

1450
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,227
taking jewelry from a man
under false pretences.

1451
01:37:39,395 --> 01:37:43,189
Get it while you're young. Fix your lips
if you wanna look nice for Osgood.

1452
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:45,775
It'll break his heart when
he finds out I can't marry him.

1453
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:48,444
It'll break Sugar's heart when
she finds out I'm not a millionaire.

1454
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:51,614
That's life. Can't make an omelet
without breakin' an egg.

1455
01:37:51,782 --> 01:37:54,158
- What's with the omelet?
- Nag, nag, nag.

1456
01:37:54,326 --> 01:37:57,912
Look, we got a yacht, a bracelet,
you've got Osgood, I've got Sugar.

1457
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,622
We're really cookin'.

1458
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,587
- Joe!
- What?

1459
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:10,008
Something tells me the omelet
is about to hit the fan.

1460
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,387
- Come on, Daphne.
- Mm-hm!

1461
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:20,852
- Going up.
- [Spats] Hold it.

1462
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:30,486
Three, please.

1463
01:38:42,207 --> 01:38:43,583
I don't mean to be forward,

1464
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:46,711
but ain't I had the pleasure
of meetin' you two broads before?

1465
01:38:46,879 --> 01:38:50,048
- Oh, no.
- You must mean two other broads.

1466
01:38:50,215 --> 01:38:52,926
- You ever been in Chicago?
- Us?

1467
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:55,678
We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.

1468
01:38:55,846 --> 01:38:56,846
[operator] Third floor.

1469
01:38:57,014 --> 01:39:00,850
- What floor are you on, sweetie?
- Never you mind.

1470
01:39:01,602 --> 01:39:03,394
Room 413. We'll be in touch.

1471
01:39:03,562 --> 01:39:06,147
Don't call us. We'll call you.
[nervous chuckle]

1472
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:13,196
[groaning]

1473
01:39:18,994 --> 01:39:20,620
I tell you, Joe, they're onto us.

1474
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:24,040
They're gonna line us up against
the wall and... [imitates gunfire]

1475
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:27,460
The cops will find two dead dames
and take us to the ladies' morgue

1476
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:30,046
and when they undress us,
I'm gonna die of shame.

1477
01:39:30,214 --> 01:39:33,132
- Shut up and keep packing.
- Yeah. OK, Joe.

1478
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,385
- Not that, you idiot.
- They're from Osgood.

1479
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,303
He wanted me to wear 'em tonight.

1480
01:39:38,722 --> 01:39:40,765
[humming Hernando's Hideaway]

1481
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,560
I tell you, I will never find
another man who's so good to me.

1482
01:39:44,728 --> 01:39:47,146
Joe, if we get outta this hotel alive,
you know what we're gonna do?

1483
01:39:47,314 --> 01:39:49,232
We're gonna sell this bracelet,
take the money,

1484
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,443
grab a boat to South America
and hide out in a banana republic.

1485
01:39:52,611 --> 01:39:55,530
I figured if we eat nothing but bananas,
we could live there for 50 years.

1486
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:58,366
Maybe 100 years.
If we get outta the hotel alive.

1487
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:01,160
- Did we forget anything?
- Yeah. The shaving stuff.

1488
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:02,870
- Oh, yeah.
- And also Sugar.

1489
01:40:03,038 --> 01:40:03,997
Sugar?

1490
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:05,999
- Give me room 414.
- What are you doin'?

1491
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:08,543
- Making a telephone call.
- Who has time?

1492
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:11,212
We can't walk out on her
without saying goodbye.

1493
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:13,923
Since when? You usually walk out and
leave 'em with a kick in the teeth.

1494
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:17,510
That's when I was a saxophone player.
Now I'm a millionaire.

1495
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:20,763
Mail her a postcard.
Those gorillas may be here any minute.

1496
01:40:20,931 --> 01:40:24,225
[mimics female operator] Hello, room
414? This is the ship-to-shore operator.

1497
01:40:24,393 --> 01:40:25,435
Ship to shore?

1498
01:40:25,936 --> 01:40:28,438
Hey, Sugar, it's for you.
From the yacht.

1499
01:40:30,691 --> 01:40:31,691
Hello?

1500
01:40:33,527 --> 01:40:37,155
[as Junior] Hello, my dearest darling.
It's so good to hear your voice.

1501
01:40:37,322 --> 01:40:39,240
[whispers] I may throw up.

1502
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:43,453
No, I didn't sleep too well, darling.

1503
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:45,455
To tell the truth,
I never closed an eye.

1504
01:40:45,622 --> 01:40:49,208
I never slept better.
I had the most wonderful dream.

1505
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:51,794
I was still on the yacht
and the anchor broke loose.

1506
01:40:51,962 --> 01:40:54,422
We drifted for days and days.

1507
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:56,632
You were the captain and I was the crew.

1508
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:01,679
I kept a lookout for icebergs, I sorted
your shells and mixed your cocktails,

1509
01:41:01,847 --> 01:41:04,640
and I wiped the steam off your glasses.

1510
01:41:04,808 --> 01:41:08,811
And when I woke up, I wanted
to swim right back to you.

1511
01:41:09,396 --> 01:41:10,855
Yes...

1512
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:13,816
Now, about our date for tonight. Uh...

1513
01:41:13,984 --> 01:41:16,944
I'll meet you on the pier again
right after the show.

1514
01:41:17,821 --> 01:41:21,157
I'm afraid not. I can't make it tonight.

1515
01:41:22,826 --> 01:41:25,119
Not tomorrow either. I have to leave.

1516
01:41:25,287 --> 01:41:28,247
Something unexpected came up.
I'm sailing right away.

1517
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:30,750
Where to?

1518
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:33,377
South America?

1519
01:41:33,545 --> 01:41:34,796
Oh.

1520
01:41:34,963 --> 01:41:37,048
That is unexpected.

1521
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:40,843
You see, we have
these oil interests in Venezuela.

1522
01:41:41,011 --> 01:41:45,014
I just got a cable from Dad. The board
of directors have decided on a merger.

1523
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:48,184
A merger? How long will you be gone?

1524
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:52,188
Quite a while.

1525
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:54,482
As a matter of fact,
I'm not coming back at all.

1526
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:56,192
You're not?

1527
01:41:57,903 --> 01:42:01,197
Well, it's all rather complicated.
What we call high finance.

1528
01:42:01,365 --> 01:42:04,367
It just so happens the president
of the Venezuelan oil syndicate

1529
01:42:04,535 --> 01:42:06,160
has a daughter and, uh...

1530
01:42:06,328 --> 01:42:09,247
Oh. That kind of merger.

1531
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:10,665
What is she like?

1532
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:14,127
According to our tax adviser,
she's only so-so.

1533
01:42:14,294 --> 01:42:16,337
But that's the way the oil gushes.

1534
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:19,882
A man in my position has a certain
responsibility to the stockholders.

1535
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:23,177
You know, all those little people
who have invested their life savings.

1536
01:42:23,887 --> 01:42:27,890
Of course. I understand.
At least, I think I do.

1537
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:33,938
I knew you would. I only wish there
was something I could do for you.

1538
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:37,692
But you have. You've given me
all that inside information.

1539
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:39,569
Tomorrow I'm gonna call my broker

1540
01:42:39,736 --> 01:42:43,072
and have him buy me
50,000 shares of Venezuelan oil.

1541
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,074
Smart move.

1542
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:48,369
By the way, did you get my flowers?

1543
01:42:48,537 --> 01:42:50,913
You know, those orchids
from my greenhouse?

1544
01:42:51,081 --> 01:42:55,251
The fog finally lifted over Long Island
and they flew them down this morning.

1545
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:59,255
That's strange. I sent 'em to your room.

1546
01:43:00,924 --> 01:43:03,342
They should have been delivered by now.

1547
01:43:06,972 --> 01:43:09,932
Hey, Dolores, will you see
if there's any flowers outside?

1548
01:43:16,481 --> 01:43:19,233
Yes, they're here. White orchids.

1549
01:43:19,401 --> 01:43:22,486
I haven't had white orchids
since I was a debutante.

1550
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:26,449
What's this?

1551
01:43:27,492 --> 01:43:28,951
What's what?

1552
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:31,829
Oh, that.
Just a little going-away present.

1553
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:35,458
Real diamonds.

1554
01:43:35,626 --> 01:43:40,213
They must be worth their weight in gold.
Are you always this generous?

1555
01:43:41,506 --> 01:43:43,090
Not always.

1556
01:43:43,258 --> 01:43:46,260
I wanted you to know how grateful
I am for what you did for me.

1557
01:43:46,428 --> 01:43:49,722
I didn't do anything. It just happened.

1558
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:55,269
Oh! The navigator just came in.
We're ready to cast off.

1559
01:43:55,437 --> 01:43:58,648
Well, anchors aweigh,
and have a bon voyage.

1560
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:01,234
If you need an orchestra
to play at your wedding,

1561
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:03,444
we'll be through here
in a couple of weeks.

1562
01:44:03,612 --> 01:44:05,988
- Goodbye, my darling.
- [sighs]

1563
01:44:06,156 --> 01:44:09,492
I don't know about the captain but the
navigator's gettin' his tail outta here.

1564
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:12,328
- Yeah, let's shove off.
- Wait a minute. My bracelet.

1565
01:44:15,415 --> 01:44:17,124
What happened to my bracelet?

1566
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:19,168
Your bracelet? It's our bracelet.

1567
01:44:19,336 --> 01:44:21,128
All right.
What happened to our bracelet?

1568
01:44:21,296 --> 01:44:22,713
Don't worry.
We did the right thing with it.

1569
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:25,758
What did we do? You're not
pullin' one of your old tricks.

1570
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:28,219
No tricks, no mirrors,
nothing up my sleeve.

1571
01:44:28,387 --> 01:44:29,679
It's on the level this time.

1572
01:44:29,846 --> 01:44:31,138
- You...
- [door opens]

1573
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:39,188
[tearfully] Where's that bourbon?

1574
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:46,237
What's the matter, Sugar?

1575
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:49,991
I don't know.
All of a sudden I'm thirsty.

1576
01:44:51,034 --> 01:44:52,868
How did you get that bracelet?

1577
01:44:53,036 --> 01:44:54,870
- You like it?
- I always did.

1578
01:44:55,038 --> 01:44:59,875
Junior gave it to me. He's going
to South America to marry another girl.

1579
01:45:00,043 --> 01:45:02,878
- That's what you call high finance.
- That's what I call a louse.

1580
01:45:03,046 --> 01:45:06,882
If I were you, I'd take that bracelet
and throw it back in his face.

1581
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:08,718
- Daphne...
- He's the first nice guy

1582
01:45:08,885 --> 01:45:11,512
I've ever met in my life. The only one
that ever gave me anything.

1583
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,472
You'll forget him, Sugar.

1584
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:16,267
How can I?

1585
01:45:16,435 --> 01:45:20,313
No matter where I go, there'll always
be a Shell station on every corner.

1586
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,565
I'll bring this back when it's empty.

1587
01:45:25,736 --> 01:45:28,821
Are you crazy?
The place is crawlin' with mobsters.

1588
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:32,408
Gangrene is settin' in and
you're makin' like Diamond Jim Brady.

1589
01:45:32,576 --> 01:45:34,702
How are we gonna get outta here?
How are we gonna eat?

1590
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:36,245
We'll walk.
If we have to, we'll starve.

1591
01:45:36,413 --> 01:45:38,414
There you go with that "we" again.

1592
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:41,542
Not that way. We don't wanna
run into Spats and his chums.

1593
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:43,002
Oh.

1594
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:53,262
Your hands clean?

1595
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:54,555
Over.

1596
01:45:54,723 --> 01:45:56,432
OK, button my spats.

1597
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:01,937
You sure dress nice, boss.

1598
01:46:02,105 --> 01:46:05,358
Say, boss. I've been talking
with the other delegates.

1599
01:46:05,525 --> 01:46:07,818
The word is, Little Bonaparte
is real sore about

1600
01:46:07,986 --> 01:46:11,906
what happened to Toothpick Charlie.
Him and Charlie was choirboys together.

1601
01:46:12,074 --> 01:46:13,741
Stop or I'll bust out cryin'.

1602
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:17,453
He even got Charlie's last toothpick
from the garage. Had it gold-plated.

1603
01:46:17,621 --> 01:46:19,372
Like I was tellin' you fellas.

1604
01:46:19,539 --> 01:46:22,875
Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft.
Hasn't got it here anymore.

1605
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:25,461
Used to be like a rock.

1606
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:29,256
It's too bad.
I think it's time he retired.

1607
01:46:29,424 --> 01:46:30,466
Second the motion.

1608
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:32,468
How are we gonna retire him?

1609
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:34,303
Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.

1610
01:46:34,471 --> 01:46:36,555
One of these days, Little Bonaparte
and Toothpick Charlie

1611
01:46:36,723 --> 01:46:39,016
will be singin' in the same choir again.

1612
01:46:39,559 --> 01:46:41,185
[thud]

1613
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:45,272
[Spats] But this time we'll make sure
there are no witnesses.

1614
01:46:48,193 --> 01:46:51,445
Look. The two broads from the elevator.

1615
01:46:54,658 --> 01:46:57,076
Hey. Join us.

1616
01:46:57,911 --> 01:47:00,538
What's the matter with those dames?

1617
01:47:00,705 --> 01:47:02,665
[Spats] Maybe those dames ain't dames.

1618
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:07,962
Same faces, same instruments.

1619
01:47:12,175 --> 01:47:15,344
- Here's your Valentine's card.
- The two musicians from the garage.

1620
01:47:15,512 --> 01:47:20,599
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago,
so we'll finish the job here. Come on.

1621
01:47:39,202 --> 01:47:41,036
All right, so what do we do now?

1622
01:47:41,204 --> 01:47:43,497
First thing we gotta do
is get out of these clothes.

1623
01:47:52,591 --> 01:47:53,924
Yoo-hoo!

1624
01:49:22,847 --> 01:49:23,764
What happened?

1625
01:49:23,932 --> 01:49:27,309
Me and Tiny had them cornered,
but we lost them in the shuffle.

1626
01:49:27,477 --> 01:49:30,688
- Where were you guys?
- We was with you, at Rigoletto's.

1627
01:49:30,855 --> 01:49:32,106
Why, you stupid idiot.

1628
01:49:32,274 --> 01:49:34,608
That's all right, boss,
we'll get 'em after the banquet.

1629
01:49:34,776 --> 01:49:36,860
They can't be too far away.

1630
01:49:38,363 --> 01:49:40,364
[burst of applause]

1631
01:49:56,381 --> 01:49:58,382
- Thank you.
- [applause dies out]

1632
01:49:58,550 --> 01:50:00,926
Thank you, fellow opera-lovers.

1633
01:50:02,137 --> 01:50:06,098
It's been ten years since I elected
myself president of this organization,

1634
01:50:06,266 --> 01:50:09,268
and, if I say so myself,
you made the right choice.

1635
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:11,478
[clapping]

1636
01:50:12,188 --> 01:50:15,566
Let's look at the record.
In the last fiscal year,

1637
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:20,029
we made $112 million before taxes.

1638
01:50:20,196 --> 01:50:21,822
Only we ain't payin' no taxes.

1639
01:50:24,492 --> 01:50:28,704
Of course, like in every business,
we had our little misunderstandings.

1640
01:50:30,665 --> 01:50:32,666
Let us now rise and
observe one minute of silence

1641
01:50:32,834 --> 01:50:37,379
in memory of seven of our members
from Chicago, North Side Chapter,

1642
01:50:37,547 --> 01:50:41,133
who are unable to be with us tonight
on account of bein' rubbed out.

1643
01:50:46,848 --> 01:50:48,390
You too, Spats.

1644
01:50:48,558 --> 01:50:49,850
Up.

1645
01:51:00,445 --> 01:51:01,904
Easy, now.

1646
01:51:02,072 --> 01:51:05,532
- You know when you come out?
- Yeah. Second time they sing:

1647
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:09,995
<i>♪ For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
<i>which nobody can deny</i>

1648
01:51:10,163 --> 01:51:11,622
OK.

1649
01:51:16,127 --> 01:51:20,339
And don't mess up the cake. I promised
to bring back a piece to my kids.

1650
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:30,599
Now, fellow delegates,

1651
01:51:30,767 --> 01:51:34,353
there comes a time in the life
of every business executive

1652
01:51:34,521 --> 01:51:37,564
when he starts thinkin'
about retirement.

1653

I've been considerin'
several candidates.

1656
01:51:48,451 --> 01:51:52,162
For instance, there's
a certain party from Chicago,

1657
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:54,206
South Side Chapter.

a little too big for his spats.

Of course,
he's still got a lot to learn.

The big noise he made
on St. Valentine's Day,

You mean you let 'em get away twice?

that's real sloppy.
