1
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:06,546
BRIDGET: It all began
on New Year's Day...

2
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,845
in my thirty-second year
of being single.

3
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,518
Once again,
I found myself on my own...

4
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:17,785
and going to my mother's
annual turkey curry buffet.

5
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,393
Every year,
she tries to fix me up...

6
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:21,759
with some bushy-haired,
middle-aged bore...

7
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:25,026
and I feared this year
would be no exception.

8
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:26,896
There you are, dumpling.

9
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:28,560
BRIDGET: My mum...

10
00:01:28,602 --> 00:01:30,001
a strange creature
from the time...

11
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:31,367
when pickles on toothpicks...

12
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:32,895
were still the height
of sophistication.

13
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,566
Doilies, Pam?
Hello, Bridget.

14
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:36,735
Third drawer from the top, Una.

15
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:38,745
Under the mini gherkins.

16
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:42,977
By the way, the Darcys are here.
They brought Mark with them.

17
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:44,574
BRIDGET: Ah, here we go.

18
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:46,017
You remember Mark.

19
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:47,713
You used to play
in his paddling pool.

20
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:49,589
He's a barrister.
Very well off.

21
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:51,648
No, I don't remember.

22
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,591
He's divorced, apparently.

23
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:56,095
His wife was Japanese.
Very cruel race.

24
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:57,790
Now, what are you
going to put on?

25
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:58,957
This.

26
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:00,899
MUM: Oh, don’t be silly,
Bridget.

27
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:02,060
You'll never get a boyfriend...

28
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:04,070
if you look like you've
wandered out of Auschwitz.

29
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:05,093
Now, run upstairs.

30
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,107
I've laid out something
lovely on your bed.

31
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:10,201
Tsk. [Sighs]

32

ANDY WILLIAMS SINGING:
You're just too good to be true

33
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:16,614
Can’t take my eyes off of you

34
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,019
BRIDGET: Great.
I was wearing a carpet.

35
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:22,885
UNCLE GEOFFREY: There she is.

36
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:26,882
[Singing]
My little Bridget

37
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:29,418
Hi, Uncle Geoffrey. Ha ha.

38
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:30,760
- Hmm. Had a drink?
- No.

39
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:32,059
No? Come on, then.

40
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:33,793
BRIDGET:
Actually, not my uncle.

41
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,597
Someone who insists
I call him uncle...

42
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:36,966
while he gropes my ass...

43
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:40,097
and asks me the question
dreaded by all Singletons.

44
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,166
UNCLE GEOFFREY:
So... how's your love life?

45
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,440
Super. Thanks, Uncle G.

46
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,481
Still no fellow, then, eh?
I don't know.

47
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:49,972
You career girls.
Can't put it off forever.

48
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:51,916
UNA: Tick-tock, tick-tock.

49
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:54,477
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, darling.

50
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:56,079
How's it going?

51
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:57,714
Torture.

52
00:02:57,757 --> 00:03:00,658
DAD: Your mother’s trying to
fix you up with some divorcee.

53
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:02,093
Uhh.

54
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:05,188
Human-rights barrister. Pretty nasty beast, apparently.

55
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:08,668
BRIDGET: Hoo. Ding-dong.

56
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:11,535
Maybe this time
Mum had got it right.

57
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:14,904
Come on. Why don’t we see
if Mark fancies a gherkin?

58
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,932
[Whispering] Good luck.

59
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,500
Mark?

60
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:21,241
BRIDGET: Maybe this was
the mysterious Mr. Right...

61
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:24,079
l’d been waiting
my whole life to meet.

62
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:27,177
You remember Bridget.

63
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,983
BRIDGET: Maybe not.

64
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:30,785
She's used to
run around your lawn...

65
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:32,985
with no clothes on, remember?

66
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:35,085
Uh, no, not as such.

67
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:37,990
Come and look
at your gravy, Pam.

68
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:39,896
I think it's going
to need sieving.

69
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,127
Of course it doesn't
need sieving.

70
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,930
Just stir it, Una.

71
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:46,171
Yes, of course.
I'll be right there.

72
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:49,175
Sorry. Lumpy gravy calls.

73
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,677
ANDY WILLIAMS SINGING:

00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:56,148
- So... ha.
- So.

76
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:59,310
You staying at your parents'
for New Year?

77
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,884
- Yes.
- Mmm.

78
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:02,320
- You?
- Oh, no, no, no.

79
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:04,513
I was in London
at a party last night...

80
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:06,856
so I'm afraid
I'm a bit hung over.

81
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:08,827
Wish I could be lying
with my head in the toilet...

82
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,329
Like all normal people.

83

[Chuckles, sighs]

84
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:15,028
New Year's resolution...
drink less.

85
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:18,037
Oh, and quit smoking.
Mmm. Ha.

86
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:20,733
- Oh.
- Oh. Ha.

87
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:23,174
And keep New Year's resolutions.

88
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:27,914
Oh. And, uh...

89
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:30,883
stop talking total nonsense
to strangers.

90
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,219
In fact, stop talking,
full stop.

91
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:36,814
Yes, well,
perhaps it's time to eat.

92
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:37,788
Mmm.

ANDY WILLIAMS SINGING:
I need you, baby

94
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:40,625
MRS. DARCY: Apparently...

95
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:42,721
she lives just 'roundthe corner from you.

96
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:45,322
Mother, I do not need
a blind date.

97
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:47,993
Particularly not with some
verbally incontinent spinster...

98
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:49,797
who smokes like a chimney,
drinks like a fish...

99
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:51,895
and dresses like her mother.

100
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:56,269
Yummy.

101
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,174
Turkey curry.

102
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:00,076
My favourite.

103
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:02,946
BRIDGET: And that was it.
Right there.

104
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,918
Right there.
That was the moment.

105
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:11,318
I suddenly realized that unless
some thing changed soon...

106
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:14,020
I was going to live a life
where my major relationship...

107
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,925
was with a bottle of wine...

108
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:19,125
and I'd finally die
fat and alone...

109
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:22,965
and be found three weeks later,
half-eaten by wild dogs.

110
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:25,631
Or I was about to
turn into Glenn Close...

00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:27,105
in "Fatal Attraction."

When I was young

00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:20,157
I never needed anyone

00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:26,457

was just for fun

a major decision.

131
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:23,487
I had to make sure
That next year...

132
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:26,788
I wouldn't end up shit-faced
and listening to sad FM...

133
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:29,260
easy-listening
for the over-thirties.

134
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:32,230
I decided to take
control of my life...

135
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:33,755
and start a diary...

136
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,462
to tell the truth
about Bridget Jones...

137

the whole truth.

Resolution number one...
ohh...

139
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:43,243
obviously will lose
twenty pounds.

Number two...

141
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:46,737
always put last night's panties
in the laundry basket.

Equally important...

143
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:50,809
will find nice sensible
boyfriend to go out with...

144
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,875
and not continue to form
romantic attachments...

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,409
to any of the following...

146

alcoholics, workaholics,
commitment-phobics...

147

emotional fuckwits,
or perverts.

149

will not fantasize...

is your work, Salman?

488
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,715
RUSHDIE: You know,
it's an amazing thing...

489
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:54,685
nobody's ever asked me
that question.

490
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,278
Excuse me.

491
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:58,983
Jones. Sod 'em all.

492
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:01,356
DANIEL: It was a brilliant...

493
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:06,763
post-modernist masterpiece of
oratorical fireworks, really.

494
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,959
Uhh.

495
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,763
You're looking very sexy, Jones.

496
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:11,770
I think I'm gonna have to
take you out to dinner now...

497
00:23:11,804 --> 00:23:13,965
whether you like it or not, OK?

498
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:15,166
Come on, get your stuff.

499
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:22,446
[Sighs]

500
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:25,043
So how do you feel about
this whole situation...

501
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:26,915
in Chechnya?
Isn’t it a nightmare?

502
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:28,351
I couldn't give a fuck, Jones.

503
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:32,255
Now, look, how do you
know Arsey Darcy?

504
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,226
Apparently, I used
to run 'round naked...

505
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,727
in his paddling pool.

506
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:38,992
I bet you did, you dirty bitch.

507
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:41,124
What about you?

508
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,793
Same. Yeah.

509
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:47,468
No, no, I was best man
at his wedding.

510
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,201
Um, knew him from Cambridge.

511
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:50,469
He was a mate.

512
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:52,477
And then what?

513
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:55,908
And then, uh... nothing.

514
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:58,473
You don't need to protect him.
He's no friend of mine.

515
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:01,042
Well, um, then...

516
00:24:01,086 --> 00:24:03,247
many years later...

517
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:06,815
I made the somewhat
catastrophic mistake...

518
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:11,228
of introducing him
to my fiancée.

519
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,127
And, um...

520
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:22,773
I couldn't say, in all honesty,
I've ever quite forgiven him.

521
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:25,208
God, so...

522
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:28,236
he's a nasty bastard.

523
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,043
And a dull bastard.

524
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:32,277
Yes. Yes,
I think that's fair.

525
00:24:32,317 --> 00:24:35,254
Anyway, fuck him. Listen,
don't let him ruin our evening.

526
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:36,983
Why don't you have
some more wine...

527
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:38,922
and tell me more about
practicing French-kissing...

528
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:40,083
with the other girls
at school...

529
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,217
because that's
a very good story.

530
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,956
- It wasn't French-kissing.
- Don't care. Make it up.

531
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:45,931
That's an order, Jones.

532
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:48,559
DANIEL: So, um, how about
a drink at my place?

533
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:51,065
Totally innocent,
no funny business...

534
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:53,071
just full sex.

535
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,800
No, no, no.

536
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:57,934
I should get a taxi.

537
00:24:57,976 --> 00:25:01,139
But thank you
for the lovely dinner.

538
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:06,376
It's a pleasure, Jones.

539
00:25:10,522 --> 00:25:13,423
ROSEYSINGING: Oh, love

540
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,449
Love, love

541
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:17,462
Oh

542
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:22,862
Ooh

543
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:24,892
You're alone

544
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:26,962
All the time

545
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:30,270
Does it ever puzzle you

546
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:34,006
Have you asked why you seem

547
00:25:36,415 --> 00:25:38,542
And out again

548
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:42,384
Do you really ever love

549
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:44,082
Or just pretend

550
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:45,589
Oh, baby

551
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:48,593
Why fool yourself?

552
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:52,290
Don't be afraid
to help yourself

553
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:55,300
DANIEL: Now these are very
silly little boots, Jones.

554
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:58,895
And this is a very
silly little dress.

555
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:00,564
And, um...

556
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:03,175
these are, uh...

557
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:06,008
fuck me,
absolutely enormous panties.

558
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:07,636
Jesus. Fuck.

559
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:09,837
No, no, don't apologize.
I like them.

560
00:26:09,882 --> 00:26:12,442
Hello, Mummy.

561
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:15,647
ROSEYSINGING: Love

562
00:26:15,854 --> 00:26:17,185
I'm sorry, I have to have
another look.

563
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:19,019
- They're too good to be true.
- No.

564
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:20,192
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

565
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:21,557
I'm wearing something
quite similar myself.

566
00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:25,188
- Here, I'll show you.
- No. No.

567
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,663
ROSEYSINGING:
This time decide

568
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:30,301
That you will open up

569
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:32,871
Let it in

570
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:35,669
There's no shame
in sharin' love

571
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:39,435
You feel within

572
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:42,174
So jump right in

573
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:44,944
Head over heels

574
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:47,008
And fall right in

575
00:26:47,085 --> 00:26:48,313
Ha. Huh.

576
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:49,581
That was fantastic.

577
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:51,612
Ohh. Mmm.

578
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:53,225
Ay, ay.

579
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:55,022
BRIDGET: Ohh. Daniel.

580
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,186
Yeah?

581
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:58,696
What happens at the office?

582
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:00,694
Oh. Well,
I'm glad you asked that.

583
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:03,527
You see,
it's a publishing house.

584
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:05,570
So that means that people
write things for us...

585
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,197
and then we print out
all the pages...

586
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,466
and fasten them together...

587
00:27:08,507 --> 00:27:10,407
and make them into what
we call a book, Jones.

588
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:14,936
No, do you think
people will notice?

589
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,174
Notice what?

590
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:19,342
Us. Working together,
sleeping together.

591
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:20,544
Hang on a minute, Jones.

592
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:23,918
Just slow down.
It started on Tuesday...

593
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:25,514
and now it's Thursday.

594
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:27,548
It's not exactly...

595
00:27:27,592 --> 00:27:30,390
um, a long-term relationship,
is it?

596
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:34,024
You're very bad.

597

00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:40,530
Ohh.

601
00:27:41,673 --> 00:27:44,233
Mmm.

602
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:46,244
Bridget Jones,
wanton sex goddess...

603
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:50,112
with a very bad man
between her thighs.

604
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:52,378
Mum. Hi.

605
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,510
BRIDGET: It's the truth
universally acknowledged...

606
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:58,216
that the moment one area
of your life starts going OK...

607
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:02,317
another part of it falls
spectacularly to pieces.

608
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:04,488
PAMELA: Ah, anyone else want
to have it off?

609
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,394
Haha. Don't be shy, madame.

610
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:13,337
French. Have it oeuf. Ha ha!
With the wisecrack egg peeler.

611
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:16,273
Now, nice firm grip.

612
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:20,409
Put it in the hole. And...

613
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:22,970
up, down, up, down.

614
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:25,006
And off it comes in your hand.

615
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:30,755
Oh! Mind the over-spray.
Sorry.

616
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:34,357
Darling, if I came in
with my knickers on my head...

617
00:28:34,393 --> 00:28:35,792
he wouldn't notice.

618
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:38,326
I spent thirty-five years
cleaning his house...

619
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:40,593
washing his clothes,
bringing up his children.

620
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:42,793
I'm your child, too.

621
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:44,298
To be honest, darling,
having children...

622
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:46,133
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

623
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,639
Given my chance again,
I'm not sure I'd have any.

624
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:51,039
MUM: And now it's
the winter of my life...

625
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:53,340
and I haven't actually
got anything of my own.

626
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:57,075
I've got no power,
no real career...

627
00:28:57,115 --> 00:28:59,379
no... no sex life.

628
00:28:59,418 --> 00:29:01,215
I've got no life at all.

629
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:03,278
I'm like the grasshopper
who sang all summer.

630
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:05,050
I'm like Germaine sodding Geer.

631
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,523
Greer.

632
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,187
Well, anyway, I'm not having it.
And I've been talent spotted.

633
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:13,026
Julian thinks
I've got great potential.

634
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:14,327
Who's Julian?

635
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:16,266
From the Home Shopping Channel.

636
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:18,326
Comes into the store
to have his colours done.

637
00:29:18,403 --> 00:29:20,132
Potential for what?

638
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:22,572
As a demonstrator
on his cable show.

639
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:24,268
You know, his assistant.

640
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:26,607
Apparently, it's the highest-
Rated show on the channel.

641
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,044
Well, apart from the one...

642
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,215
where the fat people
beat up their relatives.

643
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:31,739
Ooh! I must wiz.

644
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:35,116
- Have you heard from Mark Darcy?
- Good-bye, Mum.

it got lots worse.

651
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:02,704
Hello!

652
00:30:02,747 --> 00:30:04,180
Look at this.

JULIAN: Paying off
this heart-shaped pendant.

654
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:09,486
One of my own personal
recommendations...

655
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:12,388
is this absolutely stunning...

656
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:14,824
matching necklace
and earring set.

657
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:20,526
JULIAN: The earrings measuring
Just over a centimetre...

658
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:24,729
in genuine diamante with
two pairs in lapis lazuli...

659
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:27,738
in a lovely mock-gold finish.

660
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:30,741
JULIAN: The exact replica
of those worn at Wimbledon...

661
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:34,905
in 1993 by Her Royal Highness
the Duchess of Kent.

Well.

664
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:41,544
Has she actually moved out then?

665
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,454
Apparently, she and this
tangerine-tinted buffoon...

666
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,684
are suddenly an item.

667
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:49,751

around to bloody dinner.

00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,193
to Una Alconbury's
Tarts and Vicars party.

670
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:56,700
That's not the Pamela I knew.
That's cruel.

671
00:30:56,735 --> 00:31:01,502
BRIDGET: Well, still,
could be a golden opportunity.

672
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,636
If you spent the entire party
flirting with other women...

673
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:07,645
it would drive Mum
wild with jealousy.

DAD: What?

675
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:10,644
BRIDGET:
That's how I got my man.

676
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:14,140
Have you got a boyfriend?
A real one?

677
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:17,622
I have, Father. I have.

678
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:20,624
And he's perfect.

Am no longer tragic spinster...

00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:46,806

of bonafide sex god...

683
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:48,944
so committed
that he's taking me...

684
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:52,718
on a full-blown mini-break
holiday weekend.

DANIEL: Just promise me
we don't have to sit...

in any little boats and read
poncey poetry to each other.

This can't be just shagging.

690
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:05,730
A mini-breakmeans true love.

691

Though perhaps ever so slightly
less elegant under pressure.

It's very quiet here, isn't it?
Are we the only guests, or...

695
00:32:26,691 --> 00:32:28,591
We have a wedding this weekend.

Hmm. Well, the weakness
of their case...

710
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:20,412
lies in the deposition
they made on August30.

if you've changed your mind,
you could just say so...

because, honestly, I don't see
what could be so important.

would you?

00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:22,809
Didn't you telephone
Colin and Bridget?

811
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:24,719
How's my little Bridget?

812
00:37:24,756 --> 00:37:25,882
GEOFFREY: Bop, bop.

813
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:27,289
Oh.

814
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:28,622
Geoffrey.

815
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,651
So, where's this chap
of yours, then, eh?

816
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:32,253
Ah, yes, well,
he had to work, so...

817
00:37:32,297 --> 00:37:34,288
Ha! A likely tale.

818
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:36,124
Off they run. Whee!

JULIELONDONSINGING:
You are all I long for

821
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:43,002
Bizarre what some men
find attractive.

822
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,134
Oh, God.

823
00:37:45,176 --> 00:37:47,667
MUM: Darling!
Geoffrey!

824
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:49,270
What on earth are you wearing?

825
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:51,282
You look like
a common prostitute.

826
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:53,147
Yes, well, that was,
actually, the point.

827
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:54,344
Say hi to Julian.

828
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:56,577
Hello, Julian.

829
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:57,815
My dear...

830
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:59,914
you and your mother
could be sisters.

831
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:03,284
JULIAN:
And what a lovely bracelet.

832
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:05,057
It's what I call
an all-arounder...

833
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:08,065
the sort of thing one can wear
with anything to any occasion.

834
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:09,828
Oh.

835
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:11,698
Have you spoken to my dad?

836
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:14,330
Yes. He's behaving
most bizarrely.

837
00:38:14,372 --> 00:38:15,896
I think he was actually
trying to flirt...

838
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,340
with Penny Husbands-Bosworth,
poor thing.

839
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:19,809
She was very frightened.

840
00:38:19,844 --> 00:38:21,709
She's only just had
her ovaries done.

841
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:28,183
I don't know what
you ever saw in him.

842
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:30,278
Shh. Bad man.
[Both laugh]

Heh heh.

846
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:41,822
Didn't tell you, either.

847
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:44,733
[Laughs]

848
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:46,999
No. I didn't spend as much
as Bernard, thank God.

849
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:53,069
BRIDGET: Oh.

850
00:38:54,278 --> 00:38:55,711
I'm sorry, Dad.

851
00:38:55,747 --> 00:38:57,840
The way she looked at me.

852
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,918
Well, she loves you, really.

853
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:03,079
You love each other.

854
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:04,418
This is only a temporary glitch.

855
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:06,290
Is it?

856
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,622
I don't know.

857
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,651
DAD: I don't know.

858
00:39:13,965 --> 00:39:15,933
UNA: Ah, Bridget, there you are.

859
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:17,229
Don't worry.
You're not the only one.

860
00:39:17,268 --> 00:39:19,862
This is Penny. Geoffrey didn't
get in touch with her, either.

861
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:21,098
I'm sorry?

862
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:22,970
I was just saying Geoffrey
didn't contact you, either...

863
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:24,406
to tell you that
the Tarts and Vicars concept...

864
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:25,870
had gone out of the window.

865
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,810
Oh, yes, he did.

866
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:29,039
Oh, right.

867
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,775
Lovely dress.

868
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:32,339
Very exotic.

869
00:39:35,953 --> 00:39:37,784
What a shame you couldn't
bring your boyfriend, Bridget.

870
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:39,153
What's his name?
David? Darren?

871
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,680
MARK: Daniel Cleaver.

872
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:42,454
Oh. Is he a friend
of yours, Mark?

873
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,888
Absolutely not.

874
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:46,294
I hope he's good enough
for our little Bridget.

875
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,356
I think I can say with
total confidence absolutely not.

876
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,300
Well, I'm sure he'd say
the same about you...

877
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:53,030
given your past behaviour.

878
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:54,436
Sorry?

879
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:56,064
I think you know what I mean.

BRIDGET: Hmm.
Looks like Auntie Shirley...

882
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:16,155
didn't get the message, either.

I really, really wanted
to see a friendly face.

Oh, now, listen,
I'll tell you what.

887
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:34,712
I have an idea.
Let me finish this...

888
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:36,236
while you go home,
have a long hot bath...

889
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,875
and I'll call round,
and we'll have dinner later, OK?

Is there someone here?

Not that I'm aware of.

893
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:48,758
Unless that Bosnian family
has moved in again.

Listen, I am feeling
really bad, actually.

- I should've been there today.
- No, I'm sorry.

No, no, I'm sorry...

but at least I got
a hell of a lot of work done.

that in the end...

it's got to be
something extraordinary...

BRIDGET: No.

on very special occasions.

Hey, Bridge,
how's your love life?

that ends in divorce now
or one in three?

One in three.

1164
00:53:58,815 --> 00:54:00,783
there are so many unmarried
women in their thirties...

1165
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:01,943

your Lewis hamfire report,
by the way.

Look, are you and Cosmo
in this together?

1182

I mean, you seem
to go out of your way...

to try to make me feel
like a complete idiot...

every time I see you,
and you really needn't bother.

you're an idiot at all.

I mean, there are elements
of the ridiculous about you.

pretty interesting.

an appallingly bad
public speaker.

that I was unforgivably rude

that my mother had
given me the day before.

not to give any interviews.

Someone exactly like you

Someone exactly like you

ROBBIE WILLIAMS SINGING:
Have you met Miss Jones?

1943
01:32:24,018 --> 01:32:27,579
Someone said as we shook hands

1944
01:32:27,622 --> 01:32:31,490
She was just Miss Jones

1945
01:32:31,526 --> 01:32:34,256
To me

1946
01:32:36,064 --> 01:32:39,056
And now I've met Miss Jones

1947
01:32:40,335 --> 01:32:43,065
And we'll keep on meeting

1948

Whoa, fellas

1951
01:33:21,142 --> 01:33:23,269
And all at once

1952
01:33:23,344 --> 01:33:25,175
I lost my breath

1953
01:33:25,213 --> 01:33:27,238
And all at once

1954
01:33:27,282 --> 01:33:29,250
Was scared to death

1955
01:33:29,284 --> 01:33:31,047
And all at once

1956
01:33:31,085 --> 01:33:34,179
I owned the earth

1957
01:33:34,222 --> 01:33:36,383
And sky

1958
01:33:38,493 --> 01:33:42,554

SHELBY LYNNE SINGING: I didn't
mean to hurt your feelings

1966
01:34:13,428 --> 01:34:15,658
It was so careless of me

1967
01:34:17,632 --> 01:34:20,965
I guess I've gone and done it

1968
01:34:21,002 --> 01:34:23,232
It's just a matter of time

1969

Nothing I can do

1970

But tell you l’m sorry

of all

'Cause your love's

Yeah

1975
01:34:53,701 --> 01:34:56,261
I'd rather walk on glass

1976
01:34:56,304 --> 01:35:01,469
Than see teardrops in your eyes

1977
01:35:01,509 --> 01:35:03,773
And l’d fall to pieces

1978
01:35:03,978 --> 01:35:05,673
Just to hold you

1979
01:35:05,713 --> 01:35:08,341
The best thing in my life

And it's just luck
I get to love you

that's right

1988

Lay down and die now

You've done it to me

You're puttin' me under

I love you and all is pleasures

Baby, feels so right

1995
01:36:04,372 --> 01:36:09,332
My arms won't be
of any use at all

1996

to change her name

Then we'll know
they'll be the same

She's not of this earth
