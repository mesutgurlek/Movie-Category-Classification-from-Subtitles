 1 
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,264
Master Li is here!

 2 
00:01:24,392 --> 00:01:25,882
Shu Lien!

 3 
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,794
Li Mu Bai is here!

 4 
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:43,235
- How's everything?
- Fine. Please come in.

 5 
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,223
Mu Bai...
It's been too long.

 6 
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:58,518
It has.

 7 
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,124
- How's business?
- Good.

 8 
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,126
- And how are you?
- Fine.

 9 
00:02:08,136 --> 00:02:10,263
Monk Zheng said
you were at Wudan Mountain.

 10 
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:13,236
He said you were practicing
deep meditation.

 11 
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:16,543
The mountain
must be so peaceful...

 12 
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,774
I envy you.

 13 
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:22,677
My work keeps me so busy,
I hardly get any rest.

 14 
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:27,119
I left the training early.

 15 
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:33,050
Why? You're a Wudan fighter.
Training is everything.

 16 
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,894
During my meditation training...

 17 
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:38,794
I came to a place
of deep silence...

 18 
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:42,233
I was surrounded by light...

 19 
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:46,468
Time and space disappeared.

 20 
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:51,274
I had come to a place my master
had never told me about.

 21 
00:02:53,648 --> 00:02:55,309
You were enlightened?

 22 
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:57,007
No.

 23 
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,650
I didn't feel the bliss
of enlightement.

 24 
00:03:00,822 --> 00:03:06,317
Instead... I was surrounded
by an endless sorrow.

 25 
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,288
I couldn't bear it.

 26 
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:11,794
I broke off my meditation.

 27 
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:13,797
I couldn't go on.

 28 
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,232
There was something...
pulling me back.

 29 
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:20,765
What was it ?

 30 
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:26,437
Something I can't let go of.

 31 
00:03:30,718 --> 00:03:31,776
You're leaving soon?

 32 
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,219
We're preparing a convoy
for a delivery...

 33 
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,584
to Peking.

 34 
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:39,287
Perhaps I could ask you...

 35 
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:43,087
to deliver something
to Sir Te for me.

 36 
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,529
The Green Destiny sword?
You're giving it to Sir Te?

 37 
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:54,141
I am. He has always been
our greatest protector.

 38 
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:57,243
I don't understand.
How can you part with it?

 39 
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:59,971
It has always been with you.

 40 
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:04,440
Too many men have died
at its edge.

 41 
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:11,623
It only looks pure because blood
washes so easily from its blade.

 42 
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:16,490
You use it justly,
you're worthy of it.

 43 
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:21,902
It's time for me
to leave it behind.

 44 
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,970
So what will you do now?

 45 
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,005
Come with me to Peking.

 46 
00:04:30,178 --> 00:04:33,170
You can give the sword to Sir Te
yourself.

 47 
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:35,941
It'll be just like old times.

 48 
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:41,349
First I must visit
my master's grave.

 49 
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:43,848
It's been many years since...

 50 
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:47,591
Jade Fox murdered him.
I have yet to avenge his death.

 51 
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:50,788
And yet I'm thinking of quitting.

 52 
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:53,798
I must pray for his forgiveness.

 53 
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:58,496
Join me
once you have finished.

 54 
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,005
I can wait for you in Peking.

 55 
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:03,633
Perhaps.

 56 
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:11,943
Okay. Pass.

 57 
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,684
Thanks.

 58 
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,789
Let's go into the city.

 59 
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:29,696
Everything got here safely.
I'm much obliged.

 60 
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,897
Just doing my job.

 61 
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:37,477
Sun Security has been the best
since your father started it.

 62 
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:41,843
You're a credit to his memory.

 63 
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:43,074
Thank you.

 64 
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:45,310
I mean it.

 65 
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,948
This is Li Mu Bai's
personal sword,

 66 
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:26,526
a great hero's weapon.

 67 
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:33,031
He is the only one in the world
worthy of carrying it.

 68 
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,397
It's too fine a gift.
I cannot accept it.

 69 
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,696
Sir Te...

 70 
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:40,136
It has brought him
as much trouble as glory.

 71 
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,107
Help him to leave
these troubles behind.

 72 
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,041
Otherwise, he'll never be able
to start a new.

 73 
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:48,309
All right.

 74 
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:50,279
I'll act as the sword's custodian.

 75 
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,248
Governor Yu has arrived.

 76 
00:06:55,423 --> 00:06:56,617
I must change.

 77 
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,287
You've always been so good
to Li Mu Bai and me.

 78 
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,429
Please accept our thanks.

 79 
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:07,158
Please do not be such a stranger.
You'll stay the night as my guest.

 80 
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:11,164
Now, Shu Lien...

 81 
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:13,405
tell me something.

 82 
00:07:13,574 --> 00:07:16,099
And forgive me for prying.

 83 
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:19,007
Your father
was a great friend to me,

 84 
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,411
and I think of you
as my own daughter.

 85 
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,642
Please, Sir Te, what is it?

 86 
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:28,182
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword...

 87 
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:30,756
and his warrior days...

 88 
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:33,917
Maybe he's trying
to tell you something?

 89 
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:35,756
I don't know...

 90 
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,333
Don't be coy. I've always known
about your feelings for each other.

 91 
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,696
All these years, it's a shame...

 92 
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,034
neither of you is brave enough
to admit the truth to the other.

 93 
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:51,645
You're both wasting precious time.

 94 
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:57,280
I beg your pardon.
Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.

 95 
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,846
When it comes to emotions,

 96 
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:05,118
even great heroes can be idiots.

 97 
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:10,855
Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more
open the next time you see him.

 98 
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,991
I'll give him an earful!

 99 
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,643
Sir Te said
to leave the sword in here.

 100 
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:31,846
Who are you?

 101 
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:38,858
I'm your guest today.

 102 
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:41,324
I am Governor Yu's daughter.

 103 
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:44,859
This is Sir Te's study.
You are here to...?

 104 
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:49,936
I was just looking
for a quiet corner.

 105 
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:52,204
I am Sir Te's head servant.

 106 
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:54,238
And this is another of our guests.

 107 
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:10,316
It's heavy
for such a thin piece of metal!

 108 
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:13,451
The handle is heavy.
And the blade is no ordinary metal.

 109 
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:17,697
Still, the sword
is the lightest of weapons.

 110 
00:09:17,865 --> 00:09:20,197
You're just not used
to handling it.

 111 
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:22,892
But, I have had much practice.

 112 
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,197
As a child in the West,
a platoon lived with us.

 113 
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:27,363
They'd let me play
with their weapons.

 114 
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:31,035
The scabbard is so beautiful.

 115 
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:34,738
Beautiful but dangerous.

 116 
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:38,544
Once you see it tainted with blood,
its beauty is hard to admire.

 117 
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:42,116
It's 40000 years old.

 118 
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,057
Exquisite!

 119 
00:09:45,092 --> 00:09:47,788
You said it belongs to...

 120 
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:52,231
My friend Li Mu Bai.
He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.

 121 
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:53,494
Li Mu Bai!

 122 
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:56,898
The famous warrior?

 123 
00:09:57,071 --> 00:10:00,131
Why would he give his sword
to Sir Te?

 124 
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,738
You're too young to understand.

 125 
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:05,442
You're a sword fighter too?

 126 
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:06,511
Yes, I am.

 127 
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,511
But I prefer the machete.

 128 
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:13,016
Certain moves, however,
call for a sword.

 129 
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:15,614
Really?

 130 
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:20,994
It must be exciting to be
a fighter, to be totally free!

 131 
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:25,093
Fighters have rules too:
friendship, trust...

 132 
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,962
integrity.
Without rules...

 133 
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,501
we wouldn't survive for long.

 134 
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:33,205
I've read
all about people like you.

 135 
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:36,207
Roaming wild, beating up anyone
who gets in your way!

 136 
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:39,346
Writers wouldn't sell many books
if they told how it really is.

 137 
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,038
But you're just like
the characters in the stories.

 138 
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:46,550
Sure. No place to bathe for days,
sleeping in flea-infested beds...

 139 
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,915
They tell you all about that
in those books?

 140 
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,048
You know what I mean.

 141 
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,391
I'm getting married soon, but
I haven't lived the life I want.

 142 
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,526
So I heard.
Congratulations.

 143 
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,133
It's the most important step
in a woman's life, isn't it?

 144 
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:10,240
You're not married, are you?

 145 
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,701
What do you think?

 146 
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,075
No! You couldn't roam around
freely if you were.

 147 
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:18,883
You're probably right.

 148 
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:43,734
TE'S

 149 
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:53,686
Go ahead, Governor Yu.

 150 
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,429
2 feet 9 inches long.

 151 
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:08,625
1 inch wide.

 152 
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,203
The handle is 1 inch deep,
2.6 inches wide.

 153 
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:16,033
7 tenths of an inch thick.

 154 
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,801
With seven rubies missing
from the hilt.

 155 
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,604
You can tell the design

 156 
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,250
dates back
to before the Chin era.

 157 
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:27,410
Engraved with a technique lost
by the time of the Han Dynasty.

 158 
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:31,086
Your knowledge is remarkable,
Sir Te.

 159 
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:34,456
A sword by itself rules nothing.

 160 
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,926
It comes alive
only through skillful manipulation.

 161 
00:12:38,332 --> 00:12:41,324
I see your point.
Please continue.

 162 
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:44,596
The Imperial Court
isn't the problem.

 163 
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:48,469
With royalty and officials
everywhere...

 164 
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:53,470
the Royal Guard
keeps security tight.

 165 
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,638
But Peking is not like the West.

 166 
00:12:55,816 --> 00:13:00,150
Here, you'll find
all sorts of characters.

 167 
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,347
Proceed with caution
in your quest for law and order.

 168 
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,754
Don't depend only on the court.

 169 
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:09,487
Contacts
in the Giang Hu underworld...

 170 
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,427
can ensure your position.

 171 
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:18,698
Be strong yet supple.

 172 
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:20,931
This is the way to rule.

 173 
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:50,364
Governess...

 174 
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,336
Let me do it.

 175 
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,371
Please sit.

 176 
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:01,642
I've made you silk pajamas.
Do you want to change into them?

 177 
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:03,180
Put them down.

 178 
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,052
I heard you met Shu Lien today.

 179 
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:14,350
Do you know her?

 180 
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:16,859
She's one of those.

 181 
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:20,533
Your mother would not want you
consorting with her kind.

 182 
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:24,860
I'll socialize
with whomever I please.

 183 
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,170
Don't invite danger
into your father's house.

 184 
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:32,103
I'm tired now!

 185 
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:34,708
Go to bed then.

 186 
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:40,876
Miss has grown up,
and is getting married soon.

 187 
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,224
God knows
what the future will bring.

 188 
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,054
It'll be just the same.

 189 
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:51,522
Enough! I'm tired.

 190 
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:56,902
Autumn is coming.

 191 
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,231
I'll shut the windows for you.

 192 
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,127
- Chilly, eh?
- Yes, Master Bo.

 193 
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:29,889
Someone help!

 194 
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:31,553
Stop him!

 195 
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:33,165
He's on the roof!

 196 
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:37,201
The sword's been stolen!

 197 
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,770
Stop thief!

 198 
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,395
Stop him!

 199 
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,196
It's Jade Fox!

 200 
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:12,529
We must avenge Mother!

 201 
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:17,867
Do something!
He's getting away!

 202 
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,072
Return the sword
and I'll let you go.

 203 
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:30,054
You've been trained at Wudan?

 204 
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,923
You're mistaken.

 205 
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,827
We're just street performers.
We were rehearsing.

 206 
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,762
Father!

 207 
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:42,861
You were rehearsing?

 208 
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:44,765
Who are you trying to fool?

 209 
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,734
Where did that thief go?

 210 
00:17:58,085 --> 00:17:59,848
Governor Yu's house!

 211 
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:43,217
Get down here!

 212 
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,966
Give back the sword!

 213 
00:21:15,215 --> 00:21:17,410
Sir Te awaits you.

 214 
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:24,253
I'm sure the thief
is in the Yu household.

 215 
00:21:24,424 --> 00:21:25,482
How dare you imply?

 216 
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,293
Enough!

 217 
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:42,138
Has Governor Yu
ever seen the sword?

 218 
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:46,512
Yes, though I doubt
he's involved in this.

 219 
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,581
But the sword
could be in his compound.

 220 
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,914
Then someone's trying
to set him up.

 221 
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:00,389
We should inform Li Mu Bai.

 222 
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,469
What is it?

 223 
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:13,970
Madam Yu,
someone's put up posters.

 224 
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,803
Let me see.

 225 
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,446
Someone is after a Jade Fox.

 226 
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:31,818
Preposterous, looking for her here!

 227 
00:23:08,328 --> 00:23:10,819
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

 228 
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:14,932
I haven't seen them in two days.

 229 
00:24:07,253 --> 00:24:09,585
There's a Miss Shu Lien here
to see you.

 230 
00:24:09,756 --> 00:24:11,155
Miss is busy right now.

 231 
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,621
I'll tell her.

 232 
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,453
Show her in.

 233 
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:24,660
This spells trouble.

 234 
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:27,805
I have a guest.

 235 
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,312
This way please.

 236 
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:44,585
I've missed you.

 237 
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:45,588
How so?

 238 
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,420
I'm bored...

 239 
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,761
You're doing calligraphy?

 240 
00:24:57,504 --> 00:24:59,301
I'll write your name.

 241 
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,832
Just for fun.

 242 
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,829
I never realized my name
looks like ''sword.''

 243 
00:25:30,336 --> 00:25:34,830
You write gracefully. Calligraphy
is so similar to fencing.

 244 
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,308
Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.

 245 
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,011
Please.

 246 
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:47,816
Thank you for seeing me.
I hear your wedding day is near.

 247 
00:25:47,987 --> 00:25:50,080
You must be overwhelmed
by the preparations.

 248 
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:54,056
I'm hardly doing a thing.
The less I think of it the better.

 249 
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:59,187
My parents
are arranging everything.

 250 
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:03,495
The Gous are a very powerful family.

 251 
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:07,834
My marrying one will be good
for my father's career.

 252 
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:11,670
You are fortunate
to marry into such a noble family.

 253 
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,204
Am I?

 254 
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:16,576
I wish I were like the heroes
in the books I read.

 255 
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:18,239
Like you and Li Mu Bai.

 256 
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,945
I guess I'm happy to be marrying.

 257 
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:26,216
But to be free
to live my own life...

 258 
00:26:26,392 --> 00:26:28,587
to choose whom I love...

 259 
00:26:29,395 --> 00:26:32,228
That is true happiness.

 260 
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,063
Do you think so?
Let me tell you a story--

 261 
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:36,759
About you and Li Mu Bai?

 262 
00:26:36,936 --> 00:26:38,164
Yes.

 263 
00:26:38,338 --> 00:26:41,501
Did you know I was once engaged
to be married?

 264 
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:43,142
No, really?

 265 
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:45,106
His name was Meng Si Zhao.

 266 
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:48,345
He was a brother to Li Mu Bai
by oath.

 267 
00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:50,710
One day, while in battle...

 268 
00:26:50,884 --> 00:26:54,877
he was killed by the sword
of Li Mu Bai's enemy.

 269 
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,647
After, Li Mu Bai and I
went through a lot together.

 270 
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:00,883
Our feelings for each other
grew stronger.

 271 
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,528
But how could we dishonor...

 272 
00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:05,323
Meng's memory?

 273 
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,365
So the freedom
you talk about, I too desire it.

 274 
00:27:08,535 --> 00:27:10,799
But I have never tasted it.

 275 
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:16,533
Too bad for Meng, but it's not
your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

 276 
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:22,076
I am not an aristocrat,
as you are...

 277 
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:26,878
but I must still respect
a woman's duties.

 278 
00:27:27,487 --> 00:27:29,182
Don't distance us.

 279 
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:33,519
From now on, let's be like sisters.

 280 
00:27:36,162 --> 00:27:39,495
Then as a sister, let me wish you
happiness in your marriage.

 281 
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,564
What a godforsaken place!

 282 
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:23,569
Can't your father be appointed
closer to civilization?

 283 
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,541
Jen...

 284 
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:29,942
are you listening to me?

 285 
00:28:58,444 --> 00:28:59,638
Let's go.

 286 
00:29:24,003 --> 00:29:25,630
Who are you?

 287 
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:28,867
Wait! I'm a friend!

 288 
00:29:32,612 --> 00:29:35,342
I don't care about your sword.

 289 
00:29:35,515 --> 00:29:37,642
Why were you spying on the Yus?

 290 
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,650
I'm looking for someone.
Jade Fox.

 291 
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,221
I'm a police inspector
from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.

 292 
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,685
Jade Fox is a master criminal.
I hear she infiltrated the Yus.

 293 
00:29:49,195 --> 00:29:52,995
She must have come with them
when they transferred here.

 294 
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:57,569
But with Yu's reputation,
I can't just go in and accuse her.

 295 
00:29:57,804 --> 00:29:59,738
- This Jade Fox is a woman?
- Yes.

 296 
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:02,898
Then leave her to me.

 297 
00:30:03,076 --> 00:30:05,636
Pardon me,
but I doubt you can handle her.

 298 
00:30:05,812 --> 00:30:08,337
My wife was
quite a martial arts expert.

 299 
00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:09,879
Jade Fox killed her.

 300 
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:12,040
So you see...

 301 
00:30:12,218 --> 00:30:15,346
this is personal.
Leave her to me.

 302 
00:30:15,888 --> 00:30:17,480
It's ready.

 303 
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,189
I'm ready for anything!

 304 
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,760
Father gets first dip.

 305 
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,258
They're gone!

 306 
00:30:30,436 --> 00:30:31,664
What does it say?

 307 
00:30:31,838 --> 00:30:35,035
''We'll settle this at midnight
on Yellow Hill.''

 308 
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,870
Good! The fox is out of her hole!

 309 
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:45,377
Shu Lien, look who's here.

 310 
00:30:50,857 --> 00:30:54,588
Sir Te believes it's a ploy
to cast suspicion on Governor Yu.

 311 
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:58,060
But something is going on
at the Yu household.

 312 
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,892
What have you discovered?

 313 
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:13,643
Jade Fox?

 314 
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,069
Impossible!

 315 
00:31:15,148 --> 00:31:17,878
You'd always suspected
she'd fled to the West.

 316 
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,484
I didn't think she'd dare
come back to Peking!

 317 
00:31:20,553 --> 00:31:23,613
Is there any place safer
than under the nose of Governor Yu?

 318 
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:30,059
So I shall avenge
my master's death after all.

 319 
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:33,662
Be careful.

 320 
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,427
Sir Te requires discretion.

 321 
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:38,832
Official business
is difficult enough.

 322 
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:42,566
Don't let personal feelings
make it worse.

 323 
00:31:43,142 --> 00:31:45,940
And I don't know...
even this poster...

 324 
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,977
could be some sort of trap.

 325 
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:52,106
Did you see who posted it?

 326 
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:53,450
No.

 327 
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:55,814
It says Fox is hiding at Yu's.

 328 
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:59,082
On the night of the theft
there was a brawl near Yu's.

 329 
00:31:59,992 --> 00:32:01,857
Were you involved?

 330 
00:32:02,028 --> 00:32:04,019
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.

 331 
00:32:04,197 --> 00:32:07,030
I hear he followed the thief
to the Yu's.

 332 
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,758
Have you questioned him yet?

 333 
00:32:09,168 --> 00:32:11,261
No, not yet...

 334 
00:32:11,704 --> 00:32:13,763
But your men are watching over
Yu's compound?

 335 
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,670
No, I'd already sent them home.

 336 
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,371
You can blame me
for losing the sword...

 337 
00:32:21,547 --> 00:32:23,777
but please trust
that I'll get it back soon...

 338 
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,941
using my own methods.

 339 
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:28,787
That's not what I meant.

 340 
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:30,650
I don't care about the sword.

 341 
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:34,785
What do you mean?
Didn't you come back here for it?

 342 
00:32:35,294 --> 00:32:38,730
I didn't know it was stolen
until I got here.

 343 
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:41,966
Then, why did you come?

 344 
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:46,903
Well, we had talked--

 345 
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,072
Pardon my intrusion.
Master Li...

 346 
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:54,042
your room is ready.

 347 
00:32:55,915 --> 00:32:57,007
Thank you.

 348 
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,209
Please, lead the way.

 349 
00:33:10,897 --> 00:33:13,422
The Fox doesn't care much
for punctuality.

 350 
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,760
Still no sign of her.

 351 
00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:25,242
Enough! Show yourself!.

 352 
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:30,905
Tsai...

 353 
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,615
You dog!

 354 
00:33:32,785 --> 00:33:34,616
You will pay
for your stubborness!

 355 
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:37,747
That's what you think, old witch!

 356 
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:40,950
If you surrender now,
you'll suffer less.

 357 
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,621
But if you resist,
I won't stop until you're dead.

 358 
00:33:44,463 --> 00:33:45,293
Father!

 359 
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:47,629
Let me avenge my mother's death!

 360 
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,030
You'll soon end up like her,
you little whore!

 361 
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:52,534
You'll pay for that!

 362 
00:35:16,088 --> 00:35:17,419
She's going to paralyze you!

 363 
00:35:24,296 --> 00:35:25,388
May!

 364 
00:35:34,774 --> 00:35:36,139
Tsai, you filthy mongrel!

 365 
00:35:38,778 --> 00:35:40,712
An ambush!

 366 
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:46,584
Father, are you all right?

 367 
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,550
Wudan should have gotten
rid of you long ago.

 368 
00:35:51,157 --> 00:35:53,148
It's been a long time, Jade Fox!

 369 
00:35:54,627 --> 00:35:56,219
You don't remember me...

 370 
00:35:56,796 --> 00:36:00,391
But you should
remember my master.

 371 
00:36:00,566 --> 00:36:02,727
You infiltrated Wudan
while I was away.

 372 
00:36:02,902 --> 00:36:05,132
You stole our secret manual...

 373 
00:36:05,304 --> 00:36:07,329
and poisoned our master!

 374 
00:36:07,506 --> 00:36:10,441
Now it's time for you to pay!

 375 
00:36:11,177 --> 00:36:13,645
Your master
underestimated us women.

 376 
00:36:13,813 --> 00:36:16,805
Sure, he'd sleep with me,
but he would never teach me.

 377 
00:36:17,016 --> 00:36:19,780
He deserved to die
by a woman's hand!

 378 
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,690
You stole the secrets
of Wudan's highest martial arts.

 379 
00:37:03,863 --> 00:37:06,832
But after ten years of training
your moves are still undisciplined.

 380 
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:08,466
And today...

 381 
00:37:08,634 --> 00:37:11,330
under a Wudan sword...

 382 
00:37:11,504 --> 00:37:12,198
you will die!

 383 
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:20,870
Disciple, we'll kill them all!

 384 
00:37:21,046 --> 00:37:22,035
Let's go!

 385 
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:23,848
Another one!

 386 
00:37:24,316 --> 00:37:26,341
I must get rid of Tsai!

 387 
00:37:32,758 --> 00:37:33,725
Who are you?

 388 
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:38,086
Why is the Green Destiny
in your possession?

 389 
00:37:40,232 --> 00:37:41,324
What's it to you?

 390 
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,024
My name is Li Mu Bai.

 391 
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:45,596
The Green Destiny is mine.

 392 
00:37:56,182 --> 00:37:58,412
Jade Fox can't be your master.

 393 
00:37:58,584 --> 00:38:00,518
Where did you learn
that ''Xuan Piu'' move?

 394 
00:38:00,686 --> 00:38:01,516
I'm just playing around.

 395 
00:38:08,427 --> 00:38:10,088
Tell me, who is your master?

 396 
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:33,383
- Let's go!
- We must kill them!

 397 
00:38:42,828 --> 00:38:43,795
Father!

 398 
00:39:06,285 --> 00:39:08,150
This is Tsai?

 399 
00:39:09,755 --> 00:39:11,154
My father.

 400 
00:39:11,323 --> 00:39:13,848
Police inspector from Shaan.

 401 
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,624
This should be reported
to Governor Yu.

 402 
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:21,959
The victim is an officer.

 403 
00:39:22,134 --> 00:39:24,694
You believe the killer
is hiding out in his compound?

 404 
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:28,602
I'd bet my life on it!

 405 
00:39:33,512 --> 00:39:34,774
Come with me.

 406 
00:39:36,615 --> 00:39:40,142
This needs to be resolved,
and quickly.

 407 
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:44,551
I'll get into the Yu household
and get her.

 408 
00:39:44,723 --> 00:39:46,520
I'll ferret out Fox and her gang.

 409 
00:39:46,692 --> 00:39:48,125
We must be careful.

 410 
00:39:48,193 --> 00:39:51,594
Yu is a court official,
and in charge of security.

 411 
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,858
Any disturbance
will cast suspicion on him.

 412 
00:39:55,034 --> 00:39:56,763
It might get Sir Te in trouble.

 413 
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,094
This is a delicate matter.

 414 
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,439
Sir Te, can you find some excuse...

 415 
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,544
to invite
Madam Yu and her daughter?

 416 
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,777
What do you have in mind?

 417 
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:14,542
The best way to trap a fox
is through her cubs.

 418 
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:22,552
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us
with these wedding gifts.

 419 
00:40:23,228 --> 00:40:26,391
She's being so considerate.

 420 
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:29,461
I'm sorry she's not feeling
well enough to receive you today.

 421 
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,433
I heard Sir Te lost something.

 422 
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:35,801
And now Madam Te's
not feeling well...

 423 
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:39,342
We know who stole
the missing item.

 424 
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,440
If the thief returns it,
I'm sure Sir Te will pursue...

 425 
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:48,518
the matter no further.

 426 
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:49,984
That's good.

 427 
00:40:50,422 --> 00:40:53,255
Sometimes the help can't keep
their hands to themselves.

 428 
00:40:53,425 --> 00:40:54,983
It's very embarrassing.

 429 
00:40:55,194 --> 00:40:59,153
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
people can make mistakes...

 430 
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:02,494
that can bring ruin to themselves
and their families.

 431 
00:41:05,137 --> 00:41:06,832
But don't be too lenient.

 432 
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:10,100
No mercy will be shown
toward the murderer...

 433 
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:11,708
who turned up in Peking.

 434 
00:41:12,711 --> 00:41:14,702
A murderer?

 435 
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,778
Yes...

 436 
00:41:15,948 --> 00:41:20,009
the very killer
of Li Mu Bai's own master.

 437 
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:21,015
Last night...

 438 
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:23,950
she killed a policeman
who had tracked her down.

 439 
00:41:24,123 --> 00:41:26,956
A female criminal!
Now that's news!

 440 
00:41:27,126 --> 00:41:30,152
You say she killed
a policeman?

 441 
00:41:30,562 --> 00:41:31,961
Yes, from the West.

 442 
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:35,692
He went undercover,
and followed her here.

 443 
00:41:36,502 --> 00:41:37,662
Maybe the murderer...

 444 
00:41:37,836 --> 00:41:40,430
and the thief are the same.

 445 
00:41:40,506 --> 00:41:41,564
I doubt that.

 446 
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:43,333
This thief...

 447 
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,242
is very unusual.

 448 
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:49,276
And most likely smarter
than a mere killer.

 449 
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,520
Greetings, Sir Te.

 450 
00:42:04,997 --> 00:42:06,328
Hello, Madam Yu.

 451 
00:42:06,498 --> 00:42:07,658
This is Li Mu Bai...

 452 
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:10,267
the renowned swordsman.

 453 
00:42:10,436 --> 00:42:12,028
Delighted to meet you.

 454 
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,900
Miss Yu is soon to be married.

 455 
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,569
Congratulations.

 456 
00:42:34,259 --> 00:42:36,386
Why don't you come in?

 457 
00:42:36,562 --> 00:42:38,189
I'm standing guard.

 458 
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,055
Come in. It's cold.

 459 
00:42:46,805 --> 00:42:48,067
Come in.

 460 
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,232
We don't have to fear Jade Fox
if we're together.

 461 
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:16,998
Isn't it a bit late to be out?

 462 
00:43:20,572 --> 00:43:22,005
You've brought me the sword?

 463 
00:43:23,075 --> 00:43:25,236
I do as I please.

 464 
00:43:28,413 --> 00:43:29,641
Where is your master?

 465 
00:43:30,082 --> 00:43:30,980
What's it to you?

 466 
00:43:57,609 --> 00:43:59,304
Had enough flying?

 467 
00:44:03,148 --> 00:44:04,206
You've got potential.

 468 
00:44:04,383 --> 00:44:08,649
You've studied the Wudan manual
but you don't understand it.

 469 
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:14,152
You need a real master.

 470 
00:44:14,493 --> 00:44:16,688
Do you think
you are a real master?

 471 
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:20,662
Like most things,
I am nothing.

 472 
00:44:20,832 --> 00:44:22,697
It's the same for this sword.

 473 
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,302
All of it is simply
a state of mind.

 474 
00:44:26,138 --> 00:44:28,163
Stop talking like a monk!

 475 
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,307
Just fight!

 476 
00:44:29,474 --> 00:44:31,169
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.

 477 
00:44:31,343 --> 00:44:32,002
On guard!

 478 
00:44:46,658 --> 00:44:48,649
Real sharpness
comes without effort.

 479 
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,004
No growth.

 480 
00:45:08,213 --> 00:45:09,339
Without assistance.

 481 
00:45:10,115 --> 00:45:11,241
No action.

 482 
00:45:11,783 --> 00:45:12,875
Without reaction.

 483 
00:45:13,418 --> 00:45:14,942
No desire without restraint.

 484 
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,745
Now give yourself up
and find yourself again.

 485 
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,624
There is a lesson for you.

 486 
00:45:26,632 --> 00:45:27,894
Go ahead.

 487 
00:45:30,035 --> 00:45:30,763
Why should I?

 488 
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:35,066
You need practice. I can teach you
to fight with the Green Destiny,

 489 
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,141
but first you must learn
to hold it in stillness.

 490 
00:45:40,712 --> 00:45:42,543
Why do you want to teach me?

 491 
00:45:44,149 --> 00:45:46,083
I've always wanted a disciple...

 492 
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:49,743
worthy of Wudan's secrets.

 493 
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,551
And if I use them
to kill you?

 494 
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:57,220
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

 495 
00:45:57,396 --> 00:46:01,389
Deep down, you're good.
Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.

 496 
00:46:03,335 --> 00:46:05,462
Wudan is a whorehouse!

 497 
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:06,763
Keep your lessons!

 498 
00:46:25,757 --> 00:46:27,190
You're home late...

 499 
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,792
or should I say early?

 500 
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,927
Why are you still here?
You killed a policeman.

 501 
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:35,832
You should leave!

 502 
00:46:36,802 --> 00:46:39,498
You'll bring ruin
on my whole family.

 503 
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:42,970
They wouldn't have found me
if you hadn't stolen the sword.

 504 
00:46:43,608 --> 00:46:46,873
Like a little girl,
you thought stealing would be fun?

 505 
00:46:47,779 --> 00:46:50,680
You, too, are responsible
for that death. Come with me.

 506 
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,943
You don't want to waste your life
as the wife of some bureaucrat.

 507 
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,956
Denied your talent...

 508 
00:46:59,124 --> 00:47:01,558
As master and disciple
we will rule.

 509 
00:47:01,727 --> 00:47:02,853
I'll never live as a thief!.

 510 
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,791
You're already a thief.

 511 
00:47:04,963 --> 00:47:06,225
That was just for fun.

 512 
00:47:06,398 --> 00:47:08,389
How can I leave?
Where would I go?

 513 
00:47:09,534 --> 00:47:11,058
Wherever we want.

 514 
00:47:11,236 --> 00:47:13,033
We'll get rid of anyone
in our way.

 515 
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,137
Even your father.

 516 
00:47:14,306 --> 00:47:15,398
Shut up!

 517 
00:47:15,574 --> 00:47:19,510
It's the Giang Hu fighter
lifestyle... kill or be killed.

 518 
00:47:19,678 --> 00:47:21,407
Exciting, isn't it?

 519 
00:47:27,185 --> 00:47:29,153
I owe you nothing.

 520 
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:31,380
Yes, you do!

 521 
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:35,924
You are still my disciple.

 522 
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:47,532
You think you've been teaching me
all these years from the manual?

 523 
00:47:48,273 --> 00:47:50,605
You couldn't even
decipher the symbols!

 524 
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:55,173
I studied the diagrams.

 525 
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:57,281
But you hid the details!

 526 
00:47:57,449 --> 00:48:01,078
You wouldn't have understood,
even if I had tried to explain.

 527 
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,748
You know...

 528 
00:48:03,388 --> 00:48:06,221
you've gone as far as you can go.

 529 
00:48:06,792 --> 00:48:09,590
I hid my skills
so as not to hurt you.

 530 
00:48:11,563 --> 00:48:15,055
If I hadn't seen you
fight with Li Mu Bai...

 531 
00:48:15,634 --> 00:48:18,899
I'd still be ignorant
of all you've hidden from me.

 532 
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:23,272
Master...

 533 
00:48:24,876 --> 00:48:28,073
I started learning from you
in secret when I was 1 00.

 534 
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,371
You enchanted me
with the world of Giang Hun.

 535 
00:48:31,983 --> 00:48:35,885
But once I realized
I could surpass you...

 536 
00:48:36,054 --> 00:48:37,646
I became so frightened!

 537 
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,282
Everything fell apart.

 538 
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,621
I had no one to guide me...

 539 
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,821
no one to learn from.

 540 
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:50,758
Believe me...

 541 
00:48:50,936 --> 00:48:52,995
I've a lesson or two left
to teach you!

 542 
00:50:05,076 --> 00:50:06,043
The sword is back...

 543 
00:50:06,678 --> 00:50:08,305
Are you happy?

 544 
00:50:09,514 --> 00:50:11,414
I admit...

 545 
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,143
getting it back makes me realize
how much I'd missed it.

 546 
00:50:14,986 --> 00:50:17,318
But it's not your sword anymore.

 547 
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:19,650
You gave it to Sir Te.

 548 
00:50:21,192 --> 00:50:22,318
True.

 549 
00:50:23,161 --> 00:50:26,494
But I must borrow it
for one last mission.

 550 
00:50:27,098 --> 00:50:29,692
Jade Fox must die at its edge.

 551 
00:50:34,205 --> 00:50:38,107
Did you know what you were hiding
when you covered for that girl?

 552 
00:50:38,276 --> 00:50:41,712
My job was to get the sword back,
without embarrassing anyone.

 553 
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,610
I wasn't about to ruin...

 554 
00:50:44,783 --> 00:50:47,183
her life, or her father's.

 555 
00:50:47,352 --> 00:50:50,082
You did your job well.

 556 
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,883
But, this girl...

 557 
00:50:54,025 --> 00:50:55,287
I saw her last night.

 558 
00:50:57,896 --> 00:50:59,761
I knew she would intrigue you.

 559 
00:51:00,465 --> 00:51:02,296
She needs direction...

 560 
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:05,561
and training.

 561 
00:51:05,737 --> 00:51:08,763
She's an aristocrat's daughter.
She's not one of us.

 562 
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,067
In any case,
it will all be over soon.

 563 
00:51:11,242 --> 00:51:14,939
You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.

 564 
00:51:16,815 --> 00:51:18,544
That's not for her.

 565 
00:51:18,717 --> 00:51:21,083
She should come to Wudan
and become a disciple.

 566 
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,812
But Wudan does not accept women.

 567 
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,114
For her, they might
make an exception.

 568 
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:31,228
If not, I'm afraid she'll become
a poisoned dragon.

 569 
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:34,594
It's not our affair.

 570 
00:51:34,766 --> 00:51:39,567
Even if Wudan accepts her,
her husband might object.

 571 
00:51:42,807 --> 00:51:44,775
I thought by giving away the sword,

 572 
00:51:44,943 --> 00:51:46,911
I could escape the Giang Hu world.

 573 
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:51,743
But the cycle of bloodshed
continues.

 574 
00:51:52,817 --> 00:51:55,149
I wish there were something more...

 575 
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,515
I could do to help you.

 576 
00:52:03,695 --> 00:52:06,163
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

 577 
00:52:27,919 --> 00:52:28,977
Lo?

 578 
00:52:29,554 --> 00:52:30,646
Jen!

 579 
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:45,401
You shouldn't have come.

 580 
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:51,197
With all the traffic
on your rooftop these days...

 581 
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,105
it took me a while
to get in here.

 582 
00:52:53,278 --> 00:52:55,212
I can't wait any longer.

 583 
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,008
I was wrong to let you go.

 584 
00:52:58,616 --> 00:52:59,742
Come back with me.

 585 
00:52:59,918 --> 00:53:02,352
You'll be happy in the desert.

 586 
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,351
You'll be free there.

 587 
00:53:06,925 --> 00:53:09,519
You've been looking for me
all this time?

 588 
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:33,742
Jen...

 589 
00:53:33,918 --> 00:53:35,545
Stop playing with it.

 590 
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:38,112
I won't break it.

 591 
00:54:06,417 --> 00:54:07,406
It's Dark Cloud!

 592 
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:10,010
Dark Cloud is coming!

 593 
00:54:25,537 --> 00:54:28,005
Lower the shade,
don't let them see you!

 594 
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:48,384
Don't touch the women!

 595 
00:55:18,056 --> 00:55:19,546
Let's go!

 596 
00:55:38,176 --> 00:55:39,370
Come get your comb.

 597 
00:56:28,726 --> 00:56:31,490
Hurry back to your mother.

 598 
00:57:32,724 --> 00:57:34,419
She's mine!

 599 
00:57:34,592 --> 00:57:35,581
Leave her to me!

 600 
00:57:46,104 --> 00:57:47,799
Come and get it!

 601 
00:57:47,872 --> 00:57:49,601
Give me back my comb!

 602 
00:57:51,142 --> 00:57:52,609
Let's stop a moment.

 603 
00:57:52,777 --> 00:57:54,438
Give it back!

 604 
00:57:54,979 --> 00:57:57,243
You're tired. You need rest.

 605 
00:58:03,321 --> 00:58:06,290
Your horse needs water.
There's a creek up here.

 606 
00:58:14,265 --> 00:58:16,256
Well, there used to be!

 607 
00:58:23,775 --> 00:58:24,742
What's your name?

 608 
00:58:26,744 --> 00:58:27,938
I'm Lo.

 609 
00:58:28,112 --> 00:58:30,239
The Hans call me Dark Cloud.

 610 
00:58:30,415 --> 00:58:32,246
I'm not that tall or big...

 611 
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:34,180
but I'm quick as lightning.

 612 
00:58:47,165 --> 00:58:48,427
My comb!

 613 
01:00:24,362 --> 01:00:27,354
If you like that arrow,
I can make you a bow.

 614 
01:00:27,532 --> 01:00:29,796
Great for hunting wild chicken.

 615 
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:31,696
They're delicious.

 616 
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:39,642
You need to eat.
Understand?

 617 
01:00:40,811 --> 01:00:43,780
Then you'll have
the strength to fight.

 618 
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:46,739
Understand?

 619 
01:00:56,594 --> 01:00:58,619
You're eating too fast.

 620 
01:00:58,796 --> 01:01:00,229
Slowly.

 621 
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:07,380
You've got quite a temper.

 622 
01:03:07,558 --> 01:03:09,526
It's better this way...

 623 
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:17,534
You coward!

 624 
01:03:20,404 --> 01:03:22,429
Still in a bad mood?

 625 
01:03:22,606 --> 01:03:24,699
At least you're speaking.

 626 
01:03:25,242 --> 01:03:26,436
What's your name?

 627 
01:03:29,246 --> 01:03:31,578
I didn't think the Hans
had names like that.

 628 
01:04:10,454 --> 01:04:11,182
Relax.

 629 
01:04:11,822 --> 01:04:14,848
If I had wanted to, I would
already have done it.

 630 
01:04:15,993 --> 01:04:18,359
You must be dying for a bath.

 631 
01:04:18,829 --> 01:04:21,696
Fresh water's hard to get here.

 632 
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:24,631
But I managed to bring some up.

 633 
01:04:24,802 --> 01:04:27,293
You can wear my clothes
when you're done.

 634 
01:04:27,938 --> 01:04:29,462
They're clean.

 635 
01:04:45,389 --> 01:04:46,720
Don't worry.

 636 
01:04:49,393 --> 01:04:53,159
I'll sing,
so you'll know where I am.

 637 
01:04:54,165 --> 01:04:56,463
After the bath,
you'll be calmer.

 638 
01:04:58,669 --> 01:05:00,227
No more hitting on the head!

 639 
01:06:13,143 --> 01:06:15,441
All this trouble for a comb?

 640 
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,947
It's mine.

 641 
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:22,143
It means a lot to me. A barbarian
like you wouldn't understand.

 642 
01:06:23,587 --> 01:06:26,556
Not true. I can use it
to pick fleas from my horse.

 643 
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:30,150
By the way,
I'm a real Manchurian.

 644 
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:34,490
I'm sorry...

 645 
01:06:34,899 --> 01:06:36,161
I guessed wrong.

 646 
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:38,096
I thought you were a Han.

 647 
01:06:40,437 --> 01:06:42,405
Give me back my comb.

 648 
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:48,574
I don't take orders from anyone.

 649 
01:06:55,486 --> 01:06:56,475
Give it back.

 650 
01:08:15,099 --> 01:08:16,566
One night...

 651 
01:08:17,234 --> 01:08:21,364
when I was a boy, I saw
a thousand shooting stars.

 652 
01:08:22,373 --> 01:08:25,399
I thought,
''Where did they all go?''

 653 
01:08:25,876 --> 01:08:29,903
I'm an orphan.
I used to look for stars alone.

 654 
01:08:30,948 --> 01:08:36,045
I thought if I rode to the other
end of the desert, I'd find them.

 655 
01:08:36,854 --> 01:08:39,880
I've been riding in the desert
ever since.

 656 
01:08:41,425 --> 01:08:43,916
And so, the little boy
became a fearsome bandit.

 657 
01:08:44,094 --> 01:08:47,188
He couldn't find the stars,
so he stole my comb.

 658 
01:08:48,565 --> 01:08:52,262
Out here, you always fight
for survival.

 659 
01:08:52,436 --> 01:08:56,099
You have to be part of a gang
to stand a chance.

 660 
01:08:56,273 --> 01:08:59,470
Slowly,
your gang becomes your family.

 661 
01:09:00,377 --> 01:09:03,540
All that Dark Cloud stuff
is just to scare people...

 662 
01:09:03,714 --> 01:09:05,944
and make my life easier.

 663 
01:09:06,784 --> 01:09:09,309
So you are still that little boy...

 664 
01:09:09,486 --> 01:09:11,784
looking for shooting stars.

 665 
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:14,921
I am a man.

 666 
01:09:15,592 --> 01:09:19,585
And now I've found
the brightest star of all.

 667 
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:43,753
Your father's men
are looking for you.

 668 
01:10:14,785 --> 01:10:16,685
They're still out there,
circling closer.

 669 
01:10:19,389 --> 01:10:21,050
Let them look.

 670 
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:24,623
It is trouble for me.

 671 
01:10:27,464 --> 01:10:29,056
Don't send me back.

 672 
01:10:32,136 --> 01:10:33,694
You must decide.

 673 
01:10:33,871 --> 01:10:36,738
You might get tired of this life.

 674 
01:10:38,809 --> 01:10:41,573
You might begin
to miss your family.

 675 
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:45,378
If it were our daughter,
we'd look for her too.

 676 
01:10:45,549 --> 01:10:47,847
She would miss us.

 677 
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:53,979
Jen...

 678 
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:57,524
I want you to be mine forever.

 679 
01:10:58,595 --> 01:11:00,187
I will make my mark
on the world.

 680 
01:11:00,364 --> 01:11:02,832
I will earn your parents' respect.

 681 
01:11:03,901 --> 01:11:05,562
We have a legend.

 682 
01:11:05,736 --> 01:11:08,102
Anyone who dares to jump
from the mountain...

 683 
01:11:08,272 --> 01:11:10,399
God will grant his wish.

 684 
01:11:10,908 --> 01:11:15,743
Long ago, a young man's parents
were ill, so he jumped.

 685 
01:11:15,913 --> 01:11:17,437
He didn't die.

 686 
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:19,746
He wasn't even hurt.

 687 
01:11:20,117 --> 01:11:22,881
He floated away,
far away, never to return.

 688 
01:11:24,855 --> 01:11:27,449
He knew his wish had come true.

 689 
01:11:28,358 --> 01:11:30,622
If you believe,
it will happen.

 690 
01:11:31,528 --> 01:11:33,553
The elders say...

 691 
01:11:34,031 --> 01:11:36,625
''A faithful heart
makes wishes come true.''

 692 
01:11:47,778 --> 01:11:49,405
Keep it safe.

 693 
01:11:50,547 --> 01:11:53,482
Return it to me
when we are together again.

 694 
01:11:55,786 --> 01:11:56,912
I will.

 695 
01:12:04,595 --> 01:12:08,156
If you don't,
I'll come after you.

 696 
01:12:08,899 --> 01:12:11,732
And I won't let you off so easy.

 697 
01:12:23,614 --> 01:12:27,015
Wherever I went
someone always recognized me.

 698 
01:12:27,684 --> 01:12:29,618
I really tried.

 699 
01:12:32,823 --> 01:12:34,757
Later, I heard you came
to Peking.

 700 
01:12:34,925 --> 01:12:37,257
I was afraid
I'd never see you again.

 701 
01:12:37,661 --> 01:12:39,526
So I came.

 702 
01:12:40,197 --> 01:12:42,165
I can't let you marry.

 703 
01:12:46,203 --> 01:12:47,397
Go.

 704 
01:12:48,472 --> 01:12:49,564
Jen...

 705 
01:12:52,476 --> 01:12:54,410
Don't ever come back.

 706 
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:56,170
So it's over?

 707 
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:58,715
Yes.

 708 
01:13:14,531 --> 01:13:16,761
We heard noises.

 709 
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,561
It was just a cat.

 710 
01:13:36,253 --> 01:13:38,517
You think Jade Fox will show up?

 711 
01:13:38,689 --> 01:13:40,589
She's out there...

 712 
01:13:41,191 --> 01:13:44,024
but I doubt she'll show herself.

 713 
01:13:44,194 --> 01:13:45,718
We'll keep our eyes open.

 714 
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:46,785
Sooner or later...

 715 
01:13:47,097 --> 01:13:50,089
she'll come for the girl.

 716 
01:14:08,885 --> 01:14:09,874
Jen!

 717 
01:14:19,563 --> 01:14:20,757
Come with me!

 718 
01:14:35,579 --> 01:14:38,673
You're mine!
Come with me to the desert!

 719 
01:14:51,928 --> 01:14:52,690
Jen!

 720 
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:55,325
Come with me to Xin Jiang!

 721 
01:15:00,804 --> 01:15:01,463
Tell me.

 722 
01:15:01,638 --> 01:15:02,935
Where is Jade Fox?

 723 
01:15:03,106 --> 01:15:04,801
Come with me. Hurry!

 724 
01:15:08,445 --> 01:15:11,278
You thought she'd give it all up
and go back West with you?

 725 
01:15:13,683 --> 01:15:15,048
She's mine.

 726 
01:15:15,218 --> 01:15:16,515
Either way...

 727 
01:15:16,686 --> 01:15:20,315
you are no good to her dead.
With the Gou and Yu clans...

 728 
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:23,323
hunting you,
you'll soon be in their hands.

 729 
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:24,991
I don't care anymore.

 730 
01:15:27,497 --> 01:15:30,295
If you truly loved her,
you wouldn't say that.

 731 
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:35,402
Don't you want to see her again?

 732 
01:15:37,808 --> 01:15:38,797
All right.

 733 
01:15:38,975 --> 01:15:41,409
I'll write you an introduction.
Take it to Wudan.

 734 
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:43,512
Wait there for news from me.

 735 
01:15:46,149 --> 01:15:47,081
All right.

 736 
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:58,254
When wills this end?

 737 
01:15:58,428 --> 01:16:01,329
They take it, they put it back,
they take it again.

 738 
01:16:01,498 --> 01:16:05,491
My home is turning into
a warehouse.

 739 
01:16:05,669 --> 01:16:06,567
Come in.

 740 
01:16:08,738 --> 01:16:09,670
Speak!

 741 
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,205
Jen has run away!

 742 
01:16:11,374 --> 01:16:13,706
Gou found
the wedding chamber empty.

 743 
01:16:13,877 --> 01:16:16,607
Governor Yu requests
your assistance.

 744 
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,407
You know
the Giang Hu underworld.

 745 
01:16:18,582 --> 01:16:22,348
He wants to find her,
and keep her from harm.

 746 
01:16:23,687 --> 01:16:27,282
Sir Te, leave this to us.
Don't worry.

 747 
01:16:45,742 --> 01:16:47,232
What can I serve you?

 748 
01:16:49,613 --> 01:16:50,807
This cup is dirty.

 749 
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:06,894
Hello.

 750 
01:17:07,731 --> 01:17:10,962
What's your name?

 751 
01:17:11,968 --> 01:17:13,162
Long.

 752 
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,836
It's young Master Long.

 753 
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,167
My apologies!

 754 
01:17:18,341 --> 01:17:21,174
I'm Iron Eagle Sung...

 755 
01:17:21,344 --> 01:17:22,902
and this is my brother in arms...

 756 
01:17:23,079 --> 01:17:24,808
Flying Cougar Li Yun.

 757 
01:17:24,981 --> 01:17:26,414
What brings you to Huai An...

 758 
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:28,949
and where are you headed,
Master Long?

 759 
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,487
Anywhere there's action.

 760 
01:17:32,622 --> 01:17:36,251
In that case, perhaps
we could be of assistance.

 761 
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:39,119
Don't bother.

 762 
01:17:40,764 --> 01:17:43,289
You don't seem to understand.

 763 
01:17:45,302 --> 01:17:46,792
So what if I don't?

 764 
01:17:48,438 --> 01:17:51,839
We have ways of helping you
to understand.

 765 
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:03,383
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

 766 
01:18:05,822 --> 01:18:07,551
He is my defeated foe!

 767 
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:28,203
Have some tea.

 768 
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:58,602
Shu Lien...

 769 
01:18:59,242 --> 01:19:02,211
The things we touch
have no permanence.

 770 
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,181
My master would say...

 771 
01:19:06,349 --> 01:19:09,716
there is nothing
we can hold on to in this world.

 772 
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:14,846
Only by letting go
can we truly possess what is real.

 773 
01:19:16,426 --> 01:19:19,554
Not everything
is an illusion.

 774 
01:19:19,729 --> 01:19:21,458
My hand...

 775 
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:23,895
wasn't that real?

 776 
01:19:25,869 --> 01:19:30,306
Your hand, rough and callused
from practice...

 777 
01:19:30,473 --> 01:19:33,704
All this time, I've never had
the courage to touch it.

 778 
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:41,914
Giang Hu is a world
of tigers and dragons...

 779 
01:19:42,085 --> 01:19:46,249
full of corruption...

 780 
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:50,220
I tried sincerely to give it up...

 781 
01:19:50,393 --> 01:19:52,623
but I have brought us
only trouble.

 782 
01:19:52,796 --> 01:19:55,390
To repress one's feelings
only makes them stronger.

 783 
01:19:55,965 --> 01:19:58,934
You're right,
but I don't know what to do.

 784 
01:19:59,102 --> 01:20:01,297
I want to be with you...

 785 
01:20:03,673 --> 01:20:05,334
just like this.

 786 
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:10,006
It gives me a sense of peace.

 787 
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:29,028
Please follow me.

 788 
01:20:31,601 --> 01:20:34,365
- I want a clean room.
- We have plenty.

 789 
01:20:37,006 --> 01:20:38,166
Your order?

 790 
01:20:38,274 --> 01:20:39,866
Steamed whole cod,
bite-size meatballs...

 791 
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:42,534
a little starchy,
but keep the sauce light...

 792 
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:45,840
shark fin soup, mixed vegetables,
and some warm wine.

 793 
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:49,150
I have to order
from a bigger restaurant.

 794 
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:50,377
Hurry then.

 795 
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:34,854
That's him.

 796 
01:21:43,873 --> 01:21:47,001
I am Iron Arm Mi.

 797 
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:51,345
I heard a true master has arrived.
I have come to seek a lesson.

 798 
01:22:04,761 --> 01:22:06,194
You asked for it!

 799 
01:22:26,616 --> 01:22:28,379
What kind of Iron Arm are you?

 800 
01:22:43,933 --> 01:22:45,423
You have amazing technique!

 801 
01:22:45,602 --> 01:22:47,934
I am Flying Saber.

 802 
01:22:48,104 --> 01:22:51,096
Are you related
to Southern Crane?

 803 
01:22:51,274 --> 01:22:54,334
Southern Duck? I don't eat
anything with two feet.

 804 
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,741
Who could remember
such long-winded names?

 805 
01:22:58,615 --> 01:23:00,276
Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe...

 806 
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:03,180
and you don't know
his master Southern Crane?

 807 
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:05,616
Who are you?

 808 
01:23:06,689 --> 01:23:10,682
I'm Shining Phoenix
Mountain Gou.

 809 
01:23:12,295 --> 01:23:13,489
Gou?

 810 
01:23:14,097 --> 01:23:15,792
I hate that name.

 811 
01:23:15,965 --> 01:23:17,489
It makes me puke!

 812 
01:23:18,167 --> 01:23:20,761
Too bad you're named Gou.

 813 
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:23,195
You'll be the first
to feel my sword today.

 814 
01:23:44,827 --> 01:23:45,794
Hold it!

 815 
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:49,391
Don't you know Monk Jing?

 816 
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:52,160
A monk, in a place like this?
You need a lesson!

 817 
01:23:52,335 --> 01:23:53,996
Who are you?

 818 
01:23:55,138 --> 01:23:56,366
Who am I?

 819 
01:23:56,806 --> 01:23:57,795
I am...

 820 
01:24:01,878 --> 01:24:05,541
I am
the Invincible Sword Goddess.

 821 
01:24:07,216 --> 01:24:09,081
Armed with the incredible...

 822 
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:10,742
Green Destiny.

 823 
01:24:16,993 --> 01:24:19,257
Beyou Li or Southern Crane...

 824 
01:24:20,863 --> 01:24:22,490
lower your head...

 825 
01:24:22,665 --> 01:24:23,859
and ask for mercy.

 826 
01:24:30,673 --> 01:24:33,540
I am the desert dragon.

 827 
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:45,080
I leave no trace.

 828 
01:24:55,598 --> 01:24:58,863
Today I fly over Eu-Mei.

 829 
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:02,130
Tomorrow...

 830 
01:25:02,438 --> 01:25:05,874
I'll kick over
Wudan Mountain!

 831 
01:25:20,089 --> 01:25:23,115
We politely asked for
a friendly match...

 832 
01:25:23,292 --> 01:25:25,556
but she showed no respect,
and attacked us.

 833 
01:25:25,728 --> 01:25:29,255
Everyone came by
to teach her a lesson.

 834 
01:25:29,432 --> 01:25:31,662
Her sword was just too powerful.

 835 
01:25:31,834 --> 01:25:33,096
I've traveled everywhere...

 836 
01:25:33,269 --> 01:25:35,294
but never
met anyone so uncivilized.

 837 
01:25:35,471 --> 01:25:39,669
She kept accusing me of being
Gou Jun Pei's brother.

 838 
01:25:39,842 --> 01:25:42,811
Who is this Gou, anyway?

 839 
01:25:44,414 --> 01:25:45,574
Her husband.

 840 
01:25:58,327 --> 01:26:00,318
We're close
to your headquarters.

 841 
01:26:00,496 --> 01:26:01,895
Go home and check in.

 842 
01:26:02,065 --> 01:26:03,293
What about you?

 843 
01:26:03,466 --> 01:26:05,764
I'll look around
and catch up later.

 844 
01:26:05,935 --> 01:26:06,799
Not a bad idea.

 845 
01:26:06,969 --> 01:26:10,905
Tonight we'll get a good night's
sleep at headquarters.

 846 
01:26:37,266 --> 01:26:38,597
Mistress, you're back.

 847 
01:26:44,373 --> 01:26:45,806
It's you!

 848 
01:26:46,876 --> 01:26:48,343
How is everything here?

 849 
01:26:48,511 --> 01:26:49,307
Fine.

 850 
01:26:49,479 --> 01:26:51,140
You've been gone a while.

 851 
01:26:51,314 --> 01:26:52,781
Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.

 852 
01:26:52,949 --> 01:26:54,940
- Your wife was due?
- Yeah, a baby girl.

 853 
01:26:55,118 --> 01:26:55,846
Good!

 854 
01:26:56,018 --> 01:26:58,782
I'll be happy if she's
half as strong as you.

 855 
01:26:59,489 --> 01:27:00,547
Mrs. Wu...

 856 
01:27:01,324 --> 01:27:02,621
You're back!

 857 
01:27:02,792 --> 01:27:05,056
- How's the arm? Still sore?
- Much better.

 858 
01:27:06,162 --> 01:27:08,995
You've been gone so long.

 859 
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:12,360
Li Mu Bai is coming
to stay the night.

 860 
01:27:13,569 --> 01:27:15,503
I'll go and make up his room!

 861 
01:27:45,701 --> 01:27:47,032
Sister Shu Lien...

 862 
01:27:53,709 --> 01:27:56,371
Here you must be
in proper attire.

 863 
01:27:57,079 --> 01:28:01,072
I'm just borrowing some
clean clothes. I'm not staying.

 864 
01:28:02,351 --> 01:28:05,411
I'll give them to you.

 865 
01:28:06,856 --> 01:28:09,984
I was just passing by
and wondered how you were.

 866 
01:28:10,059 --> 01:28:12,994
You, sister...

 867 
01:28:17,567 --> 01:28:19,091
Look at the trouble
you've caused.

 868 
01:28:19,268 --> 01:28:22,032
Now you know what
Giang Hu life is really like.

 869 
01:28:22,138 --> 01:28:24,936
If you think of me
as your sister...

 870 
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:28,674
let me give you
some sisterly advice.

 871 
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:31,905
You can run from marriage,
but not your parents.

 872 
01:28:33,015 --> 01:28:34,573
They forced me to marry!

 873 
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:38,616
Go back to them first.

 874 
01:28:38,788 --> 01:28:41,188
Then you can decide about Lo.

 875 
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,022
You know about Lo?

 876 
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:54,898
He really loves you.

 877 
01:28:55,605 --> 01:28:59,632
Come back to Peking with me.
We'll find a solution.

 878 
01:29:03,813 --> 01:29:05,144
Where is he now?

 879 
01:29:05,481 --> 01:29:07,312
Li Mu Bai
has made arrangements.

 880 
01:29:11,153 --> 01:29:13,144
He sent him
to Wudan Mountain.

 881 
01:29:14,056 --> 01:29:16,923
You're working together
to set me up! I'm leaving!

 882 
01:29:17,159 --> 01:29:19,491
How dare you accuse us!

 883 
01:29:19,662 --> 01:29:21,960
I always knew
you had stolen the sword!

 884 
01:29:22,131 --> 01:29:24,599
I've done nothing
but protect you and your family.

 885 
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:27,134
And you've repaid me
with nothing but contempt.

 886 
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:30,330
Li Mu Bai himself spared you,
and all you do is insult him.

 887 
01:29:30,406 --> 01:29:33,603
We wanted some peace
and you've ruined it all!

 888 
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:35,734
You're no sister of mine!

 889 
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:39,672
What do I care?

 890 
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:42,680
You were never a real friend
anyway.

 891 
01:29:43,085 --> 01:29:44,780
But I wonder...

 892 
01:29:44,887 --> 01:29:47,082
how long could you last
as my enemy?

 893 
01:29:49,492 --> 01:29:50,618
Put the sword down!

 894 
01:30:02,038 --> 01:30:02,834
Jen!

 895 
01:30:06,509 --> 01:30:08,704
Everyone out. Shut the doors.

 896 
01:30:19,822 --> 01:30:22,620
Fine... the friendship is over.

 897 
01:33:36,218 --> 01:33:37,685
Don't touch it!

 898 
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:39,716
That's Li Mu Bai's sword.

 899 
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:43,284
Come and get it if you can.

 900 
01:33:43,859 --> 01:33:45,918
Without the Green Destiny,
you are nothing.

 901 
01:33:47,696 --> 01:33:49,596
Don't be a sore loser.

 902 
01:33:54,069 --> 01:33:56,333
Go ahead. Take your pick.

 903 
01:33:57,072 --> 01:33:58,266
I'll wait.

 904 
01:34:00,743 --> 01:34:02,005
Go ahead.

 905 
01:34:56,899 --> 01:34:58,264
Give me the sword.

 906 
01:35:00,736 --> 01:35:01,430
Take it!

 907 
01:35:06,542 --> 01:35:07,338
Stop it!

 908 
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:12,971
You don't deserve
the Green Destiny.

 909 
01:35:13,148 --> 01:35:14,638
Not another lecture!

 910 
01:35:14,817 --> 01:35:15,647
On guard!

 911 
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:18,852
Let's end this here.

 912 
01:35:19,255 --> 01:35:21,018
Only the sword will settle this.

 913 
01:35:57,326 --> 01:36:01,456
I only let you go because
I wanted to see the real you.

 914 
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:10,662
What do you know
about a true heart?

 915 
01:37:52,474 --> 01:37:53,805
What do you want?

 916 
01:37:54,276 --> 01:37:56,506
What I've always wanted,
to teach you.

 917 
01:38:30,012 --> 01:38:31,036
All right.

 918 
01:38:31,713 --> 01:38:34,307
If you can take back the sword
in three moves...

 919 
01:38:34,483 --> 01:38:35,882
I'll go with you.

 920 
01:38:40,656 --> 01:38:41,350
Give it back!

 921 
01:38:41,523 --> 01:38:43,491
- Kneel!
- Never!

 922 
01:38:43,659 --> 01:38:46,025
Then you have no use
for the sword.

 923 
01:40:00,402 --> 01:40:03,371
Sooner or later
they'd drag you back to Peking.

 924 
01:40:04,139 --> 01:40:07,540
Your parents
will never accept you again.

 925 
01:40:10,979 --> 01:40:12,071
But why go home?

 926 
01:40:12,981 --> 01:40:16,041
We've gone this far,
we won't stop now.

 927 
01:40:16,218 --> 01:40:18,618
You'll always be my Lady.

 928 
01:40:21,423 --> 01:40:24,256
At last, we'll be our own masters.

 929 
01:40:25,327 --> 01:40:28,558
We'll be happy.
That's the most important thing.

 930 
01:40:28,730 --> 01:40:31,096
All we have left is each other,
right?

 931 
01:40:36,438 --> 01:40:37,928
Lie down and rest.

 932 
01:41:01,296 --> 01:41:03,958
She's crazy.
You should have killed her.

 933 
01:41:04,132 --> 01:41:05,997
I didn't have the heart.

 934 
01:41:06,501 --> 01:41:09,026
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

 935 
01:42:19,641 --> 01:42:22,007
Is it me
or the sword you want?

 936 
01:42:42,064 --> 01:42:43,827
You've been drugged.

 937 
01:43:01,917 --> 01:43:03,680
Where is Jade Fox?

 938 
01:43:46,261 --> 01:43:47,387
What happened?

 939 
01:43:48,630 --> 01:43:51,155
Jade Fox drugged her.

 940 
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:52,800
How did you get here?

 941 
01:43:55,237 --> 01:43:57,501
We followed Jade Fox.

 942 
01:44:27,502 --> 01:44:29,936
And so you die.

 943 
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:33,201
And so shall you!

 944 
01:44:41,683 --> 01:44:43,344
A poisoned needle!

 945 
01:44:47,322 --> 01:44:49,517
You deserve to die...

 946 
01:44:50,525 --> 01:44:53,119
but the life
I was hoping to take...

 947 
01:44:53,195 --> 01:44:55,527
was Jen's.

 948 
01:44:57,265 --> 01:44:59,495
Ten years I devoted to you.

 949 
01:44:59,901 --> 01:45:01,391
But you deceived me!

 950 
01:45:03,004 --> 01:45:05,302
You hid
the manual's true meaning.

 951 
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:07,469
I never improved...

 952 
01:45:07,943 --> 01:45:12,642
but your progress was limitless!

 953 
01:45:13,882 --> 01:45:15,474
You know what poison is?

 954 
01:45:16,751 --> 01:45:18,082
An eight-year-old girl...

 955 
01:45:18,253 --> 01:45:21,381
full of deceit.
That's poison!

 956 
01:45:25,694 --> 01:45:26,752
Jen!

 957 
01:45:28,563 --> 01:45:30,690
My only family...

 958 
01:45:31,499 --> 01:45:33,831
my only enemy...

 959 
01:45:42,611 --> 01:45:43,771
You can't die!

 960 
01:45:43,845 --> 01:45:46,370
Tell us what poison you used!

 961 
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:49,683
You can't die!

 962 
01:45:49,784 --> 01:45:50,978
Tell us the antidote!

 963 
01:45:51,086 --> 01:45:53,782
You can't let Li Mu Bai die!

 964 
01:45:53,955 --> 01:45:55,752
She used Purple Yin...

 965 
01:45:57,125 --> 01:45:58,854
Purple Yin poison.

 966 
01:45:59,027 --> 01:46:00,619
It goes straight to the heart.

 967 
01:46:03,265 --> 01:46:07,258
It's the same poison she used
to kill my master.

 968 
01:46:08,803 --> 01:46:12,261
My blood
will soon reverse its flow.

 969 
01:46:13,308 --> 01:46:15,037
There is no antidote.

 970 
01:46:15,810 --> 01:46:19,302
That can't be!
Everything has an antithesis!

 971 
01:46:19,481 --> 01:46:21,608
Why not this?

 972 
01:46:21,850 --> 01:46:23,044
The antidote exists.

 973 
01:46:23,518 --> 01:46:25,713
She taught it to me.

 974 
01:46:26,121 --> 01:46:28,453
The formula is simple...

 975 
01:46:28,623 --> 01:46:30,784
but it takes time to prepare.

 976 
01:46:36,765 --> 01:46:37,732
Trust me.

 977 
01:46:39,067 --> 01:46:40,898
As you have helped me...

 978 
01:46:41,069 --> 01:46:42,900
let me help him.

 979 
01:46:44,806 --> 01:46:45,738
All right.

 980 
01:46:45,907 --> 01:46:49,638
Hurry.
I will hold on as long as I can.

 981 
01:46:49,811 --> 01:46:52,211
Take my horse
and go to the compound.

 982 
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:55,144
Give this to Mrs. Wu.
She'll help you. Hurry!

 983 
01:46:55,317 --> 01:46:58,286
Spare your energy.
I'll be back!

 984 
01:47:28,316 --> 01:47:29,408
Where is Mrs. Wu?

 985 
01:47:31,019 --> 01:47:32,008
Stop it!

 986 
01:47:33,421 --> 01:47:36,413
Shu Lien
told me to show you this.

 987 
01:47:37,492 --> 01:47:38,925
Let her in.

 988 
01:47:53,041 --> 01:47:55,669
Mu Bai, hold on.

 989 
01:47:59,781 --> 01:48:01,976
Give me some hope.

 990 
01:48:26,574 --> 01:48:27,700
Shu Lien...

 991 
01:48:29,444 --> 01:48:31,139
Save your strength.

 992 
01:48:33,615 --> 01:48:36,083
My life is departing.

 993 
01:48:37,285 --> 01:48:39,446
I've only one breath left.

 994 
01:48:41,956 --> 01:48:44,390
Use it to meditate.

 995 
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:47,494
Free yourself from this world...

 996 
01:48:47,729 --> 01:48:50,323
as you have been taught.

 997 
01:48:50,965 --> 01:48:52,830
Let your soul rise to eternity...

 998 
01:48:52,967 --> 01:48:55,765
with your last breath.

 999 
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:59,201
Do not waste it...

 1000 
01:48:59,307 --> 01:49:01,172
for me.

 1001 
01:49:03,912 --> 01:49:06,107
I've already wasted
my whole life.

 1002 
01:49:07,949 --> 01:49:10,747
I want to tell you
with my last breath...

 1003 
01:49:12,654 --> 01:49:15,122
I have always loved you.

 1004 
01:49:50,725 --> 01:49:55,059
I would rather be a ghost,
drifting by your side...

 1005 
01:49:56,097 --> 01:49:58,224
as a condemned soul...

 1006 
01:50:00,702 --> 01:50:04,536
than enter heaven without you.

 1007 
01:50:06,508 --> 01:50:08,305
Because of your love...

 1008 
01:50:11,412 --> 01:50:15,508
I will never be a lonely spirit.

 1009 
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:12,906
He's gone?

 1010 
01:51:42,170 --> 01:51:43,296
Bo...

 1011 
01:51:44,272 --> 01:51:47,400
please take this sword
back to Sir Te.

 1012 
01:51:54,048 --> 01:51:56,516
Now you must go
to Wudan Mountain.

 1013 
01:51:56,651 --> 01:51:58,642
Lo awaits you there.

 1014 
01:52:00,021 --> 01:52:01,750
Promise me one thing.

 1015 
01:52:01,956 --> 01:52:05,084
Whatever path
you take in this life...

 1016 
01:52:05,293 --> 01:52:07,625
be true to yourself.

 1017 
01:54:01,642 --> 01:54:04,634
Do you remember the legend
of the young man?

 1018 
01:54:06,681 --> 01:54:09,616
''A faithful heart
makes wishes come true.''

 1019 
01:54:15,790 --> 01:54:17,781
Make a wish, Lo.

 1020 
01:54:20,361 --> 01:54:23,159
To be back in the desert,
together again.
