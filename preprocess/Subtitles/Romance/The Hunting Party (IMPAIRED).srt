00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:39,525
- Yes, sir. It will be done.
- Good.

160
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:40,830
- Watch the land mine.
- What?

161
00:09:40,905 --> 00:09:42,873
Okay, really, this isn't funny.

First overseas assignment

163
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:45,803

you seem to know very little about,

165
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,368
could be pretty damn funny.

166
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:50,674
Yeah, Franklin and my father

167
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:52,739
thought this would be a good
first foreign assignment for me.

168
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:54,579
You know, get my feet wet.

169
00:09:54,652 --> 00:09:57,087
And whose kid are you again?

170
00:09:57,154 --> 00:09:58,815
The network vice-president's.

171
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:01,985
- Oh.
- Yeah.

172
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,424
I'm trying to read everything I can,

173
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:05,291
but this war was complicated as all hell.

174
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,091
It was hell.

175
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:09,223
Ain't nothing complicated about that.

Duck!

00:10:58,016 --> 00:11:00,281
He has actually graced us with his presence.

186
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:02,013
And his expense account.
Drinks on the network.

187
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:04,521
No, it's not.
Don't listen to anything he says.

Hey, man.

189
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:07,148
Back in the trenches
with the commoners, huh?

- Good to see you, man.

- You look like shit, mate.
- So does your mama.

It's all that money and pussy.
It's fucking destroyed him.

00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,507
- And she's a virgin.

We gonna get her fucked up!

Your first time,
and you're traveling with Duck?

00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:32,441
I hope you brought your flak jacket.

202
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:34,383
Last newbie who traveled with him
lost one of his balls.

203
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:35,579
It's true.

204
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:37,419
That's why they sent the Duck
back to New York.

205
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,082
He attracts mortar fire like shit attracts flies.

- Jubilee.

[Duck]
It's good to see you.

208
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:48,067
It's insane. NATO has 20,000
peace-keeping troops

209
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:50,069
in a country half the size of Kentucky,

210
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:52,127
and they can't find
any of these fucking war criminals.

211
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:54,638
There's no way this country is going
to get its economy back up

212
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:56,766
until it starts catching
some of these assholes.

213
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,504
Until they catch the Fox.

00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:12,152
It never gets old.

00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:13,283

Doctor Dragoslav Boghanovic,
the Fox,

224
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:23,597
is the most wanted war criminal in Bosnia.

225
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,831
During the war,
he ordered the rape and murder

226
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:29,069
of thousands of innocent Muslims.

227
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,647
There's a $5 million bounty
on his little arrogant head.

228
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,676
Oh.

229
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,048
Yeah.

230
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:42,112
You got everyone from the UN,

231
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:44,556
CIA, and NATO,

232
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:46,956
and every bounty hunter
from here to Chuck Norris

233

some slivovice quick.

236
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:54,960
It's brandy.

237
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,832
Yeah? How good?

238
00:12:56,904 --> 00:12:59,167
Let's put it this way.
There's an old Bosnian saying

239
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,470
that when a bottle of this stuff
is on the table,

240
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,375
the devil's sitting in the corner laughing.

You know what I was just thinking of?

242
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,013
If every day is a holiday
at the Holiday Inn...

243
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:14,076
- That's not your room.
- I know.

244
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:16,180
Then what do they do...

245
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:18,919
What do they do about Christmas time?

246
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:20,790
Look, man,
if I don't see you at breakfast,

247
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:22,489
I'm going to have NATO send a task force

248
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:23,689
to search for you.

249
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:25,699
Okay.

250
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:27,667
Good night, Duck.

251
00:13:27,736 --> 00:13:28,964

00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:31,264
Oh, God.

00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,568
Oh, God.

00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:56,228
How the hell are you?

260
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:00,667
Get over here.

261
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:04,002
Been good.

262
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,506
Been good.
Been around.

263
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:08,873
Amazing how many
crappy wars you'll find

264
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:11,037
if you go looking for 'em.

265
00:14:11,113 --> 00:14:14,514
- But you're okay?
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.

266
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,107
I've been getting through.

267
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:21,583
I hope you don't mind.
I raided your honor bar over there.

268
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:24,990
Purloined a few
of your little bottles of vodka.

269
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,652
So what else is new?

270
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:30,027
I watched you guys today
doing your report up on a bridge.

271
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:32,090
Franklin's not looking half bad.

272
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,193
He have some work done?

273
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:37,170
- Eyelift.
- Oh.

274
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,208
- But you were watching us, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

275
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:41,800
Yeah, I was...

276
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:44,335
I was hoping maybe I could convince you

277
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:47,406
to shoot my stand-up report
tomorrow at the ceremony.

278
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:49,747
You know, old times' sake.

279
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:52,287
Yeah, sure.

280
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:54,050
You know,
I could save a little money

281
00:14:54,123 --> 00:14:58,116
if I didn't have to hire
a cameraman, so...

282
00:14:58,194 --> 00:15:02,358
I'm going to sell it
to the Germans or Jamaicans.

283
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,200
Yeah.

284
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:18,038
Fuck, Simon.

285
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,479
You know, I meant to try
and track you down.

286
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:26,952
Don't worry about it.

287
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:36,157
Don't worry, Duck.

288
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:47,141
I heard rumors.

289
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,611
They're all true.

290
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:56,246
I got something, Duck.

291
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:00,146
Not just the anniversary,
I got a real story.

292
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,454
Something that could put me
right back on the map.

293
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:07,628
I thought you might be interested. Huh?

294
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:16,771
It's not like I don't want to.

295
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,864
I just...

296
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,640
You know, I'd do anything for you.

297
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:24,204
But I'm meeting this girl in Greece
the day after tomorrow,

298
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:27,774
and it's just not something
I can cancel, you know?

299
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,217
Just shitty timing.

300
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:33,417
I got this three-week vacation and all.

301
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:36,118
Look, but I'll still do
your stand-up tomorrow.

302
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:38,719
Look, l... I got to get out of here.

303
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:41,191
What, already?

304
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:43,761
Simon!

305
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,804

The white doves released
to denote peace around the world.

00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:06,720
Peace especially in Sarajevo

00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,302
You look good.

00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,774
Very taut.

315
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,606
Duck said you were coming by here.

316
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,945
That's fine with me
if you wanna piggyback with us.

317
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,509
- I got no hard feelings.
- Oh, thank you.

318
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,555
Thank you, Franklin.
Magnanimous as always.

319
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,853
I promise I won't try to steal Duckie back.

320
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,122
Oh, you can't afford him.
Hell, I could hardly afford him.

00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,596
Benjamin, meet Simon Hunt,
a former star with our network.

322
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,997
Simon, Benjamin Strauss.

323
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,094
Benjamin, you look young enough
to be someone important's son.

324
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,969
Yeah. The network vice-president's.

325
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,943
You know, I thought you were dead, too.

326
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,999
[Duck laughs]

327
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,546
What?

328
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,707
[Franklin]
Simon used to be our best correspondent

329
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:07,242
till he flamed out on national television.

330
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,446
Yeah. No, I remember.

331
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,048
I mean, we studied it
in journalism school.

332
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:22,562
Reporting from
the five-year anniversary ceremony

333
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:26,595
for Jamaican television,
this is Simon Hunt in Sarajevo.

334
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,335
Reporting for Peruvian state television,

335
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:35,074
I'm Simon Hunt in Sarajevo.

336
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:38,879
Reporting for
the Polish television news network,

337
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,216
I'm Simon Hunt in Sarajevo.

338
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,416
I hope one of these bastards buys this.

339
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,516
Hope so.

340
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:49,585
Check the atlas.
I don't think you got any countries left.

341
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,324
Yeah, well,

342
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,956
considering what I got up my sleeve,

343
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,398
it won't matter much.

344
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:03,508
Hey, get this back to the hotel.
I'll meet you there later.

345
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:06,468
All right, daddy, what's the story?

346
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,714
[Simon]
You make the call?

347
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:11,911
[Duck]
What call?

348
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,454
To your little Greek souvlaki.

349
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,622
'Cause this story's too big to waste

350
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:22,459
if you're just going to get on a plane
like Facelift Franklin.

351
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:29,635
You're getting soft, Duckie.

352
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:32,469
You've gotten real soft
around the edges.

353
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,531
You're like a racehorse
that's been put out to pasture.

354
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,338
Yeah, and you can fuck off, Simon.

355
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,971
But when I know that you're ready
to do serious journalism,

356
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:42,140
instead of that anchorman fluff
they've reduced you to,

357
00:19:42,217 --> 00:19:43,478
I'll fill you in, okay?

358
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:48,046
What's the story, you motherfucker?

359
00:19:52,494 --> 00:19:53,518
It's good.

360
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:55,958
It's really good.

361
00:19:58,467 --> 00:19:59,524
What?

362
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:06,738
What?

363
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:16,717
You know the Fox?

364
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:20,454
Pompous bastard who's responsible
for all of this?

365
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:31,099
Yeah.

366
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,031
I know where he's hiding.

367
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:55,081
[Duck]
So this great source of yours
knows where he's hiding,

368
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:56,716
just like that?

369
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:57,953
Yeah. Correct.

370
00:20:58,026 --> 00:21:00,722
And we're going to find him
and score an interview.

371
00:21:00,797 --> 00:21:01,786
Correct.

372
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:03,456
Go where no bounty hunter

373
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,592
or U.S. Marine has ever gone before.

374
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:06,828
Correct.

375
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,337
You are out of your fucking mind.

376
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:19,513
Okay. What about the bodyguards
that he travels with, Simon?

377
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,140
Have you thought about that?

378
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:23,947
Yeah. Word is he's got 20
armed guards with him at all times.

379
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:25,749
Yeah? Well, I heard it's 50.

380
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:27,949
- Fifty?
- Fifty.

381
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:29,959
Maybe.

382
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:32,358
Actually, some people
believe he has none.

383
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:33,793
Stupid people.

384
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:35,229
Doesn't matter.

385
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:38,029
He's expecting NATO troops,
not two jerks in a car.

386
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:39,500
We can get right up to him.

387
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,627
I know the town.

388
00:21:40,704 --> 00:21:42,365
- I have directions.
- You got directions?

389
00:21:42,438 --> 00:21:44,998
What, somebody said
"Make a left at the first Quickie-Mart"?

390
00:21:45,075 --> 00:21:47,168
I don't think they have
Quickie-Marts in Bosnia, Duckie.

391
00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:52,372
Okay, Simon.
This great source of yours...

392
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:55,212
How do you even know
that you can trust him?

393
00:21:58,722 --> 00:21:59,950
It's real.

394
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:05,761
He says he's hiding
up in the mountains of Celibici,

395
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:08,297
right by the border of Montenegro.

396
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:10,526
You go one step over the border,
NATO can't catch you.

397
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:11,863
No, no, no.

398
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:15,427
- They've been printing that gossip...
- He's there. He's in the mountains.

399
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:17,133
He's there! He...

400
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:19,141
He's an hour and a half
up an unpaved road.

401
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:21,939
He's surrounded
by sympathetic Bosnian Serbs

402
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:24,139
who will protect him...

403
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:25,682
at all costs.

404
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:31,587
That's just fucking great.

405
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:33,452
We're leaving first thing in the morning.

406
00:22:37,594 --> 00:22:41,326
If you could see me in this bikini, Duck,
you wouldn't be doing this.

407
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,996
Come on. Come on, baby.

408
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:46,833
Look, it's... I promise it's just going
to be two more days, okay?

409
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:49,938
Oh, well, I can wait.

410
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:52,067
But I don't know for how long.

411
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:54,338
You're torturing me.

412
00:22:54,412 --> 00:22:55,777
<i>And you're torturing me.</i>

413
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:57,075
So we're even.

414
00:22:58,283 --> 00:23:01,343
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

415
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:07,685
I must be a complete fucking idiot.

416
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,785
Hey, look, I know I'm new
and green and a joke to you,

417
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:12,727
but I just graduated
from Harvard, okay?

418
00:23:12,797 --> 00:23:15,425
And I know something's up.

419
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,799
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

420
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:20,201
Oh, come on.
You and Simon, you're onto a story.

421
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:22,736
Me and Simon are just hanging out.

422
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:25,299
I saw your girlfriend when she
came by the office two weeks ago.

423
00:23:25,377 --> 00:23:26,640
She is hotter than hot.

424
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:28,805
You don't leave her in Greece to hang out.

425
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:32,783
You been listening to my conversations?

426
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:33,977
No.

427
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:35,486
No, it was, um...

428
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:37,613
No, the official term
is eavesdropping, all right?

429
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:40,146
Little shit.

430
00:23:41,994 --> 00:23:43,928
Look, I know something's up, all right?

431
00:23:43,996 --> 00:23:44,985
I want in on it.

432
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:46,530
Forget it. There's no story.

433
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,657
I went to Harvard, okay?
I know there's a story.

434
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:51,134
What is up with this Harvard shit?

435
00:23:51,203 --> 00:23:52,932
You know, I dated a girl
from Harvard once,

436
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:54,802
and she wasn't so fucking bright.

437
00:23:57,143 --> 00:23:59,635
Look, my father is a cold,
mean son of a bitch,

438
00:23:59,712 --> 00:24:01,680
and he thinks I'm soft and weak

439
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:03,578
and not quite cut out for this type of work.

440
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:05,584
And there's no way on God's green earth
I'm going to prove that to him

441
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:08,313
by letting you get
a great story without me.

442
00:24:08,388 --> 00:24:10,515
How do you know it's so great?

443
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:12,057
You're hanging out with a guy

444
00:24:12,124 --> 00:24:13,752
who had a fucking meltdown
on national television

445
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:15,226
and is a punch line in the business.

446
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:17,422
If it wasn't good, you wouldn't be doing it.

447
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:26,234
Look at you.

448
00:24:26,306 --> 00:24:28,364
Little Mike-fucking-Wallace.

449
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,538
Okay.

450
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:35,474
But Simon ain't going to like this.

451
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,213
Yeah?

452
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:40,185
Well, I ain't going to like Simon.

453
00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:50,954
[Duck]
You see, his main bodyguard

454
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,262
is this psychopathic little fuck
named Srdjan.

455
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:56,268
He had a real fondness

456
00:24:56,336 --> 00:24:59,464
for raping and mutilating
these very young Muslim girls

457
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,565
as he was ethnically cleansing the villages.

458
00:25:02,643 --> 00:25:05,805
- Jesus.
- Oh, that ain't the good part.

459
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,746
Shit, the good part,
Benjamin, is this Srdjan,

460
00:25:08,816 --> 00:25:10,874
the guy in charge of protecting the Fox,

461
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:14,682
he's got this tattoo on his forehead
that reads in Cyrillic,

462
00:25:14,755 --> 00:25:17,189
"I was dead the day I was born."

463
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,720
They teach that evil shit at Harvard?

464
00:25:23,498 --> 00:25:27,400
Now, we are headed right into the heart
of this Balkan madness,

465
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:28,958
into Serb territory.

466
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:30,560
Republica Srpska.

467
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:31,900
It's a backward land

468
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:34,771
where they will kill you
for trying to hurt Boghanovic

469
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:36,741
as easily as somebody kills a mosquito.

470
00:25:38,112 --> 00:25:39,670
The Fox is their god.

471
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:42,809
People protect their god.

472
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:47,715
Now, if you're still interested...

473
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:49,585
we leave in 20 minutes.

474
00:26:12,847 --> 00:26:15,543
Let's go find us some war criminals.

475
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,840
# 20, 24 hours ago #

476
00:26:44,913 --> 00:26:46,642
# I wanna... I wanna be #

477
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:49,115
# I wanna be sedated #

478
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:51,949
Hey, Benjamin, you know what that is
that we're passing?

479
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,285
Yeah, it looks like, uh, a ski lift.

480
00:26:54,356 --> 00:26:57,723
[Duck]
'84 Winter Olympics
was held right here in Sarajevo.

481
00:26:57,794 --> 00:27:02,356
Eight years later, the Fox used this area
as a staging ground for his snipers.

482
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,696
Won the gold medal, triple lutz.

483
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:06,428
Best all around scumbag.

484
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:09,026
Are you going to be playing that damn thing
all the way to Montenegro?

485
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:11,834
Yep. Simon never liked
my guitar playing.

486
00:27:11,908 --> 00:27:13,272
Really?

487
00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:14,810
Can't say I do, either.

488
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:17,842
So it's going to be like that, huh?

489
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:22,149
# 20, 20, 24 hours a day #

490
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:25,517
- All right. Very funny.
- # I want to play the damn thing #

491
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:28,289
[Benjamin]
So what is your master plan?

492
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:30,087
You have a contact when we get to this town?

493
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,593
Nope. Never been up there before.

494
00:27:32,663 --> 00:27:35,358
I'm just going to start knocking on doors.

495
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:38,195
[Duck]
You see that? Signs are in Cyrillic now.

496
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:41,361
We've entered Republica Srpska.

497
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:42,530
That quickly?

498
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:44,301
[Duck]
Ten minutes outside of Sarajevo,

499
00:27:44,374 --> 00:27:47,366
and we're in the land
of milk and honey and rape and pillage.

500
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,776
- Are we going to be okay here?
[Simon] - Who the hell knows?

501
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:53,613
But $5 million is $5 million,
and I'm not stopping.

502
00:27:55,218 --> 00:27:57,015
$5 million?

503
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:58,850
Reward.

504
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,047
3 is for me.

505
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:02,115
The rest is for you guys
to split as you please.

506
00:28:02,192 --> 00:28:04,284
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Reward?

507
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:06,352
You're not actually thinking
of capturing him, are you?

508
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:09,160
He may be thinking it,
but it ain't going to happen.

509
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:12,066
- Don't be so sure.
- Don't be so stupid.

510
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:15,731
After this interview's finished,
everything's in play, my friends.

511
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:17,706
Whoa. Hold on.
Duck, this is nuts.

512
00:28:17,775 --> 00:28:19,333
You're not really supporting this, are you?

513
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,173
One time in Rwanda,

514
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:24,339
Simon decided he was going
to assassinate the leader of the Hutus

515
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:25,643
and end the war.

516
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:27,513
Three days later, he was in Morocco

517
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:29,552
getting a massage
from a hooker named Gladys.

518
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,648
Simon has his whims,
but this one I am not supporting.

519
00:28:33,724 --> 00:28:35,055
This isn't a whim.

520
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,855
You know what this means to me.

521
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:39,897
Okay, we are journalists.
We can't do this.

522
00:28:39,963 --> 00:28:42,523
It's... It's unethical and... and insane.

523
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,329
It would be a pleasure
to personally catch him.

524
00:28:45,403 --> 00:28:47,597
By ourselves. By ourselves.
We don't even have any weapons.

525
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:49,663
If I gave you a gun,
would you know how to use it?

526
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:50,729
No.

527
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:52,605
Then what the fuck
are you complaining about?

528
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,114
I told you.

529
00:28:58,183 --> 00:29:01,550
The moment you start drinking
that Bosnian brandy,

530
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:04,382
the devil's sitting in the corner
just laughing.

531
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:08,389
[Gunshot]

532
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,264
[Gunshot]

533
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:49,399
[Benjamin]
Do we know any actual facts at all, guys?

534
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:50,901
<i>[Duck]
My buddy at Newsweek says</i>

535
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,665
he's so afraid of getting caught

536
00:29:52,738 --> 00:29:56,139
that he's grown his hair out
and has a full Orthodox beard.

537
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,767
Funny. 'Cause I heard
he actually shaved his head.

538
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:00,277
He's bald as a turd.

539
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,946
[Simon]
Now, what we do know is that the Fox
drives in a convoy of orange cars.

540
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:08,077
All right?
So we should keep a lookout for them.

541
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:10,349
That's funny, Simon.
I heard he's traveling around

542
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:12,447
in a stolen UN de-mining vehicle.

543
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:14,857
Well then, we should keep
an eye out for that, too.

544
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:15,916
[Benjamin]
Yeah, that's great.

545
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:18,156
There's only a thousand
UN de-mining trucks in this country.

546
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,493
Why don't we stop each one?

547
00:30:19,565 --> 00:30:22,160
"Hey, knock, knock.
Is the Fox in there? No?"

548
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:24,760
Okay, well, we should be done in,
what, say, 9 to 12 years.

549
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:27,639
One second he's pissing himself

550
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:29,572
'cause he's afraid we might
actually run into the Fox,

551
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:32,440
the next he's complaining
'cause we probably won't.

552
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:35,002
No, I'm not... I'm not complaining.

553
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,276
I'm mocking.

554
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:42,620
[Speaking Serbian]

555
00:30:42,689 --> 00:30:43,678
Wow.

556
00:30:45,258 --> 00:30:46,986
The Doctor is not bald.

557
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:52,356
He is not desperate.

558
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:54,297
And he is not in Celibici.

559
00:30:58,438 --> 00:31:01,066
He is everywhere.

560
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:03,371
He know everything.

561
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,810
He listens to everything you say.

562
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,644
And if you get close to the Fox,

563
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:11,514
if you corner him,

564
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:16,245
then even God can't help you.

565
00:31:24,197 --> 00:31:26,324
[Benjamin]
What the fuck was that about?

566
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,661
A little warning.

567
00:31:27,735 --> 00:31:29,293
Yeah? It seemed more like a threat.

568
00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:33,773
Yeah. Beware of the nosy waiter
with Serbian pride.

569
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,706
Actually, it was the first time that I thought

570
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:38,040
that maybe Simon wasn't
jerking our chain.

571
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:39,237
Yeah? Why is that?

572
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:42,475
Because the guy in there said
that he's not in Celebici,

573
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,246
which means maybe
he actually is in Celebici.

574
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:48,412
Right.
Unless he's really not in Celebici.

575
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,890
Well, that's a possibility, too.

576
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,563
- Jeez!
- Holy shit!

577
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,195
Get down!

578
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:06,295
[Gunshot]
Hold on.

579
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:21,721
What in the fuck was that about, man?

580
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,622
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

581
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:25,750
We're going to die.

582
00:32:25,827 --> 00:32:27,760
Every single person out here
knows exactly what we're doing.

583
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:29,887
Keep your panties dry, Benjamin.

584
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:32,592
- It had nothing to do with the Fox.
- What the hell do you mean?

585
00:32:32,668 --> 00:32:34,795
It's just a little local tradition
to shoot at every customer?

586
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:40,807
Wait a minute.
Is that my money?

587
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,436
You mean the money I left on the table?
That's mine?

588
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:45,912
- Simon!
- Times are tight.

589
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:48,211
- Things happen. Sue me.
- Wait, wait, wait.

590
00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:50,251
You stole the money
that was left for the bill?

591
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,254
- I needed it more.
- Okay, you got us shot at for 20 bucks.

592
00:32:53,322 --> 00:32:55,688
I didn't know he was going
to shoot at us.

593
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:03,695
Unbelievable!

594
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:09,129
Much gunplay when you and Franklin

595
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:11,832
do your stories about
the president's new tax code?

596
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,772
- Fuck off.
- Come on, Duckie.

597
00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:16,310
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

598
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:18,847
A little taste of what you left behind?

599
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:22,782
Don't say you didn't.

600
00:33:22,852 --> 00:33:27,016
<i># It's a bad situation in a beautiful place #</i>

601
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:30,924
<i># It's a bad situation in a beautiful place #</i>

602
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:36,864
<i># It's a bad situation #</i>

603
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,778
[Simon]
That pile of rubble used to be a mosque.

604
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:56,614
Now the town's
a hundred percent Bosnian Serb.

605
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:58,415
No Muslims left.

606
00:33:58,488 --> 00:34:01,458
Ethnically cleansed for your protection.

607
00:34:01,524 --> 00:34:02,822
Nice vibe, right?

608
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:07,489
[Simon]
There's a reason they say
the river runs red in Foca...

609
00:34:07,563 --> 00:34:09,759
and it ain't because of the wine.

610
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,528
[Benjamin]
What does the Cyrillic say?

611
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:14,069
It says, "Don't touch him."

612
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,779
- Wait. Where are you going?
- The police.

613
00:34:22,846 --> 00:34:24,973
Need a good laugh.

614
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:27,449
[Man]
War criminals?

615
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:29,383
Believe it or not,
we don't even have a copy

616
00:34:29,453 --> 00:34:31,353
of the complete indictment list.

617
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:33,322
[Duck] - You don't?
- No.

618
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,415
Do you have a copy?
I could always Xerox it.

619
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:38,859
Miriam, is the copier working again?

620
00:34:40,397 --> 00:34:43,924
Word has it there's a bunch of them
living right here in Foca.

621
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,697
Could be.

622
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:49,637
Unfortunately, we're here
to reform the police force,

623
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:51,231
not hunt for war criminals.

624
00:34:51,308 --> 00:34:52,741
[Duck]
But it wouldn't be much hunting.

625
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:55,301
I mean, most of them are listed
right in the phone book.

626
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:59,646
As I said, we're not authorized
to arrest war criminals.

627
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:02,652
- You are the international police, right?
- Yes.

628
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,414
Under the flag of the United Nations.

629
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:06,821
I thought the UN was looking
for war criminals.

630
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:09,552
We are. Aggressively.

631
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:12,117
There's a $5 million reward, you know?

632
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:13,925
But you said you don't have
an indictment list.

633
00:35:13,998 --> 00:35:15,522
We don't.

634
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,589
Donut?

635
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:21,061
Donut.

636
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:23,039
Flown in from Bonn.

637
00:35:23,107 --> 00:35:24,097
Very black market.

638
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:27,542
I particularly like the chocolate ones
with the rainbow sprinkles.

639
00:35:29,948 --> 00:35:33,111
You see, it's the UN that are looking
for war criminals,

640
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:35,277
not the UN police task force.

641
00:35:35,353 --> 00:35:38,016
No, not the ones
who could actually catch them.

642
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:40,785
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

643
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,055
Sounds like the usual UN jerk-off to me.

644
00:35:43,128 --> 00:35:44,289
You got any milk?

645
00:35:45,397 --> 00:35:47,364
[Duck]
Look, we're headed up to Celibici now.

646
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:50,401
We just figured we'd stop in
and register with you

647
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:53,164
just in case we got killed
or something like that.

648
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:55,605
Well, consider yourselves registered.

649
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:59,269
Miriam, uh, be a love and get me a tea.

650
00:35:59,344 --> 00:36:01,039
Four sugars.

651
00:36:01,112 --> 00:36:03,308
Oh, and a glass of milk.

652
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:06,148
[Duck]
Is there any word

653
00:36:06,218 --> 00:36:08,515
on what's going up there now?

654
00:36:08,587 --> 00:36:10,986
Well, something.

655
00:36:11,056 --> 00:36:13,650
It's third time this year
we've been ordered to stay away.

656
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:17,987
From Celibici?

657
00:36:18,797 --> 00:36:20,287
[Policeman]
Suspicious, no?

658
00:36:20,366 --> 00:36:22,231
Yeah.

659
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:24,462
Who ordered you?

660
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:26,004
UN command.

661
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:29,097
Told us to stay away
for four or five days.

662
00:36:29,175 --> 00:36:30,836
Jesus fucking Christ.

663
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,470
They tell the police
not to go up to Celebici.

664
00:36:33,546 --> 00:36:35,605
I mean, he's actually up there.
I can't fucking believe this.

665
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:37,547
Why would they tell them
not to go up there?

666
00:36:37,683 --> 00:36:39,048
Tell them not to go up there

667
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,313
because I don't want them
walking into a shootout.

668
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:43,947
Now, really...

669
00:36:44,024 --> 00:36:45,422
tell me the truth.

670
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:49,551
Who the fuck are you guys?

671
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:52,120
I told you, we are journalists.

672
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,291
Journalists?

673
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:55,162
Yeah. You have our press credentials.

674
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:56,224
Yes.

675
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:01,231
Very professionally done.

676
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,842
So, uh, you are journalists who believe

677
00:37:05,912 --> 00:37:09,439
that they can get close to someone
that no one else can.

678
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:13,111
Yeah. What's the problem?

679
00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:14,517
I understand.

680
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:15,577
I understand.

681
00:37:15,655 --> 00:37:18,089
You are journalists on a story.

682
00:37:20,026 --> 00:37:21,789
What, you think we're just posing
as journalists?

683
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:30,325
Do you like beer?
I like beer. Do you like beer?

684
00:37:30,403 --> 00:37:31,768
Let's get a beer.

685
00:37:34,909 --> 00:37:36,102
## [Singing in foreign language]

686
00:37:37,811 --> 00:37:40,440
For a group of UN guards to go,
it's too dangerous.

687
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:42,914
For you guys? Sure, why not?

688
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:44,382
Go to Celibici.

689
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:46,044
Do the world a favor.

690
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,056
I'm sorry, are you still insinuating
we're a CIA hit squad or something?

691
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:52,455
I'm sorry, are you still insinuating
you're journalists?

692
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:56,753
Look, um...

693
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,493
I know things.

694
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:02,195
I know how things operate.

695
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,794
I've been waiting for you.

696
00:38:06,741 --> 00:38:09,608
Certain things need to be taken
care of professionally, right?

697
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:11,338
- Took me months...
- Shh.

698
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:16,706
Took me months to gain the trust
of certain people

699
00:38:16,784 --> 00:38:19,048
who normally would be protecting
the Fox.

700
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:22,453
That's how I know you didn't just stumble on
the fact he's up in Celibici.

701
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:24,787
Well, it's been printed in the press.

702
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:27,692
So has the horoscopes.
Do you believe them?

703
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,891
- You're not making any sense now.
- I know.

704
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:33,160
I'm the United Nations.

705
00:38:43,312 --> 00:38:45,246
And fact is, the United Nations...

706
00:38:45,314 --> 00:38:47,544
Oh, fuck.
The French specifically,

707
00:38:47,615 --> 00:38:49,640
they have no interest
in catching the Fox.

708
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:51,845
They would be happy
if he killed all the Muslims.

709
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,320
Save them all this money and energy.

710
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:56,619
John Major and the British
backed the Fox,

711
00:38:56,691 --> 00:38:59,354
even though they would never
publicly admit it.

712
00:38:59,428 --> 00:39:02,022
And the Americans...
Yeah, they brokered the peace agreement,

713
00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:04,895
but some would suggest
they made a secret deal with the Fox

714
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:06,866
that if he stepped down from power,

715
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:09,096
they would not arrest him for war crimes.

716
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:14,407
Who knows what's true, what isn't?
The whole fucking thing is dirty.

717
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:17,206
But in dirty times...

718
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,111
dirty deeds need to be done, right?

719
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:24,678
One arm of the government said
it would do something, does nothing.

720
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:25,948
That would be us.

721
00:39:26,022 --> 00:39:27,387
The other hand...

722
00:39:27,456 --> 00:39:29,823
CIA...

723
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:31,655
whoever...

724
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:33,695
does something else.

725
00:39:33,763 --> 00:39:35,355
I mean, look at you guys.

726
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:38,524
Do you really think you're fooling anyone?

727
00:39:41,938 --> 00:39:43,963
[Duck]
He thinks we're a hit squad.

728
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,770
- He thinks we're a fucking hit squad!
[Benjamin] - Yeah, this can't be good.

729
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,641
Isn't it illegal, impersonating a CIA officer?

730
00:39:49,712 --> 00:39:51,009
[Duck]
Yeah, but we denied it.

731
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,138
[Benjamin]
Yeah, he didn't believe it.

732
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:55,013
It's true.
It's like the more we fucking denied it,

733
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:56,517
the more he didn't believe it.

734
00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:59,351
Yeah, the problem is,
if you were CIA you would deny it.

735
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:02,323
And if you weren't,
you would also deny it.

736
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:04,223
Actually he's not that far
off the mark, you know?

737
00:40:04,294 --> 00:40:05,555
I mean, we're not CIA,

738
00:40:05,629 --> 00:40:07,529
but we can do a lot more

739
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:11,227
than just interview the Fox.

740
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,893
Wait. Hold up.

741
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:15,598
- Simon.
- What?

742
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:18,765
Now, you're not still
on this capturing jag?

743
00:40:18,842 --> 00:40:21,276
It's not a jag.

744
00:40:21,344 --> 00:40:24,507
Not a jag, not a whim.
Especially now.

745
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:27,778
Especially since Boris basically confirmed
that he's hiding out up there.

746
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,113
Okay. Now, now, Simon,

747
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:31,279
I was willing to come along with you

748
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:34,324
and try to even get close enough
to this psychopathic fuck

749
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:37,326
to try and get an interview.

750
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,555
But we are not capturing him.

751
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,222
I mean, look at us.

752
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:44,095
That's not what we do.

753
00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:46,295
I'm checking into that hotel

754
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,564
down the road.

755
00:40:47,638 --> 00:40:50,300
I'm taking a shower,
a shit, and a Seconal.

756
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:51,603
Tomorrow morning I'm getting up,

757
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:53,336
I'm driving up that mountain to Celibici,

758
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,537
and I am finding the Fox.

759
00:40:55,612 --> 00:40:57,512
Now, you're welcome to join me, Duckie,

760
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,640
or you're welcome to fuck off.

761
00:40:59,716 --> 00:41:01,206
Your choice.

762
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,560
[Benjamin]
You think this is crazy too, huh?

763
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:18,032
I mean, just trying
to get an interview is crazy.

764
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,899
But we're not mercenaries.

765
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:23,600
Yeah, well, I'm supposed to be
on fucking vacation.

766
00:41:23,674 --> 00:41:25,666
And it makes sense why he had
a meltdown on air.

767
00:41:25,743 --> 00:41:26,834
He's a goddamn nut job.

768
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,910
Yeah, Simon is a goddamn nut job,

769
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:34,247
but his meltdown wasn't for nothing.

770
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,947
We'd seen some horrible stuff that day.

771
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:39,251
Yeah, reporters see horrible things
all the time.

772
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:42,921
That's what they do.

773
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,529
Yeah.

774
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,659
Look, I saw the tape, okay?
He was drunk, high.

775
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:52,635
He just fucking lost it.

776
00:41:52,705 --> 00:41:55,195
He lost it then,
and he's losing it now.

777
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:04,514
There was these two girls, right?

778
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:07,881
Named Marda and Una.

779
00:42:07,953 --> 00:42:10,887
They said they were cousins but...

780
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:13,583
We used to hang out together
from time to time.

781
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:15,889
Who the hell knows why they were there.

782
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:17,258
It was war.

783
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,320
People was broke.

784
00:42:19,397 --> 00:42:21,832
People did things.

785
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:24,096
All I know is...

786
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:26,137
we had a good time.

787
00:42:26,205 --> 00:42:28,138
They were our friends.

788
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,170
Somewhere along the line,

789
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:35,304
maybe the second
or third year into the war,

790
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:37,941
Simon and Marda,
they had a little thing.

791
00:42:41,688 --> 00:42:44,451
Hell, it was more than a little thing.

792
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:48,050
Simon, he liked her.

793
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:51,491
He did things for her.

794
00:42:51,565 --> 00:42:54,796
Whatever little money he had, he gave her.

795
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:56,425
They didn't spend that much time together.

796
00:42:56,503 --> 00:42:59,165
But it was war, how can you?

797
00:42:59,238 --> 00:43:03,972
But Simon,
in his own little crazy way,

798
00:43:04,043 --> 00:43:05,840
he loved her.

799
00:43:08,747 --> 00:43:12,047
Now, you fast-forward six months.

800
00:43:12,118 --> 00:43:15,245
Sarajevo's under siege worse than ever.

801
00:43:15,322 --> 00:43:19,155
And we haven't heard from Marda
or her cousin for months now.

802
00:43:19,225 --> 00:43:20,920
And only thing we knew

803
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:23,121
was that Marda had gone back to Polje

804
00:43:23,196 --> 00:43:24,663
to help out her mother.

805
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:30,802
And then one day we hear
about a serious incident in Polje,

806
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,930
and we go there to cover it.

807
00:43:35,176 --> 00:43:39,111
The horrors we saw.

808
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:40,806
Fucking inhuman.

809
00:43:43,183 --> 00:43:45,515
Neither Simon nor I said anything,

810
00:43:45,586 --> 00:43:47,281
you know, although we both knew

811
00:43:47,354 --> 00:43:49,755
that Marda was from this town.

812
00:43:49,824 --> 00:43:52,587
We just got ready to do our job,

813
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,218
cover our story.

814
00:43:56,897 --> 00:43:58,922

818
00:44:03,971 --> 00:44:04,960
No?

819
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:06,768
How about Aidan?

820
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:10,641
Or how about Simon Junior?

821
00:44:14,382 --> 00:44:16,543
[Duck]
And then there she was.

822
00:44:16,617 --> 00:44:19,450
Twenty minutes before
we went on the air.

823
00:44:21,956 --> 00:44:25,722
They had shot her in her stomach five times.

824
00:44:28,195 --> 00:44:32,063
So don't believe everything
that you learn in journalism school,

825
00:44:32,134 --> 00:44:35,934
'cause in war...

826
00:44:36,003 --> 00:44:37,868
what you see

827
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:39,167
and what really happened

828
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,573
are sometimes two very different things.

829
00:44:47,149 --> 00:44:49,515
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

830

Okay? Okay? Come on.

- It's all right.
- You okay?

00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:23,243
Wait! Simon, no! Wait!

- Let go!
- No! Simon! Come on!

No! No! No!

00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,821
No! Please, Simon.

840
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,289
Please.

841
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:36,348
It's okay.

[Sobbing, incoherent]

843
00:46:48,938 --> 00:46:50,463

I know.

846
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:41,957
Watch the land mines.

847
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,220
Okay, shut up.

848
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:13,919
You see that?

849
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,695
What was that? A lookout?

850
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:19,627
My God, Duck.
I think he's really up there.

851
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:22,929
They're watching every car
that goes up this mountain.

852
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:28,066
Hold on, boys.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

853
00:48:41,287 --> 00:48:42,947
Wait, hold on.

Back, back, back, back, back.

Correct.

858
00:49:52,994 --> 00:49:55,655
Where's the welcoming committee?

859
00:49:55,729 --> 00:49:59,665
Be thankful that there aren't
50 Kalashnikovs pointed at our heads.

860
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:02,224
So what are you going to do?

861
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:04,133
I'm going to do what
any good journalist would do

862
00:50:04,205 --> 00:50:05,900
when he gets to a new place.

863
00:50:05,973 --> 00:50:08,134
Yeah? What's that?

864
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:09,971
I'm going to find a bar.

865
00:50:53,054 --> 00:50:55,579
Doesn't exactly look like they get
many newcomers in here.

Just keep smiling. You'll be fine.

What did he say?

He said you're about skinny enough
to be used as bait.

- Yeah. It's a fishing joke.
- Yeah, no. I get it.

He just sold you and me out.

- Thank you, Simon.
- Great.

You're welcome.

879
00:52:23,546 --> 00:52:26,743
Do you really think we would
sell out leader of our people

880
00:52:26,816 --> 00:52:29,341
for a simple glass of cheap brandy?

881

Do you really think the people
of Republica Srpska are that weak?

and we don't like to be made fun of.

- Simon...

00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:10,588
Did you ever go hunting with him?

895
00:53:20,305 --> 00:53:25,867
I mean, uh, he got his nickname
because he loved to hunt foxes.

896
00:53:25,943 --> 00:53:27,605
You obviously love to hunt foxes.

that poke around,
seeing if one of us will talk.

You tell your friends
that we know nothing here.

909

Tell them that we lost loved ones
in the war, too.

- Shut the fuck up.

- No, nothing. Okay. Okay.

Out. Out. You, too. Out.

00:56:30,197 --> 00:56:33,290
- How are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

958
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:35,130
- We almost kill you, man.
- Yeah, no shit.

959
00:56:35,202 --> 00:56:37,170
Listen, never drive on our road.

960
00:56:37,238 --> 00:56:39,763
But if you do, call first us, okay?

961
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,467
Okay. All right. I promise. I promise.

962
00:56:45,212 --> 00:56:46,577
Laugh at all their jokes.

963
00:56:46,647 --> 00:56:48,478
Whatever you do, don't stare at the midget.

964
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:49,642
What midget?

965
00:56:49,717 --> 00:56:51,480
They're black marketeers.

966
00:56:51,552 --> 00:56:54,851
- They run stuff that comes in through Croatia.
- Okay.

967
00:56:54,922 --> 00:56:57,186
- Simon!
- Sascha!

968
00:56:57,259 --> 00:57:00,694
- Oh, shit, I'm staring at the midget.
- Well, stop.

969
00:57:06,902 --> 00:57:09,199
Where the fuck my money?

970
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:11,933
Beautiful guitar, it's yours.
Go ahead.

971
00:57:12,006 --> 00:57:14,134
[Sascha speaking Serbian]

972
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,369
Un-fucking-believable.

973
00:57:16,444 --> 00:57:18,208
Yeah, it's, like, twice his size.

974
00:57:21,082 --> 00:57:23,346
Fucking greedy midget.

975
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,846
What?

976
00:57:28,957 --> 00:57:30,356
I'll pay you back.

977
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:32,393
I'll pay you both back.

978
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:42,599
<i>## [rap]</i>

979
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,706
<i>- Duck?
- Hey, baby.</i>

980
00:57:46,775 --> 00:57:48,208
Wait, I can hardly hear you.

981
00:57:48,277 --> 00:57:51,178
Costas, can you turn down
the stereo, please?

982
00:57:51,246 --> 00:57:53,373
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm fine.</i>

983
00:57:53,448 --> 00:57:56,042
No. Baby, I said where are you?

984
00:57:56,118 --> 00:57:59,918
<i>Oh, oh, yeah. I'm on Gaspar's boat.</i>

985
00:57:59,988 --> 00:58:01,080
Who is Gaspar?

986
00:58:01,157 --> 00:58:03,989
Costas and Lola's friend.
No, no more champagne.

987
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,995
No, talk to me!
Who is Costas and Lola?

988
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:09,793
Look baby, I can hardly hear you.

989
00:58:09,866 --> 00:58:11,094
The connection's horrible.

990
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:12,327
When are you coming?

991
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,425
<i>I'm going to be there tomorrow morning.</i>

992
00:58:14,504 --> 00:58:15,562
First flight out.

993
00:58:15,637 --> 00:58:17,538
<i>Okay. But you better hurryl</i>

994
00:58:17,607 --> 00:58:19,438
Georgio, no! I'm ticklish!

995
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:22,307
Wait a minute! Who is Georgio?

996
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:26,007
<i>- You can't slap my butt like that.
- What? Nol Put Georgio on the phonel</i>

997
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:27,913
<i>I want to talk to Georgiol</i>

998
00:58:27,984 --> 00:58:30,214
Hello?

999
00:58:46,836 --> 00:58:48,827
Oh, my God.

1000
00:58:55,879 --> 00:58:58,109
So you ran into the midget.

1001
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,342
It's better than running over the midget.

1002
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:01,747
And how'd you know?

1003
00:59:01,818 --> 00:59:03,718
Look. We cannot talk here.

1004
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:06,778
I didn't know we were talking.

1005
00:59:06,857 --> 00:59:08,188
We're not talking.

1006
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:09,850
Well, it looks like we're talking.

1007
00:59:09,926 --> 00:59:13,828
Visegrad. Dobran Tunnel,
tonight at 9.

1008
00:59:13,897 --> 00:59:15,159
Things are heating up.

1009
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:43,883
Why do you keep breaking into my room?

1010
00:59:43,962 --> 00:59:46,122
[Simon]
Look, I'm between places right now.

1011
00:59:46,197 --> 00:59:47,356
I needed a bath.

1012
01:00:01,245 --> 01:00:03,873
So what the hell are you going to do, Simon?

1013
01:00:05,216 --> 01:00:07,047
You're broke.

1014
01:00:07,118 --> 01:00:08,312
You owe midgets.

1015
01:00:12,824 --> 01:00:14,724
I dream about him, Duck.

1016
01:00:14,792 --> 01:00:16,487
I dream about catching him.

1017
01:00:20,565 --> 01:00:23,193
Wiping that arrogant smile off his face.

1018
01:00:24,802 --> 01:00:26,326
My whole fucking situation,

1019
01:00:26,404 --> 01:00:29,464
every bad thing that's ever happened
to me, stems from that bastard.

1020
01:00:32,777 --> 01:00:34,608
I was flying high before that war.

1021
01:00:36,681 --> 01:00:38,148
I know.

1022
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:43,044
We were a fucking great team.

1023
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:45,248
The best.

1024
01:00:56,502 --> 01:00:58,332
And then it all went to shit.

1025
01:01:00,606 --> 01:01:04,406
Finding him would've been
so fucking brilliant.

1026
01:01:07,112 --> 01:01:10,741
Maybe you should call your source again.

1027
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,949
What?

1028
01:01:18,891 --> 01:01:20,119
What?

1029
01:01:20,192 --> 01:01:21,716
There is no source.

1030
01:01:21,794 --> 01:01:24,558
I made up the whole story.

1031
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:26,895
You are un-fucking-believable.

1032
01:01:26,965 --> 01:01:29,366
I heard rumors that
the Fox was up in Celebici.

1033
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:33,303
I thought if I had a source,
it'd push you over to joining me, so...

1034
01:01:33,373 --> 01:01:36,102
You know, I must be a fucking idiot.

1035
01:01:36,176 --> 01:01:37,837
No, I'm an asshole.

1036
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:41,005
No, all this time, you've been
making fun of my life in New York.

1037
01:01:41,081 --> 01:01:44,278
Joking about how
I'm not the man that I used to be?

1038
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:48,150
Let me share something with you, Simon.
You're not the man you used to be, either.

1039
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,586
You are far fucking from it.

1040
01:01:53,059 --> 01:01:55,892
Dry your dick off
and get the fuck outta my room.

1041
01:01:57,864 --> 01:01:59,161
Lady, do you...

1042
01:01:59,232 --> 01:02:00,893
Look, I'm just trying to change my...

1043
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,901
[speaking Serbian]

1044
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:08,536
Hello? Hello?

1045
01:02:09,844 --> 01:02:11,811
Yes, I made it up.

1046
01:02:11,878 --> 01:02:14,472
- Shit, Simon.
- We weren't wrong, you know?

1047
01:02:14,548 --> 01:02:16,742
Boris, the UN guy, he thought
we were right on his trail.

1048
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:20,013
- Yeah, well, he still does.
- What do you mean?

1049
01:02:20,086 --> 01:02:21,611
I just saw him in the lobby,

1050
01:02:21,688 --> 01:02:24,852
and he wants to meet
his favorite CIA hit squad

1051
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:27,051
at that burnt-out tunnel in Visegrad tonight.

1052
01:02:27,127 --> 01:02:29,721
- He said, "Things are heating up."
- He did?

1053
01:02:29,797 --> 01:02:31,992
Yes. The whole damn thing
is fucking ridiculous.

1054
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:35,228
Why the hell didn't you tell me?
We got to get going!

1055
01:02:48,716 --> 01:02:51,150
So at what point do we get
jumped and killed?

1056
01:03:12,174 --> 01:03:13,971
I'm not doing what I'm doing.

1057
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,236
I mean, clearly I'm doing this,
but I'm not doing this,

1058
01:03:16,311 --> 01:03:19,609
because if I was doing this, I could
get into a lot of trouble for doing it.

1059
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:22,644
What the fuck, Boris?

1060
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:24,378
Yeah.

1061
01:03:31,526 --> 01:03:33,687
She might seem
young and beautiful to you,

1062
01:03:33,762 --> 01:03:36,663
but she would cut your balls off
and sell them as trinkets

1063
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:39,700
if she thinks you're fucking
with her. Okay?

1064
01:03:40,702 --> 01:03:42,101
Boris?

1065
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,867
Who are you talking about?

1066
01:03:46,941 --> 01:03:49,843
The person I spoke to about your mission.

1067
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:51,003
Mirjana.

1068
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:54,378
She is going to lead you to the Fox.

1069
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,041
Come.

1070
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:29,147
Sit down.

1071
01:04:39,762 --> 01:04:41,059
Sit.

1072
01:04:56,045 --> 01:04:58,913
I'm no friend of the Muslims.

1073
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:02,042
Right at the start of the war,
they got some girls from my school.

1074
01:05:02,118 --> 01:05:04,610
Look, it was shitty on all sides, okay?

1075
01:05:06,022 --> 01:05:09,857
You don't know shitty until you've been
gang-raped for seven hours.

1076
01:05:15,765 --> 01:05:19,827
- Where's Boris?
- This is not about justice.

1077
01:05:19,902 --> 01:05:22,370
I am and always will be a proud Serb.

1078
01:05:22,439 --> 01:05:23,804
This is about money.

1079
01:05:23,874 --> 01:05:27,969
My father had a system.
Made us money.

1080
01:05:28,045 --> 01:05:30,411
Then Boghanovic's men took over.

1081
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,471
Wanted what we had.

1082
01:05:33,617 --> 01:05:37,212
Now they run the petrol and cigarettes
coming in from Serbia.

1083
01:05:37,287 --> 01:05:40,654
Use that money to protect him.

1084
01:05:40,724 --> 01:05:44,717
But they killed my father.

1085
01:05:44,795 --> 01:05:46,490
And now we have nothing.

1086
01:05:48,632 --> 01:05:50,725
I hate nothing.

1087
01:05:50,802 --> 01:05:53,634
You stop them,
I get my family business back.

1088
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:55,365
What do we get?

1089
01:05:55,439 --> 01:05:58,534
What you came to Bosnia to get.

1090
01:06:02,946 --> 01:06:05,005
And how do we do that?

1091
01:06:05,082 --> 01:06:09,315
My old boyfriend, he is one of his guards.

1092
01:06:09,387 --> 01:06:11,446
Midac.

1093
01:06:11,522 --> 01:06:15,014
He is in love with me, calls me every day.

1094
01:06:15,093 --> 01:06:18,221
I have no interest in him anymore,
but I still talk to him

1095
01:06:18,296 --> 01:06:21,197
because I know one day
the CIA will come to my home.

1096
01:06:24,936 --> 01:06:27,200
- How many guards?
- Ten.

1097
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,604
- We're just three.
- Three of you is thirty of them.

1098
01:06:31,676 --> 01:06:35,578
They are fat and lazy and bored
out of their minds in the countryside.

1099
01:06:35,646 --> 01:06:37,581
And you know exactly where he is?

1100
01:06:37,648 --> 01:06:40,709
I can.

1101
01:06:40,785 --> 01:06:43,516
Now you give me thousand marks.

1102
01:06:43,588 --> 01:06:46,887
A thou... Are you out or your fucking mind?

1103
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:48,790
No. I want goodwill gesture.

1104
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:51,227
My goodwill has disappeared, lady.

1105
01:06:52,364 --> 01:06:55,595
I risk everything talking to you.

1106
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:57,760
We just can't.

1107
01:06:58,771 --> 01:07:01,261
I need assurance
you don't take advantage of me.

1108
01:07:08,847 --> 01:07:11,576
If you guys are not serious, forget it.

1109
01:07:16,455 --> 01:07:18,480
The Agency has strict rules.

1110
01:07:19,892 --> 01:07:21,382
We're not authorized for payments.

1111
01:07:26,465 --> 01:07:29,662
Others in the company are, but not us.

1112
01:07:29,735 --> 01:07:31,999
Weaker divisions are.
Smaller divisions.

1113
01:07:33,138 --> 01:07:35,368
You know what we do.

1114
01:07:36,608 --> 01:07:38,473
You know who we are.

in achieving our goals around the world.

Now, you're worried about others killing you,

1119

but what you should most be worried about
are the three people in this room

that they bring with them.

01:19:51,089 --> 01:19:52,148
He was there!

1272
01:19:52,224 --> 01:19:54,988
We saved your life.
That was our mission.

1273
01:19:55,061 --> 01:19:57,085
You cut it pretty close, don't you think?

1274
01:19:57,162 --> 01:20:01,099
We did our job. Now you guys
got to get the hell out of this country.

1275
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:05,193
No. No, I think there's a pretty good story
to tell inside this country.

1276
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:09,229
I was nose-to-nose with the most wanted
fugitive in the world.

1277
01:20:12,945 --> 01:20:15,175
Let me tell you something, Mr. Cunt.

1278
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:18,778
- Hunt.
- Mr. Hunt.

1279
01:20:18,851 --> 01:20:21,445
You're lucky I haven't already
arrested your sorry ass

1280
01:20:21,521 --> 01:20:24,957
and thrown you in a dark fucking hole
with no fucking exits.

1281
01:20:25,023 --> 01:20:26,514
Arrested for what?

1282
01:20:26,592 --> 01:20:29,390
Lmpersonating a CIA officer
is a serious offense.

1283
01:20:29,462 --> 01:20:33,899
Jesus fuck.
We never impersonated anyone.

1284
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:38,961
Your friend Boris is on a plane for Uganda
where he will now be stationed.

1285
01:20:39,038 --> 01:20:41,632
But before he was suddenly
transferred to darkest Africa

1286
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:43,403
to never be heard from again,

1287
01:20:43,476 --> 01:20:46,502
we confronted him
about your little representation.

1288
01:20:49,415 --> 01:20:51,246
If I ever hear from you again,

1289
01:20:51,317 --> 01:20:55,254
the CIA will be on you like a cheap suit
from the Men's Wearhouse.

1290
01:20:55,321 --> 01:20:57,881
You'll be arrested, jailed,

1291
01:20:57,958 --> 01:21:01,916
and sodomized by a big, dumb,
large-cocked Serbian bastard

1292
01:21:01,996 --> 01:21:04,464
for the rest of your shitty little lives.

1293
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:07,932
And if you don't care about that,
if you like big Serbian cock,

1294
01:21:08,002 --> 01:21:10,196
and you still plan
on reporting any of this,

1295
01:21:10,271 --> 01:21:12,831
then your friend Boris
will find himself eaten

1296
01:21:12,906 --> 01:21:16,603
by a tiger or lion or a squirrel

1297
01:21:16,677 --> 01:21:20,168
or whatever fucking animal
we can find in darkest Africa.

1298
01:21:20,247 --> 01:21:22,044
And you'll have to live with that.

1299
01:21:22,116 --> 01:21:24,949
I assume that I can quote you
on the squirrel remark.

1300
01:21:28,055 --> 01:21:30,455
Look, Cunt.

1301
01:21:30,524 --> 01:21:33,823
The CIA has a bright side,
the CIA has a dark side,

1302
01:21:33,894 --> 01:21:36,055
and then there's the gray side.

1303
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:38,894
We do the things that people
don't need to know about.

1304
01:21:38,966 --> 01:21:41,332
It's a part we deny even exists.

1305
01:21:41,402 --> 01:21:46,272
It's a part of the CIA that's been working for
the last three weeks in Bosnia on the Fox.

1306
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,934
And what have you been working on doing,
letting him disappear?

1307
01:21:49,978 --> 01:21:51,878
Let me ask you a question.

1308
01:21:51,946 --> 01:21:55,404
Why do you think the CIA
would want to let a war criminal go?

1309
01:21:55,482 --> 01:21:57,177
Let me ask you a question.

1310
01:21:57,252 --> 01:21:59,981
In five years, why has the CIA,

1311
01:22:00,055 --> 01:22:03,957
the Hague, the United Nations, and NATO

1312
01:22:04,024 --> 01:22:08,188
not been able to find a guy
that we found in just two days

1313
01:22:08,262 --> 01:22:11,255
if you actually wanted to find him?

1314
01:22:21,409 --> 01:22:23,399
We're giving you a one-way ticket home.

1315
01:22:23,478 --> 01:22:24,945
I suggest you use it.

1316
01:22:25,013 --> 01:22:27,038
We're not saving your asses again.

1317
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:32,085
From this moment on,
the story's being written by others.

1318
01:22:59,148 --> 01:23:01,241
The Americans, yeah,
they brokered the peace agreement,

1319
01:23:01,316 --> 01:23:04,480
but some would suggest they
made a secret deal with the Fox,

1320
01:23:04,552 --> 01:23:08,249
that if he stepped down from power
they would not arrest him for war crimes.

1321
01:23:24,941 --> 01:23:27,773
You ever flown in
one of these puppies before?

1322

You won't have feeling
in your ass for a week.

- Great.
- It's nice they packed for us.

1324
01:23:33,849 --> 01:23:35,749
So what are you going to do?

1325
01:23:35,819 --> 01:23:39,050
I don't know.
Go to Greece with Duck.

1326
01:23:39,121 --> 01:23:41,214
Share some moussaka
with him and his girlfriend.

1327
01:23:44,794 --> 01:23:46,523
Duck?

1328
01:23:48,197 --> 01:23:50,029
Duck?

1329
01:23:50,099 --> 01:23:51,727
What is it?

1330
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,939
They sent Boris out of this country

1331
01:23:59,009 --> 01:24:03,139
because he was actually
trying to catch the Fox.

1332
01:24:03,213 --> 01:24:05,544
They're sending us away
because we found him.

1333
01:24:05,615 --> 01:24:07,913
No, he found us.
We're lucky we still have our heads.

1334
01:24:07,984 --> 01:24:11,283
No, it's like no one in a position
of power in this place

1335
01:24:11,354 --> 01:24:13,914
even wants to try and catch that bastard.

1336
