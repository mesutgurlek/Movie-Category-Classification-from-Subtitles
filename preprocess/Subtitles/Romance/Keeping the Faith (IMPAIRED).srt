(MELLOW SONG PLAYING)

2
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:57,347
The evening fell just like a star
Left a trail behind

3
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,226
You spit as you slammed out the door

4
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,318
If this is love we're crazy
We fight like cats and dogs

5
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:14,114
But I just know there's got to be more

6
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:25,667
Please call me, baby
Wherever you are

7
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,088
It's too cold to be out
walking in the streets

8
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,802
We do crazy things
when we're wounded

9
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:38,222
Everyone's a bit insane

10
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,394
I don't want you catching
your death of cold

11
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,481
Out walking in the rain

12
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:10,212
I admit that I ain't no angel
I admit that I ain't no saint

13
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,716
I'm selfish and I'm cruel
But you're blind

14
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:22,724
If I exorcise my devils
Well, my angels may leave too

15
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,729
When they leave they're so hard to find

16
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:38,740
Please call me, baby
Wherever you are

17
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,536
It's too cold to be out
walking in the streets

18
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,958
We do crazy things
when we're wounded

19

Everyone's a bit insane

20
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,426
I don't want you catching
your death of cold

21
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,137
Out walking in the rain

- (MUSIC PLAYING QUIETLY)
- Answer me honestly.

23
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:17,821
If I was to tell you that I love you
and that I'd throw it all away

24
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,491
to be with you, what would you say?

25
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,827
Goodnight, Paulie.

26
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:32,878
Yup. Yup, that's about par
for the evening.

27
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:39,885
But what I wanna see
Is the way things used to be

28
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:48,018
Between you and me
The way things used to be...

29
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,937
(SOBBING)

30
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,775
Let me guess.

31
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,654
Your old lady got fed up
'cause you're chasing skirt,

32
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,907
so she took these little ones
and left you.

33
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,953
It's a little more complicated than that.

34
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,456
It always is. Everybody thinks
their story has a twist.

35
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,166
But in my experience...

36
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,170
- Holy shit.
- Exactly.

37
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,547
This I've got to hear.

38
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,260
It's a long story,
and I know you're very busy...

39
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:26,056
- I don't really feel like...
- Wait, wait. No, no, please.

40
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:40,862
Okay, now tell me, Father, how long
has it been since your last drink?

41
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,826
It's been about a minute
and a half since my last drink.

42
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,997
Now, what about these kids?

43
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:55,794
Okay. Well, you see the one
on the right?

44
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,214
The cute one? That's me.

45
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,052
- Very cute.
- Brian Finn.

46
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,929
Paulie Chopra.

47
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,851
This kid on the left
was my best friend, Jake.

48
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:17,274
- He's a priest, too?
- Jake? No. In fact, he's a rabbi.

49
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,611
C'mon. A priest and a rabbi?
I've heard this one.

50
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:26,158
I've heard all of those. Trust me,
you have not heard this one.

51
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:31,913
Okay? So there's this priest
and this rabbi, and they're best friends.

52
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,876
But before they were a priest
and a rabbi,

53
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,252
they both knew this girl.

54
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,214
PAULIE: The girl.

55
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,092
- Who's the girl?
- That's Anna Reilly.

56
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:48,263
Reilly? Let me guess,
she became a nun?

57
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,057
Not quite. Not quite...

58
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:56,104
We all met in 6th grade at PS 84,
right here in Manhattan.

59
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,612
I think I already knew Jake,
then we both met Anna.

60
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,449
Actually, I remember exactly
how we met, 'cause...

61
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,118
Well, it was a defining moment.

62
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,458
After that,
we were pretty much inseparable.

63
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,427
Jake and I were
what you'd call "late bloomers,"

64
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,099
and a 7th grade girl's attentions
can be fickle, but not Anna.

65
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,267
Her loyalty to us was constant.

66
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,646
Anna was the friend
every 13-year-old boy dreams of.

67
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,774
That magical cross
between Jonny Quest

68
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,402
and Tatum O'Neal in Foxes.

69
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,837
We were some trio. Anna called us
"Two Micks and a Yid."

70
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,463
She was gonna make T-shirts.

71
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,427
There's 8 million people in New York,
but when we were together,

72
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,720
it felt like we lived on our own island.

73
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,016
But New York is an island.

74
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,938
I'm trying to sprinkle a little
fairy dust here, to tell a story!

75
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:24,776
I'm terribly sorry. Continue.
Go on, sprinkle away.

76
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,447
Well, then disaster struck.

77
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,992
The summer after 8th grade,
Anna's father got a job in California,

78
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,995
and just like that, she was gone.

79
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,590
As for me and Jake,
our friendship just got stronger.

80
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,176
We were like most kids in New York,

81
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,929
but there was one unusual component:

82
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,724
We were fascinated
with each other's religions.

83
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,435
He showed me
the secret rituals of Judaism,

84
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,730
and I revealed
the Catholic mysteries.

85
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:06,568
Just remember:
Spectacles, testicles, watch, wallet.

86
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:20,582
What makes two kids want to be
a priest and a rabbi nowadays?

87
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,668
People don't talk much
about a calling anymore,

88
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,962
but I knew it was what
I was supposed to do.

89
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,299
Even then, people felt good
bringing their problems to me.

90
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,929
My parents had given up
on children before me,

91
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,389
so my mother called me
her "gift from God."

92
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:41,353
That stuck with me, so at eight
I told her I felt I had to return the favor.

93
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,438
She was so happy, she cried.

94
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,441
My dad just wanted to know
if working for God came with dental.

95
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,280
Jake's sense of a calling
didn't gel as early as mine.

96
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,451
Religion was more of a hobby for him.

97
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,286
Got it, got it,

98
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:04,292
need it, need it,
got it, got it, need it, got it.

99
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,504
(CHEERING AND SHOUTING)

100
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,883
Jake was one of those special kids.
Smart, popular.

101
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,886
Everything came easy to him.
He had an aura.

102
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,183
You took one look at him, and you
knew he could do anything in life.

103
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,479
Jake's family had been in investment
banking for three generations.

104
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,483
His father and brother Ethan
wanted him to join the family firm.

105
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,361
I think he considered it,

106
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,739
but he wanted to do
something different with his life.

107
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:39,160
He made his decision to become
a rabbi with confidence and resolve.

108
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,079
I don't wanna listen to you!

109
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:45,166
We went off to seminary the way
other guys go off to the Peace Corps.

110
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,543
It was an adventure.

111
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:53,717
Newly ordained, we were both
assigned back to New York City,

112
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,386
where we quickly confronted
the practical aspects of our jobs.

we found our groove.

Take it nice and easy.
Win them over slowly, okay?

120

Shabbat shalom, everyone!

121
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,395
I want you to do me a favor.

122
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,358
I want everybody in the back
to come and fill up the front rows.

123
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:56,112
Guys, come on! Let's try again.
Shabbat shalom!

124
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,074
- Shabbat shalom!
- Thank you, Mom.

125
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:03,912
Ma'am, you in the back, come on!
God hates a solo artist, I promise you.

126
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,498
We're the Fugees, no Lauryn Hills.

127
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:13,421
My mom was the only person here
at the level of shabbat shalom-iness

128
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,465
that I think we can hit.

129
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:20,387
Sir, you're leaving. It's customary
to sneak out after the communion.

130
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,139
Give me something I can work with!
Shabbat shalom!

131
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,935
- ALL: Shabbat shalom!
- All right! Now we can daven!

132
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,564
BRIAN: I don 't want to brag, but word
got out there was a new act in town,

133
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:36,403
and soon we played to the packed
houses I knew were our destiny.

134
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,446
(LAUGHTER)

135
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,324
I know. I know!

136
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,165
Seriously, what is the story of Sodom
and Gomorrah really about?

137
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,585
- Anyone? Steve Posner.
- Sexual perversion.

138
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,090
Sexual perversion. Steve Posner's
watching too much Spice Channel.

139
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:02,554
The Seven Deadly Sins. Who can
name the Seven Deadly Sins?

140
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:09,644
People! It was a film with Brad Pitt.
You have the ultimate Cliff Note!

141
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,691
And Lot takes them in and he protects
them. What happens next?

142
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,236
Anybody? Greta Mussbaum,
before she pulls her rotator cuff.

143
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:24,325
- God spares Lot and his family.
- Bingo! Two-week cruise for Greta!

144
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,454
You're going to the Bahamas!

145
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:32,083
When you think about it,
God is a lot like Blanche Du Bois.

146
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,544
He's always relied
on the kindness of strangers.

147
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,670
(INAUDIBLE)

148
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,631
That's what the story's about,
us taking care of each other.

149
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,801
God relies on us
to take care of each other.

150
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:46,556
The truth is, I don't really learn about
your faith by asking such questions.

151
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,518
Those aren't questions about faith,
they're about religion.

152
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,397
It's important to understand
the difference between them,

153
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,484
because faith is not about
having the right answers.

154
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:02,030
Faith is a feeling, faith is a hunch.

155
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,659
It's a hunch that there is
something bigger, connecting it all.

156
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,037
Connecting us all together.

157
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,666
And that feeling, that hunch, is God.

158
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:20,840
Coming here on Sunday evening
to connect with that feeling,

159
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,843
that is an act of faith.

160
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,139
So all I have to do is look around
the room, at this packed church,

161
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,393
to know that we're doing pretty well
as a community.

162
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,106
Even if all of you failed
my pop quiz miserably.

163
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,236
Let us pray.

164
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,991
Jake and I wanted
to kick the dust off our faiths.

165
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,703
Bring them up to speed,
no more old routines.

166
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,957
Jake said, "We'll give them an
Old World God with a New Age spin."

167
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,583

Feel the prana!

169
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,464
We decided to turn
an abandoned disco

170
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,969
into a joint Catholic-Jewish
senior center/karaoke lounge.

A Fiddler on the Roof meets
Lord of the Dance

172
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,100
meets Buena Vista Social Club.

173
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:17,021
Not an easy idea to sell,
but we wanted to push the envelope.

174
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,650
We would bring our religions
into the 21 st century.

175
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,986
We were gonna shove them a little,
if we had to.

176
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:28,283
Jake said we'd be like young cops
shaking up the force.

Well, that's the same as the emotion
that I get from you

181
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:52,181
You got the kind of loving
that can be so smooth, yeah

182
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,269
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it

I'll ring it.

184
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,656
Nice.

Oh!

186
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,994
Ben Lewis comes into my office
this morning, tells me he's retiring.

187
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,622
- Rabbi Lewis?
- Yeah.

188
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,918
- The end of an era.
- I know!

189
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,545
That's exciting. How long until
they give it over to you officially?

190
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:28,968
There are a few backward thinkers
on that board who don't get what I do.

191
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,471
Plus, there's the fact that I'm single.

192
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,518
- Single?
- Don't think that's not an issue.

193
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,605
Wait a minute. Are you serious?

194
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,943
If you don't find a nice Jewish girl soon,
you won't get the job?

195
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:49,238
I'm telling you, B'Nai Ezra
hasn't had a bachelor head rabbi

196
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,241
since the beginning of the synagogue.

197
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,620
Wow. I mean, you better start
getting out there more.

198
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,165
It's embarrassing.

199
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,168
Forget that.
You want to meet somebody, right?

200
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:07,215
I just want to meet somebody
in a spontaneous and casual manner.

201
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,051
- And it's impossible with me.
- Why?

202
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,389
- Because I'm a rabbi!
- Yes, yes. What's your point?

203
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,558
I don't know if a woman
goes out with me for me,

204
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,979
or because I'm Rabbi Jake, you know?

205
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,691
There's an expectation,
I can't go with my impulses...

206
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,653
Jews want rabbis to be the kind of
Jews they don't have the time to be.

207
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,865
And Catholics want priests
to have the discipline they don't have.

208
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,410
- We knew this.
- You're right.

- It ended at 30.

Speaking of our youth,
I forgot to tell you.

- This is big. Guess who called me?
- Who?

you and I have ever known, ever?

- What? She called you?
- Yeah!

- Anna Reilly called you?
- Totally out of the blue.

Why?

She's coming to New York for work,
and she wants to get together.

Really? What is she doing now?

231

She's analyzing synergies
or synergizing analogies.

she's a very high-powered business...

- Yes, thank you.

- Yeah, she flipped.

but she was excited.

- I know.

No, I mean, she called you.

- Finn before Schram, okay?

You win. She put jogging as a skill.

She can't even differentiate
between a hobby and a skill.

- Punch me. Hit me!

00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:11,465
I've heard so much about you.
The service was wonderful.

449
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,718
- Oh.
- You were really, really wonderful.

450
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,889
- We're all aware of your success.
- She's now in network prime time.

451
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:22,768
- Look, we get on a live feed.
- My mom does all my PR.

452
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,813
- I know what you mean. Mine, too.
- No, my mother's firm does my PR.

453
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:30,525
I'm at PMK.
We got her special correspondent.

454
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,610
Great!

455
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,821
- She just interviewed Arafat.
- Yasser?

456
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,657
- In Arabic.
- That's great, I didn't know.

457
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,995
What you don't know is a lot.
You two should get together.

458
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,873
- Sure.
- I'm free on Thursday.

459
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:48,668
- Thursday, that's great.
- Okay.

460
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,212
JAKE: Great. Nice to see you, Bonnie.

461
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,261
This is the man you told me about.

462
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,264
I appreciate what you did
for us in the war...

463
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,854
- How upset are they?
- They're less than thrilled.

464
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:12,317
- We're less than thrilled.
- With what, specifically?

465
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,822
With what, specifically?
With guided meditation, specifically.

466
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:23,203
With stand-up comedy sermons,
and your loose improvisational style.

467
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:27,666
With people enjoying services,
people showing up at all?

468
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,544
To be serenaded
by the Harlem Gospel Choir?

469
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:34,047
- At least they were praying!
- It was a hell of an Ein Keloheinu.

470
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,716
- It's not kosher!
- What does that mean?

471
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,386
What's kosher? Study your gemara.

472
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,472
Do you feel the same way?

473
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,184
It's not your ideas.
Your ideas are very good.

474
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,020
You're just a little aggressive...

475
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:54,192
- But, Ben, come on! It was working!
- I know, I know.

476
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,863
- You shake things up. That's good.
- When it works.

477
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:03,451
But appreciate that many people
come here for a sense of continuity.

478
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:07,706
It's not just the board.
It's your congregation, Jake.

479
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,586
Mrs. Katz likes to sing
Ein Keloheinu the way she knows it.

480
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,756
Tradition is not old habit.
It's comforting to people.

481
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,634
I'm not interested
in babysitting Mrs. Katz.

482
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,388
I want to push people to grow.
Otherwise, what are we doing?

483
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:27,601
I know, but you have
to be patient with them.

484
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,353
You'll find people go a lot farther

485
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:34,774
if they feel they're being led
and not pushed!

486
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,779
RUTH: Good for you, Anna.

487
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,741
No more of this
"woman behind the man" shit.

488
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:46,119
Most men are unworthy
of the opportunities they've had.

489
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,080
As a woman on your own,
trying to succeed,

490
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,834
what do you do
with that victory energy each day?

491
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,045
Don't you want to share it?

492
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,465
Do what they do. Take lovers.
I've had more dates than Jake.

493
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,633
Mom...

494
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:04,679
It's true. And when lovers bore,
which they will, sublimate.

495
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,850
- I take classes.
- Me, too! What's your favorite?

496
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,353
- Kabbalah. You?
- Kick-boxing.

497
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:16,816
I used to take kick-boxing, but it was
too high-impact. I take tae-bo now.

498
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,278
- It's doubled my energy.
- I need that high impact.

499
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,448
RUTH: I know, I take
Native American drumming.

500
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,992
You take tae-bo?

501
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,995
RUTH: Look at those pomegranates.

502
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:38,505
Our-Lady's bedstraw.
The most poetic herb.

503
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,633
Now, over to you.
Anybody new in your life?

504
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,511
Wow! Twenty minutes.
I can't believe we got this far.

505
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:48,014
It's my right to check.
What about that Shapiro girl?

506
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,268
- Not the Shapiro girl.
- Why? She was a looker.

507
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,396
- The problem was here.
- What? Bad skin?

508
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,606
- No, not bad skin.
- What?

509
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:01,194
You want an example? I take her out
to dinner. She doesn't want dessert.

510
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,531
I get pecan pie.
She asks for a bite, I give it to her.

511
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:09,369
Her face swells up like a chipmunk.
She says, "Are there nuts in this?"

512
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,747
- So what?
- Mom, it was pecan pie!

513
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:17,460
- There must be somebody for you.
- Come on, tell her!

514
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,463
- He's got a very hot prospect.
- Who?

515
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:24,718
Rachel Rose!
That's who I'm going out with.

516
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,471
- ABC Rachel Rose?
- Yes, ABC Rachel Rose.

517
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:32,183
I could be in-laws
with ABC Rachel Rose.

518
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,185
Peter Jennings would be
at the wedding!

519
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:39,232
Speaking of in-laws, Ethan and Jackie
took me to her mom's new play.

520
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,568
- How is Ethan?
- He just got promoted.

521
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:46,573
He's a vice-president now.
They gave him Dad's old office.

522
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,785
How nice. I got to hear this from you.

523
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,831
- Maybe if you called him...
- I don't want to talk about it.

524
00:38:54,957 --> 00:39:00,003
- Mom, he'd love to hear from you.
- Please, Jake, don't spoil this.

525
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,798
I got you, I'm proud of you.
I got this beautiful garden.

526
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,676
I've reconnected with this old friend.

527
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,597
Let's just hold hands and breathe.
Together.

528
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,977
- You're not breathing.
- I am.

529
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,731
- I don't hear you breathing.
- I don't breathe audibly.

530
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,525
(CHILD SPEAKING SPANISH)

531
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,206
Blam!

532
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:01,689
- All right, I gotta go. I gotta go!
- Gotta go, really gotta go!

533
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,192
Why not have that thing
implanted in your ear?

534
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,069
I'll be top on the list.

535
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,571
- ¿ Hola, María, cómo está?
- Beep! Beep!

536
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,826
- Hello, young sir!
- Hello, Radio Man.

537
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:16,871
- It's like I'm in The Godfather.
- I'm God's consigliere.

538
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,998
Gotta go through me to get to Him.

539
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,542
Whoa, children.

540
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,502
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

541
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,898
I totally forget
how amazing New York is.

542
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:48,027
I know. Whoever said it,
it was really true.

543
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,322
New Yorkers understand
people living elsewhere

544
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,491
must be, in some sense, kidding.

545
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:05,420
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, obviously, anything.

546
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,213
It's personal, so...

547
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:12,760
- Are we gonna have the sex talk?
- Yes!

548
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,930
- I want to know how this works for you.
- It's fine. Fire away.

549
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,766
- Really?
- Yeah, I know you got a list.

550
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,018
Okay.

551
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:25,148
- Well, you don't, right?
- No.

552
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,358
- At all?
- At all.

553
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,777
So, have you ever...

554
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,907
- Yes!
- Had sex? Yes.

555
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,034
- With women?
- Yes.

556
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,244
- So, you're not gay.
- No.

557
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,913
- Sure?
- Yes.

558
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,416
But even if I was,
the rules are the same.

559
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,461
- Do you miss it?
- No.

560
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,046
- Are you tempted?
- No.

561
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,716
- You'd love it if the rule changed.
- I don't think about it.

562
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,177
- Do you fantasize?
- Not really.

563
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,514
How is that possible?
I've seen how women look at you.

564
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,933
Especially knowing you're a priest.

565
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,686
- I'm not blind, okay.
- How do you deal with that?

566
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,774
It's not an issue for me. It's really not.

567
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,443
- Really?
- I'm past that point.

568
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,947
I'm completely committed to what I do.

569
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,784
To my work. It defines me,
completely, as a person.

570
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,871
And it fulfills me. I'm very happy.

571
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:26,125
That particular sacrifice is a gesture,
a symbol of my commitment.

572
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:30,046
- Quite a gesture.
- I know it seems that way.

573
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,550
It's like giving up smoking,
the first year is tough,

574
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,302
but then you don't care
if you see people smoke.

575
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,805
I quit two years ago
and when I see smokers,

576
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:42,392
I want to French kiss them
to suck the smoke out of their lungs.

577
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,561
Well, don't be a priest!

578
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:50,233
I really admire your commitment.
I don't think I could take it.

579
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,735
You've sacrificed for what you do.

580
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,532
There comes a point
where I just crave contact,

581
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:02,829
you know, like I want
to touch someone, and be touched.

582
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,915
You're amazing.

583
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,169
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

584
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,301
- Thus endeth the sex conversation?
- Thus endeth.

585
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,807
I bet no one ever asks
the Dalai Lama these questions.

586
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:35,361
Len, don't argue with me.
I have it right here, and it's not right.

587
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:39,616
I'll be back in an hour, run it again.
God, I hate these Harvard guys!

588
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,122
Rachel Rose! When's that going down?

589
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,541
- Thursday.
- Thursday night, 8: 00 p. M. Dinner.

590
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,878
- Are you excited?
- Yeah, I have a pretty good feeling.

591
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:56,883
- Where are you taking her?
- I thought Ernie's.

592
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:01,763
You can't take her to Ernie's!
It's been around since we were kids!

593
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,850
- You cannot take Rachel Rose there.
- (NASALLY) Definitely not.

594
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:10,104
- You must go somewhere new and hot.
- Definitely hot.

595
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,815
- What's new and hot?
- What do we know about her?

596
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,236
Twenty-nine years old, journalism
school, Middle East Affairs expert.

597
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,031
Perfect. Middle Eastern.
She can order in Arabic.

598
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:25,703
- What's a good place?
- Delphini's. Four stars.

599
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,038
You need a reservation.

600
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:31,250
- Will you wear a suit, or go casual?
- I don't know. I guess cas...

601
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:35,004
- No, suit, definitely a suit.
- Shut up, Rain Man. Seriously!

602
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,384
- Now you're making me think.
- Relax.

603
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,219
What if you guys came with me?

604
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:46,265
Bring a priest on your date?
What kind of strategy is that?

605
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,978
Not a priest, my friend Brian,
and his girlfriend, Anna. A double date.

606
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,358
Pretend you're a couple. Are you busy?

607
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:59,112
- You could bring your cell phone.
- That's not the point.

608
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,865
- What's the point?
- You don't need a chaperone.

609
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,744
I don't need a chaperone,
I need some help. Please?

610
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,372
I'm begging you.

611
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:16,129
That's how the business is going.
People want news to be edgy.

612
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,006
- That's why Brokaw stands now.
- What?

613
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,552
- Tom Brokaw stands to read the news.
- The whole time?

614
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,595
- Yeah.
- He does?

615
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,142
- He's done it for about a year now.
- Really? I gotta watch the news more.

616
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,562
I saw your sarin gas report.
It was very powerful.

617
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,648
Thanks.
I earned my stripes with that piece.

618
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:40,737
- I got through a bris without fainting.
- I vetoed the "McOyster."

619
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,990
- A grateful nation thanks you.
- Made me a star.

620
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,868
So, how long have you two
been together?

621
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,997
- Oh, right...
- God, we go way back.

622
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,833
We've all known each other
since we were kids.

623
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,169
- I had a crush on Anna.
- Really?

624
00:45:56,211 --> 00:46:00,006
- I told you that. She knew that.
- No, you didn't!

625
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,469
Anyway, we reconnected
a couple of months ago,

626
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,972
and we just clicked, very unexpectedly.

627
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,100
I think it's great
to be friends first, don't you?

628
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,020
Always. Friends first.

629
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,483
So, do you write your own reports?

630
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,028
Yeah. I wouldn't trust
anyone else to get them right.

631
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,573
You write your own sermons, right?

632
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,200
Actually, I download them off the Net.

633
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:32,371
- I use www. Hotgod.com.
- Really?

634
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,081
- (KICKING)
- Ow!

635
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,835
No. No, I was kidding.

636
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,755
- So, you do write your own sermons?
- Yeah.

637
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,007
He writes beautiful sermons.

638
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:47,720
Actually, I like to improvise.
Keeps everybody on their toes.

639
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,849
I guess you can't do that
too much with the news.

640
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,393
- What?
- Riff.

641
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,938
No, not really.

642
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,825
I bet the Middle East is lovely
this time of year.

643
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,036
Well, not if you're Kurdish.

644
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,038
(PAGER BEEPS)

645
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,748
Excuse me.

646
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:22,672
Oh, my God! The Iraqi Defense Minister
just committed suicide.

647
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,175
- Is that bad or good?
- Well, it...

648
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:31,222
- Brian, would you explain it to him?
- I will.

649
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:36,769
- How's it going?
- She's beautiful.

650
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,814
- She's great, too.
- She's very adult.

651
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:44,277
- You're doing great, we're impressed.
- You look so hot in your suit.

652
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:49,490
- Thank you. You look beautiful.
- You do. You look amazing.

653
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:53,703
- Thanks, men.
- There's something about you tonight.

654
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,455
- An absence...
- The cell phone.

655
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,582
Uh-uh-uh!

656
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,293
- It's set to vibrate.
- Oh, my...

657
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:05,214
- Wow. That's sexy.
- Don't you want to be free of that?

658
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:10,887
No. You don't understand.
I have a relationship with my phone.

659
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,973
We have a chemistry together.
I can't explain it.

660
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,269
- Chemistry's a funny thing.
- Yes, it is.

661
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,314
Are you speaking abstractly,
or specifically?

662
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,692
Abstractly.

663
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,241
Well, looks like I'm going to Baghdad.

664
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,828
- Two seconds. It was a pleasure.
- Yeah.

665
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,789
- Nice to meet you.
- Good luck to you both.

666
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:41,250
- Talk to you soon.
- All right.

667
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,003
- I'll talk to you.
- Okay, call me.

668
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,505
- Call me soon.
- Thanks, again.

669
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,049
Bye.

670
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,310
What are you thinking about, right now?

671
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,854
It's funny.

672
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,940
- I was at the Met yesterday.
- Again?

673
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,859
I go every week,
and I noticed a painting,

674
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:10,029
a watercolor by Bonnard
I've passed every time.

675
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:16,327
This time I looked at it, and I was
just riveted. It was so beautiful.

676
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,790
I was just wondering
why I never saw it before.

677
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:27,254
Sometimes we don't see things
until we're ready to see them

678
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,466
in a certain way. You know?

679
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,886
Very true.

680
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,849
Yeah.

681
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,145
What's going on with Ruth and Ethan?

682
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,064
Oh, uh...

683
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:50,069
Ethan married a Catholic girl,
and that did not go over well.

684
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:54,198
- That's why they're fighting?
- Not fighting. They're not talking.

685
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:58,411
- Two years now. No comunicado.
- Are you serious?

686
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:02,790
- Totally. It's...
- What? Weren't they close, then?

687
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,960
- As close as Ruth and Jake.
- Wow.

688
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:11,090
- That explains a lot.
- Yeah.

689
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,884
You see why tonight was not just a date.

690
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,095
Hmm!

691
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:25,104
I feel terrible about
having to cut the night short.

692
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,107
I totally understand.
When the beeper beeps...

693
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,901
I'm just going to be packing.

694
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:35,823
Would you like to come up
for a nightcap, keep me company?

695
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:44,081
I'd love to, but I should leave you.
I mean, you're going to Baghdad.

696
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:48,210
Yeah. Yeah, long flight, I know.
Well, okay.

697
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:52,423
But when you get back,
we should definitely get together.

698
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:56,469
- I would love to. It's a date.
- Okay.

699
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,181
- Bye.
- Bye.

700
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,112
Taxi!

701
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,412
- Well, this is me.
- Okay.

702
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,165
You wanna come up for a while?

703
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:30,336
I'd love to, but I should get home.
I have an early conference call.

704
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,172
Me, too. I gotta talk to the big guy.

705
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,301
- Right.
- Calls early.

706
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,680
- Rain check, though.
- Yeah, definitely.

707
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,058
Goodnight.

708
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,521
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

709
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,008
- Hi.
- Hi.

710
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:24,890
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know, what am I doing here?

711
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,161
ANNA: I haven't screamed that hard

712
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,580
since the US hockey team
beat the Russians.

713
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:52,543
Incredible. I wanted to do that
since you walked off that airplane.

714
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:56,881
Really? Right away?
You hadn't seen me in 16 years.

715
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:01,010
I know! You were this tough,
sexy businesswoman.

716
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:05,639
I just wanted to pull you into security
and give you a cavity search.

717
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,268
That would have been impulsive.

718
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:13,105
Well, this is pretty impulsive, for me.

719
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,277
- Believe me.
- It felt good though, right?

720
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,072
Yeah, good.
Just, I mean, a little complicated.

721
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,496
What would people at work think
if they knew you slept with a rabbi?

722
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,582
Could be a scandal.

723
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,960
Oh.

724
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,964
- Listen.
- Yeah?

725
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:44,094
You know what my life is like.
I'm only here for a little while.

726
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,471
Yes.

727
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,934
And I'm fine, just hanging out,
having a great time with you.

728
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:57,149
But sometimes I want
to jump you, too. What can I say?

729
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:03,656
- Is that okay?
- That's okay. It's more than okay.

730
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:10,204
ANNA: Think we should
say anything to Brian?

731
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:14,917
I think it might be a little weird for him.

732
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:20,673
- You don't think he'd understand?
- No, I just... I don't know.

733
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,093
I think we should just keep it simple.

734
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,346
I'm for simple.

735
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:32,518
I have something simple
I'd like to discuss with you.

736
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,396
(SLOW SONG PLAYING)

737
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,274
Do you want to know

738
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:44,822
If everything glittering
will turn into the gold

739
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:50,494
I see in your hair?
I feel it could be there

740
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:55,374
Somehow tonight

741
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,921
And do you want to find

742
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:07,261
Something worth saving?
The change would do me right

743
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:13,100
I've been just waiting
and hesitating

744
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,102
With this heart

745
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:23,235
Of mine

746
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,366
You're still a mystery

747
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:36,248
But there's something so easy
in how you're sweet to me

748
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:42,212
I feel completed
Like it's something I needed

749
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,590
For this heart

750
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:52,389
Of mine

751
00:55:56,811 --> 00:56:01,482
There's always something so tragic

752
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:07,446
About a hopeless romantic

753
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:27,800
We have a Jake Schram here
for Anna Reilly. Yes?

754
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,010
Okay.

755
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:34,973
I'll be coming here a lot,
so let's forget this name thing,

756
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:38,936
you can just say, "Hey, Jake,"
and I'll say, "Hey, T-Bone."

757
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,816
- That pass is good for one hour.
- Okay. Thank you.

758
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:49,738
Wednesday night, you have a call
at 7:00 and dinner at 8:00.

759
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:53,117
All right. I'll make the call,
but cancel the dinner. I have a class.

760
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,745
He's late.

761
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:01,875
Oh, my God.
Are you guys getting serious?

762
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:05,337
- No, no, no.
- Yes, you are.

763
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,798
- No, we're not.
- I saw it, I can tell!

764
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,592
No, no... Oh, he's here!

765
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,679
- Hey.
- Hi.

766
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,934
Debbie, this is Jake. Jake, vice versa.

767
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,978
- How you doing?
- Hi, Jake.

768
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:25,274
Can I just say... Good. Good for you.

769
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,526
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

770
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:32,406
- Ah, Debbie...
- Debbie... Debbie, what?

771
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,450
Oh!

772
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,577
The numbers are good for you, now?

773
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:42,875
Good. Just run one more scenario
and assume an 8% I RR.

774
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,418
Bye.

775
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,883
- Hi.
- You're really gonna run an 8% I RR?

776
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,595
- I'd go with 15%, at least.
- Stick with the Torah.

777
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:58,807
Look at this place. It's ridiculous!
It's so impressive. Wow!

(INAUDIBLE)

779
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,020
- Try again. Hey.
- Hi.

780
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,981
Can we close your blinds and... What?

781
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:09,318
- Remember that guy I told you about?
- The guy...

782
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:13,614
Mr. 23rd Floor? Check it out.
There, with the huge plant.

783
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,325
- Nothing interesting will be going on...
- Trust me.

784
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:22,247
- Holy Majoly!
- Told you.

785
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:28,378
Does he have music on in there?
He's, like, porn-slapping her.

786
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:34,343
- Okay, we should go now.
- He has healthy self-confidence.

787
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:38,305
- Ready? Let's go.
- Hang on, I'm learning something here.

788
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,600
- We'll be late.
- You'll benefit from this.

789
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,229
ANNA: I can't Wednesday night,
I've a class.

790
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,813
JAKE: What class?

791
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:50,359
ANNA: I try new things.
I'm embarrassed talking about it.

792
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,654
JAKE: Don't be embarrassed.
Many people take aikido.

793
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,781
- Nope.
- Line-dancing.

794
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:59,910
- Not even close.
- What's the big deal, why can't I know?

795
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,037
- Feng shui?
- No!

796
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:05,999
Don't be embarrassed if it is.
Don't tell me, I don't need to know.

797
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,545
I like the "mysterioso" quality.
It's very sexy.

798
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:13,006
- That's good. All right. I gotta pee.
- Hold on, I want to tell you something.

799

Hold that thought.

801
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:31,108
- Look who's here!
- Hey! Hey!

802
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:36,238
Holy... How you doing?
Larry, Ellen, what are you doing here?

803
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:40,409
We're buying a turkey!
No, we're seeing a movie.

804
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:42,786
Are you alone?

805
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,206
No. I mean, I'm with an old friend.

806
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:50,919
Why, when Emma Gerber
wants you to take her daughter out?

807
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,672
You should call,
the family's very wealthy.

808
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:57,009
- Though she's no Rachel Rose.
- They can make donations.

809
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:01,555
I've got to call her, but right now
I'm taking a break from dating.

810
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:04,725
- Whoa!
- Look who it is!

811
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,936
- We were talking about Rachel.
- Naturally.

812
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,355
- Did you come together?
- No...

813
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:15,068
- This is why I love New York.
- It's true.

814
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:18,780
These are my movie girls,
this is Roz and Chaya Lentz.

815
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:22,534
- We're seeing the Garcia picture.
- So are we!

816
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:26,872
My daughter's been back a week.
She said she called you a few times.

817
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,583
She's disappointed
not to have seen you.

818
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:33,712
- How you doing? Perfect.
- LARRY: This is your friend?

819
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:38,425
This is my buddy, Anna.
These are people...

820
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:41,803
This is Larry Friedman,
president of the synagogue.

821
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,222
ANNA: I've heard so much about you.

822
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:48,352
- Nice to meet you.
- And Bonnie Rose, and the Luntzes...

823
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,895
- Lentzes!
- Lentzes.

824
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:53,940
- They're from the congregation.
- I didn't get your last name.

825
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,942
- Reilly.
- Reilly?

826
01:00:56,027 --> 01:01:01,073
We, Anna and I and Father Brian,
as children, used to play.

827
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,574
What are you seeing?

828
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,494
- Andy Garcia...
- The IMAX... He's in that, right?

829
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:10,082
- I don't think so. We should go.
- I thought he was in that.

830
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,419
MAN: Where are the paper towels?

831
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,924
There are no paper towels.

832
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:23,845
I'm in a crisis here! I need help!

833
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,391
I need someone who,
when there are no paper towels,

834
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:30,602
they go to a goddamn store
and buy some paper towels!

835
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:35,524
How many jobs do you hope to pull
with no paper towels?

836
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,109
- You okay?
- I'm cool.

837
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:40,612
I need someone with
a little common sense around here.

838

WOMAN: Why not get somebody else?

839
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:51,957
- Okay, what?
- If we were going out, I'd be pissed off!

840
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:56,795
That was a scary situation for me,
and you made it worse!

841
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,548
That is no excuse for what just went on!

842
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:03,093
I'm sorry, too bad,
you have to deal with it.

843
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,512
- Then I'd say...
- What would you say?

844
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:09,683
Come on, bring it, bring the pain!
Say it, say it all.

845
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,646
It's a good thing
we're not going out, then.

846
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,314
- Thank God.
- Thank God.

847
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:20,652
- I wasn't really mad, were you?
- No, but you'll still get a spanking.

848
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:48,263
- You are in such good shape.
- Are you all right?

849
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:54,853
No, you gotta stretch.
You gotta stretch, or you'll tighten up.

850
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:59,900
- Come on. Does that hurt?
- No, it feels good.

851
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:04,112
Harder.

852
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,406
Harder!

853
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:12,954
- Okay, that's enough.
- You're such a wimp.

- Tuesday...
- We have to punch up or punch out...

- Tuesday, I'm with the Schwartzes.

I think they can do Thursday night.

- Really? Is it a big thing?

No, it's just that
she needs someone to go with.

But lately something's changed
that ain't hard to define

910
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:45,101
It's just he's got himself a girl
and I want to make her mine

911
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,772
And she's watching him
with those eyes

you get those things, then suspect
you went after the wrong things,

01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:41,614
I didn't go into explicit detail.

1046
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:44,241
I can't believe you did that.
It's between us!

1047
01:17:44,284 --> 01:17:46,744
Jake, she figured it out on her own.

1048
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:50,331
- Did you try to deny it?
- Come on, Jake, she knew!

1049
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:53,209
No wonder she was crying!

1050
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:57,755
I was crying, too, all right?
We had a nice talk about it.

1051
01:17:57,881 --> 01:18:00,007
She was upset, but not angry.

1052
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:03,010
- She put on that face.
- She didn't.

1053
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,721
I know, okay? All right? I mean...

1054
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:08,974
You have no idea of the nightmare
I'm in for now.

1055
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:12,603
This is not a nightmare, okay? Stop it.

1056
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,398
Hey, look at me.

1057
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:17,733
Look at me.

1058
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:25,032
- I am in love with you, Jake.
- I love you, too.

1059
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:31,122
No. You are in love with me,
you're just scared of what it involves.

1060
01:18:31,164 --> 01:18:35,292
- Yes, I am.
- Me, too, but I'm dealing with it.

1061
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:39,797
Because I'm overwhelmed by feelings
for you and I want to work it out.

1062
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,800
- Great, how do I work it out?
- Okay.

1063
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:47,888
Let's take it from the top. It's not about
your mother, brother, or synagogue.

1064
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,474
Just you. What do you need
to work it out?

1065
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:54,854
Those things are me, understand?
I can't separate them out.

1066
01:18:54,980 --> 01:19:00,151
It's hard to accept, but the fact
you're not Jewish is a problem for me.

1067
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,986
I don't think so.

1068
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:07,324
Okay, all I'm saying is that
you should be honest with yourself.

1069
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:11,996
I think if it was just up to you,
you'd stick with this relationship,

1070
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,584
but it's a problem because you think
other people can't deal with it.

1071
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:20,504
- No, they can't.
- Give them credit, it's the 21 st century.

1072
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:25,593
What does the 21 st century have to
do with anything? This is you and me!

1073
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:30,514
- I thought we were just having fun.
- That's my point, I'm having fun.

1074
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:34,059
I'm having fun, too. This is a lot of fun!

1075
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:37,563
Exactly. So, why throw it away?

1076
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:48,073
Can't you see that you're asking me
to risk losing everything I value,

1077
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:50,034
just to see if we work?

1078
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,663
I mean, I love you, but...

1079
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:59,710
We're different in so many ways
unrelated to you not being Jewish.

1080
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:02,046
What are you saying?

1081
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:05,633
We have totally different priorities.
Look at your life.

1082
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:09,386
I don't think there's room in your life
for what I'm spiritually committed to.

1083
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,557
That is so unfair.

1084
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:20,523
Your faith is a huge part
of what I love about you.

1085
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:26,904
But you must be patient. It doesn't
come as easily for others as for you.

1086
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:31,534
You will never find the kind
of relationship I know you want,

1087
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:35,746
and you will never be the kind
of spiritual leader you could be

1088
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:38,415
until you learn to put faith
in other people.

I'm not saying we should marry,
all I'm saying

1090
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:48,342
is that I'm in love with you,
and I want to give it a real shot.

1091
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:52,805
I don't know what to say.

1092
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:56,851
How about, "I've always wanted
someone like you, and I won't lose you."

1093
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:05,943
I'm sorry...

No, and certainly not in that voice.

but does my life seem shallow to you?

you feel guilty. I can't believe it.

01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:42,607
BRIAN: Rabbi Jacob Schram!

1191
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:45,027
Rabbi Jacob Schram!

1192
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:47,821
Oh, Rabbi Jacob...

1193
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:51,366
Oh... Hello!

1194
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:55,203
- May I help you?
- Yes, I'm Father Brian Finn.

1195
01:28:55,246 --> 01:28:59,374
I'm looking for my old friend,
Rabbi Jacob Schram, and there he is.

1196
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:03,462
- Brian, what's going on?
- Looking smart and breaking hearts.

1197
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:06,131
- What are you doing?
- Don't smile at me.

1198
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:09,343
- I'm on to you, and I'm in no mood...
- What's going on?

1199
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,346
- You're drunk.
- I'm not drunk.

1200
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:16,308
I'm not drunk, I'm Irish.
This is milk to me.

1201
01:29:16,392 --> 01:29:18,143
What's going on?

1202
01:29:18,227 --> 01:29:22,647
- It's okay.
- It's not! My best friend lied to me!

1203
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:28,362
- And he stole my girlfriend, on top of it.
- Come here.

1204
01:29:28,946 --> 01:29:32,240
- Did they change the rules?
- Take your hands off me!

1205
01:29:36,662 --> 01:29:38,914
Give me that! I can't believe you!

1206
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:41,333
Don't lie here, this is the big room.

1207
01:29:41,417 --> 01:29:46,254
God doesn't look favorably on it.
He throws lightning bolts! At liars!

1208
01:29:46,297 --> 01:29:51,885
- How did you find out?
- How? How do you think?

1209
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:54,971
- She told you.
- She was crying on my shoulder.

1210
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:56,473
What did you expect?

1211
01:29:56,557 --> 01:30:00,936
Did you think she'd just take it
on the chin after how you treated her?

1212
01:30:00,978 --> 01:30:03,980
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Listen to me!

1213
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:08,110
Anna is very special,
she's not like other girls.

1214
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:11,238
You said some things
to her that I resent.

1215
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:14,908
You can't just write her off
like one of your dates, I won't let you.

1216
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:18,161
Brian, I'm in love with her! Okay?

1217
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:22,624
I'm sorry you found out like this,
but the fact is,

1218
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:25,168
that it's between me and her.

1219
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:28,755
It was between you and her,
but now it's between you and me.

1220
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,882
Why is it between you and me?

1221
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:34,719
- Because I love her.
- I know, I love her, too.

1222
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:38,056
No... I'm in love with her.

1223
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:43,728
- What?
- It came as quite a shock to her, too.

1224
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:51,945
- You're in love with her?
- No one seems to have noticed this...

1225
01:30:52,029 --> 01:30:53,321
It's very strange.

1226
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,783
I mean, she's like your sister, Brian...

1227
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:00,745
Yes, thank you for adding
new depths to my confusion.

1228
01:31:02,373 --> 01:31:08,128
Damn it, Jake. You have a whole city
full of women at your feet.

1229
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:13,300
Why go for the first woman
I've ever had any romantic feeling for?

1230
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:16,011
Wait! Listen to what you're saying.

1231
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:19,431
You're saying I should have
sensed the possibility

1232
01:31:19,515 --> 01:31:22,934
that a Catholic priest had a crush
on my secret girlfriend!

1233
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:26,229
BRIAN: So what? You know how much
I care about her.

1234
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:29,149
You could have known
it would end this way.

1235
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:31,067
I know? What does that mean?

1236
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:34,779
Your casual relationships
with women never work,

1237
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:40,452
because they always fall for you,
because you're smart, funny and cute.

1238
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:44,915
- Don't put this all on me.
- You could've had a fling with anybody.

1239
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:49,127
- Why'd you pull her into your bed?
- She pulled me into her bed!

1240
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:50,754
I don't believe that.

1241
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:53,673
It's the truth. She's a woman,
not the Virgin Mary!

1242
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:57,928
Ow!

1243
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:12,651
Let me get this straight.

1244
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:15,278
I'm talking to a priest

1245
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:22,369
who went on a bender because
his best friend, a rabbi, stole his girl?

1246
01:32:23,162 --> 01:32:24,329
Right.

1247
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:29,709
Thank you. I want to thank you
for telling me this story.

1248
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:33,964
- Why?
- Because now I can retire.

1249
01:32:34,465 --> 01:32:37,968
You have to give me advice.
That's what this is about.

1250
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:39,970
Oh, God, what do I know?

1251
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:44,683
I'm a half Punjabi Sikh,
one quarter Tamil separatist,

1252
01:32:45,351 --> 01:32:48,645
my sister's married
a Jewish doctor from New Jersey,

1253
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:52,816
and our grandmother was an Irish nun
who left me this bar,

1254
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,985
which is a very long story.

1255
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:01,157
You're a Sikh Catholic Muslim
with Jewish in-laws?

1256
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:05,328
Yes. Yes, it gets very complicated.

1257
01:33:06,163 --> 01:33:10,667
- I'm reading Dianetics.
- I don't blame you.

1258
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:17,507
Thank you for listening to me.

1259
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:21,469
- I feel like I should ask for penance.
- I don't do penance.

1260
01:33:22,638 --> 01:33:24,014
I do shots.

1261
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:37,402
I'll tell you what I know.

1262
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:40,530
May those who love us, love us.

1263
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,533
And those who don't love us,

1264
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,827
may God turn their hearts.

1265
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:50,582
If He cannot turn their hearts,
may He turn their ankles,

1266
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:53,793
so that we may know them
by their limping.

1267
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:57,964

(MELANCHOLIC SONG PLAYING)

1269
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:19,402
I'll tell you why I don't want
to know where you are

1270
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:25,408
I got a joke
I've been dying to tell you

1271
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:32,999
A silent kid is looking down the barrel

1272
01:34:33,292 --> 01:34:39,339
To make the noise that I kept so quiet

1273
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:44,386
Kept it from you, pitseleh

1274

MAN: Anna?

1275
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:57,148
Anna?

1276
01:34:57,942 --> 01:35:03,947
I'm not what's missing
from your life now

1277
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:10,328
I could never be the puzzle pieces

1278
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:17,961
They say that God makes problems
just to see what you can stand

1279
01:35:18,337 --> 01:35:24,134
Before you do as the devil pleases

1280
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:28,346
Give up the thing you love

(BEEPS)

1282
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:33,518
ANNA: Hey, Brian. It's me again.

1283
01:35:33,936 --> 01:35:39,566
Please call me, okay, Finn?
Brian, call Anna. Please to call.

1284
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:43,319
Seriously, I really want
to talk to you, okay? Bye.

1285
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:57,500
I remember I fell in love
with this girl in Prague, in 1968.

01:35:58,294 --> 01:35:59,335
(SIGHS)

1287
01:35:59,378 --> 01:36:02,005
She was beautiful, like Carole Lombard.

1288
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:05,592
She grabbed me in the alley
behind my church,

1289
01:36:05,676 --> 01:36:08,011
she pressed me against the wall,
she kissed me.

1290
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:12,515
I felt like Richard Chamberlain
in The Thorn Birds,

1291
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:14,601
in the barn with Meggie.

1292
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:18,855
I was so happy, I could die.

1293
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,651
Did anything happen between you?

1294
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:28,198
Not really. Flirtations, little moments.

1295
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:32,744
Soon after, the Russians invaded
and I moved to the United States.

1296
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:40,668
I'll tell you something.

1297
01:36:41,295 --> 01:36:45,548
If she had kissed me back,
I doubt I'd be sitting here right now.

1298
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:49,385
I would have given it all up.

1299
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:53,640
I mean, she didn't, but...

1300
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:57,268
I keep thinking about
what you said in the seminary,

1301
01:36:57,353 --> 01:37:00,396
about how the life of a priest is hard,

1302
01:37:00,439 --> 01:37:05,568
and if you think you'd be happy
doing anything else, you should do it.

1303
01:37:08,197 --> 01:37:11,908
That was my recruitment pitch,
which is not bad when you're starting

1304
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:14,953
because it makes you feel like a Marine.

1305
01:37:18,582 --> 01:37:24,963
The truth is, you can't tell yourself
there is only one thing you could be.

1306
01:37:25,047 --> 01:37:30,426
If you are a priest, or marry a woman,
it's the same challenge.

1307
01:37:32,054 --> 01:37:35,598
You cannot make a real commitment

1308
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:39,102
unless you accept that it is a choice,

1309
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:42,939
which you keep making
again and again.

1310
01:37:46,318 --> 01:37:52,240
I've been a priest over 40 years, and
I fell in love at least once a decade.

1311
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:56,786
You won't tell me
what to do here, will you?

1312
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:01,082
No. God will give you your answer.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1314
01:38:14,805 --> 01:38:17,307
- Hey.
- Hey.

1315
01:38:17,349 --> 01:38:19,017
How are you doing?

1316
01:38:22,605 --> 01:38:23,938
What's up?

1317
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:30,737
- You're probably still mad at me...
- Probably? No, I'm definitely still mad.

1318
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:34,991
Did you think you'd stroll over
and find me in a good mood?

1319
01:38:35,075 --> 01:38:37,577
No, I knew you'd still be mad at me.

1320
01:38:37,661 --> 01:38:41,331
What do you expect?
You should have just told me.

1321
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:45,835
I'd have been jealous
and said it would muck things up,

1322
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:48,004
but at least we'd still be friends.

1323
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:51,341
We're still friends, I hope!

1324
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:55,845
Friends don't lie to each other
and set each other up for humiliation.

1325
01:38:55,888 --> 01:39:00,725
That's why I'm here, I wanted
to apologize, if you'd let me talk!

1326
01:39:00,809 --> 01:39:04,354
I want to talk,
I've got things I want to vent.

1327
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:07,357
Talk, vent, come on! Go ahead, vent!

1328
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:11,069
Okay...

1329
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:18,534
Now I lost my momentum.
Go ahead, what do you want to say?

1330
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:24,540
I wanted to say that I handled
things badly, and I'm sorry.

1331
01:39:24,917 --> 01:39:27,126
You're my best friend.
Please forgive me.

1332
01:39:30,756 --> 01:39:33,716
- That was very simple and direct.
- Thank you.

1333
01:39:35,302 --> 01:39:39,681
You're lucky I am a priest.
Forgiveness comes with the job.

1334
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:41,933
You're a good priest.

1335
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:49,399
I got something for you.

1336
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:54,195
I almost didn't because I was
so mad at you, but this was too good.

01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:02,578
- It's the last of the series!
- You always talk about it.

1339
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:06,749
- It's in such good condition.
- It's mint. I had to get it.

1340
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:09,585
Brian!

1341
01:40:13,215 --> 01:40:14,549
Thank you.

1342
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:16,926
You're welcome.

1343
01:40:21,098 --> 01:40:24,267
As pissed off as I was, the weird thing is

1344
01:40:24,309 --> 01:40:28,771
I'm very sorry I didn't get
to see you two together.

1345
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:32,108
That would have made me happy,
in a weird way.

1346
01:40:32,234 --> 01:40:35,445
- Have you talked to her?
- No.

1347
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:38,990
Things are really strange
between us now.

1348
01:40:40,909 --> 01:40:43,911
Are you guys working this out?

1349
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:45,621
No, no.

1350
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:50,418
But that's offset by the fact
that I'm about to lose my job.

1351
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:52,170
Are you serious?

1352
01:40:53,297 --> 01:40:55,798
What a mess. I'm sorry.

1353
01:40:58,469 --> 01:41:01,554
I was starting to think
I had a few things figured out.

1354
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:03,806
JAKE: Yeah. Me, too.

1355

BRIAN: What happened?

1356
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:15,777
Hi.

1357
01:41:16,987 --> 01:41:20,323
I don't think I'm the person
to offer objective advice

1358
01:41:20,365 --> 01:41:22,617
on this particular confession.

1359
01:41:23,702 --> 01:41:24,869
Brian!

1360
01:41:25,996 --> 01:41:27,163
Brian.

1361
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:33,753
You don't have to say anything.
Just listen to me.

1362
01:41:33,837 --> 01:41:36,506
I'll just say one thing,
and then I will go away.

1363
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:42,261
You're my friend,
and whatever else is going on,

1364
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:48,684
I don't want you to think my feelings
for you relate to what I feel for Jake.

1365
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:51,145
That's not the problem, and you know it.

1366
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:57,819
I thought you wanted me

1367
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:01,531
and that affected me.

1368
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:08,371
Maybe that's not fair and
I'm reading all kinds of things wrong,

1369
01:42:08,455 --> 01:42:11,374
but it sure felt that way to me.

I don't know what to say.

1372
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:29,559
I've just been having
so much fun, and...

1373
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:34,564
I've had all of these feelings lately,

1374
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:39,110
and not just my feelings for Jake,
but this...

1375

Reconnecting with part of myself that
has been shut down for a long time.

1376
01:42:47,077 --> 01:42:50,121
If I indulged those feelings with you,

1377
01:42:50,205 --> 01:42:53,833
or if I took you for granted,
I am so sorry.

1378
01:42:55,502 --> 01:42:57,712
I can't bear that I hurt you.

1379
01:43:01,466 --> 01:43:06,262
It's not your fault.
I totally set myself up for this.

1380
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:09,599
I'll tell you something,

1381
01:43:09,683 --> 01:43:12,768
I don't know which feels worse,
having my heart broken

1382
01:43:12,811 --> 01:43:16,189
or doubting myself,
because of what that means for me.

1383
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:20,818
Don't you dare doubt yourself.
You have a gift, and you know it.

1384
01:43:21,528 --> 01:43:25,573
If you start doubting that because of me,
I don't know what I'd do to myself.

1385
01:43:26,408 --> 01:43:28,117
I don't doubt myself because of you.

1386
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:32,622
I feel at my best when I'm around you,
and that makes me doubt everything.

1387
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,921
I don't know what to do, Brian.
Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

1388
01:43:59,942 --> 01:44:03,319
Is it me, or is confession getting
a little touchy-feely these days?

1389
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:11,702
Thank you.

and the chairs are all set up.

1391
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:20,211
I sent the invitations
and we've got the karaoke machine.

1392
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:23,756
Oh! No. We need the disks
for the karaoke.

1393
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:27,677

- It's all right, I'll do it now.

- A cell phone.

1395
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:34,350
- Since when?
- Anna gave it to me. Look.

1396
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:38,521
She put God on speed dial. I called it,
it's the Elvis Presley museum.

1397
01:44:42,859 --> 01:44:46,362
Sorry, I have to say this.
You know she's leaving next week?

1398
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:50,032
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, I'm just checking.

1399
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:53,619
- You guys have been talking?
- Yeah. We had a good talk.

1400
01:44:54,329 --> 01:44:55,871
- It's okay.
- Good.

1401
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:00,501
- Good.
- Sure you don't want to talk about this?

1402
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:04,505
I don't! Am I asking you
to talk about it? I don't want to.

1403
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:07,008
- I'd talk about it if I wanted to.
- Okay.

1404
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:12,930
- It's just that she's leaving...
- I know, what do you want me to do?

- Dr. Marx.

01:45:24,067 --> 01:45:28,237
- What happened?
- She had a transient ischaemic attack.

1410
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:32,241
- A what?
- It's an "almost" stroke.

1411
01:45:32,284 --> 01:45:34,368
What does that mean?

1412
01:45:34,411 --> 01:45:36,912
- A blockage of blood...
- Is she all right?

Mom, the doctor said
you must rest for two days...

1416
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:48,758
Get out of here!

I'll give them an ischaemic... Whatever.

I assume your brother
knows all about this?

Yeah, he's stuck in the Hamptons,
but he's checking in...

1420
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:11,781
Yeah. Okay, doesn't matter,
I'll be home by tomorrow.

- You know what, I need a coffee.

1425
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:34,303
- I'll get it.
- No, that's okay. You stay and talk.

1426
01:46:38,016 --> 01:46:41,644
- What happened?
- I don't want you to worry about this.

1427
01:46:41,686 --> 01:46:45,648
- It's fine, I've dealt with it.
- Dealt with what? How?

1428
01:46:45,690 --> 01:46:48,984
I dealt with it. It's over, and I don't...

Since Yom Kippur is the Super Bowl

1458
01:49:52,502 --> 01:49:58,716
most rabbis try to cram

or the status of Jews around the world.

as Jews, but as human beings.

I'll call when the board has decided.

1487
01:52:47,886 --> 01:52:50,220
Or you could stick around. Okay?

1488
01:53:15,538 --> 01:53:17,164
Come on. Come on!

1489
01:53:18,708 --> 01:53:20,709
- Yes? Yes!
- Yes!

1490
01:53:22,712 --> 01:53:24,463
Don't mess with me like that!

1491
01:53:28,384 --> 01:53:31,553
This is so fantastic. How does it feel?

1492
01:53:31,638 --> 01:53:33,180
It feels good.

1493
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:37,893
We've got a lot to celebrate tonight,
barring an interfaith rumble!

1494
01:53:37,977 --> 01:53:41,647
- It's definitely Manischewitz time.
- We have two cases.

1495
01:53:41,731 --> 01:53:46,318
- Did you get the disks from Don?
- No, I'm going to, don't worry.

1496
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:50,364
Not to rain on your parade,
but I had to say goodbye to Anna.

1497
01:53:51,407 --> 01:53:54,117
I know you don't want
to talk about it, but there it is.

1498
01:53:54,202 --> 01:53:56,703
There what is?
Come on, man, what are you doing?

1499
01:53:56,746 --> 01:53:58,831
What do you want me to do?
Flagellate myself?

1500
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:01,959
Jews don't do that. We plant trees.

1501
01:54:02,043 --> 01:54:06,797
Who's talking about feeling guilty?
I thought you'd wanna do something.

1502
01:54:06,881 --> 01:54:11,134
You're on such a roll right now.
What's holding you back?

1503
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:15,514
- You love her, don't you?
- Yes, I do, I just...

1504
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:20,686
- Sometimes that's not enough.
- Listen to what you're saying!

1505
01:54:20,770 --> 01:54:24,982
Not enough? There's nothing else
that's worth anything against that.

1506
01:54:25,775 --> 01:54:30,904
For years you've talked about how
much you want something like this,

1507
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:35,284
and when it comes, you walk away
over a few minor complications.

1508
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:39,621
What kind of plan is that?
You know how God works.

1509
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:45,335
Think He'll give you this a second
time 'cause you're on his crew?

1510
01:54:46,129 --> 01:54:47,796
Seriously, look at me.

1511
01:54:49,090 --> 01:54:52,467
As your friend, I'm telling you,
you're making this too complicated.

1512
01:54:53,344 --> 01:54:58,974
It's very simple. You love each other,
and she's leaving in two hours!

1513
01:54:59,809 --> 01:55:03,854
You need to ask yourself,
are you going to do anything or not?

1514
01:55:08,818 --> 01:55:10,193
Why are you standing here?

1515
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:15,157
- You're right! Why am I standing here?
- The sign hasn't changed.

1516
01:55:16,117 --> 01:55:18,785
This is New York City!
Who waits for a sign?

1517
01:55:18,828 --> 01:55:19,953
Cross the damn street!

1518
01:55:19,996 --> 01:55:23,290
Do we need signs to tell us
what to do? Cross the street!

1519
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:26,293
- I gotta go!
- Go, yes, go!

1520
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:29,046
- Brian, thank you!
- What happened to free will?

1521
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:33,926
Go! Go forth and prosper!

1522
01:55:40,266 --> 01:55:44,144
- Sir, may I help you?
- T-Bone, I gotta see Anna.

1523

I'm sorry, there's no answer.

1526
01:56:00,578 --> 01:56:04,539
T-Bone, look at me.
Don't you recognize me? It's Jake.

1527
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:09,169
- What is this in reference to?
- It's not in reference to anything!

1528
01:56:09,462 --> 01:56:12,923
Do me a favor.
This is very important to me.

1529
01:56:13,007 --> 01:56:16,843
Go and tell anybody
that Jake Schram is here, okay?

1530
01:56:16,928 --> 01:56:19,721
- I can't do that, sir.
- Help me out!

1531
01:56:19,764 --> 01:56:22,474
Come on, just two guys, T.

1532
01:56:24,143 --> 01:56:28,355
- Take me with you.
- I don't know where I'm going yet.

1533
01:56:28,564 --> 01:56:29,982
What's that?

1534
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:34,736
You're going to San Francisco
to lead the exciting life.

1535
01:56:34,904 --> 01:56:38,490
Don't tell anybody, but I need
a break from this exciting life.

1536
01:56:39,534 --> 01:56:41,535
- Really?
- Yeah, I do.

1537
01:56:41,828 --> 01:56:44,287
So, what are you packing there,
something like 280, 290?

1538
01:56:45,748 --> 01:56:47,708
- 320.
- Oh, 320.

1539
01:56:50,545 --> 01:56:51,670
Whoa!

1540
01:57:05,184 --> 01:57:08,562
Okay, okay... All right!

1541
01:57:08,604 --> 01:57:11,690
Next time, sir, I suggest
you make an appointment.

1542
01:57:11,774 --> 01:57:12,816
Ow!

1543
01:57:26,622 --> 01:57:30,959
No, seriously, a toast. To Anna.

1544
01:57:31,377 --> 01:57:33,587
- To Anna.
- ALL: Hear, hear.

1545
01:57:34,881 --> 01:57:37,758
- Thank you. I'll miss you guys.
- MAN: Yeah, right!

1546
01:57:38,092 --> 01:57:41,261
I'm going to miss a lot of things
around here,

1547
01:57:41,304 --> 01:57:44,890
like Len's endless
Howard Stern recountings.

1548
01:57:45,016 --> 01:57:48,310
And, of course, I'll miss
my Casanova boy across the way.

1549
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:51,021
- Hey, what is that?
- What?

1550
01:57:52,607 --> 01:57:55,984
- Oh, my God.
- Who is that?

1551
01:57:58,571 --> 01:58:00,739
- It's Jake.
- What's he doing?

1552
01:58:00,823 --> 01:58:02,074
I don't know.

1553
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:03,450
(MOUTHING) Pick up the phone!

1554
01:58:05,453 --> 01:58:09,706
- Anna Reilly.
- Anna, it's Jake. Can you see me?

1555
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:12,667
I can only see my reflection.

1556
01:58:12,710 --> 01:58:15,087
I see you, what are you doing?

1557
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:19,382
I tried to get up there, but it's like
the Pentagon with that T-Bone.

1558
01:58:19,509 --> 01:58:22,803
I decided to try Casanova here.
His name's Howard.

1559
01:58:23,012 --> 01:58:25,639
I've been thinking about some things,
I'd like to talk to you.

(STATIC WHINING)

1561
01:58:27,850 --> 01:58:31,061
- Am I on speakerphone?
- ALL: Hi, Jake!

1562
01:58:32,730 --> 01:58:34,606
- Hi.
- Go on.

1563
01:58:35,191 --> 01:58:39,611
- Can we talk? Can I come over?
- No, now is a good time.

1564
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:43,365
Okay. All right.

1565
01:58:43,866 --> 01:58:49,412
Listen, I've been thinking...
I just want you to know I'm sorry.

1566
01:58:49,497 --> 01:58:52,457
- And you were right.
- About what?

1567
01:58:52,542 --> 01:58:56,378
About everything. About us,
about me, especially about me.

1568
01:58:56,462 --> 01:58:59,631
- I acted like an idiot.
- What are you saying?

1569
01:58:59,799 --> 01:59:02,134
ALL: Yeah, what are you saying, Jake?

1570
01:59:03,678 --> 01:59:05,762
I'm saying that I love you.

1571
01:59:08,015 --> 01:59:09,516
I'm in love with you.

1572
01:59:10,893 --> 01:59:14,813
I've waited all my life for someone
like you, and I won't let you go.

1573
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:20,402
Please, don't go.
Anna, I don't want you to go.

1574
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:25,907
Could we get off the phone?

Somehow tonight

of mine

You're still a mystery

But there's something so easy
in how you're sweet to me

If everything glittering
will turn into the gold

02:05:26,685 --> 02:05:28,561
I want you taking

1637
02:05:28,938 --> 02:05:31,648
This heart

1638
02:05:33,025 --> 02:05:39,155
of mine

1639
02:05:42,284 --> 02:05:49,290
Heart of mine
