match that moment.

1322
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:17,090
it's everythingyou wait
a lifetime for.

1323
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:20,531
That dream finally come true.

1324
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:22,535
What else could ever come close?

1325
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:25,472
Except this, maybe.

1326
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:29,806
i did take a job at a club.
But teachingyoung kids
like my own, not old ladies.

1327
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:31,868
Yeah!
and i love it.

01:32:31,946 --> 01:32:34,813
i beatyou. i beatyou.
Rubbish. The bal I was in.
I t was definite-- Ow!

1329
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:36,816
Well, most ofthe time.

1330
01:32:38,586 --> 01:32:43,148
You see, a part ofme was always
afraid that my life would be over
ifi wasn't playing tennis.

1331
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,784
But the truth is, it was
reallyjust beginning.

1332
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:50,120
Oh, and by the way,
Lizzie did win the u.S. Open.

1333
01:32:50,197 --> 01:32:52,688
and Wimbledon.

1334
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:54,699
Twice.
