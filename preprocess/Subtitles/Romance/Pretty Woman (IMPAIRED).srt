[ Vivian ]
Listen, I've been calling you.

1450
01:41:01,715 --> 01:41:04,047
Yeah, I know. They told me
at the Banana you were lookin' for me.

1451
01:41:04,117 --> 01:41:06,108
You were supposed to come by Tuesday.
I left the money at the desk.

1452
01:41:06,186 --> 01:41:08,381
- I was hidin' from Carlos.
- Well, if you picked up the money,

1453
01:41:08,455 --> 01:41:12,084
- you wouldn't have to hide.
- I was busy. I had a life.
Nino got beat up.

1454
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:15,685
We had to visit him in the hospital,
Rachel got arrested. It was a mess.

1455
01:41:15,762 --> 01:41:20,028
Anyway, I got the money.
Thank you very much for saving my ass.
Now Carlos can get off of it.

1456
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,568
You know, he was talkin'
about you last night.

1457
01:41:22,636 --> 01:41:24,570
He would bust somethin'
if he saw you in this outfit.

1458
01:41:24,638 --> 01:41:28,870
I was afraid to hug you up there.
I might wrinkle you !

1459
01:41:28,942 --> 01:41:33,504
- You look really good.
No, something in the shade.
- Over there.

1460
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:36,208
You clean up real nice.

1461
01:41:36,283 --> 01:41:39,650
You sure don't fit in down
on the Boulevard lookin' like
you do, not that you ever did.

1462
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:43,211
Well, thanks, but it's easy
to clean up when you got money.

1463
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:46,191
Yeah.

1464
01:41:46,259 --> 01:41:49,888
- So, when does he leave ?
- Tomorrow.

1465
01:41:49,963 --> 01:41:53,592
- You get to keep the clothes ?
- Yeah.

1466
01:41:53,667 --> 01:41:59,105
Edward asked me
if I wanted to see him again.

1467
01:41:59,172 --> 01:42:03,734
But I think, I think definitely no.
It's just another week, right ?

1468
01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:06,836
- "Definitely no."
- Yeah.

Oh, no.

What ?

01:42:11,217 --> 01:42:14,243
- I know this weepy look on your face.
- Oh, no, you don't !

1472
01:42:14,321 --> 01:42:16,846
- You fell in love with him.
- No. Kit, please. Stop it.

1473
01:42:16,923 --> 01:42:18,857
- You've fallen in love with him ?
- Kit !

1474
01:42:18,925 --> 01:42:22,019
- Did you kiss him ? On the mouth ?
- Uh, yeah, I did.

1475
01:42:22,095 --> 01:42:24,029
- You kissed him on the mouth ?
- I did. It was nice.

1476
01:42:24,097 --> 01:42:27,123
You fall in love with him,
and you kiss him on the mouth.
Did I not teach you anything ?

1477
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:31,534
Look, I'm not stupid, okay ?
I'm-- I'm not in love with him.

1478
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:34,072
I just-- I like him.

01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:36,108
You like him ?

1480

- Yeah.
- You definitely like him.

1481
01:42:40,647 --> 01:42:43,480
Well, he's not a bum.
He's a rich, classy guy.

1482
01:42:43,550 --> 01:42:46,644
- Who's gonna break my heart, right ?
- Oh, no. Come on.

1483
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:48,984
You don't know that.
Hey, he asked you, right ?

1484
01:42:49,055 --> 01:42:52,320
Maybe you guys could, like, um,
you know, get a house together.

1485
01:42:52,392 --> 01:42:54,451
Like, buy some diamonds
and a horse. I don't know.

1486
01:42:54,527 --> 01:42:57,553
Anyway, it could work.
It happens.

1487
01:42:59,499 --> 01:43:01,626
When does it happen, Kit ?

1488

When does it really happen ?
Who does it really work out for ?

1489

Did it work out for Skinny Marie
or Rachel ? No !

Those were very specific cases
of crackheads.

I just wanna know
who it works out for.

01:43:10,744 --> 01:43:13,679
You give me one example of somebody that
we know that it happened for.

- Name someone ?
- Yeah, one person
that it worked out for.

- You want me to give you
a name or something.
- Yeah.

Mr. Morse, you said this morning
you wished to speak to Mr. Lewis.

Mr. Lewis is now listening.

I've reconsidered my position
on your acquisition offer...

I'm not so concerned about me,
but the people who are working for me.

It's not a problem.
They'll be taken care of.

What is it you're after now,

Well, I no longer wish to buy
your company and take it apart.

But I don't want anyone
else to, either.

[Music] Pretty woman [Music]

1746
02:01:35,284 --> 02:01:37,309
[Music] Walkin' down the street [Music]

1747
02:01:37,386 --> 02:01:41,083
[Music] Pretty woman
The kind I like to meet [Music]

1748
02:01:41,157 --> 02:01:43,819
[Music] Pretty woman [Music]

1749
02:01:43,893 --> 02:01:47,590
[Music] I don't believe you
You're not the truth [Music]

1750
02:01:47,663 --> 02:01:52,327
[Music] No one could look
as good as you [Music]

1751
02:01:54,003 --> 02:01:55,937
[Music] Mercy [Music]

1752
02:01:58,941 --> 02:02:02,809
[Music] Pretty woman
won't you pardon me [Music]

1753
02:02:02,878 --> 02:02:06,609
[Music] Pretty woman
I couldn't help but see [Music]

1754
02:02:06,682 --> 02:02:09,344
[Music] Pretty woman [Music]

1755
02:02:09,418 --> 02:02:13,218
[Music] That you look lovely
as can be [Music]

1756
02:02:13,289 --> 02:02:17,123
[Music] Are you lonely
just like me [Music]

1757
02:02:19,161 --> 02:02:24,224
[Music] Oh, pretty woman [Music][Music]

1758
02:02:39,782 --> 02:02:44,185
[Music] You really took me
by surprise [Music]

1759
02:02:46,789 --> 02:02:51,988
[Music] You're someone
I've needed for a lifetime [Music]

1760
02:02:53,863 --> 02:02:57,492
[Music] Your heart
was cleverly disguised [Music]

1761
02:03:00,803 --> 02:03:05,536
[Music] And it didn't look that way
in my mind [Music]

1762
02:03:05,608 --> 02:03:08,634
[Music] Tell me
how could it be [Music]

1763
02:03:08,711 --> 02:03:12,977
[Music] I was the last to know [Music]

1764
02:03:13,049 --> 02:03:17,418
[Music] Darlin', I couldn't read
what was in your mind [Music]

1765
02:03:17,486 --> 02:03:21,013
[Music] To turn around and love me [Music]

1766
02:03:21,090 --> 02:03:24,082
[Music] With no [Music]

1767
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:27,061
[Music] Explanation [Music]

1768
02:03:27,129 --> 02:03:30,860
[Music] I gave you everything I have [Music]

1769
02:03:30,933 --> 02:03:34,892
[Music] I didn't know
that you would take it [Music]

1770
02:03:34,970 --> 02:03:39,998
[Music] With sweet consideration [Music]

1771
02:03:41,343 --> 02:03:45,439
[Music] And after all
that we've been through [Music]

1772
02:03:45,514 --> 02:03:48,677
[Music] I can't believe it's true [Music]

1773
02:03:48,751 --> 02:03:53,245
[Music] Until I hear you say [Music]

1774
02:03:59,528 --> 02:04:02,326
[Music] Ooh [Music]

1775
02:04:05,901 --> 02:04:09,496
[Music] I know now, now, now [Music]

1776
02:04:13,642 --> 02:04:16,941
[Music] Ah [Music]

1777
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:26,613
[Music] No explanation [Music]

1778
02:04:26,689 --> 02:04:30,318
[Music] I gave you everything I have [Music]

1779
02:04:30,392 --> 02:04:34,889
[Music] I didn't know
that you would take it [Music][Music]
