00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,606
Oh, shit. Isn't that the girl you hooked up
with at the Andersons' wedding?

460
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,153
- Oh, Jesus, I'm smoked.
- No, no, don't panic.

461
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:15,073
We're gonna do number 10
from the playbook. Here she comes.

462
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:19,661
Shlomo? I thought you were renouncing
all your possessions and moving to Nepal.

463
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,456
Shlomo, don't you remember me?

464
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,501
JOHN:
Oh, my God, you didn't hear.

465
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:30,171
I'm so sorry.
Shlomo had a scuba-diving accident.

466
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:34,092
Yeah, he came up too fast
and the oxygen deprivation...

467
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:37,387
Poor guy. He doesn't remember anyone,
even me, his own brother.

468
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,514
I'm just some nice guy
who helps him out.

469
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,100
You poor thing.

470
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,938
He can't hear anything either.
It's part of the accident.

471
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,690
So are you here
for the Clearys' wedding?

472
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,860
Oh, yes. Yes, but I have to leave.

473
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,405
- I've got a flight to Madrid.
JOHN: Oh, you have to leave?

474
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,365
- Yes.
JOHN: Oh, okay.

475
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,951
I could hang out for a few minutes.

476
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,206
Oh, actually that won't be necessary.

477
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:08,835
Shlomo would like me to take him to the
bathroom, then get him some crab cakes.

478
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,837
So, yeah, no, that's not...

479
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,297
Okay, okay.

480
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,092
Okay, I'll take you to get crab cakes first,
then I'll take you to the bathroom.

481
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:18,886
You know what?

482
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,348
Here's my number.
If there is anything I can do to help...

483
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,142
Okay.

484
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,477
Okay, have a safe flight.
Don't worry about us.

485
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,647
- We're gonna be fine, we're gonna make it.
- Okay.

486
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,567
Doctor.

487
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,153
She looked good.
I might give her a shout.

488
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,904
How? She thinks you're deaf.

489
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,366
Everyone wants to be part of a miracle.
I turned the corner, she's a part of it.

490
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,368
People helping people.
It's powerful stuff.

491
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,997
God, you're a sick man.
You also may be a genius.

492
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,999
Okay, so, what angle
are we gonna play here?

493
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,835
I'm gonna go with the balloon-animal
display for the kids...

494
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:54,005
...and then when she comes to
check it out, guess who's a broken man.

495
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,757
- Haunted past.
- Haunted past. Excellent.

496
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,884
- How about you?
- I'll dance with the flower girl.

497
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,011
Or be a charter member
of Oprah's Book Club.

498
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,847
- It's all deadly. I'll see you in a little.
- Yes.

499
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,142
Final touch. There it is.

One happy elephant.

501
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,606
All right. Who else wants something?

502
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,149
I want a bicycle.

503
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:17,111
A bicycle? Well, a bicycle,
that would take a lot of balloons...

504
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,405
...and Uncle Jeremy's
a little tired right now...

505
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,283
...so why don't we do something like,
let's say, a giraffe?

506
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,535
I just want a bicycle!

507
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,623
Why are you yelling at me?

508
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,084
Whatever. Make me a bicycle, clown.

509
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:41,594
I'm gonna make you a bicycle.
But I don't want to make you a bicycle.

510
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,596
Shut your mouth, funny guy,
and make it.

511
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:48,393
JOHN:
You got it.

512
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:52,730
There you go. Yeah, you got it.

513
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,952
Let's see how you do
with somebody your own age.

514
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,371
I think I'm up to the challenge.

515
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,289
All right, will you save me
a dance for later?

516
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,668
- Maybe.
JOHN: Ha, ha. Okay.

Go on, take it, you hyena.

519
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,309
Don't say thank you.

520
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,353
Hi. You're good.

521
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,440
That thing? I'm just warming up.
Last week I did a...

522
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,526
...exact replica to scale of Wrigley Field.
- Ha, ha.

523
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,028
Honest to God.
I don't have anywhere to put it.

524
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,947
Okay, then I'll take a sports car.

525
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:44,866
How about a dance?

526
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,826
That's what I really wanted.

[MUSIC ENDS
AND PEOPLE CLAPPING]

528
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,152
So how long have you
and the secretary been married?

529
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,863
- Thirty years next April.
- Oh, that's beautiful.

530
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,491
Yeah, and we were faithful
for two of them.

531
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,953
- Hm?
- Enjoy the party.

532
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,793
- Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.
CLEARY: Thanks.

533
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,592
Secretary Cleary, John Ryan.

534
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,886
- Hi, John.
- I just wanted to tell you how much...

535
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,890
...I enjoyed your position paper
on economic expansion in Micronesia.

536
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,184
You've read my position paper?

537
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,353
I read it while I was
sailing my boat to Bermuda.

538
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,021
A sailor?

539
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,941
- Good man, take a seat.
- Oh, thanks.

540
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,193
You didn't happen to catch my speech...

541
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,404
...on the Paraguayan debt
and money supply issue, did you?

542
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,740
Are you kidding me?
I thought it was great.

543
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:12,912
Your argument for the inverse ratio
of capitalization to debt was genius.

544
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,290
Now, if we can just get Congress
not to be so shortsighted.

545
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:20,628
Yes. Well put. "Shortsighted."

546
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:25,299
John, what do you say you and I head out
to the deck and light up a couple of cigars?

547
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,634
- Stogies?
- Yeah.

548
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,052
Why not?

549
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,806
It's just that we lost a lot
of really good men out there.

550
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,977
I'm sorry.

Gloria, I think I gotta
go get some fresh air.

552
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:43,818
Thank you so much for the dance
and it was wonderful to meet you.

553
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,614

CLEARY: John, you seem like an astute man.
JOHN: Thank you.

557
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,677
Maybe you can help
explain something to me.

558
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,471
See that young man
out there on the dock?

559
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,849
JOHN: Sure.
CLEARY: That's my son, Todd.

560
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:18,436
Twenty-two years old,
the whole world in front of him.

561
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,856
Every advantage in life,
advantages I never had.

562
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,733
Well, that's not exactly true.

563
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,361
He had the same advantages I had,
which is a hell of a lot of advantages.

564
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,031
So here's my question:

565
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,491
What's he got to be so morose about?

566
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,286
Maybe he hasn't found
something to believe in.

567
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,496
Oh, he says he believes in art.

568
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,624
But all I've seen him do...

569
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,878
...is dribble his own blood on a canvas
and smear it around with a stick.

570
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:46,714
- You know, some people call that art.
- It's crap.

571
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:51,886
What about having a public service,
an obligation to our fellow man?

572
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,305
Well, maybe he's...

573
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,849
Maybe he's just trying to find
his own way, his own path.

574
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,352
I mean, you cast a pretty big shadow.

575
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,814
Yeah.

576
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:07,610
Yeah. Yeah, perhaps...

577
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:10,321
...I should take it easier on him.

578
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,530
Perhaps.

579
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,909

Why would a man risk his own life

The great 19th century philosopher
Schopenhauer...

587
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:44,146
...he said, at that moment, when a human
sees another human in danger...

588
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:48,567
...that there's this breaking in
of metaphysical awareness.

589
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,570
Do you know what
that awareness is, Gloria?

590
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,281
- What?
- That we're all one.

591
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,453
That separateness is an illusion.

592
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,331
And that I'm one with everyone.

593
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:06,961
