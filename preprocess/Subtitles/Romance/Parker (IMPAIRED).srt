So...

1096

You let them steal something,

1097
01:14:34,864 --> 01:14:36,753
you steal it from them.

I help you

1099

You're going to
kill them, aren't you?

1101
01:14:52,704 --> 01:14:54,308
I never said that,
Leslie. You did.

you could tell me.

1109

But it's jewelry.

1110
01:15:23,944 --> 01:15:27,232
None of the stores I've
checked have the inventory.

1111
01:15:27,304 --> 01:15:28,351
How large?

1112
01:15:29,744 --> 01:15:31,394
Fifty to
seventy-five million.

LESLIE: Miriam Hope Clendon was the
first lady of Palm Beach Society.

1119
01:16:00,344 --> 01:16:02,631
She had more diamonds
than Elizabeth Taylor!

1120
01:16:02,704 --> 01:16:05,355
And when she died, she left the
entire estate to Palm Beach.

1121
01:16:05,424 --> 01:16:08,428
They're auctioning off her $75
million jewelry collection

1122
01:16:08,504 --> 01:16:10,552

What's behind there?

1124
01:16:12,784 --> 01:16:15,549
Thirty acres,
a golf course, pool,

1125
01:16:15,624 --> 01:16:17,513
tennis courts, two ballrooms,

1126
01:16:17,584 --> 01:16:20,633
and it's one of the only houses that's
on the ocean and the intracoastal.

1127
01:16:20,704 --> 01:16:23,275
Hey, Miss! This is

No, no, no. That's too much white.

1130
01:16:31,184 --> 01:16:33,346
Take them away and bring
back some pink roses.

1131
01:16:34,504 --> 01:16:37,474
And just what is this now?
Speakers for the auctioneer.

Do you ever feel bad
about what you do?

1145
01:17:33,344 --> 01:17:35,073
Everyone steals, Leslie.
