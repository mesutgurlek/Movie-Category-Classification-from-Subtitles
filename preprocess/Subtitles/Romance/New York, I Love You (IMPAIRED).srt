You going to go to--

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,667
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
Uh, yeah. Sorry.

3
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,367
Going to Williamsburg.
North 6th and Wythe.

4
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:12,367
Do you mind?
I'll just hang onto you.

5
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,234
Can you just drop me off
at Williamsburg Bridge?

6
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:16,534
That's fine because I'm headed
into the Bowery. Do you mind?

7
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,200
All right, that's fine.
We'll just split a fare.

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,667
Two stops.
Yeah. Chamber Street.

9
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:22,167
Just take the FDR--
No, no, not FDR Drive.

10
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,200
Not Chamber Street. No.
Oh, my God.
If you take FDR Drive,

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,567
first of all,
it's more of a fare.
I do this every single day.

12
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,234
It's an extra 20 minutes.
I got to be somewhere.

13
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:29,701
Take the FDR Drive, please.
It's a lot faster.

14
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:31,567
I think we can hang down
the West Side Highway

15
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,567
and make a left
on Chamber Street.

16
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,400
There's no point, though.
There's going to be--

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,667
Bleecker, guys.
We're going Bleecker.

18
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,868
No, we both want
to go to the same area.

19
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:41,133
Bleecker's going to take
an extra hour.

20
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:43,334
Bleecker Street is totally
out of the direction.
That's ridiculous.

21
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:45,067
Both of you, out of the cab.

22
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:47,501
Wait a second.
Calm down, man.

23
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:50,334
We're not going to get out.
We'll share the same rate.
We're not going to Bleecker.

a lot of boyfriends.

Always left them.

Every time she'd leave
a man, though,

she'd keep something,
like a souvenir.

Maybe a book or a necklace
or a painting.

When she left my dad,
she kept me.

"Don't use CliffNotes
or Wikipedia.

325
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:40,234
Just read them." So fine.

326
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:43,067
I'm on a bench in Central Park
with The Brothers Karamazov.

327
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,634
800 pages, and I'm page 22.

328
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:47,934

 Ouch.

 Bless you.

331
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:56,534
Thanks.

332
00:19:56,534 --> 00:19:58,601
 What? What's wrong?

333
00:19:58,601 --> 00:20:01,968
I can see the Dakota.
 Hmm.

334
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,400
John Lennon...is my god.

335
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,901
You know his song "Mother"?
 Yeah.

336
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:09,667
I was a kid
the first time I heard that.

337
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,267
Why can't I write
a song like "Mother"?

338
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:14,033
Oh, I just
sent you a picture.

339
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:15,534
 Oh, my God.

340
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:17,234
 Is that John Lennon
 standing behind you?

341
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:19,634
What?
 I'm just kidding.

342
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:23,200
I have no idea
what you look like, Camille.

343
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,567
 Hmm.

344
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,267
Send me a picture.

345
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,868
 No. No way.

346
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,801
Is that what you look like?

347
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,501

[David]
There are 1,784 pages,

350
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,534
and it takes me four minutes
to read one page.

351
00:20:55,534 --> 00:20:58,834
1,784 pages times
four minutes a page

352
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:01,634
is 7,136 minutes,

353
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:04,200
which equals 118.9333 hours,

354
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
which comes to 4.955 days.

355
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,100
But you can round it off
to five days without sleeping.

356
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,901
It's impossible. I quit.

357
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,200
I quit.

 [David on machine]
 Please leave a message
 after the beep.

365
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:41,567
[beep]

366
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:46,167
 Hey, David. It's Camille.

367
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:50,133
 You know, when Dostoyevsky
 was writing The Gambler,

368
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,067
 he signed a contract
 with his publisher

369
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:55,567
 saying that he would
 finish it in 26 days.

370
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,167
 And he did it,

371
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:00,567
 but he had the help
 of this young stenographer.

372
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:04,901
 This girl--
 she stayed with him,
 and she helped him.

373
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:07,567
 And afterwards,

374
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:10,100
 they actually got married.

375
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,434
 [chuckles]
 Isn't that cool?

376
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:14,834
 That's how he met his wife.

377
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,367
 Anyway, I found this story

378
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:18,367
 in the preface
 for Crime and Punishment.

379
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:21,734
 So I was thinking that--

380
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:24,634
 And this would have to be
 between you and me.

381
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:28,834
 But I was thinking that
 I could read the books

382
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:30,834
 and tell you
 what's going on.

383
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:33,767
 That way, you could just
 focus on your music.

384
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:35,567
 But only if you're
 comfortable with this.

385
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:38,334
 And if you're not, you know,
 we can just forget it,

386
00:22:38,334 --> 00:22:40,167
 and you can quit.

387
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:43,367
 But if you are,

388
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:46,434
 then open this door.

389
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:51,100
Open...this door?

390
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,901
Okay, a deal's a deal.

391
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:27,133
Does this mean
we're getting married?

392
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:30,667
I have a lot of reading to do.

393
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:38,200
Hi. I'm Camille.

394
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,467
Hi. I'm David.

395
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,667
[phone rings]

396
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:19,767
Hello?

397
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,467
Where?

398
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,601
Thank you.

399
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:44,033
That was kind of a powerful,
intimate situation.

400
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,701
What was intimate?

401
00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:49,400
Just now. Just-- We...

402
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,200
Sharing the flame.

403
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,467
I mean, that was--
that was intimate.

404
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:54,601
If you say so.

405
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:55,901
Oh, come on now.

406
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,467
You know what I'm
talking about.

407
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:59,234
Our hands almost touched.

408
00:25:59,234 --> 00:26:02,334
I looked at you, and you
lifted your head up slowly,

409
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,567
and our eyes met.

410
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,434
It was-- It was--
It was intense,

411
00:26:05,434 --> 00:26:06,834
and it was intimate.

412
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:10,033
Wow. Stop it.
I feel naked.

413
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:12,067
Yeah, well, you know what?
I have that effect on women.

414
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:14,234
I mean, not all women.
No, not all women.
[laughs]

415
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:16,334
But it has happened before,
so don't be alarmed.

416
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:19,334
Yeah, I bet.
Yeah. Don't ignore
what's happening here.

417
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:21,234
We're having some kind
of powerful, weird alchemy,

418
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:23,133
and you have to pay attention
when that happens.

419
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:26,300
This stuff is not
to be treated lightly.

420
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,033
Listen, I actually
just came out here

421
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,634
to have a cigarette,
okay?

422
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:31,968
And relax and do my thing.
Okay. No. Sure.
Sure. Yeah.

423
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:34,000
So, uh,
maybe another time.

424
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,667
Yeah. But there may not
be another time. Okay?

425
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,000
I may never get
this chance again.

426
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,701
I mean, we may never,
you know,

427
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:42,133
be able to return
to this-- this moment.

428
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,968
Well, then, you should know
that I'm married and happy.

429
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:48,167
Right. Uh-huh.
And where is he?

430
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,634
Huh? Huh?

431
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:52,133
He leaves you out here alone,
in the dark, without a light.

432
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:54,567
I'm not feeling that.
Well, he doesn't smoke, so--

433
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:57,033
But you love him anyway.
Yeah. Why not?

434
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:00,067
Sure. Sure.
He just abandons you, huh,

435
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:03,334
to your mortal disease,
and leaves you alone to suffer

436
00:27:03,334 --> 00:27:05,467
and die, when he's in there
pretending to love you?

437
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:08,000
I don't respect this guy.
I think he's a coward.

438
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,200
I think he's selfish.
And forgive me for saying this,

439
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,868
but I think any moment now,
this guy's gonna open up
his real self to you,

440
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:15,200
and it's gonna be all--
[roars]

441
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,067
like, scary stuff's
gonna come out.

442
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:18,400
You know,
I felt it right away.

443
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,400
I felt it right away--
that I think--

444
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,200
I'm gonna say something
a little bold here.

445
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,868
But I think you might
be married to the wrong person.

446
00:27:25,868 --> 00:27:28,501
I don't know that
even if that were true

447
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:30,534
that I'd tell you.
Right.

448
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:32,667
We're not exactly friends.
No, we're not.

449
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:33,968
No.
That's true.

450
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:35,534
But we did share a flame.
Right?

451
00:27:35,534 --> 00:27:37,100
Speaking of.
Oh.

452
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,901
See? Look at that.
See? You need me.

453
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:40,901
You're walking away,
and you need me.

454
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:44,133
We share a flame.
Thousands of tiny molecules
are heating up right now.

455
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:45,501
They're penetrating
our brain.

456
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:47,534
They're stimulating
our sexual desire.

457
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:50,334
I don't know about you,
but I find that shit
very romantic.

458
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:52,133
And I'm so glad
you walked over here

459
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:54,133
because now I can feel
a little bit more comfortable

460
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:56,467
to tell you
that I happen to be,

461
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,434
uh, on the forefront
of men

462
00:27:58,434 --> 00:28:01,501
able to find and locate
a woman's G-spot.

463
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:03,434
And I could
do that for you.

464
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:05,234
That's really generous
of you. Thank you.

465
00:28:05,234 --> 00:28:08,901
It's my pleasure.
Well, it's your pleasure.

466
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:10,834
And what makes you think
I haven't located it yet?

467
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:12,901
Um, the way you hold
the cigarette.

468
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,200
It's a little high
and tight, you know?

469
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,033
What you have to do
is you have to lower it.

470
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:20,901
You have to bring it
all the way down in there
so it just sits comfortably.

471
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,234
It rests there.
If it's high
and tight like that,

472
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,934
the whole body
gets restricted,

473
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:27,334
and the plexus
gets closed off,

474
00:28:27,334 --> 00:28:30,434
you know, and the vagina
gets locked.

475
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:33,634
Look, I just happen to know
this crazy, weird technique
with the vagina.

476
00:28:33,634 --> 00:28:35,701
It's kind of cool,
and I thought
you'd be interested.

477
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:37,234
But you have to
be prepared.

478
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:39,501
You know what I mean?
Preparation is the key.

479
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:42,767
I mean, it starts
with a little walk.
Just a short walk, like...

480
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:44,334
You know, like, to, uh--
like my apartment.

481
00:28:44,334 --> 00:28:47,334
It's a couple blocks from here.
And we would walk,

482
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:50,400
and I would tell you
a few little elegant,
classy jokes.

483
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,634
You know, kind of getting us

484
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:53,701
a little giggly,
a little silly.

485
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:57,667
You know? And then we'd share
a glass of Burgundy.
Burgundy?

486
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:58,968
Yeah.

487
00:28:58,968 --> 00:29:01,634
We'd bask
in the warm, gentle,

488
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:03,767
romantic yet erotic
glow

489
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:05,901
of, uh, my spacious loft.

490
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:08,667
And then
I would undress you,

491
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,400
and you would undress me.

492
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,334
We'd stand naked before
each other, and we'd kiss.

493
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,901
I find-- I find kissing
a very helpful,

494
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,167
sweet way to-- to relax.

495
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,901
And then, maybe I would--
I would--

496
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:21,467
I would bite your neck
a little bit.

497
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:24,267
Not-- Not hard. Just gentle--
gentle little nibbles,

498
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:26,467
like-- like a little kitty cat,
you know?

499
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:29,167
And then--
And then you would feel

500
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,167
my hands kind of descend
to your lower region,

501

kind of, uh,
finding their way,

massaging the skin
around your clitoris,

503
00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:41,067
which would even
stimulate the arousal
even more.

504

I'm whispering

delicate little poems
in your ear, you know?

506

from your body

to the wet internal walls,

would slide effortlessly--

You're a comedian.

No. I, uh--

Yeah, kind of.

 Central Park covers
 almost 843 acres.

 It is 6% of Manhattan.

641
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:55,534
 There are also 127,000
 Method actresses in New York,

00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:58,133
 which is 2%
 of the population.

643
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:00,901
 And on the night
 of my senior prom,

644
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:02,901
 these two elements
 came together

645
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:06,634
 to make one perfect wish
 come true.

 but when?

669
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:46,534
 When we said goodbye?

670
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:48,734
 Oh, yeah.
 It was at the bar.

671
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:51,467
 [scoffs]
 I didn't realize we were
 gonna go home together

 I'm only gonna have
 two drinks tonight.

 I'm not gonna
 have sex with him.
 I don't want to.

 I really don't.

679
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,567
 God, I had no intention

680
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,801
 of going home
 with him or anyone.

681
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:13,801
 When he sat down next to me,
 it was so clear

682
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:17,400
 we weren't each other's style
 that it wasn't even weird.

683
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,567
 And since there was no vibe,
 we just started talking

 without thinking anything,

685
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:24,934

 what happened.

 It's a bad idea

 She's not a girl.

 I have no idea
 how old she is,

 but she's not a fucking girl.

 Why am I walking
 30 blocks to this bar?

00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,634
 I'm not in a good space
 for this.

692
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:42,000
 Yeah, she was beautiful.
 Yes, she had a great body,
 and she's smart.

693
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,868
 Was she even drunk?
 I don't even know.

694
00:40:43,868 --> 00:40:46,067
 I don't even know what she was.
 Does it really matter?

695
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:48,234
 Ow. Am I imagining things,
 or is my dick itching?

696
00:40:48,234 --> 00:40:50,968
 No, no, no.
 It's just these pants.

 when I came home.

 I'm sure he found that
 really attractive

 yammering about myself.

 excited when we got home.

 the rest of the night
 after that.

 for it to go.

01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,734
Beach in the Hamptons.

1129
01:23:00,734 --> 01:23:02,567
That's where we met,
and you hated the Hamptons.

1130
01:23:02,567 --> 01:23:04,567
I'm talking about
a road trip,

1131
01:23:04,567 --> 01:23:08,267
or a canoe trip, even.
A bike trip.

1132
01:23:08,267 --> 01:23:10,300
Will you stop
with the phone?

1133
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:15,334
Just name one.

1134
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:16,367
Exactly.

1135
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:19,467
What?

1136
01:23:19,467 --> 01:23:21,701
If you could go
anywhere in the world,

1137
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:24,667
where would you go?

1138
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:27,467
You know where.

1139
01:23:27,467 --> 01:23:29,601
Come with me.
What are you doing?

1140
01:23:29,601 --> 01:23:32,734
I just bought tickets.
We're leaving now.

1141
01:23:35,334 --> 01:23:36,434
We are?

1142
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,133
Are you out of your mind?

1143
01:23:40,133 --> 01:23:41,601
I don't have anything
with me right now.

1144
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:43,834
Well, I will buy you
a toothbrush.

1145
01:23:43,834 --> 01:23:45,167
In Rome.

1146
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,267
Coach is fine.

1147
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:56,334
Lift your feet.

1148
01:23:56,334 --> 01:23:57,834
You don't lift
your feet.

1149
01:23:57,834 --> 01:23:59,167
I'm lifting my feet.

1150
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,501
No, you're shuffling.

1151
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:03,167
The doctor said
you should lift
your feet.

1152
01:24:03,167 --> 01:24:04,968
I'm lifting, I'm lifting.

1153
01:24:04,968 --> 01:24:08,634
You want you should fall down,
break your other hip?

1154
01:24:08,634 --> 01:24:12,167
At least then the pain would
be the same on both sides.

1155
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:16,200
Equal.
Everything always has to
be equal with you.

1156
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,667
I'm a democratic
sort of fellow.

1157
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:20,300
Well, see how
democratic you feel

1158
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,534
when you fall down
and break your other hip.

1159
01:24:22,534 --> 01:24:24,667
I'm not breaking any hips.

1160
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:27,868
Is there some place
you got to get to later?

1161
01:24:27,868 --> 01:24:30,000
What is your hurry?

1162
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,868
My hurry is
I want to get there
before next week.

1163
01:24:32,868 --> 01:24:34,868
At the rate you walk...

1164
01:24:34,868 --> 01:24:36,434
You want faster?

1165
01:24:36,434 --> 01:24:40,200
Divorce me and get yourself
a younger man.

1166
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,868
Tom Cruise, perhaps.

1167
01:24:42,868 --> 01:24:45,734
You think you're funny?

1168
01:24:45,734 --> 01:24:48,667
I do, as a matter of fact.

1169
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,234
Then what would you do,
Mr. Smarty-pants?

1170
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:53,534
Mr. I'm so independent,

1171
01:24:53,534 --> 01:24:56,767
I don't need any help
opening the pickle jar.

1172
01:24:56,767 --> 01:24:58,501
I got caught in a pickle.

1173
01:24:58,501 --> 01:25:03,200
You'd still be
putting on your jacket
if it wasn't for me.

1174
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,334
[horn honks]

1175
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:07,567
Go ahead, hit me,
why don't you?

1176
01:25:07,567 --> 01:25:09,667
Want to run me down?
[scoffs]

1177
01:25:09,667 --> 01:25:12,767
All the time, honking like
they own the place.

1178
01:25:12,767 --> 01:25:14,234
We could have driven.

1179
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:15,567
Who could have driven? You?

1180
01:25:15,567 --> 01:25:18,300
You're going to give me
a heart attack now?

1181
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,901
What's the good
of having a car

1182
01:25:19,901 --> 01:25:21,701
if I never get
to drive it?

1183
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:24,267
You can't drive.
You can't even
read the street sign.

1184
01:25:24,267 --> 01:25:26,267
I still have my license.

1185
01:25:26,267 --> 01:25:28,133
Only because
that girl at the DMV

1186
01:25:28,133 --> 01:25:29,267
took pity on you.

1187
01:25:29,267 --> 01:25:30,801
All that flirting
with her, oh.

1188
01:25:30,801 --> 01:25:32,467
It was embarrassing.

1189
01:25:32,467 --> 01:25:35,067
Brighton Beach Avenue.

1190
01:25:35,067 --> 01:25:37,734
As if you didn't know
what street this was.

1191
01:25:37,734 --> 01:25:40,234
I know what street this is.
Of course you know
what street this is.

1192
01:25:40,234 --> 01:25:43,934
You think I don't know
what street this is?
Did I say you didn't?

1193
01:25:43,934 --> 01:25:46,601
I was reading the street sign.

1194
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:49,267
A regular Evelyn Wood
I married.

1195
01:25:49,267 --> 01:25:51,400
Hurry up, it's green.

1196
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,868
The light's going to change.

1197
01:26:19,667 --> 01:26:21,467
Step up.

1198
01:26:23,968 --> 01:26:25,300
Okay.

1199
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,834
You sure?
We're not in any rush.

1200
01:26:27,834 --> 01:26:29,968
I said I'm okay.

1201
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:35,667
Don't walk so fast.

1202
01:26:35,667 --> 01:26:38,133
I don't want to have to
call an ambulance.

1203
01:26:38,133 --> 01:26:42,000
I don't want to think about
trying to make that cell phone
she sent us work.

1204
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,701
Did you call her?

1205
01:26:43,701 --> 01:26:44,968
She called me.

1206
01:26:44,968 --> 01:26:46,868
What did she say?
What do you think she said?

1207
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:50,334
"How are you? How is Dad?
What are you doing?"

1208
01:26:50,334 --> 01:26:52,801
And what did you
say to her?

1209
01:26:52,801 --> 01:26:56,000
I told her we're doing
the same thing we do
every year.

1210
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,501
Good.

1211
01:26:57,501 --> 01:27:00,667
She said she sent us
a card, and did we get it.

1212
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:03,501
Did we get a card?
Did you see any card?

1213
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:07,033
Maybe it just
didn't get here yet.

1214
01:27:07,033 --> 01:27:08,300
She probably sent it late.

1215
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,367
Don't criticize.
I'm not criticizing.

1216
01:27:11,367 --> 01:27:12,701
You are criticizing.

1217
01:27:12,701 --> 01:27:14,467
I'm just saying,
she probably forgot

1218
01:27:14,467 --> 01:27:16,200
and then remembered
at the last minute.

1219
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,367
You wait and see.

1220
01:27:17,367 --> 01:27:19,000
The postmark
will be yesterday,

1221
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,033
as if it could get here
from France in one day.

1222
01:27:24,033 --> 01:27:25,701
Where are you going?

1223
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:27,300
I don't want
to take the ramp.

1224
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,033
Well, the ramp is easier.

1225
01:27:29,033 --> 01:27:30,200
I'll take the stairs.

1226
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,934
You're going to kill me.
[sighs]

1227
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:38,734
Today of all days, he decides
he'll finally kill me--

1228
01:27:38,734 --> 01:27:41,067
Do away with me by making me
take the stairs.

1229
01:27:41,067 --> 01:27:43,434
Give me a heart attack,

1230
01:27:43,434 --> 01:27:46,133
just watching you
take the stairs.

1231
01:27:46,133 --> 01:27:49,067
They have smart police
these days,

1232
01:27:49,067 --> 01:27:51,701
like the cute one on CSI.

1233
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,400
They'll figure it out.

1234
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,734
It'll make headlines--

1235
01:27:56,734 --> 01:28:02,067
Man kills wife
on 63rd anniversary,

1236
01:28:02,067 --> 01:28:05,801
walking up stairs.
[grunts]

1237
01:29:21,834 --> 01:29:22,968
[wheels rattle over boardwalk]

1238
01:29:25,033 --> 01:29:26,133
Hey, hey!

1239
01:29:26,133 --> 01:29:27,167
Hoodlums!

1240
01:29:27,167 --> 01:29:31,033
 They ought to arrest them.

1241
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:33,167
Let's go have lunch.

1242
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:34,167
Let's go. Come on.

1243
01:29:34,167 --> 01:29:35,334
Let's go.

1244
01:29:35,334 --> 01:29:36,968
I'm coming,
I'm coming.

1245
01:29:38,167 --> 01:29:39,501
Lift your feet.

1246
01:29:39,501 --> 01:29:40,968
I'm lifting.
No, you're shuffling.

1247
01:29:40,968 --> 01:29:44,033
Lift your feet. Lift.
I'm lifting, I'm lifting.

1248
01:29:44,033 --> 01:29:44,968
All right. Come on.

1249
01:29:47,167 --> 01:29:51,000
I fixed your hat
a little bit.

1250

You're looking okay
with your hat.

01:29:53,067 --> 01:29:54,000
Yeah.

I look terrible.

I don't understand
what happened.

01:30:37,234 --> 01:30:41,167
Happened. What happened?
