00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:28,230
- Archie and Jughead were lovers.
- Shut the fuck up !

150
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,600
It's true. Archie was the bitch,
and Jughead was the butch.

151
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:36,198
That's why Jughead wears
that crown-lookin' hat all the time.

152
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:39,334
He the king of
Queen Archie's world.

153
00:11:39,411 --> 00:11:41,345
Man, I feel
a hate crime comin' on.

154
00:11:41,413 --> 00:11:43,745
Well, you know,
he does have a point.

155
00:11:43,815 --> 00:11:45,908
I mean, Archie never did quite
settle on Betty or Veronica.

156
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:49,010
'Cause he wanted them both
at the same time, you assholes !

157
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:52,454
He didn't choose one, because he was
trying to get them into a three-way.

158
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:55,891
- Here.
- What ?

159
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,919
I want you to go down to the corner
store and buy yourself a clue.

160
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:02,398
- Go on.
- Eat it, Urkel.

161
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:05,561
Uh ! I done told you to
watch it with that Urkel shit.

162
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:08,697
Face it, girl.
Archie's a sister.

163
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:15,573
- That's it. You !
- Moi ?

164
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:19,515
Yeah, you. You are marching
back across the street with me,

165
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:22,280
and we're gonna pick up
a shitload of Archie books.

166
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:25,255
And I'm going to prove to you
beyond the shadow of a doubt...

167
00:12:25,323 --> 00:12:27,848
that Archie
is all about pussy.

168
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:29,826
- Come on !
- [ Laughs ]

169
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:32,158
This boy is conflicted.

170
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:36,122
I shall play
mother therapist for him.

171
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:39,432
You two sit tight.
We shall return promptly.

172
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:45,174
Is he always like that ?

173
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:48,508
Who, him ? Yeah.
Ever since the third grade.

174
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,572
This, uh, this nun was teaching us
about the Blessed Trinity, you know ?

175
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:54,675
She was going on and on about
the three persons in one God thing.

176
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,778
Father, Son,
the Holy Spirit.

177
00:12:56,855 --> 00:13:00,518
Banky just goes ballistic on her.
They got in this huge fight.

178
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:04,187
An eight-year-old kid ?
How bad could it have been ?

179
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:07,288
Well, have you ever seen a nun call
a small child a "fucking cunt-rag" ?

180
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:10,357
It wasn't pretty.
Shit like that's bound to happen...

181
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:13,404
when you make a kid wear
a matching tie and slacks every day.

182
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:17,840
Right. And your parochial
school misadventures ?

183
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:21,675
Oh, mostly limited to
wine-tasting prior to mass.

184
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:24,271
Turned me into a grade school
alcoholic altar boy though.

185
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:26,476
Can't tell you how many mornings
after serious benders...

186
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:28,917
I'd wake up next
to strange priests.

187
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:31,820
- Aren't you the sharp wit ?
- Sharp ? No.

188
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,882
I'm just a fan of
clergy-molestation humor.

189
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,987
Probably why the extended family quit
inviting me to first communion parties.

190
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:44,793
Tsk. You play darts ?

191
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:49,465
Uh, not professionally.
You know, only in bars.

192
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,736
[Alyssa]
I don't know.

193
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,803
Maybe I should just sign one of those
exclusive deals like you guys.

194
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,814
Your new book seems
to be selling like mad.

195
00:13:57,882 --> 00:14:02,615
Well, it all goes back to somethin'
my grandmother told me when I was a kid.

196
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:06,987
" Holden," she said, "the big bucks
are in dick and fart jokes."

197
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:09,390
- She was a churchgoer.
- Oh !

198
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:13,454
The cry from the heart of a real artist
trapped in commercial hell,

199
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:15,965
pitying his good fortune.

200
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:19,401
I'm sure you can dry your eyes
on all those fat checks you rake in.

201
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:23,567
Oh, I'm sorry. What was that ? Did I
detect a note of bitter envy in there ?

202
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:26,508
No, I'm happy my stuff
gets read at all.

203
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:28,773
There's very little market
for hearts and flowers...

204
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:32,977
in this spandex-clad, big pecs,
big tits, big guns field.

205
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:36,145
If I sell two issues,
I feel like John Grisham.

206
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:38,189
Well, it's all
about marketing.

207
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:43,284
Over- or underweight guys that don't
get laid. They're our bread and butter.

208
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:46,592
People like those two outside
should be yours.

209
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:49,599
And sadly, there are more
of our core audience.

210
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:53,262
Kind of gives you a charge though.
See two people like that in love.

211
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:55,636
And all over
Banky's car, no less.

212
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:58,403
You know, that car's seeing more action
right now than it's seen in years.

213
00:14:58,476 --> 00:15:03,140
- Bubbly guy. It's hard to figure out.
- Yeah.

214
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:06,342
You gotta respect that kind of display
of affection. You know what I mean ?

215
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:08,977
Sure, it's crazy.
It's rude. It's self-absorbed.

216
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:12,284
But, uh, you know,
it's love.

217
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:15,326
- It's not love.
- Oh, says you.

218
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:18,385
That out there ?
That's fleeting.

219
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:21,591
- Fleeting ?
- Mm-hmm. Well, l gotta split.

220
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:25,295
It was really nice meeting you.
Good luck with your book.

221
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,205
Tell Hooper I'll call him later.
And... tell your friend to calm down.

222
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,314
[Hooper]
Shut up already.

223
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:41,113
You shut up !
You're insane.

224
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:43,949
Archie is not fucking
Mr. Weatherbee !

225
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:47,480
Deny, deny, deny.

226
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:51,552
- Where's Alyssa ?
- She left, said she'd call you later.

227
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:54,291
Look, he's just offering to help Archie
with his fuckin' homework !

228
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:56,663
Read between
the lines, bitch.

229
00:15:56,734 --> 00:16:00,033
Fuck this. Let's go.
Traffic.

230
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:02,664
- Holden !
- What ?

231
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,836
- Let's go !
- See that dent in the hood of your car?

232
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,708
Son of a bitch !

233
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:16,211
Let me guess.
You like her.

234
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:18,687
- Who ?
- Miss Alyssa Jones.

235
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:25,256
- She's all right.
- As long as that's all.

236
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:27,694
 [Rap, Indistinct]

237
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:52,689
This is one of the best streetlights
you've ever drawn.

238
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:54,884
It's the one from across the street
from the post office.

239
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,723
- Looks just like it.
- Thanks.

240
00:16:57,795 --> 00:17:01,231
So, uh, what do you want
to do tonight ?

241
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:04,700
I don't know. Get a pizza.
Watch Degrassi Junior High.

242
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:07,499
You got a weird thing
for Canadian melodrama.

243
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:10,200
I got a weird thing
for girls who say "a boot."

244
00:17:10,274 --> 00:17:14,506
- [ Phone Rings, Beeps ]
- Bank Holdup.

245
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,778
Hooper here. Listen, I know how
you 'burb fiends hate the city,

246
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:23,252
but there's a club shindig goin' down
tonight I think you'd really get into.

247
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:27,155
- Where is it ?
- Meow Mix. I'm temping as barkeep.

248
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:30,388
Oh, I don't know, Hoop.

249
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:33,294
We're prepping the next issue. We got
that stupid meeting in the morning.

250
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:36,299
- I told her you wouldn't be interested.
- Told who ?

251
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:39,331
Alyssa.

252
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:41,372
Alyssa from last night Alyssa ?

253
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:43,771
How do you begin and end a question
with the same word like that ?

254
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:46,776
You got skill.
Yes, that one !

255
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:49,278
She asked me to invite you.
Now, here's the part where you say--

256
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:54,717
- I'll be there.
- Thought so. 1 0:00. Later.

257
00:17:54,786 --> 00:18:00,019
- Who was that ?
- Hooper. He invited me to a club.

258
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:03,720
Man, when's that faggot gonna learn ?
You like chicks.

259
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:06,855
- Not that kind of club.
- So when we leavin' ?

260
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:11,061
We ? You can't go.
He's hookin' me up with Alyssa.

261
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:14,536
- And ?
- And I don't want you messing it up.

262
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:17,972
I care about your shit.
Maybe I'll hook up myself.

263
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:20,340
I told you. It's not
that kind of club.

264
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:24,506
How does one man
get to be so funny ?

265
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:28,985
Look, how you gonna get
home when I hook up, huh ?

266
00:18:29,053 --> 00:18:33,456
- Like that'll happen.
- Let me explain, my witless chum.

267
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:35,856
The other night, we two,
Alyssa and I,

268
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:38,361
we, uh, well,
we shared a moment.

- Oh, you had a moment.
- No.

270
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:44,496
We shared a moment,
all right ?

271
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:50,007
And in that moment, one thing
was made abundantly clear.

272
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:53,510
This girl loves me,
my friend.

273

what I'm sayin' ?

274

 Ah, who's your daddy now

Go, Sheila, It's your birthday

All right.
Bring on the free hootch.

280
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,595
Free? I didn't invite your tired ass.
So, where's your better half?

281
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,764
Takin' a piss. The guy's got
a bladder like an infant.

282
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,638
That's funny. He says
you're hung like an infant.

283
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,406
Does his mother
tell him everything ?

284
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:31,209
- Hey !
- What'd you do, fall in love ?

285
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:33,302
- Where is she ?
- Over there.

286
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:38,463
Look at her in her net shirt. Been
dancin' for an hour. Hasn't stopped yet.

287

She ain't no Deney Terrio,
I'll say that.

288
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,546
Listen, if I'm not back by Tuesday,
call my mother. All right ?

00:19:45,614 --> 00:19:49,277
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's somethin' you should know.

00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:52,013
- She got a boyfriend ?
- Well, no.

- Get outta here ! I'm from Highlands !
- I know. Hooper told me.

How is it that we never
ran into one another ?

- Did you graduate from Hudson ?
- Yeah, '88.

- Eton preppy or Menlo Park ?

Oh, no. Here's the big test.

My best friend fucked
a dead guy in the bathroom.

to the 'burbs since my friend's funeral.

- Uh-uh. Another girl.

the other friend in the grave.

Two towns away from each other

who took off one day to draw
funny books or something.

But what a lot of people
don't know...

332
00:22:13,795 --> 00:22:16,730
is that she used to harbor
these delusions that she could sing,

and she used to subject us to throaty

to penetration, Banky.

My mother
brought me up to believe...

435
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:23,327
if I can't do something right,
I shouldn't do it at all.

436

Of course, my father told me she gave
lousy head, but that's beside the point.

No. I blame them.

Chicks never help you out.
They never tell you what to do, right ?

00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:41,243
And most oft hem are all self-conscious
about the smell factor.

And, so, most of the time, they just lay
there frozen like a deer in headlights.

00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,484
I mean, not for nothin',
but when a chick goes down on me,

443
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,653
I let her know where to go
and what the status is.

00:29:51,728 --> 00:29:55,755
You gotta handle it like
CN N and the Weather Channel.

445
00:29:55,832 --> 00:29:57,959
Constant updates.

446
00:29:58,035 --> 00:30:00,196
- You are such an idiot.
- [ Growls ]

447
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,728
No, no, he's got a point.
I mean, that's how I was in high school.

448
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:07,436
You know, all nervous and
inhibited about being eaten out.

449
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:10,969
But by the time I got
to college, that all changed.

450
00:30:11,048 --> 00:30:13,141
I've loosenedup.

451
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:15,741
I was like one of those guys at
the airport with those big flashlights,

452
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:19,755
wavin' 'em this way, directin' 'em
that way, tellin' 'em when to stop.

453
00:30:19,823 --> 00:30:23,281
And that's all I'm sayin'. It would
be different if chicks helped out.

454
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,794
You know, pointed a guy
in the right direction.

455
00:30:25,862 --> 00:30:31,300
There'd be no bullshit, no wasted time
and no chance for permanent injuries.

456
00:30:31,368 --> 00:30:33,302
Permanent injuries ?

457
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,965
Sure. You wanna see
somethin' permanent ?

458
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,167
- See that ?
- Uh-huh.

459
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:42,006
I got that from Nina Rollins,
sophomore year.

460
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,013
I'm goin' down on her,
right ?

461
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:46,311
- [ Moaning ]
- Out of now here, her cat jumps on her.

462
00:30:46,383 --> 00:30:51,787
She does this big pelvic thrust, cracks
my tooth and sends it down my throat.

463
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:54,824
I had to get a crown
for the stub.

464
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,287
I got that beat.
I got that beat.

465
00:30:59,363 --> 00:31:04,232
Junior year, I'm goin' down
on Cynthia Slaterin her dorm room.

466
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:09,500
I'm totally drunk, and in the middle
of it, I fall asleep right in her lap.

467
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:11,507
She got so mad,
she digs her heel into my back.

468
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:15,875
-Ow !
-Right there. That's permanent.

469
00:31:15,946 --> 00:31:19,643
Allright. Allright.
See this ?

470
00:31:21,718 --> 00:31:24,186
That's the farthest I can
move my neck to the right.

471
00:31:24,254 --> 00:31:28,384
Again, sophomore year,
I'm goin' out with Brandy Svining.

472
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:32,258
And for six months, I'm goin' down
on her. Not a damn thing's happening.

473
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:36,026
So, one night, I change a position
or vary my lapping speed,

474
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:40,297
and suddenly it's
a whole new world.

475
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,339
She's movin' around,
convulsing, breathing heavy,

476
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:46,035
and her legs are pressed up
against my ears so tightly...

477
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:50,011
that I don't hear her father
come into the room.

478
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,174
He grabs my hair and
pulls me way back, hard.

479
00:31:57,954 --> 00:32:01,082
Senior year,
spring formal.

480
00:32:01,158 --> 00:32:04,093
I'm eatin' out Missy Kurt
in her brother's car.

481
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:08,621
She's layin' across the backseat. I'm
half hangin' out, knees on the ground.

482
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:13,568
She's flailin' around, and she--
she knocks the parking brake off.

483
00:32:13,637 --> 00:32:18,040
The car starts
rolling down the hill.

484
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:21,271
And my left knee
is cut up to shit...

485
00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:26,941
Like a kiddy's scissors class
cut it up for paper dolls !

486
00:32:30,153 --> 00:32:34,419
[Laughing Continues]

487
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:44,133
Whoa ! Hey !
Look at the time.

488
00:32:44,201 --> 00:32:46,135
We gotta-- We gotta
beat that traffic, huh ?

489
00:32:46,203 --> 00:32:48,433
What traffic ?
It's 1 :30 in the morning.

490
00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:52,032
And rush hour
starts in six hours. Let's go.

00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:56,409
Uh, thanks for inviting us out.
It was educational.

492
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,414
Come on.

493
00:33:03,587 --> 00:33:05,521

in the mirror all the time ?

this great idea for a story.

as hell, but...

I'd like to think of us
as artists, you know ?

00:35:24,558 --> 00:35:27,584
I'd like to get back to doing something
more personal, like our first book.

I haven't liked a man
in a long time.

547
00:35:56,957 --> 00:36:01,621
And it's not because I'm a man-hater
or something like that.

548
00:36:01,695 --> 00:36:05,324
It's just been some time since I've
been exposed to a man that didn't...

549
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:08,926
immediately live into
a stereotype of some sort.

550
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:11,631
And I want you to feel
comfortable with me,

551
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:14,697
because I'd really like us
to be friends.

So if there's anything you
wanna know, it's okay to ask me.

Okay. Why girls ?

- Why men ?
- Well, because that's the standard.

00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:48,837
- Because ?
- Girls feel right.

563
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:53,209
Well, that's how I feel. You know,
I've never really been attracted to men.

564
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,841
- Well, so, you're still a virgin then ?
- No.

565
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:58,851
But you've only
been with girls.

566
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:00,853
So you're saying
a person is a virgin...

567
00:37:00,921 --> 00:37:03,890
until they've had intercourse
with a member of the opposite sex.

568
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,290
Isn't that
the standard definition ?

569
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,487
Again with your standards.

570
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:11,963
I think virginity is lost
when you make love for the first time.

571
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:14,830
- With a member of the opposite sex.
- Why ? Why only then ?

572
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:17,837
Because that's the standard.
What do you want me to tell ya ?

573
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:22,171
So if a virgin is raped,
then she's still a virgin ?

574
00:37:22,243 --> 00:37:24,734
- No, of course not.
- But rape is not the standard.

575
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:28,077
So she's had sex, but not
the standard idea of sex.

576
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:30,981
Hence, according to your definition,
she'd still be a virgin.

577
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:33,849
- Okay, fine, I'll revise.
- Uh-huh.

- Then I lost my virginity at ten.
- Really ?

580
00:37:40,394 --> 00:37:43,989
'Cause, see, I fell on a fence post
when I was ten, and it broke my hymen.

581
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,124
Okay. Second revision.

582
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:49,829
Virginity is lost
through penetration.

583
00:37:49,904 --> 00:37:52,270
Physical penetration
or emotional.

584
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:54,273
- Emotional penetration ?
- Mmm.

585
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:57,435

when we were in high school.

00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:58,603
Physical penetration.

587
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:01,341
- We had sex.
- Yeah, but not real sex.

Explain this again.

How could you have grown up
on the shore and never played skee-ball ?

The higher the score,
the more prize tickets you get.

Well, what do you do
with the prize tickets ?

658
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:11,630
You trade them in
for prizes,

which are not worth nearly as much
as you've paid to play the game.

00:47:04,745 --> 00:47:06,679
- Yeah.
- Good.

738
00:47:06,747 --> 00:47:09,910
Over here we have a male-affectionate,
easy-to-get-along-with,

739
00:47:09,984 --> 00:47:12,782
nonpolitical-agenda
lesbian.

740
00:47:12,854 --> 00:47:16,813
Down here we have
a man-hating, angry-as-fuck,

741
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:20,349
agenda-of-rage,
bitter dyke.

742
00:47:20,428 --> 00:47:25,263
Over here we got Santa Claus,
and up here, the Easter Bunny.

743
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:29,929
Which one is going to get
to the hundred-dollar bill first ?

744
00:47:30,004 --> 00:47:31,938
- What is this supposed to prove ?
- No, I'm serious.

745
00:47:32,006 --> 00:47:35,032
This is a serious exercise.
It's like an S.A.T. question.

746
00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:38,203
Which one is going to get
to the hundred-dollar bill first ?

747
00:47:38,279 --> 00:47:41,146
The male-friendly lesbian ?
The man-hating dyke ?

748
00:47:41,215 --> 00:47:43,149
Santa Claus
or the Easter Bunny ?

749
00:47:43,217 --> 00:47:45,947
- The man-hating dyke.
- Good.

750
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,954
- Why ?
- I don't know.

751
00:47:48,022 --> 00:47:51,958
Because the other three are figments
of your fucking imagination !

752
00:47:52,026 --> 00:47:55,086
I don't need this. I'll be hiding
from your fuckin' shit in my room.

753
00:47:55,162 --> 00:47:57,824
- What ?
- What is it about this girl, man ?

754
00:47:57,899 --> 00:48:00,663
You know you have no shot
at getting her into bed !

755
00:48:00,735 --> 00:48:03,169
Why do you bother
wasting time with her ?

756
00:48:03,237 --> 00:48:06,206
- Because you're Holden Fucking McNeil.
- Right.

757
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:10,836
Most persistent traveler on the road.
That's not the path of least resistance.

758
00:48:10,912 --> 00:48:13,346
Everything's gotta be
a fuckin' challenge for you.

759
00:48:13,414 --> 00:48:15,780
And this little relationship
with that bitch...

760
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:18,876
is a prime example
of your fucking condition.

761
00:48:18,953 --> 00:48:21,251
Well, I don't need a magic eight ball
to look into your future.

762
00:48:21,322 --> 00:48:26,123
You want a forecast ? Here.
Will Holden ever fuck Alyssa ?

763
00:48:26,193 --> 00:48:29,162
Oh, what a shock.
Not fucking likely.

764
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:33,257
This relationship is affecting you,
our work and our friendship.

765
00:48:33,334 --> 00:48:36,861
The time's gonna come when I throw down
the gauntlet and say, " It's me or her."

766
00:48:36,938 --> 00:48:38,906
- Then what are you gonna say ?
- I say you should let this one go !

767
00:48:38,973 --> 00:48:42,841
No. What would you say ? Would you
trash 20 years of fuckin' friendship...

768
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,174
because you've got
some idiotic notion...

769
00:48:45,246 --> 00:48:48,682
that this chick would even let you
sniff her panties, let alone fuck her ?

770
00:48:48,749 --> 00:48:51,946
Look, fuckin' asshole,
I'm telling you, okay ? Let it go !

771
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:53,953
What the fuck, man ?

772
00:48:54,021 --> 00:48:56,012
What the fuck makes this bitch
all that important ?

773
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,287
'Cause I'm fuckin' in love
with her, man, okay ?

774
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,533
[ Whispers ]
Fuck.

775
00:49:13,107 --> 00:49:17,510
- Well, I thought it was love
- Thought it was love

776
00:49:17,578 --> 00:49:19,739

Wish you were the one being
pursued for the cartoon.

779
00:49:26,821 --> 00:49:28,413
Oh, really ?

780
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:32,619
Yeah, then maybe you could sell out and
pick up a check every once in a while.

781
00:49:32,693 --> 00:49:34,627
We're leaving ?

782
00:49:34,695 --> 00:49:37,630
Well, it's not like
this is a bed and breakfast.

783
00:49:37,698 --> 00:49:40,531
I've got a little business
to conduct.

784
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:50,372
Hello there.
Let me ask you a question.

785
00:49:50,444 --> 00:49:54,847
Are you an authorized deal maker
in this establishment ?

786
00:49:54,915 --> 00:49:57,884
Do you have the power
to negotiate ?

787
00:49:57,952 --> 00:50:00,887
You wanna haggle over the price
of your French dip ?

788
00:50:00,955 --> 00:50:06,291
No, I wanna haggle
over the price of fine art.

789
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,454
- What do you mean ?
- There. By the kitchen.

790
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:12,795
See ? That painting.

791
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:17,270
- What about it ?
- The price tag says 75.

792
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:20,501
- So ?
- Tell me you're kidding.

793
00:50:20,574 --> 00:50:25,068
- I'll give you 50.
- [ Scoffs ]

794
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:34,337
Manuel, could you bring the Dyksiezski
down off the wall, please ?

795
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:37,132
My new Dyksiezski.

796
00:50:37,206 --> 00:50:41,074
- Where are you gonna hang it ?
- I'm not. You are.

797
00:50:41,144 --> 00:50:43,078
Oh ? You want me
to hang it for you ?

798
00:50:43,146 --> 00:50:45,080
You better hope it doesn't
get out to the girl nation...

799
00:50:45,148 --> 00:50:47,082
you needed a man
to help you hang a picture.

800
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:50,984
No, no, no. You're going
to hang it in your house.

801
00:50:51,054 --> 00:50:54,490
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.

802
00:50:59,128 --> 00:51:02,757
- Why ?
- Because it's captured the moment.

803
00:51:02,832 --> 00:51:05,665
It'll be a constant reminder,
not just of tonight,

804
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:10,399
but of our introduction, of the building
of our friendship, everything.

805
00:51:10,473 --> 00:51:14,967
Make no mistake about it, my friend,
it is a gift from me to you,

806
00:51:15,044 --> 00:51:18,309
so you'll always
remember us.

807
00:51:26,355 --> 00:51:29,483
[Keys Jingle,
Engine Off]

808
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,994
Why are we stopping ?

809
00:51:33,062 --> 00:51:36,293
- Because I can't take this.
- Can't take what ?

810
00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:38,993
I love you.

811
00:51:39,068 --> 00:51:41,662
[Thunder clap]

812
00:51:46,142 --> 00:51:48,303
You love me ?

813
00:51:48,377 --> 00:51:52,143
I love you and not,
not in a friendly way.

814
00:51:52,215 --> 00:51:54,376
Although, I think
we're great friends.

815
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:57,817
And not in a misplaced
affection, puppy dog way.

816
00:51:57,887 --> 00:51:59,980
Although, I'm sure
that's what you'll call it.

817
00:52:00,056 --> 00:52:03,514
I love you. Very--

818
00:52:03,593 --> 00:52:06,926
Very simple.
Very truly.

819
00:52:06,996 --> 00:52:11,797
You are the epitome of everything I have
ever looked for in another human being.

820
00:52:11,868 --> 00:52:13,859
And I know that you think of me
as just a friend,

821
00:52:13,936 --> 00:52:16,404
and crossing that line is the furthest
thing from an option...

822
00:52:16,472 --> 00:52:18,337
you would ever consider,

823
00:52:18,407 --> 00:52:23,310
but-- [ Sighs ]
I had to say it.

824
00:52:23,379 --> 00:52:25,370
I just--
I can't take this anymore.

825
00:52:25,448 --> 00:52:28,474
I can't stand next to you
without wanting to hold you.

826
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:30,917
I can't-- I can't look into
your eyes without feeling that--

827
00:52:30,987 --> 00:52:34,047
that longing you only read about
in trashy romance novels.

828
00:52:34,123 --> 00:52:39,823
I can't talk to you without wanting to
express my love for everything you are.

829
00:52:39,896 --> 00:52:45,357
And I know this will probably queer
our friendship-- no pun intended--

830
00:52:45,434 --> 00:52:51,066
[Sighs]
but I had to say it.

831
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,576
'Cause I've never
felt this way before.

832
00:52:54,644 --> 00:53:00,048
And I don't care.
I like who I am because of it.

833
00:53:00,116 --> 00:53:03,517
And if bringing this to light
means we can't hang out anymore,

834
00:53:03,586 --> 00:53:06,749
then that hurts me.

835
00:53:06,822 --> 00:53:09,290
But, God, I just-- I couldn't
allow another day to go by...

836
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,260
without just getting it out there,
regardless of the outcome,

837
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:18,858
which, by the look on your face,
is to be the inevitable....

838
00:53:18,935 --> 00:53:21,665
shoot down.

839
00:53:21,737 --> 00:53:27,004
And, you know,
I'll accept that.

840
00:53:27,076 --> 00:53:30,910
But I know-- I know that some part
of you is hesitating for a moment.

841
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,643
And if there's a moment of hesitation,
then that means you feel something too.

842
00:53:34,717 --> 00:53:36,651
And all I ask, please,
is that you just--

843
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:42,157
you just not dismiss that and try
to dwell in it for just ten seconds.

844
00:53:43,526 --> 00:53:45,460
Ah.

Alyssa.

846
00:53:49,131 --> 00:53:54,660
There isn't another soul
on this fucking planet...

847
00:53:54,737 --> 00:53:59,106
who has ever made me half the person
I am when I'm with you.

848
00:53:59,175 --> 00:54:03,271
And I would risk this friendship for the
chance to take it to the next plateau,

849
00:54:03,346 --> 00:54:05,405
because it is there
between you and me.

850
00:54:05,481 --> 00:54:09,281
You can't deny that.

851
00:54:17,727 --> 00:54:20,855
Even if, you know--

852
00:54:24,433 --> 00:54:28,392
Even if we never talk again
after tonight,

853
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:32,931
please know that
I am forever changed...

because of who you are
and what you've meant to me,

which, while I do
appreciate it,

856
00:54:41,651 --> 00:54:47,180
I'd never need a painting of birds
bought at a diner to remind me of.

- Why ?
- That was so unfair.

865
00:55:26,896 --> 00:55:28,261
You know how unfair that was.

00:55:28,331 --> 00:55:30,265
What ? It's unfair
that I'm in love with you ?

No, it's unfortunate
that you're in love with me.

00:55:32,868 --> 00:55:36,304
It's unfair you felt the fuckin' need
to unburden your soul about it.

869
00:55:36,372 --> 00:55:39,637
Do you remember for
one fucking second who I am ?

870
00:55:39,709 --> 00:55:42,041
So ? I mean, you know,
people change.

Oh ! Oh !
It's that simple !

00:55:44,113 --> 00:55:46,911
You fall in love with me and
want a romantic relationship.

873
00:55:46,982 --> 00:55:48,916
Nothing changes for you...

874
00:55:48,984 --> 00:55:51,475
with the exception of feeling
hunky-dory all the time.

875
00:55:51,554 --> 00:55:55,490
But what about me, Holden ?
It's not that simple !

876
00:55:55,558 --> 00:55:57,958
I just can't get into
a relationship with you...

877
00:55:58,027 --> 00:56:01,155
without throwing my whole
fucking world into upheaval.

878
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:05,462
That's every relationship. There's
always gonna be a period of adjustment.

879
00:56:05,534 --> 00:56:08,094
Period of adjustment ?

880
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:12,504
There's no period of adjustment,
Holden ! I am fucking gay !

881
00:56:12,575 --> 00:56:14,600
That's who I am !

You assume I can turn all that around
because you've got a fucking crush ?

If this is a crush,

884

I know you. You're way
too conservative for that girl.

She's been around and seen things
we've only read about in books.

We have read about them,
so we're prepared.

There's no "we" here.

You're gonna have to
go through this alone.

It's one thing
to read about shit,

to deal with it on a regular basis.

for her as well.

To insure that all this time we've

when you sign with a publisher...

and you just sit back and collect.

Can I ask you a question ?

Don't even tell me
you want to do it again.

taking notes.

Historically, yes.
That's true.

968
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,298
Then why this ?

969
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:57,173
Well, I've given that
a lot of thought, you know.

970
01:03:57,244 --> 01:04:00,213
Now that I'm being ostracized
by my friends,

971
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,214
I've had plenty of time
to think about it.

972
01:04:02,282 --> 01:04:05,683
And what I've come up with
is really simple.

973
01:04:07,087 --> 01:04:10,420
I came to this
on my own terms.

974
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:13,391
You know, I didn't just
heed what I was taught:

975
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:17,328
Men and women should be
together, it's the natural way,

976
01:04:17,397 --> 01:04:19,331
that kind of thing.

977
01:04:19,399 --> 01:04:23,631
I'm not with you because of
what family, society, life...

978
01:04:23,704 --> 01:04:27,196
tried to in still in me
from day one.

979
01:04:29,209 --> 01:04:31,507
The way the world is,

980
01:04:31,578 --> 01:04:36,606
how seldom it is that you meet
that one person who...

981
01:04:36,683 --> 01:04:39,243
just gets you.

982
01:04:39,319 --> 01:04:41,719
It's so rare.

983
01:04:41,788 --> 01:04:44,882
My parents didn't
really have it.

984
01:04:44,958 --> 01:04:50,419
There were no examples set for me in
the world of male-female relationships.

985
01:04:50,497 --> 01:04:54,661
And to cut one self off
from finding that person--

986
01:04:54,735 --> 01:04:59,069
to immediately halve your options
by eliminating the possibility...

987
01:04:59,139 --> 01:05:02,836
of finding that one person
within your own gender--

988
01:05:02,909 --> 01:05:05,036
that just seemed stupid
to me.

989
01:05:05,112 --> 01:05:07,945
So I didn't.

990
01:05:08,014 --> 01:05:11,245
But then you came along.

991
01:05:11,318 --> 01:05:15,277
You, the one least likely.
I mean, you were a guy.

992

[ Chuckling ]
Still am.

993
01:05:17,858 --> 01:05:22,955
And while I was falling for you
I put a ceiling on that,

994
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:25,827
because you were a guy.

995
01:05:25,899 --> 01:05:30,734
Until I remembered why I opened the door
to women in the first place:

996
01:05:30,804 --> 01:05:35,104
To not limit the likelihood
of finding that one person who'd...

997
01:05:35,175 --> 01:05:37,541
complement me so completely.

998
01:05:41,848 --> 01:05:44,942
So, here we are.

999
01:05:45,018 --> 01:05:47,384
I was thorough
when I looked for you.

1000
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:53,099
And I feel justified
lying in your arms...

1001
01:05:53,174 --> 01:05:56,871
'cause I got here
on my own terms,

1002
01:05:56,945 --> 01:06:01,712
and I have no question there was
someplace I didn't look.

1003
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:04,513
For me that makes
all the difference.

1004
01:06:20,735 --> 01:06:23,829
Can I at least tell people all you
needed was some serious deep-dicking ?

- And ?

1010
01:07:09,417 --> 01:07:13,854
- Weird nickname. What's your point ?
- Do you know why it's " Finger Cuffs" ?

1011
01:07:13,921 --> 01:07:17,186
- No. I suppose you do.
- I do.

1012
01:07:19,761 --> 01:07:24,357
Remember Cohee Lundin ? Left Hudson
and went to North our senior year ?

1013
01:07:24,432 --> 01:07:26,366
Yeah.

1014
01:07:26,434 --> 01:07:29,597
Well, asshole, I ran into him
at the stores the other day.

1015
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:32,139
God, it's been ages
since I've seen him.

1016
01:07:32,206 --> 01:07:35,698
- Mentioned you were dating Alyssa.
- Did you ?

1017

Yeah. Funny thing is,
you know what he said ?

1018
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:42,846
Shit, I know Alyssa Jones.
I mean, I know Alyssa Jones.

1019
01:07:42,917 --> 01:07:47,013
Me and Rick Derris used to hang
around her house after school...

1020
01:07:47,088 --> 01:07:49,716
and shit, 'cause her parents were,
like, never home and shit, right ?

1021
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:52,521
But one day Rick whips it out and
starts rubbin' it on her leg and shit,

1022
01:07:52,593 --> 01:07:54,754
chasin' her around the living room;
I was dyin'.

1023
01:07:54,829 --> 01:07:57,525
You know what the crazy bitch did ?
She fuckin' drops to her knees...

1024
01:07:57,598 --> 01:08:00,465
and starts suckin' him off right in
front of me, like I wasn't even there.

1025
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:02,833
I almost died.
But that's not the fucked-up part.

1026
01:08:02,904 --> 01:08:06,863
The fucked-up part was Rick, right
in the middle of it, pointin' at her,

1027
01:08:06,941 --> 01:08:09,273
and he says "Cohee,"
just like that, "Cohee."

1028
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,277
So I'm like, "Yo,
I'll give it a shot."

1029
01:08:11,345 --> 01:08:14,143
I start pullin' her pants down and shit,
all slow 'cause I figure any second...

1030

she's gonna turn around
and belt me in the mouth, right ?

But she's all into it, man !
She don't try to stop me or nothin' !

- Oh, I don't think you know her.

1319
01:26:11,654 --> 01:26:14,487
Come on, man.
I'm people who know people.

1320
01:26:14,557 --> 01:26:16,491
You sound
like Barbra Streisand.

1321
01:26:16,559 --> 01:26:19,323
Maybe 'cause I got this tubby bitch
playin' her greatest hits tape...

1322
01:26:19,395 --> 01:26:21,329
in my ear all the time.

1323
01:26:21,397 --> 01:26:25,629
You gotta see it. When she starts
singin' "You Don't Bring Me Flowers,"

1324
01:26:25,701 --> 01:26:28,829
this faggot starts cryin' like a little
girl with a skinned knee and shit.

1325
01:26:28,904 --> 01:26:32,772
Big fuckin' softie.
So what's the skirt's name ?

1326
01:26:32,842 --> 01:26:35,242
I'm tellin' ya, man.
You don't know the girl.

1327
01:26:35,311 --> 01:26:39,611
I ain't playin', man.
Come on, tell me her name, Mysterio.

1328
01:26:41,317 --> 01:26:43,251
Alyssa Jones.

1329
01:26:45,521 --> 01:26:48,422
Holy fuckin' shit.
Finger Cuffs ?

1330
01:26:48,491 --> 01:26:53,155
You're dating Finger Cuffs,
you silly son of a bitch ?

1331
01:26:53,229 --> 01:26:55,424
Wait a second.
I thought she was all gay and shit.

1332
01:26:55,498 --> 01:26:58,399
She was, or she is.
I don't know.

1333
01:26:58,467 --> 01:27:01,561
And you're dating her.
Man, you're a lucky fuck.

1334
01:27:01,637 --> 01:27:03,571
She ever bring bitches to bed
with you ?

1335
01:27:03,639 --> 01:27:05,834
Get a little of that
Filet-O-Fish sandwich goin' on ?

1336
01:27:05,908 --> 01:27:08,433
Yeah, you know what
I'm talkin' about, baby. Right ?

1337
01:27:08,511 --> 01:27:12,379
What's up ? Yeah.
So four tits and what ?

1338
01:27:12,448 --> 01:27:16,145
- No, man. It's not like that.
- What's it like, then ?

1339
01:27:16,218 --> 01:27:20,086
Right now ?
I don't know.

1340
01:27:20,156 --> 01:27:23,148
I love her, you know ?
But, uh, she has a past.

1341
01:27:23,225 --> 01:27:27,127
I'll say. Stuffin' two guys,
eatin' chicks out and shit.

1342
01:27:27,196 --> 01:27:29,494
You know, I heard
one time she had this dog--

1343
01:27:29,565 --> 01:27:32,762
Eat your fuckin' bagel already
and shut up.

1344
01:27:32,835 --> 01:27:36,771
Look at this touchy
motherfucker right here.

1345
01:27:36,839 --> 01:27:39,307
So if you're all in love and shit,
what's the problem ?

1346
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:43,038
The problem is
stupid shit like that.

1347
01:27:43,112 --> 01:27:44,943
It was bad enough when it was
just girls, you know ?

1348
01:27:45,014 --> 01:27:48,950
You throw guys into the mix--
two guys at once, no less--

1349
01:27:49,018 --> 01:27:52,112
All that experience, you know ?
What am I supposed to think ?

1350
01:27:52,188 --> 01:27:57,125
Think "good," ya fuckin' ninny shithead,
'cause now she'll be all true and blue.

1351
01:27:57,193 --> 01:28:02,028
Bitch tasted life. Now she's settlin'
for your borin' funny-book-makin' ass.

1352
01:28:02,098 --> 01:28:05,295
Settling for my boring ass.
That's comforting. Thanks, Jay.

1353
01:28:05,368 --> 01:28:10,362
- That's what I'm here for.
- I'm just havin' a problem with it.

1354
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:14,637
It's like I can't get these visuals out
of my head of her doing all this shit.

1355
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:19,113
And I don't know why I can't let
it go, 'cause I'm crazy about this girl.

1356
01:28:19,181 --> 01:28:23,208
- I look at her, I see kids, grandkids--
- You're scarin' me.

1357
01:28:23,285 --> 01:28:25,913
Yeah, well, I'm scarin' myself
'cause I think so much of this girl...

1358
01:28:25,988 --> 01:28:29,014
that I can't get stupid shit
like " Finger Cuffs" out of my head.

1359
01:28:30,659 --> 01:28:34,390
[ Sighs ] I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doin'.

1360
01:28:37,933 --> 01:28:39,867
Chasin' Amy.

1361
01:28:41,704 --> 01:28:44,867
What ?
What did you say ?

1362
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:46,999
[ Spits ]

1363
01:28:47,076 --> 01:28:50,239
- You're chasing Amy.
- What do you look so shocked for, man ?

1364
01:28:50,312 --> 01:28:54,271
Fatbastard does this all the time. He
thinks 'cause he don't say anything...

1365
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:57,012
it'll have some huge impact
when he does open his fuckin' mouth.

1366
01:28:57,086 --> 01:28:59,020
Jesus Christ,
why don't you shut up ?

1367
01:28:59,088 --> 01:29:03,525
Always yap-yap-yapping all the time.
Give me a fuckin' headache.

1368
01:29:03,592 --> 01:29:06,425
I went through somethin' like what
you're talkin' about a couple years ago.

1369
01:29:06,495 --> 01:29:08,793
- This chick named Amy.
- When ?

1370
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:12,429
A couple of years ago.

1371
01:29:12,501 --> 01:29:14,696
What, she live in Canada or something ?
Why don't I remember this ?

1372
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:16,738
Bitch, what you don't
know about me...

1373
01:29:16,806 --> 01:29:18,740
I could just about squeeze
in the Grand-fucking-Canyon.

1374
01:29:18,808 --> 01:29:23,211
Did you know I always wanted to be
a dancer in Vegas ? Huh ?

1375
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:27,010
Bet you didn't even know
that shit, did you ?

1376
01:29:27,082 --> 01:29:29,915
Just tell your fuckin' story so
we can get out of here and smoke this.

1377
01:29:31,687 --> 01:29:36,556
So there's me and Amy. And we're
inseparable. Just big-time in love.

1378
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:39,560
Then four months down the road
the idiot gear kicks in,

1379
01:29:39,628 --> 01:29:43,086
and I ask about the ex-boyfriend which,
as we all know, is a really dumb move.

1380
01:29:43,165 --> 01:29:46,566
But you know how it is: You don't want
to know, but you just have to know.

1381
01:29:46,635 --> 01:29:48,569
Stupid guy bullshit.

1382
01:29:48,637 --> 01:29:51,128
So, anyway, she starts
tellin' me about him.

1383
01:29:51,207 --> 01:29:55,507
They fell in love, went out for
a couple of years, lived together.

1384
01:29:55,578 --> 01:29:59,480
Her mother likes me better,
blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm okay.

1385
01:29:59,548 --> 01:30:02,574
But then she drops the bomb on me,
and the bomb is this:

1386
01:30:02,651 --> 01:30:05,950
It seems that a couple of times,
while they were goin' out,

1387
01:30:06,021 --> 01:30:08,319
he brought some people
to bed with them.

1388
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:10,756
Menage a trois,
I believe it's called.

1389
01:30:10,826 --> 01:30:14,318
Now this just blows my mind, right ?
I'm not used to this sort of thing.

1390
01:30:14,396 --> 01:30:18,765
-I was raised Catholic, for God's sakes.
-Saint Shithead.

1391
01:30:18,834 --> 01:30:20,768
Do somethin'.

1392
01:30:20,836 --> 01:30:24,101
So I'm totally weirded out by this,
right ? And I just start blastin' her.

1393
01:30:24,173 --> 01:30:26,937
I don't know how to deal with what I'm
feelin', so I figure the best way is...

1394
01:30:27,009 --> 01:30:30,001
if call her "slut," right,
and tell her she was used.

1395
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:33,139
I'm out for blood.
I really want to hurt this girl.

1396
01:30:33,215 --> 01:30:37,083
"What the fuck is your problem ?"
And she's just calmly trying to tell me,

1397
01:30:37,152 --> 01:30:41,088
" It was that time, that place," and she
doesn't think she should apologize...

1398
01:30:41,156 --> 01:30:43,249
because she doesn't feel
that she's done anything wrong.

1399
01:30:43,325 --> 01:30:48,126
I'm like, "Oh, really ?" I look her in
the eye and tell her it's over. I walk.

1400
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,013
Fuckin' A.

1401
01:30:52,089 --> 01:30:54,819
No, idiot.
It was a mistake.

1402
01:30:54,892 --> 01:30:56,951
I wasn't disgusted with her,
I was afraid.

1403
01:30:57,028 --> 01:31:00,794
You know, at that moment I felt small,
like I'd lacked experience,

1404
01:31:00,865 --> 01:31:05,393
Like I'd never be on her level, never be
enough for her or something like that.

1405
01:31:05,469 --> 01:31:08,905
But what I did not get,
she didn't care.

1406
01:31:08,973 --> 01:31:13,535
She wasn't lookin' for that guy anymore,
she was lookin' for me, for the Bob.

1407
01:31:13,611 --> 01:31:18,810
But by the time I figured this all
out, it's too late, man. She moved on.

1408
01:31:18,883 --> 01:31:22,717
All had to show for it was foolish
pride which then gave way to regret.

1409
01:31:24,321 --> 01:31:28,655
She was the girl.
I know that now.

1410
01:31:28,726 --> 01:31:31,524
But...

1411
01:31:33,097 --> 01:31:35,622
I pushed her away.

1412
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:45,939
So I've spent every day
since then chasing Amy.

1413
01:31:48,012 --> 01:31:49,980
So to speak.

1414
01:31:50,047 --> 01:31:54,814
Enough of this fuckin' melodrama.
My advice ? Forget her, dude.

1415
01:31:54,885 --> 01:31:59,288
There's one bitch in the world,
one bitch with many faces.

1416
01:31:59,356 --> 01:32:03,884
Get up, tons of fun.
We gotta book.

1417
01:32:03,961 --> 01:32:07,692
- Catch in' a bus to Chi-town.
- Why ? What's there ?

1418
01:32:07,765 --> 01:32:11,496
Business, yo. How many more of those
fat envelopes we get comin' to us ?

1419
01:32:11,569 --> 01:32:14,402
Uh, I don't know.

1420
01:32:14,472 --> 01:32:16,940
I don't know how much longer
the book's gonna be around.

1421
01:32:17,007 --> 01:32:20,101
Yeah, good.
I'll be glad as shit when it's gone.

1422
01:32:20,177 --> 01:32:24,341
There's a million people who'd love
to see them self in a comic book.

1423
01:32:24,415 --> 01:32:27,145
But that ain't like us at all,
all slapsticky and shit,

1424
01:32:27,218 --> 01:32:28,879
runnin' around like
a couple of dick heads.

1425
01:32:28,953 --> 01:32:31,854
Sayin'-- What's that shit
he got us sayin' ?

1426
01:32:31,922 --> 01:32:35,255
Oh, um...
"snootchie-bootchies."

1427
01:32:35,326 --> 01:32:40,730
"Snootchie-bootchies." Who the fuck
talks like that ? That is baby talk.

1428
01:32:42,466 --> 01:32:45,663
It's a big world, G.
We're bound to run into you again.

1429
01:32:45,736 --> 01:32:49,604
- Till then, keep your unit on ya.
- I'll try.

1430
01:32:49,673 --> 01:32:53,131
No, no, no, no, no.
Do or do not. There is no try--

1431
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:57,510
Knock that shit off!
We got a bus to catch.

1432
01:32:57,581 --> 01:33:01,540
Jedi bitch. Man, what do you always have
to tell that fuckin' gay story for ?

1433
01:33:01,619 --> 01:33:03,519
- Man, shut up.
- You shut up, you fat fuck.

1434
01:33:52,803 --> 01:33:54,771
Okay.

1435
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:59,400
You guys are probably wondering
why I asked you here at the same time...

1436
01:33:59,476 --> 01:34:03,207
knowing that we have shit
to settle between us separately.

1437
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,545
I just figured you wanted
to kill two birds with one stone.

1438
01:34:06,617 --> 01:34:09,450
You know, by telling her
to fuck off with me here...

1439
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,988
so you wouldn't have to
go through the story again later on.

1440
01:34:12,056 --> 01:34:15,457
- Fuck you.
- Not even if you let me videotape it.

1441
01:34:15,526 --> 01:34:18,518
Okay, enough.
All right ?

1442
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:22,956
Enough.
[ Sighs ]

1443
01:34:23,033 --> 01:34:26,992
Now, I've been going over and
over and over this whole thing,

1444
01:34:27,071 --> 01:34:29,699
and I've dissected it
a thousand different ways.

1445
01:34:29,773 --> 01:34:33,470
Banky, there's tension between you and I
for the first time in our lives.

1446
01:34:33,544 --> 01:34:38,311
You hate me dating Alyssa and you want
me to sign off on this cartoon thing.

1447
01:34:38,382 --> 01:34:40,543
How perceptive.

1448
01:34:40,618 --> 01:34:44,850
Alyssa,

1449
01:34:44,922 --> 01:34:46,981
you and I have hit a wall...

1450
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:51,517
'cause I don't know how to deal
with your, uh, your past, I guess.

1451
01:34:51,595 --> 01:34:53,529
That's a nice way
of putting it.

1452
01:34:53,597 --> 01:34:55,588
I'd have said
"the whole double stuff" thing.

1453
01:35:02,172 --> 01:35:05,767
I'm only gonna
tell you this once: Shut up.

1454
01:35:08,178 --> 01:35:10,112
Now,
[Sighs]

1455
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:14,241
I know I'm to blame one way
or another on both accounts.

1456
01:35:14,318 --> 01:35:18,277
Alyssa, with you

and so much experience,

pretty small in comparison.

Banky, I know why you're having such
a hard time with me and Alyssa.

1462
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:38,874
It's something that's been
obvious for ever and I guess--

acknowledge it.

You're attracted to me. Just as, in
a way, I guess I'm... attracted to you.

1467
01:35:54,758 --> 01:35:57,454
It makes sense. We've been together
so long, we have so much in common.

gonna have to deal with, Bank.

And that would explain
your jealousy of Alyssa,

1472
01:36:18,115 --> 01:36:20,777
your homophobia,
your sense of humor--

1473

got a predilection toward dick jokes--

[Holden]
Okay.

1477
01:36:39,136 --> 01:36:43,038
Now, you guys are probably
asking yourselves the same question...

1478
01:36:43,107 --> 01:36:47,066
that I've been going over and over
in my head the past few weeks:

1479
01:36:47,144 --> 01:36:49,078
What does one have
to do with the other ?

1480

Don't.

1481
01:36:50,447 --> 01:36:54,008
And when I did some
serious soul-searching,

1482
01:36:54,084 --> 01:36:56,348
it came to me
from outta nowhere.

1483
01:36:56,420 --> 01:37:01,517
And it all made sense.
And a calm came over me.

1484
01:37:01,592 --> 01:37:04,652
I know what we have to do.

1485
01:37:04,728 --> 01:37:08,994
And then you, Banky,
you, Alyssa, and l--

1486
01:37:09,066 --> 01:37:14,003

can finally be... all right.

Please don't say it.

1488

have sex together.

I mean, look,
don't you see ?

That would take care
of everything.

1491
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,986
Alyssa, with you, I won't feel
too inadequate or conservative anymore,

1492
01:37:40,063 --> 01:37:43,260
because I'll have done something
on a par with all your experience.

1493
01:37:43,333 --> 01:37:48,032
And it will be with you, which will
make it that much more powerful.

1494
01:37:48,105 --> 01:37:50,039
Banky, you can take that leap...

1495
01:37:50,107 --> 01:37:52,439
that everyone else but you
sees you should take.

1496
01:37:52,509 --> 01:37:55,876
And it'll be with me,
your best friend for years.

1497

We've been everything to each other
but intimates,

1498
01:37:57,981 --> 01:38:00,575
and now we'll have been
through that together too.

1499
01:38:00,651 --> 01:38:03,415
And it won't be a total leap for you
because a woman will be involved.

1500
01:38:03,487 --> 01:38:07,583
And when it's over, all that hostility
you feel toward Alyssa will be gone...

1501
01:38:07,658 --> 01:38:10,456
because you'll have shared in something
beautiful with the woman I love.

1502
01:38:10,527 --> 01:38:13,257
It'll be cathartic.

God, I can't believe you call
these people contemporaries.

1606
01:46:23,198 --> 01:46:25,758
Look at this guy over here
with the pointy ears ? What's that ?

1607
01:46:25,834 --> 01:46:27,768
- He's a Vulcan.
- A what ?

1608
01:46:27,836 --> 01:46:30,202
- A Vulcan. Jesus, potzer.
- [ Laughs ]

1609
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:32,763
Why don't you take a walk
and get us something to drink ?

1610
01:46:32,841 --> 01:46:34,274
Okay, I will.

1611
01:46:53,132 --> 01:46:55,157
Um, this isn't
one of mine.

1612
01:46:55,234 --> 01:46:57,168
It's mine.

1613
01:46:58,804 --> 01:47:00,999
I saved you a copy.

1614
01:47:04,276 --> 01:47:06,210
Hi.

1615
01:47:06,278 --> 01:47:08,212
Hi.

1616
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,612
How've you been ?

1617
01:47:10,683 --> 01:47:15,120
Uh, good. Really good.
Yourself ?

1618
01:47:15,187 --> 01:47:17,121
Good.

1619
01:47:23,829 --> 01:47:27,424
The new issue's selling
like crazy, for some reason.

1620
01:47:27,499 --> 01:47:31,230
Yeah, well, it's because it's
really good. I liked it a lot.

1621
01:47:31,303 --> 01:47:33,237
Thank you.

1622
01:47:35,841 --> 01:47:38,537
I haven't even seen this yet.
Did it just come out ?

1623
01:47:38,611 --> 01:47:42,138
Uh, oh, about a month ago.
I did a really small run.

1624
01:47:42,214 --> 01:47:44,307
Self-financed,
only about 500 issues.

1625
01:47:44,383 --> 01:47:47,045
Will I enjoy it ?

1626
01:47:48,253 --> 01:47:50,744
You might.
It's familiar subject matter.

1627
01:48:08,273 --> 01:48:12,073
Looks like
a very personal story.

1628
01:48:15,214 --> 01:48:19,310
[ Sighs ] I finally had
something personal to say.

1629
01:48:24,323 --> 01:48:27,850
Well, I'm gonna go.
I don't wanna hold up your line here.

1630
01:48:27,926 --> 01:48:30,486
Yeah.

1631
01:48:30,562 --> 01:48:34,498
I mean, it can get ugly. I just saw
this nun call a small child a cunt-rag.

1632
01:48:34,566 --> 01:48:36,500
[ Chuckles ]

1633
01:48:42,941 --> 01:48:45,341
You know, read that,
if you have a minute.

1634
01:48:45,411 --> 01:48:47,879
I will.

1635
01:48:51,617 --> 01:48:56,520
If you get the chance, call me. I'd like
to hear your thoughts, or... whatever.

1636
01:48:56,588 --> 01:48:59,352
Okay.

1637
01:49:00,926 --> 01:49:02,860
Okay.

1638
01:49:05,197 --> 01:49:07,324
It was really nice
seeing you again.

1639
01:49:07,399 --> 01:49:10,630
It was really nice
to see you too.

1640
01:49:24,149 --> 01:49:27,448
- Who was that ?
- Huh ?

1641
01:49:27,519 --> 01:49:29,384
Who was that ?

1642
01:49:39,298 --> 01:49:43,394
Oh, just some guy I knew.

1643
01:49:56,715 --> 01:50:00,515
Next. So, what do you want
to do tonight ?

1644
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:07,315
 I was tappin' my foot
on a Friday night

1645
01:50:07,392 --> 01:50:12,352
 To my favorite band
I was pushed aside

1646
01:50:12,431 --> 01:50:17,368
 I said hey, don't push me
No, no, no one pushes me

1647
01:50:17,436 --> 01:50:22,373
 When I was face to face
with a woman I admired

1648
01:50:22,441 --> 01:50:24,864
And she gave me this look

1649
01:50:24,997 --> 01:50:27,329
I could not believe

1650
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:32,531
And the cold stare remained
I wanted to leave

1651
01:50:34,941 --> 01:50:40,208
 Yeah, I do believe anger
is offset by sorrow

1652
01:50:40,279 --> 01:50:45,080
 But you destroy today
you might regret tomorrow

1653
01:50:45,151 --> 01:50:47,779
 When you're young
and defensive

1654
01:50:47,854 --> 01:50:50,186
 It comes off offensive

1655
01:50:50,256 --> 01:50:55,159
And it's hard to repay the
tolerance that you borrowed

1656
01:50:55,228 --> 01:51:00,393
 The lasting relationship
sinks right off the pier
