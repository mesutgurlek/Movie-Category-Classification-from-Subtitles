1
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:56,506
You see? You see
the symbolism of it?

2
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:58,508
Capital and Labor
destroy each other.

3
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:01,345
It teaches a moral lesson.
It has social significance.

4
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:03,482
Who wants to see that kind of stuff?
It gives me the creeps.

5
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:05,484
Tell him how long it played
in the Music Hall.

6
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,487
It was held over a fifth week.

7
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:09,623
Who goes to the Music Hall?
Communists!

8
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,459
Communists? This picture's
an answer to Communists!

9
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,429
It shows we're awake...

10
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,432
and not dunking our heads in the sand
like a bunch of ostriches!

11
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:18,768
I want this picture to be
a commentary on modern conditions.

12
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:21,271
Stark realism. The problems
that confront the average man.

13
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:23,274
- But with a little sex.
- A little,
but I don't want to stress it.

14
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:25,277
I want this picture
to be a document.

15
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:27,279
I want to hold
a mirror up to life.

16
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,282
I want this to be
a picture of dignity--

17
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:31,751
- a true canvas
of the suffering of humanity.
- But with a little sex.

18
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:33,754
- With a little sex in it.
- How about a nice musical?

19
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,757
How can you talk about musicals
at a time like this,

20
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,759
with the world
committing suicide?

21
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,762
With corpses piling up
in the street,

22
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:41,799
with grim death gargling at you
from every corner,

23
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:44,034
- with people slaughtered like sheep!
- Maybe they'd like to forget.

24
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:47,340
Then why did they hold this one over
for a fifth week? For the ushers?

25
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,442
- It died in Pittsburgh.
- Like a dog.

26
00:03:49,443 --> 00:03:51,445
- What do they know in Pittsburgh?
- They know what they like.

27
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:53,447
If they knew what they liked,
they wouldn't live in Pittsburgh.

28
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:56,584
If you pandered to the public,
you'd still be in the horse age.

29
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:58,787
- You think we're not?
Look at Hopalong Cassidy.
- You look at him!

30
00:03:58,787 --> 00:04:02,058
We'd still be making Keystone chases,
bathing beauties, custard pie--

31
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:04,060
- And a fortune.
- A fortune.

32
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,397
Of course I'm just a minor
employee here, Mr. LeBrand--

33
00:04:06,398 --> 00:04:08,400
He's starting that one again.

34
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,503
I wanted to make you
something outstanding--
something you could be proud of,

35
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:13,940
something that would realize
the potentialities of film...

36
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:16,744
as the sociological
and artistic medium that it is.

37
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:18,747
With a little sex in it.
Something like--

38
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:21,617
- Something like Capra. I know.
- What's the matter with Capra?

39
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:23,619
- Look, you want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou?
- Yes.

40
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,622
- Now, wait a minute!
- Then go ahead and make it!

41
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:27,625
For what you're getting,
I can't afford to argue with you.

42
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,627
That's a fine way to start a man out
on a million-dollar production.

43
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:31,630
You want it, you've got it!

44
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:33,633
I can take it on the chin.
I've taken it before.

45
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:36,036
- Not from me you haven't.
- Not from you, Sully, that's true.

46
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:38,039
Not with pictures like
So Long Sarong,

47
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,042
Hey, Hey, In the Hayloft,
Ants in Your Plants of 1939--

48
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:43,045
But they weren't about tramps,
lockouts, sweatshops,

49
00:04:43,046 --> 00:04:46,650
people eating garbage in alleys
and living in piano boxes and ashcans.

50
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,652
- And phooey!
- They're about nice,
clean young people...

51
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:50,655
who fell in love--
with laughter and music and legs.

52
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:52,657
Now take that scene in
Hey, Hey, In the Hayloft--

53
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:54,660
But you don't realize
conditions have changed.

54
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,663
There isn't any work.
There isn't any food.

55
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,665
- These are troublous times.
- What do you know about trouble?

56
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,668
- What do I know about trouble?
- Yes, what do you know about trouble?

57
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,670
- What do you mean, what
do I know about trouble?
-Just what I'm saying.

58
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:04,673
You want to make a picture
about garbage cans--

59
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:06,676
When did you eat
your last meal out of one?

60
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:08,678
- What's that got to do with it?
- He's asking you.

61
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:10,681
You want an epic about misery--

62
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:12,684
you want to show hungry people
sleeping in doorways.

63
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:14,486
With newspapers around them.

64
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:16,489
You want to grind
10,000 feet of hard luck,

65
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:18,491
- and all I'm asking you is,
what do you know about hard luck?
- Yes!

66
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:20,894
- What do you mean?
Don't you think I've--
- No.

67
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:22,897
- What?
- You have not.

68
00:05:22,897 --> 00:05:24,899
I sold newspapers
till I was 20,

69
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,902
then I worked in a shoe store and
put myself through law school at night.

70
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:28,905
- Where were you at 20?
- I was in college.

71
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:31,375
When I was 13 I supported three sisters,
two brothers and a widowed mother.

72
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:33,378
- Where were you at 13?
- I was in boarding school.

73
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:35,781
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to be
ashamed of it, Sully.

74
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:37,916
That's the reason your pictures
have been so light, so cheerful,
so inspiring.

75
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,919
They don't stink with messages.

76
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,922
That's why I paid you
500 a week when you were 24.

77
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:43,924
- 750 at 25.
- 1,000 when you were 26.

78
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:46,661
- When I was 26, I was getting 18.
- 2,000 at 27.

79
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:48,931
- I was getting 25 then.
- 3,000 after Thanks for Yesterday.

80
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,933
4,000 after Ants in Your Plants.

81
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,936
I suppose you're trying to tell me
I don't know what trouble is.

82
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,939
- Yes!
- In a nice way, Sully.

83
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:57,575
You're absolutely right.
I haven't any idea what it is.

84
00:05:57,576 --> 00:05:59,812
People always like what they don't
know anything about.

85
00:05:59,813 --> 00:06:03,551
I had a lot of nerve wanting to make
a picture about human suffering.

86
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:07,545
You're a gentleman to admit it, Sully,
but then, you are anyway.

87
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:10,692
How about making
Ants in Your Plants of 1941?

88
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:12,829
- You can have Bob Hope, Mary Martin--
- Maybe Bing Crosby.

89
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,765
- The Abbott Dancers.
- MaybeJack Benny and Rochester.

90
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:16,767
- A big-name band.
- What?

91
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:19,204
Oh, no. I want to make
O Brother, Where Art Thou?

92
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:21,207
But I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do first.

93
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:23,209
I'm going down to wardrobe
to get some old clothes,

94
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,212
- some old shoes,
- Huh?

95
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:27,515
- and I'm gonna start out
with ten cents in my pocket.
- What?

96
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:29,517
I don't know where I'm going,
but I'm not coming back...

97
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:31,520
- till I know what trouble is.
- What?

98
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,522
Don't worry, you can
take me off salary.

99
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:35,792
Who's talking about
taking you off salary?

100
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:38,229
- So long. Thanks for the idea.
- Wait! Don't be so impulsive.

101
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,232
- How soon will you be back?
- I don't know.

102
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:42,234
Maybe a week, maybe a month,
maybe a year.

103
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,771
Don't worry about me. And thanks,
Dracula. You gave me a great idea.

104
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:48,677
I gave you--

105
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:50,679
- Now look what you've done.
- Yeah-- What I've done?

106
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,681
With your lies
about selling newspapers!

107
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:54,951
I sold as many newspapers
as you supported a family at 13.

108
00:06:54,952 --> 00:06:57,955
- I opened a shooting gallery.
- With money you borrowed
from your uncle.

109
00:06:57,956 --> 00:07:00,258
- We better insure him for a million.
- He's worth more.

110
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:03,261
- The bonehead.
- Yes, but what a genius.

111
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:05,698
Get me a copy of that
O Brother, Where Art Thou?

112
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,701
I guess I'll have
to read it now.

113
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:11,696
Make that two copies.
Why should I suffer alone?

114
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:21,819
- How's this?
- Isn't that overdoing it, a bit sir?

115
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,623
Why break their hearts?

116
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:26,826
All right.
Let's try that one again.

117
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:29,228
I think this one's
sufficiently seedy, sir.

118
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:31,665
There's no use overplaying it,
is there, sir?

119
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,660
[ Telephone Ringing ]

120
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,811
Yes?

121
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:44,248
- Your wife is on one, sir.
- What does she want?

122
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:47,554
I suspect it has something to do
with today's being the 15th.

123
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:50,156
- [ Laughs ]
- Payday. All right, put her on.

124
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:52,960
You may connect Mrs. Sullivan.

125
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:54,963
Yes?

126
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:58,267
You don't happen to remember
what day this is, do you, dear?

127
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:00,703
Yes, I happen to remember
what day it is.

128
00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:04,008
No, I haven't forgotten anything.
Have you?

129
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:06,844
Perhaps I could be a little
more polite, Mrs. Sullivan,

130
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:09,248
but somehow, when I talk to you
I don't feel polite.

131
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:11,284
I regret it,
but that's the way it is.

132
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:13,720
I don't know whether
I signed it or not.

133
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:15,723
I always close my eyes
when I sign your check.

134
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:18,226
Maybe I signed the blotter.

135

[ Clicking ]

136
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,232
Have you made out
the Panther Woman's check yet?

137
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:26,136
You better get it down to her before
she comes up here with the sheriff.

138
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:28,139
She has a very peculiar
sense of humor.

139
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,241
Good morning, sir.

140
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:32,278
Good morning, Burrows.
How do you like it?

141
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,048
I don't like it at all, sir.
Fancy dress, I take it?

142
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,050
- What's the matter with it?
- I have never been sympathetic...

143
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:39,854
- to the caricaturing
of the poor and needy, sir.
- Who's caricaturing?

144
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:41,857
Burrows doesn't know
about the expedition, sir.

145
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:44,260
I'm going out on the road to find out
what it's like to be poor and needy,

146
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,262
and then I'm going
to make a picture about it.

147
00:08:46,263 --> 00:08:48,399
If you'll permit me to say so, sir,
the subject is not an interesting one.

148
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,402
The poor know all about poverty...

149
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:52,771
and only the morbid rich
would find the topic glamorous.

150
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:54,774
But I'm doing it for the poor.
Don't you understand?

151
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:56,777
I doubt if they would
appreciate it, sir.

152
00:08:56,777 --> 00:09:00,014
They rather resent the invasion of their
privacy, I believe quite properly, sir.

153
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:03,018
Also, such excursions can be
extremely dangerous, sir.

154
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:06,155
I worked for a gentleman once
who likewise, with two friends,

155
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:10,161
accoutred themselves as you have,
sir, and then went out for a lark.

156
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:12,163
They have not been
heard from since.

157
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:14,299
- That was some time ago?
- 1912, sir.

158
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,938
- Huh.
- You see, sir, rich people...

159
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:20,241
and theorists--
who are usually rich people--

160
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:22,243
think of poverty in the negative,

161
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:24,246
as the lack of riches--

162
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:26,416
as disease might be called
the lack of health.

163
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,452
But it isn't, sir.
Poverty is not the lack of anything,

164
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:32,256
but a positive plague,
virulent in itself,

165
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:35,427
contagious as cholera,
with filth, criminality,

166
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:39,266
vice and despair as only
a few of its symptoms.

167
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:43,137
It is to be stayed away from,
even for purposes of study.

168
00:09:43,137 --> 00:09:45,239
It is to be shunned.

169
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,409
You seem to have made
quite a study of it.

170
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,148
Quite unwillingly, sir.
Will that be all, sir?

- Oh.
- As a matter of fact, sir,

175
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:07,435
I don't like the idea of a gentleman
of your inexperience...

leaving with only ten cents
in his pockets,

177
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:12,042
so I took
the extreme liberty, sir,

178
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:14,778
of having a studio
identification card...

She'll beg me for it.
Don't you understand?
She's got to give it to me.
