1
00:00:50,047 --> 00:00:52,038
(distant siren)

2
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:02,278
(water dripping)

3
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:06,087
(man) Cecilia was the first to go.

4
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,158
(siren approaches)

5
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:12,162
(voices over two-way radio)

6
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:32,478
(siren starts)

7
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,158
(heart monitor beeping)

8
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,716
What are you doing here, honey?

9
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:53,004
You're not even old enough
to know how bad life gets.

10
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:56,716
Obviously, Doctor,
you've never been a 1 3-year-old girl.

11
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:33,285
Everyone dates
the demise of our neighbourhood...

12
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:35,881
..from the suicides of the Lisbon girls.

13
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:40,920
People saw their clairvoyance in
the wiped-out elms, the harsh sunlight...

14
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:44,204
..and the continuing decline
of our auto industry.

15
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:48,435
Even then, as teenagers,
we tried to put the pieces together.

16
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:50,957
We still can't.

17
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:54,198
Now whenever we run into each other
at lunches or parties...

18
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:57,404
..we find ourselves going over
the evidence one more time.

19
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:00,559
All to understand those five girls,...

20
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,276
..who, after all these years,
we can't get out of our minds.

21
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,796
Cecilia, the youngest, was 1 3.

22
00:03:11,807 --> 00:03:14,401
And Lux was 1 4.

23
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,881
Bonnie was 1 5.

24
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:21,356
Mary was 1 6.

25
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:26,276
And Therese was 1 7.

26
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:33,081
No one could understand how Mrs Lisbon
and Mr Lisbon, our math teacher,...

27
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:35,840
..had produced such beautiful creatures.

28
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:42,081
Paul Baldino claimed to have
found Cecilia on her first attempt.

29
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,237
Hey, l was the one who found her.

30
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:48,557
l was in the storm sewer under my house.
There's all these tunnels.

31
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:50,638
You could get into anyone's house.

32
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:52,718
When Paul said this, we believed him...

33
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:55,799
..because he was the son
of Sammy ''the Shark'' Baldino,...

34
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:58,196
..and we knew about his escape tunnel.

35
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:01,916
So l went up, thinking l could see
one of those girls taking a shower!

36
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,406
Right!

37
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:05,205
And l walk in...

38
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,005
..and l see blood everywhere.

39
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,240
So l turned around, went for the stairs
and right back out the tunnel.

40
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:13,878
l had to tell you guys that story.

41
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,483
l'll see you guys later, all right?

42
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:23,126
- (woman) l heard there was an accident.
- (woman #2) lt was no accident, Joan.

43
00:04:23,207 --> 00:04:25,402
Of course the parents are to blame!

44
00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:28,202
l heard they found the razor in the toilet...

45
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,836
Everyone had an opinion
as to why Cecilia had tried to kill herself.

46
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:35,883
That girl didn't want to die.
She just wanted out of that house.

47
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,561
She wanted out
of that decorating scheme.

48
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:45,882
The most popular theory
held Dominic Palazzolo to blame.

49
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:51,202
Dominic was staying with relatives
until his family got settled in New Mexico.

50
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:54,404
He was the first in our neighbourhood
to wear sunglasses,...

51
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:57,206
..and within a week of his arrival
he'd fallen in love.

52
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:02,115
The object of his desire wasn't Cecilia,
but Diana Porter.

53
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:08,645
l love her!

54
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:12,879
When Diana Porter left on vacation
in Switzerland, Dominic denounced God.

55
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,438
To prove the validity of his love...

56
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:19,883
..he jumped off the roof
of his relatives' house.

57
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:43,921
Ahem! l'm gonna
show you some images,...

58
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:47,360
..and, uh... you tell me...

59
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:51,358
..what they remind you of.

60
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,279
OK?

61
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,278
A banana.

62
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:19,678
A swamp.

63
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:30,004
An Afro.

64
00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:50,885
l don't think Cecilia
truly meant to end her life.

65
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,318
Her act was a cry for help.

66
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:57,518
l know you're very strict,...

67
00:06:57,607 --> 00:07:02,317
..but l think that Cecilia would benefit
by having a social outlet...

68
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:05,160
..outside of the codification of school,...

69
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,917
..where she could interact
with males her own age.

70
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:21,802
Peter Sisten had helped Mr Lisbon install
a model of the solar system in his class.

71
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:24,799
And in return Mr Lisbon
invited him for dinner.

72
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:27,196
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts,...

73
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:31,121
..which we are about to receive from thy
bounty, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

74
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:32,806
Amen.

75
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:35,481
Lux, please, put your shirt on this instant.

76
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,558
(whispers) Sorry.

77
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,800
- Thank you, dear.
- Can you pass the salt, please?

78
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:46,606
- Ham?
- Thank you.

79
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,599
- Sweetheart, would you like some peas?
- l hate peas.

80
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:50,881
Here.

81
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:54,041
(father) That's a nice-looking ham, dear.

82
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:59,000
- Well, thank you, honey.
- (girl) Mm, this is good.

83
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:02,079
So, Peter, are you an aviation enthusiast?

84
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:07,084
Well, l don't know if l'd call myself
an enthusiast, but l like planes.

85
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:10,679
Ah.

86
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:14,316
Uh, Peter, are you on the football squad?

87
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,680
Um, no, l play it,
but l'm not actually on the team.

88
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:19,962
- Oh, l see.
- (father) Ah, not a team player.

89
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:21,639
Do you like to wrestle?

90
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:26,078
- (girls laugh)
- (father) You OK, Peter?

91
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:30,797
The Brazilian turbot frog was added to
the endangered species list today.

92
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:33,801
- That's the third animal this year.
- Oh, dear.

93
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,685
The turbot frog?
l don't think l've ever heard of...

94
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,962
Um, excuse me, may l use the rest room?

95
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:42,039
Oh, of course. The one down here
isn't working very well.

96
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:45,324
- Go upstairs through Cecilia's room.
- OK. Thanks.

97
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:52,722
- (knocking)
- Hold... Hold on.

98
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:56,121
(giggles) l thought you'd died in there.

99
00:09:57,367 --> 00:10:00,643
Are you done hogging the bathroom?
l need something.

100
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,604
Do you mind?

101
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:13,806
(giggles)

102
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,677
- Thank you very much.
- You forgetting something?

103
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:26,717
Oh, Peter. Here's a little aerofoil
l thought you might find amusing.

104
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:28,638
lt's a...

105
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:32,083
..demonstration of
Bernoulli's principle: lift.

106
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:38,045
From that time on,
the Lisbon house began to change.

107
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:43,677
Almost every day,...

108
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,645
..and even when
she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,...

109
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:49,116
..Lux would suntan wearing a swimsuit...

110
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:54,361
..that caused the knife sharpener to give
her a 1 5-minute demonstration for free.

111
00:10:57,287 --> 00:11:01,166
Following the doctor's orders,
two weeks after Cecilia returned home...

112
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:06,037
..Mr Lisbon persuaded his wife to allow
the girls to throw the first and only party...

113
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:07,924
..of their short lives.

114
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:18,518
There. ls that OK?

115
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:22,278
l'm gonna get dressed.

116
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:33,282
- Welcome!
- Good evening, Mrs Lisbon.

117
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,358
Come on in.

118
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:39,997
The party's in the basement.

119
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:46,522
Just go on round to the left,
and then down the stairs.

120
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:49,476
(mellow middle-of-the-road music )

121
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,519
Hi, l'm Bonaventure.

122
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:01,562
Hi.

123
00:12:01,647 --> 00:12:03,638
- Hi. Tim.
- Nice to meet you.

124
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:06,686
Hi.

125
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:11,357
- Would you like some punch?
- Yeah.

126
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:13,521
Thanks.

127
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,598
- Hi.
- Hi.

128
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:18,044
Thanks.

129
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:20,718
- Hi.
- Thank you.

130
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,124
- Hey.
- Hi.

131
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:27,004
Do you wanna sit down?

132
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:29,282
- Yeah.
- Me too.

133
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:52,764
(nervous laughter)

134
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:10,998
Um, how did your SATs go?

135
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,445
OK.

136
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,324
Good.

137
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:18,316
Do you know where you're applying yet?

138
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:22,243
Well, no, but my parents
are pushing towards Yale...

139
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:24,318
..cos that's where my dad went.

140
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:27,678
That's nice.

141
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:32,476
You have to imagine
what it'd be like when...

142
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:36,480
..out of the sun would come the Hun
and his Messerschmitt coming down.

143
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,320
And boys, l swear,
two or three years older than you...

144
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:43,116
..would be in this - the P51 B Mustang.
B for what? For bull's-eye, see?

145
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:47,279
You've heard of Yale?

146
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,358
Oh, yeah.

147
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:52,245
This punch is fantastic.

148
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,921
- Can l give you more?
- Sure. What's in it?

149
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,960
Juices. Some cherry, pineapple.

150
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:03,004
You know, l uh... l love pineapple.

151
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:06,279
Really?

152
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:19,837
This baby would come in, and this won
the war for the United Kingdom. You see?

153
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,762
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

154
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:27,844
And it's this kind of, uh...
this kind of equipment that makes, uh...

155
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:30,122
..a model work.

156
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:33,638
Here's Joe.

157
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,198
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

158
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:43,925
- Now, if he needs anything just call me.
- Oh, l'm sure he'll be fine.

159
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,166
Hi.

160
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,998
Hi.

161
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,363
- Joe! Good to see you. How are ya?
- Hey, Joe.

162
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:55,166
- Glad you came tonight.
- How's it going?

163
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:57,044
You're just in time.

164
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:58,966
Good. Hi.

165
00:14:59,047 --> 00:15:01,845
Everyone look! His ears wiggle
if you scratch his chin.

166
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:03,326
(laughter)

167
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:05,398
Joe, sing your song.

168
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:08,647
* Oh, the monkeys have no tails
in Zamboanga

169
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:13,559
* Oh, the monkeys have no tails
Got bitten off by whales

170
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:17,765
* Oh, the monkeys have no tails
in Zamboanga

171
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:20,486
- (cheering)
- Good job, Joe!

172
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,958
(boy) Good job, Joe.

173
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,242
(* The Hollies.: ''The Air That l Breathe'')

174
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:27,557
Where'd you learn that song?

175
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,918
May l be excused?

176
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,876
lf you want to, dear, but this is your party.

177
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:41,645
Oh, all right, if you want to go upstairs,
go ahead, but we'll just...

178
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:44,241
We'll just have to have fun without you.

179
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:47,521
Oh, look. He always chooses heads.

180
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:49,598
- Joe, what's it gonna be?
- Heads.

181
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,962
Joe, will you try tails?

182
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,919
Heads it is!

183
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:57,202
l'll show you again. Let's go.

184
00:15:57,287 --> 00:15:58,879
- Heads.
- Tails.

185
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,161
Heads.

186
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:02,841
- One more time. ln the air, Joe.
- Heads.

187
00:16:06,327 --> 00:16:08,716
Heads it is anyway. One more time here.

188
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:11,002
- OK, call in the air, Joe.
- Heads.

189
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:14,397
Heads. Not bad.

190
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:18,358
How you doin'?

191
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:20,244
Good.

192
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:24,124
- You picked it up really well.
- lt's my favourite song.

193
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:27,156
You know, you're... very beautiful.

194
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,918
l could paint you sometime.

195
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:34,124
Thanks.

196
00:16:38,727 --> 00:16:40,843
- So did they sing it to you?
- Yeah.

197
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:42,918
(voices and laughter)

198
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:46,601
(Mr Lisbon) Cecilia!

199
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:48,678
(startled cries)

200
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,403
Cecilia!

201
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:54,238
(gasps)

202
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:09,277
Oh, my God...

203
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:12,325
No! No! No! Don't look. Turn around.

204
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:16,436
Turn around. Darlings, turn around.

205
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:19,280
Don't look. Don't... Don't look at this.

206
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:22,355
Oh, Jesus. Please, God.

207
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:26,285
(Mrs Lisbon wails and sobs)

208
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:42,404
OK.

209
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:56,201
- What did he say?
- He said she was only 1 3.

210
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:00,238
(door bell)

211
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:12,042
Oh, hi, Mary. Are your parents home?

212
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:14,118
Hi, Father Moody. Come in.

213
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:23,398
Oh, hello, Father.

214
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:26,918
Please, sit down.

215
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:29,557
Thanks.

216
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:31,717
Come on, Miller, that was inside.

217
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,558
Ah, no. No, thanks.

218
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:40,324
(gulps)

219
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:47,802
How about we get the missus down here,
have a little chat?

220
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,878
Afraid she's under the weather.

221
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:52,686
(clears throat) She's not really...

222
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,158
..seeing anybody.

223
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:59,242
Well, she'll see her priest.

224
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:03,839
Ah! This kid's a sucker
for the high inside ones every time.

225
00:20:03,927 --> 00:20:05,918
Every time.

226
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:08,477
Excuse me.

227
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,158
Father.

228
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:21,124
Ah! Double play... Father.

229
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:24,998
Double play.

230
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:48,238
Mrs Lisbon?

231
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,279
(knocks)

232
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:59,756
- May l come in?
- (girl) OK.

233
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,358
Hello, girls.

234
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:07,958
l thought we could talk.

235
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:10,838
Do you feel like talking?

236
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:16,200
Well, if you ever want to,
you know where to find me.

237
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:27,678
Mrs Lisbon, it's Father Moody.

238
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,762
Mrs Lisbon, hello.

239
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:44,566
l wanted you to know that
l listed Cecilia's death as an accident.

240
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:02,199
An accident waiting to happen. John said
you couldn't get a policy to cover it.

241
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,403
l know. lt's so incredibly dangerous.

242
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:06,478
Let's give it a try.

243
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:10,959
Ready?

244
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:12,878
One, two, three.

245
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:20,042
(sighs) Oh, God. lt's just so sad.
l can't even believe it.

246
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:22,118
Footings are too deep.

247
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:24,524
Got that chain in your truck?

248
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,798
(engine starts)

249
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:45,238
Hit it!

250
00:22:59,287 --> 00:23:03,519
Our collection of souvenirs
of the Lisbon girls, which still exists,...

251
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:05,837
..started with Cecilia's diary.

252
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:09,317
Parkie had gotten it from Skip Ortega,
the plumber's assistant,...

253
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:11,637
..who had found it next to the toilet.

254
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:14,241
Tim Weiner - ''the Brain'' - decoded it.

255
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,363
Emotional instability.

256
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:19,644
Look at the i's.
The dots on 'em, they're everywhere.

257
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,119
Basically,...

258
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:25,243
..what we have here is a dreamer.

259
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:27,682
Someone completely
out of touch with reality.

260
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:31,043
When she jumped,
she probably thought she would fly.

261
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:36,883
''Monday, February 1 3th.
Today we had frozen pizza.''

262
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:45,045
''Thursday. Mom made creamed corn for
dinner. lt's the worst. lt looks like...''

263
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:50,400
''Mary chipped her front tooth
on the monkey bars.''

264
00:23:50,487 --> 00:23:54,116
''She made a big scene and had to
get it capped. lt looks normal, l guess.''

265
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:56,198
Here, give me that.

266
00:23:56,807 --> 00:23:59,037
Told you she had a capped tooth.

267
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:07,722
Elm trees. How many pages
can you write about dying trees?

268
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,398
Here, something about Dominic.

269
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:16,477
''Palazzolo jumped off the roof
over that rich bitch Porter.''

270
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,842
''How stupid can you be?''

271
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:23,396
''Today we went out on the boat.
lt was cold.''

272
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:25,523
''We saw a couple of whales.''

273
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:28,963
''Lux stroked the whale.
l didn't think they'd stink so much.''

274
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:31,686
''lt's the kelp in their baleens rotting.''

275
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,997
''l hope we can go again sometime.''

276
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:37,560
Let's read that. ''Lux lost it over Kevin...''

277
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:40,400
- ls it Heines?
- ''Heines, the garbage man.''

278
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:43,604
(Cecilia) Lux lost it over Kevin Haines,
the garbage man.

279
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:47,475
She'd wake up at five in the morning
and hang out on the front steps -

280
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:49,558
..like it wasn't completely obvious.

281
00:24:49,647 --> 00:24:52,559
She wrote his name in marker
on all her underwear.

282
00:24:52,647 --> 00:24:55,036
Mom found them
and bleached out the Kevins.

283
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,322
Lux was crying on her bed all day.

284
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:08,201
The trees like lungs filling with air.

285
00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:12,119
My sister, the mean one, pulling my hair.

286
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:20,956
(narrator) And so we started
to learn about their lives,...

287
00:25:21,047 --> 00:25:25,040
..coming to hold collective memories
of times we hadn't experienced.

288
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:30,485
We felt the imprisonment of being a girl,
the way it made your mind dreamy...

289
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:33,127
..so you ended up knowing
what colours went together.

290
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:36,165
We knew the girls
were really women in disguise,...

291
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:39,045
..that they understood love
and even death,...

292
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:44,717
..and that our job was merely to create
the noise that seemed to fascinate them.

293
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:47,840
We knew that they knew
everything about us.

294
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:50,398
And that we couldn't fathom them at all.

295
00:26:03,207 --> 00:26:06,119
Hi. Uh, Mrs Lisbon, l'm Lydia Perl.

296
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:08,402
l'm putting together a... Oh.

297
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:12,801
- Hi, l'm Bonnie. This is Mary.
- Hello, girls.

298
00:26:12,887 --> 00:26:17,881
Um, l'm here to ask you
a couple of questions about Cecilia.

299
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:21,046
Yeah?

300
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:26,965
Great, great. Um, maybe you could start
by telling me a little bit about her.

301
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:31,442
Did she have any
special interests or hobbies?

302
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:35,840
- Um, she liked writing in her journal a lot.
- That is great.

303
00:26:36,487 --> 00:26:39,524
Um, OK. Uh, did she...

304
00:26:39,607 --> 00:26:42,201
Did she ever talk about ending her life?

305
00:26:42,647 --> 00:26:44,683
What's going on here?

306
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:47,520
Um, you must be Mrs Lisbon.

307
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,916
l'm Lydia Perl. l'm from Channel 2, and...

308
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:51,998
You have to leave now, Miss Perl.

309
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:56,319
The suicide of an East Side teenager
last summer...

310
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:59,479
..has increased the awareness
of a national crisis.

311
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:02,286
l'm in front of the home
where Cecilia Lisbon...

312
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,403
Why can't they let her rest in peace?

313
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:08,036
..and write poetry,
tragically put an end to her life.

314
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,802
Psychologists agree that adolescence
today is much more fraught...

315
00:27:11,887 --> 00:27:15,004
..by pressures and complexities
than in years past.

316
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:19,126
More and more doctors say this
frustration can lead to acts of violence,...

317
00:27:19,207 --> 00:27:23,837
..whose reality the adolescent cannot
separate from its intended drama.

318
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:27,759
l baked a pie full of rat poison.

319
00:27:28,527 --> 00:27:32,486
l thought l could eat it, you know,
without being suspicious.

320
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:37,042
My nana, who is 86...

321
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:42,718
She really liked sweets.

322
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:46,798
She had three pieces.

323
00:27:52,527 --> 00:27:54,722
(woman) l feel sorriest for the mother.

324
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:58,436
(woman #2) You'd always wonder if
there was something you could've done.

325
00:27:58,527 --> 00:28:01,485
- l gotta go. See you later.
- All right, then. Bye-bye.

326
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:03,558
Bye-bye. (hangs up)

327
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:38,158
(wind chimes tinkling)

328
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:04,437
Don't worry.

329
00:29:05,247 --> 00:29:07,238
They took the fence out.

330
00:29:14,247 --> 00:29:16,238
(birds twittering)

331
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:29,358
God, you snore loud.

332
00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:31,918
(alarm buzzer)

333
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:15,440
Those girls have a bright future
ahead of them.

334
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:19,006
The other one
was just gonna end up a kook.

335
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:23,877
We didn't see the girls together as
a group until convocation, September 7 th.

336
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:30,076
Mary, Lux, Bonnie and Therese came to
school as though nothing had happened.

337
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:32,158
We felt if we looked hard enough,...

338
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,956
..we might begin to understand what
they were feeling and who they were.

339
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:40,325
All right, so if we have - these are
Venn diagrams, as you remember...

340
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:44,002
lf we have A and B intersecting,...

341
00:30:44,087 --> 00:30:46,078
..and A and B...

342
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:49,079
lf A intersects B, we have this area.

343
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:54,562
And if A is the union with B, we have
all of the circle, plus the intersection.

344
00:30:55,327 --> 00:31:00,447
These are the laws of
intersection and union. OK?

345
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:12,998
How's it going?

346
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:16,118
Not bad.

347
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:23,719
''Do a character sketch on the following
characters from Portrait Of A Lady. ''

348
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:26,605
The first one is... Ralph.

349
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:29,645
Um, he was nice.

350
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:31,922
lt was really sad when he died.

351
00:31:34,407 --> 00:31:37,240
Oh, my gosh.
l can't believe l just said that.

352
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:39,318
l am so sorry.

353
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,040
Reading about
the alarming suicide rate,...

354
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:57,324
..l talked to Mr Woodhouse
and some of the teachers here...

355
00:31:57,407 --> 00:32:00,956
..and realised that nothing
about this serious matter...

356
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:03,641
..has been discussed at this school.

357
00:32:03,727 --> 00:32:06,764
Quickly thereafter
green pamphlets were distributed.

358
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:10,522
(teacher) We thought green was cheerful,
but not too cheerful.

359
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:12,598
Certainly better than red.

360
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:15,645
They told us there were
80 suicides a day in America,...

361
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:19,197
- ..30,000 a year,...
- (all) Cheese!

362
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:22,597
..and alerted us to danger signals
we couldn't help but look for.

363
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:25,317
Were the Lisbon girls' pupils dilated?

364
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:29,722
Had they lost interest in school activities,
in sports and hobbies?

365
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:32,116
Had they withdrawn from their peers?

366
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,879
Hi. l'm Chase.

367
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:39,918
l know who you are.

368
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:43,919
l've only been going to this school
my whole life.

369
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:46,998
You don't have to talk to me.

370
00:32:56,287 --> 00:33:00,041
(teacher) For example, we have
two different types of economics -

371
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:04,917
..or so-called two different types.
The first one is called macroeconomics.

372
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:08,567
Look. She's laughing.

373
00:33:10,527 --> 00:33:15,123
He made her laugh! l've never heard him
say anything remotely intelligent.

374
00:33:16,647 --> 00:33:19,639
The boys who talked with Lux
were always the stupidest...

375
00:33:19,727 --> 00:33:22,195
..and made terrible
sources of information.

376
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:24,517
Squeezebox is all right.

377
00:33:24,607 --> 00:33:28,043
Let me tell you, she's the hottest girl
in the school for sure.

378
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,838
Do you wanna know what happened?
Smell my fingers, man.

379
00:33:32,327 --> 00:33:34,522
Nah, she didn't talk about Cecilia.

380
00:33:34,607 --> 00:33:37,679
We weren't exactly talking,
if you know what l mean.

381
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:42,440
But the only reliable boy
who actually got to know Lux...

382
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:46,964
..was Trip Fontaine, who only
eight months before the suicides...

383
00:33:47,047 --> 00:33:50,801
..had emerged from baby fat
to the delight of girls and mothers alike.

384
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:54,324
(whispers) l'm late again.

385

All the girls at our school
were in love with Trip.

405
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:23,438
All the girls except for Lux.

406
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:26,755
Trip told us his passion for Lux started...

407
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:30,726
..when he went into the wrong
history class during fifth period.

408
00:35:30,807 --> 00:35:34,083
He went out to his car
to smoke the marijuana he took...

409
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:38,558
..as regularly as Peter Petrovich,
the diabetic kid, took his insulin.

410
00:35:43,487 --> 00:35:46,240
On this particular day
he ran into Mr Woodhouse...

411
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:48,636
..and ducked into the nearest class.

412
00:36:02,007 --> 00:36:05,636
(Trip) She was the still point
of the turning world, man.

413
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:10,119
l never got over that girl. Never.

414
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:15,716
l mean... you know,
l loved a lot of ladies, but not like that.

415
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,798
That was real.

416
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:22,480
l'll never forget the first time l saw her.
l didn't know what had hit me.

417
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,964
l didn't know what to do...

418
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:28,681
..cos it was so easy
with all the other girls,...

419
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:30,758
..but she wouldn't look at me.

420
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:32,964
l, uh...

421
00:36:33,047 --> 00:36:36,437
l was never the kind to pursue,
if you know what l mean.

(documentary narrator)
The word hurricane was the name...

442
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:16,160
..given to nature's strongest storm.

443
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:19,876
A hurricane occurs when high pressure
and low pressure masses of air...

444
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:22,197
..come in contact with one another.

445
00:38:23,487 --> 00:38:28,481
There is often a significant difference
in temperature between the two masses.

446
00:38:29,247 --> 00:38:31,761
One mass is warm,
while the other is cold.

447
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:36,837
The warmer air rises
and the cooler air falls.

448
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:43,436
Likewise, the low pressure slides down
the sides of the high-pressure area.

449
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:48,237
They swirl in and around one another,
creating the beginnings of the storm.

450
00:38:50,447 --> 00:38:54,122
ln this footage, taken from
US Navy weather patrol aircraft,...

451
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,562
..we can clearly observe
the two masses,...

452
00:38:56,647 --> 00:39:01,437
..one high pressure and one low,
coming in contact with one another.

453
00:39:04,647 --> 00:39:07,559
The result is a surging storm
of tremendous strength...

454
00:39:07,647 --> 00:39:10,559
..that strikes with forceful determination.

455
00:39:17,127 --> 00:39:20,563

the most powerful storm known to us...

l think that sounds very nice, don't you?

472
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:38,282
(TV narrator) The rainforest eventually
gives way to expansive arid grasslands...

473
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:41,677
..that stretch to the horizon
in all directions.

474
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:43,485
This is the Kalahari.

475
00:40:44,927 --> 00:40:46,918
Uh, do you want some more pop?

476
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:49,998
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

477
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:57,078
Thanks.

478
00:41:00,807 --> 00:41:04,846
The wildlife spectacle played out
on these vast open grasslands...

479
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:09,318
..and in the deep recesses of
the rainforest is unparalleled on Earth.

480
00:41:18,327 --> 00:41:20,602
Lux, please put your feet down, honey.

481
00:41:24,287 --> 00:41:26,005
(muffled laughter)

482
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:29,124
The Kalahari and its vast open skies
provide the theatre...

483
00:41:29,207 --> 00:41:35,840
..for the drama played out by the herds
and the great cats that prey on them.

484
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:39,518
(Mrs Lisbon) Oh, my!

485
00:41:40,007 --> 00:41:42,475
lt's getting so late. Honey?

486
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,958
- l said it's getting late.
- Yeah? Oh.

487
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,039
Well, Skip, we usually
hit the hay about now, so...

488
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:54,764
Right.

489
00:41:59,247 --> 00:42:00,839
- OK.
- Thank you.

490
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:02,121
OK, so...

491
00:42:02,207 --> 00:42:04,721
- lt's nice to meet you, Mrs Lisbon.
- Yes.

492
00:42:05,687 --> 00:42:07,678
- Good night.
- See you.

493
00:42:28,527 --> 00:42:30,324
Bye.

494
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:37,443
Bye.

495

Uh, this is fourth period.
l don't have you until fifth.

505
00:44:12,287 --> 00:44:13,686
- l know.
- Oh.

506
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:15,962
l'm not here for math today, sir.

507
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:23,119
l'm here to tell you that my intentions
for your daughter are honourable.

508
00:44:25,367 --> 00:44:27,403
What... might those intentions be?

509
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:30,717
l wanna ask Lux to
the Homecoming dance.

510
00:44:33,527 --> 00:44:36,041
Trip, why don't you sit down
for a minute?

511
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:42,681
You see, my wife and l have certain rules.

512
00:44:43,567 --> 00:44:48,197
They've been the same for the older girls.
l can't change them for the younger ones.

513
00:44:48,287 --> 00:44:51,040
Even if l wanted to,
the wife wouldn't let me.

514
00:44:51,407 --> 00:44:53,602
True. So, uh...

515
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:57,517
lf you want to come over and
watch TV again, that would be fine,...

516
00:44:57,607 --> 00:45:01,486
..but you cannot take Lux out,
especially not in a car.

517
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,161
So l'm sorry, son, that's just our policy.

518
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:10,836
OK, sir, what if there was
a bunch of us guys...

519
00:45:10,927 --> 00:45:13,521
..and we took
all your daughters out in a group...

520
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:16,246
..and we had 'em back
by whatever time you said?

521
00:45:16,327 --> 00:45:19,683
- Are you on the football squad, son?
- Yes, sir.

522
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:22,645
- Ah. What position?
- Defensive cornerback.

523
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:25,082
Ah. Good. Good.

524
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:28,079
l was a... (coughs)
l was a safety in my day.

525
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:31,842
That's a crucial position, sir.
Nothing between you and the goal line.

526
00:45:31,927 --> 00:45:34,157
- Exactly! Exactly.
- (school bell)

527
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:35,646
Oh, well...

528
00:45:35,727 --> 00:45:39,402
So the thing is, sir, we've got
the big game against Country Day,...

529
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:44,197
..then afterwards we have the dance and...
all the other guys are taking dates.

530
00:45:44,287 --> 00:45:48,360
You're a good-looking fellow, Trip.
Lots of girls would go with you, l bet.

531
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:52,803
Yeah, well, l'm not interested
in lots of girls, sir.

532
00:45:58,927 --> 00:46:01,919
l'll take it up with the wife, Trip.
Do what l can.

533
00:46:03,647 --> 00:46:05,638
Thank you, sir.

534
00:46:07,247 --> 00:46:09,238
- lt's a graph.
- Oh.

535
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:12,366
Mm.

536
00:46:18,447 --> 00:46:20,438
Trip Fontaine and some of the...

537
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:26,117
..other boys in the football squad asked to
take the girls to the Homecoming dance.

538
00:46:26,207 --> 00:46:28,801
You know how l feel
about that sort of thing.

539
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:32,926
- l'm gonna be a chaperon at the dance.
- Oh, come on, Mom. Please!

540
00:46:33,887 --> 00:46:36,321
Your father and l will discuss it later.

541
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:41,805
Mr Fontaine,
may l speak with you, please?

542
00:46:42,727 --> 00:46:45,287
Now, my wife and l have had a little talk...

543
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:48,484
..and we've come to a decision
about your request.

544
00:47:00,887 --> 00:47:02,479
Yes!

545
00:47:06,527 --> 00:47:09,564
- (whistle)
- l'm taking Lux Lisbon to Homecoming.

546
00:47:09,647 --> 00:47:12,639
- l need three guys to take the other girls.
- (whistle)

547
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:21,044
l'll give you three joints, Trip.

548
00:47:21,127 --> 00:47:24,358
Come on, Trip, man. You pick me,
we can take my dad's Caddy.

549
00:47:24,447 --> 00:47:26,438
You gotta pick me, Tripster!

550
00:47:27,687 --> 00:47:30,076
Trip, man, you owe me.

551
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:32,886
l saved your ass
with Woodhouse that time.

552
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:34,639
- (shrieks) Thanks, Dad!
- OK.

553
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,287
- Who are the other boys?
- Ah, let's see.

554
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:40,564
Parker Denton and Jake Conley.
He's a very good student, dear.

555
00:47:40,647 --> 00:47:43,241
And, uh... Kevin Head.

556
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,443
- Who's taking who?
- Whom.

557
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:47,518
They're just gonna raffle us off.

558
00:47:49,727 --> 00:47:53,845
lt made no difference which pattern
of their dream dresses the girls chose.

559
00:47:53,927 --> 00:47:58,125
Mrs Lisbon added an inch to the
bust line and two to the waist and hems.

560
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:01,681
And the dresses came out
as four identical sacks.

561
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,038
- Everybody decent?
- Yeah.

562
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:07,558
OK. Come on.

563
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:13,923
Oh, l'm sorry. OK, there we go.
OK, come on, together.

564
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:16,797
- There's a leak.
- And Cheddar cheese!

565
00:48:21,087 --> 00:48:23,078
l'm so excited!

566
00:48:42,847 --> 00:48:44,838
- You ready?
- Let's go.

567
00:48:44,927 --> 00:48:47,521
- Ready, man.
- Let's do it.

568
00:48:52,727 --> 00:48:55,560
ln the end Parkie won
because of the Cadillac,...

569
00:48:55,647 --> 00:48:58,161
..Kevin Head because
he had the killer weed...

570
00:48:58,247 --> 00:49:01,000
..and Joe Hill Conley
because he won school prizes -

571
00:49:01,087 --> 00:49:04,443
..which Trip thought
would impress Mr and Mrs Lisbon.

572
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:08,601
- Hello, boys.
- (boys) Hello, Mrs Lisbon.

573
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:10,646
Come in.

574
00:49:10,727 --> 00:49:12,718
(Trip) Thank you.

575
00:49:24,327 --> 00:49:27,399
- Uh, who... who... who's driving?
- l am.

576
00:49:27,487 --> 00:49:29,557
How long have you had your licence?

577
00:49:29,647 --> 00:49:32,445
Two months, but l had
my learner's permit for a year.

578
00:49:32,527 --> 00:49:36,202
We almost never let the girls
go out in cars unless it's necessary.

579
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:40,200
There's so many accidents nowadays.
l'm sure you will be very careful.

580
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:43,279
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- OK, third degree's over!

581
00:49:44,087 --> 00:49:45,884
Girls!

582
00:49:48,007 --> 00:49:51,841
- l better get going. See you at the dance.
- See you there, Mr Lisbon.

583
00:49:51,927 --> 00:49:53,918
Bye, dear.

584
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:56,158
See you later.

585
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,238
Girls, come on down.

586
00:50:03,127 --> 00:50:05,118
The boys are here.

587
00:50:15,407 --> 00:50:17,398
(dreamy music )

588
00:50:28,687 --> 00:50:30,678
We got white ones.

589
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:35,241
We didn't know what you were wearing,
and the guy, the flower guy, said...

590
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:37,716
..that white would go with anything, so...

591
00:50:38,647 --> 00:50:40,638
l'm glad you got white.

592
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:44,756
(Mrs Lisbon) Why don't you pin them on?

593
00:50:46,647 --> 00:50:48,638
(nervous giggling)

594
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:59,158
(Mary giggling) Don't stick me!

595
00:51:11,127 --> 00:51:13,516
There we go. All right. Let's do it.

596
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:17,524
Bye, Mom.

597
00:51:17,647 --> 00:51:18,841
Bye.

598
00:51:27,527 --> 00:51:30,439
Oh my gosh, look, you guys.
Her car's there late again.

599
00:51:30,527 --> 00:51:32,677
Mr Leo's having an affair with the maid.

600
00:51:32,767 --> 00:51:35,122
l saw him follow her
into the laundry room.

601
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:38,961
- Eugh! He's so fat, and that red nose.
- Totally an alcoholic.

602
00:51:39,047 --> 00:51:41,481
What about the Hessens?
You know they're Nazis.

603
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:43,478
They're Nazi sympathisers, Bonnie.

604
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:47,879
They had a fit when the Schwartzmans
tried to join the tennis club.

605
00:51:48,407 --> 00:51:52,116
Nice aluminum siding(!)
Do they really think that looks OK?

606
00:51:52,647 --> 00:51:55,366
Mr Kriegers ordered that
from TV late at night.

607
00:51:55,447 --> 00:52:00,362
- lt's the Baldinos' barbecue tree stump.
- l have never seen them barbecue on it.

608
00:52:00,447 --> 00:52:03,359
Actually it's an escape tunnel
for Sammy ''the Shark''.

609
00:52:03,447 --> 00:52:07,520
- Leads to a river where he has his boat.
- Yeah. Paul goes there all the time.

610
00:52:07,607 --> 00:52:10,679
He can get into anyone's basement
through the storm sewers.

611
00:52:10,767 --> 00:52:12,758
- No way.
- Yeah.

612
00:52:13,127 --> 00:52:14,924
Cool.

613
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:30,239
- (Bonnie) Dad'll smell it on you.
- No, l got mints.

614
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:33,483
He'll smell it on your clothes.

615
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:37,162
l'll just tell him some kids
were smoking in the bathroom.

616
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,324
Don't let it die a virgin.

617
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,160
- That's gross!
- Yeah, grow up, Conley.

618

00:53:27,127 --> 00:53:30,483

00:53:37,527 --> 00:53:39,518

- Sure.

00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:53,758

We've been having such
lovely weather, don't you think?

639
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:11,085
Yeah. Yeah, it's been nice.

Good evening, everyone.
lf l could have your attention...

643
00:54:22,767 --> 00:54:26,157
l hope you're all having a good time.
Sure looks like it.

644
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:28,238
Here's a spot.

645
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:33,957
l'd like to open the voting
for Homecoming king and queen.

Did anybody see you come in?

650
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:47,880
No.

651
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:49,958
- What about you?
- No.

652

l don't want any, thanks.

660

Come on, just a taste. A tiny taste.

(whispers) Let's go for a walk.

691
00:58:26,007 --> 00:58:28,840
We better not.
We've gotta go back in a minute.

692
00:58:30,247 --> 00:58:33,603
We can keep an eye on the car.
They won't leave without us.

693
00:58:35,407 --> 00:58:37,398
My dad.

694
00:58:37,887 --> 00:58:40,924
Just tell him you had to put
the crown in your locker.

695
00:58:42,847 --> 00:58:45,042
- Hey, see that divot there?
- Uh-huh.

696
00:58:45,127 --> 00:58:48,836
That's where l reamed this guy today
in a cross-body block.

697
00:58:49,367 --> 00:58:51,358
- Really?
- (growls)

698
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:56,357
- (Parkie) Maybe they went with your dad.
- l doubt it.

699
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:00,796
- We're cooked.
- Luxie is. We're not.

(panting)

701
00:59:18,687 --> 00:59:20,678
Does anyone have any mints?

702
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:23,158
- Sorry.
- No.

703
00:59:27,767 --> 00:59:29,758
Bye, Parkie.

704
00:59:31,807 --> 00:59:35,004
- We'll walk you to the door.
- No, don't.

705
00:59:35,687 --> 00:59:37,439
Why not?

706
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:39,483
Just don't.

707
00:59:41,687 --> 00:59:42,881
OK.

708
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:46,077
Will you call me?

709
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:48,158
Uh, absolutely.

710
00:59:53,327 --> 00:59:55,238
- Bye.
- Bye.

711
00:59:55,327 --> 00:59:57,124
Bye.

712
01:01:01,767 --> 01:01:03,758
(birds cheeping)

713
01:02:29,727 --> 01:02:31,718
(Mrs Lisbon) Where have you been?

714
01:02:34,847 --> 01:02:36,838
Get in!

715
01:02:45,327 --> 01:02:47,716
(adult Trip)
l walked home alone that night.

716
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,480
l didn't care how she got home.
lt was weird.

717
01:02:51,047 --> 01:02:55,086
l mean, l liked her, l liked her a lot,
but out there on the field...

718
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:00,198
lt was just different then.

719
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:05,238
That was the last time l saw her.

720
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:11,682
You know, most people
will never taste that kind of love.

721
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:14,477
But at least l tasted it once, right?

722
01:03:19,687 --> 01:03:22,599
lt's time for your
six o'clock group meeting.

723
01:03:36,887 --> 01:03:41,119
Given Lux's failure to make curfew,
everyone expected a crackdown.

724
01:03:41,727 --> 01:03:43,126
(door shuts)

725
01:03:43,207 --> 01:03:45,880
But few anticipated it would be so drastic.

726
01:03:46,647 --> 01:03:48,842
The girls were taken out of school...

727
01:03:48,927 --> 01:03:52,886
..and Mrs Lisbon shut the house
in maximum security isolation.

728
01:03:54,727 --> 01:03:57,799
She had done more than
just take the girls out of school.

729
01:03:57,887 --> 01:04:01,004
That Sunday,
arriving home from a church sermon,...

730
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,965
..Mrs Lisbon commanded Lux
to destroy her rock records.

731
01:04:04,047 --> 01:04:05,844
Now!

732
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:07,918
(sobs) But, Mom!

733
01:04:08,007 --> 01:04:10,202
This is final, Luxie.

734
01:04:10,287 --> 01:04:13,677
- lt's not fair!
- l said now!

735
01:04:16,327 --> 01:04:18,318
(sighs)

736
01:04:30,287 --> 01:04:32,278
Now, Luxie!

737
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:46,724
Come on.

738
01:04:46,807 --> 01:04:48,798
Hold on.

739
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:54,796
Kiss! Please don't make me do this.

740
01:04:54,887 --> 01:04:56,878
Burn it.

741
01:05:03,167 --> 01:05:05,158
(coughs)

742
01:05:08,687 --> 01:05:10,678
Oh, Mom. Aerosmith!

743
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:13,361
- Come on. Don't make me burn this.
- No.

744
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,998
(girl) What's that smell?

745
01:05:18,287 --> 01:05:22,246
lt's all right. That'll do for now.
Give me these. Give me these.

746
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:24,958
l'll put them in the trash.

747
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:33,918
(coughs)

748
01:05:43,687 --> 01:05:46,247
(chain saw revs)

749
01:05:56,007 --> 01:05:57,645
(men whoop)

750
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:04,517
This was the time we began to see Lux
making love on the roof...

751
01:06:04,607 --> 01:06:06,404
..with random boys and men.

752
01:06:06,487 --> 01:06:08,876
- ls she naked?
- You can't tell. Hold on.

753
01:06:08,967 --> 01:06:10,958
Well, get it focused.

754
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:15,237
- Will you stop? Wait your turn.
- What are they doing?

755
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:19,362
- They're rolling around up there.
- Let me see. Let me see.

756
01:06:19,447 --> 01:06:23,360
Hold on. And she's on him and
he's rubbing his hands through her hair.

757
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:27,156
- Come on, let me look.
- No, it's my... lt's my telescope, Chase!

758
01:06:27,247 --> 01:06:29,920
- (laughs)
- Yes, and what else?

759
01:06:30,007 --> 01:06:34,637
Our male up there
seems to be in a Burger Chalet uniform!

760
01:06:36,607 --> 01:06:40,725
That Burger Chalet - you never think
those guys ever get lucky.

761
01:06:41,007 --> 01:06:44,204
She turns to me and asks me
if l thought what we'd done was dirty.

762
01:06:44,287 --> 01:06:46,482
l knew what to say. l said no.

763
01:06:46,567 --> 01:06:49,445
Then she grabs my hand
and goes ''You like me, don't you?''

764
01:06:49,527 --> 01:06:53,202
l didn't say anything.
lt's best to keep chicks guessing.

765
01:06:53,287 --> 01:06:57,326
(woman) Chase, honey!
Come practise your violin before dinner!

766
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:03,760
You're not gonna believe it.
Lux is on the roof again tonight!

767
01:07:03,847 --> 01:07:06,884
- Her hands are moving down.
- l gotta see this!

768
01:07:07,487 --> 01:07:10,843
- This is beautiful.
- No, no. She's on top of him.

769
01:07:11,607 --> 01:07:13,598
- What's she doin', man?
- Wait.

770
01:07:14,927 --> 01:07:17,077
Now they're done, he's getting up.

771
01:07:19,887 --> 01:07:21,684
- That's it?
- Popcorn.

772
01:07:21,767 --> 01:07:23,166
That was quick.

773
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:32,558
(mutters)

774
01:07:36,607 --> 01:07:39,724
Ooh, good morning!
Good morning (mumbles plant name)

775
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:42,556
Have we photosynthesised
breakfast today?

776
01:07:51,287 --> 01:07:53,084
(mutters)

777
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:55,158
Hello, Ronald.

778
01:07:55,767 --> 01:07:57,359
Hi, Eric.

779
01:07:57,447 --> 01:08:00,757
Your daughters haven't been at school
for over two weeks.

780
01:08:02,887 --> 01:08:04,878
You checked out back?

781
01:08:09,447 --> 01:08:11,836
(woman) They found a new math teacher.

782
01:08:12,687 --> 01:08:15,679
- Well, he's gonna have to get another job.
- l know.

783
01:08:16,807 --> 01:08:20,402
(sighs) How long can those girls
be cooped up like that?

784
01:08:39,927 --> 01:08:42,760
- Just go away. This is our tree.
- Girls!

785
01:08:42,847 --> 01:08:46,283
Girls, it's a little late. This tree is dead.

786
01:08:46,367 --> 01:08:49,882
- Why not leave it up to nature?
- lf we did, there'd be no trees left.

787
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:52,562
That's what it's gonna be like anyway.

788
01:08:52,647 --> 01:08:56,037
lf boats hadn't brought the fungus,
this wouldn't have happened.

789
01:08:56,127 --> 01:08:58,322
OK? Let's go.

790
01:09:00,327 --> 01:09:01,521
No?

791
01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:03,764
All right. That's it.

792
01:09:03,847 --> 01:09:07,920
l have an order to cut down your elm tree,
but your kids won't let us.

793
01:09:08,007 --> 01:09:12,523
- How do you know that tree's sick?
- lt had yellow leaves. The tree is dead.

794
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,758
Our daughter said Aritex is
a less aggressive therapy.

795
01:09:15,847 --> 01:09:19,522
lt doesn't work. l leave that tree,
they'll all be gone by next year.

796
01:09:19,607 --> 01:09:21,723
Will be anyway, way things are going!

797
01:09:21,807 --> 01:09:24,002
l don't want to call the police.

798
01:09:24,087 --> 01:09:28,922
Our daughters are standing on their own
front lawn. Since when is that a crime?

799
01:09:30,527 --> 01:09:32,119
Right.

800
01:09:32,207 --> 01:09:34,004
(Mr Lisbon) Uh...

801
01:09:43,407 --> 01:09:48,117
Clive, did you see those girls in the
nighties? That's the shot that l want, OK?

802
01:09:48,207 --> 01:09:51,040
Honey, move forward.
l want those girls in the nighties.

803
01:09:51,127 --> 01:09:54,483
Oh, God. OK.
Here, let's just back up a little bit.

804
01:09:56,727 --> 01:09:58,718
There you go. ls that good? OK?

805
01:10:00,327 --> 01:10:03,399
Four sisters of Cecilia Lisbon,
the East Side teenager...

806
01:10:03,487 --> 01:10:07,605
..whose suicide last summer focused
awareness on a national problem,...

807
01:10:07,687 --> 01:10:13,523
..put their own lives in jeopardy by trying
to protect the elm that Cecilia so loved.

808
01:10:13,607 --> 01:10:15,598
(chain saws buzz)

809
01:11:03,687 --> 01:11:06,599
For the next few weeks
we hardly saw the girls at all.

810
01:11:08,887 --> 01:11:12,402
Joe Hill Conley didn't call Therese
as he had promised.

811
01:11:17,167 --> 01:11:19,476
And Lux never spoke to Trip again.

812
01:11:22,767 --> 01:11:24,758
(Trip) You're a stone fox.

813
01:11:29,847 --> 01:11:32,236
The girls' only contact with the outside...

814
01:11:32,327 --> 01:11:36,002
..was through catalogues they ordered
that filled their mailbox...

815
01:11:36,087 --> 01:11:41,559
..with pictures of high-end fashions
and brochures for exotic vacations.

816
01:11:42,247 --> 01:11:44,158
Unable to go anywhere,...

817
01:11:44,247 --> 01:11:48,001
..the girls travelled in their imaginations
to Siamese temples...

818
01:11:48,087 --> 01:11:53,002
..or passed an old man with a leaf broom
tidying a moss-carpeted speck of Japan.

819
01:11:55,207 --> 01:11:57,437
We ordered the same catalogues...

820
01:11:57,527 --> 01:12:01,486
..and, flipping through the pages,
we hiked through passes with the girls,...

821
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:05,685
..stopping every now and then
to help them with their backpacks,...

822
01:12:05,767 --> 01:12:08,839
..placing our hands
on their warm, moist shoulders...

823
01:12:08,927 --> 01:12:11,680
..and gazing off at papaya sunsets.

824
01:12:13,247 --> 01:12:15,841
We drank tea with them
in a water pavilion.

825
01:12:16,687 --> 01:12:18,678
We did whatever we wanted.

826
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:23,755
Cecilia hadn't died.
She was a bride in Calcutta.

827
01:12:26,767 --> 01:12:29,122
The only way
we could feel close to the girls...

828
01:12:29,207 --> 01:12:33,962
..was through these impossible trips
which have scarred us forever,...

829
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:37,437
..making us happier
with dreams than wives.

830
01:12:39,287 --> 01:12:44,122
Collecting everything we could of theirs,
the Lisbon girls wouldn't leave our minds.

831
01:12:44,207 --> 01:12:46,198
But they were slipping away.

832
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:51,516
The colour of their eyes was fading, along
with the locations of moles and dimples.

833
01:12:51,607 --> 01:12:53,598
From five they had become four,...

834
01:12:53,687 --> 01:12:58,203
..and they were all living in the dead,
becoming shadows.

835
01:12:58,287 --> 01:13:01,757
We'd have lost them completely
if they hadn't contacted us.

836
01:13:01,847 --> 01:13:03,838
OK, one long,...

837
01:13:04,567 --> 01:13:06,444
..two short...

838
01:13:07,047 --> 01:13:09,083
- ..and one long.
- Mm-hm.

839
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:10,839
You got that? That's it.

840
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:16,118
''Help.''

841
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:18,558
''Send...

842
01:13:19,727 --> 01:13:21,558
..bo...

843
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,080
..bo.''

844
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:26,400
- Bo-bo?
- Bo-bo.

845
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:29,399
That's what it says: bo-bo.

846
01:13:29,487 --> 01:13:33,605
''Help send bo-bo''?
l thought you knew Morse code.

847
01:14:00,887 --> 01:14:02,878
Something here for you.

848
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:12,358
l got one, too.

849
01:14:14,607 --> 01:14:17,405
We racked our brains
for a way of contacting them.

850
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:21,480
Tom Faheem suggested we fly a kite
with a message alongside the house,...

851
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,717
..but that had logistical problems.

852
01:14:23,807 --> 01:14:26,958
ln the end, the answer was so simple
it took a week to work out.

853
01:14:27,527 --> 01:14:29,518
We called them on the telephone.

854
01:14:29,847 --> 01:14:31,439
727...

855
01:14:31,527 --> 01:14:34,519
- ..8221 .
- 8221 .

856
01:14:34,607 --> 01:14:36,802
(whispers) Get ready.

857
01:14:38,847 --> 01:14:41,236
- (Mary) Hello?
- Go!

858
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:45,917
(Todd Rundgren) * Hello, it's me

859
01:14:48,487 --> 01:14:53,197
* l've thought about us
for a long, long time

860
01:14:53,287 --> 01:14:55,278
Call us. 727 0487.

861
01:15:00,527 --> 01:15:02,916
- (phone rings)
- Shit! lt's them.

862
01:15:08,287 --> 01:15:11,199
(Gilbert O'Sullivan)
* To think that only yesterday

863
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:13,676
* l was cheerful, bright and gay

864
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:16,235
* Looking forward to - who wouldn't do? -

865
01:15:16,327 --> 01:15:19,000
* The role l was about to play

866
01:15:19,087 --> 01:15:21,647
* But in my hour of need

867
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:24,161
* l truly am indeed

868
01:15:24,247 --> 01:15:26,124
* Alone again

869
01:15:26,687 --> 01:15:28,086
* Naturally

870
01:15:28,167 --> 01:15:34,003
(The Bee Gees)
* Run to me whenever you're lonely

871
01:15:34,087 --> 01:15:40,083
* Run to me if you need a shoulder

872
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:46,481
* Now and then you need someone older

873
01:15:46,567 --> 01:15:48,797
* So darling

874
01:15:48,887 --> 01:15:52,402
(Carole King) * So far away

875
01:15:52,487 --> 01:15:58,483
* Doesn't anybody stay
in one place any more?

876
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:04,564
* lt would be so fine
to see your face at my door

877
01:16:05,647 --> 01:16:12,359
* Doesn't help to know you're just far

878
01:16:12,447 --> 01:16:14,403
* Away

879
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:16,478
l gotta go home. See ya tomorrow.

880
01:16:16,967 --> 01:16:18,958
l'll see you later.

881
01:16:22,527 --> 01:16:25,724
- (Lux) We're suffocating.
- (Mrs Lisbon) You're safe here.

882
01:16:25,807 --> 01:16:27,604
l can't breathe in here.

883
01:16:29,247 --> 01:16:31,238
No answer.

884
01:16:52,247 --> 01:16:54,636
- (Tim) What time is it?
- (Chase) Any time now.

885
01:16:55,367 --> 01:16:57,562
- Guys, there it is.
- What?

886
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:03,597
(Tim) Yeah, it's them.

887
01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:06,478
(all) Let's go!

888
01:17:17,447 --> 01:17:19,836
(whispers) l have keys to my mom's car.

889
01:17:27,327 --> 01:17:29,716
- (clatter)
- Shh!

890
01:17:42,967 --> 01:17:44,958
Maybe we should knock.

891
01:17:47,007 --> 01:17:48,201
(knocks)

892
01:17:50,447 --> 01:17:51,641
We're here.

893
01:18:01,647 --> 01:18:03,638
About time.

894
01:18:03,727 --> 01:18:05,718
We've been waiting for you guys.

895
01:18:06,247 --> 01:18:09,523
We got a car, a full tank.
We'll take you anywhere you wanna go.

896
01:18:09,607 --> 01:18:11,882
lt's just a Cougar, but it's got a big trunk.

897
01:18:12,407 --> 01:18:13,999
Can l sit up front?

898
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:16,886
Sure.

899
01:18:19,447 --> 01:18:22,598
Which one of you
is gonna sit up front next to me?

900
01:18:23,927 --> 01:18:25,519
Where are your parents?

901
01:18:26,407 --> 01:18:27,806
Asleep.

902
01:18:27,887 --> 01:18:31,163
- What about your sisters?
- They're coming.

903
01:18:31,967 --> 01:18:34,322
Come on, it's getting late.

904
01:18:35,527 --> 01:18:39,406
Wait five minutes. We had to wait
until my parents were asleep.

905
01:18:39,487 --> 01:18:43,082
They take for ever.
My mom's an insomniac.

906
01:18:47,047 --> 01:18:49,641
We better take our car.
There's more room.

907
01:18:51,247 --> 01:18:53,442
Think you can handle a station wagon?

908
01:18:54,487 --> 01:18:57,399
Sure. lt's not a stick, is it?

909
01:18:57,487 --> 01:18:59,876
- No.
- Yeah, no problem.

910
01:19:00,127 --> 01:19:03,358
- Will you let me steer?
- Sure.

911
01:19:03,727 --> 01:19:06,844
But maybe we should go.
l heard somethin'. Could be your mom.

912
01:19:07,567 --> 01:19:09,558
Come on in.

913
01:19:19,127 --> 01:19:23,086
l'll go wait in the car.
You guys wait here for my sisters.

914
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:42,438
(girls giggling)

915
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:49,523
(humming)

916
01:19:53,967 --> 01:19:55,764
(thud)

917
01:20:16,927 --> 01:20:20,715
These girls are making me crazy.
lf l could feel one of 'em up just once...

918
01:20:24,207 --> 01:20:25,799
What?

919
01:20:29,607 --> 01:20:31,404
(creaking)

920
01:20:31,487 --> 01:20:33,478
(hissing)

921
01:20:42,487 --> 01:20:45,684
We would never be sure
about the sequence of events.

922
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:48,158
We argue about it still.

923
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:54,842
Most likely Bonnie had died while we
were waiting in the living room,...

924
01:20:54,927 --> 01:20:56,918
..dreaming of highways.

925
01:20:57,927 --> 01:21:00,964
Mary put her head in the oven
shortly thereafter.

926
01:21:01,687 --> 01:21:06,158
Therese, stuffed with sleeping pills,
was gone by the time we got there.

927
01:21:06,887 --> 01:21:08,639
Lux was the last to go.

928
01:21:08,727 --> 01:21:10,718
(engine running)

929
01:21:12,287 --> 01:21:14,084
(coughs)

930
01:21:18,047 --> 01:21:22,165
lt's four o'clock on Sunday afternoon.
Do you know where your children are?

931
01:21:22,247 --> 01:21:25,239
(reporters' voices overlapping)

932
01:21:30,607 --> 01:21:32,598
(babble of voices)

933
01:21:37,367 --> 01:21:40,962
This has been Lydia Perl
with Channel 8 News.

934
01:21:49,807 --> 01:21:53,197
(Mrs Lisbon) None of my daughters
lacked for any love.

935
01:21:54,607 --> 01:21:57,280
There was plenty of love in our house.

936
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:01,242
l never understood why...

937
01:22:31,887 --> 01:22:37,280
After the suicide free-for-all the Lisbons
gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.

938
01:22:39,527 --> 01:22:42,121
They had Mr Hedlie pack up the house,...

939
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:45,244
..selling what furniture he could
in a garage sale.

940
01:22:47,487 --> 01:22:49,876
Mr Lisbon put the house on the market...

941
01:22:49,967 --> 01:22:52,765
..and it was sold to
a young couple from Boston.

942
01:22:53,367 --> 01:22:57,201
We, of course, took the family photos
that were put out with the trash.

943
01:22:57,287 --> 01:22:58,845
(clock ticking)

944
01:23:00,127 --> 01:23:04,837
We had pieces of the puzzle, but however
we put them together, gaps remained -

945
01:23:05,527 --> 01:23:09,156
..oddly shaped emptiness,
mapped by what surrounded them...

946
01:23:09,247 --> 01:23:11,477
..like countries we couldn't name.

947
01:23:14,727 --> 01:23:21,075
What lingered after them was not life,
but the most trivial list of mundane facts.:

948
01:23:24,127 --> 01:23:26,197
..a clock ticking on the wall,...

949
01:23:27,367 --> 01:23:29,562
..a room dim at noon,...

950
01:23:30,647 --> 01:23:35,038
..the outrageousness of a human being
thinking only of herself.

951
01:23:39,527 --> 01:23:43,122
We began the impossible process
of trying to forget them.

952
01:23:49,527 --> 01:23:52,678
Our parents seemed
better able to do this,...

953
01:23:52,767 --> 01:23:55,884
..returning to their tennis foursomes
and cocktail cruises...

954
01:23:55,967 --> 01:23:59,004
..as though they'd seen this all before.

955
01:23:59,447 --> 01:24:04,601
lt was full-fledged summer again, over
a year since Cecilia had slit her wrists,...

956
01:24:04,687 --> 01:24:07,155
..spreading the poison in the air.

957
01:24:07,247 --> 01:24:10,319
A spill at the plant
increased the phosphates in the lake...

958
01:24:10,407 --> 01:24:14,525
..and produced a scum of algae so thick
that the swamp smell filled the air,...

959
01:24:14,607 --> 01:24:17,041
..infiltrating the genteel mansions.

960
01:24:18,007 --> 01:24:21,682
Debutantes cried over the misfortune
of coming out in a season...

961
01:24:21,767 --> 01:24:24,600
..everyone would remember
for its bad smell.

962
01:24:24,687 --> 01:24:28,600
The O'Conners, however,
came up with the ingenious solution...

963
01:24:28,687 --> 01:24:32,760
..of making the theme of their daughter
Alice's debutante party ''Asphyxiation''.

964
01:24:32,847 --> 01:24:36,635
Like everyone else,
we went to forget about the Lisbon girls.

965
01:24:37,687 --> 01:24:39,882
(woman) She'll give him a heart attack!

966
01:24:46,607 --> 01:24:48,598
(muffled voices)

967
01:25:08,207 --> 01:25:10,198
(muffled voices)

968
01:25:23,127 --> 01:25:25,118
Hi, Parkie.

969
01:25:25,647 --> 01:25:27,444
(vomits)

970
01:25:29,287 --> 01:25:31,676
Al's got the acting bug, you know.

971
01:25:33,247 --> 01:25:35,442
- She caught it from Pinkie.
- (laughter)

972
01:25:36,567 --> 01:25:39,639
And l want to announce tonight
that next fall...

973
01:25:39,727 --> 01:25:42,924
..Alice is going to
a little school in New Haven(!)

974
01:25:43,807 --> 01:25:45,525
(laughter)

975
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:48,724
l hear they have
a great drama school out there.

976
01:25:48,807 --> 01:25:52,846
- ln fact, Sam, didn't your father build it?
- That's the law school.

977
01:25:54,527 --> 01:25:58,122
We're so proud of Alice.
We really couldn't be prouder.

978
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:00,478
(all toast)

979
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:08,077
l've had it.

980
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:10,283
Goodbye, cruel world.

981
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:18,760
No, no, no, you don't understand me!

982
01:26:18,847 --> 01:26:21,236
l'm a teenager. l got problems!

983
01:26:22,007 --> 01:26:23,998
(laughter)

984
01:26:31,407 --> 01:26:34,205
So much has been said
about the girls over the years.

985
01:26:36,887 --> 01:26:39,276
But we have never found an answer.

986
01:26:41,887 --> 01:26:44,959
lt didn't matter in the end
how old they had been,...

987
01:26:46,487 --> 01:26:48,478
..or that they were girls.

988
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:53,520
But only that we had loved them,...

989
01:26:53,607 --> 01:26:55,996
..and that they hadn't heard us calling,...

990
01:26:56,087 --> 01:27:00,046
..still do not hear us calling them
out of those rooms...

991
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:02,960
..where they went to be alone
for all time,...

992
01:27:04,327 --> 01:27:08,525
..and where we will never find the pieces
to put them back together.

993
01:27:23,887 --> 01:27:25,878
