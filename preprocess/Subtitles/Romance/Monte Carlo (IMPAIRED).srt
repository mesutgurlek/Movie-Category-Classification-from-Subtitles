was her favorite.

is that we are being upgraded.

much of a difference anyway.

better over there already.

about asking you this.

me to marry you tonight

about to happen for me.

I single handedly chose the
worst tour in all of Paris.

How did you choose it?

Meg, I’m not quite up to reviewing my process right now.

that I'm sorry, okay?

00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,442
Because I'll be here

661
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,236
all week.

662
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,411
Oh. My father says
we can build 20 schools

663
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,703
with the money
we will raise.

664
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,286
That's amazing.

665
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,997
That's a lot of futures
you're changing.

666
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,710
It almost makes
dressing up worth it.

667
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,293
Well, people are maybe
looking at your necklace,

668
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,596
but me, I have been
admiring the boots.

669
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,643
Theo.
Dom, how are you?

670
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,890
Good. You?

671
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,642
This is Cordelia
Winthrop Scott.

672
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,806
Prince Domenico da Silvano.

673
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,858
Oh, uh, how do you do?

674
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,526
Fine, thank you.

675
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,442
Hello.

676
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,153
Hey, how you doing?
MEG: Yeah hi.

677
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,323
Hey, Cordelia, you were
supposed to wait by the door.

678
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,076
I was, but then he had
me working the room.

679
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,156
DOMENICO: Would you
care to dance?

680
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,411
No, thank you, Dom.

681
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,787
He's not talking to you.

682
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,337
Enchantée.

683
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,677
My father is very
grateful to your aunt.

684
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,684
She persuaded your mother
to donate to our charity.

685
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,230
My aunt?

686
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:35,149
MEG: Alicia Winthrop Scott was married to your late Uncle William.

687
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,859
How do you know that?

688
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,404
Well, hello, it's called HELLO!
magazine for a reason.

689
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,693
He died two years ago
on safari.

690
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,982
Who? What?

691
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,532
Okay, you were born in
Shropshire, parents divorced.

692
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,613
Schooled at Le Rosey,
but you were expelled

693
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,664
because you set
your roommate's hair on fire

694
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,076
in her sleep.

695
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,376
Cordelia!

696
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,170
Aunt Alicia! Oh.

697
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,210
Well, don't you look lovely.

698
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,755
I'm so glad to see
that you're here.

699
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,262
Well, where else
would I be than here,

700
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,435
in Monte Carlo, where
I'm supposed to be?

701
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,478
At my ball, Aunt Alicia.

702
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:13,763
(CHUCKLES)

703
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:14,935
Yes.

704
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,270
I just wanted to come and verify
your presence for myself.

705
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,737
Some peace of mind
for your poor mother.

706
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,323
Well, lovely to see you.
Now if you'll excuse me.

707
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,613
There's something
different about you.

708
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:28,741
Different?

709
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,583
Yes. Yes, I can't quite
put my finger on it.

710
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,290
People do change,
Aunt Alicia.

711
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,718
Well, here's hoping.

712
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,213
I'm bored.

713
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,717
You can report back to Mother
that I'm doing as told.

714
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,598
Now, if you'll excuse me,

715
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,806
I want to dance.

716
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,689
Excuse me.

717
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,860
Well, you two seem
very close.

718
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:02,937
Mmm-hmm.

719
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,107
Everything is okay?

720
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,027
I'm so worried
about Cordelia.

721
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,740
(LOVE TODAY PLAYING)

722
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:17,794
I've been crying
for so long

723
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,706
Fighting tears
just to carry on

724
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,587
How long are you
here in Monte Carlo?

725
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,636
As long as possible, Dom.

726
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,092
Really?

727
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,263
Emma. We got to go.

728
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,385
No, I'm good.

729
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,682
Emma!

730
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:32,930
Dom is a prince.

731
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,727
Okay, my aunt is here.

732
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,224
Aunt Brenda?

733
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:37,556
Where?

734
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,890
Aunt Alicia,

735
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,101
here to see her favorite
niece, Cordelia.

736
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,981
Oh. That's bad.

737
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,688
And we have to
stay here till Friday.

738
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,364
Oh, that's good.

739
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:47,903
She totally bought it.

740
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,734
You see? We're good.

741
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,410
Meg, come on.

742
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,955
No, I'm telling you,
she thinks you're Cordelia!

743
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,782
You were just crazy enough!
Excuse me,

744
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,583
I'm going to dance
with her. Sorry.

745
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,205
It was thrilling.

746
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,794
Hello.

747
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,917

Taxi?
Yeah.

752
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,858
Okay, you have a taxi station
just over here. Straight on.

Merci.
You're welcome.

755
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,034
Oh, thank you.

756
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,839

You have to rotate every three

Classy.

765
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,744
You know,

766
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,076
I picked out a dress for you.

767
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,829
I fixed your eyebrows.

768
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,289
Why are you picking
a fight with me?

769
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,874
I'm not.

770
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,001
Always. Little digs.

771
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,879
I know what
you think of me.

772
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:36,262
You have no idea
how little I think about you.

773
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,510
You see, Grace,
she's just not happy

774

unless everybody
around her is miserable.

Emma.
Trust me,

776
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,023

minute you left high school.

following me, are you?

01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:01,193
But when it
comes to me

1645
01:46:01,272 --> 01:46:03,445
I wouldn't wanna be
anybody else

1646
01:46:03,524 --> 01:46:08,200
(VOCALIZING)

1647
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:10,623
I'm no beauty queen

1648
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:13,076
I'm just beautiful me

1649
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:17,664
(VOCALIZING)

1650
01:46:17,746 --> 01:46:20,545
You've got every right

1651
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:22,592
To a beautiful life
Come on!

1652
01:46:22,668 --> 01:46:26,013
Who says
Who says you're not perfect

1653
01:46:26,088 --> 01:46:28,216
Who says
you're not worth it

1654
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:32,020
Who says you're the
only one that's hurting

1655
01:46:32,094 --> 01:46:35,598
Trust me
That's the price of beauty

1656
01:46:35,681 --> 01:46:37,979
Who says
you're not pretty

1657
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:40,732
Who says
you're not beautiful

1658
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:42,438
Who says?

1659
01:46:46,567 --> 01:46:48,786
It's such a funny thing

1660
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:51,364
How nothings funny
when it's you

1661
01:46:51,447 --> 01:46:53,745
You tell them
what you mean

1662
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,122
But they keep
whiting out the truth

1663
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:58,670
It's like a work of art

1664
01:46:58,746 --> 01:47:00,919
That never gets
to see the light.

1665
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:03,342
Keep you
beneath the stars

1666
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:05,715
Won't let you
touch the sky

1667
01:47:05,794 --> 01:47:09,970
(VOCALIZING)

1668
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:12,434
I'm no beauty queen

1669
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:14,728
I'm just beautiful me

1670
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:19,309
(VOCALIZING)

1671
01:47:19,516 --> 01:47:22,065
You've got every right

1672
01:47:22,144 --> 01:47:24,397
To a beautiful life
Come on!

1673
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:27,780
Who says
Who says you're not perfect

1674
01:47:27,858 --> 01:47:30,031

you're not worth it

1675

Who says?

1680
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:45,543
Who says you're
not star potential

1681
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:48,049
Who says you're
not presidential

1682
01:47:48,128 --> 01:47:50,301
Who says you
can't be in movies

1683
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:52,930
Listen to me
Listen to me

1684
01:47:53,008 --> 01:47:55,136

don't pass the test

Who says you
can't be the best

1686
01:47:57,554 --> 01:47:59,682
Who said
Who said

1687
01:47:59,765 --> 01:48:01,938
Would you tell me
