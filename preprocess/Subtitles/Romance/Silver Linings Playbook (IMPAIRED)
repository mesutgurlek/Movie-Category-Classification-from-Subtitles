00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:20,028
<i>PAT: What, are you kidding me? Sundays?
I love Sundays. I live for Sundays.</i>

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,782
<i>The whole families together. Mom makes
braciole. Dad puts the jersey on.</i>

3
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:27,184
<i>We're all watching the game. Yeah,
it drives me crazy, and yes,</i>

4
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,541
<i>I was negative. You didn't even know
that I loved it, Nikki, but I did.</i>

5
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:32,963
<i>I just didn't appreciate it,
or you, before. ”</i>

6
00:00:33,918 --> 00:00:35,581
<i>Come on. Time to go.</i>

7
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:42,307
<i>I lost all that. I blew it. But you
also blew it. We can get it back.</i>

8
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:44,711
<i>We're going to get it back.
It's all going to be better now.</i>

9
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:48,975
<i>I'm better now and I hope you are,
too. And I'm going to appreciate--”</i>

10
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:50,424
<i>Hey, I'll be there in a minute, okay?</i>

11
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,127
<i>Doctor's waiting. Let's go.</i>

12
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:54,313
<i>I'll be there in a minute.</i>

13
00:00:57,248 --> 00:00:59,077
<i>That's true love.</i>

14
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:33,755
<i>DANNY: Yeah, that's when I had long hair.
People say I talk about my hair too much.</i>

15
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,744
<i>And it was just the way I wanted it,
but he cut it back too far.</i>

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,407
<i>He cut this side back too far trying to
even it up. I didn't tell him to do that.</i>

17
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:40,783
<i>I said, “Just cut it the way you cut it... . ”</i>

18
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:42,985
<i>PAT: Once you get in the right frame
of mind, I think anything's possible.</i>

19
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:46,759
<i>I think we get, we so often get caught
in this state of negativity and</i>

20
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:48,709
<i>it's a, it's a poison like nothing else.</i>

21
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,658
<i>DR. TIMBERS:... technically, you can take
him out against our recommendation,</i>

22
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:08,412
<i>but you assume a lot of liability
in the eyes of the court.</i>

23
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:10,688
<i>And he's just getting used
to the routine here.</i>

24
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:13,743
<i>DOLORES: I don't want him to get
used to the routine here.</i>

25
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:16,911
<i>Eight months is already long enough.</i>

26
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:32,736
<i>PAT: Hey, Mom. Can we give Danny a
ride to North Philly?</i>

27
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:36,712
<i>DOLORES: What? I don't understand.</i>

28
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:38,733
<i>PAT: Mom, no, it'll be fine.
It'll be fine.</i>

29
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:40,916
<i>DANNY: I guess everybody's leaving today!</i>

30
00:02:42,216 --> 00:02:46,858
<i>Hello, Mrs. S. An honour to finally meet
you. Pat told me all about you,</i>

31
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:50,038
<i>how God made you rich in character,
and you're the mighty oak that holds</i>

32
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,370
<i>the household together, and not to mention
the lasagne you make on game day</i>

33
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:54,340
<i>when the Birds play.</i>

34
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:05,037
<i>PAT: Danny was in for assault because
of crystal meth and alcohol.</i>

35
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,355
<i>DANNY: Bad combination.</i>

36
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,341
<i>Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder.
That was when I was an X-ray</i>

37
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:14,224
<i>technician with my ADD and my
anxiety. I had a lot of access to</i>

38
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:18,531
<i>medication and I took advantage of it.
That's when my hair was long, too.</i>

39
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,106
<i>But my hair only grew when I was
older. When I was younger, my</i>

40
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:22,842
<i>hair didn't grow because my brother...</i>

41
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:25,165
<i>Remember I told you about my brother,
he had a Jeri curl, and</i>

42
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,545
<i>I couldn't get a Jeri curl because
my hair didn't grow long enough.</i>

43
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:29,460
<i>I was so jealous of my brother...</i>

44
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,421
<i>But Wait a minute, Wait a minute.
Hello?</i>

45
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:32,731
<i>Yeah! It looks great now.
You like it?</i>

46
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:33,987
<i>No, It's good now.
Yes, it is.</i>

47
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,787
<i>Wait, you're going the wrong way!</i>

48
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:41,882
<i>What? Are you sure about that?
I'll bring him back right away.</i>

49
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:45,804
<i>You lied to me, Pat.
Danny's not allowed to leave.</i>

50
00:03:46,528 --> 00:03:47,487
<i>All right, Mom, just hold on a sec.</i>

51
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:49,154
<i>Let's just talk about this.</i>

52
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,303
<i>Mom, just listen--
Don't touch-...</i>

53
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,708
<i>... - the steering...
... wheel!</i>

54
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:59,199
<i>Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.</i>

55
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:02,215
<i>I'm sorry, Mom. You okay?</i>

56
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:05,516
<i>I am out on a limb for you
with the courts right now.</i>

57
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:09,095
<i>It's my fault. Pat didn't know.
Pat didn't know. He's my friend,</i>

58
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:12,697
<i>so he was rooting' for me. I'm having'
a disagreement with the hospital,</i>

59
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,406
<i>but we're working it out.
Take me back to the hospital,</i>

60
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,657
<i>but take Pat home, he's fine.
Trust me. You'll see,</i>

61
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,883
<i>he's fine. It's my fault.</i>

62
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:26,534
<i>Mom, can we stop at the library? I want to read
Nikki's entire English high school syllabus.</i>

63
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:30,636
<i>Mom, it's a good thing. I'm remaking myself.</i>

64
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:47,231
<i>DeSean Jackson.
What happened to DeSean Jackson?</i>

65
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:49,359
<i>Come on, tell me that one.</i>

66
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:54,178
<i>It's insanity. He spikes the ball at the one
yard line. The one fucking-yard line.</i>

67
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,086
<i>I mean, get into the end zone, dummy.#
I mean, he celebrates before he's even in!</i>

68
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:03,172
<i>You know something? It's nothing new.
Your team does that all the time.</i>

69
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:06,112
<i>They get close...... and then they blow it.
They got an inferiority complex.</i>

70
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:10,502
<i>Wait a minute, what are you talking about?
What makes the Cowboys America's Team?</i>

71
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:12,854
<i>Because we are, we're America's Team.</i>

72
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:14,437
<i>You should be ashamed of yourself.
We're in Philadelphia,</i>

73
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:15,839
<i>what's the matter with you?
You're a fucking traitor.</i>

74
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:18,324
<i>What's more American than a cowboy?</i>

75
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:19,703
<i>You know what's more American?
What?</i>

76
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:21,618
<i>Benjamin Franklin,
that's what's more American.</i>

77
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:22,611
<i>Benjamin Franklin?</i>

78
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:25,387
<i>Benjamin Franklin. The founder of
our country, here in Philadelphia.</i>

79
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:27,306
<i>You mean the guy with the...
... little glasses and the long scraggly hair?</i>

80
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:30,107
<i>What about the lightning with the kite?
He stood in the storm with a kite.</i>

81
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,838
<i>If he wasn't on the hundred dollar bill, nobody...
... would even know who he is.</i>

82
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:36,281
<i>What are you doing? No, no, no, no.
Don't touch them, don't touch them.</i>

83
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:38,266
<i>I didn't even touch ‘em. Why are you--,
don't blame me.</i>

84
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:40,106
<i>Who did this? Who took,
who took, who took the...</i>

85
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:42,826
<i>the remotes like this? Did you do this, Randy?</i>

86
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:47,508
<i>No, I don’t touch them. As a matter
of fact, I don’t know why you need so many.</i>

87
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:51,392
<i>Hey, there she is! Look how beautiful!</i>

88
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:53,422
<i>What!!
What’s this?</i>

89
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,876
<i>Everything good?
Mm-hmm.</i>

90
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,923
<i>Ahh.</i>

91
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:11,692
<i>Where is it?
It's right here.</i>

92
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:15,446
<i>You got it. Ahh, well, we got that.
We don't want them to steal that.</i>

93
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,015
<i>You still got yours?
Yeah, I got mine.</i>

94
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:22,457
<i>So what, you don't talk to me? You
didn't tell me you took him out.</i>

95
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,302
<i>Well, he's ready. Look at him.</i>

96
00:06:24,412 --> 00:06:25,943
<i>You didn't tell Dad
you were picking me up?</i>

97
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:28,345
<i>Don't worry about that.
I want to make sure when you come out</i>

98
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:31,083
<i>that you're okay, and
she didn't say anything.</i>

99
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,432
<i>You didn't tell me?
The court said yes. Don't worry.</i>

100
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:38,432
<i>Yeah, but what did the doctor say? Because
the, the court listens to the doctor.</i>

101
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:41,000
<i>Yeah, and the court said-
The court listens to the doctor, the doctor-</i>

102
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:44,742
<i>Dad, relax. The court said it's fine, okay?
Let it go.</i>

103
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:46,355
<i>Don't worry.</i>

104
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:49,772
<i>Dad, I'm in there because of the court.
That's the agreement that we made months ago.</i>

105
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,702
<i>It was a plea bargain with the courts.</i>

106
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,405
<i>The lawyer, he instructed me, he said
that what we should plead that, and</i>

107
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,933
<i>then I would serve eight
months and then I'd get out.</i>

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,001
<i>It's all under control.</i>

109
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:03,962
<i>Well... okay, okay. Congratulations.</i>

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,782
<i>Thank you.
So what are you doing with yourself?</i>

111
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:09,792
<i>You know, I'm going to start a restaurant.
It's going to be a cheese steak place.</i>

112
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:10,962
<i>How you going to pay for it?</i>

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,615
<i>I'm going to pay for it,
don't worry about it.</i>

114
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,420
<i>From your bookmaking?</i>

115
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:17,026
<i>Who told you that?
Mom told me. Outside.</i>

116
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:18,431
<i>I did not. No, I didn't.</i>

117
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:19,208
<i>You just told me outside, Mom,
what are you talking about?</i>

118
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:22,148
<i>Five minutes ago, we were walking up the
stairs, you said, “Don't say anything,</i>

119
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:23,762
<i>but Dad lost his job and he's bookmaking. ”</i>

120
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:31,034
<i>Why, Dolores? Why did you say that
to him? He has the wrong idea.</i>

121
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:34,937
<i>Everything's fine, Patrick.
I'm more concerned about you than anything else.</i>

122
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:35,817
<i>Good, Dad. Good.</i>

123
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:38,645
<i>Okay, the question, the big question, is
what are you going to do with yourself?</i>

124
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:42,705
<i>What am I going to do? I'm getting in shape,
I'm getting trim,</i>

125
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:45,742
<i>I'm getting really fit for Nikki.
I'm going to read Nikki's teaching</i>

126
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,897
<i>syllabus and get my old job back.</i>

127
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:57,133
<i>Nikki sold the house. She left.
Didn't your mother tell you that?</i>

128
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:59,603
<i>Let me tell you something. You don't know
anything about my marriage, okay, Dad?</i>

129
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,817
<i>All right? Our marriage...
we're very, very much in love,</i>

130
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:05,649
<i>okay? Just like you two.</i>

131
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:12,194
<i>Listen, Patrick, she's gone. She's
not around anymore. Nikki left.</i>

132
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:17,429
<i>What are you doing, Dad?
You know what? Excelsior. Excelsior.
What does that mean?</i>

133
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,102
<i>It means you know what I'm going to do,
I'm going to take all this</i>

134
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:22,113
<i>negativity and use it as fuel and
I'm going to find a silver lining,</i>

135
00:08:22,172 --> 00:08:23,906
<i>that's what I'm going to do.
And that's no bullshit.</i>

136
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:26,504
<i>That's no bullshit. That takes work
and that's the truth.</i>

137
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:04,367
<i>What the fuck?!</i>

138
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:09,144
<i>Stupid fucking book!</i>

139
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,022
<i>I just can't believe Nikki's
teaching that book to the kids.</i>

140
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:14,540
<i>I mean the whole time
-let me just break it down for you</i>

141
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,502
<i>- the whole time you're rooting for
this Hemingway guy to survive the war</i>

142
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:20,076
<i>and to be with the woman that
he loves, Catherine Barkley...</i>

143
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:22,653
<i>It's four o'clock in the morning, Pat.</i>

144
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,140
<i>... and he does. He does.
He survives the war, after getting</i>

145
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:29,298
<i>blown up he survives it,
and he escapes to Switzerland with</i>

146
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:32,806
<i>Catherine. But now Catherine's pregnant.
Isn't that wonderful?</i>

147
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,147
<i>She's pregnant. And they escape up
into the mountains and they're</i>

148
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:37,948
<i>going to be happy, and they're going to
be drinking wine and they dance --</i>

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,027
<i>they both like to dance with each other,
there's scenes of them</i>

150
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:42,930
<i>dancing, which was boring,
but I liked it, because they were happy.</i>

151
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:46,942
<i>You think he ends it there?
No! He writes another ending.</i>

152
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:51,017
<i>She dies, Dad!
I mean, the world's hard</i>

153
00:09:51,076 --> 00:09:54,061
<i>enough as it is, guys.
It's fucking hard enough as it is.</i>

154
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:56,202
<i>Can't somebody say,
“Hey, let's be positive?</i>

155
00:09:56,297 --> 00:10:59,260
<i>Let's have a good ending to the story?”</i>

156
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:03,165
<i>Pat, you owe us an apology.</i>

157
00:10:03,888 --> 00:10:05,156
<i>Mom, for what, I can't apologize.</i>

158
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:06,869
<i>I'm not going to apologize for this.</i>

159
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:09,837
<i>You know what I will do?
I will apologize on behalf of</i>

160
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:11,861
<i>Ernest Hemingway,
because that's who's to blame here.</i>

161
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:16,331
<i>Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway
call us and apologize to us, too.</i>

162
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,833
<i>Why didn't you run with me?
Huh!!</i>

163
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,192
<i>I was reading.</i>

164
00:10:29,201 --> 00:10:32,189
<i>Please. Do us a favour,
don't read for a while.</i>

165
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,647
<i>What are you wearing a garbage bag for?
I'm going to go run now.</i>

166
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:38,152
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
You have to fix this window.</i>

167
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:40,736
<i>I'll fix it when I get back.
Fix it now.</i>

168
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:43,047
<i>Get in the car, Pat.
You have to go to therapy.</i>

169
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:44,067
<i>I don't want to go to therapy.</i>

170
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,247
<i>You have to go. It's part of the deal.
You can't live with us and not go.</i>

171
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:19,181
<i>Is that song really playing?</i>

172
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,350
<i>We have music sometimes.</i>

173
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:25,974
<i>That song is killing me.
Could you please turn it off?</i>

174
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:26,952
<i>I can't.</i>

175
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:28,449
<i>What do you mean, you can't?</i>

176
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,122
<i>I don't have the controls.
I'm sorry, I-</i>

177
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:32,309
<i>Did Doctor Timbers put you up to this?</i>

178
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:34,916
<i>Is there a speaker here?</i>

179
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,084
<i>Is, is the speaker here?</i>

180
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:44,000
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay... I'm sorry.</i>

181
00:11:44,012 --> 00:11:45,824
<i>I'll fix all this, okay?</i>

182
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:55,236
<i>That was a messed up thing you did,
Doctor Patel. Alright!</i>

183
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,275
<i>That's a messed up thing.
I'm sorry, but that's... .</i>

184
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:58,584
<i>You can call me Cliff, please.</i>

185
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,184
<i>Yeah, well, Cliff, that's not the way you're
supposed to meet people, okay?</i>

186
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,686
<i>You should write that down
in your, I don't know</i>

187
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:05,182
<i>your little book you
write stuff down in.</i>

188
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,307
<i>I'm sorry about that song. I just wanted
to see if it was still a trigger for you.</i>

189
00:12:08,372 --> 00:12:15,205
<i>Bravo. It's a trigger.
I'm not going to take any meds,</i>

190
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:16,046
<i>I should just tell you that right now.</i>

191
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:16,935
<i>No, You have to take medicine.</i>

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,337
<i>No, I'm not going to take any medicine.
It makes me foggy-</i>

193
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:20,026
<i>No, you will have to take medication.</i>

194
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,367
<i>I don't want any meds, Doctor.</i>

195
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:28,502
<i>Look, I am not the explosion guy, okay?
My father is the explosion guy.</i>

196
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:29,000
<i>I'm not that guy.</i>

197
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,031
<i>He got kicked out of that stadium he beat
up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list.</i>

198
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:38,779
<i>I had one incident.
One incident can change a lifetime.</i>

199
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:46,653
<i>But I'm ready. I'm ready to take
responsibility for my side of the street.</i>

200
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,060
<i>She just needs to take
responsibility for hers.</i>

201
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:49,076
<i>What's hers?</i>

202
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:56,735
<i>What's hers? Are you joking?
Let's go back to the incident.</i>

203
00:12:58,002 --> 00:12:59,267
<i>I come home from work after I..</i>

204
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:03,406
<i>fight with Nancy, the high school
... principal.</i>

205
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,086
<i>I come home and what's playing
but the song from my wedding.</i>

206
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:09,320
<i>The song that you so charmingly
played out here today for us.</i>

207
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:12,097
<i>That's playing and I don't
think anything of it. Which is odd,</i>

208
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:13,069
<i>‘cause I should have.</i>

209
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:17,187
<i>I come home, what do I see? I walk in
the door and I see underwear and</i>

210
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,319
<i>pieces of clothing and a guy's
pants with his belt in it,</i>

211
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:21,054
<i>and I walk up the stairs, and all...</i>

212
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,085
<i>... ll of a sudden I see the DVD player,
and on the D-...</i>

213
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:24,491
<i>... -VD player is the CD and
it's playing our wedding song,</i>

214
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:26,212
<i>and then I look down and I see my wife's...</i>

215
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:28,101
<i>... panties on the ground and then-</i>

216
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:30,110
<i>... I look up and I see her naked in the shower...</i>

217
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,376
<i>... and I think,
“Oh, that's kind of sweet, she's in the shower.</i>

218
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:35,023
<i>What a perfect thing. I'm going to find
her and maybe I'll go in there.</i>

219
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:35,950
<i>We never-...
... fuck in the shower anymore.</i>

220
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,087
<i>Maybe today we will. ” I...</i>

221
00:13:37,097 --> 00:13:39,359
<i>... pull the curtain back and
there's the fucking history...</i>

222
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:40,223
<i>... -teacher with tenure.</i>

223
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:49,386
<i>And you know what he says to me?
“You should probably go. ”</i>

224
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:50,011
<i>That's what he says to me.</i>

225
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:55,103
<i>So yeah, I snapped. I almost beat him
to death. But now I get fucking</i>

226
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:58,307
<i>chastised for it?
I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so.</i>

227
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:02,872
<i>All right. Can you talk about something
that you did, before or after?</i>

228
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,078
<i>Yeah, about a week before the incident,
I called the cops and</i>

229
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:10,163
<i>I told them that my wife and the
history guy were plotting against</i>

230
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:12,299
<i>me by embezzling money from the local
high school, which</i>

231
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:21,504
<i>wasn't true...It was a delusion.
And we later found out from the hospital</i>

232
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:22,814
<i>that's because I'm, uh...</i>

233
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:26,042
<i>... undiagnosed bipolar.</i>

234
00:14:28,222 --> 00:14:32,666
<i>Yeah. With mood swings and weird
thinking brought on by severe</i>

235
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,740
<i>stress, which rarely happens, thank God.</i>

236
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:41,537
<i>And then the shower incident happened
and that's when everything</i>

237
00:14:42,703 --> 00:14:46,180
<i>snapped, so I then realized that,
oh, wow, I've been dealing with</i>

238
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:51,099
<i>this my whole life. And without any
supervision I've been doing it all</i>

239
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:56,159
<i>on my own with no help and basically I've
been white-knuckling it this whole time.</i>

240
00:14:57,742 --> 00:14:58,451
<i>That had to be hard.</i>

241
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,280
<i>Yeah. It's a lot to deal with, especially when
you don't know what the hell is happening,</i>

242
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,496
<i>which I do now. Sort of.</i>

243
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:07,636
<i>Pat, you have to take your medication.</i>

244
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,089
<i>I can't, Mom. I can't.</i>

245
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,152
<i>I will call them. They'll come for you.</i>

246
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,264
<i>Why would you do that? You wouldn't
do that. Why would you call them?</i>

247
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:14,068
<i>What's up?</i>

248
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,907
<i>I don't, I don't feel good when I'm
on them, Mom. I don't feel good.</i>

249
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:19,233
<i>I'm so much clearer without them.
Mom, they make me bloated.</i>

250
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:20,588
<i>I don't like the way it makes me look.</i>

251
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:21,935
<i>You've got to take your medication.</i>

252
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:22,323
<i>Why don't you just take your medication?</i>

253
00:15:23,228 --> 00:15:25,354
<i>Come on, I'm doing it with my physicality.
I've been working' out,</i>

254
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:25,691
<i>that's what I'm doing'.</i>

255
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,857
<i>Why is he wearing a garbage bag?</i>

256
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:29,409
<i>Why are you wearing a garbage bag?</i>

257
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:30,525
<i>To sweat.</i>

258
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:34,882
<i>Sit down. We're seven minutes in, no score.
Come on, help turn the juju around.</i>

259
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:35,863
<i>I don't believe in juju, Dad.</i>

260
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:39,198
<i>Come on, Mister Excelsior. You want to
be positive? Be positive. Sit down.</i>

261
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:40,721
<i>All right, all right.</i>

262
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:41,165
<i>Come on.</i>

263
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:42,570
<i>For a second.
I'll watch the beginning of the game.</i>

264
00:15:42,195 --> 00:15:43,582
<i>He says you're good.... . luck, honey.</i>

265
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:44,803
<i>What's that in your hand?</i>

266
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,140
<i>It's a... see?</i>

267
00:15:50,362 --> 00:15:51,344
<i>Handkerchief?
Yeah.</i>

268
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:58,385
<i>That's OCD. That's crazy.</i>

269
00:15:58,385 --> 00:16:01,186
<i>What OCD? I want my son to watch
the game with me, so sue me.</i>

270
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:04,864
<i>Just sit down, come on. I want you
to watch the game with me.</i>

271
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:08,305
<i>I'm not superstitious.
That's a small thing that I do.</i>

272
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:11,556
<i>If I make a lot of money, what's the
difference if I do this or that?</i>

273
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:13,375
<i>It's a small thing. Sit down. Come on.</i>

274
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:16,906
<i>I'm making crabby snacks and homemade.</i>

275
00:16:18,057 --> 00:16:22,375
<i>You see?! You see that?!
You're meant to be here!</i>

276
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,139
<i>This is special.
Everything happens for a reason.</i>

277
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:27,477
<i>That's why you came home. Embrace it! Embrace it!</i>

278
00:16:27,477 --> 00:16:28,882
<i>I'm the reason? I don't think so.</i>

279
00:16:28,882 --> 00:16:32,348
<i>Yeah, Tommy, Tommy, yes, yes.
I got your whole sheet.</i>

280
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:33,325
<i>Mom.
Yeah. No, no...</i>

281
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,103
<i>... I'm just confirming.</i>

282
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:35,372
<i>I'm just confirming. Okay.</i>

283
00:16:35,372 --> 00:16:36,199
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

284
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:39,502
<i>Can I do. . an interview for a
school project on mental illness?
No.</i>

285
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:41,715
<i>It's for a school project!
Don't pay any attention.</i>

286
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:43,716
<i>Who's that? That's not Rick D'Angelo, is it?
That's him.</i>

287
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:45,494
<i>Is he the guy who's having the problem?</i>

288
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:47,677
<i>People are stupid.
They, they, they, they don't know what they're saying.</i>

289
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,328
<i>Yeah, that's the one.</i>

290
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:48,870
<i>Don't let them hurt your feelings.</i>

291
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,020
<i>Pat, don't look for Nikki!
Take your camera and get out of here!</i>

292
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,473
<i>Patrick, please.
Pat!</i>

293
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,531
<i>Patty!
Don't look for Nikki!</i>

294
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,400
<i>Ms. Meckers!</i>

295
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,497
<i>Oh, God! Oh, God!</i>

296
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:28,864
<i>Nance! This is my lucky day!
Look at you working on a Sunday!</i>

297
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:30,724
<i>How are you? Hey.</i>

298
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:32,290
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

299
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:35,204
<i>I just came by to say hi, to let you know
I'm ready to come back to work.</i>

300
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:35,965
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

301
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:37,220
<i>I'll work full-time, half-time.</i>

302
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:39,941
<i>I'll sub, I'll work history,
whatever you want.</i>

303
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:42,413
<i>Here, let me give you a hand.
I'm sorry. I'm being rude.</i>

304
00:17:42,873 --> 00:17:43,375
<i>I got it. I got it.
I got it.</i>

305
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,064
<i>Let me ask you something.
Let me just ask you something.</i>

306
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,458
<i>Does Nikki still work here?</i>

307
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:49,674
<i>You know I can't tell you that.
But Doug Culpepper is still here.</i>

308
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,192
<i>Why would you tell me that? You
know he broke up my marriage.</i>

309
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:53,995
<i>What, are you being, a troublemaker?</i>

310
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,227
<i>You know, you look good.
Did you lose a lot of weight?</i>

311
00:17:57,463 --> 00:17:58,795
<i>I did, yeah. I did. Thank you.</i>

312
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:00,804
<i>Get away from me! Get away!</i>

313
00:18:01,057 --> 00:18:03,568
<i>I'm better. I just want to let you know,
I'm better now. Okay?</i>

314
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:06,578
<i>I'm better. I feel good.
I feel so good. Look at my eyes.</i>

315
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:08,178
<i>Look at my eyes. Look at how clear they are.</i>

316
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:11,090
<i>I'm not a complainer anymore.
I'm a positive guy. Okay?</i>

317
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:12,337
<i>You just have to give it some time.</i>

318
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:13,210
<i>Yes.</i>

319
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:14,653
<i>You know, a lot went down.
People will get over it.</i>

320
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:15,778
<i>It'll be all good. It'll work out.</i>

321
00:18:15,985 --> 00:18:16,829
<i>Yes! It will be!</i>

322
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:18,086
<i>I'm going to take that as
a silver development, Nancy!</i>

323
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:20,582
<i>A silver development!
That's a silver lining!</i>

324
00:18:20,828 --> 00:18:21,381
<i>Good luck.</i>

325
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:28,866
<i>Ronnie! Pat.</i>

326
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:33,818
<i>There he is! He's back!</i>

327
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:34,898
<i>Hey.</i>

328
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:36,340
<i>Welcome home.</i>

329
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:37,371
<i>Thank you.</i>

330
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:38,475
<i>Welcome back, man.</i>

331
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:39,394
<i>Yeah, I'm out.</i>

332
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:40,456
<i>Yeah? You're out out?</i>

333
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:41,165
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

334
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:43,446
<i>Cool, man. Wow, you lost a lot of weight.
I almost didn't recognize you.</i>

335
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,255
<i>Thank you.</i>

336
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:46,729
<i>I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital.
You know, work's out of</i>

337
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:49,990
<i>control, you know, she had the baby.
I'm really glad you're back.</i>

338
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:55,210
<i>I missed you. I really need someone to
talk to. You got to come see the baby.</i>

339
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:57,893
<i>She's beautiful. And Veronica
wants to make dinner for you.</i>

340
00:18:58,106 --> 00:19:02,028
<i>Congratulations on the baby,
but I'm not buying the invitation.</i>

341
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:03,897
<i>'Cause you think Veronica
still hates you?</i>

342
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:08,988
<i>I know Veronica still hates me.
That's not true.</i>

343
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:12,526
<i>Yes, it is. Nikki always said that</i>

344
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:15,255
<i>“Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar where
she keeps his balls, in her purse. ”</i>

345
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,487
<i>That's not true.</i>

346
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:17,964
<i>Ronnie! What are you doing?</i>

347
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:21,587
<i>Okay, it's a little true.
But if you think she still hates you,</i>

348
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:24,325
<i>you're wrong because why would she
tell me to invite you to dinner?</i>

349
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:24,999
<i>Hmm?</i>

350
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:26,262
<i>Did you invite him?</i>

351
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:27,244
<i>Yes.</i>

352
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:28,621
<i>Well, can he make it?</i>

353
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,947
<i>I don't know yet!  Can you</i>

354
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:32,899
<i>make it next Sunday?</i>

355
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:33,977
<i>Sure.</i>

356
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:35,283
<i>I'll see you next Sunday.</i>

357
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:38,195
<i>Now, you guys are still
in touch with Nikki, right?</i>

358
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:39,575
<i>Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?</i>

359
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:40,168
<i>Yeah.</i>

360
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,032
<i>Get in here, please. I need you.</i>

361
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:46,054
<i>Okay.</i>

362
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:51,243
<i>As soon as you left, the Redskins threw
a trick play, a pitch out to Randal El.</i>

363
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:54,926
<i>Andy Reid wastes a timeout challenging
it, loses the challenge, loses the game.</i>

364
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:58,192
<i>You're in this house, please
show some respect for what I do.</i>

365
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,916
<i>And we should spend time together anyway.
I'm trying to keep you out of trouble, please.</i>

366
00:20:02,197 --> 00:20:05,378
<i>I have very, good news,
everybody. Very good news.</i>

367
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:06,724
<i>What's that? What's the good news?</i>

368
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:09,705
<i>Things are looking up.</i>

369
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:10,760
<i>Oh, are they?</i>

370
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:14,006
<i>You know what, I knew why they
invited me over. I knew it.</i>

371
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:15,714
<i>Listen, she might be with that guy.</i>

372
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:16,555
<i>That, the... .</i>

373
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:17,187
<i>Oh, no way!</i>

374
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:20,491
<i>She--, no, she might be with him.
She's afraid of you.</i>

375
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:21,408
<i>She doesn't want to talk to you.</i>

376
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,722
<i>No way, Dad.
You mean, Doug Culpepper?</i>

377
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,373
<i>Put the phone down. You got to...</i>

378
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:25,081
<i>Wait just a minute.</i>

379
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:25,818
<i>... Put the phone down, please.</i>

380
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:26,538
<i>What are you doing?</i>

381
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:27,106
<i>Listen--, stop.</i>

382
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:32,774
<i>Pat!</i>

383
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:34,870
<i>You got to understand me. You want to
go back? Well then, stop this!</i>

384
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:36,146
<i>Then don't fucking do this.</i>

385
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:37,201
<i>Don't talk to me like that.</i>

386
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
<i>Well then, don't behave this way.</i>

387
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:41,188
<i>I got... a call asking to...</i>

388
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:42,002
<i>... check on this house. Pat</i>

389
00:20:42,903 --> 00:20:43,852
<i>Solatano?</i>

390
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:44,644
<i>Yeah.</i>

391
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:46,614
<i>Yeah? Missus Solatano,
Mister Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh.</i>

392
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:48,779
<i>I work this beat.
Look, I heard about the restraining order.</i>

393
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:50,678
<i>And I heard you went to
your old house and the school.</i>

394
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:53,814
<i>It's not okay.
I've been assigned to your case, so you're</i>

395
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:58,040
<i>going to be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a
favour. Respect the restraining order, okay?</i>

396
00:20:58,472 --> 00:21:02,573
<i>Five hundred feet. You hear what he just
said? You have a restraining order.</i>

397
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:03,417
<i>Yeah, Dad, I know.</i>

398
00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:04,201
<i>Thank you, Officer.</i>

399
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:05,869
<i>If you need anything... my card.</i>

400
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:07,728
<i>Thank you. Sorry. We understand.</i>

401
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:08,728
<i>Since when do cops have cards?</i>

402
00:21:15,322 --> 00:21:18,110
<i>Tell me one thing. Would you like
to be a guy who goes back to jail</i>

403
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:22,479
<i>or to the hospital? Hmm? So take your
medication and if you do fine,</i>

404
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:23,617
<i>we'll reduce them.</i>

405
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:27,305
<i>Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape
and get my life in order, and</i>

406
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,793
<i>then she's going to be with me. And
that's better than any medication.</i>

407
00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:34,880
<i>Pat, there's a possibility,
and I want you to be prepared for it,</i>

408
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,944
<i>that she may not return. True love
is about letting her go and seeing</i>

409
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:42,768
<i>if she returns. In the meantime,
if you listen to that song, I don't</i>

410
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:46,617
<i>want you to fall apart.
So get a strategy, okay? You need one.</i>

411
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,174
<i>Let me say something, I got to say something.</i>

412
00:21:48,717 --> 00:21:49,133
<i>Okay.</i>

413
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:52,273
<i>This is what I believe to be true.</i>

414
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:53,423
<i>This is what I learned in the hospital.</i>

415
00:21:53,618 --> 00:21:57,203
<i>You have to do everything
you can, you have to work your</i>

416
00:21:57,374 --> 00:21:59,546
<i>hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive,</i>

417
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:01,385
<i>you have a shot at a silver lining.</i>

418
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,611
<i>Work on a strategy, okay?</i>

419
00:22:08,516 --> 00:22:12,596
<i>Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this
party on Sunday night and it's like</i>

420
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:15,402
<i>a real hoity-toity thing and his wife,
Veronica's a real stickler for... .</i>

421
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:19,143
<i>I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she
wants me to wear, but I want to wear a jersey</i>

422
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:20,973
<i>that my brother, Jake,
got me from the Eagles.</i>

423
00:22:22,822 --> 00:22:23,336
<i>Which jersey?</i>

424
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:25,205
<i>DeSean Jackson.</i>

425
00:22:26,491 --> 00:22:27,527
<i>DeSean Jackson is the man.</i>

426
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:29,572
<i>Well, that settles that.</i>

427
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:40,782
<i>Pat! What are you doing'?</i>

428
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:43,642
<i>I got to go, man.</i>

429
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:44,652
<i>Why?</i>

430
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:47,736
<i>I can't stay, come on. I made a mistake,
I shouldn't have worn this.</i>

431
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:50,291
<i>Dude, you're fine. I like that jersey.
I wish I was wearing that jersey.</i>

432
00:22:50,562 --> 00:22:51,049
<i>I feel like an idiot.</i>

433
00:22:51,265 --> 00:22:51,767
<i>Are you comfortable?</i>

434
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:52,611
<i>Veronica's not going to like it.</i>

435
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:53,265
<i>Get over here.</i>

436
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:53,948
<i>Plus you got a tie on.</i>

437
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,386
<i>Don't worry about it, you're the guest of honour.
You come however you want to come.</i>

438
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:57,150
<i>Really?</i>

439
00:22:57,518 --> 00:22:58,130
<i>Get over here.</i>

440
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,948
<i>DeSean Jackson's in the house!</i>

441
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:02,622
<i>You mean rookie of the year?</i>

442
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:03,491
<i>Yeah.</i>

443
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,235
<i>DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson?</i>

444
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:08,782
<i>Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner.</i>

445
00:23:09,877 --> 00:23:10,395
<i>Isn't it awesome?</i>

446
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:11,622
<i>Not for dinner.</i>

447
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,395
<i>Look, he got us flowers.</i>

448
00:23:13,912 --> 00:23:16,877
<i>Oh, that's sweet.
That's sweet, Pat. That's lovely.</i>

449
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:17,591
<i>And wine.</i>

450
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:18,359
<i>Hey.</i>

451
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:19,128
<i>Hey.</i>

452
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:20,347
<i>Check this out.
We just redid the whole thing.</i>

453
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:21,781
<i>Wow!</i>

454
00:23:22,616 --> 00:23:23,761
<i>Tremendous. Tremendous.</i>

455
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:24,621
<i>Isn't it great?</i>

456
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:25,285
<i>Tremendous.</i>

457
00:23:25,365 --> 00:23:26,578
<i>Yeah, man, I'm,
I'm thinking of redoing it again.</i>

458
00:23:27,023 --> 00:23:27,233
<i>Why?</i>

459
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:29,274
<i>Because. Got to be making
a lot of paper to do that.</i>

460
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,321
<i>Yeah, we're doing all right, man.
I can't complain.</i>

461
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:32,395
<i>Isn't the market down, though?</i>

462
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:35,603
<i>It is down, but you know, she wants
more, so I'm giving her more, man.</i>

463
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:37,100
<i>Hey, you know my dad lost his pension.</i>

464
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:38,268
<i>I'm sorry, man.</i>

465
00:23:38,523 --> 00:23:38,824
<i>Yeah.</i>

466
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:39,922
<i>A lot of people. My uncle, too.</i>

467
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:40,587
<i>Really?</i>

468
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:43,123
<i>Yeah, but you know what?
No disrespect, it's not personal,</i>

469
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:44,269
<i>but this is the time to strike.</i>

470
00:23:44,854 --> 00:23:48,067
<i>You start snapping up commercial
real estate -- cheap -- flip it</i>

471
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,168
<i>over, you flip it over and
that's when you make the money.</i>

472
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:54,088
<i>But the pressure... it's like... .</i>

473
00:23:56,188 --> 00:23:57,352
<i>You okay?</i>

474
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:01,815
<i>I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody.
Listen to me.</i>

475
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:05,730
<i>I feel like I'm getting crushed and-</i>

476
00:24:06,087 --> 00:24:06,456
<i>Crushed by what?</i>

477
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:11,052
<i>Everything. The family, the baby, the
job, the fucking dicks at work,</i>

478
00:24:11,554 --> 00:24:15,117
<i>and it's like, you know, like I'm trying
to do this, you know, and,</i>

479
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,525
<i>and, and I'm like... suffocating.</i>

480
00:24:18,977 --> 00:24:19,453
<i>Holy shit.</i>

481
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:22,423
<i>You can't be happy all the time.</i>

482
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:24,112
<i>Who told you you can't be happy?</i>

483
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:26,455
<i>It's all right. You just do your best,
you have no choice.</i>

484
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:28,850
<i>That's not true at all.
You just can't.</i>

485
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,437
<i>Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!</i>

486
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:32,050
<i>I hope you're okay with Veronica's
sister coming over.</i>

487
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:34,230
<i>You okay with that?
Who?</i>

488
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:36,129
<i>Veronica's sister.</i>

489
00:24:36,812 --> 00:24:38,027
<i>Tiffany.
Tiffany and... Tommy?</i>

490
00:24:38,183 --> 00:24:40,043
<i>Yeah. Just Tiffany.</i>

491
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:41,024
<i>What happened to Tommy?</i>

492
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,986
<i>He died.</i>

493
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:44,541
<i>Tommy died?
Cops die.</i>

494
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:45,561
<i>How'd he die?</i>

495
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:46,108
<i>Please, don't bring it up.</i>

496
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:46,997
<i>No, how did he die?</i>

497
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:49,127
<i>How did who die?</i>

498
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,464
<i>Hey, Tiffany! This is Pat.
Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany.</i>

499
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:00,811
<i>You look nice.</i>

500
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,175
<i>Thank you.</i>

501
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:03,633
<i>I'm not flirting with you.</i>

502
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:05,517
<i>Oh, I didn't think you were.</i>

503
00:25:05,622 --> 00:25:07,744
<i>I just see that you made an effort
and I'm going to be better with my</i>

504
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,907
<i>wife, I'm working on that.
I want to acknowledge her beauty.</i>

505
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:13,447
<i>I never used to do that.
I do that now.</i>

506
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:16,593
<i>‘Cause we're going to be better than
ever... Nikki. Just practicing.</i>

507
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:17,902
<i>How'd Tommy die?</i>

508
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:21,989
<i>What about your job?</i>

509
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,973
<i>I just got fired, actually.</i>

510
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:25,920
<i>Oh, really? How?</i>

511
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:29,258
<i>I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that happen?</i>

512
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,205
<i>Does it really matter?</i>

513
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:35,159
<i>Baby, how's it going?</i>

514
00:25:35,478 --> 00:25:36,277
<i>Great, great.</i>

515
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:47,228
<i>We're going to go on a tour now.</i>

516
00:25:47,228 --> 00:25:47,729
<i>Let's go see the house.</i>

517
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,014
<i>Come on, let's go for the tour.</i>

518
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,407
<i>I've, I've been planning this forever.
I love our house.</i>

519
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:54,125
<i>I love our house.
I'm really excited about it.</i>

520
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:55,277
<i>Come on.</i>

521
00:25:56,277 --> 00:25:57,607
<i>Guess what it is.</i>

522
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,098
<i>Oh, it's a television.
It's a computer screen. Nope.</i>

523
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:02,034
<i>Just keep going, keep going, keep going.</i>

524
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:04,490
<i>It's a brick oven, it's a brick oven.
It's a light. It's a...</i>

525
00:26:04,591 --> 00:26:05,397
<i>Ooh, ooh, warmer, warmer, warmer.</i>

526
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,049
<i>... it's a drawer at a morgue
where they pull out dead</i>

527
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,494
<i>bodies and shoot them with formaldehyde.
Where would the body go, though?</i>

528
00:26:10,674 --> 00:26:11,106
<i>It's a joke!</i>

529
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:15,234
<i>It's a... fireplace.</i>

530
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:18,060
<i>In the middle of the wall?</i>

531
00:26:18,283 --> 00:26:20,096
<i>We have a port in every room.
Gimme an iPod.</i>

532
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:21,497
<i>Who, who doesn't have an iPod?</i>

533
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,371
<i>Well, I don't have an iPod.
I don't even have a phone.</i>

534
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:28,371
<i>They won't let me make any calls.
They think I'm going to call Nikki.</i>

535
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:30,017
<i>Don't worry about it.
Don't focus on that.</i>

536
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,312
<i>I would call Nikki.</i>

537
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:34,003
<i>I'm actually going to give you one
of my iPods. I have an old one.</i>

538
00:26:34,024 --> 00:26:34,987
<i>Gimme your iPod.</i>

539
00:26:34,997 --> 00:26:37,002
<i>Give it to me.
Thank you, baby, thank you.</i>

540
00:26:37,024 --> 00:26:39,046
<i>Of all the rooms there
are iPod ports in,</i>

541
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:41,254
<i>I'm happy you brought
us into the bathroom.</i>

542
00:26:41,323 --> 00:26:43,374
<i>I can play music for the baby in any room.</i>

543
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:45,243
<i>Can you play “Ride the Lightning” by Metallica?</i>

544
00:26:48,154 --> 00:26:51,019
<i>Pat was a history sub at the
high school, Tiffany.</i>

545
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:54,063
<i>Ask him about any president, he knows 'em all.</i>

546
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:57,379
<i>Here's a fun fact.
You know where the term “OK” comes from?</i>

547
00:26:57,598 --> 00:26:58,741
<i>No. No, I don't.</i>

548
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:00,231
<i>Where?</i>

549
00:27:00,463 --> 00:27:03,060
<i>Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth
president of the United States of</i>

550
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:04,839
<i>America, is from Kinderhook, New York...</i>

551
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:05,354
<i>Oh.</i>

552
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:09,119
<i>... and he was part of a club, a men's
club, called Old Kinderhook.</i>

553
00:27:09,523 --> 00:27:12,027
<i>And if you were cool,
you were in the club, they'd say,</i>

554
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:15,253
<i>“That guy's OK. ”
‘Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.</i>

555
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,745
<i>Really?</i>

556
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:16,904
<i>Yeah. Pretty cool, right?</i>

557
00:27:17,075 --> 00:27:17,628
<i>That's interesting.</i>

558
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:20,484
<i>You know, Tiffany's been doing this
dance thing for years and she's</i>

559
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:24,045
<i>real good at it. She's going to be competing
at the Ben Franklin Hotel.</i>

560
00:27:24,258 --> 00:27:26,522
<i>Oh, really? My wife loves dance.
Nikki loves dance.</i>

561
00:27:26,615 --> 00:27:28,156
<i>Why do you have to talk about me like that?</i>

562
00:27:28,187 --> 00:27:30,199
<i>I'm just bragging about you. Can't
I brag about my little sister?</i>

563
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:32,020
<i>Don't talk about me in the third person.</i>

564
00:27:32,378 --> 00:27:34,037
<i>Please, gimme a break.</i>

565
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:35,449
<i>I'm right here.</i>

566
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:37,513
<i>Just be nice. Just be nice.</i>

567
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,534
<i>Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.</i>

568
00:27:40,073 --> 00:27:41,428
<i>Sorry. I don't want to be mean.</i>

569
00:27:41,668 --> 00:27:43,558
<i>I know. I know, I know.</i>

570
00:27:43,832 --> 00:27:45,821
<i>What meds are you on?</i>

571
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:51,426
<i>Me? None.
I used to be on Lithium and Seroquel and Abilify,</i>

572
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:54,048
<i>but I don't take them anymore, no.
They make me foggy</i>

573
00:27:54,084 --> 00:27:56,254
<i>and they also make me bloated.</i>

574
00:27:56,362 --> 00:28:00,049
<i>Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor,
but I agree, I wasn't as sharp,</i>

575
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,203
<i>so I stopped.
You ever take Klonopin?</i>

576
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:03,129
<i>Klonopin?  Yeah.</i>

577
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:04,073
<i>Right?
Jesus.</i>

578
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,000
<i>It's like, “What? What day is it?”
How about Trazodone?</i>

579
00:28:09,183 --> 00:28:09,391
<i>Trazodone!</i>

580
00:28:10,143 --> 00:28:12,078
<i>Oh, it flattens you out.
I mean, you are done.</i>

581
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,147
<i>It takes the light right out of your eyes.</i>

582
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:14,203
<i>God, I bet it does.</i>

583
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:22,276
<i>I'm tired. I want to go.</i>

584
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,334
<i>No. No, no, no, no. We haven't, we
haven't even finished the salad</i>

585
00:28:26,363 --> 00:28:29,448
<i>yet, or the duck.
I made the Fire and Ice cake.</i>

586
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:33,232
<i>I said I'm tired.
Are you going to walk me home or what?</i>

587
00:28:35,732 --> 00:28:37,035
<i>You mean me?</i>

588
00:28:37,104 --> 00:28:39,256
<i>Yeah, you. Are you going to walk me home?</i>

589
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:43,025
<i>You have poor social skills.
You have a problem.</i>

590
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:46,073
<i>I have a problem?
You say more inappropriate things than</i>

591
00:28:46,086 --> 00:28:48,417
<i>appropriate things. You scare people.</i>

592
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:49,070
<i>I tell the truth. But you're mean.</i>

593
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:50,753
<i>What? I'm not telling the truth?</i>

594
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,163
<i>Um, maybe I should drive them home separately?</i>

595
00:28:55,631 --> 00:28:58,411
<i>You can drive them both home. Now.</i>

596
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:00,391
<i>Stop talking about me in third person.
You can take Tiffany home first.</i>

597
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:03,064
<i>You love it when I have problems.</i>

598
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:06,293
<i>You love it, Von, because then you
can be the good one. Just say it.</i>

599
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:09,205
<i>No... I don't. I don't.
I just wanted to have a nice,</i>

600
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,744
<i>I just wanted to have a nice dinner.
Oh, God.</i>

601
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:12,388
<i>What is your problem?!</i>

602
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:14,389
<i>Nothing's my problem! I'm fine.
I'm tired and I want to go.</i>

603
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:15,266
<i>Come on, are you ready?</i>

604
00:29:15,364 --> 00:29:17,256
<i>You really, you really want to go right now?</i>

605
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:19,024
<i>Yes, I really want to go!
It's been great.</i>

606
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,152
<i>Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping!</i>

607
00:29:20,252 --> 00:29:22,341
<i>Sorry. I don't want to wake up the baby.
Bye.</i>

608
00:29:42,093 --> 00:29:44,094
<i>Listen, I haven't dated since
before my marriage so I don't</i>

609
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:44,883
<i>really remember how this works.</i>

610
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:48,685
<i>How what works?</i>

611
00:29:48,685 --> 00:29:50,420
<i>I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat.</i>

612
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:55,214
<i>You felt it, I felt it, don't lie.
We're not liars like they are.</i>

613
00:29:56,817 --> 00:29:59,935
<i>I live in the addition around back,
which is completely</i>

614
00:29:59,935 --> 00:30:02,573
<i>separate from my parents' house, so
there's no chance of them walking</i>

615
00:30:02,573 --> 00:30:06,881
<i>in on us. I hate the fact that you
wore a football jersey to dinner</i>

616
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:09,947
<i>because I hate football, but you can fuck
me if you turn the lights off, okay?</i>

617
00:30:11,716 --> 00:30:12,344
<i>How old are you?</i>

618
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:18,403
<i>Old enough to have a marriage end and
not wind up in a mental hospital.</i>

619
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:24,533
<i>Look, I had a really good time tonight and
I think you're really</i>

620
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:25,943
<i>pretty, but I'm married, okay?</i>

621
00:30:27,323 --> 00:30:32,546
<i>You're married? So am I.</i>

622
00:30:34,314 --> 00:30:35,784
<i>No, that's confusing. He's dead.</i>

623
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:43,042
<i>Wait, what?</i>

624
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:44,811
<i>What's happening?</i>

625
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:51,764
<i>Oh, my God. Hey.</i>

626
00:31:15,675 --> 00:31:19,023
<i>Are you okay? Ronnie called. Hey,
is that make-up on your shirt?</i>

627
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,077
<i>I don't know, Mom.</i>

628
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,272
<i>What happened over there?</i>

629
00:31:21,735 --> 00:31:22,614
<i>When am I going to get a phone?</i>

630
00:31:23,162 --> 00:31:23,981
<i>You'll get a phone in due time.</i>

631
00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:24,800
<i>What happened?</i>

632
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,624
<i>Pat!</i>

633
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:50,168
<i>Mom!</i>

634
00:31:50,631 --> 00:31:53,181
<i>I can't find my wedding video.
Mom, wake up.</i>

635
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:54,263
<i>What is it?</i>

636
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:55,311
<i>Where's my wedding video?</i>

637
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:56,458
<i>It's after three o'clock!
What are you doing?</i>

638
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:58,573
<i>I looked in here, but this is all your
sewing shit up here, for your</i>

639
00:31:58,673 --> 00:32:00,208
<i>sewing and everything.
Did you put it up here?</i>

640
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:02,587
<i>What about in your father's study?</i>

641
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,501
<i>Don't go in my study.</i>

642
00:32:05,095 --> 00:32:05,933
<i>Dad, not now!</i>

643
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:07,877
<i>Would you put it in here? It makes
no sense for you to put it in here.</i>

644
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,212
<i>Patty, what are you doing?</i>

645
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,138
<i>He's got all his Eagles videos and
not one video of my wedding!</i>

646
00:32:11,727 --> 00:32:12,038
<i>Is it here? I mean... . ?</i>

647
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:12,489
<i>Patty!</i>

648
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,518
<i>It's probably in the attic.</i>

649
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:15,518
<i>Are you going in my study?</i>

650
00:32:16,443 --> 00:32:18,136
<i>It feels to me like you want to
hide my wedding video.</i>

651
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,333
<i>Please stop yelling!</i>

652
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,388
<i>I'm not yelling, Mom, I'm just frustrated</i>

653
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:26,952
<i>because I should have my fucking wedding video!</i>

654
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:28,651
<i>Pat! Pat!</i>

655
00:32:28,651 --> 00:32:30,977
<i>I looked over there!
I already looked all over there!</i>

656
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:35,024
<i>Calm down, Pat.</i>

657
00:32:36,115 --> 00:32:38,634
<i>I'm not calming down!
I don't give a fuck who hears,</i>

658
00:32:38,634 --> 00:32:40,449
<i>I'm not calming down!
Anybody can wake up!</i>

659
00:32:40,449 --> 00:32:42,881
<i>I'm not ashamed of it!
I'm not ashamed of it!</i>

660
00:32:42,881 --> 00:32:45,369
<i>Let the whole neighbourhood wake up!
I...... don't care!</i>

661
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:46,436
<i>Pat! Stop it!</i>

662
00:32:46,436 --> 00:32:47,300
<i>Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!</i>

663
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,190
<i>What's going on?</i>

664
00:32:49,188 --> 00:32:49,510
<i>What?</i>

665
00:32:50,082 --> 00:32:50,489
<i>I want it! It-...</i>

666
00:32:50,853 --> 00:32:51,200
<i>Hey!</i>

667
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:55,030
<i>It's my wedding!
It's my wedding video!</i>

668
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,009
<i>Pat! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!</i>

669
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:01,294
<i>I can't watch my wedding video,
but I CAN hear the fucking song</i>

670
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:17,991
<i>Mom?</i>

671
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:19,468
<i>What the fuck you doing?!
You...... hit your mother?!</i>

672
00:33:19,468 --> 00:33:20,653
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

673
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,659
<i>Stop it!</i>

674
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:24,842
<i>Get off me, Dad!</i>

675
00:33:24,842 --> 00:33:26,397
<i>Stop hitting him!</i>

676
00:33:26,397 --> 00:33:29,062
<i>Stop hitting him!</i>

677
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,490
<i>I'm not hitting him! He's hitting me!</i>

678
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:40,072
<i>I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</i>

679
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:46,416
<i>Police! Open up.</i>

680
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,556
<i>Mister Solatano, I got a lot of calls.</i>

681
00:33:47,556 --> 00:33:49,370
<i>People in the neighbourhood are scared.
I got to come in.</i>

682
00:33:50,124 --> 00:33:51,918
<i>How are we doing in here, huh?</i>

683
00:33:51,918 --> 00:33:55,937
<i>There are a lot of reports from your neighbours,
we got a lot of phone calls.</i>

684
00:33:55,937 --> 00:33:58,720
<i>Nikki is being manipulated and controlled.
You have to talk to her.</i>

685
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,522
<i>Hey, sit down.</i>

686
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:00,287
<i>Sit down.</i>

687
00:34:00,287 --> 00:34:02,229
<i>You got to stop with these crazy theories.</i>

688
00:34:02,229 --> 00:34:03,396
<i>He's a cop. What are you doing?</i>

689
00:34:03,396 --> 00:34:06,362
<i>It's a medication problem,
but he's fine now.</i>

690
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:07,796
<i>Oh yeah? He's fine now? You want to
send him back to Baltimore?</i>

691
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,137
<i>We know all about the explosion
at the psychiatrist's office.</i>

692
00:34:10,137 --> 00:34:10,671
<i>What?</i>

693
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:13,120
<i>What explosion? No. Cliff is lying,
that's not true.</i>

694
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,336
<i>He's not allowed to talk about that.</i>

695
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:16,645
<i>Jesus Christ, who's that?</i>

696
00:34:16,645 --> 00:34:17,448
<i>Keep an eye on him.</i>

697
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:19,781
<i>Is this a bipolar episode?</i>

698
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:21,876
<i>Get outta here, you little fucking'</i>

699
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:23,080
<i>idiot! Get outta here!</i>

700
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,600
<i>Someone, help me! Help me!</i>

701
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,644
<i>You can't tell Nikki about this,</i>

702
00:34:24,644 --> 00:34:25,213
<i>Officer.</i>

703
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:26,244
<i>Look, I got to make out a report.</i>

704
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:26,855
<i>No, no! No!</i>

705
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,444
<i>Hey! Sit down.</i>

706
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:27,199
<i>No, no, no, listen, sir.</i>

707
00:34:28,444 --> 00:34:30,799
<i>He's chasing me! This guy's chasing me!
Help me!</i>

708
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,840
<i>Sit down!</i>

709
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,292
<i>I'm sorry. I could just write you a
letter and you could just</i>

710
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:36,003
<i>let me have five minutes, explaining
how much better I'm doing.</i>

711
00:34:36,003 --> 00:34:37,944
<i>There's a court order against you --
five hundred feet. Listen to me!</i>

712
00:34:37,944 --> 00:34:41,015
<i>... and I'll take that fucking camera
and I'm going to break it over</i>

713
00:34:41,015 --> 00:34:43,605
<i>your fucking' head, then I'm going to come
back and interview you about</i>

714
00:34:43,605 --> 00:34:46,242
<i>what it's like to get that fucking'
camera broken over your head!</i>

715
00:34:46,242 --> 00:34:47,598
<i>Youwa--, what are you laughing about?</i>

716
00:34:47,598 --> 00:34:48,769
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

717
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:49,209
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

718
00:34:49,209 --> 00:34:49,725
<i>Okay.</i>

719
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:54,423
<i>Go back to sleep. The party's over.
Show's over.</i>

720
00:34:54,423 --> 00:34:56,978
<i>... this is not a reflection of where I'm at.
You can't... please,</i>

721
00:34:56,978 --> 00:34:59,561
<i>you can't tell her any of this
You can't tell Nikki about this.</i>

722
00:34:59,561 --> 00:35:00,224
<i>You need to pipe down.</i>

723
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,034
<i>Everything all right?</i>

724
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:02,179
<i>Who was at the door?</i>

725
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:03,126
<i>Who was that, Dad?</i>

726
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:04,429
<i>It was that kid with the camera.</i>

727
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:06,589
<i>Good luck. I got to write this up.</i>

728
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:08,894
<i>Come on, don't write it up!
I don't want her to see this!</i>

729
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:09,465
<i>It's okay, everything is okay.
We're fine, thank you,</i>

730
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,214
<i>we appreciate it. Thank you.</i>

731
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:10,993
<i>Hey!</i>

732
00:36:10,942 --> 00:36:12,017
<i>What the hell?</i>

733
00:36:14,074 --> 00:36:14,908
<i>What happened to your face?</i>

734
00:36:15,153 --> 00:36:15,817
<i>Weight lifting accident.</i>

735
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:20,055
<i>That sounds like bullshit.
Why'd you run by my house?</i>

736
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:22,954
<i>Did our little conversation
get you upset last night?</i>

737
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:24,793
<i>Hey, this is my route,
okay? Just back off.</i>

738
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:26,834
<i>This is my neighbourhood.
You just ran by my house.</i>

739
00:36:27,607 --> 00:36:28,888
<i>I like to run by myself, okay?</i>

740
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:29,910
<i>Me too.</i>

741
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,772
<i>Hey, I like to run alone! Will you stop?</i>

742
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:32,698
<i>What?</i>

743
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:34,542
<i>Okay? I'm running here!
Me too!</i>

744
00:36:34,637 --> 00:36:36,165
<i>Well then, why don't you run somewhere
else?</i>

745
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:37,853
<i>There's a fucking ton of roads to run in!
What are you trying to do?</i>

746
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,688
<i>I like this road. This is my neighbourhood.</i>

747
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:40,593
<i>Oh, come on, please!</i>

748
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,631
<i>Calm down, crazy.</i>

749
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:08,578
<i>Hey!</i>

750
00:37:08,636 --> 00:37:08,812
<i>What the fuck?!</i>

751
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:10,439
<i>I'm married!</i>

752
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:11,648
<i>So am I!</i>

753
00:37:12,074 --> 00:37:13,651
<i>What the fuck are you doing?
Your husband's dead!</i>

754
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:15,094
<i>Where is your wife?</i>

755
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:15,993
<i>You're crazy!</i>

756
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:19,439
<i>I'm not the one that just got
out of that hospital in Baltimore.</i>

757
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:20,562
<i>I'm not the big slut!</i>

758
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:26,917
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

759
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:30,802
<i>I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore.
There's always going to be a</i>

760
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:34,324
<i>part of me that's sloppy and dirty,
but I like that, with all the other</i>

761
00:37:34,697 --> 00:37:37,334
<i>parts of myself. Can you say
the same about yourself, fucker?!</i>

762
00:37:37,957 --> 00:37:40,324
<i>Can you forgive?
Are you any good at that?</i>

763
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:47,299
<i>You seemed to have trouble last night.</i>

764
00:37:48,357 --> 00:37:49,319
<i>Let me just set the record
straight about last night.</i>

765
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:52,060
<i>Hurting my mother was a
mistake and I hate myself for it,</i>

766
00:37:52,497 --> 00:37:54,299
<i>and I hate my illness and I want to control it.</i>

767
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:56,321
<i>My father, on the other hand, had no trouble</i>

768
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:59,231
<i>slapping the shit out of me
last night, which I did not return</i>

769
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:01,693
<i>‘cause I could've killed him and I
didn't. He's sixty-five years old.</i>

770
00:38:01,965 --> 00:38:03,319
<i>You don't think I could've beat
the shit out of him? I mean... .</i>

771
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:05,608
<i>He was scared for your
mother and you hurt him as well.</i>

772
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:09,763
<i>Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think
he probably just tried to do his best.</i>

773
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:13,424
<i>Pat, you have to have a strategy.
I told you earlier.</i>

774
00:38:14,363 --> 00:38:17,245
<i>You need to recognize these feelings coming
to you, otherwise you will be sent</i>

775
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:21,514
<i>back to Baltimore. So when you get
these feelings, you need to get to</i>

776
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,221
<i>a quieter place, and be at peace
with yourself, however you can.</i>

777
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:26,218
<i>Yeah, but that's easier said than done.</i>

778
00:38:26,629 --> 00:38:29,518
<i>You have to do it. You have no choice. Excelsior.</i>

779
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:34,071
<i>Yeah, Excelsior. Listen,
I have a letter I want you to give Nikki,</i>

780
00:38:34,763 --> 00:38:35,149
<i>okay?</i>

781
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:36,396
<i>No.</i>

782
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:37,376
<i>Why?</i>

783
00:38:37,928 --> 00:38:38,553
<i>Because you have a restraining</i>

784
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,238
<i>order.</i>

785
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:41,861
<i>What good are you, man?</i>

786
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:45,908
<i>Why did you have this
overwhelming urgency to see your</i>

787
00:38:46,154 --> 00:38:46,762
<i>wedding video last night?</i>

788
00:38:47,144 --> 00:38:48,858
<i>Oh, I don't know, because I'm married
and I haven't seen my wife</i>

789
00:38:49,104 --> 00:38:49,669
<i>in eight and a half months?</i>

790
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:52,609
<i>Maybe you think that Nikki's not around
and Tiffany's an attractive</i>

791
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:56,114
<i>girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany,
you will spoil your</i>

792
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:57,797
<i>chances of getting Nikki back to you?</i>

793
00:38:58,204 --> 00:39:00,953
<i>Not bad, Doctor Jones.
But I don't think I'm going to blow it</i>

794
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,300
<i>with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.</i>

795
00:39:03,944 --> 00:39:05,300
<i>Why is she a slut?</i>

796
00:39:05,327 --> 00:39:06,330
<i>After the dinner at Ronnie's,</i>

797
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:12,542
<i>she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can
fuck me as long as we turn the lights out. "</i>

798
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:16,422
<i>Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring.</i>

799
00:39:17,152 --> 00:39:18,791
<i>So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.</i>

800
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,350
<i>Maybe she just needs a friend and
she thought if she offers you sex,</i>

801
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:25,527
<i>it will be easier for you to
become friends with her.</i>

802
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:31,996
<i>She said she's not a whore anymore,
but she likes that part of herself</i>

803
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:34,903
<i>along with all the other parts of
herself and can I say the same?</i>

804
00:39:35,757 --> 00:39:36,239
<i>Can you?</i>

805
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:40,761
<i>Is that... . ? You're asking me, you're
really asking me that question?</i>

806
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:41,576
<i>Yes.</i>

807
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,445
<i>With all my crazy sad shit?
What, are you fucking nuts?</i>

808
00:39:46,315 --> 00:39:49,688
<i>Pat, the silver lining thing is yours.
I'm just giving back your</i>

809
00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:54,034
<i>words to you.
This "crazy sad shit, " as you call it, made you a</i>

810
00:39:54,273 --> 00:39:57,751
<i>happier, calmer person with a
beautiful positive philosophy of</i>

811
00:39:57,988 --> 00:40:00,561
<i>going outdoors, working out, and reading books.</i>

812
00:40:01,127 --> 00:40:04,746
<i>No, not the books.
You said Nikki's friends with</i>

813
00:40:04,962 --> 00:40:07,997
<i>Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if
you become friends with Tiffany,</i>

814
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,666
<i>Nikki will think that you're a kind,
generous, large-hearted</i>

815
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:16,590
<i>person, who helps people in need,
who is basically thriving. So if</i>

816
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:19,575
<i>you help Tiffany, it will be good for you.</i>

817
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:42,770
<i>Hey!</i>

818
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,429
<i>How do you know when I run?</i>

819
00:40:45,931 --> 00:40:47,323
<i>I wanted to clarify something.</i>

820
00:40:48,382 --> 00:40:49,381
<i>I just want us to be friends.</i>

821
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:52,790
<i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

822
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:56,896
<i>Why are you giving me such a hard time?</i>

823
00:40:59,563 --> 00:41:00,609
<i>No, I'm not giving you a hard time.</i>

824
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:05,091
<i>I don't know how to act
with you when you do this shit.</i>

825
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:09,081
<i>You want to have dinner at this diner?</i>

826
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:14,785
<i>Pick me up at seven thirty.</i>

827
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:53,791
<i>Happy Halloween.</i>

828
00:41:53,872 --> 00:41:54,200
<i>Hi.</i>

829
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,008
<i>Here you go.</i>

830
00:42:17,626 --> 00:42:17,902
<i>Thank you.</i>

831
00:42:21,112 --> 00:42:22,114
<i>I'm going to have a bowl of your Raisin Bran.</i>

832
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,125
<i>Great!</i>

833
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:29,777
<i>Tea
Be right back.</i>

834
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:36,758
<i>You look nice.</i>

835
00:42:37,726 --> 00:42:37,947
<i>Thanks.</i>

836
00:42:41,948 --> 00:42:44,353
<i>Raisin Bran. Milk.</i>

837
00:42:47,285 --> 00:42:47,535
<i>Thank you.</i>

838
00:43:03,856 --> 00:43:04,283
<i>You want to share this?</i>

839
00:43:05,735 --> 00:43:06,725
<i>Why did you order Raisin Bran?</i>

840
00:43:09,302 --> 00:43:09,961
<i>Why did you order tea?</i>

841
00:43:12,212 --> 00:43:13,368
<i>Because you ordered Raisin Bran.</i>

842
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,394
<i>I ordered Raisin Bran because
I didn't want there to be any</i>

843
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:17,599
<i>mistaking this for a date.</i>

844
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,289
<i>It can still be a date if you order Raisin Bran.</i>

845
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:26,827
<i>It's not a date. So how's your thing
going -- your dancing thing?</i>

846
00:43:27,574 --> 00:43:28,916
<i>It's good. How's your restraining order?</i>

847
00:43:29,653 --> 00:43:31,644
<i>I wouldn't actually call the
restraining order "my thing, ”</i>

848
00:43:32,137 --> 00:43:35,800
<i>but getting back with Nikki is,
and I've been doing pretty well.</i>

849
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:38,745
<i>Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.</i>

850
00:43:39,278 --> 00:43:40,473
<i>And the so-called incident with the weights.</i>

851
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,966
<i>Yeah. That was a thing with my parents.
I wish I could just</i>

852
00:43:45,202 --> 00:43:49,258
<i>explain it all in a letter to Nikki because
it was minor and I could</i>

853
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:51,905
<i>just explain it and let her know
that I'm actually not out of</i>

854
00:43:52,156 --> 00:43:55,835
<i>control and that I'm actually doing really well.</i>

855
00:44:04,885 --> 00:44:08,638
<i>I can get a letter to Nikki.
I see her sometimes with my sister.</i>

856
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:22,277
<i>It would be so amazing if you could
get a letter to Nikki from me.</i>

857
00:44:23,412 --> 00:44:26,690
<i>I'd have to hide it from Veronica.
She's not into breaking the law,</i>

858
00:44:26,985 --> 00:44:29,186
<i>which this letter would definitely be doing.</i>

859
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:31,778
<i>But you would do it?</i>

860
00:44:35,267 --> 00:44:39,022
<i>I'd have to be careful.
I'm already on thin ice with my family,</i>

861
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:40,548
<i>you should hear how I lost my job.</i>

862
00:44:41,538 --> 00:44:42,274
<i>How did you lose your job?</i>

863
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:50,046
<i>By... having sex with everybody in the office.</i>

864
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:52,445
<i>Everybody?</i>

865
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:56,034
<i>I was very depressed after Tommy died.
It was a lot of people.</i>

866
00:44:57,005 --> 00:44:57,814
<i>We don't have to talk about it.</i>

867
00:44:58,327 --> 00:44:58,834
<i>Thanks.</i>

868
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,048
<i>How many were there?</i>

869
00:45:00,288 --> 00:45:00,794
<i>Eleven.</i>

870
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:01,467
<i>Wow.</i>

871
00:45:01,964 --> 00:45:02,347
<i>I know.</i>

872
00:45:04,156 --> 00:45:05,161
<i>I'm not going to talk about it anymore.</i>

873
00:45:05,528 --> 00:45:05,804
<i>Okay.</i>

874
00:45:07,844 --> 00:45:09,170
<i>Can I ask you one more question?</i>

875
00:45:11,914 --> 00:45:12,487
<i>Were there any women?</i>

876
00:45:13,105 --> 00:45:14,650
<i>Yes.</i>

877
00:45:15,081 --> 00:45:15,539
<i>Really?</i>

878
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:16,615
<i>Yes.</i>

879
00:45:18,366 --> 00:45:18,999
<i>What was that like?</i>

880
00:45:20,145 --> 00:45:20,643
<i>Hot.</i>

881
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:28,255
<i>Jesus Christ. Was it like... older women,</i>

882
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:31,446
<i>a sexy teacher who wants to seduce you-</i>

883
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,669
<i>Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah.</i>

884
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:37,636
<i>What? You sat on her lap?</i>

885
00:45:37,914 --> 00:45:38,616
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

886
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:39,925
<i>She told you what to do?</i>

887
00:45:40,402 --> 00:45:40,777
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

888
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:45,802
<i>Oh... my God.
Nikki hated when I talked like this.</i>

889
00:45:46,604 --> 00:45:48,589
<i>Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe
we should change the subject.</i>

890
00:45:48,891 --> 00:45:49,295
<i>I don't mind it.</i>

891
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:51,856
<i>You don't, do you.</i>

892
00:45:53,546 --> 00:45:58,427
<i>No. But then people were getting
into fights in the parking lot at</i>

893
00:45:58,698 --> 00:46:04,527
<i>work, and in the bathroom... and the
boss called me in to his office and</i>

894
00:46:04,768 --> 00:46:10,075
<i>tried to pin it all on me. So I accused
him of harassment and then</i>

895
00:46:10,315 --> 00:46:14,673
<i>they fired me,
sent me home and put me on some meds.</i>

896
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:20,948
<i>I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...</i>

897
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:23,801
<i>was in the shower with the history teacher...</i>

898
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:24,853
<i>I heard about that.</i>

899
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:27,930
<i>... it was my wedding song and when
I hear it, I go kind of crazy.</i>

900
00:46:28,384 --> 00:46:29,686
<i>Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.</i>

901
00:46:30,423 --> 00:46:31,930
<i>Wow.</i>

902
00:46:32,843 --> 00:46:36,661
<i>Yeah. So they put me on medication,
which I feel ashamed of.</i>

903
00:46:37,048 --> 00:46:37,339
<i>Yeah.</i>

904
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:39,290
<i>So I know.</i>

905
00:46:40,084 --> 00:46:40,791
<i>You do.</i>

906
00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:43,540
<i>I just got to get a strategy, you know?</i>

907
00:46:45,225 --> 00:46:45,476
<i>Me too.</i>

908
00:46:47,298 --> 00:46:48,243
<i>We'd better get back to the letter.</i>

909
00:46:48,726 --> 00:46:49,655
<i>Yeah, let's get back to the letter.</i>

910
00:46:51,088 --> 00:46:53,155
<i>What if you told Nikki when
Veronica was in the bathroom?</i>

911
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:59,394
<i>Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that.</i>

912
00:46:59,811 --> 00:47:01,836
<i>Oh, my God, I'm going to go home
and write the letter right now.</i>

913
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:03,902
<i>Can I at least finish my tea?</i>

914
00:47:04,469 --> 00:47:04,987
<i>Wait, what?</i>

915
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:06,372
<i>My tea. Can I finish it?</i>

916
00:47:07,111 --> 00:47:10,132
<i>Wait a minute.
Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner?</i>

917
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:13,309
<i>Why would she do that? Was it a test?</i>

918
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:15,579
<i>I kind of got that feeling, yeah.</i>

919
00:47:16,027 --> 00:47:20,948
<i>Goddamn it. I knew it.
It was a test. How did I do?</i>

920
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:21,773
<i>I think I did pretty well.</i>

921
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,476
<i>Yeah, she said you were cool, basically.</i>

922
00:47:24,752 --> 00:47:27,715
<i>“Basically”? Was I some percentage not cool?</i>

923
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30,522
<i>No, she said you were cool, but you know.</i>

924
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:33,855
<i>No, I don't know.</i>

925
00:47:35,172 --> 00:47:37,997
<i>Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax.</i>

926
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:40,278
<i>What do you mean? How am I? What does that mean?</i>

927
00:47:41,232 --> 00:47:41,810
<i>Sort of like me.</i>

928
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:47,777
<i>"Sort of like you"?
I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that.</i>

929
00:47:49,423 --> 00:47:49,783
<i>Why?</i>

930
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:55,252
<i>Because, it's just not right,
lumping you and I together,</i>

931
00:47:55,387 --> 00:47:59,558
<i>I mean, it's just wrong.
And Nikki wouldn't like that.</i>

932
00:48:01,273 --> 00:48:02,206
<i>Especially after all the shit you just told me.</i>

933
00:48:05,095 --> 00:48:07,880
<i>You think that I'm crazier than you.</i>

934
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:12,648
<i>Because, well, we're different, I mean-</i>

935
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:19,497
<i>Oh, my God. Ugh. You're killing me.</i>

936
00:48:22,063 --> 00:48:27,482
<i>You know what? Forget I offered to help you.</i>

937
00:48:28,552 --> 00:48:31,863
<i>Forget the entire fucking idea.
‘Cause that must have been</i>

938
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:36,550
<i>fucking crazy because
I am so much crazier than you.</i>

939
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:37,602
<i>Keep your voice down.</i>

940
00:48:37,863 --> 00:48:40,765
<i>I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband!</i>

941
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:43,004
<i>Forget it!</i>

942
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:43,918
<i>Shut the fuck up.</i>

943
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:44,823
<i>Fuck you!</i>

944
00:48:46,415 --> 00:48:47,707
<i>You shut the fuck up!</i>

945
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:48,721
<i>Tiffany! Hey! Tiffany!</i>

946
00:48:59,316 --> 00:49:00,089
<i>Slow down, Raisin Bran.</i>

947
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:05,491
<i>Hey, come on. Look,
I don't think you're crazy, all right?</i>

948
00:49:05,727 --> 00:49:06,334
<i>Yes, you do.</i>

949
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:06,993
<i>No, I don't.</i>

950
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:10,092
<i>You told your therapist that you
were in a superior mental illness</i>

951
00:49:10,426 --> 00:49:11,192
<i>category, didn't you?</i>

952
00:49:11,426 --> 00:49:12,545
<i>What? Hey, calm down! Hey-</i>

953
00:49:12,747 --> 00:49:13,366
<i>Just leave me alone!</i>

954
00:49:13,812 --> 00:49:15,219
<i>Can I just explain myself, please?</i>

955
00:49:16,968 --> 00:49:19,219
<i>I didn't want Nikki to think that I
was associated with that kind of</i>

956
00:49:19,587 --> 00:49:21,246
<i>sexual behaviour because I've never
done anything like that, okay?</i>

957
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:24,180
<i>You may not have
experienced the shit that I did.</i>

958
00:49:24,882 --> 00:49:26,431
<i>But you loved hearing about it, didn't you?</i>

959
00:49:27,983 --> 00:49:32,415
<i>You are afraid to be alive, you're
afraid to live. You're a hypocrite.</i>

960
00:49:32,917 --> 00:49:37,435
<i>You're a conformist. You're a liar. I opened
up to you and you judged me.</i>

961
00:49:37,671 --> 00:49:40,052
<i>You are an asshole.
You are an asshole!</i>

962
00:49:40,642 --> 00:49:42,226
<i>Get off of me!  Get off!</i>

963
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:43,324
<i>You're harassing me!</i>

964
00:49:43,702 --> 00:49:44,851
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

965
00:49:45,054 --> 00:49:45,542
<i>He's harassing me!</i>

966
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:48,704
<i>Get off!</i>

967
00:49:48,854 --> 00:49:50,091
<i>Take it easy. Dude, relax.</i>

968
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:51,002
<i>He's harassing me!!</i>

969
00:49:51,181 --> 00:49:53,016
<i>Bro, get off of me.</i>

970
00:49:53,062 --> 00:49:54,099
<i>He's harassing me!!</i>

971
00:49:54,144 --> 00:49:56,200
<i>Hey, hey, stop, stop. Stop, all right?</i>

972
00:49:56,388 --> 00:50:01,403
<i>Hey, get off of me! Shut up, shut up.</i>

973
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:02,425
<i>Stop it.</i>

974
00:50:13,238 --> 00:50:15,244
<i>Hey, hey, hey, get off me!</i>

975
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,147
<i>What are you doing?
Come on. What are you doing?</i>

976
00:50:17,273 --> 00:50:18,112
<i>What are you doing to these kids?</i>

977
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:19,958
<i>Are you being a punk on
Halloween with these kids?</i>

978
00:50:20,259 --> 00:50:22,119
<i>You want to go back to Baltimore?
Is that what you want to do?</i>

979
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:22,984
<i>I didn't, I didn't, I didn't-</i>

980
00:50:29,805 --> 00:50:31,448
<i>It's the kids!</i>

981
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:33,966
<i>Honestly He didn't do anything,
it was all the kids.</i>

982
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:38,039
<i>Let's go, clear out, nothing going on here.</i>

983
00:50:38,059 --> 00:50:43,610
<i>Come on man what you going to do about that song?
You going to go your whole life scared of that song?</i>

984
00:50:43,681 --> 00:50:45,174
<i>It's just a song.
Don't make it a monster.</i>

985
00:50:45,237 --> 00:50:50,359
<i>Come on breath!
There's no song playing. There's no song.</i>

986
00:50:59,397 --> 00:51:00,721
<i>That's it.</i>

987
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:09,241
<i>That's it. There you go.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

988
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:10,397
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

989
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:12,310
<i>I took it too far.</i>

990
00:51:13,189 --> 00:51:13,930
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

991
00:51:14,734 --> 00:51:15,161
<i>Hey, is he messing with you?</i>

992
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:17,517
<i>No, no. No, this was just a joke.
This is a joke I started.</i>

993
00:51:17,854 --> 00:51:19,698
<i>There's a restraining order on this guy.</i>

994
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:20,990
<i>I know, I have a stupid sense of humour.</i>

995
00:51:21,216 --> 00:51:21,891
<i>That's not a good thing to do.</i>

996
00:51:22,097 --> 00:51:24,070
<i>Well, I'm fucked up.
What can I tell you? I'm sorry.</i>

997
00:51:24,638 --> 00:51:25,412
<i>You're Tommy's widow, right?</i>

998
00:51:25,779 --> 00:51:29,437
<i>Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus
the whore thing for the most part.</i>

999
00:51:30,057 --> 00:51:33,565
<i>You're a funny girl.
You want to get a drink sometime?</i>

1000
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,457
<i>What'd I say? She doesn't,
she doesn't do that anymore.</i>

1001
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:54,057
<i>I'm sorry about what I said in the diner.</i>

1002
00:51:54,463 --> 00:51:56,572
<i>I know. I know you didn't mean it.</i>

1003
00:51:57,087 --> 00:51:57,952
<i>I didn't mean it at all.</i>

1004
00:51:58,312 --> 00:51:59,850
<i>I know, you say shit you don't mean all the time.</i>

1005
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,442
<i>All the time. I'll still give your
letter to Nikki, don't worry.</i>

1006
00:52:03,878 --> 00:52:06,167
<i>Wow. I really appreciate that, Tiffany.</i>

1007
00:52:07,512 --> 00:52:08,237
<i>I know you do.</i>

1008
00:52:08,427 --> 00:52:17,762
<i>You do? Yeah, sure.
I'll see you tomorrow? With the letter?</i>

1009
00:52:21,713 --> 00:52:23,317
<i>I'll bet I know what
happened if only one is missing.</i>

1010
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:27,697
<i>Either Dolores or Pat needed an
envelope and one of ‘em took it.</i>

1011
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,642
<i>That's the only answer. No, no, no.</i>

1012
00:52:31,271 --> 00:52:34,575
<i>Dolores, somebody was in my study.
Who took one of my envelopes?</i>

1013
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,662
<i>Somebody took an envelope.</i>

1014
00:52:37,395 --> 00:52:39,010
<i>Maybe we should call the FBI.</i>

1015
00:52:39,428 --> 00:52:40,362
<i>Don't make fun. This is serious.</i>

1016
00:52:41,181 --> 00:52:44,086
<i>What FBI? Come on, let's take a
look. I'll show you what this is.</i>

1017
00:52:44,337 --> 00:52:46,467
<i>I'm going to just explain to you something.
I mean, you know what</i>

1018
00:52:46,637 --> 00:52:49,095
<i>I'm doing, honey. This everything, like this.</i>

1019
00:52:49,362 --> 00:52:50,543
<i>I got this, it all corresponds.</i>

1020
00:52:50,978 --> 00:52:51,717
<i>Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes.</i>

1021
00:52:51,887 --> 00:52:52,492
<i>I hope that's not a problem</i>

1022
00:52:52,652 --> 00:52:55,104
<i>No, it's not okay. It's not okay.
You got to ask.</i>

1023
00:52:55,312 --> 00:52:57,171
<i>“Do not go in my study or I will eat you!”</i>

1024
00:52:57,417 --> 00:52:58,060
<i>It's not funny, it's not funny.</i>

1025
00:52:58,312 --> 00:52:59,788
<i>What's everybody making a joke out of this for?</i>

1026
00:53:00,033 --> 00:53:02,415
<i>Dolores, you are so beautiful!</i>

1027
00:53:02,587 --> 00:53:05,014
<i>Stop that! Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop!</i>

1028
00:53:06,507 --> 00:53:09,552
<i>Listen, a lot of envelopes go in
and out of my office every day</i>

1029
00:53:09,894 --> 00:53:11,401
<i>after games with a lot of cash in</i>

1030
00:53:11,652 --> 00:53:13,087
<i>‘em. So show some respect for what I do.</i>

1031
00:53:13,517 --> 00:53:14,612
<i>Yeah, I know. I saw two-seven-four.</i>

1032
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:15,567
<i>I just wanted to tell you the number.</i>

1033
00:53:15,702 --> 00:53:16,282
<i>Thank you.</i>

1034
00:53:16,297 --> 00:53:18,271
<i>But the envelope was empty.
I'm sorry, you were sleeping.</i>

1035
00:53:18,181 --> 00:53:19,442
<i>I didn't want to wake you,
but I needed an envelope.</i>

1036
00:53:19,624 --> 00:53:21,771
<i>You didn't want to wake me?
He didn't want to wake me.</i>

1037
00:53:22,064 --> 00:53:25,389
<i>He doesn't have a problem complaining
about Ernest fucking Hemingway.</i>

1038
00:53:25,694 --> 00:53:27,402
<i>He doesn't have a problem asking
for his wedding video-</i>

1039
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:29,399
<i>Be nice. It's game day! I'm making
crabby snacks and homemade.</i>

1040
00:53:29,628 --> 00:53:32,527
<i>Yeah, come on, Dad, be nice. Come
on, she's making crabby snacks and</i>

1041
00:53:32,732 --> 00:53:33,347
<i>homemade. Come on, Dad!</i>

1042
00:53:35,926 --> 00:53:37,187
<i>What are you so up about?</i>

1043
00:53:38,137 --> 00:53:39,640
<i>He's very happy. I'm happy.</i>

1044
00:53:39,813 --> 00:53:40,832
<i>No, you're so up, up, up, up.</i>

1045
00:53:40,972 --> 00:53:41,797
<i>Isn't that a good thing?</i>

1046
00:53:41,944 --> 00:53:44,537
<i>You're just up, up, up.
I don't know what that is.</i>

1047
00:53:44,707 --> 00:53:46,862
<i>Are you taking the proper
dosage of your medication?</i>

1048
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:48,828
<i>Am I taking the right dose?
Of course I am.</i>

1049
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,607
<i>Okay. Taking a little bit
too many or something?</i>

1050
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,067
<i>No, if I was taking that,
I'd be on the floor, Dad.</i>

1051
00:53:55,267 --> 00:53:57,972
<i>Just stay with us. Stay for the game.
Spend some family time.</i>

1052
00:53:58,223 --> 00:53:59,157
<i>Dad, I can't. Look, I'm ready to go.</i>

1053
00:53:59,317 --> 00:54:03,016
<i>Spend family time. Wait, you mean OCD,
superstitious time?</i>

1054
00:54:03,467 --> 00:54:05,326
<i>Come on, your dad needs a winner.
Help him out.</i>

1055
00:54:05,781 --> 00:54:07,647
<i>Come on. I can't. It's the Seahawks.</i>

1056
00:54:07,797 --> 00:54:13,039
<i>Put on the jersey and stay, please.
Please. It's important, please.</i>

1057
00:54:13,844 --> 00:54:15,623
<i>What are you up to, Pat? Nothing, come on.</i>

1058
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:16,668
<i>What's in the envelope?</i>

1059
00:54:16,913 --> 00:54:19,037
<i>Yeah, what are you doing? What's in that envelope?</i>

1060
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:21,934
<i>Guys, I'm beating the song!
I'm on the scoreboard!</i>

1061
00:54:22,157 --> 00:54:24,402
<i>I'm playing down field! I feel great!</i>

1062
00:54:40,092 --> 00:54:41,667
<i>Hey, how you doing'? Is Tiffany here?</i>

1063
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:43,054
<i>What do you want with her?</i>

1064
00:54:43,222 --> 00:54:45,916
<i>Is that another creep?
What do you want, creep? Just beat it.</i>

1065
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,566
<i>Whoa, no, no, no. No, I'm married.</i>

1066
00:54:47,824 --> 00:54:49,543
<i>Oh, great, a married creep. I'm her friend.</i>

1067
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:52,277
<i>We go running. Have you guys not
seen us? I took her to the diner.</i>

1068
00:54:52,447 --> 00:54:53,079
<i>She's not here.</i>

1069
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:56,308
<i>Hi, guys. How's it going? Hey.
Is Tiffany home? Go away.</i>

1070
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:00,335
<i>I know her. I know her,
we've dated. We still date.</i>

1071
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:01,839
<i>What are you doing here?
I've called her, I've texted her.</i>

1072
00:55:01,919 --> 00:55:04,000
<i>I still haven't heard back.
We used to work together-</i>

1073
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,354
<i>Just get the hell out of here...</i>

1074
00:55:05,439 --> 00:55:06,375
<i>I just wanted to give you
my card to give to her.</i>

1075
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,901
<i>Another rude creep.
Listen to what he's saying.</i>

1076
00:55:07,939 --> 00:55:09,019
<i>Listen to what he's saying.
What's he saying?</i>

1077
00:55:09,164 --> 00:55:09,902
<i>He's saying you're being rude.</i>

1078
00:55:09,927 --> 00:55:10,369
<i>How am I being rude?</i>

1079
00:55:10,864 --> 00:55:11,733
<i>Oh, you know. You know. Come on.</i>

1080
00:55:11,899 --> 00:55:14,879
<i>Sometimes it's okay with girls like this,
they want to have fun and sometimes -</i>

1081
00:55:15,096 --> 00:55:17,294
<i>-it's not because they got a
broken wing, and they're hurt,</i>

1082
00:55:17,444 --> 00:55:20,409
<i>and they're an easy target. And in
this case, in this particular case,</i>

1083
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:21,959
<i>I think that wing is being fixed.</i>

1084
00:55:22,115 --> 00:55:24,991
<i>And you got to make sure it gets mended.
And you're getting' in the</i>

1085
00:55:25,131 --> 00:55:27,104
<i>way of that right now, okay?
Because she's sensitive and she's</i>

1086
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,588
<i>smart, she's artistic.
This is a great girl and you got to be</i>

1087
00:55:29,714 --> 00:55:31,212
<i>respectful of that. Come on.</i>

1088
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:33,659
<i>Let me walk you down to your car.
You're a better guy than this.</i>

1089
00:55:33,799 --> 00:55:35,426
<i>I can see it in your eyes. She just texted me!</i>

1090
00:55:45,591 --> 00:55:49,691
<i>Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are
you doing? What happened?</i>

1091
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:52,620
<i>How come you weren't outside?
What the hell's going on?</i>

1092
00:55:52,761 --> 00:55:53,281
<i>I can't, I can't do it.</i>

1093
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,334
<i>What do you mean, you can't do it?
You can't do what?</i>

1094
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:55,702
<i>I can't give the letter to Nikki.</i>

1095
00:55:56,491 --> 00:55:59,874
<i>Tiffany, what are you talking about?
What do you mean you can't</i>

1096
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:02,379
<i>give the letter to Nikki?
Because what am I getting in return?</i>

1097
00:56:02,504 --> 00:56:05,429
<i>What are you doing for me? You
said! You said if I wrote a letter,</i>

1098
00:56:05,576 --> 00:56:07,195
<i>you'd get it to Nikki. I know.
That was the set-up.</i>

1099
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,923
<i>Because I do this time after time
after time, I do all this shit for</i>

1100
00:56:10,048 --> 00:56:13,984
<i>other people and then I wake up and,
and I'm empty, I have nothing!</i>

1101
00:56:14,684 --> 00:56:16,531
<i>What are you talking about? You
seem like you're a tough girl to</i>

1102
00:56:16,644 --> 00:56:18,115
<i>me. Why don't you just do things on your own?</i>

1103
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:21,330
<i>I always get myself in these fucking situations.
I give</i>

1104
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:25,367
<i>everything to other people and nobody
ever, I never -- I don't get</i>

1105
00:56:25,522 --> 00:56:27,862
<i>what I want, okay? I'm not my sister.</i>

1106
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:35,676
<i>Alright, well, ask for you. What can I do for you?</i>

1107
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:41,950
<i>I can't do it. Tiffany,
what do you want me to do?</i>

1108
00:56:43,994 --> 00:56:46,175
<i>Think of something. There's this thing.</i>

1109
00:56:46,797 --> 00:56:47,948
<i>There's a thing, okay. What kind of thing?</i>

1110
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:52,210
<i>It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a,
it's a dance thing.</i>

1111
00:56:53,017 --> 00:56:54,120
<i>It's a dance thing, all right.</i>

1112
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,370
<i>It's a competition thing at
the Benjamin Franklin Hotel.</i>

1113
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,385
<i>Tommy would never do it with me
and I missed it every single year.</i>

1114
00:56:58,542 --> 00:56:59,556
<i>Well, Tommy's dead,
so he's not going to fucking do it.</i>

1115
00:56:59,686 --> 00:57:02,385
<i>Would you please!
I don't have a filter when I talk.</i>

1116
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,135
<i>Can we have one conversation
without you reminding me that my</i>

1117
00:57:04,293 --> 00:57:05,073
<i>goddamn husband is dead?</i>

1118
00:57:05,245 --> 00:57:06,225
<i>Yes, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.</i>

1119
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,842
<i>But I can only do it if I have a partner...
and now I'm about to miss</i>

1120
00:57:11,953 --> 00:57:12,239
<i>it for another year.</i>

1121
00:57:12,968 --> 00:57:14,320
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I'm not going to fucking' dance with you.</i>

1122
00:57:14,468 --> 00:57:15,230
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1123
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:19,045
<i>What, your schedule is so busy?
“Grapes of Wrath” and watching</i>

1124
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,100
<i>football with your dad?</i>

1125
00:57:20,247 --> 00:57:21,625
<i>Tiffany, I'm not going to do a dance with you.</i>

1126
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:22,855
<i>All right, then I'm not giving
her your fucking letter.</i>

1127
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,030
<i>Wait a second!
But you promised you would do this.</i>

1128
00:57:25,329 --> 00:57:26,370
<i>Think about it.</i>

1129
00:57:28,252 --> 00:57:30,126
<i>Well, I already did do something for you, you know.</i>

1130
00:57:32,267 --> 00:57:34,075
<i>I took care of that jerk off
that was in front of your house.</i>

1131
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,110
<i>What? Jordie?</i>

1132
00:57:35,437 --> 00:57:37,195
<i>Let me ask you something. Do you
call him when you're lonely?</i>

1133
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,455
<i>That encourages him, Tiffany.
You shouldn't do it.</i>

1134
00:57:41,775 --> 00:57:43,057
<i>Couldn't you say the same about you and Nikki?</i>

1135
00:57:43,617 --> 00:57:44,655
<i>It's not at all like me and Nikki.</i>

1136
00:57:44,865 --> 00:57:46,345
<i>What are you talking about?
We're in love and we're married.</i>

1137
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:47,400
<i>It's completely different.</i>

1138
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:52,125
<i>How are you in love? Tell me about that.
The big Nikki love.</i>

1139
00:57:53,021 --> 00:57:54,427
<i>Tell me about it, I want to understand it.</i>

1140
00:57:56,046 --> 00:57:58,093
<i>We have a very unconventional chemistry,
it makes people feel</i>

1141
00:57:58,128 --> 00:58:01,318
<i>awkward, but not me. She's the most
beautiful woman I've ever been with.</i>

1142
00:58:02,034 --> 00:58:04,673
<i>Wow. It's electric between us,</i>

1143
00:58:04,852 --> 00:58:07,549
<i>Okay? Yeah, we want to change each other,
but that's normal, couples want to do that,</i>

1144
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:10,652
<i>I want her to stop dressing like she dresses,
I want her to</i>

1145
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:13,386
<i>stop acting so superior to me, okay?
And she wanted me to lose</i>

1146
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:17,250
<i>weight and stop my mood swings,
both of which I've done.</i>

1147
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:20,123
<i>I mean, people fight. Couples fight.
We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a</i>

1148
00:58:20,273 --> 00:58:23,070
<i>couple weeks. That's normal.
She always wanted the best for me.</i>

1149
00:58:23,253 --> 00:58:26,392
<i>She wanted me to be passionate and
compassionate. And that's a good</i>

1150
00:58:26,528 --> 00:58:29,191
<i>thing. You know? I just, look,
I'm my best self today, and I think</i>

1151
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,938
<i>she's her best self today, and our
love's going to be fucking amazing.</i>

1152
00:58:32,138 --> 00:58:34,885
<i>It's going to be amazing, and you're
going to be amazing, and she's going to</i>

1153
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,195
<i>be amazing, and you're not going to
be that guy that's going to take</i>

1154
00:58:37,344 --> 00:58:39,179
<i>advantage of a situation without
offering to do something back.</i>

1155
00:58:39,758 --> 00:58:42,725
<i>So think about the dance thing.</i>

1156
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:51,833
<i>Danny, you're out of the hospital?
And you're here on game day?</i>

1157
00:58:52,058 --> 00:58:56,028
<i>I'm out. It's official, man.
They didn't convert me to my</i>

1158
00:58:56,198 --> 00:59:00,413
<i>Mental Hygiene Law admission status within
two thirds of the maximum length</i>

1159
00:59:00,558 --> 00:59:03,771
<i>of my felony sentence, so I'm out.
They had to let me go.</i>

1160
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:06,153
<i>I never understand what he's saying.</i>

1161
00:59:06,398 --> 00:59:08,444
<i>Okay, jailhouse lawyer, come on,
let's come back and sit down the</i>

1162
00:59:08,584 --> 00:59:09,350
<i>way you were before.</i>

1163
00:59:10,404 --> 00:59:13,594
<i>What a treat! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dad's got you sitting here?</i>

1164
00:59:14,187 --> 00:59:15,591
<i>Oh, yeah. He calls me “Jailhouse Lawyer. ”</i>

1165
00:59:16,498 --> 00:59:17,893
<i>Hold the remote the way you were holding it before.</i>

1166
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,423
<i>Okay. And now you're holding the remote?</i>

1167
00:59:19,866 --> 00:59:21,302
<i>And it's working. Your dad's a genius.</i>

1168
00:59:22,274 --> 00:59:25,141
<i>Now sit up. And Danny's the good luck charm?</i>

1169
00:59:25,516 --> 00:59:27,883
<i>Danny's from you. This is your house,
so it comes down to you.</i>

1170
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:29,998
<i>You're the one. Yeah, you're the one, Pat.</i>

1171
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,843
<i>Superstition, Danny. I don't know.</i>

1172
00:59:32,008 --> 00:59:32,632
<i>Come sit down.</i>

1173
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,468
<i>Don't disappear doing God knows
what with that Tiffany Maxwell.</i>

1174
00:59:35,643 --> 00:59:38,398
<i>Dad, Dad, Dad. She's my friend.
Why would you say that?</i>

1175
00:59:39,283 --> 00:59:41,516
<i>Oh, she's a mess. You got to be careful.
She goes to a lot of therapy.</i>

1176
00:59:41,938 --> 00:59:44,376
<i>I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie.
What are you trying to say?</i>

1177
00:59:44,745 --> 00:59:45,778
<i>I'm just saying- Am I messed up?</i>

1178
00:59:46,355 --> 00:59:48,943
<i>Why don't you stop judging people? You
judge everybody. You're the one</i>

1179
00:59:49,093 --> 00:59:49,959
<i>who has a messed up marriage.</i>

1180
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:51,552
<i>I'm just looking out for you, I'm just
looking out for you. She's unstable.</i>

1181
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:52,837
<i>What's wrong with your marriage?
What's wrong with your marriage?</i>

1182
00:59:52,983 --> 00:59:53,464
<i>Nothing's wrong!</i>

1183
00:59:53,634 --> 00:59:56,319
<i>You should have seen when I was at his
house. It's like a circus over there.</i>

1184
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,474
<i>Shh, shh. What are you talking about?
I'm not going to hide this.</i>

1185
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:00,320
<i>You need to deal with it.
Stop breaking my balls.</i>

1186
01:00:00,492 --> 01:00:03,963
<i>Oh!!!! I got you an iPod.
Whoa! Is this for me?</i>

1187
01:00:04,107 --> 01:00:05,817
<i>Yeah. Well, that's my old iPod, but-</i>

1188
01:00:05,932 --> 01:00:08,494
<i>Oh, buddy, thank you.
That's so nice of you. Wow.</i>

1189
01:00:08,959 --> 01:00:11,443
<i>Thirty-two gigabytes. How many
songs is that? Seven thousand.</i>

1190
01:00:12,549 --> 01:00:14,756
<i>Oh, yeah, you got The Stranglers.
You love The Stranglers.</i>

1191
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,361
<i>Oh, the Sex Pistols. The Clash.
Got some Clash.</i>

1192
01:00:18,853 --> 01:00:22,099
<i>Oh, “West Side Story. ” Yeah, “West
Side Story. ” It makes me peaceful.</i>

1193
01:00:22,254 --> 01:00:24,413
<i>“Maria, I just met a girl named Maria... ”
Right, right, right.</i>

1194
01:00:24,562 --> 01:00:27,194
<i>And then when I'm angry,
which is a lot these days, I go to the</i>

1195
01:00:27,343 --> 01:00:38,464
<i>garage... Metallica... Megadeth.
I start fucking smashing shit.</i>

1196
01:00:38,619 --> 01:00:39,564
<i>You got to get your marriage together.</i>

1197
01:00:39,714 --> 01:00:43,101
<i>I start breaking shit,
and I hurt my hand. And -</i>

1198
01:00:43,234 --> 01:00:46,503
<i>Ronnie, that's fucked up.
Yeah, but it makes me feel better.</i>

1199
01:00:47,306 --> 01:00:48,359
<i>It's like my therapy, you know?</i>

1200
01:00:48,859 --> 01:00:51,569
<i>When I'm with Nikki,
I'm never going to do stuff like that...</i>

1201
01:00:52,004 --> 01:00:53,289
<i>Whoa, Nikki? What's all this about Nikki?</i>

1202
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,748
<i>Pan from the framed photo of Jake on foyer
wall, to Jake on the stairs above.</i>

1203
01:00:57,948 --> 01:01:01,059
<i>A restraining order is nothing to fool
with, bro. Holy shit, look at you! You</i>

1204
01:01:02,817 --> 01:01:04,356
<i>are fit! You look absolutely amazing.
You feel good?</i>

1205
01:01:04,806 --> 01:01:07,459
<i>How you doing, Jake? Good. You look
like Schwarzenegger in his prime.</i>

1206
01:01:07,604 --> 01:01:10,174
<i>Didn't I say you wouldn't recognize him?</i>

1207
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:14,829
<i>So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come
see you down at the hospital.</i>

1208
01:01:15,674 --> 01:01:18,823
<i>You know how those places creep me
out, and the firm's been expanding.</i>

1209
01:01:19,023 --> 01:01:20,943
<i>I've been helping Pop with the restaurant
‘cause he needs to have</i>

1210
01:01:21,092 --> 01:01:23,989
<i>a legitimate business. He needs a tax
return. With all the money that</i>

1211
01:01:23,999 --> 01:01:26,014
<i>he's making with his bookmaking, they're
going to come after him. And</i>

1212
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,720
<i>then it looks like I'm making, I'm
going to make partner at the firm.</i>

1213
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:34,037
<i>Well, I don't even know what to say
to you anymore. You lost your wife,</i>

1214
01:01:35,238 --> 01:01:38,834
<i>I'm getting engaged, and I want to be
able to tell you about those kind</i>

1215
01:01:39,003 --> 01:01:44,839
<i>of things. You lost your house, I'm
getting a new house. You lost your</i>

1216
01:01:44,979 --> 01:01:47,189
<i>job, things are going great for me at the firm.</i>

1217
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:50,075
<i>Maybe stop talking about all the
stuff that's good for you and bad</i>

1218
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:53,382
<i>for him. Just, you know, leave it alone.
We're watching the game.</i>

1219
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:56,116
<i>You know what, I'm just going to, I'm
just going to, I'm just going to stop</i>

1220
01:01:56,256 --> 01:01:57,704
<i>talking. I'm going to shut my mouth.</i>

1221
01:02:02,494 --> 01:02:12,064
<i>As my friend Danny would say I got
nothing but love for you, brother.</i>

1222
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:19,377
<i>That's right. That's right.
That's nice. That's nice.</i>

1223
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:25,949
<i>Well, thank God, finally.
DeSean Jackson. Yeah. Did it fit?</i>

1224
01:02:26,574 --> 01:02:27,938
<i>I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner.</i>

1225
01:02:28,436 --> 01:02:29,764
<i>Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey.</i>

1226
01:02:30,477 --> 01:02:32,565
<i>Veronica didn't like it.
Veronica hates the jersey.</i>

1227
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,924
<i>Whatever you do, watch out for
that restraining order, okay?</i>

1228
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:39,321
<i>Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble.</i>

1229
01:02:39,476 --> 01:02:41,643
<i>Pat, you're up to something, I know.</i>

1230
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:45,069
<i>People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me,
maybe we know something that</i>

1231
01:02:45,214 --> 01:02:47,282
<i>you guys don't know, okay? Did you
ever think about that? Maybe we</i>

1232
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,641
<i>understand something because we're more-</i>

1233
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,508
<i>We have a sixth sense. I mean,
everybody's got it. Everybody's</i>

1234
01:02:50,637 --> 01:02:51,429
<i>just not in touch with it.</i>

1235
01:02:52,219 --> 01:02:54,033
<i>Oh, no. How you doing, Pat? Jesus.</i>

1236
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,879
<i>I guess his sixth sense forgot
to tell him the cops were coming.</i>

1237
01:02:57,904 --> 01:02:59,349
<i>I'm taking him back to the hospital.</i>

1238
01:02:59,716 --> 01:03:00,857
<i>What? No, no, he passed his thing, right?</i>

1239
01:03:01,371 --> 01:03:03,466
<i>First of all, check with the latest legal development.</i>

1240
01:03:04,721 --> 01:03:07,744
<i>Well, we got a call that they did convert
you to a Mental Hygiene Law</i>

1241
01:03:08,089 --> 01:03:09,949
<i>admission status by the deadline
of your sentence, so... .</i>

1242
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:12,839
<i>Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles
fan or are you not an Eagles fan?</i>

1243
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:14,299
<i>I'm an Eagles fan.</i>

1244
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:17,769
<i>Well then, what's the problem? He's
not going' anywhere. Just let him</i>

1245
01:03:17,904 --> 01:03:19,812
<i>finish the game, that's all.
The handkerchief is working. We're</i>

1246
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:21,708
<i>killing the Seahawks, twenty-seventeen.</i>

1247
01:03:22,317 --> 01:03:24,855
<i>What's the matter with you? Let him stay, please!</i>

1248
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,207
<i>I don't know what the hell you're
talking about “the handkerchief”.</i>

1249
01:03:28,057 --> 01:03:30,795
<i>And I'm glad that the Seahawks are
losing and we're winning, but I</i>

1250
01:03:30,925 --> 01:03:34,868
<i>got to take Danny McDaniel’s back to
Baltimore, alright? He can contest</i>

1251
01:03:35,012 --> 01:03:36,037
<i>his case from Baltimore.</i>

1252
01:03:37,197 --> 01:03:39,770
<i>Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law.
You're not correct.</i>

1253
01:03:40,573 --> 01:03:42,564
<i>Come on. You guys oughta be ashamed of yourselves.</i>

1254
01:04:01,703 --> 01:04:04,382
<i>I used the insurance money to build
this. I designed it. All the floors</i>

1255
01:04:04,648 --> 01:04:07,897
<i>are hard oak.
It has good bounce for dancers. Wow.</i>

1256
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:10,802
<i>I'm not that great of a dancer, but
who cares? It's therapy and it's</i>

1257
01:04:10,952 --> 01:04:14,484
<i>fun. And the walls are good
‘cause I can play music really loud</i>

1258
01:04:14,678 --> 01:04:16,902
<i>without anybody hearing. Where do you sleep?</i>

1259
01:04:17,473 --> 01:04:21,626
<i>Upstairs. It's a garage,
I just renovated it. You know, I was</i>

1260
01:04:21,876 --> 01:04:23,307
<i>thinking about putting a ballet barre here.</i>

1261
01:04:23,477 --> 01:04:24,172
<i>When are you going to give it to her?</i>

1262
01:04:24,347 --> 01:04:36,067
<i>What?</i>

1263
01:04:28,067 --> 01:04:29,267
<i>The letter to Nikki.</i>

1264
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:34,067
<i>Probably tonight. Really?</i>

1265
01:04:33,738 --> 01:04:35,432
<i>Ronnie and Veronica and
I are going to see her tonight.</i>

1266
01:04:36,287 --> 01:04:38,337
<i>Oh, I actually changed the first paragraph.
I did this thing about</i>

1267
01:04:38,462 --> 01:04:39,871
<i>Shakespeare and how it's very romantic-</i>

1268
01:04:40,017 --> 01:04:41,044
<i>Mm-hmm. -and that maybe in the future if</i>

1269
01:04:41,179 --> 01:04:44,108
<i>she wanted to go dancing, I can be
able to do that because of all the</i>

1270
01:04:44,246 --> 01:04:45,547
<i>training that-No, that's good,
that's really good.</i>

1271
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:46,617
<i>I assume you're a good teacher.</i>

1272
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:47,929
<i>Yeah. I mean, I hope so.</i>

1273
01:04:48,037 --> 01:04:48,957
<i>Maybe you can teach us both,
you know what I mean?</i>

1274
01:04:49,087 --> 01:04:52,322
<i>And I also mentioned how generous
it is, what I'm doing for you.</i>

1275
01:04:52,467 --> 01:04:54,170
<i>Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's really generous.</i>

1276
01:04:54,555 --> 01:04:55,322
<i>You know, being of service.</i>

1277
01:04:55,922 --> 01:04:56,682
<i>Yeah. To your need. Uh-huh.</i>

1278
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:00,532
<i>All right, let's start simple. Start
at that corner, walk towards me.</i>

1279
01:05:01,377 --> 01:05:02,008
<i>Walk across the room.</i>

1280
01:05:03,517 --> 01:05:05,190
<i>Can we do something else besides the dance deal?</i>

1281
01:05:05,407 --> 01:05:06,029
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

1282
01:05:06,171 --> 01:05:08,158
<i>I'm good with a hammer. You want me
to fix something? A deal is a deal.</i>

1283
01:05:08,365 --> 01:05:12,189
<i>I know. Okay. I was just suggesting that
maybe there's a better scenario.</i>

1284
01:05:12,424 --> 01:05:19,043
<i>Why don't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki.</i>

1285
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:24,988
<i>And the only way to convey how much
you've missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk.</i>

1286
01:05:25,074 --> 01:05:28,049
<i>You can't talk. Only walk.</i>

1287
01:05:28,605 --> 01:05:31,605
<i>I'm not doing it.
Do it. No. That's stupid.</i>

1288
01:05:31,779 --> 01:05:36,213
<i>No walk, no letter. Walk to me like I'm Nikki,
come on. Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.</i>

1289
01:05:36,373 --> 01:05:38,894
<i>You're not Nikki.</i>

1290
01:05:41,094 --> 01:05:44,094
<i>Don't look up until you're halfway here.</i>

1291
01:05:57,099 --> 01:05:59,481
<i>Yes. Do you feel that? That's emotion.</i>

1292
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:00,939
<i>I don't feel anything.</i>

1293
01:06:04,539 --> 01:06:07,539
<i>Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?</i>

1294
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:14,276
<i>We were married for three years and</i>

1295
01:06:14,461 --> 01:06:18,021
<i>five days, and I loved him. But for
the last couple months, I just</i>

1296
01:06:18,186 --> 01:06:23,368
<i>wasn't into sex at all. It just
felt like we were so different and</i>

1297
01:06:23,493 --> 01:06:26,941
<i>I was depressed. Some of that is just
me, some of it was he wanted</i>

1298
01:06:27,076 --> 01:06:29,918
<i>me to have kids and I have a hard
enough time taking care of myself.</i>

1299
01:06:30,411 --> 01:06:37,491
<i>I don't think that makes me a criminal.
Anyway one night after</i>

1300
01:06:37,622 --> 01:06:44,071
<i>dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret
at King of Prussia Mall and</i>

1301
01:06:44,297 --> 01:06:47,994
<i>got some lingerie to get something
going. And on the way back, he</i>

1302
01:06:48,154 --> 01:06:50,992
<i>stopped on 76 to help a guy with
a flat tire and he got hit by a car</i>

1303
01:06:51,201 --> 01:06:56,021
<i>and killed. And the Victoria's Secret
box was still in the front</i>

1304
01:06:56,151 --> 01:07:02,674
<i>seat. That's a feeling.</i>

1305
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:53,264
<i>Whoa! Slow down. What?</i>

1306
01:09:53,331 --> 01:09:57,633
<i>Your father wanted you to have this.</i>

1307
01:09:57,835 --> 01:09:58,834
<i>He wants me to have-
all this Eagles information.</i>

1308
01:09:59,614 --> 01:10:03,185
<i>It's his living. Um, tell Dad thanks.</i>

1309
01:10:03,608 --> 01:10:06,031
<i>Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat.</i>

1310
01:10:13,264 --> 01:10:16,126
<i>Football stays out of this place,
so does “Lord of the Flies. ”</i>

1311
01:10:16,904 --> 01:10:19,381
<i>Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are you
doing? I'm behind on my syllabus.</i>

1312
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:22,688
<i>I don't give a fuck.
What the hell are you doing? Hey, hey!</i>

1313
01:10:23,179 --> 01:10:24,990
<i>Did you just throw that outside?</i>

1314
01:10:25,819 --> 01:10:28,614
<i>What? You're not going to read that
shit on my time. I can tell you all</i>

1315
01:10:28,749 --> 01:10:32,108
<i>about the “Lord of the Flies. ” It's
a bunch of boys on an island and</i>

1316
01:10:32,259 --> 01:10:35,190
<i>they have a conch -- they have a shell
-- and whoever has the conch</i>

1317
01:10:35,329 --> 01:10:37,732
<i>has the power and they can talk.
And if you don't have the conch,</i>

1318
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:40,387
<i>then you don't have the power. And
then there's a little chubby boy,</i>

1319
01:10:40,811 --> 01:10:43,303
<i>and they call him Piggy and they're
really mean, and then there's a</i>

1320
01:10:43,433 --> 01:10:47,436
<i>murder. I mean, humanity is just
nasty and there's no silver lining.</i>

1321
01:10:48,206 --> 01:10:51,478
<i>Wow. That was a great synopsis.
I still need to read it, though.</i>

1322
01:10:51,645 --> 01:10:56,820
<i>Who's that? What the... . ?
What are you doing here, man?</i>

1323
01:10:57,681 --> 01:11:00,551
<i>If one of your two supervising
physicians loses their license,</i>

1324
01:11:01,161 --> 01:11:03,244
<i>then your whole adjudication is thrown out.</i>

1325
01:11:03,519 --> 01:11:04,102
<i>How'd you know we were here?</i>

1326
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:05,969
<i>I went by your parents'
house looking for you and they told me</i>

1327
01:11:06,105 --> 01:11:06,708
<i>you was over here.</i>

1328
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:08,020
<i>Danny, this is Tiffany. Tiffany, this is Danny.</i>

1329
01:11:08,178 --> 01:11:11,268
<i>Hello. Pat told me about you. So
is the girl, that you wrote about?</i>

1330
01:11:11,721 --> 01:11:14,255
<i>Yeah. What? He wrote about me?
I'm “the girl”?</i>

1331
01:11:14,511 --> 01:11:16,502
<i>He wrote about you, all right.
What'd he say?</i>

1332
01:11:17,062 --> 01:11:19,702
<i>He said you guys was helping each other
out and you were nice and had</i>

1333
01:11:20,112 --> 01:11:24,652
<i>a mouth on you, that you were mouthy, but-</i>

1334
01:11:24,819 --> 01:11:25,472
<i>Whoa, whoa, that's enough.</i>

1335
01:11:25,612 --> 01:11:27,152
<i>No, please, tell me more about
what he said in the letter.</i>

1336
01:11:27,297 --> 01:11:28,754
<i>Yeah, anything you want to know,
I'll just tell you. It was nothing.</i>

1337
01:11:28,926 --> 01:11:30,063
<i>It was just a very general letter.</i>

1338
01:11:30,193 --> 01:11:34,068
<i>Cool. She's fine.
She is my friend with an “F. ”</i>

1339
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:36,820
<i>A capital “F. ”
For “friend. ”</i>

1340
01:11:36,969 --> 01:11:40,257
<i>Hey, can I see what you guys are doing?</i>

1341
01:11:40,569 --> 01:11:43,772
<i>Yeah. Okay. That's it?</i>

1342
01:11:50,002 --> 01:11:51,616
<i>Why? What is it, what is it, what is it.</i>

1343
01:11:51,862 --> 01:11:53,193
<i>Can I say something? Do you mind? No.</i>

1344
01:11:53,692 --> 01:11:54,676
<i>You sure? Just say it. Say it.</i>

1345
01:11:54,851 --> 01:11:57,628
<i>No, please. I think Pat,
you should be facing Tiffany.</i>

1346
01:11:59,052 --> 01:12:01,197
<i>Let me show you, Pat, let me show you
what I mean. You got to come at</i>

1347
01:12:01,352 --> 01:12:02,734
<i>her with a little bit more soul, man.</i>

1348
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:03,807
<i>You should move more hips.</i>

1349
01:12:03,957 --> 01:12:06,106
<i>Just, just sort of come in,
Pat, come in like this. And... .</i>

1350
01:12:06,245 --> 01:12:10,887
<i>Okay. Yeah. Can you move ‘em
a little bit more? Yeah, that's it.</i>

1351
01:12:11,013 --> 01:12:12,161
<i>Move ‘em a bit more.</i>

1352
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:16,027
<i>You could turn around, too,
there's nothing wrong with that.</i>

1353
01:12:16,487 --> 01:12:18,456
<i>Yeah. You're pretty good. Mm, yeah.</i>

1354
01:12:21,267 --> 01:12:23,815
<i>Okay, we got it, we got it. Okay. Okay.</i>

1355
01:12:26,847 --> 01:12:32,957
<i>Come on, Pat, come on.
A little bit more soul. Black it up, Pat.</i>

1356
01:12:32,062 --> 01:12:35,117
<i>“Black it up”? You know damn well what it means.</i>

1357
01:12:36,822 --> 01:12:42,719
<i>I got an idea. Come get some, Pat. Come get some.</i>

1358
01:12:57,027 --> 01:13:00,342
<i>Shuffle back, shuffle back.
Shuffle back, shuffle back.</i>

1359
01:13:00,472 --> 01:13:01,711
<i>Girl, you got to move your junk.</i>

1360
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:05,854
<i>I got to get out of here.
I got to go see this girl, Tanya.</i>

1361
01:13:06,044 --> 01:13:06,912
<i>She lives on this side of town.</i>

1362
01:13:07,087 --> 01:13:08,557
<i>Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.</i>

1363
01:13:08,752 --> 01:13:10,308
<i>Okay, man, hey. I'm going to be there,
man. I want you guys to win!</i>

1364
01:13:10,633 --> 01:13:12,103
<i>Bye! Excelsior, Pat!</i>

1365
01:13:12,448 --> 01:13:14,489
<i>Excelsior! That's my man.
Let’s go!</i>

1366
01:13:17,332 --> 01:13:20,952
<i>Pat. Patty.</i>

1367
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:45,300
<i>Where have you been?</i>

1368
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:45,800
<i>Huh?</i>

1369
01:13:47,147 --> 01:13:48,518
<i>We got a serious situation on our hands,
you know that.</i>

1370
01:13:51,314 --> 01:13:55,622
<i>We got to beat the Giants if we want to
have a chance of getting into</i>

1371
01:13:55,797 --> 01:14:00,432
<i>the division, any chance of playing in
the playoffs. Do you realize that?</i>

1372
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:04,762
<i>I didn't realize that.
Yeah, that's the bind we're in.</i>

1373
01:14:06,547 --> 01:14:10,892
<i>I mean, I think it would be wise if
we spent father-son time, reading</i>

1374
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:15,132
<i>about the Eagles, talking about them,
just to strengthen the good</i>

1375
01:14:15,291 --> 01:14:16,171
<i>luck thing that you're in.</i>

1376
01:14:18,027 --> 01:14:20,676
<i>Okay. Yeah? Right. Hmm?</i>

1377
01:14:36,044 --> 01:14:43,892
<i>I just wanted to, maybe I didn't, spend
enough time with you growing</i>

1378
01:14:44,072 --> 01:14:49,732
<i>up. I spent too much time with your
brother. It might have made you</i>

1379
01:14:49,889 --> 01:14:53,191
<i>feel worse about your behaviour, but
I didn't know anything, I didn't</i>

1380
01:14:53,376 --> 01:14:55,282
<i>know how to handle it.</i>

1381
01:14:57,182 --> 01:14:58,500
<i>I mean, that's what all this Eagles stuff</i>

1382
01:14:58,642 --> 01:15:08,763
<i>is about. It's about us, spending time
now. I want to do everything I</i>

1383
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:13,140
<i>can to help you get back on your feet.
That's the whole point. Yeah.</i>

1384
01:15:17,982 --> 01:15:21,519
<i>I wish you'd watch these games with
me so we could talk, we could get into things.</i>

1385
01:15:23,054 --> 01:15:32,441
<i>So would you, would you just come downstairs</i>

1386
01:15:32,601 --> 01:15:34,339
<i>and talk to me and Randy now?</i>

1387
01:15:36,139 --> 01:15:38,200
<i>Randy, tell him what I'm doing.</i>

1388
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:40,072
<i>He's betting everything on the Giant game.
Everything.</i>

1389
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:43,704
<i>All the money that he needs for the restaurant,
he's betting on the Giant game.</i>

1390
01:15:46,169 --> 01:15:50,899
<i>Tell him why. Because he believes in you.
Is that true?</i>

1391
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:56,209
<i>I believe in you, Patty. I believe
in you. I want you to know that.</i>

1392
01:15:57,064 --> 01:15:58,753
<i>So I'm going to bet heavy on this game.</i>

1393
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:01,169
<i>You understand? Yeah.</i>

1394
01:16:01,414 --> 01:16:04,439
<i>Heavy. I want you to go to the game with your brother.</i>

1395
01:16:05,104 --> 01:16:06,779
<i>You want me to go to the game with Jake?</i>

1396
01:16:07,434 --> 01:16:08,735
<i>Of course I do. Does he want me to go?</i>

1397
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:10,231
<i>Of course he wants you to go.</i>

1398
01:16:10,473 --> 01:16:12,443
<i>He told you that? He told me, yes.</i>

1399
01:16:13,379 --> 01:16:16,179
<i>Even with all his friends? With all his friends.
He trusts you.</i>

1400
01:16:16,377 --> 01:16:17,164
<i>He's not embarrassed?</i>

1401
01:16:17,329 --> 01:16:20,109
<i>No. I'd love to go to the game, too,
but as you know, I'm banned</i>

1402
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:23,655
<i>from the stadium. ‘Cause I'd love to
see us beat the Giants and take</i>

1403
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:25,099
<i>a lot of money from this asshole.</i>

1404
01:16:26,797 --> 01:16:31,066
<i>Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet.
As a matter of fact,</i>

1405
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:34,737
<i>I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough
for the restaurant on a game.</i>

1406
01:16:35,565 --> 01:16:39,046
<i>Randy.  I just hope you heard what I said.
It's like a</i>

1407
01:16:39,217 --> 01:16:44,329
<i>family business, it's our family endeavour.
We all stick together on this.</i>

1408
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:48,344
<i>That's how it works. That's a positive, positive vibe.</i>

1409
01:16:51,427 --> 01:16:54,157
<i>I made a commitment to Tiffany about
a project, and we have a very</i>

1410
01:16:54,351 --> 01:16:57,699
<i>important part of it that we have to
go over on Sunday, and</i>

1411
01:17:02,373 --> 01:17:05,629
<i>it's good for me, Dad.
It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's,</i>

1412
01:17:05,849 --> 01:17:08,973
<i>it's--, I never would've thought this,
but it's a good thing.</i>

1413
01:17:09,849 --> 01:17:10,613
<i>What is this thing you're doing?</i>

1414
01:17:11,899 --> 01:17:14,315
<i>Yeah, what is it? What is this project, hon.?</i>

1415
01:17:15,028 --> 01:17:19,789
<i>It's a dance thing, okay? There's
nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.</i>

1416
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:34,059
<i>Listen, I need to ask you something.</i>

1417
01:17:34,224 --> 01:17:36,365
<i>Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you
and half the day at the Eagles game?</i>

1418
01:17:36,828 --> 01:17:38,884
<i>I'm going to pretend that you didn't just ask me that.</i>

1419
01:17:39,393 --> 01:17:44,334
<i>Why? These are the two days that you
have promised me and that we have</i>

1420
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:46,481
<i>prepared to nail the big move.
It's not ready yet.</i>

1421
01:17:46,671 --> 01:17:48,322
<i>And we don't have a move yet.</i>

1422
01:17:48,485 --> 01:17:50,879
<i>I know, but my dad opened up to me
and it was really beautiful and I</i>

1423
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:53,929
<i>want to be of service to him, okay? And
he's worried that the juju from</i>

1424
01:17:54,084 --> 01:17:56,354
<i>the Eagles is being fucked up and
he's concerned that it's because</i>

1425
01:17:56,499 --> 01:17:57,308
<i>I'm spending time with you.</i>

1426
01:17:57,482 --> 01:17:59,386
<i>Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?</i>

1427
01:17:59,861 --> 01:18:02,487
<i>No, you're not messing up the juju,
but the juju is messed up because</i>

1428
01:18:02,646 --> 01:18:03,691
<i>I'm not with him during the games.</i>

1429
01:18:05,355 --> 01:18:06,923
<i>Guess what? What?</i>

1430
01:18:07,123 --> 01:18:16,103
<i>Nikki replied to your letter.
But you can't read it until after</i>

1431
01:18:16,278 --> 01:18:17,984
<i>you nail the big move. Go.</i>

1432
01:18:38,128 --> 01:18:39,749
<i>Tiff, I'm sorry.
I can't do anything else without reading</i>

1433
01:18:39,898 --> 01:18:41,758
<i>Nikki's letter, okay? It's just--,
it's in the back of my head.</i>

1434
01:18:42,138 --> 01:18:43,181
<i>We don't almost have it, all right?</i>

1435
01:18:45,368 --> 01:18:47,408
<i>I just hope you can handle it. Thank you.</i>

1436
01:18:49,334 --> 01:18:50,558
<i>What was her energy when she gave it to you?</i>

1437
01:18:52,263 --> 01:18:55,286
<i>She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.</i>

1438
01:18:56,678 --> 01:18:59,253
<i>She was scared? About what? Did she tell you?</i>

1439
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:04,791
<i>Try to stay positive.</i>

1440
01:19:08,946 --> 01:19:12,547
<i>I'm just going to read it out loud, okay?
Because if she says anything</i>

1441
01:19:12,827 --> 01:19:14,922
<i>that's, you know, is that too much to ask?</i>

1442
01:19:15,258 --> 01:19:16,078
<i>No.</i>

1443
01:19:23,078 --> 01:19:25,400
<i>I thought you were going to read it out loud.</i>

1444
01:19:25,534 --> 01:19:26,663
<i>Okay. Sorry.</i>

1445
01:19:28,192 --> 01:19:29,911
<i>"Dear Pat,</i>

1446
01:19:31,311 --> 01:19:34,300
<i>It was very emotional
for me to get your letter, as I'm</i>

1447
01:19:34,476 --> 01:19:37,438
<i>sure you can imagine, but I'm glad
you took the risk of discreetly</i>

1448
01:19:37,585 --> 01:19:39,040
<i>getting it to me through Tiffany.</i>

1449
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:44,432
<i>This gives us a chance to communicate while
I keep the restraining order until I feel safe.</i>

1450
01:19:47,802 --> 01:19:50,603
<i>I must admit you sound terrific
and I'm happy that you are</i>

1451
01:19:50,763 --> 01:19:54,108
<i>feeling so positive and becoming a more
loving and caring man, which I</i>

1452
01:19:54,268 --> 01:19:56,518
<i>always knew you were.</i>

1453
01:20:12,018 --> 01:20:14,000
<i>I was moved to read about ‘Excelsior' and your</i>

1454
01:20:14,098 --> 01:20:16,888
<i>belief in happy endings. I am also
moved by your act of love to read</i>

1455
01:20:17,073 --> 01:20:19,328
<i>the books I have taught at the high
school. I'm sorry you find them so</i>

1456
01:20:19,488 --> 01:20:21,423
<i>negative, but I disagree. I think
they are great works of art that</i>

1457
01:20:21,586 --> 01:20:24,218
<i>reflect how hard life can be and
they can also help kids prepare</i>

1458
01:20:24,378 --> 01:20:27,659
<i>themselves for the hardness of life.
In spite of all these</i>

1459
01:20:27,819 --> 01:20:30,459
<i>positive developments, Pat,
I have to say if it's me reading the</i>

1460
01:20:30,599 --> 01:20:34,517
<i>signs, I need to see something to prove
you are ready to resume our</i>

1461
01:20:34,652 --> 01:20:40,307
<i>marriage. Otherwise I find myself
thinking that we might both be</i>

1462
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:42,298
<i>better off moving on with our lives
separately.</i>

1463
01:20:49,898 --> 01:20:50,700
<i>Please don't react quickly</i>

1464
01:20:50,743 --> 01:20:54,898
<i>to this, but take time to think about it.</i>

1465
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:57,043
<i>I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki. ”</i>

1466
01:21:09,536 --> 01:21:10,600
<i>I think I'm done for today, okay?</i>

1467
01:21:16,013 --> 01:21:18,268
<i>She said to show her something,</i>

1468
01:21:18,684 --> 01:21:21,934
<i>Pat. This dance can be that something.
You would have never</i>

1469
01:21:22,403 --> 01:21:25,783
<i>done something like this in a million years.
It shows all kinds</i>

1470
01:21:25,959 --> 01:21:28,881
<i>of skills on so many different levels:
focus, collaboration,</i>

1471
01:21:29,123 --> 01:21:36,948
<i>discipline. It's romantic,
like I said it would be. It's for her.</i>

1472
01:21:39,773 --> 01:21:42,528
<i>Thanks for the letter.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?</i>

1473
01:21:56,038 --> 01:21:58,088
<i>Can I use your phone?
Is it an emergency?</i>

1474
01:21:58,453 --> 01:22:00,553
<i>Yeah, kind of.
What kind of emergency?</i>

1475
01:22:02,424 --> 01:22:04,975
<i>Well, I'm just doing this project
with Tiffany and I wanted to tell</i>

1476
01:22:05,134 --> 01:22:06,049
<i>her I'm not going to be on time.</i>

1477
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:09,356
<i>Just don't make her an emergency,
that crazy girl, you know?</i>

1478
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:13,618
<i>She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow
Jake's phone. It's too bad you</i>

1479
01:22:13,788 --> 01:22:16,463
<i>can't come in to the stadium, but I know
you were kicked out, you know,</i>

1480
01:22:16,658 --> 01:22:20,228
<i>for beating everybody up. Guess we're
not that different, huh, Dad?</i>

1481
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:23,517
<i>That a bad thing?</i>

1482
01:22:24,253 --> 01:22:26,123
<i>No, I think, it's a good thing.</i>

1483
01:22:27,583 --> 01:22:29,848
<i>Don't drink too much.
Don't hit anybody. You'll be fine.</i>

1484
01:22:30,228 --> 01:22:31,380
<i>Yeah. I'm solid.</i>

1485
01:22:39,241 --> 01:22:40,153
<i>This is my little brother Pat.</i>

1486
01:22:40,658 --> 01:22:41,259
<i>Hey, how you doing?</i>

1487
01:22:41,409 --> 01:22:43,618
<i>So, Pat, what's this
I hear about you just getting' out?</i>

1488
01:22:43,763 --> 01:22:46,233
<i>Yeah, from the Looney bin!</i>

1489
01:22:46,794 --> 01:22:49,633
<i>What the fuck?!
I talked to you about that already!</i>

1490
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:52,493
<i>I told you guys- It's all right.</i>

1491
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:54,496
<i>Huh? No. It's alright.</i>

1492
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:56,083
<i>He's a good dude! He's a good dude.</i>

1493
01:22:57,708 --> 01:23:01,338
<i>Oh, shit! The Asian invasion!</i>

1494
01:23:02,382 --> 01:23:04,533
<i>They're here every week! No!</i>

1495
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:17,231
<i>Uh, Jake you better get your brother.</i>

1496
01:23:17,355 --> 01:23:20,543
<i>Cuckoo bird's taking' off. Doctor Patel!</i>

1497
01:23:22,294 --> 01:23:25,956
<i>Pat! Hey! What are you doing here?</i>

1498
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:27,843
<i>You know, we must beat the Giants,
my brother.</i>

1499
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:28,963
<i>I'm not supposed to be seeing you,</i>

1500
01:23:29,775 --> 01:23:30,438
<i>right? Outside the office?</i>

1501
01:23:30,823 --> 01:23:32,168
<i>Pat, Pat. That's illegal!</i>

1502
01:23:32,393 --> 01:23:35,804
<i>Pat, today I'm your brother
in green, not your therapist. I'm so</i>

1503
01:23:35,949 --> 01:23:38,365
<i>happy to see you.
How wonderful that you are here!</i>

1504
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,218
<i>Hey, Jake this is Cliff.
This is my doctor, Cliff.</i>

1505
01:23:40,843 --> 01:23:43,044
<i>Look, two things.
We got to watch that bubble screen for fucking'</i>

1506
01:23:43,183 --> 01:23:45,810
<i>Manning in the backfield
and we got to make sure we knock the</i>

1507
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:47,538
<i>receivers on their ass on the line of scrimmage.</i>

1508
01:23:47,873 --> 01:23:49,828
<i>You can say that again. Those cocksuckers!</i>

1509
01:24:20,006 --> 01:24:22,328
<i>Okay, you know what? I don't have
her phone number. If you want, if</i>

1510
01:24:22,514 --> 01:24:25,451
<i>you really want, you can call
Veronica ‘cause she does, but I</i>

1511
01:24:25,601 --> 01:24:26,738
<i>don't want to talk to Veronica.</i>

1512
01:24:26,888 --> 01:24:27,718
<i>Why don't you want to talk to Veronica?</i>

1513
01:24:27,848 --> 01:24:30,173
<i>Because she brings me down, man!
She just brings me down.</i>

1514
01:24:30,488 --> 01:24:31,609
<i>You have to change. You're not going to
throw the marriage away.</i>

1515
01:24:31,758 --> 01:24:33,628
<i>There's some kind of love there.
I know, I used to see it.</i>

1516
01:24:33,763 --> 01:24:36,623
<i>You guys have a beautiful thing that
got broken somewhere along the</i>

1517
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:37,978
<i>line and you got to fix it like a chiropractor.</i>

1518
01:24:38,143 --> 01:24:39,883
<i>You got to give it a chiropractic adjustment.</i>

1519
01:24:40,668 --> 01:24:43,918
<i>Enough with awkwardness! I don't want to
walk in your house and not be</i>

1520
01:24:44,033 --> 01:24:45,098
<i>able to say what I want to say.</i>

1521
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,989
<i>You're right, man. You're right, you're right,</i>

1522
01:24:48,071 --> 01:24:54,249
<i>Eagles, baby! Yeah! Let's go! What
the fuck? What's that smell?</i>

1523
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,508
<i>Nasty Indian curry! This is America,
baby! Go back to your country!</i>

1524
01:25:00,432 --> 01:25:02,239
<i>What, what's wrong? Hey!</i>

1525
01:25:02,673 --> 01:25:06,933
<i>Whoa, whoa, what's going on?
Stay back, Pat. Stay back.</i>

1526
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:11,418
<i>Leave the fucking Indians alone.
Stay here, stay here!</i>

1527
01:25:12,223 --> 01:25:14,133
<i>I'm not going to go anywhere.
Don't get in a fight!</i>

1528
01:25:16,348 --> 01:25:18,195
<i>I'm not going to fight. I'm not going to fight.</i>

1529
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:24,075
<i>Hey, not my brother! Hey, hey, hey!</i>

1530
01:25:27,178 --> 01:25:30,038
<i>Break it up or you'll be arrested!</i>

1531
01:25:49,843 --> 01:25:54,779
<i>What'd you do?
What happened? Dad-</i>

1532
01:25:55,194 --> 01:25:56,131
<i>What the fuck happened? Dad.</i>

1533
01:25:56,301 --> 01:25:59,709
<i>The birds lose, I lose a fucking' fortune,
a fortune to Randy!</i>

1534
01:26:00,119 --> 01:26:02,683
<i>What the fuck did you do?!
You fucking lost it!</i>

1535
01:26:02,853 --> 01:26:05,158
<i>I thought you said you had it together!
You were solid!</i>

1536
01:26:05,523 --> 01:26:07,183
<i>I am solid. I was solid at the game, Dad.</i>

1537
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:08,513
<i>I'm solid, I'm solid now.</i>

1538
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,773
<i>You fell apart!
What are you fucking talking about?!</i>

1539
01:26:10,913 --> 01:26:11,583
<i>Your son was trying to-</i>

1540
01:26:11,778 --> 01:26:14,111
<i>It's all fucking ruined now.
It's all ruined.</i>

1541
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,808
<i>No, Dad!
It's all fucking ruined now!
It's all fucking ruined!</i>

1542
01:26:17,278 --> 01:26:18,358
<i>No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't!</i>

1543
01:26:18,518 --> 01:26:20,427
<i>It's all ruined, you little fucking shit!</i>

1544
01:26:20,566 --> 01:26:21,753
<i>No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking thing!
Come on, Dad!</i>

1545
01:26:21,953 --> 01:26:24,015
<i>You loser! You loser!</i>

1546
01:26:24,176 --> 01:26:26,153
<i>I'm not a loser.</i>

1547
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:28,793
<i>You fucking loser!
You ruined everything!</i>

1548
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:29,458
<i>He was defending his brother!</i>

1549
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:33,542
<i>You fucking idiot!
You spike the ball on the one yard line,</i>

1550
01:26:36,093 --> 01:26:37,251
<i>Who is this?! Who's this?!</i>

1551
01:26:38,021 --> 01:26:40,468
<i>We need to talk right now!
When you make a serious commitment to</i>

1552
01:26:40,623 --> 01:26:41,978
<i>somebody, it is not cool to not show up!</i>

1553
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,618
<i>Wait a second, I tried to call,
my God, what's happening,</i>

1554
01:26:44,793 --> 01:26:47,198
<i>I called--, but I tried to call you,
Tiffany, I-</i>

1555
01:26:48,338 --> 01:26:49,008
<i>Oh, really? Yes.</i>

1556
01:26:49,153 --> 01:26:50,688
<i>I told you I was going to split my time
with my dad and you, and my</i>

1557
01:26:50,828 --> 01:26:52,969
<i>dad was pulling me in one direction.
Doctor Patel, Ronnie-</i>

1558
01:26:53,109 --> 01:26:56,603
<i>Well, that sounds great, Pat.
That's great for all of them, but</i>

1559
01:26:56,738 --> 01:26:59,218
<i>all of them didn't make a commitment
to me in return for my help.</i>

1560
01:27:02,848 --> 01:27:04,048
<i>I'm Tiffany, by the way.</i>

1561
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:09,508
<i>What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell?</i>

1562
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:10,863
<i>There's no craziness.
I told you who she was,</i>

1563
01:27:11,108 --> 01:27:12,967
<i>I was doing this thing with her.
We had a conversation!</i>

1564
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:14,718
<i>She's fucking nuts!
When you started spending time with her,</i>

1565
01:27:14,868 --> 01:27:17,383
<i>it all fell apart.
This is the fucking reason right here.</i>

1566
01:27:17,773 --> 01:27:19,740
<i>You think I fucked up the
Eagles' juju, don't you?</i>

1567
01:27:20,117 --> 01:27:22,504
<i>Ever since, ever since he was
with you, ever since-</i>

1568
01:27:22,644 --> 01:27:24,913
<i>You think that I'm why today's happened?</i>

1569
01:27:25,277 --> 01:27:26,589
<i>That's right, you are why today happened.</i>

1570
01:27:26,733 --> 01:27:27,868
<i>I'm the reason why today happened?</i>

1571
01:27:28,203 --> 01:27:29,433
<i>I think so. Let's talk about that.</i>

1572
01:27:29,658 --> 01:27:30,751
<i>Be my guest.</i>

1573
01:27:31,372 --> 01:27:34,038
<i>The first night that Pat and I met at
my sister's, the Eagles beat the</i>

1574
01:27:34,173 --> 01:27:37,718
<i>Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six.
The second time we got</i>

1575
01:27:37,846 --> 01:27:40,743
<i>together we went for a run and the
Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to</i>

1576
01:27:40,884 --> 01:27:41,753
<i>five in the NLCS.</i>

1577
01:27:42,547 --> 01:27:43,086
<i>She's right, Dad.</i>

1578
01:27:43,542 --> 01:27:46,958
<i>The next time we went for a run the
Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty-</i>

1579
01:27:47,168 --> 01:27:48,033
<i>seven to fourteen.</i>

1580
01:27:48,418 --> 01:27:48,809
<i>Wow.</i>

1581
01:27:49,054 --> 01:27:51,958
<i>The third time we got together we
had Raisin Bran in the diner and</i>

1582
01:27:52,088 --> 01:27:55,097
<i>the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay
in the fourth game of the World</i>

1583
01:27:55,227 --> 01:27:56,200
<i>Series, ten to two.</i>

1584
01:27:56,349 --> 01:27:57,078
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

1585
01:27:57,238 --> 01:27:59,663
<i>Let me think about that. Wait a minute.</i>

1586
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:02,516
<i>Well, why don't you think about when
the Eagles beat the Seahawks,</i>

1587
01:28:02,663 --> 01:28:03,520
<i>fourteen to seven.</i>

1588
01:28:03,988 --> 01:28:06,256
<i>He was with you? He was with me.
We went for a run.</i>

1589
01:28:06,778 --> 01:28:07,526
<i>Really? That's crazy.</i>

1590
01:28:07,665 --> 01:28:10,172
<i>There have been no games since Pat
and I have been rehearsing every</i>

1591
01:28:10,297 --> 01:28:13,823
<i>day and if Pat had been with me
like he was supposed to, he</i>

1592
01:28:13,958 --> 01:28:16,273
<i>wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he
wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the</i>

1593
01:28:16,429 --> 01:28:17,833
<i>Eagles beat the New York Giants.</i>

1594
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,568
<i>She's making a lot of sense, Pop.
That's all right on all counts.</i>

1595
01:28:24,948 --> 01:28:27,880
<i>Does anybody here happen to know
what the official motto of the</i>

1596
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,145
<i>state of New York is on the official
seal of the State of New York?</i>

1597
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:34,105
<i>Huh? Anybody? Do you? Do you know?</i>

1598
01:28:34,115 --> 01:28:38,923
<i>“Excelsior. ” Look it up.
Yeah, “Excelsior. ” Oh Pat.</i>

1599
01:28:39,986 --> 01:28:43,008
<i>Not that I give a fuck about
football or about your</i>

1600
01:28:43,138 --> 01:28:46,072
<i>superstitions, but if it's me
reading the signs, I don't send the</i>

1601
01:28:46,207 --> 01:28:50,641
<i>Eagles guy whose personal motto
is “Excelsior, ” to a fucking Giants</i>

1602
01:28:50,878 --> 01:28:53,950
<i>game, especially when he's
already in a legal situation.</i>

1603
01:28:54,668 --> 01:28:57,623
<i>Unbelievable. Wow.
How did you know all that stuff?</i>

1604
01:28:58,463 --> 01:29:03,978
<i>I did my research.
Well, I got to say, I'm impressed.</i>

1605
01:29:04,402 --> 01:29:05,029
<i>Thank you.</i>

1606
01:29:06,372 --> 01:29:11,039
<i>I got to rethink this whole thing.
I didn't trust it before,</i>

1607
01:29:11,264 --> 01:29:12,524
<i>but I got to say, now I do.</i>

1608
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:17,773
<i>Oh, now you like her,
Dad? I have to say I do. Yup.</i>

1609
01:29:18,733 --> 01:29:23,634
<i>Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know?
You made the bet, I won a lot</i>

1610
01:29:23,848 --> 01:29:26,547
<i>of money, and now look,
your whole family is in turmoil.</i>

1611
01:29:27,159 --> 01:29:30,693
<i>Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You
live for this shit. You've been</i>

1612
01:29:30,838 --> 01:29:32,293
<i>betting against my father for years.</i>

1613
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:33,399
<i>Is that right?</i>

1614
01:29:33,544 --> 01:29:35,343
<i>You're twisting the knife right now.
You get off on it!</i>

1615
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:37,163
<i>That's bullshit! That's not true!
Don't say that!</i>

1616
01:29:37,314 --> 01:29:38,204
<i>You get off on it! If not,
then prove it. Prove it.</i>

1617
01:29:38,442 --> 01:29:39,538
<i>Yeah, prove it, prove it!</i>

1618
01:29:39,713 --> 01:29:42,597
<i>How do you want me to prove it?
How's he going to prove it?</i>

1619
01:29:42,755 --> 01:29:47,296
<i>By giving them the chance to win back
everything, double or nothing.</i>

1620
01:29:47,446 --> 01:29:48,823
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

1621
01:29:49,068 --> 01:29:51,748
<i>Double or nothing on the Bengals, next
week? Is that what you're saying?</i>

1622
01:29:59,083 --> 01:29:59,773
<i>Against the Cowboys.</i>

1623
01:29:59,918 --> 01:30:04,178
<i>That's your team isn't it,
Randy? That's his team!</i>

1624
01:30:04,338 --> 01:30:08,104
<i>I know who his team is.
When is the game?</i>

1625
01:30:08,675 --> 01:30:10,638
<i>December twenty-eight,
last game of the season.</i>

1626
01:30:11,289 --> 01:30:12,779
<i>Oh, my God. Same day as the Benjamin Franklin</i>

1627
01:30:12,956 --> 01:30:15,255
<i>Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition.</i>

1628
01:30:15,915 --> 01:30:18,401
<i>Oh God. Randy,
I thought they were America's Team.</i>

1629
01:30:18,581 --> 01:30:19,627
<i>Don't you believe in America's Team?</i>

1630
01:30:19,855 --> 01:30:21,364
<i>Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team?</i>

1631
01:30:22,193 --> 01:30:25,962
<i>Yeah, I believe in America's Team
but if I win that bet, I win your</i>

1632
01:30:26,135 --> 01:30:30,083
<i>book, you're out of action,
you get no restaurant, no nothing.</i>

1633
01:30:31,255 --> 01:30:34,480
<i>I like it. No. No, Patrizio-</i>

1634
01:30:34,806 --> 01:30:36,273
<i>I believe in the Eagles, I believe in my son,</i>

1635
01:30:36,418 --> 01:30:37,688
<i>I'll take the action. I'll take it.</i>

1636
01:30:38,093 --> 01:30:40,408
<i>Dad! Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!</i>

1637
01:30:40,713 --> 01:30:43,081
<i>I have faith, I have faith.
Excelsior belongs in this house-</i>

1638
01:30:43,673 --> 01:30:45,987
<i>Dad- --not in the State of New York.
In this house.</i>

1639
01:30:46,463 --> 01:30:48,443
<i>Dad, listen to me.
I didn't know that “Excelsior” was the state</i>

1640
01:30:48,583 --> 01:30:49,343
<i>motto of New York, okay?</i>

1641
01:30:49,503 --> 01:30:50,464
<i>I didn't know, either, but now I know.</i>

1642
01:30:50,594 --> 01:30:52,869
<i>I know, but listen to me, this is toxic.
Dad, Dad, Dad, this is</i>

1643
01:30:53,005 --> 01:30:54,318
<i>toxic, you shouldn't be doing this,
you shouldn't be doing-</i>

1644
01:30:54,443 --> 01:30:55,663
<i>Randy, what do you say--</i>

1645
01:30:55,813 --> 01:30:57,072
<i>Be quiet, shut up. You already did
enough. Randy, what do you say?</i>

1646
01:30:57,402 --> 01:31:01,019
<i>My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team
favoured by one and a half points.</i>

1647
01:31:01,144 --> 01:31:01,828
<i>I 'll give you three more.</i>

1648
01:31:02,163 --> 01:31:05,484
<i>Patrizio, stop it! And Randy,
don't you take the bet!</i>

1649
01:31:05,878 --> 01:31:09,133
<i>In fact, I'll give you ten points. No, Dad! Dad!</i>

1650
01:31:09,558 --> 01:31:15,275
<i>Dad! You have to take that bet on the Cowboys.</i>

1651
01:31:15,623 --> 01:31:16,727
<i>Dolores, would you stop him? Jesus!</i>

1652
01:31:16,871 --> 01:31:20,289
<i>How could you not take that bet?
Even with the ten points I give</i>

1653
01:31:20,469 --> 01:31:23,271
<i>you, that's an insane spread to
your advantage. Cowboys are</i>

1654
01:31:23,396 --> 01:31:26,823
<i>cowards. And I'll bet you're such a
coward, you won't take the ten.</i>

1655
01:31:27,383 --> 01:31:30,136
<i>Plus, are you listening, plus
whatever their score is at the</i>

1656
01:31:30,277 --> 01:31:31,593
<i>dance thing. What's that? Tiffany,
what's that?</i>

1657
01:31:32,096 --> 01:31:34,283
<i>What? No, no, no, no.
You're crazy to give away that many</i>

1658
01:31:34,423 --> 01:31:36,496
<i>points. That's ridiculous!
I won't take that!</i>

1659
01:31:36,673 --> 01:31:42,848
<i>However, wait a second.
I do like the idea of a parlay.</i>

1660
01:31:43,253 --> 01:31:48,628
<i>What? No parlay!
No! No, don't do it. Don't do it.</i>

1661
01:31:49,253 --> 01:31:51,176
<i>Pat, how do they run this dance competition?</i>

1662
01:31:51,853 --> 01:31:53,274
<i>I mean, how do they score it and everything?</i>

1663
01:31:53,638 --> 01:31:55,828
<i>I don't know, I don't know how they
fucking score! We're participating.</i>

1664
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:58,042
<i>We're not, we're not a part of it.
There are people, this is a high-</i>

1665
01:31:58,162 --> 01:32:01,508
<i>end dance contest. I don't know. Do
not put it as part of the parlay,</i>

1666
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:03,092
<i>Randy. Don't- They go by the Philadelphia rules.</i>

1667
01:32:05,283 --> 01:32:07,981
<i>Each dancer is scored on a scale of
one to ten, ten being the highest.</i>

1668
01:32:08,141 --> 01:32:09,363
<i>You have to average the four judges' scores.</i>

1669
01:32:10,185 --> 01:32:13,863
<i>Okay, score is from one to ten, right?
And you guys are how good?</i>

1670
01:32:14,083 --> 01:32:16,728
<i>We suck. We don't suck. Pat's a beginner,</i>

1671
01:32:16,953 --> 01:32:19,059
<i>I'm okay, we're happy
just to be going there.</i>

1672
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:21,078
<i>And how are the people
you're competing against?</i>

1673
01:32:21,293 --> 01:32:23,247
<i>They're good. Some of
them are professionals.</i>

1674
01:32:23,703 --> 01:32:26,393
<i>They're good?
Better than you? A lot better.</i>

1675
01:32:27,093 --> 01:32:30,747
<i>A lot better.
So if I was to say you only have to score five,</i>

1676
01:32:30,898 --> 01:32:32,560
<i>I would be really very generous, right?</i>

1677
01:32:32,993 --> 01:32:35,753
<i>No, no, that would be amazing if
we got five. Let's not get away-</i>

1678
01:32:35,893 --> 01:32:37,117
<i>Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten!</i>

1679
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:39,480
<i>Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!</i>

1680
01:32:40,873 --> 01:32:41,763
<i>We can't get five! Give ‘em a five.
Give ‘em a five.</i>

1681
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:42,782
<i>We can do a five.</i>

1682
01:32:42,922 --> 01:32:45,103
<i>What are you talking about, Dad?
You haven't even seen us dance!</i>

1683
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,018
<i>That's the parlay.</i>

1684
01:32:46,184 --> 01:32:47,516
<i>Will somebody please
explain to me the parlay? Please?</i>

1685
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:50,529
<i>You got to win two bets or you lose
the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to</i>

1686
01:32:50,718 --> 01:32:54,643
<i>win, the birds got to beat the Cowboys
plus Pat and Tiffany got to</i>

1687
01:32:54,783 --> 01:32:56,338
<i>get at least a five at the dance.</i>

1688
01:32:56,866 --> 01:33:00,958
<i>That's very, very manic indeed.
That's the parlay. Shake on it.</i>

1689
01:33:02,254 --> 01:33:06,073
<i>You know what?
I'm not going to be a part of this.  Randy,</i>

1690
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:08,698
<i>Randy, you're a sickness. You're a
fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.</i>

1691
01:33:09,153 --> 01:33:11,598
<i>Pat, you can't quit. I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.</i>

1692
01:33:11,929 --> 01:33:15,494
<i>Pat, calm down.
Thank about it. See you later.</i>

1693
01:33:15,643 --> 01:33:17,038
<i>Pat, no. What are you doing?</i>

1694
01:33:17,453 --> 01:33:18,498
<i>Pat. I'm out.</i>

1695
01:33:19,659 --> 01:33:24,318
<i>Here we are again at the one yard line.
DeSean, snatching defeat from</i>

1696
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:26,129
<i>the jaws of victory. There you go.</i>

1697
01:33:26,314 --> 01:33:28,533
<i>What does that even mean, Dad? I'm
not going to make that, that, that</i>

1698
01:33:28,678 --> 01:33:30,573
<i>connection that you're making with
DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter</i>

1699
01:33:30,728 --> 01:33:32,613
<i>anymore okay? Just because
I have the fucking jersey on...</i>

1700
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:34,123
<i>I'm not going to do it. I'm sorry.</i>

1701
01:33:34,369 --> 01:33:37,539
<i>You are not a stand up guy right now.
If it's me reading the</i>

1702
01:33:37,678 --> 01:33:39,481
<i>signs... if it's me reading the signs-</i>

1703
01:33:39,608 --> 01:33:41,234
<i>If it's you reading the signs? You're
reading the signs? Oh, okay.</i>

1704
01:33:43,536 --> 01:33:46,285
<i>Pat! You are not a stand up guy!</i>

1705
01:33:54,511 --> 01:33:56,058
<i>Pat! I told you not to push it.</i>

1706
01:33:56,883 --> 01:33:58,897
<i>Yeah, but he's got to do this thing.
He can't be a quitter.</i>

1707
01:33:59,117 --> 01:33:59,993
<i>He cannot be a quitter.</i>

1708
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:04,813
<i>You took that stupid parlay thing, and
now he won't do the dance and</i>

1709
01:34:04,953 --> 01:34:07,464
<i>it was very constructive for him,
and you ruined it.</i>

1710
01:34:07,588 --> 01:34:08,818
<i>There's only one way to get him to show.</i>

1711
01:34:09,738 --> 01:34:10,653
<i>What's that? Oh, what's that?</i>

1712
01:34:10,818 --> 01:34:13,022
<i>We have to tell him Nikki's going to be there.</i>

1713
01:34:32,405 --> 01:34:33,470
<i>We have to tell him that she's going.</i>

1714
01:34:33,648 --> 01:34:35,213
<i>But that's a lie! It's a white lie.</i>

1715
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:37,354
<i>It's a white lie, what's that matter?
That's no big deal.</i>

1716
01:34:37,848 --> 01:34:39,718
<i>So it's a little lie. There's no other way.</i>

1717
01:34:40,179 --> 01:34:42,918
<i>You know, we got to leave a trail of
bread crumbs so that</i>

1718
01:34:43,053 --> 01:34:45,270
<i>he can live his life without ruining it.</i>

1719
01:34:46,224 --> 01:34:50,103
<i>No. I don't approve. You can't do it.</i>

1720
01:34:50,527 --> 01:34:53,223
<i>Well, you know, I didn't approve
when you called her and you told</i>

1721
01:34:53,370 --> 01:34:56,698
<i>her where he was running, so she could
ambush him. I didn't approve</i>

1722
01:34:56,838 --> 01:35:00,618
<i>of that, but you did it anyway, so
I'm doing this anyway. That's it.</i>

1723
01:35:01,939 --> 01:35:03,133
<i>We're going to tell him Nikki'll be there.</i>

1724
01:35:07,443 --> 01:35:11,243
<i>You got to be part of it. We have to do it.</i>

1725
01:35:13,323 --> 01:35:14,534
<i>Aren't you nervous to be lying?</i>

1726
01:35:15,848 --> 01:35:20,203
<i>Yeah. A little bit. But it's for the best.</i>

1727
01:35:27,048 --> 01:35:28,528
<i>“... but if it was me reading the signs... . ”</i>

1728
01:36:02,991 --> 01:36:03,472
<i>That's it. Okay.</i>

1729
01:36:29,054 --> 01:36:30,318
<i>Hey.</i>

1730
01:36:35,218 --> 01:36:36,500
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

1731
01:36:40,897 --> 01:36:41,400
<i>Sorry I'm late.</i>

1732
01:36:41,447 --> 01:36:41,916
<i>It's fine.</i>

1733
01:38:08,588 --> 01:38:09,969
<i>Come on, it's going to be great.</i>

1734
01:38:10,428 --> 01:38:14,558
<i>Nikki's going to be there. You know?
Everything's going to come together.</i>

1735
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:17,433
<i>It's what's meant to be. You okay?</i>

1736
01:38:19,973 --> 01:38:22,485
<i>Don't get wobbly on me. I'm not.</i>

1737
01:38:23,988 --> 01:38:26,598
<i>We have a dance to do. We have
a parlay. You got to stay focused.</i>

1738
01:38:26,923 --> 01:38:28,821
<i>I'm focused. Okay, let's go.</i>

1739
01:38:47,068 --> 01:38:50,108
<i>Look at the dancers. You see them? Shit.</i>

1740
01:38:54,882 --> 01:38:57,169
<i>Hey, Randy, Jake. What do we got?</i>

1741
01:38:57,554 --> 01:38:59,398
<i>Dallas just tied with another
field goal, three-three.</i>

1742
01:38:59,563 --> 01:39:01,046
<i>I'm worried about the bet.</i>

1743
01:39:01,393 --> 01:39:03,002
<i>Don't worry about the bet.
I'm worried about the bet.</i>

1744
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:04,403
<i>Holy shit.</i>

1745
01:39:07,803 --> 01:39:09,803
<i>Is this “Dancing with the Stars”?</i>

1746
01:39:12,077 --> 01:39:14,033
<i>Well, you knew that.
Maybe you should've scouted ‘em.</i>

1747
01:39:14,123 --> 01:39:16,053
<i>Look at those fucking dancers!</i>

1748
01:39:20,053 --> 01:39:21,953
<i>You can give me the money now, you know?</i>

1749
01:39:22,728 --> 01:39:24,773
<i>Patty, Patty, all we have to
do is we have to make a five.</i>

1750
01:39:24,978 --> 01:39:26,628
<i>That's all. You stay here and
watch the game with me.</i>

1751
01:39:27,032 --> 01:39:29,487
<i>The birds are better when Pat is with me.
We settled that.</i>

1752
01:39:29,818 --> 01:39:33,173
<i>Relax, we're going to do fine, okay?
I'll see you in a little bit.</i>

1753
01:39:33,338 --> 01:39:34,287
<i>I'll see you up there, okay? Okay.</i>

1754
01:39:35,453 --> 01:39:36,488
<i>Hey, Pat, Tiffany!</i>

1755
01:39:37,445 --> 01:39:39,193
<i>Hey. What a glorious, beautiful occasion, man.</i>

1756
01:39:39,443 --> 01:39:41,148
<i>Yeah, yeah. All right, buddy,
I'll see you. Alright.</i>

1757
01:39:41,298 --> 01:39:42,793
<i>Wish me luck, man.</i>

1758
01:39:43,248 --> 01:39:43,933
<i>Excelsior!</i>

1759
01:39:47,033 --> 01:39:47,933
<i>Wait, what's this?</i>

1760
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:49,013
<i>What? I thought you were doing it.</i>

1761
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:51,339
<i>Oh, I thought you were doing it.
We're doing a dance thing anyway</i>

1762
01:39:51,755 --> 01:39:52,254
<i>for God's sake.</i>

1763
01:40:01,025 --> 01:40:03,291
<i>I want you to remember everything.
I want you to remember all of the</i>

1764
01:40:03,434 --> 01:40:04,374
<i>good stuff that we have here.</i>

1765
01:40:04,529 --> 01:40:07,773
<i>Of course I do. Just check in.
I got to go find Veronica.</i>

1766
01:40:09,308 --> 01:40:10,345
<i>Hi, good evening. Evening.</i>

1767
01:40:10,578 --> 01:40:13,749
<i>Check in? How many dancers are there?</i>

1768
01:40:18,023 --> 01:40:22,363
<i>What?! Nikki? Nikki.</i>

1769
01:40:24,363 --> 01:40:26,363
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

1770
01:40:43,098 --> 01:40:44,398
<i>What the fuck?</i>

1771
01:40:44,498 --> 01:40:46,918
<i>Sweetie, sweetie. Honey, calm down.</i>

1772
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,158
<i>You're killing me. You're killing me!</i>

1773
01:40:49,336 --> 01:40:51,498
<i>Tiffany, please.
She'll see how well he's doing,</i>

1774
01:40:51,633 --> 01:40:52,958
<i>maybe she'll lift the restraining order.</i>

1775
01:40:53,824 --> 01:40:55,628
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

1776
01:40:56,143 --> 01:40:58,753
<i>Pat told me.
He told me you should never throw a marriage</i>

1777
01:40:58,903 --> 01:40:59,793
<i>out the window.</i>

1778
01:41:00,394 --> 01:41:02,628
<i>Pat did not say that. He didn't say that.</i>

1779
01:41:03,023 --> 01:41:05,248
<i>He said it several times,
Tiffany, and this is his chance.</i>

1780
01:41:05,593 --> 01:41:06,558
<i>You got to give him a chance.</i>

1781
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:42,518
<i>Bartender! Bartender,
can I get a vodka, please?</i>

1782
01:42:05,973 --> 01:42:09,899
<i>So, you want another one? Sure.</i>

1783
01:43:20,019 --> 01:43:24,598
<i>So what do you do?
I'm a lawyer. Litigator, actually.</i>

1784
01:43:29,093 --> 01:43:30,248
<i>Oh, the arguing kind.</i>

1785
01:43:30,348 --> 01:43:34,676
<i>And the scores for Santos and Aguilar are:
seven point six, seven point three, seven point four, and</i>

1786
01:43:35,373 --> 01:43:41,108
<i>six point nine for an average
score of seven point three.</i>

1787
01:43:41,917 --> 01:43:50,560
<i>Three, two, one! Philadelphia beats
Dallas! They are on their way to the playoffs.</i>

1788
01:44:00,034 --> 01:44:00,485
<i>Where's Tiffany?</i>

1789
01:44:00,753 --> 01:44:02,143
<i>I don't know, Mom. Have you seen her?</i>

1790
01:44:02,982 --> 01:44:04,514
<i>You got to find her.
I know, Mom, I know.</i>

1791
01:44:30,873 --> 01:44:33,450
<i>Hey, WHAT are you doing?
She's fine, buddy, she's with me.</i>

1792
01:44:33,828 --> 01:44:34,843
<i>She's fine? Yeah.</i>

1793
01:44:35,001 --> 01:44:37,396
<i>Why don't you shut up, okay?
How many drinks have you had?</i>

1794
01:44:37,787 --> 01:44:40,083
<i>I've had two vodkas.
Listen, I don't know what choices</i>

1795
01:44:40,333 --> 01:44:42,588
<i>you've made, but you got to deal with
it right now, okay? We're in this.</i>

1796
01:44:43,708 --> 01:44:44,421
<i>We're in what?</i>

1797
01:44:44,628 --> 01:44:48,743
<i>Next, Pat Solatano and Tiffany Maxwell.</i>

1798
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:50,690
<i>You know, I used to think that you
were the best thing that ever</i>

1799
01:44:50,813 --> 01:44:53,083
<i>happened to me, but now I think that
you might maybe be the worst</i>

1800
01:44:53,393 --> 01:44:55,883
<i>thing and I'm sorry that I ever met you.</i>

1801
01:44:56,338 --> 01:44:56,943
<i>Good for you.</i>

1802

<i>seven point two.</i>

1805
01:45:18,853 --> 01:45:22,036
<i>They were great and they
only got a seven point two.</i>

1806
01:45:22,763 --> 01:45:23,298
<i>This is a tough room.</i>

1807
01:45:23,903 --> 01:45:24,228
<i>Got it.</i>

1808
01:45:27,333 --> 01:45:32,664
<i>Up next, ladies and gentlemen please welcome
Pat Solatano, Jr. and Tiffany Maxwell.</i>

four eight, a four nine...</i>

1812
01:49:15,695 --> 01:49:17,423
<i>That's really too bad, guys.
That's a lot of fours.</i>

1813
01:49:18,273 --> 01:49:24,368
<i>... and and a five point four for an
average score of. . five point zero.</i>

1814
01:49:25,490 --> 01:49:29,506
<i>Sorry about that, guys.</i>

1815
01:49:34,939 --> 01:49:36,318
<i>Dad, Dad, did the Eagles win?</i>

1816
01:49:36,624 --> 01:49:39,199
<i>The Eagles won, forty-four-six!
They won, forty- four-six!</i>

1817
01:49:39,949 --> 01:49:40,616
<i>Come on!</i>

1818
01:49:40,826 --> 01:49:45,178
<i>Why are they so excited about a five?</i>

1819
01:50:22,756 --> 01:50:26,669
<i>How are you? You okay? Good. How are
you? I'm really good. Yeah, thanks.</i>

1820
01:50:27,014 --> 01:50:29,033
<i>You looked really happy out there. Did I?</i>

1821
01:50:29,868 --> 01:50:31,963
<i>Yeah. Yeah, who'd have thought, dancing?</i>

1822
01:50:37,068 --> 01:50:38,918
<i>You look incredible. Thank you.</i>

1823
01:50:39,745 --> 01:50:42,417
<i>You lost a lot of weight.
I've been reading your books and,</i>

1824
01:50:42,562 --> 01:50:45,669
<i>I have a positive attitude.
I'm on medication, I'm in therapy.</i>

1825
01:51:48,048 --> 01:51:50,098
<i>Where's Tiffany? She left.
What do you mean, she left?</i>

1826
01:51:50,748 --> 01:51:52,569
<i>She left. What do you think! Where is she?</i>

1827
01:51:53,458 --> 01:51:55,518
<i>Let me tell you,
I know you don't want to listen to your father,</i>

1828
01:51:55,673 --> 01:51:58,153
<i>I didn't listen to mine but
I'm telling you, you got to pay</i>

1829
01:51:58,303 --> 01:52:01,128
<i>attention to the signs. When life
reaches out with a moment like</i>

1830
01:52:01,268 --> 01:52:03,703
<i>this, it's a sin if you don't reach back.
I'm telling you, it's a sin</i>

1831
01:52:04,113 --> 01:52:06,863
<i>if you don't reach back, and it'll haunt
you for the rest of your days</i>

1832
01:52:07,028 --> 01:52:09,778
<i>like a curse. You're facing a big
challenge in your life right now,</i>

1833
01:52:10,093 --> 01:52:12,557
<i>at this very moment, right here.
That girl loves you, she really</i>

<i>loves you. And I don't know
if Nikki ever did, but she sure as</i>

1835
01:52:15,043 --> 01:52:17,713
<i>hell doesn't love you right now. I'm
telling you, don't fuck this up.</i>

1836
01:52:21,093 --> 01:52:22,138
<i>I love you, Dad.</i>

1837
01:52:37,472 --> 01:52:56,313
<i>Hey! Would you just leave me alone?!</i>

1838
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:59,003
<i>Wait a second!
I have one more letter for you to read, okay?</i>

1839
01:52:59,258 --> 01:53:01,453
<i>What the fuck is the matter with you?
Give it to her yourself!</i>

1840
01:53:01,798 --> 01:53:03,819
<i>Let me say something. You don't
ever have to see me again if you</i>

1841
01:53:03,963 --> 01:53:04,810
<i>just read it, alright?</i>

1842
01:53:05,967 --> 01:53:08,290
<i>This is so fucked up.
Yeah, just read it.</i>

1843
01:53:10,744 --> 01:53:12,058
<i>“Dear Tiffany...</i>

1844
01:53:16,383 --> 01:53:17,922
<i>“... I know you wrote the letter.</i>

1845
01:53:26,022 --> 01:53:28,022
<i>The only way you could meet my crazy... . ”</i>

1846
01:53:28,078 --> 01:53:32,558
<i>“... was by doing something crazy yourself.
Thank you.</i>

1847
01:53:32,558 --> 01:53:33,558
<i>I love you.</i>

1848
01:53:37,233 --> 01:53:42,143
<i>I knew it the minute I met you.
I'm sorry it took so long for me to</i>

1849
01:53:42,273 --> 01:53:45,502
<i>catch up. I just got stuck. Pat. ”</i>

1850
01:53:50,502 --> 01:53:52,502
<i>I wrote that a week ago.</i>

1851
01:53:54,088 --> 01:53:56,758
<i>You wrote that a week ago? Yes, I did.</i>

1852
01:53:56,818 --> 01:54:00,763
<i>You let me lie to you for a week?
I was trying to be romantic.</i>

1853
01:54:02,638 --> 01:54:05,874
<i>You love me?
Yeah, I do.</i>

1854
01:54:13,428 --> 01:54:13,943
<i>Okay.</i>

1855
01:54:49,543 --> 01:54:52,645
<i>The world will break your heart ten
ways to Sunday, that's guaranteed.</i>

1856
01:54:53,888 --> 01:54:58,098
<i>And I can't begin to explain that- -or
the craziness inside myself and</i>

1857
01:54:58,278 --> 01:55:02,113
<i>everybody else, but guess what? Sunday
is my favourite day again.</i>

1858
01:55:03,585 --> 01:55:08,618
<i>I think of everything everyone did for me
and I feel like --a very lucky guy.</i>

1859
01:55:12,088 --> 01:55:14,316
<i>We have to beat the Vikings by three.
I'm giving' you a six, which</i>

1860
01:55:14,471 --> 01:55:18,138
<i>is very generous after the beating
you just took. So what are we</i>

1861
01:55:18,288 --> 01:55:19,463
<i>doing', what are we talking' about here?</i>

1862
01:55:19,873 --> 01:55:22,559
<i>I'd like to do another parlay if we make
it to the next round, that's all.</i>

1863
01:55:22,898 --> 01:55:25,003
<i>But we are going to make it to the
next round. We're going to beat...</i>

1864
01:55:25,149 --> 01:55:27,658
<i>No, that was me that did that.
No that was me.</i>

1865
01:55:28,133 --> 01:55:32,345
<i>That was me. I played the Jack. So
you put the bread crumbs, the</i>

1866
01:55:32,495 --> 01:55:34,733
<i>garlic in the steak and you
roll it up with the toothpicks?</i>

1867
01:55:34,973 --> 01:55:38,018
<i>Yeah. For, oh, maybe three hours, plus.</i>

1868
01:55:38,412 --> 01:55:41,053
<i>Everything's good, everything's
good, yeah. I got you, you're all</i>

1869
01:55:41,213 --> 01:55:44,672
<i>down.  No, Randy, he's complaining.
You know he lost a lot</i>

1870
01:55:44,807 --> 01:55:46,819
<i>of money. He's moaning and groaning.
The restaurant's</i>

1871
01:55:46,953 --> 01:55:50,203
<i>happening because of Randy,
so everything's good.</i>
