Yes.

Because some patients fear

that when their memory
comes back,

1034
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,533
so will the memory
of the trauma,

1035
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,933
but mercifully
that's rarely the case.

I mean, what if I don't

that's where I gotta be.

<font color="#808080">BOTH:</font> Hi!

It's good to see you.
All right, take it easy.

1084

The countdown's on, man.
Hey, man.

1085
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,198
One week left of
your former life.

1086
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,432
How you feeling?

1087
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,371
I feel pretty good, actually.

I mean, I do get a little dizzy

if I think about it
for too long, but...

1090

What?

1091
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:16,039
No, honey, it's like
a good dizzy. It's like...

1092
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:19,245
It's like panic or excitement.

1093
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:24,225
Well, panic and excitement
are different.

1094
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,850
Honey, there's gonna
be 400 people there.

1095
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:27,121
Right.

1096
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,688
Hey, do you also have a little
tingling in your fingers?

1097
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:33,393
Yeah. Is that bad?

1100
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:39,565
Thom Yorke, he talks about
dizzy spells all the time.

1101
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:42,104
He says when
his fingers tingle,

1102
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:45,669
that's how he knows that he's
creating something genius.

1103
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:47,304
And then he gets
so amped up playing

1104
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:49,349
that he almost passes out.

1105

you're on the verge of genius.

01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,316

Okay.

1120
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,453
What's your favorite book?

1121
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:34,625
It's probably not
what you remember.

1122
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:36,628
That's fine.
That's not the point.

1123
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,166
<i>Okay. The Beach House

Yeah. Gwen, I think.

said to yourself,

Mmm-hmm.

1136
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:11,895
And you can't remember
how we fell in love.

1137

But it was
the greatest time of my life.

1139
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,503
I just thought
how cool it would be

1140
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,441
to get to experience it
all over again.

1141

I'm sure it seemed

it probably seemed more

Well, let me
tell you what I like.

1386
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:31,814
I like the fact
that Paige told me

1387
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:32,983
everything about you, Jeremy.

1388
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,087
Okay.

1389
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,290
She told me that
when she was with you,

1390
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,627
she would wake up
at night in a panic,

1391
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,168
thinking,
"Is this all there is?"

1392
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:44,960
Wow.

1393
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,333
She told you everything, huh?

1394
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,498
Mmm-hmm.

1395
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,006
Did she tell you
that she threw herself

1396
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,167
at me the other day?

1397
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:52,142
Did she tell you that?

1398
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:54,271
Or did she stop
telling you everything

1399
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,940
when she forgot
who the hell you were?

1400
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:00,286
Look, I get why
you're being such a dick.

1401
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,252
You obviously love her,

1402
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:03,789
and you think you're
gonna get her back.

1403
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:07,116
But the thing is,
she outgrew you.

1404
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:09,959
What makes you think
that won't happen again?

1405
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,465
Thank you for that advice.

And then one afternoon, I
was all alone in the house,

1525
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:35,252
and I started looking at
all the photographs of you

so full of all of us.

in that moment that

that was the most important
thing in the world for me.

1532

I could not go.

for all the things
that he had done right

1538

thing that he had done wrong.

1539
