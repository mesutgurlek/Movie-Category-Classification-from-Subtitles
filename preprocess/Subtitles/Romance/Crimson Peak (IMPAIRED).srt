just a metaphor.

80
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,680
may I offer a
word of advice?

81
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,488
He told me it
needed a love story.

82
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,445

84
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,883

00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,250
Everyone falls in love,
dear. Even women.

86
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,322
I don't want to write
a love story like that.

87
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,806
Well, my darling, I was hoping
to make this a celebratory gift.

thing I know,

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,120
it's the importance of
the right tool for the job.

91

It's beautiful.

92
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,442

I was hoping to type it,

94
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,087

I'm submitting it to

I see you've already
met my daughter, Edith.

136
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,360
The Sharpe clay mines
have been royal purveyors

137
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,240
of the purest scarlet
clay since 1796.

138
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,889
In its liquid form,

139
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,531
it is so rich in ore
and so malleable

140
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,286
that it can produce
the strongest bricks and tiles.

Excessive mining
in the last 20 years

142
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,166
has caused most of our
old deposits to collapse.

143
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,840
This is a clay harvester
of my own design.

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,764
It transports
the clay upwards

I have absolutely
no doubt

148
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,049
this machine will revolutionize clay
mining as we know it.

149
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,170
Turn it off, please.

150
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,842

So, actually, what you have is a toy,
and some fancy words.

154
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,321
Mr. Cushing, I...

155

Yes, that's correct, sir.

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,685
all of us,

163
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,684
came up through
honest, hard work.

164
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,090
Well, maybe not all of us.
Mr. Ferguson, here, is a lawyer.

165
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,443
But even he
can't help that.

166
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,682
I started as
a steel worker

167
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,531
raising buildings before
I could own them.

168
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,085
My hands.

169
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,730
Feel them.

170
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,370
Rough.

171
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,126
The reflection
of who I am.

172
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,250
Now, you, sir,

173
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,802
when I shook your hand...

174
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,771
You've got the softest
hands I've ever felt.

175
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,561
In America, we bank on effort,
not privilege.

176
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,729
That is how we
built this country.

177
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,086
I'm here with all
that I possess, sir.

178
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,686
A name,
a patch of land

179
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,444
and the will to
make it yield.

180
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,931
The least that you
can grant me

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,604
is the courtesy
of your time

182
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,206
and the chance to prove to you
and these fine gentlemen

183
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,930
that my will, dear sir,

184
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,050
is, at the very least,
as strong as yours.

185
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,491
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

186
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,249
I need a corset.

187
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,165
No, you don't.
You look very handsome.

188
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,361
Do I?

189
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,771
Yes, you do,
young man.

190
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,367
I do wish you'd change your mind
and come along tonight.

191
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,603
Mrs. McMichael has
gone to a lot of trouble.

192
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,447
Little Lord Fauntleroy
will be there.

193
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,444
You mean Thomas Sharpe?

194
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,126
Sir Thomas Sharpe,
Baronet.

195
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,443
Apparently, he's taken
an interest in young Eunice.

196
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,285
I saw you spying
on us, child.

197
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,808
Was his proposal
so outrageous

198
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,201
as to merit such a
harsh answer from you?

199
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,044
It wasn't his
proposal, my love.

200
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,531
It was him.

201
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,965
There's something about
him that I don't like.

202
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,805
What, I don't know.

203
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,521
And I don't like
not knowing.

204
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,440
What I saw was
a dreamer facing defeat.

(SIGHS)

206
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,490
Did you see his suit?

207
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,644
It was beautifully tailored,
but at least a decade old.

209

I can see that you observed
far more than I did.

210
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,807
And his shoes were
handmade, but worn.

211
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,200
That'll be young
Dr. McMichael.

212
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,567
He's brought his new
motorcar to collect me.

213
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,802
Come and see it.
Say hello to him.

214
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,002
He's just opened
his new practice.

215
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,322
And he's always been
awfully fond of you.

216
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,370

My, don't we look
smart, Alan.

223
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,525
Oh, it's just something
I threw together.

224
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,604
CARTER: It's Edith who should be
the belle of the ball this evening.

225

Don't you agree, Alan?

226
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,524
As I recall, Edith takes a dim view
of social frivolity.

You lads enjoy
the party.

Don't let him
drink too much.

229
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,921
Hey.

230
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,204
So, she's not coming?

231
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,089
Stubborn to the bone.

232
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,365
Where does she
get that from?

Well, that's absolutely
out of the question, Annie.

Please just tell
him to go away.

And?

demonstrate for us the waltz.

I wanted to apologize.

302
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,490
Edith, we weren't
expecting you.

303
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,608
I know. And I'm sure
there's no place for me...

304
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,966
Don't worry,
my child.

I'll make sure
you find yours.

307
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,681
The waltz.

308
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,125
Not a complicated
dance, really.

309
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,080
The lady takes her place slightly to
the left of the leading gentleman.

310
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,930
Six basic steps,
and that's all.

311
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,890
However, it is said that
the true test of the perfect waltz

312
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,610
is for it to
be so swift,

313
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,171
so delicate

314
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,288
and so smooth

315
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,406
that a candle flame will not be extinguished
in the hand of the lead dancer.

316
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,770
Now, that requires
the perfect partner.

would be delighted.

00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,804
(PLAYING PIANO)

324
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,688
(WHISPERS) Why are
we doing this?

325
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,923
I've always closed my eyes to things
that made me uncomfortable.

326
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,640
It makes
everything easier.

327
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,564
I don't want to
close my eyes.

328
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,048
I want to keep
them open.

329
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,689
(PIANO STOPS)
(APPLAUSE)

330
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,201
Mr. Holly!

331
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,361
Mr. Cushing.

332
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,366
I like the club the first
thing in the morning.

333
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,921
I have it all
to myself.

334
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,729
A great way to
start the day, sir.

335
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,240
There's a young gentleman
and his sister.

336
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,288
I want you to
investigate for me.

337
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,771
There's something not
quite right about them.

338
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,280
I want results.

339
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,165
As soon as possible.

340
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,608
ALAN: You have not been using
the drops regularly...

341
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,530
Edith, come in.

342
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,081
...and I must insist
you do so.

343
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,086
Take this to the druggist
and ask him to prepare it exactly.

344
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,085
And resume the dose.

345
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,369
<i>"Toxicology of the Eye."
"Morphology of the Optic Nerve."</i>

346
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,091
<i>"Principles of Optical
Refraction."</i>

347
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,641
And "Arthur Conan Doyle."

348
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,962
Fancy yourself
a detective?

349
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,282
Well, not really,

350
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,807
but he is an ophthalmologist
just like me.

351
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,086
(CHUCKLES)

352
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,126
Come.

353
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,320
I think you're going to like
what I have to show you.

354
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,922
Ghost photography
is easy to fake.

355
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,321
However, with
glass plates

356
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,926
it is, by definition,
impossible.

357
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,128
I got these in London.

358
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,611
They're genuine.

359
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,401
The image is captured using
a coating of silver salts,

360
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,767
invisible to the naked eye.

361
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,770
It's called
a latent image.

362
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,008
Now, it's my belief
that houses,

363
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,846
places, be it by chemical
compounds in the earth

364
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,731
or the minerals in the stone
can retain impressions

365
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,606
or a person that is
no longer living.

366
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,325
But not everyone
can see them.

367
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,885
The man that just left,

368
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,122
amongst other ailments,
is color blind.

369
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,326
Now, that man will never
perceive the colors red or green.

370
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,848
He only accepts their existence because
the majority around him does.

371
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,685
Perhaps we only
notice things

372
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,969
when the time comes
for us to see them.

373
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,486
(CHUCKLES)

374
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,680
You've never spoken to me
about these interests of yours, Alan.

375
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,683
You've never given
me the chance.

376
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,451
Edith, I understand your
fascination with the Sharpes,

377
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,608
but in your own
best interest,

378
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,524
proceed with caution
is all I ask.

379
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,331
You've been gone
a long time and, well,

380
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,648
I've managed somewhat.

381
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,371
THOMAS: (CHUCKLES)
No, Edith.

382
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,569
I think every time I read it,
it gets better and better.

383
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,688
And I don't mind
the love story at all.

384
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,887
Just a chapter or two.

385
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,485
Well, I like it.

386
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,166
Let me know
what you think.

387
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,049
I'll finish it now.

388
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,525
Is it a butterfly?

389
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,286
No.

390
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,244
But it will be soon.

391
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,164
Oh, I hadn't
seen them.

392
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,004
They're dying.

393
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,245
They take their heat
from the sun

394
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,681
and when it deserts them,
they die.

395
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,531
That's sad.

396
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,160
No, it's not sad,
Edith. It's nature.

397
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,368
It's a savage world
of things dying

398
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,091
or eating each other,
right beneath our feet.

399
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,561
Surely there's
more to it than that.

400
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,849
Beautiful things
are fragile.

401
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,401
At home, we have
only black moths.

402
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,842
Formidable creatures,
to be sure,

403
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,524
but they lack beauty.

404
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,200
They thrive on the
dark and the cold.

405
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,724
What do they
feed on?

406
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,969
Butterflies,
I'm afraid.

407
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,729
Are you sure
about this?

408
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,728
I don't think she's the right choice.
She's too young.

409
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,405
She's just
a child, Thomas.

410
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,483
Lucille, I've
explained all this.

411
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,165
I will need the ring.

412
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,090
The ring's mine.

413
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,810
I earned it.

414
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,809
I will want it back.

415
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,767
Then you'd better
hope I'm successful.

416
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,961
This is the last thing
we have to sell.

417
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,929
You're not selling it.

418
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,362
We are buying
something with it.

419
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,641
Mr. Holly.
Is something the matter?

420
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,961
Mr. Cushing.

421
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,731
It is not often that I am
the bearer of bad news,

422
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,124
but when I am,
I insist upon delivering it myself.

423
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,684
Don't open it here.

424
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,690
(WHISPERS)
Now is the time.

425
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,925
Edith, may I
have a word?

426
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,760
Just one moment.
Let me get my father.

427
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,361
(KNOCKING)

428
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,051
Father.
Everybody's waiting.

429
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,960
I'll be there shortly.

430
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,128
Miss Cushing.

431
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,521
Edith. I really have no
right to ask this, but...

432
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,601
Sir Thomas.

433
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,642
May I speak with you
in my study, please?

434
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,168
You and your sister,
if you would be so kind as to fetch her.

435
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,284
Child, please tell our guests that
we will join them presently.

436
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,763
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

437
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,049
Now, Lady Lucille.

438
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,730
Sir Thomas,
the first time we met

439
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,726
I imagine it was hard for
you to realize that I didn't like you.

440
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,405
You made that
clear enough, sir.

441
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,721
But I had hoped that
now, with time...

442
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,326
Your time, Sir Thomas,
is up.

443
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,482
LUCILLE: Could you speak
plainly, Mr. Cushing?

444
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,444
Plain I will be, missy.

445
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,284
Plainer than you
might like to hear.

446
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,480
In the past few days

447
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,404
your brother has
deemed it fine enough

448
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,324
to mix business with pleasure

449
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,006
by repeatedly engaging
socially with my daughter.

450
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,324
My only daughter.

451
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,164
Sir, I'm aware that I have
no position to offer,

452
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,765
but the fact is...

453
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,763
You are falling
in love with her.

454
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,604
Is that it?

455
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,729
You play the part well.

456
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,409
The other day, my daughter asked me
why I didn't like you.

457
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,331
Honestly, at the time,
I had no good answer.

458
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,487
But now, I do.

459
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,367
That document there
gave me my answer.

460
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,444
That's the first honest
reaction I've seen from you.

461
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,441
Does she know?

462
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,767
No.

463
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,964
But I will tell her,

464
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,646
if that's what it takes
to send you on your way.

465
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,123
Sir, I know you will
find this hard to believe...

466
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,406
You love her.

467
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,641
I know.

468
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,807
You're repeating yourself.

469
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,601
Now, you,

470
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,802
you seem to be the more
collected one, dear.

471
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,003
It's overly
generous, I know.

472
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,640
But if you want that check to clear,
there are two conditions.

473
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,600
There's a train for New York City leaving
first thing tomorrow morning.

474
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,530
You and your brother
better be on it.

475
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,491
Do we understand
each other?

476
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,721
We do.

477
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,485
What is the second
condition?

478
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,244
That concerns my daughter.

479
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,209
Tonight you must

480
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,687
thoroughly break
her heart.

481
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,611
(CLINKING)

482
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,930
Ladies and gentlemen,

483
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,685
we have an unexpected
announcement.

484
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,685
Sir Thomas.

485
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,400
(WHISPERING)
Thank you, Mr. Cushing.

486
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,170
Ladies and gentlemen,

487
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,844
when I first came to
America, my heart was

488
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,162
brimming with a
sense of adventure.

489
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,531
Here, the future actually
seemed to mean something.

490
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,800
I have found warmth and
friendship among you all.

491
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,891
But for now,

492
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,366
farewell.

493
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,684
May we meet again.

494
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,042
Perhaps on
a different shore.

495
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,201
My sister and I
depart for England

496
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,324
just in time
for the winter.

497
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,247
To lasting friendship.

498
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,322
ALL: To lasting friendship.

499
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,721
(SOFTLY)
Excuse me. Sorry.

500
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,091
Edith.

501
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,564
You're leaving us.

502
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,080
We must return home immediately
and attend to our interests.

503
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,568
And with nothing to
hold us in America...

504
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,721
I see.

505
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,844
Your novel.

506
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,367
I read the new chapters.
I'll have them delivered in the morning.

507
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,521
That's very good of you,
thank you.

508
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,840
Would you still like
to know my thoughts?

509
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,411
If we must.

510
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,726
It's absurdly sentimental.

511
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,611
The aches that you describe
with such earnestness.

512
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,250
The pain, the loss.

513
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,680
You clearly haven't
lived at all.

514
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,449
In fact, you only seem to know
what other writers tell you.

515
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,567
That's enough!

516
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,244
You insist on describing
the torments of love

517
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,924
when you clearly know
nothing about them.

518
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,371
I'm not done yet!

519
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,766
What do you dream of?

520
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,604
A kind man?

521
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,967
A pure soul
to be redeemed?

522
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,770
A wounded bird
you can nourish?

523
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,611
Perfection.

524
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,811
Perfection has no
place in love, Edith.

525
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,247
I advise you to return
to your ghosts and fancies.

526
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,486
The sooner, the better.

527
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,767
You know precious little
of the human heart, or love,

528
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,924
or the pain that
comes with it.

529
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,764
You're nothing but
a spoiled child!

LUCILLE: Mother collected
most of these.

813

LUCILLE: Have you heard of
a fore-edge illustration?

814
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,320
No.

815
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,245
There are images hidden
in the book's fore-edge.

821
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,488
He was very respectful
of my mourning.

822
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,210
Nothing happened.

823
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,046
We traveled in
separate cabins.

824
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,523
How considerate.

830

And make little trinkets
to keep her happy.

01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,400
What's she
trying to do?

975
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,166
I don't know.
She's in quite a state.

976
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,569
Tomorrow

977
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,408
I'll go to the depot, pick up the
machine parts and take her with me.

978
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,130
Let her get
some fresh air.

979
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,607
Yes. Get her
out of here.

980
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,324
Once she signs
the final papers,

981
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,084
I want this over with.

982
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:33,162
This is a valve controller
I had fabricated in Glasgow.

983
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,362
This could make
all the difference.

984
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,010

thoughts, Edith.

985
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,050
The Sharpe mines might reopen
if this thing cooperates.

986
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,161
Mr. Sharpe?

987

Thank you.

988
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,650
You're Lady Sharpe,
then?

989
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,804
Forgive me, mum,
but there's a few letters for you.

990
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:53,165
Two of them are certified
letters from your solicitor.

991
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:58,729
And another one comes all
the way from Milan, Italy.

992
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,564
I don't know
anyone in Italy.

993
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,650
Respectfully, your Ladyship,
it's apparent that you do.

994
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,566
THOMAS: Edith.

995
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,562
The storm's picking up.
We ought to leave soon.

996
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,006
Otherwise we won't make
it back to the house.

997
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,570
If you need to stay
the night, Sir Thomas,

998
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,165
we've a small
room downstairs.

999

their forwarding address?

1001
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,531
Thomas and Lucille Sharpe,
yes, in Cumberland, England, sir.

1002
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,846
Thank you.

1003

HOLLY: Dr. McMichael.

1004
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,604
Mr. Holly.
At your service, sir.

1005
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,371
Did you bring the copy
of the information?

1006
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,800
It took some time to obtain
that newspaper clipping.

1007
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,040
It's damn gruesome,
if you ask me.

1008
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,484
It's a shame.

1009
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,487
The only relevant information I could pass
to Mr. Cushing were the civil documents.

1010
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,722
But it was enough to impede
any further relationship

1011
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,246
between Sir Thomas
and Miss Cushing.

1012
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,485
Prevent them
from marrying.

1013
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,166
Why was that?

1014
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,246
Because, you see,

1015
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,527
Sir Thomas is
already married.

1016
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,289
This fellow, Cavendish,
your hero.

1017
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,842
There's a darkness
to him. I like him.

1018
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,400
Does he make it
all the way through?

1019
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,481
It's entirely
up to him.

1020
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,607
What do you mean?
Characters talk to you.

1021
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,081
They transform.
They make choices.

1022
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,605
Choices.

1023
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,489
As to who
they become.

1024

Well, (CHUCKLES) this is rather dismal,
I'm sorry to say.

1028
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,801
Better than the house.
(CHUCKLES)

1029

1031

I was behind.

and twists you
inside out.
