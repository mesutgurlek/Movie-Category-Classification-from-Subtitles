00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:21,897
( ominous music playing )

2
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:37,982
( birds twittering )

00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:50,494
NARRATOR:
Once upon a time
in a faraway land

4
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,296
a young prince lived
in a shining castle.

5
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:57,962
Although he had
everything his heart desired

6
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:03,067
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.

7
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:05,509
But then, one winter's night

8
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:08,844
an old beggar woman
came to the castle

9
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:11,475
and offered him a single rose

10
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:15,248
in return for shelter
from the bitter cold.

11
00:01:15,354 --> 00:01:17,914
Repulsed by
her haggard appearance

12
00:01:17,957 --> 00:01:22,826
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away

13
00:01:22,862 --> 00:01:26,992
but she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances

14
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:29,126
for beauty is found within

15
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:31,728
and when he dismissed her again

16
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:34,740
the old woman's ugliness
melted away

17
00:01:34,774 --> 00:01:37,504
to reveal
a beautiful enchantress.

18
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:41,070
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late

19
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:44,776
for she had seen that there was
no love in his heart

20
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:47,513
and as punishment,
she transformed him

21
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:49,145
into a hideous beast

22
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:52,453
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle

23
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:54,426
and all who lived there.

24
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,860
Ashamed of his monstrous form

25
00:01:56,896 --> 00:02:00,423
the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle

26
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:03,526
with a magic mirror
as his only window

27
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,230
to the outside world.

28
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:10,401
The rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose

29
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:14,174
which would bloom
until his 21st year.

30
00:02:14,213 --> 00:02:17,046
If he could learn
to love another

31
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:22,248
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell

32
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:25,347
then the spell would be broken.

33
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:30,829
If not, he would be doomed
to remain a beast for all time.

34
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:32,797
( thunder crashing )

35
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:37,064
As the years passed,
he fell into despair

36
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:40,163
and lost all hope

37
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:44,438
for who could ever learn
to love a beast?

38
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:53,979
( rooster crowing )

39
00:02:56,422 --> 00:02:59,016
( birds twittering )

40
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:16,641
Little town,
it's a quiet village

41
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:21,443
Every day
like the one before

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,940
Little town,
full of little people

43
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:31,582
Waking up... to... say...

44
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:32,488
Bonjour!

45
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:33,389
Bonjour!

46
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:34,393
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

47
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:35,018
Bonjour!

48
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:36,688
There goes the baker

49
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:39,596
With his tray like always

50
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:42,829
The same old bread
and rolls to sell

51
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:44,699
Every morning just the same

52
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:46,261
Since the morning
that we came

53
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:48,000
To this poor
provincial town...

54
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,029
Good morning, Belle.

55
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:50,042
Good morning, Monsieur.

56
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:51,065
Where are you off to?

57
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,042
The bookshop.

58
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:54,273
I just finished
the most wonderful story

59
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,211
about a beanstalk
and an ogre, and...

60
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:57,374
That's nice.

61
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,678
Marie! The baguettes.

62
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:00,242
Hurry up!

63
00:04:00,286 --> 00:04:01,253
Look, there she goes

64
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,755
The girl is strange,
no question

65
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:07,225
Dazed and distracted,
can't you tell?

66
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:09,022
Never part of any crowd

67
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:10,926
'Cause her head's
up on some cloud

68
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:14,899
No denying she's a funny girl,
that Belle

69
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,094
Bonjour

70
00:04:16,135 --> 00:04:17,102
Good day

71
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:18,865
How is your family?

72
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:19,871
Bonjour

73
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:20,894
Good day

74
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,805
How is your wife?

75
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,672
I need six eggs

76
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,177
That's too expensive

77
00:04:26,211 --> 00:04:30,477
There must be more
than this provincial life...

78
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:32,006
MAN:
Ah, Belle.
( bell jingles )

79
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,039
Good morning.

80
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:34,916
I've come to return
the book I borrowed.

81
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:35,920
Finished already?

82
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:37,148
Oh, I couldn't put it down.

83
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,247
Have you got anything new?

84
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:39,255
( chuckling )

85
00:04:39,358 --> 00:04:40,416
Not since yesterday.

86
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:41,824
That's all right.

87
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,885
I'll borrow... this one.

88
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:44,987
That one?

89
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,429
But you've read it twice.

90
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:48,695
Well, it's my favorite--
far-off places

91
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:50,099
daring sword fights

92
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:51,966
magic spells, a
prince in disguise.

93
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:55,201
If you like it
all that much, it's yours.

94
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,265
- But, sir...
- I insist.

95
00:04:57,342 --> 00:04:58,274
Well, thank you.

96
00:04:58,377 --> 00:04:59,571
Thank you very much.

97
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:01,169
Look, there she goes

98
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,773
That girl is so peculiar

99
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:07,115
I wonder
if she's feeling well

100
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:08,915
With a dreamy, far-off look

101
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:10,683
And her nose stuck in a book

102
00:05:10,722 --> 00:05:14,818
What a puzzle to the rest
of us is Belle

103
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,730
Oh, isn't this amazing?

104
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:30,232
It's my favorite part
because you'll see

105
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:36,440
Here's where she meets
Prince Charming

106
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:40,212
But she won't discover
that it's him

107
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:43,653
Till Chapter Three

108
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:45,680
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

109
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:49,251
Now, it's no wonder
that her name means beauty

110
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:52,491
Her looks have got
no parallel

111
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:54,396
But behind
that fair facade

112
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:56,526
I'm afraid
she's rather odd

113
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:58,502
Very different
from the rest of us

114
00:05:58,537 --> 00:06:00,368
GROUP:
She's nothing like
the rest of us

115
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:04,205
Yes, different
from the rest of us is Belle

116
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,210
( gun fires )

117
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:09,009
( panting )

118
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:11,038
Wow, you didn't miss
a shot, Gaston.

119
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,141
You're the greatest hunter

120
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:13,378
in the whole world.

121
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:15,045
I know.

122
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:17,055
No beast alive
stands a chance against you

123
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:19,023
and no girl,
for that matter.

124
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:20,024
It's true, Lefou

125
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:22,458
and I've got my sights set
on that one.

126
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:24,223
LEFOU:
The inventor's daughter?

127
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:27,059
She's the one-- the lucky girl
I'm going to marry.

128
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:28,157
But, she...

129
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,497
The most beautiful girl in town.

130
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:30,660
I know, but...

131
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:32,465
That makes her the best

132
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:34,193
and don't I
deserve the best?

133
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:35,258
Well, of course.

134
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:36,495
I mean, you do, but...

135
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:39,767
Right from the moment
when I met her, saw her

136
00:06:39,806 --> 00:06:39,900
I said, "She's gorgeous,"
and I fell

137
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,700
I said, "She's gorgeous,"
and I fell

138
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,730
Here in town there's only she
who is beautiful as me

139
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:51,802
So, I'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle

140
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:55,781
Look, there he goes,
isn't he dreamy?

141
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:58,910
Monsieur Gaston,
oh, he's so cute

142
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:02,582
Be still, my heart,
I'm hardly breathing

143
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:06,115
He's such a tall, dark,
strong and handsome brute

144
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,424
- Bonjour / Pardon
- Good day / Mais oui

145
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,396
- You call this bacon?
- What lovely grapes

146
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,023
- Ten yards / Some cheese
- 'Scuse me / One pound

147
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,033
I'll get the knife

148
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,056
Please let me through

149
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,159
This bread / Those fish

150
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,191
It's stale / They smell

151
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,260
Madame's mistaken

152
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,532
There must be more

153
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:21,169
Than this provincial life

154
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,900
Just watch, I'm going
to make Belle my wife

155
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:25,906
Look, there she goes

156
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,602
A girl who's strange
but special

157
00:07:28,643 --> 00:07:31,942
A most peculiar mademoiselle

158
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,504
It's a pity and a sin

159
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:35,311
She doesn't quite fit in

160
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,112
'Cause she really is
a funny girl

161
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:39,450
A beauty but a funny girl

162
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:44,481
She really is a funny girl

163
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:47,654
That Belle...

164
00:07:47,695 --> 00:07:50,596
GASTON:
Bonjour, bonjour.

165
00:07:50,632 --> 00:07:53,865
( song ends )

166
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:55,093
Hello, Belle.

167
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:56,828
Bonjour, Gaston.

168
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:58,995
Gaston,
may I have my book, please?

169
00:07:59,037 --> 00:08:00,163
How can you read this?

170
00:08:00,205 --> 00:08:01,297
There's no pictures.

171
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,398
Well, some people
use their imagination.

172
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,500
Belle, it's about time
you got your head

173
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:06,532
out of those books

174
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:09,308
and paid attention
to more important things...

175
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,472
like me.

176
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:12,312
( gasping and sighing )

177
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,851
The whole town's
talking about it.

178
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:16,911
It's not right
for a woman to read.

179
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,719
Soon she starts getting ideas,
and thinking...

180
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:21,282
Gaston,
you are positively primeval.

181
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:22,918
( chuckling ):
Why, thank you, Belle.

182
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,223
What do you say you and me

183
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:25,729
take a walk over to the tavern

184
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:27,322
and take a look
at my trophies?

185
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:29,128
Maybe some other time.

186
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:30,293
What's wrong with her?

187
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:31,324
She's crazy.

188
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:32,893
He's gorgeous.

189
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:34,268
Please, Gaston, I can't.

190
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,535
I have to get home
to help my father.

191
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:37,541
Good-bye.

192
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:39,065
( laughing ):
That crazy old loon--

193
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,543
he needs all the
help he can get.

194
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:41,545
( laughing )

195
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,240
Don't talk about my father

196
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:44,179
that way.

197
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:46,910
Yeah, don't talk
about her father that way.

198
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:48,646
My father is not crazy.

199
00:08:48,686 --> 00:08:49,710
He's a genius.

200
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:51,687
( explosion and whistling )

201
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:53,155
( both laughing )

202
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,452
Ooh!

203
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:59,118
( man coughing )

204
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,429
( coughing ):
Papa?

205
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:06,936
How on earth did that happen?

206
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:08,438
Doggone it!

207
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:10,303
Are you all right, Papa?

208
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:14,107
I'm about ready to give
up on this hunk of junk.

209
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:15,941
You always say that.

210
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,140
I mean it this time.

211
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,113
I'll never get

212
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:20,480
this boneheaded contraption
to work!

213
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,644
Yes, you will

214
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:24,017
and you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.

215
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:24,986
Humph!

216
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,957
And become
a world-famous inventor.

217
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:29,960
You really believe that?

218
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:31,518
I always have.

219
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:33,655
Well, what are we waiting for?

220
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:36,325
I'll have this thing fixed
in no time.

221
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,766
Hand me that, uh...

222
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,496
dog-legged clincher, there.

223
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,335
So, did you have a
good time in town today?

224
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:44,498
I got a new book.

225
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,978
Papa, do you think I'm odd?

226
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,267
My daughter? Odd?

227
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:52,208
Where would you get
an idea like that?

228
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:53,335
Oh, I don't know.

229
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:56,244
It's just that I'm not sure
I fit in here.

230
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,714
There's no one
I can really talk to.

231
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:00,512
What about that Gaston?

232
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:02,280
He's a handsome fellow.

233
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,154
He's handsome, all right,
and rude, and conceited, and...

234
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,885
Oh, Papa, he's not for me.

235
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:09,324
Well, don't you worry

236
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,295
'cause this invention's
going to be the start

237
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,763
of a new life for us.

238
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:15,356
I think that's done it.

239
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,264
Now, let's give it a try.

240
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:19,030
( whistle blowing )

241
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,332
( steam hissing )

242
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,669
( gears clanking )

243
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:26,975
( whirring )

244
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:32,780
It works!

245
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:35,115
It does?

246
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:36,312
- ( glass breaking )
- It does!

247
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:37,321
You did it!

248
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:38,617
You really did it!

249
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:40,385
Hitch up Philippe, girl.

250
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,688
I'm off to the fair!

251
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:44,160
( grunting )

252
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:45,423
Good-bye, Papa.

253
00:10:45,496 --> 00:10:46,861
Good luck.

254
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:50,025
Good-bye, Belle,
and take care while I'm gone.

255
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:07,806
( nickers anxiously )

256
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:08,876
We should be there
by now.

257
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,977
( hooting )

258
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,181
Maybe we've missed
the turn.

259
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:14,122
I guess I should have taken...

260
00:11:14,158 --> 00:11:15,591
Wait a minute.

261
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:19,694
( nickering )

262
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,028
Let's go this way.

263
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:24,034
( nickering )

264
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:26,628
( distant roaring )

265
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,399
( birds chirping )

266
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,744
Come on, Philippe,
it's a shortcut.

267
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,268
We'll be there in no time.

268
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,417
( creatures calling )

269
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:55,021
( alarmed nickering )

270
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:56,623
This can't be right.

271
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:59,363
Where have you taken us,
Philippe?

272
00:11:59,403 --> 00:12:02,201
We'd better turn around.

273
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:03,638
( distant howling )

274
00:12:03,674 --> 00:12:05,107
Whoa...

275
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,542
Whoa, boy, whoa, whoa, Philippe.

276
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,540
Oh...!

277
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:12,155
Oh, look out!

278
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:12,382
Oh, look out!

279
00:12:12,422 --> 00:12:14,117
( screeching )

280
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,747
Whoa!

281
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:19,757
Whoa, boy!

282
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,624
Back up, back up, back up!

283
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,719
Good boy, good boy.

284
00:12:24,762 --> 00:12:25,786
That's it.

285
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,854
Back up!

286
00:12:26,898 --> 00:12:28,627
Steady, steady.

287
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,724
Now, steady.

288
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:31,098
( wolf howling )

289
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:32,124
( whinnying )

290
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,933
Philippe, no!

291
00:12:39,877 --> 00:12:41,208
Philippe.

292
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:44,043
( thunder rumbling )

293
00:12:44,082 --> 00:12:45,879
Oh...

294
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:51,778
( menacing growls )

295
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:53,950
( gasping )

296
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:55,288
( growling )

297
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:59,057
( wolf howling )

298
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:00,564
( growling )

299
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:02,566
( grunting )

300
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:05,092
( thunder crashing )

301
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:06,933
( menacing growl )

302
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:08,939
Help!

303
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:11,336
Is someone there?!

304
00:13:11,336 --> 00:13:12,860
Help!

305
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:14,496
( growling )

306
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:18,810
Oh!

307
00:13:19,945 --> 00:13:20,934
( crying out )

308
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:22,537
( wolves snarling )

309
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:25,505
( gasps )

310
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,189
( thunder crashing )

311
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:38,830
( creaking )

312
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:41,298
What...?

313
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,325
Oh...

314
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:45,666
( creaking )

315
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:50,065
( voice echoing ):
Hello?

316
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:53,702
Hello?

317
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:57,044
MALE 1:
Poor fellow, must have
lost his way in the woods.

318
00:13:57,082 --> 00:13:59,380
MALE 2:
Keep quiet; maybe
he'll go away.

319
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:01,681
Is someone there?

320
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,417
Not a word, Lumiere;
not one word.

321
00:14:05,524 --> 00:14:09,426
I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse

322
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:11,656
and I need a place to stay

323
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:12,788
for the night.

324
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,822
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.

325
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:16,424
Shh!

326
00:14:16,535 --> 00:14:17,433
( sizzling )

327
00:14:17,536 --> 00:14:18,525
( yelping )

328
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,232
Of course, Monsieur,
you are welcome here.

329
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:22,831
Who said that?

330
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:24,842
Over here.

331
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:26,138
Where?

332
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:27,076
Allo.

333
00:14:27,112 --> 00:14:27,601
( gasps )

334
00:14:27,646 --> 00:14:28,544
( grunts )

335
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,445
( groans )

336
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:32,278
Incredible.

337
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:35,013
Well, now you've done it,
Lumiere.

338
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:37,112
Splendid, just peachy. Ah!

339
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:38,588
How is this accomplished?

340
00:14:38,623 --> 00:14:39,817
Put me down at once!

341
00:14:39,858 --> 00:14:40,825
Stop that!

342
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:41,883
( giggling )

343
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:43,227
Stop that, I say.

344
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:45,195
( chuckling )

345
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:46,196
Ow!

346
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,288
( yelling )

347
00:14:48,632 --> 00:14:51,328
Huh... Close that at once.

348
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:52,835
Do you mind?!

349
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,235
I-I beg your pardon.

350
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:57,206
It's, it's just
that I've never seen a...

351
00:14:57,241 --> 00:15:00,608
( snorting )

352
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:02,805
( sneezing )

353
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,610
( squeaking )

354
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:06,240
( sniffling )

355
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:08,410
Oh, you are soaked to the bone,
Monsieur.

356
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,612
Come, warm yourself by the fire.

357
00:15:10,654 --> 00:15:11,621
Thank you.

358
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:12,917
COGSWORTH:
No, no, no.

359
00:15:12,957 --> 00:15:16,256
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

360
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:20,059
I demand
that you stop right there.

361
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:21,298
Oh, no, no!

362
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:23,266
Not the master's chair.

363
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,892
( barking )

364
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:26,095
I'm not seeing this!

365
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:27,364
I am not seeing this!

366
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:31,966
( chuckling ):
Well, hello there, boy.

367
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:34,102
( friendly panting )

368
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:37,407
What service.

369
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:40,212
All right,
this has gone far enough.

370
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:41,775
I'm in charge here.

371
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:44,117
How would you like
a nice spot of tea, sir?

372
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:45,746
It'll warm you up
in no time.

373
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:47,757
No. No tea.

374
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,088
No tea!

375
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:51,822
( giggling )

376
00:15:51,862 --> 00:15:53,352
His mustache tickles, Mama.

377
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:54,364
Oh!

378
00:15:54,398 --> 00:15:55,626
( chuckling )

379
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,826
Hello.

380
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:58,926
( ominous rumbling )

381
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:01,838
( clattering )

382
00:16:01,872 --> 00:16:03,533
Uh-oh.

383
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:05,633
Oh...

384
00:16:07,978 --> 00:16:11,414
( growling deeply )

385
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:12,312
Ah...

386
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:14,317
There's a stranger here.

387
00:16:14,351 --> 00:16:15,875
Master, allow me to explain.

388
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,945
The gentleman
was lost in the woods.

389
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:19,216
He was cold and wet...

390
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:21,121
( roaring thunderously )

391
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:23,626
Master, I'd like
to take this moment to say

392
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:25,595
I was against this
from the start.

393
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:26,857
It was all his fault.

394
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:30,025
I tried to stop them,
but would they listen to me? No.

395
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,297
( roaring
thunderously )

396
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,063
( gasping )

397
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:37,130
Who are you?

398
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:38,402
What are you doing here?

399
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:40,910
I-I-I was lost in the woods,
and, and...

400
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:41,877
You're not welcome here!

401
00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:45,006
I-I-I'm sorry.

402
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:46,175
What are you staring at?!

403
00:16:46,216 --> 00:16:47,240
N-Nothing.

404
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:49,548
So, you've come to stare

405
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:50,985
at the Beast, have you?!

406
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:52,318
Please, I meant no harm!

407
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:54,221
I just needed
a place to stay.

408
00:16:54,258 --> 00:16:56,158
I'll give you
a place to stay.

409
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:57,319
Oh, no...!

410
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:58,658
Please! Oh, no!

411
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:01,130
( door slams
with an echoing thud )

412
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:07,228
Oh, boy, Belle's going to get
the surprise of her life

413
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:08,632
huh, Gaston?

414
00:17:08,668 --> 00:17:11,296
Yep. This is her lucky day.

415
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:13,306
( thudding )

416
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,637
( Gaston clears throat )

417
00:17:14,674 --> 00:17:17,768
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

418
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:20,439
But first I'd better go in there
and propose to the girl.

419
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,448
( laughing )

420
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:23,448
( sobbing )

421
00:17:23,517 --> 00:17:25,109
And you, Lefou--
now, when

422
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:26,710
Belle and I come
out that door...

423
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:27,685
Oh, I know, I know!

424
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:29,154
I-I strike up the band.

425
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:32,556
( playing "Here Comes the Bride"
at fast tempo )

426
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:33,718
Not yet!

427
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,455
Sorry.

428
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,497
( knocking )

429
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:46,705
( groans )

430
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,037
Gaston.

431
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:49,838
What a pleasant surprise.

432
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:51,138
Isn't it, though?

433
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:53,305
I'm just full of surprises.

434
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:55,473
You know, Belle, there's
not a girl in town

435
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:57,483
who wouldn't love
to be in your shoes.

436
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:59,678
This is the day...

437
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:01,209
Hmm.

438
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:02,448
Yeah.

439
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:03,423
This is the day your
dreams come true.

440
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:04,685
This is the day your
dreams come true.

441
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:08,023
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

442
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:11,553
Plenty. Here, picture this:

443
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:13,657
A rustic hunting lodge

444
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,794
my latest kill
roasting on the fire

445
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:19,931
and my little wife,
massaging my feet

446
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,338
while the little ones

447
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:23,069
play on the floor
with the dogs.

448
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:24,269
We'll have six or seven.

449
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,175
Dogs?

450
00:18:25,212 --> 00:18:26,179
No, Belle!

451
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:27,407
Strapping boys,
like me.

452
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:28,414
Imagine that.

453
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:29,415
And do you know

454
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:31,007
who that little
wife will be?

455
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:32,018
Let me think.

456
00:18:32,052 --> 00:18:33,076
You, Belle.

457
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,245
Gaston, I'm...

458
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:35,584
I'm...

459
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:36,919
speechless.

460
00:18:36,957 --> 00:18:39,448
I really don't
know what to say.

461
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:40,459
Say you'll marry me.

462
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:43,655
I'm very sorry,
Gaston, but...

463
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:44,664
but...

464
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:45,995
I just don't deserve you.

465
00:18:46,032 --> 00:18:47,863
- Whoa!
- ( water splashes )

466
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:51,598
( playing
"Here Comes the Bride" )

467
00:18:58,411 --> 00:18:59,673
( pig oinks )

468
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:00,941
( squeals )

469
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:02,949
So, how'd it go?

470
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:04,382
( grunts )

471
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:07,750
I'll have Belle for my wife.

472
00:19:07,787 --> 00:19:10,551
Make no mistake about that!

473
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,558
Touchy.

474
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:13,684
( snorting )

475
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:22,363
Is he gone?

476
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:23,562
( chickens clucking )

477
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:24,934
Can you imagine?

478
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:26,836
He asked me to marry him.

479
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:30,365
Me, the wife of that boorish,
brainless...

480
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,140
Madame Gaston

481
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,806
Can't you just see it?

482
00:19:34,848 --> 00:19:36,281
Madame Gaston

483
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:37,647
His little wife

484
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:38,844
( clucking, bleating )

485
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:41,445
No, sir, not me

486
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:42,851
I guarantee it

487
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:46,450
I want much more
than this provincial life

488
00:19:55,635 --> 00:20:00,629
I want adventure
in the great, wide somewhere

489
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:04,336
I want it more
than I can tell

490
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:09,178
And for once
it might be grand

491
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:12,673
To have someone understand

492
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:19,351
I want so much more
than they've got planned.

493
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:23,269
( horse neighs )

494
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:24,497
Philippe!
What are you doing here?

495
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:25,970
Where's...?

496
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:27,131
Where's Papa?

497
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:28,504
Where is he, Philippe?

498
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:29,768
What happened?

499
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:31,208
Oh, we have to find him.

500
00:20:31,244 --> 00:20:34,077
You have to take me to him.

501
00:20:34,113 --> 00:20:37,082
( ominous music playing )

502
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:47,958
What is this place?

503
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:49,325
( snorting )

504
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:50,386
( neighing )

505
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:51,396
Philippe, please!

506
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,454
Steady!

507
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:54,090
( neighing continues )

508
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:55,430
Steady.

509
00:20:55,468 --> 00:20:58,460
( gasps )

510
00:20:58,504 --> 00:21:00,768
Papa.

511
00:21:00,806 --> 00:21:03,707
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

512
00:21:03,743 --> 00:21:06,041
Just had to invite him
to stay, didn't we?

513
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:07,602
Serve him tea.

514
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:09,205
Sit in the master's chair.

515
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:10,613
Pet the pooch.

516
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,618
I was trying
to be hospitable.

517
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:13,584
( door creaking )

518
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:15,211
( echoing ):
Hello?

519
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:18,087
Is anyone here?

520
00:21:18,124 --> 00:21:21,855
Hello? Papa?

521
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:24,021
Papa?

522
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:26,190
Are you here?

523
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:29,201
Mama, there's a girl
in the castle.

524
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:32,602
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

525
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:34,128
Really, Mama.
I saw her.

526
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:35,105
Not another word.

527
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:36,108
But...

528
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:37,109
Into the tub.

529
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:38,110
Woop...

530
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:40,112
Well! I saw a girl
in the castle!

531
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:42,706
See? I told you.

532
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:44,716
Irresponsible,
devil-may-care

533
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,684
waxy-eared,
slack-jawed...

534
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:47,879
BELLE:
Papa?

535
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:50,587
Did you see that?

536
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:53,116
( gasps )

537
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,524
It's a girl!

538
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:55,855
I know it's a girl.

539
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:56,793
Don't you see?

540
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:57,989
She's the one--

541
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,691
the girl we have
been waiting for.

542
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:01,131
She has come
to break the spell!

543
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:02,498
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

544
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:07,672
Papa?

545
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:08,969
( door creaks )

546
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:10,339
Papa?

547
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:13,405
Hello?

548
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:15,380
Is someone here?

549
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:16,745
Wait!

550
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:18,773
I'm looking for
my father. I...

551
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:22,413
That's funny.

552
00:22:22,455 --> 00:22:26,414
I'm sure there was someone.

553
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:27,926
I-Is anyone here?

554
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,257
MAURICE:
Belle?

555
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:31,263
Papa!

556
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:33,859
H-How did you find me?

557
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:35,423
Oh, your hands
are like ice.

558
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:36,594
( coughing )

559
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:38,034
I have to get
you out of there.

560
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,697
Belle, I want you
to leave this place.

561
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:40,831
Who's done this to you?

562
00:22:40,873 --> 00:22:42,238
No time to explain.

563
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:43,263
You must go! Now!

564
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:44,333
I won't leave you!

565
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:45,867
What are you doing here?

566
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:46,843
Run, Belle!

567
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:48,506
Who's there?
Who are you?

568
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:50,242
The master of this castle.

569
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:51,078
( snarling )

570
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:52,880
I've come for my father.

571
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:54,351
Please let him out.

572
00:22:54,387 --> 00:22:55,615
Can't you see he's sick?

573
00:22:55,654 --> 00:22:57,747
Then he shouldn't have
trespassed here!

574
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,348
But he could die.

575
00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:00,689
Please, I-I'll do anything.

576
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:03,320
There's nothing you can do.

577
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:04,454
He's my prisoner.

578
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:07,031
Oh, there must be
some way I can...

579
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:08,158
Wait!

580
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:15,468
Take me instead.

581
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:18,305
You?!

582
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:20,312
You would...

583
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:21,779
take his place?

584
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:22,803
Belle, no!

585
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:24,816
You don't know
what you're doing!

586
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,045
If I did,
would you let him go?

587
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:31,682
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.

588
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:35,526
Come into the light.

589
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:47,329
( gasps )

590
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:48,499
No, Belle!

591
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:51,702
I won't let you do this!

592
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:54,338
You have my word.

593
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,348
Done!

594
00:23:56,382 --> 00:23:58,407
( door unlocking )

595
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,318
No, Belle,
listen to me.

596
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:02,945
I'm old.
I've lived my life.

597
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:04,012
Wait.

598
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:04,715
Belle!

599
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:05,451
Wait!

600
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:08,187
No, please spare my daughter.

601
00:24:08,227 --> 00:24:09,353
Please!

602
00:24:09,395 --> 00:24:10,726
She's no longer
your concern.

603
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:11,855
( grunts )

604
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:13,296
Take him
to the village.

605
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:14,299
Let me out!

606
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,595
Please let me out!

607
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:17,397
Let me out!

608
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:20,200
Please! Oh, please!

609
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:23,697
( sobbing )

610
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
Master?

611
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:27,401
What?

612
00:24:27,446 --> 00:24:29,880
Since the girl is going
to be with us

613
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:31,212
for quite some time

614
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,310
I was thinking that you
might want to offer her

615
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:35,980
a more comfortable room.

616
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:37,682
( fierce growling )

617
00:24:37,723 --> 00:24:39,588
Then again, maybe not.

618
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,024
( sobbing )

619
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,996
You didn't even let me
say good-bye.

620
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,055
I'll never see him
again.

621
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:50,227
I didn't get
to say good-bye.

622
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:52,066
I'll show you to your room.

623
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:53,503
My room?

624
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:54,972
But I thought...

625
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:57,066
You want to stay in the tower?

626
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:57,837
No.

627
00:24:57,877 --> 00:24:59,037
Then follow me.

628
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:15,259
( gasping )

629
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:21,864
Say something to her.

630
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:23,926
Huh? Oh.

631
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:27,496
l, uh, hope you like it here.

632
00:25:29,074 --> 00:25:32,635
The castle is your home now,
so you can go anywhere you like

633
00:25:32,678 --> 00:25:34,009
except the west wing.

634
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:34,876
What's in the west...?

635
00:25:34,914 --> 00:25:36,848
It's forbidden!

636
00:25:43,122 --> 00:25:45,056
Now, if you need anything

637
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,115
my servants will attend you.

638
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:48,592
Dinner.
Invite her to dinner.

639
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:51,357
You will join me
for dinner.

640
00:25:51,397 --> 00:25:53,490
That's not a request!

641
00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:54,863
( door slams )

642
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,128
( gasping )

643
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:01,510
( sobbing )

644
00:26:07,552 --> 00:26:09,782
( wind whistling )

645
00:26:11,689 --> 00:26:13,589
GASTON:
Who does she think she is?

646
00:26:13,624 --> 00:26:16,457
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

647
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:18,462
No one says no
to Gaston.

648
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:19,553
Darn right.

649
00:26:19,597 --> 00:26:21,827
Dismissed, rejected...

650
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:23,390
publicly humiliated.

651
00:26:23,434 --> 00:26:25,800
Why, it's more
than I can bear.

652
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:26,860
More beer?

653
00:26:26,904 --> 00:26:27,836
What for?

654
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:29,169
Nothing helps.

655
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:30,468
I'm disgraced.

656
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:31,735
Who, you?

657
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:34,078
Never!

658
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:37,013
Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.

659
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:39,915
Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston

660
00:26:39,951 --> 00:26:41,851
Looking so down
in the dumps

661
00:26:43,421 --> 00:26:46,481
Every guy here'd
love to be you, Gaston

662
00:26:46,557 --> 00:26:49,856
Even when taking
your lumps

663
00:26:49,894 --> 00:26:52,795
There's no man in town
as admired as you

664
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,596
You're everyone's
favorite guy

665
00:26:56,634 --> 00:26:59,529
Everyone's awed and
inspired by you

666
00:26:59,696 --> 00:27:06,465
And it's not very hard
to see why

667
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:08,469
( women cooing )

668
00:27:08,571 --> 00:27:11,472
No... one's...

669
00:27:11,574 --> 00:27:12,939
Slick as Gaston

670
00:27:12,976 --> 00:27:14,841
No one's quick
as Gaston

671
00:27:14,878 --> 00:27:18,177
No one's neck's as incredibly
thick as Gaston

672
00:27:18,214 --> 00:27:21,945
For there's no man in town
half as manly

673
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:24,476
Perfect, a pure paragon

674
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:27,957
You can ask any Tom, Dick
or Stanley

675
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:29,481
And they'll tell you
whose team

676
00:27:29,592 --> 00:27:32,152
They prefer to be on

677
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:33,219
Ooh!

678
00:27:33,263 --> 00:27:37,461
No... one's...
been like Gaston

679
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,127
A kingpin like Gaston

680
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:41,137
No one's got a full cleft

681
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:42,695
In his chin
like Gaston

682
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:46,505
As a specimen, yes,
I'm intimidating

683
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:49,671
My, what a guy, that Gaston

684
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:51,202
Give five "hurrahs!"

685
00:27:51,247 --> 00:27:53,078
Give 12 "hip-hips!"

686
00:27:53,212 --> 00:27:57,911
Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips

687
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,477
No... one...

688
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,919
Fights like Gaston

689
00:28:02,955 --> 00:28:04,684
Douses lights like Gaston

690
00:28:04,723 --> 00:28:07,988
In a wrestling match,
nobody bites like Gaston

691
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:11,258
For there's no one
as burly and brawny

692
00:28:11,297 --> 00:28:14,664
As you see,
I've got biceps to spare

693
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,191
Not a bit of him
scraggly or scrawny

694
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:18,601
That's right

695
00:28:18,637 --> 00:28:21,868
And every last inch of me's
covered with hair

696
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:23,238
No one hits like Gaston

697
00:28:23,275 --> 00:28:24,708
Matches wits like Gaston

698
00:28:24,743 --> 00:28:28,873
In a spitting match,
nobody spits like Gaston

699
00:28:28,914 --> 00:28:31,246
I'm especially good
at expectorating

700
00:28:31,283 --> 00:28:32,215
Ptooey!

701
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:35,243
Ten points for Gaston!

702
00:28:35,287 --> 00:28:36,686
When I was a lad

703
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:38,690
I ate four dozen eggs

704
00:28:38,724 --> 00:28:41,818
Every morning
to help me get large

705
00:28:41,861 --> 00:28:43,226
And now
that I'm grown

706
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:45,025
I eat
five dozen eggs

707
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:51,003
So I'm roughly
the size of a barge

708
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:54,301
No... one...

709
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,808
Shoots like Gaston

710
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:57,805
Makes those beauts
like Gaston

711
00:28:57,843 --> 00:29:00,710
Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston

712
00:29:00,746 --> 00:29:04,944
I use antlers
in all of my decorating

713
00:29:04,983 --> 00:29:07,349
My, what a guy

714
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:11,880
Gaston!

715
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:12,913
( screaming )

716
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:16,656
( cheering )

717
00:29:17,596 --> 00:29:17,662
Help!

718
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:18,594
Help!

719
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,494
Someone help me!

720
00:29:19,564 --> 00:29:20,496
Maurice?

721
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:21,030
Please, please!

722
00:29:21,065 --> 00:29:22,293
I need your help.

723
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,459
He's got her...

724
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:25,162
He's got her locked
in the dungeon.

725
00:29:25,203 --> 00:29:26,170
Who?

726
00:29:26,204 --> 00:29:27,171
Belle. We must go.

727
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:29,196
N-Not a minute to lose.

728
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,298
Whoa!

729
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:31,603
Slow down, Maurice.

730
00:29:31,643 --> 00:29:33,634
Who's got Belle locked
in a dungeon?

731
00:29:33,678 --> 00:29:34,975
A beast!

732
00:29:35,013 --> 00:29:37,675
A horrible, monstrous
beast.

733
00:29:37,715 --> 00:29:40,309
( laughter )

734
00:29:41,286 --> 00:29:43,447
Is it a big beast?

735
00:29:43,488 --> 00:29:44,477
Huge!

736
00:29:44,522 --> 00:29:45,989
With a long ugly snout?

737
00:29:46,024 --> 00:29:47,150
Hideously ugly.

738
00:29:47,192 --> 00:29:48,819
And sharp,
cruel fangs?

739
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,918
Yes, yes.

740
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:51,428
Will you help me?

741
00:29:51,463 --> 00:29:52,521
All right,
old man.

742
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,892
We'll help you out.

743
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:54,899
You will?

744
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:55,894
Oh, thank you.

745
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,859
Thank you.
Thank you!

746
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:58,062
( grunting ):
Oh!

747
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,859
( grunting ):
Oh!

748
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,958
Crazy old Maurice.

749
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,060
He's always good
for a laugh.

750
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,129
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?

751
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:13,132
Crazy old Maurice... hmm.

752
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:17,238
Lefou, I'm afraid
I've been thinking

753
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,579
A dangerous pastime...

754
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,583
I know

755
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:23,245
But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father

756
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,052
And his sanity's
only so-so

757
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,581
Now the wheels
in my head

758
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,217
Have been turning

759
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:33,025
Since I looked at
that loony old man

760
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,932
See, I promised myself

761
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,126
I'd be married to Belle

762
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:41,126
And right now,
I'm evolving a plan

763
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:42,160
If I...

764
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:43,195
( whispering )

765
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,207
LEFOU:
Yes?

766
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:45,265
Then we... ( whispering )

767
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:46,298
No! Would she...?

768
00:30:46,343 --> 00:30:47,275
Guess!

769
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:48,369
Now I get it!

770
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:50,209
BOTH:
Let's go!

771
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:53,239
No... one...

772
00:30:53,283 --> 00:30:54,910
Plots like Gaston

773
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:56,817
Takes cheap shots
like Gaston

774
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:59,880
Plans to persecute
harmless crackpots like Gaston

775
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:05,418
TOWNSFOLK:
So his marriage
we soon will be celebrating

776
00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:07,987
My, what a guy!

777
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,196
Gaston!

778
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:18,740
Will no one help me?

779
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,767
( wind whistling )

780
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:24,575
( sobbing )

781
00:31:24,648 --> 00:31:26,946
( knock on door )

782
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:28,110
Who is it?

783
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,517
Mrs. Potts, dear.

784
00:31:30,988 --> 00:31:33,582
I thought you might
like a spot of tea.

785
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:35,592
But you're... you're a...

786
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:36,921
Ooh!

787
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,927
Careful.

788
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:38,893
This is impossible.

789
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:40,419
I know it is.

790
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:42,295
But here we are.

791
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:45,028
I told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't I?

792
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,435
All right, Chip,
now, that'll do.

793
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:48,495
Slowly now.

794
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,063
Don't spill.

795
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:51,734
Thank you.

796
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:54,437
Want to see me
do a trick?

797
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:55,604
( inhales )

798
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:56,840
MRS. POTTS:
Chip!

799
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,905
Oops. Sorry.

800
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:01,509
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

801
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,247
We all think so.

802
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:04,777
But I've lost my father

803
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,790
my dreams... everything.

804
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,416
Cheer up, child.

805
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,790
It'll turn out

806
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,818
all right
in the end.

807
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:13,090
You'll see.

808
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,290
Oh, listen to me.

809
00:32:14,331 --> 00:32:15,764
Jabbering on while
there's a supper

810
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,823
to get on the table.

811
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:18,835
Chip!

812
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:20,166
Bye.

813
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,832
Well, now, what shall we
dress you in for dinner?

814
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:25,364
Oh, let's see what I got
in my drawers.

815
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:27,934
Ooh! How embarrassing.

816
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:29,070
( nervous laughter )

817
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,102
( clears throat )

818
00:32:30,147 --> 00:32:31,774
Ah, here we are.

819
00:32:31,815 --> 00:32:33,248
You'll look ravishing

820
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:34,580
in this one.

821
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:36,209
That's very kind
of you, but...

822
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:37,749
I'm not going
to dinner.

823
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:40,444
Oh, but you must.

824
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:42,851
( sputtering )

825
00:32:42,887 --> 00:32:45,754
Dinner is served.

826
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,848
( snarling )

827
00:32:47,892 --> 00:32:49,587
What's taking so long?

828
00:32:49,627 --> 00:32:51,492
I told her to come down.

829
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:52,826
Why isn't she here yet?

830
00:32:52,863 --> 00:32:54,592
Oh, try to be
patient, sir.

831
00:32:54,632 --> 00:32:56,463
The girl has
lost her father

832
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,627
and her freedom,
all in one day.

833
00:32:58,702 --> 00:32:59,999
Master, have you thought

834
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:03,029
that perhaps this girl could
be the one to break the spell?

835
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:04,506
Of course I have.

836
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:05,873
I'm not a fool.

837
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,241
Good!

838
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,042
So, you fall in love with her,
she falls in love with you

839
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,378
and poof!
The spell is broken.

840
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:14,384
We'll be human again
by midnight.

841
00:33:14,418 --> 00:33:16,215
Ooh, it's not
that easy, Lumiere.

842
00:33:16,253 --> 00:33:17,515
These things take time.

843
00:33:17,555 --> 00:33:19,580
But the rose has already
begun to wilt.

844
00:33:19,657 --> 00:33:21,591
Oh, it's no use.

845
00:33:21,692 --> 00:33:24,456
She's so beautiful, and I'm...

846
00:33:24,495 --> 00:33:25,587
Well, look at me!

847
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:30,801
Oh, you must help her
to see past all that.

848
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:32,233
I don't know how.

849
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:33,600
Well, you can start

850
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:35,263
by making yourself
more presentable.

851
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:36,500
Straighten up.

852
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,235
Try to act like
a gentleman.

853
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:39,742
Ah, yes.
When she comes in

854
00:33:39,777 --> 00:33:41,745
give her a dashing,
debonair smile.

855
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:43,474
Come, come,
show me the smile.

856
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:46,443
But don't frighten
the poor girl.

857
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,212
Impress her
with your rapier wit.

858
00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:50,049
But be gentle.

859
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:51,577
Shower her
with compliments.

860
00:33:51,622 --> 00:33:52,611
But be sincere.

861
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:53,623
And above all...

862
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,488
BOTH:
You must control your temper!

863
00:33:55,526 --> 00:33:56,618
( doorknob rattling )

864
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,763
Here she is!

865
00:33:59,763 --> 00:34:01,390
Good evening.

866
00:34:01,432 --> 00:34:04,534
Well, where is she?

867
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:05,523
Who? Oh.

868
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:06,557
( giggles )

869
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,068
The girl, yes.

870
00:34:08,104 --> 00:34:09,332
The... girl.

871
00:34:09,372 --> 00:34:12,569
Well, actually,
she's in the process of...

872
00:34:12,642 --> 00:34:16,237
Circumstances being
what they are...

873
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:17,803
She's not coming.

874
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,008
What?!

875
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:21,414
But, your grace...!

876
00:34:21,451 --> 00:34:23,578
Your eminence!

877
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,677
( yelling )

878
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,158
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner!

879
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,524
BELLE:
I'm not hungry.

880
00:34:31,561 --> 00:34:33,529
You come out, or I'll...

881
00:34:33,563 --> 00:34:35,360
I'll... I'll break down
the door!

882
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:36,558
Master...

883
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,124
I could be wrong,
but that may not be

884
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:42,103
the best way
to win the girl's affections.

885
00:34:42,138 --> 00:34:45,596
Please attempt
to be a gentleman.

886
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,541
But she is being so difficult.

887
00:34:48,578 --> 00:34:50,170
Gently, gently.

888
00:34:52,482 --> 00:34:53,915
Will you come down to dinner?

889
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,144
No.

890
00:34:55,184 --> 00:34:56,446
Hmm?

891
00:34:56,486 --> 00:34:57,578
Ah, ah, ah!

892
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,882
Suave, genteel.

893
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:01,856
It would give me
great pleasure

894
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,950
if you would join
me for dinner.

895
00:35:03,993 --> 00:35:05,085
( clearing throat )

896
00:35:05,128 --> 00:35:06,288
( mumbling ):
We say please.

897
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:07,887
Please.

898
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:08,726
No, thank you!

899
00:35:08,764 --> 00:35:10,288
You can't stay in there forever!

900
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:11,664
Yes, I can.

901
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:15,398
Fine. Then go ahead
and starve!

902
00:35:15,438 --> 00:35:17,702
If she doesn't eat with me

903
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,265
then she doesn't eat at all.

904
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:21,298
( roaring )

905
00:35:21,344 --> 00:35:23,244
( door slams )

906
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:24,746
Oh, dear.

907
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,445
That didn't go very well
at all, did it?

908
00:35:26,611 --> 00:35:29,375
Lumiere, stand watch
at the door

909
00:35:29,414 --> 00:35:31,245
and inform me at once

910
00:35:31,283 --> 00:35:33,012
if there is
the slightest change.

911
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:34,951
You can count on me,
mon capitan.

912
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:37,420
Well, we might as well
go downstairs

913
00:35:37,456 --> 00:35:40,448
and start cleaning up.

914
00:35:40,492 --> 00:35:44,121
I ask nicely,
but she refuses.

915
00:35:44,162 --> 00:35:46,892
Well, what does
she want me to do... beg?

916
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:49,096
Show me the girl.

917
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:53,768
Well, the master's
really not so bad

918
00:35:53,805 --> 00:35:55,067
once you get
to know him.

919
00:35:55,107 --> 00:35:56,768
Why don't you
give him a chance?

920
00:35:56,808 --> 00:35:58,469
I don't want to
get to know him.

921
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,039
I don't want to
have anything

922
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,768
to do with him!

923
00:36:01,807 --> 00:36:03,604
( groans )

924
00:36:03,642 --> 00:36:05,735
I'm just fooling myself.

925
00:36:05,778 --> 00:36:08,804
She'll never see me
as anything...

926
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:11,543
but a monster.

927
00:36:15,554 --> 00:36:18,022
It's hopeless.

928
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,332
GIRL:
Oh, no!

929
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:37,501
LUMIERE:
Oh, yes!

930
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:38,567
Oh, no!

931
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,804
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

932
00:36:39,845 --> 00:36:42,143
I've been burned
by you before.

933
00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:43,148
( chuckling )

934
00:36:43,182 --> 00:36:44,376
( gasps )

935
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:47,810
Zut, alors!
She has emerged!

936
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:54,052
Come on, Chip,
into the cupboard

937
00:36:54,093 --> 00:36:55,590
with your brothers
and sisters.

938
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:57,349
( yawning )

939
00:36:57,392 --> 00:36:59,223
But I'm not sleepy.

940
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:00,888
Yes, you are.

941
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:03,557
No, I'm not.

942
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:05,725
I work and I slave all
day long and for what?

943
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:08,861
A culinary masterpiece
gone to waste.

944
00:37:08,904 --> 00:37:10,132
Oh, stop your grousing.

945
00:37:10,172 --> 00:37:12,163
It's been a long night
for all of us.

946
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:15,108
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

947
00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:16,906
After all,
he did say please.

948
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:18,913
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper

949
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,471
he'll never break...

950
00:37:20,515 --> 00:37:22,312
Splendid to see you
out and about, Mademoiselle.

951
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,343
I am Cogsworth,
head of the household.

952
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:29,654
This is Lumiere.

953
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:31,921
Enchante, cherie.

954
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,393
If there's...
Stop that!

955
00:37:33,428 --> 00:37:34,895
...anything we...
Please!

956
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,398
can do to make your
stay more comfortable.

957
00:37:37,432 --> 00:37:38,456
Ow!

958
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,831
I am a little hungry.

959
00:37:39,868 --> 00:37:40,835
You are?

960
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:42,530
Hear that?
She's hungry.

961
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:43,538
Stoke the fire.

962
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:44,300
Break out
the silver.

963
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:45,806
Wake the china.

964
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:48,366
Remember what the master said.

965
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,468
Oh, pishposh.

966
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:51,672
I'm not about to let
the poor child go hungry.

967
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:52,872
All right, fine.

968
00:37:52,914 --> 00:37:54,677
Glass of water, crust
of bread, and then...

969
00:37:54,783 --> 00:37:57,185
Cogsworth, I am
surprised at you.

970
00:37:57,185 --> 00:37:59,881
She is not a prisoner.
She's our guest.

971
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:02,048
We must make her
feel welcome here.

972
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,785
Right this way,
Mademoiselle.

973
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:04,917
Well, keep it down.

974
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,951
If the master finds out
about this

975
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,189
it will be
our necks.

976
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,528
Of course, of course.

977
00:38:10,565 --> 00:38:13,363
But what is dinner
without a little music?

978
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:15,301
Music?

979
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:18,135
Ma chere
mademoiselle.

980
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:22,371
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

981
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,537
that we welcome you tonight.

982
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:25,637
And now

983
00:38:25,741 --> 00:38:27,106
we invite you
to relax.

984
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:28,473
Let us
pull up a chair

985
00:38:28,511 --> 00:38:31,173
as the dining room
proudly presents...

986
00:38:31,213 --> 00:38:33,204
your dinner.

987
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:37,579
Be... our... guest

988
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,053
Be our guest

989
00:38:39,088 --> 00:38:42,080
Put our service
to the test

990
00:38:42,124 --> 00:38:43,955
Tie your napkin 'round
your neck, cherie

991
00:38:43,993 --> 00:38:46,621
And we provide the rest

992
00:38:46,662 --> 00:38:49,187
Soup du jour,
Hot hors d'oeuvres

993
00:38:49,231 --> 00:38:51,096
Why, we only live
to serve

994
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:52,532
Try the gray stuff

995
00:38:52,568 --> 00:38:53,694
It's delicious

996
00:38:53,736 --> 00:38:56,000
Don't believe me,
ask the dishes

997
00:38:56,038 --> 00:38:58,199
They can sing,
they can dance

998
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,572
After all, Miss,
this is France

999
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:04,636
And a dinner here
is never second best

1000
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:07,181
Go on, unfold your menu

1001
00:39:07,216 --> 00:39:09,343
Take a glance and then

1002
00:39:09,385 --> 00:39:10,374
You'll be our guest

1003
00:39:10,419 --> 00:39:11,613
Oui, our guest

1004
00:39:11,654 --> 00:39:13,645
Be our guest

1005
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:16,021
Beef ragout,
cheese souffle

1006
00:39:16,058 --> 00:39:18,026
Pie and pudding
en flambe

1007
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,119
We'll prepare and serve
with flair

1008
00:39:20,162 --> 00:39:22,289
A culinary cabaret

1009
00:39:22,331 --> 00:39:24,526
You're alone
and you're scared

1010
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:26,660
But the banquet's
all prepared

1011
00:39:26,735 --> 00:39:28,669
No one's gloomy
or complaining

1012
00:39:28,704 --> 00:39:30,831
While the flatware's
entertaining

1013
00:39:30,873 --> 00:39:33,068
We tell jokes,
I do tricks

1014
00:39:33,108 --> 00:39:35,372
With my fellow candlesticks

1015
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:39,370
And it's all in perfect taste,
that you can bet

1016
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:41,474
Come on and lift your glass

1017
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:43,178
You've won your own
free pass

1018
00:39:43,218 --> 00:39:44,310
To be our guest--

1019
00:39:44,353 --> 00:39:45,820
If you're stressed

1020
00:39:45,854 --> 00:39:47,981
It's fine dining
we suggest--

1021
00:39:48,023 --> 00:39:50,389
Be our guest,
be our guest

1022
00:39:50,426 --> 00:39:52,223
Be our guest!

1023
00:39:52,261 --> 00:39:55,560
( mournfully ):
Life is so unnerving

1024
00:39:55,598 --> 00:39:58,624
For a servant
who's not serving

1025
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:01,898
He's not whole
without a soul to wait upon

1026
00:40:01,937 --> 00:40:03,700
Get off!

1027
00:40:03,806 --> 00:40:07,242
- ( sleigh bells jingling )
- Ah, those good old days
when we were useful

1028
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:08,800
Huh?

1029
00:40:08,844 --> 00:40:10,835
Suddenly, those good
old days are gone

1030
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:13,712
( groans ):
Oh!

1031
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:15,716
Ten years
we've been rusting

1032
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:18,049
Needing so much more
than dusting

1033
00:40:18,087 --> 00:40:20,112
Needing exercise

1034
00:40:20,155 --> 00:40:21,713
A chance
to use our skills

1035
00:40:21,757 --> 00:40:23,190
( howling )

1036
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:26,956
Most days we just
lay around the castle

1037
00:40:26,996 --> 00:40:27,985
( grunting )

1038
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,463
Flabby, fat and lazy

1039
00:40:29,498 --> 00:40:31,625
You walked in
and oops-a-daisy!

1040
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:33,532
It's a guest, it's a guest!

1041
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:35,366
Sakes alive,
well, I'll be blessed

1042
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:37,429
Wine's been poured,
And thank the lord

1043
00:40:37,473 --> 00:40:39,373
I've had the napkins
freshly pressed

1044
00:40:39,408 --> 00:40:41,740
With dessert,
she'll want tea

1045
00:40:41,844 --> 00:40:43,334
And, my dear,
that's fine with me

1046
00:40:43,379 --> 00:40:45,506
While the cups
do their soft-shoeing

1047
00:40:45,547 --> 00:40:47,572
I'll be bubbling,
I'll be brewing

1048
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,379
I'll get warm,
piping hot

1049
00:40:49,418 --> 00:40:51,511
Heaven's sake,
is that a spot?

1050
00:40:51,553 --> 00:40:54,283
Clean it up, we want
the company impressed

1051
00:40:54,323 --> 00:40:56,484
We've got a lot to do

1052
00:40:56,525 --> 00:40:58,356
Is it one lump or two?

1053
00:40:58,394 --> 00:40:59,122
For you, our guest

1054
00:40:59,161 --> 00:41:00,287
She's our guest

1055
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:01,557
She's our guest

1056
00:41:01,597 --> 00:41:03,121
She's our guest

1057
00:41:03,165 --> 00:41:05,827
People, fun's over,
over here, line up...

1058
00:41:05,868 --> 00:41:07,233
( screams )

1059
00:41:07,269 --> 00:41:09,169
It's ten years since
we've had anybody here

1060
00:41:09,204 --> 00:41:10,193
And we're obsessed

1061
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:12,469
With your meal,
with your ease

1062
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:14,339
Yes, indeed,
we aim to please

1063
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:16,708
While the candlelight's
still glowing

1064
00:41:16,812 --> 00:41:21,146
Let us help you,
we'll keep going

1065
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:25,381
Course... by... course

1066
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:27,480
One by one

1067
00:41:27,523 --> 00:41:30,185
Till you shout,
"Enough, I'm done!"

1068
00:41:30,225 --> 00:41:34,559
Then we'll sing you
off to sleep as you digest

1069
00:41:34,596 --> 00:41:36,689
Tonight you'll prop
your feet up

1070
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:38,290
But for now, let's eat up

1071
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:42,463
Be our guest,
be our guest

1072
00:41:42,504 --> 00:41:44,335
Be our guest

1073
00:41:44,373 --> 00:41:52,838
Please be our guest!

1074
00:41:55,117 --> 00:41:56,243
Bravo!

1075
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:57,616
That was wonderful.

1076
00:41:57,653 --> 00:41:58,745
Thank you.

1077
00:41:58,787 --> 00:42:00,948
Thank you, Mademoiselle.

1078
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:02,889
Good show, wasn't it?

1079
00:42:02,925 --> 00:42:04,358
Yes, everyone.

1080
00:42:04,393 --> 00:42:07,692
My goodness, look at the time.

1081
00:42:07,763 --> 00:42:09,628
Now it's off to bed,
off to bed.

1082
00:42:09,665 --> 00:42:12,190
Oh, I couldn't possibly
go to bed now.

1083
00:42:12,234 --> 00:42:14,259
It's my first time
in an enchanted castle.

1084
00:42:14,303 --> 00:42:15,361
Enchanted!

1085
00:42:15,404 --> 00:42:16,393
( laughing )

1086
00:42:16,438 --> 00:42:17,496
Who said anything

1087
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:19,404
about the castle
being enchanted?

1088
00:42:19,441 --> 00:42:21,466
It was you, wasn't it?

1089
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,273
I figured it out for myself.

1090
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:26,139
( grunting and groaning )

1091
00:42:26,178 --> 00:42:28,408
I'd like to look around,
if that's all right.

1092
00:42:28,447 --> 00:42:30,005
Oh, would you
like a tour?

1093
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,709
Wait a second,
wait a second.

1094
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,547
I'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

1095
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:35,917
We can't let her
go poking around

1096
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:38,980
in certain places, if
you know what I mean.

1097
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:40,491
Perhaps you'd like
to take me.

1098
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:41,924
I'm sure you know
everything

1099
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,723
there is to know
about the castle.

1100
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:46,731
Oh, well, actually, l, uh...

1101
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:48,995
Yes, I do.

1102
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:50,194
As you can see

1103
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:53,102
the pseudo-facade
was stripped away

1104
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:55,436
to reveal a minimalist
rococo design.

1105
00:42:55,474 --> 00:42:58,637
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

1106
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:00,042
This is yet another example

1107
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,103
of the late neoclassic
baroque period.

1108
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:03,512
and, as I always say

1109
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:05,709
if it's not baroque,
don't fix it.

1110
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:07,649
( chuckling )

1111
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:09,415
Uh, where was I?

1112
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:12,714
As you were.

1113
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:15,224
Now, then, if I may
draw your attention

1114
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,558
to the flying buttresses
above the...

1115
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,086
Uh, Mademoiselle?

1116
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:21,859
( barking )

1117
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:26,394
What's up there?

1118
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:27,405
Where? There?
Oh, nothing.

1119
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:28,736
Absolutely nothing
of interest at all

1120
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,137
in the west wing.

1121
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,166
Dusty, dull, very boring.

1122
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,735
Ah, so that's the west wing.

1123
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,542
Nice going.

1124
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:39,550
I wonder what
he's hiding up there?

1125
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:40,551
Hiding?

1126
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:42,052
The master is
hiding nothing.

1127
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:43,884
Then it wouldn't
be forbidden.

1128
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:46,356
Perhaps, uh,
Mademoiselle would like to

1129
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:48,086
uh-uh, uh...
see something else.

1130
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,856
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

1131
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:51,885
maybe later.

1132
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,329
Th-The gardens or-or

1133
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:55,299
the-the-the-the
library, perhaps.

1134
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,561
You have a library?

1135
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:58,193
( laughs ):
Yes, oh, indeed.

1136
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,328
With books.

1137
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:00,565
Scads of books!

1138
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:01,629
Mountains of books!

1139
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:02,662
Forests of books!

1140
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:03,696
- Cascades!
- Longboats!

1141
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:04,799
Swamps of books!

1142
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:06,708
COGSWORTH:
More books than you'll

1143
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:08,837
ever be able
to read in a lifetime.

1144
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,371
Books on every subject ever
studied, by every author

1145
00:44:11,446 --> 00:44:13,437
who ever set pen
to paper.

1146
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:44,073
( grunts )

1147
00:44:44,112 --> 00:44:47,138
( creaking )

1148
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:06,766
Oh!

1149
00:45:13,008 --> 00:45:14,498
( gasps )

1150
00:45:42,404 --> 00:45:44,038
( gasps )

1151
00:45:46,307 --> 00:45:47,274
( growls )

1152
00:45:47,308 --> 00:45:49,105
( gasps )

1153
00:45:49,144 --> 00:45:51,305
( snarling )

1154
00:45:52,447 --> 00:45:54,472
Why did you come here?

1155
00:45:54,516 --> 00:45:56,450
I'm... I'm sorry.

1156
00:45:56,484 --> 00:45:59,112
I warned you never
to come here.

1157
00:45:59,154 --> 00:46:00,348
I didn't mean any harm.

1158
00:46:00,388 --> 00:46:03,118
Do you realize
what you could have done?!

1159
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:05,252
Please, stop.

1160
00:46:05,293 --> 00:46:07,090
Get out!

1161
00:46:07,128 --> 00:46:08,857
( gasping ):
No!

1162
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:12,833
( echoing ):
Get... out!

1163
00:46:24,379 --> 00:46:25,505
Where are you going?

1164
00:46:25,547 --> 00:46:26,844
Promise or no promise

1165
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:28,644
I can't stay here
another minute.

1166
00:46:28,683 --> 00:46:31,015
Oh, no, wait,
please.

1167
00:46:31,052 --> 00:46:32,144
Please wait.

1168
00:46:32,187 --> 00:46:34,212
( neighing )

1169
00:46:47,902 --> 00:46:49,199
( gasping )

1170
00:46:49,237 --> 00:46:51,762
( snarling )

1171
00:47:03,585 --> 00:47:05,644
( terrified neighing )

1172
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:12,150
Oh!

1173
00:47:23,571 --> 00:47:24,936
( screams )

1174
00:47:24,973 --> 00:47:26,497
( neighing )

1175
00:47:28,142 --> 00:47:30,508
( barking and snarling )

1176
00:47:38,586 --> 00:47:39,917
( growling )

1177
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:44,350
Oh!

1178
00:47:47,295 --> 00:47:48,091
( screams )

1179
00:47:50,064 --> 00:47:51,088
( growling )

1180
00:47:57,438 --> 00:47:59,065
( barking )

1181
00:48:02,744 --> 00:48:06,305
( fierce growling )

1182
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:16,017
( whimpering )

1183
00:48:23,298 --> 00:48:26,028
( grunts )

1184
00:48:27,735 --> 00:48:28,724
( nickering )

1185
00:48:36,877 --> 00:48:39,277
( wind whistling )

1186
00:48:57,664 --> 00:48:59,529
Here now.

1187
00:48:59,566 --> 00:49:01,033
Oh, don't do that.

1188
00:49:01,067 --> 00:49:02,694
( growling )

1189
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:07,138
Just hold still.

1190
00:49:07,173 --> 00:49:08,470
( roaring )

1191
00:49:08,508 --> 00:49:09,566
That hurts!

1192
00:49:09,643 --> 00:49:11,577
If you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

1193
00:49:11,678 --> 00:49:13,077
Well, if you hadn't
have run away

1194
00:49:13,113 --> 00:49:14,239
this wouldn't
have happened!

1195
00:49:14,281 --> 00:49:17,341
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away!

1196
00:49:17,384 --> 00:49:20,285
Well, you shouldn't have
been in the west wing!

1197
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,584
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!

1198
00:49:24,658 --> 00:49:27,092
Now hold still.

1199
00:49:27,127 --> 00:49:28,992
This might sting a little.

1200
00:49:29,029 --> 00:49:30,087
Hmm?

1201
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,495
( groaning )

1202
00:49:31,531 --> 00:49:34,830
By the way, thank you.

1203
00:49:34,868 --> 00:49:36,768
For saving my life.

1204
00:49:40,473 --> 00:49:43,135
You're welcome.

1205
00:49:49,983 --> 00:49:51,974
I don't usually
leave the asylum

1206
00:49:52,018 --> 00:49:53,610
in the middle
of the night

1207
00:49:53,653 --> 00:49:56,816
but he said you'd make it
worth my while.

1208
00:49:56,856 --> 00:49:58,016
( coins clinking )

1209
00:49:58,058 --> 00:49:59,548
Ah.

1210
00:49:59,626 --> 00:50:00,923
I'm listening.

1211
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,393
It's like this.

1212
00:50:02,429 --> 00:50:05,557
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle

1213
00:50:05,598 --> 00:50:08,567
but she needs a little...
persuasion.

1214
00:50:08,668 --> 00:50:09,794
( snickering )

1215
00:50:09,836 --> 00:50:11,997
Turned him down flat.

1216
00:50:12,038 --> 00:50:13,767
Everyone knows
her father's a lunatic.

1217
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:14,796
He was in here tonight

1218
00:50:14,841 --> 00:50:17,674
raving about a beast
in a castle.

1219
00:50:17,711 --> 00:50:19,406
Maurice is harmless.

1220
00:50:19,446 --> 00:50:22,108
The point is,
Belle would do anything

1221
00:50:22,148 --> 00:50:24,548
to keep him
from being locked up.

1222
00:50:24,584 --> 00:50:26,381
( laughs )

1223
00:50:26,419 --> 00:50:27,883
Yeah. Even marry him.

1224
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:31,813
So you want me

1225
00:50:31,854 --> 00:50:33,889
to throw her father
into the asylum

1226
00:50:34,089 --> 00:50:36,853
unless she agrees
to marry you.

1227
00:50:36,892 --> 00:50:39,156
Oh, that is despicable.

1228
00:50:39,194 --> 00:50:40,491
( laughs )

1229
00:50:40,529 --> 00:50:41,894
I love it!

1230
00:50:43,568 --> 00:50:45,832
MAURICE:
If no one will help me

1231
00:50:45,937 --> 00:50:47,564
then I'll go back alone.

1232
00:50:47,605 --> 00:50:49,334
Yes, is that everything?

1233
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:51,205
I don't care
what it takes.

1234
00:50:51,242 --> 00:50:53,767
I'll find that castle,
and somehow

1235
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:55,642
I'll get her out of there.

1236
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,614
( wind howling )

1237
00:50:59,984 --> 00:51:01,349
( pounding )

1238
00:51:01,386 --> 00:51:03,081
Belle? Maurice?

1239
00:51:03,121 --> 00:51:04,053
Oh, well.

1240
00:51:04,088 --> 00:51:05,055
( laughs )

1241
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:06,886
I guess it's not going
to work after all.

1242
00:51:06,925 --> 00:51:09,393
They have to come
back sometime.

1243
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:13,056
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

1244
00:51:13,097 --> 00:51:14,428
Lefou...

1245
00:51:14,465 --> 00:51:17,491
don't move
from that spot

1246
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:19,298
until Belle and
her father come home.

1247
00:51:19,337 --> 00:51:21,532
But, but, I...

1248
00:51:21,573 --> 00:51:22,904
( grunting )

1249
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:24,875
Aw, nuts.

1250
00:51:36,721 --> 00:51:38,018
( barking )

1251
00:51:43,027 --> 00:51:44,517
( laughing )

1252
00:51:47,665 --> 00:51:52,125
I've never felt this way
about anyone.

1253
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:54,502
I want to do something for her.

1254
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:56,097
But what?

1255
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,199
Well, there's the usual things.

1256
00:51:58,243 --> 00:51:59,540
Flowers, chocolates.

1257
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:01,374
Promises you don't intend
to keep.

1258
00:52:01,412 --> 00:52:03,209
Ah, no, no.

1259
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:05,614
It has to be something
very special.

1260
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,914
Something that sparks
her interest.

1261
00:52:07,952 --> 00:52:09,214
Wait a minute!

1262
00:52:12,023 --> 00:52:16,016
Belle, there's something
I want to show you.

1263
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:20,121
But first, you have
to close your eyes.

1264
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:23,690
It's a surprise.

1265
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:29,228
( door creaks )

1266
00:52:34,879 --> 00:52:36,369
Can I open them?

1267
00:52:36,414 --> 00:52:38,405
No, no. Not yet.

1268
00:52:38,449 --> 00:52:41,111
Wait here.

1269
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,723
Now can I open them?

1270
00:52:46,758 --> 00:52:48,419
All right.

1271
00:52:48,459 --> 00:52:49,687
Now.

1272
00:52:49,727 --> 00:52:52,594
( gasps )

1273
00:52:58,336 --> 00:53:00,770
I can't believe it!

1274
00:53:00,872 --> 00:53:03,067
I've never seen
so many books in all my life!

1275
00:53:03,107 --> 00:53:04,768
You-You like it?

1276
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:06,470
It's wonderful!

1277
00:53:06,511 --> 00:53:08,445
Then it's yours.

1278
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,379
Oh, thank you
so much.

1279
00:53:10,415 --> 00:53:12,110
Oh, would you
look at that!

1280
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,118
I knew it would work.

1281
00:53:14,152 --> 00:53:15,312
What?
What worked?

1282
00:53:15,353 --> 00:53:18,117
It's very
encouraging.

1283
00:53:18,156 --> 00:53:19,783
Isn't this exciting?

1284
00:53:19,891 --> 00:53:21,256
I didn't see anything.

1285
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:22,452
Come along, Chip.

1286
00:53:22,493 --> 00:53:24,222
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

1287
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:25,689
But what are
they talking about?

1288
00:53:25,725 --> 00:53:27,090
What's going on?
Come on, Mom.

1289
00:53:35,602 --> 00:53:36,626
( gasps )

1290
00:53:36,669 --> 00:53:38,694
( slurping )

1291
00:53:52,952 --> 00:53:54,476
( slurping )

1292
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,511
( giggling )

1293
00:54:14,507 --> 00:54:16,566
BELLE:
There's something sweet

1294
00:54:16,609 --> 00:54:18,270
And almost kind

1295
00:54:18,311 --> 00:54:19,539
But he was mean

1296
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:21,911
And he was coarse
and unrefined

1297
00:54:21,948 --> 00:54:25,941
And now he's dear,
and so unsure

1298
00:54:25,985 --> 00:54:28,613
I wonder why I didn't see it
there before

1299
00:54:33,493 --> 00:54:36,018
( birds chirping )

1300
00:54:43,169 --> 00:54:45,433
BEAST:
She glanced this way

1301
00:54:45,471 --> 00:54:47,029
I thought I saw

1302
00:54:47,073 --> 00:54:48,665
And when we touched

1303
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:50,801
She didn't shudder
at my paw

1304
00:54:50,843 --> 00:54:52,504
No, it can't be

1305
00:54:52,545 --> 00:54:54,604
I'll just ignore

1306
00:54:54,647 --> 00:54:58,640
But then she's never looked
at me that way before

1307
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:07,284
BELLE:
New and a bit alarming

1308
00:55:07,326 --> 00:55:15,791
Who'd have ever thought
that this could be?

1309
00:55:15,835 --> 00:55:22,604
True that he's no
Prince Charming

1310
00:55:22,642 --> 00:55:25,236
But there's something
in him

1311
00:55:25,278 --> 00:55:30,773
That I simply didn't see...

1312
00:55:30,817 --> 00:55:31,977
Well, who'd
have thought?

1313
00:55:32,018 --> 00:55:32,985
Well, bless my soul

1314
00:55:33,019 --> 00:55:34,145
Well, who'd
have known?

1315
00:55:34,187 --> 00:55:35,119
Well, who indeed?

1316
00:55:35,154 --> 00:55:36,212
And who'd
have guessed

1317
00:55:36,255 --> 00:55:37,688
They'd come together
on their own?

1318
00:55:37,724 --> 00:55:38,656
It's so peculiar

1319
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:39,658
We'll wait and see

1320
00:55:39,692 --> 00:55:42,525
A few days more

1321
00:55:42,562 --> 00:55:46,999
There may be something there
that wasn't there before...

1322
00:55:47,033 --> 00:55:48,830
You know,
perhaps there is

1323
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:52,029
Something there
that wasn't there before

1324
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:53,800
What?

1325
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,298
There may be something there
that wasn't there before.

1326
00:55:57,343 --> 00:55:58,901
What's there, Mama?

1327
00:55:58,945 --> 00:56:00,310
Shh!

1328
00:56:00,346 --> 00:56:01,973
I'll tell you
when you're older.

1329
00:56:02,014 --> 00:56:04,005
( kisses )

1330
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:05,282
Right, then!

1331
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:07,115
You all know why we're here.

1332
00:56:07,153 --> 00:56:10,680
We have exactly 12 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds

1333
00:56:10,723 --> 00:56:12,588
to create the most magical

1334
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:15,389
spontaneous, romantic atmosphere
known to man or beast.

1335
00:56:15,428 --> 00:56:16,656
( laughs )

1336
00:56:16,696 --> 00:56:18,061
"Or beast..."

1337
00:56:18,097 --> 00:56:20,691
( cricket chirping quietly )

1338
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:22,496
Right.

1339
00:56:22,535 --> 00:56:23,968
Need I remind you

1340
00:56:24,003 --> 00:56:27,632
that if the last petal falls
from this rose

1341
00:56:27,673 --> 00:56:28,901
the spell will never be...

1342
00:56:28,941 --> 00:56:30,806
broken!

1343
00:56:30,843 --> 00:56:32,333
Very well.

1344
00:56:32,378 --> 00:56:34,369
You all know your assignments.

1345
00:56:34,413 --> 00:56:36,313
Half of you to the west wing.

1346
00:56:36,349 --> 00:56:38,214
Half of you to the east wing.

1347
00:56:38,251 --> 00:56:40,276
The rest of you, come with me.

1348
00:56:42,622 --> 00:56:43,816
( barking )

1349
00:56:43,856 --> 00:56:44,823
( yells )

1350
00:56:44,857 --> 00:56:46,324
Oh, lighten up, Cogsworth

1351
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:48,327
and let nature take its course.

1352
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:51,057
It's obvious there's
a spark between them.

1353
00:56:51,097 --> 00:56:55,033
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames.

1354
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:56,869
You know... a little.

1355
00:56:56,869 --> 00:56:58,097
Besides, they must fall in love

1356
00:56:58,137 --> 00:56:59,934
tonight if we ever expect
to be human again.

1357
00:56:59,972 --> 00:57:01,405
Ah, human again.

1358
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,964
Human again.

1359
00:57:03,008 --> 00:57:06,034
Yes, think
what that means.

1360
00:57:06,078 --> 00:57:08,911
( bells tolling )

1361
00:57:08,947 --> 00:57:11,541
I'll be cooking again

1362
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:13,483
Be good looking again

1363
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:17,319
With a mademoiselle
on each arm

1364
00:57:17,356 --> 00:57:20,018
When I'm human again

1365
00:57:20,059 --> 00:57:21,720
Only human again

1366
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,252
Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm

1367
00:57:25,297 --> 00:57:27,026
I'll be courting again

1368
00:57:27,066 --> 00:57:28,966
Chic and sporting again

1369
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:31,970
Which should cause
several husbands alarm

1370
00:57:32,004 --> 00:57:34,666
Ha, ha!
I'll hop down off this shelf

1371
00:57:34,706 --> 00:57:36,571
And tout de suite be myself

1372
00:57:36,608 --> 00:57:39,668
I can't wait
to be human again

1373
00:57:41,647 --> 00:57:43,808
When we're human again

1374
00:57:43,882 --> 00:57:45,679
Only human again

1375
00:57:45,717 --> 00:57:48,618
When we're knickknacks
and whatnots no more

1376
00:57:48,654 --> 00:57:53,489
When we're human again,
good and human again

1377
00:57:53,525 --> 00:57:56,085
Oh, cherie,
won't it all be top drawer?

1378
00:57:56,128 --> 00:57:58,119
I'll wear lipstick and rouge

1379
00:57:58,163 --> 00:57:59,494
And I won't be so huge

1380
00:57:59,531 --> 00:58:03,160
Why, I'll easily fit
through that door

1381
00:58:03,202 --> 00:58:05,067
I'll exude savoir faire

1382
00:58:05,104 --> 00:58:07,072
I'll wear gowns,
I'll have hair

1383
00:58:07,106 --> 00:58:10,234
It's my prayer
to be human again

1384
00:58:10,275 --> 00:58:13,005
( crashing )

1385
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,972
When we're human again

1386
00:58:17,015 --> 00:58:18,880
Only human again

1387
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:22,250
When the world once more
starts making sense

1388
00:58:22,287 --> 00:58:23,914
I'll unwind, for a change

1389
00:58:23,956 --> 00:58:25,514
Really? That'd be strange

1390
00:58:25,557 --> 00:58:28,788
Can I help it
if I'm t-t-tense?

1391
00:58:28,827 --> 00:58:30,294
In a shack by the sea

1392
00:58:30,329 --> 00:58:32,092
I'll sit back, sipping tea

1393
00:58:32,131 --> 00:58:35,464
Let my early
retirement commence

1394
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:37,196
Far from fools made of wax

1395
00:58:37,236 --> 00:58:40,933
I'll get down to brass tacks
and relax!

1396
00:58:40,973 --> 00:58:44,704
When I'm human again

1397
00:58:44,743 --> 00:58:48,235
So sweep the dust
from the floor

1398
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,807
Let's let some light
in the room

1399
00:58:51,884 --> 00:58:53,511
I can feel, I can tell

1400
00:58:53,552 --> 00:58:56,578
Someone might break the spell
any day now

1401
00:58:56,622 --> 00:58:58,283
( barking )

1402
00:58:58,323 --> 00:59:01,781
Shine up the brass
on the door

1403
00:59:01,827 --> 00:59:04,660
Alert the dust pail
and broom

1404
00:59:04,696 --> 00:59:06,755
If it all goes as planned

1405
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:12,168
Our time may be at hand
any day now

1406
00:59:12,204 --> 00:59:15,571
Open the shutters,
and let in some air

1407
00:59:15,607 --> 00:59:19,566
Put these here,
and put those over there

1408
00:59:19,611 --> 00:59:23,012
Sweep up the years
of sadness and tears

1409
00:59:23,048 --> 00:59:25,744
And throw them away

1410
00:59:25,784 --> 00:59:27,547
( clears throat )

1411
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:34,620
We'll be human again

1412
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,821
Only human again

1413
00:59:36,862 --> 00:59:39,558
When the girl
finally sets us all free

1414
00:59:39,598 --> 00:59:42,158
Cheeks a-blooming again

1415
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:44,066
We're assuming again

1416
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:47,071
We'll resume our
long lost joie de vivre

1417
00:59:47,105 --> 00:59:48,299
We'll be playing again

1418
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:50,638
Holidaying again

1419
00:59:50,676 --> 00:59:52,701
And we're praying
it's ASAP

1420
00:59:52,744 --> 00:59:53,836
( cat snarls )

1421
00:59:53,879 --> 00:59:55,870
We will push, we will shove

1422
00:59:55,981 --> 00:59:57,812
They will both fall in love

1423
00:59:57,916 --> 01:00:01,716
And we'll finally
be human again...

1424
01:00:03,355 --> 01:00:05,823
For never was a story
of more woe

1425
01:00:05,857 --> 01:00:08,451
Than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.

1426
01:00:08,493 --> 01:00:09,824
( sighs )

1427
01:00:09,895 --> 01:00:12,386
Could you read it again?

1428
01:00:12,431 --> 01:00:14,592
Well, here, why don't
you read it to me?

1429
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:16,794
Uh, all right.

1430
01:00:16,835 --> 01:00:19,702
Uh...

1431
01:00:19,738 --> 01:00:21,831
Uh... I can't.

1432
01:00:21,873 --> 01:00:24,603
You mean,
you never learned?

1433
01:00:24,643 --> 01:00:26,838
I learned... a little.

1434
01:00:26,912 --> 01:00:29,574
It's just been so long.

1435
01:00:29,615 --> 01:00:31,845
Well, here, I'll help you.

1436
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:33,508
Let's start here.

1437
01:00:33,552 --> 01:00:36,282
Here.

1438
01:00:36,321 --> 01:00:38,289
Okay, "Twoe..."

1439
01:00:38,323 --> 01:00:39,290
"Two."

1440
01:00:39,324 --> 01:00:41,451
"Two... I knew that.

1441
01:00:41,493 --> 01:00:44,155
Two households..."

1442
01:00:44,196 --> 01:00:48,257
We'll be dancing again

1443
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,961
We'll be twirling again

1444
01:00:50,002 --> 01:00:53,529
We'll be whirling around
with such ease

1445
01:00:53,572 --> 01:00:54,869
When we're human again

1446
01:00:54,973 --> 01:00:56,600
Only human again

1447
01:00:56,642 --> 01:01:00,305
We'll go waltzing
those old one, two, threes

1448
01:01:00,345 --> 01:01:02,279
We'll be floating again

1449
01:01:02,314 --> 01:01:03,576
We'll be gliding again

1450
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:07,278
Stepping, striding
as fine as you please

1451
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:10,652
Like a real human does

1452
01:01:10,689 --> 01:01:14,216
I'll be all that I was

1453
01:01:14,259 --> 01:01:18,787
On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn

1454
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:22,391
And we're all

1455
01:01:22,434 --> 01:01:27,667
Human again!

1456
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:37,143
( sighing )

1457
01:01:37,182 --> 01:01:40,345
( growls )

1458
01:01:40,385 --> 01:01:43,354
Tonight is
the night.

1459
01:01:43,388 --> 01:01:46,152
I'm not sure I can do this.

1460
01:01:46,191 --> 01:01:47,783
You don't have time to be timid.

1461
01:01:47,826 --> 01:01:50,090
You must be bold, daring.

1462
01:01:50,128 --> 01:01:51,857
Bold, daring.

1463
01:01:54,766 --> 01:01:57,030
There will be music...

1464
01:01:57,069 --> 01:01:59,469
romantic candlelight...

1465
01:01:59,504 --> 01:02:01,472
provided by myself.

1466
01:02:01,506 --> 01:02:02,996
And when the moment
is right

1467
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:04,804
you confess your love.

1468
01:02:04,843 --> 01:02:06,811
Yes, I con...

1469
01:02:06,878 --> 01:02:09,711
I-I... No, I can't.

1470
01:02:09,748 --> 01:02:11,181
You care for the girl,
don't you?

1471
01:02:11,216 --> 01:02:13,480
More than anything.

1472
01:02:13,518 --> 01:02:15,247
Well, then,
you must tell her.

1473
01:02:17,322 --> 01:02:18,653
Voila!

1474
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:21,022
Oh, you look so... so...

1475
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:22,993
Stupid.

1476
01:02:23,028 --> 01:02:26,156
Not quite the word
I was looking for.

1477
01:02:26,198 --> 01:02:28,223
Perhaps a little more
off the top?

1478
01:02:29,701 --> 01:02:30,633
( clearing throat )

1479
01:02:30,669 --> 01:02:34,002
Your lady awaits.

1480
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:35,836
( chuckles )

1481
01:02:47,586 --> 01:02:49,918
( clears throat )

1482
01:02:58,663 --> 01:03:03,896
Tale as old as time

1483
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:08,133
True as it can be

1484
01:03:08,173 --> 01:03:09,299
( barking )

1485
01:03:09,341 --> 01:03:12,333
Barely even friends

1486
01:03:12,377 --> 01:03:14,971
Then somebody bends

1487
01:03:15,013 --> 01:03:16,878
Unexpectedly

1488
01:03:18,617 --> 01:03:21,313
Just a little change

1489
01:03:24,456 --> 01:03:27,084
Small, to say the least

1490
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:29,719
Both a little scared

1491
01:03:29,761 --> 01:03:32,924
Neither one prepared

1492
01:03:32,964 --> 01:03:35,728
Beauty and the Beast

1493
01:03:36,902 --> 01:03:38,597
( gulps )

1494
01:03:38,637 --> 01:03:40,502
Ever just the same

1495
01:03:43,642 --> 01:03:46,236
Ever a surprise

1496
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:48,405
Huh? Huh? Huh?

1497
01:03:48,447 --> 01:03:51,177
Ever as before

1498
01:03:51,216 --> 01:03:53,616
Ever just as sure

1499
01:03:53,652 --> 01:03:57,179
As the sun will rise

1500
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:03,423
Tale as old as time

1501
01:04:03,462 --> 01:04:08,058
Tune as old as song

1502
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:11,296
Bittersweet and strange

1503
01:04:11,336 --> 01:04:13,804
Finding you can change

1504
01:04:13,905 --> 01:04:16,806
Learning you were wrong

1505
01:04:18,777 --> 01:04:23,476
Certain as the sun

1506
01:04:23,515 --> 01:04:26,416
Rising in the east

1507
01:04:26,451 --> 01:04:28,681
Tale as old as time

1508
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,484
Song as old as rhyme

1509
01:04:31,523 --> 01:04:34,549
Beauty and the Beast

1510
01:04:34,593 --> 01:04:36,356
Shh!

1511
01:04:37,496 --> 01:04:41,091
Tale as old as time

1512
01:04:41,132 --> 01:04:45,330
Song as old as rhyme

1513
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:52,503
Beauty and the Beast.

1514
01:04:52,544 --> 01:04:54,705
Off to the cupboard
with you now, Chip.

1515
01:04:54,746 --> 01:04:56,077
It's past your bedtime.

1516
01:04:56,114 --> 01:04:58,446
( yawns )

1517
01:04:58,483 --> 01:05:00,883
Good night, love.

1518
01:05:09,828 --> 01:05:13,628
( insects humming )

1519
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:27,801
Belle?

1520
01:05:27,879 --> 01:05:31,440
Are you... happy
here with me?

1521
01:05:31,483 --> 01:05:33,348
Yes.

1522
01:05:37,389 --> 01:05:39,823
What is it?

1523
01:05:39,891 --> 01:05:42,587
If only I could see
my father again

1524
01:05:42,627 --> 01:05:44,254
just for a moment.

1525
01:05:44,296 --> 01:05:45,695
I miss him so much.

1526
01:05:51,303 --> 01:05:54,238
There is a way.

1527
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:57,998
This mirror will show
you anything...

1528
01:05:58,043 --> 01:06:01,479
anything
you wish to see.

1529
01:06:01,513 --> 01:06:04,346
I'd like to see
my father, please.

1530
01:06:08,987 --> 01:06:11,217
( coughs )

1531
01:06:11,256 --> 01:06:12,450
Papa?

1532
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:13,718
Oh, no.

1533
01:06:13,758 --> 01:06:16,022
He's sick.

1534
01:06:16,061 --> 01:06:17,688
He may be dying

1535
01:06:17,729 --> 01:06:19,697
and he's all alone.

1536
01:06:24,903 --> 01:06:28,361
Then, you must go to him.

1537
01:06:28,406 --> 01:06:29,703
What did you say?

1538
01:06:29,741 --> 01:06:30,799
I release you.

1539
01:06:30,842 --> 01:06:33,276
You are no longer my prisoner.

1540
01:06:33,311 --> 01:06:34,744
You mean...

1541
01:06:34,779 --> 01:06:35,939
I'm free?

1542
01:06:35,981 --> 01:06:38,040
Yes.

1543
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:40,278
Oh, thank you.

1544
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:42,479
Hold on, Papa.

1545
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,784
I'm on my way.

1546
01:06:44,823 --> 01:06:46,620
Take it with you

1547
01:06:46,658 --> 01:06:51,061
so you'll always have
a way to look back

1548
01:06:51,096 --> 01:06:52,927
and remember me.

1549
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,192
Thank you for
understanding

1550
01:06:57,235 --> 01:06:58,566
how much he needs me.

1551
01:07:07,212 --> 01:07:09,373
Well, Your Highness,
I must say

1552
01:07:09,414 --> 01:07:11,974
everything is going
just swimmingly.

1553
01:07:12,017 --> 01:07:13,177
I knew you had it in you.

1554
01:07:13,218 --> 01:07:14,480
( laughs )

1555
01:07:14,519 --> 01:07:16,009
I let her go.

1556
01:07:16,054 --> 01:07:17,351
( chuckles )

1557
01:07:17,389 --> 01:07:18,720
Yes, yes.

1558
01:07:18,757 --> 01:07:19,781
Splen...

1559
01:07:19,891 --> 01:07:22,792
You what?

1560
01:07:22,861 --> 01:07:24,351
How could you do that?

1561
01:07:24,396 --> 01:07:25,795
I had to.

1562
01:07:25,897 --> 01:07:26,886
Yes, but...

1563
01:07:26,931 --> 01:07:27,898
( sputtering )

1564
01:07:27,932 --> 01:07:28,796
Why?

1565
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:32,597
Because... I love her.

1566
01:07:32,637 --> 01:07:34,127
ALL:
He did what?

1567
01:07:34,172 --> 01:07:35,366
Yes.

1568
01:07:35,407 --> 01:07:37,102
I'm afraid it's true.

1569
01:07:37,142 --> 01:07:38,575
She's going away?

1570
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:40,669
But he was so close.

1571
01:07:40,712 --> 01:07:42,441
After all this time

1572
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,176
he's finally learned to love.

1573
01:07:45,216 --> 01:07:47,912
That's it, then.
That should break the spell.

1574
01:07:47,952 --> 01:07:49,510
But it's not enough.

1575
01:07:49,554 --> 01:07:51,954
She has to love him
in return.

1576
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:55,289
COGSWORTH:
Now it's too late.

1577
01:07:56,327 --> 01:07:57,658
( roaring )

1578
01:08:03,802 --> 01:08:06,635
Papa! Papa!

1579
01:08:07,872 --> 01:08:09,169
( gasping )

1580
01:08:19,517 --> 01:08:21,747
Ooh.

1581
01:08:21,786 --> 01:08:23,913
They're back.

1582
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:26,452
Belle?

1583
01:08:26,491 --> 01:08:27,480
Shh.

1584
01:08:27,525 --> 01:08:28,924
It's all right, Papa.

1585
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,053
I'm home.

1586
01:08:31,096 --> 01:08:32,290
I thought I'd never

1587
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:34,890
see you again.

1588
01:08:34,933 --> 01:08:36,798
I missed you so much.

1589
01:08:36,868 --> 01:08:37,800
but the Beast?

1590
01:08:37,869 --> 01:08:39,803
Did you...
How did you escape?

1591
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:41,135
I didn't escape, Papa.

1592
01:08:41,172 --> 01:08:42,400
He let me go.

1593
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,805
That horrible beast?

1594
01:08:43,908 --> 01:08:46,934
But he's different now, Papa.

1595
01:08:46,978 --> 01:08:49,242
He's changed somehow.

1596
01:08:53,284 --> 01:08:54,512
Hi.

1597
01:08:54,552 --> 01:08:57,453
Oh. A stowaway.

1598
01:08:57,489 --> 01:09:00,947
Why, hello there, little fella.

1599
01:09:00,992 --> 01:09:02,789
Didn't think
I'd see you again.

1600
01:09:02,827 --> 01:09:04,317
Belle, why'd you go away?

1601
01:09:04,362 --> 01:09:05,954
Don't you like us anymore?

1602
01:09:05,997 --> 01:09:08,124
Oh, Chip, of course I do.

1603
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:09,497
It's just...

1604
01:09:09,534 --> 01:09:14,139
( knocking )

1605
01:09:14,139 --> 01:09:15,333
May I help you?

1606
01:09:15,373 --> 01:09:17,307
I've come to collect
your father.

1607
01:09:17,342 --> 01:09:18,832
My father?

1608
01:09:18,877 --> 01:09:20,845
Don't worry, Mademoiselle.

1609
01:09:20,879 --> 01:09:23,074
We'll take good care of him.

1610
01:09:24,449 --> 01:09:25,609
My father's not crazy.

1611
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,481
He was raving like a lunatic.

1612
01:09:27,519 --> 01:09:29,316
We all heard him, didn't we?

1613
01:09:29,354 --> 01:09:31,288
( all agreeing )

1614
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:33,848
No, I won't let you.

1615
01:09:33,925 --> 01:09:34,857
Belle?

1616
01:09:34,893 --> 01:09:37,555
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

1617
01:09:37,595 --> 01:09:39,586
Just how big
was the beast?

1618
01:09:39,631 --> 01:09:41,292
( chuckles )

1619
01:09:41,332 --> 01:09:44,859
He was... I mean, he was...
he was... enormous.

1620
01:09:44,969 --> 01:09:46,664
I-I'd say
at least eight...

1621
01:09:46,704 --> 01:09:48,103
No, more like ten feet.

1622
01:09:48,139 --> 01:09:49,106
( laughing )

1623
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:53,201
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that.

1624
01:09:53,244 --> 01:09:54,472
( all laughing )

1625
01:09:54,512 --> 01:09:56,707
It's true, I tell you.

1626
01:09:56,748 --> 01:09:58,682
Get him
out of here.

1627
01:09:58,716 --> 01:10:00,047
Let go of me.

1628
01:10:00,084 --> 01:10:01,176
No!

1629
01:10:01,219 --> 01:10:03,278
You can't do this.

1630
01:10:03,321 --> 01:10:04,481
Poor Belle.

1631
01:10:04,522 --> 01:10:06,990
It's a shame
about your father.

1632
01:10:07,025 --> 01:10:08,754
You know he's
not crazy, Gaston.

1633
01:10:08,793 --> 01:10:11,694
Hmm, I might be able
to clear up this...

1634
01:10:11,729 --> 01:10:13,458
little misunderstanding.

1635
01:10:13,498 --> 01:10:14,590
lf...

1636
01:10:14,632 --> 01:10:15,462
If what?

1637
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,434
If you marry me.

1638
01:10:17,468 --> 01:10:18,435
What?

1639
01:10:18,469 --> 01:10:20,130
One little word, Belle.
That's all it takes.

1640
01:10:20,171 --> 01:10:21,160
Never.

1641
01:10:21,206 --> 01:10:22,833
Have it your way.

1642
01:10:22,907 --> 01:10:23,703
Belle.

1643
01:10:25,376 --> 01:10:26,934
Let go of me.

1644
01:10:26,978 --> 01:10:28,411
My father's not crazy

1645
01:10:28,446 --> 01:10:29,606
and I can prove it.

1646
01:10:29,647 --> 01:10:31,877
Show me the Beast.

1647
01:10:33,484 --> 01:10:35,111
( roaring )

1648
01:10:35,153 --> 01:10:36,484
( crowd gasping )

1649
01:10:36,521 --> 01:10:37,852
WOMAN:
Is it dangerous?

1650
01:10:37,922 --> 01:10:40,720
Oh, no, no, he'd
never hurt anyone.

1651
01:10:40,758 --> 01:10:43,192
Please, I know he looks vicious

1652
01:10:43,228 --> 01:10:44,855
but he's really
kind and gentle.

1653
01:10:44,963 --> 01:10:46,487
He's my friend.

1654
01:10:46,531 --> 01:10:47,725
If I didn't know better

1655
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:50,325
I'd think you had feelings
for this monster.

1656
01:10:50,368 --> 01:10:52,893
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are.

1657
01:10:54,105 --> 01:10:57,141
She's as crazy
as the old man.

1658
01:10:57,141 --> 01:11:00,508
The Beast will make off
with your children.

1659
01:11:00,545 --> 01:11:01,409
- He'll come after them
in the night.
- No!

1660
01:11:01,446 --> 01:11:02,413
We're not safe

1661
01:11:02,447 --> 01:11:04,005
till his head
is mounted on my wall.

1662
01:11:04,048 --> 01:11:05,811
I say we kill the Beast!

1663
01:11:05,917 --> 01:11:06,815
( cheering )

1664
01:11:06,885 --> 01:11:08,682
We're not safe
until he's dead

1665
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,312
He'll come stalking us
at night

1666
01:11:10,355 --> 01:11:12,255
Set to sacrifice
our children

1667
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:14,053
To his monstrous appetite

1668
01:11:14,092 --> 01:11:15,923
He'll wreak havoc
on our village

1669
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,484
If we let him wander free

1670
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:21,225
So it's time to take
some action, boys

1671
01:11:21,266 --> 01:11:26,397
It's time to follow me

1672
01:11:26,437 --> 01:11:28,098
( cheering )

1673
01:11:28,139 --> 01:11:30,004
Through the mist,
through the woods

1674
01:11:30,041 --> 01:11:31,838
Through the darkness
and the shadows

1675
01:11:31,943 --> 01:11:34,309
It's a nightmare,
but it's one exciting ride

1676
01:11:34,345 --> 01:11:37,781
Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle

1677
01:11:37,815 --> 01:11:41,251
And there's something
truly terrible inside

1678
01:11:41,286 --> 01:11:43,982
It's a beast, he's got fangs,
razor-sharp ones

1679
01:11:44,022 --> 01:11:47,355
Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast

1680
01:11:47,392 --> 01:11:49,360
Hear him roar, see him foam

1681
01:11:49,394 --> 01:11:51,089
But we're not coming home

1682
01:11:51,129 --> 01:11:52,528
Till he's dead

1683
01:11:52,563 --> 01:11:54,292
Good and dead

1684
01:11:54,332 --> 01:11:55,424
Kill the Beast!

1685
01:11:55,466 --> 01:11:57,058
No, I won't
let you do this.

1686
01:11:57,101 --> 01:11:59,626
If you're not with us,
you're against us.

1687
01:11:59,671 --> 01:12:00,729
Bring the old man.

1688
01:12:00,772 --> 01:12:02,399
Get your hands off me.

1689
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,806
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

1690
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:06,171
Let us out!

1691
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:08,906
We'll rid the village
of this beast.

1692
01:12:08,947 --> 01:12:09,971
Who's with me?

1693
01:12:10,014 --> 01:12:11,572
( cheering )

1694
01:12:11,616 --> 01:12:13,641
Raise your torch,
mount your horse

1695
01:12:13,685 --> 01:12:16,017
Screw your courage
to the sticking place

1696
01:12:16,054 --> 01:12:18,488
We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way

1697
01:12:18,523 --> 01:12:20,320
Through the mist,
through the wood

1698
01:12:20,358 --> 01:12:21,985
Where,
within a haunted castle

1699
01:12:22,026 --> 01:12:24,654
Something's lurking
that you don't see every day

1700
01:12:24,696 --> 01:12:28,257
It's a beast,
one as tall as a mountain

1701
01:12:28,299 --> 01:12:31,462
We won't rest
till he's good and deceased

1702
01:12:31,502 --> 01:12:33,299
Sally forth, tally ho

1703
01:12:33,338 --> 01:12:34,965
Grab your sword,
grab your bow

1704
01:12:35,006 --> 01:12:36,496
Praise the lord,
and here we go.

1705
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:39,977
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!

1706
01:12:40,011 --> 01:12:42,275
I have to warn the Beast.

1707
01:12:42,313 --> 01:12:44,213
This is all my fault.

1708
01:12:44,248 --> 01:12:46,182
Oh, Papa, what are
we going to do?

1709
01:12:46,217 --> 01:12:47,548
Now, now.

1710
01:12:47,585 --> 01:12:49,109
We'll think of something.

1711
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:53,384
Ah!

1712
01:12:54,993 --> 01:12:56,290
( thunder claps )

1713
01:12:56,327 --> 01:12:58,727
We don't like
what we don't understand

1714
01:12:58,763 --> 01:13:00,492
In fact, it scares us

1715
01:13:00,531 --> 01:13:03,125
And this monster
is mysterious at least

1716
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:04,657
Bring your guns,
bring your knives

1717
01:13:04,702 --> 01:13:06,226
Save your children
and your wives

1718
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:09,364
We'll save our village
and our lives

1719
01:13:09,407 --> 01:13:10,806
We'll kill the Beast!

1720
01:13:10,908 --> 01:13:12,307
COGSWORTH:
I knew it.

1721
01:13:12,343 --> 01:13:14,743
I knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

1722
01:13:14,779 --> 01:13:17,543
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

1723
01:13:17,582 --> 01:13:18,810
( barking )

1724
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:20,078
Could it be?

1725
01:13:20,118 --> 01:13:20,914
Is it she?

1726
01:13:20,952 --> 01:13:22,351
Sacre bleu!

1727
01:13:22,387 --> 01:13:23,411
Invaders.

1728
01:13:23,454 --> 01:13:24,682
COGSWORTH:
Encroachers.

1729
01:13:24,722 --> 01:13:26,087
POTTS:
And they have
the mirror.

1730
01:13:26,124 --> 01:13:27,148
Warn the master.

1731
01:13:27,191 --> 01:13:29,125
If it's a fight they want,
we'll be ready for them.

1732
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,149
Who's with me?

1733
01:13:30,194 --> 01:13:31,183
Ah!

1734
01:13:31,229 --> 01:13:33,220
Take whatever booty
you can find

1735
01:13:33,264 --> 01:13:36,358
but remember,
the Beast is mine!

1736
01:13:36,401 --> 01:13:38,130
Lights ablaze, banners high

1737
01:13:38,169 --> 01:13:39,830
We go marching into battle

1738
01:13:39,904 --> 01:13:42,600
Unafraid, although
the danger just increased

1739
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,369
Raise the flag,
sing the song

1740
01:13:44,409 --> 01:13:45,740
Here we come,
we're 50 strong

1741
01:13:45,777 --> 01:13:48,302
And 50 Frenchmen
can't be wrong

1742
01:13:48,346 --> 01:13:50,143
Let's kill the Beast!

1743
01:13:51,115 --> 01:13:54,278
- Pardon me, Master?
- Leave me in peace.

1744
01:13:54,318 --> 01:13:56,843
But, sir, the castle
is under attack.

1745
01:13:56,888 --> 01:13:58,116
( shouting )

1746
01:13:58,156 --> 01:13:59,987
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

1747
01:14:00,024 --> 01:14:01,787
This isn't working.

1748
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:04,327
Oh, Lumiere,
we must do something.

1749
01:14:04,362 --> 01:14:06,796
Wait, I know.

1750
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:09,128
( shouting )

1751
01:14:09,167 --> 01:14:12,000
What shall
we do, Master?

1752
01:14:12,036 --> 01:14:14,561
It doesn't matter now.

1753
01:14:14,605 --> 01:14:16,664
Just let them come.

1754
01:14:16,707 --> 01:14:20,040
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

1755
01:14:20,078 --> 01:14:21,272
Kill the Beast!

1756
01:14:21,312 --> 01:14:22,779
( complete silence )

1757
01:14:27,852 --> 01:14:29,820
( murmuring )

1758
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:31,115
( soft footsteps )

1759
01:14:34,258 --> 01:14:34,917
Now!

1760
01:14:34,959 --> 01:14:36,620
( yelling )

1761
01:14:41,599 --> 01:14:42,657
( clanking )

1762
01:14:45,169 --> 01:14:46,431
( slurping )

1763
01:14:46,471 --> 01:14:47,665
( burps )

1764
01:14:47,705 --> 01:14:51,539
( clamoring )

1765
01:14:51,576 --> 01:14:54,545
( motor chugging )

1766
01:14:54,579 --> 01:14:55,978
( blowing )

1767
01:14:56,013 --> 01:14:57,275
Yes!

1768
01:14:59,851 --> 01:15:00,783
( whistle blowing )

1769
01:15:00,885 --> 01:15:02,546
Here we go.

1770
01:15:04,222 --> 01:15:05,780
( whistle tooting )

1771
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:07,482
What the devil?

1772
01:15:08,593 --> 01:15:09,855
Belle, look out!

1773
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:19,228
You guys got to try this thing.

1774
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:21,033
( screaming )

1775
01:15:23,841 --> 01:15:25,604
Up here

1776
01:15:25,643 --> 01:15:27,975
you scurvy scum! Now!

1777
01:15:28,012 --> 01:15:29,639
( man yelling )

1778
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:33,807
( singing operatic note )

1779
01:15:46,364 --> 01:15:47,661
Oh!

1780
01:15:47,698 --> 01:15:50,690
( screaming )

1781
01:15:52,036 --> 01:15:54,061
( laughing maniacally )

1782
01:15:54,105 --> 01:15:56,505
( laughing )

1783
01:15:56,541 --> 01:15:58,668
( shuddering )

1784
01:15:58,709 --> 01:16:00,973
( yelling )

1785
01:16:03,481 --> 01:16:05,972
( screaming )

1786
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,615
( crazed laughter )

1787
01:16:13,524 --> 01:16:15,424
( screaming )

1788
01:16:17,395 --> 01:16:19,363
( barking )

1789
01:16:19,397 --> 01:16:22,093
( whimpering )

1790
01:16:23,801 --> 01:16:25,792
( growling )

1791
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:27,929
( laughing maniacally )

1792
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:30,232
( evil laughter )

1793
01:16:30,274 --> 01:16:31,707
( screaming )

1794
01:16:34,712 --> 01:16:37,977
( cheering )

1795
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,483
And stay out!

1796
01:16:42,353 --> 01:16:43,980
Eww!

1797
01:16:54,098 --> 01:16:57,124
( groans )

1798
01:16:58,169 --> 01:17:01,104
( roaring )

1799
01:17:02,506 --> 01:17:04,497
( laughing maniacally )

1800
01:17:09,947 --> 01:17:11,175
Get up.

1801
01:17:11,215 --> 01:17:12,546
( moaning )

1802
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:15,245
Get up!

1803
01:17:15,286 --> 01:17:17,311
What's the matter, Beast?

1804
01:17:17,355 --> 01:17:18,686
( laughing )

1805
01:17:18,723 --> 01:17:21,658
Too kind and gentle
to fight back?

1806
01:17:21,692 --> 01:17:23,887
( groans )

1807
01:17:28,299 --> 01:17:29,698
BELLE:
No!

1808
01:17:31,736 --> 01:17:33,294
( horse whinnies )

1809
01:17:33,337 --> 01:17:34,065
Belle...

1810
01:17:34,105 --> 01:17:36,539
No! Gaston, don't!

1811
01:17:38,743 --> 01:17:41,007
( growling )

1812
01:17:41,045 --> 01:17:42,273
( snarling )

1813
01:17:42,313 --> 01:17:43,678
Let's go, Philippe.

1814
01:17:43,714 --> 01:17:45,204
( whinnying )

1815
01:17:50,221 --> 01:17:51,552
( groans )

1816
01:17:58,095 --> 01:18:00,586
( growling )

1817
01:18:08,773 --> 01:18:10,434
Come on out and fight!

1818
01:18:13,044 --> 01:18:15,979
Were you in love with her,
Beast?

1819
01:18:16,013 --> 01:18:18,777
Did you honestly think
she'd want you

1820
01:18:18,849 --> 01:18:21,215
when she had someone like me?

1821
01:18:24,155 --> 01:18:26,180
( growling )

1822
01:18:32,096 --> 01:18:34,758
It's over, Beast.

1823
01:18:34,799 --> 01:18:36,528
Belle is mine!

1824
01:18:41,972 --> 01:18:43,599
Let me go. Let me go.

1825
01:18:43,641 --> 01:18:45,370
Please, don't hurt me.

1826
01:18:45,409 --> 01:18:46,433
I'll do anything.

1827
01:18:46,477 --> 01:18:48,104
Anything!

1828
01:18:58,723 --> 01:19:01,453
( Gaston moaning )

1829
01:19:01,492 --> 01:19:04,222
Get out.

1830
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:06,456
Beast!

1831
01:19:06,497 --> 01:19:07,657
Belle?

1832
01:19:15,573 --> 01:19:17,768
Belle?

1833
01:19:23,514 --> 01:19:25,880
You came back.

1834
01:19:27,852 --> 01:19:28,841
( thud )

1835
01:19:28,919 --> 01:19:31,080
( roaring )

1836
01:19:37,595 --> 01:19:41,827
( screaming )

1837
01:19:41,866 --> 01:19:43,595
( scream stops )

1838
01:19:46,137 --> 01:19:50,733
( panting )

1839
01:20:04,021 --> 01:20:06,990
You...

1840
01:20:07,024 --> 01:20:08,685
You came back.

1841
01:20:08,726 --> 01:20:10,387
Of course I came back.

1842
01:20:10,428 --> 01:20:12,191
I couldn't let them...

1843
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:14,163
Oh, this is all my fault.

1844
01:20:14,198 --> 01:20:16,598
If only I'd gotten
here sooner.

1845
01:20:16,634 --> 01:20:20,126
Maybe... it's better...

1846
01:20:20,171 --> 01:20:21,468
it's better this way.

1847
01:20:21,505 --> 01:20:23,837
Don't talk like that.

1848
01:20:23,874 --> 01:20:25,501
You'll be all right.

1849
01:20:25,543 --> 01:20:26,669
( coughing )

1850
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:27,699
We're together now.

1851
01:20:27,745 --> 01:20:29,212
Everything's
going to be fine.

1852
01:20:29,246 --> 01:20:31,441
You'll see.

1853
01:20:31,482 --> 01:20:34,747
And... at least...

1854
01:20:34,785 --> 01:20:37,515
I got to see you...

1855
01:20:37,555 --> 01:20:39,250
one last time.

1856
01:20:44,261 --> 01:20:46,252
( exhales )

1857
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,627
No. No.

1858
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:55,628
Please... Please...

1859
01:20:55,673 --> 01:20:57,607
Please, don't leave me.

1860
01:20:57,641 --> 01:20:59,802
( sobbing )

1861
01:20:59,844 --> 01:21:03,712
I love you.

1862
01:21:18,562 --> 01:21:21,554
( sobbing )

1863
01:22:41,178 --> 01:22:42,611
Belle.

1864
01:22:42,646 --> 01:22:44,307
It's me.

1865
01:22:59,597 --> 01:23:01,292
It is you.

1866
01:23:33,931 --> 01:23:36,297
Lumiere.

1867
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:38,961
Cogsworth!

1868
01:23:39,003 --> 01:23:41,198
Mrs. Potts!

1869
01:23:41,238 --> 01:23:42,398
Look at us.

1870
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:43,963
Mama, Mama.

1871
01:23:44,008 --> 01:23:45,373
( barking )

1872
01:23:48,045 --> 01:23:49,410
( chuckling )

1873
01:23:49,446 --> 01:23:50,777
My goodness.

1874
01:23:50,814 --> 01:23:52,679
It is a miracle.

1875
01:23:52,716 --> 01:23:55,480
( Belle laughing )

1876
01:24:02,526 --> 01:24:03,458
( sighs )

1877
01:24:03,494 --> 01:24:04,859
L'amour.

1878
01:24:07,398 --> 01:24:08,695
( lusty laugh )

1879
01:24:08,732 --> 01:24:11,030
Well, Lumiere,
old friend.

1880
01:24:11,068 --> 01:24:12,365
Shall we let bygones
be bygones?

1881
01:24:12,403 --> 01:24:13,370
Of course, mon ami.

1882
01:24:13,404 --> 01:24:15,031
I told you she would
break the spell.

1883
01:24:15,072 --> 01:24:17,700
I beg your pardon,
old friend

1884
01:24:17,741 --> 01:24:20,073
but I believe
I told you.

1885
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:21,771
No, you didn't--
I told you.

1886
01:24:21,812 --> 01:24:24,144
You most certainly
did not, you pompous

1887
01:24:24,181 --> 01:24:25,739
paraffin-headed
pea-brain.

1888
01:24:25,783 --> 01:24:28,513
En garde, you-you
overgrown pocket watch.

1889
01:24:28,552 --> 01:24:29,712
Take that.

1890
01:24:29,753 --> 01:24:31,744
( quarreling continues )

1891
01:24:33,724 --> 01:24:37,626
Are they going to live
happily ever after, Mama?

1892
01:24:37,661 --> 01:24:39,629
Of course, my dear.

1893
01:24:39,663 --> 01:24:41,824
Of course.

1894
01:24:41,865 --> 01:24:44,925
Do I still have
to sleep in the cupboard?

1895
01:24:44,968 --> 01:24:46,128
( laughing )

1896
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:47,467
( laughing )

1897
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:53,670
Certain as the sun

1898
01:24:53,711 --> 01:24:56,077
Rising in the east

1899
01:24:56,113 --> 01:24:59,048
Tale as old as time

1900
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:01,347
Song as old as rhyme

1901
01:25:01,385 --> 01:25:07,722
Beauty and the Beast

1902
01:25:07,758 --> 01:25:10,352
Tale as old as time

1903
01:25:10,394 --> 01:25:13,693
Song as old as rhyme

1904
01:25:13,731 --> 01:25:20,432
Beauty and the Beast.

1905
01:25:31,315 --> 01:25:35,342
( intro to "Beauty
and the Beast" begins )

1906
01:25:35,385 --> 01:25:40,118
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

1907
01:25:44,394 --> 01:25:50,731
Tale as old as time

1908
01:25:50,768 --> 01:25:56,400
True as it can be

1909
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:00,069
Barely even friends

1910
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:03,079
Then somebody bends

1911
01:26:03,113 --> 01:26:09,109
Unexpectedly

1912
01:26:09,153 --> 01:26:15,456
Just a little change

1913
01:26:15,492 --> 01:26:18,757
Small to say the least

1914
01:26:18,796 --> 01:26:21,765
Both a little scared

1915
01:26:21,799 --> 01:26:25,166
Neither one prepared

1916
01:26:25,202 --> 01:26:30,606
Beauty and the Beast

1917
01:26:30,641 --> 01:26:37,046
Ever just the same

1918
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:43,383
Ever a surprise

1919
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:46,685
Ever as before

1920
01:26:46,723 --> 01:26:49,715
And ever just as sure

1921
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:54,595
As the sun will rise

1922
01:26:54,631 --> 01:26:57,930
Whoa, oh-oh

1923
01:26:57,968 --> 01:27:00,766
Whoa, oh

1924
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:20,786
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

1925
01:27:20,824 --> 01:27:27,457
Ever just the same

1926
01:27:27,497 --> 01:27:33,436
Ever a surprise

1927
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:36,439
Ever as before

1928
01:27:36,473 --> 01:27:39,442
Ever just as sure

1929
01:27:39,476 --> 01:27:43,776
As the sun will rise

1930
01:27:43,814 --> 01:27:49,150
Oh, oh, oh...

1931
01:27:49,186 --> 01:27:55,682
Tale as old as time

1932
01:27:55,726 --> 01:28:01,756
Tune as old as song

1933
01:28:01,832 --> 01:28:04,767
Bittersweet and strange

1934
01:28:04,835 --> 01:28:07,770
Finding you can change

1935
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:14,140
Learning you were wrong

1936
01:28:14,177 --> 01:28:17,476
Certain as the sun

1937
01:28:17,514 --> 01:28:20,779
Certain as the sun

1938
01:28:20,851 --> 01:28:23,786
Rising in the east

1939
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:26,482
Tale as old as time

1940
01:28:26,523 --> 01:28:29,515
Song as old as rhyme

1941
01:28:29,559 --> 01:28:35,794
Beauty and the Beast

1942
01:28:35,832 --> 01:28:39,165
Tale as old as time

1943
01:28:39,202 --> 01:28:42,797
Song as old as rhyme

1944
01:28:42,873 --> 01:28:53,807
Beauty and the Beast

1945
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:57,650
Oh, oh-oh-oh

1946
01:28:57,688 --> 01:29:01,488
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

1947
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:10,528
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm

1948
01:29:13,537 --> 01:29:28,077
Beauty and the Beast.
