you are sorely mistaken.

We may be Union men, yes.
But we are Southerners too.

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,255
I've been thinking, Jack Bull.
A wedding is a peculiar thing.

51
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,883
- It's no more peculiar, Jake, than slavery.
- That's certain.

52
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,469
That's why I've often wondered
for what cause those Northerners...

53
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,888
are so anxious to change
our Southern institutions.

54
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,932
- Hmm.
- From both North and South...

55
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,644
men are every day enslaved at the altar,
regardless of their state or color.

56
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,189
Well, there's a type of subjugation.
We shall avoid it, Jake.

Happily my poverty ensures
my freedom from such a fate.

Oh, no.
Not if my mother can help it.

For us, this is no war.

a pastime as greasin' ganders.

158
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,969
- Who's guns are those?
- Even Holt over there.

159
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,765
You'll get used to him.
That's Holt.

160
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,934
That's George Clyde's pet nigger.

161
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,312
Don't call him that in front of George though.
George don't like that.

162
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,689
- He carries those?
- Yep.

163
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:23,570
He's a damn fine scout.
George tosses him a gun a good Yankee kill or two.

164
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,240
You know,
him and Clyde growed up together.

165
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,409
When Jim Lane's boys come for Clyde,
Holt there sent three of them to heaven.

166
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,411
So he rides with us now.

167
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,289
'Cause them Yankees
want to kill him real bad.

168
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,626
Yeah. Well, a nigger with guns
is still a nervous thing to me.

[Chuckles]

170

We're lookin' for the Dorr's place, ma'am.

Who are you?

173

Why, we are Southern men,
and hungry.

174

You don't look like Southern men.

How do I know?

176
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:16,290
Woman, my name is Crawford.
One of the Six Point Creek Crawfords.

177
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,792
Do you know me?

178
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,919
I knew the father.

179
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,716
Well, come on.
Eat as what we have.

Ma'am.

- You alone here?
- Yes.

184
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:48,614
Well, no. My man's at Arkansas
with Shelby.

185
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,910
My son's in the barn.

186
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,746
Is he grown?

187
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,539
He was.

188
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,584
Gave up a leg at Wilson's Creek.

189
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,672
I keep him hid away.
Union Jayhawkers would kill him.

190
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,758
He should ride with us.

191
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,385
Oh, no. He won't fight.

192
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,888
He's done with that.

193
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,775
Hello inside.

Show yourself, Clark. We're friends.

[Man Chuckling]

196

But it ain't even loaded.

198
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,761
Not no need of that.
We're friends.

199
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,932
Oh, you suppose so, do you?
I don't.

200
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,560
You were at Wilson's Creek.
Who with?

201
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,063
Why, with General Price.

202
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,816
The fat glory-hound rebel himself.

203
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,490
Didn't see that one comin', huh?

204
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:17,160
[Chuckles]
Oh, I saw it comin'.

205
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:21,957
I saw it rollin' past the little piles
of meat and bone which I once called my friends.

206
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,959
I watched it roll right up to me.

207
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,170
If you saw it comin',
couldn't you have dodged it?

208
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,175
Well, nature bore me smart.
That changes things.

209
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,429
I wanted my foot broke
so's I could head home.

- Damn little cannonball was rollin' slower
than a fevered rabbit.

- You are a fool. Cannonball will rip your leg -
- [Laughing]

00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,569
Well, General Price is a good man.

213
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,696
Why don't you have us
fetch you something to eat.

214
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,199
I have a mother for that.

215
00:17:56,284 --> 00:18:00,203
I don't eat anyway.
Tryin' something different.

216
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,914
You'll be killed anyways.

217
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,042
Jayhawkers or militias -
someone or the other - stop here and kill you.

00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:09,838
Oh, they already been here.
Burned the barn.

I wouldn't even move to put it out.
Ma done it.

I could do you a fair job of it this minute.

230

You could help her out some,
don't you think?

231
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,685
Get yourself a stick to lean on,
walk around a bit.

Mm-hmm.

- [Man] Jake Roedel.

Well, Alf Bowden.
You sure are in a fix.

320
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,018
Seems so.
Surely does seem so.

321
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,812
- Do you know this man?
- Certainly.

- News of home?
- No, no, no. It all just goes on.

Some may have died,
not most.

327
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,665
What of my mother?

328
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,711
Well, now -
Well, she is watched.

329
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,755
All the secesh are watched.

330
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,174
And my father?

331
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,676
He comes and goes.
He's a Union man.

332
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,804
He ain't bothered by no one.
You must know that.

333
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:05,808
You must know the whole town
talks about you boys out here black-flaggin' it.

334
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,937
Some friendliness
may be lost for your kin.

Not so as you'd notice.

00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,490

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,291
Now, take this down.
Itis forthe Lexington Union News.

340
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:33,127
So do it fine, the way you do.

"Mistakes are most common these days
and deadly for it.

344
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:45,723
"The Federals are to hang William Lloyd
and James Curtain...

345
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:48,768
"two fine sons of Missouri.

346

'But by a provident cut of the cards...

"four Federals have been dealt to me.

348
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:57,110
"And it is their hope
that Lloyd and Curtain are not hanged...

00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:00,613
'as they would provide
the sequel to these murders.

356
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:26,013
That's good.
Put a note on it that says...

357
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,392
"Where you think we ain't, we are.
Remember it."

358
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:38,025
Who will deliver it?
There are Federals all over Lexington.

359
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,070
We could slip a man in there.
We done it before.

360
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:46,576
Oh, I reckon a citizen could be pressed into service,
if one could be found.

361
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:51,080
That might be a job,
for citizens are cautious hereabouts.

362
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:53,332
You got some better idea, Dutchy?

363
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,751
Maybe you should volunteer yourself.

364
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,089
Well, there is a way we could
prove more things than one.

365
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:03,050
If we send a prisoner,
it would prove we have prisoners.

366
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,345
And also
he can attest to our intentions.

367
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,891
It seems to me he could get
more quickly into town as well.

368
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,684
And time is short.

369
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:15,563
Lloyd and Curtain will be hanged
right quick, I would think.

370
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:25,615
It is a good idea.
There are some fine touches to it.

371
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,825
You know, you should
speak up more, Roedel.

372
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,578
You're not near so dumb
as you let on.

373
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,580
Aw.

374
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,917
Now go put one of them Federals
on a horse with that letter.

375
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,671
Convince them to see
this deal through, Alf.

376
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:44,091
We're only askin' to be treated
like the soldiers that we are.

377
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,844
We shall do the same
for your companions here.

378
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,472
Do your best.

379
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,854

380
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,443
What are you lookin' at?

[Sighs]
What is it, Jake?

382
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,754
I hear you ruminatin' louder
than a cow chewin' in my ear...

383
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,507
and it's keepin' me from my sleep.

384
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:29,595
Do you think Alf Bowden's
made it back to Lexington as yet?

385
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:33,849
There was a minute there
when I saw him ridin' off -

386
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,395
I thought maybe
you and me could join him.

387
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,439
That we could all ride home together.

388
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,526
Just ride back home.

389
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:48,823
What have you left at home
you're so anxious to ride back to?

390
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:52,285
Nothin'.

391
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,246
Just a passel of memories.

392
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,540
Mostly memories of you and me.

393
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,544
Of your father, old Asa Chiles.

394
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,467
We'll stick together, Jack Bull.
We'll get all of it back.

395
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,636
Huh.

396
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:14,181
Then you're a black magician
who can raise the dead, are ya?

397
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:21,647
No. My father's under the dirt to stay.

398
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,192
Like that's gone to stay too.

399
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,446
- My finger?
- Mm-hmm.

400
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,656
Well, so it is.

401
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:34,160
And it makes me notable
by the loss.

402
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:38,789
You sound pleased, as if that finger
had been pesterin' you for rings.

403
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:42,335
No. It was a fine finger,
and I'd rather have it still.

404
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:47,340
But it was took from me,
and it's been et by chickens for sure.

405
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:52,928
And I say,
what is the good side to this amputation?

406
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:56,098
- And there is one.
- Name it, Jake.

407
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,685
Well, you say one day some Federals...

408
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,563
catch up to me
and kill me in a thicket.

409
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,482
Well, they would riddle me
and hang me...

410
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,734
and no Southern man
would find me for weeks or months.

411
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,738
And when they did, I'd be bad meat,
pretty well rotted to a glob.

412
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,575
[Sighs]
You're scientifically accurate, I'm afraid.

413
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,830
- I've seen it.
- I'd be a mysterious gob of rot.

414
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,918
People would say,
"who was that?"

415
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,003
And surely someone
would look up and say...

416
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:29,423
"Why, it's nubbin-fingered Jake Roedel."

417
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,385
And then you could go
and tell my father I was clearly murdered...

418
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,805
and he wouldn't be tortured
by uncertain wonders.

419
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,226
And that's the good of it?

420
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,894
Yes, sir, that's the good.

421

- Well, that was not the plan, Jake.

There's no military intelligence in here.

00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,186
Was. I wanna hear you read it.

a little bit more, Dutchy...

you'll think you do wanna read it me.

Right now too.

How do we know there
might be secrets in it?

453
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,000

00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,757
"But it works fine enough.

468
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:02,928
"The dirt was turned over,
and the smell and deepness gave me heart.

469
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,893
It is just black rich.
You boys know how that is."

470
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,770
My daddy was up there.

471
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,940
He was up there
way before they hung him.

472
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,818
He said the dirt was so rich
you could've ate it like porridge.

473
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,362
They have very good dirt up there.

474
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,656
Short grow season.

475
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,367
Yeah, sounds like real good dirt to me.

476
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:32,082
"That girl Dave got sweet for is in town
and still single and about.

477
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:36,670
"She asks of you, but I have no news
since first frost of the year last.

478
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,590
"Without news,
I cannot answer her.

479
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,011
You are both missed here.
Your mother."

480
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:49,099
Sounds like my mother -
that old woman does.

481
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:53,687
One mother's
very much like another.

482
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,566
Remember one thing.
Her boys will kill you if they can.

483
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,406
[Clears Throat]

484
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:21,340
[Black John]
It is time for our winter hibernation.

485
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:25,678
I have gathered the names
of loyal Southerners who shall provide for us.

486
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,680
We'll group in fours.

487
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:32,267
I'll send word the beginnin' of spring
for where to rendezvous.

488
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,896
We shall to the Evans farm, boys.

489
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,857
Their place is about half a mile
from the Willards'...

490
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,860
where there resides
a certain Miss Juanita...

491
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,862
to whom, if I do not flatter myself...

492
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,573
my attentions are not
unfavorably regarded.

493
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,867
You mean to say we're to spend
the winter in Lafayette...

494
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,870
solely on account that
you're sweet on Juanita Willard?

495
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:54,707
Ach, it's as good a reason as any, Dutchy.

496
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,006
Nolan's brought some news from home.

497
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,008
Hank Pattison is murdered.

498
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,344
Our old neighbor Jantzen got him
with his gang of militia.

499
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:10,723
That is sad. He was a good Southern man.
What of Thomas?

500
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,891
Oh, he is murdered too.

501
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,936
And Sally Burgess
married a Federal from Michigan.

502
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:19,398
- [Scoffs]
- [Chuckles] Her whole family hides their faces.

503
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,987
And -

504
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,407
Well, Dutchy...

505
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,993
that Federal Alf Bowden -

506
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,330
he rode straight from here
and killed your father.

507
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:41,045
He shot him in the neck
down by the river...

508
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:44,298
then booted him
along Main Street till he died.

509
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,846
I spared Alf Bowden.

510
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,892
You all know it.

511
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,937
You taught him mercy,
but he forgot the lesson.

512
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,817
My father -

513
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:07,196
My father was a Unionist
like all the Germans.

514
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,364
An unconditional Unionist.

515
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,241
Well, yeah.

516
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,453
But he was mainly known
as your father, Dutchy.

517
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,372
You got a reputation now.

518
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:17,307
[Man]
Hello there, boys.

519
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,309
[Clyde]
Good day, sir.

520
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,645
- Gabel Evans.
- George Clyde.

521
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:28,277
Sorry we can't all be of proper hospitality,
but with the Federal patrols -

522
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:31,905
We're much obliged.
May I ask after Mrs. Evans?

523
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:36,368
My wife.
Well, she's as well as can be expected.

524
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,705
Our other Mrs. Evans -
that's Sue Lee -

525
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:43,375
Well, she was a Mrs. Evans
for but three weeks...

526
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,503
until my son joined
our Confederate forces.

527
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:52,134
He was killed in the fightin'
at Independence.

528
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,723
We're sorry to hear of it.

529
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:02,352
Yes. Well, you boys lay low.

530
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,813
We'll come by from time to time
with provisions...

531
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:07,274
such as there are.

532
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,318
[Clyde]
We're much obliged.

533
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,573
[Grunting]

534
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,419
[Digging Continues]

535
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,463
[Grunting Continues]

536
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:36,261
It's been a while since we done work.
Somethin' soothin' to it.

537
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:41,850
Yeah, well, work has never been
my main ambition.

538
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:45,520
Ah, we've done much work.
I think I've spied an easier way to riches.

539
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:48,023
Spell out this miracle.

540
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,525
You just ride on up and take it.

541
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:55,239
Ah, good old rule.
A simple plan.

542
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,991
It's a workable method.
That is proven.

543
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,286
[All Grunting]

544
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:04,164
Now, George...

545
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,749
you got mud in your eye.

546
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,751
- Mmm.
- [Both Laughing]

547
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:11,046
- [Jake] Rider comin'.
- Oh, let's go see our visitor.

548
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:22,140
[Woman] Just me! Don't shoot
or some dumb thing like that.

549
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,487
- Whoa.
- Well, how do?

550
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,573
- You must be Mrs. Evans.
- I brung you some supper.

551
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:45,789
- [Sniffs] I'm, uh, pleased to meet you, Mr. - 
- Chiles.

552
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:50,127
Mr. Jack Bull Chiles.
This is Jake Roedel.

553
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,587
- And -
- George Clyde, Mrs. Evans.

554
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:58,135
Mr. Evans wishes me to apologize
for not havin' sent you food sooner.

555
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,137
The Federals have been on the move.

556
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:05,350
And don't you call me Mrs. Evans.
My name is Sue Lee Shelley.

557
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:08,103
It's a good one,
and I am a widow now.

558
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,689
Reckon I'll go back to it and use it.

559
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,733
Please pardon me.

560
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,321
Won't you come in?
It's not much to gaze upon...

561
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:20,032
but I reckon we could assay
some hospitality.

562
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:23,160
- George.
- After me, ma'am.

563
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,046
- Right this way, ma'am.
- Excuse me.

564
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,089
[Sue Lee]
Thank you.

565
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,138
Damn.

00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,018
What are you smilin' at?

567
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,480
I'll see to that mule.

568
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:54,691
Wait a second.
What did you say?

569
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:57,402
I say I'll look to him.

570
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:01,448
You better go on in there.
Let that woman see your face.

571
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,452
Damnation, Holt.

572
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,038
I think I know best
how to handle my personal affairs.

573
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,166
Now, you see that lady's mule
while I check on what she brung to eat.

574
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,714
- [Jack Bull] Excuse the mud. We'll just -
- [Clyde] There you go, ma'am.

Well, aren't you bushwhackers
the gentlemen.

577
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,899
We try to make the effort
when possible, ma'am.

578
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,610
Do you think manners should be dropped
in times like these?

579
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:42,697
No. But I don't think horse sense
oughta be dropped either.

580
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,699
[Chuckles]
It's cold.

582
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:52,416
You're so kind to think of us, ma'am.

583
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,794
You men think of us more.
You do the good work.

584
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,547
I know it's dirty and it's dangerous.

585
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,967
Those are good words to hear, ma'am.

586
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:04,010
It's - It's not always we hear them.

587
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,478
[Clears Throat]
Well, I really should be goin'.

588
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,897
Mrs. Evans will worry if I don't.

589
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,568
Uh, ma'am?

590
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,906
We're awful sorry about
Evans Jr. Gettin' killed.

591
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,160
Well, we all suffer.

592
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,120
But he suffers no more.

593
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,456
He was a good husband to me.

594
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,585
For three weeks he was a good husband,
but he didn't last.

595
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:46,011
What's he doin' here, inside?

596
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:49,431
Oh, ma'am, this - this nigger's with me.
His name is Holt.

597
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:54,686
Well, wouldn't he be more useful
off in a field plowin'?

598
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,022
[Chuckles]

599
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:59,065
Oh, no, I reckon not.

600
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:03,069
No, ma'am. That's, uh, one nigger
I wouldn't try to hitch behind a plow.

601
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,489
No, I wouldn't try that.

602
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,783
Well, now.

603
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,164
Oh, I almost forgot.

604
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,751
Mr. Evans asked that you come to the house
tomorrow evenin' after dark.

605
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,921
He's up on the latest Federal movements,
and he could post you on 'em.

606
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,589
[Jack Bull]
Why, we'd be honored.

607
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:27,385
Um, I'm not sure about him.
Mr. Evans -

608
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,554
You ain't got nothin'
to worry about on that score.

609
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:31,556
You needn't worry about Holt.

610
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:34,643
I'll be takin' Holt with me
to the Willards' tomorrow.

611
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,436
We won't be comin' to your dinner.

612
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:38,522
Mr. Clyde, honestly...

613
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,607
I didn't mean to speak ill
of your nigger.

614
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,442
He's not my nigger.

615
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:46,863
He's just a nigger who I trust with my life
every day and night, that's all.

616
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:52,327
- That's very high praise.
- Yes, ma'am, it is.

617
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,329
I see.

618
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,749
Well, gentlemen,
I really must take my leave.

619
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,961
- I hope the food'll please you.
- It looks wonderful.

620
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:04,047
Why, thank you.
Now good night, all.

621
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,466
- Good night.
- Good night, ma'am.

622
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:09,928
Holt, the lady said good night to all.

623
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,930
Now touch your hat and say good night.

624
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,266
- Chiles, you don't tell him nothin'.
- He's bein' rude.

625
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,685
- Gentlemen, please.
- He don't need no tellin', Chiles!

626
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:18,979
It's all right, George.

627
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,147
Good night, missy.

628
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,693
Good night, Holt.

629
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,950
I'll see the lady to her mule.

630
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:39,583
- Holt.
- It weren't no hardship, George.

631
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:43,795
Well, let's eat. This smells good.

632
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,047
- Be careful.
- Good evening.

[Clicks Teeth]

634
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,703
Holt, you want my bacon?

635
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,252
I could eat more.

636
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:26,421
Go on then.

637
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,510
Appreciate it.

638
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:36,765
Roedel...

639
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,561
you want my bacon?

640
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:46,691
Yes, I could eat it.

641
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:49,361
Well, I'll shit it out
by the oak tree in the mornin'.

642
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:52,447
You can just go and help yourself.
[Laughing]

643
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,408
[Coughing]

644
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,418
And why, if you do not mind my askin'...

645
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,712
did you not join the regular army?

646
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:11,383
Army? Well, we thought of it.

647
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:15,053
I suppose we decided this fight's
got to be made in our own country...

648
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:18,306
not where some general
tells us it should happen.

649
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:20,850
It soon will be everywhere.

650
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:24,479
My family and I,
we will be quittin' this house in the spring.

651
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:29,150
As soon as the roads are clear,
we're gonna be tryin' for Texas.

652
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:32,112
About half of Missouri
has went to Texas.

653
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:35,240
Well, the whole state's thick with invaders.

654
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:38,535
We cannot drive them away.

655
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:42,163
We have different thoughts.
I still wanna fight.

656
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:46,000
Reckon I'll always want to fight them.

657
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,295
Always.

658
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:58,054
Have you ever been
to Lawrence, Kansas, young man?

659
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:01,141
[Scoffs]
No, I reckon not, Mr. Evans.

660
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,977
I don't believe I'd be
too welcome in Lawrence.

661
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,979
I didn't think so.

662
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,441
Before this war began,
my business took me there often.

663
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,985
As I saw those Northerners
build that town...

664
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,988
I witnessed the seeds
of our destruction being sown.

665
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:19,284
The foundin' of that town was truly
the beginnin' of the Yankee invasion.

666
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,286
I'm not speakin' of numbers...

667
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:25,457
nor even abolitionist trouble-makin'.

668
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,001
It was the schoolhouse.

669
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:32,422
Before they built their church even,
they built that schoolhouse.

670
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:37,302
And they lettered every tailor's son
and every farmer's daughter in that country.

671
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:41,723
Oh, spellin' won't help you
hold a plow any firmer.

672
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,725
Or a gun either.

673
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,977
No, it won't, Mr. Chiles.

674
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:50,982
But my point is merely that they rounded
every pup up into that schoolhouse...

675
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,110
because they fancied
that everyone should think...

676
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:57,447
and talk the same
free-thinkin' way they do...

677
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,450
with no regard to station, custom...

678
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,119
propriety.

679
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:05,663
And that is why they will win.

680
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:09,709
Because they believe everyone
should live and think just like them.

681
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:16,007
And we shall lose because we don't care
one way or another how they live.

682
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,135
We just worry about ourselves.

683
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,098
Are you sayin', sir,
that we fight for nothin'?

684
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,853
Far from it, Mr. Chiles.

685
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:31,606
You fight for everything that we ever had.

686
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,526
As did my son.

687
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:38,446
It's just that we don't have it anymore.

688
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:42,992
Mr. Evans, when you get back from Texas...

689
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,536
it'll all be here waitin' for you.

690
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,955
Jack Bull and me, we'll see to it.

691
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,583
Well, yes.

692
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,379
Thank you, son.

693
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:56,673
Well, enough of this war talk.

694
00:52:56,757 --> 00:53:00,635
Let's have the ladies join us
and think nobler thoughts.

695
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,762
- Lydia!
- [Jack Bull] Fine idea.

696
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,722
Some company would be splendid.

697
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:07,141
Jack Bull, we should be
thinkin' about gettin' back.

698
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:08,393
Federals could pass by anytime.

699
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:11,896
- [Lydia] Sue Lee!
- Oh, put a gown on, Jake. It's too cold.

700
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:14,983
They'll all be in front of the fire
examinin' their plunder, huh?

701
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:20,947
I, um, have it in me to sing.
Shall we have a sing-along?

702
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,575
- Oh, yes. I like those the best.
- [Clearing Throat]

703
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:26,035
My voice is not
what it should be these days...

704
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,288
but it was once rumored
that I could carry a tune.

705
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:29,873
And you, Mr. Roedel?

706
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:33,167
I believe I won't sing.
Young ears are present.

707
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:35,128
- [Chuckles]
- Well, I bet you sing lovely.

708
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:39,173
- You would lose that bet.
- He really does sing very poorly.

709
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,843
- But he imitates the turkey first-rate.
- [Giggles]

710
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,761
I'd best do my gobblin' out of doors.

711
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,556
You folks go ahead and sing along.
I'll keep my eye on the road.

712
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,685
- Do you really think that -
- Good man, Jake. I'll relieve you soon.

I believe he's, uh, fixin' to pass
a few more hours with Miss Juanita.

719
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:11,432
- Jack Bull?
- In the company of Mrs. Sue Lee Evans.

720
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,978
You mean Sue Lee Shelley?

- Roedel.
- Yeah, Holt.

722
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:27,699
What's that?

723
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:30,493
I've been keeping 'em.

724
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,870
Nobody ever learned me letters.

725
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:35,039
When you were readin'
the mails out loud...

726
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:38,292
it was somethin'
the likes of which I'd never heard.

727
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:41,212
Got me thinkin' you might
sometime try it again.

728
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,048
So you packed those
and kept 'em all this time?

729
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:47,969
Well, it might not be too amusin'.

730
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:51,222
It might just be a bunch of borin' thoughts
from one stranger to another.

731
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:55,059
That one you read from the mother was fine.
You recall it?

732
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:56,811
Yeah.

733
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:00,064
Mmm. She say things I enjoy to hear.

I reckon she in Texas.

00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:26,484
How was that?
Was that George that sold her?

758
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:27,902
No, sir.

George and me,
we growed up neighbors.

760
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:34,992
It was George what bought me out
when Master Henry passed, but...

761
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:38,412
he didn't have no means
for my mama or my sister.

- So Clyde owns you?
- No, sir.

00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:38,472
Well, do I look muley to you?

776
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:41,475
[Jack Bull]
Why, no.

777
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,978
Well, does that
look like a mule to you?

778
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:48,649
Does that look like the rear end of
an animal that hee-haws in the night?

779
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:51,986
- Looks like it might could be.
- Jack Bull Chiles!

780
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,698
Just 'cause I'm a widow don't mean
that you can get that familiar with me.

781
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:59,410
Pardon me, ma'am, but I believe it was you
that shoved your rump into my face.

782
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,287
That was only just to make a point.

783
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:05,750
You made it.
I'll always know your rump from a mule's now.

784
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:09,378
Several differences.
Don't know how I missed 'em before.

785
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:15,760
[Gasps]
Well, don't be mean.

786
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:17,970
I can't tolerate meanness.

787

[Whimpering Softly]

788
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,112
- Is that too mean?
- No.

789
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,323
It's really not too mean at all.

790
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:44,664
Oh, for cryin' out loud! We're sittin' right here.
Show us some mercy.

He really is quite right.

792
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,674
Mmm, I better get back to the house.

793
00:59:54,758 --> 01:00:00,346
Cover your tracks in the snow too.
You'll be leadin' curious Federals right onto us.

794
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,474
Don't be rude.
You have no reason to be rude.

795
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,644
There happens to be a war goin' on...

796
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,021
everywhere but between your two ears,
you dumb ox.

797
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:12,608
Dumb ox, am I?
[Grunts]

798
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,740
Sorry, Jake.
My leg just did that on its own.

799
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:21,867
No thought behind it.

800
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,996
I hear you. I hear you.

801
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,456
But Holt and me ain't dyin'
just so you could be kissed.

802
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:31,544
Leave Holt out of this. Holt ain't even here.
Holt ain't nowhere near here.

803
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,880
I don't think anybody's
about to die from my kiss.

804
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,550
In fact, she seems
to be doin' tolerably well.

805
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,011
Well enough to get goin' too.

806
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:42,013
Good day.

807
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:00,323
You reckon George Clyde'll ever
join up with us again?

808
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:04,201
Or do you think Juanita Willard will be
his only cause and comfort from here on?

809
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:08,581
Ah, George is efficient
when it comes to comfort.

810
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,249
Ah!

811
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,877
This thing with Sue Lee and you -
Will it go on?

812
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:14,587
I would reckon.

813
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,006
Well, that's good for you.

814
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,716
Yep.

815
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,801
I believe I'll marry her.

816
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:22,845
I believe you should.

817
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,656
Sue Lee'll be by this evening.

818
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:45,201
Oh, good.
It's been near a week since I've seen her.

819
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:50,581
Yeah, all this warmth has the Federals
out for jaunts. It's kept her home.

820
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:52,833
It won't be long
before we join them out there.

821
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:54,418
No, it won't.

822
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:56,670
That's why I want to ask somethin'
of you and Holt.

823
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:58,255
Name it.

824
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,801
Well, there, future best man,
I'd like to ask you for some privacy.

825
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:06,389
Oh, you would, would you?

826
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:08,599
It's not much to ask.

827
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,601
And what are Holt and me to do?

828
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,353
Anything you'd like.

829
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,939
Throw walnuts at squirrels.
Play mumblety-peg.

830
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:18,442
I reckon we could come up with a better
use of our time than that, eh, Holt?

831
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:20,444
It's possible.

832
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:32,873

I, um, brung you two somethin'.

01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,726
Try this bread, boys.

836
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,147
Why, thank you. Did you make it?

837
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:59,650
No. Mrs. Evans's sister lives in town.

838
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:03,070
She's a Federal, but a sister still.
She gave us two loaves.

839
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:06,991
Well, that's kind of her.
You thank her for us, won't you?

840
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:10,828
[Chuckles] I don't suppose I'll tell her
where it went. That might not do.

and his brothers and all his people,
I stood with George Clyde.

when he bought you out.

In Sparta, they have olives.
