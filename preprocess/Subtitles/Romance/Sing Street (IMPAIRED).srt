Irish people coming to London

in search of work, the crude indications
that do exist show an enormous increase.

London, but still they emigrate

So we had a look at our accounts,

35

and... well, we-we see we
could make a significant saving

36

if we altered the education situation.

- No, no.

We're not taking you out of school.

We're transferring you from one school

- to another school.
- Why?

44
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,832
Because we need to make some
cuts in the budget somewhere.

45

I'd suggest taking
your brother out of college,

Not like your da's band.

326
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,799
Not looking backwards, just forwards.

327
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,117
Oh, cool. Like Depeche Mode?

328
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,517
- Okay.
- Or Joy Division?

329
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,473
Right.

330
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,955
Or Duran Duran?

331
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,913
What do you think of them?

332
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,034
Jury is out on which way those guys'll go.

333
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,554
They're a lot of fun, and James Taylor is
one of the most proficient bass players

334
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,992
in the UK at the moment,
giving them a funky edge.

335
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,671
John Taylor.

336
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,798
Yeah, John. Of course.

337
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,201
I'll be in your band.

338
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,516
I'll play guitar.

339
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,399
And I'll help write songs.

340
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,038
We could rehearse here
'cause my da's in Saint John of Gods.

341
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,754
- Is that a pub?
- No, Darren.

342
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,111
It's a place where alcoholics
go to get off the drink,

343
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,039
stop beating up their wives and kids.

344
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,436
Right.

345
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,075
And neighbors.

346
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,840
Who's gonna be the manager?

347
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,759
Me.

348
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,315
Have you managed bands before?

349
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,034
No, I'm just breaking into the market.

350
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,316
EAMON: Got to get everything straight.

351
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,875
Get everything down on paper first.

352
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,511
Otherwise, the major record labels
can rip you off when they come hunting.

353
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,280
- That's what me da says.
- (SCOFFS)

354
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,516
When'd you want to rehearse?

355
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,439
Not at the weekends.

356
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,314
He's got a job packing shelves
in Quinnsworth on Saturdays.

357
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,955
You're not giving that up
for any band, d'you hear me?

358
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,481
Yeah.

359
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,479
What about Mondays
and Wednesdays after school?

360
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,870
That's fine.

361
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,879
Sounds good.

362
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,435
Now all we need is other musicians.

363
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,716
Do yous know any?

364
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,559
- No.
- Eamon?

365
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,195
He usually just plays on his own.

366
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,277
Don't you, love?

367
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,036
Right, well,
we can't get any peace in here.

368
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,517
Let's continue this meeting outside.

369
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,195
No smoking now.

370
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,312
Ma, how many times do I have to tell you?

371
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,716
I don't smoke.

372
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,076
There's a black guy in 3B.

373
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,601
So?

374
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,633
- Be cool if he was in the band.
- Why?

375
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,479
He's probably the one black guy
in the whole school.

376
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,240
Probably in Dublin.

377
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,273
Having a golliwog in the band
give us a real edge.

378
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,471
You can't say "golliwog."

379
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,796
Why not?

380
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,321
Trust me, you just can't.

381
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,080
And anyway,
what if he can't play anything?

382
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,318
He'll be able
to play something; he's black.

- Can I help you?

385
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,278
Is this the house
where the colored lad lives?

386

How many black people do you think
that lives on this shitty estate?

- Do you know Ngig?
- What's that?

390
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,477
Ngig. My son.

We're putting a band together.
Does he play any instruments?

392
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,913
Why don't you ask him yourself?

393
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,351
(SLOWLY): We are putting

394
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,236
a band together.

395
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,001

Oh, you, um,
sound different from your mam.

398
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,115
Course I do; been here
half me bleedin' life.

399
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,391
What'd you think?

400
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,558
Would you have any interest
in playing in a band?

401
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,160
What kind of music are yous playing?

402
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,994
We're not a hundred percent sure yet,
but do you play any instruments?

403
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,031

The Rabbits?

What's that mean?

420
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,840
It's French for "The Life."

421

00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,553
"Dangerous eyes."

486
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,399
I like that.

487
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,961
What does it mean?

488
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,754
I don't know.

489
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,281
What's the song about, Conor?

490
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:49,034
It's like when you don't know someone,
they're more interesting.

491
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,391
(VOICE-OVER):
They can be anything you want them to be.

492
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,477
EAMON: Yeah.

493
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,833
But when you know them,

494
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,315
there's limits to them.

495
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,637
No, that doesn't make any sense.

496
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,559
What's it called?

497
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,434
"The Riddle of the Model."

498
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,393
So what about a rhythm like this?

499
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,478
(PLAYING QUICK CHORD PROGRESSION)

500
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,359
Nice.

501
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,801
Slow it down a little.

502
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,277
(PLAYING SLOWER)

503
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,518
Yeah.

504
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,917
Yeah, that's cool, that's it.

505
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,317
# Standing on the corner #

506
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,996
# Like an angel in disguise #

507
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,192
# I wanna try and warn her #

508
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,636
# She's got dangerous eyes. #

509
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,876
I've an idea.

510
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,230
Maybe for the chorus, like, a...

511
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,557
(HUMMING MELODY)

512
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,231
(CONOR HUMMING)

513
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,034
Yeah.

514
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,960
(HUMMING)

515
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,152
Yeah. There you can do a stop.

516
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,510
- Yeah.
- And I come in and sing.

517
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,751
# The riddle of the model. #

518
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,076
Like, would everybody stop?

519
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,715
- Yeah. Yeah, everyone.
- Like, the drums

520
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,832
- will do a... (DRUMMING)
- Yeah.

521
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,190
No, yeah. We-we all stop.

522
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,517
- Fireworks and lights and shit. I don't know.
- Yeah.

523
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,200
- Everyone.
- And they all...

524
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,471
- Everyone stops, yeah.
- Crazy shit, that'd be cool.

525
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,115
- I like that.
- Yeah, yeah.

526
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,755
So maybe like a...

527
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,441
# Oh, oh, oh #

528
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,951
# The riddle of the model. #

529
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,481
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I like that. That's good.

530
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,512
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Yeah.

531
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,961
Do you, do you have a hoover?

532
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,316
Check out this effect.

533
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,114
It's like "Video Killed the Radio Star."

534
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,880
Go.

535
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,961
# Standing in the corner #

536
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,516
# Like an angel in disguise... #

537
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,439
CONOR: Hey.

538
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,437
How's it going?

539
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,836
Uh, here's the tape.

540
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,634
What's this?

541
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,957
Oh, that's the song;
I mentioned it to you.

542
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,721
Oh, you're the kid in the band.

543
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,159
Yeah, you should probably
learn the lyrics.

544
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,113
So you can lip-sync to them properly.

545
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,153
We're shooting at the lane
at the back of Quinnsworth.

546
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,914
- You know Quinnsworth?
- Yeah.

547
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,077
This Saturday at 12:00.

548
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,471
Cool. Well, I'll try and make it.

549
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,637
What would I wear?

550
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,956
I don't know.

551
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,475
It's kind of like a Chinese theme.

552
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,274
So, like, a kimono?

553
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,597
Well, it's more like a riff than a song.

554
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,599
(HUMMING)

555
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,873
More of an Eastern bit in the song.

556
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,470
It's called "The Riddle of the Model."

557
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,396
That's really sweet.

558
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,557
(CHUCKLES): Oh.

559
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,394
No, it's not about you.

560
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,000
It's about another model I know.

561
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,555
Oh.

562
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:28,878
Right, well, I'll give it a listen, but I'm,
like, really, really busy at the moment.

563
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,560
You know, so I'll try.

564
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,435
Yeah, you should.
It's a, it's a good song.

565
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,121
We've got a great team.

566
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,193
It's a really good opportunity.

567
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,550
Cool.

568
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,160
So this Saturday at 12:00, then?

569
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,511
12:00. Sounds good.

570
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,791
- Thanks.
- Cool.

571
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,719
Bye.

572
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,594
(CHUCKLES)

573
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,275
Looks like loads of gear
back home, doesn't it?

574
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,439
And yet, strangely,
it just looks like shit here.

575
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,598
- (SPUTTERS)
- Yeah.

576
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,712
Ah, hey, where is this chick?

577
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,600
I don't know.

578
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,190
Who the hell brought a cowboy costume?

579
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,756
Me. It's all I could find.

580
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,998
No one wears a cowboy costume in a band.

581
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,396
There's a cowboy in the Village People.

582
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,477
And Adam Ant.

583
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,319
Adam Ant is a highwayman.

584
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,559
So we can have a highwayman,
but we can't have a cowboy?

585
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,672
Are you mentally ill?

586
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,952
I got fangs in the joke shop.

587
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,760
- What are you gonna do with them?
- (GROWLING)

588
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,958
- It's a music video, not a bleedin' horror film.
- Spanner.

589
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,311
So what did yous bring?

590
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,757
(LAUGHTER)

591
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,315
It's me da's show band outfit.

592
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,591
So it's a gay band?

593
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,711
Okay.

594
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,321
Coming from the one who wants
to look like the Village People.

595
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,835
What's gay about the Village People?

596
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,361
Hello, all. Sorry I'm late.

597
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,035
I was out last night.

598
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,312
At a nightclub.

599
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,671
Jesus Christ, what are you all wearing?

600
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,792
Yeah, we're just working that out.

601
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,400
Um, maybe you can help.

602
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,035
Well, who's your costume person?

603
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,273
We don't really have a costume person.

604
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,312
Well, who's your cameraman?

605
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,671
Maybe he can make some of this work.

606
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,440
Well, we don't really have...

607
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,631
I'm the cameraman.

608
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,956
Thought you were the producer.

609
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,310
And the cameraman.

610
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,080
Saving money at all costs, yeah.

611
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,555
What'd you think of the song?

612
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,796
I really liked it.

613
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,560
It's the only reason I'm here.

614
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,831
Did you write it?

615
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,395
Eamon wrote most of the music.

616
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,875
So you wrote the lyrics?

617
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,116
Cool.

618
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,275
You've got really good cheekbones.

619
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,721
- What?
- Yeah.

620
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,561
Yeah, you should let me do your makeup.

621
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,798
- Really?
- Yeah. Now this light's gonna be

622
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:46,991
really harsh on camera.

623
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,561
It'll take the edge off.

624
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,240
I'm actually wearing some right now.

625
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,235
In fact, you should all be wearing makeup.

626
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,715
DARREN: Yeah, I'm not wearing any makeup.

627
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,634
RAPHINA:
Relax, you're not even in the band.

628
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,240
Yeah, thank God.

629
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,560
I'm in the band, and I will not
be wearing any makeup. Thank you.

630
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,075
Why? You've got great lips.

631
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,521
No, piss off. I'm not wearing makeup.

632
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,274
Whatever.

633
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,199
Those of you who actually
care about the band

634
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,995
and want to do this half
properly, queue over there.

635
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,875
Okay, so we're playing over here,

636
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,594
and Raphina's standing
over there against the wall.

637
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,280
I go up to you and start singing to you.

638
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:21,760
Make sure to pan up to her eyes when I
sing the line, "She's got dangerous eyes."

639
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,395
I think a zoom would be better.

640
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,080
Okay, a zoom, whatever.

641
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,275
Do you think I should have, lightning
flashes on my eyelids when I close 'em?

642
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,391
Can you do that?

643
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,636
I can do anything.

644
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,195
Cool.

645
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,711
So then for the chorus,
you walk off and I follow,

646
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,511
circling you like when he's

00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,597
I don't know.

What are you doing?

814
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,913
Just, just rabbit stuff.

00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,515
D'you want to write a new song?

816
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,712
Yes, I do.

00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,036

818
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,914

You see how bass guitar and the bass
pedal are playing the same rhythm?

I told all of yous, you especially,

You can't put rabbits on the bed

Yeah, go get the guitar; let's try it out.

It-it'll sound better on the acoustic.

Oh, well.

00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,394

00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,035
the-the one you mentioned
about brown shoes...

901
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:39,236

makeup or altering hair color.

Oh, and look.

Head down to the toilet
and remove the makeup right now.

905
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,072
- Why?
- Because I told you to.

906
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,476
But I'm in a band.

907
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,954
It's a school band, and I think
it's important that we have a look.

908
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,834
You're a man. Men don't wear makeup.

909
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,361
But why not?

910
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,598
People in the 18th century wore makeup.

911
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,677
That means people like Mozart
wore makeup, and he was a man.

912
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,191
So you're Mozart now, are you?

913
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,432
That makes me Salieri, is it?

914

Who's Salieri?

915

You've a fine face.

916

Pretty enough without makeup.

917

Cosmo. That's what I'm calling you now.

Why would I be jealous?

Exactly.

969
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,271
Will you write me a happy song sometime?

970
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:06,676
I need a laugh.

971
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,155
But what if I don't feel happy?

972
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:13,071
Your problem is that you're
not happy being sad.

00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,751
We only have a half hour
dinner window in our house.

977
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,872
So, what's the house like, where you live?

978
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,441
It's nice.

979
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:36,440
Nicer than some of the dumps
I've lived in.

980
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:39,679
So where are your parents?

981
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:40,911
My dad's brown bread.

982
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,317
He got hit by a car.

983
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,512
Oh, my God. Sorry.

984
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,638
Really don't be.

985
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,559
He was a drunk. He deserved it.

986
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:52,560
And me ma's in and out of hospital.

987
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,081
Why?

988
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,476
She's a nurse.

989
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,115
Oh, right.

990
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,551
No, she's manic-depressive.

991
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,118
So, like, happy-sad.

992
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:09,676
You're funny, I like that.

993
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:14,401
Well, let me know if you need me
for any more videos before I go.

994
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,596
When are you going?

995
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,354
Soon.

996
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,559
CONOR (VOICE-OVER):
What did she mean by that?

997
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:39,159
Well, I think what she means is that
you need to reach a place in your life

998
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,795
where you're okay with your sadness.

999
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,196
It's pretty high concept stuff.

1000
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,590
How old d'you say she was again?

1001
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:44,632
Sixteen.

1002
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,081
It's monastic.

1003
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,231
She's like a monk.

1004
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:49,432
She sounds really pretentious.

1005
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,996
Why, 'cause she wants to leave
school and follow her vocation?

1006
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,721
You call wanting to be a model a vocation?

1007
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,514
Anything can be a vocation, Ann.

1008
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:59,759
Being a taxi driver,
being a bin man, being a poet,

1009
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,992
being a singer, being an artist.

1010
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,397
Brendan, I never wanted to be an artist.

1011

We couldn't get the brush out of your hand
when you were a kid.

1012
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:08,791
What is wrong with being an architect?

1013
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,150
It's not a vocation.

1014
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,591
I thought everything was a vocation.

1015
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,439
Don't be playing word games with me, Ann.

1016
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,991
I don't do "words," all right?

1017
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:19,317
Come on, Conor.

1018
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,519
Turn out the lights
before you go to bed, Ann.

1019
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,360
So her dad's dead
and her mam is a lunatic.

1020
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,835
And you thought you had problems.

1021
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:32,432
I see now what the older
boyfriend thing is about.

1022
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,439
Daddy issues.

1023
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,075
I used to know chicks like this.

1024
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,352
They're tricky, and they need
a lot of protecting.

1025
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,710
Are you up to that, Conor?

1026
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,117
I don't know.

1027
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:44,153
So what's it all about?

1028
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:47,513
I think she's just an amazing human being.

1029
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:50,759
I've never seen anyone like her.

1030
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,237
The way she talks and looks.

1031
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:58,391

and when she takes them off, her eyes

are like the clouds

Yeah, how am I supposed to market that?

1041
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,640
It means we're not pop anymore.

1042
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,081
We were pop?

1043
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,351
Listen, I'm happy being anything.

1044
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,915
I just want to play music.

Well, I don't know who I am.

00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,270
Maybe I'm happy-sad, too.

1049

I don't know.

1050

What does happy-sad even mean?

1051
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:49,319
How can we be both things?
It makes no sense.

1052
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:51,080
It means that I'm stuck in this shithole

1053

full of morons and rapists and bullies,
and I'm gonna deal with it, okay?

It's just how life is.

1055
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,552
I'm gonna try and accept it
and get on with it

1056
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,911
and make some art.

1057
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,395
So how does that affect our music?

Okay.

So the idea of this video is about a guy
standing halfway down a pier,

and a beautiful woman walks past him
towards the lighthouse.

She killed herself.

1069
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,760
No, she's a mermaid,
and she's jumped back into the sea.

1070
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:59,786
You see, she got washed up in
a fishing net so she's been in the city,

1071
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:02,792

to the water, to her friends.

they're jumping in or something?

when he was younger.

1138

But my parents would never let him go
without finishing school.

the whole thing planned, so he says.

So what happened?

1141

in hospital, in a spell,

1149

and it was just the two of us.

1150
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,398
So I'd get all dressed up
to go out with my friends,

1151
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:06,080
then he'd make me stay in.

1152
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:07,555
And afterwards, he'd say,

1153

"I love you too much, is all."

1154

And the thing is, me ma's
much better-looking than I am,

1155
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,120
so I don't really know
why he'd bother with me.

(SEAGULLS CHIRPING)

1290
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:45,278
Okay, so go.

1291
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:48,281
"You just can't stand the way
that we walked out from the wreckage."

1292
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:50,040
What wreckage?

1293
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,356
Maybe the wreckage of family.

1294
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:52,716
That's what I was thinking about.

1295
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,037
Okay, next.

1296
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:59,871
"You just can't stand the way
that I turned my life around."

1297
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:02,516
That's about you.

1298
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,678
What do you mean?

1299
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:09,312
Well, I was thinking about my parents
and how I thought I had problems.

1300
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,432
And the way you've turned
your life around.

1301
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,393
How have I turned my life around?

You're going to a new country.

1303

You've got a vocation. You look amazing.

1304

- Stop.
- Stop what?

1305
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:24,034
Just get on with the song.
What's the video gonna be about?

1306
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:28,959
So... I think it's set at a school prom,
like in an American high school.

1307
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,277
I've always wanted to go
to an American school.

1308
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:33,392

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

1310

Have you seen "Back to the Future"?

1311
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:37,999
I see all the films.

1312
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:41,080
Imagine the band, all in suits.

1313
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,431
I have all the shots planned in my head.

1314
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:45,234
My brother told me to think big.

1315
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:47,717
And what if I come in a big '50s dress?

1316
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,275
Yeah.

1317
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:52,553
And the whole crowd parts
and everyone disappears.

1318
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:56,117
And then we all break out
into this big dance routine,

1319
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,198
and everyone is there.

1320
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:02,238
And then you and I
just run off into the night

1321
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:05,320
with the twinkling lights
of the city behind us.

1322
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:10,439
You were a bit attractive back there.

1323
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:12,718
Back where?

1324
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,481
On the boat.

1325
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,080
Thank you.

1326
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:19,318
Just a little bit.

1327
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,871
Bit like a captain.

1328
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:24,311
I like that.

1347
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:58,681
I can explain, see...

1348
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:00,679
It's not about your exams, Conor.

1349

We need to talk to all of you. Sit down.

1350

make a big deal about this, you know.

1351
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:10,951
It's something we've thought about a lot.

1352

Thank you. That's great.

1358

Why don't you sit down,
Brendan, for a second?

1359

It's half what it's worth,
but we're gonna take it.

I can't afford to live here on my own.

so we'll be legally separated.

there.

I'm not gonna be staying at Tony's.

I was sort of hoping they'd come
to my gig at the end of the month.

1383
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,198
What, you thought they'd just
become different people

1384
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:34,115
and start noticing what you were doing
and what you wanted?

They've got their own shit going on.
They're not going to your stupid gig.

1386

So why is it stupid now?

1387

It's not that it's stupid,
it's just annoying.

through the jungle that is our mad family.

1400

You think they're crazy now?

1402
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:24,280
Think about what they were like
when they were in their late 20s.

1403
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:27,155
Two Catholics in a rented flat
with a screaming baby,

who just got married because
they wanted to have sex.

1405

They didn't even love each other.

I was in the middle of that, alone.

1407
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,476
And then you came along.

1408
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,433
Thank God!

1409
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,518

And people laugh at me, Conor.
