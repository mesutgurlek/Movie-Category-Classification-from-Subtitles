Oh, I'm terribly sorry I'm so late.

Good evening, Mrs. Hamilton.

162
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,729
But I was delayed Christmas shopping.

163
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,890
Good evening, Mr. Perry,
Mrs. Trumbull.

164
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,025
Hello, Mrs. Ward.

165
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,732
I hope you've been having
a good meeting.

166
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,896
We have not.

167
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,157
I've never in my life encountered
such fuzzy thinking.

168
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,069
- Do you think we've made any progress?
- No, Mrs. Hamilton.

169
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,705
Mr. Perry was about
to tell us something.

170
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,163
Merely a suggestion. If Mrs. Hamilton
approves, we might be able...

171
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,749
...to place the George B. Hamilton
Memorial Chapel here on the northeast.

172
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,585
It would be completely out of sight.
I won't stand for it.

173
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,003
Mrs. Hamilton, this cathedral cannot be
designed for the glory of an individual.

174
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,047
It has to be created for all the people.

175
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,925
I'm very displeased at your attitude,
Henry Brougham.

176
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,389
I was instrumental
in having you made bishop...

177
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,429
...although others
thought you too young.

178
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,475
- Is that an exaggeration?
- Oh, yes, Mrs.-- I mean, no.

179
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,940
- You were the guiding spirit.
- I distinctly remember that you told--

180
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,778
I had confidence in you when you
were a poor little parson in the slums.

181
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,942
I confess my confidence is weakened.

182
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,031
I regret
I've been such a disappointment.

183
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,493
HAMILTON: Regrets and apologies
are no good whatsoever.

184
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:53,035
You give me the impression of being
confused, indecisive and ineffectual.

185
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,456
That is not the kind of leadership
we expect of our bishop.

186
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,340
You better remember one thing.

187
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,798
You will build that cathedral as I want it,
or you will not build it at all.

188
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,179
That's all I have to say.

189

Julia, you knew that Mrs. Hamilton
was expected here this afternoon.

199

I know, Henry.

I'm sorry I was late.

201
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,975
What a ghastly afternoon.
What a ghastly woman.

202
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,182
I have no intention of being strangled
by her purse strings.

203
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,846
She did and I was proud of you.

204
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,812
I had a most un-Christian impulse
to take those blueprints...

205
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,569
...and give her a good whack
over the mink coat.

206

I thought you stood up to her
magnificently.

207
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,525
I appreciate your appreciation,
but what about my cathedral?

208
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,694
May I make a suggestion, Henry?

209
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,034
Why not postpone the cathedral?
Forget it until after Christmas.

210
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,041
Impossible.
The house of God can't just be put off.

211
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,044
This cathedral must rise.
Plenty of rich people in this town.

enthusiasm...

of their Yuletide spirit.

And you, you there, ﬂattering them...

...kowtowing to them, begging them.
- it's got to be done.

Oh, Henry, if you could see
your poor harassed face.

219

He says it's urgent.

What's happened to us
and our marriage?

We used to have such fun,
you and Debby and I.

we used to make other people happy.

You're no financier

Ought to look magnificent
up there on the top of Sanctuary Hill.

311
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,684
Well, Henry,
do you believe I am what I say I am?

312
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,845
Well, how can I?
I've only got your word for it.

313
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,436
But you're a bishop. You, of all people,
can trust the word of an angel.

314
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,351
I'd like to.

315
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,278
What do you--?
What do you propose to do?

316
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,610
- Perform a miracle?
- if necessary.

317
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,778
Why don't, you? Why don't you create
the cathedral with one wave of your hand?

318
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,743
You wouldn't want me to do that.
How would you explain it?

319
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,951
Well, I--

320
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,493
Tell the world you're being visited
by an angel?

321
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,877
You can't do that.

322
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,545
Henry, is anything wrong? I--

323
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,801
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know that you--

324
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,632
HENRY:
Julia, if you don't mind.

325
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,717
How do you do, Julia?

326
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,972
I'm Dudley.

327
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,851
Henry is engaging me
to help him with his work.

328
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,227
You mean
you're going to be his assistant?

329
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,733
That's it. I'm going to try to help Henry
to rest and get some relaxation.

330
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,394
- That's what I've been praying for.
- You too?

331
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,483
Oh, Henry, I'm so relieved.

332
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,365
- You found someone to help you.
- Yes, but--

333
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,822
- Where do you come from, Dudley?
- Oh, all around.

334
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,159
- Yes, but where?
- Julia, to tell you the truth...

335
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,323
...he says he's an--

336
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,330
I've been doing some social service work
downtown.

337
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,620
Now you're gonna be with Henry
permanently?

338
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,335
For as long as may be necessary.

339
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,171
If you don't mind,
I must talk to this gentleman alone.

340
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,302
- I'll see you in a moment.
- Sure.

341
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,340
Oh, we were just having dinner,
won't you join us?

342
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,680
That's very kind of you,
but I have things to do around town.

343
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,347
You can understand, Henry,
so many people making so many mistakes.

344
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,889
Yes, I see.

345
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,353
Then we'll see you tomorrow?

346
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,189
- Oh, yes, bright and early.
- Good.

347
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,650
Whenever you're ready, Henry.

348
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,698
Good night, Dudley.

349
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,734
Good night, Julia.

350
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,867
Are you sure you're an angel?

351
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,208
I know it isn't easy, Henry,
but you've just got to take me on faith.

352
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,874
- Yes, for how long? How long will it take?
- For just long enough...

353
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:47,637
...until you can utter another prayer and say
that you have no further need of me.

354
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,050
Then I'll be gone and forgotten.

355
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,969
But now Julia is waiting for you
at the dining table.

356
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,137
You must go to her.

357
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,101
Yes.

358
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,901
But I don't--

359
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,070
- Henry.
- Yes?

360
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,732
What's the rest of Dudley's name?

361
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,159
I don't know.

362
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,619
Are you nervous, dear?

363
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,121
No.

364
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,107
Why, the bishop didn't
eat his breakfast.

365
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,268
No. He took only his prune juice.

366
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,653
Prune juice?
What's the matter? Is he sick?

367
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:32,067
Oh, he looked perfectly awful.
He said he had a very bad, sleepless night.

368
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,286
Passing up a breakfast like that.

369
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,242
It just ain't normal.

370
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,330
Nobody expects him to be normal,
he's a bishop.

371
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,389
If I could get you something, sir?

372
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,765
No, thank you, Matilda.

373
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,928
- Maybe just a cup of tea?
- Nothing, thank you.

374
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,102
- Good morning, Miss Cassaway.
- Good morning, bishop.

375
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,192
[SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]

376
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,569
Did anything come in
for the cathedral fund?

377
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,447
Mr. and Mrs. J. Thurston Ward,
no contribution.

378
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,700
- Mrs. Gerald Wilmarth, $15.
- Fifteen dollars?

379
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,861
We had her down for 10,000.

380
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,076
CASSAWAY: There's a letter
from her explaining that--

381
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,082
I know. The same letter they all write.

382
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:26,041
I put the personal mail on the desk, bishop.
The rest I'm taking to the office.

383
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,751
I'll be there after the meetings.

384
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,116
Oh, Matilda,
I think there's someone at the door.

385
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,119
Yes, sir.

386
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,499
Good morning, Matilda.
I'm Dudley, the bishop's new assistant.

387
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,751
Good morning, Henry.
It's a wonderful morning.

388
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,084
I'm a little late, but I stopped to chat
with a traffic policeman...

389
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,374
...who was worried about his wife.

390
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,418
Oh, thank you. Thank you, dear.

391
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,087
I directed traffic
while he telephoned the hospital.

392
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,383
- I see.
- She's doing fine. So is the baby.

393
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,768
Why, you must be Mildred Cassaway.

394
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,646
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

395
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,433
- We're going to be working together.
CASSAWAY: That's very nice.

396
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,772
Oh, thank you.

397
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,938
- Thank you very much.
DUDLEY: See you later, Mildred.

398
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,071
Well, ready for duty.

399
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,654
Completely at your service.

400
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,582
No, no.

401
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,997
- I feel it--
- No.

402
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,293
Good morning, Julia.

403
00:25:56,472 --> 00:26:00,056
Oh, good morning, Dudley.
It's a lovely day, isn't it?

404
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,971
- Lovely.
- Henry and I are going out together.

405
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,637
I'm terribly sorry,
but I have some appointments.

406
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,146
- You what?
- Mr. Trevor, I gotta see him and then...

407
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,274
...the board meeting, junior assembly.

408
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,186
- But don't you remember? You promised--
- Yeah, I know I did.

409
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:17,152
Well, Dudley could represent you
at those meetings, couldn't he?

410
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,908
Could I?

411
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:24,786
No, out of the question. They expect me.
It would never do if I sent an assistant.

412
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,834
Excuse me.

413
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,329
Now--

414
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:42,507
- You see, the trouble is I can't explain.
- You needn't try to explain, Henry.

415
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,392
- This is the way it is and will always be.
- What--?

416
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,724
We've just got to get used to it,
that's all.

417
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:51,641
I'll tell Matilda she can have the day off
for shopping, I'll take care of Debby.

418
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,532
Oh, I see that
Mrs. George B. Hamilton...

419
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,371
...has pledged $1 million,
but has not yet sent her check.

420
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,709
Never mind those cards.
That's work for a bookkeeper, not an--

421
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,919
Work for a bookkeeper.

422
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,542
So you're beginning
to believe in me, huh?

423
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,633
I don't know who you are,
where you came from, or who sent you.

424
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,390
I just wish you'd make haste.
There's no time to lose.

425
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,895
- Because the cathedral must be built?
- Obviously, that's the most important thing.

426
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,556
Or because Julia must be happy?

427
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:35,943
Henry, it's difficult for me to help you
until I'm sure what it is you really want.

428
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,354
I've got the-- And then there's...

429
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,481
Oh!

430
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,625
Would you mind telling me
what you intend to do now?

431
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,090
This card index file is in an awful mess.
Think I'll reorganize it.

432
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,596
You're wasting your time
on unimportant details.

433
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,756
Nothing's unimportant.

434
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,768
Remember, we are interested
even in the lowliest sparrow.

435
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,947
- Hello, Debby.
- Are you Dudley?

436
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,153
Yes. How did you know?

437
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,786
Mommy told me.
She said you came to help Daddy.

438
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,996
That's right.

439
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,290
Mommy said you were very nice.

440
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,168
Well, that's extremely kind of Mommy.

441
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:20,252
Mommy said that maybe with you here,
maybe we'll get to see Daddy sometimes.

442
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:24,339
DUDLEY: Maybe we will.
- That'll be enough out of you, Debby.

443
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,005
I asked Matilda to put your lunch
on a tray for you.

444
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,298
Thank you, Julia. 
I'll get along very well.

445
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,433
I'm sure you will. Come on, dear.

446
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,686
- Goodbye, Dudley.
- Goodbye, Debby.

447
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,097
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

448
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,147
- Oh. Oh, thank you, Matilda.
- Aren't you going to wear a hat?

449
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,158
- I never use one.
- Oh, it's very cold out.

450
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,239
Oh, well, the cold never affects me. I--

451
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,575
I think you should wear this anyway.

452
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:37,083
- I bought it for the bishop last Christmas.
- Well. Really?

453
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,085
- But he's never worn it.
- Oh, it's a lovely scarf, Matilda.

454
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,496
Bishop will appreciate it
when he sees it on me.

455
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,915
- Yes.
- Well, thank you. Goodbye.

456
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,754
Bye.

457
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,466
Goodbye.

458
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,233
- Oh, what's the matter, honey?
- They don't want me.

459
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,278
- Oh, why not?
- I guess I'm too little or something.

460
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,073

you must tell Debby about him.

614
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,998
She's just beginning
to be a little bit doubtful.

615
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,750
[LAUGHS]

616
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,959
You like that hat.

617
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,546
JULIA:
Yes, I'm crazy about it.

618
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:53,130
- Come on, let's go in and buy it.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.

619
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,548
Why, it's much too...

620
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,717
Too what? Too attractive?
Nothing could be--

621
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,557
- Why, my old friend, the professor.
- Hello, professor.

622
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:03,975
- Julia. Are you with this man?
- Yes, of course. It's Dudley.

623
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,359
The professor knows me.
University of Vienna.

624
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,440
Yes, I've been thinking about that.

625
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,107
I don't believe you've been in Vienna
in your life.

626
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,776
A game we play.
He pretends he's never seen me before.

627
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,490
I don't knew who he is, Julia,
but I don't trust him.

628
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,405
Professor, he's Henry's new assistant.

629
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:22,292
- Oh, you mean you know this fellow?
- Of course, I do.

630
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,078
Well, in that case...

631
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,338
...how about dropping into my humble
diggings for Yuletide cheer?

632
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,717
Oh, no, no. I have to go home. I--

633
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:35,344
- Well, perhaps just for a few minutes.
- Good. Come along.

634
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,058
There's a little sherry left.

635
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,599
It's rather inferior grade, but potable.

636
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,144
Professor,
I see you're quite a religious man.

637
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:51,609
- What makes you think that?
- You have an angel on your tree.

638
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,694
Well, Julia gave me that years ago.

639
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,906
- Why, your tree is beautiful, professor.
- it's disgraceful.

640
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,119
However, it gives me the illusion
of peace on earth, good will toward men.

641
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,532
To a charming lady.

642
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,916
- Thank you.
- Lovely.

643
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,077
You've noticed?

644
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,962
- Isn't it more remarkable that you have?
- Remarkable?

645
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,751
When you wanna know about a woman,
ask the old men, they know.

646
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,844
Why don't you show us the manuscript
of your book, professor? Will you?

647
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,474
- My book?
- Yes, please.

648
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:21,760
Oh, no, no, no.

649
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,181
- You're writing one?
- Yes.

650
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,105
You didn't know?

651
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,402
You didn't tell me.

652
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,563
I described that book in detail...

653
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,654
...in the course of lectures I gave
at the university in Vienna.

654
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:41,664
All my pupils heard me. Now I'm
certain this fellow's an impostor.

655
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,746
Oh, that book? I thought
you'd finished that years ago.

656
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,535
I'll tell you--

657
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,787
I'll tell you about my book.

658
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,002
For 20 years I've been talking about it.

659
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,793
I've been promising the publishers
that it would be delivered next spring.

660
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:58,259
The funny part of it is, in all that time,
I haven't written one word.

661
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,595
- Not one word.
- Why not?

662
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,930
I couldn't think of anything original
to say.

663
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:07,644
Just the same old monotonous history,
dry as dust.

664
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,943
That's the whole story of my life.

665
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,695
Frustration.

666
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:17,859
It's a chronic disease
and it's incurable.

667
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,029
Once I was madly--

668
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:32,415
Once I was madly in love with a girl.

669
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,797
My friends, she was a vision of delight.

670
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,837
- A pure enchantress.
- Why, you've never told me about that.

671
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,301
No, that's just the trouble.

672
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,056
I never told her about it either.
I couldn't find the words.

673
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,846
So she married an athlete.

674
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:52,689
A great hulking oaf
who never even reached the eighth grade.

675
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,488
But he knew how to say, "I love you."

676
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:03,202
Same trouble as my book,
can't find the words.

677
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:08,162
Even when you had this coin
to inspire you?

678
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:12,212
Why, that's the one
that you gave to Henry, professor.

679
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,998
Yes, I stole it off the table.

680
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,213
You wasted your time, Dudley.
It's worthless.

681
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:21,596
Oh, on the contrary, this is one
of the rarest of all antiquities.

682
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:26,101
Only 100 of these coins were minted
by Julius Caesar 2000 years ago.

683
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,432
That was when Cleopatra visited Rome.

684
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,564
Presumably, these coins were used
to pay her hotel bill.

685
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:32,769
I never knew that.

686
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:36,437
No, nobody knew about it
except Caesar's wife.

687
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,946
- She was suspicious?
- Definitely.

688
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:43,156
She did not share her husband's
admiration for Cleopatra.

689
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,913
So she had these coins destroyed,
melted into ornaments for herself.

690
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,165
This is the one she missed.

691
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:54,671
It's an unwritten chapter in history,
and you, professor, will write it.

692
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,957
Do you know more stories like that?

693
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,799
Oh, any number of them.

694
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,927
You're a curious fellow, Dudley.

695
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,384
Have you just begun to notice that?

696
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,765
What's your background?

697
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:10,221
- Uh, my background?
- Well, where do you come from?

698
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,810
- Well...
- And don't tell me any more about Vienna...

699
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,270
...I won't believe it.

700
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,433
All right.

701
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,569
Supposing I told you I came
from another planet. You believe me?

702
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,153
- I don't know.
- I'd believe you, Dudley.

703
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,488
And you'd be right, Julia, as always.

704
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,699
We all come from our own little planets.

705
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:30,411
That's why we're all different.
That's what makes life interesting.

706
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,508
We don't seem to be making
any headway.

707
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:53,104
First star I see tonight.

708
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,724
You must make a wish, Julia.

709
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,396
Oh, it's getting dark. It must be late.

710
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,485
Henry will be worried.
We must be leaving.

711
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,493
- Oh, no.
JULIA: I'm sorry, professor, but we must.

712
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,739
- Dudley.
- Yes, my friend.

713
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,533
There's one thing that troubles me.

714
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,168
- One thing I wish I knew.
- What's that?

715
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:18,956
Well, I'm an old man.
That history is a tremendous task.

716
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:23,001
I wonder, will I have time to finish it?

717
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:26,137
You'll finish your history, professor.
You'll have time.

718
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,513
I believe you, Dudley.

719
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:35,306
For quite a while now,
every time I passed a cemetery...

720
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,895
...I felt as if I were
apartment hunting.

721
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,021
Good bye, professor.

722
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,648
You've given an old man
a very happy afternoon.

723
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,067
- Thank you.
- God bless you both.

724
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:51,864
Thank you.
I'll pass that recommendation along.

725
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,464
Oh, my, that's pretty.

726
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,470
Take some of that pink stuff
and make curlicues with it.

727
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,891
I hope dinner won't be spoiled.

728
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,099
MATILDA: Oh, no, sir. I had a sort of feeling
that they might be late.

729
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,765
Yes. Very considerate of you.

730
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,603
MATILDA: Yes.
- Who's that cake for?

731
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,314
MATILDA: What cake?
- The cake behind you.

732
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,611
Oh, that cake? Oh, for anybody
who might like cake, sir.

733
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,947
But you know neither Mrs. Brougham
nor myself like these desserts.

734
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:15,785
Oh, but we baked you
an egg custard, sir.

735
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,918
DUDLEY:
Hello.

736
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,792
Oh, hello, dear.
I'm sorry we were late for dinner.

737
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,506
- Good evening.
- We've had the most marvelous time.

738
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,921
- Oh, I wish you'd been with us.
- I wish I had.

739
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,431
- Debby told me about the snow fight.
- Oh, did she?

740
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:38,266
We went to see Professor Wutheridge
and then we had lunch at Michel's.

741
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,646
- Is Debby in bed?
- No, she's waiting to see you.

742
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,308
Good. Well, I'll just go up
and say good night to her.

743
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:46,478
I won't be a minute.
I just wanna see if she's all right.

744
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,530
I trust you spent a
profitable afternoon.

745
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,697
Oh, yes. Did you have
a profitable afternoon, Henry?

746
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,666
Not very.

747
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:04,170
I'd like to see you for a moment.

748
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,956
Certainly.

749
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,128
Excuse me.

750
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,311
Can you prove to me
that you are an angel?

751
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,567
Proof? You mean a document?

752
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:31,106
Why, surely, you of all people should know
that an angel needs no passport.

753
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,695
I wanna see you perform a miracle.

754
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,610
- What kind?
- Well...

755
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,029
...make this desk rise up
and fly around the room.

756
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:42,201
Please, Henry. I didn't come down here
to do silly tricks. I'm surprised at you.

757
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,415
I don't believe you're an angel.

758
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,875
I think you're a demon right out of--

759
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:50,337
Oh, Henry. Don't say that.

760
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:55,050
- Well, anyway, you know how I feel.
- Yes.

761
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,720
Now, wait a minute, Dudley,
there's another thing.

762
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,804
Oh, dinner is served, bishop.

763
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,905
Thank you, Dudley.

Oh, yes, that's true.
Well, once upon a time...

806
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:09,009
...there was a little boy
and he lived in a little town.

807
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,395
- What was his name?
- His name was David. He was a shepherd.

808
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,805
And the town where he lived
was called Bethlehem.

DEBBY: Oh, I know Bethlehem,
that's where the star was.

810
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:21,192
That's right.
Only David lived long before the star.

811
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,232
Well, one night, David was out in the hills
tending his sheep.

812
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,117
He was playing the harp and singing.

813
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,448
What was he singing? "Jingle Bells"?

814
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:32,081
Ha, ha. No, no. No, "Jingle
Bells" hadn't been written then.

815
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:34,663
David was singing songs
that he wrote himself.

816
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:38,171
Well, suddenly, an angel came down
and spoke to David.

817
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,503
- How did David know it was an angel?
- Ah, he didn't know.

818
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:43,293
And that's the way it always is.

819
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,053
Angels come down
and put ideas into people's heads...

820
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:50,387
...then people feel proud of themselves,
they think it was all their own idea.

821
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,848
Well, this angel said to David:

822
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,137
"One of your lambs has strayed."

823
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:59,400
So David put aside his harp and went out
in the darkness to find the lamb.

824
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,311
Of course, the angel guided him.

825
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:06,783
And when David found the lamb,
he saw a great, big ferocious lion.

826
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,317
Oh!

827
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,613
So David said to the lion,
“You get away from that lamb!"

828
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:15,749
And the lion said, “You get away
from me or I'll eat you too!"

829
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,159
Did David run away?

830
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,044
No. You know why?

831
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,581
Because the angel put another idea
into his head.

832
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,500
So David took out his sling...

833
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:27,090
...and he hurled a stone
and hit the lion right between the eyes.

834
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,847
I bet that lion was surprised. Ha-ha-ha.

835
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,758
Yeah. And so was David.

836
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,051
Because he didn't know
an angel had helped him.

837
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,354
Well, he picked up the lamb
and took it back to the fold...

838
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,607
...and then he felt so happy
that he made up another song.

839
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,394
It started out:

840
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:46,189
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want;

841
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,900
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

He leadeth me beside
the still waters;

of Saint George suggest my late husband.

917
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:28,971
Yes.

918
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:33,017
- Who do you see as the dragon?
- Oh, any dragon.

919
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:35,186
Now, let's get the blueprints.

920
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,025
Mrs. Hamilton, as we're now
in such complete agreement...

921
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,783
...would you mind
if we postponed the discussion?

922
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,818
Julia's waiting for me at St. Timothy's.

923
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:46,330
Very well. We can go over the plans
when we send for transfer of funds.

924
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,084
Thank you so much. And I'm so glad
we've settled our differences.

925
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,374
Is anything the matter?

926
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:59,509
Why, it doesn't seem quite right,
does it?

927
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,717
Oh, but-- Oh, Stevens.

928
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:06,680
There's something wrong
about the bishop's chair.

929
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:10,267
Oh, madam, it must be the new varnish.

930
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,102
The finisher should have warned us.

931
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,901
I do hope I'm not harming the chair.

932
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,028
Oh, no, no, not at all.

933
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:22,362
Send to a furniture shop, or a plumber's
or get turpentine. Do something, Stevens.

934
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:25,119
Yes, madam. Oh, dear.

935
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,615
- I wonder--
- Would you give it a pull at the back?

936
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:29,873
Yes, yes.

937
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,878
Thank you.

938
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,967
It's been a long time
since Henry's been down here.

939
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,307
I wish he had come.

940
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,939
You know, when he was here,
he was so close to people...

941
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:56,350
...so loved by everybody.
- Uh-huh.

942
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:58,235
And how does it seem to you now?

943
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:01,523
In dreaming of his cathedral,
he's moved away from people he loved?

944
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,190
Yes.

945
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,906
It's gonna be such a disappointment
for Reverend Miller not to see him.

946
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,913
Oh, well, he doesn't have
to be disappointed.

947
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:15,248
- Hello, Mr. Miller.
- Mrs. Brougham, so good of you to come.

948
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:19,131
Not at all. I'm delighted to be here.
This is Mr. Dudley, bishop's assistant.

949
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:21,668
- Mr. Dudley, a pleasure.
- Thank you, Mr. Miller.

950
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:24,086
The bishop will try to get here later,
Mr. Miller.

951
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:28,349
- Something important came up.
- Oh, of course, he's a busy man now.

952
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,849
Yes.

953
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,103
- This is Mrs. Duffy.
- I know Mrs. Duffy. How are you?

954
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:35,560
It's an honor to have you here
at St. Timothy's.

955
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:37,645
Thank you. And this is Mr. Dudley.

956
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,150
Mrs. Duffy is the organist.

957
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:41,608
Oh, I'm sure
Mrs. Duffy plays enchantingly.

958
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,862
Hello, Mrs. Duffy.

959
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:46,242
MILLER: I'm afraid some of our boys
are a little late.

960
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,945
We really should begin,
but I don't see how we can.

961
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,239
It's really quite embarrassing.

962
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:57,412
But, you know, it is a little difficult to
compete with basketball and Christmas.

963
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:59,250
They're all good boys at heart.

964
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,540
I know they are. They'll show up.

965
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,584
MILLER:
I hope so.

966
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,754
- Hello, Bobby.
- Hello.

967
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,802
DUDLEY: What do you sing?
- I sing first soprano.

968
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,967
DUDLEY: Are you good?
- I don't know.

969
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,682
DUDLEY: Well, how about giving out?
- Me alone?

970
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,972
DUDLEY: Well, you got George up there.
Hello, George.

971
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,141
- Hello.
DUDLEY: Well, what do you say?

972
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,230
Well, okay.

973
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,320
DUDLEY: Are you ready, Mrs. Duffy?
- Oh, yes.

974
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,026
Hit it.

975
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,531

Boys, that was beautiful,
really beautiful.

1011
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:58,183
You know, you've all grown up so since
the bishop and I lived in this parish...

1012
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:01,937
...that I hardly recognized any of you.

1013
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,973
But I'm so proud of you.

1014
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,357
And I know he's going to be too.

1015
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,519
Oh, thank you.

1016
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,812
Mr. Miller, that was wonderful.

1017
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,732
I can't thank you enough,
Mrs. Brougham.

1018
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:14,991
And you, Mr. Dudley.

1019
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,199
Oh, I'm so sorry
the bishop couldn't have been here.

1020
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:24,410
- Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, thank you.

1021
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,249
Whatever is keeping Stevens?

1022
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:28,960
Oh, Stevens, there you are.

1023
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:33,048
I'm terribly sorry, madam, but the furniture
shop is closed until after New Year.

1024
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:36,464
I can't seem to find a plumber,
and we're out of turpentine.

1025
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:40,509
- This is preposterous.
- Would some witch hazel be of any use?

1026
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,561
- Might I use your telephone?
- Yes, of course.

1027
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:46,348
- It's over there.
- Thank you so much.

1028
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,701
Matilda, this is Bishop Brougham.

1029
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:06,210
I'm over at Mrs. Hamilton's. Will you bring
me another pair of trousers at once, please.

1030
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:11,590
Well, what difference does it make?
Just bring me another pair of trousers.

1031
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:12,999
Thank you.

1032
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:16,920
I'm so very sorry this has happened.

1033
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:20,015
Oh, if only I could get in touch
with Julia or Dudley.

1034
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:23,052
Now, now, don't be nervous, bishop.

1035
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,478
Have a chair.

1036
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,939
Thank you. I have one.

1037
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,569
He isn't here.

1038
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:39,906
Well, perhaps the meeting
was more important than he thought.

1039
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,990
I suppose.

1040
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,831
Well, we better go on home.

1041
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,078
You know, Dudley, it's a strange thing.

1042
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,997
What's strange?

1043
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:56,089
You seem to be able to make me feel
as if everything is gonna be all right.

1044
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,550
- Well, it could be if...
- if what?

1045
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,763
If people could only learn
to behave like human beings.

1046
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,097
Hey, taxi.

1047
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,529
Here's a cab, Julia.

1048
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:20,526
Will you please wait, Sylvester?

1049
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,865
Okay. Sure, mister, I'll wait.

1050
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,996
Sylvester?

1051
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:34,631
Good evening. If you'll wait just
a moment, I'll be right with you.

1052
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:38,385
- This is one of our most exclusive models.
- Really?

1053
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,387
Oh, it's lovely. Just simply ravishing.

1054
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,218
So chic. So young.

1055
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:45,259
- It is sweet, isn't it?
- Oh, it's stunning.

1056
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,427
Not everyone
could wear such a daring hat.

1057
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,812
Of course, it was made for madame.

1058
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:10,459
Say, how did you know
my name was Sylvester?

1059
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:14,997
- Oh, it's up there on your card.
- Oh.

1060
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:19,008
Sylvester, could you drive us
through the park?

1061
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:22,341
- That's way out of your way.
- What's the matter with you, Sylvester?

1062
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,802
- Are you getting bored with us?
- Oh, no.

1063
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:27,183
I'd drive you by way of Mexico City
if you want.

1064
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,056
Thank you.

1065
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:33,557
Dudley, I'm having so much fun.

1066
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,225
- Are you, Julia?
- Yes.

1067
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:36,689
- Are you really?
- Yes.

1068
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:39,946
- I feel as if I were doing something wicked.
- Why?

1376
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:09,720
Oh, I can't thank you enough
for sending him to me.

1377
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:10,975
Oh, but do sit down.

1378
01:34:11,146 --> 01:34:12,853
You know, my dear, meeting Dudley...

1379
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:16,515
...has been the greatest
spiritual experience of my life.

1380
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:17,933
I'm glad you've seen him.

1381
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:22,105
- How did you ever find him, Henry?
- it was more or less of an accident.

1382
01:34:22,282 --> 01:34:24,523
- It was a miracle.
- Oh, indeed, it was.

1383
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:28,865
Talking with this wonderful,
understanding man has--

1384
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:32,030
Henry, I've changed my mind
about the cathedral.

1385
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:34,499
I'm going to give my money
to those who need it.

1386
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,251
To the poor and the homeless...

1387
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:40,665
...and the unappreciated people
here in the city and all over the world.

1388
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:43,755
And I want you
to direct the spending of the money.

1389
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:45,839
Now, Henry,
you see what Dudley has done?

1390
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:47,345
- Yes.
- Now you understand.

1391
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,426
Well, thank you, Mrs. Hamilton.

1392
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:53,977
I'll be home later for dinner
or something.

1393
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:56,479
I don't know what time--

1394
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,231
Goodbye.

1395
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:46,062
Hello, professor.

1396
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:47,857
Henry.

1397
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:49,945
Come in, my dear fellow. Come in.

1398
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:53,077
Sit down, Henry. Let me take your coat.

1399
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:55,740
- No, thanks.
- Oh, no, not there. Here.

1400
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:58,033
This is the only reliable chair.

1401
01:35:58,211 --> 01:36:01,954
Well, this is a surprise and an honor.

1402
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:03,713
We must have a glass of sherry.

1403
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:06,124
- No, thank you, professor.
- Oh, but I insist.

1404
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:08,259
I wanna show you something.

1405
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:10,591
You see this bottle?

1406
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:12,221
You note that it is full?

1407
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:14,053
Now watch.

1408
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,517
This is something
that even you can't explain...

1409
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:19,897
...with all your vast
ecclesiastical knowledge.

1410
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:24,894
You will observe that it's still full.

1411
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:26,561
Now, how do you account for that?

1412
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,446
And what's more, the sherry itself.

1413
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:31,859
It stimulates, it warms, it inspires...

1414
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:35,154
...but no matter how much you drink,
it never inebriates.

1415
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:36,742
I think I can account for it.

1416
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,702
- Dudley's been here.
- Yes.

1417
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:41,041
And that bottle isn't all.

1418
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:43,874
He told me some things about history
that opened my eyes.

1419
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:48,133
And today, I went up to the university
library, I looked into some ancient texts...

1420
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:51,421
...which no living scholar
has been able to decipher.

1421
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:54,965
Suddenly, I found
that I could understand them.

1422
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:56,178
And look.

1423
01:36:56,352 --> 01:36:58,889
This is what I've done,
thanks to Dudley.

1424
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:02,101
My history, I'm actually writing it.

1425
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:03,561
Let's face it, Henry.

1426
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:07,444
This Dudley is no mortal man
like the rest of us.

1427
01:37:07,613 --> 01:37:09,069
Is he?

1428
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:12,445
- How did you know?
- Well, I can't tell.

1429
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:15,110
- Who is he? What is he?
- He says he's an angel.

1430
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:16,494
An angel?

1431
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,621
Funny.
Nothing stopped me from saying it.

1432
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:19,826
From heaven?

1433
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:21,457
That I'm not sure about.

1434
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:23,459
An angel.

1435
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:26,963
Too bad. He's such a nice fellow.

1436
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:29,586
I suppose I should have known it.

1437
01:37:29,761 --> 01:37:32,093
Nothing less than an angel
could've put me to work.

1438
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:34,129
I'm glad he'd done some good
for somebody.

1439
01:37:34,307 --> 01:37:36,173
He brought nothing but disaster for me.

1440
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:37,637
That's absurd.

1441
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:39,676
He and Julia were in here
the other day...

1442
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,970
...she seemed happier
than she's been in years.

1443
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:44,264
In fact, quite like her
old delightful self.

1444
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:47,104
She's a different person
when she's with him.

1445
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:49,985
He's made her despise me.

1446
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:53,193
Are you sure he has done that?

1447
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:55,985
- Do you think it's my fault?
- I didn't say that, Henry.

1448
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:59,120
This whole thing is a mystery
beyond my powers of comprehension.

1449
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:01,827
Oh, I suppose I am to blame
for everything.

1450
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:04,834
I asked for this in more ways than one.

1451
01:38:05,755 --> 01:38:08,122
I suppose that Dudley came to me
just to confirm...

1452
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:11,837
...that I'd already lost
the love of Julia and Debby.

1453
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:16,008
I've got a confession to make
to you, my old friend.

1454
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:18,514
You sent me a coin.
That was very generous of you.

1455
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:21,267
I was mean enough
only to see its commercial value.

1456
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:23,178
It's gone. Don't know what's happened.

1457
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:25,893
But I do. Here it is.

1458
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:28,729
Now, where--? Oh, here it is.

1459
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:30,359
Where did you find it?

1460
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:32,191
- Oh, don't tell me.
- Yes.

1461
01:38:32,365 --> 01:38:36,359
And what's more, he told me what it is.
A museum piece. Worth a fortune.

1462
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:38,118
No, I insist you keep it.

1463
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:40,278
Give it to Julia as
my Christmas present.

1464
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:42,697
Who knows?
it might bring luck to you both.

1465
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:44,286
Henry, it seems strange.

1466
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:47,748
I mean, you being a bishop,
and I a broken-down old scholar...

1467
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,879
...but I feel terribly sorry for you.

1468
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:52,256
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

1469
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:54,213
Thank you, there's nothing to be done.

1470
01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:55,502
There must be.

1471
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,297
You and Julia love each other.
You always have.

1472
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:01,091
It's only partially true. I love Julia.

1473
01:39:01,269 --> 01:39:02,805
Then why don't you fight for her?

1474
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:04,219
How can I fight against--?

1475
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:06,559
But you have a tremendous advantage
over him.

1476
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:08,314
Advantage? Over an angel?

1477
01:39:08,484 --> 01:39:09,940
That's precisely it.

1478
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:12,853
He's an angel.
Julia is a creature of earth.

1479
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:14,812
She's a woman, Henry.

1480
01:39:14,991 --> 01:39:17,403
And you are a man.

1481
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:29,418
Isn't it beautiful?

1482
01:39:29,589 --> 01:39:33,253
And he did every bit of it himself,
and so quick too.

1483
01:39:33,426 --> 01:39:36,418
When I saw it,
I couldn't believe my eyes.

1484
01:39:36,596 --> 01:39:38,303
What a blessing he's been to us.

1485
01:39:38,473 --> 01:39:40,931
The tree is lovely, Matilda. Lovely.

1486
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:42,511
DUDLEY:
I'm glad you like it.

1487
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:45,677
Been years since I've had a chance
to work on a Christmas tree.

1488
01:39:45,855 --> 01:39:48,893
I usually get the more
disagreeable jobs.

1489
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:53,522
Good night, Matilda.

1490
01:39:53,696 --> 01:39:55,027
Sweet dreams.

1491
01:39:55,198 --> 01:39:57,360
Thank you, Mr. Dudley.

1492
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:07,574
- Julia.
- Yes?

1493
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:09,789
I think my work here is almost finished.

1494
01:40:09,962 --> 01:40:12,294
I'll have to be moving along.

1495
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:13,750
Oh.

1496
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:16,292
My superior officers.

1497
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:19,468
Will we ever see you again?

1498
01:40:19,639 --> 01:40:20,720
Mm-mm.

1499
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:24,265
DUDLEY: They seldom send us
to the same place twice.

1500
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:26,893
We might form attachments.

1501
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:30,431
I don't know what you're talking about,
Dudley.

1502
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:32,440
Of course not.

1503
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:35,815
- Julia.
- Yes?

1504
01:40:36,906 --> 01:40:38,863
- I don't want to leave.
- Why?

1505
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:43,827
There are a few people who know the
secret of making a heaven on earth.

1506
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:45,657
You are one of those rare people.

1507
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:50,950
I think you ought to go.

1508
01:40:51,128 --> 01:40:54,496
No, please, Julia. Don't send me away.

1509
01:40:56,842 --> 01:40:58,628
What are you saying, Dudley?

1510
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:01,044
I'm tired of being a wanderer.

1511
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:06,058
I'm tired of an existence where one
is neither hot nor cold, hungry nor full.

1512
01:41:08,771 --> 01:41:10,261
No.

1513
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:14,140
No. No, you must go away...

1514
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:16,480
...and never come back.

1515
01:41:24,704 --> 01:41:26,240
HENRY:
Julia.

1516
01:41:27,873 --> 01:41:29,409
Julia.

1517
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:40,508
I've never had to fight an angel,
but take off your coat...

1518
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:42,168
...and put up your dukes.

1519
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:45,088
Now, why do you want
to fight me, Henry?

1520
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:48,057
Because you're a thief.

1521
01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:51,345
Trying to steal my wife and my child.
The love that belongs to me.

1522
01:41:51,522 --> 01:41:53,513
Don't you realize that as an angel...

1523
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:56,399
...I could possibly destroy you
with a bolt of lightning?

1524
01:41:56,569 --> 01:41:59,061
I don't care.
Julia means more to me than my life.

1525
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:01,400
I'm not gonna lose her.

1526
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:03,569
Ah.

1527
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:05,700
Then I have news for you.

1528
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:07,702
I'm going.

1529
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:13,166
I'll accept that as a fact
when I see it happen.

1530
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:14,542
Oh, no, you won't.

1531
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:17,249
Because when I'm gone,
you will never know...

1532
01:42:17,423 --> 01:42:19,539
...that an angel visited your house.

1533
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:21,378
And Julia? What about her?

1534
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:23,463
There will be no memory
with her, either.

1535
01:42:23,638 --> 01:42:27,552
Or with Debby or the professor
or anyone else.

1536
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:30,057
I don't trust you, Dudley.

1537
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:31,467
You may, Henry.

1538
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:34,229
Because your prayer
has been answered.

1539
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:35,888
My prayer has not been answered.

1540
01:42:36,067 --> 01:42:37,899
I was praying for a cathedral.

1541
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:41,107
No, Henry.
You were praying for guidance.

1542
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,487
That has been given to you.

1543
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:52,238
Just a minute, please.

1544
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:55,200
Good bye, Henry.

1545
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:05,427
Dudley, if we should need you again,
will you come back?

1546
01:43:05,596 --> 01:43:06,677
Not I.

1547
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:10,556
I should ask to be assigned
to the other end of the universe.

1548
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:12,683
Is that because I was so difficult?

1549
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:15,595
Oh, no. This difficulty was in me.

1550
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:17,309
When an immortal finds himself...

1551
01:43:17,483 --> 01:43:20,896
...envying the mortal entrusted
to his care, it's a danger signal.

1552
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:24,608
Take her in your arms
and hold her tight.

1553
01:43:25,658 --> 01:43:27,114
Coming.

1554
01:43:28,494 --> 01:43:31,077
Kiss her for me, you lucky Henry.

1555
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:12,410
Julia.

1556
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:20,493
Julia!

1557
01:44:20,755 --> 01:44:21,790
Shh!

1558
01:44:21,964 --> 01:44:23,955
She's asleep.

1559
01:44:26,594 --> 01:44:28,335
Are you all right?

1560
01:44:29,472 --> 01:44:31,713
Why, yes, of course I am.

1561
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:35,391
Henry, did you get that for Debby?

1562
01:44:38,147 --> 01:44:39,512
HENRY:
No.

1563
01:44:40,483 --> 01:44:43,521
Well, I can't imagine
where it came from.

1564
01:44:54,914 --> 01:44:58,282
Henry, what is it?

1565
01:44:58,459 --> 01:45:00,325
I don't know, I--

1566
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:04,037
I just had the most inexplicable feeling
of happiness.

1567
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:05,250
Oh...

1568
01:45:05,424 --> 01:45:06,710
- You know something?
- What?

1569
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:08,795
In the kitchen there's a bowl of cider.

1570
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:11,882
- Yes, that's for tomorrow afternoon.
- Well, let's drink it now.

1571
01:45:12,056 --> 01:45:14,923
Let's drink to us, to our happiness,
and to what lies ahead.

1572
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:17,387
And then let's smash the glasses
in the fireplace.

That's coming from St. Timothy's.

1577
01:45:26,737 --> 01:45:30,571
That cider's going to have to wait if you're
gonna give your Christmas Eve sermon.

1578
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,823
- Oh, my sermon.
- Yes.

- But that's better still.
- Ha, ha.

1580
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:23,993
Tonight, I want to tell you the story
of an empty stocking.

1581
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:31,212
Once upon a midnight clear,
there was a child's cry...

1582
01:46:33,304 --> 01:46:36,387
...a blazing star hung over a stable...

1583
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:40,517
...and wise men came
with birthday gifts.

1584
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:44,516
We haven't forgotten that night
down the centuries.

1585
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:47,648
We celebrate it
with stars on Christmas trees...

1586
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:50,731
...with the sound of bells
and with gifts.

1587
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:53,946
But especially with gifts.

1588
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:58,693
You give me a book, I give you a tie.

1589
01:46:58,996 --> 01:47:02,284
Aunt Martha has always wanted
an orange squeezer...

1590
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:06,167
...and Uncle Harry could do
with a new pipe.

1591
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:10,455
Oh, we forget nobody, adult or child.

1592
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:13,166
All the stockings are filled.

1593
01:47:13,344 --> 01:47:16,928
All, that is, except one.

1594
01:47:17,723 --> 01:47:21,091
And we have even forgotten
to hang it up.

1595
01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:24,681
The stocking for the child
born in a manger.

1596
01:47:25,189 --> 01:47:27,271
It's his birthday we're celebrating.

1597
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:30,520
Don't let us ever forget that.

1598
01:47:31,403 --> 01:47:33,690
Let us ask ourselves...

...what he would wish for most.

1600

And then let each put in his share.

...warm hearts...

01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:49,123
...and a stretched-out
hand of tolerance.

01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:54,048
All the shining gifts
that make peace on earth.
