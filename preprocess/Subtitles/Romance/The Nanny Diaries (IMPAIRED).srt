- [typing]
- Annie: Name-- Annie Braddock.

2
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:18,574
Age-- 21.

3
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,779
Area of interest--

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,187
anthropology.

5
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:26,123
Describe your
work experience

6
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:28,991
as it relates
to your intended field.

7
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:31,087
My God.

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,758
Where do I begin?

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,792
Woman on P.A.:
Attention. The Museum of Natural History

10
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:39,532
will be closing in
15 minutes.

11
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,733
Please exit the hall

12
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,337
by using
the western staircase.

13
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:01,386
Annie:
Child-rearing around the world

14
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:04,726
boasts a wide variety of
customs and mores.

15
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:12,929
But perhaps the most bizarre
social patterns

16
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:16,430
can be found within the small island
community of Manhattan.

17
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:18,670
- [horn honking]
- Man: Asshole!

18
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,703
The inhabitants of the region
known as the Upper East Side

19
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,683
have the most prosperous,
yet idiosyncratic

20
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:27,151
social systems
on the planet.

21
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:28,983
After successfully mating

22
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:30,818
and producing offspring,

23
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,291
the men are often distant
and uninvolved,

24
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:35,384
leaving their women
to hunt, gather

25
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:37,486
and provide for
their families.

26
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,522
[lion growling]

27
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,866
Yet the resourceful mothers
of the Upper East Side

28
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,871
have plenty of time
to participate

29
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:49,204
in a variety of sex-role-
specific activities.

30
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:53,143
These include
body mutilation,

31
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:56,477
- sacred meditation...
- [woman sighs]

32
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,575
...even fasting rituals.

33
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,245
[toilet flushes]

34
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:01,912
[monkeys squeal]

35
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,822
Which brings us to our focus
on child-rearing:

36
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,621
Who actually does it?

37
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,253
Well, in Africa,
they have a saying--

38
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:11,922
"It takes a village
to raise a child."

39
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,229
But for the tribe of
the Upper East Side,

40
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:16,564
it takes just
one person--

41
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,503
the nanny.

42
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,302
Okay, so what's
depicted here

43
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:28,472
is not a typical
tribal ritual,

44
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,916
but rather the unraveling
of one such nanny.

45
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,545
Actually, this nanny is me.

46
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,351
And why I'm telling off
a teddy bear is the subject

47
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,220
of this field diary.

48
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:42,989
If by chance my report stereotypes
or geographically profiles,

49
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:44,825
forgive me.

50
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,163
I'm not exactly
an objective observer.

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,068
[cheering]

52
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:55,130
Man on P.A.: ...Master in economics,
minor in communications.

53
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:58,143
- Yeah!

Annie Braddock,

56
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,916
high honors in business,
minor in anthropology.

57
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,717
Annie: So here I am a few months before
the teddy bear incident...

58
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:10,882
Whoo-whoo!

59
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,414
...a native New Jersey girl

60
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:14,925
participating in a dreaded
rite-of-passage ceremony.

61
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,895
- Doh!
- Girl: Oh my God!

62
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,397
Man:
Spazz!

63
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,863
Annie:
And here's the woman who reared me

64
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,594
pretty much all
by herself.

65
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,465
She's a nurse.

66
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:25,629
Note the shoes.

67
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:29,130
What is it?

68
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:31,904
You'll see.

69
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:35,005
Oh, wow.

70
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,208
- Thank you.
- I know it's not much,

71
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:39,717
but I wanted to buy you
your first business suit.

72
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,277
- Thanks. Thank you.
- You can look back on this

73
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:44,653
- when you're a famous CFO.
- Oh, Mom.

74
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,319
Gosh, come on. It's one meeting
at Goldman Sachs.

75
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,227
It's highly competitive.
I'm probably never gonna get the job.

76
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:53,254
All right, stop
with the negativity.

77
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:55,823
Your father was always negative
and look where it got him.

78
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:59,360
- Double-wide trailer in Scranton.
- ...in Scranton.

79
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:01,372
Honey, I'm not kidding.

80
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:04,398
I would give the world to be sitting
where you're sitting right now.

81
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:07,003
You are so much
smarter than I was.

82
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:09,377
No man is gonna
squash your dreams.

83
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:13,145
No one's gonna tell you
how to live your life.

84
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:17,053
Maybe I'm-- maybe I'm not
CFO material, you know?

85
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,547
No, what if I'm better
suited at something...

86
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,083
- something else?
- Like what?

87
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:24,687
Anthropology? Honey how are you
gonna make a living at that?

88
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,098
Look, if you really want to
run around in grass skirts,

89
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:31,830
then make enough money to
spend Christmas at Club Med.

90
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:38,903
- [sighs]
- [knock on door]

- Mother: Annie, it's 7:15.
- [train whistle blows]

92
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,848
Get moving or
you're gonna be late.

93
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:46,911
Man on P.A.:
New Jersey PATH train to Manhattan

94
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,647
arriving on track two.

95
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,916
Oh.

96
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,583
New Jersey PATH train
to Manhattan

97
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,251
arriving on track two.

98
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,390
[girl laughing]

99
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,898
Oh, goodness.

100
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,926
I have to admire
this corporate drag. Wow.

101
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,906
Well, at least I'm not wearing last
night's outfit at 8:00 a.m., party girl.

102
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,137
Let's just say that you
missed a fabulous throw-down

103
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:13,076
and Tom Waylan was there.

104
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:14,738
- So?
- He asked about you.

105
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,112
Twice.

106
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:18,343
All right, well,
I gotta go.

107
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:20,408
- Real life awaits.
- God.

108
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:22,420
You know, I bet none of
those cultures you study

109
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:24,251
practice such
rigorous celibacy.

110
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:27,019
- You ever hear of the Shakers?
- Yes, and they're extinct.

111
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,800
Annie:
Excuse me, sir? Sir.

112
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,666
- Yeah?
- I got off at the wrong stop.

113
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,070
Can you tell me where
Chambers Street is, please?

114
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:41,970
You see the building
with the red umbrella?

115
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:44,202
- Yes.
- It's about five blocks below that.

116
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:46,005
Oh shit.

117
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:47,636
[horn honks]

118
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,547
Woman:
Our financial analyst training program

119
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,210
is so competitive.

120
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,549
We have over 8,000 applicants
for 10 positions.

121
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,613
So, why don't you
tell me,

122
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:01,559
in your own words,
who exactly is Annie Braddock?

123
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,562
Wow, that's--

124
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,087
that's certainly
an easy enough question.

125
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:07,962
Mm-hm.

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,332
Annie Braddock is

127
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:13,031
a kind--

128
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,269
well...

129
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:20,343
I am...

130
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,041
Go on.

131
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:26,050
Well, you see...

132
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:27,847
Mm-hm.

133
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,946
I have absolutely
no idea.

134
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,183
Excuse me.

135
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,819
Annie's voice:
Who is Annie Braddock?

136
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,830
It wasn't exactly
a trick question.

137
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:41,391
Yet somehow I couldn't
formulate a response.

138
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,663
Of course I knew
all the basic facts--

139
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,002
the date of birth, home town,
socioeconomic makeup.

140
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,269
But I didn't really know
who I was, where I fit in,

141
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:52,401
who I was gonna be.

142
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:55,607
I was suddenly terrified
I'd never find the answer.

143
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,412
I need five rolls of fabric
overnighted from London.

144
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,975
I don't care
how much it costs.

145
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,350
# Ooh #

146
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:04,753
#  You're a native
New Yorker... # 

147
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,452
Annie:
How about her?

148
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:09,221
This woman-- could she
be Annie Braddock?

149
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,456
#  You should know by now # 

150
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:14,624
#  You're a native
New Yorker... # 

151
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,260
Hmm.

152
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,403
Or perhaps this
is Annie Braddock?

153
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:29,909
#  You grew up
riding the subways # 

154
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,315
#  Running with people # 

155
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,114
#  Up in Harlem,
down on Broadway # 

156
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:38,611
#  There you are
lost someone in the shadows # 

157
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,320
#  Searching for someone # 

158
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:44,419
#  You're the heart and soul
of New York City... # 

159
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,924
Annie's voice:
On that spring afternoon,

160
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,870
it seemed my future
was finally set.

161
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,237
A Central Park bag lady
I would be.

162
00:07:55,273 --> 00:07:58,936
At least I'd finally get
to live in Manhattan.

163
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,708
But before I officially
surrendered to fate,

164
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:05,012
something-- or rather,
someone--

165
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,746
intervened.

166
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,755
[rock music playing]

167
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:12,520
Mmm.

168
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,251
- Whoa!
- Ahh ahh!

169
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,359
Hello there.

170
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:24,766
Hi.
Are you okay?

171
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,999
Get off of me,
you pervert.

172
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,403
Do you belong to anyone,
little man?

173
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:36,971
- Woman: Grayer!
- I belong to you.

174
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:39,575
Grayer!

175
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,679
Oh God.
Thank you so much.

176
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,520
You just averted
a minor disaster.

177
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,492
Annie:
The woman featured here--

178
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,460
the one wearing
the Dior snakeskin jacket

179
00:08:49,494 --> 00:08:50,791
and Louis Vuitton
shoes--

180
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,196
is unfortunately not
Annie Braddock.

181
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:55,495
#  New York City girl... # 

182
00:08:57,335 --> 00:09:00,031
She is, in fact, a perfect
female specimen

183
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:01,936
from the
Upper East Side clan.

184
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,839
For the purpose of
this case study,

185
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,709
we'll just call her
Mrs. X.

186
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,078
Hi, I'm Mrs. X.

187
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:11,674
Let me apologize for
my feral son.

188
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,685
Oh, no need to
apologize.

189
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,346
Please, I love kids.
I'm Annie.

190
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,446
You're a nanny?
Oh!

191
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:18,956
- No, I'm not.
- No wonder.

192
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,084
- You're so good with children.
- Oh, I'm not.

193
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:23,458
Actually, I just
lost my nanny Bertie,

194
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,986
which is why I'm out in
this godforsaken park

195
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:27,589
- by myself.
- Okay.

196
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,658
- She left us to go get married.
- All right.

197
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,637
Oh my God.
Are-- are you employed?

198
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:36,439
- No, unfortunately, I--
- Fabulous!

199
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:38,442
Look, here--
here is my card.

200
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:41,570
Please please please
call me later this week.

201
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,582
We'll schedule a lunch.
Anywhere you'd like to go.

202
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,481
- I'm sorry...
- The Mark, the Four Seasons.

203
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:48,418
Unfortunately, I have to run, but I
really look forward to hearing from you.

204
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:50,284
I'm sorry-- I really think
you misunderstood me.

205
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:52,222
I have a very
good feeling about this.

206
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:53,918
- I...
- Call me.

207
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,390
Pardon me, I couldn't
help but overhear.

208
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:05,198
I'm looking for
a new nanny too.

209
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:06,897
- Oh I...
- Can I give you my card as well?

210
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,271
- Excuse me?
- I pay well above average.

211
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:12,299
- I have a card too, call me.
- I have a place in the Hamptons.

212
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:14,369
Donald Trump lives
in my building.

213
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:17,381
Annie's voice: It seemed that fate now
offered me a wonderful alternative--

214
00:10:17,415 --> 00:10:20,509
an opportunity to completely
duck out of my life.

215
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,078
So I decided for
One summer

216
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:25,316
to abandon Annie

217
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:27,985
and trade her in for
a brand-new persona--

218
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:29,789
Nanny.

219
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,962
Of course there was
one tiny problem.

220
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:39,903
Everything I knew about
nannying came from the movies.

221
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:45,202
Even so, I fell
asleep confident

222
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:48,007
that I'd magically
find my way.

223
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,980
Mother:
Annie?

224
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:58,922
Annie!

225
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,791
[wolves howling]

226
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:23,846
Mother:
Annie?

227
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:27,182
Woman:
Ahh-hoo-hoo!

228
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,555
Mother: Get your feet
on the ground, young lady.

229
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,266
[sighs]

230
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:55,276
Hmm.

231
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:04,422
Annie's voice: The fact that I had
no child-care experience

232
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:06,890
mattered little to the matriarchs
of the Upper East Side.

233
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,451
Even though I
don't have a job,

234
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:12,622
I just don't seem to have
enough time for myself.

235
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,895
Annie's voice: All they needed
to know was that I was white,

236
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,903
a college grad,
and terminally single.

237
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,201
As you can see,
my husband and I

238
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:21,705
are getting a divorce.

239
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,108
So you and the kids
must remain

240
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:27,043
on my side of
the apartment

241
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:28,875
at all times...

242
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,883
until the custody
battle is settled.

243
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,942
- [clears throat]
- Oh...

244
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,854
In short, I was the Chanel
bag of nannies.

245
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,653
Mrs. X:
I heard through the grapevine

246
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,250
you've been meeting
with a lot of people.

247
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:44,056
So I thought you might appreciate
a civilized lunch at Bergdorf's

248
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,756
rather than being
interviewed at the apartment.

249
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,356
Thank you,
that's very considerate.

250
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:49,923
Not really.
I just love to eat out.

251
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,937
I'll probably come up
with a million excuses

252
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,404
for us to go have lunch.

253
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:55,770
I mean, if you end up
with us, I mean.

254
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,799
Ready?

255
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,038
Do-- do you know
what you're having?

256
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,943
I don't mean
to rush you,

257
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,144
but I'm attending a 2:00 lecture
at the Parents' Society:

258
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:08,380
"Super Mom, Trying to Juggle It All."
[laughs]

259
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:10,853
I'll just have the burger.

260
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,882
Thanks.

261
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,486
I can't guarantee
that the meat here

262
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,396
is antibiotic-free.
But the chef here is from Brittany,

263
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,161
so I highly recommend the crepe
Bretagne. Deux, s'il vous plait.

264
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:25,567
- Okay.
- Excellent choice.

265
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,162
Thanks.

266
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:31,966
You're from New Jersey.

267
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,137
Unfortunately.

268
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:37,706
Oh no, there are some very
lovely parts of that state.

269
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,446
Friends of ours have a horse
farm in Upper Saddle River.

270
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:41,884
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

271
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,253
I-- I hear it's
really nice there.

272
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:46,052
I'll have to take you
riding there one day.

273
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,318
Okay.

274
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:49,189
Tell me more.

275
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:52,253
I want to know
all about you.

276
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:55,460
- Uh...
- I'm from Connecticut, actually.

277
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,832
I went to Smith.
And don't believe the rumors,

278
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,031
we weren't all
lesbians.

279
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:01,538
After graduation,

280
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:05,374
I moved here and started
running the Gagosian.

281
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,378
The art gallery.

282
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:09,437
- Oh.
- It was a blast.

283
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,448
But you really-- you can't
do that sort of thing

284
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:12,813
when you're raising a child.

285
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,582
The parties,
the schmoozing, the travel--

286
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,452
Oh, excuse me...

287
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:19,217
- Oh.
- Bitsy.

288
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:20,849
- It's you.
- Bitsy.

289
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,384
I've so been
meaning to call.

290
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:25,658
Is there anything
at all I can do?

291
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,529
Not unless you
know a hit man.

292
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,966
That lawyer Jeanie Whitman
recommended was no help at all.

293
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:31,593
I am so sorry.

294
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,902
Turns out all our assets
are actually in Tucker's company's name.

295
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,908
All I'm getting
is a million flat.

296
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,240
That's appalling.

297
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:43,805
If I'd known it would go this far,
I would have just turned a blind eye.

298
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,080
Anyway, enjoy the rest
of your lunch before I ruin that too.

299
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:49,678
I'll call you later
this week, sweetheart.

300
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,628
Such a shame.

301
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,893
But she should have seen it
coming-- everyone else did.

302
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,560
Anyway, where were we?
Ah yes.

303
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,126
After Gagosian,

304
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,797
I met Mr. X.

305
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:12,642
You know, my grandmother
worked as a domestic

306
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,373
so we wouldn't have to.

307
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:16,573
And here you are,
fresh out of college

308
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:19,015
voluntarily taking
a nanny gig.

309
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,780
I told you, this is not
a lifelong commitment.

310
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,516
Okay? It's just a way
for me to get my head together.

311
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,319
Besides,
the money is great.

312
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:28,518
I finally get to
move to the city.

313
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,222
I'm moving to the city
to go to grad school,

314
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:32,889
not to be somebody's
servant.

315
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,423
Plus you know you're wrong,
or you wouldn't be lying to your mother.

316
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,957
This is all just
happening too fast.

317
00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:41,335
I don't understand why you can't
just live at the house for a while,

318
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:42,669
just to get on your feet.

319
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,676
Mom, I lived at home through
four years of college.

320
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,075
Don't you think
that's long enough?

321
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,839
Well, how could you find
a decent apartment so fast?

322
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,008
The bank has, you know,
an excellent program.

323
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:53,176
They got me hooked up with
a trainee, which is great.

324
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:55,048
I'm getting in
the car.

325
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:56,849
Can I come with you?

326
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,619
I would feel a lot better if I could
at least see where you were living.

327
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,683
Come on. The other
trainees, you know,

328
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,195
they went to fancy
boarding schools

329
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:05,786
and European exchange
programs.

330
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:09,198
I show up with my mom,
I'll just look like a big dork.

331
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,394
Guess that makes sense.

332
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:12,926
Come here.

333
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,234
I love you.

334
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:16,638
Let me know the minute
I can visit you.

335
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,540
I'll call you when
I get there, okay?

336
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,582
[singing with radio]
#  Freedom, freedom... # 

337
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,379
Hey, you're gonna
get me a ticket.

338
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:28,851
# freedom #

339
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,219
#  You got to give
what you take... # 

340
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:34,315
- You're crazy.
-# freedom #

341
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,987
-# freedom...#
- Sing it again.

342
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:39,394
# freedom #

343
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,558
Both:
#  You got to give what you take. # 

344
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:47,498
Annie:
I love that song.

345
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,267
Lynette:
I'm telling you, like the bees,

346
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:53,402
you're free, girl.

347
00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:54,968
That's okay, I'll
take care of it, miss.

348
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:56,776
Oh, thank you.

349
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,680
I can't believe this.
I could get used to this.

350
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,584
- I'm telling you that.
- Thank God I'm getting a shrink degree.

351
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,350
You know, I love you,
but you're harsh.

352
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:06,084
- [laughs]
- A little bit.

353
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:08,592
Just give me a hug.

354
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:12,393
Mwah! I'll see
you soon, I'm sure.

355
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,863
Annie?

356
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,427
You know the path
of least resistance?

357
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:20,300
It can lead through
a minefield.

358
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:22,169
[knocking]

359
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:29,904
Oh, hi.

360
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,382
You are the new nanny?

361
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:35,113
Yes, and you must
be Maria.

362
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:37,417
- Nice to meet you.
- Hmm.

363
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:39,582
Can I come in?

364
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,525
Okay.

365
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,221
Leave it there.

366
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:44,785
The floor is clean.

367
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,821
Mmm.

368
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,603
Wow.

369
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,665
This place is
incredible.

370
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,269
I hope you last longer
than the last one.

371
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:02,006
Who, Bertie?
Oh yeah.

372
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:04,014
Mrs. X told me that she
left to get married.

373
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:06,983
Married? She had one date
and she get fired.

374
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:13,020
Oh, Maria? Are you gonna tell
Mrs. X that I've arrived?

375
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:15,025
Mrs. X is shopping.

376
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,027
But she left you
a note on the table.

377
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:19,621
Now I have to go run
the vacuum, okay?

378
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,690
Ay...
[muttering in Spanish]

379
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:29,704
[vacuum humming]

380
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,045
Mrs. X's voice:
"Dear Nanny,

381
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,048
welcome!"

382
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:40,243
Annie's voice:
Please make note that from here on in,

383
00:18:40,284 --> 00:18:43,913
I'm referred to as "Nanny" by all
the people in the Xs' social network.

384
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,823
Mrs. X's voice:
I'm so excited to have you on board.

385
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,760
Please make yourself
completely at home.

386
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,525
Manuel is making you
your own set of keys.

387
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,532
- Annie: Mmm.
- You should have them by tomorrow.

388
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,329
The fridge
is well-stocked.

389
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:58,028
Annie:
Tofu cutlets?

390
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:00,264
- Ugh.
- Help yourself to anything.

391
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:01,566
Yuck.

392
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,007
Sorry I could not
be there to meet you

393
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,635
but I'm trying to squeeze
in a little shopping

394
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,646
before my
Parents' Society meeting,

395
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,511
which reminds me--

396
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,982
please pick Grayer up
from the Christian preschool...

397
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:14,746
- Wow!
- ...at 2:15 sharp.

398
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,482
It's extremely important
not to be late.

399
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:18,784
Ooh.

400
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,189
As you can see,

401
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:22,590
I have attached a list
of basic house rules.

402
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,392
- Annie: Hello, Manolo.
- We believe it's important

403
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:28,921
to maintain some sense
of structure in our home

404
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,594
- for Grayer's sake.
- [thudding]

405
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,228
- [gasps]
- Rule number one:

406
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,966
Grayer and his playmates
are never allowed

407
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:36,974
- in the master bedroom.
- Oops.

408
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:40,409
Of course, you should refrain from
entering our bedroom as well.

409
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:42,344
Rule number two:

410
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,644
Grayer is never allowed
to nap during the day.

411
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,945
Annie: No naps?

412
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,214
This throws his sleeping
schedule completely off.

413
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:51,187
And I prefer him tired
when I get home.

414
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,524
Rule number three:

415
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,029
- we just had the walls redone.
- Mm-hm.

416
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:00,189
Please keep Grayer from
rubbing up against them.

417
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:01,960
- Oh!
- Rule number four:

418
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,696
if school is
ever canceled,

419
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,762
the following nonstructured
outings are permissible--

420
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,001
the Met,

421
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,702
the Morgan Library,

422
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,904
the French
Culinary Institute,

423
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,937
the New York
Stock Exchange.

424
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,642
- Rule number five:
- Annie: Rule number five!

425
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,345
--we do not take
the subway because of germs.

426
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:22,284
- Annie: Oh God.
- Rule number six:

427
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,584
Grayer still must
be in a stroller

428
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,784
- when crossing Park or Madison.
- Blah blah blah.

429
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,385
Rule number seven:
Grayer maintains

430
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,418
a high-soy
organic diet.

431
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:32,986
Rule number eight:

432
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,261
practice French with Grayer
at least three times a week.

433
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,791
His father wants him to
attend Collegiate

434
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,566
where he's currently
wait-listed.

435
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,597
French?
Holy merde.

436
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,836
His acceptance is
a top priority.

437
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,037
Mon Dieu.

438
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:49,012
- Mrs. X: Nanny?
- [Annie farts]

439
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:51,446
[Annie moans]

440
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:53,950
- Nanny?
- [gasps]

441
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,613
- What are you doing?
- The note said

442
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,986
to pick up Grayer
from school at 2:15.

443
00:20:58,022 --> 00:20:59,080
Hm.

444
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:01,023
And it's only--
it's only 1:00.

445
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:04,892
So I was a little sweaty from moving
and I thought that I would, you know...

446
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,559
What I mean is, what are you
doing in that bathtub?

447
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,626
And why are your bags

448
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,831
strewn all over
the guest room?

449
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:17,035
I thought that
was my room.

450
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:18,166
No.

451
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:21,736
No, Nanny.

452
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,717
This is your room.

453
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,719
Oh.

454
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,017
Okay.

455
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:32,522
- Yeah, this is...
- [bed squeaks]

456
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,616
very sweet.

457
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,287
[banging]

458
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:38,158
Hmm.

459
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:42,798
[siren wailing]

460
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:51,499
I'm sorry.
Do you have the time?

461
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,669
2:15.

462
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,577
So they'll be getting out
anytime now?

463
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,912
- 2:45.
- I'm sorry?

464
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:01,715
They get out
every day at 2:45.

465
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,085
Dumbass.

466
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:07,615
Annie's voice:
It quickly became clear

467
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,253
that Mrs. X had arranged
for me to arrive everywhere

468
00:22:10,294 --> 00:22:12,319
torturously early.

469
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,094
Get ready, ladies.
Here they come.

470
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:20,535
- [bell rings]
- [children screaming]

471
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,870
Grayer?
Grayer?

472
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:32,545
- Grayer X?
- Who is it you're looking for?

473
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,382
- Grayer.
- I know that one.

474
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:37,887
He plays with my
wee monster, Darwin.

475
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,187
- Hy-ya!
- Ow!

476
00:22:40,224 --> 00:22:42,192
Oh, Grayer,
there you are.

477
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:44,126
Hey, little man,
you remember me?

478
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:45,924
Yes, and I hate you!

479
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,797
What? Come on, we get
along great, remember?

480
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,064
Like when we met
in Central Park?

481
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:52,899
Let me get
your backpack.

482
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,906
- [groans]
- Stop. Grayer, stop.

483
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,931
Grayer:
Help, police! She's hurting me!

484
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,205
- They usually start out that way.
- Yes.

485
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:01,108
- Danger, danger!
- Just be patient, eh?

486
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:03,079
- Let me put you in your stroller, okay?
- It'll get easier.

487
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:04,877
- Hang on one second.
- I'm too big for a stroller!

488
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,247
- Grayer!
- Help!

489
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:07,716
- Grayer!
- Police.

490
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,551
Grayer!
Grayer!

491
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,921
Grayer!
Come here!

492
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,290
- I hate you, I want Bertie!
- I know, honey.

493
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:17,556
I know you want Bertie.
Bertie had to leave to get married

494
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,393
or go on a date
or something, okay?

495
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,864
But I promise, we're gonna have a lot
of fun together, honestly.

496
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,996
All right? Now let me see how handsome
you look in your uniform.

497
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:27,594
What's that?

498
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,738
- Oh.
- Don't touch that!

499
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:34,234
It belongs to my daddy!
I hate you. I want Bertie.

500
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:35,939
Grayer.

501
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,573
Annie's voice:
Already, one had to wonder--

502
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,551
what kind of culture would
turn a father's business card

503
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,485
into a security blanket?

504
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,545
- [elevator dings]
- Annie: Here we are.

505
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,854
Home sweet home.
First mission accomplished.

506
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,725
Grayer, get up off the floor.
It's very dirty.

507
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,026
Nuh-uh.

508
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:56,464
I have an idea.

509
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,297
Why don't we race
to the front door?

510
00:23:58,335 --> 00:24:00,269
Okay, last one there is
a rotten egg.

511
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:02,932
I'm not stupid.
You're just gonna let me win.

512
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,534
No, I am a mighty
good runner, mister.

513
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:07,942
- Not with your pants down.
- Oh my God!

514
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,612
Oh shit!
The stroller!

515
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,381
[door closes, locks]

516
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,784
Shit!
Grayer!

517
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,294
You said a curse.
I'm telling Mommy.

518
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:26,091
Grayer, I am not kidding.
Open this door right now.

519
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:29,328
- Maria!
- Touch my fingers.

520
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,200
- Ow!
- I am not letting go...

521
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:34,864
- [elevator dings]
- ...until you open the door!

522
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,134
Ow!

523
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,172
Pardon me.

524
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:46,172
I think this belongs
to Grayer.

525
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:48,242
Rode the elevator to
the 12th floor.

526
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:50,719
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

527
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,723
Sorry, we're having a little
bit of a situation here.

528
00:24:57,461 --> 00:24:59,258
By the way, my name's...
[beeps]

529
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:02,163
Annie's voice:
Since my job required a vow of chastity,

530
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:04,667
it was essential that
I avoided all intimacies,

531
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,330
especially first names.

532
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,531
For the purpose of
this field diary,

533
00:25:08,572 --> 00:25:11,040
let's just call him
Harvard Hottie.

534
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:13,100
I'm the Xs' new nanny.

535
00:25:13,143 --> 00:25:16,943
- Oh.
- Very new, as you can probably tell.

536
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:20,782
Grayer:
I'm taking off all my clothes.

537
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,720
Seems to be popular
on this floor.

538
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:27,683
Mind if I take a crack
at him for you?

539
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,661
Be my guest.

540
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:34,062
Hey, Grayer,
it's your pal from upstairs.

541
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:37,033
Hey, would you be a sport
and unlock the door?

542
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:39,797
It's not nice to
lock people out.

543
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,829
Please, buddy?

544
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,307
[door unlocks]

545
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:47,538
- Hey.
- Why are you here?

546
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:51,743
Oh, I'm just helping out
my new friend.

547
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,274
Annie.

548
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:56,752
Annie.
Annie the nanny.

549
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,983
She's your friend?

550
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:02,584
Yes, she's my friend.
Isn't she your friend too?

551
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,027
Not yet.

552
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:16,202
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

553
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,806
Annie's voice: Suddenly the world's
most notorious loner

554
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,972
had two new men
in her life.

555
00:26:23,013 --> 00:26:27,382
Unfortunately, I knew that
the big one was off-limits.

556
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:29,318
Based on my observations,

557
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:32,254
guys like Harvard Hottie
only slum it when they're in college.

558
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:34,621
So, instead of
following my heart,

559
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,822
I focused on finding a way
into Grayer's.

560
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:43,956
[pop music playing]

561
00:26:48,138 --> 00:26:51,164
Grayer, stop it.

562
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:54,302
#  Why can't we
be friends? # 

563
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:56,142
Annie's voice:
Befriending Grayer

564
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,307
certainly wasn't easy.

565
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,647
[laughing]

566
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,278
La la la la la la!

567
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,584
But then again, Margaret Mead
didn't run home every time

568
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,457
- she contracted malaria.
- Whoa!

569
00:27:08,492 --> 00:27:10,517
Grayer:
You're in trouble!

570
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,689
I thought this job
was supposed to be

571
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,494
a way to get
your head together?

572
00:27:14,531 --> 00:27:17,796
Two weeks in and you already sound
depressed, dejected and paranoid.

573
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,168
You forgot to mention
malnourished.

574
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:22,968
I swear, all these people eat
is bean curd and seltzer.

575
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:24,201
Ew.

576
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:25,970
I mean, even the ice cream
is made out of tofu.

577
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,376
So why don't you come down
and have dinner with us then?

578
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:31,381
My new roomie's
making gumbo.

579
00:27:31,415 --> 00:27:33,883
It's not gumbo.
It's Creole bouillabaisse.

580
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,852
I don't get it.

581
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:39,084
You move to the city and overnight
your life becomes "Will 8 Grace."

582
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:40,784
I'm here, knee-deep in--

583
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,123
- [phone beeps]
- Shit. It's probably my mom.

584
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,457
She's the only one
who has this number.

585
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:45,621
Bye.

586
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,565
- Hello?
- Annie?

587
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,294
- Hi.
- My God.

588
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:53,098
An entire week has gone by
and you haven't called me back.

589
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:55,605
Mom, I told you I was gonna
be so busy with work.

590
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,733
Oh come on.
You can't find five minutes

591
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,300
to call
your worried mother?

592
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:00,935
How are you, honey?

593
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,004
How's the job?
How's the apartment?

594
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:06,312
God, everything
is just perfect.

595
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,978
I mean, the job
is a dream.

596
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:11,453
A little challenging.
So rewarding though.

597
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:14,582
And the apartment is
just incredible.

598
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,754
- Yeah?
- And my roommate could not be nicer.

599
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,161
Nanny, in the morning,

600
00:28:19,196 --> 00:28:21,027
I need you to stop at Tiffany's
and pick up Mr. X's watch.

601
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:23,226
Then I need you to Xerox
the recommendation letters

602
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:25,030
for Grayer's Collegiate
application.

603
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:28,197
Also, I was thinking, we should
introduce French food into his diet.

604
00:28:28,238 --> 00:28:30,672
It might enhance his study
of the language. So tomorrow night,

605
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,610
why don't you make him
coquilles St. Jacques for dinner, hmm?

606
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,738
- Annie?
- Dry cleaning.

607
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,772
Who was that,
your roommate?

608
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,115
Mom, I have to go.
I have some work stuff to take care of.

609
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:43,676
Wait a minute.
I want to make a plan to visit.

610
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,781
- [phone clicks off]
- Ann--

611
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:51,756
[man singing in
foreign language]

612
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:05,776
Hi, ladies.

613
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,802
So I took Madison to
the doctor this morning.

614
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,815
She had grown three
inches in six months.

615
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,249
You take her to
the doctor too?

616
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:16,343
Darling, I do everything.
My job is a type C.

617
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:18,650
- Mmm.
- Type C? What's type C?

618
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,591
Oh Jesus.
Okay, newbie.

619
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,924
Pay attention, honey.
Basically,

620
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,897
there's three types of nanny gigs.
Okay, type A,

621
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,731
you provide "couple time"
a few nights a week

622
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,829
for women who work all day
and parent at night.

623
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,999
Type B, you provide

624
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,633
"sanity time,"
every afternoon, right,

625
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,474
to a woman who mothers in
the mornings and the evenings.

626
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:43,639
And type C,
the most common,

627
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:46,411
you provide 24-7
"me time"

628
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,510
to the woman who neither
works nor mothers.

629
00:29:49,553 --> 00:29:52,147
So, which one are you?

630
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:54,089
I am type C,

631
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:57,457
no question.
Although when I started I had no idea.

632
00:29:57,494 --> 00:30:01,294
I thought it would be
a kind of fun and easy job.

633
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:03,891
You'd think
a college graduate

634
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,563
would choose a job
a little more wisely.

635
00:30:06,603 --> 00:30:09,367
Actually, this job
kind of chose me.

636
00:30:09,406 --> 00:30:12,341
Chose you?
[clicks tongue]

637
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:15,504
Please, child.
I left my country

638
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:18,777
because I thought I could give my boy
and my sick mother a better life.

639
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,446
I was supposed to be here
two or three years tops.

640
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:25,046
And while I've been raising
these strangers' children,

641
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:29,286
my own child has grown up
without a mother.

642
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:31,419
That's how this job
chose me.

643
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,727
[man singing in French]

644
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:44,272
Half a tablespoon
of tarragon.

645
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,845
That's dried.
I like fresh.

646
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,375
Well, you know what?
Dried's all we got, okay, kiddo?

647
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:58,252
I hate coquilles dry.
I want sushi.

648
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:00,848
Well, then tell your mother
you want to learn Japanese.

649
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,154
Mmm!

650
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:04,092
Okay.

651
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:12,028
- Ah!
- [Grayer laughs]

652
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:16,005
I'm telling Mommy.
You're in trouble.

653
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:18,200
Okay.

654
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,880
That's it.

655
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,644
No, Mommy says they're full
of high-fructose corn syrup.

656
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,281
Well, what mommy doesn't know
won't hurt her, okay, Mr. Tattletale?

657
00:31:32,322 --> 00:31:34,916
Eat it.
Go on.

658
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,950
Right out of the jar.

659
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,240
It's okay.

660
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,244
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

661
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,804
- It's yummy, isn't it?
- This is fun.

662
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,182
Yeah?
This is fun. This is fun.

663
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:05,484
And this fun meal has to
be our little secret, okay?

664
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,491
Okay.

665
00:32:07,524 --> 00:32:08,718
Okay.

666
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,526
Hey, you know, we can do
lots of fun things.

667
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:16,123
We just have to be friends
and we have to trust each other.

668
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,327
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

669
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,300
Maybe you should have
a secret name too?

670
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,672
- You want a secret name?
- Yeah, I want a secret name.

671
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,837
Okay.

672
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,609
How about Sponge Bob?

673
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,275
- No, silly.
- No?

674
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,752
All right, what about...
what about Grover?

675
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,518
Grover,
I love Grover.

676
00:32:39,556 --> 00:32:43,083
You do?
All right. Grover it is.

[door opens]

678

Man:
Where's my little munchkin?

679
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,530
- Daddy! Daddy's home.
- Huh?

680
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:55,561
- Yay, Daddy. Daddy's home.
- I hear him, I hear him.

681
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,836
- Daddy!
- Oh, there he is!

682
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,809
Oh my goodness, I'm sorry.
Are you a little monster?

683
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,675
Remember what happens
to little monsters?

684
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,010
- Come here for a minute.
- No, Daddy!

685
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:05,446
You remember?
What's wrong with you?

686
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:07,074
- Daddy!
- Come here for a minute.

687
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:09,745
You get viciously tickled.
You remember that?

688
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,186
- Daddy, stop it.
- Huh? Hey.

689
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:12,950
- You my little superstar?
- Yeah.

690
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,289
Are you? Are you gonna
take over the world?

691
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:17,418
Come on, answer me.
You gonna take over the world?

692
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:19,452
- Yes.
- And when are you gonna do it?

693
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:21,691
- Next year.
- Next year's not soon enough.

694
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,793
Well, you must be Mr. X.
I'm the new nanny.

695
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,327
Yeah. Heep him
quiet tonight, will you?

696
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:29,032
I've got a merger
I'm working on.

697
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:30,733
I don't get some
decent shut-eye tonight,

698
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,470
somebody around here's
gonna be accountable.

Daddy, come see
my dinosaur!

700
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:36,836
- Daddy's got work to do, buddy.
- Please?

701
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:44,512
Hey, Grayer, don't--
don't be sad. It's okay.

702
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,649
Daddy's just tired.

Grover.

704
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,158
Hey, you want to
finish our fun meal?

705
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:59,225
Come on!

706
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:01,237

Yeah, Grover?

You'll never leave me
like Bertie, will you?

714
00:34:27,497 --> 00:34:30,364
- Grover, you know I...
- Promise?

715
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,365
I'm not going anywhere.
You know that, right, honey?

Right, Grove?

Mrs. X's voice:
Dear Nanny,

719
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,594
please remember that
today is the 4th of July family party

720
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,296
at Mr. X's office.

721
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:09,464
It probably slipped your mind
that costumes are required,

722
00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:12,703
so I took it upon myself
to have some delivered.

723
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,712
- This is itchy.
- I know, sweetheart.

724
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,442
Why do we have to
dress up?

Freedom, Grove.

It's all in the name
of freedom.

Hey, guys.

728

- Who is that?
- That's the nanny, dear.

729
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:30,151
- You've met her.
- What happened to Louisa?

That was two nannies
ago, silly.

00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,291
- Yeah.
- Daddy, I'm George Washington.

733
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:39,893
- Okay.
- Tickle me.

734
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,030
No, I understand that,
Dan, because the bastard's selling low.

735
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:44,040
- Please!
- Grayer, come on, buddy.

- [laughing]
- Cut it out, sit down.

737
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:48,543
- Yes yes, we're coming.
- No, it's just my kid.

738
00:35:48,578 --> 00:35:50,205
- We're coming.
- Right.

739
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:52,374
- Well no, that's what I was thinking...
- You want me to call...

740
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:54,975
- Grayer: Where's my card! Daddy!
- Your what?

741
00:35:55,018 --> 00:35:57,816
Where's my card!
Oh, I wanna go home!

742

Hey, smile, Grove.
We're gonna go to a party.

743

That's not my card.
Where's my card?

744

Mr. X:
Would you get off that phone

745
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:06,824
and tell the nanny to
give him his damn card?

746
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,731
- Mrs. X: Nanny?
- Mr. X: Turn the car around.

747
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,962
- Talk to the nanny, please.
- Nanny, go back and get the card.

I don't mean to be laughing.

You look very

- Yeah.
- Let me hit your floor.

Oh, that's okay.
I got it.

No, sorry.

Grayer just had to use
the bathroom.

787
00:38:14,457 --> 00:38:16,925
So use it already.

788
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:21,627
Hello, Grayer.
Remember me?

789
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,634
I work with your daddy
in the Chicago office.

790
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,501
Let go.
I have to make a doodie.

791
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:27,867
Oh.

792
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:30,840
[laughs]

793
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,976
So, you must
be the nanny.

794
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:39,413
Uh, yes, I...

795
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:43,385
I'll get out of your--
I'll wait in the hall.

796
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,518
So sorry.

797
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,792
Grayer, hurry up.
Your mom's coming.

798
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,066
Sweetie, did Grayer hear
from the waiting-list committee yet?

799
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:02,867
No, why?

800
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,772
Oh, I'm sure it
doesn't mean anything,

801
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,538
but the Bairds did
and Darwin got in.

802
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:14,417
Please don't say anything about
Collegiate or Darwin to my husband.

803
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:16,442
Sure.

804
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,325
- Oh, hi, pumpkin.
- There you are.

805
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,759
Oh, you've met before
in Chicago, right?

806
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,228
- Yes, hello.
- Lovely to see you.

807
00:39:26,262 --> 00:39:28,355
- Nice to see you as well.
- Excuse me. Thanks again.

808
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:30,093
- Mm-hm.
- Where have you been?

809
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:31,896
Making calls.
Where's the chow?

810
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,870
- The entire time?
- Yeah.

811
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:38,870
[thunder rumbling]

812
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,310
Annie's voice:
Male monogamy remains an elusive,

813
00:39:42,345 --> 00:39:44,575
yet much
mythologized practice

814
00:39:44,614 --> 00:39:46,241
throughout the world.

815
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:48,750
In many Bedouin tribes,

816
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:52,483
powerful men are encouraged
to take multiple wives.

817
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,624
In contemporary France,

818
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,593
mistresses are de rigueur

819
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:00,119
and quietly tolerated.

820
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:02,791
But for the women
of the Upper East Side,

821
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:06,860
adultery is
pathologically ignored.

822
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:11,540
Nobody warned me we were going
to have a therapy session.

823
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:14,475
Mrs. X: It's just that I didn't
see you at all at the party.

824
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:17,480
Well, I was trying to
sneak in a little work.

825
00:40:17,514 --> 00:40:20,210
Okay? Forgive me
for making a living.

826
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,845
But everybody else
was participating.

827
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:28,291
Everybody else doesn't pull
down what I do every year.

828
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:31,191
I had my family there
and I was present and accounted for.

829
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:34,219
So now, you know, I would really
appreciate a moment of peace and quiet.

830
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:35,788
'Cause frankly,
I'm exhausted.

831
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,097
[thunder crashes]

832
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:40,329
Annie:
Bonjour, Pierre.

833
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,429
Bonjour.

834
00:40:42,472 --> 00:40:45,771
- Comment allez-vous?
- [Mr. and Mrs. X arguing]

835
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,176
Bien, merci.

836
00:40:50,213 --> 00:40:52,010
Et vous?

837
00:40:52,048 --> 00:40:55,609
Ah, comme ci comme ca.

838
00:40:59,222 --> 00:41:01,281
Okay, I got
a great idea.

839
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:05,260
Let's pretend that
we're in a cave.

840
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:07,695
You know what, Nanny?

841
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,358
What, Grove?

842
00:41:09,399 --> 00:41:11,833
I love you best.

843
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,873
Annie's voice: The other nannies
had warned me about this very moment,

844
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,898
the moment when you'll
be tempted to break

845
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,911
the cardinal rule
of nannydom.

846
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:25,848
And yet, staring into those big,
sad, searching eyes,

847
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,875
I simply couldn't resist.

848
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,285
I love you too, Grove.

849
00:41:33,323 --> 00:41:37,726
Three little words made leaving
this job 1,000 times harder.

850
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,524
Mrs. X:
...hear a thing I have to say!

851
00:41:39,562 --> 00:41:42,190
I know that you work hard.
I just think

852
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:46,635
that if-- if we're
gonna have more children--

853
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,730
Well, maybe you should
focus on the one you already have.

854
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,867
'Cause you can barely
handle him as it is.

855
00:41:54,377 --> 00:41:56,402
Why are you
so cruel to me?

856
00:41:56,446 --> 00:41:58,243
- Why?
- Why are you so cruel?

857
00:41:58,281 --> 00:42:00,943
Because I cannot take
the additional pressure.

858
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:04,318
You know something? I think that
I am going to go out to Chicago

859
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:06,822
- until this merger is finished.
- Will you stop it, please?

860
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,690
And I certainly hope that
you're in a better mood...

861
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:13,026
- Please, stop it.
- ...when I come back. All right?

862
00:42:13,062 --> 00:42:15,223
If I come back!

863
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,674
[door slams]

864
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:32,840
Nanny, this is yours,
is it not?

865
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:41,114
Uh... no, I--

866
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:42,954
no, I don't know
what that is.

867
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:46,053
It was in our laundry.

868
00:42:46,095 --> 00:42:49,189
It is not mine,
it is not Mr. X's,

869
00:42:49,232 --> 00:42:51,894
so it has to be yours,
right?

870
00:42:53,403 --> 00:42:56,031
Right?

871
00:42:56,072 --> 00:42:58,063
Yes, it's mine.

872
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:03,237
Please don't leave your personal items
lying around the house again.

873
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:06,948
I-- I won't.

874
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,646
- I promise. I'm sorry.
- Apology accepted.

875
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:21,920
I don't mean...

876
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,833
to be a control freak.

877
00:43:28,538 --> 00:43:33,407
It's-- it's just that when Mr. X
is in the middle of a big deal,

878
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:35,707
it can be very hard on me.

879
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,743
I understand.

880
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,617
[thunder rumbles]

881
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,631
How is Grayer doing?

882
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,827
Grayer?

883
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:00,701
He's-- he's fine.

884
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,263
He's great.

885
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:05,171
That's good to hear.

886
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:08,769
He really is
a wonderful child, isn't he?

887
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,250
He's the best.

888
00:44:15,284 --> 00:44:18,219
He's--
he's such a sweet--

889
00:44:18,254 --> 00:44:20,381
Okay, good night then.

[door closes]

891

Mrs. X's voice:
Dear Nanny, I know it's Sunday

892
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,223
and you requested
a day off,

893
00:44:30,266 --> 00:44:32,325
but I desperately need
to sleep in.

894
00:44:32,368 --> 00:44:34,598
I have a very long
afternoon today

895
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,731
tasting caterers
for our benefit,

896
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:39,436
"Conga for the Congo."
Please don't wake me

897
00:44:39,475 --> 00:44:41,875
unless Mr. X calls
from Chicago.

898
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:43,504
And most importantly,

899
00:44:43,546 --> 00:44:46,014
find a way to
keep the boy quiet.

900
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:48,176
Why don't they just
muzzle the kid already?

901
00:44:48,217 --> 00:44:49,684
What's a muzzle?

902
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,417
Scrambled for you
and Cheerios for the boy.

903
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:55,754
Mommy doesn't allow me
to eat sugar cereal.

904
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,761
Cheerios are sugar-free.

905
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:00,457
Low in sugar isn't
the same as sugar-free.

906
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:02,054
Grover, just eat it.

907
00:45:05,368 --> 00:45:06,926
Is that caffeinated?

908
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,995
Mommy doesn't
use caffeine.

909
00:45:09,038 --> 00:45:11,336
That's because Mommy
sleeps till noon.

910
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:13,672
Mrs. X's voice:
Perhaps it might be a nice morning

911
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,906
to do something
educational with Grayer,

912
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:17,971
like the Pissarro show
at the Guggenheim.

913
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:20,847
Mommy said you're supposed to take
me to her favorite museum,

914
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,249
the "Guggyheiny."

915
00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:24,014
Well, since today was
supposed to be my day off,

916
00:45:24,053 --> 00:45:26,613
we're gonna go to my favorite,
the Museum of Natural History.

917
00:45:26,656 --> 00:45:28,920
- Isn't that on the West Side?
- Yeah, so?

918
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,951
I'm not allowed to go on the West Side.
That's a rule.

919
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:35,692
Well, today just happens to
be break-the-rules day.

920
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,894
Oh.

921
00:45:45,108 --> 00:45:47,474
Hi.
Two please.

922
00:46:18,374 --> 00:46:20,774
Hey, you know what
the biggest word in America is?

923
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:21,937
What?

924
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:25,142
Anti--
antidisestablishmentarianism.

925
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:27,342
Hey, that's pretty good,
Grove.

926
00:46:27,383 --> 00:46:29,248
Actually, I know
a longer word.

927
00:46:29,285 --> 00:46:31,753
- There is no longer word.
- Yes, there is.

928
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,280
Supercalifragilistic-
expialidocious.

929
00:46:34,323 --> 00:46:36,518
Wow.
What does that mean?

930
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,585
Come on inside.
Let me show you.

931
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,861
Annie: "The apatosaurus, formerly
known as the brontosaurus,

932
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,164
is from a family of
enormous herbivores."

933
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:47,601
Herbivores means
vegetarian.

934
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,435
Like Mommy,
you know?

935
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:51,497
What's that over there?

936
00:46:54,343 --> 00:46:56,868
That is the T-rex.

937
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:59,508
- Is that one like Mommy too?
- Hmm.

938
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:02,347
I wish my ancestors
made totem poles.

939
00:47:02,385 --> 00:47:04,285
Well, they did.
That one looks just like you.

940
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,480
[laughs]
It does.

941
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:06,818
Well, that guy has
a big...

942
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,052
It's hanging.

943
00:47:13,362 --> 00:47:15,330
Cool.
What are they?

944
00:47:15,364 --> 00:47:16,956
They're a Matis
family.

945
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,968
They live in
the Amazon.

946
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:21,367
Which one's the nanny?

947
00:47:21,404 --> 00:47:25,465
She has the day off. Things are
different in that part of the world.

948
00:47:27,176 --> 00:47:29,406
Mrs. X's voice:
And Nanny, one last thing

949
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:32,107
before you take
the rest of the day off:

950
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:35,311
Do you think you could
manage a quick shop for me?

951
00:47:39,555 --> 00:47:41,523
- I'll help.
- No, it's okay, Grayer.

952
00:47:41,557 --> 00:47:43,991
Don't.
Grayer, don't-- don't!

953
00:47:44,026 --> 00:47:45,721
God!

954
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,753
Mommy!

955
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:50,358
What a mess.

956
00:47:50,399 --> 00:47:53,129
Really, Nanny, I don't know
why you didn't leave all this

957
00:47:53,169 --> 00:47:55,262
downstairs with Manuel
to store.

958
00:47:55,304 --> 00:47:58,273
I mean, am I supposed to have this lying
around the apartment till the benefit?

959
00:47:58,307 --> 00:48:01,435
No no no, of course not. I-- I'm gonna
bring it down to him right now.

960
00:48:01,477 --> 00:48:04,105
There's no time now.

961
00:48:04,146 --> 00:48:06,671
I need you to get ready for the Nanny
Conflict Resolution Seminar

962
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,514
at the Parents' Society.

963
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:11,281
I totally forgot
it was this evening.

964
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,550
Um...

965
00:48:15,091 --> 00:48:16,956
[objects thud]

966
00:48:19,161 --> 00:48:21,629
Mrs. X, I...

967
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,826
don't know
if you remember,

968
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:26,028
but I-- I was supposed
to have the evening off.

969
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:28,468
And I made plans.

970
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:34,133
The entire point of
the seminar

971
00:48:34,176 --> 00:48:36,201
is that everybody
brings their nanny.

972
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:40,082
Are you suggesting
I attend it alone?

973
00:48:40,116 --> 00:48:42,550
Huh-uh. No.

974
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:44,712
I was just...

975
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,416
I was confused.

976
00:48:46,455 --> 00:48:50,152
So, I will
cancel my plans.

977
00:48:50,192 --> 00:48:52,592
I'd appreciate it.

978
00:48:57,133 --> 00:49:00,728
Woman: Does anyone have
an extra diaper I can use?

979
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,501
Stop eating them boogers!

980
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:06,940
Grayer, no nudity.
Please.

981
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,104
Of course you feel anxiety

982
00:49:09,145 --> 00:49:11,773
when leaving
your kids with strangers.

983
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:14,079
You're moms.
Okay...

984
00:49:14,116 --> 00:49:16,584
now what I would
love to do

985
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,815
is bring in
the nannies.

986
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,346
Linda, Gillian, would you
mind monitoring the children

987
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,415
so that the nannies can
join us in here?

988
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:25,927
Okay, listen, I want to see
you all here next week.

989
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,431
The seminar is called
"Sexy Mom, Happy Mom."

990
00:49:28,464 --> 00:49:30,955
It's gonna be
a hot one.

991
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,865
Linda:
Nannies, we're ready.

992
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,996
- [children screaming]
- Right this way, ladies.

993
00:49:35,037 --> 00:49:37,562
All right, here they are--

994
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:40,201
the nannies!
Wonderful. Come on in.

995
00:49:40,242 --> 00:49:43,700
Just-- just file against this wall.
Just squeeze in.

996
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,942
But-- but be comfortable.

997
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,747
Terrific.
Now that we're all together,

998
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:51,618
I think it's time to address
the reason for this seminar:

999
00:49:51,654 --> 00:49:55,454
improving nanny-mom
communication.

1000
00:49:55,491 --> 00:49:59,222
To begin, I would like
a mom volunteer

1001
00:49:59,261 --> 00:50:01,957
to offer the group
one particular example

1002
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,967
of failed communication
with your nanny.

1003
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,991
Most of them
barely speak English.

1004
00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:08,833
- That's the problem.
- Okay, you.

1005
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:11,636
My nanny keeps on singing
religious songs to Parker

1006
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,576
even though I have told her
time and time again that we're agnostic.

1007
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:17,136
And what's worse,
every time I confront her

1008
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:20,307
she flatly denies it,
even after I provided her

1009
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:22,010
with evidence
from the Nanny Cam.

1010
00:50:22,051 --> 00:50:25,384
Nanny Cam?
I thought that was an urban myth.

1011
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:27,286
That's my nanny over there.

1012
00:50:27,323 --> 00:50:30,315
Will you please ask her
if she's trying to convert my child?

1013
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:34,022
No. Right now we're
just hearing issues.

1014
00:50:34,063 --> 00:50:38,022
Okay. Next I would like
to hear from a nanny.

1015
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:40,365
Can I have a nanny
volunteer?

1016
00:50:40,403 --> 00:50:42,337
Anyone?

1017
00:50:42,371 --> 00:50:43,895
Por favor?

1018
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,341
Come on,
don't be shy.

1019
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:50,607
We won't bite.
[laughs]

1020
00:50:50,646 --> 00:50:52,841
Okay, how about you,
young lady?

1021
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,612
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

1022
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:58,212
Can you share with the group
one particular grievance

1023
00:50:58,254 --> 00:51:01,519
that you might have
about your job?

1024
00:51:01,557 --> 00:51:03,218
Come on.

1025
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:06,626
No no, I-I--
I love my job.

1026
00:51:06,662 --> 00:51:09,688
I do. I feel--
I feel kinda lucky.

1027
00:51:09,732 --> 00:51:11,529
Oh, that's very nice,

1028
00:51:11,567 --> 00:51:13,797
but neither helpful
nor productive.

1029
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:17,034
So can you please offer
the class something useful? Come on.

1030
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,802
[mouths]

1031
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:22,369
- Well...
- Yeah?

1032
00:51:22,411 --> 00:51:25,938
It would be nice to
have a night off, I guess.

1033
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:28,007
Uh-huh.

1034
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:31,850
We-- we have been a little
preoccupied with our benefit.

1035
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:33,480
[women chuckle]

1036
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:35,423
But all she has to do
is ask.

1037
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:38,359
Uh-huh-huh-huh.
See, ladies?

1038
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:40,862
Conflict resolved.

1039
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,934
- I'm taking him.
- Oh no, I can take him.

1040
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,944
- No, it's all right.
- No, I can-- I can take him.

1041
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:58,470
Nanny, please.
I want you to go out.

1042
00:51:58,514 --> 00:52:01,415
It's only 9:00.
You clearly wanted the evening off.

1043
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:04,044
No-- no, you must be
exhausted, let me put him to bed.

1044
00:52:04,086 --> 00:52:06,316
We'll manage fine.
Here.

1045
00:52:06,355 --> 00:52:08,346
Have a blast.

1046
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:19,600
Annie:
I just don't understand it.

1047
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:25,272
I-- I just don't understand
how someone can have everything

1048
00:52:25,307 --> 00:52:27,537
and still be...

1049
00:52:27,576 --> 00:52:30,170
so miserable.

1050
00:52:31,514 --> 00:52:33,482
Anyway...

1051
00:52:33,516 --> 00:52:36,952
remember I was telling you
I went to this orientation mixer thingy?

1052
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,615
I met this guy who
likes the same exact--

1053
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:43,490
It's like she dumps all of her problems
with her husband onto me.

1054
00:52:43,526 --> 00:52:46,495
It's called denial.
Okay, like the river.

1055
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:49,225
And you obviously have
become her enabler.

1056
00:52:49,265 --> 00:52:51,062
What? What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1057
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,728
It means, can you stop talking about
this woman for five minutes please?

1058
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,568
Well, I'm sorry I'm boring you, Lynette,
but this is my life right now.

1059
00:52:56,605 --> 00:52:58,903
I have a life too,
in case you haven't noticed.

1060
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:01,502
And I'm starting to think
you and that lady

1061
00:53:01,544 --> 00:53:03,341
are kindred spirits.

1062
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:07,810
You know what? NYU should give you
your diploma right now.

1063
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,876
- You've got all the answers.
- Okay okay.

1064
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,388
Okay, let's forget that--
forget that.

1065
00:53:12,421 --> 00:53:15,481
Can we at least try
to have a good time?

1066
00:53:15,524 --> 00:53:17,822
Since you did drag me
above 14th Street.

1067
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:18,885
Mmh.

1068
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,427
Come on, Annie.
This place,

1069
00:53:22,464 --> 00:53:24,193
you have to admit,
it's...

1070
00:53:24,233 --> 00:53:26,098
hmm, tired.

1071
00:53:26,135 --> 00:53:28,501
Look at these guys
over there.

1072
00:53:28,537 --> 00:53:30,903
They don't have
any piercings,

1073
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,272
no tattoos.
I mean...

1074
00:53:32,308 --> 00:53:33,832
Oh my God.

1075
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,038
- We have to go right now.
- Wha-- why?

1076
00:53:36,078 --> 00:53:39,013
- Wait a minute.
- The guy I told you about is here.

1077
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:40,538
Harvard Hottie?

1078
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:43,245
- Mmm.
- Which one? Which one, where?

1079
00:53:43,285 --> 00:53:46,948
Yankees cap, blue shirt,
blue blood.

1080
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,390
Mmm.
He is gorgeous.

1081
00:53:49,425 --> 00:53:50,722
Yeah, okay, let's go.

1082
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,557
No no no, are you out of your mind?
You kidding me?

1083
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:54,427
No, I'm out of
my league, okay?

1084
00:53:54,463 --> 00:53:55,862
Let's go.

1085
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,730
- Oops.
- [crashing]

1086
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,701
[Lynette giggling]

1087
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,294
What the hell
are you doing?

1088
00:54:01,337 --> 00:54:04,397
Oh my God, I know that girl.
Annie!

1089
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,431
Annie!

1090
00:54:06,475 --> 00:54:08,102
Come on, have a drink
with him already.

1091
00:54:08,143 --> 00:54:10,441
I told you, I can't
date on the job.

1092
00:54:10,479 --> 00:54:12,811
Are you gonna use this job as an excuse
for everything or what?

1093
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:13,941
Say hello
to the nice fella.

1094
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,145
- Hey.
- Guys, this is Annie.

1095
00:54:16,185 --> 00:54:17,777
I don't know your name.
I'm sorry.

1096
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,948
- Oh, Lynette.
- Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you.

1097
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,686
Some buddies from high school--
this is Carter, Jojo,

1098
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:25,661
- John, Henny, Reggie.
- Hello.

1099
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,390
- Nice to meet you.
- Sit, grab a chair.

1100
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:29,624
- Oh no, we can't.
- We'd love to.

1101
00:54:30,633 --> 00:54:32,726
Yeah.

1102
00:54:34,036 --> 00:54:38,029
So, girls, tell us,
how do you know our boy here?

1103
00:54:38,073 --> 00:54:42,169
Oh, I really don't know him.
He's Annie's friend.

1104
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,816
I know him from work.

1105
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:50,149
Oh yeah?
What kind of work do you do?

1106
00:54:50,185 --> 00:54:52,983
Model?

1107
00:54:53,022 --> 00:54:56,014
- Stewardess?
- Escort?

1108
00:54:57,459 --> 00:54:59,689
She works for someone
in my building.

1109
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:01,560
Men: Oh.

1110
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:02,997
Actually, I'm a nanny.

1111
00:55:03,032 --> 00:55:05,796
A nanny?

1112
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,826
- Dude!
- [men laugh]

1113
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:10,237
You didn't tell us
you knew a nanny.

1114
00:55:10,272 --> 00:55:12,604
That is so porno.

1115
00:55:12,641 --> 00:55:14,336
- Are the moms hot?
- Guys.

1116
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:17,470
- Are you hot for the dads?
- Are the dads hot for you?

1117
00:55:17,513 --> 00:55:20,073
- Hey, come on.
- You want to know about the dads?

1118
00:55:20,115 --> 00:55:22,777
I'll tell you about
the dads.

1119
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,912
They're chubby, bald,
steak-eating,

1120
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,819
cigar-smoking,
type-A pigs

1121
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:30,292
who get more turned on by the Bloomberg
Wire than they do by any hot nannies.

1122
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:34,092
Actually, it's all of you
in about five years.

1123
00:55:34,129 --> 00:55:36,097
So take it from me, guys:
Enjoy tonight,

1124
00:55:36,131 --> 00:55:39,066
because your future looks
pretty fucking bleak.

1125
00:55:39,101 --> 00:55:40,728
- Wait.
- God!

1126
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:47,303
Annie:
Stupid stupid.

1127

1129
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,441
Machine:
You have two new messages.

1130
00:55:53,482 --> 00:55:55,712
Harvard Hottie:
Hey, Annie, it's me,

1131
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:58,482
the-- the big jerk
from the bar.

1132
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,987
- What?
- Listen...

1133
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:01,887
in case you're wondering,
your friend Lynette

1134
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:03,586
- gave me your home number.
- Ex-friend.

1135
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,423
I obviously owe you
a major apology.

1136
00:56:05,461 --> 00:56:07,725
Please just don't judge me
by my loser friends.

1137
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,391
- Mm-hm.
- They were pretty hammered.

1138
00:56:09,431 --> 00:56:11,558
Anyway, I want you to
give me an opportunity

1139
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,898
to redeem myself
by taking you out.

1140
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,905
And I'm warning you,
I won't take no for an answer.

1141
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,737
I know where you live, so I'll camp out
at your door if I have to.

1142
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:20,640
You really might as well
just get this over with.

1143
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,304
And if you really hate me
after that...

1144
00:56:22,344 --> 00:56:24,312
I'll-- I'll never
ask you again.

1145
00:56:24,346 --> 00:56:27,110
Okay, I'm sorry to ramble.
If I don't hear from you,

1146
00:56:27,149 --> 00:56:29,208
I'll ride the elevator
till I find you.

1147
00:56:29,251 --> 00:56:30,445
Bye.

1148
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,680
I am so screwed.

1149
00:56:34,723 --> 00:56:35,883
[answering machine beeps]

1150
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,859
Annie, it's your mother.

1151
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:41,159
Look, I'm sorry that I didn't
call last night, okay?

1152
00:56:41,196 --> 00:56:43,596
I had a really late night.
But about tonight...

1153
00:56:43,632 --> 00:56:46,931
Okay, you know what?
I don't want to hear it. I'm coming.

1154
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,801
- I am coming.
- All right, fine.

1155
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,703
Fine-- okay, let me...

1156
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,640
let me just call you
after this play date, okay?

1157
00:56:52,674 --> 00:56:54,699
Play date?
What the hell is a play date?

1158
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:58,737
- Oh shit.
- You said a curse!

1159
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:02,183
Um, you know, Mom.
A play date--

1160
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:05,778
it's the meeting of
preliminary investment schedules.

1161
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:08,518
Look, I'll call you
later, okay?

1162
00:57:08,557 --> 00:57:11,617
All right. Bye.

[doorbell chimes]

1164
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,056
Who lives here?

1165
00:57:16,098 --> 00:57:18,293
Some kid named Jefferson.

1166
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:21,063
Your mom found him
with the Park Avenue play-date service.

1167
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:22,900
Hi, y'all.

1168
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:25,964
I'm Jefferson's
mama Tanya.

1169
00:57:26,008 --> 00:57:27,339
Come on in.

1170
00:57:27,376 --> 00:57:30,106
We're baking a cake.

1171
00:57:30,145 --> 00:57:31,908
Oh my God.

1172
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,610
- [dance music playing]
- Tanya: Come on, y'all!

1173
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,846
I pretend to be
Jefferson's nanny.

1174
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:40,083
But I was really hired
to watch her.

1175
00:57:40,122 --> 00:57:42,249
Yoo-hooo!

1176
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:44,987
And this is what she's
like after Betty Ford.

1177
00:57:45,027 --> 00:57:47,757
- Oh!
- Doesn't her husband care?

1178
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:51,324
- Whoo!
- He's 75. She's an ex-showgirl.

1179
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:54,767
He's not complaining
about anything.

Frosting fun!
Yay!

I want to come here every day.

Hey.

1184
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:09,408
What are you doing here?

1185
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,513
And what is all over you?

1186
00:58:13,555 --> 00:58:17,355
Lynette: Annie, will you tell me
what the hell is going on?

1187
00:58:17,392 --> 00:58:20,088
All right, listen up, people.
This is my apartment.

1188
00:58:20,128 --> 00:58:22,892
And my roommate Lisa
is away

1189

on-- on business.

1190
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:28,131
You are... oh,
just visiting.

1191
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,468
- He is...
- Lynette's new boyfriend.

1192
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:32,133
- Fine.
- I love your friends.

1193
00:58:32,174 --> 00:58:33,903
What twisted game
are we playing here?

1194
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:36,241
We're playing the

then-I'm-screwed game.

1196
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:41,176
I love it. Hey, should I whip up
a fondue for Mom?

1197
00:58:41,216 --> 00:58:43,343
Um, well, you know what?
If you're gonna play it straight,

1198
00:58:43,385 --> 00:58:45,080
I would make it meatloaf.
I'm gonna borrow this.

1199
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,247
That's my dress.
You can't borrow that dress.

1200
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:49,154
It's a terrible dress.

1201
00:58:49,191 --> 00:58:51,352
Fondue?
Go get my dress.

1202
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:56,194
Oh boy, Calvin.
Thank you so much. That looks delicious.

1203

It's so festively
presented too.

1204
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:06,738
So, how did you
and Lynette meet?

1205
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:11,711
Annie's roommate Lisa
introduced us.

1206
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:14,376
It's a shame
she's not here.

1207
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,816
I used to
date her too.

1208
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:19,413
Really?

1209
00:59:19,454 --> 00:59:22,355
So...

1210
00:59:22,391 --> 00:59:24,621
don't you just love
Annie's new place?

1211
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,094
- Mm-hm.
- We do.

1212
00:59:27,129 --> 00:59:29,324
We're here all the time.

1213
00:59:29,364 --> 00:59:32,731
Yeah, I think it's very--
very interesting.

1214
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,760
- It's a little small, but...
- Mmm.

1215
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:37,329
...it's a fine
steppingstone, honey.

It's work.
I'll take that.

1218
00:59:44,446 --> 00:59:47,813
Well, certainly
keeping her busy.

1219
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,112
- Very busy.
- Mm-hm.

1220
00:59:49,151 --> 00:59:50,846
- Busy bee.
- Relentlessly.

1221
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:53,355
- Round the clock.
- Hello?

1222
00:59:53,388 --> 00:59:56,323
This isn't a brontosaurus.
You don't know anything.

1223
00:59:56,358 --> 00:59:59,657
Oh, Grayer!
Please!

1224
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:02,722
It is yoga hour
and Mommy's on the phone.

1225
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:03,857
Hello?

1226
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,834
Yes, hi.
It's me.

1227
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:08,098
I-- I know that I agreed
to let you

1228
01:00:08,136 --> 01:00:10,331
visit your grandmother in
the hospital tonight,

1229
01:00:10,372 --> 01:00:13,671
but I feel I need to remind you
that tomorrow is Grayer's birthday.

1230
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:16,701
What? How can that be?
His party isn't until next month.

1231
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,543
Well, we scheduled it
that way on purpose

1232
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:21,105
because the party planner
I wanted wasn't available.

1233
01:00:21,149 --> 01:00:23,777
Neither was my husband.
But as it turns out,

1234
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,220
Mr. X is coming home
for two days from Chicago,

1235
01:00:26,254 --> 01:00:29,155
so we're planning a small
family celebration.

1236
01:00:29,191 --> 01:00:31,853
Oh that's lovely.
Grayer couldn't ask for a better gift.

1237
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:34,658
And then afterwards,
we'll all head over to the Carlyle

1238
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:36,789
for a more formal
affair with friends.

1239
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:39,131
Obviously, I do expect
you to attend.

1240
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:40,691
Okay, all right.

1241
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,329
So you will need to dress
appropriately.

1242
01:00:42,371 --> 01:00:43,702
- Right.
- Anyway...

1243
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:45,900
since you are not
around to help,

1244
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,705
- I've taken care of everything.
- Mommy, play!

1245
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,541
Thank you.

1246
01:00:49,578 --> 01:00:53,014
Also, some roses
arrived for you.

1247
01:00:53,048 --> 01:00:55,573
- Roses?
- Yes, very curious.

1248
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:58,485

"Accept my apology,

Yes.

let me kiss you right about now.

the truth,

is all I've really thought
about since that day

- Yeah.

1404
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:07,608
[elevator dings]

1405
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,515
Good night.

1406
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:11,212
Uh-huh.

1407
01:08:13,054 --> 01:08:14,715
[feet clomping]

1408
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:18,649
[Annie sighs]

1409
01:08:25,366 --> 01:08:27,231
- Look out for the--
- [object crashes]

1410
01:08:27,268 --> 01:08:28,326
Annie:
Sorry.

1411
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:45,514
Annie's voice:
While doing field work,

1412
01:08:45,553 --> 01:08:48,386
anthropologists have been
known to lose themselves

1413
01:08:48,423 --> 01:08:50,414
in the very society
that they're studying,

1414
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:53,916
a phenomenon known
as "going native."

1415
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,726
When this occurs,

1416
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:59,291
the proper course of action
is to remove oneself

1417
01:08:59,334 --> 01:09:01,131
ASAP.

1418
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,069
After my night
with Harvard Hottie,

1419
01:09:06,107 --> 01:09:07,631
it became quite obvious

1420
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:11,737
that my obsession with
the Xs meant I'd gone native.

1421
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,839
Daydreaming in
the park that day,

1422
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:17,011
I came to the conclusion that
the only right thing to do

1423
01:09:17,051 --> 01:09:19,485
was confront Mrs. X...

1424
01:09:19,521 --> 01:09:21,182
and quit.

1425
01:09:23,424 --> 01:09:25,415
Mrs. X:
Oh, I forgot about this.

1426
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,860
- Annie: Wow.
- Mrs. X: This could work.

1427
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:32,896
Mmm.

1428
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:35,426
See if you can find me
something short.

1429
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,597
It'll go better
with this neckline.

1430
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,130
Okay.

1431
01:09:42,477 --> 01:09:44,536
Oh.

1432
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:47,275
Did Grayer
get you this?

1433
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:51,718
God.

1434
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:55,121
I bought this for
my mother when I was 10.

1435
01:09:55,156 --> 01:09:59,525
She got mad at me, refused to wear it.
She said it was common.

1436
01:09:59,561 --> 01:10:03,053
I think I saved it
out of spite.

1437
01:10:17,245 --> 01:10:19,805
How about this?

1438
01:10:21,316 --> 01:10:24,877
Mr. X bought it for me for our first
wedding anniversary.

1439
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,480
So it's only fitting
that I should wear it tonight,

1440
01:10:27,522 --> 01:10:28,648
right?

1441
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,885
Definitely.

1442
01:10:41,336 --> 01:10:44,305
Mrs. X, I need to
talk to you about something.

1443
01:10:45,707 --> 01:10:47,607
I know you're really
busy tonight,

1444
01:10:47,642 --> 01:10:49,735
so I was wondering if we
could schedule some time

1445
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:52,508
- tomorrow night to talk.
- What is it, Nanny?

1446
01:10:54,749 --> 01:10:57,411
I-- I think it's better
if we talk alone.

1447
01:10:57,452 --> 01:10:59,682
What is it?

1448
01:11:01,356 --> 01:11:03,620
Mrs. X:
Nanny, lend a hand.

1449
01:11:11,799 --> 01:11:13,528
[zips]

1450
01:11:21,009 --> 01:11:23,500
Well?

1451
01:11:23,544 --> 01:11:25,535
You look amazing.

1452
01:11:27,215 --> 01:11:29,547
- Really?
- You look very pretty, Mommy.

1453
01:11:29,584 --> 01:11:32,144
And-- and you like
the Dior?

1454
01:11:32,186 --> 01:11:35,178
I mean, I know
it's a little much for dinner,

1455
01:11:35,223 --> 01:11:36,554
but afterwards
he's taking me

1456
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,152
to the President's
Circle Gala at the Met.

1457
01:11:39,193 --> 01:11:40,854
Well, I couldn't imagine
a more perfect dress

1458
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:42,523
for a romantic
anniversary.

1459
01:11:42,563 --> 01:11:44,963
All I need now
is my husband.

1460
01:11:46,334 --> 01:11:48,996
I just called
the airport.

1461
01:11:49,037 --> 01:11:52,234
There wasn't a single
delay or cancellation out of Chicago

1462
01:11:52,273 --> 01:11:54,366
so...

1463
01:11:54,409 --> 01:11:56,673
Where can
that man be?

1464
01:11:58,313 --> 01:12:00,645
Nanny,
call La Grande Nuit

1465
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:02,274
- and tell them we're running late.
- Come on.

1466
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:03,875
I don't want to
lose the reservation.

1467
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:06,513
Is it "Le Grande Nuit"
or "La Grande..."

1468
01:12:06,554 --> 01:12:08,647
"Le... Les"?

1469
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:10,157
I think it's "La."

1470
01:12:10,191 --> 01:12:11,988
[phone rings]

1471
01:12:12,026 --> 01:12:13,891
Thanks, smarty-pants.

1472
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:19,190
- Hello?
- Mr. X: Uh yeah, it's me.

1473
01:12:19,233 --> 01:12:21,133
Listen, I'm losing
cell service here.

1474
01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:23,364
I need you to find
my wife and explain to her

1475
01:12:23,404 --> 01:12:25,235
that my flight
was canceled.

1476
01:12:25,273 --> 01:12:28,265
Uh, and since I'm gonna have to be back
here Sunday night,

1477
01:12:28,309 --> 01:12:30,174
I'm just gonna spend
the whole weekend in Chicago.

1478
01:12:30,211 --> 01:12:32,702
- No no no...
- Make sure to tell her I'm sorry.

1479
01:12:32,747 --> 01:12:34,715
No no no, Mr. X, you can't do this.
Look, she--

1480
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,581
[line goes dead]

1481
01:12:40,588 --> 01:12:43,386
Nanny, who was it?

1482
01:12:50,198 --> 01:12:51,859
What did he say?

1483
01:12:53,434 --> 01:12:55,368
Um...

1484
01:12:57,038 --> 01:12:59,563
he said that...

1485
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:01,132
his flight was canceled.

1486
01:13:03,144 --> 01:13:06,307
And...

1487
01:13:06,347 --> 01:13:09,544
and he's very
very sorry.

1488
01:13:16,057 --> 01:13:18,491
Make sure you
put that one on top.

1489
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:19,653
I don't want
anything to wrinkle.

1490
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:23,495
Mommy,
where are you going?

1491
01:13:26,367 --> 01:13:27,891
Mommy, don't go!

1492
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:31,269
No, Gray-- no, Grayer.
Don't-- don't be difficult.

1493
01:13:31,305 --> 01:13:34,035
Mommy has to go away for
a few days to get some rest.

1494
01:13:34,075 --> 01:13:37,203
Nanny, I've decided to
take a few days off.

1495
01:13:37,245 --> 01:13:40,214
I'll be at the spa
at Canyon Ranch in Lenox.

1496
01:13:40,248 --> 01:13:43,411
- Maria has all my numbers.
- Oh God.

1497
01:13:45,219 --> 01:13:48,746
Grayer:
Nanny, can we go upstairs?

1498
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,817
- I feel funny.
- [beeping]

1499
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:55,421
Oh my God!
How did this come on so fast? 104?

1500
01:13:55,463 --> 01:13:57,192
[moans]

1501
01:13:57,231 --> 01:13:58,493
[vomits]

1502
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:00,558
Oh my God, oh my God.
Okay okay.

1503
01:14:00,601 --> 01:14:02,535
Honey, come here.
You okay?

1504
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:03,901
I'm so sorry.

1505
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:06,533
That's okay, that's okay.
All right.

1506
01:14:08,209 --> 01:14:10,200
Okay, wait.
No.

1507
01:14:10,244 --> 01:14:12,303
Hey, Lynette, it's Annie.
Listen, I need your help.

1508
01:14:12,346 --> 01:14:14,246
Grayer has
a temperature of 104

1509
01:14:14,282 --> 01:14:16,614
and I have vomit all over me
and there's nobody here.

1510
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,119
God. Did you
call his mother?

1511
01:14:18,152 --> 01:14:20,416
Yes, I called his mother.
She's at some friggin' spa.

1512
01:14:20,455 --> 01:14:22,480
I left three messages
and she won't call me back.

1513
01:14:22,523 --> 01:14:24,388
- I don't know what to do.
- [Grayer coughs]

1514
01:14:24,425 --> 01:14:26,359
I mean, should I take him to
the emergency room or something?

1515
01:14:26,394 --> 01:14:28,453
- Annie, I can't answer that.
- I...

1516
01:14:28,496 --> 01:14:31,192
- [Grayer coughing]
- Do you know a number of a doctor

1517
01:14:31,232 --> 01:14:33,700
I could call for advice,
or a nurse even?

1518
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:35,032
Of course I know a nurse.

1519
01:14:35,069 --> 01:14:36,969
Your mother.

1520
01:14:39,106 --> 01:14:40,869
Grayer:
Nanny?

1521
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:43,002
Lynette, I have to
call you back.

1522
01:14:43,044 --> 01:14:45,376
What is it, sweetheart?
What's wrong?

1523
01:14:49,016 --> 01:14:51,985
I want my mommy.

1524
01:14:54,322 --> 01:14:56,256
Me too.

1525
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:58,190
[water running]

1526
01:14:58,226 --> 01:14:59,921
[Grayer coughing]

1527
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:01,987
How is everything?

1528
01:15:02,029 --> 01:15:04,429
His fever's down.

1529
01:15:04,465 --> 01:15:06,729
But I think he's
got the croup.

1530
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:09,464
The steam should help
open his passages

1531
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:13,406
and hopefully it'll ease up his cough
and he can get some rest.

1532
01:15:13,441 --> 01:15:15,602
Is-- is there anything
I can do?

1533
01:15:15,643 --> 01:15:18,339
Just close the door.

1534
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,085
[sighs]

1535
01:15:29,123 --> 01:15:30,590
He's okay now.

1536
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:32,252
Much better.

1537
01:15:32,293 --> 01:15:33,760
Oh, thank you, God.

1538
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:36,263
Even so, you should bring him
to the doctor in the morning.

1539
01:15:36,297 --> 01:15:38,527
He's probably gonna
need a prescription.

1540
01:15:38,566 --> 01:15:39,828
Okay.

1541
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,132
Hey, Ma, um...

1542
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,207
I-- I don't know
how to...

1543
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,674
thank you for
coming here, and helping--

1544
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:50,610
Why'd you lie
to me, Annie?

1545
01:15:54,315 --> 01:15:56,681
I have never lied to you.

1546
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,242
Ever.

1547
01:15:58,286 --> 01:15:59,548
I know.

1548
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:02,853
I just...

1549
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:07,455
Oh, Mom, I couldn't
handle it anymore.

1550
01:16:07,495 --> 01:16:08,928
- I just couldn't handle it.
- What?

1551
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:11,489
What couldn't you handle?
You're young, you're smart,

1552
01:16:11,532 --> 01:16:15,195
you're energetic. You got this
incredibly bright future ahead of you.

1553
01:16:15,236 --> 01:16:16,669
It was too bright, Ma.
All right?

1554
01:16:16,704 --> 01:16:19,104
I just-- I just, I got--
I had to get away.

1555
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:21,108
And do this?

1556
01:16:21,142 --> 01:16:23,542
You understand?
Every night shift I worked,

1557
01:16:23,578 --> 01:16:26,138
every overtime hour
I accepted,

1558
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:29,172
I did it because I wanted
something better for you than I had.

1559
01:16:30,184 --> 01:16:32,948
Nanny!
Good, you're up.

1560
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:34,478
Just leave that there.

1561
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:37,788
So listen, the spa
was just awful,

1562
01:16:37,825 --> 01:16:41,261
totally overrun
with suburban riffraff.

1563
01:16:41,295 --> 01:16:43,286
And then in the middle
of my body scrub,

1564
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:45,925
Mr. X called
and believe it or not,

1565
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:48,732
he wants to take us
all to Nantucket next week.

1566
01:16:48,769 --> 01:16:51,829
So I figured I might as well
cut my trip short and...

1567
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:56,104
Who's this?

1568
01:16:56,143 --> 01:16:57,838
I'm Judy.

1569
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:00,370
It's my mom.

1570
01:17:01,515 --> 01:17:04,507
You never mentioned
you had a mother, Nanny.

1571
01:17:04,552 --> 01:17:07,316
Um...

1572
01:17:07,355 --> 01:17:10,017
my mom's a nurse.
She came over here to help me.

1573
01:17:10,057 --> 01:17:13,220
Grayer's been very
very very sick.

1574
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,558
- I tried calling you--
- Where is he?

1575
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:19,033
Well he's--
he's sleeping now.

1576
01:17:19,066 --> 01:17:21,125
Then he can't be
that sick now, can he?

1577
01:17:21,168 --> 01:17:23,500
So listen, could you
quickly unpack my luggage

1578
01:17:23,537 --> 01:17:25,505
and just put everything
in the laundry?

1579
01:17:25,539 --> 01:17:28,531
I'm exhausted and Mr. X is expected
sometime before 9:00.

1580
01:17:28,576 --> 01:17:30,976
I will see you
in the morning.

1581
01:17:31,012 --> 01:17:34,209
Oh, very nice
to meet you, Julie.

1582
01:17:34,248 --> 01:17:35,977
Judy.

1583
01:17:41,722 --> 01:17:43,383
[door closes]

1584
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:51,697
Call me when this phase
of your life is over.

1585
01:17:55,369 --> 01:17:58,896
Annie's voice: I desperately wanted
to yell out after her,

1586
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,908
but it was like one of
those awful dreams

1587
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:03,035
where I had no voice.

1588
01:18:03,077 --> 01:18:06,046
- My desire to be an observer of life...
- [door closes]

1589
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,947
...was actually keeping me
from living one.

1590
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:12,420
Clearly, the woman's
heinous.

1591
01:18:12,453 --> 01:18:14,648
You gotta quit.
It's just that simple.

1592
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,557
I can't, all right?
I tried.

1593
01:18:17,591 --> 01:18:20,924
What if I made you
a tempting offer?

1594
01:18:20,962 --> 01:18:23,954
I'm gonna go to my father's house in
Southampton for a month.

1595
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:28,459
I've got to take some time, figure out
if law school is really right for me.

1596
01:18:28,502 --> 01:18:29,867
Why don't you join me?

1597
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:31,998
Do a little soul-searching.

1598
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:34,371
We'd get the whole house to ourselves--
won't cost us a cent.

1599
01:18:34,408 --> 01:18:37,605
We'll walk on the beach.
We'll drink red wine,

1600
01:18:37,645 --> 01:18:40,079
grill fresh fish.

1601
01:18:40,114 --> 01:18:43,572
That sounds like heaven.

1602
01:18:43,617 --> 01:18:46,051
But what if this vacation
can save their marriage?

1603
01:18:46,087 --> 01:18:48,248
If I quit now,
I'll ruin it

1604
01:18:48,289 --> 01:18:50,120
and break Grayer's heart.

1605
01:18:50,157 --> 01:18:53,490
What about my heart?
Do I count for anything?

1606
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:58,531
Come on, say yes.

1607
01:18:58,566 --> 01:19:01,000
Be young with me
in the Hamptons.

1608
01:19:01,035 --> 01:19:03,560
Don't go to Nantucket
with the weirdoes.

1609
01:19:03,604 --> 01:19:05,731
What do you say?

1610
01:19:14,515 --> 01:19:17,484
Not a chance in hell
is there?

1611
01:19:17,518 --> 01:19:20,453
- I can take a hint.
- Come on, I didn't say no.

1612
01:19:20,488 --> 01:19:23,616
You weren't exactly screaming
yes though, were you?

1613
01:19:23,657 --> 01:19:25,682
I'm starting to wonder
if you're really selfless

1614
01:19:25,726 --> 01:19:28,388
or just a little
self-obsessed.

1615
01:19:28,429 --> 01:19:30,329
Thank you.
Thanks.

1616
01:19:30,364 --> 01:19:32,798
I have to go.

1617
01:19:35,269 --> 01:19:39,638
Listen, if you change
your mind, my offer stands.

1618
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:49,348
Grayer: We're going to 'Tucket.
We're going to 'Tucket.

1619
01:19:49,383 --> 01:19:52,648
Guess what else?
I'm getting a puppy.

1620
01:19:52,686 --> 01:19:54,813
- [plane rattles]
- Oh!

1621
01:19:54,855 --> 01:19:57,016
- Oh my God!
- [Grayer laughs]

1622
01:19:59,326 --> 01:20:02,090
Daddy, Daddy,
where's my puppy?

1623
01:20:02,129 --> 01:20:05,496
Been waiting for you right up
in the car there, sport.

1624
01:20:05,533 --> 01:20:07,296
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Mmm.

1625
01:20:07,334 --> 01:20:09,427
A family trip has been
long overdue.

1626
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:12,200
Mmm, listen, I didn't
want to say anything in front of Grayer,

1627
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,207
but the truth is,
I can only stay for a few days.

1628
01:20:14,241 --> 01:20:16,937
They're really pushing me to
finish up in Chicago.

1629
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:19,503
You can't be serious.

1630
01:20:19,547 --> 01:20:21,515
You're not gonna leave us
on this island alone.

1631
01:20:21,549 --> 01:20:23,608
Okay, we'll talk
about it later.

1632
01:20:23,651 --> 01:20:26,313
#  But I'm moving on # 

1633
01:20:26,353 --> 01:20:31,290
#  I'm gonna be your
number one # 

1634
01:20:31,325 --> 01:20:33,987
#  I'm not the kind
of girl # 

1635
01:20:34,028 --> 01:20:38,431
#  Who gives up
just like that # 

1636
01:20:38,465 --> 01:20:40,490
- #  Oh no-o-o-o... # 
- Annie: Hi.

1637
01:20:40,534 --> 01:20:43,526
It's Annie.
I haven't heard from you in a while.

1638
01:20:43,571 --> 01:20:46,062
You're probably
in Southampton,

1639
01:20:46,106 --> 01:20:48,097
but I just wanted to
let you know that...

1640
01:20:48,142 --> 01:20:49,973
my cell phone
doesn't work here.

1641
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:52,774
So if you wanted
to call--

1642
01:20:52,813 --> 01:20:55,179
if you wanted
to call

1643
01:20:55,216 --> 01:20:57,343
- you probably have the number...
- Grayer: Nanny, hurry up!

1644
01:20:57,384 --> 01:20:59,352
...already on your cell phone,
but I will give it to you

1645
01:20:59,386 --> 01:21:02,219
just in case.
It is 508...

1646
01:21:02,256 --> 01:21:04,486
- Mrs. X: Hello?
- Oh.

1647
01:21:04,525 --> 01:21:06,652
- What, hello?
- Hello, Nanny?

1648
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,390
- Wha...
- I need to use this phone.

1649
01:21:08,429 --> 01:21:10,829
- Immediately.
- Okay, so sorry.

1650
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:14,495
- Oh God.
- Nanny, we're going to the beach.

1651
01:21:14,535 --> 01:21:16,901
When I grow up,
I want enough money

1652
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:19,338
to build a real castle.

1653
01:21:19,373 --> 01:21:22,536
Just remember, Grove,
that money can't buy love.

1654
01:21:22,577 --> 01:21:25,569
But Mommy pays you money
and I love you.

1655
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:28,276
Woman:
Surprise surprise, dear.

1656
01:21:30,084 --> 01:21:33,952
- Mother?
- My, you've gotten portly.

1657
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:36,480
Hi, Grandma.

1658
01:21:36,523 --> 01:21:38,650
What the hell
are you doing here?

1659
01:21:38,692 --> 01:21:42,423
Ask your wife.
She's the one who requested I come.

1660
01:21:42,463 --> 01:21:46,092
- Darling, I--
- Not that I need an invitation.

1661
01:21:46,133 --> 01:21:48,260
It is my house.

1662
01:21:48,302 --> 01:21:50,770
I just wanted your mother
to be here for the news.

1663
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:53,433
News, what news?
What in the hell is going on here?

1664
01:21:53,474 --> 01:21:56,910
I'm having another baby.

1665
01:21:59,346 --> 01:22:01,610
Mr. X:
...virtually impossible.

1666
01:22:01,649 --> 01:22:03,378
Mrs. X:
What exactly do you want?

1667
01:22:03,417 --> 01:22:06,181
Mr. X: And now my mother is here
so I can't go to Chicago.

1668
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:08,518
Mrs. X:
One lousy week!

1669
01:22:08,555 --> 01:22:11,490
Mr. X: You know something?
You are an infuriating woman.

1670
01:22:11,525 --> 01:22:12,992
You really are!

1671
01:22:13,027 --> 01:22:15,825
That's what you get for
rejecting debutante season.

1672
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:17,855

1675
01:22:28,175 --> 01:22:29,904
Can you look after
the kids for a minute?

1676
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:32,971
I'm the only nanny here.
I just have to use the restroom.

1677
01:22:33,013 --> 01:22:34,776
Hmm.

1678
01:22:34,816 --> 01:22:37,979
Make it snappy, dear.
I'm on the last chapter.

1679
01:22:38,018 --> 01:22:40,077
Oh, thanks a million.

1680
01:22:53,634 --> 01:22:56,603
Oh.
You look gorgeous.

1681
01:22:58,072 --> 01:23:00,870
Mrs. X:
Listen, I need some nanny advice.

1682
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:02,604
- Okay.
- To tell you the truth,

1683
01:23:02,643 --> 01:23:05,806
I don't know what's gotten
into her lately.

1684
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:08,816
Well, I installed
a Nanny Cam.

1685
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,909
So we'll soon see
the truth.

1686
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:13,785
It might be time
to let her go.

1687
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:19,782
Grayer:
I saw another one.

1688
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,819
Annie:
Make a wish, Grove.

1689
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:25,799
I wish we could stay
in 'Tucket forever,

1690
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:29,200
Mommy, Daddy, you
and my puppy.

1691
01:23:36,176 --> 01:23:38,167
Grove?

1692
01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:46,045
You know I...

1693
01:23:46,086 --> 01:23:49,317
I'm not gonna be
your nanny forever.

1694
01:23:49,356 --> 01:23:52,450
I can't be.

1695
01:23:52,493 --> 01:23:55,929
That doesn't mean I'm not
gonna always be your friend.

1696

What, there's no OJ

about to make some.

Mm-hm.

1699

Where's Grayer?
Isn't he up yet?

1700
01:24:39,606 --> 01:24:42,837
Um, he had a little
trouble sleeping.

1701
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:44,708
So...

1702

Concentrate? You have
got to be kidding me.

1703

All my money and I can't
get fresh-squeezed? Come on.

[chuckles]

at the party, so...

Hmm.

1707
01:25:02,196 --> 01:25:05,688
Well then, why don't you and I
take a little trip to the market

1708
01:25:05,732 --> 01:25:07,529
and get us some, huh?

[sighs]

1719
01:26:08,795 --> 01:26:11,093
- Where's Grayer?
- With his grandmother.

1720
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:15,561
And where, may I ask,
have you been?

1721
01:26:19,006 --> 01:26:20,940
Um...

1722
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:23,500
- I just had to clear my head.
- Did you?

1723
01:26:23,544 --> 01:26:26,672
I imagine your
unacceptable behavior

1724
01:26:26,713 --> 01:26:30,274
has something to do
with that boy in the building.

1725
01:26:30,317 --> 01:26:33,115
Nanny.

1726

I wasn't
born yesterday.

1727
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:38,522
He called several
times this week.

1728
01:26:38,559 --> 01:26:41,050
He called?
Why didn't you tell me?

1729
01:26:41,094 --> 01:26:43,062
I suppose I forgot.

1730
01:26:46,133 --> 01:26:48,658
It's really for
your own good.

1731
01:26:48,702 --> 01:26:51,296
He's a little out of
your league, don't you think?

1732
01:26:51,338 --> 01:26:53,932
It couldn't possibly
end well.

1733
01:26:55,442 --> 01:26:58,411
Clearly this
isn't working out.

1734
01:26:58,445 --> 01:27:00,777
Mr. X has arranged for
a taxi to take you to the ferry

1735
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:02,749
and then for a car to
pick you up on the other end.

1736

Please don't--
please don't do this.

1737
01:27:04,852 --> 01:27:07,878
Not-- not for me,
but for Grayer.

1738
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:11,221
Not until you and your husband work
your problems out.

1739
01:27:11,258 --> 01:27:13,590
Don't you dare.

1740
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:16,392
You stupid--
you stupid girl.

1741
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:19,399
As if you know anything
about my life.

1742
01:27:19,433 --> 01:27:22,163
As if you know anything
about the real world.

01:27:45,259 --> 01:27:47,750
All right, you know what?
Just give me the change

1747
01:27:47,794 --> 01:27:49,989
when you come back for my mother
at some point, okay?

1748
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:51,725
Heep 10 bucks

1749

here's your final payment.

1751
01:27:56,703 --> 01:27:58,534
I expect you to
have all your things

1752
01:27:58,572 --> 01:28:00,540
out of our apartment by
the time we come back.

1753
01:28:00,574 --> 01:28:03,065
Just leave the keys
with the doorman.

1754
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:13,482
Grayer, I think you
should take a nap.

1755
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,045
I'm certainly ready
for one.

Nanny!
Where are you going?

- Nanny!
- Grayer. Grayer.

1758

- Nanny!
- Stay here.

1759
01:28:25,032 --> 01:28:26,932
- Here.
- What are you doing?

1760
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,560
- Take it, take it.
- What?

1761
01:28:28,602 --> 01:28:31,400
I can't tolerate the yapping.
Grayer's too young anyway.

Aha!

01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:46,433
Okay, lady,
you want Nanny Cam?

I'll give you

01:30:57,384 --> 01:31:00,012
happened with a teddy bear.

1787
01:31:07,694 --> 01:31:11,892
After the abrupt termination
of my field work,

1788
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:14,367
I took some time to
make sense

1789
01:31:14,401 --> 01:31:17,598
of all that
I had witnessed.

1790
01:31:17,637 --> 01:31:19,332
During this period

1791
01:31:19,372 --> 01:31:22,034
I read that critics of
anthropology believe

1792
01:31:22,075 --> 01:31:24,305
that just by
observing a culture

1793
01:31:24,344 --> 01:31:26,471
you inevitably change it.

1794
01:31:26,513 --> 01:31:28,640
- Mm!
- Ow! Hey.

1795
01:31:28,682 --> 01:31:31,480
In the many times that
I thought of Grayer,

1796
01:31:31,518 --> 01:31:34,715
I secretly hoped
those critics...

1797
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:36,916
were right.

1798
01:31:38,525 --> 01:31:41,961
This is a tape of
my latest nanny disaster.

1799
01:31:42,028 --> 01:31:45,691
She was extremely problematic,
to say the least.

1800
01:31:45,732 --> 01:31:47,529
She neglected Grayer.

1801
01:31:47,567 --> 01:31:50,730
She drank.
She even flirted with my husband.

1802
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:52,204
I finally had to fire her

1803
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,935
for promiscuous behavior
with a boy in the building.

1804
01:31:54,976 --> 01:31:57,945
This videotape shows her
feeding my child

1805
01:31:57,979 --> 01:32:01,710
peanut butter and jelly
directly from the jar.

1806
01:32:01,748 --> 01:32:03,545
You know, I remember
this nanny.

1807
01:32:03,583 --> 01:32:06,279
She had a very
peculiar attitude.

1808
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:08,287
Let's watch.

1809
01:32:08,321 --> 01:32:10,619
Annie: You excited about
going to Nantucket?

1810
01:32:10,657 --> 01:32:11,817
Yes.

1811
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,349
Okay, well, why don't you
close your eyes

1812
01:32:13,393 --> 01:32:15,725
and you can dream about
building sand castles?

1813
01:32:15,762 --> 01:32:17,457
- I love you, Nanny.
- Good night.

1814
01:32:17,497 --> 01:32:19,965
This must be the wrong tape.
I've never seen this one before.

1815
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,594
It's all right, just let it play out.
We'll get to something good.

1816
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:26,538
[all gasping]

1817
01:32:26,573 --> 01:32:28,768
Oh!
It's a problem.

1818
01:32:28,809 --> 01:32:30,970
Big problem.

1819
01:32:31,011 --> 01:32:34,640
Okay, Mrs. X, now it's time for a few
simple child-care rules.

1820
01:32:34,681 --> 01:32:37,377
Oh, all right. The teddy bear has
been compromised.

1821
01:32:37,417 --> 01:32:40,978
Slamming the door in
your kid's face is not okay.

1822
01:32:41,021 --> 01:32:44,286
Spending more time on a benefit for
kids you've never met

1823
01:32:44,324 --> 01:32:46,792
than you do with
your own blood is not okay.

1824
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:50,661
Going to a spa when
your son has a fever of 104

1825
01:32:50,697 --> 01:32:52,722
and not answering
emergency calls,

1826
01:32:52,767 --> 01:32:54,564
that officially makes you
an unfit mother.

1827
01:32:54,601 --> 01:32:56,000
This is outrageous.
Stop the tape.

1828
01:32:56,036 --> 01:32:59,904
Uh, no, this is clearly
a disgruntled nanny.

1829
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:02,739
We-- we might have
something to learn here.

1830
01:33:02,776 --> 01:33:06,576
Yeah, I know that you're really busy
with your hair appointments

1831
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:08,241
and your Watsu
massages

1832
01:33:08,281 --> 01:33:11,273
and your attempts to stay young
so your husband won't leave you,

1833
01:33:11,318 --> 01:33:15,152
but here's an idea-- why don't you try
eating dinner with your child

1834
01:33:15,188 --> 01:33:16,780
every once in a blue moon?

1835
01:33:16,824 --> 01:33:18,257
And a head's up here,
lady.

1836
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:21,124
Try smiling once in a while.
People hate you!

1837
01:33:21,161 --> 01:33:22,822
[all gasp]

1838
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:24,660
As for you, Mr. X,

1839
01:33:24,698 --> 01:33:26,859
who the hell are you?

1840
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:29,096
Maybe you're asking
the same about me.

1841
01:33:29,135 --> 01:33:30,966
I know you've noticed my ass,

1842
01:33:31,004 --> 01:33:32,869
but you probably don't
recognize my face,

1843
01:33:32,907 --> 01:33:34,670
so here's a little hint,
okay?

1844
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:37,701
I'm the one who's been
raising your son.

1845
01:33:42,449 --> 01:33:44,747
Grayer is not
an accessory.

1846
01:33:44,785 --> 01:33:48,448
His mother didn't
order him from a catalogue.

1847
01:33:48,488 --> 01:33:50,718
Your son, your wife,

1848
01:33:50,758 --> 01:33:53,591
are-- are--

1849
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:55,892
are people in your home,

1850
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:59,866
human beings who are
drowning in their desire

1851
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:02,994
for you to just--
for you to look at them.

1852
01:34:16,851 --> 01:34:20,753
You know, the truth is,
I don't wish either of you harm.

1853
01:34:22,623 --> 01:34:25,456
If for no other reason
than you having

1854
01:34:25,492 --> 01:34:28,859
the profound privilege
of being Grayer's parents.

1855
01:34:31,866 --> 01:34:34,528
Grayer loves you.

1856
01:34:36,569 --> 01:34:38,469
He...

1857
01:34:38,505 --> 01:34:42,202
he doesn't care what you're
wearing or what you buy him

1858
01:34:42,242 --> 01:34:43,971
or what school
he gets into.

1859
01:34:44,010 --> 01:34:47,878
He just-- he just
wants you there.

1860
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:50,247
That's it.

1861
01:34:51,851 --> 01:34:54,513
And time's running out,

1862
01:34:54,554 --> 01:34:57,022
and he won't love you
unconditionally that much longer.

1863
01:34:57,057 --> 01:35:00,185
So...

1864
01:35:00,226 --> 01:35:02,922
for your own good,

1865
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:05,363
don't miss out
on getting to know him.

1866
01:35:05,398 --> 01:35:09,095
He is--
he's truly

1867
01:35:09,135 --> 01:35:13,595
an amazing
amazing little person.

1868
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,733
[leash rattles]

1869
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:37,588
Excuse me.

1870
01:35:37,631 --> 01:35:40,122
Of course.

1871
01:35:55,381 --> 01:35:57,440
Buenas noches.

1872
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:06,485
It's a much tougher game
out there for women.

1873
01:36:06,526 --> 01:36:08,153
[sighs]

1874
01:36:08,194 --> 01:36:11,493
Nature deals us
some tricky cards.

1875
01:36:11,531 --> 01:36:13,522
Is that so hard
for you to understand?

1876
01:36:13,566 --> 01:36:15,329
No.

1877
01:36:15,368 --> 01:36:18,132
I don't know, Mom.
I just...

1878
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:23,232
So I guess you're not
going into finance?

1879
01:36:23,276 --> 01:36:26,006
I don't think that having money
makes it any easier.

1880
01:36:26,045 --> 01:36:28,639
You know,
I know that now.

1881
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:34,253
It's okay.

1882
01:36:34,287 --> 01:36:36,118
It's your life.

1883
01:36:36,156 --> 01:36:38,181
Personally, I think
you're making a big mistake.

1884
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:45,790
But it is your life.

1885
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:48,358
I want you
to be happy.

1886
01:36:53,606 --> 01:36:55,471
Hey.

1887
01:36:55,508 --> 01:36:57,373
- Hayden.
- Annie's voice: Oh, that's right.

1888
01:36:57,410 --> 01:36:59,571
I forgot to mention
his name is Hayden.

1889
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:01,638
And once I finally
let myself say it,

1890
01:37:01,681 --> 01:37:03,649
it was a habit that
was pretty hard to break.

1891
01:37:03,684 --> 01:37:05,584
It is-- it's going
pretty good actually.

1892
01:37:05,618 --> 01:37:07,950
There's more scholarships
out there than I thought.

1893
01:37:07,988 --> 01:37:10,218
So why are you
so late?

1894
01:37:10,256 --> 01:37:13,384
Because I have
something for you.

1895
01:37:13,426 --> 01:37:15,690
It's from
your former employer.

1896
01:37:15,728 --> 01:37:16,786
What?

1897
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:18,890
She cornered me
on the 12th floor,

1898
01:37:18,933 --> 01:37:22,733
figured I could get
to you before she could.

1899
01:37:25,572 --> 01:37:28,234
I don't want to
read this.

1900
01:37:28,274 --> 01:37:30,868
- Why don't I read it to you?
- Okay.

1901
01:37:36,549 --> 01:37:38,016
"Dear Annie...

1902
01:37:40,353 --> 01:37:43,413
It's been several months
since we've spoken.

1903
01:37:43,456 --> 01:37:46,892
Even so, the things you said
on that tape haunt me every day.

1904
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:50,658
And now looking back,
I don't know what to say

1905
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,757
except thank you...

1906
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,530
- and I'm sorry."
- Mrs. X: "And I'm sorry.

1907
01:37:55,568 --> 01:37:57,695
You were so right.

1908
01:37:57,738 --> 01:38:01,697
Of all my privileges,
Grayer is my greatest.

1909
01:38:01,741 --> 01:38:05,199
I desperately needed
someone to show me that.

1910
01:38:05,245 --> 01:38:06,906
You did.

1911
01:38:06,947 --> 01:38:10,212
And for that,
I owe you the world.

1912
01:38:11,618 --> 01:38:13,586
You may or may not
be surprised

1913
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:15,645
to learn that
I've left my husband.

1914
01:38:15,688 --> 01:38:17,713
Not out of the jar.

1915
01:38:17,757 --> 01:38:19,452
Try it.

1916
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:22,886
Any man who made me
feel desperate enough

1917
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:25,592
to feign a pregnancy
wasn't worth fighting for.

1918
01:38:25,632 --> 01:38:27,395
Isn't it good?

1919
01:38:29,502 --> 01:38:31,936
Yeah.

1920
01:38:31,972 --> 01:38:33,371
Yeah, it is good.

1921
01:38:33,406 --> 01:38:35,806
So I'm pretty confident
that in time

1922
01:38:35,843 --> 01:38:37,640
we'll be getting
along just fine.

1923
01:38:37,677 --> 01:38:39,508
Yeah, it's really good.

1924
01:38:39,545 --> 01:38:42,173
It's really good.
[laughs]

1925
01:38:42,215 --> 01:38:45,742
Please know that I wish
you all the best in life.

1926
01:38:45,786 --> 01:38:47,913
- Sincerely..."
- "Sincerely...

1927
01:38:47,955 --> 01:38:50,219
Alexandra.

1928
01:38:50,256 --> 01:38:52,281
P.S...

1929
01:38:55,061 --> 01:38:58,394
I'm happy to report that Grayer asks
for you a little bit less

1930
01:38:58,431 --> 01:39:01,696
every day and every night."

1931
01:39:11,144 --> 01:39:12,907
- Come on.
- Okay.

1932
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:14,175
Let's get out of here.

1933
01:39:14,213 --> 01:39:16,010
Catching the Yankees game
with my dad tonight.

1934
01:39:16,049 --> 01:39:18,313
- Sounds wonderful.
- Yeah.

1935
01:39:18,351 --> 01:39:22,287
Annie's voice: There's a popular belief
amongst anthropologists

1936
01:39:22,322 --> 01:39:26,281
that you must immerse
yourself in an unfamiliar world

1937
01:39:26,326 --> 01:39:30,319
in order to truly
understand your own.

1938
01:39:31,531 --> 01:39:34,056
I've probably gotta
get going soon actually.

1939
01:39:36,936 --> 01:39:38,494
See you
later tonight, okay?

1940
01:39:38,538 --> 01:39:40,301
Yeah.

1941
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:42,501
I certainly hope so.

1942
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,373
Annie's voice:
In conclusion,

1943
01:39:49,416 --> 01:39:51,646
I hope this field diary
has been illuminating

1944
01:39:51,684 --> 01:39:55,051
for those considering my application
to graduate school.

1945
01:39:55,088 --> 01:39:56,555
[typing]

1946
01:39:56,589 --> 01:39:58,489
It certainly has been
for me.

1947
01:39:58,524 --> 01:40:00,685
#  Oh yeah # 

1948
01:40:03,596 --> 01:40:06,497
After a lost summer
of being Nanny,

1949
01:40:06,532 --> 01:40:09,194
I finally got to know Annie.

1950
01:40:13,539 --> 01:40:15,837
Thanks to a little man
named Grayer,

1951
01:40:15,876 --> 01:40:18,777
I only had to trek
across the Hudson River

1952
01:40:18,812 --> 01:40:21,781
to make this most
amazing discovery.

1953
01:40:21,814 --> 01:40:23,645
- #  I won't let you down # 
- # freedom #

1954
01:40:23,683 --> 01:40:26,151
- #  I will not give you up # 
- # freedom #

1955
01:40:26,185 --> 01:40:27,584
#  Have some faith
in the sound # 

1956
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:29,554
#  You got to give
what you take # 

1957
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:31,080
# freedom #

1958
01:40:31,124 --> 01:40:33,115
#  I won't let you down # 

1959
01:40:33,159 --> 01:40:36,026
- # freedom #
- #  So please don't give me up. # 

1960
01:40:36,061 --> 01:40:37,926
[music fades out]

1961
01:40:40,867 --> 01:40:42,892
#  Wake up one morning # 

1962
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:45,996
#  You realize # 

1963
01:40:46,039 --> 01:40:49,065
#  Your life is one
big compromise # 

1964
01:40:49,108 --> 01:40:50,769
#  Compromise # 

1965
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:55,510
#  Stuck in the job you swore
was only temporary # 

1966
01:40:55,548 --> 01:40:57,379
#  Was only temporary # 

1967
01:40:57,417 --> 01:41:00,386
# Yeah #

1968
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:03,548
#  Feel like the world
is passing you by # 

1969
01:41:03,589 --> 01:41:05,318
#  Doo-doo-doo doo-doo # 

1970
01:41:05,358 --> 01:41:08,293
#  Never done all the things
you wanted to try # 

1971
01:41:08,327 --> 01:41:10,488
#  Stuck in one place # 

1972
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:12,658
#  Got a pain in your face # 

1973
01:41:12,698 --> 01:41:15,292
#  From all your stressin' out,
all your stressin' out # 

1974
01:41:15,334 --> 01:41:17,131
#  All your stressin' out # 

1975
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:20,071
#  Hey, you ask yourself # 

1976
01:41:20,106 --> 01:41:22,540
#  There's got to be more # 

1977
01:41:22,575 --> 01:41:24,736
#  Than what
I'm living for #

there's got to be # 

1981
01:41:30,651 --> 01:41:33,279
#  Something else # 

1982
01:41:33,319 --> 01:41:36,083
#  Something more, more #

01:41:36,122 --> 01:41:39,649
#  More,

#  On your face # 

1985
01:41:41,828 --> 01:41:44,160
#  And don't let your life # 

1986
01:41:44,197 --> 01:41:46,961
#  Go to waste # 

1987
01:41:46,999 --> 01:41:48,466
#  Now is the time # 

1988
01:41:48,501 --> 01:41:51,732

#  Feel like there's nothing,

01:42:01,147 --> 01:42:02,944
#  Doo-doo-doo doo-doo # 

1993
