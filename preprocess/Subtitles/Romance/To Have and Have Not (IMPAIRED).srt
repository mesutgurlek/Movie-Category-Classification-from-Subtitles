- Yeah. Why?

There were some people in here today.
They wanted to hire your boat.

I'd like to oblige, but I can't afford
to get mixed up in local politics.

don't you, Steve?

00:41:39,352 --> 00:41:42,071
You just put your lips together and blow.

Go on.

You come along the lee shore of Anguilla
from the south.

- Emil can show you.

- Emil's not gonna be there.
- Why?

I'm doing this my way. I'm going alone.

What are the signals?

You flash a light to the shore.
They will answer it with two lights.

625
00:42:44,752 --> 00:42:47,550
One held above the other.
There'll be two people to bring back.

- How'll I know them?
- We've never seen them.

We know the name of one only.
Paul de Bursac.

That's good enough.
How about landing them back here?

- You be on that boat, Frenchy.

Supposedly fishing.

With luck and no patrol boats,
I'll be back in Saint-Pierre at midnight.

to have anything to do with us.

I'm not. I'm getting paid.

No. They are watching all doctors

Why did you put a pillow under it?

- Why not?
- It doesn't hurt so much that way.

It'll have to hurt, you'll have to take it...

All right, I'll take that.

Are you a doctor?

No. But I've handled
quite a lot of gunshot wounds.

You want to help your husband, don't you?
Then use your head.

912
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,302
We can't get a doctor
without giving the show away.

913
01:02:24,392 --> 01:02:26,952
Besides, he's got as good a chance
with me as anybody.

914
01:02:27,032 --> 01:02:28,465
I'm not going to let you do it.

915
01:02:28,552 --> 01:02:30,463
Why not?
He's no different from anybody else.

916
01:02:30,552 --> 01:02:34,101
Just a little sicker, that's all.
It means he's not worth so much.

917
01:02:38,272 --> 01:02:40,069
You can have another crack at me later on.

918
01:02:40,152 --> 01:02:41,505
- Hello, Slim.
- Hello.

919
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,025
Miss Browning, <i>Madame</i> de Bursac.

920
01:02:43,112 --> 01:02:45,626
Don't get tough with Slim.
She's apt to slap you back.

921
01:02:45,712 --> 01:02:47,987
<i>That's what you said you'd do, wasn't it?</i>

922
01:02:48,192 --> 01:02:49,784
Bring the water in here.

923
01:02:49,952 --> 01:02:51,908
- Wait a minute...
- He's trying to help you.

924
01:02:51,992 --> 01:02:54,904
- Who are you?
- Nobody. Just another volunteer.

925
01:02:58,272 --> 01:03:00,786
SLIM: Where do you want this water?
MORGAN: In that basin.

926
01:03:01,712 --> 01:03:03,111
MORGAN: Is it hot?
SLIM: Boiling.

927
01:03:05,392 --> 01:03:08,543
All right, then.
Pour some of this in it. And drop these in.

928
01:03:11,472 --> 01:03:14,623
- Get out of here. You may not like this.
- I'll be all right.

929
01:03:16,312 --> 01:03:17,540
MORGAN: Then take this.

930
01:03:18,392 --> 01:03:20,030
- What is it?
- Chloroform.

931
01:03:20,112 --> 01:03:22,910
Get over by his head.
If he comes to while I'm probing...

932
01:03:22,992 --> 01:03:26,109
pour some of it on a hunk of cotton
and give him a whiff of it.

933
01:03:26,672 --> 01:03:28,663
Don't open it till I tell you to.

934
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:31,869
Take out about four of those.

935
01:03:36,272 --> 01:03:39,628
MORGAN: Bring that lamp a little closer
so I can see what I'm doing.

936
01:03:47,632 --> 01:03:48,747
That's good.

937
01:03:52,512 --> 01:03:54,070
All right, Slim.

938
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:01,384
Hold that a minute.

939
01:04:06,272 --> 01:04:07,500
Easy, boy.

940
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:10,462
<i>All right, open that can</i>
<i>and give him some.</i>

941
01:04:10,552 --> 01:04:13,112
<i>George, see if you can hold his head down.</i>

942
01:04:13,272 --> 01:04:14,591
Come on, hurry up.

943
01:04:16,632 --> 01:04:19,863
That's fine. Don't worry about her.
Pick up that can.

944
01:04:21,952 --> 01:04:24,182
- Any of it left?
- I think there's enough.

945
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:31,263
Wait a minute, I don't think we'll need it.
He's out, too.

946
01:04:32,352 --> 01:04:34,468
Bring that lamp down a little lower.

947
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,988
Frenchy, bring that basin over here.

948
01:04:41,392 --> 01:04:44,782
And fan some of those fumes away,
will you, or we'll all be out.

949
01:04:58,992 --> 01:05:01,745
There you are, Frenchy, there's your bullet.

950
01:05:02,472 --> 01:05:05,111
I told you it was spent.
It would have smashed the bone.

951
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:07,023
All right, I don't need that.

952
01:05:21,592 --> 01:05:24,948
All right, you finish bandaging it up.
Adhesive tape in the box.

953
01:05:25,432 --> 01:05:28,549
I got to get nursie out of here,
or she never will come to.

954
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:43,021
What are you trying to do,
guess her weight?

955
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,269
She's heftier than you think.

956
01:05:51,032 --> 01:05:54,388
- You'd better loosen her clothes.
- You've been doing all right.

957
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:00,301
Maybe you'd better
look after her husband.

958
01:06:00,512 --> 01:06:03,106
- He's not gonna run out on me.
- Neither is she.

959
01:06:09,272 --> 01:06:12,309
Is it all right
if I give her a little whiff of this?

960
01:06:24,032 --> 01:06:26,023
[Paul mumbling]

961
01:06:28,512 --> 01:06:30,230
You're with us again.

962
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:33,228
You were lucky. You passed out.

963
01:06:34,672 --> 01:06:36,549
What happened? We must...

964
01:06:36,632 --> 01:06:40,466
We'll talk about that in the morning.
See if you can get some sleep.

965
01:06:41,592 --> 01:06:42,661
Thanks.

966
01:06:59,352 --> 01:07:02,310
Why did you ever come along with him
on a trip like this?

967
01:07:02,392 --> 01:07:06,101
I love him. I want to be with him.

968
01:07:07,552 --> 01:07:10,624
MORGAN: That's a reason.
HELENE: There's another reason.

969
01:07:11,592 --> 01:07:13,947
<i>They told me to come, our people did.</i>

970
01:07:17,312 --> 01:07:21,385
They said no man was much good
if he left someone behind in France...

971
01:07:21,472 --> 01:07:23,747
for the Germans to find and hold.

972
01:07:25,912 --> 01:07:29,427
- That makes sense.
- I told them I'd only be in the way...

973
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:32,584
that I could do no good, that I was afraid.

974
01:07:35,112 --> 01:07:38,900
But the worst of it is that it's been so hard
for him to have me along...

975
01:07:40,952 --> 01:07:44,740
because I've made him that way, too.
Now he's afraid.

976
01:07:47,712 --> 01:07:49,430
He didn't invent it.

977
01:07:50,072 --> 01:07:52,108
HELENE: Invent what?
MORGAN: Being afraid.

978
01:07:55,152 --> 01:07:56,551
Thanks, Mr. Morgan.

979
01:08:13,272 --> 01:08:14,830
The fever's gone.

980
01:08:16,912 --> 01:08:18,903
Do you...

981
01:08:19,232 --> 01:08:21,746
I'm no doctor,
but he looks pretty good to me.

982
01:08:23,832 --> 01:08:26,585
If he wakes up,
give him another one of these pills.

983
01:08:41,032 --> 01:08:44,547
HELENE: Mr. Morgan, I...
MORGAN: You're not gonna faint again?

984
01:08:45,432 --> 01:08:49,903
No, I'm just having a hard time
trying to say something.

985
01:08:50,032 --> 01:08:52,387
Go ahead, say it. I'm not gonna bite you.

986
01:08:53,552 --> 01:08:56,066
If it hadn't been for you,
Paul might have...

987
01:08:57,432 --> 01:08:59,150
I'm sorry for the way I've acted.

988
01:08:59,232 --> 01:09:02,907
You're not sorry at all, you're just sorry
you made a fool of yourself.

989
01:09:03,792 --> 01:09:05,111
I have, haven't I?

990
01:09:08,832 --> 01:09:11,187
You don't make me angry
when you say that.

991
01:09:11,952 --> 01:09:15,183
I don't think I'll ever be angry again
with anything you say.

992
01:09:16,192 --> 01:09:18,342
Another screwy dame.
Now, how can you...

993
01:09:18,432 --> 01:09:22,220
Good morning. I hate to break this up,
but I've brought some breakfast.

994
01:09:24,232 --> 01:09:26,143
HELENE: Morning.
SLIM: How's your patient?

995
01:09:26,232 --> 01:09:28,951
MORGAN: He'll be...
SLIM: Or haven't you looked lately?

996
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:32,308
He'll be all right. I'll be back this evening.

997
01:09:32,872 --> 01:09:35,340
- Lf you need me before then, call me.
- I will.

998
01:09:35,432 --> 01:09:37,787
Yes, and I hope you have everything
you need here.

999
01:09:37,872 --> 01:09:39,464
The eggs may be a little hardboiled...

1000
01:09:39,552 --> 01:09:42,988
- That's all right, I like them that way.
- You're lucky. Isn't she?

1001
01:09:49,152 --> 01:09:51,620
I'm gonna get some sleep,
I'll see you later.

1002
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:56,941
Thanks.

1003
01:09:58,272 --> 01:10:00,866
- What do you want?
- I could use a match.

1004
01:10:09,432 --> 01:10:12,310
Thanks. Now I need a cigarette.

1005
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:25,944
Here, I can do that. Come on, let me help.

1006
01:10:26,032 --> 01:10:29,388
When I get ready to take my shoes off,
I'll take them off myself.

1007
01:10:30,672 --> 01:10:31,787
All right.

1008
01:10:33,112 --> 01:10:35,148
- Want something to eat?
- No.

1009
01:10:36,112 --> 01:10:39,309
- Just a little breakfast?
- All I want to do is get some sleep.

1010
01:10:39,392 --> 01:10:42,065
It's a good idea. I can help you there.

1011
01:10:42,992 --> 01:10:46,667
- Now where are you going?
- I'm going to fix you a nice hot bath.

1012
01:10:47,112 --> 01:10:48,784
It'll make you sleep better.

1013
01:10:48,872 --> 01:10:52,421
I don't want you to take my shoes off,
I don't want you to get me breakfast...

1014
01:10:52,512 --> 01:10:54,389
I don't want you to draw me a hot bath...

1015
01:10:54,472 --> 01:10:57,430
- I don't want you to...
- Isn't there anything I can do, Steve?

1016
01:10:57,512 --> 01:10:59,946
MORGAN: Yes, get the...
SLIM: You know, Mr. Morgan...

1017
01:11:00,032 --> 01:11:02,500
you don't make me angry
when you say that.

1018
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:06,141
I don't think I'll ever be angry again
at anything you say.

1019
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:12,426
How am I doing, Steve,
does it work the second time?

1020
01:11:12,512 --> 01:11:15,470
You've been wanting
to do something for me, haven't you?

1021
01:11:21,552 --> 01:11:23,031
Walk around me.

1022
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:26,067
Go ahead, walk around me, clear around.

1023
01:11:37,552 --> 01:11:39,543
- Did you find anything?
- No.

1024
01:11:40,512 --> 01:11:45,063
No, Steve.
There are no strings tied to you, not yet.

1025
01:11:59,432 --> 01:12:00,626
I like that...

1026
01:12:04,872 --> 01:12:06,351
except for the beard.

1027
01:12:07,992 --> 01:12:09,744
Why don't you shave...

1028
01:12:12,032 --> 01:12:13,511
and we'll try it again.

1029
01:12:13,592 --> 01:12:15,469
[Knocking on door]

1030
01:12:18,992 --> 01:12:20,744
- Later, Frenchy.
- Harry, wait.

1031
01:12:20,832 --> 01:12:23,471
Renard, the Inspector, is downstairs.
You better come down.

1032
01:12:23,552 --> 01:12:26,146
- I can't do that, I got to shave.
- He's got Eddie.

1033
01:12:27,352 --> 01:12:29,627
He's giving him drinks
and asking him questions.

1034
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,350
I was afraid of that.

1035
01:12:32,392 --> 01:12:34,223
Good thing you didn't get me in that tub.

1036
01:12:34,312 --> 01:12:38,021
Look out for those strings, Steve.
You're liable to trip and break your neck.

1037
01:12:38,112 --> 01:12:41,787
- Strings? I didn't see any strings.
- They just don't show, Frenchy.

1038
01:12:44,632 --> 01:12:46,065
You ought to have seen that fish.

1039
01:12:46,152 --> 01:12:48,222
It must have weighed 900
if it weighed a pound.

1040
01:12:48,312 --> 01:12:51,031
It was the biggest marlin you ever seen
in all your born days.

1041
01:12:51,112 --> 01:12:52,704
You know, a marlin is a swordfish.

1042
01:12:52,792 --> 01:12:55,670
- Good morning, <i>Capitaine.</i>
- Hello, Harry. How's everything?

1043
01:12:55,752 --> 01:12:57,265
- Fine.
- Won't you join us?

1044
01:12:57,352 --> 01:12:59,547
It's a little early for this kind of a party.

1045
01:12:59,632 --> 01:13:00,701
Continue, Mr. Eddie.

1046
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:02,623
Did you hear that? He called me mister.

1047
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:04,304
Say, you're all right.

1048
01:13:04,752 --> 01:13:07,471
- Was you ever bit by a...
- No, he never was, Eddie.

1049
01:13:07,552 --> 01:13:09,144
Go on with what you were saying.

1050
01:13:09,232 --> 01:13:12,622
I was just telling him about the big one
we hooked onto last night.

1051
01:13:12,712 --> 01:13:16,148
Sir, that fish was so big
that me and Harry could hardly budge him.

1052
01:13:16,232 --> 01:13:18,792
We pumped on him
until we was all wore out, didn't we?

1053
01:13:18,872 --> 01:13:20,305
MORGAN: That's right, Eddie.

1054
01:13:20,592 --> 01:13:23,026
It was after dark
and we was still playing him.

1055
01:13:23,112 --> 01:13:27,151
He must have weighed
at least 1,000 easy.

1056
01:13:28,312 --> 01:13:32,146
Every time Mr. Eddie takes a drink,
this fabulous fish grows larger.

1057
01:13:32,312 --> 01:13:34,780
He must have started
with a pretty small one.

1058
01:13:35,672 --> 01:13:37,981
How did you finally manage
to land such a leviathan?

1059
01:13:38,072 --> 01:13:39,630
We didn't, didn't he tell you?

1060
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:42,226
- We ran into a German submarine.
- A German submarine?

1061
01:13:42,312 --> 01:13:44,621
Whatever it was,
it turned its light on and fired.

1062
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,589
- I didn't wait to find out.
- I do not think...

1063
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,867
You know,
you can't be too careful these days.

1064
01:13:48,952 --> 01:13:51,830
I do not think anybody
could give a more logical explanation...

1065
01:13:51,912 --> 01:13:55,029
for refusing to obey the challenge
of our patrol boat.

1066
01:13:55,512 --> 01:13:57,901
Not to speak of shooting out
their searchlight.

1067
01:13:57,992 --> 01:13:59,186
- Patrol boat?
- Yes.

1068
01:13:59,272 --> 01:14:00,944
That's what it was. You were right, Eddie.

1069
01:14:01,032 --> 01:14:02,943
EDDIE: I'm a good man in the dark,
always was.

1070
01:14:03,032 --> 01:14:06,229
Funny, he kept saying it was a patrol boat,
but I wouldn't believe him.

1071
01:14:06,312 --> 01:14:09,429
COYO: There is one thing that is not clear
to me, Capt. Morgan.

1072
01:14:09,792 --> 01:14:10,827
What's that?

1073
01:14:10,912 --> 01:14:14,382
COYO: Why does a professional fisherman
go fishing for his own amusement?

1074
01:14:16,352 --> 01:14:19,503
Don't you ever ask any questions?
Don't you ever talk?

1075
01:14:20,912 --> 01:14:23,221
No, I guess you don't.
What were you saying?

1076
01:14:23,312 --> 01:14:27,191
COYO: Does a professional fisherman
go fishing for his own amusement?

1077
01:14:27,792 --> 01:14:29,942
He does if he likes it, and we do, don't we?

1078
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:31,988
Yeah, remember in Key West
when we went...

1079
01:14:32,072 --> 01:14:35,621
- We don't seem to be getting anywhere.
- It was the Fourth of July...

1080
01:14:35,712 --> 01:14:37,942
I was just saying,
Key West, the Fourth of July...

1081
01:14:38,032 --> 01:14:39,829
three years ago at 8:00. I got that in.

1082
01:14:39,912 --> 01:14:42,028
RENARD: What about your passengers?
MORGAN: 7:00.

1083
01:14:42,112 --> 01:14:44,421
<i>You oughtn't to burn up at him,</i>
<i>you fed him the rum.</i>

1084
01:14:44,512 --> 01:14:47,026
RENARD: And your two passengers?
MORGAN: What passengers?

1085
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:48,864
The ones you brought from Anguilla.

1086
01:14:48,952 --> 01:14:51,102
He was waiting on the dock
when we came in.

1087
01:14:51,192 --> 01:14:52,944
You think I got them ashore in my sleeve?

1088
01:14:53,032 --> 01:14:55,626
You could have landed them anywhere
on our coastline.

1089
01:14:55,712 --> 01:14:57,065
Right, I could've at that.

1090
01:14:57,152 --> 01:15:00,667
- Would $500 refresh your memory?
- My memory's pretty good.

1091
01:15:01,112 --> 01:15:04,149
I remember that you're the guy
who lifted my passport and my money.

1092
01:15:04,232 --> 01:15:07,827
Would your memory become any better if
your passport and money were returned?

1093
01:15:07,912 --> 01:15:10,221
Does that include the $825
Johnson owed me?

1094
01:15:10,352 --> 01:15:12,820
- Why not?
- And the $500 you just mentioned?

1095
01:15:13,312 --> 01:15:15,542
You drive a hard bargain,
<i>Capitaine</i> Morgan.

1096
01:15:15,632 --> 01:15:18,351
That's no bargain.
If these people are so important...

1097
01:15:18,432 --> 01:15:22,220
- they're gonna be pretty hard to find.
- Not for a man of your resourcefulness.

1098
01:15:22,312 --> 01:15:24,621
Think it over and let me hear from you.

1099
01:15:36,192 --> 01:15:38,262
- Did you hear all of that?
- Most of it.

1100
01:15:38,352 --> 01:15:40,024
Bee lips went away pretty mad.

1101
01:15:40,472 --> 01:15:42,747
When he cools off, though,
he's gonna start thinking.

1102
01:15:42,832 --> 01:15:45,107
He thinks now that you will turn them in.

1103
01:15:45,192 --> 01:15:48,389
- Isn't that what you want him to think?
- What will happen then?

1104
01:15:48,472 --> 01:15:50,747
- He hasn't searched this hotel yet, has he?
- Not yet.

1105
01:15:50,832 --> 01:15:51,867
There's your answer.

1106
01:15:51,952 --> 01:15:53,704
He doesn't want them,
but the whole setup.

1107
01:15:53,792 --> 01:15:56,101
- What shall we do?
- It's not we, it's you.

1108
01:15:56,192 --> 01:15:59,264
You can't do anything until that fella
gets strong enough to move.

1109
01:15:59,352 --> 01:16:01,422
Until then, you're probably safe.

1110
01:16:01,592 --> 01:16:03,071
Better get rid of this.

1111
01:16:03,152 --> 01:16:04,904
- Bring us some breakfast.
- Sure.

1112
01:16:04,992 --> 01:16:07,790
- I thought you didn't want any breakfast.
- I didn't then.

1113
01:16:07,872 --> 01:16:10,545
MORGAN: What were you saying?
EDDIE: I've been figuring.

1114
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:14,545
Them guys don't think that I'm wise,
but they was trying to get me drunk.

1115
01:16:15,272 --> 01:16:17,342
They don't know me, do they, Harry?

1116
01:16:20,112 --> 01:16:22,068
I think they're trying
to find out something.

1117
01:16:22,152 --> 01:16:23,187
What do you suppose it is?

1118
01:16:23,272 --> 01:16:25,342
- Don't you know?
- I ain't got no idea.

1119
01:16:25,432 --> 01:16:27,900
That's a good way to leave it.
You got the hiccups.

1120
01:16:27,992 --> 01:16:30,267
Have I, Harry? Yeah, I never noticed.

1121
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:33,025
- You better take a drink of water.
- What, water?

1122
01:16:33,112 --> 01:16:35,831
MORGAN: That's a good idea, Slim.
EDDIE: No, not that.

1123
01:16:35,912 --> 01:16:38,107
- It'll do you good.
- I'll be all right.

1124
01:16:39,712 --> 01:16:41,270
- Eddie.
- Yeah, Harry?

1125
01:16:41,352 --> 01:16:43,582
Keep out of sight
and stay away from the police.

1126
01:16:43,672 --> 01:16:46,584
They won't believe
that story you told a second time.

1127
01:16:46,672 --> 01:16:48,344
What story was that, Harry?

1128
01:16:49,832 --> 01:16:51,151
Keep out of sight.

1129
01:16:57,472 --> 01:16:59,463
[Cricket plays bluesy song]

1130
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:44,271
Seen Eddie around?

1131
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:47,071
No, sir, Mr. Morgan,
I've not seen him all evening.

1132
01:18:47,392 --> 01:18:48,666
Where's Frenchy?

1133
01:19:24,992 --> 01:19:27,984
I'm going to work. Do you like it?

1134
01:19:28,192 --> 01:19:30,467
You won't have to sing much
in that outfit.

1135
01:19:30,552 --> 01:19:33,146
- You know, sometimes you make me...
- That's why I do it.

1136
01:19:33,232 --> 01:19:36,190
- Haven't seen Eddie, have you?
- No, not since noon, why?

1137
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:38,183
He left the boat and hasn't come back.

1138
01:19:38,272 --> 01:19:40,502
- Is there anything wrong?
- I don't know.

1139
01:19:40,952 --> 01:19:43,512
Don't look now,
but over there at the second table...

1140
01:19:43,592 --> 01:19:46,470
there's a guy with a mustache.
I think he's following me.

1141
01:19:46,552 --> 01:19:49,305
Keep an eye on him, will you?
I'm going downstairs.

1142
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:52,102
Stick around awhile, she's going to sing.

1143
01:19:52,192 --> 01:19:54,228
- I'll be right back.
- Give her my love.

1144
01:19:54,312 --> 01:19:56,542
I'd give her my own if she had that on.

1145
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:59,552
Here's the rest of the lyrics, Slim.
How do you feel?

1146
01:19:59,632 --> 01:20:02,385
- I could use a drink, Cricket.
- Sure, come on.

1147
01:20:04,272 --> 01:20:06,866
- What will you have, Slim?
- Scotch and soda.

1148
01:20:07,312 --> 01:20:08,347
CRICKET: Same.

1149
01:20:18,872 --> 01:20:20,988
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Capt. Morgan.

1150
01:20:21,072 --> 01:20:23,745
- How are you feeling?
- Much better. I'm very grateful to you.

1151
01:20:23,832 --> 01:20:26,221
Forget it. Let me have a look at this.

1152
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:30,670
MORGAN: There's no bleeding.
PAUL: No.

1153
01:20:32,192 --> 01:20:33,944
- Does that hurt?
- Very little.

1154
01:20:34,032 --> 01:20:37,183
My only trouble is when I'm eating.
I'm awkward with my left hand.

1155
01:20:37,272 --> 01:20:40,981
We'll see if we can have you shot
in the other arm next time.

1156
01:20:41,072 --> 01:20:42,824
You won't need me anymore.

1157
01:20:44,232 --> 01:20:45,506
Frenchy, I'm pulling out.

1158
01:20:45,592 --> 01:20:46,945
- When?
- Soon as I find Eddie.

1159
01:20:47,032 --> 01:20:48,511
- Is your friend missing?
- Yeah.

1160
01:20:48,592 --> 01:20:49,581
What happened?

1161
01:20:49,672 --> 01:20:51,867
I don't know,
he left the dock and hasn't been back.

1162
01:20:51,952 --> 01:20:54,750
- Usually does what I tell him.
- I'm sorry if anything happened.

1163
01:20:54,832 --> 01:20:57,710
- I won't know until I find him.
- Couldn't you leave him here?

1164
01:20:57,792 --> 01:20:59,544
I don't think Eddie would like that.

1165
01:20:59,632 --> 01:21:01,190
Frenchy, as soon as I'm gone...

1166
01:21:01,272 --> 01:21:03,581
Renard will move in
and turn this place upside down...

1167
01:21:03,672 --> 01:21:06,789
so you better start figuring
how and where you're gonna move him.

1168
01:21:06,872 --> 01:21:10,262
- Wouldn't it be best if we went with you?
- Why do you want to go?

1169
01:21:10,352 --> 01:21:14,027
I'm still trying to get out of the jam
I got into bringing you here.

1170
01:21:14,112 --> 01:21:15,784
Why'd you come here in the first place?

1171
01:21:15,872 --> 01:21:18,670
I know why she came, she told me,
but why did you?

1172
01:21:18,752 --> 01:21:20,549
Have you heard of Pierre Villemars?

1173
01:21:20,632 --> 01:21:24,386
Pierre Villemars? Yeah, I read a headline.
He was quite a guy.

1174
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:26,822
- Vichy got him. He's dead, isn't he?
- No.

1175
01:21:26,912 --> 01:21:29,585
He's on Devil's Island.
They sent me here to get him...

1176
01:21:29,672 --> 01:21:31,503
to bring him back here to Martinique.

1177
01:21:31,592 --> 01:21:34,390
He's a man whom people
who are persecuted and oppressed...

1178
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:36,190
will believe in and follow.

1179
01:21:38,552 --> 01:21:40,861
Just how are you gonna get him away?

1180
01:21:41,792 --> 01:21:44,147
You don't think much of me,
Capt. Morgan.

1181
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:47,542
You're wondering why they've chosen me
for this mission.

1182
01:21:47,632 --> 01:21:48,951
I wonder, too.

1183
01:21:49,352 --> 01:21:51,912
As you know, I'm not a brave man.

1184
01:21:53,672 --> 01:21:56,061
On the contrary, I'm always frightened.

1185
01:21:57,352 --> 01:22:00,071
I wish I could borrow your nature
for a while, Captain.

1186
01:22:00,152 --> 01:22:02,382
<i>When you meet danger,</i>
<i>you never think of anything...</i>

1187
01:22:02,472 --> 01:22:04,508
<i>except how you will circumvent it.</i>

1188
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:08,182
The word failure
does not even exist for you, while I...

1189
01:22:10,352 --> 01:22:13,264
I think always, "Suppose I fail"...

1190
01:22:14,392 --> 01:22:16,064
and then I am frightened.

1191
01:22:16,312 --> 01:22:19,270
Yeah, I can easily see how
it wouldn't take much courage...

1192
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:21,627
to get a notorious patriot
off Devil's Island.

1193
01:22:21,712 --> 01:22:26,069
But just for professional reasons,
I'd like to know how you're gonna do it.

1194
01:22:26,152 --> 01:22:27,710
We will find a way.

1195
01:22:28,032 --> 01:22:30,785
It might fail, and if it does...

1196
01:22:30,992 --> 01:22:34,109
and I am still alive...

1197
01:22:35,192 --> 01:22:38,628
I will try to pass on my information,
my mission, to someone else.

1198
01:22:39,152 --> 01:22:41,586
Perhaps to a better man,
who does not fail.

1199
01:22:41,872 --> 01:22:44,147
Because there is always someone else.

1200
01:22:45,912 --> 01:22:48,107
That is the mistake
the Germans always make...

1201
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:50,148
with people they try to destroy.

1202
01:22:51,192 --> 01:22:53,945
There will be always someone else.

1203
01:22:56,752 --> 01:22:59,266
Originally, we planned
to do everything from here.

1204
01:22:59,352 --> 01:23:02,583
But then, because of my own clumsiness,
it was impossible.

1205
01:23:03,192 --> 01:23:05,660
And that's the reason
we have to go with you.

1206
01:23:05,992 --> 01:23:08,870
I couldn't get you on the dock,
there's a man there watching...

1207
01:23:08,952 --> 01:23:11,022
there's one upstairs, they're everywhere.

- How will you go?

As long as I haven't got you along,
I can at least get on the boat.

There'll be a fog,
and the tide will turn after midnight.

1212
01:23:21,912 --> 01:23:24,187
I can cut loose,
drift out beyond the breakwater...

1213

1214

I'll still have trouble enough,
even without you.

- But, Harry...
- Capt. Morgan is right.

This is not his fight yet.

1217
01:23:35,312 --> 01:23:39,624
Some day I hope it may be,
because we could use him.

You have done enough for us already.

Renard's offer to give us up.

How do you know I won't do it yet?

1221
01:23:50,112 --> 01:23:52,467
There are many things a man will do...

1222
01:23:52,792 --> 01:23:57,104
but betrayal for a price is not one of yours.

1223
01:23:59,912 --> 01:24:01,186
Good luck.

Frenchy, I got a few things
to talk to you about before I blow.

Then I'll be up in a little while, Harry.

- I know.

- What's the matter, Steve?
- I don't know.

1231
01:24:28,512 --> 01:24:30,946
I think the whole thing's gonna blow up,
it's too quiet.

1232
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:33,148
- What will you do?
- We'll leave tonight...

1233

Wait, I want you to know
what you're getting into.

1236
01:24:41,152 --> 01:24:43,143
It'll be rough, I'm broke. If we get out...

1237
01:24:43,232 --> 01:24:45,746
it'll be with a few hundred gallons of gas
and a few francs.

1238
01:24:45,832 --> 01:24:48,062
Just enough to get us

I don't know when you'll get back home.
It could be a long time.

1241
01:24:53,832 --> 01:24:56,426
It could be forever,
or are you afraid of that?

1242
01:24:57,152 --> 01:25:00,588
I'm hard to get, Steve.
All you have to do is ask me.

How long will it take you to pack?

You shouldn't have come, it's too risky.

I told you I can't take you.

So one of you
is gonna take a beating for nothing.

I don't care which one it is.
I'll start with you.

01:33:21,112 --> 01:33:22,511
I don't know.

1353
01:33:22,992 --> 01:33:26,029
Maybe because I like you,
maybe because I don't like them.

1354
01:33:26,112 --> 01:33:28,467
I'm glad you are on our side, Harry.

1355
01:33:28,552 --> 01:33:30,224
No kissing, Frenchy.

1356
01:33:31,032 --> 01:33:34,547
- You'll have to take care of those guys.
- We will give you plenty of time.

1357
01:33:34,632 --> 01:33:37,271
If you let them go,
they'll come back and burn this place.

1358
01:33:37,352 --> 01:33:39,388
Let them, it will be a very small fire.

1359
01:33:39,472 --> 01:33:43,465
When Villemars comes back,
it'll be our turn. We'll start a bigger one.

1360
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,985
Meet you on the boat.

1361
01:33:46,072 --> 01:33:47,630
GUARD 2: One minute, please.

1362
01:33:47,712 --> 01:33:49,748
MORGAN: That's all right, let him through.

1363
01:33:52,952 --> 01:33:55,750
- How are you, Harry? How's everything?
- It's all right now.

1364
01:33:55,832 --> 01:33:58,392
You look glad to see me.
You know a funny thing...

1365
01:33:58,872 --> 01:34:01,306
Don't know what they wanted,
but they wouldn't give me...

1366
01:34:01,392 --> 01:34:04,384
I'll get you one down on the boat.
We're leaving, Eddie.

1367
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,190
MORGAN: Ready, Slim?
SLIM: In a minute.

1368
01:34:06,272 --> 01:34:07,671
<i>Close that, will you?</i>

1369
01:34:07,752 --> 01:34:11,028
- Say, what is this, is she going with us?
- Yeah, it looks like it.

1370
01:34:11,112 --> 01:34:13,182
Harry, you mean... What's she got...

1371
01:34:13,752 --> 01:34:16,903
- Who are you?
- Was you ever bit by a dead bee?

1372
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:19,346
- Was you?
- Yeah.

1373
01:34:19,432 --> 01:34:21,229
You got to be careful of dead bees.

1374
01:34:21,312 --> 01:34:23,223
They can sting you just as bad
as live ones.

1375
01:34:23,312 --> 01:34:25,951
Especially if they was kind of mad
when they got killed.

1376
01:34:26,032 --> 01:34:27,829
I feel like I was talking to myself.

1377
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:30,346
I bet I've been bit 100 times that way.

1378
01:34:31,272 --> 01:34:35,026
- Why don't you bite them back?
- I would. Only I haven't got a stinger.

1379
01:34:36,912 --> 01:34:40,348
I remember you. You're all right.
She can come, it's okay with me.

1380
01:34:40,432 --> 01:34:42,070
I'll have both of you to take care of.

1381
01:34:42,152 --> 01:34:45,110
That's right, Eddie.
You can begin by grabbing these bags.

1382
01:34:45,192 --> 01:34:46,591
Come on, Slim.

Do I have time to say goodbye to Cricket?

1385
01:35:07,072 --> 01:35:08,425
Sure, go ahead.

1386
01:35:16,312 --> 01:35:17,825
- I came to say goodbye.
- What?

1387
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:20,506
We're leaving now. Thanks for everything.

1388
01:35:20,592 --> 01:35:23,823
CRICKET: Hey, Slim. Are you still happy?
SLIM: What do you think?
