00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:52,603
- Well, l'll be home in a minute.
- All right.

454
00:39:52,677 --> 00:39:55,544
So you was working it
tonight, girl.

455
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:59,140
- Yeah, right, slammin'.
- [ Laughs ] Later.

456
00:39:59,217 --> 00:40:01,151
Bye.

457
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:03,312
Come on, Braveheart.

458
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:09,359
Maybe you want to
hook up sometime ?

459
00:40:09,427 --> 00:40:12,863
You know, after school ?
Work on your moves, if you want.

460
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,490
Yeah, sure,
if you want.

461
00:40:15,566 --> 00:40:20,663
So how'd you like Stepps,
once you got used to the music ?

462
00:40:20,738 --> 00:40:23,070
lt wasn't the music that l
had to get used to, Derek.

463
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:25,803
That's not the fiirst time
l've heard hip-hop.

464
00:40:25,877 --> 00:40:30,473
Uh-huh. l bet you listen to it
all the time.

465
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:35,885
So are we getting any closer
to your crib,

466
00:40:35,953 --> 00:40:39,286
or are we going to have to
stop for food and water ?

467
00:40:39,357 --> 00:40:41,848
- We-- We passed it.
- You passed it.

468
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:52,264
- Thankyou for walking me home.
- Was that thanks like,

469
00:40:52,336 --> 00:40:54,634
''Gee whiz, l had a great time,''
or was that thanks like,

470
00:40:54,706 --> 00:40:58,005
''l'll bust a cap in your ass, ifyou
ever darken my doorstep again'' ?

471
00:40:58,076 --> 00:41:02,604
No, l would never
bust a cap in your ass.

472
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:07,032
Oh.
[ Laughs ]

473
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,194
Just checking.

474
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,966
So, uh, you're here.
you're home.

475
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:16,167
l'll see ya.

476
00:41:16,242 --> 00:41:18,039
See ya at school.

477
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:20,579
Okay.

478
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:23,343
See ya.

479
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:25,407
Thank you for the dance.

480
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,104
- [Cough]
- [ Gasps ]

481
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:49,198
- Morning.
- You scared me.

482
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:52,574
l didn't know that you were home.
l didn't see your car outside.

483
00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:54,772
Yeah, the night's
full of surprises.

484
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:58,284
l had a big one myself
when l came home on my break.

485
00:41:58,351 --> 00:42:02,583
- Where were you, Sara ?
- l wasjust out with some friends.

486
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:06,091
And l just missed some work. Half
a night's worth. Hope you had fun.

487
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,559
l did.
l had a great time.

488
00:42:08,628 --> 00:42:11,256
Yeah, look,

489
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:14,994
you're 17 years old,
if you wanna go out, go out.

490
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:17,002
But don't sneak around.

491
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:20,403
And on top of everything else,
don't make me worry about you.

492
00:42:20,473 --> 00:42:22,566
Oh, now you're worried
about me ?

493
00:42:22,642 --> 00:42:25,202
Now that l'm old enough to take care
of myself? Perfect timing, Roy.

494
00:42:25,278 --> 00:42:28,042
You know, the rules about going out
are very simple, Sara.

495
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:31,914
l wanna know where and when. And
l want you home at a decent hour.

496
00:42:31,985 --> 00:42:36,581
- End of discussion.
- Fine, end of discussion. Relax.

497
00:42:41,828 --> 00:42:45,594
All right, lesson one. See, hip-hop
is more than just like a dance,

498
00:42:45,665 --> 00:42:47,633
it's more like--
like an attitude, you know.

499
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,466
You gotta loosen up so you can feel
them and let them flow through you.

500
00:42:54,107 --> 00:42:56,632
Now, what is this ?
Bring your feet out like this.

501
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:59,303
Put your feet forward.
Right, spread 'em, spread 'em.

502
00:42:59,379 --> 00:43:01,643
- You all right, then ?
- Yes.

503
00:43:01,714 --> 00:43:05,480
Just hang loose.
Be strong, a tree, right ?

504
00:43:05,551 --> 00:43:09,783
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right.

505
00:43:16,062 --> 00:43:20,192
- Make that sound with me. Uhhh !
- Uhhh !

506
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:25,367
What, are you sitting down
for tea or something ?

507
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:27,429
Get up.

508
00:43:28,908 --> 00:43:32,469
Boom. That's it.
Just chillin'.

509
00:43:35,548 --> 00:43:37,482
You just do it.
Sit down.

510
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,178
Okay.

511
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:49,152
Now we'rejust going to walk. lt's
real simple.Just walk like this.

512
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:55,631
- Okay, now you try, you try.
- Okay.

513
00:43:55,702 --> 00:43:57,693
Now just relax,
let it be natural.

514
00:44:00,907 --> 00:44:04,502
Five, six, seven, eight.

515
00:44:07,747 --> 00:44:10,477
Dig into it more, the balls of
your feet instead of your toes.

516
00:44:13,853 --> 00:44:17,414
Bend your knees, bend your knees.
Just slouch a little bit, slouch.

517
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,355
Act like you're
a nasty bitch.

518
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,257
All right, now watch.
Check it, check it, check it.

519
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:27,959
- Got that ?
- Oh, it's come to headbobs ?

520
00:44:28,034 --> 00:44:30,264
Okay, it's the same beat,
but then you split it up.

521
00:44:30,336 --> 00:44:34,272
Freeze, freeze, freeze.

522
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,275
- Bounce, bounce.
- l am such a dork.

523
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:39,903
No, you're not.
Bounce.

524
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:43,107
- Now l'm cool.
- You're almost there.

525
00:44:44,584 --> 00:44:46,575
Yeah, you got that.

526
00:44:48,755 --> 00:44:50,689
Areyousure it's okay
that we came here ?

527
00:44:50,757 --> 00:44:53,419
Well, it is now, but ifwe're
going to keep on doing this,

528
00:44:53,493 --> 00:44:55,484
we're gonna have to fiind
someplace else to practice.

529
00:44:59,232 --> 00:45:01,359
Did you always
want to be a doctor ?

530
00:45:01,434 --> 00:45:03,629
Who said l wanna be
a doctor ?

531
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:06,638
Chenille. Everybody.

532
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:10,805
Well, yeah, you know.
l wanna be a doctor,

533
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:13,209
but l gotta
get into college fiirst.

534
00:45:13,279 --> 00:45:16,373
What kind of doctor ?

535
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:18,781
Pediatrician.
l like kids.

536
00:45:20,987 --> 00:45:25,754
- Do you have any ?
- No. Do you ?

537
00:45:25,825 --> 00:45:28,817
Oh, l didn't--
l wasn't trying to be smart, Derek.

538
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:32,330
Wouldn't be the fiirst time.

539
00:45:32,398 --> 00:45:34,889
Screw you,
l'm brilliant and cool.

540
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:38,403
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

541
00:45:46,379 --> 00:45:48,813
Wow.

542
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:05,762
That was cute, that little thing
you did. Can you show me again ?

543
00:46:05,832 --> 00:46:10,235
- What was that shit you just did ?
- Rond dejambe attitude.

544
00:46:10,303 --> 00:46:14,467
- Ballet. l used to dance.
- You used to dance ?

545
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,475
Used to, as in don't anymore and no,
l don't want to talk about it.

546
00:46:17,543 --> 00:46:21,001
So, is that why you brought up that
rond dejambe attitude shit...

547
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,275
because you don't want
to talk about it ?

548
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:25,340
lt's really not
a big deal.

549
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,154
l think it is.

550
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:36,059
This club was so slamming, Lindsay,
the dancing. l'm gonna go again.

551
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:39,223
You are ? Well, have you
seen anybody get shot yet ?

552
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:41,994
What ? No, l didn't see
anyone get shot yet.

553
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:44,002
God, l didn't move to Bosnia.

554
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,004
Well, l'm still going to
pray foryou.

555
00:46:46,072 --> 00:46:49,508
Jesus, Sara, you're in the freaking
ghetto. Forget about the drive-bys,

556
00:46:49,575 --> 00:46:52,408
how are you supposed to
meet anybody ?

557
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:58,212
Um, well, l did actually
meet somebody, l think.

558
00:46:58,284 --> 00:47:00,878
l met this guy,
and he's really cool.

559
00:47:00,953 --> 00:47:05,049
-They got white guys at your school?
-Um...

560
00:47:05,124 --> 00:47:08,150
no, actually they don't.

561
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,255
Shut up ! Look at me.
l want my money.

562
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:15,300
[Girl Crying]
ldon't have it.

563
00:47:15,368 --> 00:47:18,201
[Malakai] Shut up !
Quit your crying, man.

564
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,205
[Girl]
 ldon't get paid till next week.

565
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:22,207
You wasn 't saying that
when you was smoking it.

566
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:24,474
-l don't have it !
-Well, you better find it somewhere.

567
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,304
- This ain't no lay a way plan.
- Hey ! Hey, stop it !

568
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:31,143
Come here. Where do you
think you're going, huh ?

569
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:33,410
Aahh !
Bitch !

570
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:43,152
You ain't seen nothing,
so don't say nothing... to nobody.

571
00:48:01,585 --> 00:48:03,519
[Derek]
 l stole a bike here once.

572
00:48:03,587 --> 00:48:06,112
- Why'd you do that ?
- 'Cause l didn't have one.

573
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:09,887
- Oh, okay. Good reason.
- Well, it's not a reason, you know,

574
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,929
l used to do shit like that,
you know-- wild shit.

575
00:48:12,997 --> 00:48:15,431
- With Malakai ?
- Yeah.

576
00:48:15,499 --> 00:48:17,990
l don't get you two.
You seem so different.

577
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:23,038
- We're not.
- l think you are.

578
00:48:23,107 --> 00:48:25,905
l mean, come on,
Malakai's scary. Very scary.

579
00:48:25,976 --> 00:48:30,413
What you mean by scary ?
Kai's tough, he has to be.

580
00:48:30,481 --> 00:48:35,316
But he's still got
a good heart. l know.

581
00:48:35,386 --> 00:48:37,320
Maybe you only think
you know.

582
00:48:37,388 --> 00:48:40,414
Look, Malakai may not be the boy
next door, but he's still my boy.

583
00:48:40,491 --> 00:48:42,618
He does some shit that l'm not
down with sometimes,

584
00:48:42,693 --> 00:48:47,756
but l ain't never going to cross
him offand be like everybody else.

585
00:48:47,832 --> 00:48:50,892
So, you're not down with the stuff
he does, but you are down with him ?

586
00:48:50,968 --> 00:48:54,563
- That makes sense. l understand.
- He's my friend, Sara.

587
00:48:54,638 --> 00:48:56,318
You don't have to
understand.

588
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:57,250
You don't have to
understand.

589
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:01,415
Listen, me and him got into some
shit awhile back-- some bad shit.

590
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:04,425
Broke into a liquor store
and cracked open the cash register.

591
00:49:04,493 --> 00:49:06,427
Somebody peeped us
and called five-0,

592
00:49:06,495 --> 00:49:08,793
and we barely
made it out of the store.

593
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:12,493
The cops were on our asses. We split
up and ran in different directions.

594
00:49:12,568 --> 00:49:14,502
Now, l must have been going
in the wrong direction,

595
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:16,504
because the cops
were closing in on me.

596
00:49:16,572 --> 00:49:19,837
So, Malakai, he smashed in some
car windows, set off the alarms...

597
00:49:19,909 --> 00:49:22,434
and turned the heat
from me to him.

598
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:25,002
l kept running,
and he got caught.

599
00:49:25,081 --> 00:49:28,141
The DA offered him everything but
