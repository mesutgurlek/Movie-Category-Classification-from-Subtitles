AMY: What up, Shawshank?

163
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,037
Did you get yourself a bitch?

164
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:37,406
Did they spray you with a hose?

165
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,910
(QUIETLY) I did a turn at County.

166

You guys waited up for me?

167
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:44,055
Of course we waited up for you.

168
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,142
They've been here for hours.
It's a real inconvenience, Beca.

169
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:51,813
Beca, I'm glad you're here.

170
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,555
I'm calling an emergency Bella meeting.

No.

First up...
Yes.

173
00:07:57,897 --> 00:08:00,525
Our score sheet revealed that the
Sockappellas almost beat us.

174
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,161
And Fat Amy, you need to do it
exactly how we rehearsed it, okay?

175
00:08:04,237 --> 00:08:05,261
No surprises.

176
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:07,538
We should be taking risks.
It's not enough to be good,

177
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:09,539
we need to put ourselves
out there, be different.

178
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,377
Beca's right. The Trebles never
sing the same song twice.

179
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:14,709
The audience love the
Trebles, they tolerate us.

180

We could change the
face of a cappella if we...

185
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:32,330
Okay, I have the pitch pipe, and I say
that we focus on the set list as planned.

186
00:08:33,366 --> 00:08:35,926
From now on, there will be
no more wasting time with work

187

But Aubrey, this stuff
is pretty cool. I mean...

Yeah, I always thought
her beats were pretty sick.

198

Hey, Becky, listen, spring break, I
want you to take the night shift.

version of this, but yours? It's better.

It's Barden Bellas. I have
the semi-finals tonight.

Really? I did not have you
pegged as an a cappella girl.

207

That's 'cause you don't
know Becky like I do.

00:46:15,626 --> 00:46:18,117
Told you. Endings
are the best part.

788
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:19,321
You're such a weirdo.

789
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:34,840
Listen up, a-ca-ballers.

790
00:46:34,912 --> 00:46:39,406
I have been rejected by the Army, shoved
into a Dora the Explorer backpack,

791
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:42,975
and pushed into the girls' locker
room wearing nothing but suspenders.

792
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:45,954
But no matter.
I am in the world that I love.

793
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:48,357
And with the assistance
of my boy, Justin...

794
00:46:48,425 --> 00:46:49,449
My liege.

795
00:46:49,526 --> 00:46:50,766
I launch this year's auditions.

796
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:54,057
Belly roll.
(DRUMMING)

797
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:59,928
The most recent ICCA national champion
winners get to pick the audition song.

798
00:47:00,003 --> 00:47:01,243
(JUSTIN MIMICS CYMBAL CRASHING)

799
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:03,700
(WHISPERING)

800
00:47:06,543 --> 00:47:09,307
All right, nerds.
Let's go with...

801
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,732
CHLOE: Because I have nodes.

802
00:48:44,808 --> 00:48:49,142
Chloe, don't worry, it's just God
punishing you 'cause you're a ginger.

803
00:48:50,747 --> 00:48:52,112
