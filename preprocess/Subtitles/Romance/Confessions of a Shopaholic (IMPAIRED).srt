00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,419
It's always...
Of course we got the bill.

157
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,757
Listen, I've got to go.
I'm interviewing.

158
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,736
Mm-mm.
Yeah, no, not me... Bye.

159
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,900
Sorry about that.
Right, um, Rebecca...

160
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,771
- Ah! We met!
- Hi! We did. Thank you.

161
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,476
Sick aunt, scarf. Yep.
Did you get it to her?

162
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,781
I did. And when a stranger
is kind like that, it's just...

163
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,947
- Wow.
- That's lovely. Um...

164
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,524
- Do you have a resume for me?
- I do. Yes, I do!

165
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,466
Ah... [grunting]

166
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,502
I... could pretty much just tell you.

167
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,301
My name is Rebecca Bloomwood,

168
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,103
I've been a journalist for five years.

169
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,168
I'm very comfortable juggling numbers,

170
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,510
I speak fluent Finnish, I know...

171
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,380
- Finnish?
- Yes, Finnish.

172
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,851
- I'm also...
- That's interesting. Why Finnish?

173
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,478
What's behind you?

174
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,648
- Um...
- [panting] Oh, my God.

175
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,215
Oh, it's a naked man. Oh, sorry.

176
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,092
It gave me such a fright. I, uh...

177
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,962
I didn't know what it was.
Clearly, he's beheaded.

178
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,966
Who would do that to him?

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,865
[clears throat] Well, a few questions.

180
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,029
But, look! Makes you wonder

181
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,335
what they're looking at
on the fifth floor, right?

182
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,934
You could turn your desk around
and just stare at it all day.

183
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:21,344
I would. [laughing]

184
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,712
- Not.
- Ms. Bloomwood.

185
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,683
I'm not a pervert.

186
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,879
Sit down.

187
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,650
I'm sorry, I'm terrible at interviews.

188
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,853
Any financial stories that have
caught your eye recently?

189
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,987
Yes. And I am glad
that you brought that up.

190
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,829
Because I am furious.
No, I really am.

191
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,825
No, I mean, what is the story
with the recent fish crisis?

192
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,201
Fish crisis?

193
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,366
- Fiscal... crisis.
- Fiscal crisis.

194
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:52,775
- Terrifying. Fiscally, I mean.
- How so?

195
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,042
- For the fiscal family.
- I'm sorry.

196
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,847
- Not a moment too soon.
- Ms. Bloomwood, you dropped your scarf.

197
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,896
She died.

198
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:19,394
Oh, Ms. Bloomwood, you have had
a very, very tough 25 minutes.

199
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:23,306
I'm glad you understand!
So many people just... Right.

200
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:27,301
OK, so I would propose we curtail...

201
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,813
Did you just scrub my name off?

202
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,146
- Oh, no. Routine.
- That seems premature.

203
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,983
OK, I'm gonna propose that
we curtail this interview forthwith.

204
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,318
So I'll leave you and your numbers,

205
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,348
but thank you very much for seeing me,

206
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,984
and I appreciate... Oh!

207
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:46,760
[groaning] I appreciate everything.
Good day.

208
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,930
Good day.

209
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,642
Come on. Let's go give
Mrs. Great Outdoors her tent.

210
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,113
[sobbing] She's not retiring.

211
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,483
- What?
- She's abandoning a sinking ship.

212
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,422
That little rat! The magazine's
folding and she knew!

213
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,051
She knew and she didn't tell anybody.

214
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,988
Well, on the bright side,
you hated working for that magazine.

215
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,364
[sighing] It was my income, Suze.
I need my income!

216
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,495
OK, Bex, the most important thing
is not to panic.

217
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,870
[phone ringing]

218
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,967
- [Suze] Don't answer the phone!
- [both] No!

219
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,739
- It might be a debt collector!
- Hello?

220
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,178
- It's Derek Smeath.
- The list. Get the list!

221
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,580
- I think I saw it over here.
- Take the lamp!

222
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,652
- It's here!
- Bloomingdale's...

223
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,120
- Hospital for depression.
- Detained in Finland on work.

224
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,645
Visa, dead dog.

225
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,625
All City Debt Collection.
You have to do it.

226
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,787
- Hello! Hi!
- <i>[Derek] Ms. Bloomwood?</i>

227
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,627
- <i>Hello.</i>
- I'm sorry. It's actually not.

228
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:57,068
She's still recovering from...
You know... OK.

229
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,263
I'll have her call you as soon as...

230
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,671
- <i>Yes?</i>
- As soon as she's come back

231
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,039
- from... From...
- Finland! Finland!

232
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,271
- <i>Clearly she's not too...</i>
- Aah!

233
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,337
[phone clatters]

234
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:16,148
Why do so many of your excuses
involve Finland?

235
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,089
'Cause no one checks up
on Finland, Tarkie.

236
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,992
How am I going to pay you the rent now?

237
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,190
Well, I'm ripping up your rent check!

238
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,632
No, Suze, you can't do it again.

239
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,999
It's my apartment,
well, my parent's apartment,

240
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,062
- but it's my rules.
- I'm gonna buy you the biggest present.

241
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:37,633
I am! I know where I'm going to go.
There's a sale at Macy's!

242
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,541
Tarkie...

243
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,836
I'll be at my place.

244
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:46,580
Thanks, baby. Bex, I'll get
the tequila, you get the bills.

245
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,225
I'll do this. It can't be that bad.

246
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,194
It's just like a Band-Aid.
It's gonna be fine.

247
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,023
[both gasping loudly]

248
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:03,125
Bex! Two hundred dollars
on Marc Jacobs underwear?

249
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:06,262
Oh, underwear is a basic human right.

250
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,865
Seventy-eight dollars
on lavender honey!

251
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,706
I felt sorry for the shop assistant.
She had a lazy eye.

252
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,703
I didn't know which way
she was looking. It was so sad.

253
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,807
I can't even talk about this one.

254
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,047
A foot spa? What were you
doing at a foot spa?

255
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,111
Let's take a break.

256
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,352
They said I was a valued customer.

257
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,156
Now they send me hate mail.

258
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,628
- [adding machine rattling]
- [Suze] Bex.

259
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,154
Oh, God...

260
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,260
How are you going to pay off
sixteen thousand twelve hundred

261
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:43,367
and 62 dollars
and 70 cents with no job?

262
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,339
I could win the lottery.

263
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,639
Maybe you should have a backup plan.

264
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:56,518
Oh! Backup plan, I got it, I got it.
Backup plan.

265
00:15:56,555 --> 00:16:00,457
OK. When Tarkie
thought of his dream job,

266
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:05,156
he, um, wrote this proposal
just about him, you know,

267
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,132
what he's made of
and that's what you can do.

268
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,965
You can write a fashion piece
and send it to <i>Alette.</i>

269
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,698
Like, "Hey, <i>Alette,</i> look what I can do!"

270
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,366
You just gotta figure out
what to write about.

271
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,773
"Consider your shoe an investment.

272
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,074
Everything is resting upon it.

273
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,876
The most important point
is that every shoe

274
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,678
should earn its place in your..."

275
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,379
Bex, this is so funny. You're so smart.

276
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,683
- You're the best writer ever!
- Do you like it?

277
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,986
- You're fabulous!
- Wait! Another one.

278
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,619
To that guy at that savings thingy
magazine who didn't hire me.

279
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,526

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,878
This is for <i>Alette</i> magazine.

287
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,014
Please, please. Kiss it for good luck.

288
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,424
- Mwah!
- And this one...

289
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,951
...is for Mr. Successful Saving.

290
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,558
Bleah... Money, money, money.

291
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,931
I better get the job, I've got no money.

292
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,203
[sobbing] I've got no money.

Doesn't this just cheer you up?

295
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:34,217
- It's not working, Mom.
- Come on, you'll get another job.

296
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,689
Life is like a swap meet.
You never know

297
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,487
when great riches...

298
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,360
...are going to turn up unexpectedly.

299
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,622
What can I get for a quarter?

300
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,429
This!

301
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,026

309
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,452
And I have to say
it was a bit of a surprise.

310
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:18,293
Well, I hope I made my point.

311
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,128
Oh, you did. You did. Very well.

312
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,100
The whole metaphor. Very clever.

313
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,468
Yes, wasn't it.
The whole metaphor was...

314
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,633
Wait... What? I'm sorry...

315
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,109
Describing the principles
of security investment

316
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,307
in terms of the way different women
purchase different shoes

317
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,145
was... different.

318
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:43,018
Hello? Sounds like you might be
in the middle of something.

319
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,081
I was trying to say
that it gave me an idea.

320
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,424
[clears throat] Would you like
to come in? I don't...

321
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,088
Can I help you, dear?

322
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,031
I think I just sent the editor
of <i>Alette</i> magazine $20

323
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,331
to buy herself decent clothes
and stick her job up her ass.

324
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,505
[elevator bell dings]

325

- [gasps]
- [indistinct chattering]

327
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,752
- These go...
- [elevator bell dings]

328
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,134
- Hey, clothes for Alette.
- [woman] I'll call her assistant.

329
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,839
Hi. Clothes are here
for Alette's approval.

330
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,574
She'll be right out.

331
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:46,710
What do you think about you and me
going out on Friday night?

332
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,242
- Ooh...
- I mean, if you want to.

333
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,414
Would you like to go out
on Friday night?

334
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,253
I don't know. I might have plans.

335
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,227
You might... Do you
ever wear any of this stuff?

336
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,855
Some of it's a little far out for me.

337
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,524
- Totally far out.
- Yeah.

338
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:04,332
It's crazy, but I guess that's
the world of high fashion?

339
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,337
- [chuckles] Yes.
- Yeah, I know about that.

340
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,431
I am one of the best. I don't
let this out of my sight.

341
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,772
I guard it with my life.

342
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,608
A lot of pressure on me

343
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,376
to make sure everyone
gets these letters...

344
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,680
- Get them there on time.
- Got to get my job done.

345
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,278
See, I take my job very seriously.

346
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,983
- Yes. And to deliver...
- Oh, really?

347
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,515
And to deliver the mail,
but as the mail carrier

348
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,529
it's a lot of pressure on me
to get people their letters,

349
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,190
I've never lost a letter yet.

350
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,700
[French accent] I want
no more vertical buttonholes.

351
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,395
I'm so bored with vertical buttonholes.

352
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,269
Is this for the <i>Kaleidoscope</i> shoot
with Paolo?

353
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:46,210
[speaking French]
Oh, but this!

354
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,841
[gasps] Cavalli.
He has read my mind.

355
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,316
It's marvelous. We can use it all.

356
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,445
Take it in.

357
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,926
[Alicia gasps] Oh, God.
What are you doing?

358
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:07,329
This is <i>Alette.</i>
Is this where you should be?

359
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,101
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

360
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:22,512
Dantay-West didn't hire me to be
an editor of this magazine.

361
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:27,177
They hired me to throw it a rope
and pull it out of the swamp.

362
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,948
- [knocking on glass]
- And that's...

363
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,319
Hi, everyone.
I'm Rebecca Bloomwood.

364
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,983
Sit down, Rebecca.

365
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:41,124
What makes a magazine
move from the newsstands?

366
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,600
[chair squeaking]

367
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,196
Real, unvarnished stories,

368
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,640
whether the people that we are
writing about like them or not.

369
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:54,339
<i>Successful Saving</i> is currently
the <i>People</i> magazine

370
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:58,645
of financial journalism,
and this is where that ends.

371
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,244
- From now...
- [pencil sharpener grinding]

372
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,217
Sorry.

373
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:15,056
From now on
we don't copy, we examine.

374
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,331
- We probe.
- Ooh!

375
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,137
I liked your piece.
I said that on the phone.

376
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,370
- Good. Good.
- Hayley!

377
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,139
What do you say a three-week trial.

378
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,875
- And give her this cubicle.
- Oh, this one's lovely.

379
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,815
They're all three by six.

380
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,410
You can start with a thousand words
on the effect of changing

381
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,318
interest rate on store card APRs.

382
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,289
Good.

383
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,566
[whispers] You still have the label
on your new glasses.

384
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,904
What? Oh.

385
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,533
You took a job
at a savings magazine? You?

386
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,009
I know it sounds bad,
but it is, in fact,

387
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,103
part of a very structured plan.

388
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,205
Yeah, that's great,
but then in a lot of ways

389
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,239
it's kinda not great.
What do they call it

390
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:08,150
when an animal rights person
gets trampled to death by a cow?

391
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,086
I don't think there is a word for that.

392
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,647
"Ironic." Ironic
that Rebecca Bloomwood

393
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,852
is advising people
on how to handle money.

394
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,925
But I guess it would be nice

395
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,431
if my maid of honor
could afford her own dress.

396
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,332
- He asked?
- Yes!

397
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,859
Oh, my God!
You should've been there.

398
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,462
- How did he say it?
- [man] Hey!

399
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:31,135
The, uh, credit limit
on your card was reached.

400
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:37,638
You know, I think I want my husband-
to-be to propose to me in Barneys.

401
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:41,413
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

402

- [girl] Yes, you are.
- I just found the perfect book for you.

426
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,058
A thousand words
on store card APRs?

427
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,732
Which looks as if it's been copied
straight out of <i>Money for Dummies.</i>

428
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:14,041
No, I wanted a thousand words
on APRs from an angle.

429
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,273
Is that not an angle?

430
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,543
Not unless you call "head-on" an angle.

431
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,879
- No, I don't.
- Try it again.

Yes. I Googled.

Yes. Absolutely.

both of APL and of the Dutch
fiber-optic company, Zandak.

448
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,982

is a situation in which someone

needs to be asking
some very hard questions.

450

- Absolutely.

00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:36,790
- What? No!
- Put your hand up.

452
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,489
I don't have hard-hitting questions.

- I'm gonna take notes.

00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,581
It's a magazine.

462
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,820
We'll be taking questions
after the report.

463
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,690
Good. Uh...

464
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,128
- Ask him how much he earns.
- How much do you burn?

465
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,596
- Earn.
- Earn.

466
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,122
- Excuse me?
- Louder.

467
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,259
What do you earn?

468
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,897
- We'll take questions after.
- Why award themselves bonuses...

469
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,668
Why did you award
yourself bonuses...

470
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,504
...twenty-four million...
...of 23...

471
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,272
- Twenty-four. Million.
...billion...

472
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,974
- Million dollars...
...while investors lost eight percent?

473
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:33,678
...while your investors
lost eight percent?

474
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,913
[gasps, indistinct chattering]

475
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,656
As I said, I'll be happy
to answer questions...

476
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,557
Is that true?

477
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:50,026
A long pause and no answer.

478
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,629
- Long pause, no answer.
- No, no...

479
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,965
OK. You know why we did that?

480
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,976
Some kind of cruel initiation rite?

481
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,705
Listen to this.

482
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:04,374
"Security can mean different
things to different people.

483
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,613
For some, it's going to a party
wearing the right shoes.

484
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,212
This might leave you feeling
secure for an evening,

485
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,190
but have a crippling effect
on you in later life."

486
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,317
- I wrote that.
- You wrote that.

487
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,692
Now, what firms like Comintex

488
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:21,096
thrive on is an endemic lack
of public understanding.

489
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,929
They get away with murder because...

490
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:27,404
Maisie with a root beer and a $200
investment portfolio,

491
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,463
what does she know?

492
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,498
What does she actually know
about what those guys are doing?

493
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,670
What she's told.

494
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,010
And if the magazines
she looks to for answers

495
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,810
aren't asking the right questions,

496
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,840
it isn't good for Maisie.

497
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,583
I want you to tell the truth in a way
that Maisie can understand.

498
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,853
Now, go home,
write me an initial outline

499
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,727
and e-mail it to me by 3:00. OK?

500
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,145
Oh, no.

501
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,248
Oh, yeah. Nice!

502
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,747
You know, I just got a call
from Jeff Kanter at Comintex.

503
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,317
They're having
their stockholders' meeting.

504
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,829
- Yes, I sent someone.
- Yeah, you did.

505
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,627
A real find, actually, the girl I sent.

506
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,156
She's sparky, honest.

507
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,965
Exactly the type
that I was hoping to find.

508
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:37,441
I assume that's why Edgar West
got you to recruit me.

509
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,136
- Damn it!
- Ooh. Slice.

510
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:42,374
I hired you to fix the bottom line
of this magazine,

511
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,871
and we know the key to that
is advertising revenue.

512
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,152
Now, you hired me
to create a product that sells,

513
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:54,090
- not to sell a product.
- What if I'm with Edgar West.

514
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,526
We're playing golf, and he just turns
to me, sort of nonchalantly, and says,

515
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,292
"Hey, I'd like to know why
Luke Brandon decided to hire

516
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:03,630
a journalist who could damage the
commercial interests of Dantay-West."

517
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:07,764
- What do you think about that?
- I haven't, because she won't.

Ever since the relationship ended.

He's been following me around
pretending to be a debt collector.

616

...by a dog.

618
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:13,670
OK. Look, take the rest of the day

Oh, God. Dad?

Money... is what I came

Hey, honey?

- Coming. [humming]

were gonna call you over here today

630

to talk about pretty much
the exact same thing. Money.

- Our money. Our life savings.

Really?

we've been the kind of people

that we just don't spend, we save.

635

We've built up quite a little nest egg.

636

- Of money.
- A big nest egg of money.

637
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,026
- Of dough.
- Yeah, we do.

638
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,729
[man] And so, we decided...

639
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,760
[woman] That we wanted to
call you here,

640

Yes, she had electrolysis.

It's an article about...

Absolutely. What's the APA Conference?

The biggest magazine
event of the year.

In Miami.

Oh, Luke. I think I should
definitely be there.

Early, I mean,
and you know, make sure that

the hotel's OK and find
good restaurants in case

Not that I intend to,

Yeah, I mean because a lot of people

It's the most relevant thing
in the world.

A well-researched, supported article.

Absolutely. Were you thinking
maybe a suit or a jacket?

I'm actually thinking about everything.

Oh, well, we can do everything.

Pink. Oh, my gosh,

- He'd do that.
- [clears throat] Actually!

I don't want to be defined
by clothes or labels or family.

841

Why would you be defined by family?

842
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:21,965
My mother is Elinor Sherman,
New York socialite.

843
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:25,532
Excuse me, did you just say that
your mother is Elinor Sherman?

844
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:28,067
Did she tell you that we dressed her
for the Met gala?

845
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,079
Oh, she just looked stunning.

846
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:33,981
Well, congratulations on having
such a fabulous mother.

847

My, uh, parents are divorced.

848
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:40,250
I grew up in England with my dad.

Very down-to-earth,
totally different from my mother.

851
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:51,099
Anyway, she wasn't interested
until I was an adult.

that I'd just fall into line.

Uh, no, for the, um...
for the family business.

What's the business?

00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,918
Owning stuff. Real estate, um,

- Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry.

- You're a workaholic.

You put in all these hours,

I am home.

- What'd you tell him?

929
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:36,102
OK. I told him that your
Aunt Ermintrude died of malaria.

930

She died in a skydiving accident.

Her parachute didn't open.

How am I supposed to know?
She doesn't even exist!

Bex, no! Absolutely not.

You've 10,000 dresses already.

What? You exaggerate.

940

I know the dress. It's perfect.
You got it at the thing.

Where is it?

I hope we didn't throw it away
at the de-cluttering.

943

Oh, Bex. Imagine you wearing this dress.

Would you be jealous?

Oh, my gosh,
I forgot I even had this dress.

And Fluke would love you in that dress.

948

Don't talk about Fluke.

949

Why? What happened?

950

Alicia Bitch Longlegs is what happened.

951
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:27,922
I hate her. Who is she?

952

She's the girl with

Well, well, Luke is a raging moron.

You're gonna be a total hottie.

Thank you. I'm the wife
of a textile importer.

My husband found my secret stash
in the linen closet.

Yeah, he found all of my cruisewear,

Um, I cracked at Cartier today.

01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:13,459
Do you know how short-staffed we are?

1076
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,836
- I need food on tables now. Go!
- No, no, no. I need to get...

1077
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:20,502
- Six more, please!
- Oh! I'm not a waitress.

1078
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:23,444
I know you're not, honey.
You're an actress. I get it.

1079
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:25,811
I do. Now go, go,
go, go, go!

1080
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,323
What are you doing?
Go out there and serve the fish!

1081
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,021
- Oh! [screams]
- You! Serve this table. Do it.

1082
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:45,694
- Ms. Bloomwood.
- Yes.

1083
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:48,761
- I'll have the trout, please.
- I'll have the salmon.

1084
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:51,103
- Do you have low-fat dressing?
- I'm not a waitress.

1085
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,835
- Ms. Bloomwood!
- OK. Salmon here.

1086
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,934
- This is the famous Ms. Bloomwood?
- The waitress?

1087
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:57,844
Ms. Bloomwood!
Just put it down and sit!

1088
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,347
Sit. Oh!

1089
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,112
[shouting]

1090
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:06,281
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. Sorry. Oh!

1091
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:07,789
- Sit down, Rebecca.
- Jacket!

1092
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:12,591
Right, uh, ladies and gentlemen,
tonight we will be serving...

1093
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:16,564
...the, uh, brook trout
and wild smoked salmon.

1094
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:19,591
Mrs. West, you'll be pleased
to hear that the fish from this region

1095
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:21,569
is a particularly powerful aphrodisiac.

1096
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:23,094
- Oh.
- Mmm. Give her two.

1097
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:26,199
Oh, Mr. Brandon, you serve
as if you've served all your life.

1098
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,540
Oh, paid my way
through college waiting tables.

1099
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,671
Coincidentally,
that fish weighs the same

1100
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:33,705
- as the girl on your last cover.
- Ooh!

1101
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,446
Oh, Alicia, remind me.
Were you a salmon or a trout?

1102
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:37,612
You were a trout.

1103
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:53,192
Oh... Thanks for saving me in there.

1104
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,065
So have you filled
your photo frames yet?

1105
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,840
No. Not yet.

1106
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:07,948
You could put a picture
of Alicia in one.

1107
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,253
Except there probably
wouldn't be room

1108
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,313
for her spidery long legs.

1109
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:17,383
You know, I've always felt that

1110
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:21,726
spidery long legs were vastly overrated.

1111
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:26,362
I thought she was your girlfriend.

1112
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:31,905
No. She's not my girlfriend.

1113
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:37,443
She's not you.

1114
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,293
Erica, you get her on the phone,

1115
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,699
you pretend she's your
best friend in the world.

1116
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:02,329
You find out how she got
in this terrible situation.

1117
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,134
How did she get so far behind?

1118
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,971
Then you take that information
and you use it against her.

1119
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,738
What are her motivators? Pride?

1120
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,575
Integrity? Honor? Fear?

1121
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:13,411
Tell her she'll lose everything.
Slap a lien on her house.

1122
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,246
Tell her we'll print it in the papers.

1123
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:17,149
Gotta take her
to the edge of the cliff.

1124
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:20,212
Let her think you're gonna push
her over and at the last minute,

1125
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:22,554
pull her back and get
what you want out of her.

1126
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:25,652
That, Erica, is how you earn
a commission.

1127
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,440
Lesson over.
I need <i>Successful Saving.</i>

[gasps] So exciting
at <i>Successful Saving.</i>

1152
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,181
I've had enough of this clown.
I'll see him.

1153
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:02,048
Whoa! Luke! No!
I never want you to meet him, ever.

1154
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,211
Don't worry.
I've already called security.

1155

See? She called security.

No. No, no, no, no.

This is outrageous!
I have every right to be here.

So after the ball, I, myself, actually

1160
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,928
read <i>Successful Saving.</i>
Your piece was very good.

1161
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,160
I have been observing you

1162
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,430
and it seems you have
natural street fashion,

1163
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:24,132
but... do you have genuine style?

1164
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:32,039
Dressing is like any
worthwhile endeavor.

1165
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:35,539
It is an art, but also a challenge.

1166

1167

This dress is good for you, huh?

1168
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:46,022
With maybe... this jacket over.

Oh, that's genius, Alette. <i>Parfait.</i>

1170
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:53,902
I think that is a great dress,
um, but I was thinking...

1171
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:55,403
...a little more...

1172
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:58,464
...of something... like this?

1173
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:06,914
I mean, I'd pair it with
a new Yves Saint Laurent coat.

Take her bag.

1177
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,725
You are sure of your choice?

You're willing to give away
your money for things

1221
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:10,126
that you don't need,
so why not try giving away

the things you don't need
for no money.

But here's the thing:
I really need those things.

I'll show you who really needs them.

01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:22,208
- Oh, my. Colorful.
- This is my bridesmaid's dress.

1227
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:26,078
Please! How many of us
have used that one before, hmm?

1228
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:32,678
OK. I just want you to take
these clothes and... do good.

1229
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:38,387
Ms. Bloomwood,
wasn't that liberating? Bravo!

1230

[all cheering]

1231
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:45,361
My will is strong. My wallet is closed.
I don't want to shop!

1232
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:47,665
Back to the basement.
I couldn't be prouder.

1233
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:52,173
There's been a mistake.
The dresses I gave in?

1234
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:54,437
- Hmm. I need it back.
- I see. Mm-hmm. Christy!

1235
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:55,943
Yes?

1236
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,742
Can't sell those two dresses.
There's been a mistake.

1237
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:01,648
- No returns.
- I really need these dresses!

1238
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,481
I'd bring back something tomorrow.

1239
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,714
- Something better.
- No exchanges.

1240
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:10,589
- OK, so, um, I'll buy 'em.
- You will? Oh, that's great.

1241
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:12,389
Oh, really.
We need every cent here.

1242
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:15,659
- OK. How much?
- A hundred and ten.

1243
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:18,064
What? How is this a charity store?

1244
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,795
This is from Barneys.

1245
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:24,238
I know. OK,
I don't have enough for both.

1246
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:27,640
- This one's twenty.
- Maybe come back for this one?

1247
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,543
Which is more important?

1248

1250
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:39,251
- This is her?
- Yeah.

<i>The Girl in the Green Scarf,</i>
<i>Rebecca Bloomwood,</i>

How are her accessories?

1253

Right. Which is exactly the point.

1260
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:08,414
Because so much
financial journalism is really...

1261

- Is really boring.
- I'm with ya on that!

But it's ordinary people that have

<i>[Rebecca] It's the difference</i>
<i>between cost and worth.</i>

1272
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,674
Essentially, something
you can't see, can't touch,

1273
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:43,947
but it's actually the most

But we just have a little bit more time.

Yes, you, sir.

OK. Mortgage debt, car debt?

1284
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:19,945
- Ms. Bloomwood's debt.
- [laughs] Ms. Bloomwood's debt.

1285
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:21,455
That's right.

No, I'm sorry,

Really?

1296
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,915
No wonder she didn't bring him home.

OK, well, uh, my ex-girlfriend

1300
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:13,939

because I might risk
contamination with an infection

- Oh!

No, you're right, I don't!

So do what I hired you to do, Rebecca,

1323
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:18,299
and make the truth clear

1324

doesn't understand.

Well, you're not giving me time...

For what?
To make something up?

1331

Just, for once in your life,
tell me the truth.

But it would seem on

But what she wrote in her columns
was the truth.

She had a voice.

She spoke to people
who never believed

that they could understand,
and who loved it when

there's really only ever one solution.

Maybe we should
start a new magazine.

A magazine driven purely

that sign above the door,

01:30:55,683 --> 01:30:57,310
An icon.

1532
01:30:58,686 --> 01:31:02,679
Supple, sensual,
the color of money.

1533
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:04,714
Rebecca always had such fabulous taste.

1534
01:31:04,759 --> 01:31:06,886
No wonder she wound up
at <i>Alette</i> magazine.

1535
01:31:06,928 --> 01:31:09,158
Oh, Becky didn't end up
at <i>Alette</i> magazine.

1536
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:11,165
She turned that "hoppertunity" down.

1537
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:13,394
- What? Why?
- Yes, Jane Bloomwood, hi.

1538
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:14,594
Oh, hi.

1539
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:19,436
Now who will be the next
Girl in the Green Scarf?

1540
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:22,875
- Fifty dollars!
- Anyone else?

1541
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:24,400
- Seventy.
- [Korch] I have 70!

1542
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:27,676
- Ninety dollars.
- [Korch] Ninety dollars right here!

1543
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:29,808
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

1544
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:32,684
I have a bidder on the phone.
One hundred and twenty dollars.

1545
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:35,154
One-twenty for the beautiful,
famous, elegant...

1546
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:36,850
- [woman] One-fifty!
- Don't sell it.

1547
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:38,688
You've sold so much already.

1548
01:31:38,726 --> 01:31:42,560
- Two hundred dollars.
- Two hundred and fifty dollars.

1549
01:31:42,597 --> 01:31:43,825
[all gasp]

1550
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:48,598
Two-fifty! I have 250.
The bid is against you at 250.

1551
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,405
- Well?
- Three hundred dollars!

1552
01:31:54,308 --> 01:31:57,903
You can tell your friend on the phone,
I'll match anything they bid.

1553
01:31:58,613 --> 01:32:00,581
She's like an assassin.

1554
01:32:00,615 --> 01:32:03,106
Three hundred dollars. Going once.

1555
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:10,350
- Going twice.
- My bidder withdraws.

1556
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:13,690
Sold for 300 to the lady in pink.

1557
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:19,296
- [Rebecca] Wait!
- [all gasping]

1558
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:23,129
Uh...

1559
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:39,909
- Don't wear it with yellow.
- Never.

1560
01:32:39,954 --> 01:32:43,720
- It could bring you love.
- Thank you.

1561
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:53,924
[cheering]

1562
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:04,643
One, two, three, four.
That's another thousand.

1563
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:07,204
Wow.

1564
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:11,116
$16,586, 72 cents.

1565
01:33:11,152 --> 01:33:14,349
- You are a winner, babe!
- [all screaming]

1566
01:33:14,388 --> 01:33:16,618
Oh, my God.

1567
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:43,410
- [screams]
- Mr. Smeath.

1568
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:47,148
What the hell is this?
What are you doing?

1569
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:50,680
I'm doing exactly what you did to me
on that television show, Derek.

1570
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:52,989
I'm just giving you what you deserve.

1571
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:56,019
But in the most
inconvenient way possible.

1572
01:33:56,063 --> 01:34:02,024
And that, I think, makes 9,412.

1573
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:05,200
Oh. And a quarter.

1574
01:34:10,378 --> 01:34:12,573
[indistinct chattering]

1575
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:25,892
[Rebecca] I've got it. I've got it.

1576
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:32,663
[woman] OK. Ladies, it's time!

1577
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:39,767
- How'd you get it back?
- I did a deal.

1578
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:54,453
Get her some flowers.

1579
01:34:57,324 --> 01:35:00,885
- Sorry. OK.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1580
01:35:06,967 --> 01:35:08,457
- Ready, sweetie?
- Bex!

1581
01:35:09,136 --> 01:35:10,694
Come here.

1582
01:35:18,145 --> 01:35:20,045
OK.

See you at the reception!

1585
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:39,249
You sold all your clothes and kept that?

1586
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:53,131
- It's Suze's wedding...
- Wedding. I know.

I'm an investigative
journalist, Rebecca.

1588
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:58,068
Give me some credit.

1589
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:11,440
You really sold it all?

1590
01:38:14,154 --> 01:38:15,849
You have nothing left.

1591
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:18,950
I mean, I wouldn't put it like that.

1592

[gasps]

1593
01:38:27,134 --> 01:38:28,431
Neither would I.

1594
01:38:30,037 --> 01:38:32,164
The bidder on the phone was you.

1595
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:35,842
But you lost!

1596
01:38:39,113 --> 01:38:41,138
Both bidders were me.

1597
01:38:43,984 --> 01:38:46,782
