Past the archway, on the right,

Michel.

318
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,574
Yeah, like
Michael-Angelo, the painter,

319
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,122
only, with him,
for some reason, it's Michel.

320

My friend, Monica, she called.

355
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,610
She's going to be in Rome,

356
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,532
and I told her
she could stay with us.

357
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,986
- Ah. Well, so I'll finally
get to meet her.

358
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,945
- She just broke up
with her boyfriend,

359
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,747
so she's a bit at loose ends.

- Trouble.
Trouble in River City.

- What, trouble?
Why trouble?

362
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,789
- You're just going
to love her.

363
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,588
She's smart and funny

364
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,587
and interesting.

365
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,464
Men just adore her.

366
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,090
I think it's because
of the sexual vibe

367
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,797
that she gives off.
Mmm-hmm.

is she coming for?

the situation
is fraught with peril?

00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,521
- What? Give me a break.

I'm not looking for anything.

I'm perfectly happy
with Sally, and...

377
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,689
Actually, judging
from Sally's description,

378
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,821
Monica's kind of like a neurotic,
unpredictable type.

379
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,994
- Beautiful, funny,
smart, sexual

They'll think my wife is out of the hotel
so I hired a call girl.

Why did you grab me like that?

We have to get out of here now.

447
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,490
You have to pretend to be my wife.

448
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,498
- Pretend to be your wife?
I'm not an actress.

449
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,830
And you just called me an idiot.

450
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:52,122
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
You must help me. And hurry.

451
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,963
If Milly walks in I will jump
out of the window, I will kill myself.

452
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,924
- Sooner or later they'll find out.

453
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:03,512
- I need to buy more time, so I can
think of something, some way out.

We need to get out of here now.

Can you walk faster?

- I'm walking fine.
Relax.

- Her flight should
have landed.

Relax. By the time she goes through
customs and luggage,

459
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,810
we'll have been
waiting an hour.

460
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,612
- I hope that you don't
fall in love with her.

461
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,607
- In love with her?
What the hell does that mean?

462
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,491
- Well, men always,
they just go crazy for her.

463
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,911
- Well, I'm crazy for you.

464
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,533
Okay, that's her.

It's so good to see you.

00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,466
- No, no, nothing
special at all.

471
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,547
I got no buzz.

472
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,633
I mean, look at her.
This is the hot femme fatale?

473
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,185
- Of course, she has been
flying for 14 hours.

474
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,890
But you will admit
there is something about her.

475
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,770
- All I can say is,
if something is clicking,

476
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,068
it's so subconscious,
I'm totally unaware.

477
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,896
She's no big deal. Certainly not some
formidable heartbreaker.

478
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,448
She's a disheveled,
out-of-work actress.

479
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,946
- I've been wanting you to come for so
long, and now you're here. I just...

480
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,494
- Hi. Hi. I'm Jack.

481
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,695
- This is Monica.

482
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,031
- Hi. It's so nice to meet you.
- I'm sorry.

483
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,740
- I mean, I must look awful.

484
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,621
- What do you mean? - I mean, please
don't make any snap judgments.

485
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,794
- No, you look fine.
- Like, I grown on people.

486
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,792
I just... I can never
sleep on planes.

487
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,631
I had a scotch
and three Ambien, but still...

488
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,465
- Pretty cozy,
this ride into town.

489
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,963
- I keep telling you, I have no interest
in Monica.

490
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,298
I just hope having her around

491
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,803
is not going to
interfere with my work.

492
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,850
- But there is an element
of excitement...

493
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,975
A germ, a spark, one molecule.

494
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,897
God.

495
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,726
I see it so clearly,
now that I'm older.

496
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,524
Thank you.
Dinner was great.

497
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,695
- Thank you.
JACK: Ah, yeah.

498
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,648
You're becoming
a really great Italian chef.

499
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,904
SALLY: Well, I figured,
it was your first night here,

500
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,112
so, why not stay in?

501
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,288
- No, yeah, it's perfect,
just the three of us.

502
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,580
What are you reading?

503
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:51,782
- Oh, the poetry of Yeats.

504
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,832
(SIGHS)

505
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,002
- The "gong-tormented sea."

506
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,670
- Yeah, yeah.
You know it?

507
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,168
- Do you want to talk
about the breakup with Donald?

508
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,501
- Well, Donald was gay.

509
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,507
It was my ego
that thought I could change him,

510
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,214
and I couldn't,
and believe me, I tried.

511
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,766
- Oh, yeah?
How does one try?

512
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,721
- Well, I mean,
I don't want to get graphic,

513
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:17,183
but, I mean, let's just say
that I gave it my all.

514
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,689
And it's such a shame
because he is so brilliant

515
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,441
and he's so wonderful
out of bed.

516
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,238
I mean, so much fun to be with.

517
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:27,363
(STAMMERING) I tried
to show him how sex with a woman

518
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,196
could be as exciting
or even more so

519
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,031
than with someone
from his own sex.

520
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,491
And he tried.

521
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,827
He... He did try.

522
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,753
But, in the end,
I struck out, so...

523
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,706
- I remember you
saying how much fun

524
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,336
you had when he
took you to Paris.

525
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,777
- Have you ever
had sex with a man?

526
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,670
Me, sex with a man?

527
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,346
God, no, no, no.
I mean, no.

528
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,345
It's not something
I'm interested in ever doing.

529
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,847
- Why are you blushing?

530
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,394
Probably because
you want to try it.

531
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,565
Look, I always had a little yen

532
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,734
for sleeping with a woman,
and when I finally did it,

533
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,938
it was... (CHUCKLES)
It was very intense.

534
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,740
It was very exciting,
but unnerving.

535
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,557
- I really have no repressed...

536
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,448
- I shot this TV movie once,
and one of the scenes

537
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,500
was with this incredible
lingerie model.

538
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,327
I mean, she was to die.

539
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,504
And for whatever reason,

540
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,673
I get this message one day

541
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,500
from the assistant director
that Miss Lee

542
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,382
would like me to go
to her dressing room.

543
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:31,182
And why she was so suddenly
obsessed with me, I don't...

544
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,309
And I go.

545
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,687
And she's in a robe,

546
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,100
and she takes it off,

547
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:44,312
and gives me a big hug
and kiss,

548
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:50,572
and I just become crazed.

549
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,913
I mean, I become so excited.

550
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,867
I mean, she was just
too beautiful to turn down.

551
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,543
We had this thing
for, like, three months.

552
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,878
Yeah, it was like being
in an erotic dream.

553
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,215
And on the one hand,
yes, it was very exciting,

554
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,261
but on the other hand,
just very confusing.

555
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,187
And that's when I started
seeing the shrink

556
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,810
five days a week, and...

557
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,604
Well, fortunately,
Jamal came along,

558
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,981
and we had
a great relationship.

559
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,655
And as great

560
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,159
as the orgasms were
with Victoria,

561
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,491
they were stronger with Jamal.

562
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,448
And a lot less bewildering.

563
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,459
Excuse me.

564
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,630
- She's something, isn't she?

565
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,675
- Yeah, I think I need a few minutes to
recover from her story.

566
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:48,966
I'm still vibrating.

567
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,544
- I think she's so fun.

568
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,004
- Yeah, but look, finally,
what has she got?

569
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,510
I mean, no real acting career,
no relationship

570
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,389
that's remotely stable,
sleeping pills, shrinks...

Let's go for
a little walk tonight.

574

- Oh, no, I'm exhausted.

575
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,779
But why don't you
take her, Jack?

576
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,151
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

577
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,698
God, no, that would be
a catastrophe.

578
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,116
- Why are you so worried?

579
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,694
You think of me
as this seductress.

580
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,528
This is your problem.
- Bullshit.

581
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,489
You deliberately made up
this provocative story

582
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,040
with some lingerie model.

583
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,537
- It was true, most of it.

584
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,369
Okay, I exaggerate a little.

585

what did you have for breakfast?

- Coffee and two slices of bread
with butter and jam.

- Two slices of bread.
What were they like?

- They were good. Toasted.

- How's next Tuesday?
- The usual time?

1403
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:49,583
- Anna.
- Oh God.

1404
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:52,628
- My goodness, I didn't expect
to see you here.

1405
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:56,169
- Milly. Here I'm Milly.
- Milly. All right.

1406
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,426
Can you come to my office
tomorrow at three?

1407
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,341
- I don't have my book with me.

1408
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:05,057
- I see. If I don't hear otherwise
I'll expect you at three.

1409
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:08,189
And wear the black brassiere
and the thong.

1410
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:09,933
- Do you sail?

1411
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:10,899
- No.

1412
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,982
- Do you hunt?

1413
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,112
- No.

1414
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:19,526
Anna, how are you?
- Milly. Milly, Milly. Milly.

1415
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:25,449
I'm so nervous. I can't afford to
look foolish. (SPEAKING ITALIAN)

1416
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,079
These men are the most important
business tycoons in Rome.

1417
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:31,166
- Some <i>créme de la creme.</i>
It's my whole client list.

1418
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:33,252
- My nerves are shot from today.

1419
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:36,884
- You're too uptight, honey. Relax.
You'll have a heart attack.

1420
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,717
- How can I relax when
my life is falling apart?

1421
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:43,141
- How does your wife stand it
if you're always such a wreck?

1422
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,393
- She loves me the way I am.

1423
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,851
Is that why she was smooching
with Luchino what's-his-name?

1424
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,147
Salta.
- Mmm.

1425
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,854
- They were smooching?
- Practically.

1426
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:54,690
- You said holding hands.

1427
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:58,106
There must be some explanation.
She's a Madonna.

1428
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:02,368
- The explanation is he's a movie star,
a sex symbol.

1429
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:06,369
- And Milly is pretty, but
she'd never look at another man.

1430
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:08,875
- You obviously don't know women.

1431
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:13,538
Especially if her husband
is a nervous man afraid of his shadow.

1432
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:17,459
- What the hell was she doing smooching?
He made love to her with his eyes.

1433
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,216
- You probably don't know how
to make love with your eyes.

1434
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:25,976
- To a woman of your profession,
I must appear a middle class mouse.

1435
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:29,178
- Was your wife a virgin
when you married her?

1436
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:31,230
- None of your business.

1437
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,312
- I'll bet she was.

1438
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,269
- We had some pretty
wild times together.

1439
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:39,063
- What's your idea of wild times?

1440
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,028
Sex with the lights on?

1441
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,659
- Believe me, she was not a virgin.

1442
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:46,032
I was.

1443
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:50,412
- You really need a lesson in love.

1444
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:52,577
- From who? Surely not you?

1445
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:53,954
- Why not?

1446
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,964
It's all paid for.

1447
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:58,670
- There are people...

1448
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,006
- No one can see us.

1449
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,457
Don't let me
forget the carrots.

1450
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,308
- Okay. You really need
all this pasta?

1451
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:12,980
- Yeah, I think
we need more pasta.

1452
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,183
- More pasta? We're not cooking
for a small village.

1453
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,688
- Tomatoes.
- Okay.

1454
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,436
- Whose idea was
this enterprise?

1455
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:20,237
- Uh, it was hers.
It was Monica's.

1456
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:21,565
We all agreed
to have dinner together,

1457
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:24,150
and since Leonardo's at work all day
and Sally's at school,

1458
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,860
Monica suggested
we do the cooking.

1459
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,695
- Oh. Can I make a prediction?
- What?

1460
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:29,075
- She can't cook.

1461
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,499
(LAUGHS) - Apparently,
there are some things she can cook.

1462
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:32,917
- Like what?

1463
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,790
- Like chocolate brownies.

1464
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:37,918
- Brownies. You're going to have
brownies as a main course?

1465
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:40,250
- Yeah. Yeah, I think
it should be fun.

1466
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,835
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

1467
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,680
Do you think it needs more wine?
- Mmm, none. Mmm.

1468
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,257
- I mean, I know the Italians
cook with a lot of...

1469
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,557
- There's a lot of wine in here.
- I can really feel it.

1470
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:50,113
I don't know if it's...
You know, I...

1471
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,769
It might be the French.
- No, no. Let me see.

1472
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,517
- I just... I don't want it
to be too subtle.

1473
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:54,939
- No, it's definitely not subtle.
- No, I can definitely...

1474
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:56,974
- Well, can I taste it?
- Yeah, of course. Please.

1475
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:59,439
- Um... You know,
- I think it needs...

1476
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,941
You know, I'll get some of that
other wine that's there.

1477
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:04,069
- The other... Are you sure?
We already finished this one.

1478
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:05,195
- Uh...
- Okay.

1479
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,947
- Oh, oh, we have to put
the brownies in.

1480
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:08,573
- Can you bake?
- Can I bake?

1481
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:10,781
You said you baked.
- Well, no, I can.

1482
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:13,867
I have. I just... I left the recipe
in Los Angeles.

1483
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,623
But, you know, I'll do it.
I can do it by memory.

1484
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:16,793
I'm sure I can do it by memory.

1485
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,712
- Hey, you want to just order
from a restaurant

1486
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,632
and maybe dirty up the kitchen a little bit
and say we cooked it?

1487
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,835
- Well... Here,
let me check the sauce.

1488
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:25,591
- Hey, you know what, I'm going to
check it, too, actually.

1489
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:28,640
- Oh, do you want
penne or rigatoni?

1490
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,842
- Don't put the pasta in now.
They're not going to be home for hours.

1491
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,643
Mmm.
(CHUCKLES)

1492
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:33,970
- What?
I think I'm a little drunk.

1493
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,054
- Really?
- Yeah.

1494
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,138
- We can just...
We can fake it.

1495
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,644
- Yeah, I'm...
I'm done with this.

1496
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:39,145
- Good. Me, too.
- I'm done with the cooking.

1497
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:40,943
- Okay.
- I just... I promised Leonardo

1498
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:42,816
that I'd make
a really great dinner.

1499
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,192
- Yeah.
You know, I'm so...

1500
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:46,069
I'm so glad it worked out
between you and Leonardo.

1501
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,400
No, really, 'cause, you know,

1502
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:48,655
I'm the one that
got you together.

1503
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:49,986
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

1504
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:52,618
- Yeah, I mean, he...
He's nice.

1505
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,328
- "Sexy," I think,
you told Sally.

1506
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,044
- Mmm... Mmm...

1507
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:05,923
(STAMMERING)
Look, and this is the wine talking.

1508
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:09,380
He's not the most
soulful character.

1509
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:13,468
He's not, um...
He's not a sufferer.

1510
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:16,430
- What's so great about suffering?
- Well, I just...

1511
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,856
There's something
attractive about a man

1512
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,104
who's sensitive
to the agonies of existence.

1513
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:25,363
(CHUCKLES)

1514
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:29,193
- God, you would be perfect
to play Miss Julie.

1515
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:30,652
The Strindberg play.

1516
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,533
- The Miss Julie tactic
I learned

1517
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,579
from a friend of mine
who's a theater director.

1518
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:35,935
Tell any actress
she'd be perfect

1519
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,207
for the role of Miss Julie,

1520
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:38,375
and you can have
your way with her.

1521
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:41,546
- I'm just so amazed
that you would say that.

1522
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:45,420
I mean, Miss Julie is the role that
I was born to play.

1523
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:46,671
She is me.

1524
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,675
How could you know that?

1525
01:15:49,754 --> 01:15:52,974
- I have a kind of non sequitur question
to ask you now.

1526
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,055
- What?

1527
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:58,096
- How would you feel
if I kissed you?

1528
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:02,391
- Oh. Um...

1529
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,103
That is a non sequitur.

1530
01:16:06,187 --> 01:16:07,530
JOHN:
Oh, Little Miss Shocked.

1531
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:08,731
Didn't you see that?

1532
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,407
Two minutes ago,
she popped a Tic Tac.

1533
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:12,360
What do you think that's about?
JACK: I'm serious.

1534
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:14,491
I'm serious.
What would you think?

1535
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:19,541
- I would think that you're
living with my best friend.

1536
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:21,415
- Yeah, this is true.

1537
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:24,122
And yet I can't stop myself.

1538
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,254
- Oh, that's not good.

1539
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:32,930
- Wait, what,
you didn't like it?

1540
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,724
- No, I liked it, and
that's what's not good.

1541
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,268
JOHN: And you,

1542
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:39,516
will you ever recover from it?

1543
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,268
- I don't know.
She's perfect.

1544
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:43,145
I mean, this is
too good to be true.

1545
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:46,189
- If something is too good to be true,
you can bet it's not.

1546
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,863
- I have to have her.

1547
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,199
- What are we going
to do about this?

1548
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,535
- Were you acting?
Was this a performance?

1549
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:06,167
- I can't do this to Sally
in her home.

1550
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,339
- No, no, no,

If I'm not mistaken,
you drive a bus.

1705
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:12,062
- What's going on?
I don't understand.

1706
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,167
What do you want from me?

1707
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:15,424
- Is it true you are bringing
your laundry in to have it cleaned?

1708
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:16,708
- Yes, but what do you want?

1709
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:19,266
- Do you use starch?
- No, I don't like starch.

1710
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:21,810
- Is that a stain on your jacket?

1711
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:23,094
- It's marinara.

1712
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:25,229
- Can you tell us how you got it?

1713
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:29,860
- I was eating a plate of rigatoni.
I lifted my fork and the sauce fell.

1714
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:32,441
Why do you care?
I don't understand.

1715
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:38,944

1717
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:51,207
- Hi, Dad!

1718
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:52,795
- Easy there.

1719
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:55,211
The curse is lifted.

1720
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:58,172
We're back to normal.
I'm so happy.

1721
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:01,600
- A man named Aldo Romano
is in all the papers.

1722
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:04,602
- Let's celebrate with a pizza.

1723
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:06,680
My treat!

1724
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:09,728
- Who is the new star?
- Aldo Romano.

1725
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:13,899
I think I did really well
on the exams.

1726
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:15,939
- Of course you did.
- Yeah, you sailed through it

1727
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,221
because you studied
hard enough.

1728
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,404

- Yeah, you did.
She doubts herself for no reason.

1730
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:21,202
I don't know why.

1731
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:22,599
- Do you guys
want something else?

1732
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:24,156
- Uh, sure.
- No.

1733
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,661
- No.
- Oh. Oh, okay.

1734
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:27,163
All right, well...

1735
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:29,040
- Okay.

1736
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:34,633
You see how confident she is?

1737
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,631
So, I'm gonna
take her to dinner,

1738
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:37,632
and I'm gonna tell her tonight.

1739
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:38,883
- Okay, are you sure?

1740
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:39,929
- Yeah, yeah,
of course, of course.

1741
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:41,723
In fact, I planned out
an amazing trip for us.

1742
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:42,765
Believe it or not,
I've never been

1743
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:43,933
to the Acropolis
or the Parthenon.

1744
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:45,682
- Oh, can we go to Sicily?

1745
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:46,762
- Yeah, of course...
You know what, actually,

1746
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:47,892
we could, we could
hire a sailboat

1747
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:48,938
and go around the boot,
if you want to.

1748
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,266
- I've always seen
pictures of Palermo.

1749
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:51,440
I just think it is so romantic.

1750
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:52,483
- Yeah, well,
you can see pictures,

1751
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:53,902
but nothing is like being
there in the real place...

(PHONE RINGING)

1753
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:57,981
Do you want to...
Yeah, sure, no problem.

1754
01:27:58,774 --> 01:27:59,775
- Hello?

1755
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:01,827
No, I... Hello?

1756
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:04,822
I'm gonna see if I can...
Sure, okay.

1757
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:05,906
Hello?

1758
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:11,919
- It's sad.

1759
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,164
- What is?

1760
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:16,420
- That you're in love
with Monica.

1761
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,798
- There's just
something about her.

1762
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:21,158
- You know that Sally's
in love with you, right? - I know.

1763
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,219
- And your common sense
tells you

1764
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,300
that Sally is the much more
sensible choice.

1765
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:26,726
- Yeah, I know...

1766
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:29,931
I know all of that, and
yet I can't explain it.

1767
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,186
- I understand.

1768
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:34,146
- Guess what.
JACK: - What?

1769
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:35,899
I got a part.
- A part?

1770
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:38,196
- A good part.
In a movie.

1771
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:40,524
It's high-budget.
It shoots in Los Angeles and Tokyo.

1772
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:41,984
- Wait, where?

1773
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,410
- I have to leave tonight.

1774
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:45,487
- What was that about
a sailboat in Sicily?

1775
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:47,743
- They need me for,
like, five months.

1776
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:48,870
- Five months in Japan?

1777
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,664
- One month in Los Angeles,
four in Japan.

1778
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:53,620
I mean, assuming
it all goes on time.

1779
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:55,751
Oh, I cannot wait to go.

1780
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,629
I mean, it is, like,
my dream in life

1781
01:28:57,707 --> 01:28:59,584
to spend time in the Far East.

1782
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:01,511
- That's your dream?
- Who's in it?

1783
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:04,510
- Justin Brill,
Ricardo Ramirez.

1784
01:29:04,631 --> 01:29:06,508
- Ricardo Ramirez,
he's a very attractive man.

1785
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:08,392
- And I worked with
Justin Brill before, like,

1786
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:09,640
when he was married
to Rebecca Wright,

1787
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:13,189
and he had this big,
mad crush on me.

1788
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:14,391
- Well, he's available now.

1789
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:17,398
- This is so exciting.
I can't wait

1790
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:20,481
to get back to Los Angeles,
see my acting coach...

1791
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:23,443
I mean, no matter what it's like to visit a
place, there's nothing like home.

1792
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:24,651
- Who's directing?

1793
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:25,860
- Mark Strombel.

1794
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:27,662
I adore him.

1795
01:29:27,737 --> 01:29:29,831
I adore his work.
And you know what,

1796
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:31,374
he's, like, the only director

1797
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:34,248
that I would trust to direct the nude
scenes that I have to do.

1798
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:36,170
And although I hear
he does a lot of drugs,

1799
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:39,045
somehow that burnt-out look
is just so...

1800
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:41,676
It's just so sexy on him.

1801
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,923
I have to lose some weight.

1802
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:48,225
I mean, the, the writer
saw me on that TV thing.

1803
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:52,646
He just... He flipped out
over my quality.

1804
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:54,849
Like, five pounds or so...
I'll just start running again.

1805
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,558
I'll start running again.

1806
01:29:56,641 --> 01:30:00,566
This part is such
a great showcase for me.

1807
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,397
I just hope I can bring my dog.

1808
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,561
I hope it's not like London,

1809
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:05,283
where it's so hard
to bring a pet.

1810

(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Stay calm, Milly, stay calm.

1811
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:11,536
Better to sleep with him
and regret it...

1812
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:14,535
...than not sleep with him
and regret it.

Better to sleep with him.

01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,752
Absolutely better
to sleep with him.

1816

Yes, better to sleep with him.

Quiet or I'll kill you.

- No and I don't care. Hurry up.

You keep quiet and don't cry.

1827
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:06,419
Hand over everything.

1828

for Max's cocktail party.

2014
01:44:47,656 --> 01:44:49,203
- We're late?
- No, no.

2015
01:44:49,325 --> 01:44:50,577
- I mean, he's an old friend
of my father.

2016
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:51,751
He's not gonna mind
if we're a bit late.

2017
01:44:51,827 --> 01:44:53,188
But we should go soon.
- All right.

2018
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:55,002
Do you forgive me?

2019
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:58,004
- I'm so happy
for your husband.

2020
01:44:58,083 --> 01:45:00,131
And as for you, how could I
not forgive you?

2021
01:45:00,211 --> 01:45:01,929
I love you.

2022

- "Another Caruso."

2023
01:45:03,714 --> 01:45:05,466
"And in difficult
conditions."

2024
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:08,143
- Oh, goodness, they weren't very kind
to my father, were they?

2025
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:09,311
- Uh...

2026
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:10,933
Ooh, I think it's better
you don't hear that.

2027
01:45:11,013 --> 01:45:12,515
- No, no, I can take it.

2028
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:13,975
Just don't tell my dad.

2029
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:16,152
Thankfully, he doesn't
understand a word of Italian.

2030
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:20,949
- All right, um, "Except from Mr. Santoli's
magnificent voice..."

2031
01:45:21,023 --> 01:45:22,491
- Magnifico!

2033
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,742
- "...whoever imbecile..."

2034
01:45:26,862 --> 01:45:28,114
(STAMMERS) imbecile?

2035
01:45:28,197 --> 01:45:29,665
- Yeah, imbecile.

2036
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:34,712
- "...whoever imbecile conceived this, um,

- Oh. - Oh, well.
He's gotten worse.

2039
01:45:41,752 --> 01:45:44,346
This has to be the most beautiful terrace
in all of Rome.

2040
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:47,174
- Yeah. For my wife and I, it's a privilege
to live up here.

2041
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:50,353
- Oh, yeah. I mean, the Spanish Steps right
there, the people watching.

2042
01:45:50,427 --> 01:45:52,521
- Phyllis, the reviews
were so great.

2043
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:55,600
(STAMMERING) I mean,
the press called me, um...

2044
01:45:55,683 --> 01:45:57,244
Not, not... What was
the word they used?

2045
01:45:57,268 --> 01:46:00,943
Not a maestro, but a,
um... An "imbechile."

2046
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:02,989
What does it mean?

2047
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:04,408
- Means you're ahead
of your time.

2048
01:46:04,483 --> 01:46:07,578
- Your mother, I'm happy to say,
lucky woman,

2049
01:46:07,653 --> 01:46:09,200
married an "imbechile."

2050
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,499
- So I toast to
my future father-in-law.

2051
01:46:11,574 --> 01:46:13,872
- Ah. Well,
good luck to you guys.

2052
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:14,918
- Honey, let's go
see the piazza.

2053
01:46:14,994 --> 01:46:17,372
- Yes. Yeah.
- Gotta click, 'cause...

2054
01:46:17,454 --> 01:46:19,374
- So glad to see them.
They make a lovely couple.

2055
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:22,798
- Wow.
(SIGHS) - Oh.

2056
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:24,220
This city is unbelievable.

2057
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:26,926
Think we should get married

2058
01:46:27,006 --> 01:46:28,553
right in front of
the fountain there.

2059
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:30,134
- Anything you want.
(CHUCKLES)

2060
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:32,936
- Oh, I could
stand here all night,

2061
01:46:33,012 --> 01:46:34,309
it's so beautiful.

It's me that knows
Rome the best,

2064
01:47:12,468 --> 01:47:14,687
not a traffic policeman
or anyone.

2065
01:47:15,346 --> 01:47:18,225
I see all from here.

2066
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:21,186
The Romans, the students,

2067
01:47:21,268 --> 01:47:23,612
the lovers
on the Spanish Steps.

2068
01:47:25,356 --> 01:47:28,860
There are many stories,
next time you come.
