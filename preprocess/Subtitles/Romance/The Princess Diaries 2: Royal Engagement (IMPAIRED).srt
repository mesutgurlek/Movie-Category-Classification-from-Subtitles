00:00:19,409 --> 00:00:24,969
<i>(man) Although your diplomas
are equally specific, remember:</i>

2
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,407
You are all going out
into the world as individuals.

3
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:32,096
I now proudly present

4
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:37,869
this year's Woodrow Wilson School
of Public and International Affairs

5
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:39,720
graduating class.

6
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:55,663
Go, go, go.

7
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,426
- Bye. We love you.
- You have to write.

8
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:02,745
- Thank your mom for all the cookies, OK?
- I'm very proud of you.

00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:12,173
<i>(Mia) Dear diary.</i>

10
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:16,860
<i>Well, it's me. Brand-new
college graduate-slash-princess.</i>

11
00:01:17,383 --> 00:01:20,549
<i>Oh, I can't believe it's been five years</i>

12
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,195
<i>since Grandma told me
that I was a princess.</i>

13
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:29,091
Me? A... a princess? Shut up.

14
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,381
<i>And right after that,
my mother surprised me</i>

15
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:34,975
<i>by marrying my high-school teacher,
Patrick O'Connell.</i>

16
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:38,882
<i>It must be going well,
because they are now expecting a baby.</i>

17
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:43,978
<i>Lilly's remained the same,
as she continues to cause turmoil,</i>

18
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,415
<i>but now as a graduate
student at Berkeley.</i>

19
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:48,537
<i>Which she calls "Berserkeley. "</i>

20
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:52,242
<i>"How's Michael?” you may ask.</i>

21
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:56,382
<i>Well, we're just friends now, as he
went off to tour the country with his band.</i>

22
00:01:57,822 --> 00:01:58,749
Princess Mia.

23
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,477
Look out the window,
and welcome back to Genovia.

24
00:02:11,622 --> 00:02:14,540
<i>Oh, there it is. My beautiful Genovia.</i>

25
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:19,948
<i>Of course, I'm completely excited to be
going back, but I'm also a bit nervous.</i>

26
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:22,124
<i>(man) Genovia One has landed.</i>

27
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:24,915
<i>(Mia) Grandma Clarisse will step down
by the end of this year as queen,</i>

28
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:27,008
<i>and I'll be taking over, since I'm now 21.</i>

29
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,228
<i>Mira, la princesa Mia.</i>

30
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,789
It's the princess from America! Hi.

31
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,604
<i>(man) Viva la princesa.</i>

32
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:37,228
<i>I know I studied diplomacy
and political science at school, but...</i>

33
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:41,383
<i>there is no course in "Queen,"
or "How To Run A Country 101."</i>

34
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:46,123
<i>But Grandma's going to help me, and
I'll take over when she thinks I'm ready.</i>

35
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:50,133
<i>Of course, I wonder... will I ever be ready?</i>

36
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:54,477
<i>In the meantime, I'm going to live
in a beautiful palace like in a fairy tale,</i>

37
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:58,199
<i>and eventually sit on a throne
and rule the people of Genovia.</i>

38
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:00,324
<i>Is that scary or what?</i>

39
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,160
<i>Well, maybe Fat Louie
can give me some help.</i>

40
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:10,630
Her Royal Highness Princess Amelia
Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi

41
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:11,944
has arrived.

42
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,435
Welcome home, Princess.

43
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,946
And her royal pussycat, Sir Fat Louie.

44
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:28,444
<i>The one downer in my fairy tale
is I've never been in love.</i>

45
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:31,435
Countess Puck of Austria.

46
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:35,819
<i>However, this evening
is my 21st-birthday party,</i>

47
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:40,524
<i>and our tradition says I have to dance
with all the eligible bachelors in Genovia.</i>

48
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,406
<i>So maybe I'll meet
my Prince Charming tonight.</i>

49
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:48,931
<i>(woman) The queen is coming.</i>

50
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,218
Here she comes. Look alive.

51
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:53,843
Places.

52
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:56,905
She'll have a double-door entrance.

53
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,559
The eagle is flying.
Repeat, the eagle is flying.

54
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:00,873
She's in the foyer.

55
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,054
Beautiful.

56
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,919
But you're late, Your Majesty.

57
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,657
A queen is never late.
Everyone else is simply early.

58
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,635
Of course.

59
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:30,919
<i>(man) Her Majesty
Clarisse Renaldi,</i>

60
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:33,887
Queen of Genovia.

00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:50,058
Greetings, good friends.

63

I am delighted
to welcome you here this evening.

<i>(# chamber music)</i>

65
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:01,825
- Thank you.
- I hope they have string cheese.

66
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:04,011
Ah, good.

67
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:11,251
Many of you will remember King Rupert's
and my granddaughter, Princess Mia.

68
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:14,262
<i>(all) King Rupert. May he rest in peace.</i>

69
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:17,720
Will you please
raise your glasses in celebration

70
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,683
of Princess Mia's 21st birthday.

71
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:27,411
Presenting Her Royal Highness
Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi,

72
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:30,608
Princess of Genovia.

<i>(all) To Princess Mia.</i>

78
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,378
- And happy birthday.
- Thank you.

<i>(speaks Greek)</i>

80

<i>- Oh, I don't speak Greek.
- (speaks Greek)</i>

81
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:14,628
<i>- And you obviously don't speak English.
- (speaks Greek)</i>

82
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,129
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

83
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,162
One, two, three. One, two, three.

84
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:23,996
- One, two...
- Ow!

85
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:24,723
Sorry.

86
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:28,942
<i>(muttering in French)</i>

87
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,318
- Have you met the princess yet?
- Briefly. But she wasn't very friendly.

88
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:38,496
I got a hello and a goodbye.
Is this an American custom?

89
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:48,345
- I saw that.
- Oh, uh...

90
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:51,345
<i>(squealing)</i>

91
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:52,754
Oh, I've missed you.

92
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:54,501
- Sebastian.
- Majesty.

93
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,943
- Sheila.
- Majesty.

94
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:59,283
- What have you been up to?
- Oh, just partying, girl. You know.

95
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:03,244
Oh, your foot. I'm so sorry. Are...

96
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:04,275
Are you all right?

97
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:05,405
I'll survive, Your Highness.

98
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:08,247
The fault was entirely my own. I apologize.

99
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,325
Are you sure you don't want to
exchange licenses and proof of insurance?

100
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:14,538
No, no. These shoes
were a little big anyway.

101
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:16,583
The swelling should help them fit better.

102
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,118
Hey, get a load of this guy.

103
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:29,733
Shimmy shimmy.

104
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:34,478
<i>Hey, hey, hey. Bitte.</i>

105
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:37,140
- You are a beautiful dancer.
- Oh, why, thank you so much.

106
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,430
Like a deer.

107
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:40,931
Or a chipmunk in the forest.

108
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,919
Looks like he's trying to land a plane.

109
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:47,358
Woodland animals
are a lovely thing to be compared to.

110
00:07:47,577 --> 00:07:48,297
May I?

111
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:57,619
- Your timing is impeccable. Thank you.
- You're welcome, Your Highness.

112
00:07:57,837 --> 00:07:59,608
Mia. I like to be called Mia.

113
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:02,178
And you are?

114
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:03,883
Nicholas. Just Nicholas.

115
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:08,023
Well, I'm very glad to see that my
clumsiness hasn't affected your dancing.

116
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:09,927
I'm sorry I stepped on your foot.

117
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,462
You can step on my foot anytime.

118
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,350
Aww.

119
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:22,556
It is Prince Jacques' turn.

120
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,619
Your Highness.

121
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:33,992
If this were my party,
we'd be kissing by now.

122
00:08:35,745 --> 00:08:39,420
That's Prince Jacques.
He's about 12 years old.

123
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,776
He's a very precocious prince.

124
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,109
He wears aftershave
to make people think that he's older.

125
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,666
May I blow in your ear?

126
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:48,869
Can you reach it?

127
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:53,370
Princess, there's someone
from parliament you should meet.

128
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,421
Charlotte, how many
members of parliament are there?

129
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,639
Only two left, Your Highness.

130
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:02,795
- Cake, ladies?
- Oh, dear.

131
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:05,419
Oh, Your Highness, pardon me,
I am so sorry. It was only an accident.

132
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,744
It's fine, it's fine.
No harm, no foul, no bruise.

133
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:10,414
Thank you so much.

134
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:13,232
You should be more careful,
Your Royal Highness.

135
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:16,294
Somebody might try
to take that away from you.

136
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:19,335
Oh, I hope not.
But thank you so much for all your help.

137
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:22,950
Someone like me.

138
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,387
<i>Welcome back to "Eggs with Elsie. "</i>

139
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:30,806
<i>I'm Elsie Kentworthy,
and today's topic is Princess Mia.</i>

140
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:32,726
Hi. How's it going?

141
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:35,875
- So sorry, I thought I was alone.
- No, Miss.

142
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:39,127
I'm Brigitte, if it pleases you.
At your service.

143
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:42,353
- And I'm Brigitta, Miss.
- Brigitte and Brigitta, I'm Mia.

144
00:09:42,353 --> 00:09:44,513
And, please, you don't...
Don't curtsy like that.

145
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:47,637
- Not like this? How do you like it, then?
- Like this, maybe?

146
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:50,511
No, no, no, I didn't mean, like, you know...

147
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:52,917
No, no, not that way. I didn't mean it, um...

148
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:57,419
The queen bids you good morning,
Princess. She's in session with parliament.

149
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,657
- OK.
- I see you've met your lady's maids.

150
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:01,032
Yeah. Um...

151
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:04,246
- How do you turn off the curtsies?
- Oh.

152
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:06,344
Enough bowing. Back to your chores.

153
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:10,105
Her Majesty will meet you
in one hour at the throne room.

154
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,751
- OK.
- I'm sorry your suite isn't ready yet.

155
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:14,794
But you're welcome
to stay here in Her Majesty's suite...

156
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:16,231
No, no, no, no, it's fine. It's...

157
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:19,532
Hey, can I explore
the palace a little bit?

158
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:20,951
<i>- Of course.
- (dog barks)</i>

159
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,982
Oh. Well, you've met Maurice.

160
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:25,260
<i>(Mia) Hey, Mo.</i>

161
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:27,372
The throne room, in an hour.

162
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:32,637
The parliament of Genovia is in session.
Prime Minister Motaz presiding.

163
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:35,041
Viscount Mabrey, you have the floor.

164
00:10:35,473 --> 00:10:37,607
<i>(man) Monsieur Mabrey, s'il vous plaît.</i>

165
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:43,325
As we all know, the 21st birthday
of an heir to the Genovian bloodline

166
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:45,723
is indeed a matter
of great public significance.

167
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:51,687
It signifies that this young person
is eligible to assume the crown.

168
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:54,762
Indeed, we are well aware of this, Viscount.

169
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:57,754
The queen has already
indicated that Princess Mia

170
00:10:57,754 --> 00:11:02,190
intends to learn more at her side
before assuming the throne.

171
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:06,974
It was not Princess Mia
to whom I was referring.

172
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:28,898
Oh, wow.

173
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:35,244
King Chevalier

174
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:40,367
was the great-great-great-grandfather of...

175
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:41,929
Hello?

176
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,991
Ah... Oh.

177
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:46,340
<i>(clears throat)</i>

178
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:48,663
Proceed.

179
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:52,222
<i>(gasps)</i>

180
00:11:57,859 --> 00:11:58,837
Nice.

181
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:04,834
Hello?

182
00:12:22,894 --> 00:12:23,829
<i>(Mabrey) So.</i>

183
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,580
As of the 20th of October last year,

184
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:32,769
on the occasion of his 21st birthday,

185
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:38,894
another Genovian of the royal bloodline
became eligible to assume the throne.

186
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,923
What?

187
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:42,912
My nephew, Lord Devereaux.

188
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,864
I beg your pardon?

189
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:49,011
My nephew's mother was my wife's sister.

190
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:53,520
Therefore, Your Majesty,
I am pleased to say

191
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:56,511
that my nephew
is ready to take his place

192
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:59,705
as Genovia's rightful king.

193
00:13:02,627 --> 00:13:04,411
Shut up.

194
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:06,750
I beg your pardon?

195
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:11,884
- I mean...
- "Shut up" doesn't always mean shut up.

196
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:13,508
<i>"Taisez-vous" veut dire...</i>

197
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:16,354
In America, it's like
"Oh, my," "Gee whiz," "Wow. "

198
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:17,598
<i>- "Fantastique," "Superbe," "Oy vey. "
- Yeah, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.</i>

199
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:21,440
But isn't Princess Mia
first in line to ascend the throne?

200
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,160
Not yet.

201
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:26,566
Genovian law states
that a princess must marry

202
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:28,993
before she can take the throne.

203
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:31,442
<i>(Clarisse) We have never
enforced that law.</i>

204
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:34,412
A man doesn't have to marry to be king.

205
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:37,254
I mean, this is the 21st century,
for heaven's sake.

206
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:41,113
My granddaughter should
be given the same rights as any man.

207
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:42,174
Yeah!

208
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:52,330
Genovia shall have no queen
lest she be bound in matrimony.

209
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,018
Lord Palimore?

210
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:59,517
That is the law of Genovia
for the last 300 years.

211
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:04,267
Princess Mia is not qualified to rule
because she is unmarried.

212
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,290
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

213
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,852
Not all of us are sure that the princess

214
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:15,516
is the most suitable choice
to govern our great nation.

215
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:17,205
<i>(all) Ooh!</i>

216
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:18,847
Now, now, gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.

217
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:22,259
I suggest this honored body

218
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:24,893
allow Princess Mia one year,

219
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:27,261
during which time she must marry,

220
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:31,831
or she forfeits the throne
of Genovia to young Lord Devereaux.

221
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:32,911
What? No.

222
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:35,914
- I object. I object most strongly.
- One year?

223
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:37,382
- 60 days.
- Two months.

224
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:38,686
60 days?

225
00:14:38,686 --> 00:14:39,965
30 days.

226
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:45,836
How could parliament expect me
to fall in love in 30 days? It's like...

227
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,418
It's like it's a big trick to get me
to have an arranged marriage, or...

228
00:14:50,915 --> 00:14:52,043
No.

229
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:55,325
No, there's no...
That's it, there's no "or. " There's... I...

230
00:14:55,668 --> 00:14:57,400
An arranged marriage is my only choice.

231
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:01,659
What kind of person
agrees to an arranged marriage?

232
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:04,894
Uh...

233
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,925
You agreed to an arranged marriage.

234
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:10,846
- Right.
- Yes, I did.

235
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,532
And it turned out quite splendidly.

236
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:19,948
He was my best friend.
We grew very fond of each other.

237
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:22,239
I'm sure, Grandma, but...

238
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:26,579
I dream of love, not fondness.

239
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,318
But you don't have to do this, Mia.
You don't have to become queen.

240
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:36,014
This is so unfair.

241
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:43,799
<i>(man's voice) Amelia.</i>

242
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:47,097
<i>(both) Courage is not the absence of fear,</i>

243
00:15:47,954 --> 00:15:53,283
<i>(alone) but rather the judgment
that something else is more important...</i>

244
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:55,429
than fear.

245
00:15:58,368 --> 00:16:03,408
There are 550 years
of Renaldis on these walls.

246
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:06,815
And I will be up there
next to my father.

247
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:13,768
I'm sure I want my chance
to make a difference as a ruler.

248
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:18,224
Spoken like a true queen.

249
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:27,099
You, my boy, a true-born Genovian.

250
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:28,912
You should be our king.

251
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:31,205
I agree.

252
00:16:32,393 --> 00:16:35,394
But how can we make it happen?

253
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:38,244
Give me one of your arrows.

254
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:41,798
I'm going to show you a trick that
I learned from an old Italian philosopher.

255
00:16:42,098 --> 00:16:43,392
Niccolò Machiavelli.

256
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:49,517
I can make this dart
hit the bull's-eye every time.

257
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:51,647
<i>(yells)</i>

258
00:16:55,003 --> 00:16:57,974
Yes, but that is cheating.

259
00:16:58,192 --> 00:16:58,849
You've got it.

260
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:04,973
Lord Devereaux will be arriving shortly,
Mrs. Kout, with his snake of an uncle.

261
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:05,913
Yes, Your Majesty.

262
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:08,756
- Your Majesty.
- Hm?

263
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:12,755
I know Lionel is the prime minister's
nephew and he's interning for the summer

264
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:14,319
because he wants to learn about security.

265
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:18,998
But he never leaves my side.
He sticks to me like Velcro, madam.

266
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:22,458
It won't last very long.
He returns to school in the autumn.

267
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,661
- He wants an audience with you.
- What, now?

268
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:25,537
Now.

269
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:27,645
Lionel?

270
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,350
Short.

271
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,456
I don't know if you've met
Mrs. Kout, our housekeeper,

272
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:37,587
and Priscilla and Olivia, my lady's maids.

273
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:40,091
I'm doing a background check on Olivia.

274
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,071
Oh, that's not necessary, Lionel.

275
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:46,402
Everybody in this room
has high-priority clearance.

276
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:47,609
Of course, of course.

277
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,776
- Your Majesty?
- Hm?

278
00:17:50,197 --> 00:17:53,049
I would gladly take a bullet for you.

279
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,214
Oh, how brave.

280
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,588
Most interns don't even
want to fetch me my tea.

281
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:00,734
The limousine is at the gates, madam.

282
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:11,416
<i>(Clarisse) The viscount
is not staying, just the nephew.</i>

283
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,525
Joseph, I want you to protect him
and keep your eye on him at all times.

284
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:17,024
- Of course. Lionel.
- Oh, hello.

285
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:19,882
So is this all right to welcome
the viscount and his nephew?

286
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,603
Very appropriate. And pretty.

287
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:25,429
Oh, I can't believe
parliament invited the guy

288
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,071
who's trying to steal the throne
to stay here with us at the palace.

289
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:29,978
Oh, no, parliament didn't invite him.

290
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:31,201
I did.

291
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:33,070
Wha...

292
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,308
I offered to have him
hung by his toes in our courtyard.

293
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:39,229
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, what about Joe's suggestion, huh?

294
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:45,055
No. If there's any mischief going on,
I'd prefer it be right under my nose.

295
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:51,882
<i>(Mabrey) It's not a very difficult job,
you know.</i>

296
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,854
You just have to open the door
before the passenger dies of old age.

297
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:59,103
- Hello, I'm here to welcome you.
- Your staff is incompetent and unreliable.

298
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:02,290
I just so don't want
to be nice to this guy, you know?

299
00:19:02,713 --> 00:19:05,309
I mean, he is rude,
he's arrogant, self-centered, he's...

300
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:06,618
Ah, well, have you met him?

301
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:09,914
- No.
- Neither have I.

302
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,370
Yeah, but he probably is, Grandma.
I mean...

303
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:16,703
Like, now, all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
he wants to be the king of Genovia?

304
00:19:17,027 --> 00:19:20,087
- What is that about?
- Oh, tush.

305
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,934
Whatever he is, we will be charm itself.

306
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:26,229
We will present ourselves
with grace and poise.

307
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:30,269
<i>(man) Announcing Viscount Mabrey

- Your Highness.
- Mabrey.

310
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:43,828
Ma'am, may I introduce my nephew,
Lord Nicholas Devereaux.

311
00:19:44,612 --> 00:19:48,485
Nicholas. We are delighted
to make your acquaintance.

312
00:19:48,485 --> 00:19:50,015
Your Majesty, the pleasure is all mine.

313
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:53,600
And thank you so much
for inviting me to stay at the palace.

314
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,641
May I present my granddaughter Mia.

315
00:19:57,706 --> 00:19:59,017
Your Highness.

316
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:04,831
Mia, would you care to welcome our guest?

317
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:12,063

Uh...

321
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:25,046
I will personally
get some ice for that foot,

322
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:27,127
and I'll be with you
as quickly as I possibly can.

323
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:30,112
An accident.

324
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,062
Of course.

325
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:36,266
She's training to be a flamenco dancer.

326
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:44,379
Would you care to explain
what was going on out there?

327
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:45,360
Sorry.

328
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:50,379
I, uh, have met Lord Nicholas, actually.

329
00:20:50,713 --> 00:20:53,704
Yep. At the ball. Didn't know
who he was, so, you know, we...

330
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:57,160
We danced, and I flirted.

331
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,111
I feel so stupid right now.

332
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:04,338
I see. Well, as your queen
I absolutely cannot condone it.

333
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:08,284
As a grandma, I say, "right on. "

334
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:13,418
Now, if you'll come with me,
I have something to show you.

335
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:16,783
- Oh, yeah.
- I think you could leave that right there.

336
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:19,122
Uh... Yeah.

337
00:21:19,122 --> 00:21:20,494
Thank you, culinary people.

338

339

The renovations for your suite
are finally finished.

340
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,909
Should have been ready for you
when you arrived,

341
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:33,995
but unfortunately we asked
Rupert's cousin to do the bathroom.

342
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:38,573
It's a good lesson. Nepotism
belongs in the arts, not in plumbing.

343
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:46,030
This is your very own suite.

Good.

350
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:12,311
We just made the bed.

351
00:22:12,591 --> 00:22:15,469
This is so cool.

There's more.

- Is that mine?
- Why don't you go and find out?

355

OK.

356

Now for the best surprise of all.

Wow.

371
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:49,104
Gorgeous, Grandma. But kind of a letdown

I think this is
as good a moment as any to bow out.

380

Oh.

391
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:41,801
If he's not eligible,
why is he included in these pictures?

392

- What about the title "husband"?
- Yeah, he's cute.

someone who can help you run a country
without ego getting in the way.

Someone attractive, smart,
but not arrogant.

Yes. Someone very much like him.

Good choice, Mia.
I wonder I didn't think of him before.

465
00:28:35,662 --> 00:28:41,163
- Do I have to put it on myself?
- No, I could do that.

466
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:43,287
- OK.
- Yes.

467
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,505
Oh, my goodness. It was a ring.

468
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:52,308
A royal proposal has been made.

469

- If you are.

of Princess Mia and Andrew Jacoby,
Duke of Kenilworth.

473
00:29:22,782 --> 00:29:24,921
Here, just like the princess.

<i>(Nicholas) Uncle, I hate to say this,
but you were wrong.</i>

Princess Mia has managed
to find a husband within a week.

476
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:49,238
Mia cannot possibly be happy
with the idea of an arranged marriage.

477
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:53,583
Your task is to romance her.

478
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:56,221
Show her what
a real relationship could be like.

479
00:29:56,455 --> 00:29:59,382
A relationship filled with heat and passion.

480
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,549
- And change her mind about Andrew.
- Exactly.

481
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:09,974
And the 30-day deadline expires,
and the throne is ours.

482
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:12,134
And you're sure my father wanted this?

483
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:13,863
It was his dearest wish.

484
00:30:14,158 --> 00:30:16,239
His last words to me were:

485
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:20,611
"Help him, Arthur.
One day he could be king. "

486
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:24,269
I don't recall him
ever mentioning that to me.

487
00:30:24,507 --> 00:30:26,708
Well, you wouldn't.
You were only six years old when he died.

488
00:30:26,962 --> 00:30:29,253
But you do remember
who he named you after, don't you?

489
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:30,737
Yes. Grandfather Nicholas.

490

No, no, no, no. Niccolò Machiavelli.

491

Power, my boy,
means never having to say you're sorry.

492
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:43,334
Here, kitty kitty kitty. Come here, kitty kitty.

493
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:46,572
Yes. Thank you.

494
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:47,709

- No.

503

Actually, on the contrary.
I was just admiring my ring.

504

It was Andrew's grandmother's.

505
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:25,745
You know, he really is so romantic.

506
00:31:26,027 --> 00:31:32,278
Well, if you'll excuse me, I really
must go see to some wedding details.

I'm sorry, is there something

No, no.

509
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:42,819
You are the one
who stomped on me with your big feet.

510
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:44,463
Big feet?

511
00:31:45,223 --> 00:31:46,713
Brigitte, I found her.

512
00:31:47,276 --> 00:31:48,505
Uh, Brigitta.

Well, you know,
you danced with my big feet.

516
00:31:57,442 --> 00:32:01,067
Fine. I danced with you. Call The Hague,

517
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:04,070
Mia, I would remind you
that we only danced for about a minute.

518
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:07,473
It was more than a minute.

519
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:09,692
Well, maybe a minute and a half.

520
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,591
Fine. It was a minute and a half,
but it was also a lie,

521
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:17,914
because you didn't tell me who you were
and that you were trying to steal my crown.

522
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:20,903
Please pardon me, I just had
a momentary lapse of good manners.

523
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,683
You see, usually, when I ask a woman
to dance, I always show her my family tree.

524
00:32:24,683 --> 00:32:26,570
Oh. Well, aren't you just...

525

- Well.

- What is the point?

536

I...

537
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:56,898
The point is that I'm onto you. Oh boy,
am I onto what you are trying to do.

538
00:32:56,898 --> 00:32:59,760
- And what am I trying to do?
- I think we both know exactly what that is.

- She was in a closet?
- With him. Yes.

546
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:23,586
Does she have the makings of a queen?

547
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:26,132
Well, she's young,
but I've always believed in her.

- Yes, they do.

- Yes.

Yes, my dear. I would kneel
if it weren't for my knee replacement.

Joseph, there's a wedding to be planned.

you have to show the people you care.

<i>(woman) Citizen Jacqueline Grenough.</i>

618
00:36:55,939 --> 00:36:58,481
We will review
your scholarship application,

619
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:01,983
and someone will be in touch
no later than the end of next week.

620

<i>Oh, merci, Your Majesty.</i>

621
00:37:04,157 --> 00:37:07,171
Here is a melon for your table.

622
00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:09,609
<i>Oh, merci, Jacqueline. C'est gentil.</i>

<i>(woman) Citizen Tiny Duval.</i>

624

<i>- Your Majesty.
- Bonjour, Tiny.</i>

625
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:18,828
May I present
my granddaughter, Princess Mia.

626
00:37:19,077 --> 00:37:20,464
- Princess Mia.
- Monsieur.

627
00:37:20,464 --> 00:37:23,235
Thank you for seeing me today.
Something for your table.

628
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:24,358
Thank you.

629
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:26,452
She's my favorite.

630
00:37:27,817 --> 00:37:29,199
I hope you like omelets.

631
00:37:29,418 --> 00:37:31,670
- May I?
- Of course.

632
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,536
Be careful.

633
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,388
- Aw, it's a chicken.
- Careful.

634
00:37:45,789 --> 00:37:47,759
We have a chicken situation
in the throne room.

635
00:37:53,025 --> 00:37:54,433
Mia.

636
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,934
Yeah?

637
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:59,793
A princess never chases a chicken.

638

<i>(Mia) Dear diary.</i>

640
00:38:09,796 --> 00:38:12,182
<i>The whole court
will be watching, plus the troops.</i>

641
00:38:12,495 --> 00:38:14,963
<i>And I'm wearing a floor-length dress.</i>

642
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:19,025
<i>I also have to be ladylike
while riding sidesaddle. Hah!</i>

643
00:38:19,622 --> 00:38:21,714
- I can't ride sidesaddle.
- No, no, no.

644
00:38:21,714 --> 00:38:24,270
I couldn't ride sidesaddle either
when I was your age,

645
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,713
and frankly, dear,
it is acutely uncomfortable.

646
00:38:26,713 --> 00:38:29,635
Herbie is my riding companion.
Here he is.

647
00:38:30,246 --> 00:38:32,152
Herbie.

648
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:38,020
- It's a wooden leg.
- Yes.

649
00:38:38,808 --> 00:38:43,277
That is impressively sneaky, Grandma.
Did you come up with this on your own?

650
00:38:43,277 --> 00:38:45,527
<i>Oh, no, it's a centuries-old idea.</i>

651
00:38:45,527 --> 00:38:48,339
<i>- And you put the riding boot on it...
- Exactly.</i>

652
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:51,123
<i>Our ancestors knew
a thing or two, right?</i>

653
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:55,526
<i>You just drape your skirt over it
and nobody suspects a thing.</i>

<i>(man) Hear ye, hear ye.</i>

655

Princess Amelia
Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi

656
00:39:01,262 --> 00:39:04,229
reviews the Royal Guard of Genovia.

657
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:08,198
Now, the last time we spoke,
you mentioned that Princess Mia's horse,

658
00:39:08,498 --> 00:39:12,622
Sandy, gets easily spooked by snakes.

659
00:39:12,841 --> 00:39:15,405
So let's get it really spooked,
shall we?

660
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,302
This is a fake snake.

661
00:39:17,643 --> 00:39:19,589
Oh, you're very observant.
A regular David Attenborough.

662
00:39:19,797 --> 00:39:21,920
That's rubber, yes.
But it will spook the horse.

663
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:25,526
I'm Nick. Viscount Mabrey's nephew.

664

Ah, the chap who's trying
to stage the palace coup.

665
00:39:28,495 --> 00:39:30,087
I'm Andrew Jacoby. Nice to meet you.

666
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:34,623
Lilly Moscovitz, official best friend
of future queen. I don't like you.

667
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,353
Pleasure.

668
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,810
Atten... hurgh!

669
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:43,026
I like all these men wearing helmets.

- Princess.

00:40:13,434 --> 00:40:16,653
Princess. It's OK, Princess. I'm here.

676
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,464
No wonder she's so clumsy.
She's got a wooden leg.

<i>(laughs loudly)</i>

You shouldn't hide.

682
00:40:52,873 --> 00:40:55,154
It only makes them gossip more.

683
00:40:56,636 --> 00:40:57,952
What do you want?

684
00:40:58,606 --> 00:41:05,549
Just think, Mia. One more leg
and you could've easily outrun your horse.

685
00:41:06,093 --> 00:41:07,437
I don't need this right now.

686
00:41:07,797 --> 00:41:09,117
Mia, I'm...

687
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:14,498
I'm sorry, I...

688
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,768
No, you're not.
You never think about anyone but yourself.

689
00:41:17,768 --> 00:41:21,674
So just this once,
can you please let me be miserable,

690
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:23,676
and not make me feel
worse about myself?

691
00:41:23,676 --> 00:41:25,903
- Just go away. Go away, go away...
- Mia...

692
00:41:26,271 --> 00:41:30,622
Princess, excuse me.
The queen has arrived.

693
00:41:33,051 --> 00:41:33,528
Yes.

694
00:41:40,093 --> 00:41:41,424
Nicholas.

695
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:43,873
Am I going to be disappointed in you?

696
00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:48,614
Unfortunate incident, that.

697
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,999
I'm just leaving.
You going to come and see me off?

698
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:54,656
I'd like to speak
with your uncle alone, Nicholas. Please.

699
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:06,314
Viscount. You may not be aware of what
my job entails as the royal head of security.

700
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:10,780
My job is to protect the crown,
to make sure no harm comes to the crown.

701
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:15,187
To step in when someone toys
with the crown's emotions, you see.

702
00:42:15,779 --> 00:42:19,190
I think the entire country understands how
well you cater for the crown's emotions.

703
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:27,969
If you hurt my girl,
you will answer directly to me.

704
00:42:28,176 --> 00:42:30,925
And whatever crimes
I commit against you, remember:

705
00:42:31,188 --> 00:42:34,000
I have diplomatic immunity
in 46 countries.

706
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,001
Including Puerto Rico.

707
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:39,876
Sir, you will find that the word "fear"
is not in my vocabulary.

708
00:42:40,178 --> 00:42:40,803
Perhaps.

709
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:42,844
But it's in your eyes.

710
00:42:48,206 --> 00:42:49,733
You forgot something.

711
00:42:52,468 --> 00:42:55,033
<i>- Au revoir, Pierre, et merci beaucoup.
- Très bien, Majesté.</i>

712
00:42:55,344 --> 00:42:58,250
Nicholas, I...
I want to ask you a question.

713
00:42:59,302 --> 00:43:01,213
Of course, Your Majesty.

714
00:43:01,782 --> 00:43:05,344
Why are you so against
Princess Mia being queen?

715
00:43:05,718 --> 00:43:08,874
Well, my uncle feels that
Princess Mia doesn't know the people.

716
00:43:08,874 --> 00:43:11,533
And you feel you do know the people?

717
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:14,146
Yes. I was born here,
I went to primary school here.

718
00:43:14,665 --> 00:43:16,614
I am a true Genovian.

719
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:19,291
Mia didn't even know
she was Genovian until high school,

720
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,681
and to be frank,
she's spent little time here since then.

721
00:43:22,303 --> 00:43:26,084
Well, I happen to feel
that she'll make a great ruler.

722
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:29,696
She's terribly bright, sensitive, caring.

723
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,037
- I know that.
- You do?

724
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,176
Yes. Yes, I do. But...

725
00:43:35,473 --> 00:43:38,929
How can one rule the people
if they do not know the people?

726
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:41,615
Touché. That's a very good question.

Guinea studying the bark of a yam tree.

the children from the shelter</i>

will be housed at the winter castle
in the mountains of Libbet.

935
00:55:44,449 --> 00:55:48,420
The use of the castle as a resort

936
00:55:48,784 --> 00:55:52,170
is sort of a perk
for parliament members and dignitaries.

937

- Exactly.
- Oh.

938
00:55:54,253 --> 00:55:57,559
Well, I'm going to de-perk it,
and convert it into a children's shelter

939
00:55:57,559 --> 00:55:59,575
until money can be raised
for one of their own.

943
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,614
- I don't speak to my brother.
- Oh.

944

- Oh, no, you won't. I'm an architect.

951
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:28,591
- I am part of this parliament.
- Oh, you just go skiing...

952
00:56:28,591 --> 00:56:30,396

... and you like to be an outdoorsman.

And she really cares about Genovia.

Maybe...

1093
01:03:48,286 --> 01:03:50,315
Well, maybe it wouldn't be so bad
if she ran the country.

Are you mad?

1095
01:03:52,576 --> 01:03:55,441
She believes in Genovia
so much that she's convinced herself

1096
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:57,136
to marry someone that
she knows she can never love.

1097
01:03:57,826 --> 01:04:01,075
I can't believe that I am hearing this.
You want her to rule?

After all the effort that we have put in,
to end up with nothing?

1099
01:04:06,011 --> 01:04:10,451

in good hands, and she would be happy.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you listen.

That she will leave Andrew and marry you?

I put in the effort to make you a king,

1107
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,829
not to have you marry a queen.
I will not have it, sir.

1108
01:04:32,114 --> 01:04:35,445
Don't worry, Uncle. That will never happen.
Mia doesn't care for me that way.

Oh, but you care for her.

1110

Uncle, I just want us to stop
trying to sabotage her. That's all.

1111
01:04:41,427 --> 01:04:48,700
All right. If that's what you really want.

1112

He's trying to steal the crown.

01:12:56,285 --> 01:12:59,975
What a pity we missed it at the party.

- Tell me a secret.</i>

1238
01:13:21,051 --> 01:13:22,771
- Isn't that the same?
- Almost.

1239
01:13:23,151 --> 01:13:24,941
But anyone can see your desires.

1240
01:13:25,622 --> 01:13:26,910
No one knows what's in your heart.

1241
01:13:27,692 --> 01:13:29,786
- Tell me something.
- Um...

I used to pretend I was sick
when I had a test in school.

- We all did that.
- OK.

01:13:42,992 --> 01:13:45,411
Sometimes, I put chocolate milk
on my cereal.

1246
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,714
I am deathly afraid of jellyfish.

1247
01:13:50,819 --> 01:13:52,632
I haven't danced with you
since your birthday.

1248
01:13:53,653 --> 01:13:55,239
That's a fact. It's not a secret.

1249
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,509
The secret is, is that...

1250
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,602
I still want to.

- Hello.

01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:07,533
- We stayed out all night.
- Yes, we did.

1267
01:15:09,472 --> 01:15:10,338
We stayed out all night.

Is that...

1269
01:15:17,127 --> 01:15:19,180
- There's a man in that boat.
- What?

1270
01:15:19,454 --> 01:15:21,628
Do you see that?
There's somebody over there.

1271
01:15:22,298 --> 01:15:25,400
He's probably some fisherman, I suppose.

1272
01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:35,422
With a video camera?

1273
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,910
- What?
- You're really low.

1274
01:15:38,381 --> 01:15:40,320
No, Mia.
I have no idea who that man is.

1275
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,224
You know, it's really a shame he didn't
get juicier stuff last night, you jerk.

1276
01:15:43,432 --> 01:15:45,839
Mia, I have nothing to do with this. I swear.

1277
01:15:45,839 --> 01:15:48,715
Mia, please. Come on.
Will you listen to me?

1278
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:51,285
- That is not my boat.
- Hey, Nicholas? Have a nice life.

But that is my horse. Mia...

Mia? Hello?

1281
01:16:01,996 --> 01:16:03,161
Good morning, my love.

1282
01:16:04,349 --> 01:16:07,277
I know it's a little early,
but I've been thinking.

1283
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,974
Things have been so pressured lately.

1284
01:16:11,271 --> 01:16:13,089
I was wondering
whether we should spend...

1285
01:16:15,369 --> 01:16:16,787
Lilly?

1286
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,745
Good morning, Your Majesty.

01:16:19,099 --> 01:16:21,256

- I just wanted...

1288

- Princess, I think you should see this.

<i>(Elsie) And here's

of boring royals who never misbehaved,</i>

1293

<i>Genovia finally has a world-class scandal.</i>

1294

<i>Proving that we should have
brought in an American long ago.</i>

1295
01:16:44,928 --> 01:16:46,790
<i>Will Andrew Jacoby, Duke of Kenilworth,</i>

1296
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:49,663
<i>still marry such
a naughty, naughty princess?</i>

1297
01:16:49,663 --> 01:16:52,072
<i>Or will Lord Nicholas Devereaux
be the new king?</i>

1300
01:16:58,507 --> 01:17:00,508
I'd like to tell her
what she can do with her eggs...

1301
01:17:00,777 --> 01:17:01,402
Lilly.

1302
01:17:01,402 --> 01:17:03,883
- Could we have a moment alone?
- Yes.

1303
01:17:13,352 --> 01:17:14,102
So?

1304
01:17:19,085 --> 01:17:20,820
I got played.

1305
01:17:23,809 --> 01:17:25,290
A-ha.

1306
01:17:26,743 --> 01:17:29,413
Well, the big question is:

1307
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,155
Do we still have a wedding?

1308
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:36,416
- Andrew, I am so, so sorry.
- Excuse me.

1309
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:39,288
Andrew, please wait.
I promise you nothing happened.

1310
01:17:39,538 --> 01:17:41,446
Yes, but Mia,
you still went, didn't you? You went.

1311
01:17:42,194 --> 01:17:45,570
I don't think you understand. I'm an
extremely eligible bachelor in England.

1312
01:17:45,788 --> 01:17:49,633
I really am. I've got plenty of friends,
lots of lovely women friends, and...

1313
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,635
I still think this marriage is a good idea.

1314
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:56,416
Mia.

1315

<i>(cow moos)</i>

1316
01:18:05,477 --> 01:18:07,562
The queen would not approve of spying.

01:18:08,569 --> 01:18:09,319
Ah.

1318
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:13,697
So?

1319
01:18:14,729 --> 01:18:15,560
Anything?

1320
01:18:16,072 --> 01:18:19,024
I really want to say yes, but no.
There's just, there's no...

1321
01:18:19,947 --> 01:18:20,789
spark.

1322
01:18:22,012 --> 01:18:22,624
Me too.

1323
01:18:23,635 --> 01:18:25,696
- Really?
- Really.

1324
01:18:26,685 --> 01:18:28,479
- I mean, it was pleasurable.
- Very.

1325
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:30,322
- Very pleasant, but, but, but no fireworks.
- None.

1326
01:18:32,423 --> 01:18:34,328
What are we gonna do? Look, we will...

1327
01:18:35,706 --> 01:18:36,706
We will figure something out.

1328
01:18:38,579 --> 01:18:39,579
Mia.

1329
01:18:48,049 --> 01:18:49,988
You chose me.

1330
01:18:56,696 --> 01:18:57,706
No privacy.

1331
01:19:01,832 --> 01:19:03,770
You chose me, and I accepted.

1332
01:19:04,788 --> 01:19:07,020
And a gentleman
never backs out on his word.

1333
01:19:07,548 --> 01:19:08,580
We are going to...

1334
01:19:09,142 --> 01:19:12,989
We're going to stand up in church and say
"I do," and tomorrow we'll be man and wife.

1335
01:19:14,488 --> 01:19:18,174
And you are going to make
an amazing queen of Genovia.

1336
01:19:21,853 --> 01:19:23,143
Thank you.

1337
01:19:37,793 --> 01:19:39,377
I'm getting married today.

1338

<i>(Clarisse) She's getting
married today, Maurice.</i>

1339
01:19:51,376 --> 01:19:53,345
Your Highness, we're running very late.

1340
01:19:53,635 --> 01:19:58,138
Grandma says the queen is never late,
everyone else is simply early.

1341
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:00,357
Your Highness, a strange woman came in

1342
01:20:00,357 --> 01:20:02,233
and said that she wanted
to hide in your closet.

1343
01:20:02,512 --> 01:20:03,439
So I let her.

1344
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:08,202
Well, dear, that probably
wasn't the wisest decision in the...

1345
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:10,858
Now, this is what I call a closet.

1346
01:20:10,858 --> 01:20:13,183
- Mom.
- Oh, my darling.

1347
01:20:14,292 --> 01:20:16,107
- Careful. We're squashing Trevor.
- Hi.

1348
01:20:16,107 --> 01:20:17,535
Hi, Trevor.

1349
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:20,036
He's sleeping. Shh.

1350
01:20:20,331 --> 01:20:24,411
He is the most beautiful baby brother.

1351
01:20:25,422 --> 01:20:28,894
We were joking.
We knew it was your mother.

1352
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:30,392
Your stepfather's here too.

1353
01:20:31,533 --> 01:20:34,579
Now, I'm your mother, it's your
wedding day, I have to say something.

1354
01:20:35,175 --> 01:20:38,953
Being married is about being yourself,
only with someone else.

1355
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:42,378

You got to get out now,
because we have to go to work.

A wedding look for the bride.

That's just the way I feel.
Here we go again.

01:21:44,603 --> 01:21:45,851
Good. Sit up.

1379

I like it.

In a week or two, she'll be yours.

1388
01:22:18,078 --> 01:22:20,962
The game is over, Uncle.
She's going to marry Andrew.

1389
01:22:21,401 --> 01:22:23,149
Ah, you're so right. Ah, well.

1390
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:26,541
This is a disaster in the making.
Wouldn't miss a moment of it.

1391
01:22:27,387 --> 01:22:31,232
I'll try to catch the garter.

1392
01:22:32,428 --> 01:22:34,367
<i>(shouts) The royal carriage approaches.</i>

1393
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:36,899
- What did he say, Artie?
- The princess is coming.

1394
01:22:36,899 --> 01:22:37,920
Showtime.

1395
01:22:40,351 --> 01:22:42,357
Suki Sanchez here from the USA.

1396
01:22:42,679 --> 01:22:45,542
A long way from home,
but happily following a story

1397
01:22:45,542 --> 01:22:47,570
that started in the streets
of San Francisco,

1398
01:22:47,805 --> 01:22:52,013
and is about to have a happy ending here
in the small, beautiful land of Genovia.

1399
01:22:53,327 --> 01:22:55,525
Prepare for the arrival of Princess Mia.

1400
01:23:01,482 --> 01:23:03,295
Psst. Sir.

1401
01:23:04,492 --> 01:23:07,086
I don't mean to talk out of school,
but there's something you must know.

1402
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:13,168
Your uncle called Elsie
and set you up with that video.

1403
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:17,368
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I should have known.

1404
01:23:17,762 --> 01:23:19,204
He's up to something.

1405
01:23:19,204 --> 01:23:22,214
He was much too delighted
that you aren't going to that wedding.

1406
01:23:22,461 --> 01:23:24,431
- I must get to that church.
- Yes, yes, but how?

1407
01:23:24,921 --> 01:23:28,078
Everything on four wheels
is already rented for the wedding.

1408
01:23:28,078 --> 01:23:30,150
- Doesn't matter, I'll run.
- No, no. It's too far.

1409
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:32,872
No, no. You'll take the bike.

1410
01:23:33,668 --> 01:23:35,870
The bike? Gretchen, what bike?
We don't have a bike.

1411
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:36,993
Your grandfather's bike.

1412
01:23:44,277 --> 01:23:49,234
<i>- Buenas tardes, Tanya.
- Buenas tardes, su Majestad.</i>

1413
01:23:49,234 --> 01:23:52,485
<i>Aquí le presento a mi tío,
que nos visita de Rosario.</i>

1414
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:56,275
- Oh, how do you do, señor?
- I do better if you and I get married.

1415
01:23:56,275 --> 01:24:02,765
I'm sorry. My uncle learned his English
watching the old Three Stooges movies.

1416
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,111
Sorry.

1417
01:24:08,462 --> 01:24:09,060
Yes, well...

1418
01:24:12,902 --> 01:24:14,299
You're not going to believe this.

1419
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,206
Lord Devereaux's riding
up the road on a bicycle.

1420
01:24:17,548 --> 01:24:18,549
<i>(Nicholas) Sir!</i>

1421
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:20,517
Sir, may I borrow your horse?

1422
01:24:20,517 --> 01:24:21,809
Oh, he needs my horse.

1423
01:24:22,748 --> 01:24:24,201
<i>(Nicholas) My bike is yours.</i>

1424
01:24:25,183 --> 01:24:28,058
How am I supposed
to herd sheep with a bike?

1425
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:50,684
Outspoken American activist
Lilly Moscovitz, the maid of honor,

1426
01:24:50,684 --> 01:24:53,611
glides forward as a vision in pink.

1427
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,213
I'm a girl who loves black
and is wearing pink.

1428
01:24:58,936 --> 01:25:00,967
<i>(all) Aww.</i>

1429
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:04,078
<i>(Elsie) And Duke Andrew's

affectionately known
as "James of the Cherub Cheeks,"

1431
01:25:07,874 --> 01:25:11,074
comes down the aisle
as the royal ring bearer.

1432
01:25:13,904 --> 01:25:15,404
- Hey, Joe.
- Hm?

1433
01:25:15,832 --> 01:25:18,950
I just wanted to say, before I do this...

1434
01:25:20,045 --> 01:25:22,028
I'm sorry you're retiring.

1435
01:25:23,126 --> 01:25:26,155
- Who told you that?
- The maids know everything.

1436
01:25:29,153 --> 01:25:32,872
Well, the heart does things
for reasons that reason cannot understand.

1437
01:25:34,643 --> 01:25:36,654
You're preaching to the choir.

1438
01:25:37,893 --> 01:25:38,465
<i>(knocks)</i>

1439
01:25:39,074 --> 01:25:41,435
Princess?

1440
01:25:41,657 --> 01:25:42,311
Yes?

1441
01:25:42,965 --> 01:25:47,268
And you should know
that Nicholas did not set you up at the lake.

1442
01:25:49,029 --> 01:25:54,561
- Are you sure?
- The maids know everything.

1443
01:25:56,782 --> 01:25:58,030
We're ready when she is.

1444
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:03,062
<i>(organ music starts)</i>

1445

<i>(music falters and halts)</i>

01:27:00,032 --> 01:27:01,375
- Is this part of the plan?
- No.

1448
01:27:02,675 --> 01:27:03,239
I...

1449
01:27:03,595 --> 01:27:05,592
<i>(clears throat)</i>

1450
01:27:06,242 --> 01:27:08,329
I'm going to need a minute or two.

1451
01:27:10,093 --> 01:27:12,095
Thank you, Your Highness.

1452
01:27:14,932 --> 01:27:18,117
<i>(Elsie) Now the bride is moving
swiftly back up the aisle and out the door.</i>

1453
01:27:18,598 --> 01:27:20,524
<i>- Let me.
- (Elsie) Not the traditional route.</i>

1454
01:27:21,773 --> 01:27:24,555
<i>(woman) Princess Mia!</i>

1455
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:26,526
- Princess Mia!
- Mia!

1456
01:27:30,714 --> 01:27:33,484
- Helen.
- Honey, I'll be right back.

1457
01:27:33,484 --> 01:27:34,994
I gotta change Trevor's diaper.

1458
01:27:35,369 --> 01:27:40,056
Please, be seated. There'll just be
a momentary interlude. Thank you.

1459
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:44,400
- Do we rush after her?
- No, we never rush. We hasten.

1460
01:27:44,651 --> 01:27:47,648
- You'll take care of this?
- Yes, yes. Yes, just one moment.

1461
01:27:47,648 --> 01:27:48,934
<i>(Clarisse) Out of my way.</i>

1462

Oh, my dear. Mia.

1463
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,715
Oh, Grandma, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1464
01:28:03,715 --> 01:28:05,579
- I... I just need a minute.
- No.

1465
01:28:05,579 --> 01:28:06,777
- I can do this.
- No.

1466
01:28:07,266 --> 01:28:08,321
- I can't do this.
- I know.

1467
01:28:08,703 --> 01:28:13,216
Darling, listen to me.

1468
01:28:13,424 --> 01:28:15,387
I made my choice.

1469
01:28:15,981 --> 01:28:19,018
Duty to my country over love.

1470
01:28:19,611 --> 01:28:22,996
It's what I've always done, it seems.
It was drummed into me my whole life.

1471
01:28:23,854 --> 01:28:27,150
Now I've lost
the only man I ever really loved.

1472
01:28:29,775 --> 01:28:32,558
<i>- (radio) Anyone got a 20 on Joseph?
- I'm with the eagle and sparrow.</i>

1473
01:28:33,307 --> 01:28:36,278
Mia, I want you to make
your choices as a woman.

1474
01:28:36,278 --> 01:28:38,276
Don't make the same mistakes I did.

1475
01:28:38,276 --> 01:28:41,025
Make your own mistakes.
There'll be plenty of them, believe me.

1476
01:28:41,248 --> 01:28:44,737
Now, you can go back into that church
and get married, or you can walk away.

1477
01:28:45,175 --> 01:28:46,840
Whatever choice you make,

1478
01:28:47,808 --> 01:28:49,465
let it come from your heart.

1479
01:28:57,684 --> 01:29:00,113
- Excuse me.
- She's back.

1480
01:29:04,122 --> 01:29:06,829
<i>(Elsie) The princess

She's walking down the aisle.

1482
01:29:09,793 --> 01:29:11,466
More like cantering down the aisle.

1483
01:29:12,995 --> 01:29:14,515
<i>(music speeds up)</i>

1484
01:29:22,373 --> 01:29:23,466
Andrew, wait.

1485
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:28,467
Everyone deserves the chance
to find true love, right?

1486
01:29:28,966 --> 01:29:29,527
Yes.

1487
01:29:30,373 --> 01:29:31,644
Including us?

1488
01:29:33,438 --> 01:29:34,638
Thank you.

1489
01:29:40,613 --> 01:29:41,893
For, for, uh...

1490
01:29:42,581 --> 01:29:45,709
saving me from doing
the proper thing for once in my life.

1491
01:29:48,151 --> 01:29:49,998
Now all I have to do is tell Mummy.

1492
01:29:51,373 --> 01:29:52,998
I have to tell everyone else.

1493
01:29:53,925 --> 01:29:54,750
<i>(both) Good luck.</i>

1494
01:30:00,205 --> 01:30:01,832
Helen.

1495
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:08,428
Welcome.

1496
01:30:10,476 --> 01:30:14,740
A few moments ago, I realized
the only reason I was getting married

1497
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:18,146
was because of a law, and that
didn't seem like a good enough reason.

1498
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:19,509
So...

1499
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:22,003
I won't be getting married today.

1500
01:30:23,488 --> 01:30:25,257
Sit. Sit. There may be a dinner.

1501
01:30:28,739 --> 01:30:32,568
My grandmother has ruled without a man
at her side for quite some time, and...

1502
01:30:33,426 --> 01:30:35,106
I think she rocks at it.

1503
01:30:37,144 --> 01:30:40,364
So as the granddaughter
of Queen Clarisse and King Rupert...

1504
01:30:40,364 --> 01:30:43,021
<i>(all) King Rupert. May he rest in peace.</i>

1505
01:30:44,082 --> 01:30:48,037
I ask the members of parliament
to think about your daughters,

1506
01:30:49,449 --> 01:30:53,005
your nieces, and sisters,
and granddaughters,

1507
01:30:53,005 --> 01:30:54,147
and ask yourselves:

1508
01:30:56,273 --> 01:30:59,535
Would you force them to do
what you're trying to make me do?

1509
01:31:03,146 --> 01:31:06,144
I believe I will be a great queen.

1510
01:31:06,849 --> 01:31:10,572
<i>I understand Genovia to be a land
that combines the beauty of the past</i>

1511
01:31:11,357 --> 01:31:13,448
<i>with all the best hope of the future.</i>

1512
01:31:13,448 --> 01:31:14,840
- Not now.
- Shh.

1513
01:31:15,485 --> 01:31:19,528
I feel in my heart and soul
that I can rule Genovia.

1514
01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:21,511
I... I love Genovia.

1515
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,248
Do you think that I would
be up here in a wedding dress if I didn't?

1516
01:31:27,651 --> 01:31:28,651
I stand here,

1517
01:31:29,826 --> 01:31:33,236
ready to take my place as your queen.

1518
01:31:34,433 --> 01:31:37,200
Without a husband.

1519
01:31:37,873 --> 01:31:40,777
<i>(woman) Viva Mia!</i>

1520
01:31:47,029 --> 01:31:48,278
Every time...

1521
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:53,779
Every time this charming
young lady opens her mouth,

1522
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:58,893
she demonstrates a contempt
for the customs of Genovia.

1523
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:05,732
The law clearly states
an unmarried woman cannot be queen.

1524
01:32:06,766 --> 01:32:07,715
Fortunately,

1525
01:32:09,217 --> 01:32:11,575
there is another heir.

1526
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:13,090
No, there is not.

1527
01:32:15,438 --> 01:32:18,079
I decline. I refuse to be king.

1528
01:32:19,825 --> 01:32:23,375
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Princess Mia
who should have the crown.

1529
01:32:24,404 --> 01:32:26,717
She's bright, and she is caring.

1530
01:32:27,356 --> 01:32:29,434
But more importantly, she has a vision.

1531
01:32:30,123 --> 01:32:33,425
One that will take Genovia forward,
and if the parliament were astute,

1532
01:32:34,645 --> 01:32:36,027
they would name her queen.

1533
01:32:36,763 --> 01:32:40,146
Listen to her.
She'll lead us into the 21st century.

1534
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:45,860
And besides, just think how lovely
she'll look on our postage stamp.

1535
01:32:47,835 --> 01:32:50,000
Lovely on a postage stamp?

1536
01:32:50,623 --> 01:32:52,903
You would look lovely on a postage stamp!

1537
01:32:52,903 --> 01:32:56,552
Don't you walk away from me, sir!
You have a duty, sir, to Genovia.

Finally.

We have come together

- She's not getting married.

- She's not getting married?
- No.

Indeed you will.

an audience with Your Highness.

No. No, my kitchen is out of chickens.
