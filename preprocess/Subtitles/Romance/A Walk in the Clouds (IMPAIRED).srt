172
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,666
My stop.

173
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,405
You're waiting
for a ride.

174
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,950
No. No.

175
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,485
A miracle.

176
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,617
He's going to kill me.

177
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,627
Who?

178
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,958
My father.

179
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,863
If you're still worried
about that picture--

180
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,867
It's not about
the picture.

181
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,402
Oh, God.

182
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,732
Look, it's none
of my business,

183
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,867
but if you'd like
to talk about it...

184
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,361
''I was not meant
for the conventions of this world,

185
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,328
''not meant to be
tied down.

186
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,366
I'm a...
free spirit.''

187
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,333
Who's a free spirit?

188
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,597
My professor.

189
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,028
He and I were...

190
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,541
We--We were...

191
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,180
I don't think just because
some free spirit

192
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,340
broke up with you--

193
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,916
I'm pregnant.

194
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,585
Oh.

195
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,692
You're very upset.

196
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,253
I can understand that.

197
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,856
Definitely understand that.

198
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:20,263
But, Victoria,
look at the positive side.

199
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,705
It's a new life
coming into the world.

200
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,367
That's a miracle
in itself, right?

201
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,411
''I will kill anyone
who dishonors my family.''

202
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,414
How many times
has he said that?

203
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,006
A hundred times,
a million times?

204
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,745
I'm sure it's just
a figure of speech.

205
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,254
My father means
what he says.

206
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,914
Always.

207
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,020
He's--He's very
old-fashioned.

208
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,630
If I come home this way
without a husband,

209
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,098
he'll kill me.

210
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,932
I know he will.

211
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,609
How about if you do show up
with a husband?

212
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,118
Who does what,

213
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,385
comes for the day
and then just leaves?

214
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,427
Sure. Comes to meet the family,
stays one night,

215
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,893
leaves in the morning,

216
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,054
writes a letter
saying he's...

217
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,360
Abandoned me.

218
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,430
It happens.

219
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,214
You're very kind
for trying to help me.

220
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,716
Maybe it might work...

221
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,080
but...

222
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,453
there's nobody.

223
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,497
Miss Aragon.

224
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,228
Victoria.

225
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,067
There's me.

226
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,173
Was it horrible,
the fighting?

227
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,211
Once the shooting starts,
you just go blank.

228
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,248
The trick was to get your mind
on something else.

229
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,805
What did you do?

230
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,780
Write letters
to my wife.

231
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,287
In my head.

232
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,325
Then later, I would
write them down.

233
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,689
About the war.

234
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,356
About what I'd like
our life to be like when I got home--

235
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,262
The perfect little house,

236
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,393
kids running around
in the yard with the dog,

237
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,802
great job.

238
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,464
She must have cherished
every word.

239
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,442
Yeah, every word.

240
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,240
You're very kind
to do this for me.

241
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,813
And the baby.

242
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,372
I'm doing it
for the both of you.

243
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:49,818
Then we both thank you.

244
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,480
You're both welcome.

245
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,948
We call it Las Nubes.

246
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,615
It means the clouds.

247
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,821
It's beautiful.

248
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,521
Yeah.

249
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:37,192
Well, if we're going
to do this right...

250
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,807
The wedding bonbon
deluxe.

251
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,911
Big seller
around June.

252
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,042
[Gunshot]

253
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,320
We're unarmed.

254
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,335
Don't shoot.

255
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,997
Hello, Papa.

256
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,599
Victoria.

257
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,536
Who's this?

258
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,672
Paul Sutton...

259
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,047
my husband.

260
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:04,054
Marie!

261
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,316
Marie!

262
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,823
It'll be O.K.

263
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,486
Like hell
it'll be O.K.!

264
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,495
I will not
allow this.

265
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,997
I'll go to the pope
himself

266
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,533
to get this undone.

267
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,659
We weren't married
in a church.

268
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,404
Marie!

269
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,303
¿Qué pasa, Alberto?

270
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,398
Mama.

271
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,035
Victoria!

272
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,171
¿Cuál es
el problema?

273
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,747
Here is the problem.

274
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,976
Is this how
you were brought up?

275
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,211
To betray
your mother?

276
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,719
Betray your father?

277
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,755
I did not betray
anyone.

278
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,723
What are you
talking about?

279
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,225
What do you think
I'm talking about?

280
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,194
The gringo.

281
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,923
His name is Paul.

282
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,328
Mi hijita linda.

283
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,491
Abuelita.

284
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,430
I told you.
I told you!

285
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,338
A girl's place
is here, at home!

286
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,036
Here!

287
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,044
Not alone in some city

288
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,946
doing God knows what.

289
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,711
I'm going to school there.
That's what I'm doing.

290
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,844
What is going on?

291
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,718
Your daughter,
she is married!

292
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,485
Felicidades,
querida.

293
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,547
Mama!

294
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,025
Grandpa,
make him stop.

295
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,026
Please.

296
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:20,394
Ha! That's right.
That's right.

297
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,397
Coddle her.

298
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,457
The whole bunch of you.

299
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,969
But I tell you right now,

300
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:29,973
this will not stand
so long as I draw breath.

301
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,305
I swear before God.

302
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,503
Alberto!

303
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,011
You are so unfair.

304
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,014
Me? Ha ha!
I'm unfair?

305
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,744
I came home
to tell my family

306
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,286
that I spit
on their trust?

307
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,514
I'm the one
who came home

308
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,490
to rub in their face
that I married this--

309
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,186
this...

310
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,786
What do you do?

311
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,387
Chocolate.

312
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,956
I sell chocolate.

313
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,639
No.

314
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,344
You...

315
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,314
You are the head
of the family.

316
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,645
Say something.

317
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,490
I am Pedro Aragon.

318
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,824
Welcome
to our happy family.

319
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,594
Thank you.

320
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,127
May I?

321
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,327
Sure.

322
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,460
Of course.

323
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:41,970
Help yourself.

324
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,820
Huh?

325
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,588
Ugh!

326
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,060
¡Cierra la puerta!

327
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:02,556
It's wonderful!

328
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,603
It's wonderful!

329
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,941
Why can he never just say,

330
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,944
''I'm happy for you.
Congratulations, Victoria''?

331
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,946
Why must everything
be a drama?

332
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,914
It's a bit
of a shock.

333
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,450
Not for Grandma
or Grandpa.

334
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,349
Not for you.

335
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,853
Why is he
always this way?

336
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,355
I hate him!

337
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,390
Victoria!

338
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,891
He is your father.

339
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,393
He has never
taken change well.

340
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,363
Even as a child,
he was this way.

341
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,366
Only with the vines
he has patience.

342
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,403
Maybe he should have
some for us, too.

343
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,406
That would be nice
for a change.

344
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,942
You could have
at least prepared us.

345
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,410
A call, a letter
would have been wiser.

346
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,912
I wanted to surprise you.

347
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,447
Well, you certainly
succeeded.

348
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,382
He wants me to marry
some man in Mexico

349
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,884
I have never even met

350
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,353
just because he has
the right bloodlines.

351
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,821
I'm not a horse, Mama.

352
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:03,350
It's my choice
who I marry, not his.

353
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,328
Muchachas,
la comida.

354
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,366
How many times
have you told me,

355
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,334
''The heart wants
what the heart wants''?

356
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:14,405
And is this what
your heart wants?

357
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:15,370
Yes.

358
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,135
Really and truly?

359
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,304
Really and truly.

360
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:23,142
Everything
will be fine. You'll see.

361
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,478
Everything
will be perfect.

362
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,188
Ooh!

363
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,992
What a delicate ring.

364
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,898
You are beautiful
tonight.

365
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,237
Marriage becomes her,
no?

366
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,773
Mama?

367
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:54,944
Dear God, bless this food
we are about to eat,

368
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:59,416
and bless the harvest
of the grapes you have given us

369
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:03,477
in your wisdom
and grace, amen.

370
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,045
- Amen.
- Amen, amen.

371
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,057
Bon appetit.

372
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,628
This is pumpkin
flower soup.

373
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,255
It's a specialty
of my grandmother's.

374
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,302
It's delicious.

375
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,812
It's been in the family
cookbook

376
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:33,817
before your Declaration
of Independence was signed.

377
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,614
So, with all the commotion,

378
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:43,650
we never heard the whole story
of how you two met.

379
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,064
I was on leave in June.

380
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,294
July.

381
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,893
Just after I moved
to the city.

382
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,471
That's right.July.

383
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,973
At the USO.

384
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,204
I didn't know
you worked at the USO.

385
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,211
Um...

386
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,805
I wasn't actually
working there.

387
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,783
Then what were you doing

388
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:10,343
in a hall filled
with strange men?

389
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,052
Pedro.

390
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,461
Mi abuelo vivió a--

391
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,757
Excuse me.

392
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,929
My grandfather lived
to 1 02,

393
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,003
and he used salt
like a fish in the sea.

394
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:31,008
My great-grandfather
was 1 06!

395
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:39,183
So, tell us, Mr. Sutton,

396
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:44,620
since we now have such a clear picture
of how you two met...

397
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,148
where are you from?

398
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,251
Moline. Moline, Illinois.

399
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,489
Mmm.

400
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,997
Wherever that is.

401
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,262
It's in the middle
of the country.

402
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,131
Exactly in the middle,
right?

403
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:01,796
Right.

404
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,999
And your parents,

405
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,169
they are
still in Moline?

406
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,076
I never knew my parents.

407
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,379
Oh. Who brought you up,

408
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,214
the fairies?

409
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,089
I grew up in a home.

410
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,716
Whose home?

411
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,421
I meant an orphanage.

412
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,987
Wonderful.

413
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,193
This is just wonderful.

414
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,963
My daughter
can trace her ancestors

415
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,470
back 400 years

416
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,474
to some of the finest families
in Mexico,

417
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,806
and you are telling me

418
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,369
she has married a man
with no past?

419
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,914
Or worse...

420
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,746
a man with no past

421
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,945
and no future!

422
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,453
Wonderful.

423
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:53,423
You don't know
that he has no future.

424
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,391
You don't know
anything about him.

425
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,189
Do you?

426
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:01,528
Yes. I know he knows
how to love somebody.

427
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:07,094
I know he wants a house
with kids and a dog.

428
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,797
A great job.

429
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:12,035
You mean,
like the one he has?

430
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,681
Excuse me.

431
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,217
It was very good.

432
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,616
Thank you.

433
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,186
He doesn't pull
any punches, does he?

434
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:58,654
I'm sorry.

435
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,987
You must think
they're horrible.

436
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,757
When I was a kid...

437
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,265
every night I'd climb
up to the roof of the orphanage,

438
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:12,793
and I'd make a wish
on every star I could see.

439
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,838
That's a lot of wishing.

440
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,841
It usually boiled down
to one wish, really.

441
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,308
What was that?

442
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,311
What you have in there.

443
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,812
Everyone always
telling you

444
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,281
how you should
live your life?

445
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,547
Better than having
no one telling you.

446
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,951
I don't know
about that.

447
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,424
I do.

448
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:40,230
That's no reason
for him to treat you that way.

449
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,592
No.

450
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,899
And I was going
to say something, but...

451
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,708
I thought,
''What if it were me?

452
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,176
''A strange man
comes into my house,

453
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,713
''tells me he's married
my only daughter,

454
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,612
and I'm the last to know?''

455
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,378
Probably act the same way.

456
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:01,884
No, you wouldn't.

457
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,645
I don't know
about that.

458
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,121
I do.

459
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:21,460
It's only another
eight hours,

460
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:25,133
I'll be back
on the road.

461
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,809
Anyway, I think
the worst part's over, don't you?

462
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:46,128
This bed
was part of my dowry

463
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,461
when I married
Mr. Aragon.

464
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,524
It was my grandmother's
before that.

465
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,364
Her dowry.

466
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,463
She had it brought
all the way from Paris.

467
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:59,737
He was a diplomat,
my grandfather.

468
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,712
And this is
where we've spent

469
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,112
our first
wedding nights,

470
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,310
my mother...

471
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,080
my grandmother...

472
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,144
and me.

473
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,656
We can sleep
in Pedro's room.

474
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,125
In that teeny-tiny
little bed

475
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,492
on your
wedding night?

476
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:22,124
Ay, hija, no.

477
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,293
You need room...

478
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,699
to maneuver.

479
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,430
Mommy!

480
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,974
I know this is not
your first night together,

481
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,034
but I would like
to think it is.

482
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:38,649
It's just that
from the beginning,

483
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:42,777
all our marriages
have been so blessed.

484
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,688
You know,
it is out of love

485
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,693
that my husband roars so.

486
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,195
We are very traditional
people, Paul,

487
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:57,428
and this modern world
takes a little getting used to.

488
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,132
He'll come around.

489
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,910
Love each other...

490
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,046
always.

491
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:25,290
[Sobbing]

492
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,232
Ha!

493
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,776
First he comes into my house,
steals my daughter.

494
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,778
And now...
Now he takes my bed?

495
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:43,939
No!

496
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:44,913
Vida...

497
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,745
You don't want to see it,

498
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,786
but your daughter
is a woman.

499
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,286
And she was not stolen

500
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,254
any more
than you stole me.

501
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,292
Or have you forgotten
that little room under the stairs

502
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,192
in my father's house, hmm?

503
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,696
I asked for
your hand properly,

504
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,756
with respect.

505
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:06,468

01:34:48,749 --> 01:34:49,875
It's alive!

1352
01:34:49,984 --> 01:34:52,920
Las Nubes lives!

1353
01:34:53,988 --> 01:34:56,479
We can plant!

1354
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:04,022
This...

1355
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:06,531
is the root...

1356
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:08,329
of your life...

1357
01:35:10,771 --> 01:35:12,363
the root...

1358
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,203
of your family.

1359
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:18,943
You are bound
to this land...

1360
01:35:19,013 --> 01:35:20,605
and to this family...

1361
01:35:21,782 --> 01:35:23,773
by commitment...

1362
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:25,079
by honor...

1363
01:35:26,487 --> 01:35:28,421
and by love.

1364
01:35:30,591 --> 01:35:31,888
Plant it.

1365
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,427
It will grow.

1366
01:35:38,332 --> 01:35:40,391
I don't know how.

1367
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:47,373
Victoria.

1368
01:35:47,441 --> 01:35:49,033
Help your husband.

1369
01:36:35,756 --> 01:36:38,054
Beautiful.
