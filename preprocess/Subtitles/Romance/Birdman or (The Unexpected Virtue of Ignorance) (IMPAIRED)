I only knew... heard the man's

I wouldn't know. You'd have
to know the particulars.

54
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,560
But I think what
you're saying is,

00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:50,728
love is absolute,
right? Yeah.

56
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:50,728

you don't try and kill people.

up, too. Poor Ed.

how'd he screw it up

69

in the mouth?

70
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:14,853
He used to carry this .22.

71
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:17,589

Fugitives are on the run.

how many times do we...

76
00:05:22,594 --> 00:05:24,630
Can you just give me
a little more of that?

77
00:05:24,663 --> 00:05:27,232
You know, fear or something?

78
00:05:24,663 --> 00:05:27,232
Yes, great idea.

80

come out from behind a bush,

81
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,472
or-or a car,
and just start shooting.

WOMAN: Christ,
what a nightmare.

85
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:42,147

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,751
"Son of a bitch,
your days are numbered!"

89

I just want to
give you a range.

Yeah.

94

coming out of his ear?

still breathing.

call for help?

That guy's the worst actor
I've ever seen in my life.

The blood coming out of his ear
was the most honest thing

115
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:27,792
he's done so far.

116

in a few hours...

120
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:33,999

00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:36,134
I don't know, I'll think
of something, I'll riff.

Ralph will sue us.

145

Look, you're my attorney.

148
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:25,116

You're my best friend.

149

his billion-dollar
Iron Man franchise

157
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,635
with the equally successful
Avengers series.

158
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:45,838
He will take us
behind the scenes...

159
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,079
(heavy sigh)

160

That clown doesn't have
half your talent,

00:07:57,048 --> 00:08:01,352
and he's making a fortune
in that Tin Man getup.

Riggan.

00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:06,625
(mumbles)
Okay.

165
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:09,127
We had it all.

166
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:09,127
(deep breath)

167
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,129
We gave it away.

168
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:12,664
Breathing in.

169
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:16,267
We handed these poseurs
the keys to the kingdom.

170
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:17,635
Breathing out.

171
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,705
You listening to me?

172
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,705
I smile to it.

173
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:21,606
Breathing in,
I embrace my anger.

174
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,609
(chuckles)
Yeah. Embrace it.

175
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:26,411
But I'm not going away.

176
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:30,115
You know I'm right.

177
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:30,115
(exhales)

178
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:38,090
(exhales)

179
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:50,969
(quietly):
Fuck.

180
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,944
Look at that.

181
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:02,781
These people don't know
what you're capable of.

182
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:12,057
MAN: Why would somebody go
from playing the lead

183
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,361
in a comic book franchise
to adapting Raymond Carver

184
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:18,496
for the stage? I...

185
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,698
You know,
as you're probably aware,

186
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:25,103
Barthes said, "The cultural work
done in the past

187
00:09:25,136 --> 00:09:26,871
"by gods and epic sagas

188
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:29,874
"is now being done
by laundry detergent commercials

189
00:09:29,908 --> 00:09:33,312
and comic strip characters."

190
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:35,480
This is a big leap
you've taken.

191
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:37,582
Yeah, it is.
Absolutely.

192
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:39,250
Absolutely. And...
(clears throat)

193
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:40,919
you know... like you said,

194
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:44,422
that, uh, uh,
Barthes said, uh...

195
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:45,990
See, Birdman, like Icarus...

196
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:48,594
Okay, wait-wait. Hang on.
Who is this Barthes guy?

197
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:51,262
Which Birdman was he in?

198
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:51,262
Uh, Roland Barthes was

199
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:54,065
a French philosopher,
and if you knew anything

200
00:09:54,098 --> 00:09:56,401
about the history...

201
00:09:54,098 --> 00:09:56,401
Sure. Now, is it true

202
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:59,837
you've been injecting yourself
with semen from baby pigs?

203
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:02,540
I-I'm sorry. What?

204
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:02,540
As a method of
facial rejuvenation?

205
00:10:02,574 --> 00:10:04,008
Wh-Where did you read that?

206
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,511
It was tweeted by...
@ProstateWhispers.

207
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:08,880
(laughs): No, that's not true.

208
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:08,880
I know, but did you do it?

209
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:10,982
No, I didn't do it. I just...
I just said it's not true.

210
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:12,717
Okay, I'll just write
you're denying it.

211
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:14,485
No, don't write anything.
Why would you write anything?

212
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,521
I didn't... I didn't do...
Don't write what she said.

213
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:19,024
I didn't do it. I didn't put
any baby pig's sem...

214
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:21,125
MAN: Just, if you will,
are you at all afraid

215
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:23,495
that people will say
you're doing this play

216
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:26,865
to battle the impression that
you're a washed-up superhero?

217
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:28,333
No, absolutely not,
absolutely not.

218
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:32,103
That's why 20 years ago,
I said no to Birdman 4.

219
00:10:32,137 --> 00:10:35,140
Oh...! Birdman 4?!

220
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:37,275
JAKE: Thank you, everybody.

221
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:37,275
You do Birdman 4?

222
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:39,811
Thanks for coming out.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

223
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:41,880
We're expecting
some great pieces.

224
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:42,847
(sighs)

225
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:45,283
Guys in publicity...

226
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:47,385
now want a Times feature,

227
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:50,054
which is the worst idea
right now.

228
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:51,723
(deep breath)

229
00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:55,093
What are you doing?

230
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:56,728
I don't want to look
at this anymore.

231
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,163
That-that was a present
from the crew.

232
00:10:58,196 --> 00:11:00,198
D-Don't fuck with those guys;
they're union.

233
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:01,499
I don't care.

234
00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:03,000
How'd it go?

235
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:04,302
Good.

236
00:11:04,336 --> 00:11:06,571
They talk about Ralph at all?
He did it, you know.

237
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:08,072
The motherfucker did it.
Threatened to sue us.

238
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:09,841
Didn't even wait to get
out of the hospital.

239
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,175
What'd you say?

240
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,175
What did I say?

241
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,744
Shit. Goddamn it.

242
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,744
I said, "You motherfucker,

243
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:14,379
"are you threatening me?

244
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:14,379
Where am I gonna put this?

245
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:16,815
"I swear to God, I so much as
get a letter from a lawyer,

246
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:18,917
then the press is gonna get
the pictures off your computer."

247
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,618
That's what I said.

248
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,618
What pictures?

249
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:23,454
He has a thing
for nuns in diapers.

250
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:24,990
Why do you care?

251
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:26,858
You shouldn't have any
knowledge of that, anyway.

252
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:28,859
The point is, is I
made it go away.

253
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:30,195
That's right.
That's great.

254
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:32,564
Yeah, it is fantastic,
except one thing.

255
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:33,865
What?

256
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:33,865
We don't have an actor.

257
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:35,733
Uh-huh.

258
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:35,733
And if we cancel
the first preview,

259
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:37,302
the press is gonna
smell blood,

260
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:39,604
and we can't afford to lose
any more money at all.

261
00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:41,272
Okay, what do you think
I should do?

262
00:11:41,305 --> 00:11:43,474
Well, we hired an understudy;
let's use the understudy.

263
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:44,876
No.

264
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:44,876
Riggan, listen to me.

265
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:47,278
Please, for the
love of God, listen.

266
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:49,681
Our perfect dream actor is not
gonna knock on that door

267
00:11:49,715 --> 00:11:51,649
and go, "Hey, fellas, when
do I start?" You know?

268
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:53,451
(knocking)

269
00:11:53,484 --> 00:11:55,320
Can I talk to you for a second?

270
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:56,454
Yeah, what's up?

271
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:57,956
Did you find another actor?

272
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:57,956
No.

273
00:11:57,989 --> 00:11:59,757
Okay, well, Mike's available.

274
00:11:57,989 --> 00:11:59,757
He is?

275
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,859
Mm-hmm.

276
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,859
Mike who?

277
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:02,460
I thought he was doing
the thing...

278
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:03,461
He was. He quit.

279
00:12:03,495 --> 00:12:04,729
Or got fired.

280
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:05,997
Mike who?

281
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:05,997
Which is it,
quit or fired?

282
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,399
Well, with Mike,
it's usually both.

283
00:12:07,432 --> 00:12:09,100
Mike fucking who?

284
00:12:07,432 --> 00:12:09,100
Shiner.

285
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:10,235
Yes!

286
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:11,435
Jake.

287
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:11,435
Oh, my gosh.

288
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:12,971
How do you know Mike Shiner?

289
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:14,806
We share a vagina.

290
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:14,806
You think he'd
want to do it?

291
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:16,240
Mm-hmm.

292
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:16,240
How do you know?

293
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:17,809
'Cause he told me
he'd want to do it.

294
00:12:17,842 --> 00:12:18,943
Yes! Yes.

295
00:12:17,842 --> 00:12:18,943
Jake, Jake.

296
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:20,611
Ask me if he sells tickets.

297
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:21,980
Fine, does he sell tickets?

298
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:23,914
He sells a shitload
of tickets.

299
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:23,914
Okay.

300
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:25,483
Now ask me if the
theater critics love him.

301
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:26,584
Do theater critics love him?

302
00:12:26,617 --> 00:12:28,186
They want to
spooge on him.

303
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,187
Hey.

304
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,187
Lesley?

305
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,087
Right on his face.

306
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:31,523
Everything for
a reason, right?

307
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:32,623
You think he'd come in
this evening?

308
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:34,525
I'll call him and find out.

309
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,893
I'll call his agent.

310
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:37,929
(whispering):
Oh, baby. Amazing, amazing.

311
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:47,072
Annie?

312
00:12:47,105 --> 00:12:49,574
Clear the theater,
send everyone to dinner

313
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:51,509
and give me some lights.

314
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,110
We got a put-in tonight.

315
00:12:53,144 --> 00:12:54,312
Who is it?

316
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:56,248
You'll find out.

317
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,428
It's intimidating, isn't it?

318
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:14,532
You have any idea the people
who have walked on these boards

319
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:15,833
before you?

320
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:17,402
Geraldine Page,

321
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:18,803
Helen Hayes,

322
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:19,971
Jason Robards,

323
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:22,039
Marlon Brando and now...

324
00:13:22,073 --> 00:13:23,608
Riggan Thomson.

325
00:13:22,073 --> 00:13:23,608
(chuckling): Yeah.

326
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,843
Hey, thanks for coming in
on such short notice, Mike.

327
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:27,212
I really appreciate it.

328
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:28,146
This is what I do.

329
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:30,081
You-you-you wrote
this adaptation?

330
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:31,415
I did, yeah.

331
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:33,751
Ah, and you're directing
and starring in your adaptation?

332
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,286
I am, yeah.

333
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,286
That's ambitious.

334
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:36,554
Well, thanks.

335
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:38,790
Well, it's a good theater.

336
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:41,626
I can't speak for your play,
but let's, uh,

337
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:42,994
let's do
a little bit of it, yeah?

338
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:44,529
Oh, I didn't expect you
to come in and,

339
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:45,930
you know, just jump right in.

340
00:13:45,963 --> 00:13:47,098
It's first preview
tomorrow night, man.

341
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:48,466
Let's-let's get to work.

342
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:48,466
Okay.

343
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,001
Well, you know, look,
you know,

344
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:52,037
feel free to take the script up
until you feel comfortable.

345
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,439
No, no, no, no, let's just...
let's just do-do some of it.

346
00:13:54,472 --> 00:13:55,873
All right.

347
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:58,676
Okay, uh, hey, take
a look at page 20.

348
00:13:58,709 --> 00:13:59,844
I-I'm good; I don't need that.

349
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:01,312
What?

350
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:01,312
I don't need the script.

351
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:03,147
Just give me a cue.

352
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:03,147
What are you talking about?

353
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:04,749
Feed me a line.

354
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:04,749
Well, how-how...

355
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:06,484
how are you gonna...

356
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:06,484
Feed me a line.

357
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:07,652
Okay, all right.

358
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:09,587
Okay, uh, let me think.

359
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,788
Uh...

360
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:12,123
Yeah, uh...

361
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:13,925
Hey, I'm the wrong
person to ask, okay?

362
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,326
I didn't actually
know the man.

363
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,061
I only heard his name
mentioned in passing.

364
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:18,296
Mm-hmm.

365
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:18,296
I don't know.

366
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:20,031
You'd have to know
the particulars,

367
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:22,566
but I think what you're saying
is love is absolute.

368
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,736
Is that what I'm saying?

369
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:26,270
Am I saying love is absolute?

370
00:14:26,304 --> 00:14:28,540
Yes. Okay, yeah.

371
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:30,775
The kind of love that
I'm talking about is absolute.

372
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:32,477
The kind of love
that I'm talking about...

373
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,478
You don't try to kill people.

374
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:35,880
How do you know the lines?

375
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:37,982
It's a thing I have.

376
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:39,117
I don't know, it's a gift.

377
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,118
Wow, okay, well, that's...

378
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:41,386
(chuckles)
Oh, come on, man.

379
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:42,620
I've been...
I've been helping Lesley

380
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:43,888
get off book for like a month.

381
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:45,257
Oh, right, right.

382
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:45,257
These lines are...

383
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,291
That makes sense.

384
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:47,758
Right, right, right.

385
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:47,758
That's good.

386
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,026
Okay, okay.

387
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,026
Give me my cue again.

388
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,161
Hey, I'm the wrong
person to ask.

389
00:14:50,194 --> 00:14:51,463
I didn't actually
know the man.

390
00:14:51,496 --> 00:14:53,030
I've heard his name
mentioned in passing,

391
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:54,632
but, you know, I didn't know.

392
00:14:54,665 --> 00:14:56,000
You never know the particulars.

393
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:57,501
I think what you're saying,
though, is that...

394
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,770
C-Can I make a suggestion?

395
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:00,205
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

396
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:00,205
I mean, do you mind?

397
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:01,906
No, no, no, not at all.
Not at all.

398
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:01,906
Oh, okay.

399
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,174
Take a look. Okay.

400
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,174
No, no, for-forget that.

401
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:04,776
Just-just...
Stay with me.

402
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:04,776
Yeah.

403
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:06,044
"I'm the wrong person
to ask," he says,

404
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:07,511
Right.

405
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:07,511
but what is that?

406
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:09,214
What's the
intention in that?

407
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:09,214
I think...

408
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:10,949
Is he fed up with the subject,
so he's changing it?

409
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:12,617
Is he deflecting guilt
over the marriage?

410
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,952
And here's the thing, you've got
four lines after that

411
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:16,787
that all say
the same thing.

412
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:16,787
Right.

413
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,089
"I didn't even know the man."

414
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:20,525
"I-I only heard his name
mentioned in passing."

415
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:21,759
"I wouldn't know."

416
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,260
"You'd have to know
the particulars."

417
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:25,563
And the particulars, I mean,
it sounds like my grandmother,

418
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:27,065
but-but-but the point is,

419
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:28,666
you don't know the guy.

420
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:28,666
Right.

421
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:29,800
We fucking get it.

422
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:29,800
Yeah.

423
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:31,302
Make it work with one line.

424
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:32,704
"I didn't even know the man."

425
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:33,905
Right?

426
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:33,905
Yeah, right.

427
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:35,072
(clicks tongue)

428
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:35,072
Wait, how-how do...

429
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:36,774
You know my lines, too, huh?

430
00:15:36,808 --> 00:15:38,442
C-Can we not get hung up
on knowing lines?

431
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:40,077
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

432
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:40,077
Can we just work on this,

433
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:41,646
Yeah, yeah, right, right.

434
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:41,646
tear it apart, whatever?

435
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,248
So-so-so why don't you just
give me that same thing again,

436
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:44,549
but cut it down.

437
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:44,549
Uh-huh.

438
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:45,816
Try it. Just try it.

439
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:45,816
Okay.

440
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,084
Uh... Hey, I'm the wrong
person to ask.

441
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:48,152
I didn't actually know the guy.

442
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:48,152
Oh! No!

443
00:15:48,185 --> 00:15:49,621
But that's the thing, see?

444
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:51,055
"I'm the wrong person to ask."
What is it?

445
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:52,624
I think it's "fuck you."

446
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:54,725
Fuck you. Don't-don't put me
on the spot, man.

447
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,960
I...

448
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,960
Don't-don't make me feel

449
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:57,729
self-conscious about my marriage

450
00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,697
while my l...
my wife is sitting...

451
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,898
Right there.

452
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,898
...right there.

453
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:02,366
Yeah.

454
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:02,366
Can I sit down for this?

455
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,835
Yeah, sit, sit.
Good idea.

456
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,835
Okay. Thanks.

457
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:05,503
Yeah.

458
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:05,503
So-so just-just give it to me

459
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:06,637
as a "fuck you."

460
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:06,637
Right.

461
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:07,672
Try it, lay it on me.

462
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:07,672
Yeah.

463
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,307
Let's just do it. Come on.

464
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,875
Give it to me. Fuck me hard.

465
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,875
Well, I'm thinking. Okay.

466
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:12,510
Just-just give it...

467
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:12,510
Yeah, right.

468
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:14,412
Come on! Don't talk about it!

469
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:14,412
Okay, I'm giving...

470
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:16,180
Just fucking do it!

471
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:16,180
Hey, I'm the wrong
person to ask!

472
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:17,549
All right?
I don't even know the guy, okay?

473
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:18,782
What's your point?

474
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:18,782
What's my point?

475
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:19,917
Yeah, what's your point?

476
00:16:19,951 --> 00:16:21,251
What are you saying?
Spit it out.

477
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:22,787
Oh! Oh!

478
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:22,787
You're saying what?

479
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,789
What are you saying?
You're saying love is absolute.

480
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:26,390
Yes! Yes!

481
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:29,026
The kind of love that I'm
talking about, it is absolute!

482
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,296
The kind of love
that I'm talking about,

483
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:32,597
you don't...

484
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,798
(crying)

485
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:35,734
You don't try to kill people.

486
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:40,805
Yeah. Good.

487
00:16:40,838 --> 00:16:42,339
I don't know,
what do you think, boss?

488
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:44,609
Wow. Okay.

489
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:44,609
You want to do
this with me?

490
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:46,710
What do you think?

491
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:48,212
Everybody's back.

492
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:50,581
Larry needs to see him
for a fitting.

493
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:52,517
I'll take that as a yes.

494
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,954
So who are you?

495
00:16:56,988 --> 00:16:58,523
That's Sam, my daughter.

496
00:16:58,556 --> 00:16:59,890
Oh, your daughter?

497
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:01,158
Wow, that's amazing.

498
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:02,626
You don't look anything
like each other.

499
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,994
What do you do?

500
00:17:04,028 --> 00:17:05,162
Um, I'm his...

501
00:17:04,028 --> 00:17:05,162
She's my assistant.

502
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:06,296
Works for me.

503
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:06,296
Mm-hmm.

504
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,634
And does she talk, uh,
and speak?

505
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,002
She does, yeah.

506
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,002
Mmm.

507
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:12,970
She can even sit or stay

508
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:14,906
or roll over
if you have any treats.

509
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,574
Hey, welcome aboard, Mike!

510
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:17,775
Thank you, Captain.

511
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:18,842
(softly): Yeah.

512
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:21,279
Um, I'm Mike Shiner, by the way.

513
00:17:21,312 --> 00:17:22,713
Oh, I know who you are.

514
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:25,950
I, uh, I saw you in
Hothouse at the Geffen.

515
00:17:25,984 --> 00:17:27,652
You were great.

516
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:28,987
Oh, thank you.

517
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,055
Your ass is great.

518
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:33,124
Dude, seriously?

519
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:35,026
See, you see,

520
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,395
that was just me...

521
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,395
Larry?

522
00:17:37,428 --> 00:17:38,796
Larry?

523
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:39,930
This is the theater,
sweetheart.

524
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:41,132
Don't be so self-conscious.

525
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,433
He's here.

526
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:44,435
Okay, thank the Lord
and pass the biscuits.

527
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:46,203
I finally have
an actor to dress.

528
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:48,138
How have you been, Larry?

529
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:48,138
Better now that you're here.

530
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:49,974
Take off your clothes.

531
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:51,308
See how we do.

532
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:52,810
Okay.

533
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:54,111
You just gonna stand there?

534
00:17:54,145 --> 00:17:55,446
This is the
theater, honey.

535
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,848
Don't be so
self-conscious.

536
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:58,783
We'll have to start
from scratch

537
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:00,951
with less than 24 hours.

538
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:02,352
Here, try these.

539
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:04,288
Holy shi...
What's happening?

540
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:05,389
Where are you underpants?

541
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:07,591
Under the bed at home, I think.

542
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,860
Okay, uh, n-no.

543
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:11,362
O-O-Okay, okay.

544
00:18:11,395 --> 00:18:13,030
Everything's too small.

545
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:14,665
You're not kidding.

546
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:14,665
Oh.

547
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:16,167
Oh, that's nice.

548
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,334
Forgive him, Larry.

549
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:18,502
Mike's like
my five-year-old son.

550
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:20,605
Neither of them has
clean underwear.

551
00:18:20,638 --> 00:18:21,972
Or pubic hair, I imagine.

552
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:24,142
Okay, I can alter the suit,

553
00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:26,444
but we're gonna have to make
new trousers and shirts.

554
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:27,779
And underwear.

555
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:30,515
What are you doing?

556
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:32,449
Waiting on Larry.

557
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:32,449
LARRY: I'm finished!

558
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,519
Then I'm just standing
with my cock out.

559
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:35,520
Well, get dressed.

560
00:18:35,553 --> 00:18:37,188
Riggan's daughter
is hanging around,

561
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:39,223
and I don't need her
to walk in here.

562
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:39,223
Lesley.

563
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:40,724
No, Mike, you haven't seen her.

564
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:42,827
She's always hanging around,
watching everyone.

565
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,262
Like Little Miss Creepy.

566
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,262
Mm-hmm.

567
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:45,896
Les?

568
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:45,896
I don't know if it's the drugs

569
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:47,432
that fried her brain or what,

570
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:49,366
but I just don't want her
running to her father

571
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:50,935
saying you showed her your junk.

572
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:53,571
Then we should ask
her to leave.

573
00:18:53,605 --> 00:18:55,072
Oh, God, really?

574
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:56,240
Mm-hmm. Sammy?

575
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:57,609
SAM:
It's Sam.

576
00:18:57,642 --> 00:18:59,110
Fuck.

577
00:18:57,642 --> 00:18:59,110
Sam. Lesley.

578
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:01,312
Oh, listen, um,
when I said that,

579
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:03,047
I didn't...

580
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:03,047
Don't worry about it.

581
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,916
He's a handful, huh?

582
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,152
How is it that you always manage

583
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:10,187
to find a new way
to humiliate me?

584
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,423
Oh, to be fair,
you make it really easy.

585
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:14,158
What the hell was
she doing here?

586
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,826
She brought me down.

587
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,826
And stayed?

588
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,596
Well, she is
a little... something.

589
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,596
Listen, Mike,

590
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:21,298
this is Broadway,
and I'm here, finally.

591
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:23,467
Now, please, just
do me a favor,

592
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,903
I'm begging you,
don't fuck it up!

593
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:28,739
Lesley.

594
00:19:28,773 --> 00:19:30,674
Come here. Come here.

595
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,143
(exhales)

596
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:35,212
(whispers):
Play with my balls.

597
00:19:35,246 --> 00:19:36,414
(grunting):
Don't do it!

598
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:38,016
MIKE (laughing):
Yeah! Ow!

599
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:39,783
RIGGAN: I don't care,
just sign it.

600
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:39,783
JAKE: Listen to me.

601
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:41,786
No, you listen to me.

602
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:41,786
I can't afford
to listen to you.

603
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:43,221
LARRY: I'm gonna have
to go shopping again!

604
00:19:43,254 --> 00:19:44,221
Just sew something,
you old fuck.

605
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:45,589
Just get him whatever he wants!

606
00:19:45,623 --> 00:19:47,591
His agent's asking
for four times what we were

607
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:49,160
paying what's-his-name.

608
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:49,160
Well, just go into
the reserve, Jake.

609
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:50,794
The reserve is gone--
we spent it on fog

610
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:52,863
and those fake trees and the...

611
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:52,863
It's a dream sequence, Jake.

612
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:54,598
dancing midgets.

613
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:54,598
I've gotta... Don't say...

614
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:56,133
You're not allowed to
say midgets anymore.

615
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,536
The reserve is gone!

616
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,706
You didn't see what I just saw.

617
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,975
I'm telling you,
this guy's the real deal.

618
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:06,610
I could feel it in my bones--

619
00:20:06,643 --> 00:20:08,679
he's the actor
we've been waiting for.

620
00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:11,382
Come on, just get
the contract done. Please, Jake.

621
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:13,384
I'll get the money.

622
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,086
Okay, I'll do it.

623
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,387
Okay.

624
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,022
Get that smile off your face.

625
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:20,491
You're freaking me out.

626
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:20,491
Okay. Sorry. You're right.

627
00:20:20,524 --> 00:20:22,226
(whispers): Hey!
Is it true?

628
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:23,894
Yeah. Yeah, he said yes.

629
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:23,894
Shiner? Holy shit.

630
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:26,564
When can I meet him?

631
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:26,564
He's in a fitting
with Larry right now.

632
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:28,132
LESLEY: Hey, guys.
I'm going to Starbucks.

633
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:29,367
You want anything?

634
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:29,367
I'm good, I'm good.

635
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,868
She has a great ass.

636
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:32,870
Yeah, she does.

637
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:32,870
Hey, I have some
news for you, too.

638
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:35,173
Is it good or is it bad?
'Cause right now I really...

639
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:37,608
I missed my last
two periods.

640
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:40,344
I think it's
really happening.

641
00:20:40,377 --> 00:20:41,879
(exhales)

642
00:20:40,377 --> 00:20:41,879
Well...

643
00:20:41,912 --> 00:20:43,481
Is that good or bad?

644
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:45,783
Riggan!

645
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:45,783
It's good. It's good.
It's great.

646
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:49,920
Well, say something else.

647
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:49,920
Uh, uh... okay...

648
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:51,922
Uh, are you sure
it's mine?

649
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:53,457
(soft chuckle)

650
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:53,457
Well, you know,

651
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:54,758
there's you, there's Jake.

652
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:54,758
I'm joking.

653
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:56,426
You know, that masseur
wore a condom--

654
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,896
yeah, I'm pretty sure
it's yours, yeah.

655
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:01,532
(chuckles):
Idiot.

656
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:03,834
(Riggan panting)

725
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:12,196
had a car wreck

726

I got down to the hospital,

730

this kid, fucking teenager,

731
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:24,809
was dead.

732
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:27,945
So we took the old couple
up to the O.R.,

733
00:23:27,978 --> 00:23:32,716
and we worked like hell on them
through most of the night.

734
00:23:32,749 --> 00:23:35,586
By the time...
we were done with them,

735
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,221
we just, you know,
wrapped them...

736
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:40,458
in their full body casts.

737
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:45,696
The husband, the old man...

738
00:23:45,729 --> 00:23:48,065
was depressed...
for the longest time.

739
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:52,069
Even after I said to him, "Look,
your wife's gonna pull through,"

740
00:23:52,102 --> 00:23:53,771
he was still depressed.

741
00:23:53,804 --> 00:23:57,674
(sighs) So... I went up
to the mouth hole

742
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,411
and I asked him.
(chuckles softly)

743
00:24:00,444 --> 00:24:04,248
And he told me
it was because he couldn't...

744
00:24:04,282 --> 00:24:07,317
see her...
through the eye holes.

745
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:09,487
Couldn't see his wife.

746
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,755

751
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,664

his goddamn head...

00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:22,099

00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:52,856
Just shut up!

821
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,525
Shut up and listen
to me for once!

822
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:56,260
As soon as we announced
he was taking over,

823
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,428
the advance doubled,
and that took less than a day.

824
00:25:58,462 --> 00:25:59,696
We can't afford
to lose a preview,

825
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,265
we can't afford
to lose any more money,

826
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:02,599
and we can't afford
to lose Mike.

827
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:04,301
(panting):
This has been about...

828
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:07,237
this is about being... respected
and validated, remember?

829
00:26:07,271 --> 00:26:09,073
That's what you told me!

830
00:26:09,106 --> 00:26:12,509
That's how you got me
into this shit!

831
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:14,478
You're the director.

832

Hey! Out in front of the theater
in ten minutes!

849

Yeah, what are you...

Sam and I are gonna grab
a bite after she's finished.

851
00:27:14,871 --> 00:27:16,774
No, no, I mean here. Now.

852
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:20,144
Well... I know how much
this means to you.

853
00:27:20,177 --> 00:27:22,112
Oh. Thanks.

854
00:27:22,145 --> 00:27:23,513
I appreciate that.

855
00:27:23,547 --> 00:27:25,315

856

With the play?
You saw what's happening.

857
00:27:25,348 --> 00:27:28,752
No, no. You and Sam.

858
00:27:28,786 --> 00:27:31,655
Oh. It's...
you know, it's great.

859
00:27:31,688 --> 00:27:33,190
It's the same.

860
00:27:33,223 --> 00:27:34,724
Do you talk to her?

861
00:27:34,758 --> 00:27:36,794
Yeah. We talk. I...

862
00:27:36,827 --> 00:27:40,030
You know, it's just been so
crazy around here, you know?

863
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:41,832
You understand
where her head is at

864
00:27:41,865 --> 00:27:43,266
these days.

865
00:27:41,865 --> 00:27:43,266
Yeah. Of course.

866
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,202
You know, she's trying
to stay away from everything

867
00:27:45,235 --> 00:27:47,704
and everyone that got her
into rehab in the first place,

868
00:27:47,738 --> 00:27:49,440
so, you know.

869
00:27:47,738 --> 00:27:49,440
Yeah, yeah. I know.

870
00:27:49,473 --> 00:27:51,208
I really do.
I get it. I get it.

871
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:52,810
But, you know,
that's all she's had,

872
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:54,378
so she's confused.

873
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:54,378
Yeah. I get it.

874
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:56,680
Look, I know you're
caught up in all this stuff,

875
00:27:56,714 --> 00:27:58,015
but you just have to...

876
00:27:56,714 --> 00:27:58,015
"Stuff"?

877
00:27:58,048 --> 00:28:00,017
Uh, uh... you know
what I mean.

878
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:04,354
(sighs) Riggan, you don't have
to be a great father right now.

879
00:28:04,388 --> 00:28:06,957
Y-You just have to be one.

880
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,893
Oh, sorry.

881
00:28:10,828 --> 00:28:12,930
How's that going?

882
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:15,699
I'd rather not talk about that.

883
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:17,568
You drinking?

884
00:28:17,601 --> 00:28:19,302
Yeah, I'm having a beer.

885
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:21,105
Okay.

886
00:28:23,307 --> 00:28:25,843
So...

887
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:27,878

888
00:28:27,911 --> 00:28:30,380
Me? Oh.

889
00:28:27,911 --> 00:28:30,380
Yeah.

890
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:32,449
(chuckles):
Nothing.

891
00:28:32,483 --> 00:28:34,985
Everything's
the same, I guess.

892
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:38,421
I'm going back to teaching.

893
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:39,689
Oh, yeah?

894
00:28:39,723 --> 00:28:41,191
Hey, uh...

895
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:44,695
I'm thinking of refinancing
the Malibu house.

896
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:46,129
What? I'm sorry?

897
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:49,366
I'm thinking of refinancing...

898
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:49,366
No. I heard you.

899
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:51,835
I just need a second.

900
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:54,337
That's gonna be Sam's house.

901
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:55,806
Why would you...

902
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,441
For this play?

903
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:59,777
(exhales)

904
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,312
I need the money.

905
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:04,582
Do you have any idea
how crazy that sounds?

906
00:29:04,615 --> 00:29:07,318
What do you want me to say?
My health lasted

907
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:11,288
longer than the money--
go figure that out.

908
00:29:11,321 --> 00:29:14,224
What's going on?

909
00:29:14,258 --> 00:29:16,794
Riggan, look at me.

910
00:29:16,827 --> 00:29:18,462
(quiet grunt)

911
00:29:21,265 --> 00:29:24,135
I got a chance
to do something right.

912
00:29:26,837 --> 00:29:29,006
I got to take it.

913
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,207
I got to.

914
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,743
You know, it's funny,
I was sitting here

915
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:35,078
waiting for you,
and all of a sudden

916
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:37,948
I couldn't remember
why we broke up.

917
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,189
Hey, you know, the last time
I flew here from L.A....

918
00:29:45,222 --> 00:29:47,458
George Clooney was sitting,
like, two seats in...

919
00:29:47,491 --> 00:29:51,128
in front of me with a nice pair
of cuff links and that...

920
00:29:51,162 --> 00:29:52,462
fucking chin.

921
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:55,532
(exhales) We ended up
flying through this really...

922
00:29:55,565 --> 00:29:57,401
really horrible storm.

923
00:29:57,434 --> 00:30:01,839
I mean, the plane was, like,
rattling, shaking, and, uh...

924
00:30:01,872 --> 00:30:05,475
(clears throat) all the people
on board are... crying.

925
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:06,743
I mean, crying.

926
00:30:06,777 --> 00:30:09,279
Praying, right?

927
00:30:09,312 --> 00:30:10,713
I just sat there.

928
00:30:10,747 --> 00:30:13,350
They're crying; I sit there.

929
00:30:13,383 --> 00:30:17,388
And I'm thinking:
Oh, boy, the next morning

930
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:19,623
when Sam looks at the paper,

931
00:30:19,656 --> 00:30:23,693
it's gonna be Clooney's face
on the front page, not mine.

932
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:25,696
(wry chuckle)
You know? Boom.

933
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:28,565

935

Did you know Farrah Fawcett died

936
00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:37,541
the exact same day
as Michael Jackson?

937
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:39,543
Is that crazy?

938
00:30:51,421 --> 00:30:52,890
(kiss)

939
00:30:54,424 --> 00:30:56,393
Why did we break up?

940
00:30:56,426 --> 00:30:58,963
Because you threw
a kitchen knife at me,

941
00:30:58,996 --> 00:31:00,997
and an hour later
you were telling me

942
00:31:01,031 --> 00:31:03,000
how much you loved me.

943
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:04,801
You know, just
because I didn't like

944
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:06,737
that ridiculous comedy
you did with Goldie Hawn

945
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,339
did not mean that
I did not love you.

946
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:14,244
That's what you always do--
you confuse love for admiration.

947
00:31:14,277 --> 00:31:16,980
It's your house--
you do what you want with it.

948
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:19,582
You just make sure
you're there for our daughter.

We should have done
that reality show

Mike...

986
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:21,578
Bullshit. They...
they don't know you,

the guy from the bird suit

slightly vomitous stories

989

990
00:32:26,216 --> 00:32:28,285
Well, I'm sorry
if I'm popular, Mike.

991
00:32:28,318 --> 00:32:30,354
Popular? I don't give
a shit. Popular?!

992
00:32:30,387 --> 00:32:34,391
Popularity is the slutty little
cousin of prestige, my friend.

Here.

995
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:39,262
Mmm, it-it means...

996
00:32:39,295 --> 00:32:41,832
it means my reputation
is riding on this,

997
00:32:41,865 --> 00:32:43,066
and that's worth a... a...

998

999
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,667

1000
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:45,869
Right. Right.

work out for you,

1005

that cultural genocide

when he invented the circus,

1009
00:32:57,114 --> 00:32:59,182
and nothing much has changed,
and you guys know

1010
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:01,485
that if you crank out
any toxic piece of crap,

1011
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:03,554
people will line up
and pay to see it.

1016
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,495

1019
00:33:14,464 --> 00:33:16,466
No. Tonight was just about

seeing if it can bleed.

in, uh, high school
doing a play in Syracuse,

1093
00:35:35,305 --> 00:35:37,273
and he was in the audience.

1094
00:35:37,306 --> 00:35:38,875
And he, uh...
(clears throat)

1095
00:35:38,908 --> 00:35:41,345

00:38:21,404 --> 00:38:23,006
it's not open
till tomorrow. What?

1145
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,742
Uh... I'm not sure

1146
00:38:25,776 --> 00:38:27,544
that I said thank you.

1147
00:38:27,577 --> 00:38:29,445
For what?

1148
00:38:27,577 --> 00:38:29,445
For everything.

1149
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:31,580
I mean, you've been doing
a really good job,

1150
00:38:31,614 --> 00:38:33,550
and, you know, honestly.

1151
00:38:31,614 --> 00:38:33,550
Yeah.

1152
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:38,054
I've been so
preoccupied with all...

1153
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:38,054
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1154
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:39,856
Okay, well, I...

1155
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:43,060
just wanted to say that, and...

1156
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:43,060
(clears throat)

1157
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:45,662
(panting quietly)

1158
00:38:45,695 --> 00:38:47,530
What is that?

1159
00:38:47,564 --> 00:38:49,565
What?

1160
00:38:47,564 --> 00:38:49,565
That smell.

1161
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,435
What is it? Look at me.

1162
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,435
(mumbles): I don't know.

1163
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:54,037
Look at me!

1164
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:54,037
What? What?

1165
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,938
Goddamn, you got
to be shitting me.

1166
00:38:55,972 --> 00:38:58,041
Dad...

1167
00:38:55,972 --> 00:38:58,041
Where is it?

1168
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:00,910
Can we not do this, please?

1169
00:39:00,943 --> 00:39:02,078
Dad?

1170
00:39:02,112 --> 00:39:04,947
Where is it?
I can't believe this.

1171
00:39:04,981 --> 00:39:07,117
(Sam groans quietly)

1172
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,219
Wha... What is this?

1173
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:11,488
Chunky peanut butter.

1174
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:15,024
This. This.
What is that?

1175
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:15,024
Ah.

1176
00:39:15,058 --> 00:39:16,693
That's pot.

1177
00:39:16,726 --> 00:39:19,095
Relax.

1178
00:39:16,726 --> 00:39:19,095
"Relax." You can't
do this to me!

1179
00:39:19,128 --> 00:39:21,665
To you?

1180
00:39:19,128 --> 00:39:21,665
Oh, shut up! You know
what I'm talking about.

1181
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:23,266
Uh, yeah, you're
talking about you!

1182
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,867
What else is new?

1183
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,867
No, don't do the thing...

1184
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:26,636
The thing where I
make it about me?

1185
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:28,305
Look, I'm trying to do something
that's important.

1186
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:29,372
This is not important!

1187
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:30,740
It's important to me!

1188
00:39:30,774 --> 00:39:33,777
Okay? Maybe not to you
or your cynical friends

1189
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,379
whose only ambition
is to go viral!

1190
00:39:36,412 --> 00:39:38,381
But to me, this is...

1191
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:40,383
my God, this is my career!

1192
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:42,718
This is my chance
to finally do some work

1193
00:39:42,752 --> 00:39:45,688
that actually means something!

1194
00:39:42,752 --> 00:39:45,688
That means something to who?

1195
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:48,992
You had a career, Dad, before
the third comic book movie.

1196
00:39:49,025 --> 00:39:50,493
Before people started to forget

1197
00:39:50,527 --> 00:39:52,395
who was inside
that bird costume!

1198
00:39:52,428 --> 00:39:54,664
You are doing a play
based on a book

1199
00:39:54,697 --> 00:39:56,399
that was written 60 years ago

1200
00:39:56,432 --> 00:39:58,000
for a thousand
rich old white people

1201
00:39:58,034 --> 00:40:00,537
whose only real concern
is gonna be where they go

1202
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,672
to have their cake and coffee
when it's over!

1203
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:04,774
Nobody gives a shit but you!

1204
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:06,943
And... let's face it, Dad,

1205
00:40:06,976 --> 00:40:09,279
you are not doing this
for the sake of art.

1206
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:12,081
You are doing this because
you want to feel relevant again.

1207
00:40:12,114 --> 00:40:14,684
Well, guess what, there is
an entire world out there

1208
00:40:14,718 --> 00:40:17,254
where people fight to be
relevant every single day,

1209
00:40:17,287 --> 00:40:19,088
and you act like
it doesn't exist.

1210
00:40:19,122 --> 00:40:21,758
Things are happening in a place
that you ignore,

1211
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:25,461
a place that, by the way,
has already forgotten about you!

1212
00:40:25,494 --> 00:40:27,730
I mean, who the fuck are you?!

1213
00:40:27,763 --> 00:40:30,233
You hate bloggers,
you mock Twitter.

1214
00:40:30,266 --> 00:40:32,368
You don't even have
a Facebook page!

1215
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:34,037
You're the one
who doesn't exist!

1216
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,673
You're doing this
because you're scared to death,

1217
00:40:36,706 --> 00:40:39,242
like the rest of us,
that you don't matter.

1218
00:40:39,275 --> 00:40:41,044
And you know what?
You're right.

1219
00:40:41,077 --> 00:40:42,312
You don't!

1220
00:40:42,345 --> 00:40:43,813
It's not important, okay?

1221
00:40:43,847 --> 00:40:47,083
You're not important--
get used to it!

1222
00:41:05,702 --> 00:41:07,003
Dad...

1223
00:41:14,477 --> 00:41:16,580
(Sam sighs)

1224
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,101
(lighter clicks)

1225
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:50,514
(exhales heavily)

1226
00:41:55,952 --> 00:41:57,854
(gasps)

1227
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:13,102
LAURA: In the days
before Nick's depression

1228
00:42:13,136 --> 00:42:16,573
started to eat away at him,
he never knew I was pregnant,

1229
00:42:16,606 --> 00:42:19,809
and I never intended
on telling him.

1230
00:42:19,843 --> 00:42:24,414
I guess we make choices in life,
and we choose to live with them.

1231
00:42:24,447 --> 00:42:26,782
Or not.

1232
00:42:26,816 --> 00:42:29,385
I didn't want that baby.

1233
00:42:29,419 --> 00:42:31,254
Not because I didn't love Nick,

1234
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:33,857
and not because I didn't love
the idea of it,

1235
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:38,828
but just because I wasn't ready
to love myself.

1236
00:42:38,861 --> 00:42:41,264
There's a distance
to it all now.

1237
00:42:41,297 --> 00:42:43,433
A wistful distance

1238
00:42:43,466 --> 00:42:45,234
underscored by a gentle breeze

1239
00:42:45,268 --> 00:42:47,804
Actors in position.

1240
00:42:45,268 --> 00:42:47,804
and the sound of the birds

1241
00:42:47,837 --> 00:42:49,973
Music out.

1242
00:42:47,837 --> 00:42:49,973
laughing at the whimsy
of it all.

1243
00:42:50,006 --> 00:42:51,441
We have Laura onstage.

1244
00:42:50,006 --> 00:42:51,441
Lesley?

1245
00:42:51,474 --> 00:42:52,675
Roll it.

1246
00:42:51,474 --> 00:42:52,675
Roll it, go, go.

1247
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:54,344
What?

1248
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:54,344
I think I'm hard.

1249
00:42:54,377 --> 00:42:55,911
No, you're not.

1250
00:42:55,945 --> 00:42:57,446
It's just that sometimes
you don't consider

1251
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,781
other people's feelings,
that's all.

1252
00:42:58,815 --> 00:43:00,717
No, no, no, I'm getting hard.

1253
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,018
Feel that.

1254
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,018
(squeals) What?

1255
00:43:02,051 --> 00:43:03,653
Come on.

1256
00:43:02,051 --> 00:43:03,653
You got to be kidding me.

1257
00:43:03,686 --> 00:43:04,988
Let's really do it;
let's really fuck.

1258
00:43:05,021 --> 00:43:05,955
No, are you crazy?

1259
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:07,890
No, it'll be incredible.

1260
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:07,890
Stop it!

1261
00:43:07,924 --> 00:43:09,725
It'll be so real.
Trust me, trust me.

1262
00:43:07,924 --> 00:43:09,725
Cut it out, Mike.

1263
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:11,094
Trust me, trust me.

1264
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:11,094
Get off!
I'm serious, Mike.

1265
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:13,562
Don't call me Mike;
call me Mel, Mel.

1266
00:43:13,596 --> 00:43:14,997
Get off!

1267
00:43:13,596 --> 00:43:14,997
Okay, just let me...

1268
00:43:13,596 --> 00:43:14,997
(pounding)

1269
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,666
Terri! Terri!

1270
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,666
Mike!

1271
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,666
Don't stop.

1272
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,833
No, Lesley, don't stop.
Kiss me.

1273
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:19,402
No!

1274
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:19,402
Come on, kiss me, kiss me.

1275
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:20,737
Terri, I know
you're in there!

1276
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,505
Get off me! Get off!

1277
00:43:22,538 --> 00:43:23,939
Damn, Terri!

1278
00:43:22,538 --> 00:43:23,939
(groaning)

1279
00:43:23,973 --> 00:43:25,408
Ed?

1280
00:43:23,973 --> 00:43:25,408
Why?

1281
00:43:25,441 --> 00:43:26,809
What are you doing here?

1282
00:43:26,843 --> 00:43:28,044
I just need you
to tell me why.

1283
00:43:28,077 --> 00:43:29,445
Take it easy, all right,
take it easy.

1284
00:43:29,479 --> 00:43:30,647
I know this is hard.

1285
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,348
(audience laughing)

1286
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,348
Shut up! Shut...

1287
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:33,616
Shut up!

1288
00:43:33,649 --> 00:43:34,985
Okay, just don't do
anything stupid.

1289
00:43:35,018 --> 00:43:36,219
I know...

1290
00:43:35,018 --> 00:43:36,219
Hey!

1291
00:43:36,252 --> 00:43:37,920
Eddie, please!

1292
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:39,823
What's the matter with me?

1293
00:43:39,856 --> 00:43:42,959
Why do I always end up having
to beg people to love me?

1294
00:43:42,992 --> 00:43:45,427
Eddie, please, give me the gun.

1295
00:43:45,461 --> 00:43:47,330
Look at me.

1296
00:43:47,364 --> 00:43:48,664
I was drowning.

1297
00:43:48,697 --> 00:43:50,833
I'm just not capable of lo...

1298
00:43:50,867 --> 00:43:54,938
You-you deserve
to be loved, Eddie.

1299
00:43:54,971 --> 00:43:55,939
You do.

1300
00:43:55,972 --> 00:43:58,007
I just wanted to be
what you wanted.

1301
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,444
Now I spend every fucking minute
praying to be somebody else,

1302
00:44:01,478 --> 00:44:03,079
somebody I'm not.

1303
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:04,147
Anybody.

1304
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,416
Okay, j-j-just put
the gun down, Ed.

1305
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:07,817
She just doesn't
love you anymore.

1306
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:10,253
(thunder rumbling)

1307
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:10,253
You don't, do you?

1308
00:44:10,286 --> 00:44:12,388
No.

1309
00:44:12,422 --> 00:44:14,691
And you never will?

1310
00:44:14,724 --> 00:44:16,826
(softly):
I'm sorry.

1311
00:44:18,294 --> 00:44:19,362
(sighs)

1312
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:21,765
I don't exist.

1313
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:25,968
I'm not even here.

1314
00:44:26,002 --> 00:44:28,071
None of this even matters.

1315
00:44:28,104 --> 00:44:31,407
I don't exist. I don't exist.

1316
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,643
Ed?

1317
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,643
No.

1318
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,643
I don't even exist.

1319
00:44:33,676 --> 00:44:35,412
Ed! Eddie, Eddie!

1320
00:44:33,676 --> 00:44:35,412
No, Eddie, no!

1321
00:44:35,445 --> 00:44:36,779
No, no, don't do that!

1322
00:44:35,445 --> 00:44:36,779
(gunshot)

1323
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:38,448
(audience gasping)

1324
00:44:38,481 --> 00:44:40,482
(thunder rumbling)

1325
00:44:40,516 --> 00:44:42,419
(applause)

1326
00:44:44,687 --> 00:44:45,889
LESLEY (sniffles):
You're such an asshole!

1327
00:44:45,922 --> 00:44:47,357
MIKE: An a...
Are you kidding me?

1328
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,024
That's the best I've
seen you onstage ever.

1329
00:44:49,058 --> 00:44:50,859
Why would you do that?
Why would you do that?

1330
00:44:50,893 --> 00:44:52,362
What the fuck?

1331
00:44:50,893 --> 00:44:52,362
We were onstage!

1332
00:44:52,395 --> 00:44:53,763
It's like my head's
a jar of Bolognese.

1333
00:44:53,796 --> 00:44:54,864
Give me the blood rig.

1334
00:44:54,897 --> 00:44:56,399
I'll fix it.

1335
00:44:54,897 --> 00:44:56,399
What is this?

1336
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:58,200
Listen, they're supposed to be
two people who are in love.

1337
00:44:58,234 --> 00:45:00,036
They're fucking in a motel,
having sex with each other.

1338
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:01,604
You've got to be shitting me.
You-you can't get it up

1339
00:45:01,637 --> 00:45:02,772
in six months,
and now you want to fuck me

1340
00:45:02,805 --> 00:45:03,906
in front of 800 strangers?!

1341
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,208
Look, I need it
to feel real, okay?

1342
00:45:05,241 --> 00:45:06,776
I-I need that intensity.
You've known that

1343
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:08,211
about me from
the beginning.

1344
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:08,211
Oh, fuck you!

1345
00:45:08,244 --> 00:45:09,211
Oh.

1346
00:45:09,244 --> 00:45:10,380
Look, I...

1347
00:45:10,413 --> 00:45:12,982
I was in the moment.
I thought that you were, too.

1348
00:45:13,015 --> 00:45:14,584
I'm sorry.

1349
00:45:13,015 --> 00:45:14,584
(applause)

1350
00:45:14,617 --> 00:45:16,719
I told you to stop,
you fucking animal.

1351
00:45:16,752 --> 00:45:19,489
(applause continues)

1352
00:45:16,752 --> 00:45:19,489
You were brilliant.

1353
00:45:19,522 --> 00:45:21,724
Brilliant.

1354
00:45:19,522 --> 00:45:21,724
What is wrong with you?

1355
00:45:21,757 --> 00:45:23,860
(audience shouting, cheering)

1356
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:33,269
(chuckles)

1357
00:45:41,176 --> 00:45:43,078
I want your shit
out of the apartment.

1358
00:45:43,112 --> 00:45:44,080
Wait, what?

1359
00:45:44,113 --> 00:45:45,782
Hey, no, no, no, wait.
Okay, look, look,

1360
00:45:45,815 --> 00:45:47,483
look, look, look,
I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1361
00:45:47,516 --> 00:45:49,285
Can we just...
Look, can we...

1362
00:45:47,516 --> 00:45:49,285
No, we can't, Mike!

1363
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:51,787
You know, maybe up here
you're Mr. Truth,

1364
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,456
but in the real world
where it counts,

1365
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:54,790
you're a fucking fraud!

1366
00:45:54,824 --> 00:45:56,893
How's that feel for truth,
you dick?

1367
00:45:57,927 --> 00:45:59,361
Oh, sorry.

1368
00:45:57,927 --> 00:45:59,361
What's going on?

1369
00:45:59,395 --> 00:46:00,896
He's such an asshole.

1370
00:45:59,395 --> 00:46:00,896
What'd he do now?

1371
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,465
Oh, nothing,
he just tried to fuck me

1372
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:03,766
in front of an entire audience!

1373
00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:04,867
Oh, my God.

1374
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,469
Right?

1375
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,469
That's kind of hot.

1376
00:46:08,638 --> 00:46:10,239
(sniffles, sobs)

1377
00:46:10,272 --> 00:46:11,941
(grunts)

1378
00:46:11,974 --> 00:46:14,610
Why don't I have
any self-respect?!

1379
00:46:14,643 --> 00:46:16,646
Oh, you're an actress, honey.

1380
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:18,782
I'm pathetic.

1381
00:46:21,217 --> 00:46:23,252
Look at me.

1382
00:46:23,285 --> 00:46:25,188
(sniffling)

1383
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:28,191
You know, I...

1384
00:46:28,224 --> 00:46:31,460
I've always dreamed of
being a Broadway actress

1385
00:46:31,494 --> 00:46:33,396
since I was a little kid,

1386
00:46:33,429 --> 00:46:35,731
and now I'm here, and I...

1387
00:46:35,764 --> 00:46:37,533
I'm not a Broadway actress.

1388
00:46:37,566 --> 00:46:40,036
I'm still just a little kid.

1389
00:46:42,605 --> 00:46:46,409
And I keep waiting for someone
to tell me I've made it.

1390
00:46:46,442 --> 00:46:47,810
Hey.

1391
00:46:47,844 --> 00:46:51,147
You made it.

1392
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,015
I did?

1393
00:46:53,048 --> 00:46:56,685
Sadly, it was with Mike Shiner
in a fake motel bed

1394
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:58,287
in front of, like,
800 people, but...

1395
00:46:58,321 --> 00:46:59,488
(laughs)
Oh, shut up!

1396
00:46:59,522 --> 00:47:01,457
(sobbing continues)

1397
00:47:01,491 --> 00:47:03,026
(knocking)

1398
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:04,560
Oh, God.

1399
00:47:04,594 --> 00:47:05,828
RIGGAN:
Hey, is she okay?

1400
00:47:05,861 --> 00:47:07,630
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

1401
00:47:07,663 --> 00:47:09,699
(sighs, sniffles)

1402
00:47:09,732 --> 00:47:13,769
Look, none of this
is your fault, okay?

1403
00:47:13,803 --> 00:47:16,105
Okay, look,
you're beautiful,

1404
00:47:16,138 --> 00:47:21,477
and you're talented,
and I'm lucky I have you.

1405
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:23,679
Okay?

1406
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:23,679
Okay.

1407
00:47:23,713 --> 00:47:24,747
Okay.

1408
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,883
Okay.

1409
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,883
Okay.

1410
00:47:32,521 --> 00:47:34,957
(sighs)

1411
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,059
That was kind of sweet.

1412
00:47:37,093 --> 00:47:38,995
Yeah.

1413
00:47:41,264 --> 00:47:42,732
What's wrong?

1414
00:47:42,765 --> 00:47:44,266
Nothing.

1415
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,036
Two years, and he's never said
anything like that to me.

1416
00:47:49,238 --> 00:47:51,040
Hey.

1417
00:47:51,074 --> 00:47:53,309
You're beautiful,

1418
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,777
and you're talented,

1419
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,846
and I'm lucky to have you.

1420
00:47:56,879 --> 00:47:58,480
Okay?

1421
00:47:58,514 --> 00:47:59,882
We're gross.

1422
00:47:59,915 --> 00:48:02,018
(laughing):
We are.

1423
00:48:06,622 --> 00:48:08,992
(sighs)

1424
00:48:12,395 --> 00:48:13,663
What are you doing?

1425
00:48:13,696 --> 00:48:15,598
Nothing.

1426
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,042
Do it again.

1427
00:48:32,382 --> 00:48:34,884
MIKE: Can we talk about this
like two mature artists?

1428
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:37,252
I mean, what really
is the big deal about...

1429
00:48:37,286 --> 00:48:39,188
Fuck you!

1430
00:48:41,523 --> 00:48:42,925
You're not ready yet.

1431
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:45,228
That's fine.

1432
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:48,932
Hmm.

1433
00:48:49,632 --> 00:48:51,667
Fuck.

1434
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:53,002
Actresses.

1435
00:48:53,035 --> 00:48:56,872
They drive me fucking crazy.

1436
00:48:56,906 --> 00:48:59,675
Riggan? Riggan.

1437
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:02,078
Your gun is ridiculous.

1438
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:04,280
I can see the red plug
in the barrel,

1439
00:49:04,313 --> 00:49:06,783
so you look like a kid
with a plastic toy

1440
00:49:06,816 --> 00:49:08,384
when you point it at me.

1441
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:10,986
I don't feel threatened at all.

1442
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:13,255
Get a better one.

1443
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:15,391
Have some self-respect, please.

1444
00:49:17,459 --> 00:49:20,363
Hey, apart from that,
I mean, uh...

1445
00:49:20,396 --> 00:49:23,832
I thought that was
a pretty fun crowd, huh?

1446
00:49:23,866 --> 00:49:25,969
Yeah, I...

1447
00:49:40,883 --> 00:49:42,585
(pedestrians shouting
indistinctly)

1448
00:49:43,886 --> 00:49:45,688
I don't think it's high enough.

1449
00:49:47,423 --> 00:49:50,692
Me, neither.

1450
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:52,628
What are you doing up here?

1451
00:49:52,662 --> 00:49:55,665
Uh, adrenaline.

1452
00:49:55,698 --> 00:49:57,533
I just got out of rehab.

1453
00:49:57,566 --> 00:49:59,869
It's the closest thing
I get to a drug.

1454
00:49:59,902 --> 00:50:02,205
You went to rehab?

1455
00:50:02,238 --> 00:50:03,672
Yeah.

1456
00:50:03,706 --> 00:50:06,008
Cool.

1457
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:07,976
Yeah, it wasn't all Dr. Drew
or anything,

1458
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,413
but that dude
from American Pie was there.

1459
00:50:10,446 --> 00:50:12,348
Yeah?

1460
00:50:10,446 --> 00:50:12,348
MAN: Jump!

1461
00:50:12,381 --> 00:50:14,016
Eat me!

1462
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,917
Okay, then jump
on my face!

1463
00:50:15,951 --> 00:50:17,453
(chuckles)

1464
00:50:17,486 --> 00:50:18,921
I love this city.

1465
00:50:18,955 --> 00:50:21,057
Yeah?

1466
00:50:23,592 --> 00:50:26,929
Why do you act like a dick
all the time?

1467
00:50:26,962 --> 00:50:28,864
Do you just do it
to antagonize people?

1468
00:50:28,898 --> 00:50:30,866
Maybe.

1469
00:50:30,899 --> 00:50:34,569
You really don't give a shit
if people like you or not?

1470
00:50:34,603 --> 00:50:37,040
Not really.

1471
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:39,975
That's cool.

1472
00:50:40,009 --> 00:50:41,677
Is it? I, uh...

1473
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:43,645
I don't know.

1474
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:46,648
Hey. Hey!

1475
00:50:46,682 --> 00:50:47,916
What?

1476
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:49,185
Let's play a game.

1477
00:50:49,218 --> 00:50:50,686
A game?

1478
00:50:49,218 --> 00:50:50,686
Mm-hmm.

1479
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:51,954
What are you, eight?

1480
00:50:51,987 --> 00:50:53,489
What are you, 78?

1481
00:50:53,523 --> 00:50:54,790
Truth or dare.

1482
00:50:54,823 --> 00:50:55,992
Oh, come on, let's-let's...

1483
00:50:56,025 --> 00:50:57,927
Truth or dare.

1484
00:50:56,025 --> 00:50:57,927
Oh.

1485
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,063
Truth.

1486
00:51:02,498 --> 00:51:06,602
When we first met, you made
a comment about my ass.

1487
00:51:06,635 --> 00:51:09,072
Why'd you do that?

1488
00:51:10,806 --> 00:51:12,508
You have a terrific ass,

1489
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:14,910
and I noticed that.

1490
00:51:14,943 --> 00:51:17,380
And then I just commented on it.

1491
00:51:18,481 --> 00:51:20,315
Truth or dare?

1492
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:21,984
Dare.

1493
00:51:22,017 --> 00:51:23,653
Really?

1494
00:51:22,017 --> 00:51:23,653
Yeah.

1495
00:51:23,686 --> 00:51:25,521
Okay.

1496
00:51:27,122 --> 00:51:29,091
Okay, there's a bald guy,

1497
00:51:29,124 --> 00:51:30,359
he's gonna walk right under you.

1498
00:51:30,392 --> 00:51:32,094
I want you to spit on his head.

1499
00:51:32,128 --> 00:51:33,863
No.

1500
00:51:32,128 --> 00:51:33,863
You said dare.

1501
00:51:33,896 --> 00:51:34,930
Truth.

1502
00:51:34,964 --> 00:51:37,667
No, it's too late, and...

1503
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,635
(scoffs)

1504
00:51:40,669 --> 00:51:41,838
(hocking)

1505
00:51:44,006 --> 00:51:45,808
You happy?

1506
00:51:44,006 --> 00:51:45,808
Yeah.

1507
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:46,976
MAN: Ew!

1508
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:46,976
(chuckles)

1509
00:51:47,009 --> 00:51:49,111
(laughs)

1510
00:51:49,145 --> 00:51:50,746
Truth or dare?

1511
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,981
Truth.

1512
00:51:52,014 --> 00:51:53,181
You're boring.

1513
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:56,385
Mmm, truth is always
interesting.

1514
00:51:56,418 --> 00:51:58,821
Uh...

1515
00:51:58,855 --> 00:52:01,657
do you want to fool around
with me?

1516
00:52:02,758 --> 00:52:04,393
No.

1517
00:52:04,426 --> 00:52:06,028
Really?

1518
00:52:06,061 --> 00:52:08,163
Why not?

1519
00:52:08,197 --> 00:52:09,765
That's a second question.

1520
00:52:09,798 --> 00:52:12,335
It's a second part.

1521
00:52:14,202 --> 00:52:16,906
I'd be afraid
I couldn't get it up.

1522
00:52:20,476 --> 00:52:23,646
That didn't seem
to be a problem for you onstage.

1523
00:52:25,314 --> 00:52:29,285
Well, that's because nothing
is a problem for me onstage.

1524
00:52:31,052 --> 00:52:32,554
I want to ask another question.

1525
00:52:32,587 --> 00:52:34,223
You already asked
another question.

1526
00:52:34,256 --> 00:52:36,359
One more.

1527
00:52:34,256 --> 00:52:36,359
Go ahead.

1528
00:52:38,126 --> 00:52:40,328
If you weren't afraid,

1529
00:52:40,362 --> 00:52:42,598
what would you want
to do to me?

1530
00:52:46,535 --> 00:52:47,636
(sighs)

1531
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,105
I'd pull your eyes
out of your head.

1532
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:52,374
That's sweet.

1533
00:52:52,408 --> 00:52:55,844
I'd put them in my own skull,
and I'd look around

1534
00:52:55,878 --> 00:52:58,280
so I could see this street
the way I used to

1535
00:52:58,313 --> 00:53:00,416
when I was your age.

1536
00:53:12,794 --> 00:53:14,697

About what?

About being
humiliated out there.

He stole your front page.

1571

He's stealing your show.

1572

He thinks you're a joke.

1573

Now two million people
agree with him.

1574

Maybe you are, Riggan.

1575
00:55:21,223 --> 00:55:22,925
Maybe that's what you are.

1576
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:24,860

Back away!

So, Carver's the reason
you became an actor, huh?

1583
00:55:51,553 --> 00:55:52,555
What?

1584
00:55:51,553 --> 00:55:52,555
Listen to me.

1585
00:55:52,588 --> 00:55:53,822
This is my fucking show.

1586
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,924
I did the work,
I raised the money,

1587
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:57,159
I arrange the fucking press.

1588

Oh, Jesus.

1589
00:55:59,261 --> 00:56:01,630
They called me
for an interview.

1590
00:56:01,664 --> 00:56:04,066
I told them the first thing
that came into my head.

1591
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:05,333
Really? Really?

1592
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:05,333
We got the cover

1593
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:06,836
of the Arts section,
for Christ's sake!

1594
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:08,337
You told them the first
thing that came to your...

1595
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:09,905
Fuck the Arts section!

1596
00:56:09,939 --> 00:56:11,506
You told them the first thing
that came to your head?

1597
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:12,841
Right, because that's
you, Mike, right?

1598
00:56:12,874 --> 00:56:14,743
You're Mr. Natural,
Mr. "Fuck the scene,

1599
00:56:14,776 --> 00:56:16,445
just stare at my massive
hard-on," right?

1600
00:56:16,479 --> 00:56:17,512
That's the truth
of the moment.

1601
00:56:17,546 --> 00:56:18,780
Did you think
it looked massive?

1602
00:56:18,813 --> 00:56:20,582
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up!

1603
00:56:20,616 --> 00:56:22,517
You don't get hard on my stage
unless I tell you to.

1604
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:24,019
Your stage?

1605
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:24,019
Yeah.

1606
00:56:24,052 --> 00:56:25,387
Oh, let me tell you something.

1607
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,523
This stage has belonged
to a lot of great actors.

1608
00:56:27,556 --> 00:56:29,725
Really? Really?

1609
00:56:27,556 --> 00:56:29,725
But you are not
one of them, pal.

1610
00:56:29,758 --> 00:56:31,326
So you wrote your
own lines, huh?

1611
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,394
Yeah. Ow! I did, actually.

1612
00:56:32,427 --> 00:56:33,896
Yeah, you wrote a few changes

1613
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:35,764
and you mumbled a little bit,
you self-absorbed prick!

1614
00:56:35,797 --> 00:56:37,399
Hey! I'm self-absorbed?
Look at you.

1615
00:56:37,432 --> 00:56:39,001
Yeah, yeah, you nobody
spiteful piece of shit!

1616
00:56:39,034 --> 00:56:40,368
Nobody?

1617
00:56:39,034 --> 00:56:40,368
Yeah!

1618
00:56:40,402 --> 00:56:42,504
My massive hard-on got
50,000 views on YouTube.

Hey!

1621
00:56:44,172 --> 00:56:45,574
Get the fuck out of here.

1622
00:56:45,608 --> 00:56:47,409
I don't care about any of...

1623
00:56:45,608 --> 00:56:47,409
Yes, you do! You care.

1624
00:56:47,443 --> 00:56:48,510
No, I don't.
I'm a theater actor.

1625
00:56:48,544 --> 00:56:49,578
I don't give a shit.
You care.

1626
00:56:49,611 --> 00:56:50,746
Everybody says,

1627
00:56:49,611 --> 00:56:50,746
Goddamn it.

1628
00:56:50,779 --> 00:56:52,415
"Oh, Mike is so honest.
Mike is so...

1630
00:56:52,448 --> 00:56:53,882
motherfucking truthful!"

1631
00:56:53,915 --> 00:56:55,651
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

1632
00:56:53,915 --> 00:56:55,651
Fuck. Shit!

1633
00:56:55,684 --> 00:56:57,686
You said in the interview your
father was a drunk like Carver.

1634
00:56:57,719 --> 00:56:59,187
Is that true, Mike?

1635
00:56:57,719 --> 00:56:59,187
I'm...

1636
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,422
Is that true?

1637
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,422
No, no.

1638
00:57:00,456 --> 00:57:01,690
What?

1639
00:57:00,456 --> 00:57:01,690
'Cause my father was.

1640
00:57:01,724 --> 00:57:03,325
My father was
a mean fucking drunk.

1641
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,759
You understand?

1642
00:57:04,793 --> 00:57:06,428
Okay.

1643
00:57:04,793 --> 00:57:06,428
He beat the shit out of us.

1644
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:07,696
That was okay, though, you know,

1645
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,164
'cause at least
when he was beating us,

1646
00:57:09,198 --> 00:57:10,732
he wasn't thinking
about taking...

1647
00:57:10,765 --> 00:57:12,467
(crying): taking us
out to his toolshed.

1648
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,836
Because when we got
out to the toolshed,

1649
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,939
that son of a bitch
would smile and get...

1650
00:57:16,972 --> 00:57:18,674
say, "You want to get
down on your knees

1651
00:57:18,707 --> 00:57:20,075
"and unbuckle my belt?

1652
00:57:18,707 --> 00:57:20,075
Oh, Jesus.

1653
00:57:20,109 --> 00:57:22,845
Or do you want me to take it off
and use it on you?"

1654
00:57:22,878 --> 00:57:25,113
After a while, I made
myself numb, so, you know...

1655
00:57:25,146 --> 00:57:26,215
(crying continues):
But my...

1656
00:57:26,248 --> 00:57:27,749
My little sister...

1657
00:57:27,782 --> 00:57:28,951
(sobbing)

1658
00:57:28,984 --> 00:57:31,086
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1659
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,988
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1660
00:57:33,021 --> 00:57:35,858
Hey. Oh, God, I...

1661
00:57:35,891 --> 00:57:38,127
Uh, I didn't know.
I'm-I'm sorry.

1662
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,163
I'm sorry, that-that is,
that's fucking horrible, man.

1663
00:57:41,196 --> 00:57:43,231
Yeah, yeah.

1664
00:57:41,196 --> 00:57:43,231
I'm sorry.

1665
00:57:43,265 --> 00:57:45,233
It's also not true.

1666
00:57:45,266 --> 00:57:46,501
See, I can pretend, too, you...

1667
00:57:46,534 --> 00:57:48,270
Oh! Whoa.

1668
00:57:46,534 --> 00:57:48,270
Don't fuck with me, Mike!

1669
00:57:48,303 --> 00:57:49,672
I'm telling you.

1670
00:57:48,303 --> 00:57:49,672
You're-you're a
little bit crazy.

1671
00:57:49,705 --> 00:57:50,873
You have no fucking...

1672
00:57:49,705 --> 00:57:50,873
You know what?

1673
00:57:50,906 --> 00:57:52,241
You should start
using that onstage.

1674
00:57:52,274 --> 00:57:53,408
Yeah? Yeah?
You have no fucking idea.

1675
00:57:53,442 --> 00:57:54,576
So, "Working
with Riggan Thomson's

1676
00:57:54,609 --> 00:57:55,744
like waltzing with a monkey"?

1677
00:57:55,777 --> 00:57:57,212
Huh?

1678
00:57:55,777 --> 00:57:57,212
I might have said that.

1679
00:57:57,246 --> 00:57:58,313
Yeah, you...
Come on!

1680
00:57:58,346 --> 00:57:59,448
Let's go. Come on.

1681
00:57:59,481 --> 00:58:00,749
Yeah?

1682
00:57:59,481 --> 00:58:00,749
Yeah. Come on.

1683
00:58:00,782 --> 00:58:02,317
Yeah, why don't you
get your wings

1684
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:03,586
and your fucking bird suit, man?

1685
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:05,020
Oh.

1686
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:05,020
(grunts)

1687
00:58:05,054 --> 00:58:06,322
Ow!

1688
00:58:06,355 --> 00:58:07,722
Hey!

1689
00:58:06,355 --> 00:58:07,722
(grunting)

1690
00:58:07,756 --> 00:58:09,158
Don't think
you can try to fake...

1691
00:58:09,191 --> 00:58:10,359
Come on.

1692
00:58:09,191 --> 00:58:10,359
Don't try to fake me.

1693
00:58:10,392 --> 00:58:12,227
No!

1694
00:58:10,392 --> 00:58:12,227
Ow!

1695
00:58:12,261 --> 00:58:14,697
(grunting)

1696
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,699
I'm gonna crab up on your
ass and choke you out!

1697
00:58:16,732 --> 00:58:18,500
Don't you...

1698
00:58:16,732 --> 00:58:18,500
I'm gonna fucking
choke you out!

1699
00:58:18,533 --> 00:58:20,202
Get off me!
What are you looking at?

1700
00:58:20,235 --> 00:58:21,236
What are you gonna do?!

1701
00:58:21,269 --> 00:58:22,671
You gonna replace me?

1702
00:58:22,705 --> 00:58:24,440
You gonna go get fucking
Ryan Gosling or some shit?

1703
00:58:24,473 --> 00:58:26,308
What do you think my friend,

1704
00:58:26,341 --> 00:58:27,709
Tabitha, is gonna do
to you in the Times,

1705
00:58:27,742 --> 00:58:29,845
you fucking dilettante!

1706
00:58:49,164 --> 00:58:51,800
You are lame, Riggan,

1707
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:55,637
rolling around
with that poncy theater fuck

1708
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:58,439
in an 800-seat shithole
like this?

1709
00:58:58,473 --> 00:59:00,576
(panting)

1710
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:08,117
Oh, you really fucked up
this time.

1711
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:09,451
You destroy a genius book

1712
00:59:09,484 --> 00:59:10,652
with that infantile
adaptation.

1713
00:59:10,686 --> 00:59:12,521
Breathing in,
I control my rage.

1714
00:59:12,554 --> 00:59:14,890
Now you're about to destroy
what's left of your career.

1715
00:59:14,924 --> 00:59:17,159
Breathing out, I embrace
these mental foundations.

1716
00:59:17,192 --> 00:59:19,361
It's pathetic.

1717
00:59:19,394 --> 00:59:20,962
Breathing in, I am calm.

1718
00:59:20,996 --> 00:59:23,031
Let's get the hell out
of here while we can.

1719
00:59:23,065 --> 00:59:25,734
Breathing out,
I ignore this mental formation.

1720
00:59:25,767 --> 00:59:27,569
This is a mental formation.

1721
00:59:27,602 --> 00:59:28,804
Stop that shit!

1722
00:59:28,837 --> 00:59:29,971
This is just
a mental formation...

1723
00:59:30,005 --> 00:59:31,573
I'm not a mental formation.

1724
00:59:31,606 --> 00:59:33,541
...from the past.

1725
00:59:31,606 --> 00:59:33,541
I'm you, asshole.

1726
00:59:33,575 --> 00:59:35,444
Leave me alone.

1727
00:59:35,477 --> 00:59:37,713
You were a movie star,
remember?

1728
00:59:37,746 --> 00:59:39,581
Pretentious but happy.

1729
00:59:39,615 --> 00:59:42,050
I wasn't happy.

1730
00:59:39,615 --> 00:59:42,050
Ignorant but charming.

1731
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:44,819
Now you're just a tiny,
bitter cocksucker.

1732
00:59:44,853 --> 00:59:48,190
I was fucking miserable.
I was fucking miserable.

1733
00:59:48,223 --> 00:59:49,658
Yeah, but fake miserable.

1734
00:59:49,691 --> 00:59:51,327
Hollywood miserable.

1735
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,328
What are you
trying to prove?!

1736
00:59:53,362 --> 00:59:54,495
That you're an artist?

1737
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:55,830
(moans)

1738
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:55,830
Well, you're not.

1739
00:59:55,863 --> 00:59:58,199
Fuck you!

1740
00:59:55,863 --> 00:59:58,199
No, fuck you!

1741
00:59:58,233 --> 00:59:59,601
You coward.

1742
00:59:59,634 --> 01:00:01,470
We grossed billions.

1743
01:00:01,503 --> 01:00:03,271
What are you,
ashamed of that?

1744
01:00:03,305 --> 01:00:05,873
Billions!

1745
01:00:03,305 --> 01:00:05,873
And billions of flies
eat shit every day!

1746
01:00:05,907 --> 01:00:07,876
So what?
Does that make it good?

1747
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:10,011
(panting)

1748
01:00:10,045 --> 01:00:12,848
I don't know if you noticed,
but that was 1992!

1749
01:00:12,881 --> 01:00:14,816
You could jump right back
into that suit

1750
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,418
if you wanted to.
We're not dead.

1751
01:00:16,451 --> 01:00:17,753
Look at me.

1752
01:00:17,786 --> 01:00:19,287
Will you look?
Look, look at this! Look!

1753
01:00:19,321 --> 01:00:21,957
Look, look! I look like
a turkey with leukemia!

1754
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:25,093
I'm fucking disappearing.

1755
01:00:25,127 --> 01:00:26,194
(panting)

1756
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:27,830
This is what's left.

1757
01:00:27,863 --> 01:00:30,399
I'm the answer to a fucking
Trivial Pursuit question!

1758
01:00:30,432 --> 01:00:31,934
You're an imposter here.

1759
01:00:31,967 --> 01:00:34,369
Eventually, they're gonna
figure you out.

1760
01:00:34,403 --> 01:00:36,204
What part of this don't you get?

1761
01:00:36,237 --> 01:00:37,639
You're dead. Please...

1762
01:00:37,673 --> 01:00:39,574
We are not dead.

1763
01:00:37,673 --> 01:00:39,574
Oh, please.

1764
01:00:39,608 --> 01:00:40,775
Just stay dead.

1765
01:00:40,809 --> 01:00:42,377
Just stay dead.

1766
01:00:40,809 --> 01:00:42,377
We are not dead.

1767
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:43,979
Stop saying "we"!

1768
01:00:44,013 --> 01:00:44,847
There is no we.

1769
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,781
I'm not fucking you!

1770
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:49,051
I'm Riggan fucking Thomson.

1771
01:00:49,084 --> 01:00:50,585
No.

1772
01:00:50,618 --> 01:00:52,754
You're Birdman.

1773
01:00:52,788 --> 01:00:57,392
Because without me,
all that's left is you,

1774
01:00:57,425 --> 01:00:59,928
a sad, selfish,
mediocre actor

1775
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:02,430
grasping at
the last vestiges

1776
01:01:02,464 --> 01:01:04,366
of his career.

1777
01:01:09,571 --> 01:01:11,373
What the hell
did you do that for?

1778
01:01:11,406 --> 01:01:13,041
I like that poster.

1779
01:01:13,075 --> 01:01:16,444
(chuckles)
It's always "we," brother.

1780
01:01:16,477 --> 01:01:17,813
Fuck you!

1781
01:01:17,846 --> 01:01:19,714
Shut the fuck up!

1782
01:01:19,748 --> 01:01:21,850
Leave me alone!

1783
01:01:29,324 --> 01:01:30,692
You're fucking...

1784
01:01:30,725 --> 01:01:32,561
so fucking annoying!

1785
01:01:32,594 --> 01:01:34,463
Shut up!

1786
01:01:39,468 --> 01:01:41,303
(panting)

1787
01:01:41,336 --> 01:01:42,603
Hey. What's up?

1788
01:01:42,637 --> 01:01:44,105
Um, well,

1789
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:46,574
one hour till curtain.

1790
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:46,574
Yeah, cool.

1791
01:01:46,608 --> 01:01:48,210
Why don't you try to
rest a little bit?

1792
01:01:48,243 --> 01:01:50,412
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna lay down.

1793
01:01:50,445 --> 01:01:51,546
Almost there, buddy.

1794
01:01:51,579 --> 01:01:52,981
Last preview.

1795
01:01:51,579 --> 01:01:52,981
Okay, okay, cool.

1796
01:01:53,014 --> 01:01:54,850
How you doing?

1797

I got a play to do!

2129
01:15:16,817 --> 01:15:18,720
No, excuse me, sir...

2130
01:15:16,817 --> 01:15:18,720
You can't go in there.

2131

No, I got...

to tell me why!

I know this is hard.

beg people to love me?!

01:16:10,471 --> 01:16:13,041
Now I spend every fucking...

day trying to be somebody else,
somebody I'm not!

2156

I'm just not capable
of that kind of...

(ringtone playing)

Okay, Mr. Roth, please

Well, I mean,

2195
01:18:07,955 --> 01:18:10,458
previews were pretty much
a train wreck.

2196
01:18:10,491 --> 01:18:13,094
We can't seem to get
through a performance without...

2197
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:16,596
a raging fire
or a raging hard-on.

2198
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:18,199
I'm broke.

2199
01:18:18,232 --> 01:18:21,369
I'm not sleeping, like,
you know, at all.

2200
01:18:21,402 --> 01:18:23,937
And, uh, this play

2201
01:18:23,971 --> 01:18:26,641
is kind of starting
to feel like

2202
01:18:26,674 --> 01:18:30,277
a miniature,
deformed version of myself

2203
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:32,980
that just keeps
following me around and, like,

2204
01:18:33,013 --> 01:18:37,418
hitting me in the balls with
a... like, a tiny little hammer.

2205
01:18:39,586 --> 01:18:41,455
I'm sorry,
what was the question?

2206
01:18:41,488 --> 01:18:42,823
Never mind.

2207
01:18:42,856 --> 01:18:45,126
Tonight wasn't bad.

2208
01:18:45,159 --> 01:18:46,259
I know.

2209
01:18:46,293 --> 01:18:48,496
It was... it was weird,
but it was kind of cool.

2210
01:18:48,529 --> 01:18:50,731
Yeah, really? You think?

2211
01:18:48,529 --> 01:18:50,731
Yeah, I think people liked it.

2212
01:18:50,764 --> 01:18:52,132
Yeah, well...

2213
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:53,567
What are you doing,
by the way?

2214
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,802
Homework?

2215
01:18:54,835 --> 01:18:56,370
No, I don't...

No, um, my, uh...

2217
01:18:57,904 --> 01:18:59,874
When I was in rehab,
they made us do this.

2218
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:01,208
Really? What is it?

2219
01:19:01,241 --> 01:19:04,111
It's, um...
these dashes represent

2220
01:19:04,145 --> 01:19:06,447
the six billion years
that the Earth has been around.

2221
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,881
Yeah?

2222
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,881
And so each dash

2223
01:19:07,915 --> 01:19:09,283
represents a thousand years.

2224
01:19:09,317 --> 01:19:12,018
And, um, this is...

2225
01:19:12,052 --> 01:19:14,354
how long humans have been here.

2226
01:19:14,388 --> 01:19:16,757
150,000 years.

2227
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:19,293
I think they're
trying to remind us

2228
01:19:19,326 --> 01:19:22,897
that that's all our ego
and self-obsession are worth.

2229
01:19:27,134 --> 01:19:29,504
I was a shitty father,
wasn't I?

2230
01:19:31,272 --> 01:19:34,341
No, you were...

2231
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:36,109
You were fine.

2232
01:19:36,143 --> 01:19:37,511
Yeah.

2233
01:19:37,544 --> 01:19:39,113
That's right, I was...

2234
01:19:39,147 --> 01:19:41,181
I was just fine.

2235
01:19:41,215 --> 01:19:43,083
Um...

2236
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:45,318
I can't...

2237
01:19:45,352 --> 01:19:47,054
Dad?

2238
01:19:45,352 --> 01:19:47,054
What?

2239
01:19:47,088 --> 01:19:48,856
Oh, shoot. Oh, I'm sorry.

2240
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:50,758
That's... you just wiped out
the entire human race.

2241
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:52,393
I know. (chuckles)

I don't care.

2289
01:21:26,887 --> 01:21:29,422
Okay, I was just...

2290
01:21:29,456 --> 01:21:31,192
(stammering)

2291
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:32,926
You know, before you
come tomorrow, I just...

2292
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,361
It doesn't matter.

2293
01:21:34,394 --> 01:21:36,497
Okay.

2294
01:21:36,530 --> 01:21:38,198
(sighs)

2295
01:21:38,232 --> 01:21:40,767
I'm going to destroy your play.

2296
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,969
But you didn't even see it.

2297
01:21:43,003 --> 01:21:45,306
Um, you know, did I do something
to offend you?

2298
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:47,174
I-I'm so sorry...

2299
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:47,174
As a matter
of fact, you did.

2300
01:21:47,207 --> 01:21:49,076
You took up space in a theater
which otherwise

2301
01:21:49,109 --> 01:21:51,579
might have been used
on something worthwhile.

2302
01:21:51,612 --> 01:21:54,081
Okay, well,

2303
01:21:54,115 --> 01:21:56,716
I mean, you don't even know
if it's any good or not.

2304
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,185
I didn't...

2305
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,185
That's true.

2306
01:21:58,218 --> 01:22:01,255
I haven't read a word of it
or even seen a preview,

2307
01:22:01,288 --> 01:22:03,090
but after the opening tomorrow,

2308
01:22:03,123 --> 01:22:05,126
I'm going to turn in
the worst review

2309
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:06,927
anybody has ever read,

2310
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,930
and I'm going
to close your play.

2311
01:22:09,963 --> 01:22:12,566
Would you like to know why?

2312
01:22:12,599 --> 01:22:14,668
Yeah.

2313
01:22:12,599 --> 01:22:14,668
Because I hate you

2314
01:22:14,701 --> 01:22:16,336
and everyone you represent.

2315
01:22:16,369 --> 01:22:21,074
Entitled, selfish,
spoiled children.

2316
01:22:21,107 --> 01:22:24,178
Blissfully untrained, unversed

2317
01:22:24,211 --> 01:22:27,214
and unprepared
to even attempt real art.

2318
01:22:27,247 --> 01:22:31,218
Handing each other awards
for cartoons and pornography.

2319
01:22:31,252 --> 01:22:34,120
Measuring your worth
in weekends?

2320
01:22:34,154 --> 01:22:36,724
Well, this is the theater,

2321
01:22:36,757 --> 01:22:38,359
and you don't get
to come in here

2322
01:22:38,392 --> 01:22:40,727
and pretend you can write,
direct and act

2323
01:22:40,761 --> 01:22:42,195
in your own propaganda piece

2324
01:22:42,228 --> 01:22:43,964
without coming through me first.

2325
01:22:43,997 --> 01:22:45,966
Uh-huh.

2326
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,368
So break a leg.

2327
01:22:47,401 --> 01:22:49,436
(scoffs)

2328
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:51,505
Wow. You know,
what has to happen

2329
01:22:51,538 --> 01:22:55,075
in a person's life for them
to become a critic, anyway?

2330
01:22:55,108 --> 01:22:57,544
What are you writing,
another review?

2331
01:22:57,578 --> 01:22:59,580
Um, is it any good?

2332
01:22:59,613 --> 01:23:00,614
Is it?

2333
01:23:00,648 --> 01:23:01,915
Is it bad?

2334
01:23:01,949 --> 01:23:03,684
Did you even see this?
Let me read it.

2335
01:23:03,717 --> 01:23:05,452
I will call the police.

2336
01:23:05,485 --> 01:23:07,521
You won't call the police.
Let's read your fucking review.

2337
01:23:07,555 --> 01:23:09,056
"Callow." Callow is a label.

2338
01:23:09,089 --> 01:23:11,659
Just, uh, "lackluster."

2339
01:23:11,692 --> 01:23:12,959
That's just a label.

2340
01:23:12,993 --> 01:23:14,194
"Margin..."

2341
01:23:14,227 --> 01:23:15,729
Marginalia? Are you kidding me?

2342
01:23:15,762 --> 01:23:18,332
(scoffs) It sounds like you need
penicillin to clear that up.

2343
01:23:18,365 --> 01:23:20,734
That's a label, too.
These are just all labels.

2344
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:22,002
You just label everything.

2345
01:23:22,035 --> 01:23:23,837
That's so fucking lazy.

2346
01:23:23,871 --> 01:23:26,774
You just...
You're a lazy fucker.

2347
01:23:26,807 --> 01:23:28,208
You're a lazy...

2348
01:23:28,242 --> 01:23:29,710
You know what this is?

2349
01:23:29,743 --> 01:23:31,778
Do you even know what that is?

2350
01:23:31,811 --> 01:23:33,647
You don't. You know why?

2351
01:23:33,681 --> 01:23:36,149
Because you can't see this thing

2352
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:37,951
if you don't know
how to label it.

2353
01:23:37,985 --> 01:23:39,920
You mistake all those
little noises in your head

2354
01:23:39,953 --> 01:23:42,189
for true knowledge.

2355
01:23:42,222 --> 01:23:43,924
Are you finished?

2356
01:23:42,222 --> 01:23:43,924
No, I'm not finished.

2357
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:45,192
There's nothing in here
about technique.

2358
01:23:45,226 --> 01:23:47,027
There's nothing
in here about structure.

2359
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,362
Nothing in here about intention.

2360
01:23:48,395 --> 01:23:50,531
It's just a bunch
of crappy opinions

2361
01:23:50,564 --> 01:23:53,433
backed up
by even crappier comparisons.

2362
01:23:53,467 --> 01:23:55,869
You write a couple
of paragraphs,

2363
01:23:55,902 --> 01:23:57,671
and you know what,
none of this

2364
01:23:57,705 --> 01:23:59,573
costs you fucking anything.

2365
01:23:59,606 --> 01:24:02,075
You risk nothing.

2366
01:24:02,108 --> 01:24:03,743
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

2367
01:24:03,777 --> 01:24:06,547
Well, I'm a fucking actor.

2368
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:09,617

2369

This play cost me everything.

01:24:13,153 --> 01:24:14,855
So I'll tell you what.

2371
01:24:14,888 --> 01:24:17,057
You take this fucking...

2372

You're no actor.

2379

You're a celebrity.

2380
01:24:35,376 --> 01:24:37,478
Let's be clear on that.

2381
01:24:42,983 --> 01:24:45,486
I'm gonna kill your play.

2382

and you blew them both.

2453
01:28:51,565 --> 01:28:53,934
Good for you. Fuck it.

2454
01:28:53,967 --> 01:28:55,269
We'll make a comeback.

2455
01:28:55,302 --> 01:28:57,170
They're waiting
for something huge.

2456
01:28:57,203 --> 01:28:58,405
We'll give it to them.

2457
01:28:58,438 --> 01:29:00,240
Shave off that pathetic goatee.

2458
01:29:00,273 --> 01:29:01,574
Get some surgery.

2459
01:29:01,607 --> 01:29:03,977
60 is the new 30, motherfucker.

2460
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:05,879
You are the original, man.

2461
01:29:05,913 --> 01:29:08,214
You paved the way for all
these other little clowns.

2462
01:29:08,247 --> 01:29:09,616
Give the people what they want.

2463
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:12,218
Some good, old-fashioned,
apocalyptic porn.

2464
01:29:12,251 --> 01:29:14,254
Birdman: The Phoenix Rises.

2465
01:29:14,287 --> 01:29:16,690
Pimple-faced gamers creaming
in their pants.

2466
01:29:16,723 --> 01:29:19,125
A billion worldwide, guaranteed.

2467
01:29:19,158 --> 01:29:21,528
You were larger than life, man.

2468
01:29:21,561 --> 01:29:24,564
You saved people from
their boring, miserable lives.

2469
01:29:24,598 --> 01:29:28,368
You make them jump, laugh,
shit their pants.

2470
01:29:28,401 --> 01:29:30,404
All you have to do is...

2471
01:29:34,741 --> 01:29:35,942
(screaming)

2472
01:29:35,976 --> 01:29:37,878
Man down! Man down!

2473
01:29:40,647 --> 01:29:43,183
That's what I'm talking about!

2474
01:29:43,217 --> 01:29:44,384
Bones rattling!

2475
01:29:44,418 --> 01:29:46,486
Big, loud, fast.

2476
01:29:46,519 --> 01:29:48,087
Look at these people.

2477
01:29:48,121 --> 01:29:49,255
Look at their eyes.

2478
01:29:49,289 --> 01:29:50,457
They're all sparkling.

2479
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:52,392
They love this shit;
they love blood.

2480
01:29:52,425 --> 01:29:56,263
They love action,
not this talky, depressing,

2481
01:29:56,296 --> 01:29:58,599
philosophical bullshit.

2482
01:30:00,166 --> 01:30:02,069
(bellowing)

2483
01:30:06,106 --> 01:30:07,808
Yes.

2484
01:30:07,841 --> 01:30:10,310
And the next time
you screech...

2485
01:30:10,343 --> 01:30:12,078
(screeches)

2486
01:30:12,112 --> 01:30:15,816
...it'll explode
into millions of eardrums.

2487
01:30:15,849 --> 01:30:18,284
You'll glimmer
on thousands of screens

2488
01:30:18,318 --> 01:30:20,187
around the globe.

2489
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:21,688
Another blockbuster.

2490
01:30:21,721 --> 01:30:23,457
MAN: Hey, that guy's rising
into the air.

2491
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:24,791
You are a god.

2492
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:24,791
Up there!

2493
01:30:24,824 --> 01:30:26,693
Hey, who is that?

2494
01:30:24,824 --> 01:30:26,693
Hey, you all right?

2495
01:30:26,726 --> 01:30:28,962
See? There you go,
you motherfucker.

2496
01:30:28,996 --> 01:30:30,530
WOMAN: Oh, look,
there's a man up there!

2497
01:30:30,564 --> 01:30:31,798
Gravity doesn't
even apply to you.

2498
01:30:31,832 --> 01:30:33,400
MAN: What's he doing?
Jesus, what... Oh!

2499
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:34,935
Wait till you see
the faces of those

2500
01:30:34,968 --> 01:30:36,503
who thought
we were finished.

2501
01:30:36,536 --> 01:30:38,071
Listen to me.

2502
01:30:38,105 --> 01:30:40,140
Let's go back one more time
and show them

2503
01:30:40,173 --> 01:30:41,541
what we're capable of.

2504
01:30:41,574 --> 01:30:43,510
We have to end it
on our own terms,

2505
01:30:43,543 --> 01:30:45,779
with a grand gesture.

2506
01:30:45,812 --> 01:30:47,581
Flames.

2507
01:30:47,614 --> 01:30:49,315
Sacrifice.

2508
01:30:47,614 --> 01:30:49,315
Oh, my God! There's
somebody up there!

2509
01:30:49,349 --> 01:30:51,084
Icarus.

2510
01:30:49,349 --> 01:30:51,084
Oh, my God!

2511
01:30:51,118 --> 01:30:52,952
You can do it.

2512
01:30:52,986 --> 01:30:55,355
You hear me?

2513
01:30:55,388 --> 01:30:57,458
You are...

2514
01:30:55,388 --> 01:30:57,458
MAN: Birdman!

2515
01:31:00,627 --> 01:31:02,329
(indistinct shouting)

2516
01:31:02,362 --> 01:31:04,430
WOMAN:
Hey, is this for real,

2517
01:31:04,464 --> 01:31:07,334
or are you shooting a film?

2518
01:31:07,367 --> 01:31:09,469
A film!

2519
01:31:09,503 --> 01:31:13,607
You people are full of shit!

2520
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,576
MAN: Hey, man,
can I help you?

2521
01:31:16,609 --> 01:31:18,578
You should be careful.

2522
01:31:18,611 --> 01:31:19,946
Sorry, can't talk.

2523
01:31:19,979 --> 01:31:21,748
I'm late.

2524
01:31:21,781 --> 01:31:23,082
Music.

2525
01:31:23,116 --> 01:31:25,185
(orchestra playing)

2526
01:31:25,219 --> 01:31:26,519
(music stops)

2527
01:31:26,553 --> 01:31:28,655
You okay, man?

2528
01:31:30,891 --> 01:31:34,494
You want me to call
somebody for you?

2529
01:31:34,527 --> 01:31:36,630
Do you know where to go?

2530
01:31:40,701 --> 01:31:42,435
Yeah.

2531
01:31:42,468 --> 01:31:44,705
I know where to go.

2532
01:31:44,738 --> 01:31:46,239
Oh, hey!

2533
01:31:46,272 --> 01:31:48,175
No, wait! What the...

2534
01:31:54,347 --> 01:31:56,250
(Riggan laughing)

2535
01:31:58,285 --> 01:31:59,519
Oh!

2536
01:31:59,553 --> 01:32:01,722
(chuckling):
Oh!

2537
01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:05,792
(laughing continues)

2538
01:32:12,432 --> 01:32:14,535
Whoa!

2539
01:32:18,171 --> 01:32:20,240
(sighs)

2540
01:32:26,213 --> 01:32:28,081
(wind whistling)

2541
01:32:29,616 --> 01:32:31,585
You see?

2542
01:32:31,618 --> 01:32:34,021
This is where you belong.

2543
01:32:38,425 --> 01:32:39,893
Above them all.

2544
01:32:39,927 --> 01:32:41,295

01:33:21,501 --> 01:33:23,604
♪ ♪

2549
01:33:32,746 --> 01:33:34,214
WOMAN:
How long you in town for?

2550
01:33:34,247 --> 01:33:35,415
WOMAN 2:
Oh, about two weeks.

2551

Oh, really?
You'll get to see a lot.

2552
01:33:42,389 --> 01:33:43,956
Stop the music.

2553
01:33:42,389 --> 01:33:43,956
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2554

I beg your pardon.

2555

Hello, sir?

Hello, sir,

What are you doing?

2559
01:33:48,761 --> 01:33:50,396
Where you going? Hey.

2560
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:51,798
Hey, are you deaf, idiot?

2561
01:33:51,831 --> 01:33:53,200
This guy didn't pay me, man.

2562
01:33:53,233 --> 01:33:54,500
That fucker is crazy.

Yeah, sure, yeah.

2569
01:34:21,795 --> 01:34:23,797
You said 15 blocks, right?

2570
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:25,231
Yes.

2571
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:25,231
Three alternates!

2572
01:34:25,264 --> 01:34:28,935
That's it, four teams.

2573
01:34:28,968 --> 01:34:31,571
Not a bad first act, huh?

2574
01:34:28,968 --> 01:34:31,571
Not bad at all.

2575
01:34:31,604 --> 01:34:33,239
It's going really well.

2576
01:34:33,273 --> 01:34:35,008
I didn't think Hollywood
could do Broadway.

2577
01:34:35,041 --> 01:34:36,742
I never would have
expected it from him.

2578
01:34:36,776 --> 01:34:38,378
If the second act is half
as good as that...

2579
01:34:38,412 --> 01:34:40,080
It's pretty glorious. See?

2580
01:34:38,412 --> 01:34:40,080
The whole evening

2581
01:34:40,113 --> 01:34:41,548
has been fabulous.

2582
01:34:40,113 --> 01:34:41,548
Right, right?
What we talk about

2583
01:34:41,581 --> 01:34:43,183
when we talk
about Riggan Thomson?

2584
01:34:43,216 --> 01:34:44,550
It's fantastic, really.

2585
01:34:43,216 --> 01:34:44,550
How long's the intermission?

2586
01:34:44,584 --> 01:34:46,153
Birdman can act!

(crowd chattering)

2588
01:35:03,636 --> 01:35:05,638
Oh, wow.

2589
01:35:05,672 --> 01:35:07,974
I just came to say hello.

2590
01:35:08,007 --> 01:35:10,077
It's going great out there.

2591
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:10,877
You're so good.

2592
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:12,145
I mean it. You're...

2593
01:35:12,178 --> 01:35:13,980
Thanks. Come sit.

2594
01:35:12,178 --> 01:35:13,980
I really mean it.

2595
01:35:14,013 --> 01:35:15,548
ANNIE (over intercom): Places
for the final scene, Riggan.

2596
01:35:15,581 --> 01:35:16,917
Places for the final scene.

2597
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:18,751
You need to...

2598
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:18,751
No, no, no. It's fine.

2599
01:35:18,785 --> 01:35:20,220
Just sit here for a second.

2600
01:35:20,253 --> 01:35:21,854
Look at all these roses.

2601
01:35:21,888 --> 01:35:24,056
I hate roses.

2602
01:35:21,888 --> 01:35:24,056
And you hate roses.

2603
01:35:24,090 --> 01:35:25,725
(chuckles)

2604
01:35:25,759 --> 01:35:27,494
Are you okay?

2605
01:35:27,527 --> 01:35:29,062
You seem...

2606
01:35:29,095 --> 01:35:32,632
You seem, I don't know,
you seem abnormally calm.

2607
01:35:32,665 --> 01:35:34,701
(chuckles)

2608
01:35:34,734 --> 01:35:36,602
I am calm.

2609
01:35:36,636 --> 01:35:39,039
Yeah, I'm great, actually.

2610
01:35:40,773 --> 01:35:43,877
You know, I got this...

2611
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:46,879
little voice
that talks to me sometimes.

2612
01:35:46,913 --> 01:35:48,815
Tells me the truth.

2613
01:35:48,848 --> 01:35:50,883
It's comforting.

2614
01:35:50,917 --> 01:35:52,885
Kind of scary,
but it's comforting.

2615
01:35:52,919 --> 01:35:54,654
I'm gonna pretend

2616
01:35:54,687 --> 01:35:56,489
I didn't hear
you say that.

2617
01:35:54,687 --> 01:35:56,489
Okay.

2618
01:35:56,523 --> 01:35:57,824
(chuckles)

2619
01:35:57,857 --> 01:35:59,225
You wouldn't believe
the crowd outside.

2620
01:35:59,259 --> 01:36:02,963
They said some people paid
up to $500 a ticket.

2621
01:36:02,996 --> 01:36:05,097
Really?

2622
01:36:05,131 --> 01:36:06,899
Hey.

2623
01:36:06,932 --> 01:36:09,502
Can I tell you something funny?

2624
01:36:09,535 --> 01:36:11,071
Sure.

2625
01:36:11,104 --> 01:36:13,239
You remember
our last anniversary party?

2626
01:36:13,272 --> 01:36:15,374
Seriously? You're gonna ruin
a nice moment with that?

2627
01:36:15,408 --> 01:36:17,310
Yeah, all right,
but do you remember the party?

2628
01:36:17,343 --> 01:36:19,178
The party where you fucked
Janet Rossbach in our bed?

2629
01:36:19,212 --> 01:36:20,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
try to skip over that part

2630
01:36:20,914 --> 01:36:22,315
for a minute, yeah.

2631
01:36:20,914 --> 01:36:22,315
Oh, gladly.

2632
01:36:22,348 --> 01:36:24,784
And you threw all the guests
out of the house?

2633
01:36:24,818 --> 01:36:27,187
And you threw all the furniture
out the window?

2634
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:28,988
I remember.

2635
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:28,988
And you locked yourself

2636
01:36:29,022 --> 01:36:30,957
in the bathroom.

2637
01:36:29,022 --> 01:36:30,957
Riggan, why are
we talking about...

2638
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:33,660
I drove out to Malibu,

2639
01:36:33,693 --> 01:36:37,763
and I just sat on
the beach for a while

2640
01:36:37,797 --> 01:36:38,998
looking out at the ocean.

2641
01:36:39,032 --> 01:36:41,333
Riggan?

2642
01:36:39,032 --> 01:36:41,333
And I...

2643
01:36:41,367 --> 01:36:42,569
walked...

2644
01:36:42,602 --> 01:36:44,938
straight into the water.

2645
01:36:48,808 --> 01:36:51,211
And I tried to drown myself.

2646
01:36:56,115 --> 01:36:58,718
I was up to my chest
when I felt the first one

2647
01:36:58,751 --> 01:36:59,952
on my back.

2648
01:36:59,985 --> 01:37:01,621
It was like somebody was holding

2649
01:37:01,654 --> 01:37:03,656
a frying pan against me,
really burning,

2650
01:37:03,689 --> 01:37:05,825
and then they were on my chest

2651
01:37:05,858 --> 01:37:07,894
and all over my legs.

2652
01:37:07,927 --> 01:37:10,163
The water was full of jellyfish.

2653
01:37:10,196 --> 01:37:12,432
(laughs)

2654
01:37:12,465 --> 01:37:14,234
They were all over me.

2655
01:37:14,267 --> 01:37:16,736
I-I had to fight my way
out of the water.

2656
01:37:16,769 --> 01:37:18,972
I went up to the-the beach.

2657
01:37:19,005 --> 01:37:22,976
I was rolling around
like a maniac in the sand,

2658
01:37:23,009 --> 01:37:25,978
(laughs):
crying.

2659
01:37:26,012 --> 01:37:28,748
You said it was a sunburn.

2660
01:37:28,782 --> 01:37:30,850
Yeah, I know.

2661
01:37:30,883 --> 01:37:32,686
And you believed me.

2662
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:35,255
To be honest,
I didn't give a shit.

2663
01:37:41,328 --> 01:37:43,229
(whispering):
Man.

2664
01:37:43,262 --> 01:37:45,165
I love you.

2665
01:37:48,268 --> 01:37:49,669
And I love Sam.

2666
01:37:49,702 --> 01:37:51,605
I know.

2667
01:37:54,507 --> 01:37:57,343
I really wish I wouldn't have
videotaped her birth, though.

2668
01:37:57,376 --> 01:37:58,878
Why?

2669
01:37:58,911 --> 01:38:00,179
'Cause it... (sighs)

2670
01:38:00,213 --> 01:38:02,816
I just missed the moment,
really.

2671
01:38:02,849 --> 01:38:04,417
Don't have it. I...

2672
01:38:04,450 --> 01:38:07,219
I should've just been there
with the two of you.

2673
01:38:07,253 --> 01:38:08,988
You know?

2674
01:38:09,021 --> 01:38:11,258
Just... the three of us.

2675
01:38:14,427 --> 01:38:16,228
But I wasn't.

2676
01:38:16,262 --> 01:38:18,097
I wasn't even present
in my own life,

2677
01:38:18,131 --> 01:38:21,268
and now I don't have it,
and I'm never gonna have it.

2678
01:38:21,301 --> 01:38:22,902
No, you have Sam.

2679
01:38:22,936 --> 01:38:24,271
Not really, I don't.

2680
01:38:24,304 --> 01:38:25,471
I mean, she's...

2681
01:38:25,504 --> 01:38:27,173
No, no, no, listen.
She's just going through...

2682
01:38:27,206 --> 01:38:28,875
No, no, no, I get it.
I understand.

2683
01:38:28,908 --> 01:38:30,877
Yeah, no, she needed
to have a dad and...

2684
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:33,647
instead she got this guy

2685
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:37,216
who was a three-day
viral sensation.

2686
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:38,685
It is so pathetic, I can't...

2687
01:38:38,718 --> 01:38:41,154
No, come on, there are more
pathetic things than that.

2688
01:38:41,187 --> 01:38:42,789
Yeah, like?

2689
01:38:41,187 --> 01:38:42,789
That mustache.

Last scene has started.

2693
01:38:52,699 --> 01:38:54,134
You're not here.

2694
01:38:54,167 --> 01:38:55,835
Last chance for places.

2695
01:38:55,869 --> 01:38:58,338

He's alive; my best
friend is alive!

2783
01:44:38,844 --> 01:44:42,548
And... he happens to be
the fucking man of the hour.

2784
01:44:42,581 --> 01:44:45,585
RIGGAN: What is that?

2785
01:44:42,581 --> 01:44:45,585
You have to be shitting me.

2786
01:44:45,618 --> 01:44:46,486
Read it.

2787
01:44:46,519 --> 01:44:47,619
I don't believe this.

2788
01:44:47,653 --> 01:44:50,189
"The Unexpected Virtue
of Ignorance."

2789
01:44:50,223 --> 01:44:51,491
Read it.

2790
01:44:50,223 --> 01:44:51,491
Oh.

2791
01:44:51,524 --> 01:44:54,360
"By Tabitha Dickinson."

2792
01:44:51,524 --> 01:44:54,360
Read it out loud.

2793
01:44:54,394 --> 01:44:56,829
"Thomson has
unwittingly given birth

2794
01:44:56,863 --> 01:44:59,699
"to a new form which can
only be described

2795
01:44:59,732 --> 01:45:01,500
"as super-realism.

2796
01:45:01,534 --> 01:45:04,436
"Blood was spilled both
literally and metaphorically

2797
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:07,306
"by artist and audience alike,
real blood.

2798
01:45:07,339 --> 01:45:09,775
"The blood that has been
sorely missing

2799
01:45:09,808 --> 01:45:12,277
from the veins
of the American theater."

2800
01:45:12,311 --> 01:45:14,180
(sighs)

2801
01:45:12,311 --> 01:45:14,180
(chuckles)

2802
01:45:14,213 --> 01:45:16,081
You're happy about this?

2803
01:45:16,115 --> 01:45:17,082
Yeah, happy?

2804
01:45:17,115 --> 01:45:18,350
I'm fucking euphoric!

2805
01:45:18,383 --> 01:45:20,252
This is... this is
the kind of review

2806
01:45:20,285 --> 01:45:21,554
that turns people
into living legends.

2807
01:45:21,587 --> 01:45:23,156
He shot the nose off his face!

2808
01:45:23,189 --> 01:45:24,790
He's got a new nose!

2809
01:45:24,823 --> 01:45:27,459
And if he doesn't like that one,
we'll get him a new one.

2810
01:45:27,492 --> 01:45:29,161
We'll use Meg Ryan's guy.

2811
01:45:29,194 --> 01:45:30,596
Who gives a shit?

2812
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:32,465
They're lighting candles
for him in Central Park.

2813
01:45:32,498 --> 01:45:34,400
Turn on your TV. Where's the...

2814
01:45:35,734 --> 01:45:37,437
...spontaneous vigil
for actor Riggan Thomson.

2815
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:39,806
They're praying for him
all across the country.

2816
01:45:39,839 --> 01:45:41,540
He did it. You did it.

2817
01:45:41,573 --> 01:45:43,342
I've been reborn, brother.

2818
01:45:43,376 --> 01:45:45,344
And I can see the future.

2819
01:45:45,377 --> 01:45:47,279
This play is gonna last forever.

2820
01:45:47,312 --> 01:45:49,448
It's gonna open
in London and Paris,

2821
01:45:49,482 --> 01:45:50,983
and the studio
is gonna call again,

2822
01:45:51,016 --> 01:45:53,085
and we're gonna get some
book deals-- you'll see.

2823
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:54,320
So you can see the future?

2824
01:45:54,353 --> 01:45:56,322
Yeah, I can see the future.

2825
01:45:56,355 --> 01:45:58,157
How about that, huh?

2826
01:45:58,190 --> 01:46:00,159
Did you see that coming?

2827
01:46:00,192 --> 01:46:02,628
Why aren't you saying anything?

2828
01:46:02,661 --> 01:46:05,364
This is what you
wanted, wasn't it?

2829
01:46:05,397 --> 01:46:07,500
Riggan, this is
what you wanted.

2830
01:46:09,401 --> 01:46:12,572
Yeah, yeah,
this is what I wanted.

2831
01:46:12,605 --> 01:46:14,840
Okay, listen,
you're gonna get hit

2832
01:46:14,873 --> 01:46:18,243
with a brandishing
a weapon charge, okay?

2833
01:46:18,277 --> 01:46:19,645
If anybody talks
to you about it,

2834
01:46:19,678 --> 01:46:21,280
it was an accident.

2835
01:46:19,678 --> 01:46:21,280
(softly): Okay.

2836
01:46:21,313 --> 01:46:23,249
Is that what this was?

2837
01:46:23,282 --> 01:46:24,584
An accident?

2838
01:46:24,617 --> 01:46:26,152
An accident.
That's what I want to go...

2839
01:46:26,185 --> 01:46:27,586
(door opens)

2840
01:46:26,185 --> 01:46:27,586
Did you intend to
shoot yourself?

2841
01:46:27,619 --> 01:46:28,954
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2842
01:46:27,619 --> 01:46:28,954
You motherfuckers!

2843
01:46:28,988 --> 01:46:30,622
Get the fuck out! Get out!

2844
01:46:28,988 --> 01:46:30,622
This is a hospital!

2845
01:46:30,656 --> 01:46:32,124
Are you coming back...

2846
01:46:30,656 --> 01:46:32,124
Get the fuck out of here!

2847
01:46:32,157 --> 01:46:33,392
Move!

2848
01:46:32,157 --> 01:46:33,392
This is a hospital!

2849
01:46:33,425 --> 01:46:34,660
Get the fuck out!

2850
01:46:33,425 --> 01:46:34,660
Ma'am, get back!

2851
01:46:34,694 --> 01:46:37,396
Get the fuck out, you assholes!

2852
01:46:34,694 --> 01:46:37,396
Get back!

2853
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:38,998
Okay, out!

2854
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:38,998
(elevator bell dings)

2855
01:46:39,031 --> 01:46:40,533
This is a personal matter!

2856
01:46:40,566 --> 01:46:41,934
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

2857
01:46:40,566 --> 01:46:41,934
A personal matter!

2858
01:46:41,968 --> 01:46:43,735
Hey, hey, get out!

2859
01:46:41,968 --> 01:46:43,735
I don't give a shit!

2860
01:46:43,769 --> 01:46:46,105
Hey, Sam! What did it feel like
the night your father tried....

2861
01:46:46,138 --> 01:46:48,674
I don't give a shit
if the press wants to know.

2862
01:46:48,708 --> 01:46:51,210
Get the fuck out of here,
you fucking parasite!

2863
01:46:51,244 --> 01:46:52,879
(shouting continues)

2864
01:47:01,554 --> 01:47:03,623
(machine beeps)

2865
01:47:16,669 --> 01:47:18,571
Lilacs.

2866
01:47:24,176 --> 01:47:26,045
(chuckles)

2867
01:47:26,078 --> 01:47:27,579
Are you laughing?

2868
01:47:27,613 --> 01:47:29,715
Yeah.

2869
01:47:27,613 --> 01:47:29,715
What's so funny?

2870
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:33,352
I can't smell them.

2871
01:47:33,386 --> 01:47:35,320
(laughs wryly)

2872
01:47:35,353 --> 01:47:37,457
(snorting)

2873
01:47:39,224 --> 01:47:40,625
What are you doing?

2874
01:47:40,659 --> 01:47:42,461
I'm posting a photo
on your Twitter page.

2875
01:47:42,495 --> 01:47:43,629
I have a Twitter page?

2876
01:47:43,662 --> 01:47:46,065
Yeah, I set it up today.

2877
01:47:46,098 --> 01:47:48,000
Let me see.

2878
01:47:46,098 --> 01:47:48,000
No way.

2879
01:47:48,033 --> 01:47:49,268
No, you look hideous.

2880
01:47:49,301 --> 01:47:50,936
Oh, wow, thank you.

2881
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:51,937
I appreciate it.

2882
01:47:51,971 --> 01:47:53,105
I'm just kidding.

2883
01:47:53,138 --> 01:47:54,206
No, I'm actually not.

2884
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:55,774
You-you do look hideous.

2885
01:47:55,807 --> 01:47:56,975
(chuckles)

2886
01:47:57,008 --> 01:47:59,412
You got 80,000 followers
in less than a day.

2887
01:47:59,445 --> 01:48:00,913
Really?

2888
01:48:00,946 --> 01:48:03,382
Yeah, I'm gonna scare the shit
out of all of them.

2889
01:48:03,416 --> 01:48:04,850
Let me look at it.

2890
01:48:03,416 --> 01:48:04,850
Uh-uh.

2891
01:48:04,884 --> 01:48:06,786
It's done.

2892
01:48:09,722 --> 01:48:12,157
Uh, I'm gonna go get
a vase for the flowers.

2893
01:48:12,191 --> 01:48:14,093
Okay.

2894
