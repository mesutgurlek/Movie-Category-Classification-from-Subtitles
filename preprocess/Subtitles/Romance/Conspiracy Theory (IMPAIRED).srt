winners were rounded up...

That's ridiculous! You know
what this stuff does to you?

13
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,977
It actually weakens your will...

14

free and creative thought...

That's like saying, "Smoke cigarettes,"
or "Drive cars." I mean, it's real generic.

- Can you swim, man?
- Ha-ha-ha!

164

up on 40th Street and 7th Avenue.

- They say the subway's a damn river.

Strange.

What's up, Jerry?
What are you thinking?

168
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,824
Water mains don't usually
break unless it's wintertime.

169
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,460
The pipes burst open
because it's cold.

to Aristotle Onassis?

00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,015

used my legs for a wishbone.

you with the wheelchair...

- ...or where it happened, it would help.
- Wheelchair, right.

You got to switch the charts.

471
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:52,318
Switch my charts with that guy's
charts. You gotta switch them.

472
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:56,830
Don't make me repeat myself. Please,
switch my chart or I'll be dead by morning.

- Relax. Go to sleep. I'll see you tomorrow.

- You're just being paranoid.

475

Only paranoid because
they want me dead.

- Guy came in with a stab wound...

482
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,218
and died of a heart attack.
Go figure.

- You Miss Sutton?
- Yes.

484
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,271
They want me to bring
you downstairs.

485
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:08,731
Who does?

486
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,898
The FBI, the CIA. You name the
initials, they're down there.

00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,907
Any special reason?

488
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,615
They said to bring you and
the body to the basement.

489
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,280
And the body's on its
way, so come with me.

Thank you.

For what?

494
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,848
For switching the charts.

495
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,977
I didn't switch the charts.

496
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:50,815
No, it's okay. The guy, he traded bullets
with an old man in a liquor store.

497
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,524
He had it coming.

498
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,987
You expect me to believe that
someone came in here last night...

499
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,652
and gave that guy something
that stopped his heart?

500
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,742
You switched the
charts, you tell me.

501
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,378
I've got to go downstairs, now.

502
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,631
- The CIA wants to see your body.
- Really?

503
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,799
I won't be here when you
get back. I'll keep in touch.

You switched the charts.

- Tell me about it.

Police want him for assault.
Secret Service for counterfeiting.

We're tracking him on a
string of bank robberies.

No one knows what the
CIA wants him for.

This guy's a CIA shrink,
he's here to ID Fletcher.

623
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,707
Truth.

624
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,378
What is it they say about truth?

625
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,222
The truth will set you free.

626
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,684
Thank you.

LOWRY: "Catcher in the Rye."

628
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,592
That's the book Chapman had on
him when he shot John Lennon.

629
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,471
I was just thinking that.

630
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,683
Remember the guy that
shot Reagan? John Hinckley?

631
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:45,516
I read they found a copy of
that book in his apartment.

632
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,812
Weird coincidence, huh?

633
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,811
Thanks for your input, officer.

634
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,073
Unh. Gum...

635
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,905
keys...

636
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,735
and a book.

637
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:04,284
Hmm.

638
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,032
Car.

639
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,409
Maybe apartment.

640
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,165
But, uh...

641
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,921
this in an odd one.

642
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,252
What do you think?
It's got paint on it.

643
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,969
Safety deposit box key.

644
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,509
I'll take that.

645
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,299
And that.

646
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,305
You're welcome.

647
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,436
Spooks.

648
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,525
So, what do you say we, um...

649
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,028
I don't know, compare
notes on this guy?

650
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,657
"Geronimo"?

651
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,218
- No, don't! Don't!
- COP: Let me have the ticket.

652
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:02,301
No, I'm here, I'm here,
I'm here! Oh, God.

653
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:05,842
- There's a "no parking" sign there.
- Yeah, I see it. Yeah, yeah.

654
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:10,104
- Two cops to give a ticket now? Great.
- These days it takes two cops.

655
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,531
(SCREAMS)

656
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,818
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.

657
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,612
Tickets have been coming all day.
Didn't know what to do.

658
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:30,534
- How'd you know this was my car?
- I didn't. It was a lucky guess.

659
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,498
Look, I feel kind of naked.
Could we get out of here?

660
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:37,757
- Please don't tell me you're naked.
- It's a figure of speech. Can we go?

661
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,792
- Please. Hurry.
- Yeah, okay.

662
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:42,303
People are looking
everywhere for the...

663
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,731
What took you so long?
I was here all day.

664
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,735
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital
inside-out. There are people after you.

665
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,740
They'll put me in the same place as
Oswald. Another lunatic acting alone.

666
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,660
Oswald killed the president. Is
that what you're planning to do?

667
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,038
No. Did you call him about
the earthquake thing?

668
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,413
- Warn him?
- I'll do that.

669
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:14,874
- Can you sit up so I can see you?
- No. No. I don't want them to see me.

670
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,129
- Them who?
- Them back there.

671
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:20,087
Look. Change lanes.
Watch the rear-view mirror.

672
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:22,126
It's a fun experiment.

673
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,895
- Did you see it? Wraparound headlights?
- Yeah.

674
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,780
Crown Victoria? FBI.
It's a legitimate tail.

675
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:46,196
As opposed to?

676
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,495
As opposed to people more
serious about their work.

677
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:53,874
Can you drive this thing, or do
you just like looking good in it?

678
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,876
I suppose you think
I should speed up...

679
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,129
- ...and try to lose them?
- Yes.

680
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,460
It's what a man would do.
I'm not a man.

681
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,796
I noticed. Hey, what...?
What are you doing?

682
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,132
What are you doing? What?
What are you doing?

683
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,884
Oh, man.

684
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,516
(HORNS HONKING & SIREN WAILS)

685
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,899
Agent Lowry.

686
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,395
It wasn't my idea.

687
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,858
Jonas?

688
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,233
It's his show for now.

689
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,661
Look, you want to get some dinner?

690
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,289
Interagency cooperation and all?

691
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,003
When I'm ready to compare
notes, I'll let you know.

692
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:40,375
It's your call.

693
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:42,498
Have a good night.

694
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:52,262
See? Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing
tires and knocking over trash cans?

695
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,892
Nothing's easy.

696
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:57,851
- You know that guy they arrested in...
- How long have we known each other?

697
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,939
Six months and 11 days. Um...

698
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:05,480
Six months and 11 days?

699
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,199
All right, I'll give
you one more hour.

700
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:09,483
Where to?

701
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,328
Why did we have to go
down to go back up?

702

JERRY: Shh, shh, shh.

703
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,464
Because...

704
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:28,469
Because it's, uh... I don't like to
come and go the same way twice.

705
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,722
I just live in there.
I have to get...

706
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,507
Get... Unh.

707
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,891
Okay.

Here.

00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,486
- You should have this.
- What is it?

711
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,523
JERRY: It's my union pin.
I figured, the way you drove...

712
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:51,863
you should be in the union.

713
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:56,201
I'd be proud to have you
drive me around in a cab.

714
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,457
Come in, please.

715
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,878
Give me those.
I'll put them up. Unh.

716
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:05,756
Let me shut the door. Sorry
there's not more room in here.

717
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,791
My keys.

718
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,710
I'll just get the light.

719
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,600
The Jerry Garcia file.

720
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:19,057
I didn't... Oh, yeah. Yes, I did.

721
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,722
You know why The Grateful
Dead are always on tour?

722
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:22,981
- No.
- Yeah?

723
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,360
You know why? Because they're all
British agents, intelligence agents.

724
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,236
They're spies.

725
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:32,821
Jerry Garcia himself has a double-0
rating, just like James Bond.

726
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:34,944
Jerry Garcia's dead.

(CHUCKLES)

728
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:39,081
That's what they want
you to think. Unh.

729
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:42,668
Is this supposed to protect
you from aliens or something?

730
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,794
No, it's just a beer bottle.

731
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,580
Follow me.

732
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,590
Come into my humble abode.

733
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,880
Here we go.

734
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,718
Welcome.

735
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,723
Would you like something to drink?

736
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,429
Coffee...

737
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,223
if that's okay.

738
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,563
Oh, no, coffee's our friend.

739
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,604
Coffee's our friend. It's fine.

740
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:27,630
I keep the beans in the fridge. Keeps
them fresher, makes better coffee.

741
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,751
Old Italian guy, Papa
Leoni told me that.

742
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:34,216
He's dead now. Nice old guy.

743
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,552
The hell?

00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,151

00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,657
- "wanting me to be."
- Gah, uh...

747
00:53:55,816 --> 00:54:00,538
Yeah, I can't seem to remember this
combination. Want some juice instead?

748
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,073
Sure.

749
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,890
Oh, you know, if my
universe had a hub...

750
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,934
- This would be it?
- Yeah.

751
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,731
Here.

752
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,313
"In the Irons"?

753
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,110
Yeah, I've been reading
up on it lately. Equitation.

754
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,743
- You know.
- Are these yours?

755
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,492
Yes.

756
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:48,569
But this, I think this is what's
been causing the problem.

757
00:54:48,595 --> 00:54:50,272
This is the third issue this year.

758
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,881
"Conspiracy Theory." I give
you "Conspiracy Theory."

759
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,675
This is my newsletter.

760
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,802
I think it's got them scared.

761
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,181
You know? I must have hit a nerve
with one of those articles in there.

762
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,765
Otherwise... They're pretty pissed
off about something. That's...

763
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:08,056
"The Space Shuttle's
Seismic Secret"?

764
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:12,519
"The Oliver Stone-George Bush
Connection"? Oliver Stone?

765
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:16,689
Oh, oh yeah. Sure. I mean,
he's their spokesman.

766
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,865
Yeah! You think if anyone had the
information that he's got...

767
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,702
and had a national podium to shout
it from, they'd actually let him do it?

768
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:29,585
No, it's quite clear that he's a
disinformation junkie for him.

769
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,165
The fact that he's still alive
says it all. He should be dead.

770
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,176
- Can you prove any of this?
- Heh.

771
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:44,684
No. Absolutely not. A good conspiracy
is, um, an unprovable one.

772
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,765
If you can prove it, they screwed
up somewhere along the line.

773
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,525
- And if that's the case...
- They?

774
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,778
They! Yeah.

775
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,906
- They who?
- They?

776
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,868
They? I... I don't know.

777
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:07,031
That's why they call them "they."
And "them." You know?

01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:49,992
- Murdered?
- Here in Manhattan.

1089
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,533
No, Jerry, I read in the
paper, he was, um...

1090
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:56,169
He drowned in a swimming pool. It
was an accident, it was in Newport.

1091
01:21:56,328 --> 01:22:00,174
No. Nobody dies in Newport. They couldn't
even kill Sunny Von Bulow in Newport.

1092
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:02,175
He drowned, but not in Newport.

1093
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:03,836
ALICE: Where, then?

1094
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,224
Right here, the 7th
Street subway station.

1095
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:12,978
A billionaire waiting on the subway?
Why didn't they drown him in his limo?

No, don't you read the papers?
I mean, don't you watch television? Huh?

Last week, this place
was under water.

this area? The Harriman Building.

1100

I'm telling you, he didn't drown in a pool.

1101

Call the, uh, coroner in Rhode
Island or wherever it was...

1102
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,866
and ask if he had chlorinated
water in his lungs.

1103
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:36,000
- Okay, I will.
- You will?

Yeah, if you want, I will.

I...-

1108

It's like I resolved to...

1109

call you up a thousand times a day.

Uh, I know that. Look.

hold of the first thing I could think.

Yes, we should. It's Geronimo.

on the MK ULTRA program.
Are you familiar with it?

That's a vulgar generalization.

But yes, uh, you take
an ordinary man...

and turn him into an assassin.
