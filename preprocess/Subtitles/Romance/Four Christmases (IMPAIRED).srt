"WHITE CHRISTMAS" PLAYING]

2
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:52,899
Hi.

3
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:54,494
Hi.

4
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:57,073
My name is Kent. What's your name?

5
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,173
- Daphne.
- Daphne? That's a really beautiful name.

6
00:01:00,343 --> 00:01:02,208
It sounds like the name of a flower.

7
00:01:02,378 --> 00:01:05,108
I know it's not a flower,
but it sounds like it could be.

8
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,381
I like flowers.

9
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:12,385
Smelling them, or sending them
to people and stuff. It's good.

10
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,759
Where you from?

11
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:21,129
- Connecticut.
- Oh, really? I'm a big fan of Connecticut.

12
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:22,855
I'm a big... Who isn't, right?

13
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:26,126
You're close enough to the city
that you can really enjoy it...

14
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:28,361
...but far enough away
for a small-town feel.

15
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:31,302
- Did you go to school out there?
- Yeah. I went to Wesleyan.

16
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:33,032
Perfect. That's a great school.

17
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:35,336
- What did you major in?
- Psychology.

18
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,638
That's great.

19
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:39,407
Those are really beautiful earrings,
by the way.

20
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:41,516
They do a nice job
of complementing your...

21
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:45,745
I'm gonna stop you right there.
On paper, you've done everything right.

22
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:50,256
You took an interest in my personal history,
complimented my accessories...

23
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:52,894
...blah, blah, blah.

24
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,355
If we'd met in college, we probably
would have had a relationship...

25
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,864
...which I'd come to regret...

26
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,595
...because I'd have found out that you're
as boring and polite in the bedroom...

27
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:04,433
...as you have been during
this god-awful conversation.

28
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:06,768
- Okay, Daphne...
- lf I wanted an asexual pen pal...

29
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:08,433
...you'd be at the top of my list.

30
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:10,442
We could just iChat all night long.

31
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:12,581
"LOL." Giggles.

32
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:15,445
But, unfortunately,
that's not what I'm looking for.

33
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:18,781
I want a man whose hand doesn't shake
when he puts it up my shirt.

34
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:20,388
You know what I'm saying?

35
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:26,020
- Okay, Daphne, if I could interject for a...
- Save it, Kent. I'm not looking for a BFF.

36
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:27,595
Daphne, please.

37
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:30,522
Bitch, I'm talking to you.

38
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:35,235
- What did you call me?
- I didn't stutter.

39
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,999
Oh, you sure can talk the talk,
you crazy little slut...

40
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:39,698
...but can you deliver the goodies?

41
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:43,408
I don't give a damn about Connecticut.

42
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:46,043
I hate those cheap earrings.

43
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:47,945
I'm from North Dakota...

44
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:51,917
...and this is how we handle our business
in the Bison State, mama.

45
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,513
Get your hands off me right now...

46
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,387
...or I'll take you to your knees
in front of this entire bar.

47
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,925
Promise?

48
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:15,338
GIRL:
Oh, my God. Did you see that?

49
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:18,605
BRAD: Hold on, angel crossing!
Angel crossing! Get on there.

50
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,078
Here we come! Watch out.

51
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:40,195
BRAD:
What a beautiful view.

52
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:44,005
So this is where you live?

53
00:03:46,342 --> 00:03:49,368
This is where you live too, honey.
Come on.

54
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:57,375
KATE: What'd you think about Daphne?
- I really liked Daphne.

55
00:03:57,553 --> 00:03:58,577
KATE: You did?
- Yeah.

56
00:03:58,755 --> 00:03:59,779
Definitely naughty.

57
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:03,192
- She was a lot naughty, but in a fun way.
- Yeah.

58
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:04,451
Did you like Kent?

59
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:05,889
KATE: Kent was hot.
- Really?

60
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:09,725
- Those glasses were a nice touch.
- I started feeling the Great Plains vibe.

61
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:12,231
Like he was an angry cowboy
who drives a van.

62
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:14,870
- Hot.
- But has ninja equipment at his apartment.

63
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:17,739
He had a lot happening, Kent.
You know what I mean?

64
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,774
- He's like a Transformer.
- I might need to meet Kent again.

65
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:23,879
Come here, toothpaste and all.

66
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:26,206
- I love you, Kate.
- I love you, Brad.

67
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:27,872
You're the best girl in the world.

68
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,516
INSTRUCTOR:
Ready, and...

69
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,680
...slow, quick, quick, slow.

70
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:46,701
INSTRUCTOR: Brad, streamlined arms.
Kate, hold your frame.

71
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,427
A one and a two.

72
00:04:57,947 --> 00:04:59,881
Let's get these off of you.

73
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,573
That was fun.

74
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,616
- That feels good.
- It's the acupressure.

75
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,583
- Really?
- I don't know what I'm doing.

76
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,047
This stuff is connected to all
different stuff inside your tummy.

77
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,886
- I know.
- Lf I push the wrong thing...

78
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,153
- Do you know what that's for?
- Not till later.

79
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:16,298
- Okay?
- So when's the big day?

80
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,466
KATE: Hm?
- I'm sorry?

81
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,966
We're getting married
in the spring in South Carolina.

82
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:23,731
- What about you guys?
- Oh, we're not getting married.

83
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,398
WOMAN: Oh.
- So why are you taking dance classes?

84
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,044
That's just one of many things...

85
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,077
...that we do together.
- Yeah, it's fun.

86
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,272
I can't think of anything
we don't do together.

87
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,849
Right. So why wouldn't
you wanna get married?

88
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,816
- Well, we're happy.
- We're happy.

89
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,147
And I love her, so...

90
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:42,450
Marriage just brings pressure
and stress and all kinds of stuff.

91
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,786
We don't want our relationship
to turn into work.

92
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:47,987
We wanna be together because
we enjoy it, not because we have to.

93
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:50,758
There's a reason
that they use the expressions:

94
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,662
"Tying the knot" or "ball and chain."

95
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,167
Have you listened to the words
of a marriage ceremony?

96
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:58,068
Like, "I promise to obey"?
Or, "Till death do us part"?

97
00:05:58,241 --> 00:05:59,936
I'd rather be stuck on an island...

98
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,340
...with some weird millionaire hunting me
and me trying to escape...

99
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:05,447
...than be involved with those slogans.

100
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,277
That's like a time bomb
waiting to explode.

101
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:10,676
What about children?
You want to make them, no?

102
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:12,150
- No.
- No. No.

103
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,516
- I don't wanna make them.
KATE: Uh-uh.

104
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,989
I just don't wanna, like,
be responsible for this kid...

105
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:21,187
...and hurt their feelings
and disappoint them.

106
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:23,161
That's what happened with our families.

107
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:25,562
We're both from divorced families.
We've seen it.

108
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:27,498
We don't need to repeat the pattern.

109
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,537
But, anyway,
congratulations on getting married.

110
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:32,765
That sounds really cool,
and to each their own.

111
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:34,102
Yeah, absolutely.

112
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,711
BRAD: Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

113
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,695
Big Bad Brad.

114
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,503
ERIC: How you guys doing?
- Look at this. How are you?

115
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,472
- You remember my girlfriend.
- How are you?

116
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:09,042
- Stan and Eric.
- Good to see you.

117
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:11,578
So, what are you guys doing
for Christmas?

118
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:14,307
I've got the entire family flying in.

119
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:16,679
Thirteen airport pickups.

120
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,550
Four days of listening
to how gifted my nieces are.

121
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:24,056
My brother thinks his daughter,
the 4-year-old...

122
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:25,751
...is gonna be the next Beyonce.

[HUMMING]

124
00:07:29,765 --> 00:07:32,233
She's bad. And she sucks.

125
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:37,897
I'm vacationing in tropical Albany
this year with Trish's family.

126
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:39,837
They got us a cot, which is awesome.

127
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:43,775
But we'll probably sleep on the musty couch
in the basement with the cats...

128
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,538
...all seven of them.

129
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,683
Oh, and we get to be there
the whole week.

130
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,715
Kind of sounds like a prison sentence.

131
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,547
Why do you put yourselves
through that?

132
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,521
- It's Christmas, right? Don't you have to?
- We don't need to do it anymore.

133
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:58,421
- And we absolutely don't do it anymore.
- We're done.

134
00:07:58,594 --> 00:07:59,754
Why, what are you doing?

135
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,954
We're going to Fiji. Just the two of us.

136
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:03,962
- Fiji?
KATE: Yeah.

137
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,623
Don't your families get upset?

138
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:07,632
You tell them you're doing charity work.

139
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:10,966
You know, something like building houses
in Third World countries.

140
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,199
Teaching English in Puerto Rico.

141
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,307
Delousing orphans in Somalia.

142
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:18,538
Helping Chinese kids capture lobsters...

143
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:22,309
...boil them, cut them,
clean the weird stuff out of the middle.

144
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:26,216
We find that the more details you give
kind of throws them off the scent.

145
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:29,590
You lie to your families at Christmastime?

146
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,125
You really can't spell
"families" without "lies."

147
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:33,819
Try it.

148
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,923
But don't you ever feel guilty?

149
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,966
For taking a vacation on our vacation?
No, not really.

150
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:43,003
- You do look pretty sexy with a tan.
- Thanks, babe.

151
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:46,804
You can take this guy.
Take this guy and cover him here.

152
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,774
- Like that.
- Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

153
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:54,847
By the way, I made a couples' massage
for us when we get in.

154
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,678

00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:59,433
We're named after the cities
in which we were conceived.

305
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,296
I'm Denver, that's Dallas.

306
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,698
And this is Orlando.

307
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:06,235
Orlando.

308
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:10,242
Well, my given name is Orlando,
but I changed it to Brad, so...

309
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:11,936
I'm Brad.

310
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:15,378
- What?
- Well, merry Christmas, one and all!

311
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:16,745
HOWARD:
Come on. Come on.

312
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,750
Hors d'oeuvre, anyone?

313
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,650
Who you trying to impress, Suze?

314
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:25,156
- We also got beer-mosas in the back, so...
- Ladies first.

315
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:27,295
KATE: Thank you so much.
SUSAN: Sure.

316
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:34,102
- What is this? Is this cheese?
- Yeah. Spray.

317
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,671
Spray cheese from the famous
family of aerosol cheeses.

318
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:40,069
Ah!

319
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:41,400
HOWARD:
Ooh.

320
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:42,601
[LAUGHS]

321
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,903
[GRUNTING]

322
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,575
- Give me your hand.
BRAD: Please.

323
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:48,312
[BRAD SCREAMING]

324
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:50,007
Great. Here we go.

325
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:52,483
You got something to say
about my wife's cheese?

326
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,349
Come on, damn it! Come on!

327
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,391
- Pump it! Pump it! Harder!
- I haven't seen that move in a while.

328
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,586
BRAD: Get your dick out of my face!
- Soldier boy! Soldier boy!

329
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:04,859
You like spray cheese!
You like spray cheese!

330
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:07,763
BRAD: You're gonna snap my hand!
- Bring it home, soldier boy.

331
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:25,645
Oh, God, honey. I am so sorry
that you had to see that.

332
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:27,049
Let me apologize for them.

333
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:31,488
If you want to say "mistletoe"
because it's too heavy for you, I get it.

334
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,218
Don't feel weird about that.

335
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:36,455
If you need to leave, you let me know
what your comfort zone is.

336
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:38,065
Because that was weird.

337
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,827
I cannot believe you did not tell me
your real name.

338
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:42,561
What are you talking about?

339
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,739
It's crazy. We've been together for 3 years,
and I don't know your real name.

340
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:50,242
- Doesn't that strike you as odd?
- No, it doesn't strike me as odd.

341
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:52,141
I hated my name, so I changed it.

342
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:54,839
You don't say, "My name
used to be Asshole, but it's Bob."

343
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:56,109
You say, "My name's Bob."

344
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:59,812
Maybe to a stranger on the street, but to
somebody you're sharing your life with?

345
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:02,923
- You tell them your real name.
- I don't wanna get into this now.

346
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,889
This is what I was afraid
would happen if we came here.

347
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,325
This isn't us, it's them.
We're letting them in.

348
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:11,193
Your real name isn't "Asshole"?
It's not your middle name?

349
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:14,392
- I don't wanna be blindsided again.
- Oh, that's very funny.

350
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,094
Go ahead and take a shot at me.

351
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,297
It's bad enough with those Neanderthals.
I gotta take it from you?

352
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:21,375
No, you shouldn't.

353
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:23,807
And you shouldn't let them
walk all over you either.

354
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:28,449
Kate, they are trained UFC fighters.
They know pressure points on people.

355
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:30,107
But you're twice their size.

356
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:32,276
They're semiprofessional cage fighters.

357
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,979
One person comes out, one doesn't.
You know what I mean?

358
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:38,786
- Like cockfighting, but, like, with dudes.
- You said they were personal trainers.

359
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:41,657
- They're dude cockfighters.
- Like that thing on pay-per-view?

360
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,266
Yes, exactly.
Except they don't actually get paid for it.

361
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,029
They mostly brawl in people's back yards,
then upload the footage to You Tube.

362
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:53,206
Honey, my childhood was just like
The Shawshank Redemption.

363
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,572
Except I didn't have some kind, older,
soft-spoken gentle black man...

364
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:58,474
...to share my struggle with.

365
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,979
But you're not that child anymore, okay?

366
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:05,051
You're a grown, strong,
confident, successful man.

367
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,984
Okay, I really don't wanna get into this.

368
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:10,920
Let me just let you know the truth.
They're intimidated by you.

369
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:14,829
What you need to do is go out there
and set some healthy boundaries...

370
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:17,693
...and demand that they respect you.
You know what I'm saying?

371
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:21,302
DENVER: Big City, time to open presents.
HOWARD: Come on, son. We gotta go!

372
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,667
This is your opportunity.
You can do this, baby.

373
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:26,700
BRAD:
Mm-hm.

374
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,073
Okay, gentlemen.

375
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:36,615
Can we just take it down a notch, please?

376
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:39,117
I'm not a kid. You can't
talk to me like that anymore.

377
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:40,915
We're adults. Do you understand?

378
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:43,819
I'm a grown man
with hair on my chest. Right?

379
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,189
There's going to be certain boundaries
that will exist between us now.

380
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:50,729
They might be invisible, so I know
that you won't be able to see them...

381
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:54,232
...but you'll certainly be able to respect
the fact that they're there.

382
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:57,399
These boundaries are not to be crossed.

383
00:20:57,572 --> 00:20:59,631
And if they are crossed...

384
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:02,333
...there's gonna be
real consequences to that.

385
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,604
Thank you.

386
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,779
BRAD: Ow! Oh, God.
- Welcome to the Octagon, son!

387
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:16,816
Don't! Stop it! Where you taking...? Ow!

388
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,627
- What's happening?
DALLAS: Suplex!

389
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:24,529
Oh, my God.

390
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,758
BRAD:
Ah!

391
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:30,064
- Oh, God!
- Dad, tag us in.

392
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:33,071
- You boys get hurt, I lose custody again.
- Tag them in!

393
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:34,799
COD Y: Come on, Daddy.
CONNOR: Tag us in.

394
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:36,569
DALLAS: Merry Christmas.
- Yes.

395
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:37,803
Bring it!

396
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:41,806
DENVER:
Yeah! Get it!

397
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:43,984
Yeah! Yeah!

398
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,377
Ah!

399
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,647
- Google me, bitch!
- What?

400
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:50,656
Google me! You might wanna
look me up sometime, Barbara!

401
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:53,523
- No!
- Enough roughhousing!

402
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:55,060
Stop!

403
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,326
Let's open the presents so Orlando
can get to his other Christmases, all right?

404
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:01,000
Let's do it.

405
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,671
That was excellent.

406
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:10,337
Baby?

407
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:12,003
It's me, it's me.

408
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:15,449
Are you okay? Did you break anything?

409
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:20,049
I am so proud of you.

410
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,353
Lando, you're closest to the tree.
You distribute.

411
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,459
Gosh, wasn't it just so hard to find gifts
under the $ 10 cap this year?

412
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:36,297
The first gift is to Connor.

413
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:38,598
- The $ 10 what?
- $ 10 spending cap.

414
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,674
From Uncle Brad
and his special friend Kate.

415
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:44,243
Maybe this will make you think
about being mean to your nice uncle...

416
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:47,075
...after you see what he got you.
Go ahead, open it up.

417
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:49,540
KATE: Brad.
- Yeah.

418
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,050
- What?
- Xbox? This is awesome, man!

419
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:54,586
Top-shelf for you, pal.

420
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:57,725
It's got the triple-core processor,
wireless controllers, the whole deal.

421
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,485
There was a $ 10 spending cap.

422
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:02,391
How in the hell did you find
an Xbox for under $ 10?

423
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:05,364
Somebody's trying to show off
how much money he makes.

424
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:06,933
- Yeah.
- Maybe someone's family...

425
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:09,332
...didn't tell him there was
a $ 10 spending cap.

426
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:12,337
Maybe if you came home
more than once a decade, you'd know that.

427
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:14,600
Okay, guys, can we try
to stay positive here?

428
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:17,677
What's the problem? We're trying
to give gifts to some children.

429
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:20,337
It's Christmas.
Let's keep the momentum going here.

430
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:23,609
Okay, the next gift is to Cody.

431
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:28,688
And this is from your dad. Okay?
I'm sure this is a good gift too, okay?

432
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,653
Dig in there. Tear it up.

433
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:38,522
A flashlight? That's it?

434
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,362
- Why don't you love me, Daddy?
BRAD: Okay, okay.

435
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,837
Honestly, I think it's my fault. I didn't
know there was a $ 10 spending cap.

436
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,976
Well, my gift from Santa Claus
better be straight cool.

437
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:51,271
BRAD: I have a feeling that
your gift from Santa...

438
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:53,641
...will probably ring in
right around $ 10 too.

439
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:57,808
- Why? Is Santa Claus cheap like my daddy?
BRAD: No, Santa is Dad.

440
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,154
- Dad just goes ahead and writes "Santa"...
- Lando.

441
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:03,549
BRAD:
What? I don't understand.

442
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,927
What's happening? What's happening?

443
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:10,059
- What's the problem? What's the problem?
- There's no Santa Claus?

444
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:13,565
Okay. You're joking with me, right?
You're kidding with me.

445
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:16,137
They know there's not a Santa Claus,
right?

446
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,565
- They do now.
- How can you lie to us, Daddy?

447
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:23,404
BRAD: There is a Santa Claus.
- Cody, come on, man.

448
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:25,546
COD Y:
Even Santa Claus don't love me!

449
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,013
Hey! That's not gonna bring back Santa.
That's not gonna bring...

450
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,915
When he hurts inside and can't use
his emotion words, he takes to streaking.

451
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,745
COD Y:
Ah!

452
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,589

00:59:25,174 --> 00:59:26,641
So who wants to go first?

1061
00:59:26,809 --> 00:59:28,071
- I'll go.
- Okay.

1062
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:30,473
Brad, why don't you buzz your mom...

1063
00:59:30,646 --> 00:59:32,079
...and then I'll do the timer?

1064
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:33,679
Thanks.

1065
00:59:35,184 --> 00:59:36,913
On your mark, get set...

1066
00:59:37,086 --> 00:59:38,110
...go.

1067
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,784
Okay. This is a town in France.

1068
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:41,980
[BUZZ]

1069
00:59:42,157 --> 00:59:43,954
- What?
- "France" is on the thing.

1070
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:46,526
- Don't buzz me like that.
- It's the same for everybody.

1071
00:59:46,695 --> 00:59:48,890
It's okay, sweetie, just do the next card.

1072
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:51,223
Okay...

1073
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:52,861
...this is me.

1074
00:59:53,035 --> 00:59:54,525
- I'm a...?
- Cradle robber.

1075
00:59:54,703 --> 00:59:56,170
DARRYL: Keep going.
- What did he say?

1076
00:59:56,338 --> 00:59:58,033
Don't worry. You're a therapist.

1077
00:59:58,207 --> 01:00:01,233
No, no, no. Not Capricorn but a...

1078
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:03,173
- Libra.
- Yes!

1079
01:00:04,013 --> 01:00:05,378
It's fun.

1080
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,380
Okay...

1081
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:09,611
...this is what you dripped on me.

1082
01:00:10,185 --> 01:00:11,243
Wax.

1083
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,513
PAULA:
No, after that.

1084
01:00:14,056 --> 01:00:16,524
- It's brown.
- Okay, make this stop, please.

1085
01:00:16,692 --> 01:00:19,286
- Oh, chocolate.
- No, before that, after the wax!

1086
01:00:19,461 --> 01:00:21,361
BRAD: Oh, my God.
- The syrup.

1087
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,361
- Yes!
DARRYL: Yes! Yes.

1088
01:00:23,532 --> 01:00:25,693
It's way sticky, dude.
I would not recommend that.

1089
01:00:26,068 --> 01:00:28,798
PAULA: Okay.
- Okay, time. Time.

1090
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:31,371
- Oh, good job, good job.
- Good job. Well, we got two.

1091
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,973
Okay, who wants to go next?

1092
01:00:33,142 --> 01:00:34,769
- We'll go.
KATE: Okay, great.

1093
01:00:35,077 --> 01:00:37,102
KATE:
I'll do the buzzer.

1094
01:00:38,147 --> 01:00:40,615
Are you gonna actually
eat while you play that?

1095
01:00:40,949 --> 01:00:42,473
- You just flip the tube.
BRAD: Excuse me?

1096
01:00:42,651 --> 01:00:44,050
Flip the tube.

1097
01:00:44,219 --> 01:00:46,551
KATE:
Okay. On your mark, get set, go!

1098
01:00:47,489 --> 01:00:48,547
Capital of China.

1099
01:00:48,724 --> 01:00:50,316
- Hong Kong.
- Yes.

1100
01:00:50,492 --> 01:00:52,323
Thing next to your bed on the nightstand.

1101
01:00:52,494 --> 01:00:53,893
- A sock?
- Yes.

1102
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:57,228
SUSAN: I helped you come up with this
when you were drunk...

1103
01:00:57,399 --> 01:00:59,890
...and you came home
from the bar last Thursday.

1104
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:01,093
- Alibi.
- Yes.

1105
01:01:01,737 --> 01:01:04,831
All right. The thing I'm not allowed
to wear to Supercross.

1106
01:01:05,007 --> 01:01:06,497
- Miniskirt.
- Yes.

1107
01:01:06,675 --> 01:01:09,269
Me and you dry-humping on the beach.

1108
01:01:09,912 --> 01:01:12,676
- A screen saver.
- Yes, baby. This game is so easy.

1109
01:01:13,248 --> 01:01:16,945
The only man that I am allowed
to cheat on you with.

1110
01:01:17,419 --> 01:01:18,681
- John Grisham.
- Yes.

1111
01:01:18,854 --> 01:01:20,981
Mexican dude.

1112
01:01:21,156 --> 01:01:22,418
- Ricardo Montalban.
- Yes.

1113
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:24,752
- Time.
- Right here.

1114
01:01:24,927 --> 01:01:26,485
SUSAN:
Oh, my God. Come here.

1115
01:01:28,163 --> 01:01:30,825
This is like an animals-attack video.

1116
01:01:30,999 --> 01:01:32,694
- There's other people.
- Stop, baby.

1117
01:01:32,868 --> 01:01:34,335
Sto... Oh, God.

1118
01:01:34,803 --> 01:01:36,862
You guys got a lot. How many was that?

1119
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:38,472
- Seven.
- Seven.

1120
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,608
KATE: Paula, can you do the buzzer?
PAULA: Oh, yeah.

1121
01:01:40,776 --> 01:01:42,505
We can do this, baby. You ready?

1122
01:01:42,678 --> 01:01:44,942
- Yeah. Let's do it.
- Okay, let's light a fire.

1123
01:01:45,114 --> 01:01:46,376
SUSAN:
Ready? Go.

1124
01:01:46,548 --> 01:01:49,278
Okay, this is the thing
I'm most scared of in the whole world.

1125
01:01:49,451 --> 01:01:51,976
- Snakes.
- No, no. The thing I'm most scared of.

1126
01:01:52,154 --> 01:01:53,348
Jump-Jumps, 4-year-olds.

1127
01:01:53,522 --> 01:01:55,717
More than anything.
This scares me to my core.

1128
01:01:55,891 --> 01:01:58,621
You have to come with a...
Use a lifeline. Ask the audience.

1129
01:01:58,794 --> 01:02:00,159
Spiders. I'm scared of spiders.

1130
01:02:00,329 --> 01:02:02,024
BRAD:
You don't have to say the answer.

1131
01:02:02,197 --> 01:02:05,428
You say something like "an eight-legged
animal," or like "a superhero..."

1132
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:07,330
[BUZZ]
Can't say "superhero."

1133
01:02:07,503 --> 01:02:10,063
- Mom, I'm not the one with the card.
- Let's just try again.

1134
01:02:10,339 --> 01:02:13,570
Okay. In high school, my senior year
spring break I was in Cancun.

1135
01:02:13,742 --> 01:02:16,404
I was wearing this bikini top,
I'd lost all this weight.

1136
01:02:16,578 --> 01:02:18,375
- Tourist. Skinny.
- And... No, no, no.

1137
01:02:18,547 --> 01:02:21,516
- Thin?
- No, I was on the bar, shaking around...

1138
01:02:21,683 --> 01:02:23,913
- Dancer.
- My stuff fell out. All the bartenders...

1139
01:02:24,086 --> 01:02:25,485
- Your what fell out?
- My stuff.

1140
01:02:25,654 --> 01:02:27,747
Everybody would call me
when I went to the bar.

1141
01:02:27,923 --> 01:02:29,515
They'd say: "Oh, here comes..."?

1142
01:02:32,694 --> 01:02:34,059
Peek-a-boo.

1143
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:36,054
Peek-a-boo.

1144
01:02:36,231 --> 01:02:38,665
Okay, honey, you can say,
like, "look." Or like something...

1145
01:02:38,834 --> 01:02:40,267
[BUZZ]
Can't say "look."

1146
01:02:40,435 --> 01:02:42,096
I don't have the card.
I'm giving examples.

1147
01:02:42,271 --> 01:02:43,966
- Let's go.
- Lf I have the thing...

1148
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:45,265
- See?
- You can't say "see."

1149
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,204
- I'm just explaining how the game works.
- Can't say "game"!

1150
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:51,343
Mom, the answer's been said.
She said the answer.

1151
01:02:51,513 --> 01:02:53,913
- We're running out of time.
- You know what I mean?

1152
01:02:54,082 --> 01:02:57,677
I got it. Okay, this is something
that you would eat...

1153
01:02:57,853 --> 01:02:59,718
...and you put it on the barbeque.

1154
01:02:59,888 --> 01:03:00,946
- Chicken.
- My favorite...

1155
01:03:01,123 --> 01:03:02,249
- Beef.
- Can't say "beef"!

1156
01:03:02,424 --> 01:03:06,121
Mom, I'm not the one saying the things.
Do you get that? Just, shh, with the...

1157
01:03:06,295 --> 01:03:08,126
PAULA: You can't say "shh."
- I can say "shush."

1158
01:03:08,297 --> 01:03:09,696
KATE: Move on.
PAULA: You can't say "shush."

1159
01:03:09,865 --> 01:03:11,025
"Kebab."

1160
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,431
Ma, it's "kebab."
It says I can't say "shish."

1161
01:03:14,603 --> 01:03:16,537
Shish. Shish. Shish.

1162
01:03:16,705 --> 01:03:18,434
I could say it because I don't have it.

1163
01:03:18,607 --> 01:03:21,269
That's why there's a thing,
so that I can't see what it is.

1164
01:03:21,443 --> 01:03:23,035
KATE:
Okay, let's just move on.

1165
01:03:24,213 --> 01:03:25,271
Our time's up.

1166
01:03:27,816 --> 01:03:29,374
What's this attitude, Brad?

1167
01:03:29,551 --> 01:03:31,212
No attitude, I've shut down.

1168
01:03:31,386 --> 01:03:34,116
She buzzes me, I'm explaining
to you how to play the game...

1169
01:03:34,289 --> 01:03:36,985
...you obviously don't understand
the ways to play the game...

1170
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:38,285
...and I'm shutting down.

1171
01:03:56,144 --> 01:03:58,339
I wanna talk to you about something.

1172
01:03:59,448 --> 01:04:01,143
I know what you wanna talk about.

1173
01:04:01,316 --> 01:04:03,807
- You do?
- I don't want you to apologize for it.

1174
01:04:03,986 --> 01:04:07,752
Because love means never having to say
that you're sorry. You know what I mean?

1175
01:04:07,923 --> 01:04:09,686
But for the record, I do forgive you.

1176
01:04:10,359 --> 01:04:12,327
But when you're playing board games...

1177
01:04:12,494 --> 01:04:15,657
...you shouldn't go so conceptual,
you do wanna go a lot more literal.

1178
01:04:15,831 --> 01:04:19,198
- But how else will you know unless you...?
- No. I took a pregnancy test today.

1179
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:21,961
You took what?

1180
01:04:22,337 --> 01:04:24,498
I took a pregnancy test today.

1181
01:04:24,973 --> 01:04:26,167
At my mom's house.

1182
01:04:26,341 --> 01:04:28,172
It was in my sister's bag...

1183
01:04:28,343 --> 01:04:32,109
...and I'd been a couple days late,
so I thought I should probably take a test...

1184
01:04:32,281 --> 01:04:34,647
- Honey, you pulled the goalie?
- What?

1185
01:04:34,816 --> 01:04:37,341
You can't pull the goalie without
checking with your team.

1186
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:39,453
That's not what this conversation
is about.

1187
01:04:39,621 --> 01:04:41,816
Well, what are you talking about?

1188
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:44,550
Relax, Brad, it was negative.
I'm not pregnant.

1189
01:04:44,726 --> 01:04:47,661
Why don't you just hit me with that
right from the start...

1190
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:50,195
...versus making me take laps
around the anxiety pool?

1191
01:04:50,565 --> 01:04:52,328
What is this reaction?

1192
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:56,130
If there's one thing we learned by being
forced to be with our families today...

1193
01:04:56,305 --> 01:04:59,069
...it's about the dangers of procreating.
All right?

1194
01:04:59,241 --> 01:05:02,972
- Besides, that's not what we want in life.
- No, Brad, I realized it today.

1195
01:05:03,145 --> 01:05:06,046
I thought I'd always known
I didn't wanna have kids.

1196
01:05:06,214 --> 01:05:10,116
Then I took the test, waited to see if it's
positive or negative, and thought...

1197
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:13,413
For just a second I felt different,
you know?

1198
01:05:13,588 --> 01:05:15,351
I felt hopeful.

1199
01:05:15,524 --> 01:05:20,518
Like maybe it would just happen and
we'd be forced to get over all of our fears.

1200
01:05:20,929 --> 01:05:24,228
We've spent so much of our relationship
creating all these boundaries.

1201
01:05:24,399 --> 01:05:28,028
Making sure that we don't limit ourselves
with responsibility and obligation.

1202
01:05:28,203 --> 01:05:31,070
I don't wanna live like that anymore.
That's not loving at all.

1203
01:05:32,274 --> 01:05:33,673
Is that an '80s song?

1204
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:35,571
- No, Brad.
- Are you throwing '80s songs?

1205
01:05:35,744 --> 01:05:37,109
I'm tired of being one foot in.

1206
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,770
I want us to love each other
however it's gonna be.

1207
01:05:39,948 --> 01:05:43,748

you got sweater vest and lacrosse all day.

1362
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:40,304
But with public school, you worry
about some hyperactive art student...

1363
01:16:40,475 --> 01:16:43,205
...hopped up on medication,
trying to shank the little guy.

1364
01:16:43,378 --> 01:16:44,709
And that's uncomfortable too.

1365
01:16:44,879 --> 01:16:48,906
Are you having this conversation with me
because you're comfortable having it?

1366
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:51,176
Or just because you wanna go to Fiji?

1367
01:16:51,352 --> 01:16:52,683
I wanna go to Fiji.

1368
01:16:52,854 --> 01:16:56,290
The tickets are already paid for
and the hotel rooms aren't transferable.

1369
01:16:56,457 --> 01:17:01,588
But, honey, I do feel comfortable now,
I think, having this conversation.

1370
01:17:01,763 --> 01:17:04,197
Because, in my heart,
I know that I found...

1371
01:17:04,365 --> 01:17:08,267
...the one person in life that I wanna
have these conversations with.

1372
01:17:08,436 --> 01:17:11,496
And that person's you.
I love you so much.

1373
01:17:11,673 --> 01:17:12,970
Come here.

1374
01:17:18,713 --> 01:17:20,840
So this doesn't mean we're getting married...

1375
01:17:21,015 --> 01:17:23,006
...or having kids right away.
- No, no, no.

1376
01:17:23,184 --> 01:17:25,118
But we should talk about it,
because these things happen.

1377
01:17:25,286 --> 01:17:26,685
Not that we're planning on it.

1378
01:17:26,854 --> 01:17:29,345
But we're talking about it,
because these things happen.

1379
01:17:29,524 --> 01:17:30,855
And if we do have them...

1380
01:17:31,025 --> 01:17:33,255
...then, you know,
there's a lot of advantages.

1381
01:17:33,428 --> 01:17:36,591
Yeah. They're wonderful.
They give you love unconditionally...

1382
01:17:36,764 --> 01:17:40,461
They're little walking tax shelters.
You can write a lot of stuff off.

1383
01:17:40,635 --> 01:17:42,626
And all the yard work.
You save so much money.

1384
01:17:42,804 --> 01:17:44,328
I mean, once they're a certain age.

1385
01:17:44,505 --> 01:17:47,065
You won't have them on the lawnmower
when they're 7.

1386
01:17:47,241 --> 01:17:48,868
- We're not talking about slave labor.
- No, no, no.

1387
01:17:49,043 --> 01:17:51,068
- Teaching them discipline.
- Chores for money.

1388
01:17:51,245 --> 01:17:52,906
We weren't planning for our future.

1389
01:17:53,081 --> 01:17:55,982
We would've ended up living
in some home playing bingo in Florida.

1390
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:58,778
- But now, we can live with them.
- They'll set us up.

1391
01:17:58,953 --> 01:18:01,319
We never thought about it
like this before.

1392
01:18:01,489 --> 01:18:05,926
Honey, I want you to feel comfortable
to talk to me about anything.

1393
01:18:06,094 --> 01:18:09,257
Unless there's, like, you know,
a playoff game or something like that.

1394
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:11,830
You know what I mean?
Then we find an appropriate time.

1395
01:18:11,999 --> 01:18:14,467
- I'm kidding. Kind of.
- Okay, babe.

1396
01:18:14,635 --> 01:18:19,004
Just to be clear, this doesn't mean we're
getting married or having kids right away.

1397
01:18:19,173 --> 01:18:22,472
It just means that we're open
to let love grow where it wants to grow.

1398
01:18:22,643 --> 01:18:24,668
- Exactly, yeah.
- We're open to letting it grow.

1399
01:18:24,846 --> 01:18:26,313
That doesn't mean kids.

1400
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:32,208
BRAD: Wow, I can't believe we did it.
- We did.

1401
01:18:33,688 --> 01:18:36,748
I don't know what happened.
I can't even remember the procedure.

1402
01:18:36,924 --> 01:18:38,687
But here's this beautiful thing, here.

1403
01:18:39,127 --> 01:18:42,028
I did feel a little like
an air-traffic controller, between the:

1404
01:18:42,196 --> 01:18:43,254
[GRUNTING]

1405
01:18:43,431 --> 01:18:44,693
And the signals and stuff.

1406
01:18:44,866 --> 01:18:47,994
It just kind of all happened,
but, God, it's awesome, baby.

1407
01:18:48,169 --> 01:18:50,034
- Isn't it amazing?
- You were amazing.

1408
01:18:50,204 --> 01:18:51,728
You just rocked this world!

1409
01:18:52,373 --> 01:18:54,637
- We have a baby.
- How's she doing?

1410
01:18:54,809 --> 01:18:56,003
Good. She's sleeping.

1411
01:18:56,177 --> 01:18:58,805
Just wanted to let you
and our New Year's baby know...

1412
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:01,505
...that you're welcome
to bring in family members now.

1413
01:19:01,682 --> 01:19:04,378
- That's not happening.
- We're not bringing in our family.

1414
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:07,019
Your families don't know you had a baby?

1415
01:19:07,188 --> 01:19:09,918
To be honest, they'd be shocked
to even hear Kate was pregnant.

1416
01:19:10,091 --> 01:19:12,218
Our families
can be a little much sometimes.

1417
01:19:12,393 --> 01:19:15,294
I like to think of it like
we're keeping it special for us...

1418
01:19:15,463 --> 01:19:17,124
...rather than not including them.

1419
01:19:17,398 --> 01:19:20,629
Happy New Year, Bay Area.
We are here at Pacific General...

1420
01:19:20,802 --> 01:19:23,362
...where the first baby of the New Year
has just been born.

1421
01:19:23,538 --> 01:19:25,972
Let's go say hello to those lucky parents.

1422
01:19:26,174 --> 01:19:30,133
Congratulations, McVie family, on having
the first baby of the New Year.

1423
01:19:30,311 --> 01:19:31,608
Dad, how does it feel?

1424
01:19:35,516 --> 01:19:37,040
BRAD:
Um...

1425
01:19:37,685 --> 01:19:39,152
We're doing great.

1426
01:19:39,554 --> 01:19:44,218
And then there was a vacuum.

1427
01:19:44,992 --> 01:19:47,222
And then there was...

1428
01:19:47,695 --> 01:19:50,027
...stretching and the juices.

1429
01:19:50,198 --> 01:19:54,294
What he's trying to say is that
we're just beyond words excited about...

1430
01:19:54,468 --> 01:19:55,594
Oh, goodness!

1431
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:56,930
[COUGHING]

1432
01:19:57,104 --> 01:19:58,833
BRAD:
I got it on me!

1433
01:19:59,006 --> 01:20:00,667
I got some in my mouth!

1434
01:20:01,008 --> 01:20:02,407
I can't be around this!

1435
01:20:02,577 --> 01:20:03,771
I'm gonna do it too!

1437
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,971
