After she failed high school,

152
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,517
I get her into a secretarial course run
by a mate of mine. $300 a term.

153
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:00,557
Two years, $2,000.

- She comes out, she can't even type.
- I could type.

155
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:06,159
Then I get her a job
at me solicitor's.

156
00:10:06,263 --> 00:10:09,874
After a month, Stevie Mason rings up
and says he'll have to let her go...

157
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:11,917
'cause she can't type.

158
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:14,837
If I couldn't type, why did they
give me my secretarial diploma?

159
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:17,870
Because I paid for it!

160

like a dead weight!

161

getting arrested at weddings!

162
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:28,182
You're useless.

00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,062
You're all useless.

164
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,782

[Woman]
Bill. Bill!

166
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:45,141
- [Bill] It's Deidre Chambers.
- What a go!

167
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:47,628
- What a coincidence.
Deidre, pull up a chair.
- What a coincidence!

168

Penelope, shift out! Deidre,
Victor Keinosuke and his mate Akira.

- Deidre's a sales representative
for Radiant Cosmetics.
- Beauty consultant, Bill.

Sorry. Beauty consultant.

172
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:02,895
"Sales representative"
sounds so common.

I advise women on the right
lipstick, base and eyeliner.

174

- She was arrested.
- That's lovely.

were 22 again, Betty?

- Remember that age?
- Oh, yes. What?

180
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:30,512
I bet you were a terror
when you were 22.

181
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:33,070
Bill, was she a terror?

182

Where's Charlie Chan
with that food?

- Two new bars through there.

Rose Biggs?

Well, he said they don't
sleep together. She only sucks him off.

Why?

Just Hibiscus Island.

We didn't think that you could afford it
because you don't have a job.

I'm a beauty consultant.

We're ragers.

to do your hair, but you never listen.

You listen to '70s music.

[Bill] Make sure she sees

She fills in the amount
when Deidre tells her what it is.
