00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:48,815
[ Narrator ] ln a time
when one's town was one's world...

2
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:51,861
and the actions at a dance
excited greater interest...

3
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:54,294
than the movement of armies,

4
00:02:54,364 --> 00:02:59,927
there lived a young woman who knew
how this world should be run.

5
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:03,302
The most beautiful thing
in the world is a match well made...

6
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:05,500
and a happy marriage
to you both.

7
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:10,171
Thank you, Emma. Your painting
grows more accomplished every day.

8
00:03:10,246 --> 00:03:12,578
You are very kind,
but it would be all the better...

9
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:15,413
if I practiced my drawing
more as you urged me.

10
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,419
It's very beautiful.

11
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:19,148
I should never take side
against you, Miss Woodhouse,

12
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:21,156
but your friend is right.

13
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:23,624
It is indeed a job well done.

14
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:27,459
A job well done, Mr. Elton,
was yours in performing the ceremony.

15
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,624
Must the church be
so drafty, Mr. Elton ?

16
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,964
It is very difficult
to surrender the soul...

17
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:35,197
when one is worried
about one's throat.

18
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:38,365
Perhaps some tea and cake
would revive you, Mr. Woodhouse ?

19
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:42,275
Miss Taylor, surely you're
not serving cake at your wedding ?

20
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:46,679
Far too rich. You put us all at peril.
And I am not alone in feeling so.

21
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,651
Where is Mr. Perry, the apothecary ?
He will support me.

22
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:53,314
He is over there, Mr. Woodhouse,
having some cake.

23
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,450
What ?

24
00:03:56,526 --> 00:04:00,257
I have to take Father home.
But dear Miss Taylor--

25
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,264
Oh, no !

26
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:07,167
You are "Dear Miss Taylor" no more !
You are dear Mrs. Weston now.

27
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:10,229
And how happy
this must make you.

28
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:13,173
Such happiness this brings
to all of us.

29
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:15,177
My dear Emma !

30
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:29,853
[ Woodhouse ] Poor Miss Taylor.
She was so happy here.

31
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:34,022
Why should she give up being
your governess only to be married ?

32
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:37,156
I am grown now.

33
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:40,396
She cannot put up
with my ill humors forever.

34
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,837
- She must wish for children of her own.
- You have no ill humors.

35
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:47,035
Your own mother,
God rest her,

36
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,374
could be no more real
than Miss Taylor.

37
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:53,405
Can she truly wish to give life
to a mewling infant...

38
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:57,249
who will import disease
each time it enters the house ?

39
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,348
No ! I said poor Miss Taylor
and poor, indeed, she is.

40
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:07,055
[ Man ] As an old friend of the family
I had to ask as soon as I got back:

41
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,462
Who cried the most
at the wedding ?

42
00:05:09,532 --> 00:05:11,727
[ Chuckling ]

43
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:15,293
And how is my sister ? ls your brother
giving her the respect...

44
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:17,737
we Woodhouse ladies deserve ?

45
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:21,504
Poor lsabella.
She was the first to leave me.

46
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:24,877
No doubt, that is where
Miss Taylor got the notion to go.

47
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:27,439
Don't be too hard
on Miss Taylor.

48
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:30,315
It must be easier for her to have
only one to please than two.

49
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:33,355
Especially when one of us
is such a troublesome creature.

50
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:36,824
- Yes, I am... most troublesome.
- [ Giggles ]

51
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:40,590
Dear Papa,
I could never mean you.

52
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:43,860
Mr. Knightley loves
to find fault with me, that's all.

53
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:45,901
It's his idea of a joke.

54
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,802
I'm practically a brother
to you, Emma.

55
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:51,602
Is it not a brother's job
to find fault with his sister ?

56
00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:53,642
But where is the fault with you ?

57
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,010
Emma bears it well. But she is
most sorry to lose Miss Taylor.

58
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:01,107
We would not like Emma so well
as we do if she did not miss her friend.

59
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:03,015
Thank you.

60
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,646
I shall miss her so.

61
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:08,156
I do not know what
I shall do without her.

62
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,658
- She's not far.
- Almost half a mile !

63
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:12,888
Her obligations are there now.

64
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:15,795
She cannot sit and talk
with me in the old way,

65
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:19,494
or walk with me,
or urge me to better myself.

66
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:23,096
That should not matter as you
always did just as you pleased.

67
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:26,903
Yes. But I shall
miss her urging me.

68
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:30,673
She was as selfless a friend
as I have ever had.

69
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:33,181
I hope to say someday I have done
half as much for someone...

70
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:35,183
as Mrs. Weston did for me.

71
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:37,981
You must be happy
that she settled so well.

72
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:39,487
[ Emma ]
lndeed !

73
00:06:39,556 --> 00:06:42,821
One matter of joy in this
is that I made the match myself.

74
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:45,053
People said Mr. Weston
would never marry again.

75
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:47,358
- And what a triumph.
- Triumph ?

76
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,991
- You made a lucky guess.
- Have you never known
the triumph of a lucky guess ?

77
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,001
Had I not promoted
Mr. Weston's visits...

78
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:55,230
and given encouragement
where encouragement was needed,

79
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:57,569
we might not have had
a wedding today.

80
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,973
Then please, my dear,
encourage no one else.

81
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:03,604
Marriage is so disrupting
to one's social circle.

82
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,614
Only one more, Papa.

83
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:08,378
When Mr. Elton
joined their hands today,

84
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:12,478
he looked very much as if he would like
the same kind office performed for him.

85
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:14,045
[ Sighs ]

86
00:07:14,123 --> 00:07:17,559
Invite him for dinner.
That is kindness enough.

87
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:22,189
Mr. Elton is a man of 26.
He knows how to take care of himself.

88
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:25,564
One does not like to generalize about so
many people all at once, Mr. Knightley,

89
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:28,536
but you may be sure that men
know nothing about their hearts...

90
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:31,938
whether they be six and twenty
or six and eighty.

91
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:33,976
Excepting you, of course,
Father.

92
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:36,477
[ Chuckles ]

93
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:39,014
No.

94
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:42,643
Mr. Elton will be the next person
to benefit from my help.

95
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:45,119
[ Knightley ]
Poor Miss Taylor, indeed !

96
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:47,816
It is Mr. Elton
who deserves our pity.

97
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,017
[ Chuckling ]

98
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:56,058
[ Emma ]
Mr. Elton !

99
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,735
Welcome to our party.

100
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:02,327
Miss Woodhouse, thank you indeed
for including me.

101
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:06,535
A party is a party.
But a party on a summer's eve, mmm !

102
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:09,373
It relieves my mind
very much that you are here.

103
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:13,472
For there is someone new in our group.
Her name is Harriet Smith.

104
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:16,382
And she is a former pupil
of Mrs. Goddard's.

105
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,613
I had never met Miss Smith
before this evening...

106
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:21,248
and I'm already struck
by her charm.

107
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:24,122
I wondered
if I might ask you...

108
00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:27,594
to make certain she is at ease
throughout the evening.

109
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:30,792
If helping Miss Smith
would help Miss Woodhouse,

110
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:33,199
then I'm happy
to be of service.

111
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:35,499
Come.
I shall make the introduction.

112
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:37,869
Miss Woodhouse,
we come quite overpowered.

113
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,001
Oh, Mrs. Bates, Miss Bates.
So happy you could come.

114
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:44,103
[ Miss Bates ]
No ! We are the happy ones.

115
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,705
W-Well, how do you do,
Mr. Elton ?

116
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:49,775
We are the happy ones,
not only to be here tonight,

117
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:52,514
but for the beautiful
hindquarter of pork you sent us.

118
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:56,786
It has been heaven itself. What
a happy porker it must have come from !

119
00:08:56,859 --> 00:09:00,192
We're so obliged
for your sending it to us.

120
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:03,061
Pork ! And we're so obliged
for your having us tonight.

121
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:06,898
Very much indeed. I was
just saying to Mother, we should
be obliged and indeed we are.

122
00:09:06,969 --> 00:09:10,132
Oh, doesn't your hair look pretty ?
Just like an angel.

123
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:12,697
Angel, Mother !

124
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:16,074
Oh, speaking of angels,
Mr. Elton,

125
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:19,137
your sermon on Daniel in the lion's den
was so inspiring.

126
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:24,380
So powerful in all its particulars.
It left us speechless.

127
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:28,948
Quite speechless, I tell you.
We have not stopped talking of it since.

128
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:31,255
Isn't this a lovely party ?

129
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:34,854
Lovely ! Lovely ! Lovely !

130
00:09:34,931 --> 00:09:38,423
Where will you live now that
you've completed your education ?

131
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:41,368
Mrs. Goddard has been kind enough
to let me stay on with her.

132
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:45,271
- She's a great help to me.
If you'll excuse me.
- [ Woodhouse ] Mrs. Goddard.

133
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:50,040
- Mr. Knightley.
- Ah, Emma. I wondered where you were.

134
00:09:50,113 --> 00:09:54,607
But now I see you've been hard at work
making Mr. Elton comfortable.

135
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:56,709
Yes, but I've been remiss
in doing the one thing...

136
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:58,720
that shall bring him
the greatest enjoyment.

137
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:00,915
[ Emma ]
Mr. Elton.

138
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,551
May I present Miss Smith ?

139
00:10:08,464 --> 00:10:11,490
Any friend of Miss Woodhouse is--

140
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:23,634
Mr. Weston, have you had
any news of your son ?

141
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:25,544
Oh, indeed.

142
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:29,381
Miss Smith, I was married
many years ago...

143
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,852
to a woman whose life
was lost to illness...

144
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:35,982
just three years after
the birth of our son, Frank.

145
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:39,494
As I could not see to my business
and care for the infant,

146
00:10:39,562 --> 00:10:42,656
I allowed him to be brought up
by my wife's brother...

147
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:44,666
and his wife, the Churchills.

148
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:47,430
He lives in London now,
a young man,

149
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:49,437
and has never been here.

150
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:53,236
His aunt is not well and she
does not care to be without him.

151
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:56,437
His coming would be the final blessing
for our marriage.

152
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:59,538
How lucky to have been
twice blessed in marriage.

153
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:02,277
It has been my belief
that one loves only once.

154
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:05,013
I'm happy to be wrong.

155
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,681
[ Weston ]
Not so happy as l, Miss Smith.

156
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:11,693
I had the most pleasing letter from him
on the occasion of our marriage.

157
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:13,991
I have it here if anyone
would care to see it.

158
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:18,625
A most charming and kindly letter.
Don't you think so, Mother ?

159
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:21,636
Have, have you ever read
such a letter, Mr. Knightley ?

160
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:24,400
Do you know, this... this reminds me
of Jane's style somewhat.

161
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:26,873
It's a very delicate style
which is more usual in a woman,

162
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:28,877
but a good sign in a man,
I think.

163
00:11:28,945 --> 00:11:30,970
Nicely expressed.

164
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:36,814
But it sounds as though he eats
a worrisome amount of custard.

165
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:39,946
It's not merely
the feeling in it.

166
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:42,820
The penmanship
is so confident.

167
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:46,157
-Isn't Miss Smith delightful ?
-I watched her with continuous pleasure.

168
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:50,757
She is uncertain in these surroundings,
yet I thought perhaps...

169
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:55,668
I could be of service to her, undertake
her introduction into Highbury society.

170
00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:57,899
I could never presume
to guide her as you did me.

171
00:11:57,974 --> 00:11:59,407
Oh !

172
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:01,875
But I might be able to share
a little of what I know.

173
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:04,139
She could ask
for nothing better.

174
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:07,182
Come, Mr. Weston,
I must write to your son.

175
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:11,245
Good night, Mr. Woodhouse.

176
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,254
[ Weston ]
Good night, Mr. Woodhouse.

177
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:15,586
Good night, Emma.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

178
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:21,153
- Good night, Miss Taylor.
- Good night, Mrs. Weston, Mr. Weston.

179
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,289
[ Weston ]
Good night.

180
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:27,325
Poor Miss Taylor.
She so obviously wanted to stay.

181
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:34,870
How interesting, Miss Smith. And what
kind of people are your parents ?

182
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:36,912
I do not know.

183
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:41,643
Mrs. Goddard has said that I cannot
know them and so I have left it at that.

184
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:45,084
Because of her attentions
over the years, Mrs. Goddard
has been my true guardian.

185
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:48,282
[ Gasps ] Hurry along, dear.
It's Miss Bates coming.

186
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:50,552
[ Emma ]
As it is Tuesday...

187
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:52,958
she will have a letter
from her niece Jane Fairfax,

188
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:54,963
and she will want to
read us every word.

189
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:59,092
- Oh, I do not know Miss Fairfax.
- There's not much to be said for her.

190
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:01,636
When pressed,
I say she is elegant.

191
00:13:01,704 --> 00:13:03,797
[ Miss Bates Giggles ]

192
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:07,309
[ Miss Bates Chatting ]

193
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:11,437
[ Harriet ]
Besides you and Mrs. Goddard,

194
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:15,507
the only other people I know here
are the Martins of Abbey Mill Farm.

195
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:20,817
Mrs. Martin had two parlors
and an upper maid and eight cows !

196
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,054
Mr. Martin used to cut fresh flowers
every day. [ Gasps ]

197
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:29,029
[ Emma ] How lucky for Mrs. Martin
to have such an agreeable husband !

198
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:33,865
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, Mr. Martin
is not her husband. He is her son.

199
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:37,394
Ahh ! I see.

200
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:40,772
And he is...

201
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,970
unmarried.

202
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:45,445
Mmm. Though
I cannot understand why.

203
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:48,745
He seems perfect
in every particular.

204
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:52,015
He brought me walnuts once,
and went three miles to get them...

205
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:54,750
just because he heard me
say I liked them.

206
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:57,315
Wasn't that kind ?
[ Gasps ]

207
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,290
[ Emma ] Tell me more about Mr. Martin.
Is he a man of information ?

208
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:07,859
[ Harriet ] Oh, yes.
He reads the agricultural reports.

209
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:11,873
And I recommended he read The Romance
of the Forest, and he said he would.

210
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:14,000
And what sort of looking man
is he ?

211
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:17,477
Mmm. I thought him
very plain at first,

212
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:19,776
but I do not think so now.

213
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:21,783
Have you never seen him
when he is in town ?

214
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:23,478
A family like the Martins...

215
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:26,043
are precisely the sort of people
with whom I have nothing to do.

216
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:29,285
A degree or two lower, and I might
be useful to their families.

217
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:31,326
But a farmer
needs none of my help...

218
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:34,955
and is therefore as much
above my notice as he is below it.

219
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:38,023
- In fact--
- Miss Woodhouse, there he is now !

220
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:45,497
- How do I look ?
- Fine, dear.

221
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:47,906
Good enough I'm sure
for Mr. Martin.

222
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:50,639
Good day. This is a bit
of a chance, isn't it ?

223
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:53,910
Good day, Mr. Martin. Miss Woodhouse,
may I present Mr. Martin ?

224
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:58,010
- This is Miss Woodhouse.
- Good day. How do you do ?

225
00:14:58,087 --> 00:15:02,251
Oh. Were you able to find
The Romance of the Forest ?

226
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:05,259
Oh, blast ! I forgot.

227
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:07,454
But I go again tomorrow,

228
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,159
and I will make every effort
to get that thought into my head.

229
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:13,167
How's your mother ?

230
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:16,033
[ Thinking ] Really, Harriet,
we can do better than this.

231
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:20,239
[ Emma ]
lf you pull this way, dear,

232
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:22,971
you'll find it makes
a neater stitch.

233
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,879
Of course !

234
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:33,778
May I ask what you thought
of my friend, Robert Martin ?

235
00:15:33,856 --> 00:15:35,881
Well, dear,

236
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,984
I imagined him
a degree nearer gentility.

237
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:44,460
True. He's not so genteel
as Mr. Knightley, but--

238
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:45,966
No !

239
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:48,663
Not one in a hundred men
has "gentleman"...

240
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:51,672
so plainly written across him
as Mr. Knightley.

241
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,269
But let us judge him next to
another man. Oh, say... Mr. Elton.

242
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:59,507
Mr. Elton is a fine man.

243
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:02,312
Thoughtful in ways
Mr. Martin can never be.

244
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:05,319
Miss Woodhouse, whatever his faults,
Mr. Martin is thoughtful.

245
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:07,082
I see.

246
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:11,820
Did he take your advice and get
the book you asked him to read ?

247
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:16,128
Um--

248
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,463
Well... no.

249
00:16:19,535 --> 00:16:21,867
Yes.

250
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:23,962
Yes !

251
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:26,439
I wonder that he
did not remember it.

252
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:28,909
Oh, well.

253
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:35,676
Mr. Elton said something very kind
about you the other day.

254
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:39,313
- Can you not tell me what it was ?
- Oh !

255
00:16:39,388 --> 00:16:43,552
It is not my place to intrude
in personal matters.

256
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,134
But, as your friend, I could
make an exception if you wish.

257
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,742
[ Elton ] Miss Smith
was always a beautiful creature.

258
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:11,047
But the attractions
you have added are far superior.

259
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,452
Oh, I have done very little.

260
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:15,922
If it were admissible
to contradict a lady--

261
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:19,188
I cannot take credit for her beauty,
nor her sweetness, nor--

262
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:23,527
An idea has just dropped into my mind,
surely from heaven itself.

263
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,295
What if you were to exercise
your artistic talents...

264
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:28,734
and draw a portrait
of Miss Smith ?

265
00:17:28,804 --> 00:17:30,999
How I would love
to watch you draw her.

266
00:17:31,073 --> 00:17:33,633
Mr. Elton, my skills
are slender indeed,

267
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:36,371
and we must not forget
how shy Miss Smith is.

268
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:37,878
Oh.

269
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:41,883
Do you think it would help
if I asked her to pose ?

270
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:55,593
Oh, Miss Woodhouse,
may I look, please ?

271
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:58,428
I cannot wait another second.

272
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:05,629
Incredible.

273
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:09,474
You have expressed her
completely.

274
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:11,570
Mr. Elton, really !

275
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:13,808
You exaggerate.

276
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:17,318
[ Elton ]
lndeed, I do not. Nor cannot.

277
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,786
The reason I have not done
a portrait in so long...

278
00:18:19,855 --> 00:18:22,119
is because the spouse
always complains.

279
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:26,787
As there are no husbands or wives here,
I trust I may proceed safely.

280
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:33,258
No husbands or wives...
at present, Miss Woodhouse.

281
00:18:40,843 --> 00:18:43,607
You've made her too tall.

282
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:50,282
It... may not be Miss Smith's height
in terms of measurement,

283
00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:53,082
but it is surely the height
of her character.

284
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,018
My dear, I would paint
a shawl on her...

285
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:06,557
as one can't help feeling
that she will catch cold.

286
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:09,866
Otherwise,
it is quite splendid.

287
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:12,304
It only wants a suitable frame.

288
00:19:12,374 --> 00:19:14,899
We will have to get it to London.

289
00:19:14,977 --> 00:19:18,276
Might I be entrusted
with such a commission ?

290
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:21,578
I would be gratified
more than words can express.

291
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:29,183
[ People Chatting, Cows Mooing,
Sheep Bleating ]

292
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:33,693
[ Tapping ]

293
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:50,336
He wants to marry me !
Would you mind reading this ?

294
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:54,212
Certainly not !
I cannot believe Mr. Elton proposed !

295
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:58,379
- He surely is--
- Not Mr. Elton. Mr. Martin, my friend !

296
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:07,862
Is it a good letter
or too... short ?

297
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,955
It is a good letter !

298
00:20:10,032 --> 00:20:12,865
One of his sisters
must have helped him.

299
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:15,870
Yet, it is not in the style
of a woman.

300
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:19,704
Well, it is a good letter,
and you must answer it immediately.

301
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:22,573
He must have his disappointment
and move on.

302
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:26,546
Well, you think
I should refuse him ?

303
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:30,107
You did not plan to return an answer
favorable to this claim ?

304
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:32,483
No, I did not.

305
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:35,455
That is, I did not mean--

306
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:39,517
Um, well... I was not sure.
That is why I came to you.

307
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:42,894
- It's not my place to intrude !
- I depend so on what you think.

308
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:46,196
I would not advise you
for the world !

309
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,972
If you prefer Mr. Martin to every
other person you know, or may ever know,

310
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,100
if you think him the most agreeable man
you have ever been...

311
00:20:55,177 --> 00:20:59,375
or ever will be in company with,
then why should you hesitate ?

312
00:21:02,151 --> 00:21:07,088
But if you'll not influence me,
I must do as well as I can by myself.

So--

Well, I am determined to.

315
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:18,292
And I have really almost
made up my mind to...

316
00:21:20,402 --> 00:21:23,894
refuse Mr. Martin ?

317
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:26,372
Oh, do you think that's right
or wrong ? ls it wrong ?

318
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:30,435
Now that you have decided, I will share
the feelings I kept you in suspense of.

319
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:32,742
I think you are perfectly right.

320
00:21:32,815 --> 00:21:35,375
Yes. But--

321
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:38,249
Oh, dear, it will make
his mother and sisters most unhappy.

322
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,515
Let us think of
other mothers and sisters...

323
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:43,217
who may be more cheerfully
employed at this moment.

324
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:47,023
I believe Mr. Elton is showing your
picture to his mother and sisters...

325
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:51,828
telling them how the subject
is more beautiful than the portrait.

326
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,768
If he shows it, I am sure
it is only to praise your artistry.

327
00:21:55,838 --> 00:21:59,274
If you are sure,
then you are surely wrong.

328
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:02,538
By showing it to them,
he is revealing his deeper intentions...

329
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:06,274
which may produce a letter
of his own.

330

I have reason to believe
that Harriet Smith will soon receive...

339
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:38,541
an offer of marriage from a man
desperately in love with her.

340
00:22:38,614 --> 00:22:40,707
Robert Martin.

341
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,017
He came here two evenings ago
to consult about it.

342
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:47,715
He's a tenant, you know,
and a good friend.

343
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:51,452
He asked whether it would be
imprudent of him to settle so early.

344
00:22:51,527 --> 00:22:54,690
Whether she was too young
or whether he was beneath her.

345
00:22:54,763 --> 00:22:58,130
Better questions for Mr. Martin
I could not have chosen myself.

346
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:03,804
I never hear better sense from anyone
than from Robert Martin.

347
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:07,000
He proved he could afford
to marry,

348
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:10,374
and I said
he could not do better.

349
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:13,141
No, indeed, he could not.

350
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:18,886
Come. I will tell you
something in return.

351
00:23:18,954 --> 00:23:21,514
- He wrote to Harriet yesterday.
- Oh, yes ?

352
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,219
Yes. He was refused.

353
00:23:25,294 --> 00:23:27,728
I'm not sure I understand.

354
00:23:27,796 --> 00:23:30,492
He asked and she refused.

355
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:35,227
Then she is a greater simpleton
than I believed.

356
00:23:35,304 --> 00:23:38,432
The most incomprehensible
thing in the world to a man...

357
00:23:38,507 --> 00:23:40,907
is a woman who rejects
his offer of marriage.

358
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:43,467
I do not comprehend it
because it is madness.

359
00:23:43,545 --> 00:23:47,948
- I hope you're wrong !
- I could not be. I saw her answer.

360
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:50,143
You saw her answer ?

362
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:56,816
You wrote her answer,
didn't you ?

363
00:23:56,892 --> 00:23:59,292
If I did,
I would have done no wrong.

364
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:01,659
He is not Harriet's equal.

365
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,925
- I agree, he is not her equal.
- Good.

366
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:07,628
He is her superior
in sense and situation.

367
00:24:07,703 --> 00:24:11,867
What are Harriet Smith's claims
of birth or education...

368
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,340
that make her higher
than Robert Martin ?

369
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:18,004
She is the natural daughter
of nobody knows whom.

370
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,346
The advantage of the match
was entirely on her side.

373
00:24:28,223 --> 00:24:30,555
It would be a degradation
for her to marry a person...

374
00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:32,856
whom I could not admit
as my own acquaintance.

375
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:36,455
A degradation ?
For illegitimacy and ignorance...

376
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:38,931
to marry to a respected,
intelligent farmer ?

377
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:41,367
She is a gentleman's daughter.

378
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:45,600
Whoever her parents, they made no plans
to introduce her into good society.

379
00:24:45,674 --> 00:24:50,134
She was left with Mrs. Goddard
for an indifferent education.

380
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:53,613
Her friends evidently thought this
was good enough for her, and it was.

381
00:24:53,682 --> 00:24:56,515
And she thought so too
until you began to puff her up !

Hmm. You dismiss her beauty
and good nature.

Yet I would be very much mistaken
if your sex in general...

385

does not think those claims
the highest a woman could possess.

00:30:00,388 --> 00:30:02,481
I am sorry
I was not more help.

457
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:05,321
I'm always afraid I will somehow
make a sick person worse.

[ Gasps ] Look, Harriet.
Mr. Elton's house.

461
00:30:18,974 --> 00:30:23,775
[ Sighs ] Oh, pity I cannot
contrive a reason for us to go in.

462
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,173
I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse,
that you're not married.

463
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,844
I have no inducements
to marry.

464
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,252
I lack neither fortune
nor position,

465
00:30:34,322 --> 00:30:39,521
and never could I be so important
in a man's eyes as I am in my father's.

466
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:41,892
But to be an old maid
like Miss Bates.

467
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:43,954
She is a poor old maid,

468
00:30:44,032 --> 00:30:47,468
and it is only poverty
which makes celibacy contemptible.

469
00:30:47,535 --> 00:30:51,494
A single woman of good fortune
is always respectable.

to let me join her.

Well, she seemed to have
the chills, so Miss Woodhouse--

Watched...

486
00:31:46,728 --> 00:31:50,186
as Harriet tucked
that poor lady in,

and her kind nature.

Oh, well,

- [ Elton ] Don't be so modest.
- [ Harriet ] Um, well,

492
00:32:11,786 --> 00:32:14,949
- I heated some--
- Soup ?

00:32:15,023 --> 00:32:18,151
- Yes, soup.
- Oh, dear ! Oh !

and I will rejoin you as soon as I can.

[ Harriet ] Well, after having
fed her the soup, I lifted her up,

Good afternoon.
Where are you off to ?

To town, ma'am,

Dear, must we walk
so quickly ?

If you accepted adults with
as little whim as you do these children,

How fascinating that
any discordancy between us...

must always arise
from my being wrong.

Not fascinating,
but true.

522
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:54,385
Perhaps it has something to do
with the gap in our ages.

523
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:56,923
I was 16 years old
when you were born.

Undoubtedly
you're my superior then.

But hasn't the lapse of 21 years
closed the gap ?

00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,794

She will be missed
at every moment.

547
00:35:40,328 --> 00:35:45,095
However, I feel,
and I hope you will concur...

548
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,430
that small parties are the best.

549
00:35:47,502 --> 00:35:49,800
I would rather fall short by two
than exceed by two.

550
00:35:49,871 --> 00:35:52,772
And how fortunate...

551
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,809
that the snow comes now
instead of yesterday when it might
have made our party impossible.

552
00:35:55,877 --> 00:36:00,337
Now that would have been a real cause
for sadness, would it not ?

- Yes, would you like a whiskey ?
- Not at the moment.

- The letter arrived today.

And on the opening we had the most
wonderful surprise. Frank said--

Some of the other ladies were saying
they were not warm enough.

I am quite comfortable.
Yes.

I saw how close you were to the fire and
thought perhaps you might be too warm.

Mr. Elton, I am in
the perfect state of warmness.

[ Weston ] At first
I could not believe it,

566
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:55,032
so I asked Mrs. Weston
to read the letter herself...

567
00:36:55,103 --> 00:36:59,233
to make sure I was not dreaming,
but indeed Frank said--

568
00:36:59,307 --> 00:37:02,105
Miss Woodhouse, is there
any effort I might make...

569
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:04,644
on behalf of your father's comfort ?

570
00:37:04,712 --> 00:37:08,705
You are very kind, but I can only
imagine that he's quite comfortable.

00:37:08,783 --> 00:37:11,411
Thank you for being
so thoughtful.

572
00:37:11,486 --> 00:37:16,150
No. Thank you
for thinking I am thoughtful.

573
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:20,459
I wondered if perhaps...

574
00:37:20,528 --> 00:37:24,020
you might be so kind
as to bring me some punch ?

575
00:37:24,098 --> 00:37:27,329
I only hope I can complete
the task quickly enough.

if I knew that you had hurried.

your attention earlier...

with others so desirous
of your company,

but I wanted to tell you
that Frank is coming at last.

583
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:53,555
I so look forward
to meeting him,

584
00:37:53,628 --> 00:37:55,653
that is if you can bear
to share him.

585
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,598
That is if his aunt will share him
with us. That's what this depends on.

586
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:02,227
She has said yes,
but has not given a date.

587
00:38:02,303 --> 00:38:06,000
Very prudent. This weather is by no
means clement for the traveler abroad.

Oh, no. No, no, no.

- I hope I'm not intruding.
- No.

But I cannot stop thinking
of Miss Smith's condition.

591
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:27,693
She will be happy to know
of your concern.

592
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:29,730
How could I
not be concerned ?

593
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:33,392
The whole situation
is most alarming.

594
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:35,595
There is nothing worse
than a sore throat.

595
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,070
Its effects
are exceedingly bleak.

596
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:40,073
And that is why I must,

597
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:42,336
in the presence of your friend,
ask you to stop visiting her.

598
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,742
- What ?
- You are putting yourself at risk...

599
00:38:44,812 --> 00:38:47,110
and we cannot allow that,
can we, Knightley ?

- I mean, is this fair ?

to complain ?

00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:13,673
Come, Mr. Woodhouse.
Let's wrap you up warmly.

608
00:39:28,923 --> 00:39:32,120
- Certainly the weather has--
- Miss Woodhouse, please !

609
00:39:32,193 --> 00:39:35,026
- Fate has left us alone for a reason.
- Release my hand !

610
00:39:35,096 --> 00:39:38,224
I do not seize your hand so much as
the opportunity to declare that l--

611
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:42,201
- Good heavens, go back !
- Please.

612
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,738
I am hoping--

613
00:39:44,805 --> 00:39:47,433
No, fearing--

614
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,001
Ready to die
if you refuse me.

615
00:39:51,078 --> 00:39:53,046
Surely my ardent attachment
to you,

616
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:56,379
my love and passion cannot help
but have made an impression, and now--

617
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:59,817
- Mr. Elton, this is l, Miss Woodhouse.
- Mm-hmm.

618
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:02,321
The party spirit
has confused you.

619
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:05,689
I am happy to deliver
your message to Miss Smith.

620
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,321
- You must direct no more of it to me.
- Miss Smith ?

621
00:40:09,397 --> 00:40:13,026
What sort of message would I want
to send to her ? [ Laughing ]

622
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,898
- Miss Smith ?
- Mr. Elton, the wine has weakened you.

623
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:19,872
If the wine has had any effect,
it has been to strengthen my will
to tell you I love you !

624
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:22,774
My astonishment is beyond
anything I can express.

625
00:40:22,843 --> 00:40:26,006
For you to address me in this manner
after your behavior to Miss Smith--

626
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,344
I never cared whether Miss Smith
were dead or alive,

627
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,543
except that she was your friend.

628
00:40:30,618 --> 00:40:33,746
Who can think of Miss Smith
when Miss Woodhouse is near ?

629
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:36,051
Oh, no.

630
00:40:36,123 --> 00:40:40,423
Everything I have said or done
has been to prove my adoration for you.

631
00:40:40,494 --> 00:40:43,019
Why else would I go to London
to have your picture framed ?

632
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:45,224
[ Groans ]

633
00:40:51,706 --> 00:40:54,698
[ Whispering ]
Allow me to--

634
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:58,176
Allow me to interpret the silence.
You have long understood me.

635
00:40:58,245 --> 00:41:02,773
Sit back and kindly refrain
from the intimacy of whispering !

636
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:06,411
Am I to understand that you never sought
to recommend yourself to Miss Smith ?

637
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:10,082
How can you be surprised ? Did you
not understand the riddle I wrote ?

638
00:41:10,157 --> 00:41:12,387
That was for Harriet !

639
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,590
I most obviously did not address it
to her, and left it at your home.

640
00:41:16,664 --> 00:41:18,427
But-- Oh.

641
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:22,595
She's a very good sort of girl. I'm sure
there are men who would not object to--

642
00:41:24,138 --> 00:41:26,402
Everybody has their level.

643
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:28,999
But I need not so totally despair
of an equal alliance...

644
00:41:29,076 --> 00:41:31,203
as to address myself
to Miss Smith.

645
00:41:31,278 --> 00:41:33,178
- Sir.
- No !

646
00:41:33,247 --> 00:41:36,045
I sought to recommend myself
to you through those visits.

647
00:41:36,117 --> 00:41:38,585
Sir, I have seen you only
as the admirer of my friend.

648
00:41:38,653 --> 00:41:40,587
I cannot believe that.

649
00:41:40,655 --> 00:41:42,782
- It is well that the mistake
ends where it does.
- It is her mistake.

650
00:41:42,857 --> 00:41:45,417
- It is mine as well.
- She will manage her disappointment.

651
00:41:45,493 --> 00:41:47,757
Leave her out of it.

652
00:41:50,064 --> 00:41:52,931
How do you feel
about what I have said ?

653
00:41:54,402 --> 00:41:56,336
Mr. Elton,

654
00:41:56,404 --> 00:42:00,238
any hopes I had with regard to you
were for Harriet...

655
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:02,502
and Harriet alone.

656
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:37,438
- [ Door Opens, Closes ]
- My dear child.

657
00:42:39,747 --> 00:42:43,547
- What is it ?
- Oh, Miss Taylor-- Mrs. Weston.

658
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:51,418
There has been an overthrow of
everything I've been wishing for...

659
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:53,426
for Harriet and Mr. Elton.

660
00:42:54,628 --> 00:42:58,496
A development most unwelcome,
most painful.

661
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:02,093
Oh, dear !

662
00:43:02,169 --> 00:43:04,831
You will not believe it,
but...

663
00:43:04,905 --> 00:43:09,171
Mr. Elton,
now prepare yourself, but--

664
00:43:09,243 --> 00:43:12,542
Mr. Elton
is in love with you.

665
00:43:12,613 --> 00:43:14,581
You knew ?

666
00:43:14,648 --> 00:43:18,778
I had my suspicions,
but the party confirmed it.

667
00:43:18,853 --> 00:43:21,879
The worst of it is that I
persuaded her to care for him.

668
00:43:21,956 --> 00:43:27,121
Had I not done that, I could bear
anything, but it was I and I alone.

669
00:43:27,194 --> 00:43:30,595
- Even Mr. Knightley warned me.
- Mr. Knightley ?

670
00:43:30,664 --> 00:43:34,498
He was very cross because
I had urged Harriet to reject
a proposal from Robert Martin.

671
00:43:34,568 --> 00:43:37,628
- That nice farmer ?
- At least there I was right.

672
00:43:37,705 --> 00:43:39,866
Well done, Emma !

673
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,137
But otherwise I have made
a dreadful mistake.

674
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:48,842
I sought to bring two people together
and I shall never do it again. Never !

675
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:51,043
[ Sighs ]
That poor girl.

676
00:43:51,118 --> 00:43:53,484
She'll recover.
She's young.

677
00:43:53,554 --> 00:43:56,921
I wish I could ease the pain
of this for her, but I have no idea
who might be right for her.

678
00:43:56,991 --> 00:43:58,583
- William Coxe ?
- Emma !

679
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:00,183
Too pert ?

680
00:44:00,261 --> 00:44:04,197
My dear, you said you would never
try to match anyone again.

681
00:44:04,265 --> 00:44:07,723
Yes. Indeed.

682
00:44:07,802 --> 00:44:11,829
I just wish there were some way I
could soften the news when I tell her.

683
00:44:11,906 --> 00:44:15,933
I'm afraid the best way is always
the most straightforward.

684
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,001
Yes.

685
00:44:19,146 --> 00:44:23,014
I suppose I'll just say,
"Harriet--"

686
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:26,712
I have some news
about Mr. Elton.

687
00:44:28,222 --> 00:44:30,247
He--

688
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:35,220
- He's had to leave town.
- Why ?

689
00:44:35,296 --> 00:44:37,230
In his letter to Father,

690
00:44:37,298 --> 00:44:40,495
he wrote he is going to Bath
to relax and meet new people.

691
00:44:42,736 --> 00:44:46,729
And this brings me
to something most unpleasant.

692
00:44:46,807 --> 00:44:51,176
Miss Woodhouse, nothing you could
ever say would be unpleasant.

693
00:44:51,245 --> 00:44:56,512
This is, for I must acknowledge
myself grossly mistaken...

694
00:44:56,584 --> 00:45:00,953
on the one subject which
has occupied us for some time past.

695
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,983
Mr. Elton ?

696
00:45:10,598 --> 00:45:14,591
While expressing his fervent
admiration for you as a person,

697
00:45:14,668 --> 00:45:18,297
it is unhappily I
who have captured his fancy.

698
00:45:18,372 --> 00:45:20,499
Naturally I do not return
the feelings,

699
00:45:20,574 --> 00:45:22,769
but that does not make it
any less of an embarrassment.

700
00:45:22,843 --> 00:45:27,280
And I place the responsibility
for this directly on my own shoulders.

701
00:45:27,348 --> 00:45:29,282
Oh, no !

702
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:35,855
I have always felt that I did not
deserve Mr. Elton's affections...

703
00:45:35,923 --> 00:45:40,656
so I cannot blame him
for believing the same.

704
00:45:40,728 --> 00:45:43,026
And I could never blame you,

705
00:45:43,097 --> 00:45:47,124
for only so kind a friend would
have ever dreamed it possible.

706
00:45:48,903 --> 00:45:51,064
Harriet,

707
00:45:51,138 --> 00:45:55,438
I had always hoped that I might
have something to teach you.

708
00:45:55,509 --> 00:46:01,106
Now I see I should be lucky
to resemble you in any small way.

709
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:12,556
They have just been weaned.
I thought you might enjoy them.

710
00:46:12,626 --> 00:46:14,856
They cannot help
but lift the spirits.

711
00:46:14,929 --> 00:46:17,989
Do you suppose Mr. Elton is meeting
young ladies while he is away ?

712
00:46:18,065 --> 00:46:20,761
I do not know.
Feel her paws.

713
00:46:20,834 --> 00:46:23,394
I would not blame him.

714
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,461
I wonder when he will return.

715
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:30,238
Dear, you must try to empty your mind
of Mr. Elton, really.

716
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:35,044
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
It was kind of you to invite me.

717
00:46:35,115 --> 00:46:38,141
Look at her eyes !

718
00:46:40,788 --> 00:46:44,246
Mr. Elton had brown eyes too.

719
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,850
- [ Crying ]
- Oh ! Harriet,

720
00:46:47,928 --> 00:46:51,955
there is only one place I
can think of where you will not
be able to speak of Mr. Elton.

721
00:46:52,032 --> 00:46:53,966
Indeed, you may not
be able to speak at all.

722
00:46:54,034 --> 00:46:58,061
Oh, Miss Woodhouse,
what a special, special treat !

723
00:46:58,138 --> 00:47:03,667
It's so lovely of you to come
and visit us. Isn't it, Mother. Treat ?

724
00:47:03,744 --> 00:47:07,305
[ Miss Bates ] But the best of it is,
the best of it is...

725
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:10,817
that we were just speaking of a topic
that would interest you both.

726
00:47:10,884 --> 00:47:14,877
[ Thinking ] Please do not let it be
a letter from that ninny Jane Fairfax.

727
00:47:14,955 --> 00:47:19,449
[ Miss Bates ] Yes, here it is,
a letter from Mrs. Cole...

728
00:47:19,526 --> 00:47:21,960
who has news of Mr. Elton !
[ Giggles ]

729
00:47:22,029 --> 00:47:23,963
Um, now.

730
00:47:24,031 --> 00:47:27,000
Yes, here we are.
"He has been the toast...

731
00:47:27,067 --> 00:47:30,332
of every young lady's eye."

732
00:47:30,404 --> 00:47:32,668
[ Miss Bates ] Of course that can
be of no surprise to any of us.

733
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,676
Oh dear, Miss Smith, you look pale.
You must be hungry.

734
00:47:36,744 --> 00:47:40,043
Let me get you some cake.
Isn't it nice to have visitors, Mother ?

735
00:47:40,114 --> 00:47:43,914
[ Miss Bates Laughs ]
The most amusing thing just happened.

736
00:47:43,984 --> 00:47:48,614
Mother was asking about Jane Fairfax,
asking if there was any news from her,

737
00:47:48,689 --> 00:47:51,522
even though she said she knew
it was not Jane's day for writing.

738
00:47:51,592 --> 00:47:54,925
Remember, Mother ? Not Jane's day !
Oh, napkin. Sorry.

739
00:47:54,995 --> 00:47:58,829
You see, we always have a letter
from Jane on Tuesdays,

740
00:47:58,899 --> 00:48:02,391
and today, as you must know,
is Thursday.

741
00:48:02,469 --> 00:48:07,168
So I said, "Mother, we have had
a letter from Jane this very morning."

742
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:10,836
And Mother said,
"But it's Thursday !" [ Giggles ]

743
00:48:10,911 --> 00:48:14,472
Well, you see, Jane writes on Tuesdays
and this is Thursday.

744
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:18,644
And, um, I said,
"Upon my honor !"

745
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:20,983
[ Giggling ]

746
00:48:23,557 --> 00:48:26,219
Here you are, Miss-- Oh, napkin.
Sorry. There you are.

747
00:48:26,293 --> 00:48:31,424
And might you summarize the letter
in your own delightful words ?

748
00:48:31,498 --> 00:48:33,989
Oh, and cheat you out of the pleasure
of hearing it, Miss Woodhouse,

749
00:48:34,068 --> 00:48:36,002
as only Jane can put things ?

750
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:39,699
Upon my honor, I would not.
Where's that letter ? Yes, here it is.

751
00:48:39,773 --> 00:48:43,641
[ Miss Bates ]
Um, and now. Oh, yes.

752
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:47,111
The bad news is she has a cold.

753
00:48:47,181 --> 00:48:48,614
Oh, no !

754
00:48:48,682 --> 00:48:53,745
Oh, yes. But the good news
far outweighs it. Far, far, far !

755
00:48:53,821 --> 00:48:55,755
She is coming to visit !

756
00:48:55,823 --> 00:48:59,953
You must be here to help us with her,
Miss Woodhouse, when she comes...

757
00:49:00,027 --> 00:49:02,257
because it wouldn't
be a proper visit otherwise.

758
00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:06,732
You must sit right where you are.
And, and you must say--

759
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,566
We are so glad
to have you with us.

760
00:49:10,637 --> 00:49:12,537
How were you able
to get away ?

761
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:15,074
The Campbells have gone
to lreland on a holiday.

762
00:49:15,142 --> 00:49:18,976
So I've come here, which
is better than any holiday.

763
00:49:20,581 --> 00:49:23,345
[ Thinking ] Mmm.
She is more giving than I expected.

764
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:26,944
Tell Miss Woodhouse
whom you saw in Weymouth.

765
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,615
Frank Churchill. That's whom she saw.
Mr. Frank Churchill !

766
00:49:30,691 --> 00:49:34,286
Oh, we hear much of him, but have
never seen him. Was he handsome ?

767
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:36,761
Many say he is.

768
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:40,493
- Was he agreeable ?
- He was in no way disagreeable.

769
00:49:40,567 --> 00:49:43,627
Was he a man of information ?

770
00:49:43,704 --> 00:49:46,138
All his statements
seemed correct.

771
00:49:46,206 --> 00:49:49,664
[ Thinking ]
I take it back. She is--

772
00:49:49,743 --> 00:49:52,143
Absolutely impossible !

773
00:49:52,212 --> 00:49:55,443
She wouldn't tell me anything
about Frank Churchill.

774
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,213
Why should you care so much
about Frank Churchill ?

775
00:50:00,287 --> 00:50:03,984
I was merely being sociable,
that's all, and she was not.

776
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:09,489
Perhaps you dislike her because
she divides our attentions from you.

777
00:50:09,563 --> 00:50:12,691
[ Laughs ] Really, Mr. Knightley,
you are so comical.

778
00:50:12,766 --> 00:50:16,133
You ought to perform
in the town square.

779
00:50:16,203 --> 00:50:19,604
Oh, I have some news.
And I know how you like news.

780
00:50:19,673 --> 00:50:23,074
Oh, yes !
I always like news.

781
00:50:23,143 --> 00:50:25,805
Mr. Elton
is going to marry.

782
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:34,314
I don't know what to say,
except that I am--

783
00:50:34,388 --> 00:50:37,323
In a state
of complete shock !

784
00:50:37,391 --> 00:50:39,416
- You've heard ?
- About what ?

785
00:50:39,493 --> 00:50:42,553
Oh ! Never mind.

786
00:50:42,629 --> 00:50:45,598
[ Harriet ]
I was on my way here for our visit.

787
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:50,035
It started raining, so I ducked
into Ford's to wait it out.

788
00:50:50,103 --> 00:50:52,936
- Miss Smith.
- Miss Smith.

789
00:50:53,006 --> 00:50:56,203
Good day, Mr. Ford,
Mr. Ford.

790
00:50:56,276 --> 00:50:59,143
[ Harriet Continues ] As I admired
some fabric, who should come in...

791
00:50:59,213 --> 00:51:03,115
but Elizabeth Martin
and her brother.

792
00:51:03,183 --> 00:51:07,176
I thought I should have fainted.
They saw me and began whispering.

793
00:51:07,254 --> 00:51:10,587
- [ Gasps ]
- And then, oh, Miss Woodhouse,

794
00:51:10,657 --> 00:51:16,220
I really could not believe this.
She came up to me and spoke ! She said--

795
00:51:16,296 --> 00:51:19,561
I'm sorry we never meet now.

796
00:51:19,633 --> 00:51:22,966
- And I said--
- You are too kind.

797
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:27,032
Then I saw that he,
Mr. Martin,

798
00:51:27,107 --> 00:51:30,543
my Mr. Martin,
was coming toward me.

799
00:51:30,611 --> 00:51:34,308
- Good day, Miss Smith.
- Good day, Mr. Martin.

800
00:51:34,381 --> 00:51:38,044
I managed to read The Romance
of the Forest. It was very good.

801
00:51:38,118 --> 00:51:42,282
Finally I said I had to go.
But then he followed me.

802
00:51:42,356 --> 00:51:44,824
I was not three steps outside
and he said--

803
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:46,950
Miss Smith !

804
00:51:49,196 --> 00:51:52,256
You better go
by Mr. Cole's stable.

805
00:51:52,332 --> 00:51:54,994
The near way is flooded.

806
00:51:56,203 --> 00:51:59,001
Thank you.

807
00:51:59,072 --> 00:52:02,974
[ Sighs ] Miss Woodhouse,
do talk and make me comfortable again.

808
00:52:03,043 --> 00:52:06,012
[ Thinking ] I suppose this
would not be the right time...

809
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,741
to mention that Mr. Elton
is engaged.

810
00:52:08,815 --> 00:52:11,477
This was awkward because
it was the first time...

811
00:52:11,551 --> 00:52:14,816
- you've seen Mr. Martin
since refusing his proposal.
- No.

812
00:52:14,888 --> 00:52:19,848
You, and I must say he,
behaved very well !

813
00:52:19,926 --> 00:52:23,123
Now, the kindest thing
you can do for yourself...

814
00:52:23,196 --> 00:52:27,758
is to put Mr. Martin
out of your head for good.

815
00:52:29,403 --> 00:52:31,564
Yes, I will.

816
00:52:33,206 --> 00:52:36,607
I shall do so immediately.

817
00:52:36,677 --> 00:52:39,475
- He's behind me now. [ Giggles ]
- Wonderful !

818
00:52:39,546 --> 00:52:42,140
I thought I might sketch the puppies.
Would you join me ?

819
00:52:42,215 --> 00:52:44,877
Oh, yes, please !

820
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:48,751
It was awfully kind of him
to warn me about the flooding.

821
00:52:48,822 --> 00:52:52,223
- Yes, dear.
- He got his coat wet
coming out to tell me.

822
00:52:52,292 --> 00:52:56,422
That's the coat Mrs. Martin
gave him for his birthday.

823
00:52:57,664 --> 00:53:00,360
I do hope he does not catch cold.

824
00:53:16,383 --> 00:53:19,147
[ Clanking Sound ]

825
00:53:21,355 --> 00:53:24,017
Oh, good heavens.

826
00:53:30,897 --> 00:53:32,922
[ Laughing ]

827
00:53:36,436 --> 00:53:39,701
Is your horse just washing his feet or
are there darker forces at work here ?

828
00:53:39,773 --> 00:53:43,539
[ Laughing ]
The latter, I'm afraid.

829
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:46,374
Something has happened
to the wheel and I cannot move.

830
00:53:46,446 --> 00:53:49,313
You'll just have to live here then.
Bye, bye.

831
00:53:58,325 --> 00:54:00,293
I suppose that won't do.

832
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,760
I'll help you home.

833
00:54:04,731 --> 00:54:08,667
Thank you so much, Mr.--

834
00:54:08,735 --> 00:54:10,726
Churchill.
Frank Churchill.

835
00:54:10,804 --> 00:54:14,535
A name I know as well as my own
so long I have heard it spoken.

836
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:16,974
Your father's wife
was my governess.

837
00:54:17,043 --> 00:54:19,568
Then you are Miss Woodhouse !

838
00:54:19,646 --> 00:54:22,979
How delightful.
I, I hear of nothing but you.

839
00:54:23,049 --> 00:54:26,075
The last I heard from Mrs. Weston,
you were not due 'til tomorrow.

840
00:54:26,153 --> 00:54:30,749
It is always a pleasure to come in on
one's friends before the lookout begins.

841
00:54:30,824 --> 00:54:33,315
I would not presume to do so
in most cases,

842
00:54:33,393 --> 00:54:35,861
but I felt in coming home,
I might be forgiven.

843
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:37,794
Then you have not seen them ?

844
00:54:37,864 --> 00:54:41,459
We shall have to go there first.
They will be overjoyed.

845
00:54:41,535 --> 00:54:44,595
Overjoyed, I think,
that we are both there together.

846
00:54:44,671 --> 00:54:46,696
As I am.

847
00:54:49,876 --> 00:54:52,572
Oh, Miss Woodhouse,
have you heard ?

848
00:54:52,646 --> 00:54:56,082
- Frank Churchill is here !
- Yes ! ln fact...

849
00:54:56,149 --> 00:54:58,117
- I met him yesterday.
- No ?

850
00:54:58,185 --> 00:55:00,244
Yes. He did me quite
a service when my horse--

851
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,788
Is he handsome ?
ls he everything everyone says he is ?

852
00:55:02,856 --> 00:55:06,348
I have not yet seen him myself,
though, um, Jane saw him...

853
00:55:06,426 --> 00:55:09,987
and she said he was
not at all unpleasant to look at.

854
00:55:10,063 --> 00:55:12,623
I suppose I shan't see him
until the Cole's party...

855
00:55:12,699 --> 00:55:15,031
which seems like
such an age from now.

856
00:55:15,101 --> 00:55:18,036
But I'm sure, simply sure,
will be upon us before...

857
00:55:18,104 --> 00:55:21,665
well, we are sufficiently prepared.
[ Giggles ]

858
00:55:21,741 --> 00:55:24,676
Has an invitation arrived
for a party at the Cole's ?

859
00:55:24,744 --> 00:55:26,678
No, thank heaven !

860
00:55:26,746 --> 00:55:30,807
The Coles are nice people, but we
should have to go outside to get there.

861
00:55:30,884 --> 00:55:33,751
Of course we shall have to decline
as they are beneath us.

862
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,448
But I don't wish them
to hope falsely.

863
00:55:42,629 --> 00:55:45,063
[ Footsteps ]

864
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:48,123
- Has James brought the letters yet ?
- I don't know.

865
00:55:48,201 --> 00:55:51,637
I never pay any attention
to the mail.

866
00:56:05,018 --> 00:56:07,316
Why do they not write ?

867
00:56:07,387 --> 00:56:09,651
Perhaps they know
I must reject them.

868
00:56:09,723 --> 00:56:11,850
Still, as close friends
of the Westons,

869
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:14,792
they should have the courtesy
to extend the invitation.

870
00:56:14,861 --> 00:56:18,388
Unless they don't want me.
But I cannot--

871
00:56:18,465 --> 00:56:22,526
Tell you how delighted I am
to have been invited, Mrs. Cole.

872
00:56:24,304 --> 00:56:27,603
- [ Churchill ] lsn't it handsome ?
- Thank you.

873
00:56:27,674 --> 00:56:30,802
But from today there's
a much prettier one in town.

874
00:56:30,877 --> 00:56:34,278
- It has been sent to Jane Fairfax.
- Really ? Who sent it to her ?

875
00:56:34,347 --> 00:56:38,681
That's the exciting part ! There was
no identification of the donor.

876
00:56:38,752 --> 00:56:42,051
- Must be from Colonel Campbell.
- Jane's parents died.

877
00:56:42,122 --> 00:56:45,649
And the Bates, of course, are quite
without the resources to, you know.

878
00:56:45,725 --> 00:56:47,989
And Colonel Campbell was
a great friend of her father's,

879
00:56:48,061 --> 00:56:50,222
so he and his family
have raised her.

880
00:56:50,297 --> 00:56:52,322
Well, then they must have sent it.

881
00:56:52,399 --> 00:56:56,358
Jane has just had a letter from them,
and not a word was said of it.

882
00:56:56,436 --> 00:56:58,370
Perhaps it's a surprise.

883
00:56:58,438 --> 00:57:01,669
We expect Miss Fairfax soon.
Perhaps she may know more.

884
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:05,644
Why do you smile ?

885
00:57:05,712 --> 00:57:08,044
I'm smiling because I wonder
if there's anyone else...

886
00:57:08,114 --> 00:57:11,277
whom we should suspect of being
Miss Fairfax's musical patron ?

887
00:57:11,351 --> 00:57:14,752
- Do you know her ?
- Oh, yes, she's very elegant. Yes.

888
00:57:14,821 --> 00:57:18,257
Colonel Campbell's daughter, Mrs. Dixon,
is Miss Fairfax's dearest friend,

889
00:57:18,325 --> 00:57:20,816
so perhaps Mrs. Dixon
sent the piano.

890
00:57:20,894 --> 00:57:22,862
Mrs. Dixon ?
That makes sense.

891
00:57:22,929 --> 00:57:25,762
As much sense do you think
as Mr. Dixon ?

892
00:57:25,832 --> 00:57:28,596
I cannot help suspecting that
after his proposal to Miss Campbell,

893
00:57:28,668 --> 00:57:31,136
a sweet
but rather a plain girl,

894
00:57:31,204 --> 00:57:34,173
Mr. Dixon fell in love with Miss Fairfax
who is, after all--

895
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,606
Very elegant, yes.
But what makes you say that ?

896
00:57:36,676 --> 00:57:38,667
Well, she must think so too.

897
00:57:38,745 --> 00:57:41,908
That is why she did not go
on the holiday with the Campbells.

898
00:57:41,982 --> 00:57:44,917
Instead she came here.
Do you see ?

899
00:57:44,985 --> 00:57:48,318
Now that Mr. Dixon has married into
the Campbells, he would have been there.

900
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:51,755
I think that in coming here,
Miss Fairfax was telling Mr. Dixon...

901
00:57:51,825 --> 00:57:53,793
that she wanted to forget him.

902
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:59,298
And I think with the pianoforte,
Mr. Dixon wasn't allowing her to.

903
00:57:59,366 --> 00:58:04,633
[ Mrs. Cole ] Mrs. Bates, Miss Bates,
do come in. Welcome to our house.

904
00:58:04,704 --> 00:58:06,638
Of course it's just a theory.

905
00:58:06,706 --> 00:58:10,802
But let us see how she reacts at some
time if we say the name, Mr. Dixon.

906
00:58:13,246 --> 00:58:18,775
My dear, do you know how Miss Bates
and Jane Fairfax came here tonight ?

907
00:58:18,852 --> 00:58:21,844
Mr. Knightley
sent his carriage.

908
00:58:21,921 --> 00:58:24,219
Well, yes, he's very kind.

909
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:27,782
You give him credit for more
disinterested benevolence than l.

910
00:58:27,861 --> 00:58:31,490
A suspicion has darted into my head
which I simply cannot get rid of.

911
00:58:31,564 --> 00:58:34,829
Mr. Knightley and
Jane Fairfax are a couple.

912
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:39,565
[ Laughs ] Mrs. Weston, do not
take to matchmaking. You do it ill.

913
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:43,405
Jane Fairfax and Mr. Knightley ?
Every feeling revolts !

914
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:45,444
- Apart from every other--
- [ Mrs. Weston ] Oh, my goodness !

915
00:58:45,512 --> 00:58:48,310
What if the pianoforte
is from Mr. Knightley ?

916
00:58:48,381 --> 00:58:53,341
You have taken up an idea and run wild
with it. He is not even with her.

917
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:56,878
[ Emma ]
She is with Frank, poor man.

918
00:58:56,956 --> 00:59:01,393
Perhaps the two of them stay apart
publicly to keep it a secret.

[ Gasps ] Hush, friend.
Here comes-- Mr. Cole !

920

Miss Woodhouse, would you do us
the honor of trying our pianoforte ?

921
00:59:09,936 --> 00:59:12,404
Oh.

922
00:59:12,472 --> 00:59:14,565
I fear I lack the talent.

923
00:59:14,641 --> 00:59:16,905
Perhaps I should ask
Miss Fairfax ?

you must forgive my intrusion,
but my aunt has become ill.

It is nothing serious,
but my presence might bring her solace.

01:03:33,266 --> 01:03:37,225
Therefore, I must return. And although
I expect my father at any moment,

984
01:03:37,303 --> 01:03:39,294
I could not leave
without stopping here.

Not even five minutes to spare for your
friends, Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates ?

- No. I stopped there on my way here.

After all their kindness,
I don't wish to slight them.

988
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:54,442
But it is not the Bates nor my aunt
that occupies my thoughts...

01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,454
as I prepare to leave.

990
01:03:56,522 --> 01:04:00,083
There is something much more personal
that I must say to you.

991
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:03,185
I think you can hardly be without
suspicion that I have developed...

992
01:04:03,262 --> 01:04:07,198
certain feelings for someone
of a most tender and devoted nature,

which so far
I have striven to hide.

Yet you have always made me feel
so wonderfully at ease,

since my very arrival...

01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:19,443
that it not longer seems honorable
to keep them from you.

In short, Miss Woodhouse,
I cannot help but say to you--

Well, he loves me.

He was on the verge of telling me
when his father burst in.

1005
01:04:50,176 --> 01:04:53,077
I felt listless after he left
and had some sort of headache,

1006
01:04:53,146 --> 01:04:56,343
so I must be in love as well.

1007
01:04:56,416 --> 01:05:00,147
I must confess I expected love
to feel somewhat different than this.

1008
01:05:01,821 --> 01:05:05,780
I may determine how deep a love
I feel through his absence.

1009
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:09,919
How I wish he would be here tomorrow

Don't tell me about Surrey ! I always
say it is "the garden of England."

Your father's health must be a great
drawback to your seeing the country.

Why does he not try Bath ?
It would do him the world of good !

He has... tried it before
without receiving any benefit.

1034
01:06:36,782 --> 01:06:39,751
Oh, it will do him good
if only to improve his spirits,

You must take him !
A line from me and...

1037
01:06:45,992 --> 01:06:48,893
you would have some of

And my particular friend there,
Mrs. Partridge--

1039
01:06:51,464 --> 01:06:54,729
Thank you, but our going to Bath
is out of the question.

1040
01:07:07,046 --> 01:07:11,039
Mrs. Elton, I have not
asked you if you are musical,

1041
01:07:11,117 --> 01:07:13,950
and that is because
your reputation has preceded you.

1042
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,453
Oh, well--

1043
01:07:15,521 --> 01:07:17,955
All the town knows
you are a superior performer.

1044
01:07:18,024 --> 01:07:20,720
- Well, I am dotingly fond of music.
- Yes, my wife--

1045
01:07:20,793 --> 01:07:24,024
And my friends say I'm not
entirely devoid of taste.

1046
01:07:24,096 --> 01:07:26,860
In fact, I told Mr. "E"
when he asked me to marry,

1047
01:07:26,933 --> 01:07:30,266
I said I did not have to have
two carriages as I did before,

1048
01:07:30,336 --> 01:07:32,668
and I could even accept
a smaller house.

1049
01:07:32,738 --> 01:07:35,400
My house before was
a good deal roomier, I assure you.

1050
01:07:35,474 --> 01:07:39,604
But, no, the world
is not necessary to me...

1051
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:44,275
because I am blessed
with so many resources... in here.

"But," said l, "without music
my life would be a blank."

1053
01:07:49,088 --> 01:07:51,716
In fact, you and I
must establish a musical club !

1054
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:54,521
We could have regular meetings
at your house or ours.

1055
01:07:54,594 --> 01:07:57,028
Because I don't want
to give up my talent.

1056
01:07:57,096 --> 01:07:59,462
- Do I ?
- Mrs. Elton,

1057
01:07:59,532 --> 01:08:02,660
I am certain it would take something
more dramatic than a change of towns...

1058
01:08:02,735 --> 01:08:05,465
to dislodge a thing
as great as your talent.

1059
01:08:05,538 --> 01:08:08,939
[ Laughing ] Oh, well,
I myself don't call it great.

1060
01:08:09,008 --> 01:08:13,035
I only know that
my friends think so.

1061
01:08:19,919 --> 01:08:22,979
- [ Clears Throat ]
- [ Sighs ]

1062
01:08:32,465 --> 01:08:34,763
Ooh ! Mmm.

1063
01:08:34,834 --> 01:08:36,768
We met the Westons.

1064
01:08:36,836 --> 01:08:39,999
Mmm, she is already
a favorite with me.

1065
01:08:40,072 --> 01:08:42,973
And I was astonished
that she was so ladylike !

1066
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:45,101
Was she not your governess ?

1067
01:08:45,177 --> 01:08:49,045
Mrs. Weston's modest propriety
makes her a model for any woman.

1068
01:08:49,115 --> 01:08:51,583
Do you know who came in
while we were there ?

1069
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:53,585
I cannot imagine.

1070
01:08:55,388 --> 01:08:57,982
Knightley.

1071
01:08:58,057 --> 01:08:59,684
Knightley ?

1072
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,853
Knightley !
Mr. "E's" friend.

1073
01:09:02,928 --> 01:09:06,193
Well, there's one friend
of whom he need not be ashamed.

1074
01:09:06,265 --> 01:09:08,256
Quite the gentleman.

1075
01:09:08,334 --> 01:09:10,802
[ Thinking ]
Knightley ?

1076
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:13,771
- Never seen him before
and she called him Knightley !
- I saw her at church.

1077
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:17,639
- She seemed--
- Vulgar ? Base ? Conceited ? Crass ?

1078
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:21,237
- How do you do, Mrs. Starr ?
- Good morning, Miss Woodhouse.

1079
01:09:21,314 --> 01:09:25,341
She actually seemed pleased to discover
that Mr. Knightley was a gentleman.

1080
01:09:25,418 --> 01:09:29,149
I doubt he'll return the compliment
and find her a lady.

1081
01:09:29,221 --> 01:09:32,418
- Mr. Simons, good morning.
- Morning, Miss Woodhouse.

1082
01:09:33,626 --> 01:09:37,323
She proposed that we form
a musical club.

1083
01:09:37,396 --> 01:09:39,830
Is it possible
that Mr. Elton met her...

1084
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:42,629
while doing charitable work
in a mental infirmary ?

1085
01:09:42,702 --> 01:09:44,670
[ Sighs ]

1086
01:09:44,737 --> 01:09:47,797
There is only one thing to do
with a person as impossible as she.

1087
01:09:47,873 --> 01:09:51,172
- What ?
- I must throw a party for her,

1088
01:09:51,243 --> 01:09:55,703
otherwise everyone will feel at once
how much I dislike her.

1089
01:09:55,781 --> 01:09:57,715
[ Sighs ]

1090
01:09:57,783 --> 01:09:59,717
We're so excited about the party.

1091
01:09:59,785 --> 01:10:03,881
Do you know whom I just adore ?

1092
01:10:03,956 --> 01:10:07,448
- Who I want to wrap up
and put in my pocket ?
- Knightley ?

1093
01:10:07,526 --> 01:10:10,586
Jane Fairfax ! Oh ! Ah !

1094
01:10:10,663 --> 01:10:12,790
I rave about her.

1095
01:10:12,865 --> 01:10:15,299
Do you know what
I admire most about her ?

1096
01:10:15,368 --> 01:10:19,236
She's timid.
I'm a great advocate for timidity.

1097
01:10:19,305 --> 01:10:22,331
But I daresay you know
the lines of the poet:

1098
01:10:22,408 --> 01:10:27,209
"Full many a flower
is born to blush unseen."

1099
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:30,737
We must not allow them
to be verified by sweet Jane.

1100
01:10:30,816 --> 01:10:33,876
There is no danger of that.
The Campbells take great care of her.

1101
01:10:33,953 --> 01:10:37,184
Whatever advantages she's got from the
Campbells have palpably come to an end.

1102
01:10:37,256 --> 01:10:40,885
But if you and I set the example,
many will follow.

1103
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,521
Oh, we live in a style which could not
make the addition of Jane Fairfax...

1104
01:10:44,597 --> 01:10:46,656
the least inconvenient.

1105
01:10:46,732 --> 01:10:48,700
I'm simply going to adopt her,

1106
01:10:48,768 --> 01:10:51,965
and I think that you
should do it with me.

1107
01:10:52,037 --> 01:10:54,232
[ Emma ]
For the first time in my life,

1108
01:10:54,306 --> 01:10:56,900
I felt sorry
for Jane Fairfax.

1109
01:10:56,976 --> 01:11:01,106
Whatever she may have done,
she does not deserve Mrs. Elton.

1110
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:04,115
Jane may be glad
of Mrs. Elton's attentions,

1111
01:11:04,183 --> 01:11:07,050
since they are available
from no one else.

1112
01:11:08,921 --> 01:11:12,618
She seems to receive
ample attention from you.

1113
01:11:12,691 --> 01:11:16,422
- Anyone may know my regard for her.
- Oh ?

1114
01:11:16,495 --> 01:11:20,124
- Do you know how high it is ?
- [ Clears Throat ]

1115
01:11:24,303 --> 01:11:28,103
Oh, so, you two
have been settling...

1116
01:11:28,174 --> 01:11:31,575
- that I should marry Jane Fairfax ?
- No !

1117
01:11:31,644 --> 01:11:35,307
You could not come and sit with us
if you were married.

1118
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:45,787
Jane Fairfax
is a very charming young woman.

1119
01:11:45,858 --> 01:11:49,919
But she lacks an open temper,
which a man wishes for in a wife.

1120
01:11:56,402 --> 01:11:59,565
I have admiration for her,

1121
01:11:59,638 --> 01:12:02,664
but no thought beyond,
not at all.

1122
01:12:05,578 --> 01:12:07,842
No.
[ Chuckles ]

1123
01:12:11,183 --> 01:12:14,277
Ah, I see Mr. Weston is at home.
I'll go and see him.

1124
01:12:17,923 --> 01:12:22,951
Well, Mrs. Weston, what do you say
about your suspicions now ?

1125
01:12:26,031 --> 01:12:30,798
He's so very occupied with his
not being in love with her,

1126
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:33,771
it seems certain that he is.

1127
01:12:39,545 --> 01:12:41,979
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

1128
01:12:43,983 --> 01:12:48,283
It was most kind of you
to invite Jane Fairfax this evening.

1129
01:12:48,354 --> 01:12:51,255
Your words the other day
shamed me.

1130
01:12:51,323 --> 01:12:53,587
I have not tried as I should have.

1131
01:12:53,659 --> 01:12:57,095
You're capable of great kindness.

1132
01:12:57,162 --> 01:12:59,687
I fall short so often.

1133
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:04,067
And I highly doubt
she will find this a kindness.

1134
01:13:04,136 --> 01:13:07,572
Jane, you're a very,
very fragile creature.

1135
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:11,872
You pay no regard to the delicacy
of your constitution.

1136
01:13:11,944 --> 01:13:14,538
Jane. Knightley !

1137
01:13:14,613 --> 01:13:17,548
Help us ! Knightley !

1138
01:13:17,616 --> 01:13:20,346
Jane went to the post office
today in the rain...

1139
01:13:20,419 --> 01:13:23,047
at great peril to her health !

1140
01:13:23,122 --> 01:13:26,990
Oh, Jane, you sad girl !

1141
01:13:27,059 --> 01:13:29,687
This is a sign that I was
not there to take care of you.

1142
01:13:29,762 --> 01:13:31,627
Knightley !

1143
01:13:31,697 --> 01:13:34,461
Tell her. Tell her !

1144
01:13:34,533 --> 01:13:39,368
I'm sure she knows what
she can endure, Mrs. Elton.

1145
01:13:39,438 --> 01:13:41,929
But, of course.

1146
01:13:42,007 --> 01:13:43,941
Do take care of yourself.

1147
01:13:44,009 --> 01:13:46,068
Thank you.

1148
01:13:52,818 --> 01:13:55,218
Mr. Weston.

1149
01:13:55,287 --> 01:13:59,348
[ Woodhouse ] We had quite given you up.
I'm afraid we had to start without you.

1150
01:13:59,425 --> 01:14:03,088
Oh, forgive me, Mr. Woodhouse, Emma.
No, please.

1151
01:14:03,162 --> 01:14:07,997
The journey from London was especially
slow, or perhaps it just seemed so...

1152
01:14:08,067 --> 01:14:11,434
as I had some good news
that I was eager to share.

1153
01:14:11,503 --> 01:14:13,596
Frank's aunt is on the mend,

1154
01:14:13,672 --> 01:14:15,936
and Frank is taking a house
in Highbury.

1155
01:14:16,008 --> 01:14:17,475
Oh !

1156
01:14:17,543 --> 01:14:20,376
- [ Woodhouse ] Good news, indeed !
- [ Mrs. Elton ] Well, well, well.

1157
01:14:20,446 --> 01:14:23,040
I shall have to do something
with Mr. "E" to welcome him.

1158
01:14:23,115 --> 01:14:25,379
- [ Chuckling ] Mr. "E" ?
- Yes, indeed, we--

1159
01:14:25,451 --> 01:14:27,919
Highbury's a little different
since he left, you know.

1160
01:14:27,987 --> 01:14:29,921
There's been an addition,

1161
01:14:29,989 --> 01:14:33,152
if I may presume to call myself
an addition.

1162
01:14:34,727 --> 01:14:36,991
Uh, personally
I wouldn't presume to.

1163
01:14:37,062 --> 01:14:39,257
I'm simply quoting other people.

1164
01:14:39,331 --> 01:14:42,494
But I think Mr. Frank Churchill
will find one or two small changes...

1165
01:14:42,568 --> 01:14:47,062
in the vicinity since he last came
to visit his good father.

1166
01:14:48,807 --> 01:14:52,937
[ Thinking ]
Frank Churchill. Hmm.

1167
01:14:53,012 --> 01:14:56,812
I must own that I am not in love
with Frank. I have not thought of him...

1168
01:14:56,882 --> 01:15:01,080
since he left, except for the mention
Harriet made of him the other day.

1169
01:15:01,153 --> 01:15:04,247
Harriet ! And Frank !

1170
01:15:04,323 --> 01:15:06,791
Oh, wouldn't they be charming ?

1171
01:15:13,999 --> 01:15:18,527
[ Thinking ] It would so relieve me
to know Harriet was well taken care of.

1172
01:15:18,604 --> 01:15:21,129
Perhaps I can bring them
together at the ball.

1173
01:15:21,206 --> 01:15:24,403
Lucky the man who exchanges
Emma for Harriet.

1174
01:15:24,476 --> 01:15:26,535
I can think
of nothing less appealing...

1175
01:15:26,612 --> 01:15:29,172
than an evening
of watching other people dance.

1176
01:15:29,248 --> 01:15:32,445
- Go on !
- Then you shall have to dance yourself.

1177
01:15:32,518 --> 01:15:36,045
I have no taste for it.
I'd rather fetch that stick.

1178
01:15:36,121 --> 01:15:39,352
I'll try to remember
to bring it to the ball.

1179
01:15:42,261 --> 01:15:45,924
I just want to stay here
where it's cozy.

1180
01:15:45,998 --> 01:15:49,024
- Miss Woodhouse.
- Mr. Churchill !

1181
01:15:50,602 --> 01:15:53,469
I came early to see if I could
be of service to your father.

1182
01:15:53,539 --> 01:15:57,805
You're late. The whole party is here
to help my father prepare for the party.

1183
01:15:57,876 --> 01:16:01,334
- Even Hampstead.
- [ Laughing ]

1184
01:16:03,882 --> 01:16:08,342
- Are you waiting for someone ?
- Hmm, Mrs. Elton.

1185
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:13,119
- Mrs. Elton ? Why ever for ?
- I hear much of her.

1186
01:16:13,192 --> 01:16:16,059
She is bringing Jane Fairfax
in the carriage.

1187
01:16:16,128 --> 01:16:20,497
Perhaps tonight we can finally
ask Jane Fairfax about Mr. Dixon.

1188
01:16:20,566 --> 01:16:23,626
Or did you acquire the courage
during my absence ?

1189
01:16:23,702 --> 01:16:25,670
Oh, is that they ?

1190
01:16:25,738 --> 01:16:28,172
Do, do excuse me.

1191
01:16:30,008 --> 01:16:32,909
- Frank just told me
the most fascinating thing.
- Tell me.

1192
01:16:32,978 --> 01:16:36,141
He's heard about Mrs. Elton
and he still wants to meet her.

1193
01:16:39,084 --> 01:16:41,109
I always say, always,

1194
01:16:41,186 --> 01:16:44,815
there is no place where the people
are as nice as in Highbury.

1195
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:48,690
We were not two steps out of the
carriage, not two, it was possibly less,

1196
01:16:48,761 --> 01:16:51,355
when Frank Churchill,
he came bounding up.

1197
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:53,990
He was bounding, I tell you,
to see if we needed any assistance.

1198
01:16:54,066 --> 01:16:57,058
- He is so obliging.
- [ Churchill ] Good evening, Mr. Cole.

1199
01:16:57,136 --> 01:17:01,971
Oh, Mr. Churchill, l, I was just telling

01:29:56,748 --> 01:29:58,841
To be sure.

1350
01:29:58,917 --> 01:30:00,851
[ Miss Bates ]
Yes.

1351
01:30:03,621 --> 01:30:05,555
[ Miss Bates ]
l, l--

1352
01:30:05,623 --> 01:30:07,591
I, l--

1353
01:30:09,127 --> 01:30:13,223
I, I see. I see.
I see what she means.

1354
01:30:13,298 --> 01:30:17,029
Hmm. I will try
and hold my tongue.

1355
01:30:17,101 --> 01:30:22,403
Oh, I must make myself
very... disagreeable.

1356
01:30:22,473 --> 01:30:27,467
Or, or she would not have said
such a thing to an old... friend.

1357
01:30:29,581 --> 01:30:34,041
Well, [ Giggles ]
just three.

1358
01:30:34,118 --> 01:30:36,086
Yes.

1359
01:30:42,393 --> 01:30:45,954
Miss Bates, will you give me
the pleasure of your company...

1360
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:49,397
- whilst I pick some more strawberries ?
- Oh, thank you,

1361
01:30:49,467 --> 01:30:51,094
Mr. Knightley.

1362
01:30:51,169 --> 01:30:53,831
That would be charming.

1363
01:31:04,015 --> 01:31:05,949
Emma ?

1364
01:31:06,017 --> 01:31:09,111
How could you be so unfeeling
to Miss Bates ?

1365
01:31:10,755 --> 01:31:14,122
How could you be so insolent
to a woman of her age and situation ?

1366
01:31:14,192 --> 01:31:16,285
I'd not thought it possible.

1367
01:31:16,361 --> 01:31:20,127
How could I help saying it ?
I daresay she did not understand me.

1368
01:31:20,198 --> 01:31:22,962
I assure you she felt
your full meaning.

1369
01:31:23,034 --> 01:31:25,400
She cannot stop mentioning it.

1370
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:28,598
I wish you could have heard
her honor your forbearance
in putting up with her...

1371
01:31:28,673 --> 01:31:30,607
when her society is so irksome !

1372
01:31:30,675 --> 01:31:33,200
I know there is no better creature
in all the world, but you must allow...

1373
01:31:33,277 --> 01:31:36,804
that blended alongside the good,
there is an equal amount
of the ridiculous in her.

1374
01:31:36,881 --> 01:31:39,782
Were she prosperous or a woman
equal to you in situation,

1375
01:31:39,851 --> 01:31:43,082
I would not quarrel
about any liberties of manner.

1376
01:31:43,154 --> 01:31:45,952
But she is poor !

1377
01:31:46,024 --> 01:31:48,322
Even more so
than when she was born !

1378
01:31:48,393 --> 01:31:51,920
And should she live to be an old lady,
she will sink further still.

1379
01:31:51,996 --> 01:31:56,729
Her situation being in every way below
you should secure your compassion !

1380
01:31:56,801 --> 01:31:59,099
Badly done, Emma.

1381
01:32:01,539 --> 01:32:03,507
Badly done.

1382
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:10,406
She has watched you grow from a time
when her notice of you was an honor...

1383
01:32:11,983 --> 01:32:14,713
to this.

1384
01:32:14,786 --> 01:32:17,755
Humbling her
and laughing at her...

1385
01:32:17,822 --> 01:32:21,349
in front of people who would be guided
by your treatment of her.

1386
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:30,367
Ah !

1387
01:32:33,705 --> 01:32:37,368
It is not pleasant
for me to say these things.

1388
01:32:39,377 --> 01:32:43,404
But I must tell you the truth
while I can.

1389
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:48,610
Proving myself your friend
by the most faithful counsel,

1390
01:32:52,523 --> 01:32:55,822
and trusting that sometime you will
do my faith in you greater justice...

1391
01:32:55,893 --> 01:32:58,589
than you do it now.

1392
01:33:17,014 --> 01:33:19,141
Oh, good afternoon,
Miss Woodhouse.

1393
01:33:19,217 --> 01:33:21,344
Please come in.

1394
01:33:27,558 --> 01:33:30,220
Just a moment, please.

1395
01:33:30,294 --> 01:33:33,661
Just tell her I'm unwell, Mother,
and laid down upon the bed.

1396
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:01,916
[ Knightley ]
I've been planning a visit--

1397
01:34:05,396 --> 01:34:07,591
- ...first and say good-bye.
- [ Woodhouse ] You mean, you walked...

1398
01:34:07,665 --> 01:34:10,998
- all the way, and on such a cold night?
- Certainly I walked.

1399
01:34:11,068 --> 01:34:15,562
My dear, how did you find
my old friend and her daughter ?

1400
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,666
Emma has called on
Mrs. and Miss Bates.

1401
01:34:18,743 --> 01:34:22,975
- She always shows them such kindness.
- No, Father.

1402
01:34:23,047 --> 01:34:26,073
They have been the ones
to forebear and show me kindness.

1403
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:30,416
Nonsense, daughter !
The charity you have given them--

1404
01:34:30,488 --> 01:34:34,219
I have given them charity
but not kindness,

1405
01:34:34,292 --> 01:34:38,592
a virtue which some friends
may doubt I still have.

1406
01:34:40,598 --> 01:34:43,658
The truest friend
does not doubt...

1407
01:34:43,734 --> 01:34:46,202
but hope.

1408
01:34:58,382 --> 01:35:00,316
I must go.

1409
01:35:00,384 --> 01:35:04,718
I'm leaving town
to visit John and lsabella.

1410
01:35:04,789 --> 01:35:07,781
I'm sorry
I was not here sooner...

1411
01:35:07,859 --> 01:35:10,885
so that we could have talked.

1412
01:35:12,196 --> 01:35:14,130
So am l.

1413
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,630
When will you be back ?

1414
01:35:18,703 --> 01:35:21,194
I don't know.

1415
01:35:21,272 --> 01:35:24,537
There is a delicate
and perplexing matter...

1416
01:35:24,609 --> 01:35:27,237
I must discuss
with my brother.

1417
01:35:30,615 --> 01:35:32,549
Well, then--

1418
01:35:33,851 --> 01:35:35,785
Well, then--

1419
01:35:35,853 --> 01:35:37,878
[ Chuckles ]

1420
01:35:43,761 --> 01:35:47,754
[ Thinking ] Frank Churchill's aunt
has died, taking him away.

1421
01:35:47,832 --> 01:35:52,394
This strengthens Harriet's chances with
him, since the aunt was sure to object.

1422
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:56,099
I continue in my efforts
to make amends with Miss Bates.

1423
01:35:56,173 --> 01:35:58,539
Though matters are not yet
fully repaired,

1424
01:35:58,609 --> 01:36:02,136
I feel that a renewal
of our friendship is ahead of us.

1425
01:36:02,213 --> 01:36:04,977
Above all,
I am most gratified to say...

1426
01:36:05,049 --> 01:36:07,313
that could Mr. Knightley--

1427
01:36:11,689 --> 01:36:14,817
Mr. Knightley--

1428
01:36:14,892 --> 01:36:16,519
Hmm.

1429
01:36:16,594 --> 01:36:20,291
Had been privy to my attempts,
could he have seen into my heart,

1430
01:36:20,364 --> 01:36:25,233
I think he would not, on this occasion,
have found anything to reprove.

1431
01:36:27,171 --> 01:36:29,537
[ Panting ]

1432
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:34,336
Frank... is engaged.

1433
01:36:34,412 --> 01:36:38,439
[ Gasps ] I cannot believe it !
So quickly ?

1434
01:36:38,516 --> 01:36:41,883
Quickly ? The engagement
has been in place for some time.

1435
01:36:43,487 --> 01:36:46,752
Emma, Frank has been
secretly engaged...

1436
01:36:46,824 --> 01:36:48,951
to Jane Fairfax.

1437
01:36:49,026 --> 01:36:51,290
Good God !

1438
01:36:51,362 --> 01:36:54,422
- This cannot be the truth !
- They've been engaged since October,

1439
01:36:54,498 --> 01:36:57,934
formed at Weymouth
through their friend, Charles Dixon.

1440
01:36:58,002 --> 01:37:00,061
Mr. Dixon !

1441
01:37:00,137 --> 01:37:03,504
He kept it secret because
he feared his aunt's disapproval.

1442
01:37:05,209 --> 01:37:07,803
It has hurt
both his father and me,

1443
01:37:07,878 --> 01:37:11,541
most especially because
of whom else it might hurt.

1444
01:37:13,718 --> 01:37:18,519
I cannot pretend that I do not
understand what you mean by that.

1445
01:37:18,589 --> 01:37:21,353
But let me give you
all the relief in my power.

1446
01:37:21,425 --> 01:37:25,088
There was a time
when I was attached to Frank.

1447
01:37:25,162 --> 01:37:30,327
Fortunately, that ceased and for
some time I have felt nothing for him.

1448
01:37:30,401 --> 01:37:34,667
This was my greatest worry.

1449
01:37:34,739 --> 01:37:38,300
I'm certain you knew it was
our wish you might be attached.

1450
01:37:38,376 --> 01:37:43,473
- Imagine what we felt on your account.
- There is no need to worry about that.

1451
01:37:43,547 --> 01:37:46,778
Although how could he have come here
and treated me in this fashion ?

1452
01:37:46,851 --> 01:37:48,842
It is cruel !
Truly cruel !

1453
01:37:48,919 --> 01:37:52,719
Yes, dear. But I thought you said
you felt nothing for him.

1454
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:54,724
Yes, but he did not know that.

1455
01:37:54,792 --> 01:37:57,852
He is benefiting from
a very lucky coincidence.

1456
01:37:57,928 --> 01:38:00,362
Now, Emma, he's a good man,

1457
01:38:00,431 --> 01:38:03,832
however wrong
this action might be.

1458
01:38:07,438 --> 01:38:11,499
Dear, might I entreat you
to put Mr. Weston's heart at ease ?

1459
01:38:11,575 --> 01:38:13,770
He's been as worried
about you as l.

1460
01:38:13,844 --> 01:38:16,574
Could you let him know
how glad you are for Frank...

1461
01:38:16,647 --> 01:38:19,445
to have found a girl
of such steady character ?

1462
01:38:19,517 --> 01:38:22,486
I do not know how steady her character
can be, engaging herself to a man...

1463
01:38:22,553 --> 01:38:24,487
who pretends not to be engaged,

1464
01:38:24,555 --> 01:38:26,489
and then deceives attractive
and feeling young women.

1465

[ Door Opens ]

1466

Here is the luckiest father
in all of England !

01:38:35,499 --> 01:38:37,763
Thank you.

1468
01:38:39,537 --> 01:38:43,064
- [ Door Opens ]
- Is this not the oddest news
you've ever heard about...

1469
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:45,267
Mr. Churchill and Miss Fairfax ?

1470
01:38:45,342 --> 01:38:47,776
- Had you any idea of it ?
- Can you imagine that I knew...

1471
01:38:47,845 --> 01:38:50,245
when I was encouraging you
to give way to your own feelings ?

1472
01:38:50,314 --> 01:38:52,544
Had I known,
I would have cautioned you.

1473
01:38:52,616 --> 01:38:54,550
Cautioned me ? Why ?

1474
01:38:54,618 --> 01:38:58,247
You do not think that I care
about Frank Churchill !

1475
01:38:58,322 --> 01:39:01,382
Wha-- What do you mean ?

1476
01:39:01,459 --> 01:39:04,895
- You, you said that you loved a man--
- I did not name him,

1477
01:39:04,962 --> 01:39:09,592
but I hope I have developed better taste
than to choose Frank Churchill over him.

1478
01:39:09,667 --> 01:39:12,227
Frank Churchill.
[ Laughs ]

1479
01:39:12,303 --> 01:39:14,498
Furthermore, I would never
have even dreamed of him...

1480
01:39:14,572 --> 01:39:16,506
except that you told me
he was wonderful.

1481
01:39:16,574 --> 01:39:18,565
Yes, but I thought
you meant--

1482
01:39:18,642 --> 01:39:21,202
That raising my thoughts to him
was a sign of my good taste.

1483
01:39:21,278 --> 01:39:24,042
- Those were your words.
- But I meant them in reference to--

1484
01:39:24,115 --> 01:39:26,640
Without having heard them,
I would never have dared to hope.

1485
01:39:26,717 --> 01:39:28,582
Harriet, please !

1486
01:39:28,652 --> 01:39:33,112
Before we can go on,
there is something that I must clarify.

1487
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:38,193
Is it possible
that you are speaking of...

1488
01:39:38,262 --> 01:39:40,196
Mr. Knightley ?

1489
01:39:40,264 --> 01:39:42,755
To be sure.

1490
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:46,599
But, y-you spoke of the service
that Frank had done you...

1491
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:49,571
- in rescuing you from the gypsies.
- I never said that.

1492
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:52,040
I recall it
with perfect clarity.

1493
01:39:52,109 --> 01:39:55,340
If I spoke of being rescued,
I was thinking of Mr. Knightley's...

1494
01:39:55,412 --> 01:39:58,245
asking me to dance
after Mr. Elton snubbed me.

1495
01:39:58,315 --> 01:40:01,284
That was when I knew
how superior a man he was.

1496
01:40:01,352 --> 01:40:04,947
Good God !
This is a horrible mistake.

1497
01:40:05,022 --> 01:40:07,991
What is to be done ?

1498
01:40:08,058 --> 01:40:10,686
Must something be done about it ?

1499
01:40:16,767 --> 01:40:20,464
You must think him 500 million times
more above me than Mr. Churchill.

1500
01:40:20,538 --> 01:40:22,472
- Yet, you did say--
- Harriet ?

1501
01:40:24,341 --> 01:40:26,639
Have--

1502
01:40:26,710 --> 01:40:30,840
Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's
returning your affection ?

1503
01:40:30,915 --> 01:40:36,012
Yes, I must say that I have.
You told me...

1504
01:40:36,086 --> 01:40:39,021
to let his behavior be the rule
of mine, and so I have.

1505
01:40:39,089 --> 01:40:41,887
Am I wrong to hope as I do ?

1506
01:40:46,697 --> 01:40:49,222
Harriet,

1507
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:53,669
I can only venture to declare
that Mr. Knightley...

1508
01:40:53,737 --> 01:40:58,697
is the last man on earth who would
intentionally give any woman...

1509
01:40:58,776 --> 01:41:02,735
the idea of his feeling more
for her than he really does.

1510
01:41:06,217 --> 01:41:08,208
[ Emma ]
This is tragic.

1511
01:41:08,285 --> 01:41:10,617
[ Mrs. Weston ] Why is it tragic
that Harriet should attach herself...

1512
01:41:10,688 --> 01:41:13,748
to a man who you admire so much ?

1513
01:41:13,824 --> 01:41:16,884
I have asked myself many times
why this should have unsettled me,

1514
01:41:16,961 --> 01:41:21,728
and I came to see that I do not admire
Mr. Knightley as I have so long thought.

1515
01:41:24,969 --> 01:41:27,529
I love him...

1516
01:41:27,605 --> 01:41:30,631
so dearly, so greatly.

1517
01:41:30,708 --> 01:41:33,802
Outside of you and Father,
his is the opinion which matters most.

1518
01:41:33,877 --> 01:41:35,845
- Oh, my dearest child !
- I did not know it...

1519
01:41:35,913 --> 01:41:38,939
until poor Harriet said she had
the hope of him returning her feelings.

1520
01:41:39,016 --> 01:41:41,917
Then I felt ill
that I could lose him,

1521
01:41:41,986 --> 01:41:46,389
and I knew that no one
must marry Mr. Knightley...

1522
01:41:46,457 --> 01:41:50,518
- but me.
- How heavenly !

1523
01:41:50,594 --> 01:41:52,892
But I am too late.

1524
01:41:52,963 --> 01:41:55,056
Just before he left town
he said--

1525
01:41:55,132 --> 01:41:59,000
There is a delicate and perplexing
matter I must discuss with my brother.

1526
01:41:59,069 --> 01:42:01,333
I hope his brother
advises him to be careful.

1527
01:42:01,405 --> 01:42:04,272
After all, we know nothing about
her parents. They could be pirates.

1528
01:42:04,341 --> 01:42:08,801
My dear, I like Harriet very much,
as I might remind you, do you.

1529
01:42:08,879 --> 01:42:12,440
But remember, her feelings
are evidence of her feelings only.

1530
01:42:12,516 --> 01:42:15,246
Nothing can be known
until Mr. Knightley returns.

1531
01:42:15,319 --> 01:42:20,120
Oh, I long for it
and fear it at the same time.

1532
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:23,284
I shall not know how to behave
when I see him.

1533
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:27,057
- Let his behavior be your guide.
- But, oh, dear !

1534
01:42:27,131 --> 01:42:30,157
If he seems happy, I shall know
that he has decided to marry Harriet,

1535
01:42:30,234 --> 01:42:35,604
and I will not, I know I will not
be able to let him tell me.

1536
01:42:35,673 --> 01:42:38,938
I could not bear
to hear the words.

1537
01:42:39,009 --> 01:42:42,740
If he seems sad, I shall know that John
has advised him not to marry Harriet.

1538
01:42:42,813 --> 01:42:45,179
I love John !

1539
01:42:45,249 --> 01:42:50,016
Or, he may seem sad because he fears
telling me he will marry my friend.

1540
01:42:50,087 --> 01:42:52,988
How could John let him do that ?
I hate John !

1541
01:42:53,057 --> 01:42:55,491
My dear, nothing can be done
until he returns.

1542
01:42:55,559 --> 01:42:58,926
And until he does, you must try
to put him out of your mind.

1543
01:42:58,996 --> 01:43:00,691
Can you ?

1544
01:43:00,764 --> 01:43:02,891
Certainly I can.

1545
01:43:02,966 --> 01:43:07,266
I may have lost my heart,
but not my self-control.

1546
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:11,365
[ Thinking ]
Dear diary.

1547
01:43:11,442 --> 01:43:15,640
Today I tried not
to think about Mr. Knightley.

1548
01:43:15,713 --> 01:43:19,843
I tried not to think about him
when I spoke about the menu with cook.

1549
01:43:19,917 --> 01:43:23,250
- Oh, is Mr. Knightley coming ?
- Why do you say that ?

1550
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:25,413
Lamb stew's his favorite.

1551
01:43:25,489 --> 01:43:27,980
I tried not to think about him
in the garden...

1552
01:43:28,058 --> 01:43:30,492
where I thrice plucked
the petals off a daisy...

1553
01:43:30,561 --> 01:43:33,860
to ascertain his feelings
for Harriet.

1554
01:43:33,931 --> 01:43:36,559
I don't think we should
keep daisies in the garden.

1555
01:43:36,633 --> 01:43:40,160
They really are
drab little flowers.

1556
01:43:40,237 --> 01:43:44,139
And I tried not to think
about him when I went to bed.

1557
01:43:44,208 --> 01:43:46,768
But something had to be done.

1558
01:44:10,267 --> 01:44:14,727
Dear Lord, if he cannot share
a life with me,

1559
01:44:14,805 --> 01:44:18,366
is it wrong to ask
that he not share it with anyone ?

1560
01:44:18,442 --> 01:44:21,172
That we go on
as we go on now,

1561
01:44:21,245 --> 01:44:23,805
him stopping by at any hour,

1562
01:44:23,881 --> 01:44:27,044
always the brightest part
of our lives,

1563
01:44:27,117 --> 01:44:31,554
a natural and easy member
of the family ?

1564
01:44:31,622 --> 01:44:34,853
I would be content if he
would just stay single, Lord.

1565
01:44:34,925 --> 01:44:38,258
That's it. If he would
just stay single, Lord,

1566
01:44:38,328 --> 01:44:41,559
that would be enough for me
to be perfectly satisfied.

1567
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:46,225
Almost.

1568
01:44:46,303 --> 01:44:48,237
Amen.

Uh, I was, uh--
I was lost in my thoughts.

1573
01:45:23,474 --> 01:45:26,136
And how are you ?

01:45:26,210 --> 01:45:28,701

W-Well, I'm...

1576
01:45:31,715 --> 01:45:34,275
- happy to see you, as always.
- Ah.

1577
01:45:36,019 --> 01:45:38,920
- I didn't, uh, know that you were back.
- Just.

Oh.

- Yes, just.
- Oh. Yes.

- Of course.

Oh, dear.

- What ?
- What ? Oh. Oh !

1585

Something about the deer we need
for the venison stew.

Uh-huh.

- There's something I have to ask you.
- Oh, wait.

Now that you are back, there is
some news that will surprise you.

01:46:29,273 --> 01:46:31,764
Of what nature is this news ?

1590
01:46:31,842 --> 01:46:34,640
The very best.
It is a wedding between two people--

1591
01:46:34,711 --> 01:46:38,511
Oh, yes, between Jane
and Mr. Churchill.

1592
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:43,916
Mr. Weston wrote to me.

1593
01:46:43,987 --> 01:46:48,356
- Undoubtedly you were not surprised.
- Well--

1594
01:46:48,425 --> 01:46:51,861
But I seem doomed
to blindness.

1595
01:46:53,130 --> 01:46:56,099
Time will heal your wound.

1596
01:46:58,468 --> 01:47:02,404
- My wound ?
- I know you must've been...

1597
01:47:02,472 --> 01:47:05,032
cruelly disappointed
by his secret.

1598
01:47:05,108 --> 01:47:09,135
[ Sighs ]
He's a scoundrel.

You are kind.

1600
01:47:12,549 --> 01:47:15,382
But I must tell you that I quickly saw
that Frank lacked qualities,

1601
01:47:15,452 --> 01:47:20,014
honesty being one of them, which are
essential to me in any kind of friend.

1602
01:47:22,859 --> 01:47:26,818
Emma, uh-- Is that true ?

1603
01:47:28,966 --> 01:47:32,026
He imposed on me,
but he has not injured me.

1604
01:47:32,102 --> 01:47:34,036
Yes.

1605
01:47:34,104 --> 01:47:37,369
He got everything he wanted
at great expense to others...

1606
01:47:37,441 --> 01:47:40,410
and at no cost to himself.

1607
01:47:41,945 --> 01:47:44,140
He offends me deeply.

1608
01:47:45,749 --> 01:47:50,243
Yet, there is, there's something
in his situation that I envy.

1609
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:54,586
Did I mention that we are
having a new drain installed ?

1610
01:47:54,658 --> 01:47:57,684
You will not ask me
the point of my envy ?

1611
01:48:02,733 --> 01:48:06,294
Well, perhaps you are wise.

1612
01:48:06,370 --> 01:48:09,396
But l--

1613
01:48:09,473 --> 01:48:15,173
I cannot be wise. Emma,
I must tell you what you will not ask,

1614
01:48:15,245 --> 01:48:18,180
- though I may wish it unsaid
the next moment.
- Then do not speak it.

1615
01:48:18,248 --> 01:48:23,049
Do not commit yourself to something
which may injure us both to have said.

1616
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,830
Very well.

1617
01:48:38,669 --> 01:48:42,605
Very well... good day.

Mr. Knightley,

1620
01:49:17,841 --> 01:49:21,572
I stopped you ungraciously
just now and gave you pain.

1621
01:49:21,645 --> 01:49:25,376
If you have any wish to speak
to me openly about anything
you might have in contemplation,

1622
01:49:25,449 --> 01:49:29,180
as your friend
I cannot refuse you.

1623
01:49:29,252 --> 01:49:32,312
Indeed,
as your old friend,

1624
01:49:32,389 --> 01:49:35,620
I will hear whatever it is
you wish to tell me.

1625
01:49:35,692 --> 01:49:37,125
Emma !

1626
01:49:37,194 --> 01:49:41,130
You want our friendship to remain
the same as it has always been.

1627
01:49:42,566 --> 01:49:46,764
- But I cannot desire that.
- But why ?

1628
01:49:46,837 --> 01:49:49,670
I know I made mistakes, but had you
been here the last few days...

1629
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:52,004
you would have seen
how I have tried to change.

1630
01:49:52,075 --> 01:49:54,873
Please, tell me
I am your friend.

1631
01:49:54,945 --> 01:49:58,346
I do not wish to call you
my friend because...

1632
01:49:58,415 --> 01:50:02,181
I hope to call you something
infinitely more dear.

1633
01:50:05,589 --> 01:50:09,150
Have you not wondered why I never
befriended Frank Churchill ?

1634
01:50:11,795 --> 01:50:16,129
It was because I knew
he was intended for you.

1635
01:50:18,168 --> 01:50:23,572
Indeed, when you insulted
Miss Bates at the picnic,

1636
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:27,508
I thought that evidence
of his influence over you.

1637
01:50:28,945 --> 01:50:32,108
And I could not bear
to see it.

1638
01:50:32,182 --> 01:50:35,777
So I went away.

1639
01:50:35,852 --> 01:50:38,787
But I went to the wrong place.

1640
01:50:41,992 --> 01:50:45,553
My brother's house is usually
a place of comfort to me,

1641
01:50:45,629 --> 01:50:50,794
but seeing your sister there
kept you fresh in my mind.

1642
01:50:52,235 --> 01:50:54,965
And the torture,
I assure you,

1643
01:50:55,038 --> 01:50:57,268
was acute.

1644
01:50:57,340 --> 01:50:59,570
I only felt hope again...

1645
01:50:59,643 --> 01:51:04,103
when I heard of
Mr. Churchill's engagement.

1646
01:51:06,116 --> 01:51:08,311
And I rushed back,

1647
01:51:09,452 --> 01:51:12,910
anxious for your feelings.

1648
01:51:12,989 --> 01:51:15,116
Came to be near you.

1649
01:51:17,894 --> 01:51:19,919
I rode through the rain.

1650
01:51:24,701 --> 01:51:28,432
I-- I'd ride through
worse than that...

1651
01:51:28,505 --> 01:51:31,736
if I could just hear your voice
telling me...

1652
01:51:31,808 --> 01:51:34,743
that I might at least have...

1653
01:51:34,811 --> 01:51:37,405
some chance to win you.

1654
01:51:40,150 --> 01:51:43,313
Mr. Knightley,
if I have not spoken...

1655
01:51:43,386 --> 01:51:47,823
it is because I am afraid
I will awaken myself from this dream.

1656
01:51:47,891 --> 01:51:50,155
It cannot be true.

1657
01:51:53,263 --> 01:51:57,927
But I feel so full of error,
so mistaken in my makeup to deserve you.

1658
01:51:58,001 --> 01:52:00,162
What of my flaws ?

1659
01:52:00,237 --> 01:52:02,569
I've humbled you
and I've lectured you,

1660
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:05,938
and you have borne it
as no one could have borne it.

1661
01:52:11,581 --> 01:52:15,210
Maybe it is our imperfections which
make us so perfect for one another.

1662
01:52:25,228 --> 01:52:27,196
Marry me ?

1663
01:52:32,936 --> 01:52:38,374
Marry me,
my wonderful, darling friend.

1664
01:53:05,902 --> 01:53:08,336
Let's go to your father.

1665
01:53:08,405 --> 01:53:11,272
- Oh, dear.
- What ?

1666
01:53:11,341 --> 01:53:14,208
- I cannot marry you.
- Why ever not ?

1667
01:53:14,277 --> 01:53:16,802
My father.
First my sister, then Mrs. Weston.

1668
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,145
I don't think he could bear
my leaving, even for a man
he regards as highly as you.

1669
01:53:20,216 --> 01:53:25,119
I cannot marry you.
I cannot abandon him. I cannot !

1670
01:53:25,188 --> 01:53:29,818
I could not secure your happiness
while attacking your father's.

1671
01:53:29,893 --> 01:53:35,331
As long as his joy requires
your being at Hartfield,

1672
01:53:35,398 --> 01:53:38,060
Iet it be my home too.

1673
01:53:40,570 --> 01:53:43,095
Thank you.

1674
01:53:43,173 --> 01:53:45,198
Thank you.

1675
01:53:47,243 --> 01:53:50,110
Now I need not call you
Mr. Knightley.

1676
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:53,741
I may call you my Mr. Knightley.

1677
01:54:28,151 --> 01:54:31,450
[ Mrs. Weston ] The elation Mr.
Woodhouse felt was soon shared by many.

1678
01:54:38,061 --> 01:54:40,894
While these exchanges
lifted the hearts of the couple,

1679
01:54:40,964 --> 01:54:44,491
there was one visit
which did not.

1680
01:54:56,613 --> 01:54:58,911
Emma knew that the best chance
for Harriet's happiness...

1681
01:54:58,982 --> 01:55:01,314
was that she might marry as well.

1682
01:55:01,384 --> 01:55:05,912
But it seemed too much to hope
that even Harriet Smith...

1683
01:55:05,989 --> 01:55:09,356
could be in love with more
than three men in one year.

1684
01:55:13,630 --> 01:55:17,225
Miss Woodhouse,
may I come in ?

1685
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:19,825
You know you need never ask.

1686
01:55:19,903 --> 01:55:23,532
Please do,
and tell me how you've been.

1687
01:55:23,606 --> 01:55:25,972
It seems weeks
since you've been here.

1688
01:55:26,042 --> 01:55:30,342
Yes. I stayed away at first because
I thought it would be easier for me.

1689
01:55:31,748 --> 01:55:33,978
Then I stayed away because
I have something to tell you...

1690
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:35,984
which I'm afraid you will not like.

1691
01:55:36,052 --> 01:55:40,011
Harriet, nothing you could say
would ever be unpleasant.

1692
01:55:40,090 --> 01:55:43,651
This is. That is,
I'm afraid you'll think it is,

1693
01:55:43,726 --> 01:55:47,526
though I think it
as beautiful as a dream.

1694
01:55:49,466 --> 01:55:53,402
I have consented
to marry Robert Martin.

1695
01:55:54,904 --> 01:55:58,431
- Whatever happened ?
- After I left here the last time,

1696
01:55:58,508 --> 01:56:00,601
I saw his sister at a party.

1697
01:56:00,677 --> 01:56:03,612
I fell easily
into conversation with her,

1698
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:05,944
and soon enough
she invited me to dinner.

1699
01:56:06,015 --> 01:56:08,415
Mr. Martin was there,
of course,

1700
01:56:08,485 --> 01:56:12,080
and we talked as though
we had never been apart.

1701
01:56:12,155 --> 01:56:16,285
As I left, he asked if he
could see me the next day.

1702
01:56:16,359 --> 01:56:20,455
I said that he could,
and on the next day...

1703
01:56:20,530 --> 01:56:24,057
he asked if he could see me
the day after that.

1704
01:56:24,134 --> 01:56:26,364
And on the day after that,

1705
01:56:26,436 --> 01:56:29,803
he asked if he could see me
all the days ever after.

1706
01:56:29,873 --> 01:56:32,706
- Harriet.
- I know this disappoints you, but--

1707
01:56:32,775 --> 01:56:34,936
Harriet, you mistake me.

1708
01:56:35,011 --> 01:56:39,243
This is the perfect end
for my sad career as a matchmaker,

1709
01:56:39,315 --> 01:56:44,844
a role I gladly relinquish by being
instead so happily matched myself.

1710
01:56:46,322 --> 01:56:50,850
I hope you know that I
only wanted your happiness.

1711
01:56:50,927 --> 01:56:55,421
Now that you have found it,
it makes my own complete.

1712
01:57:00,937 --> 01:57:05,306
[ Cheers, Applause ]

1713
01:57:11,714 --> 01:57:16,276
[ Narrator ] There were those
who thought the wedding a little shabby.

1714
01:57:16,352 --> 01:57:19,617
I do not profess to be an expert
in the field of fashion,

1715
01:57:19,689 --> 01:57:22,180
though my friends say
I have quite the eye.

1716
01:57:22,258 --> 01:57:26,058
But I can tell you,
there is a shocking lack of satin.

1717
01:57:42,712 --> 01:57:45,909
Bravo ! Bravo !

1718
01:57:56,326 --> 01:57:59,056
[ Narrator ] However, the wishes,
the faith and the predictions...

1719
01:57:59,128 --> 01:58:02,791
of the small band of true friends
who witnessed the ceremony...

1720
01:58:02,865 --> 01:58:07,564
were fully answered
in the perfect happiness of the union.
