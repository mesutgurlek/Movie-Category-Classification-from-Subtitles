as my guest in the studio

128
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,423
a very brave young
lady indeed, Tessa Scott.

129
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,524
Tessa's been living with leukemia
for the past four years,

130
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,928
and she's here with
her dad to talk about it.

131
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,996
Tell us, when did you realize
that Tessa was first ill?

132
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,626
Four years ago.

133
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,705
She had, well,
we thought it was the flu,

134
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,068
Tessa's mum and I.

135
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,734
But the flu just
wouldn't clear up.

136
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,433
The blood test
confirmed our worst fears.

137
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,104
The doctors told
us they couldn't

138
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,805
hold out any hope
for her survival,

139
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,349
which brought us
to the point where

140
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,951
Tessa felt like
she had no choice

141
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,247
but to end her
chemotherapy entirely.

142
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,721
Tessa, you chose to
give up the treatment.

143
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,587
That's a big
decision for a 17-year-old.

144
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,722
If I may...

145
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:10,885
The more aggressive treatments,

146
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,951
they would have only slightly

147
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,691
prolonged Tessa's life.

148
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,957
There are other ways
to maintain her health.

149
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,728
Dad... For example,
studies have shown

150
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,600
that good nutrition can
rebalance a system entirely.

151
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,072
That's why we're here really,
to raise awareness, and...

152
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,164
Dad...
What?

153
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,011
He's gonna have
to stop sometime.

154
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,809
Stop what, Tessa?

155
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,705
He knows it's gonna happen.

156
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,615
But he can't stop
hoping that it won't.

157
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,781
It's true that if
I kept going with the chemo,

158
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,189
I'd probably live a bit longer.

159
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,523
But it made me feel so bad.

160
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,662
And there are things
I want to do before I die.

161
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:49,960
Things?

162
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,663
Yeah. I've got a list.

163
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,362
Oh. Your dad
didn't mention that.

164
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,203
That's 'cause
he doesn't know about it.

165
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,670
Most of what's
on it is illegal.

166
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,643
I'm almost scared to ask.
(CHUCKLES)

167
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,211
Well, I nearly
had sex last night,

168
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,579
which isn't actually technically
against the law of course,

169
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,742
but it was so crap the guy
should be arrested anyway.

170
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,979
Okay, I think that's
all we've got time for.

171
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,280
Next I'm planning
to take drugs.

172
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,550
Do you have
any advice which ones?

173
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,647
That's enough, Tessa.

174
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,124
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
Very amusing.

175
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,956
Sex and drugs
and rock 'n' roll.

176
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,994
Ladies and gents,
I think you'll agree

177
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,131
there is a young lady
taking life by the horns.

178
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,031
Thank you very much,
Tessa and her dad.

179
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,927
Thank you.

180
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,999
And now the weather.
Squally this morning,

181
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,938
rounding up this afternoon
and clearing

182
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,567
for the rest of the week.

183
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,449
She's out.
No.

184
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,712
Dad...

185
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,146
Wait.

186
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,752
Bad night?

187
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,121
There's no such thing.

188
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,726
Hello, darlings. Come on in.

189
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,194
Hi, Mum.

190
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,157
You look stressed.

191
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,894
Blame her. Back at 4:00.

192
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,539
It's a new trick, Mum.
I can make a coin disappear.

193
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,904
Do you want to see it?

194
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,276
No, darling.
Not before coffee.

195
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,309
Nothing before the coffee.
Show your sister.

196
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,944
She's never interested.
She doesn't care.

197
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,755
I'm sure she does.

198
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,586
I really don't.

199
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,760
Why don't you go and watch
CBeebies or something?

200
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,952
Because I'm nine.

201
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,823
(SIGHS)

202
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,894
I heard you on the radio.

203
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,662
You met a boy.

204
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,662
Tessa, promise me
you'll always use a condom.

205
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,499
I know the smell of
rubber can be off-putting,

206
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,600
but, then, so is gonorrhea.

207
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,341
Please stop. My panic attack
is having a panic attack.

208
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,609
And don't have casual sex.

209
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,309
Really?

210
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,544
No, darling.

211
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,283
You must always, always
try as hard as you can.

212
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,421
(BOTH LAUGHING)

213
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,427
I've got to get a tattoo.

214
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,862
And I want one and all.

215
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,764
Over my whole body, of myself.

216
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,361
And taller, with bigger tits.

217
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,367
What's up?

218
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,668
He's such a bloody liar.

219
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,266
Who?
Scott.

220
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,368
Said he had a stall here.

221
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,037
Is that why we came?

222
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,444
I can't believe
he'd blow me off.

223
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,879
I gave him
the ride of his life.

224
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,144
Zo...
Wanker.

225
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,277
Zo...
What?

226
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,116
He's right there.

227
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,491
Hey, handsome.

228
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,548
What's up?

229
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,658
I don't know. You tell me.

230
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:33,992
Or better yet, show me.

231
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,297
(ZOEY GIGGLING) Hey.

232
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:39,896
Hey.

233
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,133
How are you?

234
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,102
I'm fine.

235
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,474
I know I left you hanging the
other night and I just wanted...

236
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,636
No, it was my fault.

237
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,244
What?

238
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,873
I just...
I could've been a bit more...

239
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,144
She told you.

240
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,678
What?

241
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,823
You did, didn't you?
You told him about me.

242
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,220
Shouldn't have done that.

243
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,150
Tessa, wait!

244
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,429
Tessa!

245
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,145
Hey. You missed lunch.

246
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,718
You eat it.

247
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,364
What are you
doing with all this?

248
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,367
There's a bonfire in
the garden next door.

249
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,639
Don't do that.
Please don't do that.

250
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,470
If you don't want
these things, I do.

251
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,802
That's Spain.
You were in remission.

252
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,045
A boy whistled at me,
and you took that.

253
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,115
Said I'd never want to
forget my first whistle.

254
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,583
Yeah.

255
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:06,883
But I do.

ADAM: What are you doing?

257
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:58,975
Do you mind?

258
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,970
Feel very free.

259
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,538
I'm Adam.

260
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,180
And you're Tessa.

261
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,118
I've seen you around,
since we moved here.

262
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,952
I meant to
introduce myself, but...

263
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,284
They're not love letters.

264
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,790
It's none of my business.

265
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,790
I'm just saying. I didn't
get dumped or anything.

266
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,522
I wouldn't have thought so.

267
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,398
Anyway,
I've got more stuff to burn.

268
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,871
Cool, whack it on.

269
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,035
This is going.

270
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,906
Probably best.
That's a dangerous dress.

271
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,556
Are you okay?

272
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,001
Tessa?

273
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,708
All right, don't move. Don't
move. I think you fainted.

274
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,510
Are you diabetic?

275
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,675
Do you need sugar?

276
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,111
Have some of this.

277
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,081
It's flat.

278
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,449
You're tough to please.

279
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,115
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

280
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,258
Okay, excellent. Not embarrassed,
not embarrassed at all.

281
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,228
No, it's cool, all right?

282
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,724
I mean, I've never had that
effect on someone before.

283
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,563
I kind of like it.

284
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,061
(EXHALES)
This is a nice garden.

285
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:39,534
Thanks. It's kind of my thing.
It keeps my mum happy.

286
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,804
How about your dad?

287
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,368
It's just the two of us.

288
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,780
I should get home.
All right. You need help?

289
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,450
It's not exactly far.

290
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,256
So, anytime you've got
something to burn...

291
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,991
Or I just want to pass out
in front of someone...

292
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,561
You know where to come.

293
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,625
Yes, I do.

294
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,042
When Tessa dies,
can we go on holiday?

295
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,570
Cal, that's an awful
thing to say.

296
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,308
I don't even
remember going to Spain.

297
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,844
It was so long ago,
it might not even be true.

298
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,475
Cal, that's enough.
Go to your room.

299

Dad...
What's wrong?

300
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,283
Get out!

301
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,755
What did I say that was wrong?

302
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,089
It's all very confusing.

303
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:33,991
No, it's not.

304
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,496
This is your day.

305
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,298
And what does that mean?

306
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,698
That I'll do whatever you want.

307
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,365
Buy more things?

308
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,699
Sure.

309
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,331
Where does the money come from?

310
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,035
A credit card.

311
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,873
Buy now, pay later.

312
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,707
Or you know, not.

313
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,372
Watch where you're flying. You
almost poked the guy's eye out.

314
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,712
I wish I could fly for real.

315
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,444
Yeah?

That was better than
the best thing ever!

320

Can I go again?

Yeah.

do this kind of thing.

get you hooked up again.

326
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:31,078
Actually, you know what?

327
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,754
I will have a crack.

328
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,589
Ready?
Ready.

329
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,323
Tessa, I don't know
if this is a good idea.

330
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,748
Is she okay?

331
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,884
She's fine.

332
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,189
She just doesn't
want it to end.

333
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,837
It wasn't your money.

334
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,567
She's late.

335
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,440
Do you hear what I'm saying?

336
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,705
She promised she'd come.

337
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,307
Tessa...

338
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,746
Do you want Cal to
return everything?

339
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,943
Why should he be punished?

340
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,915
What are you doing?

341
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,079
Is this to do with your list?

342
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,178
I don't have a list.

343
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,985
You told that
radio guy you had a list.

344
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,387
He was a knob.

345
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,857
Yeah, he was a knob.

346
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,192
You were still more honest
with him than you are with me.

347
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,594
How do you think
that makes me feel?

348
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,028
I don't give
a crap how you feel.

349
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,534
She's not coming.
Let's do this.

350
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,668
Tessa, there'll be
a slight pinch and burn,

351
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,106
then the anesthetic
will kick in. All right?

352
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,377
Good.

353
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,782
Now, I wiggle up and down

354
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,845
to break the tissue
around the insertion point.

355
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,050
She may feel a slight tugging
across the chest,

356
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,120
but once the line
detaches from the cuff,

357
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,718
it will simply slide away.

358
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,555
Now, of course I can
reinsert the catheter

359
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,656
should you wish to
recommence your treatment.

360
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,799
I'm saying you can
change your mind.

361
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,667
I won't change my mind.

362
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,800
(SIGHS) Dad?

363
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,033
She won't change her mind.

364
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,401
All right then.

365
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,007
(GRUNTS)

366
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,752

367
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,381
Good girl.

368
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,856
Do you want to slap my rump?

369
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,556
What? No.

370
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,090
Then don't talk to me
like I'm a horse.

371
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,897
Yes.

372
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,998
Sorry.

373
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,006
Hey, it's done now. It's done.

374
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,540
NURSE: You know
what to look out for?

375
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:16,347
DAD: Yeah. Chill, fever,
stiff neck or headache.

376
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,120
Drainage, bleeding,
loss of strength.

377
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,918
You're good. (CHUCKLES)

378
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,751
Thanks for all your help.

379
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:26,958
She likes you.

380
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,393
I doubt that.

381
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,558
I mean it.
You're bang in there.

382
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,068
You should definitely
ask her out or something.

383
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,073
Tessa! Tessa, wait, I'm here.
I'm coming. Stay there.

384
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,075
Oh, God, did I miss it?
I left on time.

385
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,448
But there was
this insane traffic.

386
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,917
I definitely left on time.
I just...

387
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,647
Sure, whatever.

388
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:53,916
Tessa...

389
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,252
I don't care.

390
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,759
Oh, don't be like that.

391
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,091
How do you expect her to be?

392
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,994
I'm sorry, this has
what to do with you?

393
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,759
Is that a serious question?
Yes, it's a serious...

394
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,323
Enough.

395
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,968
You both suck.

396
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,005
One of you is this
cancer obsessive,

397
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,301
and the other
can't even face showing up

398
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,568
at the hospital, which is fine,

399
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,837
I get it.

400
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,879
But neither of you
are what I need.

401
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,039
You're just wasting my time.

402
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,756
All I'm saying... This is
not gonna be all you say.

403
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,255
All I'm saying is...
There'll be another thing.

404
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,258
All I'm saying is, you don't
have to stay in on my account.

405
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,195
You could go out and see
your friends more often.

406
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,699
And that's all I'm saying.
Okay. Okay.

407
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,874
I've just taken drugs.

408
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,201
Excellent.
Have you met my mum?

409
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,406
Hi.

410
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,506
Hi.

411
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,012
Mushrooms is all I did,
which are natural.

412
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,947
If not strictly legal.

413
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,619
My friend did
buy some ketamine,

414
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,091
but she thought
the dealer was a bit skanky,

415
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,527
so we've gone with
the shrooms instead.

416
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,860
See you inside.

417
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,630
That went well.

418
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,697
I thought so.

419
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,571
How much did you take?

420
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,906
Not much.

421
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,076
I don't know, I'm not really
that clued up on the stuff.

422
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,241
Yeah, me neither.

423
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,651
Look, I'll drive you somewhere.
Keep you out of trouble.

424
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,610
I'm not sure how long
it takes to kick in.

425
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,629
About that long.

rude to last week's nurse, too.

with you and your mum?

My dad died last year.
He was hit by a car.

I had a place at college,

ready for it anyway.

you become fearless and brave,

00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:42,455
I'll take your word for it.

652
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,288
So, why didn't he
call me last night?

653
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,952
Zo, there's something
I need to tell you.

654
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,619
Let's get this done first.

655
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,631
Remember, shoplifting's
all about confidence.

656
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,031
Walk tall, pick and pocket.

657
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,535
In there, we go in separate.

658
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,060
Why not together?

659
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,333
More suspicious. Go on.

660
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,633
Right.

661
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,842
Tessa? Tessa Scott?

662
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,547
No. Sorry.

663
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,105
It is you.

664
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,844
Don't you remember us?
From school.

665
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,682
Oh, yeah.

666
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,389
You left in Year 11,
didn't you?

667
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,051
Ten.

668
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:56,425
So how's it going? Are you still
having all that treatment?

669
00:40:58,355 --> 00:40:59,527
Not anymore.

670
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:00,894
So you're better?

671
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,495
No.

672

What do you two want?

673
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,212
Hi, Zoey.
You helping her shop?

674
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,546
Are you ready to go?
Yeah.

675
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,447
Is it true you've been
seeing Scott Redmond?

676
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,514
What's it to you?
Do you know him?

677
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:21,579
All right, let's go.

678
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,715
Everybody knows him.

679
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,693
He went out with my sister
for about half an hour.

680
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,053
Is that right?

681
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,399
I have to go collect
the invites for my funeral.

682
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,459
Really?
Yeah.

683
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:33,762
I also need to
sort out the readings.

684
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,236
Make sure it's not that bloody poem.
It's been done to death.

685
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:37,597
Let go of me.

686
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,141
They're idiots, Zo.
They don't know anything.

687
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,539
I know.

688
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,503
I have to go find him.

689
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,138
NOW?

690
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,981
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I need to go.

691
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:53,750
Hey!

692
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,267
Another one!
Stop her too!

693
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:20,680
Gotcha.

694
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,256
Sit down.

695
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,823
Empty your pockets.

696
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:41,426
Well, I'd call that evidence,
wouldn't you?

697
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,762
Name. Address.
Parents' phone numbers.

698
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,505
Don't call my dad.

699
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,007
We have a choice.

700
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,806
We can call him,
or we can call the police.

701
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:53,313
The police, every time.

702
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:57,144
Now, I told that guy out there
I'd handle it, and if you...

703
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,550
Listen...

This is a portacath.

705
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,862
It's an access disk
for medical treatments.

706
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,700
I have acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.

707
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,067
Please put your shirt back on.

708
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,803
Do you know what acute
lymphoblastic leukemia is?

709
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,670
No, I'm afraid I don't.

710
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,203
It's cancer.

711
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,084
I still have to call your dad.

712
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:37,051
And you, what's your excuse?

713
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,756
What did she take?

714
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:43,088
One Clearblue
Home Pregnancy Test.

Was this on the list?
Shoplifting?

717
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,016
What are you doing?

718

As much as I can.
As fast as I can.

I wish you'd stop.

the rest of my life

a blanket on the sofa,

is, I like a strong woman.

to be carried to bed.

I have always wanted
to be carried to bed.

is bring to a mate's party

the courage to reveal myself.

When you were a baby,

829
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:40,125
me and your mum used to lie awake
at night watching you breathe.

830

We were convinced
that if we stopped looking,

quickly than we first thought.

You've moved
further down the line.

852
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:23,837
How much further?

that about Tessa.

Yeah, she's told me everything.

No, she hasn't.

If she wants you to
find her attractive,

916
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:16,962
then one thing she won't have
done is told you everything.

Why?

Because at your age, you shouldn't
have to be nursing someone.

920

Tessa doesn't need nursing.

Yes, she does.

And she will more and more.

simply not up to the task.

1140
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:12,915
That's what I'm gonna do.

1141
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:15,925
I want to be there.

1142
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:18,726
If you don't want me
in the birth,

1143
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,528
then I can sit outside
and come in afterwards.

1144
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:25,703
I want to be one
of the first people

1145
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,763
in the world to
ever hold your baby.

1146

Then it's something to aim for.

1148

You see, some people would
find this beautiful.

Stay with me. Stay the nights.

What do you want from me, Tess?

1156
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:41,742
Nighttime. Sleeping together.
Waking up together. Breakfast.

1157

What do you really want?

1158
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,453
I want you to be
with me in the dark.

1159
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,352
To hold me.

1160
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,695
To keep loving me.

1161
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,602
To help me when I get scared.

1162
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,770
To come right to the edge
and see what's there.

1163

What if I get it wrong?

It's impossible to get wrong.

not easy for me to ask.

Well, it's very easy
for me to answer.

Not about this.

What are you doing?

01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:43,792
Psyching myself up.

Yes.

You know why?

I think so.

He's a good kid, Tessa.

1203

But a kid is all he is.
You can't rely on him.

1204
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:09,953
He might let you down.

1205
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:12,550
He won't.
