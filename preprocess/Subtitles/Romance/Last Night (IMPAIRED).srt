1
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:19,353
Jo, are you ready?

2
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:22,322
Hey, baby. No, no - um...
Yes, I'm all set.

3
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,115
Why don't you get something to eat?

4
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:27,368
Jo, we're already late.

5
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,516
Did you grab a bottle of wine?

6
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:11,206
If we get hitten, you could lose an eye.

7
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,920
Not today.

8
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:20,674
How was your day?

9
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:23,075
My day was fine.

10
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:34,139
Thank you.

11
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:41,822
Michael where's the wine?
What?

12
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:45,117
Wine.
Shit!

13
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:51,819
Wait, wait, wait...

14
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,625
Hello!

15
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:58,922
You look nice baby.
Thanks.

16
00:03:03,178 --> 00:03:04,519
Come.

17
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,351
I love you.

18
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,547
Oh, you didn't bring Sarah?
You didn't tell her?

19
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:23,070
See you in hour.
You should be finished by then.

20
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:24,467
Oh well, thank you for that!

21
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:27,387
Barbara! Hello!
Thanks for having us.

22
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:29,180
Come see me upstairs.
I will.

23
00:03:29,974 --> 00:03:32,767
How long were you two together?
Three months.

24
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:35,603
Three months?
Three months already?

25
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,066
Talking to Monroe, I think we should schedule
another meeting for Monday.

26
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,652
Okay, let's just see how tomorrow goes.

27
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:46,130
I bet you didn't like Sarah either, did you?
I did! I said I did!

28
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:47,824
Yeah, but I don't think that you meant it.

29
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:51,302
Thanks.
Welcome.

30
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:52,745
Why's it so hard for me, Jo?

31
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:56,207
It isn't. I mean it can't be.
You haven't gone to the hard bit yet.

32
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:57,792
What it gets harder than this?
- Joanna?

33
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:00,378
Hello!
Hi, so good to see you.

34
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:02,255
Thank you for having us.

35
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,798
Andy...
Stuart...

36
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:08,470
Michael says you're working on a new book.

37
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,015
Michael always says that.

38
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,891
He's probably right.

39
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,936
I just don't know it?

40
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:19,320
Well, I got to go and talk to somebody.

41
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:20,692
Eat, I'll be here.

42
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:22,494
He hates me.
He's gonna fire me. I know.

43
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,571
You say that every week.
Yeah well, it's true.

44
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:26,323
But it hasn't been in the last two years.

45
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:28,193
Well maybe he's just waiting for the right time.

46
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:30,785
Hey do you want me to walk Lucy,
while you guys are away?

47
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:32,329
Yeah, that'd be great.

48
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:34,748
Where is Michael anyway?

49
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:37,467
Here he is.

50
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:39,868
Here he is, let's go!

51
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:43,840
Joanna?
Um yes no I'm going to go to the ladies.

52
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:46,760
I'll catch you up.
Okay.

53
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:15,416
I'm starving.

54
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:21,130
Hey, where have you guys been?
I got totally ambushed by Stuart.

55
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:22,751
The guy's hasn't talked to me in two weeks -

56
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:24,967
- and sees me with your wife,
and just lit up.

57
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:31,583
Laura, this is my Joanna.
Hello! Nice to meet you.

58
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:34,343
Joanna, this is Laura. She's our new designer,
who has worked for us.

59
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,521
Nice to finally meet you.

60
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:39,440
So Michael tells me you're a writer.
Yes, I am.

61
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:42,777
I've been meaning to order your book.
That's nice.

62
00:05:42,903 --> 00:05:46,447
Oh! Look, look! Oh my god!
Neal he's trying with Cynthia again.

63
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:48,950
She's not going to go for it.
I know. It just won't work.

64
00:05:48,951 --> 00:05:50,442
Why not?
He's a good looking guy.

65
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:53,079
Why did you turn him down?

66
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:54,430
Speak of the devil...

67
00:05:54,456 --> 00:05:56,549
Hey, Neal!
Had any luck with Cynthia?

68
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,350
Hi Joanna!
Hello.

69
00:05:58,351 --> 00:05:59,951
Had any luck?
What?

70
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:03,131
You didn't really go to
"The Yogo" with her, did you?

71
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:06,176
She told you that?
She told me about that!

72
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:09,762
Still with Cynthia huh?
What? You're getting jealous?

73
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,683
So what's Laura's story?

74
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:16,936
Stuart recruited her.
She seems to be good.

75
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,375
She's working the Monroe project with us.

76
00:06:20,876 --> 00:06:22,461
Of course she is...

77
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:29,070
Try to get me some wine?

78
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:46,260
That's not funny.

79
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:57,154
There you go.
Hi. Would you like a drink?

80
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:59,582
Yeah, white wine please.
Sure.

81
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:02,485
Thanks.

82
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:05,802
Is she going to Philadelphia with you guys tomorrow?

83
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:07,600
Yeah.

84
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,329
And she was in LA with
Michael last month?

85
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:22,173
Taxi!

86
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:27,428
Have you been smoking?

87
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:31,808
You really going to attempt to give me
a grief about that?

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,450
What's wrong?

89
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:36,602
Nothing.

90
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:42,300
Have I done something wrong?

91
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:46,601
She is pretty.
Who?

92
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:50,066
You never mentioned that.

93
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:52,122
Laura?
Yeah, Laura.

94
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,292
I think you described her as "whatever".

95
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:58,337
I don't remember.
I bet.

96
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:06,470
You didn't tell me that she was in LA with you.

97
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:09,014
She's wasn't in LA with me.
We were just there at the same time.

98
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,683
Michael, face me!

99
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:15,312
You didn't tell me anything about her, before tonight,
but then I think you know that.

100
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:17,106
What's that supposed to mean?

101
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:20,985
What did you think could happen tonight?

102
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:24,363
And seriously, did you think I just wouldn't notice?

103
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:27,032
Why would I think anything would make you notice her?

104
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:29,034
You're a terrible liar!

105
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:30,786
Might be because
I don't I lie.

106
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:33,122
She likes you,
and you like her.

107
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:35,623
Of course you don't want to talk to me
about it.

108
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:38,342
Where is this come from?
My eyes, Michael!

109
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:41,043
She's she the only one you talked to,
all night.

110
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:43,382
How many glasses of wine did you have
tonight, Jo?

111
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:46,210
Two and two sips.
Is that really your response?

112
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:47,745
You had more than that.

113
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:50,180
What are you?
The drink patrol?

114
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:53,392
Well remind me when we go out,
and I ask you not to have another.

115
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,936
You ask me why.
This is why.

116
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,481
You're kidding me, right?
Because it makes you like this, baby.

117
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:04,486
Michael without wine we would be in a
much shittier place.

118
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:08,282
Eleven hours a day.
Five, sometimes six days a week.

119
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:12,911
That's sixty hours a week with her,
three months now.

120
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:17,916
What is it you think I have done?
Check my phone, Jo.

121
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:20,411
And check my e-mails, check receipts, go on.

122
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,088
Not everyone gets caught, Michael.

123
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:27,301
Has she told you she's attracted to you?

124
00:10:27,635 --> 00:10:29,386
Maybe, Joanna.

125
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:32,347
I don't let the conversation go there.

126
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:34,266
But she tried to, hasn't she?

127
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:37,019
But she tried to when you were
in LA together?

128
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:40,189
You do hours I do not know about,
with the people that you work with.

129
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,900
You go away -

130
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:46,487
doing articles, all the time!

131
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,118
Have I ever given you a reason to stand here
feeling the way that I am right now?

132
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,065
I looked through a window tonight and I
saw something that I didn't need to see.

133
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,054
Couldn't you just have watched yourself
and spared me?

134
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:01,418
What the fuck are you doing!?

135
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:04,354
I want to charge the phone.
Why do you always have to use this one?

136
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,924
Why did you build a Berlin wall of freakin' magazines!?

137
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:08,139
I haven't done anything wrong,
and you try to pick a fight.

138
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,392
I spare you.

139
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,541
I would.

140
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:24,886
What's that supposed to mean?

141
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,576
What's that supposed to mean?

142
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:34,424
Is she going to Philadelphia
with you and Andy tomorrow?

143
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:36,876
Uh-huh, cause she's been working on
the Monroe properly with us.

144
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:40,421
Why? What does that look?

145
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,422
That looks sad, Michael.

146
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:47,303
There's nothing going on, Jo.
Laura is just someone I work with.

147
00:11:49,598 --> 00:11:53,567
It's not that I'm blaming you for being
attracted to her. She's... -

148
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:54,936
attractive.

149
00:11:56,313 --> 00:12:00,400
And it's natural to crave newness.

150
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:10,160
So what are you blaming me for?

151
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:13,872
For going out of your way not to admit it.

152
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,501
Thought I just did.

153
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:24,716
Don't do that face, Jo...

154
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:33,099
You know what I meant.

155
00:12:35,352 --> 00:12:38,229
You corner me, and you order me
to admit something -

156
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:40,400
and then you're pouncing me the second I came,
and now you're going to sleep on the couch?

157
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:42,360
Fucking fantastic!

158
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:46,656
I did not do anything wrong, Jo.

159
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:13,520
I'm sorry.

160
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:16,941
What for?

161
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:21,695
I'm not sure but,
I love you.

162
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:24,423
Come to bed.

163
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:26,909
I don't want to.

164
00:13:31,414 --> 00:13:33,123
Come to the kitchen.

165
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,167
Food isn't going to fix this.

166
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:37,427
Soon you'll have a full stomach.
Come on.

167
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:42,883
We got any tomatoes?
No.

168
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:04,031
How was your day?

169
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:07,410
Oh, but...

170
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:11,539
What?
Nothing, I just remembered I'm mad at you.

171
00:14:11,665 --> 00:14:13,249
I hate it when that happens.

172
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:17,415
Danny proposed!

173
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,754
Yeah!

174
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,299
What Pia said?
What did you think she said? Yes!

175
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:22,666
Was she surprised at all?

176
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:25,177
Yes, she thought that he was going to tell her
he was moving out.

177
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:39,400
My mum called.
Yeah, I know. I spoked to her.

178
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:43,072
Second week of December.
I've already said yes.

179
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:47,742
Can we go via London?
Yeah, sure.

180
00:14:50,787 --> 00:14:53,497
What time is your train?
At 8:00.

181
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:55,708
You shouldn't be up this late.

182
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,251
I'll sleep on the train.

183
00:14:57,252 --> 00:15:00,226
It's an hours ride.
I'll sleep in the meeting.

184
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:04,133
What are you doing tomorrow or today?

185
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:06,586
I got to finish up the accessories piece.

186
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:08,279
Yeah, with pearls?

187
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:11,057
Yeah, I'll dig up another hundred words.

188
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:14,094
It's good. And then you can work on the book,
without me here to distract you.

189
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:19,818
Joanna, I'm sorry.

190
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:23,781
I would have said something about her,
if I thought there was something to say.

191
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:29,027
Michael, did something happen in LA?

192
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,379
No.

193
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,501
I swear.
No.

194
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,006
Eggs are good.

195
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:44,802
Yeah.

196
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,523
What about the orange juice?

197
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,566
Come on.
What kind of cafe is this?

198
00:16:07,702 --> 00:16:09,995
Do you think we got married too soon?

199
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:15,160
What?

200
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:18,087
Why can't you make yourself consider that?

201
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:21,757
Because I don't have to.

202
00:16:23,385 --> 00:16:25,428
I don't think we got married too soon -

203
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:27,596
because we married after four years.

204
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:30,141
Yeah, with a break up in the middle.

205
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:33,894
And anyway, it's not about the amount of time
but the when of time -

206
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,897
and our when included college.

207
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:40,998
You know, that was before we were even us, you know.

208
00:16:43,822 --> 00:16:46,991
Do you think it's even the same
between us?

209
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:51,036
It got better...

210
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:56,750
Can you hear yourself right now?

211
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:00,921
What?

212
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:06,385
Just because I disagree with you,
means I'm not aware of what I'm saying?

213
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,345
You can't really think that.

214
00:17:08,722 --> 00:17:11,390
I do think that.
How?

215
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:15,060
Sunday night.
The last two weekends.

216
00:17:15,187 --> 00:17:17,980
Breakfast yesterday.
Dinner last night.

217
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,191
There's no bullshit between us.

218
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:24,778
With the possible exception of this evening.

219
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:32,703
Come here, Jo.
I'm cold.

220
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:38,190
Got your orange juice?
No. Thank you!

221
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:04,383
You're gonna try to get some writing done?
"Try" is a big word.

222
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:05,859
No, it's not.

223
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:10,601
Alright, I got to go.
See you later.

224
00:19:11,394 --> 00:19:12,728
Bye.

225
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:19,004
Hello.
A cup of coffee, please.

226
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:34,663
Joanna!

227
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:41,779
Alex! What are you doing here?

228
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:43,280
I have some work here.

229
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:47,993
I can't believe this!

230
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:50,955
Yeah, it's been a while.
How are you?

231
00:20:51,123 --> 00:20:56,043
I'm fine, I just can't believe you're here.
How did you know I'd be here?

232
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:57,862
I keep tabs on you.

233
00:20:57,863 --> 00:20:59,755
I'm serious.
So am I.

234
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:04,301
Your Christmas cards.
They gave the return address on them.

235
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:07,221
What if I'd moved?
You haven't.

236
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:10,391
How long are you in New York for?

237
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:13,894
I leave tomorrow. Actually, I'm late for a meeting.

238
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:17,314
Do you have time for me now?

239
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:21,277
Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Good.

240
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:24,029
Then I call you later with the time.

241
00:21:24,156 --> 00:21:26,657
Wait, wait, do you need my number?
Has it changed?

242
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:29,243
No...

243
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,495
Then I call you later?

244
00:21:34,374 --> 00:21:35,833
Wait!

245
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,300
Cause I've never been able to sleep -

246
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:10,102
- think that by the time I sleep I won't wake up
for about four years.

247
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,005
Be like...

248
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:15,252
I need to use the men's room.
Okay.

249
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:17,719
Michael, we have to wait for Andy.

250
00:22:18,661 --> 00:22:21,950
It's funny, because I could actually...
I could sleep anywhere.

251
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:24,371
Is that right?
Yes, I could probably fall sleep right here.

252
00:22:24,372 --> 00:22:25,760
Right here?

253
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:30,148
Six, four, seven, two, two.

254
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:37,363
Operator! Operator!

255
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:42,160
Operator!

256
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:47,959
Good morning!
How can I help you?

257
00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:49,410
I need to check in.

258
00:22:49,437 --> 00:22:51,129
Name please?
Michael Reed.

259
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:12,526
Hello.

260
00:23:12,527 --> 00:23:13,877
Yeah?

261
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:17,947
About noon, I thought I hallucinated
the whole thing.

262
00:23:18,491 --> 00:23:20,367
Yeah, Yeah, No, No.
That sounds good.

263
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:25,955
Okay, no...
I'll meet you there.

264
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:30,251
Alright, see you there.
Bye.

265
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,085
Wow, you look beautiful!
Thank you.

266
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:07,172
You caught me off guard this morning.
You looked just as beautiful then.

267
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:11,134
Shall we sit?
Okay.

268
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:23,105
So do I look different?
No.

269
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:27,025
I feel older.
You look the same.

270
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:30,404
You smell the same.

271
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:32,656
You do too.

272
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,277
Okay...
Let's get you a drink.

273
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:39,162
Yeah!

274
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,792
Can I have two vodka-martinis on ice,
with olives? Thank you.

275
00:26:43,503 --> 00:26:46,380
Can't be that kind of a night.
I know.

276
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:50,509
The last time we saw each other.
Claridge's.

277
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,810
For drinks.

278
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:53,811
That was almost...

279
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,112
Two years ago.

280
00:26:59,144 --> 00:27:02,187
That's right. So how's work?
How's the book?

281
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:05,941
I don't know. But it's finished.
It is?

282
00:27:06,318 --> 00:27:08,193
That's great!
Can I read it?

283
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,821
Of course!
Do you speak french?

284
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,866
No, good.
Okay...

285
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,701
We 're starting early.
Excellent!

286
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:19,163
The translation is almost finished.
You'll read it.

287
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,416
How's Paris?
How are you?

288
00:27:23,335 --> 00:27:26,337
I'm good.
How's your work?

289
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:32,301
I'm doing freelance.
Fashion stuff mainly. It's good. It's ok.

290
00:27:31,887 --> 00:27:33,438
Where are you staying?

291
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:36,390
Here.
Oh, right.

292
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:42,730
You're still afraid of this subject being you
for too long, right?

293
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,279
Come on this is strange.
Us having a drink?

294
00:27:50,906 --> 00:27:52,239
You in New York.

295
00:27:53,158 --> 00:27:54,533
Why?

296
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:56,410
Because you don't belong here.

297
00:27:57,245 --> 00:27:58,612
Thank you.

298
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,625
So...

299
00:28:03,326 --> 00:28:04,960
Tell me something that counts.

300
00:28:08,674 --> 00:28:10,883
It's been too long since I've seen you.

301
00:28:11,051 --> 00:28:12,718
I meant something personal.

302
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:15,719
That is something very personal.

303
00:28:18,227 --> 00:28:20,395
Are you seeing someone at the moment?

304
00:28:23,357 --> 00:28:24,774
Tell me about her.

305
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,915
We are... -

306
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,871
happily under-committed.

307
00:28:31,532 --> 00:28:32,949
How long?

308
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:35,952
Few months.
That's long.

309
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:39,205
For you.
I wasn't gonna say that!

310
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:43,506
It was good seeing you...

311
00:28:46,755 --> 00:28:48,381
Bless the Martini!

312
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:54,721
Obviously you guys won't keep
the hotel open -

313
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:56,973
as long as possible while we're doing work.

314
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:00,393
It's definitely something you need to think about
as far as how we run phases -

315
00:29:00,394 --> 00:29:03,104
Because now it's becoming very important -

316
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,440
thinking about maybe solar panels -

317
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:08,192
double paint glass in all the rooms.

318
00:29:08,318 --> 00:29:10,711
It's actually something that Michael has invested

319
00:29:10,738 --> 00:29:14,115
a lot of his time and making sure.
It's actually something -

320
00:29:14,116 --> 00:29:16,716
- for people who stay at your hotel,
because you have these options -

321
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:18,511
and we think this is really something.

322
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:19,314
It's a lot of money upfront,
you then you get a payoff.

323
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,682
Absolutely!

324
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:24,002
So Stuart tells me that you guys could probably
bring in about three months.

325
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,087
Do you agree with that?
There's no problem.

326
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:27,556
Is it alright?
Yeah.

327
00:29:27,707 --> 00:29:29,174
It's all about the timing.

328
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,010
Start paying next week and we could be done
by the end of this year.

329
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:33,461
Alright.

330
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:39,476
You know yout timing is nuts.
Why? Are you getting a divorce?

331
00:29:39,602 --> 00:29:41,770
No!
And then?

332
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:46,316
I think it's possible that I will you into being
in my life.

333
00:29:46,942 --> 00:29:49,611
It's like if I think about you too long
you pick up on it.

334
00:29:50,196 --> 00:29:51,905
Were you thinking about me?

335
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:55,575
I always think about you when thinks
aren't going well.

336
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:58,369
What wasn't going well?

337
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:03,652
We should get going.

338
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:05,962
Where?
My room...

339
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:10,509
I'm kidding!

340
00:30:11,594 --> 00:30:12,929
I'm having dinner with -

341
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:16,265
- you know the man who bought the permission house
and who is in France?

342
00:30:17,892 --> 00:30:19,768
You're coming with me?
No, I am not.

343
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:21,978
Why not?
It's your work dinner!

344
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:23,496
No no - not at all!

345
00:30:23,497 --> 00:30:25,277
I've known him for a long time.
He's a friend.

346
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:26,758
You'll like him, and his wife.

347
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:29,152
I wouldn't fell comfortable.

348
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,572
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I can't cancel.

349
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:33,966
Come on! It's been two years.

350
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,909
Michael won't let you out one night?

351
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:39,830
Michael is out of town.

352
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:44,851
Let me get the check.

353
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:53,969
Still a little early for
grabbing a drink?

354
00:30:54,095 --> 00:30:58,098
Not so much.
We have an early day tomorrow.

355
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,809
All the more reason to relax
a little tonight.

356
00:31:00,935 --> 00:31:02,644
I don't think that'd be relaxing.

357
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:04,354
Are you sure?
I'm sure.

358
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:18,951
So if there's anything you'd like to
add to the presentation -

359
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20,620
- we should probably meet a little earlier.
Absolutely.

360
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:24,048
How long? 30 minutes?
Yes, 30 minutes.

361
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,376
How's the view?

362
00:31:46,836 --> 00:31:48,178
It's good.

363
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:00,891
Thanks for dinner.
See you tomorrow.

364
00:32:01,017 --> 00:32:04,144
Thanks, goodnight.
Goodnight.

365
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:06,021
I'm exhausted.

366
00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:08,790
I swear meeting conversations are
right there with working out.

367
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:10,380
Not that I work out, though...

368
00:32:10,381 --> 00:32:11,952
God, I feel like a drink!

369
00:32:11,953 --> 00:32:13,253
No, no. Not me.

370
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:15,197
Plus I thought that it didn't sound relaxing?

371
00:32:15,323 --> 00:32:18,283
Well it didn't. Not with Zach.
You up for it?

372
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:20,744
Sure, I'll have one.

373
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,831
Really? Because I think you didn't
get much sleep last night.

374
00:32:23,957 --> 00:32:26,792
I'm ok. Call you in the morning,
go for the run.

375
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,584
How is your mum?

376
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:41,019
She's better, thanks.

377
00:32:42,213 --> 00:32:43,964
Hello.
How are you?

378
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,551
Your friends are there.
Hey, Alex!

379
00:32:48,011 --> 00:32:50,929
Hey!
Hey! How are you?

380
00:32:51,055 --> 00:32:52,889
Great!
Good to see you!

381
00:32:53,016 --> 00:32:54,349
Alex!

382
00:32:55,393 --> 00:32:57,535
So, Joanna, this is Sandra.

383
00:32:57,536 --> 00:32:58,878
Hello.
Hi.

384
00:32:58,938 --> 00:33:00,981
Joanna, Truman. Truman, Joanna.

385
00:33:01,107 --> 00:33:03,400
How are you?
Excellent! Good to see you!

386
00:33:06,112 --> 00:33:09,990
God, you're good looking!
Thank you!

387
00:33:09,991 --> 00:33:11,291
She is!
Look at her!

388
00:33:12,994 --> 00:33:15,621
I had no idea you were seeing
someone in New York.

389
00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:19,374
No, no. We're just good friends.
Who sleep together!?

390
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:22,729
Oh come on! I was joking.
I was wondering but you know -

391
00:33:22,755 --> 00:33:25,340
it's way too early in the evening -

392
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:27,468
to answer a question like that.

393
00:33:27,594 --> 00:33:29,595
Well, she's not answering
and neither am I.

394
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:33,057
And no.

395
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:35,192
Thank you!

396
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:38,103
So, where do you two
know each other from?

397
00:33:38,313 --> 00:33:39,663
Go ahead.

398
00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:43,734
Paris!
I was writing a story and -

399
00:33:44,277 --> 00:33:46,236
a mutual friend had a dinner.

400
00:33:46,363 --> 00:33:48,030
When was that?

401
00:33:49,282 --> 00:33:51,075
That was about 4 years ago?

402
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:54,828
What kind of wine guys?
We'll have the Brunello we had last week.

403
00:33:54,954 --> 00:33:57,039
So, Joanna.
What do you write?

404
00:33:57,165 --> 00:34:00,334
Articles.
Freelance mainly.

405
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,838
She writes books.
She's written one very good one already.

406
00:34:04,964 --> 00:34:07,049
What's your last name?
Reed.

407
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:09,593
Was the first book not received well?

408
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,388
Wasn't really received at all.
She went with the wrong publisher.

409
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:15,608
I think, if it had been received,
it wouldn't have been received well.

410
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:17,214
You're being modest.
No!

411
00:34:17,215 --> 00:34:19,395
Yes!
I wish!

412
00:34:19,729 --> 00:34:21,313
Alright, I got ten more questions.

413
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:23,357
Do you want me to bring the specials?
Yeah.

414
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:26,110
Would you like another?

415
00:34:28,154 --> 00:34:31,925
That guy with the green sweater, if he leaves,
I'll have another.

416
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:35,247
Why?

417
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,752
I spent 12 and 13 doing things
on the basis -

418
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,672
- of other things happening
or not happening.

419
00:34:44,524 --> 00:34:46,189
Like...

420
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,454
If my mother wore her navy skirt to work -

421
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,963
instead of her navy pants -

422
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:54,307
then I wouldn't talk to anybody on the bus -

423
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:57,894
but if she wore pants, then I'd have to.

424
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,693
Afraid to be responsible for what you did?

425
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,346
Exactly...

426
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:07,949
And now?

427
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:12,528
I'm obviously experiencing a relapse.

428
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:25,109
I'd love another drink.
Okay.

429
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,503
Just not here...

430
00:35:29,204 --> 00:35:30,596
Okay...

431
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:45,538
This thing in my life with 
the most random unrandom things -

432
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:47,580
- happen to me all the time,
does that make sense?

433
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:48,964
Yes!
No!

434
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:51,292
I mean it makes sense to me,
because I know you.

435
00:35:51,011 --> 00:35:52,320
Joanna?

436
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:53,929
Maggie!

437
00:35:54,114 --> 00:35:56,574
I thought that was you.
What are you doing here?

438
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,494
We're just having dinner.
Where's Michael?

439
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:02,973
He's out of town at the moment.

440
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,480
Okay...

441
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:08,795
Well, call me.

442
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:11,798
Yeah, okay.

443
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:14,676
Enjoy your dinner.
Thank you, bye bye.

444
00:36:16,136 --> 00:36:17,762
Your best friend?

445
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,141
I'm so sorry I didn't introduce you.
Don't be.

446
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:26,145
Unless you couldn't remember our names.
Because I do that.

447
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:27,581
Me too, actually.

448
00:36:28,682 --> 00:36:29,991
No worries.

449
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:31,719
Who's Michael?

450
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,038
He's my husband.

451
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:43,871
God, it tastes good.
I didn't know you ordered this.

452
00:36:43,997 --> 00:36:44,090
Of course you can have mine?

453
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:45,375
So tell me about your wife.

454
00:36:47,337 --> 00:36:48,754
Where's that come from?

455
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:51,465
I don't know.
It just came.

456
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:55,231
She's great.

457
00:36:56,221 --> 00:36:58,305
What does she do,
when you're out of town?

458
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:02,601
Same things she does
when I'm in town.

459
00:37:02,894 --> 00:37:04,520
What she's doing tonight?

460
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:07,606
I don't know.

461
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:09,859
I thought you called her.

462
00:37:09,985 --> 00:37:11,352
Yeah I did.

463
00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:13,320
I just couldn't get through.

464
00:37:14,781 --> 00:37:16,282
How long have you been married?

465
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,910
Three years.
Yeah?

466
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:23,080
And you guys dated a while before?

467
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:26,834
Yeah, we met in college.

468
00:37:28,285 --> 00:37:30,245
You met young.

469
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,381
Yeah, we did.

470
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:42,308
I got to find the men's room.
I'll meet you at the bar.

471
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:06,335
If it's a mingy cat -

472
00:38:06,461 --> 00:38:08,003
that really means that it's a bad sign.

473
00:38:08,129 --> 00:38:10,756
In dream world, a mingy cat...
Who's phone is that?

474
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:15,219
Sorry it's me...
Michael is out of town, excuse me.

475
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,384
Hello, hello!

476
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:26,544
Hey!
Where are you?

477
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,091
Well, I'm grabbing a bite, I just stepped out.
How's your day?

478
00:38:32,592 --> 00:38:34,492
Is it my phone or is it yours?

479
00:38:34,537 --> 00:38:37,180
It's got to be yours, I hear you fine.
What?

480
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,432
I said I hear you fine.

481
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,685
How was your day?

482
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:45,686
It's good. I got some work down.
This isn't a very good connection.

483
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,565
No, it's not that good.

484
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,943
Are you out?

485
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:52,195
I'm in a men's room -

486
00:38:52,488 --> 00:38:54,322
we're still with the clients.

487
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:57,075
Okay.
Why don't you give me a call tomorrow morning?

488
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,829
Okay.
Love you.

489
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,415
I love you.
Bye.

490
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,044
I love it, when you come back at the table,
and your food is there!

491
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:24,381
How long have you been married?
Three years.

492
00:39:24,674 --> 00:39:27,050
Have any kids?
No, no. You?

493
00:39:27,176 --> 00:39:28,718
No.
None.

494
00:39:28,845 --> 00:39:30,220
I never wanted any.

495
00:39:30,388 --> 00:39:34,307
In fact, that's why my first wife and I
broke up.

496
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:36,309
That didn't came up
before you got married?

497
00:39:36,435 --> 00:39:39,020
Yes, of course it did, but
I think she thought that -

498
00:39:39,689 --> 00:39:42,065
I would change after we got married.

499
00:39:42,066 --> 00:39:43,441
But people don't change.

500
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,821
I mean, at most your weight fluctuates and
you start dressing differently.

501
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:01,459
I realize for a host of reasons I -

502
00:40:02,286 --> 00:40:06,631
- I probably shouldn't be going here,
but I'm going to.

503
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:12,178
That night in LA, when we all
went to that bar -

504
00:40:12,305 --> 00:40:14,514
we sat on those low couches -

505
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,269
- and Jeff wanted to sit next to us,
so you had to move over.

506
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:26,401
Your hand sort of rested against my leg.

507
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:29,946
Was that on purpose?

508
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,585
I had to be careful not to really
let it rest there.

509
00:40:38,006 --> 00:40:39,841
Cause you moved.

510
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:44,178
I didn't move.
I wouldn't have.

511
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,625
I'm married.

512
00:41:06,751 --> 00:41:08,118
I know.

513
00:41:10,707 --> 00:41:12,242
Still it felt nice.

514
00:41:17,996 --> 00:41:21,709
That is so embarrassing!
Thank you.

515
00:41:22,067 --> 00:41:23,989
Usually she's doing it better.

516
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,312
No, the point was that I love Italy.

517
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:30,024
I love it there.
We have a place, we go there -

518
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,068
- one month a year.
It's so wonderful.

519
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:35,569
Wait! This is who you went to Italy with?
When?

520
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:37,732
When I got to Paris early, and -

521
00:41:37,758 --> 00:41:40,451
- your little cousin was staying in the apartment,
till you got back -

522
00:41:40,577 --> 00:41:43,412
and you were away with Patrick and his friends.

523
00:41:43,538 --> 00:41:44,997
Yeah, exactly!
This is them.

524
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:49,501
That's really so weird!
And you seemed familiar!

525
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:51,337
How funny.

526
00:41:54,092 --> 00:41:55,968
What if you were married?

527
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:01,098
Hypotheticals don't do much for me, but...

528
00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:05,144
Probably nothing different.

529
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:13,110
Are you happy?
With what?

530
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,740
With your marriage.
Yeah.

531
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,301
Very.

532
00:42:23,088 --> 00:42:25,589
You can be happy and still be tempted.

533
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:27,432
I know.

534
00:42:29,177 --> 00:42:31,136
Just surprised you do.

535
00:42:35,016 --> 00:42:37,601
Have you ever been with someone else
since you've been married?

536
00:42:38,978 --> 00:42:40,354
No.

537
00:42:40,814 --> 00:42:43,482
Have you wanted to be?

538
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,195
What happened?

539
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,491
Think of Joanna.

540
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,080
You regret not doing it?

541
00:43:01,084 --> 00:43:03,836
I'd regret more if I did.

542
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,584
You ever cheated on anybody?

543
00:43:15,294 --> 00:43:17,378
Cheated?

544
00:43:17,504 --> 00:43:18,921
Have you?

545
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:21,123
No.

546
00:43:22,676 --> 00:43:25,720
Not necessarily on principle,
I just -

547
00:43:26,013 --> 00:43:27,471
I never wanted to.

548
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:35,896
Alex, I know you want them.
I need one yeah.

549
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:39,358
And I know you want one.

550
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:42,278
No, no, no.
She wants to keep me company.

551
00:43:42,279 --> 00:43:44,847
I do. I do.
You do? I do.

552
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:47,575
Okay.
So have a good night.

553
00:43:49,076 --> 00:43:51,080
It's a trap.
I know.

554
00:43:52,081 --> 00:43:54,010
You'll never change.

555
00:43:56,251 --> 00:44:00,921
When was the last time you saw Alex?
Two years ago.

556
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:02,798
So you know Helen?

557
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:05,526
Helen?

558
00:44:05,552 --> 00:44:07,678
Alex's girlfriend from Paris.

559
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:12,602
Well, we are not very good
at keeping touch with -

560
00:44:12,728 --> 00:44:17,148
- the dailies.
We talk when we talk.

561
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:22,362
She's nice. I don't think he's going
to settle down with her anytime soon.

562
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,741
But I don't know that Alex would
ever settle down, with anyone.

563
00:44:27,076 --> 00:44:29,619
He seems more whole,
on his own.

564
00:44:31,497 --> 00:44:33,247
So where is your husband?

565
00:44:33,248 --> 00:44:35,848
He's in Philidelphia on a business trip.

566
00:44:38,295 --> 00:44:39,671
What's he do?

567
00:44:39,797 --> 00:44:41,714
Commercial real estate development -

568
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,385
- but, I don't think this was the question
you wanted to ask.

569
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:49,097
No, it wasn't.
Go ahead.

570
00:44:49,223 --> 00:44:51,099
I usually tend to go too far.

571
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:54,018
Okay, warning heard.

572
00:44:53,144 --> 00:44:55,062
Does your husband know Alex?

573
00:44:58,733 --> 00:45:00,150
No.

574
00:45:00,694 --> 00:45:02,903
Does he know of him?
No.

575
00:45:03,655 --> 00:45:07,324
Have I gone too far?
Yeah, maybe, but it's fun!

576
00:45:07,827 --> 00:45:09,828
Why haven't you told him?

577
00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:16,876
I think when you know something like that,
you can't unlearn it.

578
00:45:17,878 --> 00:45:20,171
So there is a something like that.

579
00:45:22,508 --> 00:45:24,676
Are you faithful?
Yes.

580
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:29,472
Will he forgive you,
if you were not?

581
00:45:30,307 --> 00:45:32,350
He's always said
that he wouldn't.

582
00:45:33,352 --> 00:45:35,186
Does that stop you?

583
00:45:36,939 --> 00:45:39,149
Yeah, probably.

584
00:45:39,775 --> 00:45:42,819
How long were you with Alex together?

585
00:45:42,945 --> 00:45:44,821
We were never really together.

586
00:45:44,947 --> 00:45:48,074
We were more kind of on and off.

587
00:45:48,952 --> 00:45:51,495
You think you'll tell your husband
about tonight?

588
00:45:52,914 --> 00:45:55,708
I don't know.
Tonight is not finished yet.

589
00:46:15,337 --> 00:46:18,148
Remember the last time we were here,
and we got in the wrong car?

590
00:46:18,174 --> 00:46:20,141
When was that?
Remember how far we went before you remembered?

591
00:46:20,142 --> 00:46:22,109
Ten blocks. Hey guys, come on.

592
00:46:22,235 --> 00:46:23,628
Why don't you just drive with us?

593
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:26,155
Oh shit, Lucy!
Who?

594
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:29,325
A friend's dog.
I said I'd walk her.

595
00:46:29,451 --> 00:46:30,868
Where is she?

596
00:46:31,244 --> 00:46:32,578
She's on our friend's apartment.

597
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:35,331
Are you just saying that to get out of
going to the party?

598
00:46:35,457 --> 00:46:37,666
No, No! I know! I swear!

599
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:39,171
When were you last in New York?

600
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:42,966
About nine months ago.

601
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,594
Why didn't you get in touch?

602
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:51,600
I wasn't alone...

603
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,042
Can't get the key out!

604
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,375
Andy cooks?

605
00:48:06,501 --> 00:48:10,588
No, I bought that for him last year
I doubt he's ever used it.

606
00:48:11,465 --> 00:48:13,216
I do that when we're over.

607
00:48:13,342 --> 00:48:15,384
So why aren't you writing?

608
00:48:16,136 --> 00:48:17,678
I am writing!

609
00:48:17,804 --> 00:48:19,118
No, why aren't you writing?

610
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,432
You mean...
Your book, Joanna.

611
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:28,564
My editor says that I just need to get over
my doubt.

612
00:48:29,816 --> 00:48:33,277
What do you doubt?
Everything, Alex.

613
00:48:34,488 --> 00:48:37,281
I go to write -

614
00:48:37,407 --> 00:48:41,177
- and every word, every thought, every choice
that I make leads to another and -

615
00:48:41,703 --> 00:48:43,829
I doubt every single one I make.

616
00:48:44,081 --> 00:48:45,873
It wasn't like this last time.

617
00:48:46,575 --> 00:48:49,293
You live with your first book
all your life -

618
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,595
it comes out on its own.

619
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:56,217
After that though, it's just different.
You can suddenly write -

620
00:48:56,343 --> 00:48:59,929
anything and you second-guess everything.

621
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:05,977
Doubts will kill your work.
Who me? I don't know.

622
00:49:06,895 --> 00:49:08,813
What's the matter with doubt?

623
00:49:09,356 --> 00:49:11,783
I think the world could use
a little more doubt.

624
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,383
So I doubt...

625
00:49:11,409 --> 00:49:13,177
For the good of the world?

626
00:49:13,386 --> 00:49:14,845
Exactly.

627
00:49:15,096 --> 00:49:16,430
No, thank you.

628
00:49:18,391 --> 00:49:20,267
Your first book was good, Joanna.

629
00:49:25,773 --> 00:49:28,150
You know I think you might just have ruined
this kitchen for me.

630
00:49:28,486 --> 00:49:29,874
How?

631
00:49:30,275 --> 00:49:31,863
By being in it.

632
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:36,993
I come here all the time,
and now you've been here.

633
00:49:49,815 --> 00:49:52,008
Remind me why it didn't work?

634
00:49:52,885 --> 00:49:54,227
Geography.

635
00:49:54,228 --> 00:49:55,970
People live between two cities.

636
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,097
I don't, and neither do you.

637
00:49:59,308 --> 00:50:00,683
And timing.

638
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:02,352
You were broken up!

639
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:06,731
Temporarily. Technically, whateverly...

640
00:50:06,857 --> 00:50:08,191
We got back together -

641
00:50:08,317 --> 00:50:11,319
- after we'd already been together
for a really long time.

642
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,404
You came after.

643
00:50:13,531 --> 00:50:17,534
So you're with him,
because he came first?

644
00:50:17,826 --> 00:50:20,495
He did, and I love him -

645
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:24,832
- and I love you too, and I love
being able to tell you the truth.

646
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:27,073
And I love...

647
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:31,422
Faith, loyalty and all that shit, even now.

648
00:50:32,424 --> 00:50:33,758
And this?

649
00:50:35,427 --> 00:50:36,819
This?

650
00:50:38,973 --> 00:50:42,225
I don't know that this would be
what it is on its own.

651
00:50:43,269 --> 00:50:47,405
This is only what it is, because
it's something that's between -

652
00:50:47,731 --> 00:50:52,485
- me, my marriage to Michael,
you and your set of things.

653
00:50:52,406 --> 00:50:54,240
Does Andy have anything to drink?

654
00:51:01,665 --> 00:51:04,458
What are my things?
Nothing, I'm criticizing.

655
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:06,049
I'm just...

656
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:09,589
I know that if we went for it,
we'd lose it.

657
00:51:10,007 --> 00:51:13,259
That's hard to lose,
because we never wear out.

658
00:51:13,385 --> 00:51:16,596
We were just getting to know,
that we weren't right for each other.

659
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:18,115
You didn't want to!

660
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,308
No.
No?

661
00:51:20,851 --> 00:51:23,185
I came to Paris for two months!

662
00:51:23,478 --> 00:51:24,787
You do hold that against me.

663
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:28,941
I don't hold anything against you!
I was finishing a book.

664
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:30,998
I was too tired to figure out -

665
00:51:30,999 --> 00:51:32,903
what you being there even meant.

666
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,782
It should have meant that you wanted
to spend some time with me.

667
00:51:37,701 --> 00:51:41,370
It doesn't matter.
No, it matters to me.

668
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:44,332
Because I'm the one
who has to see you here.

669
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:46,667
I'm the one who has to look around Andy's

670
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:49,128
to see these pictures of you in this life.

671
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,392
What?

672
00:51:48,793 --> 00:51:51,503
I was what you needed
to be sure of Michael?

673
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:56,383
No. No.
It doesn't work like that.

674
00:52:01,347 --> 00:52:03,015
I think...

675
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:08,604
Maybe I've never wanted this to change.

676
00:52:09,272 --> 00:52:10,772
Everything...

677
00:52:11,482 --> 00:52:16,111
Everything changes, but this,
this still hasn't.

678
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,240
Not for me.
That's a lesson.

679
00:52:20,993 --> 00:52:24,162
I saw you this morning...

680
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:32,211
And... in the middle of most nights,
when I can't sleep -

681
00:52:33,505 --> 00:52:35,381
I still replay you.

682
00:53:00,576 --> 00:53:02,369
I'm going to take her out for a walk.

683
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:53,005
Keys, Alex!

684
00:53:54,048 --> 00:53:56,967
I thought you took them with you.
No.

685
00:53:57,719 --> 00:53:59,219
Oh merde!

686
00:53:59,512 --> 00:54:01,096
Did you leave them upstairs?

687
00:54:01,222 --> 00:54:03,807
Yeah, can we call someone?

688
00:54:05,433 --> 00:54:07,602
We can call Caroline, but...

689
00:54:15,101 --> 00:54:16,486
Shit!

690
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:18,252
Give me that, I'll give it back to you tomorrow.
Let's go.

691
00:55:50,669 --> 00:55:53,295
You weren't lying about the dog!
No!

692
00:55:54,756 --> 00:55:56,473
Come with me.
Let us find Fred.

693
00:55:56,474 --> 00:55:57,791
Okay.

694
00:56:01,884 --> 00:56:05,511
Her husband's best friend's dog.

695
00:56:12,607 --> 00:56:16,235
She's the one Chris told me about?
I don't know.

696
00:56:16,361 --> 00:56:20,614
At Phillips wedding, after
you just broken off with Lauren.

697
00:56:21,575 --> 00:56:24,785
I asked him, what the hell was
wrong with you.

698
00:56:27,164 --> 00:56:28,706
I liked Lauren.

699
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:32,418
But I like this one much more.

700
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:37,320
She's smart.
Yeah.

701
00:56:37,355 --> 00:56:39,049
She's funny.
Yeah.

702
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,550
She's gorgeous!
I know.

703
00:56:43,101 --> 00:56:44,451
And she's honest.

704
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:48,726
Well I mean, besides the fact she's out with you,
and her husband is out of town.

705
00:56:49,978 --> 00:56:51,520
But she's married.

706
00:56:52,814 --> 00:56:56,817
I know.
No, you don't. No, you've never been married.

707
00:56:57,027 --> 00:56:58,999
I mean fuck the vows.

708
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,572
It's the years you can't undo.

709
00:57:02,073 --> 00:57:06,285
You will never be able to take her away
the years with her husband.

710
00:57:06,453 --> 00:57:11,207
And the moment you try, this,
this will be gone.

711
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:15,753
Trust me.
That would be a shame.

712
00:57:19,132 --> 00:57:23,052
I bet you've had less than a hundred days
together, am I right?

713
00:57:25,784 --> 00:57:27,153
It's the best.

714
00:57:29,893 --> 00:57:33,979
Be smart.
Keep it as it is.

715
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,305
I'm in!

716
00:58:22,206 --> 00:58:23,510
Your turn.

717
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:31,527
Here.

718
00:58:34,514 --> 00:58:36,182
Oh, come on.

719
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:38,976
I'm not going to be the only one in here,
in my underwear.

720
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,750
You're uncomfortable.

721
00:59:37,377 --> 00:59:39,253
I am uncomfortable.

722
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:43,424
You don't hold back much, do you?

723
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:47,136
We're here in our underwear. I think
it's a late for that, no?

724
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,168
Do you remember that first night?

725
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:49,503
Do you ever think about it?

726
01:00:50,339 --> 01:00:51,647
Of course I do.

727
01:00:54,259 --> 01:00:57,553
I did not want to go home,
and you put me in a taxi.

728
01:00:59,106 --> 01:01:00,489
And do you remember that night -

729
01:01:00,515 --> 01:01:03,284
- when we met the photographer
you were interviewing?

730
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:05,436
And he was drunk!
He was drunk.

731
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:10,149
And you danced on that
top of yours with no back.

732
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:14,695
Come.

733
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:20,720
Let's go.

734
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,002
So, have you ever been cheated on?

735
01:03:19,548 --> 01:03:20,898
No.

736
01:03:25,387 --> 01:03:26,971
Well, I have.

737
01:03:30,642 --> 01:03:33,227
The worst part with her I found out.

738
01:03:36,439 --> 01:03:39,275
We shared a photo account -

739
01:03:39,401 --> 01:03:42,361
- and I went on the website to order
some pictures -

740
01:03:42,696 --> 01:03:46,198
- and I saw the album she decided to
share with him.

741
01:03:47,075 --> 01:03:50,536
I think they were together
for the weekend, or something.

742
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:54,415
I could have done without the visuals.

743
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:59,086
There was this one,
they were laughing so hard...

744
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,459
What happened?

745
01:04:01,585 --> 01:04:06,005
We fought like animals
for about a month and...

746
01:04:07,215 --> 01:04:09,264
I was angry...

747
01:04:09,765 --> 01:04:13,513
Maybe because I thought I had to be.

748
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,557
Or maybe because I was sad.

749
01:04:17,434 --> 01:04:21,521
But he still wanted to be with me,
I still wanted to be with him.

750
01:04:21,897 --> 01:04:23,247
So what happened?

751
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,109
We stayed together -

752
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,208
had the best year of our relationship.

753
01:04:31,653 --> 01:04:33,045
And then?

754
01:04:37,367 --> 01:04:38,717
He died.

755
01:04:40,787 --> 01:04:42,154
I'm sorry.

756
01:04:58,391 --> 01:05:01,893
Do you want anything to drink?
No, I'm fine.

757
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:26,334
Do you think you still
would have been with him?

758
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:33,550
Yeah, definitely.

759
01:05:36,554 --> 01:05:40,515
And I think I'd still be
here, attracted to you.

760
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,168
You'd never guess what I was upset about
this morning.

761
01:06:11,211 --> 01:06:14,380
Michael had a work think last night
that we went to -

762
01:06:15,257 --> 01:06:18,801
- and I was accusing him of being
attracted to this woman he's working with.

763
01:06:19,595 --> 01:06:21,763
Was he?
I think so.

764
01:06:23,474 --> 01:06:25,433
You think there's something going on?

765
01:06:25,726 --> 01:06:27,252
It could be.

766
01:06:28,053 --> 01:06:29,979
I think he'd want that to be.

767
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:34,480
He's in Philadelphia with her right now.

768
01:06:35,235 --> 01:06:36,778
Are you worried?

769
01:06:38,447 --> 01:06:40,306
I think I make too big
a deal out of it.

770
01:06:40,307 --> 01:06:41,665
Why?

771
01:06:43,243 --> 01:06:45,703
It's 2:00 in the morning and
I'm here with you.

772
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:53,931
So when you think you could get up and have
absolutely no idea what a day will go?

773
01:06:54,379 --> 01:06:55,797
Eighty...

774
01:06:56,215 --> 01:06:59,967
Ninety... a thousand go by
without incident -

775
01:07:00,094 --> 01:07:01,719
and then all of a sudden...

776
01:07:02,262 --> 01:07:04,597
Hello!
Hello!

777
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,352
What if I hadn't come up for
coffee this morning?

778
01:07:10,395 --> 01:07:12,271
I would have called.

779
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:15,066
If my number changed?

780
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,569
I would have come upstairs.

781
01:07:19,571 --> 01:07:21,155
What about Michael?

782
01:07:27,165 --> 01:07:29,416
Why did you stop e-mailing me?

783
01:07:35,298 --> 01:07:37,258
Because it wasn't enough...

784
01:07:41,596 --> 01:07:45,349
Do you know how often I have to
make a choice, not to write.

785
01:07:46,059 --> 01:07:48,269
"Hello, Alex. How are you?"

786
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:50,479
"Where are you? What are you doing?"

787
01:07:51,481 --> 01:07:55,276
"Do you want to meet me?
Whatever".

788
01:07:56,153 --> 01:07:58,154
"This Friday for dinner?"

789
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:01,031
"Just to catch up".

790
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,539
You really touch me whenever
you feel like, don't you?

791
01:08:09,082 --> 01:08:10,499
No, I don't.

792
01:08:11,877 --> 01:08:16,046
I touch you a fraction of how
often I'd like to.

793
01:08:17,674 --> 01:08:18,983
Why?

794
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,889
Because I like you.

795
01:08:40,284 --> 01:08:41,910
I can't.

796
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:50,835
I can't do anymore,
and look him in the eye.

797
01:09:03,641 --> 01:09:07,435
You just told me he's away with
a woman you got upset about.

798
01:09:12,024 --> 01:09:14,275
Michael isn't doing anything...

799
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:32,877
I never told him about us.

800
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:35,427
Even when -

801
01:09:36,267 --> 01:09:38,967
I found the need to confess something.

802
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:40,468
Which is when?

803
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,930
When I'm drunk, or happy -

804
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:47,767
or after a fight, or in the middle of one -

805
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:50,561
when things slip out, this never does.

806
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:52,939
Why?
Would he be angry?

807
01:09:53,901 --> 01:09:55,860
He'd have no right to be.

808
01:09:57,196 --> 01:09:58,738
I gave you up.

809
01:10:12,128 --> 01:10:13,795
So what's Helen like?

810
01:10:30,438 --> 01:10:32,314
We have another couple of hours -

811
01:10:33,274 --> 01:10:35,275
- I don't want to spend them talking
about Helen.

812
01:10:37,945 --> 01:10:39,404
Come on...

813
01:10:42,692 --> 01:10:46,467
come
 here.

814
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:39,010
What time is it?
Six thirty.

815
01:14:06,539 --> 01:14:07,914
Laura...

816
01:14:08,082 --> 01:14:11,793
Michael, I don't need us to talk about it.

817
01:14:14,338 --> 01:14:16,589
Last night...
Michael, please.

818
01:14:17,758 --> 01:14:19,133
Just don't.

819
01:14:24,265 --> 01:14:26,307
I didn't think that would happen.

820
01:14:27,061 --> 01:14:28,853
Not even a second time?

821
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,712
Well there's so much going on
right now, isn't it?

822
01:15:46,498 --> 01:15:49,458
What I wouldn't give to have tired
of you.

823
01:15:57,092 --> 01:16:00,186
Let me drop you off.
No, I'd rather walk.

824
01:16:00,295 --> 01:16:02,271
Are you sure?
Yes, it would be good for her.

825
01:16:02,272 --> 01:16:03,647
It would be good for me.

826
01:16:05,559 --> 01:16:09,020
Let's not do this in a big way, ok?
Please.

827
01:16:16,862 --> 01:16:18,279
See ya!

828
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,793
<i>It's possible I overreacted.</i>

829
01:17:42,794 --> 01:17:44,187
<i>I know that. I know you.</i>

830
01:17:44,188 --> 01:17:45,574
<i>And I love you.
Jo.</i>

831
01:18:27,074 --> 01:18:28,825
Hey Andy, it's me.

832
01:18:30,828 --> 01:18:32,704
I need you to cover for me.

833
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:11,120
Hey.
Hey.

834
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,539
Are you ready?
Yeah. Where's Michael?

835
01:19:14,304 --> 01:19:15,804
He had to go back to New York.

836
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:18,405
Is everything ok?

837
01:19:18,478 --> 01:19:21,063
Yeah, he left me a voicemail.

838
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:23,215
I guess, Stuart needed him
to go back.

839
01:19:24,842 --> 01:19:26,218
Okay...

840
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:27,845
I'll see you out front.

841
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:19,557
Joey...

842
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:21,589
What are you doing back?

843
01:21:22,716 --> 01:21:24,383
What's Lucy doing here?

844
01:21:25,343 --> 01:21:27,678
We got locked out of Andy's.

845
01:21:27,846 --> 01:21:30,306
Who?
Me and Lucy.

846
01:21:31,516 --> 01:21:32,850
When?

847
01:21:34,561 --> 01:21:39,482
Last night, when I went over to walk her.

848
01:21:40,066 --> 01:21:41,692
You've been crying, Joey?

849
01:21:42,777 --> 01:21:44,153
A bit.

850
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,792
What are you doing back?

851
01:21:49,254 --> 01:21:50,963
We finished up early.

852
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:54,675
Thought the presentation was today?

853
01:21:54,801 --> 01:21:57,720
No, we finished up early.

854
01:22:04,311 --> 01:22:06,145
I'm sorry about our fight.

855
01:22:09,399 --> 01:22:11,067
Yeah, so am I.

856
01:22:13,111 --> 01:22:16,239
Let's not talk about it, okay?

857
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:22,078
Let's have a great lunch, let's walk.

858
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:24,455
Let's make a day of it.

859
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:27,917
Okay.

860
01:22:30,587 --> 01:22:31,963
Does she want to go out?

861
01:22:32,089 --> 01:22:33,881
Probably.

862
01:22:34,007 --> 01:22:37,134
I'll take her.
Come on.

863
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:51,148
Are you okay?
Yeah.

864
01:23:03,537 --> 01:23:05,162
I love you.

865
01:23:35,063 --> 01:23:40,063
