1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,320
What are you looking at, Caroline?
-The wind, mom.

2
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,600
They say a hurricane is coming.

3
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,200
I feel like I'm on a boat...
drifting.

4
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,720
Can I do anything for you, mom?
Make anything easier?

5
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,320
Oh, sugar. There is
nothing left to do.

6
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,400
It is what it is.

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,600
I'm finding it harder
to keep my eyes open.

8
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,880
My mouth's full of... cotton.

9
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,000
There, there, miss Daisy.
You will scratch yourself to ribbons.

10
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,760
Do you want any more
medication, mother?

11
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,480
Doctor said you can
have as much as you want.

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,480
No need for anybody to suffer.

13
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,880
A friend told me that...

14
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,520
she never had a chance to say
goodbye to her mother.

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,320
I wanted to tell you...

16
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,560
how much I'm gonna miss you.
Mom.

17
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,960
Oh, Caroline.

18
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,400
Are you afraid?
-I'm curious.

19
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,000
What comes next...

20
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,480
They built that train
station in 1918.

21
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,880
Our father was there
the day it opened.

22
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,000
He said that...

23
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,800
a tuba band was playing.

24
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,640
They had the finest clockmaker
in all of the South

25
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,240
to build that glorious clock.

26
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,160
His name was

27
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,560
Mr Gateau.

28
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,760
Mr Cake.

29
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,360
He was married to a Creole
of Evangeline Parish

30
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,400
and they had a son.

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,840
Mr Gateau was from birth
absolutely blind.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,240
When their son was old enough,
he joined the army.

33
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,560
They prayed God would keep him
out of harm's way.

34
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,360
For months, he did nothing
but work on that clock.

35
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,240
One day a letter came.

36
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:03,600
Mr Gateau, done for the night,
went up alone to bed.

37
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,000
And their son came home.

38
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,760
They burried him
in a family plot

39
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,960
where he would be with them
when their time came.

40
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,800
Mr Cake worked on his clock,

41
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,240
laboring to finish.

42
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,880
It was a morning to remember.

43
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,320
Papa said there were
people everywhere.

44
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,320
Even Teddy Roosevelt came.

45
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,680
It's running backwards!

46
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,400
I made it that way.

47
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,920
So that perhaps the boys
that we lost in a war

48
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,840
might stand and
come home again.

49
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
Home to farm,

50
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
work,

51
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,560
have children,

52
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,760
to live long, full lives.

53
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,320
Perhaps my own son
might come home again.

54
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,160
I'm sorry if I offended anybody.

55
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,880
I hope you enjoy my clock.

56
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,960
Mr Cake was never seen again.

57
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,960
Some say he died
of a broken heart.

58
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,560
Some say he went to sea...

59
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,560
Excuse me, do you mind
if I make a call?

60
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,560
Somebody's watching
my little boy. -Sure.

61
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,080
I hope I haven't
disappointed you.

62
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,280
You couldn't disappoint me.

63
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,040
Well, I...

64
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,520
I know I don't have much
to show for myself.

65
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,640
The suitcase.

66
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,600
There's a diary.

67
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,360
This?

68
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,400
Could you read it to me, dear?
-Is this what you wanna do?

69
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,360
I tried to read it a hundred
different times...

70
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,000
Mom, it's not exactly...

71
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,920
Just the sound of
your voice, darling.

72
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,880
It's dated "April 4th, 1985."

73
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,800
It says, "New Orleans."

74
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,880
This is my last will
and testament.

75
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,280
I don't have much to leave,
few possessions, no money really.

76
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,080
I will go out of this world
the same way I came in,

77
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,120
alone and with nothing.
All I have is my story.

78
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,920
I'm writing it now
while I still remember it.

79
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,120
My name is Benjamin.
Benjamin Button.

80
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,880
And I was born under
unusual circumstances.

81
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,040
The first world war had ended.

82
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,360
I've been told it was an
especially good night to be born.

83
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,320
We won the war!

84
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,800
What are you doing here?
-Thomas...

85
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm afraid she's gonna die.
-What?

86
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,000
That's enough! All of you!
Get away from her!

87
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,320
I came as quickly as I could.
The streets are filled with people.

88
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,240
Thomas, promise me
he has a place...

89
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,760
Yeah.

90
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,560
She gave her life for me.

91
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,160
And for that,
I am forever grateful.

92
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,000
Mr Button...!

93
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,760
Thomas!

94
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,400
Thomas, wait!

95
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,080
Hey, what are you doing there!?
What do you have there?

96
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,360
The air is sweet.

97
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,440
You look very handsome
tonigh, miss Queenie.

98
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Handsome as I ever seen you.

99
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,560
The brown matches your eyes.
-Oh, hush!

100
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,880
You ain't no slouch yourself.

101
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,760
Hambert's back in town.
He came home legless...

102
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,320
but he home... I know you was
sweet on him one time...

103
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,920
Sweeter than I shoulda been...
-Miss Simone messed herself.

104
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,160
Sweet Jesus! She got to stop
doing that, or it's diapers for her.

105
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,600
-I'll be right there!
-C'mon, it's awful nice out here.

106
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,360
Come out back for a moment,
take your mind off things.

107
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,880
What in God's name...!?

108
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Oh, the Lord done
something here...!

109
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,000
I hope I didn't hurt it none,
steppin' on it like that.

110
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,800
We best leave that for
the police. -Oh, baby.

111
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,840
I'll go.

112
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,040
It's for sure nobody wanted
to keep it. Come on, baby.

113
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,360
Quennie!
-Hold your water!

114
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
I'll be back.

115
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,080
She went and messed
herself all over again...

116
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,480
Jane Childress, start her a bath.

117
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,880
And mind your own
business, Mrs Duprey.

118
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,080
You'll be messing yourself
soon enough.

119
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Somebody stole my necklace.

120
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,520
OK, Mrs Hollister, I'll be right
with you. Go on back upstairs.

121
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,000
You are as ugly as an old pot,
but you still a child of God.

122
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,800
Queenie, she won't go
take a bath without you.

123
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Mercy... I'll be right there!

124
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,080
You just wait right
here for me, okay?

125
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,200
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

126
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,840
Somebody's been
stealing my jewelry.

127
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,560
They are right here,
Mrs Hollister. See?

128
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,360
Right around your pretty
white neck. Now come on.

129
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,880
Your heart is strong. You want
to avoid any undue stimulation.

130
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,680
I trust you ladies will
help me out with that?

131
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,520
I've never seen anything like it,
nearly blind from cataracts.

132
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,040
I'm not sure if he can hear,
bones indicate severe arthritis.

133
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,640
His skin has lost all elasticity
and his hands and feet are ossified.

134
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,720
He shows all the deterioration,

135
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,320
the infirmities not of
a newborn, but of a man

136
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,320
well in his eighties on his way
to the grave. -He's dying?

137
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,160
His body's failing him
before his life's begun.

138
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,920
Where did he come from?
-It's my sister's child.

139
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,120
From Lafayette. She had
an unfortunate adventure.

140
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Poor child, he got the worse of it.
Come out white.

141
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,960
There are places for 'unwanted'
babies like these, Queenie.

142
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,000
No room for another
mouth to feed here.

143
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,880
The Nolan Foundation,
despite their good intentions,

144
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,080
thinks this place is a large
nuisance as it is. A baby...

145
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,360
You said he don't have long.

146
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,640
Queenie, some creatures
aren't meant to survive.

147
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,560
No, this baby here is a
miracle, that's for certain.

148
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,360
Just not the kind of miracle
one hopes to see.

149
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Now listen! Listen up here!
We gonna have us a visitor

150
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,520
that's gonna be staying
with us for a little while.

151
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,720
My sister had a child, but she
couldn't see right by it. So...

152
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,560
He's known as...

153
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,040
Benjamin.

154
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,920
Benjamin...
He's not a well child,

155
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,680
so we're gonna have to
take good care of him.

156
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,720
I had ten children, there's
not a baby I can't care for.

157
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,120
Let me see him.

158
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,560
Oh, God in heaven, he looks
just like my ex husband.

159
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,520
Look, he's prematurely old.

160
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,600
Doctor Rose said he ain't got
much more time on this earth.

161
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,040
Join the club.

162
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Oh, smile!

163
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Hambert sends his
remembrances to you.

164
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,480
Are you right out of your mind?

165
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,920
I know you ain't got all the parts
it takes to make one of your own,

166
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,160
but this ain't yours to keep,
it may not even be human kind.

167
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,520
Mr Weathers, come back here!

168
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,800
Please.

169
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,520
"You never know
what's comin' for you."

170
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,360
It seemed I'd found a home.

171
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Is any of this true?

172
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,840
You have such a lovely voice.

173
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,440
Mom, there's an ancient
streetcar token.

174
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,960
That clock just kept going,

175
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,480
year after year after year...

176
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,320
I didn't know I was a child.
-Same old crap every day.

177
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,120
I thought I was like
everyone else there.

178
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,400
An old man in a
twilight of his life.

179
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,160
Stop bangin' that fork. It's used
for eating, not for playin' with.

180
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,720
And use your napkin,
please Mr. Benjamin.

181
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,000
Queenie!

182
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Hey, boy!

183
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,400
I always had a healthy curiosity.

184
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,640
What was up the street,
or around the next corner?

185
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,280
Benjamin! That is dangerous.
Come back over here!

186
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,040
Stay put, child!

187
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,080
I loved her very much.
She was my mother.

188
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,240
Momma... momma!

189
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,360
Some days I feel different
than the day before.

190
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,960
Everybody feels different about
themselves one way or another.

191
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,400
But we're all goin' the same way.

192
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,680
Just taking different roads
to get there, that's all.

193
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,120
You're on your own road,
Benjamin.

194
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,200
Momma, how much longer I got?

195
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,440
Just be thankful for
what you're given.

196
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,080
You already here longer
than you supposed to.

197
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,240
Some nights,
I'd have to sleep alone.

198
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,960
I didn't mind. I would listen
to the house breathing.

199
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,680
All those people sleeping.

200
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,160
I felt safe.

201
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,320
It was a place of great routine.

202
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,320
Every morning at 5:30
no matter the weather,

203
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,560
General Winslow, US army
retired, raised the flag.

204
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,320
Mrs Sybil Wagner, once an
opera singer of some note,

205
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,760
well, she sang Wagner.

206
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,840
Alright, c'mon.

207
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,480
We gotta put some life into
these old sticks for you.

208
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,920
get you walkin'.

209
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,920
No matter the season, supper
was served promptly at 5:30.

210
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,080
Mol-asses...
-Molasses.

211
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,200
Molasses.

212
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,960
I learned to read
when I was five.

213
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,840
My grandfather was
a dresser for a famous actor.

214
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,680
He brought home every
play for me to read.

215
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,640
"Kind keepers of my
weak decaying age

216
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,440
let dying Mortimer
here rest himself.

217
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Even like a man new
haled from the rack.

218
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,920
So fare my limbs with
long imprisonment.

219
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,000
And these gray locks,
the pursuivants of death,

220
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,080
argue the end of
Edmund Mortimer."

221
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,560
You thought I was
plain ignorant, didn't you?

222
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,200
The actor my grandfather worked
for was John Wilkes Booth.

223
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,280
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

224
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,280
You never know
what's coming for you.

225
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,080
On saturday nights, momma
would make me go to church.

226
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,360
Benjamin!

227
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,640
Amen!

228
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,760
What can I do for you, sister?

229
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,000
Her parts are all
twisted up inside,

230
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,320
she can't have little children.

231
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins

232
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,920
so she can bear
the fruit of the womb.

233
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,320
Out damnable affliction!
Praise God!

234
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,800
Hallelujah!

235
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,440
And what's this old
man's irrediction?

236
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,040
He's got the devil on his back,

237
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,240
trying to ride him into
the grave before his time.

238
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,800
Out, Zebuchar!
Out, Beelzebub!

239
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,040
How old are you?

240
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,040
Seven, but I look a lot older.

241
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,520
God bless you.
He's seven!

242
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,520
Now, this is a man with
optimism in his heart!

243
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,480
Belief in his soul!

244
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,840
We are all children
in the eyes of God!

245
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,880
We are gonna get you
out of that chair.

246
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,760
And we're gonna have you walk.
-It's all right.

247
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,800
In the name of God's glory,
rise up!

248
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,080
Come on!

249
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Come on, man!

250
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,000
Now God is gonna see you
the rest of the way.

251
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,640
He's gonna see this
little old man walk

252
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,240
without the use of
a crutch or a cane.

253
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,040
He's gonna see that you walk from
faith and divine inspiration alone!

254
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,800
Now walk.

255
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,760
Don't touch him!

256
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,440
Rise up, old man!

257
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,360
Rise up like Lazarus!

258
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,960
I said rise up!

259
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,600
Yes!

260
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,000
Say hallelujah!

261
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,160
Walk. Walk on.

262
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,360
Now, when I look back on it,
it was miraculous.

263
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,600
But you know the saying:

264
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,400
"The Lord giveth and
the Lord taketh away."

265
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,360
Praise be to the Lord
on the highest...!

266
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,680
There was so many birthdays.

267
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,360
So we wouldn't run out,
we would spare the candles.

268
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,240
You know I don't like birthdays
and I don't like cake.

269
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,400
And death was a common visitor.
People came and went.

270
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,400
You always knew
when someone left us.

271
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,560
There was a silence in the house.

272
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,280
It was a wonderful
place to grow up.

273
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,760
I was with people who had shed all
the inconsequences of earlier life.

274
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,280
Left wondering
about the weather,

275
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,800
the temperature of a bath,

276
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,040
the light at the end of the day.

277
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,200
For everyone that died, someone
would come to take their place.

278
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,320
I've been married five times.

279
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,600
My first wife and I are captured
by neighbor tribe of cannibals.

280
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,320
We escaped across the river.

281
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,320
My wife, she can't swim,
so, sadly, she eaten.

282
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,880
My second wife steps
on a cobra and dies.

283
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,920
It was very bad luck
to be married to me.

284
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,120
That's Mr Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

285
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,320
The next summer I'm captured...
-He's a pigmey.

286
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,440
...with six others
by Baschiele tribe.

287
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,040
They trade us for pigs,
shoes and beer

288
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,160
to a very strange
american man.

289
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,880
I hear you're not so old
as you looking.

290
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,320
You just foolin' everybody.

291
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,680
What's the matter,
did you get Madjembe?

292
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,800
What's madjembe?
-Worms.

293
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,720
I don't think I have worms.
This is just how I am.

294
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,280
Come, let's get a cold root beer.

295
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,480
I found medication
under your pillow.

296
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,280
I'm not supposed to.
It's dangerous.

297
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,560
Who said that?
Come on, little man.

298
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,880
Hurry up.

299
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,680
Halt, please!

300
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,560
Then I am in the monkey house
at Philadelphia Zoological Park.

301
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,480
Three thousand people
show up my first day.

302
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,280
Look.

303
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,040
What's it like living
in a cage? -It stinks.

304
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,120
But the monkeys,
they do some tricks there.

305
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,640
I throw a spear...

306
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,040
wrestle with Kowali,
she is orangutan.

307
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,680
When I'm not playing
with the monkeys,

308
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,680
they want me to run to the bars
in my cage, with my teeth.

309
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,280
So then what did you do?
-Then I leave ZOO.

310
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,280
Go here, go there,
wander most of the time.

311
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,680
You were all alone?
-Plenty of time you'd be alone.

312
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,960
When you're different like us,
it's gonna be that way.

313
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,320
But I tell you a little secret.
Fat people, skinny people,

314
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,520
tall people, white people...
they're just as alone as we are.

315
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,520
But they are scared shitless.

316
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,040
I think about the river
I grew up on.

317
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,680
It would be nice to sit
by my river again.

318
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,080
Come. I have an appointment.

319
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,840
There's my little man.
You ready, sugar?

320
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,320
Always ready.
Always ready.

321
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,280
Filamena, mr Benjamin.

322
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,120
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
-My pleasure, ma'am.

323
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,520
You can find your own
way home, can't you?

324
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,240
Take the St. Charles
line to Napoleon.

325
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,440
Where in God's name
have you been? Get in here!

326
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,400
Youre goin' to take my breath
away, you know that?

327
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,160
Oh Lord, I was so
worried about you.

328
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,120
It had been the best
day of my life.

329
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,880
How's her breathing?
-Shallow.

330
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,160
They're sayin' it will
reach us in few hours.

331
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,600
I gotta get my baby
and take him to my sister's.

332
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,360
They say there's nothin' to worry
about here in the hospital.

333
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,000
Nurses will be right here if you
need them. Are you okay?

334
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,240
Yeah, I'm okay, reading...

335
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,840
I shouldn't be more
than an hour.

336
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,080
Was there just company?

337
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,120
It was just Dorothy leaving.

338
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,760
Go on, Caroline.

339
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,200
On sundays, the families
would come and visit.

340
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,200
It was Thanksgiving, 1930.

341
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,320
I met the person who
changed my life forever.

342
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,400
Well, Benjamin...

343
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,920
Might I say you are looking
strikingly youthful.

344
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,040
Good day, Mrs Fuller.

345
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,200
A single cane,
back straight as an arrow...

346
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,000
What elixir have
you been drinking?

347
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,800
-Thank you, Ma'am.
-Grandma, look at me!

348
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,720
That was really something!
Come on over here, you.

349
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:21,120
This is my granddaughter Daisy.
This is mister...

350
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,520
I'm afraid, Benjamin, I don't
rightly know your last name.

351
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Benjamin is fine.

352
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,560
I never forgot her blue eyes.

353
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,800
Good people, supper is served.

354
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,840
Did you know turkeys
aren't really birds?

355
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,640
-Why do you say that?
-They're in the pheasant family.

356
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,920
They can hardly fly. Sad, don't
you think? Birds that can't fly.

357
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,560
I like birds that can't fly.
They are so delicious.

358
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,840
-That's cruel.
-I have something to tell you all.

359
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,040
While we're giving thanks
for God's blessings...

360
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,680
I've had a miracle happen.

361
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,480
The Lord saw fit to
answer my prayers.

362
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,200
What does she mean
"answers her prayers"?

363
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,440
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

364
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,800
That's what my momma said when
I was gonna have a baby brother.

365
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,520
But he didn't live long.

366
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Cause he didn't breathe right.

367
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,040
...when he got his
beautiful hind legs

368
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,080
just as big God Ngog
had promised.

369
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,080
You can see that
it's five o'clock,

370
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,680
because big God
Ngog's clock says so.

371
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,080
Isn't that something?

372
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,920
-Again. Read it again.
-Read it again, please.

373
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,760
Alright. But afterwards,
you must go to bed.

374
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,000
I promise.

375
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,400
Old Man Kangaroo...

376
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,840
Are you sleeping?

377
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,880
-Who is that?
-It's me, Daisy.

378
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,040
-Hi!
-Come on!

379
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,160
Where are we going?
-Come on. Right in here.

380
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,800
Here, you light it. -I'm not
supposed to play with matches.

381
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Don 't be a chicken.
Light it!

382
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,960
I'll tell you a secret if
you'll tell me one. -Okay.

383
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,080
I saw my momma
kissing another man.

384
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,880
Her face was red from it.

385
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,560
Your turn.

386
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,240
I'm not as old as I look.
-I thought so.

387
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,520
You don't seem like an old
person. Like my grandma.

388
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,720
-I'm not.
-Are you sick?

389
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Well, I heard momma
and Tizzy whisper

390
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,680
and they said I was
gonna die soon.

391
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,320
But maybe not.

392
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,200
You're odd.

393
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,080
You're different than
anybody I've ever met.

394
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,240
May I? -Okay.

395
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,760
What are you doing
under there?

396
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,280
You come right out here
and get back up to bed.

397
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
It's after midnight!

398
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,080
You are not to be playing
together. -Yes, ma'am.

399
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,120
Not many people experience that.

400
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,080
You want me to go on?

401
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,640
What about your friend?
The tall lady?

402
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,600
We're not friends anymore.

403
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,360
That's what happens with
tall people sometimes.

404
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,680
Well... goodbye.

405
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,440
I spent a lot of time
by myself that year.

406
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Hello?

407
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,960
-Hi. -I'm moving in today.

408
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,640
Welcome. We've been
expecting you.

409
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,000
Can you please show her up
to Mrs Rousseau's old room?

410
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,560
I'm sorry, but we usually
don't allow dogs in the house.

411
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,720
Well, she's old as the hills,
she's almost blind.

412
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
She won't be a
bother much longer.

413
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Well, alright, as long as she
stays out from underfoot.

414
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,720
As hard as I try,
I can't remember her name.

415
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,040
Mrs Lawson, or Mrs Hartford,
or maybe it was Maple?

416
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,440
It's funny how sometimes the
people we remember the least

417
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,520
make the greatest
impression on us.

418
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,880
I do remember
she wore diamonds.

419
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,560
And she always dressed in fine
clothing as if she's going out.

420
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,240
Although she never did and
nobody ever came to visit her.

421
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,240
She taught me
to play the piano.

422
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,800
It's not about
how well you play,

423
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
it's how you feel about
what you're playing.

424
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,200
Try this.

425
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,560
You cannot help but put
yourself into the music.

426
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,200
There were many changes. Some
you could see, some your couldn't.

427
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,680
Hair started growing
in all sorts of places.

428
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,560
Along with other things.

429
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,000
I felt pretty good, considering.

430
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,360
Oh, darlin', the pain.
-Alright mom, I'll get the nurse.

431
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,960
Look at this eye.
This is a major hurricane.

432
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,240
Not doing too good?

433
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,800
Nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave.

434
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,560
I'm gonna ride it out.

435
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,160
There, that should make
things much easier.

436
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,440
Have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes?

437
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,280
My father waited 4 hours for my
brother to get here from Boger City.

438
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,640
Couldn't go without him.

439
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,960
She seems like a sweet woman.
-Yeah.

440
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,400
I haven't had as much time
with her... -Are you busy?

441
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,680
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

442
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,520
Queenie would let me go with
Mr Daws to Poverty Point,

443
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,520
to watch the boats go
up and down the river.

444
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,240
These were hard times.

445
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,480
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

446
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,760
Once when I was in the field
just tending to my cows.

447
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
My fourt' hand didn't show up.

448
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,760
Anybody wanna make 2 $
for a day's work around here?

449
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,720
What's the matter?

450
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,760
Nobody wants to do an honest day's
work for an honest day's pay?

451
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
He never pays.

452
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,520
Nobody wants the job?
-I do.

453
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,360
You got your sea legs, old man?

454
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,240
I think.

455
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,960
That's good enough for me.

456
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,280
Get your ass on board,
we'll sure as hell find out!

457
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,280
I was as happy as I could be.
-I need a volunteer!

458
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,000
I would do anything.
-Yes, captain!

459
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,080
-Scrape off all this bird shit.
-Right away, sir.

460
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,000
I was actually goin' to be paid for
something I would've done for free.

461
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,800
His name was
captain Mike Clark.

462
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,200
He'd been on a tugboat
since he was seven.

463
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,920
Get movin'!

464
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,920
Come here.

465
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,000
Could you... still get it up?

466
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,640
I do every morning.

467
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,880
The old pole? The hard'n?

468
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,680
I guess.

469
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,080
When was the last time
you had a woman?

470
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,040
Never. -Never?

471
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,640
Not that I know of, sir.

472
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,920
Wait a minute!

473
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,960
You mean to say, you've been on
this earth for how many years,

474
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,120
and you never had a woman?

475
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,800
Damn! That's the saddest
thing I ever heard in my life.

476
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,960
Never? -No.

477
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,160
Then, by Jesus,
you are comin' with me.

478
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,680
-What did your father do?
-I never met my father.

479
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,080
You lucky bastard!

480
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,960
All father's gonna do
is hold you down.

481
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,480
Out on my father's boat,
working da two-a-days.

482
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,640
This little fat bastard,
"tug Irish" they call him.

483
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,880
I finally get up the
nerves and tell him:

484
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,120
"I don't wanna spend da rest of
my life on a goddamn tugboat!"

485
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,320
You know what I'm sayin'?

486
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,280
You don't wanna spend the rest
of your life on a tugboat.

487
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,760
Absolutely, damn right!

488
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,560
And you know what
my father says to me?

489
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,880
He says: "Who the hell
do you think you are?"

490
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,520
"What the hell do you
think you can do?"

491
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,520
I tell him:

492
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,360
"Well, if you're askin'..."

493
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,760
"I wanna be an artist."

494
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,040
He laughs... "An artist?"

495
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,960
"God meant for you to work
a tugboat just like me."

496
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,360
"And that's exactly
what you're gonna do."

497
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,880
Well, I turned myself
into an artist.

498
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,680
A tattoo artist!

499
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,720
I put on every one
of these myself.

500
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,720
You have to skin me alive to
take my art away from me now!

501
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,920
When I'm dead, I'm gonna
send him my arm.

502
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,720
That one.

503
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,920
Don't let anyone
tell you different!

504
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,440
You gotta do what
you're meant to do.

505
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,240
And I happen to be
a god-damned artist!

506
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,960
But you're a tugboat captain.

507
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,880
Captain Mike, we're ready
for you and your friend.

508
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,760
Go, old timer.
Break your cherry.

509
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,760
Hello, ladies!

510
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,960
Hi.

511
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,880
He gives me the willies.
That is not for me.

512
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,800
How are you tonight, grandpa?

513
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,960
It was a night to remember.

514
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,880
What are you, Dick Tracy or
something? I've got to rest.

515
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,480
I can't.

516
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,520
Thank you. -No, thank you.
Have a nice night.

517
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,160
-Will you be here tomorrow?
-Every night but sunday.

518
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,480
It sure made me understand
the value of earning a living.

519
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,880
Things money can buy you.

520
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:44,080
It's nasty out. Can I offer
you a ride somewhere?

521
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,880
That's awfully kind of you, sir.

522
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,480
My name is Thomas. Thomas Button.
-I'm Benjamin.

523
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,200
Benjamin... it's a
pleasure to know you.

524
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,760
Would you like to stop
somewhere and have a drink?

525
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,760
All right.

526
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,800
Evening.

527
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,480
-What will it be, sir?
-I'll have whatever he's having.

528
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,520
A Sazerac for both of us.
With whiskey, not brandy.

529
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,800
You don't drink, do you?
-It's a night for firsts.

530
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,080
-How's that? -I've never
been to a brothel, either.

531
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,320
-It's an experience.
-Certainly is.

532
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,480
There's a first time for
everything. -Sure enough.

533
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,720
Your drinks.

534
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:50,400
I don't mean to be rude...
but your hands, is that painful?

535
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,000
I was born with some form of
disease. -What kind of disease?

536
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,520
I was born old.

537
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,720
-I'm sorry. -No need to be.
Nothing wrong with old age.

538
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,320
My wife passed away
many years ago.

539
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,520
I'm so so sorry.

540
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,040
She died in childbirth.

541
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,960
To children.
-To mothers.

542
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,160
What line of work are you in,
Mr Button? -Buttons.

543
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,600
Button's Buttons. There isn't
a button we don't make.

544
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,640
Our biggest competition is B.F.
Goodrich and his infernal zippers.

545
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,920
Would you gentlemen
like anything else?

546
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,400
One for the road, Benjamin?

547
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,400
Only if you let me
pay for it, Mr Button.

548
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,960
So, what line of
work do you do?

549
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,080
I'm a tugboat man.

550
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,280
I enjoyed talking to you.
-I enjoyed drinking with you.

551
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,760
Benjamin...

552
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,160
would you mind if, time to time,
I stop by and say hello?

553
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,040
Anytime.
Good night, Mr Button.

554
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,320
Good night, Benjamin.
Drive off.

555
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,520
Where have you been?

556
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,600
Nothing. I met some people
and listened to music...

557
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,440
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

558
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,480
Growing up is a funny thing.
Sneaks up on you.

559
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,040
One person is there
and then suddenly

560
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,320
somebody else is
taking their place.

561
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,960
She wasn't all elbows
and knees anymore.

562
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,960
-Benjamin! Come on.
-Okay.

563
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,480
I loved those weekends
when she'd come

564
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,880
and spend the night
with her grandmother.

565
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,240
Daisy! Daisy!

566
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,200
You wanna see something?

567
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,240
You gotta keep it a secret.

568
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,880
Get dressed.
I'll meet you out back.

569
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,160
Come on!

570
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,680
Can you swim?
-I can do anything you can do.

571
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,440
Put this on. We gotta hurry.

572
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,200
Is he okay? -Captain!

573
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,040
Captain Mike!

574
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,800
Morning, captain.
Can you take us out?

575
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,480
Do you know what day it is?
-Sunday.

576
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,680
You know what that means?

577
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,200
It means that I was
very drunk last night.

578
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,200
You're drunk every night.

579
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,200
Is that a girl? -A close friend.
I want to show her the river.

580
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,320
I'm not supposed to go
joy-ridin' with civilians.

581
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,320
I could lose my licence.

582
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,680
What are you waiting for?

583
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,600
She put in for repair.
A wounded duck.

584
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,840
She's flyin' now!

585
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,960
I wish we could go with them.

586
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Did you say something, mom?

587
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,880
It's getting really bad.

588
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,640
Can you hear me, mom?

589
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,680
Time just seeped out of me.

590
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,240
Things were changing quickly.

591
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:11,280
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

592
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,240
What if I told you that
I wasn't getting older,

593
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:18,040
but I was getting younger
than everybody else.

594
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,640
Well, I'd feel sorry for you.

595
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,960
To have to see everybody
you love die before you do.

596
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,240
It's an awful responsibility.

597
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,360
I've never thought about life
or death that way before.

598
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,440
Benjamin, we're meant to
lose the people we love.

599
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,720
How else would we know
how important they are to us.

600
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:47,880
And one fall day, a familiar
visitor came knocking on our door.

601
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,640
You wanna go with me
to the drugstore?

602
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,920
She taught me how to
play the piano. -Amen!

603
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,280
And she taught me what
it meant to miss somebody.

604
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,920
Let's go.

605
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,560
I had gone to a brothel,
I had my first drink,

606
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,600
Said goodbye to one friend
and burried another.

607
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,640
In 1936, when I was coming to the
end of the 17th year of my life,

608
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,520
I packed my bag
and said goodbye.

609
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,000
I knew, life being what it was,

610
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,640
I'd probably never
see them again.

611
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,800
Good luck to you, son.
-Thanks.

612
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,400
-I love you, mom.
-I love you too, baby.

613
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,840
I want you to say your
prayers every night, hear?

614
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,920
Be safe!

615
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,080
Benjamin!

616
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,920
Where are you going?
-Off to sea.

617
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,480
I'll send you a postcard.

618
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,560
From everywhere.

619
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,280
Write me a postcard
from everywhere.

620
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,240
Can you imagine?

621
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:58,000
He sent me a postcard
from everywhere he went.

622
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,640
Every place he worked.

623
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:09,120
Newfoundland, Baffin Bay,
Glasgow, Liverpool, Narvik...

624
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,720
He had gone with
that captain Mike.

625
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,560
Captain Mike had contracted for
three years with Moran Brothers

626
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,760
Tug and Salvage. The old
ship had been refitted

627
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,360
with a diesel engine
and a new sea winch.

628
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,400
We went around Florida
and up the Atlantic seaboard.

629
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,800
We were a crew of seven now.
Captain Mike and me,

630
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,040
the cookie, Prentiss Mayes
from Wilmington, Delaware.

631
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,240
The Brody twins, Rick and Vic
who got along fine at sea,

632
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,360
but for some reason,
once they were on dry land,

633
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,000
couldn't stand the sight
of each other. -Enough!

634
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,560
One in every eight
boats never returns...

635
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,920
There was John Grimm,
who sure fit his name.

636
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,840
...all hands lost at sea.

637
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,040
From Belvedere,
South Dakota.

638
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,440
And Pleasant Curtis
from Nashville,

639
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,640
who never said a word
to anyone, except himself.

640
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,960
I wrote him constantly.

641
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,360
I told him I had been invited
to audition in New York City,

642
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,440
for the School of American Ballet.

643
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,320
Please stay. Thank you.
Thank you.

644
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,400
You can stay.

645
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:31,760
I was relegated to the "corps".
Another dancing gypsy.

646
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,360
Benjamin, how is it
when you showed up,

647
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,840
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave.

648
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,560
Now... either I drink a helluva
lot more than I think I do,

649
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:54,160
or you sprouted!
What's your secret?

650
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,440
Well, Captain...

651
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,040
you do drink a lot.

652
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,320
We stayed in a small hotel with the
grand name, "The Winter Palace."

653
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,240
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

654
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,120
The hummingbird is
not just another bird.

655
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,320
Its heart rate is
1,200 beats a minute.

656
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,440
Its wings beat
80 times a second.

657
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:31,080
If you was to stop
their wings from beatin,

658
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,800
they would be dead in
less that ten seconds.

659
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:40,000
This is no ordinary bird,
this is a frikkin' miracle!

660
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,960
They slowed down their wings
with moving pictures,

661
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:54,080
and you know what they saw?
Their wingtips are doing...

662
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:03,000
You know what the figure "8"
is the mathematical symbol for?

663
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,960
Infinity!

664
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,400
Everybody, no matter
what differences they had,

665
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,640
languages, the color of their skin,
had one thing in common:

666
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,480
They were drunk
every single night.

667
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,520
Could you hold the lift, please?
-Thank you very much.

668
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,800
Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.

669
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,280
She was not beautiful.
She was plain as paper.

670
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,080
But she was pretty
as any picture to me.

671
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,040
What are you looking at?

672
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,560
If you must know, we have
a long standing agreement

673
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,760
never to go to bed sober.
Isn't that right, honey?

674
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,960
-Whatever you say, darling.
-Her husband was Walter Abbott.

675
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,360
He was Chief Minister of the
British Trade Mission in Murmansk.

676
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,960
And he was a spy.

677
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,840
Are you okay, darling?
-Oh yes.

678
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,600
I broke my heel off
one of my shoes.

679
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,600
I'm not in a habit of walking
about in my stocking feet.

680
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,960
They were long days there.

681
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,240
And even longer nights.

682
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:35,240
One particular night, I was
having trouble sleeping.

683
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,920
I'm sorry.

684
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,400
I couldn't sleep.

685
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,840
I was gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

686
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,240
No, thank you.

687
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,000
-Milk? Honey?
-A bit of honey, please.

688
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,760
I hope you like flies in your
honey. -Oh, perhaps not.

689
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:05,280
Maybe... better to
let it steep a little.

690
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,760
Steep? -Soak.

691
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,920
I don't know, I mean... there's
a proper way of making tea.

692
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,800
Where I'm from,
people just want it to be hot.

693
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,480
Well, quite right.

694
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,400
You're a seaman?
-Sailor.

695
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,400
I hope I'm not being impolite,
but I have to ask:

696
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,840
Aren't you a little old
to be working on a boat?

697
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,960
There's no age limit,
as long as you can do the work.

698
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,520
And you have trouble
sleeping? Thank you.

699
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,760
I didn't think I did.
I usually sleep like a baby.

700
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,120
Something kept me up.

701
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,320
My father, in his eighties,

702
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,440
he was so convinced
he's gonna die in his sleep,

703
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,880
he limited himself to
having afternoon naps.

704
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,960
He was so determined
he was gonna cheat death.

705
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,280
Did he? -Did he what?
-Die in his sleep?

706
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,120
He died sitting in
his favorite chair,

707
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,920
listening to his favorite
program on the wireless.

708
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,320
He must have known something.

709
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,560
My husband is
British Trade Minister,

710
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,640
and we've been here
for fourteen months.

711
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,280
-Good God! -We were
supposed to go to Peking.

712
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:46,160
But it never seemed to work out.
Have you been in the Far East?

713
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:51,000
No. I've never been anywhere,
really. I mean outside harbors.

714
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:56,320
And where is it that you're from?
-New Orleans, Louisiana.

715
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,480
I didn't know
there was another.

716
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:05,360
And she told me about
all the places she had been.

717
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,040
What she had seen.

718
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,960
And we talked till
just before the dawn.

719
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:19,240
And we went back to our rooms,
to our separate lives.

720
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,480
But every night, we'd
meet again in that lobby.

721
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,280
A hotel in the middle of the
night can be a magical place.

722
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,040
A mouse running and stopping.

723
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,480
A radiator hissing.
A curtain blowing.

724
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,120
There's something peaceful,
even comforting,

725
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,520
knowing that people you love
are asleep in their beds,

726
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,840
where nothing can harm them.

727
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,360
Elizabeth and I would
lose track of the night,

728
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,360
till just before daybreak.

729
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,000
I think I may have given you
the wrong impression.

730
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,240
I beg your pardon?

731
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,040
Well, married women don't
customarily sit around

732
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,960
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels.

733
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,400
I wouldn't know what a married
woman does and doesn't do.

734
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,160
Good night!

735
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,880
Murmansk.

736
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,920
"I've met somebody and
I've fallen in love." Mom?

737
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,040
That was over 60 years ago.

738
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:57,360
-Did you love him, mother?
-What does a girl know about love?

739
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:38,720
I'm not dressed. -You look
splendid just as you are.

740
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,880
Don't waste any time bothering
about the wine or the cheese

741
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:47,920
in Murmansk, cause they are
really completely ordinary.

742
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,960
But the caviar and the vodka

743
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:56,560
are sublime and plentiful.

744
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,440
So...

745
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:11,080
Savor it... and don't
eat it all at once.

746
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:15,800
Because that way, there's
nothing left to enjoy.

747
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,440
Now take a little swallow of vodka
while it's still in your mouth.

748
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,920
Nazdrovia.

749
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:39,600
You haven't been with
many women, have you?

750
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,600
Not on sundays.

751
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,360
And you've never had a girlfriend
before, have you? -No ma'am.

752
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,600
When I was nineteen,
I attempted to become

753
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:02,200
the first woman ever to
swim the English Channel.

754
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,560
Really?

755
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,040
But the current that day
was so strong that...

756
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,760
for every stroke I took,
I was pushed back two.

757
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:15,160
I was in the water
for 32 hours.

758
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:19,160
And when I was
two miles from Calais,

759
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,120
it started to rain.

760
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:28,800
When I couldn't go any further,

761
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,680
I stopped.

762
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,720
I just stopped.

763
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:39,560
And everybody asked me
would I try again.

764
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,800
Why wouldn't I?

765
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:48,560
I never did.
As a matter of fact,

766
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:52,880
I've never done anything
with my life after that.

767
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,120
Your hands are so coarse.

768
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:12,520
I can feel the wind
in your cheeks.

769
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,640
I'm afraid it's
the witching hour.

770
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,440
It was the first time
a woman had ever kissed me.

771
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,800
It's something
you never forget.

772
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:45,480
-Benjamin!
-You make me feel younger.

773
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:49,560
You make me feel years
younger too. I wish I was.

774
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,720
So many things I'd change.
I'd undo all my mistakes.

775
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,400
What mistakes?

776
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,040
I kept waiting, you know.

777
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:09,320
Thinking that I'd do something
to change my circumstances.

778
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,160
Do something.

779
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,720
Such an awful waste,
you never get it back.

780
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,400
Wasted time.

781
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,520
If we're going to have an affair,

782
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:31,040
you're never to look
at me during the day.

783
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:34,680
And we're always to
part before sunrise,

784
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,480
and we will never say
"I love you".

785
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,640
Those are the rules.

786
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:47,240
Are you cold?
-I'm freezing.

787
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,480
She was the first woman
that ever loved me.

788
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,120
Want me to skip some?

789
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:37,960
No, glad he had somebody
to keep him warm.

790
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,480
I couldn't wait
to see her again.

791
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:01,600
We saw each other every night.
We always used the same room.

792
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,680
But each time seemed
new and different.

793
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,720
Come here.

794
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,360
Elizabeth...

795
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,520
Good night.

796
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,920
Until one night.

797
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:10,400
<i>Yesterday, December 7th 1941,</i>
the day which will live in infamy.

798
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:19,000
...in the near future,
and possibly beyond.

799
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,640
There's been a change
of plan, lads.

800
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,360
As you may or may not know,

801
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,440
the Japs bombed
Pearl Harbor yesterday.

802
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,320
Frank D. Roosevelt asked
each of us to do our part.

803
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,760
The Chelsea's been commissioned
to serve in the United States Navy.

804
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:40,760
To repair, salvage
and to rescue.

805
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:46,200
Anybody doesn't wanna go to war,
now's the time to say so.

806
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:51,200
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

807
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,560
I've been meaning to
talk with you, Mike.

808
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,200
My wife's doing poorly.

809
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,600
I'd like to maybe
see her one more time.

810
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:08,400
You're free to make your way
home any way you can, Mr Mayes.

811
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,720
If he's leaving,
who's gonna cook?

812
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,760
Food poisoning is one of the
leading causes of death at sea.

813
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,160
Right after inadequate
safety equipment.

814
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:24,240
I can cook, captain.
Been doin' it all my life.

815
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:28,280
Yeah, I knew it. You're a little
too old for war, Benjamin.

816
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,840
Ah, what the hell.
I'll take any man

817
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,640
who wants to kick the shit
out of Japs and Huns.

818
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:41,360
That's it! Back to your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen!

819
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,680
She had left a note.

820
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,640
She wrote "It was nice
to have met you."

821
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,440
And that was it.

822
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,800
It wasn't the war
any of us expected.

823
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,880
We just towed crippled ships.
Scraps of metal, really.

824
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,920
If there was a war,
we didn't see it.

825
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,960
There was a man assigned to us.
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.

826
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,240
But most of all,
he loved America.

827
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,040
There is no other
country in the world!

828
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,640
When you spell A.M.E.R.I.C.A,
you're spelling freedom.

829
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,160
His name was Dennis Smith and
he was a full blooded Cherokee.

830
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,320
His family had been americans
for over 500 years.

831
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,160
These pacifists. They say
they won't fight on conscience.

832
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,440
Where would we be...

833
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,840
if everybody decided to act
according to their conscience?

834
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,120
Keep it down, would you chief!

835
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,000
Hey...

836
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,400
I've been watching you.
You seem trustworthy.

837
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,600
If something happens to me,

838
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,840
could you see that
this gets to my wife?

839
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:19,320
He had given me all of his pay.
Hadn't spent a dime of it.

840
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:25,280
I want my family to know
that I was thinking about them.

841
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,680
All hands on deck!

842
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,600
Get you asses up here,
you lazy bastards!

843
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,520
The war had finally found us.

844
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,280
Full stop!

845
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,160
Pleasant, get on that light.

846
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:21,320
A transport carrying 1300 men
had been split by a torpedo.

847
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,600
We were first to
arrive at the scene.

848
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,840
Stop the engine!
Full stop!

849
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,120
We were the only sound.

850
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,640
Fellows!

851
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:11,160
We surely can't count
to outrun them fuckers.

852
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,160
Battle stations!

853
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,800
What?

854
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:44,040
Is that the last one?

855
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,280
Captain!

856
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:25,200
They shot the hell
out of my paintin'!

857
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,200
Give me your hand.

858
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,240
You'll be alright,
captain Mike.

859
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39,440
Nice spot in heaven's
waitin' for you. Nice spot.

860
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:44,080
You could be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

861
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:49,560
You could swear,
curse the fates...

862
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,560
but when it comes to the end...

863
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,760
you have to let go.

864
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,480
Captain.

865
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,080
1328 men died that day.

866
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,200
I said my goodbyes to the
Cherokee, Dennis Smith.

867
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,800
John Grimm who was right,
he was gonna die there.

868
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,680
I sent Pleasant Curtis'
wife his money.

869
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,160
I said goodbye to
the twin, Vic Brody,

870
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:53,400
and to Mike Clark, captain
of the tugboat "Chelsea."

871
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:59,360
I said goodbye to all the other men,
who had dreams of their own.

872
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,000
All the men who wanted to be
insurance salesmen or doctors

873
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,880
or lawyers or Indian chiefs.

874
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,840
This don't get fixed.

875
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,320
Out here, death
didn't seem natural.

876
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:34,560
I had never seen a hummingbird
that far out to sea.

877
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,840
Before or since.

878
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,960
And in may of 1945,
when I was 26 years old...

879
01:21:49,166 --> 01:21:51,166
I'm coming!

880
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:58,153
Queenie? -Yes.

881
01:22:01,689 --> 01:22:05,577
Oh, sweet Jesus!
You're home!

882
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:10,120
Lord, you came back!
Let me look at you!

883
01:22:10,372 --> 01:22:13,238
Who's that, mama? -Child,
it's your brother, Benjamin.

884
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,197
I didn't know he
was my brother.

885
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:17,648
There's a shit load of
things you don't know.

886
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:20,649
Finish sweeping, wash your hands
and help me with the table. C'mon!

887
01:22:20,849 --> 01:22:24,100
Turn around. Oh, you look
like you've been born again!

888
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:26,616
Younger than the springtime.

889
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:30,292
I think that preacher laid the hands
on you gave you a second life.

890
01:22:30,493 --> 01:22:33,916
I knew it the moment
I saw you, you were special.

891
01:22:34,117 --> 01:22:37,874
I tell you what, my knees are
sore cause I've been on them

892
01:22:38,075 --> 01:22:42,232
every night asking the Lord,
I say God, bring him home safely.

893
01:22:42,556 --> 01:22:44,901
Remember what I told you?

894
01:22:45,137 --> 01:22:49,752
You never know what's comin'
for you? -That's right. Sit down.

895
01:22:52,337 --> 01:22:56,028
Did you learn anything
worth repeating?

896
01:22:56,429 --> 01:23:01,104
-I sure saw some things.
-Oh, you've seen some pain.

897
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:07,100
Some joy too? -Sure, sure I did.
-Yeah, that's what I wanna hear.

898
01:23:08,107 --> 01:23:11,105
Look at you...
-Where's Tizzy?

899
01:23:11,306 --> 01:23:13,322
Oh, baby!

900
01:23:14,997 --> 01:23:19,038
Mr Weathers died in his sleep
one night last april.

901
01:23:19,239 --> 01:23:23,649
Mama, I'm so sorry. -Don't you
worry about that, baby.

902
01:23:24,268 --> 01:23:27,328
Well, there's only one or
two of them left now.

903
01:23:27,529 --> 01:23:29,529
They're all just about new.

904
01:23:29,729 --> 01:23:32,811
I guess they're waitin' their
turn like everybody else.

905
01:23:33,012 --> 01:23:35,562
I'm so glad you're
back home with me.

906
01:23:35,763 --> 01:23:38,772
Now we're going to find you
a wife and a new job.

907
01:23:38,973 --> 01:23:41,978
Come and help me
with this table.

908
01:23:43,988 --> 01:23:47,233
Benjamin! You're wasting
your time, baby.

909
01:23:47,517 --> 01:23:49,601
She's stone deaf.

910
01:23:49,802 --> 01:23:53,402
You'll be staying in what was
Mrs DeSeroux's old room.

911
01:23:53,602 --> 01:23:57,487
You're too big to be rooming
with anybody else.

912
01:24:00,032 --> 01:24:03,262
It's a funny thing
about coming home.

913
01:24:03,587 --> 01:24:07,622
Looks the same. Smells
the same. Feels the same.

914
01:24:09,805 --> 01:24:14,900
Did I ever tell you I've been
struck by lightning 7 times?

915
01:24:15,223 --> 01:24:20,108
Once when I was sitting in my
truck, minding my own business.

916
01:24:24,512 --> 01:24:28,912
You realise
what's changed, is you.

917
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:35,450
And late one morning,
not long after I'd been back...

918
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:07,025
Excuse me, is Queenie here?

919
01:25:07,558 --> 01:25:09,381
Daisy?

920
01:25:11,914 --> 01:25:15,931
It's me, Benjamin.
-Benjamin?

921
01:25:19,374 --> 01:25:21,583
Oh my God!

922
01:25:22,322 --> 01:25:25,789
Of course it's you! Benjamin!

923
01:25:28,178 --> 01:25:29,979
How are you?

924
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:33,013
It's been such a long time!
There's so much I wanna know!

925
01:25:33,214 --> 01:25:36,125
When did you get back?
-I got back few weeks ago.

926
01:25:36,326 --> 01:25:38,878
I spoke to Queenie, she said
you were in the war,

927
01:25:39,079 --> 01:25:42,703
somewhere at sea, we were so
worried about you. -I'm okay.

928
01:25:43,601 --> 01:25:47,333
Well, look at you.
You are so lovely.


929
01:25:49,206 --> 01:25:51,861
You stopped writing.

930
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:58,416
When I had left she was a girl.
And a woman had taken her place.

931
01:25:58,617 --> 01:26:01,760
She was the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

932
01:26:01,961 --> 01:26:03,966
Beautiful.

933
01:26:05,255 --> 01:26:07,760
The most beautiful.

934
01:26:09,002 --> 01:26:12,228
You remember grandma Fuller?
-Sure I do. -She passed.

935
01:26:12,435 --> 01:26:14,674
I heard that, I'm sorry.

936
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:17,775
I just can't believe
we're both here.

937
01:26:17,975 --> 01:26:21,985
Must be fate... no, no,
what did he call it? Kismet.

938
01:26:22,186 --> 01:26:25,612
Do you know about Edgar Cayce,
the psychic? -I don't believe I...

939
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:29,413
He says that everything
is predetermined, but...

940
01:26:29,614 --> 01:26:32,914
I like to think
that it is fate.

941
01:26:34,858 --> 01:26:38,224
I'm not sure how it works,
but I'm glad it happened.

942
01:26:38,425 --> 01:26:42,024
Have you been to Manhattan?
It's right across the river from me.

943
01:26:42,225 --> 01:26:45,826
I can see the Empire State
Building if I stand on my bed.

944
01:26:46,027 --> 01:26:49,053
What about you, where've
you been? Tell me everything.

945
01:26:49,254 --> 01:26:52,302
Last time you wrote, you said
you've been to Russia.

946
01:26:52,503 --> 01:26:56,120
I always wanted to go to Russia.
Is it as cold as they say?

947
01:26:56,321 --> 01:26:59,326
-Twice as cold.
-My goodness!

948
01:26:59,674 --> 01:27:04,874
We always said you were different.
I think you really are.

949
01:27:06,213 --> 01:27:10,178
You wrote that you met
somebody. Did it work out?

950
01:27:10,379 --> 01:27:12,929
It ran its course.

951
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:16,391
Hey, do you remember this?

952
01:27:26,316 --> 01:27:31,716
This is the picture of Old Man
Kangaroo at 5 in the afternoon.

953
01:27:33,075 --> 01:27:36,230
Would you like to have dinner?

954
01:27:42,913 --> 01:27:46,344
Did I tell you that I danced
for Ballenchine?

955
01:27:46,545 --> 01:27:51,545
He's a famous choreographer.
He said that I had perfect line.

956
01:27:52,738 --> 01:27:56,826
In a rehearsal once,
a dancer fell.

957
01:27:57,093 --> 01:27:59,813
And he just put it
right into the production.

958
01:28:00,114 --> 01:28:03,564
Can you imagine that
in a classical ballet?

959
01:28:03,765 --> 01:28:06,955
A dancer intentionally falling?

960
01:28:07,156 --> 01:28:10,970
There's a whole new word for
dance now, it's called abstract.

961
01:28:11,171 --> 01:28:14,971
He's not the only one though,
there's Lincoln Kirstein,

962
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:18,534
and Lucia Chase
and Agnes DeMille...

963
01:28:18,735 --> 01:28:22,174
she has just torn up
all those conventions,

964
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:25,646
all that straight up
and down stuff...

965
01:28:26,447 --> 01:28:29,133
And she told me about
this big new world.

966
01:28:29,334 --> 01:28:31,784
Names that didn't
mean a thing to me.

967
01:28:31,985 --> 01:28:34,822
I didn't really hear very much
of what she was saying.

968
01:28:35,023 --> 01:28:37,286
It's new and modern
and it's American.

969
01:28:37,487 --> 01:28:39,787
They understand our vigor
and our physicality.

970
01:28:39,987 --> 01:28:42,343
Oh my God, I've just been
talking and talking.

971
01:28:42,544 --> 01:28:44,744
No, no, I've enjoyed listening.

972
01:28:44,944 --> 01:28:48,769
I didn't know you smoked.
-I'm old enough.

973
01:28:51,325 --> 01:28:54,975
I'm old enough
for a lot of things.

974
01:28:57,024 --> 01:29:00,124
In New York we stay up all night.

975
01:29:00,425 --> 01:29:03,895
Watch the sun come up
over the warehouses.

976
01:29:05,687 --> 01:29:08,757
There's always something to do.

977
01:29:25,812 --> 01:29:28,795
I have to go back tomorrow.

978
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:32,236
-So soon?
-Wish I could stay.

979
01:29:35,789 --> 01:29:39,329
Dancers don't need costumes
or scenery anymore.

980
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:43,120
I can imagine dancing
completely naked.

981
01:29:43,967 --> 01:29:48,214
Have you read D.H. Lawrence?
His books were banned.

982
01:29:48,515 --> 01:29:52,181
The words are like making love.

983
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:41,813
In our company,
we have to trust each other.

984
01:30:46,733 --> 01:30:50,416
Sex is a part of it.

985
01:30:54,703 --> 01:30:58,123
I know a lot of the dancers
are lesbians.

986
01:30:59,768 --> 01:31:03,608
There was one woman who
wanted to sleep with me.

987
01:31:10,177 --> 01:31:13,832
Was that upseting you?
-Which part?

988
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:18,168
Somebody wanted to sleep with me?
-You're a desirable woman,

989
01:31:18,369 --> 01:31:22,067
I would think most of them
would wanna sleep with you.

990
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:25,268
Let's go back to the house.

991
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:29,169
Or we can get a room somewhere.

992
01:31:30,701 --> 01:31:34,285
We can lay down your jacket.
-I don't know, Daisy...

993
01:31:34,486 --> 01:31:39,412
It's not that I wouldn't like to.
I think I'd just disappoint you.

994
01:31:40,367 --> 01:31:43,912
Benjamin, I've been
with older men.

995
01:31:44,162 --> 01:31:46,781
You go back to New York
in the morning,

996
01:31:46,982 --> 01:31:49,382
you should be with your friends.

997
01:31:49,582 --> 01:31:52,116
You're only young once.
-Oh, I'm old enough.

998
01:31:52,317 --> 01:31:55,742
Daisy, just not tonight, is all.

999
01:32:08,419 --> 01:32:11,849
We can go hear some music.

1000
01:32:12,802 --> 01:32:16,203
Our lives are defined
by opportunities.

1001
01:32:16,404 --> 01:32:18,944
Even the ones we miss.

1002
01:32:19,186 --> 01:32:22,584
You look so handsome,
so distinct.

1003
01:32:22,785 --> 01:32:25,665
They're sayin' the hurricane is
gonna miss us. Blow right on by.

1004
01:32:25,866 --> 01:32:29,066
-Oh, that's great.
-I'll stay under the blankets...

1005
01:32:29,339 --> 01:32:32,339
with mother.
She said nothing...

1006
01:32:32,784 --> 01:32:34,654
Benjamin?

1007
01:32:35,793 --> 01:32:38,468
Things were becoming
different for me.

1008
01:32:38,669 --> 01:32:41,907
My hair had very little gray
and grew like weeds.

1009
01:32:42,108 --> 01:32:45,723
My sense of smell was keener,
my hearing more acute.

1010
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:48,921
I could walk further and faster.

1011
01:32:49,122 --> 01:32:54,352
While everybody else was aging,
I was getting younger. All alone.

1012
01:32:57,355 --> 01:32:59,351
Come in.

1013
01:32:59,966 --> 01:33:01,789
Benjamin!

1014
01:33:02,383 --> 01:33:05,805
Do you remember me?
-Sure I do, Mr Button.

1015
01:33:06,106 --> 01:33:10,121
What happened to you?
-Darn foot got infected.

1016
01:33:11,322 --> 01:33:14,212
Welcome home, my friend.

1017
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:18,231
I see you're still drinking
your Sazerac with whiskey.

1018
01:33:18,432 --> 01:33:20,232
I'm a creature of habit.

1019
01:33:20,432 --> 01:33:22,469
Still visiting the house
on Bourbon Street?

1020
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:24,870
Not for a long time.

1021
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:27,664
Interesting times, though.

1022
01:33:27,865 --> 01:33:32,130
We went from making 40 thousand
to nearly a million buttons a day.

1023
01:33:32,331 --> 01:33:34,731
We employed ten times
the number of people.

1024
01:33:34,932 --> 01:33:37,332
We were operating
around the clock.

1025
01:33:41,397 --> 01:33:43,491
Damn shame.

1026
01:33:43,853 --> 01:33:47,443
The war has been kind
to the button industry.

1027
01:33:49,526 --> 01:33:51,533
You know...

1028
01:33:53,055 --> 01:33:56,723
I'm sick. I don't know
how much longer I have.

1029
01:33:56,924 --> 01:34:00,576
I'm sorry to hear that,
Mr Button. -No...

1030
01:34:00,777 --> 01:34:04,837
I don't have any people.
I keep to myself.

1031
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:08,647
I hope you don't mind, but...

1032
01:34:08,848 --> 01:34:11,448
whenever possible,
I'd enjoy your company.

1033
01:34:11,648 --> 01:34:14,473
I'll certainly do what I can.

1034
01:34:17,522 --> 01:34:21,587
Benjamin, do you know
anything about buttons?

1035
01:34:24,023 --> 01:34:28,696
Button's Buttons has been
in our family for 124 years.

1036
01:34:29,197 --> 01:34:33,640
My grandfather was a tailor.
He had a small shop in Richmond.

1037
01:34:33,841 --> 01:34:37,017
After the Civil War,
He moved to New Orleans

1038
01:34:37,218 --> 01:34:41,457
where my father had the wisdom
to make our own buttons.

1039
01:34:41,658 --> 01:34:46,669
So, with his help,
the tailor shop grew to this.

1040
01:34:47,238 --> 01:34:50,633
And today, I can't sew a stitch.

1041
01:34:54,109 --> 01:34:57,094
That's very, very interesting.

1042
01:34:59,936 --> 01:35:03,481
You sure have done
well for yourself.

1043
01:35:03,861 --> 01:35:08,095
So... what can I do
for you, Mr Button?

1044
01:35:09,897 --> 01:35:13,563
Benjamin, you are my son.

1045
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:24,477
I'm so sorry I've never
told you before.

1046
01:35:25,378 --> 01:35:29,293
You were born the night
the Great war ended.

1047
01:35:30,671 --> 01:35:34,386
Your mother died
giving birth to you.

1048
01:35:35,649 --> 01:35:38,654
I thought you were a monster.

1049
01:35:41,472 --> 01:35:46,312
I promised your mother
I'd make sure you were safe.

1050
01:35:51,353 --> 01:35:54,608
I should never have
abandoned you.

1051
01:35:57,683 --> 01:35:59,691
My mother?

1052
01:36:00,476 --> 01:36:03,502
This is our summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1053
01:36:03,703 --> 01:36:07,220
When I was a boy I loved to
wake up before anyone else,

1054
01:36:07,421 --> 01:36:11,226
run down to the lake
and watch the day begin.

1055
01:36:11,727 --> 01:36:15,332
It was as if I was
the only one alive.

1056
01:36:16,133 --> 01:36:19,288
I fell in love the
first time I saw her.

1057
01:36:19,489 --> 01:36:22,740
Your mother's name was
Caroline Murphy.

1058
01:36:22,941 --> 01:36:26,766
She worked in your
grandfather's kitchen.

1059
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:31,098
She was from Dublin.

1060
01:36:31,293 --> 01:36:34,901
In 1903, Caroline and all
her brothers and sisters

1061
01:36:35,102 --> 01:36:38,467
came to live here,
in New Orleans.

1062
01:36:39,463 --> 01:36:43,063
I'd find excuses to go
down to that kitchen,

1063
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:46,264
just so I could look at her.

1064
01:36:51,704 --> 01:36:55,935
April 25th 1918, the
happiest day of my life.

1065
01:36:56,136 --> 01:36:59,136
The day I married your mother.

1066
01:36:59,999 --> 01:37:02,899
Why didn't you just tell me?

1067
01:37:03,208 --> 01:37:07,231
I plan on leaving
everything I have to you.

1068
01:37:07,432 --> 01:37:09,489
I have to go.

1069
01:37:09,706 --> 01:37:12,700
-Where?
-Home.

1070
01:37:13,228 --> 01:37:15,569
What is he thinking?
He think he can just show up

1071
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:18,031
and everything's supposed
to be fine and dandy.

1072
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:20,363
Everybody's supposed
to be friends.

1073
01:37:20,564 --> 01:37:23,364
He got another thing coming,
that's for sure.

1074
01:37:23,565 --> 01:37:26,465
God be my witness,
he got another thing coming!

1075
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:29,994
He left us 18 dollars
that night you was found.

1076
01:37:30,195 --> 01:37:33,366
18 ratty dollars
and a filthy diaper!

1077
01:37:33,567 --> 01:37:37,192
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, baby.

1078
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:54,670
Did I ever tell you, I was
struck by lightning 7 times?

1079
01:37:55,845 --> 01:37:59,260
Once I was walking
the dog down the road.

1080
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:06,998
I'm blind in the one eye,
can't hardly hear.

1081
01:38:07,999 --> 01:38:10,899
I get twitches and shakes
out of nowhere,

1082
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:14,000
I always lose my line of thought.

1083
01:38:14,251 --> 01:38:16,611
But you know what?

1084
01:38:16,866 --> 01:38:20,666
God keeps reminding me
I'm lucky to be alive.

1085
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:27,699
Storm's comin'.

1086
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:15,937
Wake up.

1087
01:39:17,969 --> 01:39:20,819
Let's get you dressed.

1088
01:40:53,639 --> 01:40:57,506
You could be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1089
01:40:57,707 --> 01:41:01,316
You can swear and
curse the fates...

1090
01:41:01,617 --> 01:41:04,709
but when it comes to the end...

1091
01:41:05,010 --> 01:41:07,605
you have to let go.

1092
01:41:29,084 --> 01:41:32,263
That sure is a beautiful service.

1093
01:41:33,288 --> 01:41:36,928
He'll be burried right
next to your mother.

1094
01:41:37,515 --> 01:41:40,515
You're my mother.

1095
01:41:42,916 --> 01:41:45,116
My baby.

1096
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:52,118
I've never seen New York.

1097
01:43:19,396 --> 01:43:23,281
Excuse me, I'm a friend of
Daisy's. -Right this way.

1098
01:43:26,256 --> 01:43:28,267
Daisy!

1099
01:43:28,668 --> 01:43:30,968
Yes! I'm in the wardrobe!

1100
01:43:31,128 --> 01:43:33,898
Is somebody looking for me?

1101
01:43:35,237 --> 01:43:37,797
Benjamin! -Hi.

1102
01:43:38,718 --> 01:43:42,537
-What are you doing here?
-I thought I'd come visit.

1103
01:43:42,738 --> 01:43:46,098
Spend some time
with you if I could.

1104
01:43:47,774 --> 01:43:52,174
I wish you would have called.
You took me by surprise.

1105
01:43:53,404 --> 01:43:57,835
-Are you still mad?
-No. Thank you, they're lovely.

1106
01:43:58,136 --> 01:44:01,156
I couldn't take
my eyes off of you.

1107
01:44:01,357 --> 01:44:04,357
I thought you were mesmerizing.

1108
01:44:04,945 --> 01:44:08,502
Thank you. That's very
kind of you to say.

1109
01:44:12,925 --> 01:44:15,170
I better get changed. A group
of us are going to a party.

1110
01:44:15,371 --> 01:44:17,236
Would you wanna come?

1111
01:44:17,437 --> 01:44:19,947
Somebody told me about a restaurant
I thought you might enjoy.

1112
01:44:20,148 --> 01:44:22,569
I made a reservation.
Just in case.

1113
01:44:22,770 --> 01:44:25,976
It's just that all the dancers
go out after the show.

1114
01:44:26,177 --> 01:44:30,188
You're welcome to come with us.
I'll get changed, alright?

1115
01:44:50,266 --> 01:44:53,944
This is David.
He dances with the company.

1116
01:44:54,145 --> 01:44:57,376
This is Benjamin.
I told you about him.

1117
01:44:57,580 --> 01:44:59,830
Oh yeah... how are you doing?

1118
01:45:00,031 --> 01:45:03,011
I'll go get you a drink.

1119
01:45:10,655 --> 01:45:14,055
So, you were a friend
of her grandmother's?

1120
01:45:14,256 --> 01:45:16,856
Or something like that?

1121
01:45:17,206 --> 01:45:20,406
-Something like that.
-Excuse me.

1122
01:46:05,709 --> 01:46:07,309
Hey!

1123
01:46:07,510 --> 01:46:10,540
I had no idea you were coming!

1124
01:46:11,029 --> 01:46:13,432
Lord, Benjamin...

1125
01:46:15,214 --> 01:46:17,423
What did you expect?

1126
01:46:17,624 --> 01:46:21,514
What, you want me to drop
everything? This is my life.

1127
01:46:21,715 --> 01:46:24,482
Hey, going downtown?

1128
01:46:28,657 --> 01:46:30,516
Come on.

1129
01:46:30,725 --> 01:46:34,568
Have a good time. There'll be
musicians, interesting people...

1130
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:38,180
You don't have to do that.
It's my fault.

1131
01:46:38,381 --> 01:46:41,181
I should've called.
I thought...

1132
01:46:41,382 --> 01:46:45,857
I'll come here and sweep you
off your feet, or something.

1133
01:46:47,112 --> 01:46:51,270
-Daisy, come on!
-I'll be right there.

1134
01:46:53,468 --> 01:46:57,310
He seems nice.
Do you love him?

1135
01:47:00,706 --> 01:47:02,978
I think so.

1136
01:47:04,096 --> 01:47:06,701
I'm happy for you.

1137
01:47:07,905 --> 01:47:10,900
Maybe I'll see you at home.

1138
01:47:12,530 --> 01:47:14,372
Okay.

1139
01:47:15,787 --> 01:47:18,452
I enjoyed the show!

1140
01:47:25,198 --> 01:47:29,798
He came to tell me
his father had died.

1141
01:47:30,965 --> 01:47:33,355
You couldn't have known.

1142
01:47:33,556 --> 01:47:37,405
I was 23. I just didn't care.

1143
01:47:39,901 --> 01:47:44,724
What did you do next?
-Some photographs, I think.

1144
01:47:45,025 --> 01:47:48,085
Front of my bag.

1145
01:47:50,453 --> 01:47:54,681
I was as good a dancer
as I was ever gonna be.

1146
01:47:56,158 --> 01:47:59,056
For five years...

1147
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:03,663
I danced everywhere.

1148
01:48:04,298 --> 01:48:07,899
London, Vienna, Prague...

1149
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:11,140
I've never seen these.

1150
01:48:13,605 --> 01:48:18,083
Mom, you never talked
about your dancing.

1151
01:48:18,735 --> 01:48:22,535
I was the only American
to be invited

1152
01:48:22,736 --> 01:48:25,736
to dance with the Bolshoi.

1153
01:48:27,571 --> 01:48:30,360
It was glorious.

1154
01:48:34,222 --> 01:48:38,640
But Benjamin was never
far from my thoughts.

1155
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,388
And I'd find myself saying:

1156
01:48:44,857 --> 01:48:47,643
Goodnight, Benjamin.

1157
01:48:48,473 --> 01:48:52,528
-"Goodnight, Daisy."
-He said that?

1158
01:48:54,331 --> 01:48:57,122
Life wasn't all that complicated.

1159
01:48:57,323 --> 01:49:01,723
If you want, you might say
I was looking for something.

1160
01:49:08,591 --> 01:49:12,271
Benjamin, mrs La Tourneau
just passed.

1161
01:49:18,961 --> 01:49:22,606
Mr Benjamin Button?
-That would be me.

1162
01:49:49,869 --> 01:49:52,088
Bonjour.
-Oui, monsieur?

1163
01:49:52,289 --> 01:49:54,854
Miss Daisy Fuller.
-Just a minute.

1164
01:49:55,055 --> 01:49:58,065
Please, have a seat.
-Sure.

1165
01:50:04,499 --> 01:50:09,258
Sometimes we are on a collision
course and we just don't know it.

1166
01:50:09,459 --> 01:50:12,459
Whether it's by accident
or by design,

1167
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:15,660
there's not a thing
we can do about it.

1168
01:50:16,718 --> 01:50:20,538
A woman in Paris was on
her way to go shopping.

1169
01:50:21,094 --> 01:50:24,912
But she had forgotten her coat,
and went back to get it.

1170
01:50:25,113 --> 01:50:28,000
When she had gotten her
coat the phone had rung,

1171
01:50:28,201 --> 01:50:31,857
so she had stopped to answer it
and talked for a couple of minutes.

1172
01:50:32,058 --> 01:50:34,058
While the woman was
on the phone,

1173
01:50:34,259 --> 01:50:37,759
Daisy was rehearsing for performance
at the Paris Opera House.

1174
01:50:37,932 --> 01:50:40,964
And while she was rehearsing,
the woman, off the phone now,

1175
01:50:41,165 --> 01:50:43,970
had gone outside to get a taxi.

1176
01:50:47,709 --> 01:50:50,561
Now a taxi driver had
dropped off a fare earlier,

1177
01:50:50,762 --> 01:50:53,773
and had stopped to
get a cup of coffee.

1178
01:50:53,974 --> 01:50:57,469
And all the while
Daisy was rehearsing.

1179
01:50:59,818 --> 01:51:02,271
And this cab driver who had
dropped off the earlier fare,

1180
01:51:02,472 --> 01:51:04,519
and had stopped to
get the cup of coffee,

1181
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,920
had picked up the lady
who was going shopping,

1182
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:09,855
who had missed
getting the earlier cab.

1183
01:51:10,075 --> 01:51:12,509
Taxi had to stop for a man
crossing the street,

1184
01:51:12,710 --> 01:51:15,529
who had left for work 5 minutes
later than he normally did,

1185
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:18,581
because he forgot
to set his alarm.

1186
01:51:18,782 --> 01:51:22,044
While the man, late for work,
was crossing the street,

1187
01:51:22,245 --> 01:51:25,845
Daisy had finished rehearsing
and was taking a shower.

1188
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:28,932
While Daisy was showering, taxi
was waiting outside a Boutique

1189
01:51:29,133 --> 01:51:32,452
for the woman to pick up a package
which hadn't been wrapped yet

1190
01:51:32,629 --> 01:51:35,229
because the girl who
was supposed to wrap it

1191
01:51:35,429 --> 01:51:38,735
had broken up with her boyfriend
the night before, and forgot.

1192
01:51:38,936 --> 01:51:41,773
When the package was wrapped,
the woman, who was back in the cab,

1193
01:51:41,974 --> 01:51:44,011
was blocked by a delivery truck.

1194
01:51:44,212 --> 01:51:47,052
All the while Daisy
was getting dressed.

1195
01:51:47,885 --> 01:51:51,125
The delivery truck pulled away
and the taxi was able to move.

1196
01:51:51,326 --> 01:51:53,775
While Daisy,
the last to be dressed,

1197
01:51:53,976 --> 01:51:57,420
waited for one of her friends
who had broken a shoelace.

1198
01:51:57,621 --> 01:52:00,648
While the taxi was stopped,
waiting for a traffic light,

1199
01:52:00,849 --> 01:52:04,545
Daisy and her friend came out
the back of the theater.

1200
01:52:04,746 --> 01:52:07,866
And if only one thing
had happened differently,

1201
01:52:08,067 --> 01:52:10,126
if that shoelace hadn't broken,

1202
01:52:10,327 --> 01:52:12,690
or that delivery truck had
moved moments earlier,

1203
01:52:12,891 --> 01:52:15,085
or that package had been
wrapped and ready,

1204
01:52:15,286 --> 01:52:17,776
because the girl hadn't
broken up with her boyfriend,

1205
01:52:17,977 --> 01:52:20,984
or that man had set his alarm
and got up five minutes earlier,

1206
01:52:21,452 --> 01:52:24,468
or that taxi driver hadn't
stopped for a cup of coffee,

1207
01:52:24,669 --> 01:52:26,709
or that woman had
remembered her coat

1208
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:28,910
and had gotten
into an earlier cab,

1209
01:52:29,210 --> 01:52:32,210
Daisy and her friend would
have crossed the street.

1210
01:52:32,411 --> 01:52:35,211
And the taxi would
have driven by.

1211
01:52:45,453 --> 01:52:47,692
But life being what it is,

1212
01:52:47,893 --> 01:52:50,806
a series of intersecting
lives and incidents,

1213
01:52:51,007 --> 01:52:53,013
out of anyone's control,

1214
01:52:53,214 --> 01:52:55,614
that taxi did not go by,

1215
01:52:55,914 --> 01:52:59,538
and that driver was
momentarily distracted.

1216
01:53:01,156 --> 01:53:04,813
And that taxi hit Daisy.
-Daisy! Help!

1217
01:53:07,235 --> 01:53:10,220
And her leg was crushed.

1218
01:53:16,590 --> 01:53:18,449
Daisy...

1219
01:53:22,186 --> 01:53:25,609
-Who told you?
-Your friend wired me.

1220
01:53:25,810 --> 01:53:30,810
Very kind of you to come all this
way to see that I was alright.

1221
01:53:31,377 --> 01:53:34,142
You'd do the same for me.

1222
01:53:35,158 --> 01:53:37,154
My God!

1223
01:53:38,632 --> 01:53:42,495
Look at you.
You're perfect.

1224
01:53:44,904 --> 01:53:47,554
I wish you hadn't come.

1225
01:53:48,252 --> 01:53:51,682
I don't want you
to see me like this.

1226
01:53:55,831 --> 01:53:58,647
Her leg had been
broken in five places.

1227
01:53:58,848 --> 01:54:02,692
And with therapy, and time,
she might walk again.

1228
01:54:02,893 --> 01:54:05,713
But she'll never dance.

1229
01:54:06,483 --> 01:54:09,803
I'm gonna take you home with
me. I wanna look after you.

1230
01:54:10,004 --> 01:54:12,231
I'm not going back
to New Orleans.

1231
01:54:12,432 --> 01:54:14,740
Then I'll stay here in Paris.

1232
01:54:14,941 --> 01:54:18,487
Don't you understand?
I don't want your help.

1233
01:54:18,688 --> 01:54:20,975
I know I'm feeling
sorry for myself,

1234
01:54:21,176 --> 01:54:23,376
but I don't want to be with you.

1235
01:54:23,576 --> 01:54:27,798
I tried to tell you that in
New York, but you don't listen.

1236
01:54:28,299 --> 01:54:30,499
You might change your mind.

1237
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:34,300
We are not little children
anymore, Benjamin.

1238
01:54:37,153 --> 01:54:39,908
Stay out of my life.

1239
01:55:01,704 --> 01:55:04,704
I was awfully cruel.

1240
01:55:05,805 --> 01:55:08,805
He didn't understand that...

1241
01:55:09,006 --> 01:55:12,406
I couldn't have him
see me like that.

1242
01:55:14,117 --> 01:55:17,132
I didn't leave right away.

1243
01:55:17,891 --> 01:55:22,176
I stayed in Paris for awhile
to look out for her.

1244
01:55:24,957 --> 01:55:27,817
I never knew that.

1245
01:55:30,421 --> 01:55:34,459
Darling, could you
get the nurse?

1246
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:43,999
I taught myself to walk again.

1247
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:49,488
I took the train to Lourdes.

1248
01:55:50,297 --> 01:55:54,027
Lets take a look.
That's normal.

1249
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:57,664
Pulse rate is slowing. She is
gonna struggle to breathe.

1250
01:55:57,865 --> 01:56:00,595
Will you be alright?
-Yeah.

1251
01:56:13,025 --> 01:56:16,046
Alright, he says:
"I went back home..."

1252
01:56:16,247 --> 01:56:19,447
And then there's
lot of pages torn out.

1253
01:56:19,647 --> 01:56:23,647
"I listened to the sound of the
house." I think I've read that.

1254
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,927
He spilled something on it,
so it's hard to read, mom.

1255
01:56:30,128 --> 01:56:33,334
Something about "sailing".
Does that make sense?

1256
01:56:33,535 --> 01:56:39,135
I learned to sail on an old boat of
my father's from the Lake House.

1257
01:56:46,601 --> 01:56:51,481
I can't lie, I did enjoy the
company of a woman or two.

1258
01:56:59,618 --> 01:57:02,488
Or maybe three.

1259
01:57:37,718 --> 01:57:42,518
Don't bother, Sam. It's just
gonna be there again tomorrow.

1260
01:57:46,194 --> 01:57:48,048
Mama.

1261
01:57:52,384 --> 01:57:55,394
And in the spring of 1962,

1262
01:57:58,724 --> 01:58:01,287
she came back.

1263
01:58:19,577 --> 01:58:23,407
You wanna know
where I've been? -No.

1264
01:58:25,177 --> 01:58:27,979
How come you didn't
write or nothin'?

1265
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:30,180
Just disappearing like that.

1266
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:33,180
It was something I needed
to do for myself.

1267
01:58:33,381 --> 01:58:36,581
I never took you to
be the selfish type.

1268
01:58:36,727 --> 01:58:39,752
I sure hope I'm not wrong.

1269
01:58:40,367 --> 01:58:42,847
I'm usually not wrong
about people.

1270
01:58:43,048 --> 01:58:45,850
-Good night, Momma.
-Good night, baby.

1271
01:58:46,051 --> 01:58:48,231
Now have fun.

1272
01:58:50,345 --> 01:58:55,145
You haven't said two words.
-I don't wanna ruin it.

1273
01:59:24,961 --> 01:59:28,156
Sleep with me. -Absolutely.

1274
02:00:05,016 --> 02:00:08,376
I asked her to come
away with me.

1275
02:00:09,572 --> 02:00:14,017
We sailed into the Gulf,
along the Florida Keys.

1276
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:58,487
I'm so glad we didn't find
one another when I was 26.

1277
02:00:58,688 --> 02:01:02,550
-Why do you say that?
-I was so young.

1278
02:01:02,830 --> 02:01:05,211
And you were so old.

1279
02:01:05,492 --> 02:01:08,330
It happened when it was
supposed to happen.

1280
02:01:08,531 --> 02:01:12,596
I will enjoy each and every
moment I have with you.

1281
02:01:16,972 --> 02:01:21,844
I bet I can stay out here longer
than you. -Bet you can't.

1282
02:01:24,003 --> 02:01:26,819
You barely have
a line, a crease.

1283
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:30,620
Every day I have
more wrinkles. Not fair.

1284
02:01:31,638 --> 02:01:35,663
I love your wrinkles.
Both of them.

1285
02:01:40,936 --> 02:01:44,566
What's it like,
growing younger?

1286
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:50,577
Can't really say. I'm always
looking out of my own eyes.

1287
02:01:55,409 --> 02:01:59,274
Will you still love me when
my skin grows old and saggy?

1288
02:01:59,475 --> 02:02:02,703
Will you still love me
when I have acne?

1289
02:02:02,904 --> 02:02:05,104
When I wet the bed?

1290
02:02:05,267 --> 02:02:09,307
When I'm afraid of
what's under the stairs?

1291
02:02:15,308 --> 02:02:16,908
What?

1292
02:02:22,449 --> 02:02:26,644
What are you thinking?
-I was thinking how nothing lasts.

1293
02:02:28,775 --> 02:02:31,965
And what a shame that is.

1294
02:02:33,831 --> 02:02:36,346
Some things last.

1295
02:02:37,977 --> 02:02:42,457
-Goodnight, Daisy.
-Goodnight, Benjamin.

1296
02:02:58,372 --> 02:03:00,050
Mom?

1297
02:03:01,695 --> 02:03:06,310
When did you meet dad?
-Some time after that.

1298
02:03:08,956 --> 02:03:11,626
Did you tell him
about this Benjamin?

1299
02:03:11,827 --> 02:03:14,627
He knew enough, darling.

1300
02:03:33,692 --> 02:03:35,337
Momma!

1301
02:03:41,924 --> 02:03:43,573
Queenie!

1302
02:03:46,389 --> 02:03:48,020
Hallo?

1303
02:03:48,406 --> 02:03:52,177
Hi, Mrs Carter. It's Benjamin.
Where is everybody?

1304
02:03:52,378 --> 02:03:55,456
Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died.

1305
02:03:55,926 --> 02:03:58,324
I'm so sorry.

1306
02:04:25,856 --> 02:04:29,821
So sorry for your loss.
She was a great woman.

1307
02:04:36,254 --> 02:04:40,494
We buried her beside
her beloved Mr Weathers.

1308
02:04:46,243 --> 02:04:49,457
And so we might have
memories of our own,

1309
02:04:49,658 --> 02:04:52,258
we sold my father's
house on Esplanade.

1310
02:04:52,458 --> 02:04:55,063
It's a wonderful
old place, darlin'.

1311
02:04:55,241 --> 02:04:58,306
I think we're going
to be so happy here.

1312
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:01,184
Oh, what a long family
history you have.

1313
02:05:01,385 --> 02:05:04,185
They come with the house.

1314
02:05:06,735 --> 02:05:09,775
We have to see the master suite.

1315
02:05:10,210 --> 02:05:13,130
We bought ourselves a duplex.

1316
02:05:14,439 --> 02:05:17,109
I loved that house.

1317
02:05:18,818 --> 02:05:21,777
It smelled like firewood.

1318
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:25,213
Don't stop, darlin'.

1319
02:05:25,847 --> 02:05:28,710
It was one of the happiest
times of my life.

1320
02:05:28,911 --> 02:05:31,717
We didn't have
a stick of furniture.

1321
02:05:32,053 --> 02:05:35,633
We would have picnics
in the living room.

1322
02:05:38,129 --> 02:05:40,594
We ate when we felt like it.

1323
02:05:40,795 --> 02:05:43,295
Stayed up all night
when we wanted.

1324
02:05:43,495 --> 02:05:45,915
We vowed never
to fall into routine,

1325
02:05:46,116 --> 02:05:48,677
to go to bed or wake up
at the same time.

1326
02:05:48,878 --> 02:05:51,738
We lived on that mattress.

1327
02:06:26,599 --> 02:06:30,667
Our neighbor, Mrs Van Dam,
was a physical therapist.

1328
02:06:31,468 --> 02:06:35,518
We lived four blocks
from a public pool.

1329
02:07:12,811 --> 02:07:16,249
You might have got a few
more years out of it.

1330
02:07:16,450 --> 02:07:20,662
You chose to do something
so special, unique,

1331
02:07:21,163 --> 02:07:26,249
that there was only a short
window of time you could do it.

1332
02:07:26,750 --> 02:07:29,487
So even if nothing ever happened,

1333
02:07:29,688 --> 02:07:32,693
you'd still be right here
where you're now.

1334
02:07:32,894 --> 02:07:35,799
I just don't like getting old.

1335
02:07:36,354 --> 02:07:40,004
They put too much
chlorine in here.

1336
02:08:20,065 --> 02:08:25,035
I promise you, I'll never lose
myself to self-pity again.

1337
02:08:28,292 --> 02:08:33,115
And I think right there
and then, she realised...

1338
02:08:33,616 --> 02:08:36,696
None of us is perfect forever.

1339
02:08:39,324 --> 02:08:42,238
She found her own peace.

1340
02:08:42,961 --> 02:08:47,246
She opened a studio and taught
young girls how to dance.

1341
02:08:47,947 --> 02:08:51,266
Come back the other way.

1342
02:08:53,325 --> 02:08:55,214
Excellent!

1343
02:08:56,995 --> 02:08:59,013
Good night!

1344
02:09:23,721 --> 02:09:27,016
You certainly are
beautiful to watch.

1345
02:09:28,251 --> 02:09:31,316
Dance is all about the line.

1346
02:09:32,865 --> 02:09:35,438
Line of your body.

1347
02:09:36,206 --> 02:09:41,227
Sooner or later you lose that line,
and you never get it back.

1348
02:09:46,444 --> 02:09:48,248
I figure...

1349
02:09:48,449 --> 02:09:52,244
You were born in 1918,
49 years ago.

1350
02:09:52,647 --> 02:09:54,847
I am 43.

1351
02:09:56,048 --> 02:09:59,048
We are almost the same age.

1352
02:10:01,545 --> 02:10:04,315
We're meeting in the middle.

1353
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:07,916
We finally caught up
with each other.

1354
02:10:08,116 --> 02:10:12,936
Wait. I want to remember
us just as we are now.

1355
02:10:23,334 --> 02:10:26,193
I am pregnant.

1356
02:10:42,546 --> 02:10:47,541
You know, I swear the nurse
slipped and said it was a boy.

1357
02:11:01,202 --> 02:11:04,082
But I think it's a girl.

1358
02:11:08,472 --> 02:11:10,832
I know you're afraid.

1359
02:11:11,075 --> 02:11:13,920
I'm not hiding it. -Okay.

1360
02:11:20,265 --> 02:11:23,493
-What's your worst fear?
-Baby born like me.

1361
02:11:23,694 --> 02:11:26,542
Then I will love it
all the more.

1362
02:11:27,537 --> 02:11:29,107
Okay.

1363
02:11:29,308 --> 02:11:33,308
How can I be a father when
I'm heading the other direction?

1364
02:11:33,508 --> 02:11:37,344
It's not fair to a child. I don't
wanna be anybody's burden.

1365
02:11:37,545 --> 02:11:40,585
Sugar, we all end up in diapers.

1366
02:11:41,029 --> 02:11:43,974
I'm gonna make this work.

1367
02:11:45,699 --> 02:11:48,792
I want this,
and I want it with you.

1368
02:11:48,993 --> 02:11:52,229
I want you to have
everything you want, all of it.

1369
02:11:52,330 --> 02:11:55,440
I'm just not sure
how to reconcile this...

1370
02:11:55,641 --> 02:11:58,917
Would you tell a blind man
he couldn't have children?

1371
02:11:59,151 --> 02:12:02,551
You be a father
for as long as you can.

1372
02:12:02,752 --> 02:12:05,752
I know the consequences.
I've accepted that.

1373
02:12:05,930 --> 02:12:09,760
Loving you was worth
everything to me.

1374
02:12:12,910 --> 02:12:15,565
I have to go pee.

1375
02:12:28,737 --> 02:12:31,167
<i>The oldest woman to ever
swim the English Channel</i>

1376
02:12:31,268 --> 02:12:32,973
<i>arrived here today, in Calais,</i>

1377
02:12:33,074 --> 02:12:34,687
Keep it!

1378
02:12:34,788 --> 02:12:38,267
<i>having made the swim in 34 hours,
22 minutes and 14 seconds.</i>

1379
02:12:38,368 --> 02:12:42,097
<i>68 years old Elizabeth Abbott,
arrived at 5:38 GMT,</i>

1380
02:12:42,298 --> 02:12:44,429
<i>exhausted but happy.</i>

1381
02:12:44,630 --> 02:12:48,088
<i>Mrs Abbott, how would you sum
up in words this achievement?</i>

1382
02:12:48,289 --> 02:12:52,950
<i>I suppose...
anything is possible.</i>

1383
02:12:58,198 --> 02:13:00,337
Are you ready?

1384
02:13:00,975 --> 02:13:02,602
Yeah.

1385
02:13:10,674 --> 02:13:14,896
In the spring,
on a day like any other...

1386
02:13:15,299 --> 02:13:18,034
I'll be back in an hour!

1387
02:13:22,058 --> 02:13:23,945
Honey!

1388
02:13:25,428 --> 02:13:27,938
Gotta call the ambulance!

1389
02:13:30,484 --> 02:13:32,751
The baby is coming.

1390
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:35,790
Operator, I need an ambulance!

1391
02:14:17,394 --> 02:14:21,859
Everyone's fine. She's a
perfectly healthy baby girl.

1392
02:14:27,598 --> 02:14:29,417
Honey...

1393
02:14:30,955 --> 02:14:35,200
She gave birth to a five pound
four ounce baby girl.

1394
02:14:50,856 --> 02:14:53,596
Did you count the toes?

1395
02:14:56,809 --> 02:14:59,027
She's perfect.

1396
02:14:59,279 --> 02:15:03,299
"And we named her for
my mother, Caroline."

1397
02:15:05,813 --> 02:15:08,813
This Benjamin was my father?

1398
02:15:09,414 --> 02:15:12,414
And this is how you tell me?

1399
02:15:17,175 --> 02:15:19,304
Excuse me.

1400
02:15:29,380 --> 02:15:32,502
<i>...all the conditions are there
for the major storm,</i>

1401
02:15:32,703 --> 02:15:35,698
<i>possibly even up
to a cathegory 5.</i>

1402
02:15:41,190 --> 02:15:45,613
Hey, I know it's hard.
You can't smoke in here.

1403
02:15:48,045 --> 02:15:52,100
<i>Nobody can tell you exactly
where it's gonna hit...</i>

1404
02:16:02,991 --> 02:16:08,406
You grew as the doctor had
promised, normal and healthy.

1405
02:16:16,695 --> 02:16:20,580
You're gonna have to find
a real father for her.

1406
02:16:22,518 --> 02:16:24,583
What are you talking about?

1407
02:16:24,784 --> 02:16:28,038
She's gonna need someone
to grow old with.

1408
02:16:28,239 --> 02:16:31,221
She'll learn to accept whatever
happens. She loves you.

1409
02:16:31,465 --> 02:16:34,715
Honey, she needs a father,
not a playmate.

1410
02:16:37,575 --> 02:16:39,674
Is it me? -Of course not.

1411
02:16:39,875 --> 02:16:43,519
Is my age beginning to bother you?
Is that what you're telling me?

1412
02:16:43,732 --> 02:16:46,777
You can't raise both of us.

1413
02:16:54,129 --> 02:16:56,959
It was your first birthday.

1414
02:16:57,194 --> 02:17:01,415
We had a party for you. The
house was filled with children.

1415
02:17:01,616 --> 02:17:03,655
-How are you?
-Hey, man.

1416
02:17:03,856 --> 02:17:08,431
Before you turn around,
they'll be in high school, dating.

1417
02:17:39,692 --> 02:17:43,548
I sold the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1418
02:17:43,749 --> 02:17:46,293
I sold Button's Buttons.

1419
02:17:46,494 --> 02:17:49,094
I sold my father's sailboat.

1420
02:17:49,295 --> 02:17:52,495
I put it all into
a savings account.

1421
02:17:53,460 --> 02:17:57,860
And so that you and your
mother might have a life,

1422
02:17:58,061 --> 02:18:02,261
I left, before you could
ever remember me.

1423
02:18:51,562 --> 02:18:54,857
"I left with just the clothes
on my back."

1424
02:18:55,058 --> 02:18:57,780
I don't want to read this now.

1425
02:18:57,981 --> 02:19:01,045
Can you just tell me
where he went?

1426
02:19:01,246 --> 02:19:04,117
I don't really know.

1427
02:19:14,728 --> 02:19:18,538
It's for me. 1970. I was two.

1428
02:19:18,830 --> 02:19:21,630
"Happy birthday."

1429
02:19:22,331 --> 02:19:25,931
"I wish I could've
kissed you goodnight."

1430
02:19:30,262 --> 02:19:33,953
They are all for me.
Five:

1431
02:19:34,934 --> 02:19:39,134
"I wish I could've taken you
to your first day of school."

1432
02:19:42,646 --> 02:19:44,507
Six:

1433
02:19:45,349 --> 02:19:49,749
"I wish I could've been there
to teach you to play the piano."

1434
02:19:52,010 --> 02:19:54,897
1981, I was thirteen:

1435
02:19:55,107 --> 02:19:59,299
"I wish I could've told you
not to chase some boy."

1436
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:04,089
"I wish I could've held you
when you had a broken heart."

1437
02:20:04,690 --> 02:20:08,100
"I wish I could've
been your father."

1438
02:20:08,323 --> 02:20:12,018
"Nothing I ever did
will replace that."

1439
02:20:18,112 --> 02:20:20,592
I guess he went to India.

1440
02:20:20,793 --> 02:20:24,000
For what it's worth,
it's never to late,

1441
02:20:24,201 --> 02:20:28,615
or in my case, too early,
to be whoever you want to be.

1442
02:20:32,318 --> 02:20:36,753
There is no time limit,
start whenever you want.

1443
02:20:37,965 --> 02:20:43,565
You can change or stay the same.
There are no rules to this thing.

1444
02:20:45,032 --> 02:20:48,426
We can make the best
or the worst of it.

1445
02:20:48,627 --> 02:20:51,522
I hope you make the best of it.

1446
02:20:54,016 --> 02:20:58,271
And I hope you see
things that startle you.

1447
02:20:58,991 --> 02:21:03,441
I hope you feel things
you never felt before.

1448
02:21:04,961 --> 02:21:09,177
I hope you meet people with
a different point of view.

1449
02:21:09,578 --> 02:21:13,268
I hope you live a life
you're proud of.

1450
02:21:15,133 --> 02:21:18,041
If you find that you're not,

1451
02:21:18,305 --> 02:21:23,375
I hope you have the strenght
to start all over again.

1452
02:21:25,752 --> 02:21:29,062
He had been gone a long time.

1453
02:21:30,591 --> 02:21:33,531
I'll see you next thursday.

1454
02:21:35,697 --> 02:21:39,349
-Good night, miss Daisy.
-Good night, sweetheart.

1455
02:21:56,865 --> 02:21:59,921
I'm sorry, we're closing.

1456
02:22:01,727 --> 02:22:04,302
Can I help you?

1457
02:22:04,948 --> 02:22:08,393
Are you here to
pick somebody up?

1458
02:22:17,758 --> 02:22:20,648
Why did you come back?

1459
02:22:21,029 --> 02:22:22,640
Mom?

1460
02:22:23,421 --> 02:22:25,097
Mom!

1461
02:22:25,761 --> 02:22:28,091
You ready yet?

1462
02:22:30,283 --> 02:22:31,936
Mom, what's wrong?

1463
02:22:32,037 --> 02:22:35,433
I was just hearing a very sad
story about a mutual friend,

1464
02:22:35,534 --> 02:22:38,696
who I hadn't seen
for a very long time.

1465
02:22:38,897 --> 02:22:41,897
Caroline, this is Benjamin.

1466
02:22:42,098 --> 02:22:46,098
You knew him when
you were just a baby.

1467
02:22:46,681 --> 02:22:48,869
Hi. -Hi.

1468
02:22:50,470 --> 02:22:52,070
Hey!

1469
02:22:54,248 --> 02:22:56,813
I'm sorry, I thought
you were done.

1470
02:22:57,014 --> 02:23:00,956
Oh, this is a friend of my
family's, Benjamin Button.

1471
02:23:01,157 --> 02:23:05,326
This is my husband, Robert.
-How do you do.

1472
02:23:05,827 --> 02:23:07,893
Pleasure.

1473
02:23:14,896 --> 02:23:18,882
It was very nice to meet you.
We'll be in the car, darling.

1474
02:23:19,083 --> 02:23:21,178
Alright. -Bye.

1475
02:23:21,899 --> 02:23:24,314
I'm just locking up.

1476
02:23:31,871 --> 02:23:35,461
She's beautiful,
like her mother.

1477
02:23:36,070 --> 02:23:38,713
Does she dance?
-Not very well.

1478
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:41,584
I guess that'd be from
my side of things.

1479
02:23:41,785 --> 02:23:44,185
She's a dear sweet girl.

1480
02:23:44,385 --> 02:23:48,488
She seems a little lost.
But then, who isn't at twelve?

1481
02:23:48,789 --> 02:23:52,839
There's a lot of her
that reminds me of you.

1482
02:23:53,597 --> 02:23:57,451
My husband, he's a widower
... was a widower.

1483
02:23:58,043 --> 02:24:02,278
He's an incredibly kind,
bright, adventurous man.

1484
02:24:05,042 --> 02:24:08,607
He's been a terrific father.
-Good.

1485
02:24:12,481 --> 02:24:16,733
You're so much younger.
-Only on the outside.

1486
02:24:18,495 --> 02:24:20,816
You were right.

1487
02:24:21,826 --> 02:24:25,262
I couldn't have been
raising both of you.

1488
02:24:25,463 --> 02:24:27,923
I'm not that strong.

1489
02:24:31,275 --> 02:24:34,145
So, where are you staying?

1490
02:24:35,484 --> 02:24:37,469
What are you gonna do?

1491
02:24:37,570 --> 02:24:41,227
I'm staying at the Pontchartrain
hotel on the avenue.

1492
02:24:41,428 --> 02:24:44,430
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1493
02:24:52,292 --> 02:24:54,818
They're waiting.

1494
02:25:36,039 --> 02:25:39,668
I remember that.
That was him.

1495
02:25:41,525 --> 02:25:43,976
Hurricane's changed direction.
It's gonna make a landfall

1496
02:25:44,077 --> 02:25:46,077
some time soon. -Am I
supposed to do something?

1497
02:25:46,180 --> 02:25:48,257
Arrangements are being made to
move people, but it's up to you.

1498
02:25:48,397 --> 02:25:50,345
No, no, we're staying.

1499
02:25:50,546 --> 02:25:53,546
I'll let you know
if anything changes.

1500
02:25:55,046 --> 02:25:58,101
That night, while I was
sitting and wandering

1501
02:25:58,302 --> 02:26:02,347
why I came back at all,
there was a knock at the door.

1502
02:26:05,364 --> 02:26:07,447
Come in.

1503
02:26:21,070 --> 02:26:23,827
Are you alright?

1504
02:26:25,817 --> 02:26:30,052
I'm sorry, I don't know
what am I doing here.

1505
02:26:38,864 --> 02:26:41,344
Nothing lasts.

1506
02:26:44,125 --> 02:26:47,185
I never stopped loving you.

1507
02:26:52,488 --> 02:26:55,518
Benjamin, I'm an old woman now.

1508
02:27:05,524 --> 02:27:08,804
Some things you never forget.

1509
02:27:56,352 --> 02:27:58,602
Goodnight, Benjamin.

1510
02:27:59,585 --> 02:28:01,795
Goodnight, Daisy.

1511
02:28:04,590 --> 02:28:07,294
And as I knew I would...

1512
02:28:07,495 --> 02:28:09,945
I watched her go.

1513
02:28:11,473 --> 02:28:14,520
That's the last thing he wrote.

1514
02:28:15,121 --> 02:28:20,020
Some time after
your father passed,

1515
02:28:20,788 --> 02:28:23,648
there was a call.

1516
02:28:25,529 --> 02:28:28,985
Hello? Yes, speaking.

1517
02:28:32,739 --> 02:28:35,804
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1518
02:28:44,740 --> 02:28:47,560
It's the corner house.

1519
02:29:09,051 --> 02:29:11,257
Come on in!

1520
02:29:15,955 --> 02:29:18,085
I'm Daisy Fuller.
-I'm David Hernandez

1521
02:29:18,286 --> 02:29:21,895
with the Orleans Parish dept
of Child Welfare Services.

1522
02:29:22,096 --> 02:29:25,366
He was living in the
condemned building.

1523
02:29:26,281 --> 02:29:29,540
The police found this
with him, this address,

1524
02:29:29,741 --> 02:29:32,516
it's got your name
in here a lot.

1525
02:29:32,853 --> 02:29:35,677
He's in a very poor health.
He was taken to the hospital.

1526
02:29:35,878 --> 02:29:39,754
He doesn't seem to know who or
where he is. He's very confused.

1527
02:29:39,955 --> 02:29:43,592
I was telling Mr Hernandez
that Benjamin is one of us.

1528
02:29:43,793 --> 02:29:47,843
If he needs a place to stay,
it's alright. He can stay here.

1529
02:30:16,546 --> 02:30:18,369
Benjamin.

1530
02:30:21,685 --> 02:30:24,340
You play beautifully.

1531
02:30:27,016 --> 02:30:29,107
He doesn't seem to
like to be touched.

1532
02:30:29,208 --> 02:30:31,256
He goes in and out of
states of recognition.

1533
02:30:31,357 --> 02:30:33,547
The doctors said if they
didn't know any better...

1534
02:30:33,648 --> 02:30:36,248
it is the beginnings
of dementia.

1535
02:30:36,748 --> 02:30:39,534
Do you remember me?

1536
02:30:41,714 --> 02:30:43,944
I'm Daisy.

1537
02:30:45,536 --> 02:30:47,879
I'm Benjamin.

1538
02:30:52,897 --> 02:30:56,021
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

1539
02:30:57,510 --> 02:31:02,790
Do you mind if I sit with you?
I would love to hear you play.

1540
02:31:06,596 --> 02:31:09,166
Do I know you?

1541
02:31:13,472 --> 02:31:19,072
And every day I would stop by
to make sure he was comfortable.

1542
02:31:21,270 --> 02:31:23,926
Don't think that I don't
know what you're doing!

1543
02:31:24,127 --> 02:31:26,482
You're all fucking liars!

1544
02:31:26,803 --> 02:31:30,618
He doesn't believe
he just had his breakfast.

1545
02:31:32,829 --> 02:31:38,220
Why don't we see if we can find
something else for you to do.

1546
02:31:38,421 --> 02:31:41,846
I have a feeling there's a lot
of things I can't remember.

1547
02:31:42,047 --> 02:31:44,517
Like what, sugar?

1548
02:31:45,235 --> 02:31:49,329
It's like...
there's this whole life I had,

1549
02:31:50,130 --> 02:31:53,365
and I can't remember what it was.

1550
02:31:55,512 --> 02:32:00,199
It's okay.
It's okay to forget things.

1551
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:05,889
Many times he would simply
forget who or where he was.

1552
02:32:07,950 --> 02:32:10,564
It wasn't easy.
-Benjamin!

1553
02:32:10,765 --> 02:32:13,226
I can see everything!
I can see the big river!

1554
02:32:13,427 --> 02:32:15,891
That's right. You can see
everything, sweetheart.

1555
02:32:16,092 --> 02:32:19,314
I can see the graveyard where
mama's buried and other people.

1556
02:32:19,515 --> 02:32:23,230
I want you to come down!
-What if I can fly?

1557
02:32:23,431 --> 02:32:26,410
I knew a man who could fly.

1558
02:32:26,611 --> 02:32:30,061
Come down and I'll
tell you all about him.

1559
02:32:32,841 --> 02:32:35,626
Somebody go up there.

1560
02:32:40,996 --> 02:32:44,055
He was five when I moved in.

1561
02:32:44,256 --> 02:32:48,629
Nearly the same age I was
when I had met him.

1562
02:32:54,873 --> 02:33:00,673
This is the picture of Old Man
Kangaroo at 5 in the afternoon,

1563
02:33:01,322 --> 02:33:05,179
when he got his
beautiful hind legs.

1564
02:33:05,980 --> 02:33:11,650
The days passed, and I watched
as he forgot how to walk...

1565
02:33:16,824 --> 02:33:19,619
What's my name?
...how to talk.

1566
02:33:19,919 --> 02:33:22,020
I'm Daisy.

1567
02:33:22,221 --> 02:33:24,737
Can you say Daisy?

1568
02:33:25,758 --> 02:33:31,158
In 2002, they put up a new
clock in that train station.

1569
02:33:37,843 --> 02:33:41,886
And in the spring of 2003,

1570
02:33:45,720 --> 02:33:48,517
he looked at me,

1571
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:54,920
and I knew that
he knew who I was.

1572
02:33:58,750 --> 02:34:04,553
And then he closed his eyes
as if he would go to sleep.

1573
02:34:36,989 --> 02:34:39,584
I wish I had known him.

1574
02:34:39,872 --> 02:34:42,077
Now you do.

1575
02:34:45,551 --> 02:34:49,811
Mom, I think I should go
see what's going on.

1576
02:34:56,527 --> 02:34:59,403
Goodnight, Benjamin.

1577
02:35:28,679 --> 02:35:32,328
Some people are born
to sit by a river.

1578
02:35:32,929 --> 02:35:35,899
Some get struck by lightning.

1579
02:35:36,725 --> 02:35:39,640
Some have an ear for music.

1580
02:35:40,482 --> 02:35:42,873
Some are artists.

1581
02:35:43,541 --> 02:35:45,585
Some swim.

1582
02:35:46,130 --> 02:35:48,783
Some know buttons.

1583
02:35:49,730 --> 02:35:54,193
Some know Shakespeare.
Some are mothers.

1584
02:35:56,063 --> 02:35:59,545
And some people... dance.

1585
02:36:31,946 --> 02:36:34,946
