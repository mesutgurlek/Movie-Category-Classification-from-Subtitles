get his face slapped, too, you know?

ALICE: Can you get him?
DAVID: Yeah.

with his mouth closed.

ALICE: Good night.
DAVID: Good night.

Steve, you better watch it.
You're going to draw back a bloody stub.

I changed the price
on the combination here.

Where is Alice?

She's out there in the john,
trying to get her knees unwelded.

Why don't you lay off her? She's all right.

947
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:01,557
I like her. She doesn't like me.

I'm going to get you--

-I can't get this thing open.
-Okay.

Can't you hear me? Where the hell's Vera?

Come on.

Look, I'm really sorry.
You know, Flo's got personal problems.

It's an accident. It happens.

That's the worst thing
I've ever heard in my life.

970
01:19:37,277 --> 01:19:40,405
You know, you have a worse mouth
than my kid.

971
01:19:41,657 --> 01:19:45,410
-You mean, you like it?
-Like it? I hate it.

972
01:19:47,287 --> 01:19:49,164
Did you make that up?

973
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:52,709
No. I heard it all my life.
I heard it first from my dad.

01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:55,420
-You're kidding me.
-No, he's got some terrific sayings.

975
01:19:55,629 --> 01:19:57,297
He lives out on a farm.

976
01:19:57,506 --> 01:19:59,174
He always says his name's P.P.

977
01:19:59,174 --> 01:20:02,928
He always says,
"Don't call me P.P. 'cause I'm all urine."

978
01:20:03,137 --> 01:20:06,265
FLO: He makes up poems like,
"Alice, Alice, got no malice."

Yeah. Laugh, laugh.

My business is falling apart,
and you're laughing.

985
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:28,370
On the way back to the motel,
I saw the "Waitress Wanted" sign.

986
01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:31,290
I said, "Why not?" So I took this job.

987
01:20:31,707 --> 01:20:33,375
Let me give you a hint.

-Honey, unbutton that top button.
-Really?

If you bend over,
you get more tips when you're working.

-You're kidding me--
-I'm not kidding. I got $50 last week.

01:20:42,551 --> 01:20:44,011
-Really?
-Yeah.

-Like that?
-Yeah.

Honey, forget what I said.

994
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:51,518
You do that,
and I'm never going to get a tip again.

don't you?

You know, I bet you sure get lonesome,
don't you?

Yep. I miss my friend Bea.

1001

What time is it now, about 2:30?

1002
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:23,217
Exactly. How did you know that?

1003

<i>I can feel it.

on the show named Jeff...

1005
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:33,435
and she's just madly in love with him.

1006

You want me to fix you up
with somebody?

1007

I know lots of guys
who'd fall down over you.

1008

Their brains would fall out,
and they'd froth at the mouth.

That sounds attractive.

Thanks a lot, but I don't think so.

on Daddy Duke.

Nothing, except some guitar strings,
but they're real expensive.

-My knee.
-What happened?

There's a slick spot on your floor.

I hope this doesn't ruin
my tryout for cheerleader.

I'm so sorry. Maybe you just stumbled.

-Thank you very much, sir.
-Good luck on your cheerleading.

DAVID: I'd rather take a whipping
than mend fences.

1032
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:23,754
Maybe it would be easier
to get an electric fence.

1033
01:23:25,005 --> 01:23:26,048
Not really.

1034
01:23:26,256 --> 01:23:28,967
They'd be out in about a week, anyway.

1035
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:32,930
They smell the apples over there
and get wilder than a guinea.

1036
01:23:34,598 --> 01:23:36,475
ALICE: What does?
DAVID: The cows.

1037

DAVID: Don't try and understand a cow.
ALICE: Okay.

1038
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:41,897
DAVID: The only thing dumber than a cow
is a chicken.

1039
01:23:41,897 --> 01:23:43,774
Turkeys are worse.

1040
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:47,736
You know what a little turkey does
when it rains?

1041
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:53,158
Put their head back
and open up their mouths and drown.

1042
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:55,661
ALICE: They do not.
DAVID: They do, too.

1043
01:23:56,078 --> 01:24:00,666
My grandmother lost about 200 of them
once in one rainstorm.

1044
01:24:05,879 --> 01:24:08,173
ALICE: Could I touch your beard?

1045
01:24:12,344 --> 01:24:13,804
ALICE: It's soft.

1046
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:42,166
DAVID: Your brother taught you to kiss?
ALICE: I don't mean he demonstrated.

1047
01:24:42,166 --> 01:24:44,459
He told me that
the worst thing that can happen...

1048
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:48,630
is if a boy feels like he's put his lips
in a bowl of wet oatmeal.

1049
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:50,716
At least he said "lips."

1050
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:56,346
So the most important thing
to remember before you kiss...

1051
01:24:56,555 --> 01:24:59,475
is to wipe your mouth real good
and keep your lips together...

1052
01:24:59,475 --> 01:25:01,560
so he doesn't kiss your teeth.

1053
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,688
<i>We went to see
The Postman Always Rings Twice.</i>

1054
01:25:05,522 --> 01:25:09,485
And there was this big close-up of....
What's her name?

1055
01:25:09,485 --> 01:25:12,613
Lana Turner and John Garfield, right?
They're coming together.

1056
01:25:12,613 --> 01:25:15,115
Big dramatic moment.
At last, they're going to kiss.

1057
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:16,992
ALICE: The music's playing. Very dramatic.

1058
01:25:16,992 --> 01:25:20,329
Just as they come together,
they both open their mouths.

1059
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:24,082
I thought, "My God, don't they know
how to kiss? What's wrong with them?"

1060
01:25:24,082 --> 01:25:27,628
I turned and looked at my brother
to see what he was going to say.

1061
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:30,130
ALICE: He didn't move,
he was just looking at screen.

1062
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:32,007
ALICE: He didn't say anything
for three weeks.

1063
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:34,718
Then all of a sudden one day, he says:

1064
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:37,429
"Well, Al, I've been thinking."

1065
01:25:37,638 --> 01:25:40,140
DAVID: Al?
ALICE: Yes, he always called me Al.

1066
01:25:41,183 --> 01:25:45,562
"l think maybe you're supposed to
part your lips a little bit when you kiss."

1067
01:25:45,562 --> 01:25:47,231
God bless him.

1068
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:50,359
If not, I had my work cut out for me.

1069
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:52,236
ALICE: So anyway, and then...

1070
01:25:52,653 --> 01:25:55,781
we decided we wanted to go
into show business from the movies.

1071
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:57,658
Why did you leave?

1072
01:25:58,075 --> 01:26:02,871
I got married, and Donald
wanted to live in his hometown.

1073
01:26:04,122 --> 01:26:05,165
I wanted to go on singing.

1074
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:08,710
He said, "No wife of mine
is going to sing in a saloon."

1075
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:11,839
I said, "Yes, master." I kind of liked that.

1076
01:26:11,839 --> 01:26:15,384
DAVID: You liked it?
ALICE: It was like, you know...

1077
01:26:16,218 --> 01:26:19,138
my idea of a man: strong and dominating.

1078

[Both laughing]

1079
01:26:22,683 --> 01:26:25,185
I'll show you our act.
This is what we used to do.

1080
01:26:25,394 --> 01:26:28,313
I figure, I don't know,
the bubble dancer didn't show up.

1081
01:26:28,313 --> 01:26:30,816
So they called my brother and I.

and I'd be behind him...

in this really nice hotel in Monterey.

I would play the piano and sing.
I really liked it there.

"What do you want me
to do with the gun?" He doesn't tell him.

01:47:34,788 --> 01:47:37,499
I was happy in Monterey, you dummy!

1384
01:47:37,499 --> 01:47:39,585
DAVID: You were a little girl in Monterey.

1385
01:47:39,793 --> 01:47:41,879
You could be happy here.

1386
01:47:42,296 --> 01:47:44,173
Sure.

1387
01:47:44,173 --> 01:47:47,092
But I'm not gonna let anybody
stop me this time.

1388
01:47:47,092 --> 01:47:48,969
Who's stopping you?

1389
01:47:49,178 --> 01:47:52,097
Pack your bags. I'll take you to Monterey.

1390
01:47:54,391 --> 01:47:57,102
I don't give a damn about that ranch.

1391
01:48:06,487 --> 01:48:07,738
All right.

1392
01:48:07,946 --> 01:48:09,198
All right?

TOMMY: When we get to Monterey,
will you let me write to Audrey?

1396
01:48:26,089 --> 01:48:29,009
ALICE: I think Audrey's a little mature
for you.

1397
01:48:29,009 --> 01:48:32,137
I don't think she's mature.
I think she's nice.

1398
01:48:35,891 --> 01:48:39,436
Mom, when are we going?
School starts in two weeks.

1399
01:48:40,270 --> 01:48:42,981
Yeah, I know. Look, honey...

1400
01:48:43,607 --> 01:48:46,527
I know I promised I'd get you to Monterey
before school starts.

1401
01:48:46,735 --> 01:48:50,906
If I don't, Monterey isn't the only town
in this country that's got a school.

1402
01:48:50,906 --> 01:48:53,826
-I might get to go to school here?
-Maybe.

1403
01:48:53,826 --> 01:48:55,285
Great!

1404
01:48:55,285 --> 01:48:57,996
You mean, you won't mind
if we don't get to Monterey?

1405
01:48:58,205 --> 01:49:00,082
It wasn't my idea. It was your idea.

1406
01:49:00,082 --> 01:49:01,542
Thank God.

1407
01:49:02,793 --> 01:49:07,172
I mean, if I'm going to be a singer,
I can be a singer anywhere, right?

1408
01:49:09,258 --> 01:49:11,760
You really love David, don't you?

1409
01:49:12,803 --> 01:49:14,680
Yep, I do.

1410
01:49:15,514 --> 01:49:18,642
I like him, too.
I just hate his taste in music.

TOMMY: You always said
you could fight with somebody...
